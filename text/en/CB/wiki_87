<text>Robert Kennicott (November 13, 1835 – May 13, 1866) was an American naturalist and herpetologist. Chronic illness kept Kennicott out of school as a child. Instead, Kennicott spent most of his time outdoors, collecting plants and animals. His father schooled him at home and convinced naturalist Jared Potter Kirtland to take him as an understudy. Soon, Kennicott was providing specimens for the Smithsonian Institution via assistant secretary Spencer Fullerton Baird.

Kennicott advocated for the study and protection of native prairie animals in an era when farmers sought to eradicate them. He teamed with Northwestern University to found a natural history museum in 1857, then founded the Chicago Academy of Sciences. While in Chicago he served as a mentor to several young naturalists, including William Healey Dall. He joined the Megatherium Club and studied specimens in Hudson Bay. The Western Union Telegraph Expedition commissioned Kennicott as a scientist for their excursion in the mid-1860s. Kennicott died on the expedition and was memorialized as the namesake of Alaska&#x27;s Kennicott Glacier. His home, &quot;The Grove&quot; in Glenview, Illinois, is today recognized as a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service.

==Biography==
Robert Kennicott was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, on November 13, 1835. His father, John Albert, was interested in botany and maintained a large land holding in Northfield Township, Cook County, Illinois, which came to be known as &quot;The Grove&quot;. Robert was a sickly child and attempted to improve his overall health by spending much time outdoors. He did not attend school regularly, but his father ensured that he received an education at home. Under the tutelage of his father, Kennicott learned to patiently observe nature and began a collection of specimens.

Jared Potter Kirtland, a friend of Kennicott&#x27;s father and one of the leading naturalists in the west, agreed to take Robert as an understudy in late 1852. Kennicott wintered with Kirtland in East Rockport (now Lakewood), Ohio. Kirtland encouraged Kennicott to contact other naturalists, and soon Kennicott had come to the attention of Spencer Fullerton Baird, the assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. For the next thirteen years, Kennicott would correspond with Baird about his findings. As Illinois was still largely undocumented by naturalists, Baird encouraged Kennicott to send him specimens.

In 1855, the Illinois Central Railroad commissioned the Illinois State Agricultural Society to prepare a survey of the state&#x27;s natural resources. Kennicott&#x27;s father was the secretary of the society and recommended Robert for the job. After the excursion, Kennicott published a catalog of the animals of Cook County. The first new animal species identified by Kennicott was a Northern Illinois snake, which he sent to Baird. Baird suggested that Kennicott name the animal after Kirtland, &quot;Regina kirtlandii&quot; (today &quot;Clonophis kirtlandii&quot;). Kennicott published a three-part paper from 1856 to 1858 entitled &quot;The Quadrupeds of Illinois, Injurious and Beneficial to the Farmer&quot;. In it, Kennicott pleaded with farmers to first study the habits of wild animals before attempting to eradicate them. The Board of Trustees of Northwestern University approached Kennicott in early 1857, asking him to help them create a natural history museum. Later that year, Kennicott co-founded the Chicago Academy of Sciences. For the next two winters, Kennicott worked at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C., helping Baird organize its amphibian and reptile collections. There, he met William Stimpson and became a part of the Megatherium Club.

In April 1859 he set off on an expedition to collect natural history specimens in the subarctic boreal forests of northwestern Canada in what is now the Mackenzie and Yukon river valleys and in the Arctic tundra beyond. Kennicott became popular with Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company fur traders in the area and encouraged them to collect and send natural history specimens and First Nations artifacts to the Smithsonian. He returned to Washington at the end of 1862. Kennicott considered joining the Union Army in the Civil War, but was convinced otherwise, sending a substitute. Robert and his younger brother lived in the Smithsonian Castle during the war along with Edward Drinker Cope and other noted naturalists. He returned to Illinois in 1863 to tend to his ailing father, who died later that year.
While working at the Smithsonian Institution under Assistant Secretary Spencer F. Baird, Robert Kennicott wrote the original descriptions of many new snake taxa brought back by expeditions to the American West. He also collected snake specimens including with his specimen collecting first cousin Helen L. Teunisson. He subsequently named the subspecies &quot;Carphophis amoenus helenae&quot; in her honor.

In 1864 the Western Union Telegraph Expedition was mounted to find a possible route for a telegraph line between North America and Russia by way of the Bering Sea. Kennicott was selected as the scientist for this expedition, and the party of naturalists sent to assist him included W.H. Dall.

The expedition arrived in San Francisco in April 1865, but disagreements between its leaders meant that little was achieved. The party moved north to Vancouver where Kennicott suffered a period of ill health. After his recovery they moved north again to Alaska in August 1865. Kennicott died in May 1866 while traveling up the Yukon River. His body was returned to his family&#x27;s home in Illinois, enclosed in a metal canister and shipped via Russia and Japan rather than sent back on undeveloped trails through Canada. 
In an interesting twist, the scientist became the subject of study. An investigation in 2001–2016 into the cause of his death suggested that Kennicott may have suffered from long QT syndrome, a congenital cardiac condition that can cause an irregular heartbeat, weakness, and fainting spells. This was made worse by strychnine, a drug that Kennicott regularly self-administered to improve his condition, but which only aggravated it. According to a summary of the research in the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, &quot;the combination of stress, physical exhaustion and toxic &#x27;medicine&#x27; was too much for the young scientist&#x27;s weak heart,&quot; and led to his death by cardiac arrest. With permission of his family, his body has been added to the human anatomy collection at the Smithsonian.

==Legacy==
To commemorate his efforts on behalf of science, Kennicott Glacier, Kennicott Valley, MV Kennicott, and the Kennicott River were named after him. The town of Kennecott, famous for rich copper mines, was named for its proximity to the glacier. However, the name was slightly misspelled. Natural features have retained the original spelling of his name, while the mines and related businesses have continued to use this alternate spelling.

Additionally, two birds retain Kennicott&#x27;s name: the western screech owl (&quot;Megascops kennicottii&quot; ) and the Alaskan Arctic Warbler (&quot;Phylloscopus borealis kennicottii&quot; ).

Some of his papers are maintained at Northwestern University, others at his family home, The Grove, a National Historic Landmark in Glenview, Illinois, where his original grave remains in a family plot. His papers are also available on microfilm at the Glenview Public Library in the Genealogy &amp; Local History Room.

A 3-D reconstruction of his face has been done by the Smithsonian Institution, by scanning his skull and using computers to reconstruct his facial structure. A 3-D copy of the skull was then made, onto which a sculptor molded clay into the facial reconstruction.

Nature writer Donald Culross Peattie (Donald C. Peattie) includes a sketch of Kennicott&#x27;s life in Peattie&#x27;s memoir, entitled &quot;The Road of a Naturalist. Peattie spent time at Kennicott&#x27;s Grove during his childhood.

<doc id="840581" wikidata="Q2353016" url="?curid=840581" title="M-40 (Michigan highway)">
<text>M-40 is a north–south state trunkline highway in the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan. The highway runs from US Highway 12 (US 12) near the Indiana state line in Porter Township north through Paw Paw and Allegan to end in the outskirts of Holland. The current northern end is near Interstate 196 (I-196) at an intersection with US 31/Business Loop I-196 (BL 196). In between, M-40 runs through mixed agricultural and forest lands and along lakes and rivers through Southwest Michigan.

The trunkline was designated by July 1, 1919, along with the rest of the original state highway system along a route that is different that of that of the 21st century. South of Paw Paw, the original M-40 reached Niles and even the Indiana state line for a time. The northern end was extended in stages to Holland. The southern end was shifted in the 1970s, resulting in the modern routing.

==Route description==
M-40 starts at an intersection with US 12 in rural Cass County. Running north through farm fields, the highway rounds Bar Lake and into the community of Jones. The area around Jones has a few more lakes in a wooded setting. As the trunkline continues north, it passes back into farm lands. The road curves around to the northwest as it passes between Bogart Lake and Streeters Mill Pond near Dutch Settlement Road. M-40 follows Centre Street into Marcellus. When the highway meets the western end of M-216 in town, M-40 turns west along Main Street and runs out of town. The roadway returns to a northerly course, and later it curves northwesterly again near Cedar Lake near the Van Buren County line.

Continuing north, the trunkline passes through mixed agricultural and wood lands into the community of Lawton. M-40 follows Main Street through town and exits on a northwestern track towards the village of Paw Paw. M-40 crosses over I-94 and turns north into town running along Maple Lake. The highway crosses the narrow isthmus between the larger Maple Lake and the smaller Ackley Lake, passing through some small residential subdivisions as it leaves Paw Paw. Small farms dot the landscape as M-40 crosses M-43 in a rural area of the county on the way to Gobles. It is in this small city that the road crosses the Kal-Haven Trail State Park, a linear park that follows the former Kalamazoo and South Haven Railroad line. The rail line was converted into a rail trail and allows users to bike, hike or snowmobile between Kalamazoo and South Haven.

M-40 crosses into Allegan County near Base Line Lake. The highway follows Jenner Street along some curves near the banks of the Kalamazoo River as the trunkline enters the south side of Allegan. M-40 meets M-89, and the two highways run concurrently into downtown together on Cedar Street. At the intersection with Cutler Street, M-40/M-89 meets the western end of M-222 and M-40/M-89 turns west onto Cutler Street. The street name changes to Western Avenue as M-40/M-89 curves north and northwest, crossing the Kalamazoo River and leaving town. North of Lake Allegan, M-89 separates and runs west toward Fennville, and M-40 extends to Hamilton, crossing the Rabbit River. The highway runs through more farms and approaches the outskirts of Holland. The trunkline crosses over I-196 and follows Lincoln Road through an industrial area on the southeast side of town. At 48th Street, the highway turns west until meeting Lincoln Avenue. There, M-40 turns north for several blocks before ending at the intersection with BL I-196/US 31.

==History==
When M-40 was created around by July 1, 1919, it originally ran from Niles to Dowagiac and Decatur roughly along the current path of M-51. Then it traveled to the northeast where it entered Paw Paw and continued north to Allegan. M-40 is shown on a commercial 1921 map extending south of Niles to the Indiana state line, the segment used for the routing of US 31 starting in 1926, but not shown extending to Allegan. A section of the highway was realigned in the same time period near Paw Paw; after the change, M-40 followed the contemporary US 12 instead of Paw Paw Road. A rerouting of M-89 in 1927 shifted it to run from Allegan southeast to Plainwell instead of east to Martin; M-40 replaced M-89 on the Allegan–Martin roadway. In 1929, the routing from Allegan to Martin was removed and renumbered M-118, and M-40 was extended to the north out of Allegan along M-89 and its modern routing to a new terminus in Holland ending at US 31. The last segment of unpaved highway was paved in late 1945 or early 1946. This segment was near Dunningville in central Allegan County.

In late 1960 or early 1961, when the I-94 freeway was completed in Van Buren County, M-40 moved to the new freeway for four miles (6.4 km), between present day exits 56 and 60, and the former route along old US 12 was returned to local control. In late 1971, all of M-40 south of I-94 was reassigned the designation M-51 while M-40 was shifted to the east to take over the routing of the contemporary M-119 between Paw Paw and its intersection with US 12 in Porter Township near Mottville; the change was made in order to give M-40 &quot;north-south continuity&quot; and to remove M-40 markers from I-94. In 1994, the northern terminus was scaled back from the US 31 business loop to its present terminus at US 31 on the southeast side of Holland.

Local officials in Allegan have proposed creation of a truck route around the town. Concerned about the traffic and noise, residents have formed the Citizens for a Safer Community. They cite reports that show that the accident rates in town are higher than the statewide average. The group and local officials are proposing using 24th Street, 118th Avenue and Babylon Road for truck traffic. MDOT would require permits to erect the signs needed for the truck route. The department has indicated that the bypass would not be a state highway. MDOT will not take ownership of the roads needed for the truck route, but overall the department is supportive of the city&#x27;s efforts to make the downtown area more pedestrian friendly.

<text>Sargans is a municipality in the &quot;Wahlkreis&quot; (constituency) of Sarganserland in the canton of St. Gallen in Switzerland.

Sargans is known for its castle, which dates from before the founding of the Swiss Confederation in 1291. Sargans was also a County of the Holy Roman Empire; &quot;see County of Sargans&quot;.

==History==

There are traces of Neolithic settlement in the area. 
A significant Roman-era estate was destroyed by an Alamannic incursion in .
Sargans remained part of Lower Raetia in the early medieval period, with gradual displacement of Rumantsch by Alemannic speakers during the high medieval period.
A church dedicated to Saint Cassian is mentioned in the 9th century. 
Sargans was part of the territory of the county of Werdenberg from the 12th century, with a separate line of &quot;Werdenberg-Sargans&quot; established in the later 13th century. The castle was presumably first built in the 12th century and is first mentioned in 1282. The town of Sargans grew around the castle in the 13th century.

Sargans is mentioned as &quot;Senegaunis&quot; in the 11th century. An earlier mention as &quot;de Senegaune&quot;, ostensibly dated to 765, survives in a 16th-century copy.
In 1248 it was mentioned as &quot;Sanegans&quot;, in 1264 as &quot;Sangans&quot; and in 1332 as &quot;Santgans&quot;. The modern spelling dates to the 16th century.
The etymology of the name is unknown; &quot;San-&quot; seems to have changed to &quot;Sar-&quot; under the influence of the hydronym &quot;Saar&quot;. 
A popular etymology connecting the name &quot;Sargans&quot; to &quot;goose&quot; (German &quot;Gans&quot;) may date to as early as the 15th century.

From 1406, a combined fortification of the town and the castle was built.
In 1445, the town, but not the castle, was captured and burned by the Swiss Confederacy.
The town was given limited rights of self-government in 1456 when the count agreed to select a Schultheiss out of a list of three candidates to be submitted by the burghers. In 1483, count Jürg of Werdenberg-Sargans was forced to sell the county to the Swiss Confederacy for 15,000 Rhenish guilder. From this time until 1798, the castle was the seat of the Swiss reeves. The town burned down again in 1490.
In 1501, the Swiss Confederacy confirmed the city rights of Sargans and granted the right for a weekly market.

The municipal coat of arms goes back to the 15th century.
It is canting, showing a goose based on the folk etymology for the name &quot;Sargans&quot;. The historical coat of arms of the county of Sargans was &quot;azure three mullets or&quot;.

In 1798, Sargans became part of the Mels district of the Canton of Linth in the Helvetic Republic. It was incorporated into the Canton of St. Gallen in 1803.
Most of the town was destroyed by fire in 1811.

Sargans is at the juncture of the railway lines connecting Chur with Zürich and with Lake Constance, built in 1859. The line to Vienna was added in 1884.
The Saar was first canalised in 1858 for the construction of the railway station and again in 1978 for the construction of the A3-A13 motorway junction.
Sargans remained mostly unaffected by industrialisation; the Gonzen iron ore mine was closed down in 1966.

<doc id="840587" wikidata="Q950941" url="?curid=840587" title="Christian reconstructionism">
<text>Christian reconstructionism is a fundamentalist Calvinist theonomic movement. It developed primarily under the direction of R. J. Rushdoony, Greg Bahnsen and Gary North and has had an important influence on the Christian right in the United States. Its central theme is that society should be reconstructed under the lordship of Jesus in all aspects of life. In keeping with the biblical cultural mandate, reconstructionists advocate for theonomy and the restoration of certain biblical laws said to have continued applicability. These include the death penalty not only for murder, but also for idolatry, homosexuality, adultery, witchcraft and blasphemy.&lt;ref name= &quot;North http://s155777461.onlinehome.us/docs/html/gnun/GNUN-125.html 118&quot;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Calvinists reject Christian reconstructionism and hold to classical covenant theology, which is the traditional Calvinist view of the relationship between the Old Covenant and Christianity.

Christian reconstructionism is closely linked with postmillennial eschatology and the presuppositional apologetics of Cornelius Van Til.

==Reconstructionist perspective==

===Theonomy===

Christian reconstructionists advocate a theonomic government and libertarian economic principles. They maintain a distinction of spheres of authority between self, family, church, and state. For example, the enforcement of moral sanctions under theonomy is carried out by the family and church government, and sanctions for moral offenses are outside the authority of civil government (which is limited to criminal matters, courts and national defense). However, some believe these distinctions become blurred, as the application of theonomy implies an increase in the authority of the civil government. Reconstructionists also say that the theonomic government is not an oligarchy or monarchy of man communicating with God, but rather, a national recognition of existing laws. Some of the prominent advocates of Christian reconstructionism have written that according to their understanding, God&#x27;s law approves of the death penalty not only for murder, but also for propagators of all forms of idolatry, open homosexuality, adulterers, practitioners of witchcraft, blasphemers, and perhaps even recalcitrant youths (see the List of capital crimes in the Bible).

Christian reconstructionism&#x27;s founder, Rousas Rushdoony, wrote in &quot;The Institutes of Biblical Law&quot; (the founding document of reconstructionism) that Old Testament law should be applied to modern society, and he advocates the reinstatement of the Mosaic law&#x27;s penal sanctions such as stoning. Under such a system, the list of civil crimes which carried a death sentence would include murder, homosexuality, adultery, incest, lying about one&#x27;s virginity, bestiality, witchcraft, idolatry or apostasy, public blasphemy, false prophesying, kidnapping, rape, and bearing false witness in a capital case. However, Greg Bahnsen points out that such a system would only be possible if the culture at large were a Christian culture, and that the force of government could not be used to impose Christianity on a culture that did not want it.

Kayser points out that the Bible advocates justice, and that biblical punishments prescribed for crimes are the &quot;maximum&quot; allowable to maintain justice and not the only available option, because lesser punishments are authorized as well.

===Views on pluralism===
Rousas Rushdoony wrote in &quot;The Institutes of Biblical Law&quot;: &quot;The heresy of democracy has since [the days of colonial New England] worked havoc in church and state&quot; and: &quot;Christianity and democracy are inevitably enemies&quot;, and he said elsewhere that &quot;Christianity is completely and radically anti-democratic; it is &quot;committed to spiritual aristocracy&quot;,&quot; and characterized democracy as &quot;the great love of the failures and cowards of life&quot;. He nevertheless repeatedly expressed his opposition to any sort of violent revolution and advocated instead the gradual reformation (often termed &quot;regeneration&quot; in his writings) of society from the bottom up, beginning with the individual and the family and from there gradually reforming other spheres of authority, including the church and the state.

Rushdoony believed that a republic is a better form of civil government than a democracy. According to Rushdoony, a republic avoided mob rule and the rule of the &quot;51%&quot; of society; in other words &quot;might does not make right&quot; in a republic. Rushdoony wrote that America&#x27;s separation of powers between 3 branches of government is a far more neutral and better method of civil government than a direct democracy, stating &quot;[t]he [American] Constitution was designed to perpetuate a Christian order&quot;. Rushdoony argues that the Constitution&#x27;s purpose was to protect religion from the federal government and to preserve &quot;states&#x27; rights.&quot;

Kennard, a Professor of Theology and Philosophy at the Houston Graduate School of Theology, wrote with regard to Christian reconstructionism, that Christians of non-Calvinist traditions, such as some &quot;Baptist, Methodist, Catholic, [and] Orthodox&quot;, would be &quot;under threat of capital punishment as fostered by the extreme Theonomist.&quot; On the other hand, Ligon Duncan has stated that &quot;Roman Catholics to Episcopalians to Presbyterians to Pentecostals&quot;, as well as &quot;Arminian and Calvinist, charismatic and non-charismatic, high Church and low Church traditions are all represented in the broader umbrella of Reconstructionism (often in the form of the &quot;Christian America&quot; movement).&quot;

==Influence on the Christian right in general==

Although it has a relatively small number of self-described adherents, Christian reconstructionism has played a role in promoting the trend toward explicitly Christian politics in the larger American Christian right. This is the wider trend to which some critics refer, generally, as dominionism. Also, they allegedly have an amount of influence which is disproportionate to their numbers among advocates of the growth of the Christian homeschooling movement and other Christian education movements that seek independence from the direct oversight or support of the civil government. Because their numbers are so small compared to their influence, they are sometimes accused of being secretive and conspiratorial.

In Matthew 28:18, Jesus says, &quot;All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.&quot; This verse is seen as an announcement by Jesus that he has assumed authority over all earthly authority. In that light, some theologians interpret the Great Commission as a command to exercise that authority in his name, bringing all things (including societies and cultures) into subjection under his commands. Rousas Rushdoony, for example, interpreted the Great Commission as a republication of the &quot;creation mandate&quot;, referring to Genesis 1:28
For Rushdoony, the idea of dominion implied a form of Christian theocracy or, more accurately, a theonomy. For example, he wrote that:
Elsewhere he wrote:
Many evangelical Christians of all types have embraced Christian Reconstructionism in part or in whole. Evangelical leaders who endorsed it explicitly or implicitly include Jerry Falwell Sr., Bill Gothard, Jay Grimstead, D. James Kennedy, Tim LaHaye, Doug Phillips, Howard Phillips, Pat Robertson, Francis Schaeffer, and Wayne Whitehead. Gothard and the two Phillipses, for example, used Christian Reconstructionism to build the evangelical homeschooling community of the 1970s and 1980s. Robertson and Kennedy hosted Rushdoony on their television programs, and Robertson also used dominionist language in his book, &quot;The Secret Kingdom&quot;, and in his 1988 presidential campaign.

Grimstead, of the Coalition on Revival, summarized the position of many evangelical leaders: &quot;&#x27;I don&#x27;t call myself [a Reconstructionist],&#x27; but &#x27;A lot of us are coming to realize that the Bible is God&#x27;s standard of morality ... in all points of history ... and for all societies, Christian and non-Christian alike... It so happens that Rushdoony, Bahnsen, and North understood that sooner.&#x27; He added, &#x27;There are a lot of us floating around in Christian leadership—James Kennedy is one of them—who don&#x27;t go all the way with the theonomy thing, but who want to rebuild America based on the Bible.&#x27;&quot;

==Christian critics==
Michael Horton of Westminster Seminary California has warned against the seductiveness of power-religion. The Christian rhetoric of the movement is weak, he argues, against the logic of its authoritarian and legalistic program, which will always drive reconstructionism toward sub-Christian ideas about sin, and the perfectibility of human nature (such as to imagine that, if Christians are in power, they will not be inclined to do evil). On the contrary, Horton and others maintain, God&#x27;s law can, often has been, and will be put to evil uses by Christians and others, in the state, in churches, in the marketplace, and in families; and these crimes are aggravated, because to oppose a wrong committed through abuse of God&#x27;s law, a critic must bear being labeled an enemy of God&#x27;s law.

J. Ligon Duncan of the Department of Systematic Theology of Reformed Theological Seminary in Jackson, Mississippi, warns that &quot;Theonomy, in gross violation of biblical patterns and common sense, ignores the context of the giving of the law to the redemptive community of the Old Testament. This constitutes an approach to the nature of the civil law very different from Calvin and the rest of the Reformed tradition, which sees the civil law as God&#x27;s application of his eternal standards to the particular exigencies of his people.&quot; Duncan rejects the reconstructionists&#x27; insistence that &quot;the Old Testament civil case law is normative for the civil magistrate and government in the New Covenant era&quot;. He views their denial of the threefold distinction between moral, civil, and ceremonial law as representing one of the severe flaws in the reconstructionist hermeneutic.

The late Professor Meredith Kline, whose own theology has influenced the method of several reconstructionist theologians, adamantly maintained that reconstructionism made the mistake of failing to understand the special prophetic role of biblical Israel, including the laws and sanctions, calling it &quot;a delusive and grotesque perversion of the teachings of scripture.&quot; Kline&#x27;s student, Lee Irons, furthers the critique:

Rodney Clapp wrote that reconstructionism is an anti-democratic movement.

In an April 2009 article in &quot;Christianity Today&quot; about theologian and writer Douglas Wilson, the magazine described reconstructionism as outside the &quot;mainstream&quot; views of evangelical Christians. It also stated that it &quot;borders on a call for outright theocracy&quot;.

George M. Marsden, a professor of history at the University of Notre Dame, has remarked in &quot;Christianity Today&quot; that &quot;Reconstructionism in its pure form is a radical movement&quot;. He also wrote, &quot;[t]he positive proposals of Reconstructionists are so far out of line with American evangelical commitments to American republican ideals such as religious freedom that the number of true believers in the movement is small.&quot;

Popular religious author, feminist, and former Roman Catholic religious sister Karen Armstrong sees a potential for &quot;fascism&quot; in Christian reconstructionism, and sees the eventual Dominion envisioned by theologians R. J. Rushdoony and Gary North as &quot;totalitarian. There is no room for any other view or policy, no democratic tolerance for rival parties, no individual freedom.&quot;

Traditional Calvinist Christians have argued that Christian reconstructionists have &quot;significantly misunderstood the positions of Calvin, other Reformed teachers and the Westminster Confession concerning the relationship between the Sinai covenant&#x27;s ethical stipulations and the Christian obligation to the Mosaic judicial laws today.&quot;

==Relationship to dominionism==
Some sociologists and critics refer to reconstructionism as a type of dominionism. These critics claim that the frequent use of the word &quot;dominion&quot; by reconstructionist writers strongly associates the critical term &quot;dominionism&quot; with this movement. As an ideological form of dominionism, reconstructionism is sometimes held up as the most typical form of dominion theology.

The Protestant theologian Francis Schaeffer is linked with the movement by some critics, but some reconstructionist thinkers are highly critical of his positions. Schaeffer himself disavowed any connection or affiliation with reconstructionism, though he did cordially correspond with Rushdoony on occasion. Authors Sara Diamond and Fred Clarkson suggest that Schaeffer shared with reconstructionism the tendency toward dominionism.

Christian reconstructionists object to the &quot;dominionism&quot; and the &quot;dominion theology&quot; labels, which they say misrepresent their views. Some separate Christian cultural and political movements object to being described with the label &quot;dominionism&quot;, because in their mind the word implies attachment to reconstructionism. In reconstructionism, the idea of &quot;godly&quot; dominion, subject to God, is contrasted with the &quot;autonomous&quot; dominion of mankind in rebellion against God.

<doc id="840588" wikidata="Q2341780" url="?curid=840588" title="Dracunculus (nematode)">
<text>Dracunculus is a genus of spirurid nematode parasites in the family Dracunculidae.

The worms can reach a metre in length. If one simply pulls off the protruding head of the worm, the worm will break and leak high levels of foreign antigen which can lead to anaphylactic shock and fast death of the host. Hence it is important to remove the worm slowly (over a period of weeks). This is typically undertaken by winding the worm onto a stick (say, a matchstick), by a few centimetres each day.

==Life cycle==
All members of &quot;Dracunculus&quot; are obligate parasites of mammals or reptiles. Adult females reside just under the skin, and eventually form a blister in the host&#x27;s skin through which they access the environment. When the blister comes into contact with water, the female releases several hundred thousand first-stage (&quot;L1&quot;) larvae. L1 larvae must be ingested by a cyclopoid copepod, which serves as an intermediate host. Inside the copepod, the larvae develop to the third-stage (&quot;L3&quot;). Definitive hosts acquire &quot;Dracunculus&quot; by incidentally ingesting infected copepods while drinking water, or by consuming a paratenic host (e.g. a frog or fish) that has itself consumed a copepod. Inside the definitive host, the L3 larvae leave the digestive tract and migrate to deeper tissues, where within 60–70 days they undergo their final two molts to form sexually mature adults. Male and female adult worms then mate, and pregnant females migrate back to the host&#x27;s skin – typically to an extremity – and form a blister to repeat the cycle. Following the release of her larvae, the female worm dies, and is either extracted by the affected animal, or falls back into the tissue and is calcified.

==Description==

Once released, the L1 larvae measure 0.3–0.9 millimeters in length and feature a very long tapered tail. As they develop into L3 larvae, they lose the tapered tail, broaden, and develop a tri-lobed tail; the lengths of most L3 larvae are unknown. Adults of both sexes are narrow yellow-white colored worms, with a rounded front-end, and a conical tail-end with a pointed tip. Females of different species within the genus tend to look similar, and can rarely be distinguished on morphology alone. The body of a fertilized adult female is almost completely filled by its uterus, distended with L1 larvae. Adult female &quot;Dracunculus&quot; worms are noted for their extraordinary length, with some growing up to 100 centimeters long. Males are much smaller (16 – 40 millimeters) and are relatively rare – in some species the male has never been described.

==Distribution==
&quot;Dracunculus&quot; worms are distributed globally, though each species has a narrower range. The majority of &quot;Dracunculus&quot; species described infect reptiles – predominantly snakes. These are spread across the globe, with &quot;D. ophidensis&quot; in the United States, &quot;D. brasiliensis&quot; in Brazil, &quot;D. coluberensis&quot; and &quot;D. alii&quot; in India, &quot;D. houdemeri&quot; in Vietnam, &quot;D. doi&quot; in Madagascar, &quot;D. dahomensis&quot; in Benin, &quot;D. oesophageus&quot; in Italy, and &quot;D. mulbus&quot; in Australia and Papua New Guinea. The only species known to infect a non-snake reptile is &quot;D. globocephalus&quot; which has been described in snapping turtles in the United States and Costa Rica.

Most mammal-infecting species are in the Americas, with &quot;D. insignis&quot; infecting several wild and domestic mammals in the United States and Canada, &quot;D. lutrae&quot; infecting river otters in the United States and Canada, and &quot;D. fuelleborni&quot; infecting big-eared opossums in Brazil. The major exception is &quot;D. medinensis&quot;, also known as Guinea Worm Disease, as it is by far the most studied &quot;Dracunculus&quot; as it infects humans. &quot;D. medinensis&quot; was historically widespread in sub-saharan Africa and South Asia, but is now limited to dozens of cases annually in humans and domestic dogs, and may soon be driven to extinction due to eradication efforts.

==Species==
===Reptile-infecting species===
There are 14 accepted &quot;Dracunculus&quot; species, 10 of which infect reptiles. Eurasia hosts several reptile-infecting &quot;Dracunculus&quot; species. &quot;D. oesophageus&quot; was originally described from the esophagus of &quot;the viperine water snake&quot;, and has been described several times since. The remaining three Eurasian reptile-infecting species have been described a single time each: &quot;D. coluberensis&quot; from an Indian trinket snake, and &quot;D. alii&quot; and &quot;D. houdemeri&quot; from Checkered keelback snakes in India and Vietnam respectively. 

The only snake-infecting &quot;Dracunculus&quot; species known in North America is &quot;D. ophidensis&quot;. It was originally described in garter snakes in Michigan and Minnesota by Sterling Brackett in 1938, and has since been reported in blackbelly garter snakes from Mexico, as well as northern water snakes and a plain-bellied water snake in Michigan. &quot;D. brasiliensis&quot; is the only described snake-infecting &quot;Dracunculus&quot; in South America. It was described in 2009 based on a single female worm from an anaconda in Brazil, and has since also been found in a Brazilian brown-banded water snake. Several worms that appear to be from the genus &quot;Dracunculus&quot; have been described in Central America, South America, and the Caribbean; however, they have not been described in sufficient detail to assign them to a species. The Americas are also home to the only known turtle-infecting &quot;Dracunculus&quot; (also the only species that infects a non-snake reptile), &quot;D. globocephalus&quot;. First described in 1927 in Oklahoma and Illinois, it is now found in snapping turtles across the United States, as well as the South American snapping turtle in Costa Rica.

Africa hosts two known snake-infecting species. Both male and female &quot;D. doi&quot; were described from Madagascar ground boas in 1960 and 1973 respectively. &quot;D. dahomensis&quot; has been described only from a captive African rock python. 

In Australia, the only known snake-infecting &quot;Dracunculus&quot; is &quot;D. mulbus&quot;, described from numerous water pythons in Northern Australia in 2007. It has since been described in Papua New Guinea&#x27;s Papuan olive python as well.

===Mammal-infecting species===

Just four &quot;Dracunculus&quot; species are known to infect mammals, of which the best known is the human parasite &quot;D. medinensis&quot;. Historically spread across Africa and South Asia, a major eradication effort has restricted &quot;D. medinensis&quot; to just Chad, Ethiopia, Mali, and South Sudan. Case numbers have similarly fallen, from an estimated 3.5 million per year at the 1986 start of the eradication program, to just 15 in 2021. &quot;D. medinensis&quot; is now most common in dogs, particularly in Chad, where it may spread via fish or frogs as paratenic hosts.

&quot;D. insignis&quot; infects dogs and wild carnivores, causing cutaneous lesions, ulcers, and sometimes heart and vertebral column lesions. Like &quot;D. medinensis&quot;, it is also known as Guinea worm, as well as &quot;Dragon&quot; or &quot;Fiery Dragon&quot;. The range of &quot;D. insignis&quot; is limited to North America.

&quot;D. fuelliborni&quot; parasitizes opossum, &quot;D. lutrae&quot; parasitizes otters, and &quot;D. ophidensis&quot; parasitizes reptiles.

<text>Merlin is a family of rocket engines developed by SpaceX. They are currently a part of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles, and were formerly used on the Falcon 1. Merlin engines use RP-1 and liquid oxygen as rocket propellants in a gas-generator power cycle. The Merlin engine was originally designed for sea recovery and reuse, but since 2016 the entire Falcon 9 booster is recovered for reuse by landing vertically on a landing pad using one of its nine Merlin engines.

The injector at the heart of Merlin is of the pintle type that was first used in the Apollo Lunar Module landing engine (LMDE). Propellants are fed by a single-shaft, dual-impeller turbopump. The turbopump also provides high-pressure fluid for the hydraulic actuators, which then recycles into the low-pressure inlet. This eliminates the need for a separate hydraulic drive system and means that thrust vectoring control failure by running out of hydraulic fluid is not possible.

==Revisions==
===Merlin 1A===
The initial version, the Merlin 1A, used an inexpensive, expendable, ablatively cooled carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer composite nozzle and produced of thrust.
The Merlin 1A flew only twice: first on March 24, 2006, when it caught fire and failed due to a fuel leak shortly after launch, and the second time on March 21, 2007, when it performed successfully. Both times the Merlin 1A was mounted on a Falcon 1 first stage.

The SpaceX turbopump was an entirely new, clean-sheet design contracted to Barber-Nichols, Inc. in 2002, who performed all design, engineering analysis, and construction; the company had previously worked on turbopumps for the RS-88 (Bantam) and NASA Fastrac engine programs. The Merlin 1A turbopump used a unique friction-welded main shaft, with Inconel 718 ends and an integral aluminum RP-1 impeller in the middle. The turbopump housing was constructed using investment castings, with Inconel at the turbine end, aluminum in the center, and 300-series stainless steel at the LOX end. The turbine was a partial-admission (i.e., working fluid is only admitted through part of the rotation of the turbine; an arc, not the whole circumference) impulse design and turned at up to 20,000 rpm, with a total weight of .

===Merlin 1B===
The Merlin 1B rocket engine was an upgraded version of the Merlin 1A engine. The turbopump upgrades were handled by Barber-Nichols, Inc. for SpaceX. It was intended for Falcon 1 launch vehicles, capable of producing of thrust at sea level and in vacuum, and performing with a specific impulse of at sea level and in vacuum.

The Merlin 1B was enhanced over the 1A with a turbine upgrade, increasing power output from to . The turbine upgrade was accomplished by adding additional nozzles, turning the previously partial-admission design to full admission. Slightly enlarged impellers for both RP-1 and LOX were part of the upgrade. This model turned at a faster 22,000 rpm and developed higher discharge pressures. Turbopump weight was unchanged at .
Another notable change over the 1A was the move to TEA–TEB (pyrophoric) ignition over torch ignition.

Initial use of the Merlin 1B was to be on the Falcon 9 launch vehicle, on whose first stage there would have been a cluster of nine of these engines. Due to experience from the Falcon 1&#x27;s first flight, SpaceX moved its Merlin development to the Merlin 1C, which is regeneratively cooled. Therefore, the Merlin 1B was never used on a launch vehicle.
===Merlin 1C===

Three versions of the Merlin 1C engine were produced. The Merlin engine for Falcon 1 had a movable turbopump exhaust assembly, which was used to provide roll control by vectoring the exhaust. The Merlin 1C engine for the Falcon 9 first stage is nearly identical to the variant used for the Falcon 1, although the turbopump exhaust assembly is not movable. Finally, a Merlin 1C vacuum variant is used on the Falcon 9 second stage. This engine differs from the Falcon 9 first-stage variant in that it uses a larger exhaust nozzle optimized for vacuum operation and can be throttled between 60% and 100%.

The Merlin 1C uses a regeneratively cooled nozzle and combustion chamber. The turbopump used is a Merlin 1B model with only slight alterations. It was fired with a full mission duty firing of 170 seconds in November 2007, first flew on a mission in August 2008, powered the &quot;first developed liquid-fueled rocket to successfully reach orbit&quot;, Falcon 1 Flight 4, in September 2008, and powered the Falcon 9 on its maiden flight in June 2010.

As configured for use on Falcon 1 vehicles, the Merlin 1C had a sea-level thrust of , a vacuum thrust of and a vacuum specific impulse of . In this configuration, the engine consumed of propellant per second. Tests have been conducted with a single Merlin 1C engine successfully running a total of 27 minutes (counting together the duration of the various tests), which equals ten complete Falcon 1 flights. The Merlin 1C chamber and nozzle are cooled regeneratively by per second of kerosene flow and are able to absorb of heat energy.

A Merlin 1C was first used as part of the unsuccessful third attempt to launch a Falcon 1. In discussing the failure, Elon Musk noted: &quot;The flight of our first stage, with the new Merlin 1C engine that will be used in Falcon 9, was picture perfect.&quot; The Merlin 1C was used in the successful fourth flight of Falcon 1 on September 28, 2008.

On October 7, 2012, a Merlin 1C (Engine No. 1) of the CRS-1 mission experienced an anomaly at T+00:01:20, which appears on CRS-1 launch video as a flash. The failure occurred just as the vehicle achieved max-Q (maximum aerodynamic pressure). SpaceX&#x27;s internal review found that the engine was shut down after a sudden pressure loss and that only the aerodynamic shell was destroyed, generating the debris seen in the video; the engine did not explode, as SpaceX ground control continued to receive data from it throughout the flight. The primary mission was unaffected by the anomaly due to the nominal operation of the remaining eight engines and an onboard readjustment of the flight trajectory, but the secondary-mission payload failed to reach its target orbit due to safety protocols in place to prevent collisions with the ISS. These protocols prevented a second firing of the upper stage for the secondary payload.

SpaceX was planning to develop a version of Merlin 1C to be used in Falcon 9 Block II and Falcon 1E boosters. This engine and these booster models were dropped in favor of the more advanced Merlin 1D engine and longer Falcon 9 v1.1 booster.

===Merlin Vacuum (1C)===
On March 10, 2009, a SpaceX press release announced successful testing of the Merlin Vacuum engine. A variant of the 1C engine, Merlin Vacuum features a larger exhaust section and a significantly larger expansion nozzle to maximize the engine&#x27;s efficiency in the vacuum of space. Its combustion chamber is regeneratively cooled, while the niobium alloy expansion nozzle is radiatively cooled. The engine delivers a vacuum thrust of and a vacuum specific impulse of . The first production Merlin Vacuum engine underwent a full-duration orbital-insertion firing (329 seconds) of the integrated Falcon 9 second stage on January 2, 2010. It was flown on the second stage for the inaugural Falcon 9 flight on June 4, 2010. At full power and as of March 10, 2009, the Merlin Vacuum engine operates with the greatest efficiency of any American-made hydrocarbon-fueled rocket engine.

An unplanned test of a modified Merlin Vacuum engine was made in December 2010. Shortly before the scheduled second flight of the Falcon 9, two cracks were discovered in the niobium-alloy-sheet nozzle of the Merlin Vacuum engine. The engineering solution was to cut off the lower of the nozzle and launch two days later, as the extra performance that would have been gained from the longer nozzle was not necessary to meet the objectives of the mission. The modified engine successfully placed the second stage into an orbit of altitude.

===Merlin 1D===
The Merlin 1D engine was developed by SpaceX between 2011 and 2012, with first flight in 2013. The design goals for the new engine included increased reliability, improved performance, and improved manufacturability. In 2011, performance goals for the engine were a vacuum thrust of , a vacuum specific impulse (&quot;I&quot;sp) of , an expansion ratio of 16 (as opposed to the previous 14.5 of the Merlin 1C) and chamber pressure in the &quot;sweet spot&quot; of . Merlin 1D was originally designed to throttle between 100% and 70% of maximal thrust; however, further refinements since 2013 now allow the engine to throttle to 40%.

The basic Merlin fuel/oxidizer mixture ratio is controlled by the sizing of the propellant supply tubes to each engine, with only a small amount of the total flow trimmed out by a &quot;servo-motor-controlled butterfly valve&quot; to provide fine control of the mixture ratio.

On November 24, 2013, Elon Musk stated that the engine was actually operating at 85% of its potential, and they anticipated to be able to increase the sea-level thrust to about and a thrust-to-weight ratio of 180. This version of the Merlin 1D was used on Falcon 9 Full Thrust and first flew on Flight 20.

In May 2016, SpaceX announced plans to further upgrade the Merlin 1D by increasing vacuum thrust to and sea-level thrust to ; according to SpaceX, the additional thrust will increase the Falcon 9 LEO payload capability to about 22 metric tons on a fully expendable mission. SpaceX also noted that unlike the previous Full Thrust iteration of the Falcon 9 vehicle, the increase in performance is solely due to upgraded engines, and no other significant changes to the vehicle are publicly planned.

In May 2018, ahead of the first flight of Falcon 9 Block 5, SpaceX announced that the goal had been achieved. The Merlin 1D is now close to the sea-level thrust of the retired Rocketdyne H-1 / RS-27 engines used on Saturn I, Saturn IB, and Delta II.

On 23 February 2024, one of the nine Merlin engines powering that launch flew its 22nd mission, which was at the time the flight leading engine. It is already the most flown rocket engine to date, surpassing Space Shuttle Main Engine no. 2019&#x27;s record of 19 flights.

==== Anomalies ====
The March 18, 2020, launch of Starlink satellites on board a Falcon 9 experienced an early engine shutdown on ascent. The shutdown occurred 2 minutes 22 seconds into the flight and was accompanied with an &quot;event&quot; seen on camera. The rest of the Falcon 9 engines burned longer and did deliver the payload to orbit. However, the first stage was not successfully recovered. In a subsequent investigation SpaceX found that isopropyl alcohol, used as cleaning fluid, was trapped and ignited, causing the engine to be shut down. To address the issue, in a following launch SpaceX indicated that the cleaning process was not done.

On October 2, 2020, the launch of a GPS-III satellite was aborted at T-2 seconds due to a detected early startup on 2 of the 9 engines on the first stage. The engines were removed for further testing and it was found that a port in the gas generator was blocked. After removing the blockage the engines started as intended. After this, SpaceX inspected other engines across its fleet and found that two of the engines on the Falcon 9 rocket intended for the Crew-1 launch also had this problem. Those engines were replaced with new M1D engines.

On February 16, 2021, on Falcon 9 flight 108 launching Starlink satellites, an engine shut down early due to hot exhaust gasses passing through a damaged heat-shielding cover. The mission was a success, but the booster could not be recovered.

===Merlin 1D Vacuum===
A vacuum version of the Merlin 1D engine was developed for the Falcon 9 v1.1 and the Falcon Heavy second stage. As of 2020, the thrust of the Merlin 1D Vacuum is with a specific impulse of 348 seconds, the highest specific impulse ever for a U.S. hydrocarbon rocket engine. The increase is due to the greater expansion ratio afforded by operating in vacuum, now 165:1 using an updated nozzle extension.

The engine can throttle down to 39% of its maximum thrust, or .
====Merlin 1D Vacuum improvements and variants====
Transporter-7 mission launch debuted a new Merlin Vacuum engine (MVac for short) nozzle extension design or variant aimed at increasing cadence and reducing costs. This new nozzle extension is shorter and, as a result, decreases both performance and material usage. This nozzle is only used on lower-performance missions, as with this nozzle, the MVac engine produces 10% less thrust in space. The nozzle decreases the amount of material needed by 75%; this means that SpaceX can launch over three times as many missions with the same amount of rare niobium metal as with the longer design.

==== Anomalies ====

On July 11, 2024, Falcon 9 flight 354 launching Starlink group 9-3 from Vandenberg AFB in California experienced an anomaly with its MVac during an engine relight attempt to raise the perigee of the 22 Starlink satellites for deployment. On X, Elon Musk and SpaceX both confirmed the engine failed explosively during a second attempted relight, albeit in a manner that did not appear to damage the second stage of the vehicle as the stage went on to deploy the satellites on board.

==Design==
===Engine control===
SpaceX uses a triple-redundant design in the Merlin engine computers. The system uses three computers in each processing unit, each constantly checking on the others, to instantiate a fault-tolerant design. One processing unit is part of each of the ten Merlin engines (nine on the first stage, one on the second stage) used on the Falcon 9 launch vehicle.

===Turbopump===
The Merlin LOX/RP-1 turbopump used on Merlin engines 1A–1C was designed and developed by Barber-Nichols. It spins at 36,000 revolutions per minute, delivering .

===Gas generator===
The LOX/RP-1 turbopump on each Merlin engine is powered by a fuel-rich open-cycle gas generator similar to that used in the Apollo-era Rocketdyne F-1 engine.

==Production==
, SpaceX was producing Merlin engines at the rate of eight per month, planning eventually to raise production to about 33 engines per month (or 400 per year).
By September 2013, SpaceX total manufacturing space had increased to nearly , and the factory had been configured to achieve a maximum production rate of up to 40 rocket cores per year, enough to use the 400 annual engines envisioned by the earlier engine plan. By October 2014, SpaceX announced that it had manufactured the 100th Merlin 1D engine and that engines were now being produced at a rate of four per week, soon to be increased to five.

In February 2016, SpaceX indicated that the company will need to build hundreds of engines a year in order to support a Falcon 9/Falcon Heavy build rate of 30 rocket cores per year by the end of 2016.

Each Falcon 9 booster uses nine Merlin engines, and the second stage uses one Merlin vacuum engine. The second stage is expended, so each launch consumes one Merlin Vacuum engine. SpaceX designed the booster with its engines to be recovered for reuse by propulsive landing, and the first recovered booster was reused in March 2017. By 2020, only five of the 26 Falcon 9 launched that year used new boosters. By 2021, only two of the 31 Falcon 9 launches used new boosters.

== Past engine concepts ==
===Merlin 2 concept===
At the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Joint Propulsion conference on July 30, 2010, SpaceX McGregor rocket development facility director Tom Markusic shared some information from the initial stages of planning for a new engine. SpaceX’s Merlin 2 LOX/RP-1-fueled engine on a gas-generator cycle, capable of a projected of thrust at sea level and in a vacuum and would provide the power for conceptual super-heavy-lift launch vehicles from SpaceX, which Markusic dubbed Falcon X and Falcon XX. Such a capability, if built, would have resulted in an engine with more thrust than the F-1 engines used on the Saturn V.

Conceived to be potentially used on more capable variants of the Falcon 9 Heavy, Markusic indicated that the Merlin 2 &quot;could be qualified in three years for $1 billion&quot;. By mid-August, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk clarified that while the Merlin 2 engine architecture was a key element of any effort SpaceX would make toward their objective of &quot;super-heavy lift&quot; launch vehicles—and that SpaceX did indeed want to &quot;move toward super heavy lift&quot;—the specific potential design configurations of the particular launch vehicles shown by Markusic at the propulsion conference were merely conceptual &quot;brainstorming ideas&quot;, just a &quot;bunch of ideas for discussion.&quot;

Since the original discussion, no work on any &quot;Merlin 2&quot; kerolox engine has been pursued and made public. At the 2011 Joint Propulsion Conference, Elon Musk stated that SpaceX were instead working towards a potential staged cycle engine. In October 2012, SpaceX publicly announced concept work on a rocket engine that would be &quot;several times as powerful as the Merlin 1 series of engines, and won&#x27;t use Merlin&#x27;s RP-1 fuel&quot;. They indicated that the large engine was intended for a new SpaceX rocket, using multiple of these large engines could notionally launch payload masses of the order of to low-Earth orbit. The forthcoming engine currently under development by SpaceX has been named &quot;Raptor&quot;. Raptor will use liquid methane as a fuel, and was stated as having a sea-level thrust of . Since the initial announcement of Raptor, Musk has updated the specification to approximately —about one-third the original published figure—based on the results of optimizing for thrust-to-weight ratio.

<doc id="840612" wikidata="Q746783" url="?curid=840612" title="Atticism">
<text>Atticism (meaning &quot;favouring Attica&quot;, the region of Athens in Greece) was a rhetorical movement that began in the first quarter of the 1st century BC; it may also refer to the wordings and phrasings typical of this movement, in contrast with various contemporary forms of Koine Greek (both literary and vulgar), which continued to evolve in directions guided by the common usages of Hellenistic Greek.

Atticism was portrayed as a return to Classical methods after what was perceived as the pretentious style of the Hellenistic, Sophist rhetoric and called for a return to the approaches of the Attic orators.

Although the plainer language of Atticism eventually became as belabored and ornate as the perorations it sought to replace, its original simplicity meant that it remained universally comprehensible throughout the Greek world. This helped maintain vital cultural links across the Mediterranean and beyond. Admired and popularly imitated writers such as Lucian also adopted Atticism, so that the style survived until the Renaissance, when it was taken up by non-Greek students of Byzantine immigrants. Renaissance scholarship, the basis of modern scholarship in the west, nurtured strong Classical and Attic views, continuing Atticism for another four centuries.

Represented at its height by rhetoricians such as Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and grammarians such as Herodian and Phrynichus Arabius at Alexandria, this tendency prevailed from the 1st century BC onward, and with the force of an ecclesiastical dogma controlled all subsequent Greek culture, even so that the living form of the Greek language, even then being transformed into modern Greek much later, was quite obscured and only occasionally found expression, chiefly in private documents, though also in popular literature.

However, there were literary writers such as Strabo, Plutarch, and Josephus who intentionally withdrew from this way of expression (classical Greek) in favor of the common form of Greek.

<text>Nicholas Chamberlaine (1632 – 14 July 1715) was a priest in the Church of England who was known for his charitable donations.

==Biography==
Nicholas Chamberlaine was born in 1632 in Whitnash, south of Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, England. His family were the Chamberlaines of Astley, Warwickshire. In 1662 he was appointed vicar of Leek Wootton near Warwick and he married Elizabeth Green, but she died afterwards. In February 1664 he moved to Bedworth to become the rector. He remained rector for 51 years until his death, and he helped to establish stability in the area after the English Civil War. Chamberlaine bought land in Bedworth and became the parish squire. He died 14 July 1715.

==Legacy==
Chamberlaine&#x27;s will provided for a local school for boys and a school for girls in the same building, for local almshouses for poor people from the Church of England, for apprenticeships for poor children, and for a number of other provisions. In Bedworth the &quot;Nicholas Chamberlaine Almshouses&quot; and &quot;Nicholas Chamberlaine School&quot; are named after him.

<doc id="840617" wikidata="Q3059255" url="?curid=840617" title="Greek water deities">
<text>The ancient Greeks had numerous water deities. The philosopher Plato once remarked that the Greek people were like frogs sitting around a pond—their many cities hugging close to the Mediterranean coastline from the Hellenic homeland to Asia Minor, Libya, Sicily, and southern Italy. Thus, they venerated a rich variety of water divinities. The range of Greek water deities of the classical era range from primordial powers and an Olympian on the one hand, to heroized mortals, chthonic nymphs, trickster-figures, and monsters on the other.

==Types==

===Primordial powers===
Oceanus and Tethys are the father and mother of the gods in the &quot;Iliad&quot; while in the seventh century BC the Spartan poet Alcman made the nereid Thetis a demiurge-figure. Orpheus&#x27;s song in Book I of the &quot;Argonautica&quot; hymns Eurynome, a daughter of Oceanus, as first queen of the gods and as wife of Ophion, first king of the gods.

The pre-Socratic cosmogony of Thales, who made water the first element, may be seen as a natural outgrowth of this poetic thinking.

The primacy of water gods is reminiscent of, and may even have been influenced by, ancient Near Eastern mythology - where Tiamat (salt water) and Apsu (fresh water) are the first gods of the Enuma Elish, and where the Spirit of God is said to have &quot;hovered over the waters&quot; in Genesis.

Pontus is the primordial deity of the sea.

===Poseidon===
Poseidon, as god of the sea, was an important Olympian power; he was the chief patron of Corinth, many cities of Magna Graecia, and also of Plato&#x27;s legendary Atlantis. He controls the oceans and the seas, and he also created horses. As such, he was intimately connected with the pre-historic office of king - whose chief emblem of power and primary sacrificial animal was the horse. Thus, on the Mycenean Linear B tablets found at Pylos, the name Poseidon occurs frequently in connection with the &quot;wanax&quot; (&quot;king&quot;), whose power and wealth were increasingly maritime rather than equestrian in nature. Surprisingly, Poseidon&#x27;s name is found with greater frequency than that of Zeus, and is commonly linked (often in a secondary role) with Demeter. Poseidon is a brother of Zeus along with Hades and his father was Cronus, the leader of the Titans.

When the office of &quot;wanax&quot; disappeared during the Greek Dark Ages, the link between Poseidon and the kingship was largely, although not entirely, forgotten. In classical Athens, Poseidon was remembered as both the opponent and doublet of Erechtheus, the first king of Athens. Erechtheus was given a hero-cult at his tomb under the title &quot;Poseidon Erechtheus&quot;.

In another possible echo of this archaic association, the chief ritual of Atlantis, according to Plato&#x27;s &quot;Critias&quot;, was a nocturnal horse-sacrifice offered to Poseidon by the kings of the mythical island power.

In keeping with the mythic equation between horsemanship and seamanship, the equestrian heroes Castor and Pollux were invoked by sailors against shipwreck. Ancient Greeks interpreted the phenomenon now called St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire as the visible presence of the two brothers.

===Old men and nymphs===

Several types of water deities conform to a single type: that of Homer&#x27;s &quot;halios geron&quot; or Old Man of the Sea: Nereus, Proteus, Glaucus and Phorkys. These water deities are not as powerful as Poseidon, the main god of the oceans and seas. Each is a shape-shifter, a prophet, and the father of either radiantly beautiful nymphs or hideous monsters (or both, in the case of Phorkys). Nymphs and monsters blur, for Hesiod relates that Phorcys was wed to the &quot;beautiful-cheeked&quot; Ceto, whose name is merely the feminine of the monstrous Cetus, to whom Andromeda was due to be sacrificed. Each appearance in myth tends to emphasize a different aspect of the archetype: Proteus and Nereus as shape-shifters and tricksters, Phorcys as a father of monsters, Nereus and Glaucus for truth-telling, Nereus for the beauty of his daughters.

Each one of these Old Men is the father or grandfather of many nymphs and/or monsters, who often bear names that are either metaphorical (&quot;Thetis&quot;, &quot;establishment&quot;; &quot;Telesto&quot;, &quot;success&quot;) or geographical (&quot;Rhode&quot; from &quot;Rhodes&quot;; &quot;Nilos&quot;, &quot;Nile&quot;). Each cluster of Old Man and daughters is therefore a kind of pantheon in miniature, each one a different possible configuration of the spiritual, moral and physical world writ small – and writ around the sea.

The tantalizing figure of the halios geron has been a favorite of scholarship. The Old Men have been seen as everything from survivals of old Aegean gods who presided over the waves before Poseidon (Kerenyi) to embodiments of archaic speculation on the relation of truth to cunning intelligence (Detienne).

Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; contains a haunting description of a cave of the Nereids on Ithaca, close by a harbor sacred to Phorcys. The Neoplatonist philosopher Porphyry read this passage as an allegory of the whole universe – and he may not have been far off the mark.

==Otherworld and craft==

Thus Cape Tanaerum, the point at which mainland Greece juts most sharply into the Mediterranean, was at once an important sailor&#x27;s landmark, a shrine of Poseidon, and the point at which Orpheus and Heracles were said to have entered Hades.

This motif is apparent in the paradoxical festivals of the shadowy sea-deity Leucothea (&quot;white goddess&quot;), celebrated in many cities throughout the Greek world. Identifying her with the drowned heroine Ino, worshippers would offer sacrifice while engaged in frenzied mourning. The philosopher Xenophanes once remarked that if Leucothea were a goddess, one should not lament her; if she were mortal, one should not sacrifice to her.

At the same time, man&#x27;s (always partial) mastery over the dangerous sea was one of the most potent marks of human skill and achievement. This theme is exemplified in the second choral ode of Sophocles&#x27;s &quot;Antigone&quot;:

:Wonders are many, and none is more wonderful than man. This power spans the sea, even when it surges white before the gales of the south-wind, and makes a path under swells that threaten to engulf him. (lines 332-338)

Certain water divinities are thus intimately bound up with the practice of human skill. The Telchines, for example, were a class of half-human, half-fish or dolphin water daemons said to have been the first inhabitants of Rhodes. These beings were at once revered for their metalwork and reviled for their death-dealing power of the evil eye. In Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, the imprisoned craftsman is aided by the daughters of Ocean; and Hephaestus had his forge on &quot;sea-girt Lemnos&quot;.

The nexus of sea, otherworld and craft is most strikingly embodied in the Cabeiri of Samothrace, who simultaneously oversaw salvation from shipwreck, metalcraft, and mystery-rites.

==Literature==
In Homer&#x27;s heavily maritime &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Poseidon rather than Zeus is the primary mover of events.

Although the sea-nymph Thetis appears only at the beginning and end of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, being absent for much of the middle, she is a surprisingly powerful and nearly omniscient figure when she is present. She is easily able to sway the will of Zeus, and to turn all the forges of Hephaestus to her purposes. Her prophecy of Achilles&#x27; fate bespeaks a degree of foreknowledge not available to most other gods in the epic.

==Art==

In classical art the fish-tailed merman with coiling tail was a popular subject, usually portrayed writhing in the wrestling grasp of Heracles. A similar wrestling scene shows Peleus and Thetis, often accompanied by a host of small animal icons representing her metamorphoses.

In Hellenistic art, the theme of the &quot;marine thiasos&quot; or &quot;assembly of sea-gods&quot; became a favorite of sculptors, allowing them to show off their skill in depicting flowing movement and aquiline grace in a way that land-based subjects did not.

In Roman times with the construction of bath houses throughout the empire, mosaic art achieved primacy in the depiction of water deities. Foremost of these were scenes of the Triumph of Poseidon (or Neptune), riding in a chariot drawn by Hippocamps and attended by a host of water deities and fish-tailed beasts. Large mosaic scenes also portrayed rows of sea-gods and nymphs arranged in a coiling procession of intertwined fish-tails. Other scenes show the birth of Aphrodite, often raised in a conch shell by a pair of sea centaurs, and accompanied by fishing Erotes (winged love gods). It was in this medium that most of the obscure maritime gods of Homer and Hesiod finally received standardised representation and attributes.

<text>Omara Portuondo Peláez (born 29 October 1930) is a Cuban singer and dancer. A founding member of the popular vocal group Cuarteto d&#x27;Aida, Portuondo has collaborated with many important Cuban musicians during her long career, including Julio Gutiérrez, Juanito Márquez and Chucho Valdés. Although primarily known for her rendition of boleros, she has recorded in a wide range of styles from jazz to son cubano. Since 1996, she has been part of the Buena Vista Social Club project, touring extensively and recording several albums with the ensemble. She won a Latin Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Tropical Album in 2009, a Latin Grammy Award for Best Traditional Tropical Album in 2023, a Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2019, and she received three Grammy Award nominations in 2019 and a nomination in 2024.

==Early life and career==
Born on 29 October 1930 in the Cayo Hueso neighborhood of Havana, Portuondo had three sisters. Her mother, Esperanza Peláez, came from a wealthy family of Spanish ancestry, and had created a scandal by running off with and marrying a black professional baseball player, Bartolo Portuondo. Omara joined the dance group of the Cabaret Tropicana in 1950, following her elder sister, Haydee. She also danced in the &quot;Mulatas de Fuego&quot; in the theatre &quot;Radiocentro&quot;, and in other dance groups. The two sisters also used to sing for family and friends, and they also performed in Havana clubs. In 1947, Portuondo and Haydee joined the &quot;Loquibambia Swing&quot;, a group formed by the blind pianist Frank Emilio Flynn.

From 1952–1953, she sang for the Orquesta Anacaona, and later in 1953 both sisters joined (together with Elena Burke and Moraima Secada) the singing group Cuarteto d&#x27;Aida, formed and directed by pianist Aida Diestro. The group had considerable success, touring the United States, performing with Nat King Cole at the Tropicana, and recording a 1957 album for RCA Victor. In 1958, pianist and composer Julio Gutiérrez invited Portuondo to sing for his ensemble in a series of recordings bridging jazz and Cuban music for the record label Velvet. The result was &quot;Magia Negra&quot;, her debut solo album. Haydee left the Cuarteto d&#x27;Aida in 1961 in order to live in the US, and Omara continued singing with the quartet until 1967.

==1967–present==
In 1967, Portuondo began to focus on her solo career, recording two albums for Areito, &quot;Omara Portuondo&quot; and &quot;Esta es Omara Portuondo&quot;. In the same year she represented Cuba at the Sopot Festival in Poland, singing Juanito Márquez&#x27; &quot;Como un milagro&quot;. Alongside her solo work, in the 1970s she sang with the charanga Orquesta Aragón, and toured with them abroad.

In 1974, she recorded with guitarist Martín Rojas, an album in which she lauds Salvador Allende and the people of Chile a year after the military coup led by General Augusto Pinochet. Among other hits from the album, she sang Carlos Puebla&#x27;s hit &quot;Hasta Siempre, Comandante&quot;, which refers to Ché Guevara. She also recorded &quot;Y que se sepa&quot;, with one of the most successful Cuban bands of the late 20th century, Los Van Van. Later on she performed with Juan Formell, singing Formell&#x27;s song &quot;Tal vez&quot;, a song she recorded later on with Maria Bethania. During the 1970s and 1980s, Portuondo enjoyed success at home and abroad, with tours, albums (including one of her most lauded recordings in 1984 with Adalberto Álvarez), film roles, and her own television series.

In 2004, the International Red Cross appointed her International Ambassador, the first Cuban musician to hold this title, in Montreal, Canada. In 2007, she performed the title role to sold-out audiences in Lizt Alfonso&#x27;s dance musical &quot;Vida&quot;, the story of modern Cuba through the eyes and with the memories of an old woman. In this same year, her performance at the Montreal Jazz Festival was released on DVD. She recorded in 2008 a duet album with Brazilian singer Maria Bethânia named &quot;Maria Bethânia e Omara Portuondo&quot;. In 2008, she recorded the album &quot;Gracias&quot; as a tribute to the 60th anniversary of her singing career. Today, Omara lives in a high-rise apartment just off the Malecón, Havana, overlooking the sea. She remains a popular fixture on the local music scene, singing regularly at the Tropicana Club, the Delirio Habanero and the Café Cantante.

===Buena Vista Social Club===
Portuondo sang (duetting with Ibrahim Ferrer) on the album &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot; in 1996. This led not only to more touring (including playing at Carnegie Hall with the Buena Vista troupe) and her appearance in Wim Wenders&#x27; film &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot;, but to two further albums for the World Circuit label: &quot;Buena Vista Social Club Presents Omara Portuondo&quot; (2000) and &quot;Flor de Amor&quot; (2004). She remains a member of Buena Vista Social Club, being the only original vocalist to do so.

<doc id="840626" wikidata="Q3186048" url="?curid=840626" title="Josiah Wedgwood II">
<text>Josiah Wedgwood II (3 April 1769 – 12 July 1843), the son of the English potter Josiah Wedgwood, continued his father&#x27;s firm and was a Member of Parliament (MP) for Stoke-upon-Trent from 1832 to 1835. He was an abolitionist, and detested slavery.

Josiah and his brother Thomas gave their friend Samuel Taylor Coleridge a life annuity of £150, with the goal of freeing Coleridge from financial worries and the need to support himself by noncreative work, so that he could pursue his literary and philosophical interests. This was offered in January 1798, and accepted by Coleridge, who was then a probationary minister in the Unitarian Church, with the condition he discontinued in the ministry.

In 1807, Wedgwood bought Maer Hall in Staffordshire and his family lived there until his death in 1843.

Wedgwood was responsible for the Wedgwood Company&#x27;s first bone china wares.

Wedgwood married Elizabeth Allen (1764–1846) and they had four sons and five daughters, two of whom married their first cousins, the offspring of Robert Darwin and Susannah Wedgwood:

* Sarah Elizabeth Wedgwood (1793–1880)
* Josiah Wedgwood III (1795–1880); married his cousin Caroline Darwin, sister of Charles Darwin.
* Mary Anne Wedgwood (1796–1798) died as an infant.
* Charlotte Wedgwood (1797–1862); married Charles Langton (1801–1886) in 1832. After her death Charles Langton remarried her cousin Emily Catherine Darwin, daughter of Robert Darwin, sister of Charles Darwin.
* Henry Allen Wedgwood (1799–1885) married secondly his cousin Jessie Wedgwood, daughter of John Wedgwood (1766–1844).
* Francis &quot;Frank&quot; Wedgwood (1800–1888)
* Hensleigh Wedgwood (1803–1891)
* Frances (Fanny) Wedgwood (1806–1832)
* Emma Wedgwood (1808–1896); married her cousin Charles Darwin, son of Robert Darwin.

<doc id="840636" wikidata="Q2353595" url="?curid=840636" title="M-79 (Michigan highway)">
<text>M-79 is an east–west state trunkline highway in the central portion of Lower Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan. The western terminus is about southeast of Hastings at the junction with M-37 and the eastern terminus is in downtown Charlotte at the junction with M-50 and Business Loop Interstate 69 (BL I-69). It passes through Quimby and Nashville, where there is a junction with M-66. The entire highway is undivided surface road. It has no direct access with Interstate 69 (I-69), although a sign for the highway is located on southbound I-69 at exit 61.

The highway was first designated in 1919 between Hastings and Battle Creek. It was later moved to run to Charlotte. A section of M-79 was designated as M-214 in the 1930s. M-214 would later be decommissioned as a highway designation and the M-79 designation was reapplied to the roadway.

==Route description==
M-79 starts south of Hastings at a three-way intersection with M-37 in Hastings Township. The trunkline runs east and parallel to a section of the Thornapple River through wooded terrain that is interspersed with farm fields. South of Thornapple Lake, M-79 angles southeasterly moving from Quimby Road to Scott Road running parallel to the Thornapple River again into the community of Nashville. M-79 meets M-66 and turns south along the latter highway&#x27;s route along Main and Durkee streets through the community. South of town in Maple Grove Township, M-79 separates from M-66 and turns east along Lawrence Road. Outside of Charlotte, M-79 curves southeast to transition to Lawrence Avenue through town. The eastern terminus is at an intersection with Cochran Avenue, which carries BL I-69 and M-50.

==History==
M-79 was formed as a state trunkline by July 1, 1919 along part of its present routing. At the time, it ran between Hastings and Nashville as it does today. From Nashville, the trunkline turned south and west to end at the contemporary M-17 in Battle Creek. By 1927, the southernmost section of M-79 was truncated when M-78 was extended to Battle Creek. In late 1930, the southernmost section was shortened once again as a new M-14 designation replaced M-79 south of Nashville. An eastward extension of M-79 at the same time carries the highway designation to Vermontville.

M-79 was extended easterly to Charlotte in 1934 at the same time that the section of the trunkline between Nashville and Vermontville was redesignated M-214. M-79 was rerouted along Assyria and Lawrence roads at the time to connect the sections of M-79 on either side of M-214. By 1941, M-214 was shortened to a connector route in downtown Nashville running between M-79 and M-66. In 1953, M-79 replaced M-214 and the latter designation was retired from the highway system. The last section of gravel roadway in Eaton County was paved by 1960.

<text>Isaeus ( &quot;Isaios&quot;; fl. early 4th century BC) was one of the ten Attic orators according to the Alexandrian canon. He was a student of Isocrates in Athens, and later taught Demosthenes while working as a &quot;metic&quot; logographer (speechwriter) for others. Only eleven of his speeches survive, with fragments of a twelfth. They are mostly concerned with inheritance, with one on civil rights. Dionysius of Halicarnassus compared his style to Lysias, although Isaeus was more given to employing sophistry.

==Life==
The time of his birth and death is unknown, but all accounts agree in the statement that he flourished () during the period between the Peloponnesian War and the accession of Philip II of Macedon, so that he lived between 420 and 348 BC. He was a son of Diagoras, and was born at Chalcis in Euboea; some sources say he was born in Athens, probably only because he came there at an early age and spent the greater part of his life there.

He was instructed in oratory by Lysias and Isocrates. He was afterwards engaged in writing judicial orations for others, and established a rhetorical school at Athens, in which Demosthenes is said to have been his pupil. The &quot;Suda&quot; states that Isaeus instructed him free of charge, whereas Plutarch relates that he received 10,000 drachmas; and it is further said that Isaeus composed for Demosthenes the speeches against his guardians, or at least assisted him in the composition. All particulars about his life are unknown, and were so even in the time of Dionysius, since Hermippus, who had written an account of the disciples of Isocrates, did not mention Isaeus at all.

==Works==
In antiquity there were 64 orations which bore the name of Isaeus, but only fifty were recognised as genuine by the ancient critics. Of these, only eleven have come down to us; but we possess fragments and the titles of 56 speeches ascribed to him. The eleven extant are all on subjects connected with disputed inheritances; and Isaeus appears to have been particularly well acquainted with the laws relating to inheritance.

Ten of these orations had been known ever since the revival of letters in the Renaissance, and were printed in the collections of Greek orators; but the eleventh, &quot;On Menecles&#x27; legacy&quot; (), was first published in 1785 from a Florentine manuscript by Tyrwhitt, and later by Orelli in 1814. Also, in 1815 Mai discovered and published the greater half of Isaeus&#x27; oration &quot;On Cleonymus&#x27; legacy&quot; ().

Isaeus is also known to have written a manual on speechwriting entitled the &quot;Technē&quot; or &quot;Idiai technai&quot; (, &quot;Personal skills&quot;), which, however, is lost.

List of extant speeches (available at the Perseus Digital Library)

# On The Estate of Cleonymus
# On the Estate of Menecles
# On The Estate Of Pyrrhus
# On the Estate of Nicostratus
# On the Estate of Dicaeogenes
# On the Estate of Philoctemon
# On The Estate of Apollodorus
# On The Estate of Ciron
# On the Estate of Astyphilus
# On The Estate Of Aristarchus
# On the Estate of Hagnias
# On Behalf of Euphiletus

==Oratorical style==
Although his orations were placed fifth in the Alexandrian canon, still we do not hear of any of the grammarians having written commentaries on him, except Didymus of Alexandria. But we still possess the criticism upon Isaeus written by Dionysius of Halicarnassus; and by a comparison of the orations still extant with the opinions of Dionysius, we come to the following conclusion.

The oratory of Isaeus resembles in many points that of his teacher, Lysias: the style of both is pure, clear, and concise; but while Lysias is at the same time simple and graceful, Isaeus evidently strives to attain a higher degree of polish and refinement, without, however, in the least injuring the powerful and impressive character of his oratory. The same spirit is visible in the manner in which he handles his subjects, especially in their skillful division, and in the artful manner in which he interweaves his arguments with various parts of the exposition, whereby his orations become like a painting in which light and shade are distributed with a distinct view to produce certain effects. It was mainly owing to this mode of management that he was envied and censured by his contemporaries, as if he had tried to deceive and misguide his hearers. He was one of the first who turned their attention to a scientific cultivation of political oratory; but excellence in this department of the art was not attained until the time of Demosthenes.

<text>This article addresses torts in United States law. As such, it covers primarily common law. Moreover, it provides general rules, as individual states all have separate civil codes. There are three general categories of torts: intentional torts, negligence, and strict liability torts.

==Intentional torts==
Intentional torts involve situations in which the defendant desires or knows to a substantial certainty that his act will cause the plaintiff damage. They include battery, assault, false imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress (&quot;IIED&quot;), trespass to land, trespass to chattels, conversion, invasion of privacy, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, fraud, inducing breach of contract, intentional interference with business relations, and defamation of character (libel/slander).

===Elements===
The elements of most intentional torts follow the same pattern: intent, act, result, and causation.

====Intent====
This element typically requires the defendant to desire or know to a substantial certainty that something will occur as a result of his act. Therefore, the term intent, for purposes of this section, always includes either desire or knowledge to a substantial certainty.

For an example in battery, Dave shoots a gun into a crowd of people because he is specifically trying to hit someone with a bullet. This element would be satisfied, as David had an actual desire to procure the harm required for this tort. Alternatively, Dave shoots a gun into a crowd of people for some reason and genuinely hopes no one gets hit but knows that it is virtually inevitable that someone will actually get hit. This element would still be satisfied, as David had knowledge to a substantial certainty that harm would result.

In contrast, if all that can be said about the defendant&#x27;s state of mind is that he &quot;should have&quot; known better, he will not be liable for an intentional tort. This situation might occur if, as opposed to the examples above, Dave shoots a gun in a remote part of the desert without looking just for fun, not wanting to hit anyone, but the bullet does hit someone. Dave did not have a desire or knowledge to a substantial certainty that someone would get hit in this situation. He may, however, be liable for some other tort, namely negligence.

=====Transferred intent=====
Transferred intent is the legal principle that intent can be transferred from one victim or tort to another. [1] In tort law, there are generally five areas in which transferred intent is applicable: battery, assault, false imprisonment, trespass to land, and trespass to chattels. Generally, any intent to cause any one of these five torts which results in the completion of any of the five tortious acts will be considered an intentional act, even if the actual target of the tort is one other than the intended target of the original tort.

====Act====
The element of an act varies by whatever tort is in question but always requires voluntariness. For example, if Dave has a muscle spasm that makes his arm fling out to his side and hit Paula, who is standing next to him, any case that Paula attempts to bring against Dave for battery will fail for lack of the requisite act (which will be discussed in the section on battery, below). The act was not voluntary.

====Result====
This element typically refers to damage, although damage is not required to prevail on certain intentional torts, such as trespass to land.

====Causation====
This element refers to actual cause and proximate cause. It will be treated in its own section.

===Causes of action===

====Battery====
A person commits a battery when he acts either intending to cause a harmful or offensive contact with another or intending to cause another imminent apprehension of such contact and when such contact results. Therefore, there is a variety of ways in which a person can commit a battery, as illustrated by the following examples of defendant Dave and plaintiff Paula.

* Dave acts intending to cause a harmful contact with Paula, and a harmful contact does result.
* Dave acts intending to cause a harmful contact with Paula, but an offensive contact results.
* Dave acts intending to cause an offensive contact with Paula, and an offensive contact does result.
* Dave acts intending to cause an offensive contact with Paula, but a harmful contact results.
* Dave acts intending to &quot;only&quot; cause Paula to be imminently apprehensive of a harmful &quot;or&quot; offensive contact, but a harmful contact actually results.
* Dave acts intending to &quot;only&quot; cause Paula to be imminently apprehensive of a harmful &quot;or&quot; offensive contact, but an offensive contact actually results.

Apprehension is a broader term than fear. If a defendant intends to cause the plaintiff to actually fear a harmful contact, for example, it will therefore always suffice as apprehension, but there are other ways to achieve apprehension as well.

====Assault====
Assault is notably similar to battery. Indeed, the elements of intent and act are identical. The only difference is the result. A person commits an assault when he acts either intending to cause a harmful or offensive contact with another or intending to cause another imminent apprehension of such contact and when such imminent apprehension results. Therefore, there is a variety of ways in which a person can commit an assault.

====False imprisonment====
A person commits false imprisonment when he acts intending to confine another and when confinement actually results that the confinee is either aware of or damaged by.

Confinement must typically be within boundaries that the defendant establishes. For example, a person is not confined when he is refused entry to a building, because he is free to leave. In addition, a person is not confined unless the will to leave of an ordinary person in the same situation would be overborne. For example, Dave calls Paula into a room with one door. Dave closes the door and stands in front of it. He tells Paula that if she wants to leave, he will open the door and get out of her way but also threatens to blink twice if she does so. An ordinary person&#x27;s will to leave would not be overborne by Dave&#x27;s threat to blink twice.

No damage is required in false imprisonment, hence the requirement of a result of awareness &quot;or&quot; damage. For example, Dave calls Paula into a room with one door. Dave closes the door and stands in front of it. He tells Paula that if she wants to leave, he will take out a gun and shoot her. (Note that this &quot;would&quot; overcome the will of an ordinary person to leave.) An hour later, Dave changes his mind and leaves the premises. Paula subsequently leaves and is not physically injured at all. Her awareness of confinement is sufficient to satisfy the element of the result in false imprisonment.

Alternatively, Paula is a narcoleptic. She suddenly falls into a deep sleep while feeding the chickens in a barn on Dave&#x27;s farm in a remote area. Not wanting to move her, Dave locks her in the barn from the outside when he needs to go into town, trying to protect her but also knowing that she won&#x27;t be able to leave (or call for help) if she wakes up. While Dave is away, the chickens severely scratch Paula&#x27;s arms, but she does not wake up. Dave returns, unlocks the barn, and successfully wakes up Paula to tend to her wounds. Even though she was unaware of her confinement, she was damaged by it and will have a claim of false imprisonment against Dave.

====Intentional infliction of emotional distress====
A person is liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) when he intentionally &quot;or recklessly&quot; engages in extreme and outrageous conduct that is highly likely to cause &quot;severe&quot; emotional distress.

This is a notable exception to the general rule given above that for almost all intentional torts only desire or knowledge to a substantial certainty will do. IIED also includes recklessness. This still distinguishes it from negligent infliction of emotional distress, though.

Extreme and outrageous conduct refers to the act. Severe emotional distress refers to the result. This is another intentional tort for which no damage is ordinarily required. However, some jurisdictions require the accompaniment of physical effects. In other words, emotional distress will not be deemed to exist in those jurisdictions unless there are physical manifestations, such as vomiting or fainting.

====Trespass to land====
A person commits trespass to land when he wrongfully and intentionally enters, or causes a thing or third person to enter, land owned or occupied by another.

====Trespass to chattel====
A person commits trespass to chattel when he acts either intending to dispossess the rightful possessor of a chattel or intending to use or &quot;intermeddle&quot; with the chattel of another and when dispossession of the chattel for a substantial time results, or damage to the chattel results, or physical injury to the rightful possessor results.

====Conversion====
A person commits conversion when he acts intending to exercise &quot;dominion and control&quot; and when interference with the rightful possessor&#x27;s control results that is so serious that it requires the actor to pay the full value of the chattel to the rightful possessor. An exercise of dominion and control refers to the act. Serious interference refers to the result. Seriousness is determined by the following factors:
* the nature of the act and how long it lasted;
* the nature of the interference and how long it lasted;
* the inconvenience to and expense incurred by the rightful possessor;
* the actor&#x27;s good faith (whether he was trying to help someone, for example);
* when applicable, the mistake by the actor (he took a book that looked just like his own but was actually someone else&#x27;s, for example); and
* when applicable, the damage to the chattel.
The remedy for this cause of action not only requires the defendant to pay the plaintiff the full value of the chattel but also is properly considered a forced sale. The plaintiff must tender the defendant the chattel. Therefore, a plaintiff may not elect to pursue this cause of action but instead trespass to chattel, namely when he wants to keep his chattel despite its potential damage.

===Affirmative defenses===
The following are affirmative defenses to intentional torts.

====Consent====
Consent can be a defense to any intentional tort, although lack of consent is occasionally incorporated into the definition of an intentional tort, such as trespass to land. However, lack of consent is not always an essential element to establish a prima facie case in such situations. Therefore, it is properly treated as an affirmative defense.

====Self-defense====
Self-defense is typically a defense to battery. Similar to self-defense is the defense of others.

====Defense of property====
This is typically a defense to trespass to land or trespass to chattels, as it can refer to realty or personalty.

====Necessity====
Necessity is typically a defense to trespass to land. There are two kinds of necessity, private and public.

=====Private necessity=====
This is a partial privilege. A party who has this privilege is still liable for damage caused. This defense is therefore more important when there is a concomitant issue of whether the opposing party has a valid privilege of defense of property.

The following example is derived from an actual Vermont case from 1908 called Ploof v. Putnam. Paula is sailing on a lake when a violent storm suddenly breaks out. She navigates to the nearest dock and quickly ties up her vessel, not damaging the dock at all. The dock belongs to Dave. Dave attempts to exercise the privilege of defense of property, as Paula would ordinarily be committing a trespass to land in this situation, and unties the vessel. Paula therefore drifts back away from the shore. Her boat is damaged, and she suffers personal injuries, both as a result of the storm.

If Paula had damaged Dave&#x27;s dock, she would be liable for it, even though she has a valid privilege of private necessity. More importantly, Dave is now liable to Paula for the damage to her boat and for her personal injuries. Because of the private necessity, Paula is not considered a trespasser. So, Dave did not in fact have a valid privilege of defense of property.

Ordinarily, for private necessity to be valid, the party attempting to exercise it must not have created the emergency. For example, if Paula intentionally punctures her fuel tank just so she can race over to Dave&#x27;s dock and tie up, she will not have a valid privilege of private necessity. As such, she would be a trespasser, and Dave would have a valid privilege of defense of property.

=====Public necessity=====
This is a complete privilege. A party who has this privilege, typically a public official or governmental entity, is not liable for any damage caused. A famous early case on this privilege involved John W. Geary, the first mayor of San Francisco, who made the decision during a major fire to burn down several private residences to establish a fire break.

==Negligence==
Amongst unintentional torts one finds negligence as being the most common source of common law. Most Americans are under the impression that most people can sue for any type of negligence, but it is untrue in most US jurisdictions (partly because negligence is one of the few torts for which ordinary people can and do obtain liability insurance.) It is a form of extracontractual liability that is based upon a failure to comply with the duty of care of a reasonable person, which failure is the actual cause and proximate cause of damages. That is, but for the tortfeasor&#x27;s act or omission, the damages to the plaintiff would not have been incurred, and the damages were a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the tortious conduct.

Some jurisdictions recognize one or more designations less than actual intentional wrongdoing, but more egregious than mere negligence, such as &quot;wanton&quot;, &quot;reckless&quot; or &quot;despicable&quot; conduct. A finding in those states that a defendant&#x27;s conduct was &quot;wanton,&quot; &quot;reckless&quot; or &quot;despicable&quot;, rather than merely negligent, can be significant because certain defenses, such as contributory negligence, are often unavailable when such conduct is the cause of the damages.

=== Professional rescuer ===

*&quot;MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.&quot;, 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050 (1916) Judge Benjamin N. Cardozo which removed the requirement of privity of contract for duty in negligence actions.
*&quot;Martin v. Herzog&quot;, 228 N Y. 164, 126 N.E. 814 (1920)
*&quot;Tedla v. Ellman&quot;, 280 N.Y. 124, 19 N.E.2d 987, (1939) on negligence &quot;per se&quot;, or the violation of a duty under a statute
*&quot;Seong Sil Kim v. New York City Transit Authority&quot;, duty of care to a person who may have been attempting suicide.

===Breach of duty===
Breach is ordinarily established by showing that the defendant failed to exercise reasonable care. Some courts use the terms ordinary care or prudent care instead. Conduct is typically considered to be unreasonable when the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. Judge Learned Hand famously reduced this to algebraic form in &quot;United States v. Carroll Towing Co.&quot;:
Where formula_1 which means that if the burden of exercising more care is less than the probability of damage or harm multiplied by the severity of the expected loss, and a person fails to undertake the burden, he is not exercising reasonable care and is thus breaching his duty to do so (assuming he has one). In other words, the burden of prevention is less than the probability that the injury will occur multiplied by the gravity of the harm/injury. Under this formula, duty changes as circumstances change—if the cost of prevention increases, then the duty to prevent decreases; if the likelihood of damage or the severity of the potential damage increases, then duty to prevent increases.

There are other ways of establishing breach, as well.

*&quot;United States v. Carroll Towing Co.&quot;, 159 F.2d 169 (2d. Cir. 1947)

====Violation of statute====
This is also known as negligence per se. An incident would not have happened if there was not a breach. Breach can be shown in most jurisdictions if a defendant violates a statute that pertains to safety and the purpose of which is to prevent the result of the case. Note that this is an alternative way to show breach. A violation of statute will not have occurred in every case. Therefore, just because it cannot be shown does not mean that there has been no breach. Even if it is attempted to be shown but fails, there may be other bases of breach.

=====Excuse=====
Occasionally, there is a valid excuse for violating a safety statute, namely when it is safer or arguably safer to violate than to comply with it. This happened in &quot;Tedla v. Ellman&quot;. A statute required pedestrians using roadways to walk against traffic. At the time in question, there was heavy traffic going the opposite direction as the plaintiff. Therefore, the plaintiff would have had to walk past many more vehicles, arguably increasing his chances of being hit. So, the plaintiff walked with traffic on the other side of the road, thus violating the statute. There were far fewer vehicles travelling that direction, but the plaintiff was hit anyway. Even though the purpose of the statute was to prevent precisely the result that occurred, the plaintiff nonetheless prevailed because of a valid excuse for violating the statute, namely that it was probably safer not to comply.

====Violation of custom====
Breach can be shown in most jurisdictions if a defendant violates a custom that is widespread and itself reasonable. For example, where ten percent of a certain industry does a certain thing, it probably will not be considered a custom for purposes of breach in negligence. Alternatively, if 90 percent of a certain industry does a certain thing, but the thing is inherently unsafe, and it is upholding the custom as a cost-saving measure, violation of that custom (doing something safer) will not constitute breach. As with violation of statute, this is an alternative way to show breach. Therefore, just because it cannot be shown, or is attempted to be shown but fails, does not mean that there has been no breach. There may be other ways of showing breach.
*&quot;Trimarco v. Klein&quot;, 56 N.Y.2d 98, 436 N.E.2d 502 (1982), decided that customary conduct is not conclusive (although it is good evidence) of what will be reasonable.

====Res ipsa loquitur====
This is a Latin phrase that means &quot;the thing speaks for itself.&quot; It is a rare alternative basis of breach. Ordinarily, it only applies when the plaintiff has little or limited access to the evidence of negligent conduct. Res ipsa loquitur requires that the defendant have exclusive control over the thing that causes the injury and that the act be one that would not ordinarily occur without negligence. Likely defendant negligence was responsible and plaintiff was not cause.

==Causation==
Causation is typically a bigger issue in negligence cases than intentional torts. However, as mentioned previously, it is an element of any tort. The defendant&#x27;s act must be an actual cause and a proximate cause of the result in a particular cause of action.

===Actual cause===
Actual cause has historically been determined by the &quot;but for&quot; test. If the result would not have occurred but for the defendant&#x27;s act, the act is an actual cause of the result.

Several other tests have been created to supplement this general rule, however, especially to deal with cases in which the plaintiff suffers great harm, yet because multiple acts by multiple defendants, the but for test is unhelpful. This situation occurred in the famous case of &quot;Summers v. Tice&quot;. For example, Dan and Dave both negligently fire their shotguns at Paula. Paula is struck by only one pellet and it is impossible to determine which gun it was fired from. Using the but for test alone, Dan and Dave can both escape liability. Dan can say that but for his own negligence, Paula still might have suffered the same harm. Dave can make the same argument. As a matter of public policy, most courts will nonetheless hold Dan and Dave jointly and severally liable. The act of each defendant is therefore said to be an actual cause, even if this is a fiction.

A similar situation arises when it is impossible to show that the defendant(s) was/were negligent at all. This almost inevitably arises in cases also involving res ipsa loquitor. See Ybarra v. Spangard. For example, making the facts of that case more extreme, Paula goes to the hospital for an appendectomy. She wakes up, and finds her left arm has also been amputated for no apparent reason. (Note that this would implicate multiple issues and other causes of action than negligence.) For purposes of actual cause, unless there is evidence or an admission of negligent conduct, Paula will be unable to show an actual cause. In this situation too, most courts will hold all the defendants that Paula names (possibly everyone on the medical staff that was in the room during her surgery) jointly and severally liable. The act of each defendant is likewise said to be an actual cause, even if this is a fiction.

====Substantial factor test====
Another test deals with cases in which there are two actual causes but only one is negligent. For example, there are three equidistant points, A, B, and C. Paula&#x27;s house is at point A. Dave negligently ignites a fire at point B. Lightning simultaneously strikes point C, starting a second fire. The fire at point B and the fire at point C both burn towards point A. Paula&#x27;s house burns down. Unlike &quot;Summers v. Tice&quot;, there is only one defendant in this situation. Most courts will still hold Dave&#x27;s negligence to be an actual cause, as his conduct was a &quot;substantial factor&quot; in causing Paula&#x27;s damage. This is sometimes called the substantial factor test.

* &quot;Summers v. Tice&quot;, 33 Cal. 2d 80 (1948)
* &quot;Ybarra v. Spangard&quot;, 25 Cal. 2d 486 (1944)

===Proximate cause===
There are many tests for determining whether an actual cause is a proximate one. Most involve some form of foreseeability.

Justice Cardozo has two factors to determine if there was a proximate cause between the plaintiff&#x27;s injury and the defendant&#x27;s breach of duty:
# Is the plaintiff&#x27;s injury a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendant&#x27;s breach of duty?
# Is the plaintiff a reasonably foreseeable victim of the defendant&#x27;s breach of duty?

Justice Andrews has several factors to determine if there was a proximate cause between the plaintiff&#x27;s injury and the defendant&#x27;s breach of duty:
# Was there a natural and continuous sequence between the plaintiff&#x27;s injury and the defendant&#x27;s breach of duty?
# Was the injury caused directly or indirectly?
# Based on human experience, would people expect the result to happen?
# Was the result too remote in time and/or place in light of the circumstances?
# Were there intervening causes? Were the intervening causes ones people would expect or were they so unusual (i.e., superseding causes) as to break the chain of causation?

*&quot;Ultramares Corporation v. Touche&quot;, 174 N.E. 441 (1931), on proximate cause in negligent misstatement cases

==Other causes of action==

===Negligent infliction of emotional distress===
*&quot;Miller v. National Broadcasting Co.&quot; 232 Cal. Rptr 688 (1986)
*&quot;Dillon v. Legg&quot;, &#x27;68 Cal. 2d 728 (1968)
*&quot;Thing v. LaChusa&quot; 48 Cal. 3d 644, 666-667 (1989).

===Medical malpractice===
*&quot;Ewing v. Goldstein&quot;
*&quot;Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California&quot;
*&quot;Schloendorff v. Society of New York Hospital&quot;, 211 N.Y. 125, 105 N.E. 92 (1914), the principle of informed consent before operations
*&quot;Jablonski by Pahls v. United States&quot;, 712 F.2d 391 (9th Cir. 1983)

=== Interspousal Tort Suits ===
Historically at common law, spouses were not allowed to sue one another at all. Initially, this was due to the doctrine of coverture. Even after this legal doctrine was abandoned with the adoption of the Married Women&#x27;s Property Acts, many courts disallowed lawsuits between spouses other than divorce or criminal proceedings for the fear that it would disrupt marital harmony. 

From the 1860s until 1913, courts completely rejected the notion of interspousal liability. Then, in 1914, one woman was allowed to bring a civil suit against her husband for assault and false imprisonment. Between 1914 and 1920, there were seven state supreme courts that allowed spouses to sue one another for claims such as assault and battery, wrongful imprisonment, wrongful death, and infliction of venereal disease. However, recognition of spouses&#x27; ability to sue one another stalled around 1921. Scholars suggest this change in direction is due to the rise of tort suits arising out of automobile accidents. Courts declined to extend spouses the ability to sue each another after car accidents for fear of collusion and insurance fraud. This fear stems from the fact that both sides of a negligent car accident suit between spouses want the injured party to recover. Courts then blurred the lines between willful and negligent tort suits to disallow any interspousal tort suits. This argument contrasts the popular narrative that patriarchal restrictions were responsible for interspousal immunity from suit.

==Public authorities==

*Dolan v. United States Postal Service, post office immune under the Federal Tort Claims Act
*Feres v. United States, 340 U.S. 135 (1950), US immune from suit from members of the military
*Warren v. District of Columbia, 444 A.2d. 1, D.C. Ct. of Ap. (1981) holding that the police were not responsible for failing (though repeatedly warned) to respond to calls and arrest people committing crimes

==Damages==

;Joint liability
*&quot;Walt Disney World Co. v. Wood&quot;, 489 So. 2d 61 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1986)

;Comparative negligence

*&quot;Li v. Yellow Cab Co.&quot;, 532 P.2d 1226, 13 Cal.3d 804 (1975),

;Punitive damages
Punitive damages (sums intended to punish the defendant) may be awarded in addition to actual damages intended to compensate the plaintiff. Punitive damage awards generally require a higher showing than mere negligence, but lower than intention. For instance, grossly negligent, reckless, or outrageous conduct may be grounds for an award of punitive damages. These punitive damages awards can be quite substantial in some cases.

*&quot;BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore&quot;, Constitutional limits on punitive damages
*&quot;Liebeck v. McDonald&#x27;s Restaurants&quot;
*&quot;Pearson v. Chung&quot; (2005)

==Strict liability==
Strict liability torts are brought for injuries resulting from ultrahazardous activities, for which the defendant will be held liable even if there was no negligence on his/her part. Strict liability also applies to some types of product liability claims and to copyright infringement and some trademark cases. Some statutory torts are also strict liability, including many environmental torts. The term &quot;strict liability&quot; refers to the fact that the tortfeasor&#x27;s liability is not premised on their culpable state of mind (whether they knew or intended to accomplish the wrongful act, or violated a standard of care by doing so,) but, instead, strictly on the conduct itself or its result.

===Product liability===

==Federal torts==
Although federal courts often hear tort cases arising out of common law or state statutes, there are relatively few tort claims that arise exclusively as a result of federal law. The most common federal tort claim is the 42 U.S.C. § 1983 remedy for violation of one&#x27;s civil rights under color of federal or state law, which can be used to sue for anything from a free speech claim to use of excessive force by the police. Tort claims arising out of injuries occurring on vessels on navigable waters of the United States fall under federal admiralty jurisdiction.

<text>The Australian Museum, originally known as the Colonial Museum or Sydney Museum. is a heritage-listed museum at 1 William Street, Sydney CBD, New South Wales. It is the oldest natural history museum in Australia and the fifth oldest natural history museum in the world, with an international reputation in the fields of natural history and anthropology.

It was first conceived and developed along the contemporary European model of an encyclopedic warehouse of cultural and natural history, and features collections of vertebrate and invertebrate zoology, as well as mineralogy, palaeontology and anthropology. The scientific stature of the museum was established under the curatorship of scientist Gerard Krefft in the 1860s. 

Apart from permanent displays in its galleries, permanent and temporary exhibitions, the museum also undertakes research and is involved in community programs. Since 1973 it has operated the Lizard Island Research Station on the Great Barrier Reef, studying the ecology of coral reefs and the effects of climate change. The Australian Museum Research Institute (AMRI), established in 2013, is the central hub for its researchers in Sydney. the CEO and executive director is Kim McKay , who was the first woman to be appointed to the position in 2014.

==History==
===Establishment===
The establishment of a museum had first been planned in 1821 by the Philosophical Society of Australasia, and although specimens were collected, the Society folded in 1822. An entomologist and fellow of the Linnean Society of London, Alexander Macleay, arrived in 1826. After being appointed New South Wales Colonial Secretary, he began lobbying for a museum.

The museum was founded in 1827 by Earl Bathurst, then the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who wrote to the Governor of New South Wales of his intention to found a public museum and who provided yearly towards its upkeep. Its foundation in 1827 makes the museum the oldest natural history museum in the country, the fifth oldest in the world.

It was first conceived and developed along the contemporary European model of an encyclopedic warehouse of cultural and natural history, and features collections of vertebrate and invertebrate zoology, as well as mineralogy, palaeontology and anthropology. In the museum&#x27;s early years, collecting was its main priority, and specimens were commonly traded with British and other European institutions. 

In 1832 George Bennett, curator of the Australian Museum, explained the role of the museum: 

From a &quot;beautiful Collection of Australian curiosities&quot;, the Museum has grown to an internationally recognised collection of over 21 million cultural and scientific objects. The Museum plays a leading role in taxonomic and systematic research, and at its research station at Lizard Island conducts significant research on coral reef ecology. Through exhibitions and other public programs the Australian Museum continues to inform and amaze generations of visitors about the unique flora, fauna and cultures of Australia and the Pacific.

===Administration===
The first custodian of the museum was William Holmes, appointed on 16 June 1829 and holding the position until 1835. In August 1831, Holmes accidentally shot himself while collecting specimens at Moreton Bay.

The museum was originally known as the Colonial Museum or Sydney Museum. It was administered directly by the colonial government until June 1836, until the establishment of a Committee of Superintendence of the Australian Museum and Botanical Garden. Sub-committees were established for each institution. Members of these committees were generally the leading members of the political and scientific classes of Sydney; and scions of the Macleay served until 1853, at which point the committee was abolished. In that year, the government enacted the &quot;Australian Museum Act&quot;, thereby incorporating it and establishing a board of trustees consisting of 24 members. William Sharp Macleay, the former committee chairman, continued to serve as the chairman of this committee. The museum was renamed in June 1836 by a sub-committee meeting, when it was resolved during an argument that it should be renamed the &quot;Australian Museum&quot;. 

The scientific stature of the museum was established under the curatorship of Gerard Krefft (1861-1874), himself a published scientist.

===20th century===
After a run of field collecting activities by the scientific staff in the 1880s and 1890s, field work ceased until after the First World War. In the 1920s, new expeditions were launched to New Guinea, the Kermadec Islands and Santa Cruz in the Solomon Islands, as well as to many parts of Australia, including the Capricorn Islands off the coast of Queensland.

During the 19th century, galleries had mainly included large display cases overly filled with specimens and artefacts. During the 1920s, museum displays grew to include dioramas showing habitat groups, but otherwise the Museum was largely unchanged during the period beginning with the curatorship of Robert Etheridge Jr (1895–1919), until the appointment of John Evans in 1954, when under his direction, additional buildings were built, several galleries were overhauled, and a new Exhibitions department was created. The size of the education staff was also radically increased. By the end of the 1950s, all of the galleries had been completely overhauled.

The museum&#x27;s growth in the field of scientific research continued with a new department of environmental studies, created in 1968 by director Frank Talbot. Research on the Great Barrier Reef began in 1965, with the One Tree Island Research Station established at the southern end(now operated by the University of Sydney). (around 1965 The museum support society, The Australian Museum Society (TAMS), now known as Australian Museum Members) was formed in 1972, and in 1973 the Lizard Island Research Station (LIRS), was established near Cairns, both under the leadership of Talbot.

The Australian Museum Train, an early outreach project, was officially launched on 8 March 1978. The train was described as &quot;a wonderful new concept of the travelling circus! The only difference is that the travelling Museum Train will bring school children and the people of NSW into contact with the wonders of nature, evolution and Wildlife.&quot; The two-carriage train was renovated and refurbished at Eveleigh Carriage Workshops, and fitted out with exhibits by the Australian Museum at a cost of about $100,000. One carriage displayed the evolution of the earth, animals and man. The second carriage was a lecture and visual display area. The train ceased operations in December 1988 but the museum&#x27;s outreach work in regional communities continues.

In 1991, the museum established a commercial consulting and project management group, the Australian Museum Business Services (AMBS), now known as Australian Museum Consulting. In 1995, the museum established new research centres in conservation, biodiversity, evolutionary research, geodiversity and &quot;People and Places&quot;. These research centres have now been incorporated into the museum&#x27;s natural science collection programs. In 1998, the djamu gallery opened at Customs House, Circular Quay, the first major new venue for the museum beyond College Street site. A series of exhibitions on Indigenous culture were displayed until the gallery closed at the end of 2000.

===21st century===
In 2001, two rural associate museums were established, The Age of Fishes Museum in Canowindra and the Australian Fossil and Mineral Museum in Bathurst which includes the mineral and dinosaur Somerville Collection donated by Warren Somerville.

In 2002, ICAC launched Operation Savoy to investigate thefts of the zoological collections by a museum employee.

In 2011, the museum launched its first Mobile App – &quot;DangerOZ&quot; – about Australia&#x27;s most dangerous animals.

In 2014, Kim McKay was appointed the CEO and executive director, a position she still holds . She is the first woman to hold the position

In 2017, museum researchers reassigned a Tasmanian species of semi-slug from the genus &quot;Helicarion&quot; to &quot;Attenborougharion&quot;, named after the museum&#x27;s Lifetime Patron David Attenborough, hence known as &quot;Attenborougharion rubicundus&quot;.

In December 2023, the Museum became the subject of criticism for its decision to reword an exhibition panel by World Heritage Exhibitions replacing its word &quot;Palestine&quot; with &quot;what is today known as Libya and Palestine&quot;, after the Australian Jewish Association had accused the museum of &quot;inaccurate use of the word &#x27;Palestine&#x27; in an exhibit on Ancient Egypt&quot;. The Australian Palestine Advocacy Network and the Australian Friends of Palestine Association issued strong criticism of &quot;the ideological expunging of cultural identity from history&quot;. On 3 January 2024, the World Heritage Exhibitions announced that it had no plans to change the text, as there was no intention &quot;to convey any political assertions&quot;.

==Building==
===Move to current site===
The first location of the museum in 1827 was probably a room in the offices of the Colonial Secretary, although over the following thirty years it had several other locations in Sydney, until it moved into its current home in 1849. Its location is at the corner of William Street and College Street in the Sydney central business district, in the City of Sydney LGA. 

The heritage-listed building has evolved to encompass a range of different architectural styles and when its building expanded, it was often in conjunction with an expansion of the collections.

The Long Gallery is part of the wing designed by New South Wales Colonial Architect Mortimer Lewis, and the earliest building on the site, . This is a handsome building of Sydney sandstone in the Greek Revival style on the corner of College and William Streets, opposite Hyde Park, designed by the Colonial Architect James Barnet, and it was first opened to the public in May 1857.

In order to accommodate the expanding collections of the museum, Barnet was responsible for the construction of the neoclassical west wing along William Street in 1868. A third storey was added to the north Lewis wing in 1890, bringing cohesion to the building design.
===20th century===


In 1963, the floor space of the museum almost doubled when Joseph van der Steen under the Government Architect, Edward Farmer, designed a six-story extension linked to the Lewis building for the scientific and research collections, the reference library and a public restaurant. There were also two basement floors providing workspace for scientific staff. This International Style extension became known as the Parkes/Farmer eastern wing. In 1977, to mark the Museum&#x27;s 150th anniversary, bronze lower case letters were added to the façade identifying the building as &quot;The Australian Museum&quot;.

===21st century===
In 2008, a significant expansion took place on the College Street site with the addition of the new Collection and Research building which added 5000 square metres of office, laboratory and storage areas for scientists.

In 2015, the museum&#x27;s carbon-neutral glass box entryway known as the &quot;Crystal Hall&quot; was opened. Designed by Neeson-Murcutt, it returned the entry to William Street and provided access via a suspended walkway. In December 2016, the Museum made public a $285 million master plan proposing to greatly expand its available exhibition space, by adding a 13-storey building on the block&#x27;s east, adding a large central glazed atrium space.

At the end of 2020, after being closed for 15 months, the 200-year-old museum reopened following a major $57.5 million upgrade. Subsequent to its refurbishment, museum entry is free for the public. The expansion included the new Hintze Hall, shop, café, members lounge, and education rooms, along with a expanded exhibition area for temporary exhibitions.

=== Heritage listing ===
Australian Museum building and its collection was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

The Australian Museum buildings house the first public museum inaugurated in Australia, one of Australia&#x27;s oldest scientific and cultural institutions. Conceived and developed initially along the contemporary European model of an encyclopedic warehouse of cultural and natural history, the museum buildings evolved as the institution evolved, partly in response to its visiting public, to pursue and expand knowledge of the natural history of Australia and the nearby pacific region. The museum continues to occupy the site provided, and the building constructed, as its first permanent home, commenced in 1846 and opened to the public in 1857. The extended and enlarged complex of buildings which now provide its principal exhibition, administrative and research accommodation reflect the growth of the institution and its prestige, as well as the evolving attitudes of Australian Government and society to science and research.

The Museum&#x27;s various buildings further comprise a unique aggregation of work by successive colonial and Government Architects of New South Wales, exhibiting:
* changes in the philosophy and functional requirements of museum design
* changing stylistic influences and design approaches in architecture from the early 19th century to the present
* corresponding developments in building technology, materials and craftsmanship

Individually the various elements of the Museum complex remain significantly intact, with potential for enhancement of their cultural significance through conservation techniques, though conflicts exist between conservation of fabric and contemporary use, particularly exhibition techniques. Of special note are the exteriors and principal interiors of the three earliest wings of the complex, which despite varying degrees of alteration, remain in substantial original condition. The interlinked exhibition galleries comprise an important group of 19th and early 20th century public interests.

Through its development, the Museum complex has assumed a prominent stature in the townscape of Sydney. With its frontage to William and College Street, the Museum commands the eastern reaches of Hyde Park and forms and extension of the principal historic civic and religious precincts adjoining the northern boundaries of the park in Macquarie and College streets. Through recent expansion the museum site includes the former grounds and two surviving buildings of the William Street National School, which, established in 1851, is one of the earlier public schools continued in educational use for almost 100 years.

==Research==
The museum is also involved in Indigenous studies research and community programs.

=== Lizard Island Research Station ===

The Lizard Island Research Station was established in 1973 on Lizard Island, in the Great Barrier Reef. It continues to be operated by the Australian Museum.

===Australian Museum Research Institute===
In September 2013, the Australian Museum Research Institute (AMRI) was launched at the museum. 

AMRI&#x27;s purposes are:
* to provide a focal point for the many researchers working in the museum 
* to facilitate collaborations with government research agencies, universities, gardens, zoos and other museums 
* to showcase the important scientific research that is being done at the museum, focusing on climate change impacts on biodiversity; the detection and biology of pest species; understanding what constitutes and influences effective biodiversity conservation

It also forms and publishes a science strategy to guide science at the museum.

AMRI&#x27;s staff, numbering around 100, includes research scientists, collection scientists, collection officers. There are also over 130 AMRI associates, fellows, and students, and the institute hosts visiting local and international researchers regularly.

==Other activities==
The museum is also involved in community programs.

===FrogID===
In 2017, the museum began a citizen science project called FrogID to help conserve and document the distribution of frog populations throughout Australia. Each year, participants are encouraged to record frog sounds on the FrogID app. The aggregated data are then analysed to provide a snapshot of the health of frog populations across Australia.

In 2022, the museum&#x27;s FrogID project collaborated with the Bowerbird Collective, Listening Earth, and Mervyn Street of Mangkaja Arts, to produce the album &quot;Australian Frog Calls&quot;. The album is a compilation of frog sounds from both biologist recordings and public submissions, including recordings dating back to the 1970s from FrogID&#x27;s database. The album was released on 2 December 2022, debuted at number 3 on the ARIA Charts, and was nominated for ARIA Award for Best World Music Album at the 2023 ARIA Music Awards.

===Nights at the Museum===
The Australian Museum&#x27;s &quot;Night at the Museum&quot; series, funded by the NSW Government, are sessions held on a weeknight evening at various times of the year. Guests and friends can explore the museum between 5pm and 9pm, free of charge. As part of this, there are also special events held at the museum, including The Talbot Oration and &quot;Ngalu Warrawi Marri&quot; (We Stand Strong), an evening of live music, talks, workshops, and performances celebrating First Nations peoples of Australia. Originally held on Thursday nights, in 2023 the nights were changed to Wednesdays.

====Talbot Oration====
The annual Talbot Oration was founded in honour of former director Frank Talbot in 2021, and is held in June each year. It celebrates his achievements in and commitment to marine research and environmental studies, and the oration is intended &quot;to showcase advances in the field of climate change research and environmental conservation, enabling the public to better understand how responses to the climate challenge determine our future prospects, health, and the sustainability of our natural environment&quot;. International Conservation Services is a supporting partner of the event.

The inaugural Talbot Oration took place on 3 June 2021, and was given by scientist, author, and conservationist Tim Flannery, whose address was titled &quot;The Climate Cure&quot;, reflecting the title of his new book.
Subsequent orations have been given by:
* 2022: Anne Hoggett, co-director of the museum&#x27;s Lizard Island Research Station, titled &quot;Coral Reefs in Hot Water&quot;
* 2023: Rebecca Huntley, author and social researcher, titled &quot;Inspiring Visions for a Climate Solution&quot;
* 2024: Cynthia Houniuhi, president of Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change, who have taken their case to the International Court of Justice, titled &quot;Taking Climate to the World’s Highest Court&quot;; joined by a discussion panel afterwards including Craig Reucassel and Richie Merzian, moderated by Narelda Jacobs

== Permanent galleries ==


The permanent galleries accommodate a large number of display cases containing a variety of animal species, including butterflies, birds, and reptiles, as well as cultural artefacts and art.

In 2008, two permanent galleries were opened, &quot;Dinosaurs&quot; and &quot;Surviving Australia&quot;.

In 2014, the permanent exhibition &quot;Garrigarrang: Sea Country&quot; was opened, displaying objects relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.

When the Crystal Hall was opened as the museum&#x27;s new entrance in August 2015, the former foyer, the Barnet Wing, became the permanent gallery housing &quot;Wild Planet&quot; – a display of over 400 animals that explores and explains evolution and the tree of life.

Jurassic Lounge was established in early 2011 by the Australian Museum and non-profit company The Festivalists, a seasonal display event of contemporary art. Combining events, live music, art, cultural displays, and new media with standard exhibition space in the museum precinct, Jurassic Lounge is a seasonal display-event held on Tuesdays for two seasons annually. Jurassic lounge opened on 1 February 2011. It is held after-hours at the Australian Museum. It allows the public to discover Sydney&#x27;s newest artists, musicians and performers. 2018&#x27;s event included a burlesque show, a silent disco, live painting, a photobooth, interaction with museum animals (snake and stick insects).

In 2022, the permanent minerals gallery was opened.

==Exhibitions==
The museum has hosted various exhibitions since 1854 to the present day, including permanent, temporary, and touring exhibitions, such as &quot;Dinosaurs from China&quot;, &quot;Festival of the Dreaming&quot;, &quot;Beauty from Nature: Art of the Scott Sisters&quot; and &quot;Wildlife Photographer of the Year&quot;.

Some exhibitions were directly curated by the museum and have exhibited internationally, include &quot;Sharks&quot; and &quot;Tyrannosaurs: Meet the Family&quot;.

===Permanent===
In 2017, the permanent exhibition &quot;200 Treasures of the Australian Museum&quot; was reopened as part of the &quot;Westpac Long Gallery&quot;, being Australia&#x27;s first museum gallery, which was previously called the &quot;Long Gallery&quot;. Some of the objects on display include the wooden sled used during Sir Douglas Mawson&#x27;s expedition to Antarctica, an Egyptian mummy, and a feathered cape given to Captain James Cook on his arrival to Hawaii. The expanded gallery also contains the Birds of Australia gallery.

In late 2023, &quot;Wansolmoana&quot; (), a permanent exhibition of hundreds of Pacific cultural objects opened. This replaced the interim &quot;Pacific Spirit&quot; gallery, which opened in 2015 and was stated to be one of the world&#x27;s biggest collections of Pacific artwork at the time.

=== Temporary ===
In 2012, an exhibition called &quot;Sydney Elders&quot; was opened. It consisted of photographs by renowned Aboriginal photographer Mervyn Bishop of a selection of local Elders who have &quot;contributed to the important role of culture, education, health, community or social justice&quot;. The collection is accompanied by an essay written by Djon Mundine, entitled &quot;Growing Old on Eora Country&quot;. Elders whose portraits were included in the collection include Christine Donnelly, founder of the Aboriginal Dance Theatre Redfern; Naomi Mayers , founder of the Aboriginal Health Service; Sol Bellear , member and leader of many Aboriginal organisations; and singer-songwriter Vic Simms; and activists and leaders Dulcie Flower , Paul Coe, and Lyall Munro Jnr.

In 2012–13, the museum hosted &quot;Alexander the Great: 2000 years of treasures&quot; which exhibited a collection of artefacts from the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

In 2014-15, the museum hosted &quot;Aztecs&quot;, a collection of 200 artefacts from around 20 Mexican museums, being the first time an Aztec-themed exhibition was displayed in the Southern Hemisphere.

In 2015, &quot;Trailblazers: Australia&#x27;s 50 greatest explorers&quot; opened, honouring the work of Bourke and Wills, Nancy Bird Walton, Dick Smith, Jessica Watson and Tim Jarvis, among others.

In 2021, &quot;Unsettled&quot;, a temporary exhibition on the colonisation of Australia through Indigenous perspectives, ran from 22 May until 10 October. Including over 80 significant cultural artefacts as well as more than 100 contributions by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people across Australia, the exhibition was curated by Laura McBride and Mariko Smith.

The museum was due to hold &quot;Tutankhamun: The Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh&quot; in 2021, however this was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However in late 2023, the museum was the fourth in the world to open &quot;Ramses &amp; the Gold of the Pharaohs&quot;. It was announced that Ramses&#x27; coffin would also be loaned to the Australian Museum, with Sydney being the second city in the world outside of Egypt to display the artefact.

<text>The Nez Perce Horse is a spotted horse breed of the Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho. The &quot;Nez Perce Horse&quot; Registry (NPHR) program began in 1995 in Lapwai, Idaho and is based on cross-breeding the old-line Appaloosa horses (the Wallowa herd) with an ancient Central Asian breed called Akhal-Teke.

This program seeks to re-establish the horse culture of the Nez Perce, a tradition of selective breeding of Appaloosa horses and horsemanship that was nearly destroyed by the U.S. Government in the 19th century. The breeding program was financed by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the Nez Perce Tribe and a nonprofit group called the First Nations Development Institute, which promotes such businesses.

The &quot;Nez Perce Horse&quot; is &quot;fit to carry the Nez Perce name,&quot; according to Rudy Shebala, director of the Tribe&#x27;s Horse Registry and the Nez Perce Young Horsemen program.

The Akhal-Teke is an ancient breed that originated in Turkmenistan (near Afghanistan). They are known for their superb endurance and &quot;metallic&quot; coats. The Akhal-Teke coat colors commonly include palominos, buckskins, and dark bays. A typical &quot;Nez Perce Horse&quot; is a buckskin or palomino with Appaloosa characteristics—mottled skin with a spotted coat or a blanket.

The &quot;Nez Perce Horse&quot;&#x27;s conformation is longer and leaner than the Quarter Horses or other stock horses of the Western U.S., with narrower shoulders and hindquarters, a longer back, and a lean runner&#x27;s appearance. They are good at long rides and compete well in endurance races; they are also good jumpers. The &quot;Nez Perce Horses&quot; are often gaited, with a fast and smooth running walk.

The Nez Perce people are historically known for their selective horse breeding practices, according to NPHR breeders Jon and Rosa Yearout.

<doc id="840652" wikidata="Q910799" url="?curid=840652" title="Fuller's earth">
<text>Fuller&#x27;s earth is a term for various clays used as an absorbent, filter, or bleaching agent. Products labeled fuller&#x27;s earth typically consist of palygorskite (also known as attapulgite) or bentonite. Primary modern uses include as absorbents for oil, grease, and animal waste (cat litter), and as a carrier for pesticides and fertilizers. Minor uses include filtering, clarifying, and decolorizing; as an active and inactive ingredient in beauty products; and as a filler in paint, plaster, adhesives, and pharmaceuticals. It also has a number of uses in the film industry and on stage.

== Etymology ==
The English name reflects the historical use of the material for fulling (cleaning and shrinking) wool, by textile workers known as &quot;fullers&quot;. In past centuries, fullers kneaded fuller&#x27;s earth and water into woollen cloth to absorb lanolin, oils, and other greasy impurities as part of the cloth finishing process.

The original spelling was without an apostrophe, but the apostrophe became more common in the 19th century, both before or after the &quot;s&quot;. &quot;Fuller&#x27;s earth&quot; is the most common spelling today, but both &quot;fullers earth&quot; and &quot;fullers&#x27; earth&quot; remain in wide use.

Fuller&#x27;s earth is also known by the following other names:

* &quot;Bleaching clay&quot;, probably because fulling whitened the cloth.
* &quot;Whitening clay&quot;, particularly when used to treat facial pigmentation, such as melasma.
* (Hindustani: ; ; ), widely used in the Indian subcontinent in cosmetics. The name comes from the city of Multan, in modern-day Pakistan, the area of its origin.

== Occurrence and composition ==
Fuller&#x27;s earth consists primarily of hydrous aluminum silicates (clay minerals) of varying composition. Common components are montmorillonite, kaolinite, and attapulgite. Small amounts of other minerals may be present in fuller&#x27;s earth deposits, including calcite, dolomite, and quartz. In some localities fuller&#x27;s earth refers to calcium bentonite, which is altered volcanic ash composed mostly of montmorillonite.

In 2005, the United States was the largest producer of fuller&#x27;s earth with an almost 70% world share followed at a distance by Japan and Mexico. In the United States fuller&#x27;s earth is typically derived from deposits of volcanic ash of Cretaceous age and younger (glacial clays do not form fuller&#x27;s earth). Fuller&#x27;s earth deposits have been mined in 24 states. The first discovery of fuller&#x27;s earth in the United States was near Quincy, Florida, in 1893; previously it was imported from England. In 1939 mines near Quincy produced half the U.S. production.

In the United Kingdom, fuller&#x27;s earth occurs mainly in England. It has been mined in the Lower Greensand Group and the Vale of White Horse, Oxfordshire. The Combe Hay Mine was a fuller&#x27;s earth mine operating to the south of Bath, Somerset, until 1979. Other sites south of Bath included Frome, Lonsdale, Englishcombe, Tucking Mill, and Duncorn Hill. Although these sites had been used since Roman times, William Smith developed new methods for the identification of deposits of fuller&#x27;s earth to the south of Bath. Other English sources include a mine near Redhill, Surrey (worked until 2000), and Woburn, Bedfordshire, where production ceased in 2004.

Hills, cliffs, and slopes that contain fuller&#x27;s earth can be unstable, since this material can be thixotropic when saturated by heavy rainfall.

== Historical significance ==
Fulling is an important step in the production of woolen garments, and can be traced back to ancient times. Cuneiform texts from Mesopotamia mention a raw material, (, : &#x27;gypsum, plaster&#x27;), literally &quot;white earth&quot;, which was delivered to fullers for the finishing of cloth. There are several Biblical references to fulling (2 Kings 18:17; Isaiah 7:3 and 36:2; Malachi 3:2; Mark 9:3), but the materials used to whiten the fabric are not specified. Pliny the Elder mentions several types of fuller&#x27;s earth ( in Latin) from a variety of locations, each with different properties and therefore different uses.

The first references to fulling mills are from Persia, and by the time of the Crusades in the late eleventh century, fulling mills were active throughout the medieval world.

The use of fuller&#x27;s earth across the Indian subcontinent dates back to at least 1879. While its household use and transportation by local carts in the Sindh region of Pakistan predates the 1800s, export by rail was first recorded in 1929 in British India.

The value of fuller&#x27;s earth is a plot point in the Sherlock Holmes story &quot;The Adventure of the Engineer&#x27;s Thumb&quot; (1892). In the story, an engineer is paid an outlandish sum to repair a hydraulic press, accepting his client&#x27;s explanation that the potential profit from fuller&#x27;s earth warrants both the expense and total secrecy. The adventure is set in 1889, implying that fuller&#x27;s earth was then well-known as a lucrative commodity, &quot;only found in one or two places in England&quot;.

==Production==
== Uses ==
Fuller&#x27;s earth is utilized in a number of industries. Most important modern applications make use of the minerals&#x27; natural absorbent properties in products sold as absorbents or filters.

* In the fulling of raw fibers, historically, and most importantly, removing the lanolin from sheep&#x27;s wool.
* Treatment for poisoning. Even given the risk of salmonella, the clay content of soil could save the life of a person exposed to paraquat, for example, as paraquat is intended to break down in soil.
* Decontamination: Fuller&#x27;s earth is used by military and civil emergency service personnel to decontaminate the clothing and equipment of servicemen and CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear) responders who have been contaminated with chemical agents.
* Cleaning agent: In the Indian subcontinent, it has been used to clean marble. As a good absorbent, it removes dust, dirt, impurities and stains from the surface and replenishes the shine of marble. It has been used numerous times to clean the Taj Mahal, India.
* Cat litter: Since the late 1940s, fuller&#x27;s earth has been used in commercial cat litter.
* Cosmetology and dermatology: The same properties that make fuller&#x27;s earth effective at removing oils, dirt, and impurities from wool are also effective on human hair and skin.
* In the laboratory, for filtering, decolorizing, absorbing, and mimicking natural sediment (as in experiments simulating the weathering effects of erosion and deposition in geological experiments, and hatching fish eggs).
*Fuller&#x27;s earth has been used extensively for many years in motion pictures for a variety of applications, spanning from make-up, wardrobe, and set dressing, to special effects. In the area of special effects, it is used in pyrotechnics explosions and dust clouds, because it spreads farther and higher than most natural soils, resulting in a blast that looks larger, and is safer than naturally occurring soil should the blast spray hit actors. It was used in the tornado sequence in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; as the artificial twister ploughed its way toward the farmhouse. Fuller&#x27;s earth is also widely used by the make-up, props, wardrobe, and set dresser departments, because it is considered a &quot;clean&quot; dirt, safer to use around people, and it cleans up easily. However, health concerns in this regard have been debated. Fuller&#x27;s earth is available in small quantities by make-up suppliers for use in making the face and body appear dirty. It is used by props technicians to make furniture look dusty. Wardrobe dressers use a small, loose-mesh cloth bag filled with fuller&#x27;s earth to apply it to clothing to make it appear dusty. Set dressers use fuller&#x27;s earth to change paved streets into dirt roads, to create dust trailing from a moving vehicle over a dirt road, or to indicate a vehicle trail over untravelled ground.

<text>Pherusa or Pherousa (Ancient Greek: Φέρουσά means &#x27;the bringer&#x27;) was the name of two female deities in Greek mythology:

* Pherusa, one of the 50 Nereids, marine-nymph daughters of the &#x27;Old Man of the Sea&#x27; Nereus and the Oceanid Doris. Her name, a participle, means &quot;she who carries.&quot; She, along with her sister Dynamene, were associated with the power of great ocean swells. Pherousa and her other sisters appear to Thetis when she cries out in sympathy for the grief of Achilles at the slaying of his friend Patroclus.
* Pherusa, one of the Horae according to Hyginus.

<text>Thomas George Cowling FRS (17 June 1906 – 16 June 1990) was an English astronomer.

==Early life and education==
Cowling was born in Hackney, London, the second of four sons of George Cowling and Edith Eliza Cowling (nee Nicholls). He was educated at Sir George Monoux Grammar School in Walthamstow and read mathematics at Brasenose College, Oxford from 1924 to 1930. From 1928 to 1930 he worked under Edward Arthur Milne. In 1929, Milne had no problems left to ask his student to work on and appealed to Sydney Chapman, who proposed that they work on an article on which he was working that dealt with the Sun&#x27;s magnetic field. Cowling found an error in the paper that invalidated Chapman&#x27;s results. After Cowling&#x27;s doctorate, Chapman proposed that they work together.

==Academic career==
In 1933 Cowling wrote an article, &quot;The magnetic field of sunspots&quot;. Joseph Larmor had worked in this area, arguing that sunspots regenerate themselves through a dynamo effect. Cowling showed that Larmor&#x27;s proposed explanation was incorrect. His article assured him of a good reputation in the field of astrophysics.

During the 1930s, Cowling also worked on stellar structure involving radiation and convection, at the same time as Ludwig Biermann but independently of him. He constructed a model of star with a convective core and radiative envelope, named the Cowling model by Chandrasekhar. He also studied magnetic fields within stars and classified the modes of non-radial oscillation of the body of a star, the basis of the field of helioseismology.

Cowling became an Assistant Lecturer at the University College of Swansea (now Swansea University) in 1933. He was subsequently a Lecturer at the University of Dundee (1937–38) and at the University of Manchester (1938–45) before being appointed Professor of Mathematics at the University College of North Wales (now Bangor University). In 1948 Cowling was appointed Professor of Applied Mathematics at the University of Leeds in succession to Professor Selig Brodetsky. Cowling retired from his chair at Leeds in 1970 with the title Emeritus Professor.

==Honours==
Cowling was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in March 1947. He won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1956 and the Bruce Medal of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific in 1985. He was elected president of the Royal Astronomical Society from 1965 to 1967. He was also awarded the Hughes Medal two days before his death.

==Marriage and children==
Cowling married Doris Marjorie Moffatt in 1935. They had a son and two daughters.

==Death==
Cowling died in Leeds on 16 June 1990, one day before his 84th birthday. He was survived by his wife and children.

<doc id="840664" wikidata="Q1922050" url="?curid=840664" title="Merrivale, Devon">
<text>Merrivale (formerly also Merivale) is a locality in western Dartmoor, in the West Devon district of Devon, England. It is best known for the nearby series of Bronze Age megalithic monuments to the south and a former granite quarry.

==Merrivale hamlet==
The hamlet, which lies within the civil parish of Whitchurch, is situated at the crossing of the River Walkham on the B3357 (formerly the main Ashburton to Tavistock road), midway between the towns of Princetown and Tavistock. There is an older disused bridge to the north of the modern road. The hamlet is dominated by the spoil tip from the former Merrivale granite quarry (originally known as Tor Quarries), which closed in 1997. The few buildings include houses built originally for quarry workers and the Dartmoor Inn, which sells Merrivale Ale. There was once also a Wesleyan chapel.

==Archaeology==
The main area of archaeological interest is to the south-east of the hamlet at . Although it has been diminished over time, the site includes a 3.8m standing stone, a stone circle and a stone row. 

Also visible are two stone avenues running parallel to each other on either side of a stream. The southern avenue is 263.5 metres long and has the remains of a barrow in the middle. The northern avenue is slightly shorter. Both avenues are only about 1 metre wide down the centre. The southernmost double row has a kistvaen set within the stone row. The eastern end of the rows is passed by a section of the Great Western Reave, running roughly NW-SE.

To the south of the avenues is a large kistvaen which contained a flint scraper, a number of flint flakes and a whetstone for polishing metal items. The &#x27;lid&#x27; of the cist was broken in two by a farmer sometime in the past who made a gatepost out of it. Numerous tors are visible from the site, including King&#x27;s Tor and Staple Tor.

The stone row was formerly known in the area as the Potato Market or Plague Market, supposedly since provisions for Tavistock were left here during an outbreak of plague. William Crossing remarked on how insignificant the stones appear, given the size of some of the raw materials available.

More recent archaeology includes the remains of tin mining and smelting along the River Walkham and its side streams.

==Geology and geomorphology==
Merrivale straddles the western edge of the Dartmoor granite outcrop. The hamlet, quarry and Staple Tors to the north are on the granite, while Cox Tor immediately to the west is on the metamorphic aureole, with altered Carboniferous sedimentary rocks of the Culm Measures lower down and calc-silicate hornfels and intrusive dolerite at the summit. The Merrivale Granite is coarse grained, porphyritic, with crystals that are dark grey, white/cream and orange in colour.

The Merrivale Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) to the north of the hamlet was the 4000th SSSI declared in England, in 1997. Besides the quarry it includes Cox Tor, Roos Tor and Staple Tors. It has a range of periglacial landscape features, including blockfields, boulder runs and boulder stripes, formed under tundra conditions (arctic to sub-arctic climate) during the Pleistocene. It is important in understanding how the landscape of South West England and the granite tors of Devon and Cornwall were formed. All of the land designated as the Merrivale SSSI is owned by the Duchy of Cornwall.

<text>Harry Curtis Stonecipher (born May 16, 1936) is an American business executive who was president and chief executive officer of American aerospace companies: Sundstrand, McDonnell Douglas, and The Boeing Company. Stonecipher was widely credited with the seeming resurgence of Boeing after government procurement scandals. However, his tenure also included major decisions to change Boeing&#x27;s design and sourcing process for the new 787 airliner. These decisions later proved to be organizationally and financially disastrous for the company. Stonecipher was forced to resign from Boeing following the disclosure of an affair with a subordinate, in violation of the Boeing Code of Conduct.

== Early life and education ==
Stonecipher was born in Robbins, Tennessee. 

In 1958, he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in physics at the Tennessee Polytechnic Institute.
In May 2002, Stonecipher received an Honorary Doctorate Degree of Science from Washington University in St. Louis.
== Career ==
Stonecipher began his career at General Motors&#x27; Allison Division, where he worked as a lab technician and was influenced by Jack Welch. 

He moved to General Electric&#x27;s Large Engine Division in 1960, and began to move up the ranks. He became a vice president at GE in 1979, then a division head in 1984. 

In 1984, he left for Sundstrand, where he became President and CEO in 1989.

===McDonnell Douglas===
In September 1994, Stonecipher was elected President and CEO of McDonnell Douglas, holding this post until its merger with Boeing in 1997. During this period he became much more of a public figure, and even began hosting the company&#x27;s quarterly video report. He remained on the Board following the successful completion of that transaction, serving as President and COO of the merged entity. In 2001, he was elected Vice Chairman and retired as President and COO the next year, while continuing to serve on the Board as Vice Chairman.

===Boeing===
Stonecipher came out of retirement to lead Boeing, following the resignation of Chairman and CEO Phil Condit in December 2003 over several scandals. These scandals surrounded allegations of documents stolen from competitors and the hiring of a government procurement officer who at the time was involved in the United States Air Force&#x27;s KC-767 contract. Stonecipher assumed the titles of President and CEO, which was not considered an interim appointment as there was no search initiated for a new Chief Executive, while Lewis Platt became non-executive Chairman of the Board.

Under Stonecipher&#x27;s guidance, the Air Force lifted a 20-month suspension of Boeing&#x27;s Launching Systems Group, which had been involved in one of the scandals, allowing them to bid on Pentagon contracts again. He also oversaw the launch of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner in order to challenge Airbus. Although not fully evident at the time, the results of major changes to Boeing&#x27;s airplane program design, sourcing and financing made during Stonecipher&#x27;s and Condit&#x27;s tenures would later prove disastrous. Shares of the company traded as high as $58.74 in 2005, up 54 percent during his tenure. However, the outsourcing and divestment decisions made 20 years earlier continue to cause Boeing serious problems in 2023.

After the merger, McDonnell executives took charge of the combined entity, and it was McDonnell’s financial management, under Stonecipher, that prevailed. &quot;McDonnell Douglas bought Boeing with Boeing’s money&quot; was a joke heard in Seattle. Stonecipher was said to refer to the company’s engineers as &quot;arrogant&quot;. Stonecipher submitted his resignation upon request of the Boeing Board of Directors on March 6, 2005, after an internal investigation revealed a consensual relationship with Boeing executive Debra Peabody. The probe found that Boeing business operations were unaffected, that Peabody&#x27;s career and compensation were not influenced, and that there was no improper use of company expenses or property. Nonetheless, the board of directors decided that there would be &quot;zero tolerance on breaches of ethics&quot;. His wife of 50 years, Joan Stonecipher, filed for divorce just days after news of his affair became public. Stonecipher was succeeded as president and CEO on an interim basis by Chief Financial Officer James A. Bell, until Board Member James McNerney was hired on a full-time basis.

== Personal life ==
In 1955, at age 18, Stonecipher married Joan in Rossville, Georgia. Stonecipher and his wife have two children.

In 1995, Stonecipher and his wife Joan celebrated their 40th wedding anniversary in Chicago with friends. 

In 2005, after the news broke regarding Stonecipher&#x27;s affair with a Boeing executive, his wife Joan filed for divorce.

Stonecipher subsequently married Debra Peabody. Debra Stonecipher bought the historic Moubray House in Edinburgh.

<text>Ernest Nathan &quot;Dutch&quot; Morial (October 9, 1929 – December 24, 1989), was an American politician and a leading civil rights advocate. He was the first black mayor of New Orleans, serving from 1978 to 1986. He was the father of Marc Morial, who served as Mayor of New Orleans from 1994 to 2002.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Morial, a New Orleans native, grew up in the Seventh Ward in a French-Creole Catholic family. His father was Walter Etienne Morial, a cigarmaker, and his mother was Leonie V. (Moore) Morial, a seamstress. He attended Holy Redeemer Elementary School and McDonogh No. 35 Senior High School. He graduated from Xavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1951. In 1954, he became the first African American to receive a law degree from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.

=== Career ===
Morial came to prominence as a lawyer fighting to dismantle segregation and as president of the local NAACP from 1962 to 1965. He followed in the cautious style of his mentor A. P. Tureaud in preferring to fight for Civil and political rights in courtroom battles, rather than through sit-ins and demonstrations.

After unsuccessful electoral races in 1959 and 1963, he became the first black member of the Louisiana State Legislature since Reconstruction when he was elected in 1967 to represent a district in New Orleans&#x27; Uptown neighborhood. He ran for an at-large position on New Orleans&#x27; City Council in 1969 and 1970, and lost narrowly. He then became the first black Juvenile Court judge in Louisiana in 1970. When he was elected to the Louisiana Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal in 1974, he was the first black American to have attained this position as well.

=== Mayorship ===
In the election of 1977 he became the first African American mayor of New Orleans by defeating City Councilman Joseph V. DiRosa, a fellow Democrat allied with former Mayor Victor Schiro, by a vote of 90,500 to 84,300. Morial won with 95 percent of the black vote and 20 percent of the white vote, which came mainly from middle and upper class Uptown precincts. He won this election without the support of major local black political organizations, like SOUL and COUP. During most of the election campaign, Morial was viewed by most commentators as a spoiler candidate with little chance of victory. 
Morial was a polarizing figure as mayor of New Orleans.

Morial waged long-standing political battles with the City Council, led by his archrival Sidney Barthelemy, and with COUP, Barthelemy&#x27;s political organization. He spent much of his time as mayor trying to increase the strength and influence of the mayor&#x27;s office over independent, state-chartered governmental bodies, like the Sewerage and Water Board and the Dock Board (the supervisory body for the Port of New Orleans), an effort he described as a democratization of city governance. He built a powerful patronage machine using unclassified city employees and used it to defeat opponents in the state legislature—including Hank Braden, Louis Charbonnet, and Nick Connor—by personally sponsoring little-known challengers. In 1978, Braden and Charbonnet competed over a vacant state senate seat, which Braden claimed by a 14-vote margin.

In his first term, Morial faced a sanitation workers’ strike and a police strike which led him to cancel the 1979 Mardi Gras parade season. The police union wagered, among its membership, that a strike coinciding with Mardi Gras would force the city to grant many of their demands, but Morial refused to give in and was supported by leaders of many of the city&#x27;s Carnival krewes. The New Orleans krewes either canceled their parades that year or moved them to suburbs in other parishes. Emblematic of Morial&#x27;s hard-line stance toward the police strikers was the Napoleonic gesture he made by placing his arm inside his coat and striking a characteristically pugnacious pose at the announcement that he was canceling Mardi Gras .

Most of Morial&#x27;s achievements occurred in his first term as mayor. Expanding upon the efforts of his predecessor Moon Landrieu, Morial redoubled the city&#x27;s commitment to affirmative action in hiring city workers and introduced minority hiring quotas for city contractors. The proportion of black employees on the city&#x27;s workforce increased from 40% in 1977 to 53% in 1985 under Morial&#x27;s tenure. Under Morial&#x27;s administration the number of black officers in the NOPD was increased to make up one third of the force. But continued incidents of police brutality—most notably the police killing of four blacks in Algiers in 1980—damaged Morial&#x27;s reputation in the black community.

Morial was responsible for getting federal Urban Development Action Grant (UDAG) funding for several major projects, including Canal Place and the Jax Brewery development in the French Quarter. He continued to support previous mayor Moon Landrieu’s emphasis on tourism and tried to diversify the economy by developing the Almonaster-Michoud Industrial District in New Orleans East, now called the New Orleans Regional Business Park. Downtown New Orleans underwent an impressive building boom, with multiple office towers constructed to house the headquarters, or large regional offices, for companies such as Freeport-McMoRan, Pan American Life Insurance, Exxon, Chevron, Gulf Oil, Amoco, Mobil, Murphy Oil and Texaco. By the mid-1980s these firms, with other large employers, such as Royal Dutch Shell, Louisiana Land and Exploration and McDermott International, employed thousands of white collar workers downtown, with thousands more employed by others providing services to them. Due to a multitude of factors, including the Oil Bust (1986), inexorable corporate mergers and downsizings, and less-than-effective support from subsequent administrations&#x27; economic development departments, none of these firms, or their successors, maintain a large presence in New Orleans today—apart from Shell and Pan American Life Insurance.

Morial won his second term in a March 1982 runoff election with fellow Democrat, Ron Faucheux, a young white Democratic member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from New Orleans East. Morial prevailed, 100,703 votes (53.2 percent) to Faucheux&#x27;s 88,583 (46.8 percent). Faucheux later became a nationally known political consultant and pundit.

By Morial&#x27;s second term the city&#x27;s economy was slowing and increased conflict with the City Council led to a decrease in the ability of the Morial administration to govern effectively. The 1984 World&#x27;s Fair, which transpired midway through Morial&#x27;s second term, was an embarrassing financial debacle that was negatively remarked upon nationally. The World&#x27;s Fair declared bankruptcy while still operating and failed to pay many contractors, mortally wounding numerous New Orleans–based design and construction companies. More generally, the financial failure of the World&#x27;s Fair severely undermined the community&#x27;s morale and ominously presaged the hard times of 1986&#x27;s Oil Bust.

=== Later life and death ===
After serving two terms as mayor, Morial was prevented by the city charter from seeking a third term. He twice tried to convince voters to change the charter to allow him to run again, but both proposals were soundly defeated.

Morial&#x27;s political strength did not end after he left City Hall in 1986. He considered running for mayor again in the election of 1990, and his sudden death in 1989 of a heart attack during the election campaign influenced Mayor Barthelemy&#x27;s re-election, since Morial died before he could endorse an opponent. Morial was 60.

== Legacy ==
New Orleans renamed its convention center, which spans over 10 blocks, the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center in 1992 for the late mayor. The convention center has been a major economic engine for the city&#x27;s large tourist industry and, in 2005, became a highly publicized national symbol when it served as a makeshift evacuation center in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.
In 1997, the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center posthumously honored Morial with the dedication of the Ernest N. Morial Asthma, Allergy and Respiratory Disease Center. The facility is Louisiana&#x27;s first comprehensive center for the education, prevention, treatment and research of asthma and other respiratory diseases. &quot;Dutch&quot; suffered and eventually died from complications associated with asthma.
Morial was the 23rd general president of Alpha Phi Alpha, the first intercollegiate Greek-letter organization established for African Americans. Morial was also a member of the Knights of Peter Claver. In 1993, Morial was named one of the first thirteen inductees into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield, the first African American so honored.

A public school in New Orleans East was named after him: Ernest N. Morial Elementary.

<doc id="840674" wikidata="Q1165099" url="?curid=840674" title="SpaceX Kestrel">
<text>The SpaceX Kestrel was an LOX/RP-1 pressure-fed rocket engine. The Kestrel engine was developed in the 2000s by SpaceX for upper stage use on the Falcon 1 rocket. Kestrel is no longer being manufactured; the last flight of Falcon 1 was in 2009.

Kestrel was built around the same pintle architecture as the SpaceX Merlin engine but does not have a turbopump and is fed only by tank pressure.

Kestrel was ablatively cooled in the chamber and throat and radiatively cooled in the nozzle, which was fabricated from a high strength niobium alloy. As a metal, niobium is highly resistant to cracking compared to carbon-carbon. According to SpaceX, an impact from orbital debris or during stage separation might dent the metal but have no meaningful effect on engine performance. Helium pressurant efficiency is substantially increased via a titanium heat exchanger on the ablative/niobium boundary.

Thrust vector control is provided by electro-mechanical actuators on the engine dome for pitch and yaw. Roll control (and attitude control during coast phases) is provided by helium cold gas thrusters.

A TEA-TEB pyrophoric ignition system is used to provide restart capability on the upper stage and simplify design. In a multi-manifested mission, this design would allow for drop off at different altitudes and inclinations.

== Kestrel 2 ==
Enhancements to the design of the original Kestrel engine were planned, called the Kestrel 2. 

The engine design was still pressure-fed, and was supposed to fly on a newly designed second stage that used Aluminium-lithium alloy 2195, rather than the 2014 Aluminum used in the Falcon 1 second stage.
Engine changes were to include tighter tolerances to improve consistency, higher Isp, and lighter weight.
The Kestrel 2 did not remain in active development after the Falcon 1 was replaced by the much larger Falcon 9 v1.0 which used an improved Merlin 1C for its upper stage.

<doc id="840675" wikidata="Q887269" url="?curid=840675" title="Higinio Morínigo">
<text>Higinio Nicolás Morínigo Martínez (11 January 1897 – 27 January 1983) was a Paraguayan military officer and politician who served as the 35th president of Paraguay from 1940 to 1948, ruling as a military dictator. 

Born to a mestizo family, Morínigo pursued a military career, serving as a prominent officer of the Paraguayan Army during the Chaco War. After the war he served in the cabinet of liberal President Félix Paiva. In May 1940, Morínigo was appointed Minister of War by President José Félix Estigarribia. After Estigarribia&#x27;s death on 7 September, Morínigo succeeded him as acting president. 

Due to the new constitution enacted by Estigarribia shortly before his death, which gave immense power to the president, Morínigo was able to establish a military dictatorship. In 1943, after three years serving as acting president, Morínigo was elected to a full term, having run unopposed as all political parties were banned. 

He was overthrown and was forced to resign in 1948 due to suspicions that he wanted to perpetuate himself in power, despite Juan Natalicio González being chosen as his successor, he was replaced by then President of the Supreme Court of Justice Juan Manuel Frutos as Provisional President.

==Early life and military career==
Higinio Nicolás Morínigo Martínez was born on 11 January 1897 in Paraguarí, Paraguarí Department, to a mestizo family of merchants. He grew up speaking both Spanish and Guarani.

He attended military college and entered the Paraguayan Army in 1922. He participated in the Chaco War and was appointed the Army&#x27;s Chief of Staff in 1936. Morínigo gained fame in Paraguay during the February Revolution of 1936 by heading an expedition to the site of the Battle of Cerro Corá to retrieve the remains of Francisco Solano López. President José Félix Estigarribia, himself a Chaco War hero and supporter of the Liberal Party, promoted Morínigo to general and appointed him as Minister of War on May 2, 1940.

After Estigarribia&#x27;s unexpected death in an airplane crash on September 7, Morínigo was chosen by the army and Liberal ministers as interim President for the two-month period leading to new Presidential elections.

==Dictatorship (1940-1948)==
On September 30, 1940, after growing disagreements with the President, the Liberal ministers resigned from the government. On October 16 Morínigo announced that the presidential election would be postponed for two years. Soon afterward he announced a policy of &quot;discipline, hierarchy and order&quot; &quot;(disciplina, jerarquia, y orden)&quot; and stated that persons who spread subversive ideas would be &quot;subject to confinement&quot;.

On November 30, Morínigo banned all political parties and imposed a state of siege, which gave him the right to suspend civil liberties and arrest and detain people without trial. In a midday radio address announcing these measures, Morínigo declared, &quot;The people and the Army from this moment will be under a single command.&quot; In his self-coup and subsequent rule, he was greatly assisted by the 1940 Constitution, a severely authoritarian document written by Estigarribia a few months earlier that gave the president sweeping executive powers.

To strengthen his authority, on February 4, 1941, Morínigo removed the influential Colonel Peredes from the post of interior minister. On April 17, 1941, he suppressed a &quot;febrerista&quot; uprising by supporters of the February Revolution.

On April 25, 1942, he banned the Liberal Party, accusing them of conspiring with the Bolivians and exiled Party&#x27;s leaders. Morínigo&#x27;s only remaining supporters were radicals from the Colorado Party and the Army. During his dictatorship he faced widespread resistance, including general strikes and military revolts, but he survived by maintaining the loyalty of the Paraguayan Army, which received 45% of the country&#x27;s budget.

Morínigo relied on the right-wing Colorado faction &quot;Guión Rojo&quot; (the &quot;Red Banner&quot;), led by Juan Natalico Gonzalez, as a paramilitary police force to intimidate &quot;febreristas&quot; and Liberals. Opposition newspapers were shut down and publishers exiled.

Morínigo finally held presidential elections on February 15, 1943; he was the sole candidate.

=== Pro-fascist sympathies ===
Just as in other South American countries, pro-Nazi and pro-fascist sympathies at this time were quite strong in the society and among military officers. After it entered World War II in 1941, the United States tried to exert some pressure on Morínigo to limit the influence of Axis supporters. He kept Paraguay neutral for most of the war. He only officially declared war against the Axis in February 1945, without sending any soldiers to fight.

A surge of German influence in the region and Argentina&#x27;s pro-Axis leanings alarmed the United States, which sought to wean Paraguay away from German and Argentine influence. At the same time, the United States sought to enhance its presence in the region and pursued close cooperation with Brazil, Argentina&#x27;s traditional rival. To this end, the United States provided to Paraguay sizable amounts of funds and supplies under the Lend-Lease Agreement, provided loans for public works, and gave technical assistance in agriculture and health care. The United States Department of State approved of closer ties between Brazil and Paraguay and especially supported Brazil&#x27;s offer to finance a road project designed to reduce Paraguay&#x27;s dependence on Argentina.

United States protests over German and Argentine activities in Paraguay fell on deaf ears. While the United States defined its interests in terms of resisting the fascist threat, Paraguayan officials believed their best interests lay in economic expediency and were reluctant to antagonize Germany until the outcome of the war was no longer in doubt. Many Paraguayans believed Germany was no more of a threat to Paraguay&#x27;s sovereignty than the United States.

Much to the displeasure of the United States and Britain, Morínigo refused to act against German economic and diplomatic interests until the very end of the war. German agents had successfully converted many Paraguayans to the Axis cause. South America&#x27;s first Nazi Party branch had been founded in Paraguay in 1931. German immigrant schools, churches, hospitals, farmers&#x27; cooperatives, youth groups, and charitable societies became active Axis backers. All of those organizations prominently displayed swastikas and portraits of Adolf Hitler.

Morínigo&#x27;s regime was pro-Axis. Large numbers of Paraguayan military officers and government officials were openly sympathetic to the Axis. Among these officials was the national police chief, who named his son Adolfo Hirohito after the best-known Axis leaders. By 1941, the official newspaper &quot;El País&quot; had adopted an overtly pro-German stance. At the same time, the government strictly controlled pro-Allied labor unions. Police cadets wore swastikas and Italian insignia on their uniforms.

The December 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and Germany&#x27;s declaration of war against the United States gave the United States the leverage it needed, however, to force Morínigo to commit himself publicly to the Allied cause. Morínigo officially severed diplomatic relations with the Axis countries in 1942, although he did not declare war against Germany until February 1945. Nonetheless, Morínigo continued to maintain close relations with the heavily German-influenced Argentine military throughout the war and provided a haven for Axis spies and agents.

The outbreak of World War II eased Morínigo&#x27;s task of ruling Paraguay while keeping the army happy, because it stimulated demand for Paraguayan export products, such as meat, hides, and cotton, and boosted the country&#x27;s export earnings. More important, United States policy toward Latin America at this time made Paraguay eligible for major economic assistance. Paraguay received American financial help which was used for improving roads and other infrastructure projects.

===Postwar liberalization===
Pressure from the US for democratization swept South America after the war. On June 9, 1946, Morínigo dismissed Colonel Benitez Vera, the right-wing head of the army, and crushed a short uprising by Vera&#x27;s supporters. He then created a civilian coalition government formed by Colorado Party members and leftist &quot;febreristas&quot;, followers of former dictator Rafael Franco and allowed some political freedoms, going so far as legalizing the Paraguayan Communist Party. Despite all this, in September 1946 he ordered suppression of opposition groups and used the Red Banner paramilitary group to attack the office of the Liberal newspaper &quot;El País&quot;.

=== Civil war of 1947 ===
Feeling that Morínigo was favouring the right-wing Colorados, the &quot;febreristas&quot; made common cause with the Liberal Party and the Communist Party in the Civil War of 1947.

The relaxation of the dictatorship was used by political parties to assert their influence in state institutions. In January 1947 officers loyal to the Colorado Party gained control of the army, and on January 11 &quot;febreristas&quot; quit the government and called on the army to overthrow Morínigo, who responded by declaring a state of siege and arresting &quot;febreristas&quot;, Liberals and Communists.

On March 7 a bloody civil war started. Despite the fact that 80% of soldiers and 90% of officers were against him, Morínigo had the backing of Colorado party militias and Argentinian President Juan Peron; he managed to win a conflict that caused many thousand deaths and up to 300,000 people to flee as refugees. The future dictator Alfredo Stroessner was one of the few officers who remained loyal to Morínigo during the civil war. For the next 15 years, the Colorados were the only legal party in Paraguay.

=== Removal from power ===
On February 15, 1948, Morínigo organized presidential elections which were won by the only candidate allowed to run, Juan Natalicio González —leader of the Colorado Party&#x27;s Red Banner faction In return for his support of Gonzalez for president, Morínigo would have continued as commander-in-chief once he relinquished the presidency. Suspecting that Morínigo intended to use this as a means to retain power, on June 3 some Colorado Party loyalists under Felipe Molas López revolted and sent him into exile in Argentina. Supreme Court Chief Justice Juan Manuel Frutos was sworn in as interim president, serving the last two months of Morínigo&#x27;s term until González was officially inaugurated on August 15, 1948.

<text>The Upfield line is a commuter railway line in the city of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Operated by Metro Trains Melbourne, it is the city&#x27;s fifth-shortest metropolitan railway line at . The line runs from Flinders Street station in central Melbourne to Upfield station in the north, serving 19 stations via North Melbourne, Brunswick, Coburg, and Fawkner.

The line operates for approximately 19 hours a day (from approximately 05:00 to around midnight) with a 24-hour service on Friday and Saturday nights. During peak hours, headways of up to 15 minutes are operated, with services every 20–30 minutes during off-peak hours. Trains run in two three-car formations of either Comeng or Siemens Nexas sets.

Services on the line began in 1884 when it opened from North Melbourne to Coburg. In October 1889, it was extended to Somerton. The continued existence of the line was in serious doubt in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with proposals for it either to be converted to a light rail or fully closed. 

With the future of the rail line secured, and patronage growth in the 2000s, infrastructure upgrades were carried out on the line. They included replacing sleepers, upgrading signalling technology, removing level crossings, introducing new rolling stock, and improving station accessibility. The 2018 Victorian Rail Plan identified the need to reopen the rail line between Upfield and Somerton/Roxburgh Park, and run regional and metropolitan rail services via that route in the near future.

== History ==
=== 19th century ===
The Upfield line originated as a line from North Melbourne to Coburg. The line was opened by the Governor of Victoria Henry Loch in September 1884, and cost £53,000. In October 1889, it was extended to Somerton, with duplication providing an additional track from North Melbourne to Royal Park in September 1888, to South Brunswick (now Jewell) in May 1889, between Brunswick and Coburg in December 1891, and between South Brunswick to Brunswick in August 1892.

=== 20th century ===

==== Early upgrades (1900–1950) ====
The Coburg to Somerton section closed in July 1903, but was reopened as far as Fawkner in December 1906. The reopening was for funeral trains only, in conjunction with the creation of the adjacent Fawkner Cemetery. Normal passenger services were extended to Fawkner in 1915, and the line was electrified by December 1920.

In March 1928, despite strong resistance from the Railways Commissioners, the state government ordered the reopening of the section from Fawkner to Somerton for passengers. Passenger services were provided by an AEC railmotor, which connected with electric trains at Fawkner.

==== Upfield—Somerton link (1950–1970) ====
In May 1956, the line from Fawkner to Somerton was again closed, but only three years later, in July 1959, the Upfield to Somerton section reopened for goods trains. Also in 1959, the track from Coburg to Fawkner was duplicated and, in the following month, the section from Fawkner to Upfield was reopened, after being electrified, to cater for workers at the new Ford automotive factory next to the new Upfield station. In September 1958, Sunday evening services after 6pm withdrawn, being replaced by adjacent tram routes, particularly the North Coburg line (now Route 19). At the outer end of the railway line, a bus service was provided, connecting with trams in North Coburg. In June 1961, that arrangement was extended to apply for the whole of Sunday and, in October 1961, it was further extended to include services after 7:30pm between Mondays and Saturdays.

In January 1963, the line from Somerton to the Ford factory was re-laid as dual gauge gauntlet track, to provide a standard gauge connection with the new North East standard gauge line at Somerton. In October 1968, electric staff safeworking was introduced on the Upfield to Somerton section. However, the Upfield to Somerton section, which included four industrial sidings, has not been used for some time and is out of commission.

==== Proposed light rail conversion and modernisation efforts (1970–2000) ====
Automatic signalling advanced a little further along the line in August 1971, with Royal Park to Jewell being converted. In April 1972, the Macaulay to Royal Park section was similarly converted. By May 1988, serious consideration was given to proposals to convert the line to light rail, following the conversion of the St Kilda and Port Melbourne lines in 1987. A report submitted to the Cain government determined that the route suffered from low passenger numbers, redundancy with the Route 19 tram, outdated signalling systems, manned boom gates well past their prime, and that substantial investments would be required to modernise the line to meet modern standards. After discussions with local councils, unions, the public, and the Metropolitan Transit Authority, two options were floated. These options included:

* The conversion of the entire line, or part of the line to light rail
* The closure of large amounts of the line and instead running the light rail via Sydney Road
These proposals were put to rest in April 1995, when it was announced that $23 million would be spent upgrading the line. The work included the provision of power signalling for the whole line, and the installation of boomgates at all level crossings, except for a few that were closed instead. At the time, many of the numerous level crossings on the line were still controlled by gatekeepers, who opened and closed the gates manually for every train. 

=== 21st century ===

During the 2006 Commonwealth Games, Royal Park station played a critical role in the running of the games, as it was centrally located to the athletes village and the State Netball and Hockey Centre. The line and station became heavily utilised during the games, with increased security and staff presence at the station. 

== Future ==
=== Level Crossing Removals ===

In 2017, a level crossing was removed at Camp Road, Campbellfield by lowering the rail line underneath the road. The rail line was elevated from Coburg to Moreland stations in 2020 to remove four level crossings. Crossings were removed at Bell Street, Moreland Road, Munro Street, and Reynard Street, with both Coburg and Moreland stations rebuilt as part of these removals. 

Eight further level crossings between Anstey and Royal Park stations are planned to be removed by 2030, at Albert Street, Albion Street, Brunswick Road, Dawson Street, Hope Street, Union Street, Victoria Street, and Park Street. At the end of these removals, the Upfield line will have 10 remaining crossings not slated for removal.

Jewell, Brunswick and Anstey stations are set to be closed and replaced by two new stations. The new northern station is currently planned to be located near Hope Street, approximately 200 metres south of the current Anstey station. The new southern station is planned to be located between Union Street and Dawson Street, approximately 200 metres north of the current Jewell station. Both stations will be approximately 450 metres away from the current Brunswick station.

The decision to build two stations in different locations instead of rebuilding all 3 generated significant criticism from residents and the local council. Local newspaper Brunswick Voice reported that the Minister for Transport Infrastructure, Danny Pearson, claimed &quot;the decision to build two stations followed 18 months of technical and engineering assessments which found fewer stations would boost capacity on the line in the future and deliver more open space&quot;, noting that &quot;[the government claimed] the plan would also minimise the impact to heritage in the area, but [the politician] provided no detail about whether the three station buildings and the historic boom gate operators&#x27; cabins would be preserved&quot;.

=== Wallan extension ===
Highlighted in the 2018 Victorian Rail Plan, a proposal exists for the Upfield line to be extended via the current Somerton link to the Craigieburn line, then onto Wallan. The 2018 Victorian Rail Plan has proposed the following projects take place as part of the Wallan extension:

In 2018, the government announced that a business case would be completed to further investigate the possibility for these series of projects to commence. A business case was completed, however, it wasn&#x27;t released to the public. Since the business case in 2018, there have been little developments despite the &#x27;Metro Tunnel Day One&#x27; milestone of the 2018 Plan fast approaching.

== Network and operations ==

=== Services ===
Services on the Upfield line operates from approximately 5:00 am to around 12:00 daily. The Upfield line has one of the least-frequent peak-period services in Melbourne&#x27;s railway network, with train frequency being every 15–20 minutes while outside the peak the frequency is reduced to 20–30 minutes throughout the entire route. On Friday and Saturday nights, services run 24 hours a day, with 60-minute frequencies available outside of normal operating hours.

Train services on the Upfield line are also subjected to maintenance and renewal works, usually on selected Fridays and Saturdays. Shuttle bus services are provided throughout the duration of works for affected commuters.

==== Stopping patterns ====

* ▼ - Only outbound trains stop
* | – Trains pass and do not stop


=== Operators ===
The Upfield line has had a total of 7 operators since its opening in 1884. The majority of operations throughout its history have been government run: from its first service in 1884 until the 1999 privatisation of Melbourne&#x27;s rail network, four different government operators have run the line. These operators, Victorian Railways, the Metropolitan Transit Authority, the Public Transport Corporation, and Bayside Trains have a combined operational length of 121 years.

Bayside Trains was privatised in August 1999 and later rebranded as M&gt;Train. In 2002, M&gt;Train was placed into receivership and the state government regained ownership of the line, with KPMG appointed as receivers to operate M&gt;Train on behalf of the state government. Two years later, rival train operator Connex Melbourne took over the M&gt;Train operations including the Frankston line. Metro Trains Melbourne, the current private operator, then took over the operations in 2009. The private operators have had a combined operational period of years.
=== Route ===
The Upfield line forms a linear route from the Melbourne central business district to its terminus in Upfield. The route is long, making it the fifth shortest line on the Melbourne metropolitan network. The line is double tracked from the city to Gowrie station with the line only having a single track past that point till Upfield. The only underground section of the Upfield line is in the City Loop, where the service stops at three underground stations. Exiting the city, the Upfield line traverses mainly flat country with few curves and fairly minimal earthworks for most of the line. Some sections of the line have been elevated or lowered into a cutting to eliminate level crossings. Despite some removals, there are a number of level crossings still present with no current plans to remove them. Rare in Melbourne, the line travels underneath the CityLink toll road beside the Moonee Ponds Creek for a portion of the line, before rising up a lengthy hill in Royal Park until it reaches Jewell railway station.

The line follows the same alignment as multiple lines with the Upfield line splitting off at North Melbourne. The Upfield line continues on its northern alignment, whereas the other lines continue onto a western or south-western alignment. Most of the rail line goes through built-up suburbs and some industrial areas.

=== Stations ===
The line serves 19 stations across of track. The stations are a mix of elevated, lowered, underground, and ground level designs. Underground stations are present only in the City Loop, with the majority of elevated and lowered stations being constructed as part of level crossing removals. Notably, the line has one of the lowest proportion of premium stations amongst Melbourne&#x27;s railway lines, with only three stations past the North Melbourne junction classified as premium stations.


== Infrastructure ==

=== Rolling stock ===
The Upfield line uses two different types of electric multiple unit (EMU) trains that are operated in a split six-car configuration. The rarer rolling stock featured on the line is the Comeng EMUs, built by Commonwealth Engineering between 1981 and 1988. These train sets are the oldest on the Melbourne rail network and subsequently are planned to be replaced by 2026. The more common of rolling stock is the Siemens Nexas EMUs which are widely featured on the line, originally built between 2002 and 2005 these train sets feature more modern technology than the Comeng trains.

Alongside the passenger trains, Upfield line tracks and equipment are maintained by a fleet of engineering trains. The four types of engineering trains are: the shunting train; designed for moving trains along non-electrified corridors and for transporting other maintenance locomotives, for track evaluation; designed for evaluating track and its condition, the overhead inspection train; designed for overhead wiring inspection, and the infrastructure evaluation carriage designed for general infrastructure evaluation. Most of these trains are repurposed locomotives previously used by V/Line, Metro Trains, and the Southern Shorthaul Railroad.

==== Planned rolling stock ====
From late 2025 or early 2026, the next generation of the X&#x27;Trapolis family of electric EMUs—the X&#x27;Trapolis 2.0—will be introduced. This new model will fully replace the existing fleet of Comeng EMUs currently operating on the line currently with new, modern, and technologically advanced trains. The new trains will feature:

* Modernised doors to reduce the boarding times at stations to under 40 seconds
* Passenger information systems to display that train&#x27;s journey in real time
* Higher energy efficiency to work with a lower network voltage, to fit in line with modern rail systems overseas
* New interior designs including tip-up seating to allow space for wheelchair spaces.
* Designated bicycle storage areas
* Passenger operated automatic wheelchair ramps located behind driver cabs
* 6 car fully walk through carriages

=== Accessibility ===
In compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act of 1992, all stations that are new-built or rebuilt are fully accessible and comply with these guidelines. The majority of the stations on the corridor are fully accessible, however, there are some stations that haven&#x27;t been upgraded to meet these guidelines. These stations do feature ramps, however, they have a gradient greater than 1 in 14. Stations that are fully accessible feature ramps that have a gradient less than 1 in 14, have at-grade paths, or feature lifts. These stations typically also feature tactile boarding indicators, independent boarding ramps, wheelchair accessible myki barriers, hearing loops, and widened paths.

Projects improving station accessibility have included the Level Crossing Removal Project, which involves station rebuilds and upgrades, and individual station upgrade projects. More than 90% of Upfield line stations are now classed as fully accessible. Future station upgrade projects are planned to increase the number of fully accessible stations overtime.

=== Signalling ===
The Upfield line uses three-position signalling which is widely used across the Melbourne train network. Three-position signalling was first introduced in 1928, with the final section of the line converted to the new type of signalling in 1972.

<doc id="840680" wikidata="Q281661" url="?curid=840680" title="Robert Morison">
<text>Robert Morison (162010 November 1683) was a Scottish botanist and taxonomist. A forerunner of John Ray, he elucidated and developed the first systematic classification of plants.

==Biography==
Born in Aberdeen, Morison was an outstanding scholar who gained his Master of Arts degree from the University of Aberdeen at the age of eighteen. During the English Civil War he joined the Charles I of England&#x27;s Cavaliers and was seriously wounded at the 1639 Battle of the Bridge of Dee during the Civil War. On recovering, he fled to France when it became apparent that the cause was lost.

In 1648, he took a doctorate in medicine at the University of Angers in Western France and from then on devoted himself entirely to the study of botany. He studied in Paris under the guidance of Vespasien Robin, botanist to the king of France, who introduced him to Gaston, Duke of Orléans. On Robin&#x27;s recommendation, Morison became director of the Royal Gardens at Blois, Central France, a post which he subsequently held for ten years.

In 1660, despite inducements to make him stay in France, Morison returned to England following the Restoration and became physician to Charles II as well as his botanist and superintendent of all the royal gardens with a salary of £200 per annum, and a free house.

Earlier in 1621, Henry Danvers, 1st Earl of Danby had given Oxford University 250 pounds for the purchase of land for a &quot;Physic Garden&quot;. At the same time, the earl bequeathed &quot;certain revenues&quot; to fund a chair in botany at the university; in 1669 Morison became the first professor of botany, a post that he held until 1683.

In the year that he began teaching at Oxford, Morison published &quot;Praeludia Botanica&quot;, a work which stressed using the structure of a plant&#x27;s fruits for classification. At the time, classification focused on the habitat and medicinal properties of the plant and Morison&#x27;s criticism of systems promoted by botanists such as Jean and Gaspard Bauhin caused some anger among his contemporaries.

In 1669, he also published &#x27;Hortus Regius Blesensis&#x27; by the newly revived University Press, it was a catalogue of the Blois garden to which Morison added the description of 260 previously un-described plants, although Richard Pulteney (&quot;A General View of the Writings of Linnaeus&quot;, 1781) disagreed and noted that they were only varieties and others were already described.

In the preface to his &quot;Plantarum Umbelliferarum Distributio Nova&quot; (1672), Morison gave a definitive statement of the principles of his method and was the first person to write a &quot;monograph of a specific group of plants&quot;, the Umbelliferae.

Morison was fatally injured by the pole of a carriage as he was crossing the street on 9 November 1683 and died the following day at his house in Green Street, Leicester-fields. He was buried in the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster.

* At the time of his death, Morison&#x27;s opus magnum the &quot;Historia Plantarum Universalis Oxoniensis&quot; remained unfinished, with only one volume published in 1680 detailing fifteen classes of his classification system. He had collaborated on this volume with Charles Hatton. It was entrusted by Oxford University to Jacob Bobart the Younger, who on the death of his father Jacob Bobart the Elder published a second and final instalment of the &quot;Historia&quot; in 1699 dealing with the remaining ten sections of herbaceous plants.
* Around 1737, in a letter to Swiss naturalist Albrecht von Haller, Carl Linnaeus wrote:

<doc id="840681" wikidata="Q3939827" url="?curid=840681" title="Rocky the Flying Squirrel">
<text>Rocket &quot;Rocky&quot; J. Squirrel, also known as Rocky the Flying Squirrel, is one of the two protagonists of the 1959–1964 animated series &quot;Rocky and His Friends&quot; and &quot;The Bullwinkle Show&quot; (both shows often referred to collectively as &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot;), produced by Jay Ward. Rocky is the best friend and ally of the western moose, Bullwinkle. Both Rocky and Bullwinkle were given the middle initial &quot;J&quot; as a reference to Ward.

== Creation ==
Jay Ward and partner Alex Anderson originally created Rocky as part of &quot;The Frostbite Falls Review&quot;, a proposed pilot that wasn&#x27;t developed. The character was later used as the star of the series &quot;Rocky and His Friends&quot;. However, when the show changed networks from ABC to NBC, its name was changed to &quot;The Bullwinkle Show&quot;, with Bullwinkle replacing Rocky as the lead role due to the moose having larger popularity than Rocky.

== Biography ==
Rocky shared a house with Bullwinkle, in the fictional small town of Frostbite Falls, Minnesota, a parody of the real-life American town of International Falls, Minnesota. Rocky and Bullwinkle would often have various adventures that usually saw them thwart the various schemes of the series&#x27; villains, Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale (and also occasionally Boris and Natasha&#x27;s superior, Fearless Leader).

Rocky&#x27;s most frequently used catchphrase was &quot;Hokey smoke!&quot;

== Personality ==
Rocky&#x27;s personality was meant to be that of an upstanding, if slightly naive, all-American youth. As the brains and straight man of the &quot;moose and squirrel&quot; duo, Rocky often was shown as coming up with creative solutions to the various situations the duo found themselves in on their adventures. However, he is no less gullible toward Boris Badenov&#x27;s and Natasha Fatale&#x27;s disguises than Bullwinkle. The best he can do is to occasionally remark, &quot;Those two look familiar!&quot; or &quot;That voice, where have I heard it before?&quot;

== Powers and abilities ==
Rocky often made extensive use of his ability to fly, which was presented with, appropriate to his full name, a jet engine sound effect. The original opening title of &quot;Rocky and His Friends&quot; introduces Rocky as &quot;that Jet Age aerial ace&quot;, complete with Rocky performing a solo air show for a crowd of spectators. His airborne abilities have been depicted inconsistently; some episodes, such as the first season&#x27;s &quot;Jet Fuel Formula&quot; storyline, presented this ability as limited to gliding (similar to the abilities of a real flying squirrel). Other episodes presented Rocky&#x27;s flight abilities as similar to those of Superman (hovering in mid-air, ascending in altitude, carrying objects, etc.); one example is Rocky flying from Minnesota to Washington, D.C. under his own power in the second season&#x27;s &quot;Greenpernt Oogle&quot; storyline.

Occasionally, Rocky would rely on Bullwinkle&#x27;s strength (via an acrobatic maneuver) to provide him with an extra boost in flight speed, as shown in his attempt to reach the hovering Mount Flatten in the second season&#x27;s &quot;Upsidaisium&quot; storyline.

According to the series, Rocky learned his aerial skills at the Cedar Yorpantz Flying School (a play on the idiomatic expression &quot;seat of your pants&quot;).

== Voice ==
Voice actress June Foray was the voice of Rocky, as well as the voice of Natasha Fatale, Nell Fenwick and other female characters. Foray continued to voice the character in modern media depictions of &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; including the 2000 film until her retirement in 2014. In the 1992 film &quot;Boris and Natasha: The Movie&quot;, Andrea Martin portrays Rocky as the human woman &quot;Agent Squirrel&quot;.

Rocky returns in the 2018 Amazon Video series &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot;, where Tara Strong took over as the voice of Rocky.

== Other appearances ==
The Rocky character made an appearance in Gary Larson&#x27;s &quot;The Far Side&quot; comic strip, causing Larson to comment, &quot;I&#x27;ve discovered an interesting phenomenon. Once you&#x27;ve drawn Rocky the Flying Squirrel, you can never draw him again. In the final version, I must have drawn and erased that miserable little rodent fifty times, and he ultimately ended up looking like Rocky the Flying Hamster.&quot;

In 2014, Rocky and Bullwinkle appeared in a GEICO television commercial where the GEICO Gecko is looking at the Rocky Mountains with them, and trying to explain what they were named after.

During a broadcast of an Atlanta Braves baseball game in the late 1990s, a real squirrel scampered onto the field and caused a delay in play. During the delay, the squirrel was featured on camera with a superimposed graphic identifying him as &quot;Rocket J. Squirrel&quot;. His position was listed as &quot;Shortstop&quot;.

<text>Karl Philipp Moritz (Hameln, 15 September 1756 – Berlin, 26 June 1793) was a German author, editor and essayist of the &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot;, late Enlightenment, and classicist periods, influencing early German Romanticism as well. He led a life as a hatter&#x27;s apprentice, teacher, journalist, literary critic, professor of art and linguistics, and member of both of Berlin&#x27;s academies.

==Biography==
Moritz was born into impoverished circumstances in Hameln in 1756. After receiving a scanty schooling, he was apprenticed to a hat maker. After distressful attempts to gain a living, he caught the attention of a patron in Hanover and entered a gymnasium; however, he soon accepted an engagement as actor under Ekhof at Gotha, failing in which he returned to study (1776) at Erfurt; but tiring again he joined the &quot;Herrnhuter&quot; (Moravian Church) at Barby, and studied theology at Wittenberg (1777); then taught philanthropy at the Potsdam military orphanage, soon again to take to wandering.

Teaching in Berlin, he made a reputation as writer, preacher and poet, and went to England. Then he became professor at the gymnasium (high school) at Berlin (). Next he tried editing the &quot;Vossische Zeitung&quot; to make it proletarian, but failed. Later he traveled to Italy (1786) where he met Goethe, and on his return to Germany he took up residence as Goethe&#x27;s guest at Weimar. Duke Karl August helped him join the Berlin Academy of Sciences, and in 1789 Moritz became a professor of antiquities at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Berlin. Among his students were Ludwig Tieck, Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder and Alexander von Humboldt. He was an avid admirer of Jean Paul, and befriended Moses Mendelssohn, and Asmus Jakob Carstens.

==Works==
Apart from a four-part autobiographical novel, &quot;Anton Reiser&quot;, and two fictional &quot;Andreas Hartknopf&quot; novels, he also wrote a number of theoretical writings on aesthetics, especially &quot;Über die bildende Nachahmung des Schönen&quot; (On the Formative Imitation of Beauty), which Goethe excerpted in his &quot;Italian Journey&quot;. Moritz&#x27;s &quot;Magazin zur Erfahrungsseelenkunde als ein Lesebuch für Gelehrte und Ungelehrte&quot; (Journal of Experiential Psychology, as reading for scholars and laymen) was one of the first Germanophone journals of psychology.

<text>Francesco Giuseppe Baldassare Morlacchi (14 June 1784 – 28 October 1841) was an Italian composer of more than twenty operas. During the many years he spent as the royal Royal Kapellmeister in Dresden, he was instrumental in popularizing the Italian style of opera.

==Biography==
Born in Perugia, Morlacchi was from a family of musicians. He composed from a very young age, first studying with his uncle Giovanni Mazzetti and later with Luigi Caruso in Perugia. He later studied at Loreto with Zingarelli (1803-4). Finally, he ended up in Bologna at the school of Stanislao Mattei (1805) where he met Gioacchino Rossini.

Morlacchi was quickly successful as an opera composer. His first operatic works were written in 1807, and were a &quot;farce&quot; and a comic opera. His first truly effective theatre work was the &quot;opera seria&quot; &quot;Corradino&quot; (Parma, 1808), and led to commissions from opera houses in Rome and Milan. In 1810 he was brought to Dresden by contralto Marietta Marcolini, and in 1811 Morlacchi was made Kapellmeister of the Italian Opera in Dresden. While in Dresden, he had to work to establish himself in the eyes of critics. By this time, German opera was well established, and Morlacchi and his compositions were seen to represent the old order both of composers and the aristocracy. In 1815 Morlacchi set &quot;Il barbiere di Siviglia&quot; with a libretto of Giuseppe Petrosellini and one year later Rossini presented his own with a newer libretto by Cesare Sterbini.

One of Morlacchi&#x27;s most successful works was &quot;Tebaldo e Isolina&quot; (La Fenice, Venice, 1822). Giovanni Battista Velluti premiered the work, and made the role his own. The opera was performed in 40 cities over the next ten years, largely thanks to Velluti&#x27;s skillful performance.

The architect Gottlob Friedrich Thormeyer painted his portrait in 1829.

Morlacchi died in Innsbruck.

Although sometimes credited with it, Francesco Morlacchi did not compose &quot;The Swiss Shepherd&quot;, ( &quot;Il pastore svizzero&quot; in Italian ). &quot;The Swiss Shepherd&quot; was instead written by Italian flautist Pietro Morlacchi (1828-1868).

<doc id="840701" wikidata="Q6016263" url="?curid=840701" title="Independence movement in Puerto Rico">
<text>Throughout the history of Puerto Rico, its inhabitants have initiated several movements to gain independence for the island, first from the Spanish Empire between 1493 and 1898 and since then from the United States. Today, the movement is most commonly represented by the flag of the &quot;Grito de Lares&quot; &quot;(Cry of Lares)&quot; revolt of 1868.

A spectrum of pro-autonomy, pro-nationalism, and pro-independence sentiments and political parties exist on the island. Since the beginning of the 19th century, organizations advocating independence in Puerto Rico have attempted both peaceful political means as well as violent revolutionary actions to achieve its objectives. The declaration of independence of Puerto Rico occurred on September 23, 1868 during the &quot;Grito de Lares&quot; revolt against Spanish rule. The revolting members and followers of the Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico proclaimed the flag of the revolt as the national flag of an independent “Republic of Puerto Rico”, making it the first flag of Puerto Rico.
Since the second half of the 20th century, the independence movement has trailed significantly behind the pro-Commonwealth and pro-statehood movements at the ballots. Independence also received the least support, less than 4.5% of the vote, in the status referendums in 1967 (0.60%), 1993 (4.47%), 1998 (2.6%).

A fourth referendum was held on November 6, 2012, with 54% voting to change Puerto Rico&#x27;s status but the federal government took no action to do so. The fifth plebiscite was held on June 11, 2017, With a voter turnout of 23%, it had the lowest turnout of any status referendum held in Puerto Rico. The independence option was linked to the Commonwealth option, obtaining 1.50%. A sixth referendum was held on November 3, 2020, with 52.52% voting to being a state. A seventh referendum was held on November 5, 2024.

In the 2020 Puerto Rican general election, the Puerto Rican Independence Party achieved 13.6% of the vote, a significant increase in support from the 2016 Puerto Rican general election when it received only 2.1% of votes.

==Seeking independence from Spain==

===Taíno revolts===

Some Modern Puerto Rican independence movements have claimed historic connection to the 16th century and the Taíno rebellion of 1511 led by Agüeybaná II. In this revolt, Agüeybaná II, the most powerful &quot;cacique&quot; of the native Taíno people of Puerto Rico at the time, together with Urayoán, cacique of Añasco, organized a revolt in 1511 against the spanish conquistadors in the southern and western parts of the island. He was joined by Guarionex, &quot;cacique&quot; of Utuado, who attacked the &quot;Villa de Sotomayor (Sotomayor Village)&quot; in present-day Aguada, killing 80 Spanish settlers. First explorer and governor of Puerto Rico, Juan Ponce de León, led the Spaniards in a series of offensives that culminated in the Battle of Yagüecas. Agüeybaná II&#x27;s people, who were armed only with spears, bows, and arrows, were no match for the guns of the Spanish forces, resulting in Agüeybaná II being shot and killed in the battle. The revolt ultimately failed, and many Taíno either committed suicide or fled to the interior, mountainous regions of the island.

===Puerto Rican revolts===
Several revolts against the Spanish rulers by the native born, or &quot;Criollos&quot;, occurred in the 19th century. These include the conspiracy at San Germán in 1809, and the uprisings of people in Ciales, San Germán and Sabana Grande in 1898.

Many Puerto Ricans became inspired by the ideals of Simón Bolívar to liberate South America from Spanish rule. Bolívar sought to create a federation of Latin American nations, to include Puerto Rico and Cuba. Brigadier General Antonio Valero de Bernabé, also known as &quot;The Liberator from Puerto Rico&quot;, fought for the independence of South America together with Bolívar; he also wanted an independent Puerto Rico.

María de las Mercedes Barbudo, the first female Puerto Rican &quot;Independentista&quot;, joined forces with the Venezuelan government, under the leadership of Simón Bolívar, to lead an insurrection against the Spanish colonial forces in Puerto Rico. The Spanish occupation forces were the object of more than thirty conspiracies. Some, like the Lares uprising, the riots and sedition of 1897 and the Secret Societies at the end of the 19th century, became popular rebellions. The most widespread popular revolts, however, were the one in Lares in 1868, and the one in Yauco in 1897.

In 1868, the &quot;Grito de Lares&quot; (Cry of Lares) took place, in which revolutionaries occupied the town of Lares and declared the independence of the Republic of Puerto Rico on September 23, 1868. Ramón Emeterio Betances was the leader of this revolt. Earlier, Segundo Ruiz Belvis and Betances had founded the &quot;Comité Revolucionario de Puerto Rico&quot; &quot;(Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico)&quot; from their exile in the New York. Betances wrote several &quot;Proclamas&quot;, or statements attacking the exploitation of the Puerto Ricans by the Spanish colonial system, and called for immediate insurrection. These statements were rapidly circulated throughout the island as local dissident groups began to organize.

Most dissidents were &quot;Criollos&quot; (born on the island). The critical state of the economy, along with the increasing repression imposed by the Spanish, served as catalysts for the rebellion. The stronghold of the movement were towns located on the mountains of the west of the island. The rebels looted local stores and offices owned by &quot;peninsulares&quot; (Spanish-born residents) and took over the city hall. They took as prisoners Spanish merchants and local government officials. The revolutionaries placed their revolutionary flag on the high altar of the church to signify that the revolution had begun. The Republic of Puerto Rico was proclaimed, and Francisco Ramírez Medina was proclaimed interim president. The revolutionaries offered immediate freedom to any slave who would join them.

In the next town, San Sebastián del Pepino, the &quot;Grito de Lares (Cry of Lares)&quot; revolutionaries encountered heavy resistance from the Spanish militia and retreated to Lares. The Spanish militia rounded up the rebels and quickly brought the insurrection to an end. The government imprisoned some 475 rebels, and a military court imposed the death penalty, for treason and sedition, on all the prisoners. But in Madrid, Eugenio María de Hostos and other prominent Puerto Ricans were successful in interceding, and the national government ordered a general amnesty and release of all the prisoners. Numerous leaders, such as Betances, Rojas, Lacroix, Aurelio Méndez and others, were sent into exile.
In 1896, a group of residents of Yauco who supported independence joined forces to overthrow the Spanish government in the island. The group was led by Antonio Mattei Lluberas, a wealthy coffee plantation owner, and Mateo Mercado. Later that year, the local Civil Guard discovered their plans and arrested all those involved. They were soon released and allowed to return home.

In 1897, Lluberas traveled to New York City and visited the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee, which included the exiled group from the &quot;Grito de Lares (Cry of Lares)&quot; revolt of 1868. They made plans for a major coup in Puerto Rico. Lluberas returned to Puerto Rico with the new revolutionary flag of Puerto Rico adopted by the committee in 1895, the current flag of the island, to be flown at the coup. The Mayor of Yauco, Francisco Lluch Barreras, learned of the planned uprising, and notified the island&#x27;s Spanish governor. When Fidel Velez, one of the separatist leaders, learned that the word was out, he met with other leaders and forced them to begin the insurrection immediately.

On March 24, 1897, Velez and his men marched towards Yauco, planning to attack the barracks of the Spanish Civil Guard, to gain control of their arms and ammunition. At arrival, they were ambushed by Spanish forces. When a firefight broke out, the rebels quickly retreated. On March 26, a group headed by Jose Nicolas Quiñones Torres and Ramon Torres fought Spanish colonial forces (mostly island men) in a barrio called &quot;Quebradas&quot; of Yauco, but were overcome. The government arrested more than 150 rebels, charged them with various crimes against the state, and sent them to prison in the City of Ponce. These attacks became known as the &quot;Intentona de Yauco&quot; &quot;(Attempted Coup of Yauco)&quot;. It was the first time that the flag of Puerto Rico was flown on the island.

Velez fled to St. Thomas where he lived in exile. Mattei Lluberas went into exile in New York City, joining a group known as the &quot;Puerto Rican Commission&quot;.

===Spanish Charter of Autonomy===
After four hundred years of colonial rule by the Spanish Empire, Puerto Rico gained autonomy as an overseas autonomous community of Spain on November 25, 1897 through a &quot;Carta de Autonomía&quot; &quot;(Charter of Autonomy)&quot;. It was signed by Spanish Prime Minister Práxedes Mateo Sagasta and ratified by the Spanish Cortes. The newfound autonomy was short-lived, as Puerto Rico was invaded, occupied, and annexed by the United States during the Spanish-American War in 1898. 

==Seeking independence from the United States==
The United States was granted possession of Puerto Rico as part of the Treaty of Paris of 1898, which concluded the Spanish–American War. 

After Puerto Rico became an American possession during the Spanish–American War in 1898, Manuel Zeno Gandía traveled to Washington, D.C. where, together with Eugenio María de Hostos, he proposed the idea of independence for Puerto Rico. The men were disappointed when their ideas were rejected by the US government and the island was organized as a US territory. Zeno Gandia returned to the island and continued as an activist.

A number of leaders, including a well-known intellectual and legislator called José de Diego, sought independence from the United States via political accommodation. On June 5, 1900, President William McKinley named De Diego, together with Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón, José Celso Barbosa, Manuel Camuñas, and Andrés Crosas to an Executive Cabinet under U.S.-appointed Governor Charles H. Allen. The Executive Cabinet also included six American members.

Diego resigned from the position in order to pursue independence. On 19 February 1904, he co-founded the Unionist Party, or the Union of Puerto Rico, the first mass party to advocate for independence for Puerto Rico in the form of a sovereign nation, along with Luis Muñoz Rivera, Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón and Antonio R. Barceló. Diego was elected to the House of Delegates, the only locally elected body of government then allowed by the U.S., over which Diego presided from 1904 to 1917. The House of Delegates was subject to the U.S. President&#x27;s veto power and unsuccessfully voted for the island&#x27;s right to independence and self-government. It petitioned against imposition of U.S. citizenship to Puerto Ricans in 1917, but the US granted citizenship to island residents. Despite these failures, Diego became known as the &quot;Father of the Puerto Rican Independence Movement.&quot;

The newly created Puerto Rico Union Party advocated allowing voters to choose among non-colonial options, including annexation, an independent protectorate, and full autonomy. Another new party called the Puerto Rico Independence Party emerged, founded by Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón in 1912, which promoted Puerto Rico&#x27;s independence. That same year, Scott Colón, Zeno Gandía, Matienzo Cintrón, and Luis Lloréns Torres wrote a manifesto for independence. The Independence Party was the first party in the history of the island to openly support independence from the United States as part of its platform.

===American business===

Through the 1930s, U.S. banking interests and corporations expanded their control of lands throughout Latin America. Taking Puerto Rico was seen as a part of American &quot;Manifest destiny.&quot; The American government supported American corporations with military force on occasion. The profits generated by this one-sided arrangement were enormous, as US corporations developed large plantations.

Several years after leaving office, in 1913 Charles H. Allen, the first civilian U.S. governor of Puerto Rico, succeeded to the presidency of the American Sugar Refining Company after serving as treasurer. He resigned in 1915, but stayed on the board. The company operated the largest sugar-refining operation in the world and was later renamed as the Domino Sugar company. According to historian Federico Ribes Tovar, Charles Allen leveraged his governorship of Puerto Rico into a controlling interest over the entire Puerto Rican economy through Domino Sugar.

American professor and activist Noam Chomsky argued in the late 20th century that, after 1898 &quot;Puerto Rico was turned into a plantation for U.S. agribusiness, later an export platform for taxpayer-subsidized U.S. corporations, and the site of major U.S. military bases and petroleum refineries.&quot; By 1930, over 40 percent of all the arable land in Puerto Rico had been converted into sugar plantations owned by Domino Sugar and U.S. banking interests. These bank syndicates also owned the insular postal system, the coastal railroad, and the San Juan international seaport.

===Formation of the Nationalist Party===


In 1919, Puerto Rico had two major organizations that supported independence: the Nationalist Youth and the Independence Association. Also in 1919, José Coll y Cuchí, a member of the Union Party of Puerto Rico, left the party and formed the Nationalist Association of Puerto Rico. In 1922, these three political organizations joined forces and formed the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, with Coll y Cuchi as party president. The party&#x27;s chief goal was to achieve independence from the United States. This party contended that by international law, the Spanish had no authority under the Treaty of Paris to cede the island, as it was no longer theirs. In 1924 Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos joined the party and was named vice-president.
On May 11, 1930, Pedro Albizu Campos was elected president of the Nationalist Party. Under his leadership, in the 1930s the party became the largest independence movement in Puerto Rico. But, after disappointing electoral outcomes and strong repression by the territorial police, by the mid-1930s Albizu opted against the electoral political process. He advocated violent revolution as the means to achieve independence.

In 1932, the pro-independence Liberal Party of Puerto Rico was founded by Antonio R. Barceló. The Liberal Party&#x27;s political agenda was the same as that of the original Union Party, urging independence for Puerto Rico. Among those who joined him in the &quot;new&quot; party were Felisa Rincón de Gautier and Ernesto Ramos Antonini.

By 1932 Luis Muñoz Rivera&#x27;s son, Luis Muñoz Marín, had also joined the Liberal Party. Muñoz Marín was eventually the first democratically elected Governor of Puerto Rico.

During the 1932 elections, the Liberal Party faced the Alliance, then a coalition of the Republican Party of Puerto Rico and Santiago Iglesias Pantin&#x27;s Socialist Party. Barceló and Muñoz Marín were both elected Senators. By 1936, differences between Muñoz Marín and Barceló began to surface, as well as between those followers who considered Muñoz Marín the true leader and those who considered Barceló as their leader.

Muñoz Marín and his followers, who included Felisa Rincón de Gautier and Ernesto Ramos Antonini, held an assembly in the town of Arecibo to found the &quot;Partido Liberal, Neto, Auténtico y Completo&quot; (Clear, Authentic and Complete Liberal Party), later named the People&#x27;s Democratic Party (PPD for Spanish name).
During the 1930s and 1940s, Nationalist partisans/guerrilleros took part in violent incidents:

* On April 6, 1932, Nationalist partisans marched into the Capitol building in San Juan to protest the legislative proposal to approve the present Puerto Rican flag, the official flag of the insular government. Nationalists preferred the flag used during the Grito de Lares.
* On October 24, 1935, a confrontation with police at University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras campus, killed four Puerto Rican Nationalist Party supporters and one policeman. The event came to be known as the Río Piedras massacre.
* On February 23, 1936, Colonel Elisha Francis Riggs, formerly of the US Army and the highest police officer in the island, was assassinated in retaliation for the Río Piedras events by Nationalists Hiram Rosado and Elías Beauchamp. Rosado and Beauchamp were arrested, and summarily executed without a trial at the police headquarters in San Juan.
* In 1936, the U.S. Senator Millard Tydings presented a legislative proposal to grant independence to Puerto Rico, but many people believed that it had unfavorable economic conditions. Barceló and the Liberal Party favored the Bill, because it would give Puerto Rico its independence; Muñoz Marín opposed the Bill because he wanted Puerto Rico&#x27;s immediate independence but with favorable conditions.

* On March 21, 1937, a march in Ponce by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, organized to commemorate the ending of slavery in Puerto Rico, resulted in the deaths of 17 unarmed citizens and 2 policemen at the hands of the territorial police, an event known as the Ponce massacre.
* On July 25, 1938, shots were fired at the US colonial governor, Blanton Winship during a parade; they killed Police Colonel Luis Irizarry. Soon afterward, two Nationalist partisans/guerrilleros attempted to assassinate Robert Cooper, judge of the Federal Court in Puerto Rico. Winship tried to suppress the Nationalists.
* On June 10, 1948, the United States-appointed Governor of Puerto Rico, Jesús T. Piñero, signed into law a bill passed by the Puerto Rican Senate, which was controlled by elected PPD representatives. It prohibited discussion of independence, militant independence activism, and significantly curtailed other Puerto Rican independence activities. The &quot;Ley de la Mordaza&quot; (Gag Law) also made it illegal to sing a patriotic song, and reinforced the 1898 law that had made it illegal to display the Flag of Puerto Rico, with anyone found guilty of disobeying the law in any way being subject to a sentence of up to ten years imprisonment, a fine of up to US$10,000 (), or both.

===Events under Commonwealth status===

The Puerto Rican independence movement took new measures after the Free Associate State was authorized. On October 30, 1950, with the new autonomist Commonwealth status about to go into effect, multiple Nationalist uprisings occurred, in an effort to focus world attention on the Movement&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the new commonwealth status.

They catalyzed roughly a dozen skirmishes throughout Puerto Rico including Peñuelas, the Jayuya Uprising, the Utuado Uprising, the San Juan Nationalist revolt, and other shootouts in Mayagüez, Naranjito, and Arecibo. During the 1950 Jayuya Uprising, Blanca Canales declared Puerto Rico a free republic. Two days after the creation of the Commonwealth, two Nationalists attempted to assassinate US President Harry S. Truman in Washington, DC.
Acknowledging the importance of the question of Puerto Rican status, Truman supported a plebiscite in Puerto Rico in 1952 on the new constitution, to determine the status of the island&#x27;s relationship to the U.S. The people voted by nearly 82% in favor of the new constitution and Free Associated State, or Commonwealth. Nationalists criticized the constitution because the Commonwealth was subject to US laws and to approval by the US executive and legislative branches of government, branches which Puerto Ricans did not participate in electing. As the government suppressed the Nationalist leaders, their political activities and influence waned.

In the 1954 United States Capitol shooting incident, four nationalists opened fire on US Representatives during a debate on the floor of the US Congress, wounding five men, one seriously. The Nationalists were tried and convicted in federal court and sentenced effectively to life imprisonment. In 1978 and 1979, their sentences were commuted by President Jimmy Carter to time served, and they were allowed to return to Puerto Rico.

In the 1960s, the United States received international condemnation for holding onto the world&#x27;s oldest colony. By the 1960s, a new phase of the Puerto Rican independence movement began. Several organizations began to use &quot;clandestine armed struggle&quot; against the US government. Underground &quot;people&#x27;s armies&quot; such as &quot;Movimiento Independentista Revolucionario en Armas&quot; (MIRA, in english: Revolutionary Independence Movement in Arms), &quot;Comandos Armados de Liberación&quot; (CAL, in english: Armed Liberation Commands), Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional (FALN, in english: Armed Forces of National Liberation), &quot;Organización de Voluntarios por la Revolución Puertorriqueña&quot; (OVRP, in english: Organization of Volunteers for the Puerto Rican Revolution), The Ejército Popular Boricua (EPB, in english: Boricua Popular Army), and others began engaging in subversive activities against the US government and military to bring attention to the colonial condition of Puerto Rico. In 1977, Rubén Berríos Martínez, then the President of the Puerto Rican Independence Party, wrote a long and detailed article in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; that declared that the &#x27;only solution&#x27; was independence for Puerto Rico.

In January 2025, the CIA admitted in a declassified document that it had collected information on Puerto Rican independence groups at the request of Democratic congressmen, the Central Intelligence Agency probed for links to the Cuban government, and Puerto Rican independence movements in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.

===Political support===
A number of social groups, political parties, and individuals worldwide have supported the concept of Puerto Rican independence. On the island itself, it is a fringe but intense movement, with &quot;The&quot; &quot;Washington Post&quot; reporting that &quot;calls for Puerto Rico&#x27;s independence have existed since the days of Spanish colonial rule and continued after the United States seized control of the island in 1898 (...) although many Puerto Ricans express deep patriotism for the island, the independence impulse has never translated in the polls.&quot;

The Democratic Party in the United States asserted in its 2012 platform that it &quot;will continue to work on improving Puerto Rico&#x27;s economic status by promoting job creation, education, health care, clean energy, and economic development on the Island.&quot; The Republican Party asserts that it &quot;support[s] the right of the United States citizens of Puerto Rico to be admitted to the Union as a fully sovereign state if they freely so determine,&quot; that Congress should &quot;define the constitutionally valid options for Puerto Rico&quot; to gain permanent non-territorial status, and said that, while Puerto Rico&#x27;s status should be supported by a referendum sponsored by &quot;the U.S. government.&quot; Neither of the two major parties in Puerto Rico supports independence: the Popular Democratic Party supports the current status of Puerto Rico as a self-governing unincorporated territory, and the New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico supports statehood.

Minority parties have expressed different positions: in 2005, Communist Party USA passed a resolution about Puerto Rico, condemning American imperialism, while stating that &quot;the Communist Party of the USA continues its support for independence of Puerto Rico and the transfer of all sovereign powers to Puerto Rico.&quot; Their platform supported the people&#x27;s &quot;acquisition of their internationally recognized right to independence and self-determination ...&quot; In 2012, the Green Party of the United States had a platform supporting independence. Socialist Party USA does not support independence for Puerto Rico, but calls for &quot;full representation for the U.S. territories of Guam and Puerto Rico, all Native American reservations, and the District of Columbia.&quot;

During the summit of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States in Havana, Cuba in January 2014, Nicolas Maduro, the President of Venezuela, told &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; that he supported Puerto Rican independence, saying that &quot;it&#x27;s an embarrassment that Latin America and the Caribbean in the 21st century still have colonies. Let the imperial elites of the U.S. say whatever they want.&quot; Also at this summit, the president of Argentina, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, pledged to vote for independence of Puerto Rico; and Raúl Castro &quot;called for an independent Puerto Rico.&quot;

Other individuals and groups supporting Puerto Rican independence have included: poet Martín Espada, professor and writer Jason Ferreira, the group Calle 13, FALN leader Oscar López Rivera, Roberto Barreto, a member of Organizacion Socialista Internacional; Puerto Rican nationalist Carlos Alberto Torres, and US Representative Luis Gutiérrez.

In March 2023, Cuba reiterated its commitment to self-determination and independence of the people of Puerto Rico.

===20th century to present===
Levinson and Sparrow in their 2005 book suggest the Foraker Act (), and the Jones–Shafroth Act () reduced political opposition in the island, as they vested the U.S. Congress with authority and veto power over any legislation or referendum initiated by Puerto Rico.

Founded in 1922, the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party worked for independence. In 1946, Gilberto Concepción de Gracia founded the Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP). It has continued to participate in the island&#x27;s electoral process.

In the mid-century, the &quot;Cointelpro program&quot; was a project conducted by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to surveil, infiltrate, discredit, and disrupt domestic political organizations which it classified as suspect or subversive. The police documented thousands of extensive &quot;carpetas&quot; (files) concerning individuals of all social groups and ages. Approximately 75,000 persons were listed as under political police surveillance. Historians and critics found that the massive surveillance apparatus was directed primarily against Puerto Rico&#x27;s independence movement. As a result, many independence supporters moved to the Popular Democratic Party to support its opposition to statehood.

In the 21st century, a majority of &quot;Independentistas&quot; seek to achieve independence either through peaceful political means or violent revolutionary actions. The Independence Party has elected some legislative candidates, but in recent elections has not won more than a small percentage of votes for its gubernatorial candidates (2.04% in 2008) or the legislative elections (4.5-5% of the island-wide legislative vote in 2008).

In March 2023, a diaspora group petitioned the United States Congress to create an American-Puerto Rican Commission to promote the decolonization and independence of Puerto Rico from the United States of America.

In April 2023, Puerto Rico&#x27;s Status Act, which seeks to resolve its territorial status and relationship with the United States through a binding plebiscite at the federal level, was reintroduced in the House by Democrats..

===United Nations&#x27; view===
Since 1953, the United Nations has been considering the Political status of Puerto Rico and how to assist it in achieving &quot;independence&quot; or &quot;decolonization&quot;. In 1978, the Special Committee determined that a &quot;colonial relationship&quot; existed between the US and Puerto Rico.

Note that the UN&#x27;s Special Committee has often referred to Puerto Rico as a nation in its reports, because, internationally, the people of Puerto Rico are often considered to be a Caribbean nation with their own national identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;United Nations. General Assembly. Special Committee on the Situation With Regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples 1971 https://books.google.com/books?id=4nEyLDpKZjMC&amp;pg=PA10 10–11&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, in a June 2016 report, the Special Committee called for the United States to expedite the process to allow self-determination in Puerto Rico. More specifically, the group called on the United States to expedite a process that would allow the people of Puerto Rico to exercise fully their right to self-determination and independence: &quot;allow the Puerto Rican people to take decisions in a sovereign manner, and to address their urgent economic and social needs, including unemployment, marginalization, insolvency and poverty&quot;.

===2012 status referendum===
The main political parties in Puerto Rico have supported a continuing relationship with the United States and been supported by the electorate. By the 1940s, voters had elected a majority of &quot;Partido Popular Democrático&quot; (PPD) members in the legislature. In 1952, they voted by nearly 82% in support of the new constitution of the &quot;Estado Libre Associado&quot; or Commonwealth. 

Sixty years later, a majority of those who voted on the second question of a 2012 referendum, to indicate what type of arrangement they preferred, voted to seek admission as a state into the United States. 61.16% voted for statehood, 33.34% voted for free association and 5.49% voted for independence. Hundreds of thousands of voters abstained from the question, so the proportion of voters for statehood was actually 45% of the total eligible electorate rather than a majority.

In a status referendum in 2012, which had a two-part vote, 5.5% voted for independence. Analysts noted that the results were ambiguous because of issues related to the structure of questions and supporters of the commonwealth status urging voters to abstain from voting on the second question. Journalist Roque Planas, co-founder of the &quot;Latin American News Dispatch&quot;, wrote as an editor in &quot;HuffPost:&quot;

Similarly, as reported by the &quot;New York Daily News,&quot; Juan Gonzalez, journalist and a co-host of the TV show &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; said:

In October 2013, &quot;The Economist&quot; reported on the island economy&#x27;s &quot;dire financial straits.&quot; Referring to the 2012 referendum, it said that &quot;Puerto Rico is unlikely to become a state any time soon. Because the island remains a territory, the decision is ultimately out of &quot;boricuas&quot;&#x27; hands ... the legislature is highly unlikely to prioritise a Puerto Rican statehood bill ... the Republican Party would surely use every tactic at its disposal to block a statehood bill,&quot; as the island voters have been overwhelmingly supportive of Democratic Party presidential candidates and could be expected to vote for the same party for Congressional seats if statehood were approved by Congress.

The &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported in December 2013 that, since Puerto Ricans became US citizens in 1917, they have &quot;been divided over their relationship with the mainland&quot; on whether to become a US state, become independent, or a self-governing territory under US control.

===2017 status referendum===
The previous plebiscites provided voters with three options: statehood, free association, and independence. The 2017 referendum offered three options: Statehood, Commonwealth and Independence/Free Association. If the majority vote for the latter, a second vote will be held to determine the preference: full independence as a nation or associated free state status with independence but with a &quot;free and voluntary political association&quot; between Puerto Rico and the United States.

The White House Task Force on Puerto Rico offers the following specifics:
&quot;Free Association is a type of independence. A compact of Free Association would establish a mutual agreement that would recognize that the United States and Puerto Rico are closely linked in specific ways as detailed in the compact. Compacts of this sort are based on the national sovereignty of each country, and either nation can unilaterally terminate the association.&quot; The content of the Compact of Free Association might cover topics such as the role of the US military in Puerto Rico, the use of the U.S. currency, free trade between the two entities, and whether Puerto Ricans would be U.S. citizens.

Former Governor Ricardo Rosselló was strongly in favor of statehood to help develop the economy and help to &quot;solve our 500-year-old colonial dilemma ... Colonialism is not an option . ... It&#x27;s a civil rights issue ... 3.5 million citizens seeking an absolute democracy,&quot; he told the news media. Benefits of statehood include an additional $10 billion per year in federal funds, the right to vote in presidential elections, higher Social Security and Medicare benefits, and a right for its government agencies and municipalities to file for bankruptcy. The latter is currently prohibited.

At approximately the same time as the referendum, Puerto Rico&#x27;s legislators voted on a bill that allows the Governor to draft a state constitution and hold elections to choose senators and representatives to the federal Congress. Regardless of the outcome of the 2017 referendum and the bill, action by the United States Congress will be necessary to implement changes to the status of Puerto Rico under the Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution.

===Online rise in reunification with Spain===

In recent years, primarily in online spaces, there has been a growth in support for reunification with Spain rather than statehood, in what is known as Hispanism.

<text>In mathematics, an involute (also known as an evolvent) is a particular type of curve that is dependent on another shape or curve. An involute of a curve is the locus of a point on a piece of taut string as the string is either unwrapped from or wrapped around the curve.

The evolute of an involute is the original curve.

It is generalized by the roulette family of curves. That is, the involutes of a curve are the roulettes of the curve generated by a straight line.

The notions of the involute and evolute of a curve were introduced by Christiaan Huygens in his work titled &quot;Horologium oscillatorium sive de motu pendulorum ad horologia aptato demonstrationes geometricae&quot; (1673), where he showed that the involute of a cycloid is still a cycloid, thus providing a method for constructing the cycloidal pendulum, which has the useful property that its period is independent of the amplitude of oscillation.

== Involute of a parameterized curve ==

Let formula_1 be a regular curve in the plane with its curvature nowhere 0 and formula_2, then the curve with the parametric representation

formula_3

is an &quot;involute&quot; of the given curve.
Adding an arbitrary but fixed number formula_4 to the integral formula_5 results in an involute corresponding to a string extended by formula_4 (like a ball of wool yarn having some length of thread already hanging before it is unwound). Hence, the involute can be varied by constant formula_7 and/or adding a number to the integral (see Involutes of a semicubic parabola).

If formula_8 one gets

:formula_9

== Properties of involutes ==

In order to derive properties of a regular curve it is advantageous to suppose the arc length formula_10 to be the parameter of the given curve, which lead to the following simplifications: formula_11 and formula_12, with formula_13 the curvature and formula_14 the unit normal. One gets for the involute:

:formula_15 and
:formula_16
and the statement: 
*At point formula_17 the involute is &quot;not regular&quot; (because formula_18 ),
and from formula_19 follows:
* The normal of the involute at point formula_20 is the tangent of the given curve at point formula_21.
* The involutes are parallel curves, because of formula_22 and the fact, that formula_23 is the unit normal at formula_24.
The family of involutes and the family of tangents to the original curve makes up an orthogonal coordinate system. Consequently, one may construct involutes graphically. First, draw the family of tangent lines. Then, an involute can be constructed by always staying orthogonal to the tangent line passing the point.

=== Cusps ===
This section is based on.

There are generically two types of cusps in involutes. The first type is at the point where the involute touches the curve itself. This is a cusp of order 3/2. The second type is at the point where the curve has an inflection point. This is a cusp of order 5/2.

This can be visually seen by constructing a map formula_25 defined by formula_26where formula_27 is the arclength parametrization of the curve, and formula_28 is the slope-angle of the curve at the point formula_27. This maps the 2D plane into a surface in 3D space. For example, this maps the circle into the hyperboloid of one sheet.

By this map, the involutes are obtained in a three-step process: map formula_30 to formula_31, then to the surface in formula_32, then project it down to formula_31 by removing the z-axis: formula_34where formula_35 is any real constant.

Since the mapping formula_36 has nonzero derivative at all formula_37, cusps of the involute can only occur where the derivative of formula_36 is vertical (parallel to the z-axis), which can only occur where the surface in formula_32 has a vertical tangent plane.

Generically, the surface has vertical tangent planes at only two cases: where the surface touches the curve, and where the curve has an inflection point.

==== cusp of order 3/2 ====

For the first type, one can start by the involute of a circle, with equationformula_40then set formula_41, and expand for small formula_42, to obtainformula_43thus giving the order 3/2 curve formula_44, a semicubical parabola.

==== cusp of order 5/2 ====

For the second type, consider the curve formula_45. The arc from formula_46 to formula_47 is of length formula_48, and the tangent at formula_47 has angle formula_50. Thus, the involute starting from formula_46 at distance formula_52 has parametric formulaformula_53Expand it up to order formula_54, we obtainformula_55which is a cusp of order 5/2. Explicitly, one may solve for the polynomial expansion satisfied by formula_56:formula_57or formula_58which clearly shows the cusp shape.

Setting formula_59, we obtain the involute passing the origin. It is special as it contains no cusp. By serial expansion, it has parametric equationformula_60or formula_61

== Examples ==

=== Involutes of a circle ===

For a circle with parametric representation formula_62, one has
formula_63.
Hence formula_64, and the path length is formula_65. 

Evaluating the above given equation of the involute, one gets
:formula_66
for the parametric equation of the involute of the circle.

The formula_7 term is optional; it serves to set the start location of the curve on the circle. The figure shows involutes for formula_68 (green), formula_41 (red), formula_70 (purple) and formula_71 (light blue). The involutes look like Archimedean spirals, but they are actually not.

The arc length for formula_72 and formula_73 of the involute is
: formula_74

=== Involutes of a semicubic parabola ===
The parametric equation formula_75 describes a semicubical parabola. From formula_76 one gets formula_77 and formula_78. Extending the string by formula_79 extensively simplifies further calculation, and one gets
: formula_80

Eliminating yields formula_81 showing that this involute is a parabola. 

The other involutes are thus parallel curves of a parabola, and are not parabolas, as they are curves of degree six (See ).
=== Involutes of a catenary ===
For the catenary formula_82, the tangent vector is formula_83, and, as formula_84 its length is formula_85. Thus the arc length from the point is formula_86

Hence the involute starting from is parametrized by
: formula_87
and is thus a tractrix.

The other involutes are not tractrices, as they are parallel curves of a tractrix.

=== Involutes of a cycloid ===

The parametric representation formula_88 describes a cycloid. From formula_89, one gets (after having used some trigonometric formulas)
:formula_90 
and 
:formula_91 

Hence the equations of the corresponding involute are
: formula_92
: formula_93
which describe the shifted red cycloid of the diagram. Hence

* The involutes of the cycloid formula_94 are parallel curves of the cycloid 
: formula_95
(Parallel curves of a cycloid are not cycloids.)

== Involute and evolute ==
The evolute of a given curve formula_96 consists of the curvature centers of formula_96. Between involutes and evolutes the following statement holds:

:&quot;A curve is the evolute of any of its involutes.&quot;
==Application==
The most common profiles of modern gear teeth are involutes of a circle. In an involute gear system, the teeth of two meshing gears contact at a single instantaneous point that follows along a single straight line of action. The forces the contacting teeth exert on each other also follow this line and are normal to the teeth. The involute gear system maintaining these conditions follows the fundamental law of gearing: the ratio of angular velocities between the two gears must remain constant throughout.

With teeth of other shapes, the relative speeds and forces rise and fall as successive teeth engage, resulting in vibration, noise, and excessive wear. For this reason, nearly all modern planar gear systems are either involute or the related cycloidal gear system.
The involute of a circle is also an important shape in gas compressing, as a scroll compressor can be built based on this shape. Scroll compressors make less sound than conventional compressors and have proven to be quite efficient.

The High Flux Isotope Reactor uses involute-shaped fuel elements, since these allow a constant-width channel between them for coolant.

<text>James Wilson Morrice (August 10, 1865 – January 23, 1924) was one of the first Canadian landscape painters to be known internationally. In 1891, he moved to Paris, France, where he lived for most of his career. W. Somerset Maugham knew him and had one of his characters say, ...when you&#x27;ve seen his sketches...you can never see Paris in the same way again.

In Canada, James Morrice Street in New Bordeaux, Ahuntsic-Cartierville, Montreal is named in his memory. 

==Biography==
Morrice was born in Montreal, Canada East, the son of a merchant, and studied law in Toronto from 1882 to 1889. In 1890 he left to study painting in England. The next year he arrived in Paris, where he studied at the Académie Julian from 1892 to 1897. At the Académie Julian, he befriended Charles Conder and Maurice Prendergast, and also met Robert Henri. Also in 1896, he began to paint his small sketches on wooden panels, called &quot;pochades&quot;. He then took lessons at the atelier of Henri Harpignies, who encouraged his students to paint en plein air.

Morrice continued to live in Paris until the First World War, although he spent most of his winters in Canada and travelled widely abroad. He was influenced by the art work he saw in Paris such as the Fauves at the 1905 Salon d&#x27;Automne, (which he participated in) while also remaining in touch with the Canadian art world. He joined the Canadian Art Club in Toronto (1907).

During this period he was also in contact with the literary milieu, with English expatriate intellectuals living in Paris, such as W. Somerset Maugham, Arnold Bennett, and Clive Bell. In 1911, he wrote Edmund Morris that there was excitement in London over the &quot;Post-Impressionism&quot; exhibition. As he wrote,Everybody laughed and jeered but with a few exceptions it consisted of good things - art that will last. In the winters of 1912 and 1912-1913, he stayed in Tangiers. His second trip coincided with a trip by Matisse whom he met and with whom he exchanged ideas about art. He was elected an honorary non-resident member of the Royal Canadian Academy in 1913.

With the advent of World War I, Morrice went to Montreal, and then to Cuba. There he began to succumb to alcoholism. The output of his last period is uneven and infrequent. In the summer of 1922 he travelled to Algiers, where he painted with Albert Marquet. This would be the last time that he painted, as his health began to rapidly deteriorate. He died, aged 58, in Tunis.

==Gallery==
Morrice&#x27;s paintings before the turn of the century are thinly painted and inspired by Whistler, both in sentiment and in treatment of colour. Just prior to World War I he began to paint, in a thicker style, winter Canadian scenes influenced by the Impressionists and particularly by Maurice Cullen, whom he met in 1897. In 1905, he would have seen Fauvist paintings in the Salon d&#x27;Automne and been influenced by their pure, bright hues. Some of his works during his Caribbean period are considered his best and are painted in a loose style influenced by Post-Impressionism and suggest artists such as Matisse. 

He is noted for his sense of observation and ability to distill the essence of what he saw in his work, often in &quot;pochades&quot;, little sketches. Morrice&#x27;s images of café culture, or other public gatherings, including seasonal &quot;fêtes,&quot; regatta or circus scenes, remain unique in Canadian art&quot;, as one curator writes. &quot;The artist with the delicate eye&quot;, Matisse called him in 1925.

==Recognition and legacy==
In 1958, works by Morrice along with those of Jacques de Tonnancour, Anne Kahane and Jack Nichols represented Canada at the Venice Biennale.

The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts is one of the two main repositories of his work along with the National Gallery of Canada. Montrealers David Rousseau Morrice (1903-1978) and F. Eleanore Morrice (1901-1981) willed to the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts many works of art they had collected during their lives, published as &quot;A Montreal Collection: Gift From Eleanore and David Morrice&quot; and exhibited at the Museum in 1983. Several significant gifts have enhanced the National Gallery&#x27;s collection, enhanced by major publications such as Charles C. Hill&#x27;s &quot;Morrice A Gift to the Nation The G. Blair Laing Collection&quot; (1992). In 2016, Ash K. Prakash gave the National Gallery a major collection of Morrice, which the National Gallery exhibited as &quot;James Wilson Morrice: The A.K. Prakash Collection in Trust to the Nation&quot; (2017) and travelled nationally (2018-2019). In 2023, the major book &quot;James Wilson Morrice: paintings and drawings of Venice&quot; by Sandra Paikowsky was published.

<text>Charles Morris (July 26, 1784 – January 27, 1856) was an American naval officer whose service extended through the first half of the 19th century.

==Biography==
Morris was born in Woodstock, Connecticut on July 26, 1784. After being appointed a midshipman in July 1799, he served in the Quasi-War with France, First Barbary War, the Second Barbary War, and the War of 1812. He was promoted to captain in March 1813. He served as a Navy Commissioner from 1823 to 1827, and as the Chief of the Bureau of Construction, Equipment, and Repairs from 1844 to 1847.

In 1812, Morris was appointed first lieutenant of under the command of Isaac Hull during her battle with , in which action Morris was severely wounded. He was promoted to captain on March 3, 1813. In 1814, he commanded in raiding expeditions against British commerce. Cornered in the Penobscot River in Maine by a British squadron under Captain Robert Barrie, Morris and his men went ashore with their cannons and, assisted by local militia attempted to hold off the British amphibious force in the Battle of Hampden. The British regulars routed the Americans, however, and Morris and his crew had to burn the ship and escape overland to Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

In 1819 after protracted negotiation, the government of Venezuela granted all the demands of the United States on 11 August negotiated by Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry. However, during the passage down the Orinoco River, Perry was stricken with yellow fever and died on board .

Morris succeeded Perry in command of the squadron and USS &quot;John Adams&quot; accompanied his flagship on a voyage to the Plata River to continue the negotiations inaugurated by Perry to establish friendly relations with the new Latin American republics and to protect American commerce from South American privateers. After visiting Montevideo and Buenos Aires, both ships returned to the United States, arriving at Hampton Roads on 24 April 1820.

In 1835, his daughter Louise eloped and married William Wilson Corcoran, a banker and philanthropist living in Washington, D.C.

In his later career, Morris commanded the Mediterranean Squadron and served as the chief of the Bureau of Ordnance. He was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1840.

Charles Morris died at his home in Washington, D.C., on January 27, 1856, from a lung ailment. At the time of his death, he was the second highest-ranking officer in the Navy after Charles Stewart. He was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C., near the large family mausoleum built by his son-in-law, William Wilson Corcoran. Corcoran paid for a large, decorative headstone to be placed at the grave.

==Family==
Charles Morris was married to Harriet Bowen in February 1815. They had four sons and six daughters. His eldest son, Charles W. Morris served in the United States Navy during the Mexican–American War. As a flag lieutenant under Commodore David Connor he died from wounds received in an attack on Tabasco, October 1846. Another son Brevet Lieutenant Colonel Robert Murray Morris, served as an officer in the U.S. Army from 1846 to 1873, distinguishing himself at Contreras and Chepultapec in the Mexican–American War and at Valverde and the Battle of Dinwiddie Court House the American Civil War. His youngest son, Commander George Upham Morris also served in the United States Navy from 1846 to 1874, in the Mexican–American War and in American Civil War where he commanded in its engagement with , June 8, 1862.

==Namesakes==

<text>Edward Taylor (1642 – June 29, 1729) was a colonial American poet, pastor and physician of English origin. His work remained unpublished for some 200 years but since then has established him as one of the foremost writers of his time. His poetry has been characterized as &quot;American Baroque&quot; as well as Metaphysical.

==Life==
The son of a nonconformist yeoman farmer, Taylor is thought to have been born in 1642 at Sketchley, Leicestershire. There is conflicting evidence in regard to the dates and locations of events in his early life, but he grew up during the Commonwealth of England and under the influence of his father became a convinced Protestant Dissenter. His childhood was spent on the family farm where he enjoyed the stability of a middle-class upbringing. His later writings are full of influences from his farmhouse childhood, both as regards imagery, and in the occasional use of the Leicestershire dialect.

Taylor&#x27;s mother and father died in 1657 and 1658, respectively. He continued to develop alone and the extent of his formal education is unknown. For some time he worked as schoolmaster at Bagworth but following the restoration of the monarchy, Taylor refused to sign the Act of Uniformity requiring worship according the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, which cost him his teaching position. It was at this point that he began to write poetry in which he continued to lament the loss of religious freedoms after he emigrated to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in America in 1668.

Taylor&#x27;s Atlantic crossing and subsequent years (from April 26, 1668, to July 5, 1671) are chronicled in his now-published &quot;Diary.&quot; Just two weeks after landing in Boston, he was admitted to Harvard College as a second year student to prepare himself for ordination, studying a variety of topics and languages. Upon graduation in 1671 his first choice was to stay at university and become a resident scholar. But just a week later he accepted the call to serve as pastor and physician at Westfield, on the remote western frontier of Massachusetts, where he remained until his death 58 years later.

As a physician, Taylor was a follower of Parcelsus, as evidenced by the books known to be in his library. He left a hand-written record of remedies in his &#x27;dispensatory&#x27;. These included botanicals after the fashion of Nicholas Culpepper and many agents of animal tissue origin, including some derived from mummia, or &quot;The Deade body or flesh.&quot; The practice of &#x27;medical cannibalism&#x27; has been compared to Puritan attitudes toward the eucharist. 

He was twice married: first to Elizabeth Fitch, by whom he had eight children, five of whom died in childhood; and at her death to Ruth Wyllys, who bore him six more children. Taylor died in Westfield on June 29, 1729.

==Poetry==
Taylor&#x27;s poems, in leather bindings of his own manufacture, survived him, but he had left explicit instructions that his heirs should never publish any of his writings and the poems remained all but forgotten for more than 200 years. In 1937 Thomas H. Johnson discovered a 7,000-page quarto manuscript of Taylor&#x27;s poetry in the library of Yale University and published a selection from it in &quot;The New England Quarterly&quot;. The appearance of these poems, wrote Taylor&#x27;s biographer Norman S. Grabo, &quot;established [Taylor] almost at once and without quibble as not only America&#x27;s finest colonial poet, but as one of the most striking writers in the whole range of American literature.&quot; His most important poems, the first sections of &quot;Preparatory Meditations&quot; (1682–1725) and &quot;God&#x27;s Determinations Touching His Elect and the Elects Combat in Their Conversion and Coming up to God in Christ: Together with the Comfortable Effects Thereof&quot; (c. 1680), were published shortly after their discovery. His complete poems, however, were not published until 1960, by Donald E. Stanford.

Taylor&#x27;s poems were an expression of his deeply held religious views, acquired during a strict upbringing and shaped in adulthood by New England Congregationalist Puritans, who during the 1630s and 1640s developed rules far more demanding than those of their co-religionists in England. Alarmed by a perceived lapse in piety of those in his congregation, he concluded that professing belief and leading a scandal-free life were insufficient for full participation in the local assembly. To become communing participants, &quot;halfway members&quot; were required to relate by testimony some personal experience of God&#x27;s saving grace leading to conversion, thus affirming that they were, in their own opinion and that of the church, assured of salvation. This requirement, expressed in the famous Halfway Covenant of 1662, was readily embraced by Taylor, who became one of its most vocal advocates.

Taylor&#x27;s poems are marked by a robust spiritual content, conveyed by means of homely and vivid imagery derived from everyday Puritan surroundings and glorifying the Christian experience. Written in conjunction with his sermons, his &quot;Meditations&quot; each explore scriptural themes and passages, often showing Taylor&#x27;s own deep understanding of doctrine, as well as his struggle with some of the contradictions within strict Puritanism. His poetry is full of his expression of love of God and of his commitment to serve his creator amid the isolation of rural life. &quot;Taylor transcended his frontier circumstances,&quot; biographer Grabo observed, &quot;not by leaving them behind, but by transforming them into intellectual, aesthetic, and spiritual universals.&quot;

===Interpretation===
When a first selection of his work was published, he was called simply “A Puritan sacred poet”. Soon after, however, he was being described as “an American metaphysical” and his poetry typified as ‘Colonial Baroque’. In his work appear such typically Baroque elements as acrostic verse, word play and use of conceits, as well as spoken meditations reminiscent of George Herbert. A later study compared his approach to that of such Baroque Poets as Giambattista Marino and Francisco de Quevedo, who in his time were influencing the Spanish-language poets of the New World.

==Musical settings==
Gerald Finzi made two settings from Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Meditations&quot;. The first (op. 27.1) was the final stanza of Meditation 12, “Glorious in his apparel&quot;, which was composed as a marriage anthem for his sister-in-law in September 1946. The second (op. 27.2) was a setting of two internal stanzas from Meditation 20, “God is gone up with a triumphant shout”, commissioned for the 1951 St. Cecilia Festival Service at St.Sepulchre’s Church, Holborn.

Two settings have been made of Taylor&#x27;s poem &quot;Huswifery&quot;. That by Richard K. Winslow (b.1918) for chorus and piano was the winner of the American Music Competition of the Sigma Alpha Iota music fraternity in 1950. It was later set for a cappella chorus by Gordon Binkerd in 1970. Binkerd had earlier set “The Ebb and Flow” for a cappella chorus in 1966. In addition, the meditation &quot;What Love Is This&quot; was set as an anthem for four-part chorus and organ by Timothy Hoekman in 1978.

<doc id="840720" wikidata="Q466252" url="?curid=840720" title="Margaret III, Countess of Flanders">
<text>Margaret III (13 April 1350 – 16/21 March 1405) was a ruling Countess of Flanders, Countess of Artois, and Countess of Auvergne and Boulogne between 1384 and 1405. She was the last Countess of Flanders of the House of Dampierre. 

She was also Duchess of Burgundy by marriage to Philip I, Duke of Burgundy and Philip II, Duke of Burgundy.

==Biography==

Margaret was the only surviving child and heir of Count Louis II of Flanders (1346–1384) and Margaret of Brabant. 

===First marriage===
In 1355, Margaret of Flanders married Philip of Rouvres, grandson and heir of Odo IV, Duke of Burgundy. Philip was Count of Burgundy and Artois (1347–1361), Duke of Burgundy (1350–1361), and became Count of Auvergne and Boulogne (1360–1361). 

===Second marriage===
Following Philip&#x27;s death from a riding accident in 1361, Margaret was widowed and had no issue by him. King John II of France then claimed the Duchy of Burgundy for the kingdom of France, by escheat. In 1364, Philip the Bold, King John&#x27;s youngest son, was granted the duchy, and subsequently married Margaret. Margaret&#x27;s second marriage to Philip the Bold took place in 1369.

===Ruling Countess===
When Margaret&#x27;s father, the Count of Flanders, died in 1384, she and Philip inherited the counties of Artois, Burgundy, Flanders, Nevers, and Rethel. Philip died in 1404, and Margaret died the following year. 

With her death, the House of Dampierre came to an end, and the County of Flanders lost its (relative) independence to Burgundy. It came under the rule of her son, John the Fearless, and later to the House of Habsburg.

==Issue==

Margaret and Philip had the following children:
* John I of Burgundy, Duke of Burgundy (1371–1419, murdered at Montereau), her eldest son and successor in Flanders, Artois, and Burgundy.
* Charles of Burgundy (1372–1373)
* Margaret of Burgundy (October 1374 – March 8, 1441, Le Quesnoy), married William II, Duke of Bavaria.
* Louis of Burgundy (1377–1378)
* Catherine of Burgundy (April 1378, Montbard – January 24, 1425, Gray, Haute-Saône), married Leopold IV, Duke of Austria.
* Bonne of Burgundy (1379–1399, Arras)
* Mary of Burgundy (September 1380, Dijon – October 2, 1422, Thonon-les-Bains), married Amadeus VIII, Duke of Savoy 
* Antoine of Burgundy, Duke of Brabant (August, 1384 – October 25, 1415, at the Battle of Agincourt.)
* Philip II, Count of Nevers and Rethel (1389–1415, at the Battle of Agincourt.), as &quot;Philip II&quot;.

==Legacy==

The main line of the House of Dampierre ended with Margaret III. The Dampierres, originally only counts of Flanders, had through a clever marriage policy managed to inherit the counties of Nevers (1280) and Rethel (1328). Through her grandmother, a daughter of King Philip V of France, the counties of Artois and Burgundy (the &quot;Franche Comté&quot;) were added to this (1382). These lands were to provide the core of the dominions of the House of Valois-Burgundy, which were, together with the Duchy of Burgundy, to provide them with a power base to challenge the rule of their cousins, the Valois kings of France in the 15th century.

Her eldest son, John the Fearless, succeeded her father Louis as Count of Nevers in 1384, her husband in 1404 as Duke of Burgundy and as Count of Burgundy, Count of Artois, and Count of Flanders. In 1406 her younger son Anthony inherited Brabant and Limburg. Nevers and Rethel were at first, in her lifetime, given to her eldest sons John (Nevers) and Anthony (Rethel), but after John&#x27;s accession to the duchy, Nevers went to her youngest son Philip. Rethel was given to Philip in 1402 when it became clear that Anthony would inherit Brabant.

==Residences==

In Burgundy, the Château de Germolles, offered to Margaret of Flanders by Philip the Bold in 1381, was transformed by the Duchess of Burgundy into a sumptuous country estate. It was a large rectangular building, surrounded by a moat, that enclosed a courtyard. The south and east wings contained the living apartments, while the west wing held the reception rooms. Margaret, being energetic and a country lover, decided to develop at the estate some rustic activities that would create a pleasant environment around this favourite residence of hers, as well as developing local agriculture and providing some income for the maintenance of the domain. Thus, she planted a large rose garden, and the petals were sent to Flanders to be used to make rose water. Largely preserved, the Château is today one of the best examples of the princely residences in France at the end of the Middle Ages.

<doc id="840726" wikidata="Q5545192" url="?curid=840726" title="George Thomson (musician)">
<text>George Thomson (1757–1851) was a Scottish music publisher and a friend of Robert Burns. He was clerk to the board of trustees in Edinburgh for 60 years. His &quot;A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs for the Voice&quot; came out in six volumes between 1793 and 1841, and included contributions from Burns, Lord Byron, Thomas Moore, Walter Scott and Thomas Campbell. Thomson published folksong arrangements by Joseph Haydn, Ludwig van Beethoven, Ignaz Pleyel, Leopold Kozeluch, Johann Nepomuk Hummel, Carl Maria von Weber, Henry Rowley Bishop, and Robert Archibald Smith.

==Early life==

George Thomson was born in 1757 in Limekilns, Dunfermline. His father was a schoolmaster at Limekilns and had some legal training. In 1780, Thomson gained a clerical appointment with the Board of Manufactures on the recommendation of John Home, and spent the rest of his career with this body, eventually rising to the position of Chief Clerk. He joined the Edinburgh Musical Society, playing the violin in the orchestra and singing in the choir. For 59 years he worked for the Board of Trustees for the Encouragement of Art and Manufactures in Scotland. His daughter Georgina was the wife of editor and music publisher George Hogarth, and his granddaughter Catherine married novelist Charles Dickens.

==Collection of Scots songs==
Thomson played in the orchestra of the St Cecilia Concerts, enjoying performances of Scots songs by Italian castrati visiting Scotland. This gave him the idea of bringing out a collection of Scots songs with new accompaniments and respectable words. In the summer of 1792 he got Andrew Erskine, younger brother of the composer the Earl of Kellie, to take part in the project, but about fifteen months later Erskine, with gambling debts, ended his life by jumping into the Firth of Forth.

To continue the project Thomson asked Alexander Cunningham for a letter of introduction to Robert Burns and in September 1792 sent it with his letter stating that 

Burns was already a contributor to James Johnson&#x27;s &quot;The Scots Musical Museum&quot; and agreed to do the work, but indignantly added that &quot;In the honest enthusiasm with which I embark in your undertaking, to talk of money, wages, fee, hire, etc. could be downright Sodomy of Soul! A proof of each of the Songs that I compose or amend, I shall receive as a favour.&quot;

==&quot;Select Scottish Airs&quot;==
The first part of Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Select Scottish Airs&quot;, brought out in June 1793, contained 25 songs by Burns. Thomson sent him a copy and, with the note that &quot;&quot;you must suffer me to enclose a small mark of my gratitude, and to repeat it–afterwards when I find it convenient&quot; a five-pound note. Burns responded indignantly 
Thomson did not attempt again to make payments until, close to the end of his life, the dying poet desperately begged him for a further five pounds.

Burns gave his congratulations on the elegant appearance of the book, and Thomson soon decided, with the aid of his willing collaborator, to include &quot;every Scottish air and song worth singing&quot;&quot;.

Burns kept on providing songs until a few days before his death, and became involved in a lot of correspondence with Thomson, responding to editorial suggestions and justifying reasons for altering an old song or writing a new song to a particular tune. This gives a valuable insight into his approach to Scots song. Once Burns had stated his wishes Thomson rarely argued back, but sometimes made alterations without consulting the poet and ignored the request of Burns to return unsuitable songs for Johnson to put into print. Burns made it clear that in giving one edition of his songs he was not giving away his copyright. Alternative English language versions of the songs were provided by John Wolcot under the pen name of &quot;Peter Pindar&quot;, but after he withdrew in August 1793 Thomson persuaded Burns to produce the English verses as well as his Scots language lyrics.

Thomson frequently suggested &quot;improvements&quot; which Burns rejected. A particular instance was &quot;Scots Wha Hae&quot; where Thomson insisted on an alternative to the familiar tune, and had Burns alter his stanzas to suit, but was later forced by public pressure to restore the original version.

<text>Glenn Edgar Morris (June 18, 1912 – January 31, 1974) was a U.S. track and field athlete. He won a gold medal in the Olympic decathlon in 1936, setting new world and Olympic records. He attended Colorado A&amp;M — now known as Colorado State University — and played football as well as track and field. He was also an occasional actor, he portrayed Tarzan in &quot;Tarzan&#x27;s Revenge&quot;.

==Biography==
Born on his family&#x27;s homestead farm near Simla, Colorado, Morris was the second of seven children. A natural athlete whose record in the hurdles stood for forty years at his high school, Morris entered Colorado Agricultural College (now Colorado State University) at Fort Collins in 1930, and became a star athlete, excelling in several sports and being named All-American in track and field. Working as an assistant coach and automobile salesman after graduation in 1934 (with degrees in economics and sociology), Morris began training as a decathlon athlete in hopes of competing in the 1936 Olympics.

In the U.S. Olympic track and field trials in 1936, Morris scored a new world record of 7,880 points, earning him Newsweek&#x27;s sobriquet &quot;the nation&#x27;s new Iron Man.&quot; Morris broke his own world record, and the Olympic record, in the Berlin games, with a decathlon score of 7,900 points. It was said that Adolf Hitler never left his seat while Morris was competing, and that the Germans thereafter offered Morris $50,000 to stay in Germany and appear in sports films, an offer Morris refused.

German filmmaker and documentarian Leni Riefenstahl claimed in her memoirs that during and after the 1936 Olympics, she had an affair with Morris, which she ended because of a very disparaging report about him that was given to her by a graphologist. Riefenstahl also claimed that the affair began when, after winning the gold medal, he tore off her blouse and kissed her breasts, in front of the audience of 100,000 people. In reality, Morris merely received his medal and laurel from Hitler&#x27;s mistress Eva Braun in an otherwise standard ceremony. Part two of Riefenstahl&#x27;s film &quot;Olympia&quot; included a segment documenting Morris&#x27;s decathlon triumph.

Morris&#x27; success at the 1936 Olympics resulted in a brief flurry of fame, including a New York City ticker-tape parade and a statewide Colorado celebration. He received the 1936 James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States, and he had a short stint as an NBC radio commentator.

In November 1937, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released the ten-minute short film &quot;Decathlon Champion: The Story of Glenn Morris&quot;, depicting how he trained for and won the decathlon event. Morris portrayed himself in the film, before becoming the fourth Olympic athlete to play Tarzan. He appeared in only one Tarzan film, &quot;Tarzan&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (1938), an inexpensive independent film produced by Sol Lesser and released by Twentieth Century Fox. Reviews for the film cited both the silliness of the production and the exaggerated acting of the theatrically untrained Morris (though Variety called him &quot;a highly acceptable Tarzan&quot;). After only one minor additional film role, in the 1938 comedy &quot;Hold That Co-ed&quot;, Morris left the movie business forever.

Morris played four games with the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL) in 1940 before injury curtailed this new career, then worked as an insurance agent.

During World War II, he served as an officer in the U.S. Navy and was stationed in the Pacific, commanding amphibious-assault landing craft. Reportedly wounded, Morris was treated for psychological-trauma issues and spent several months in a naval hospital.

==Later life==
Following his release from duty, Morris worked for a dozen years in construction and as a steel rigger for the Atomic Energy Commission. Subsequently, he may have worked off and on as a parking lot attendant, and he was rumored to have been an alcoholic. He lived out his last years mostly in Menlo Park, California, and as a patient in veterans hospitals. Too ill to attend his induction into the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame in 1967, where he was proclaimed &quot;the world&#x27;s greatest athlete,&quot; Morris nevertheless donated his Olympic gold medal to the Hall. The medal was subsequently given, along with Morris&#x27;s other memorabilia, to Simla High School, which gives an annual Glenn Morris Award for athletic and academic excellence; the school, in turn, donated the medal in April 2011 to Colorado State University, the successor to Morris&#x27; college alma mater, where it is displayed in the Iris and Michael Smith Alumni Building.

At age 61 in 1974, Morris died of congestive heart failure &quot;and other complications&quot; at the veterans&#x27; hospital in Palo Alto, California, and was buried in Skylawn Memorial Park in nearby San Mateo.

He was married from 1937 to 1940 to Charlotte Edwards, whom he had met in college.

==Books==
* In 2003, author Mike Chapman wrote “The Gold and The Glory: The Amazing True Story of Glenn Morris, Olympic Champion and Movie Tarzan”. The foreword was written by Bob Mathias, Olympic decathlon champion in 1948 and 1952, and the book has over 120 photos, ranging from Morris&#x27;s high school days up through college, the Olympics, Hollywood, and his service as a Naval officer in World War II.
* A 2013 novel &quot;Olympic Affair&quot; was published by Terry Frei in which he depicts the life of Morris, and Frei imagines what the affair with Leni Riefenstahl was like.

<text>Michael Morris, Baron Morris and 1st Baron Killanin, (14 November 1826 – 8 September 1901), known as Sir Michael Morris, Bt, from 1885 to 1889, was an Irish lawyer and judge. He was Lord Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench for Ireland from 1887 to 1889 and sat in the House of Lords as a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary from 1889 to 1900.

==Background and education==
Born in Galway, eldest son of Martin Morris and Julia Blake, Morris was educated at Galway College and Trinity College Dublin, graduating BA in 1847. His father was a justice of the peace, and in 1841 became the first Roman Catholic to be High Sheriff of Galway Town, an office his son also held. The Morrises were a long-established merchant family, who were one of the fourteen Tribes of Galway who dominated the town&#x27;s commercial life. His mother, a doctor&#x27;s daughter, died of cholera in 1837.

==Legal and judicial career==
After being called to the Irish bar in 1849, Morris was appointed High Sheriff of Galway Town for 1849–50. Eight years later he was made Recorder of Galway, and in 1863 became one of the country&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Counsels. He was the recognized leader of the Connacht Bar, impressing clients and juries alike with his wit and commonsense. Elected to Parliament in 1865 as Liberal member for Galway, Morris became a Conservative the following year when he took office in Lord Derby&#x27;s administration as Solicitor-General for Ireland. Though a Roman Catholic he was a staunch supporter of the Act of Union 1800, but it is said that he was not enthusiastic about the Reform Act 1867. In late 1866 he was appointed Attorney-General for Ireland, and the following year became third Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, eventually being made its Chief Justice in 1876. As a judge, he showed the same wit and commonsense which had been his hallmarks at the Bar, and was notably impatient of legal technicalities.

In 1885, Morris was created a Baronet, of Spiddal in the County of Galway, and two years later he was appointed Lord Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench for Ireland. In 1889, on being made a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, he was given a life peerage as Baron Morris, of Spiddal in the County of Galway, and sworn a member of the Privy Council. He was well regarded by his fellow Law Lords, despite his frequent dissenting judgments.

Eleven years later, on his retirement from office, Lord Morris was made an hereditary peer as Baron Killanin, of Galway in the County of Galway.

===Judgements===
*&quot;British South Africa Co v Companhia de Moçambique&quot; [1893] AC 602 – the House of Lords overturned a Court of Appeal decision and by so doing established the &quot;Mozambique rule&quot;, a common law rule in private international law that renders actions relating to title in foreign land, the right to possession of foreign land, and trespass to foreign land non-justiciable in common law jurisdictions.
*Harvey v Facey, 1893

==Family==

Lord Morris died at Spiddal in September 1901, aged 74, and was buried in the family vault in Bohermore Cemetery at Galway.

He married, in 1860, Anna Hughes, daughter of Henry George Hughes, Baron of the Court of Exchequer and his wife Sarah Isabella l&#x27;Estrange. She was the child of a mixed marriage, and had been brought up in the Church of Ireland. They had four sons and six daughters. The eldest son Martin Morris was an MP and succeeded in the barony of Killanin and baronetcy.

Another son was Lt. Col. George Henry Morris, who was the first commanding officer to lead an Irish Guards battalion into battle and was killed in action during the Retreat from Mons in September 1914. George&#x27;s son Michael went on to serve as the sixth President of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) from 1972 to 1980. He succeeded his uncle Martin as Baron Killanin in 1927.

<text>M.I.U. Album is the 22nd studio album by the American rock band the Beach Boys, released on September 25, 1978. Characterized for its easy-listening sound, the album was produced by Al Jardine and touring member Ron Altbach during one of the most acrimonious periods in the band&#x27;s history. It sold poorly, peaking at number 151 in the U.S, and was met with confused reactions from critics and fans.

The album was created to fulfill contractual obligations to Reprise Records after the group had shelved &quot;Adult/Child&quot;. It was largely recorded in late 1977 at its namesake: Maharishi International University in Fairfield, Iowa. Only Jardine, Mike Love, and Brian Wilson appear consistently throughout the album, with Carl and Dennis Wilson&#x27;s contributions confined to a pair of tracks. Brian was credited as &quot;executive producer&quot;. It includes the songs &quot;Hey Little Tomboy&quot;, the only track salvaged from &quot;Adult/Child&quot;, and &quot;My Diane&quot;, written about Brian&#x27;s affair with his sister-in-law, as well as cover versions of the 1950s hits &quot;Peggy Sue&quot; and &quot;Come Go with Me&quot;.

&quot;M.I.U.&quot; continues to be widely regarded as one of the worst Beach Boys albums. In 1981, &quot;Come Go with Me&quot; reached number 18 when it was issued as a single from the compilation &quot;Ten Years of Harmony&quot;. In 1998, several songs that were intended for the unreleased album &quot;Merry Christmas from the Beach Boys&quot;, which was produced during the &quot;M.I.U.&quot; sessions, were released on the compilation &quot;Ultimate Christmas&quot;.

==Background==

At the beginning of 1977, the Beach Boys had enjoyed their most lucrative concert tours ever, with the band playing in packed stadiums and earning up to $150,000 per show. Early that year, Brian Wilson produced &quot;Adult/Child&quot;, which would have been their final record on Reprise, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. It was largely recorded by Brian with Dennis and Carl while Al Jardine and Mike Love were preoccupied elsewhere. In Love&#x27;s case, he had been ensconced at a six-month Transcendental Meditation retreat, called &quot;the TM-Sidhi program&quot;, in Vittel, France and Leysin, Switzerland, where he studied levitation under Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.

Concurrently, the band were the subject of a record company bidding war, as their contract with Warner had been set to expire soon. Band manager and business advisor Stephen Love arranged for the Beach Boys to sign an $8 million deal with CBS Records on March 1. Biographer Steven Gaines writes that Warner &quot;knew of the CBS deal&quot; and were &quot;so disgusted with the band at this point&quot; that the label refused to promote the group&#x27;s forthcoming album, &quot;The Beach Boys Love You&quot;. Within weeks of the CBS contract, Stephen was effectively fired by the band, with one of the alleged reasons being that Mike had not permitted Stephen to sign on his behalf while in Switzerland. Mike and Jardine also vetoed the release of &quot;Adult/Child&quot; due to its bizarre content and the commercial failure of &quot;Love You&quot;, issued in April.

Stephen&#x27;s replacement was entertainment business owner Henry Lazarus, who arranged a major European tour for the Beach Boys starting in June. The tour was cancelled prematurely, as Lazarus had failed to complete the necessary paperwork. This resulted in the group being sued by many of the concert promoters, with losses of $200,000 in preliminary expenses and $550,000 in potential revenue. In August, Mike and Jardine persuaded Stephen to return as the group&#x27;s manager, a decision that Carl and Dennis had strongly opposed. On September 1, the internal wrangling came to a head after a show at Central Park, when the band effectively split into two camps: Dennis and Carl on one side, Mike and Jardine on the other, with Brian remaining neutral. By then, the two opposing contingents within the group – known among their associates as the &quot;free-livers&quot; and the &quot;meditators&quot; – were traveling in different planes, using different hotels, and rarely speaking to each other.

On September 2, Mike, Jardine, and Brian met with Stephen at their hotel in New York and signed the documents necessary to officially appoint him as the Beach Boys&#x27; manager. The next day, after completing the final date of a northeastern tour, a confrontation between the &quot;free-livers&quot; and the &quot;meditators&quot; broke out on an airport tarmac during a stopover in Newark. Dennis subsequently declared to a bystanding &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; journalist that he had left the band. In a follow-up interview, Love denied that the group had broken up, but Dennis maintained, &quot;I can assure you that the group broke up and you witnessed it.&quot; However, the group were still legally obligated to deliver one more album to Warner. Two weeks later, on September 17, the band members, their lawyers, and their wives reconvened at Brian&#x27;s house, where they negotiated a settlement resulting in Mike gaining control of Brian&#x27;s vote in the group, allowing Mike and Jardine to outvote Carl and Dennis on any matter.

==Style and production==
===Iowa sessions===
To satisfy the terms of their contracts with Warner and CBS, the Beach Boys intended to record two albums – one for Warner and the other for CBS – at Maharishi International University in Fairfield, Iowa. Mike chose this venue to keep members of the band away from their drug suppliers in Los Angeles. At MIU, the group and their family members took residence in the university&#x27;s circular dorm rooms, and attended meditation classes and meetings. The recording sessions lasted from November 7 to December 4, 1977. AFM documentation indicates that Carl visited on two days, while Dennis, who was busy promoting his solo album &quot;Pacific Ocean Blue&quot;, played drums on an early session for &quot;She&#x27;s Got Rhythm&quot;.

The album was produced by Al Jardine and, from the group&#x27;s touring band, keyboardist Ron Altbach. Gaines writes that the atmosphere was similar to when the group recorded their 1973 album &quot;Holland&quot;, &quot;only worse.&quot; According to Love, Carl and Dennis &quot;took the whole experience [...] as a personal affront, and they came and went with little interest in the music. Brian was with us but miserable throughout.&quot; Brian&#x27;s bodyguard Stan Love described the overall proceedings as &quot;torture. Agony. Like being put right in the middle of nowhere, frozen and cold and small, with only one decent restaurant in town. Brian was putting in his time, but he wasn&#x27;t too happy. He was depressed and on medication. We passed the time playing Ping-Pong.&quot; Stan added that Wilson did not want to produce his bandmates because he resented them personally. In particular, &quot;Brian didn&#x27;t want to write with [Mike] anymore, but of course Mike tried to hang on, doing his arrogant pressure trip on him.&quot;

In a 1995 interview, Brian stated that he could not remember making the album, claiming that he had gone through a &quot;mental blank-out&quot; during this period. He was credited as the album&#x27;s &quot;executive producer&quot;, but according to biographer Peter Ames Carlin, the credit was likely for contractual reasons. Carlin characterizes the record as having &quot;a generic easy-listening sound, heavy on the tinkly keyboards and sweeping strings, with nary a trace of Brian&#x27;s ear for quirky texture.&quot; It included the &quot;Love You&quot; outtake &quot;My Diane&quot;, sung by Dennis, and written by Brian as an expression of anguish following the end of his affair with his sister-in-law, Diane Rovell.

===Discarded tracks and further recording===
&quot;Merry Christmas from the Beach Boys&quot; was the other album that the band produced at these sessions, consisting of reworkings of tracks that had dated from the early to mid-1970s, as well as alternate Christmas-themed versions of songs from &quot;M.I.U.&quot;. Biographer Timothy White reported that &quot;Winds of Change&quot; and &quot;California Feeling&quot; were both working titles for &quot;M.I.U.&quot;. According to music historian Andrew Doe, 

On December 13, 1977, the band held a session – for the vocal to &quot;My Diane&quot; and a Toys for Tots PSA – at Kaye-Smiths Studios in Seattle that was filmed for the television special &quot;Our Team&quot;. Intermittent sessions for &quot;M.I.U.&quot; – specifically, for the tracks &quot;My Diane&quot;, &quot;Belles of Paris&quot;, and &quot;Winds of Change&quot; – continued at Brother Studios and Wally Heider Recording from February 22 to June 28, 1978. The outtakes &quot;Our Team&quot; and &quot;Why&quot; were released on the box sets &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; (1993) and &quot;Made in California&quot; (2013), respectively. Still-unreleased tracks include &quot;Beach Burlesque&quot;, &quot;Go and Get That Girl&quot;, &quot;How&#x27;s About a Little Bit of Your Sweet Lovin&#x27;?&quot;, &quot;Mike, Come Back to L.A&quot;, a demo of &quot;Almost Summer&quot;, and other tracks related to the &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; album.

==Release ==
Music journalist Richard Williams reported, &quot;Love and Jardine tried to offer &quot;M.I.U. Album&quot; to Epic, as the first delivery under their new deal. That they were turned down, on grounds of quality, is a tribute to Epic&#x27;s discretion.&quot;

Lead single &quot;Peggy Sue&quot; was issued in the U.S. in August and peaked at number 59. &quot;M.I.U.&quot; was released in September and reached number 151 in the U.S, becoming their first album to miss the UK chart completely since &quot;The Beach Boys&#x27; Christmas Album&quot; (1964). The Jardine-led cover of the Del-Vikings&#x27; &quot;Come Go with Me&quot; became a U.S. No. 18 hit in late 1981, when it was released as a single from the &quot;Ten Years of Harmony&quot; compilation.

==Critical reception==


&quot;M.I.U Album&quot; was met with confusion from critics and fans, and continues to be widely regarded as one of the Beach Boys&#x27; worst albums. According to music critic Nick Kent, the album was so &quot;dreadful&quot; that its &quot;pitiful content&quot; was ignored by critics. Upon release, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Tom Carson stated, 

Vivien Goldman of &quot;Sounds&quot; found the album to be &quot;magic&quot; and added that she &quot;played it non-stop, even if it seemed a baffling sconed adolescence&quot; before concluding, &quot;If there weren&#x27;t some weirdo psychological reason, how could I get so involved with lyrics that one part of mind is consciously stating: this is moronic drivel?&quot; Richard Williams, who had championed the Beach Boys&#x27; work in the 1960s, wrote a negative review which stated, in part,

In his 2006 biography of Wilson, Carlin referred to it as &quot;the most cynical, spiritually void work the group ever produced&quot;, a &quot;gruesome album&quot;, and perhaps &quot;one of the worst records ever made by a great rock band.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s John Bush stated, &quot;The mainstream late-&#x27;70s production techniques are predictable and frequently cloying. &quot;M.I.U. Album&quot; also included several of the worst Beach Boys songs ever to make it to vinyl. [...] Compared with what had come before, &quot;M.I.U. Album&quot; was a pathetic attempt at music making; compared with what was to come however, this was a highlight.&quot;

Conversely, Jeff Tamarkin, who wrote liner notes for the album&#x27;s CD reissue, decreed that the album &quot;stands on own as a lovely, unique work.&quot; In 1981, Robert Christgau called the album &quot;dumb [...] despite a lot of fairly pleasant music and a few passable songs&quot;. Reviewing the album&#x27;s 2002 reissue, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Keith Phipps stated, &quot;&quot;M.I.U.&quot; is competent enough, but it&#x27;s also the sound of a group buying into its own mythology, a retrograde salute to the pinstripes and sunshine image it had abandoned years before.&quot;

==Legacy==
Reflecting on &quot;M.I.U. Album&quot; in a 1992 interview, Mike Love opined that &quot;there&#x27;s some neat gems there but there wasn&#x27;t a coherence.&quot; Asked about the album in a 1979 interview, Dennis Wilson said, &quot;I hope that karma will fuck up Mike Love&#x27;s meditation forever. That album is an embarrassment to my life. It should self-destruct.&quot;

<text>The National Youth Service (NYS) was a youth service program implemented by the government of Seychelles during its time as a one-party state. It was a formerly compulsory service and included traditional educational curriculum, political education and paramilitary training. Criticized by many as an indoctrination scheme, the program was lauded by President France-Albert René as a way to steer disadvantaged youth from bad habits and troubled situations at home and instead forge a body of educated, skilled, and socially-conscious future administrators of Seychelles. The NYS worked closely with the Seychelles People&#x27;s Progressive Front Youth League.

==History==
=== Educational program ===
The NYS was founded in 1979 as a mass organization intended to provide education, paramilitary, and sports training for Seychellois youth. Initially intended to be compulsory, the program was almost immediately made voluntary (compulsory attendance deferred to 1984) as a response to youth protests. Education at the facility was intended to provide practical education as well as ideological training, and eventually replace Seychellois College, the closure of which was planned for the mid-1980s. The stated primary goal of the program was to create a new generation of Seychellois youth with a wider variety of skills with which they could contribute to society. Additionally, the program was used to combat youth addiction (particularly alcoholism) and teenage pregnancy, and to encourage healthy habits.

Students in the NYS lived at NYS campuses at Port Launay and Cap Ternay on the northwest coast of Mahé. The campus was made up of houses or dormitories known as &quot;clusters&quot; (where the students lived) and the school area. The campus was divided in two, with male-only and female-only clusters separated. There were nine boys&#x27; clusters (from B1 to B9) and nine girls&#x27; clusters (from G1 to G9), with each housing approximately 40 students. Education and other activities were mixed-gender. Students wore special brown and beige uniforms with red scarves. 

In addition to academic training, the students received practical instruction in gardening, cooking, housekeeping, and livestock raising; one of the aims of the program was to reduce youth unemployment. Academic subjects were often combined with the aforementioned activities to form month-long practicums. Initially, students were expected to produce much of their own food and cook their own meals, though this was impractical and was phased out during the later years of the program. Self-government was practiced through group sessions and committees. After completing their NYS program, students could attend Seychelles Polytechnic (1,600 students in 1991) for preuniversity studies or other training.
In 1991 the NYS program was reduced from two years to one year. The total enrollment in that year was 1,394, with roughly equal numbers of boys and girls. Those who left school but did not participate in the NYS could volunteer for a government-administered six-month work program, receiving a training stipend below the minimum wage. The NYS ceased operations in November 1998.

=== Opposition ===
From the time the NYS program was instituted in 1981, it was met with heated opposition and remained highly unpopular among opponents of René&#x27;s regime. The Seychellois opposition opposed the program on the grounds that it allegedly indoctrinated young adults with the ruling Seychelles People&#x27;s Progressive Front&#x27;s socialist ideology and that it rarely allowed its participants to visit their families. Pressure from international organizations forced the government to make the program optional. The NYS campuses were located on Ste. Anne Island, and at Port Launay and Cap Ternay on Mahé island (though the Sainte Anne campus was closed later). 

During the early years of the program, students spent the entire period away from home, with parental visits permitted only during designated 12-hour periods twice per month. The number of parental visits and home visits were increased in later years. Many considered the quality of education to be inferior, with the indoctrination in the socialist policies of the SPPF part of the core curriculum during the beginnings of the NYS. Nevertheless, failure to attend the NYS made it difficult to proceed to more advanced study. 

Due to the perceived inadequacies of the NYS and/or opposition to the ideology of the regime, many wealthier families in Seychelles sent their children abroad to Europe or Australia for education during this period. Nevertheless, the program was deemed particularly effective for students of poorer backgrounds, and provided skills, education, and safety they were not afforded at home.

<text>Roland Sletor Morris (March 11, 1874 – November 23, 1945) was an American lawyer and diplomat. He was one of the founders of the Philadelphia-based law firm Duane Morris in 1904 and served as the United States Ambassador to Japan from 1917 to 1920.

==Early life and education==
He was born in Olympia, Washington in 1874 and graduated from the Lawrenceville School in 1892. He received his A.B. degree from Princeton University in 1896 and his L.L.B. degree from the same school in 1899.

==Career==
In 1904, he became a member of the law firm Duane, Morris and Heckscher.

He was appointed United States Ambassador to Japan by Woodrow Wilson on August 1, 1917 and served in that role from October 30, 1917 to May 15, 1920.

On September 20, 1917, a special dinner event was held to honor Morris in his new position as Ambassador to Japan. This event was attended by six hundred guests, including most members of Philadelphia judiciary and other active civic members of the city. The speakers at this diplomatic gathering included: Thomas B. Smith Mayor of Philadelphia, Aimaro Satō Japanese Ambassador to the U.S., Frank Lyon Polk (Counselor for the U.S. Department of State), Alexander Mitchell Palmer (soon to be U.S. Attorney General) and Robert von Moschzisker (Justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania from 1909 to 1921 and Chief Justice from 1921 to 1930). Other prominent guests included U.S. Senators Boies Penrose and Philander C. Knox. The event took place at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, in Philadelphia.

Morris conducted a series of negotiations with Kijūrō Shidehara, the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, to address alien land laws which limited the ability of Japanese immigrants to achieve full citizenship in the United States. Morris maintained good relations with Japanese colleagues after his stint as ambassador and welcomed diginitaries such as Tsuneo Matsudaira to present to the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce in 1925.

He collaborated with Thomas Garrigue Masaryk during World War I in a question about the Czechoslovak Legions.

In 1934, he lost the Pennsylvania Democratic U.S. Senate primary to Joseph Guffey, who was subsequently elected.

He was one of the founding partners of the law firm of Duane Morris, in Philadelphia.

He was interred at the Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.

<text>Sir John Morris-Jones (17 October 1864 – 16 April 1929) was a Welsh grammarian, academic and Welsh-language poet.

Morris-Jones was born John Jones, at Trefor in the parish of Llandrygarn, Anglesey the son of Morris Jones first a schoolmaster, then a shopkeeper and his wife Elizabeth. He had a younger brother William Jones. In 1868 the family moved to Llanfairpwllgwyngyll where he received elementary education. In 1876 he entered Friars School, Bangor. In 1879 the headmaster of Friars School, Daniel Lewis Lloyd, was appointed to Christ College, Brecon, and John Jones accompanied him there. In 1883 he attended Jesus College, Oxford, where he graduated with honours in mathematics in 1887.

While at Oxford, Morris-Jones studied Welsh books and manuscripts in the Bodleian Library, and attended lectures by Sir John Rhys (1840–1915), the professor of Celtic. Morris-Jones and Rhys prepared an edition of &quot;The Elucidarium and other tracts in Welsh from Llyvyr agkyr Llandewivrevi A.D. 1346&quot; (The Book of the Anchorite of Llanddewi Brefi), a collection of Medieval Welsh manuscripts in Jesus College Library, which they published in 1894. Morris-Jones was one of the original members of &quot;&quot; (the Dafydd ap Gwilym Society), which was founded in 1886 and is still a students&#x27; society.

In 1889 Morris-Jones was appointed as a lecturer in Welsh at the University College of North Wales, Bangor (now Bangor University) where he was promoted to professor in 1895, a post he held until his death.

Morris-Jones worked to standardise Welsh orthography. His works, &quot;Welsh Orthography&quot; (1893) and &quot;&quot; (1913), added to the status of the language and thus were well received in Wales. He was also founder and editor of the literary journal, &quot;&quot;, published between 1911 and 1919. Morris-Jones was knighted in 1918, after which he used the surname Morris-Jones.

Morris-Jones was a commissioner of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales from 1920.

In addition to his own poetry, Morris-Jones published influential translations into Welsh of the German poet Heinrich Heine (1797–1856) and the Persian Omar Khayyam (1048–1131).

In 1897 Morris-Jones married Mary Hughes of Llanfairpwllgwyngyll. They had four daughters. He died in Bangor on 16 April 1929, aged .

The Welsh-speaking hall of residence at Bangor University is named &quot;Neuadd John Morris-Jones&quot; (John Morris-Jones Hall) in his honour.

<text>Leyton Midland Road is a London Overground station in Leyton of the London Borough of Waltham Forest. It is on the Suffragette line, down the line from and situated between and stations in Travelcard Zone 3. It is the closest railway station to Bakers Arms.
==History==
The station opened on 9 July 1894 as part of the Tottenham and Forest Gate Railway and was originally called &quot;Leyton&quot;.

On 17 August 1915, three explosive bombs from the German Zeppelin L.10 landed on or near the station, destroying the ticket office and a billiard hall in the arches under the platform and damaging several houses nearby. Four people were killed.

The station was renamed Leyton Midland Road on 1 May 1949. The goods yard, which was just beyond the station, closed on 6 May 1968. As with Leytonstone High Road and Wanstead Park stations, the booking office was built into the viaduct arch. By the 1980s all the old buildings had been removed and the Greater London Council built a new booking office on Midland Road itself. A few years later that was closed and demolished when, like other stations, Leyton Midland Road became unstaffed.

==Station today==
Since the takeover by London Overground the station has benefited from a major refit including deep clean, new signing, a ticket machine and additional waiting shelters. The community garden which was started by members of the GOBLIN support group is tended by station staff now, one of whom recently won an award for outstanding service to passengers. The station also contains help points and automatic ticket gates have now been installed. Controversially, the Midland Road entrance is now closed.

==Services==
All services at Leyton Midland Road are operated by London Overground using EMUs.

The typical off-peak service is four trains per hour in each direction between and . During the late evenings, the service is reduced to three trains per hour in each direction.


==Connections==
London Buses routes 69, 97 and W16 and night route N26 serve the station.

==Recent proposals==
In common with other stations on the line, usage has greatly increased in recent years, following improvements in train services and the reintroduction of station staff, and peak-hour overcrowding of the two-car diesel trains is now a major issue. Electrification of the line was finally approved after a long campaign and was achieved for 2017. Services from the station were suspended for 8 months (June 2016 – February 2017) whilst the work was carried out.

Along with the Tor functor, Ext is one of the core concepts of homological algebra, in which ideas from algebraic topology are used to define invariants of algebraic structures. The cohomology of groups, Lie algebras, and associative algebras can all be defined in terms of Ext. The name comes from the fact that the first Ext group Ext1 classifies extensions of one module by another.

In the special case of abelian groups, Ext was introduced by Reinhold Baer (1934). It was named by Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders MacLane (1942), and applied to topology (the universal coefficient theorem for cohomology). For modules over any ring, Ext was defined by Henri Cartan and Eilenberg in their 1956 book &quot;Homological Algebra&quot;.

==Definition==
Let formula_1 be a ring and let formula_2 be the category of modules over formula_1. (One can take this to mean either left formula_1-modules or right formula_1-modules.) For a fixed formula_1-module formula_7, let formula_8 for formula_9 in formula_2. (Here formula_11 is the abelian group of formula_1-linear maps from formula_7 to formula_9; this is an formula_1-module if formula_1 is commutative.) This is a left exact functor from formula_2 to the category of abelian groups formula_18, and so it has right derived functors formula_19. The Ext groups are the abelian groups defined by

:formula_20

for an integer &quot;i&quot;. By definition, this means: take any injective resolution

:formula_21

remove the term &quot;B&quot;, and form the cochain complex:

:formula_22

For each integer formula_23, formula_24 is the cohomology of this complex at position formula_23. It is zero for formula_23 negative. For example, formula_27 is the kernel of the map formula_28, which is isomorphic to formula_11.

An alternative definition uses the functor &quot;G&quot;(&quot;A&quot;)=Hom&quot;R&quot;(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;), for a fixed &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;B&quot;. This is a contravariant functor, which can be viewed as a left exact functor from the opposite category (&quot;R&quot;-Mod)op to Ab. The Ext groups are defined as the right derived functors &quot;RiG&quot;:

:formula_30

That is, choose any projective resolution

:formula_31

remove the term &quot;A&quot;, and form the cochain complex:

:formula_32

Then Ext(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) is the cohomology of this complex at position &quot;i&quot;.

One may wonder why the choice of resolution has been left vague so far. In fact, Cartan and Eilenberg showed that these constructions are independent of the choice of projective or injective resolution, and that both constructions yield the same Ext groups. Moreover, for a fixed ring &quot;R&quot;, Ext is a functor in each variable (contravariant in &quot;A&quot;, covariant in &quot;B&quot;).

For a commutative ring &quot;R&quot; and &quot;R&quot;-modules &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, Ext(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) is an &quot;R&quot;-module (using that Hom&quot;R&quot;(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) is an &quot;R&quot;-module in this case). For a non-commutative ring &quot;R&quot;, Ext(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) is only an abelian group, in general. If &quot;R&quot; is an algebra over a ring &quot;S&quot; (which means in particular that &quot;S&quot; is commutative), then Ext(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) is at least an &quot;S&quot;-module.

==Properties of Ext==
Here are some of the basic properties and computations of Ext groups.

*Ext(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) ≅ Hom&quot;R&quot;(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) for any &quot;R&quot;-modules &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;.

*Ext(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) = 0 for all &quot;i&quot; &gt; 0 if the &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;A&quot; is projective (for example, free) or if &quot;B&quot; is injective.

*The converses also hold:
**If Ext(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) = 0 for all &quot;B&quot;, then &quot;A&quot; is projective (and hence Ext(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) = 0 for all &quot;i&quot; &gt; 0).
**If Ext(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) = 0 for all &quot;A&quot;, then &quot;B&quot; is injective (and hence Ext(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) = 0 for all &quot;i&quot; &gt; 0).

*formula_33 for all &quot;i&quot; ≥ 2 and all abelian groups &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;.

* Generalizing the previous example, formula_34 for all &quot;i&quot; ≥ 2 if &quot;R&quot; is a principal ideal domain.

*If &quot;R&quot; is a commutative ring and &quot;u&quot; in &quot;R&quot; is not a zero divisor, then
::formula_35
:for any &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;B&quot;. Here &quot;B&quot;[&quot;u&quot;] denotes the &quot;u&quot;-torsion subgroup of &quot;B&quot;, {&quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;B&quot;: &quot;ux&quot; = 0}. Taking &quot;R&quot; to be the ring formula_36 of integers, this calculation can be used to compute formula_37 for any finitely generated abelian group &quot;A&quot;.

*Generalizing the previous example, one can compute Ext groups when the first module is the quotient of a commutative ring by any regular sequence, using the Koszul complex. For example, if &quot;R&quot; is the polynomial ring &quot;k&quot;[&quot;x&quot;1...,&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;] over a field &quot;k&quot;, then Ext(&quot;k&quot;,&quot;k&quot;) is the exterior algebra &quot;S&quot; over &quot;k&quot; on &quot;n&quot; generators in Ext1. Moreover, Ext(&quot;k&quot;,&quot;k&quot;) is the polynomial ring &quot;R&quot;; this is an example of Koszul duality.

*By the general properties of derived functors, there are two basic exact sequences for Ext. First, a short exact sequence formula_38 of &quot;R&quot;-modules induces a long exact sequence of the form
::formula_39
:for any &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;A&quot;. Also, a short exact sequence formula_38 induces a long exact sequence of the form
::formula_41
:for any &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;B&quot;.

*Ext takes direct sums (possibly infinite) in the first variable and products in the second variable to products. That is:
::formula_42

* Let &quot;A&quot; be a finitely generated module over a commutative Noetherian ring &quot;R&quot;. Then Ext commutes with localization, in the sense that for every multiplicatively closed set &quot;S&quot; in &quot;R&quot;, every &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;B&quot;, and every integer &quot;i&quot;,
::formula_43

==Ext and extensions== 
===Equivalence of extensions===

The Ext groups derive their name from their relation to extensions of modules. Given &quot;R&quot;-modules &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, an extension of &quot;A&quot; by &quot;B&quot; is a short exact sequence of &quot;R&quot;-modules

:formula_44

Two extensions

:formula_45
:formula_46

are said to be equivalent (as extensions of &quot;A&quot; by &quot;B&quot;) if there is a commutative diagram:

Note that the Five lemma implies that the middle arrow is an isomorphism. An extension of &quot;A&quot; by &quot;B&quot; is called split if it is equivalent to the trivial extension

:formula_47

There is a one-to-one correspondence between equivalence classes of extensions of &quot;A&quot; by &quot;B&quot; and elements of Ext(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;). The trivial extension corresponds to the zero element of Ext(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;).

===The Baer sum of extensions===
The Baer sum is an explicit description of the abelian group structure on Ext(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;), viewed as the set of equivalence classes of extensions of &quot;A&quot; by &quot;B&quot;. Namely, given two extensions

:formula_48

and

:formula_49

first form the pullback over formula_7,

:formula_51

Then form the quotient module

:formula_52

The Baer sum of &quot;E&quot; and &quot;E′&quot; is the extension

:formula_53

where the first map is formula_54 and the second is formula_55.

Up to equivalence of extensions, the Baer sum is commutative and has the trivial extension as identity element. The negative of an extension 0 → &quot;B&quot; → &quot;E&quot; → &quot;A&quot; → 0 is the extension involving the same module &quot;E&quot;, but with the homomorphism &quot;B&quot; → &quot;E&quot; replaced by its negative.

==Construction of Ext in abelian categories==
Nobuo Yoneda defined the abelian groups Ext(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) for objects &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; in any abelian category C; this agrees with the definition in terms of resolutions if C has enough projectives or enough injectives. First, Ext(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;) = HomC(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;). Next, Ext(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) is the set of equivalence classes of extensions of &quot;A&quot; by &quot;B&quot;, forming an abelian group under the Baer sum. Finally, the higher Ext groups Ext(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) are defined as equivalence classes of &quot;n-extensions&quot;, which are exact sequences

:formula_56

under the equivalence relation generated by the relation that identifies two extensions

:formula_57

if there are maps formula_58 for all &quot;m&quot; in {1, 2, ..., &quot;n&quot;} so that every resulting square commutes
formula_59
that is, if there is a chain map formula_60 which is the identity on &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;.

The Baer sum of two &quot;n&quot;-extensions as above is formed by letting formula_61 be the pullback of formula_62 and formula_63 over &quot;A&quot;, and formula_64 be the pushout of formula_65 and formula_66 under &quot;B&quot;. Then the Baer sum of the extensions is

:formula_67

==The derived category and the Yoneda product==
An important point is that Ext groups in an abelian category C can be viewed as sets of morphisms in a category associated to C, the derived category &quot;D&quot;(C). The objects of the derived category are complexes of objects in C. Specifically, one has

:formula_68

where an object of C is viewed as a complex concentrated in degree zero, and [&quot;i&quot;] means shifting a complex &quot;i&quot; steps to the left. From this interpretation, there is a bilinear map, sometimes called the Yoneda product:

:formula_69

which is simply the composition of morphisms in the derived category.

The Yoneda product can also be described in more elementary terms. For &quot;i&quot; = &quot;j&quot; = 0, the product is the composition of maps in the category C. In general, the product can be defined by splicing together two Yoneda extensions.

Alternatively, the Yoneda product can be defined in terms of resolutions. (This is close to the definition of the derived category.) For example, let &quot;R&quot; be a ring, with &quot;R&quot;-modules &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and let &quot;P&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;, and &quot;T&quot; be projective resolutions of &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;. Then Ext(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;) can be identified with the group of chain homotopy classes of chain maps &quot;P&quot; → &quot;Q&quot;[&quot;i&quot;]. The Yoneda product is given by composing chain maps:

:formula_70

By any of these interpretations, the Yoneda product is associative. As a result, formula_71 is a graded ring, for any &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;A&quot;. For example, this gives the ring structure on group cohomology formula_72 since this can be viewed as formula_73. Also by associativity of the Yoneda product: for any &quot;R&quot;-modules &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, formula_74 is a module over formula_71.

==Important special cases==

*Group cohomology is defined by formula_76, where &quot;G&quot; is a group, &quot;M&quot; is a representation of &quot;G&quot; over the integers, and formula_77 is the group ring of &quot;G&quot;.

*For an algebra &quot;A&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot; and an &quot;A&quot;-bimodule &quot;M&quot;, Hochschild cohomology is defined by

::formula_78

*Lie algebra cohomology is defined by formula_79, where formula_80 is a Lie algebra over a commutative ring &quot;k&quot;, &quot;M&quot; is a formula_80-module, and formula_82 is the universal enveloping algebra.

*For a topological space &quot;X&quot;, sheaf cohomology can be defined as formula_83 Here Ext is taken in the abelian category of sheaves of abelian groups on &quot;X&quot;, and formula_84 is the sheaf of locally constant formula_36-valued functions.

*For a commutative Noetherian local ring &quot;R&quot; with residue field &quot;k&quot;, formula_86 is the universal enveloping algebra of a graded Lie algebra π*(&quot;R&quot;) over &quot;k&quot;, known as the homotopy Lie algebra of &quot;R&quot;. (To be precise, when &quot;k&quot; has characteristic 2, π*(&quot;R&quot;) has to be viewed as an &quot;adjusted Lie algebra&quot;.) There is a natural homomorphism of graded Lie algebras from the André–Quillen cohomology &quot;D&quot;*(&quot;k&quot;/&quot;R&quot;,&quot;k&quot;) to π*(&quot;R&quot;), which is an isomorphism if &quot;k&quot; has characteristic zero.

<text>deLesseps Story &quot;Chep&quot; Morrison Sr. (January 18, 1912 – May 22, 1964), was an American attorney and politician who was the 54th mayor of New Orleans, Louisiana, from 1946 to 1961. He then served as an appointee of U.S. President John F. Kennedy as the United States ambassador to the Organization of American States between 1961 and 1963.

The population of New Orleans peaked during Morrison&#x27;s mayoralty, when the 1960 Census recorded 627,525 inhabitants, a 10 percent increase from 1950. Morrison ran three primary campaigns for the Louisiana Democratic gubernatorial nomination, but was unsuccessful. Louisiana&#x27;s African Americans had been effectively disfranchised by the turn of the 20th century; their initial preference for the Republican &quot;Party of Lincoln&quot;, coupled with white voters&#x27; overwhelming support in the South for the Democratic Party, meant that the Democratic primary was the only competitive election in the state.

== Early life and education ==
Morrison was born to Jacob Haight Morrison, II (1875–1929), a district attorney in Pointe Coupee Parish, and his wife, the former Anita Olivier, a New Orleans socialite, in New Roads, the Pointe Coupee parish seat of government. He was named after deLesseps Story, a respected New Orleans judge to whom he was related on his mother&#x27;s side; the family was related to Ferdinand de Lesseps and Sidney Story, an alderman for whom the New Orleans area of Storyville was named. Morrison spoke French fluently.

In 1932, Morrison graduated from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. In 1934, he completed his law degree from the Louisiana State University Law Center.

==Law and political career==
Morrison moved to New Orleans, where he became an attorney with the New Deal agency, the National Recovery Administration. Thereafter, he became a law partner with his brother Jacob Morrison and Thomas Hale Boggs Sr., a future Democratic U.S. Representative and House Majority Leader.

==Marriage and family==
In 1942, Morrison married Corinne Waterman of New Orleans. They had three children together. Their oldest son, deLesseps Story Morrison Jr., known as &quot;Toni&quot;, became a politician like his father and was a Louisiana state representative from 1974 to 1980.

==Military service==

After graduation from college he was commissioned in the Army Reserve as a Second Lieutenant in 1933.
During World War II, Morrison left the state legislature to join the United States Army. He was promoted to the rank of colonel, and became chief of staff of the occupation forces stationed in the city of Bremen, Germany. He received the Bronze Star, the Legion of Merit and also served in England, France, and Belgium. In 1944, both he and Bill Dodd were reelected to the legislature &quot;in absentia&quot; by their constituents. He served on active duty from 1941 to 1946. He was also decorated with the Legion of Honour and the Belgian Order of Leopold.

After the war, Morrison returned to New Orleans to practice law. Continuing with the U.S. Army Reserve in 1946, he attained the rank of Major General. His reserve career included serving as the commanding general of the 377th Transportation Command and later Deputy Chief of the Transportation Corps within the United States Department of the Army.

==Election as mayor==
Morrison was approached by a group of Uptown reformers in December 1945 to run for mayor in the election of 1946. The attractive and dynamic young veteran ran a campaign emphasizing the need to clean up the corruption of incumbent Mayor Robert Maestri, who had been affiliated with Huey Long and the Earl Long faction of Louisiana Democratic politics. Maestri&#x27;s Old Regulars had dominated New Orleans for decades. Morrison pulled a major upset when he defeated Maestri in the first primary. Historian Pamela Tyler notes that outside of New Orleans Morrison&#x27;s surprise victory was attributed to the role of women. The International Women&#x27;s Organization, (IWO) under the leadership of July Breazeale Waters (1895–1989), registered voters, became poll watchers, canvassed, distributed literature and signs and got out the vote on election day on behalf of Morrison. One notable event planned by women that moved the electorate was the &quot;March of Brooms&quot; whose theme was, &quot;A Clean Sweep with Morrison.&quot; The IWO and the Broom Brigade were key to Morrison&#x27;s victory, with the Christian Science Monitor stating, &quot;The women of New Orleans elected deLesseps S. Morrison.&quot; He was among many returning World War II veterans to gain political office during that period. 

==Morrison as mayor==

As mayor, Morrison put together a strong public relations team, which helped him cultivate an image as a dynamic reformer and of the city as a progressive one. He gained widespread praise in the national press. A later 1993 survey of historians, political scientists and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the University of Illinois at Chicago ranked Morrison as the sixteenth-best American big-city mayor to have served between the years 1820 and 1993.

Morrison marketed the city effectively, and was instrumental in creating the post-World War II image of New Orleans as a growing and progressive Sun Belt metropolis. His administration attracted significant private investment and welcomed the establishment of numerous oil industry and white-collar corporate offices in downtown New Orleans, as well as several sizable new industrial plants elsewhere. To emphasize his differences from his predecessor, whom he had characterized as dictatorial, Morrison worked to get a law passed to reduce the powers of the mayor. He created a new city planning commission and moved to make administration more efficient by firing many of Maestri&#x27;s patronage appointments (though some were replaced with Morrison&#x27;s own supporters). 

Morrison downsized city operations by selling off most of the city&#x27;s public markets. Most were torn down, which was regretted later as costing the city valuable community centers. He addressed a housing crisis by building veterans&#x27; housing operated by the Housing Authority of New Orleans, and engaged in more large-scale urban renewal than any other New Orleans mayor. Morrison&#x27;s administration demolished low-income neighborhoods to build new or expand existing public housing projects, expropriated private property to construct the New Orleans Civic Center, the New Orleans Union Passenger Terminal, and several street-widening projects in the city&#x27;s downtown. 

One of his most popular acts was to create the New Orleans Recreation Department (NORD), which included segregated facilities for whites and blacks (all public facilities were segregated in those years). He began an extensive citywide street improvement program financed though a bond issue, and located funding sufficient to construct numerous street overpasses and underpasses, eliminating most at-grade railway crossings within the city limits. Morrison acquiesced in New Orleans Public Service&#x27;s dismantling of the city&#x27;s extensive streetcar network in the 1950s. 

A proponent of increased international trade, Morrison lent his support to the construction of the International Trade Mart, a precursor to the city&#x27;s World Trade Center. He traveled extensively in Latin America to promote trade with New Orleans. He became friends with dictators Rafael Trujillo and Juan Perón. Morrison&#x27;s wish to reinforce ties with Latin America was expressed in such urban renewal projects as having new central area circulators embellished with monuments to Central and South American historical figures. The widened Basin Street was, from 1957, developed as the Garden of the Americas and outfitted with monuments to Simón Bolívar, Benito Juárez, and Francisco Morazán. A statue of Bolívar was prominently sited at the corner of Canal and Basin streets, and a new circulator in Central City was renamed Simon Bolivar Avenue.
Despite running on a platform stressing the elimination of the Old Regular machine, after his election Morrison quickly built his own political organization, the Crescent City Democratic Association. The CCDA began finding its supporters jobs in City Hall and in municipal construction contracts. In October 1946, Morrison broke a garbage collectors&#x27; strike by organizing volunteer scab labor to take over the duties of the strikers. Morrison&#x27;s organization&#x27;s power quickly eclipsed that of the Old Regulars, and he secured easy re-elections in 1950, 1954, and 1958. 

Morrison pushed for a new city charter in 1954, which replaced the at-large council commission system with a legislative city council combining five district-based and two at-large members. The &quot;strong mayor&quot; system of municipal government established by the 1954 charter still operates in New Orleans. The charter limited the mayor to two consecutive four-year terms, but did not apply to Morrison, who was exempted by a grandfather clause.

===Morrison, crime, and the NOPD===
After assuming office in 1946, Morrison appointed Adair Watters superintendent of the New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) in an effort to eliminate corruption. But tensions developed when Watters moved to suppress gambling, prostitution, and other vice too zealously for Morrison&#x27;s liking. Watters resigned in February 1949 because of Morrison&#x27;s political interference with NOPD activities. Throughout most of the 1950s, scandals continued to be revealed concerning the involvement of the NOPD in graft and vice. In 1952, the Metropolitan Crime Commission of New Orleans was established as an independent monitor of the NOPD and the Morrison administration&#x27;s approach to vice. State Police Colonel Francis Grevemberg, later a two-time gubernatorial candidate, led a series of high-profile raids on New Orleans gambling establishments that embarrassed Morrison and the NOPD for its inactivity. Eventually, retired FBI Agent Aaron M. Kohn was sent from Chicago to investigate NOPD involvement in vice. Kohn later recalled:

After about a year, I began to realize something about the system down here. In Chicago, people were generally on one side of the fence or the other—honest or crooked. But in Louisiana, there just isn&#x27;t any fence.&quot;

He soon complained that Morrison was obstructing his efforts. In 1955, Morrison forced the mayor to ask for the resignation of Joseph Schuering, the NOPD superintendent implicated in the scandals.

===Morrison and race===
Early in his administration, Morrison supported the construction of a suburban-style black neighborhood named Pontchartrain Park, built public housing for low-income blacks, and spent money on street and infrastructure improvements in black neighborhoods. NORD built playgrounds, swimming pools, and recreational centers for African Americans. These actions earned him the enmity of hard-line segregationists. In 1950, he oversaw the NOPD&#x27;s hiring of its first black policeman since the advent of the Jim Crow era in the late 19th century. These measures aside, Morrison remained committed to segregation and was known to use racial slurs in private conversations. The facilities he built in black neighborhoods were segregated and received inferior funding compared to civic projects in white neighborhoods. Historian Adam Fairclough interprets Morrison&#x27;s building programs for blacks as a way of &quot;shoring up segregation&quot; by defusing dissatisfaction with inferior facilities. Many black leaders found him sympathetic but unwilling to take more meaningful action to address their concerns. Morrison&#x27;s approach to race relations increasingly fell behind the times as the Civil Rights Movement gained momentum.

In his 1959 gubernatorial runoff contest, Morrison proclaimed his support for segregation and noted that New Orleans was at that time the least racially mixed of the large southern cities. He boasted that he had been sued by the NAACP over his segregationist policies in the city.

New Orleans gained national attention in the fall of 1960 during the New Orleans school desegregation crisis as the city&#x27;s school board implemented a federal integration order for its public schools. Four black students entered two white schools, McDonogh No. 19 Elementary School and William Frantz Elementary School, in the city&#x27;s Ninth Ward, but were greeted outside with mobs of white women and youths screaming racial slurs and throwing bottles and refuse. While Morrison did not join Governor Jimmie Davis&#x27; drive to prevent integration by shutting the schools down, he did nothing to prevent the intimidating segregationist demonstrations. The NOPD passively stood by while mobs heckled parents bringing their children to school, but at the same time, police arrested civil rights activists holding lunch counter sit-ins in the city.Citation Needed Morrison&#x27;s lack of action stemmed from his political need to avoid alienating black supporters while publicly retaining a segregationist stance to satisfy whites. His position resulted in criticism from both sides; black New Orleanians and supporters of civil rights felt he had betrayed them, while hard-line segregationists accused him of supporting integration. Ultimately, his fence-straddling on civil rights contributed significantly to the fatigue and disenchantment with which the citizenry received his administration&#x27;s actions in its final years – a sharp contrast with the comparatively ebullient 1950s. Morrison&#x27;s leadership failures on civil rights did much to compromise his earlier achievements. This resulted in New Orleans being more poorly positioned socially and economically for the post-Civil Rights era than its (at that time) peer cities such as Atlanta, Houston, and Dallas.

===Gubernatorial election of 1956===
The then-lieutenant governor, C.E. &quot;Cap&quot; Barham of Ruston, ran unsuccessfully with Morrison in a bid for a second term in the second-highest state office. The two proposed a &quot;New look&quot; for Louisiana politics. In his stump speeches, Morrison often reminded his listeners that all state programs came from taxes and not everything one might prefer could be adopted. Yet he usually mentioned projects important to local voters.

===Gubernatorial election of 1960 ===
Other Morrison ticket candidates lost too, including George W. Shannon for Commissioner of Agriculture and Forestry, Fred Columbus Dent Sr., for register of state land, David Wallace Chennault, son of General Claire Chennault, for custodian of voting machines, Mrs. Marion Henderson of Colfax, Grant Parish for state comptroller, and R. W. &quot;Tom&quot; Farrar Jr., for state attorney general.

In an appearance in Shreveport, Country music star Minnie Pearl campaigned for Morrison, rather than fellow entertainer Jimmie Davis. Morrison carried the endorsement of three of the four Louisiana Teamsters Union chapters, with only the Lake Charles branch remaining neutral in the runoff election against Davis.

===Gubernatorial election of 1964===

==Declining political fortunes==
By his final term as mayor, Morrison&#x27;s luster had faded somewhat. Some of his ideas, such as the unsuccessful 1959 proposal for a monorail, were met with widespread opposition. He moved surprisingly slowly to construct a more modern terminal for Moisant International Airport; for its first thirteen years of operation New Orleanians departed from a glorified barn, in contrast to its regional economic rivals. Morrison failed to keep the Pelicans minor league baseball team in New Orleans. The energy that had characterized his early years in office seemed thoroughly dissipated. Former political allies such as City Councilman and future Lieutenant Governor James Edward &quot;Jimmy&quot; Fitzmorris Jr., began to express their independence and positioned themselves for a future without Morrison. In the aftermath of the school integration crisis, Morrison&#x27;s political future was uncertain. He was the first of many New Orleans mayors to try to amend the 1954 city charter to allow a third consecutive term as mayor, but did not succeed. 
Seeking a political base from which to stage another run for governor, he approached the John F. Kennedy administration and was appointed Ambassador to the Organization of American States on July 17, 1961. In a further sign of his declining political fortunes, his chosen candidate for mayor in the New Orleans election of 1962 – State Senator Adrian G. Duplantier – lost the Democratic runoff to Victor Schiro. 

==Death==
Four months after his final election defeat, Morrison and his son, Randy, died on May 22, 1964, in a plane crash in Ciudad Victoria, Mexico.

==The Morrison family==
Morrison married Corinne Waterman on October 3, 1942. Mrs. Morrison (born August 17, 1921) died at the age of thirty-seven on February 26, 1959, just a few months before her husband launched his second gubernatorial bid. The Morrisons&#x27; seven-year-old son, John Randolph Waterman &quot;Randy&quot; Morrison (born September 24, 1956), died with his father in the 1964 plane crash. The Morrisons&#x27; daughter, Corinne Ann Morrison (born 1947), became an attorney and practiced in New Orleans. Their elder son, deLesseps Story Morrison Jr. (1944–1996), who like his father was elected to the state house, ran unsuccessfully for mayor in 1977. DeLesseps Jr. died of lung cancer on August 21, 1996. Both father and son died at age 52. All four Morrisons are buried at Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans. 

After his wife&#x27;s death, Morrison was frequently seen in the company of Hungarian-born actress Zsa Zsa Gabor, who expressed a special fondness for New Orleans, which she considered &quot;the most European&quot; of American cities. Jimmy Fitzmorris, later lieutenant governor of Louisiana, recalled that &quot;The ladies loved him. Chep was sort of an outgoing personality, had a contagious smile, and was able to captivate a lot of people. Most people that met Chep couldn&#x27;t help but like him.&quot; Morrison later dismissed the notion that his interest in Gabor was serious though Jimmie Davis questioned the relationship in the 1959 gubernatorial race. In 1963, Gabor wed businessman Herbert Hutner while Morrison was making his third unsuccessful run for governor a year before his own death. Gabor, who married nine times, lived until 2016.

In 1995, the senior deLesseps Morrison was inducted posthumously into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield, the home base of the Longs.

<text>There are several figures named Pelagon (Ancient Greek: Πελάγων, -ονος) in Greek mythology.

* Pelagon, king of Phocis and son of Amphidamas. He gave Cadmus the cow that was to guide him to Boeotia.
* Pelagon, also called Pelasgus, son of the river-god Asopus by the naiad Metope, daughter of the river Ladon. He was brother to Ismenus, Corcyra, Salamis, Aegina, Peirene, Cleone, Thebe, Tanagra, Thespia, Asopis, Sinope, Ornea, Chalcis, Harpina and Ismene. His sisters were abducted by various gods as punishment for their father&#x27;s deed.
* Pelagon, one of the suitors of Hippodamia before Pelops.
* Pelagon, one of the Calydonian hunters.
* Pelagon or Pelegon, who is given in the &quot;Iliad&quot; as the father of the Paeonian warrior Asteropaeus, son of the river-god Axius and Periboea, the daughter of Acessamenus. Presumably this Pelagon was the eponymous founder of Pelagonia.
* Pelagon, a native of Pylos who fought under Nestor in the Trojan War.
* Pelagon, an &quot;illustrious&quot; companion of the hero Sarpedon during the Trojan War, who removes Tlepolemus&#x27; spear from Sarpedon&#x27;s thigh.

<doc id="840772" wikidata="Q1737749" url="?curid=840772" title="Keepin' the Summer Alive">
<text>Keepin&#x27; the Summer Alive is the 24th studio album by American rock band the Beach Boys, released March 24, 1980, on Brother, Caribou and CBS Records. Produced by Bruce Johnston, the album peaked at number 75 in the US, during a chart stay of 6 weeks, and number 54 in the UK. It is the group&#x27;s last album recorded with Dennis Wilson, who drowned in 1983, although he only appears on one song.

The album included new material alongside several older songs that had not been released up until that point. Two of the new songs were written by Carl Wilson and Randy Bachman, the title track and &quot;Livin&#x27; with a Heartache&quot;. The latter was released as a single alongside &quot;Goin&#x27; On&quot;, written by Brian Wilson and Mike Love. Brian wrote or co-wrote five of the other seven tracks.

==Background and recording==
After the band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;L.A. (Light Album)&quot; (1979), failed to live up to commercial expectations, the executives at CBS expected another album as soon as possible. In July 1979, the Beach Boys convened at Western Studio in Los Angeles—the studio where most of the band&#x27;s 1960s material had been produced by Brian Wilson—to begin work on a new studio album. The album was also recorded at various other studios, including former backing band member Daryl Dragon&#x27;s Rumbo Recorders in San Fernando, and Al Jardine&#x27;s recording studio in his Big Sur barn. Working titles included &quot;Cousins, Friends and Brothers&quot;, and &quot;Can&#x27;t Wait Till Summer&quot;.

The group wanted Brian to return as their producer and felt that he would be more comfortable recording at the familiar studio environment of Western. They were briefly successful, as Carl Wilson said, &quot;Brian got hot for about three days in the studio. He was singing like a bird. All the protection he usually runs just dropped; he came out of himself, he was right there in the room.&quot; Dennis Wilson, at odds with the rest of the group, abandoned the initial recording sessions, taking no further part in the album. One of these, Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;School Days&quot;, appears on the album&#x27;s final track listing.

In late August, Carl collaborated with Randy Bachman on the writing of four songs, two of which were included on the record, &quot;Keepin&#x27; the Summer Alive&quot; and &quot;Livin&#x27; with a Heartache&quot;. Bachman declined an invitation to co-produce the album because he was struggling with personal issues. He later released his own version of &quot;Keepin&#x27; the Summer Alive&quot; with his short-lived band Union on their eponymous 1980 album.

In October 1979, the band reconvened with Bruce Johnston taking complete control of the album&#x27;s production. The resulting album included a mixture of brand new songs alongside older songs that had not been released up until that point. &quot;When Girls Get Together&quot; was recorded in 1969, and it is the only song on the album featuring Dennis. Johnston started writing &quot;Endless Harmony&quot; in 1972 as &quot;Ten Years&#x27; Harmony&quot;. The earlier title and lyrics were used for a version by California Music in 1974. The band began recording &quot;Santa Ana Winds&quot; in 1978, revising and re-recording some of the song for this album. Sessions wrapped on February 14, 1980. Two outtakes, the original &quot;Goin&#x27; to the Beach&quot; and a cover of &quot;Da Doo Ron Ron&quot;, were later released on the 2013 compilation &quot;Made in California&quot;.

In 2013, Johnston expressed dissatisfaction with the production of the title track, which he perceived as being weaker-sounding due to Carl&#x27;s intervention. In 2020, Johnston elaborated, believing session guest and former bandmate Ricky Fataar’s drumming was inferior to session drummer Scott Mathews’ playing.

==Outtakes==
Still-unreleased tracks from the &quot;Keepin&#x27; the Summer Alive&quot; sessions include &quot;Starbaby&quot; and &quot;Surfer Suzie&quot;, as well as renditions of &quot;I&#x27;ll Always Love You&quot;, &quot;Jamaica Farewell&quot;, &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot;, &quot;Little Girl&quot;, &quot;Stranded in the Jungle&quot;, and &quot;Smokey Places&quot;.

==Critical reception==
In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Rob Theakston referred to &quot;Keepin&#x27; the Summer Alive&quot; as &quot;the low point&quot; in the band&#x27;s discography: &quot;Ripe with mindless throwaways and lifeless filler ... The two exceptions to the rule reside in the title track and the closing &#x27;Endless Harmony.&#x27;&quot; In &quot;(The New) Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, the album is cited as an &quot;abysmal&quot; entry in &quot;a string of inconsequential records&quot; that had not abated since 1978&#x27;s &quot;M.I.U. Album&quot;.

<doc id="840779" wikidata="Q1686158" url="?curid=840779" title="Jedidiah Morse">
<text>Jedidiah Morse (August 23, 1761June 9, 1826) was an American geographer and preacher whose textbooks became a staple for students in the United States. He was the father of the telegraphy pioneer and painter Samuel Morse, and his textbooks earned him the sobriquet of &quot;father of American geography.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Born to a New England family in Woodstock, Connecticut, his parents were Jedidiah Morse and Sarah Child. Morse did his undergraduate work and earned a divinity degree at Yale University (M.A. 1786). While pursuing his theological studies under Jonathan Edwards and Samuel Watts, he established a school for young women in 1783 in New Haven.

==Career==
In the summer of 1785, he was licensed to preach, but continued to occupy himself with teaching. He became a tutor at Yale in June 1786, but, resigning this office, was ordained on November 9, 1786, and settled in Midway, Georgia, where he remained until August of the following year. He spent the winter of 1787 and 1788 in New Haven in geographical work, preaching on Sundays to vacant parishes in the vicinity.

===Religious activities===
Morse became a pastor in Charlestown, Boston (across Boston harbor) on April 30, 1789, where he served until 1820. Among his friends and numerous correspondents were Noah Webster, Benjamin Silliman and Jeremy Belknap.
In 1795, he received the degree of D.D. from the University of Edinburgh. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1796.

Throughout his life, Morse was much occupied with religious controversy, and in upholding the faith of the New England church against the assaults of Unitarianism. Ultimately his persevering opposition to liberal views of religion brought on him a persecution that affected deeply his naturally delicate health. He was very active in 1804 in the movement that resulted in enlarging the Massachusetts general assembly of Congregational ministers, and in 1805 unsuccessfully opposed, as a member of the board of overseers, the election of Henry Ware to the Hollis Chair of Divinity at Harvard.

Morse did much toward securing the foundation of Andover Theological Seminary, especially by his successful efforts in preventing the establishment of a rival institution in West Newbury which had been projected by the Hopkinsians (chiefly Samuel Spring and Leonard Woods, with the financial backing of William Bartlett). He participated in the organization of the Park Street Church in Boston in 1808, when all the Congregational churches of that city, except the Old South Church, had abandoned the orthodox faith. In 1805, he established &quot;The Panoplist&quot; for the purpose of illustrating and defending the commonly received orthodoxy of New England, and continued its sole editor for five years. This journal later became &quot;The Missionary Herald&quot;.

===Geography===

Morse strongly influenced the educational system of the United States. While teaching at a school for young women, he saw the need for a geography textbook oriented to the forming nation. The result was skimpy and derivative, &quot;Geography Made Easy&quot; (1784). He followed that with &quot;American Geography&quot; (1789), which was widely cited and copied. New editions of his school textbooks and the more weighty works often came out annually, earning him the informal title, &quot;father of American geography.&quot; His postponed gazetteer for his work of 1784 was bested by Joseph Scott&#x27;s &quot;Gazetteer of the United States&quot; in 1795. With the aid of Noah Webster and Rev. Samuel Austin, Morse published his gazetteer as &quot;Universal Geography of the United States&quot; (1797).

===Native American peoples===
Morse rebutted certain racist views published in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; concerning the Native American peoples, e.g., that their women were &quot;slavish&quot; and that their skins and skulls were thicker than those of other humans.

He took great interest in requiring Native Americans to become Christian, and in 1820 was appointed by the US secretary of war to visit and observe various tribes on the border in order to devise the most effective ways of assimilating them to European-American culture. This work occupied his attention during two winters, and he wrote up the results of his investigations in &quot;Report to the Secretary of War on Indian Affairs&quot; (New Haven, 1822).

===Illuminati conspiracy theory===
Morse is also known for his part in spreading the &quot;Illuminati&quot; conspiracy theory in New England 1798–99. Beginning May 9, 1798, Morse delivered three sermons supporting John Robison&#x27;s book &quot;Proofs of a Conspiracy&quot;, which first publicized the view that the Illuminati had masterminded the French Revolution. Morse was a strong Federalist and feared that the anti-Federalists would repeat the French Revolution&#x27;s excesses. When presented with the claim, President George Washington wrote to Washington, D.C., commissioners on October 27, 1798:
It is not my intention to doubt that the doctrine of the Illuminati and the principles of Jacobinism had not spread in the United States. On the contrary, no one is more satisfied of this fact than I am. The idea that I meant to convey, was, that I did not believe that the Lodges of Free Masons in this Country had, as Societies, endeavoured to propagate the diabolical tenets of the first, or pernicious principles of the latter (if they are susceptible of separation). That Individuals of them may have done it, or that the founder, or instrument employed to found, the Democratic Societies in the United States, may have had these objects; and actually had a separation of the People from their Government in view, is too evident to be questioned.

===Other endeavors===
Morse was an active member of the Massachusetts Historical Society, was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1813, and was also a member of various other literary and scientific bodies. He made significant contributions to Dobson&#x27;s Encyclopædia, the first encyclopedia published in the United States after the Revolution.
Morse published 25 sermons and addresses on special occasions; also &quot;A Compendious History of New England&quot;, with Elijah Harris (Charlestown, 1804); and &quot;Annals of the American Revolution&quot; (Hartford, 1824).

===Marriage and family===

Morse married Elizabeth Ann Finley Breese after starting as pastor in Charlestown. He and his wife had a family of several children, including their first child Samuel F. B. Morse, the future painter and telegraphy pioneer. Other sons were Sidney Edwards Morse, who also published a geography text, and Richard Cary Morse (1795–1868), who assisted his father in his geographical work and founded with brother Sidney the &quot;New York Observer&quot;.

The senior Morse died in 1826 and was buried at the Grove Street Cemetery.

<text>Sidney Edwards Morse (7 February 1794 – 24 December 1871) was an American inventor, geographer and journalist. Morse was the brother of telegraphy pioneer and painter Samuel F. B. Morse.

==Biography==
Morse was the son of geographer and clergyman Jedidiah Morse. Morse graduated from Yale in 1811, studied theology at Andover Seminary, and law at the Litchfield, Connecticut, school. Meanwhile, Morse became a contributor to the &quot;Columbian Centinel&quot; of Boston, writing a series of articles that illustrated the danger to the American Union from an undue multiplication of new states in the south, and showing that it would give to a sectional minority the control of the government. These led to his being invited by Jeremiah Evarts and others to found a weekly religious newspaper, which Morse named &quot;Boston Recorder&quot;. Morse continued as sole editor and proprietor of this journal for more than a year, raising its circulation until that of only two Boston papers exceeded it. Morse was then associated with his elder brother, Samuel Morse, in patenting the flexible piston pump and extending its sale.
In 1823, Morse moved to New York and, with his brother, Richard Cary Morse, founded the &quot;New York Observer&quot;, which eventually became the oldest weekly in New York City and the oldest religious newspaper in the state. Morse continued as senior editor and proprietor until 1858, when he retired to private life.

In 1839, Morse was associated with Henry A. Munson in the development of cerography, a method of printing maps in color on the common printing press. Morse used this process to illustrate his geographical textbooks (in his early life, Morse had assisted his father in preparing geography books). Morse devoted the last years of his life to experimenting with an invention to explore the depths of the sea. This instrument, called a bathometer, was exhibited at the World&#x27;s fair in Paris in 1869 and during 1870 in New York City.

==Pro-slavery==
The &quot;New York Observer&quot; was pro-slavery. It was the one newspaper that Mary Ann Day Brown, wife of abolitionist John Brown, could not stand:

Morse authored &quot;Premium questions on slavery, each admitting of a yes or no answer; addressed to the editors of the &quot;New York Independent&#x27;&quot; and &quot;New York Evangelist,&quot;&quot; in which there are questions such as:
*Have the American people ever been abandoned by God to the folly and wickedness of &quot;practically asserting&quot; the right of every negro slave to liberty, without regard to the probable effect of the liberty of the negro upon the welfare of the community?
*Does the Bible any where assert that all men have a right to liberty; or that slavery is always wrong; or that slaveholders are sinners merely because they are slaveholders; or that the governments instituted among men have no just powers except those derived from the consent of the governed ?

==Literary works==

* &quot;Premium Questions on Slavery&quot; (New York, 1860)

<text>The president of Ecuador (), officially called the constitutional president of the Republic of Ecuador (), serves as the head of state and head of government of Ecuador. It is the highest political office in the country as the head of the executive branch of government. Per the current constitution, the president can serve two four-year terms. Prior to that, the president could only serve one four-year term.

The current president of Ecuador is Daniel Noboa. He was elected in 2023 and is currently the youngest president in the country&#x27;s history.

==History==
The presidency of Ecuador has been marked by periods of instability, causing the office to change presidents frequently throughout the history of the country. At least five times, the president&#x27;s duties have been charged to a provisional government or a military junta. Often, the office has been left to an interim or acting president, many of whom would go on to become president. The president who has served the most terms in office is José María Velasco Ibarra, who served five. 

In May 2017 Rafael Correa became the first President in more than two decades to serve out his complete terms in office since Sixto Durán Ballén, who served from 1992 to 1996. Before Correa, a period of deep political instability from 1996 to 2006 also saw a grave economic crisis in 1998-2000. During this time, Durán Ballén&#x27;s three elected successors, Abdalá Bucaram, Jamil Mahuad and Lucio Gutiérrez, were deposed in popular revolts, followed by military or legislative coups d&#x27;États, in 1997, 2000, and 2005, respectively. Since Correa, Lenín Moreno (2017–2021) has also completed a full 4-year presidential term, despite a large 2019 popular revolt that nearly toppled his government.

<doc id="840789" wikidata="Q1583022" url="?curid=840789" title="MacDill Air Force Base">
<text>MacDill Air Force Base (MacDill AFB) is an active United States Air Force installation located 4 miles (6.4 km) south-southwest of downtown Tampa, Florida.

The &quot;host wing&quot; for MacDill AFB is the 6th Air Refueling Wing (6 ARW), assigned to the Eighteenth Air Force of the Air Mobility Command. The 6 ARW is commanded by Colonel Edward Szczepanik. The Wing Command Chief is Chief Master Sergeant Raun Howell.

MacDill Air Force Base, located in South Tampa, was constructed as MacDill Field, a U.S. Army Air Corps, later U.S. Army Air Forces, installation just prior to World War II. With the establishment of the U.S. Air Force as an independent service in September 1947, it became MacDill Air Force Base. During the 1950s and 1960s, it was a Strategic Air Command (SAC) installation for B-47 Stratojet bombers. In the early 1960s, it transitioned to a Tactical Air Command (TAC) installation, briefly operating the F-84 Thunderstreak jet fighter before transitioning to the F-4 Phantom II. During the 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s, it operated F-4 Phantom II fighters under various fighter wings, followed by F-16 Fighting Falcons in the mid-1980s to early 1990s.

MacDill became an Air Mobility Command installation in 1996 and home to the 6th Air Refueling Wing, its 310th Airlift Squadron flying the C-37A, and its 50th Air Refueling Squadron and 91st Air Refueling Squadron flying the KC-135. The 6 ARW is further augmented by the Air Force Reserve Command&#x27;s 927th Air Refueling Wing and 63d Air Refueling Squadron also flying KC-135s.

MacDill AFB is also home to the headquarters for two of the U.S. military&#x27;s unified combatant commands: Headquarters, United States Central Command, and Headquarters, United States Special Operations Command. Both commands are independent from one another and each is commanded by a respective four-star general or admiral.

Two additional subunified commands are also headquartered at MacDill AFB: Commander, United States Marine Corps Forces Central Command, commanded by a three-star general, and United States Special Operations Command Central commanded by a two-star general or admiral.

==History==

=== Port Tampa Cemetery ===
Port Tampa Cemetery “was one of several African American cemeteries in the area that had been forgotten or purchased for redevelopment,” according to a historical marker established within the base. In 2019, the Air Force received information about the existence of a former African-American graveyard on the grounds of the base from the Tampa Bay History Center. Archival city records indicated that there was a segregation era burial site for Black families between 1840 and 1920. A non-intrusive archaeological survey using ground penetrating radar and cadaver dogs found evidence of a cemetery by a contractor hired by the base. On 19 January 2024, Air force officials announced that potentially 121 unmarked graves had been discovered. The search continues along with outreach to the community on how to best document the site and pay respect to the people buried there.

=== Establishment and name ===
MacDill AFB was originally established in 1939 as Southeast Air Base, Tampa. It is named in honor of Colonel Leslie MacDill (1889–1938).

===Initial uses===
===World War II===
The B-26 earned the slogan &quot;One a day in Tampa Bay&quot; due to the number of early-model B-26 aircraft that ditched or crashed into the Tampa Bay waters surrounding MacDill Field. Early models of the B-26 aircraft proved hard to fly and land by many pilots due to its short wings, high landing speeds, and fighter-plane maneuverability. Improvements to the Block 10 version of the aircraft, known as the B-26B-10, added six feet of additional wingspan and upgraded engines that eliminated most of these problems.

===Strategic Air Command===

====307th Bombardment Group====
==== 306th Bombardment Wing ====
Deliveries of the new Boeing B-47A Stratojet to the Air Force and SAC began in December 1950, and the aircraft entered service in May 1951 with the 306th Bombardment Wing.

==== 305th Bombardment Wing ====
The 809th Air Division (809th AD) took over host unit responsibilities for MacDill AFB on 16 June 1952.

In June 1952, the 305th upgraded to the all-jet Boeing B-47B Stratojet.

==== Alert detachment operations ====
Although control of MacDill AFB would pass from SAC to TAC in the early 1960s, SAC continued to maintain a periodic presence at MacDill in the form of dispersal alert operations of B-52 and KC-135 aircraft from other SAC bombardment wings, using the extant SAC Alert Facility at MacDill. These operations continued until the early 1980s.

===Air Defense Command / Aerospace Defense Command===
===Tactical Air Command===
The first attempt to close MacDill AFB was made in 1960, when the impending phaseout of SAC&#x27;s B-47 bombers caused it to be listed as surplus and slated for closure. However, the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 highlighted the base&#x27;s strategic location and its usefulness as a staging area. As a result, the cuts were stayed and the base repurposed for a tactical mission with fighter aircraft. In response to the crisis, the United States Strike Command was also established at MacDill as a crisis response force; it was one of the first unified commands, a command that draws manpower and equipment from all branches of the U.S. military.

In 1962, MacDill AFB was transferred from SAC to TAC. Bomber aircraft remained home-based at MacDill until the 306th Bombardment Wing&#x27;s transfer to McCoy AFB, and SAC continued to maintain a tenant presence at MacDill through the 1980s, using their alert facility as a dispersal location for B-52 and KC-135 aircraft. But for all practical purposes, the 1960s marked MacDill&#x27;s transition from a bomber-centric SAC base to a fighter-centric TAC installation. Under TAC, MacDill AFB remained a fighter base for almost 30 years, but other changes went on in the background.

==== 12th Tactical Fighter Wing ====
==== 15th Tactical Fighter Wing ====
On 17 April 1962, the 15th Tactical Fighter Wing was activated at MacDill and assigned to 9th Air Force. Initially equipped with the F-84F Thunderjet, in 1964 the 15th TFW subsequently upgraded to the tail-coded McDonnell-Douglas F-4C Phantom II. In 1970, U.S. Strike Command was renamed United States Readiness Command.

====Cuban Missile Crisis====
They were to also press napalm and rocket attacks against surface-to-air missile sites at Mariel and Sagua La Grande, as well as the airfields at Santa Clara, Los Banos, and San Julien.

====1st Tactical Fighter Wing====

On 10 January 1970, the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing was reassigned without personnel or equipment to MacDill. In 1972, the 1st TFW standardized all of its aircraft with the common wing tail code &quot;FF&quot;.

==== 56th Tactical Fighter Wing / 56th Tactical Training Wing====

In 1980, the new Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force was activated, and in 1983, it became United States Central Command. Also in 1987, United States Special Operations Command was activated at MacDill AFB, occupying the former facilities of USREDCOM.

At Super Bowl XVIII and again at Super Bowl XXV, both played at Tampa Stadium, 56th Tactical Training Wing aircraft performed the flyover and missing man formation after the national anthem.

===After Cold War and BRAC 1991===
By the early 1990s and the end of the Cold War, the U.S. was looking to downsize the military and eliminate a large number of bases in the United States as a cost-savings measure. MacDill AFB figured prominently in this; the Tampa area had seen substantial increases in commercial air traffic at the two international airports within 10 nautical miles of MacDill, creating hazardous conditions for F-16 training, and the noise associated with the high-performance jets was deemed unsuitable for high-density residential areas such as those around MacDill. As a result, the 1991 Defense Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) ordered that all flight-line activities cease at MacDill AFB by 1993.

As a result of the BRAC decision, the F-16 training mission and the 56th Fighter Wing were moved without personnel or equipment to Luke Air Force Base, outside of Phoenix, Arizona, and was reassigned to Air Education and Training Command.

====6th Air Mobility Wing and 927th Air Refueling Wing (Associate)====
In August 1992, just prior to the landfall of Hurricane Andrew in southern Florida, the 31st Fighter Wing (31 FW) and the Air Force Reserve&#x27;s 482d Fighter Wing, both based at Homestead AFB, executed an emergency hurricane evacuation of all of their flyable F-16C and F-16D aircraft, with the bulk of those aircraft temporarily staging at MacDill. Given the level of destruction at Homestead AFB, these fighter aircraft remained at MacDill for several months thereafter.

In 1993, with the help of local Representative Bill Young (R-FL), the flight-line closure order for MacDill was rescinded and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration transferred from their former aircraft operations center at Miami International Airport to Hangar 5 at MacDill AFB to use the base and its flight line as their new home station for weather reconnaissance and research flights.

On 1 January 1994, the Air Combat Command&#x27;s 6th Air Base Wing (6 ABW) stood up at MacDill AFB to operate the base and provide support services for the large and growing number of tenant units, as well as to provide services for transient air units. Later that year, the base served as the primary staging facility for Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti.

This staging was considered evidence of the quality and usefulness of the MacDill runway and flight line, even in light of the high civilian air traffic levels in the Tampa Bay area from nearby Tampa International Airport, St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport, and Peter O. Knight Airport. With further congressional prodding and lobbying, MacDill was chosen as the site for a KC-135 air refueling mission. With the arrival of 12 KC-135R tankers and the 91st Air Refueling Squadron from Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana, the 6 ABW was renamed the 6th Air Refueling Wing (6 ARW) on 1 October 1996 and transferred from ACC to the Air Mobility Command (AMC).

In January 2001, the 310th Airlift Squadron (310 AS) was activated at the base, flying the CT-43A and EC-135Y, the former aircraft providing executive transport to the commander of United States Southern Command in Miami and the latter aircraft providing executive transport and airborne command post capabilities to the commanders of USCENTCOM and USSOCOM at MacDill. New C-37A aircraft were delivered starting in 2001, and the CT-43 and EC-135s were subsequently removed from service. The 310th&#x27;s primary mission is dedicated airlift support for the commanders of USCENTCOM, USSOCOM, and USSOUTHCOM. With the addition of the 310 AS, the wing was given its current designation as the 6th Air Mobility Wing (6 AMW).

In April 2008, pursuant to BRAC action, the Air Force Reserve Command&#x27;s 927th Air Refueling Wing relocated from Selfridge Air National Guard Base, Michigan, to MacDill AFB, where it became an associate wing to the 6 AMW, also flying KC-135R aircraft.

====Tenant units====

In late 2003/early 2004, U.S. Naval Forces Central Command vacated its Tampa &quot;rear headquarters&quot; at MacDill AFB, a complex that was established in the early 1990s following the first Gulf War and commanded by a flag officer, either an upper half or lower half rear admiral concurrently assigned as the USNAVCENT/US 5th Fleet Deputy Commander (DEPCOMUSNAVCENT/DEPCOMFIFTHFLT), and his staff when they were not forward deployed to the Persian Gulf region. In vacating the MacDill AFB facility, all USNAVCENT staff activities were consolidated at COMUSNAVCENT/COMFIFTHFLT headquarters in Manama, Bahrain.

NAVCENT&#x27;s facility at MacDill AFB was subsequently turned over to the Deputy Commander, U.S. Marine Forces Central Command (DEPCOMUSMARCENT), and his staff. It would later become the overall Headquarters, U.S. Marine Forces Central Command, while the Commanding General for MARCENT (COMUSMARCENT) would remain a dual-hatted function of the Commanding General, I Marine Expeditionary Force (I MEF) at Camp Pendleton, California. From late 2003 until 2012, the Commanding General remained in California, while his MARCENT staff primarily resided at MacDill AFB with an additional forward element at Naval Support Activity Bahrain in Manama, Bahrain. In 2012, the COMUSMARCENT and CG I MEF billets were broken into separate billets and COMUSMARCENT took up full-time residency in MARCENT&#x27;s headquarters facility at MacDill AFB, upgrading the facility to a 3-star headquarters.

Also in late 2004/early 2005, Naval Reserve Center Tampa vacated its obsolescent waterfront location in downtown Tampa, consolidated with the former Naval Reserve Center St. Petersburg adjacent to Coast Guard Air Station Clearwater, and relocated to a newly constructed facility on the south side of MacDill AFB. In 2006, this facility was renamed Navy Operational Support Center Tampa, concurrent with the shift in name of the U.S. Naval Reserve to the U.S. Navy Reserve and its greater integration into the Fleet and shore establishment of the Regular Navy. Under the command of an active duty full-time support (FTS) U.S. Navy Captain, NOSC Tampa provides administrative support for all Navy Reserve personnel assigned to both local independent Navy Reserve units at NOSC Tampa and to the various joint and service commands and activities at MacDill AFB, CGAS Clearwater and Marine Corps Reserve Center Tampa.

The Joint Communications Support Element (JCSE) is a joint command headquartered at MacDill AFB that deploys to provide en route, early entry, scalable command, control, communications and computer (C4) support to the geographical Unified Combatant Commands, the U.S. Special Operations Command, and other military commands and U.S. Government agencies as directed. On order, JCSE provides additional C4 services within 72 hours to support larger Commander, Joint Task Force/Commander, Joint Special Operations Task Force (CJTF/CJSOTF) headquarters across the full spectrum of operations. JCSE is commanded by a U.S. Army Colonel and consists of a Headquarters Support Squadron (HSS), a Communications Support Detachment (CSD), three active-duty joint communications squadrons: the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Joint Communications Squadrons, and the 4th Joint Communications Squadron, the 4th being a U.S. Army Reserve squadron. All are located on the JCSE compound at MacDill AFB. JCSE also includes two additional joint communications support squadrons from the Air National Guard: the 224th Joint Communications Support Squadron (224 JCSS) of the Georgia Air National Guard in Brunswick, Georgia, and the 290th Joint Communications Support Squadron (290 JCSS) of the Florida Air National Guard located in its own compound separate from JCSE at MacDill AFB.

As mentioned above, the 290th Joint Communications Support Squadron (290 JCSS) of the Florida Air National Guard is another tenant unit at MacDill AFB. The 290 JCSS provides Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff-directed globally deployable, en route, and early entry communications support to geographic combatant commands, the United States Special Operations Command, individual U.S. armed services, other Department of Defense activities and combat support agencies, other U.S. Government agencies, and the State of Florida. The squadron deploys modular, scalable support to large Joint and Combined War-fighting Command and Control (C2) headquarters nodes. Under its Title 10 USC &quot;Federal&quot; mission, the 290 JCSS is associated with the U.S. Transportation Command&#x27;s Joint Enabling Capabilities Command (JECC) and the Joint Communications Support Element (JCSE). As a USAF organization, the 290 JCSS is operationally gained by the Air Mobility Command (AMC). Under its Title 32 USC &quot;state&quot; mission, the squadron reports to the Governor of Florida via the Assistant Adjutant General for Air (ATAG-Air) and The Adjutant General (TAG) of the Florida National Guard./

The newest tenant command at MacDill AFB is the 598th Range Squadron (598 RANS), an Air Combat Command (ACC) unit that was activated at the MacDill AFB Auxiliary Field at Avon Park Air Force Range, Florida on 22 September 2015. The 598 RANS replaced Detachment 1, 23d Fighter Group, which had previously managed the range and additional facilities at MacDill AFB. The 598 RANS operates both the Avon Park Air Force Range (APAFR) and the 23rd Wing Deployed Unit Complex (DUC) located at MacDill AFB. The DUC is a separate flight line facility on the west side of MacDill AFB for transient military flight crews, maintenance crews and fighter and attack aircraft utilizing the APAFR. This permits visiting squadrons to have ready access to APAFR while concurrently taking advantage of the more robust billeting, messing and aircraft maintenance support capabilities at MacDill AFB. This combination of facilities between MacDill AFB and the APAFR provides extensive, diversified and convenient training airspace and ranges with unique training capabilities for military air, ground and air-to-ground training. The squadron&#x27;s higher headquarters, the 23d Fighter Group, is located at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia.

In September 2019, the 310th Airlift squadron inactivated. The squadron had operated three C-37A Gulfstream V and provided global special assignment airlift missions (SAAM) in support of the commanders of the unified combatant commands. As a result, with its primary mission now aerial refueling, the 6th Air Mobility Wing was re-designated as the 6th Air Refueling Wing.

====Super Bowl flyovers====

The flyover and Missing man formations for Super Bowl XXV, Super Bowl XXXV and Super Bowl XLIII, played at Raymond James Stadium, came from KC-135 aircraft from MacDill&#x27;s 6th Air Mobility Wing, with additional flyovers by a B-2 Spirit from the 509th Bomb Wing and F-22 Raptor aircraft from the 325th Fighter Wing. The former flyover was the first Super Bowl flyover to be telecast in high definition.

====Cyber and information warfare====
As the home for USSOCOM, the unified combatant command that holds authority over the command and control of U.S.-based special operations forces, as well as the home of SOCCENT, the geographic command responsible for executing special operations in the Central Command area of responsibility, MacDill has been used to conduct psychological operations, also referred to as Military Information Support Operations (MISO) including propaganda and information warfare. According to Reuters, a facility within MacDill &quot;remains the Pentagon’s clandestine propaganda factory.&quot;

In early 2011, several news outlets, primarily in the United Kingdom, reported that Ntrepid, a California software and hardware company, had been awarded a $2.76 million U.S. government contract to create false online personas to counter the threat of terrorism and could possibly run their operation from MacDill AFB.

=== BRAC 2005 ===
In its 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Grand Forks Air Force Base, North Dakota. It would distribute the 319th Air Refueling Wing&#x27;s KC-135R aircraft to the 6th Air Mobility Wing (6 AMW) at MacDill AFB, FL (four aircraft) and several other installations, increasing the number of KC-135R aircraft assigned to the 6 AMW from twelve to sixteen aircraft . Concurrent with this BRAC decision, the 6 AMW would also host a Reserve association with the Air Mobility Command-gained 927th Air Refueling Wing (927 ARW) of the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), the latter of which would be realigned and relocated from Selfridge ANGB, Michigan to MacDill AFB. Under the Reserve Associate arrangement, both the 6 AMW and the 927 ARW would share the same KC-135R aircraft, while the 927 ARW would turn over their KC-135R aircraft to the 127th Wing (127 WG) of the Michigan Air National Guard at Selfridge ANGB. The 927 ARW began relocation from Selfridge ANGB to MacDill AFB in 2007 and formally established itself at MacDill in April 2008.

=== Additional KC-135 Aircraft for 6 AMW / 927 ARW ===
Long range USAF plans in the 2015 defense budget called for MacDill AFB to add eight additional KC-135R aircraft to its extant sixteen KC-135Rs in FY2018. The 6 AMW would also increase manning by approximately 300 personnel. These additional KC-135R aircraft would come from other Air Force, Air Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard units transitioning to the KC-46A Pegasus aerial refueling aircraft and the timeline would be contingent on those other units completing their transition and achieving operational capability with the KC-46.

=== Departure of NOAA Aircraft Operations Center ===
Until mid-2017, MacDill AFB also hosted the Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Commissioned officers of the NOAA Corps and NOAA civil servants fly &quot;Hurricane Hunter&quot; missions in NOAA&#x27;s WP-3D Orion and Gulfstream IV aircraft, as well as other research missions in these and other assigned fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft.

With the anticipated increase in KC-135R aircraft and the need for additional maintenance hangar space, the Air Force informed NOAA in 2016 that they would no longer be able to host the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center, its aircraft, and the 110 NOAA personnel in Hangar 5 and its adjacent operations building at MacDill AFB. In May 2017, NOAA began relocation to a new facility at Lakeland Linder International Airport, northeast of MacDill AFB, completing same in June 2017.

=== Airshow ===
MacDill historically hosted an annual air show and &quot;open house&quot; enjoyed by thousands of spectators each year. There were no shows in 2002 and 2003 due to security concerns following the attacks on the United States of 11 September 2001 and the initiation of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003. The 2006 show was also canceled due to security concerns on base, but was reinstated in 2008. It was cancelled again in 2013 due to defense budget constraints, but was reinstated again in 2014 as a biennial event. AirFest 2016 was the first-ever airshow to feature a live webcast of the performers, including the headline act of the United States Air Force Thunderbirds.

==Role and operations==
The 6 ARW also has a collocated Air Force Reserve &quot;Associate&quot; wing at MacDill, the 927th Air Refueling Wing (927 ARW) of the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC). The 6 ARW and the 927 ARW operate and share the same assigned KC-135R Stratotanker aircraft.

The 6 AMW&#x27;s 3,000-person force organized into four groups, in addition to the wing commander&#x27;s immediate staff.

Approximately 15,000 people work at MacDill Air Force Base, with a significant number of military personnel and their families living on base in military housing, while remaining service-members and military families live off base in the Tampa Bay area. MacDill AFB is a significant contributor to Tampa&#x27;s economy and the city is very supportive of the military community. In 2001 and 2003, the Tampa Bay area was awarded the Abilene Trophy, which annually honors the most supportive Air Force city in Air Mobility Command.

The base has a large visitor lodging facility known as the MacDill Inn, a DECA commissary, an AAFES base exchange, and numerous Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) activities such as the Surf&#x27;s Edge all ranks club, a base swimming pool, movie theater, marina, the Raccoon Creek Family Camp for recreational vehicles, the SeaScapes Beach House and the Bay Palms Golf Course.

In June 2024, Reuters reported that a secret propaganda campaign to disparage the Chinese COVID-19 vaccine in the developing world was conducted from MacDill AFB using fake social media accounts.

In December 2021, the Air Force announced that the 6th Air Refueling Wing would re-equip with 24 of the new Boeing KC-46 Pegasus aerial refueling aircraft in the coming years.

<doc id="840798" wikidata="Q1631923" url="?curid=840798" title="Botswana Defence Force Air Wing">
<text>The Botswana Defence Force Air Arm is the air force of the Botswana Defence Force. The Air Arm was formed in 1977 and squadrons are designated with a Z, meaning &quot;squadron&quot;.

==History==
The Air Wing was formed in 1977 and is organisationally part of the Botswana Defence Force.

All squadrons are designated with a Z, which stands for &quot;squadron&quot;. The main base is near Molepolole and was built by mostly foreign contractors between 1992 and 1996. Other airports used are Sir Seretse Khama International Airport and Francistown International Airport.

The backbone of the Air Wing consists of a squadron of former Canadian Canadair CF-116s which are locally designated as BF-5s. Thirteen ex-Canadian CF-116s (ten single-seater CF-5As and three trainer CF-5Bs) were ordered in 1996 to replace BAC Strikemasters, with another three single-seaters and two dual-seaters delivered in 2000. The aircraft were re-designated OJ-1 through 16. For transport, the Air Wing uses Britten-Norman Defenders, CASA C-212 Aviocars, CASA CN-235s and Lockheed C-130B Hercules. The latest addition to the transport fleet was a former U.S. Air Force C-130H Hercules to complement the two existing aircraft.

A combination of Bell 412EP and 412SP helicopters are operated by Z21 and perform a variety of functions; search and rescue, medivac, anti-poaching and troop/VIP transport. In 1993, nine ex-US Army/AMARC Cessna O-2As were delivered for use against poaching.

In 2011, Pilatus Aircraft Ltd announced that the Botswana Defence Force had selected the PC-7 MkII turboprop trainer aircraft to replace their Pilatus PC-7 fleet which has been in service since 1990. The contract value is approximately 40 million Swiss francs to procure a fleet of five PC-7 MkII turboprop trainer aircraft, with ground-based training system including computer-based training, spares, support equipment, as well as pilot and technician conversion training elements. The contract was signed in Gaborone on 13 April 2011.

Botswana is also believed to operate Elbit Systems Silver Arrow and Elbit Hermes 450 UAVs.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 20 October 2011, two PC-7s of the Botswana Defence Force were involved in a midair collision over Letlhakeng 100 km west of Gaborone. Two of the four aircrew involved were killed in the accident.
*On 27 June 2014, The Botswana Defence Force Air Arm lost a Eurocopter AS350 Ecureuil helicopter which crashed during a routine training at Thebephatshwa Air Base. Two pilots who were on board the aircraft, were taken to hospital in a stable condition.
*On 9 February 2017, a BDF CASA C-212 crashed near Thebephatshwa village minutes after leaving the Thebephatshwa Air Base, killing all three people on board. The aircraft was on its way to the capital, Gaborone, which is 90 km away.
*On 27 April 2018, a day before BDF Day, a BF-5 fighter aircraft crashed at the Gaborone Golf Club during aerobatic rehearsals. The pilot was the only recorded casualty.

==Organisation==

*Z1 Transport Squadron – Maparangwane Air Base (Thebephatshwa/Molepolole)
*Z3 Transport (Liaison) Squadron – O-2A, Bat Hawk – Francistown Airport
*Z7 Training Squadron – PC-7MkII, King Air 200 – Maparangwane Air Base (Thebephatshwa/Molepolole)
*Z10 Transport Squadron – C-130, C-212 and CN-235 – Maparangwane Air Base (Thebephatshwa/Molepolole)
*Z12 Transport Squadron – Francistown Airport
*Z21 Transport/Helicopter Squadron – Bell 412 – Maparangwane Air Base (Thebephatshwa/Molepolole)
*Z23 Transport/Helicopter Squadron – AS-350 – Maparangwane Air Base (Thebephatshwa/Molepolole)
*Z28 Fighter Squadron – CF-5 – Maparangwane Air Base (Thebephatshwa/Molepolole)
*VIP Flight Squadron – G-IV – Sir Seretse Khama International Airport

===Air bases===
Maparangwane Air Base is the only full air base in Botswana. Sir Seretse Khama International Airport is a civilian airport that hosts the VIP jets and Francistown Airport is a joint civilian/military airfield with ownership by the BDF since 2011.

===Air defence command and control system===
In 2005 Botswana Defence Force (BDF) awarded the Spanish company Indra a €7.1 million contract for the development and implementation of a full air defence command and control system. The project included the development and implementation of an operational control centre, composed of a total of nine air traffic tracking and control posts to process and concentrate the information regarding the country&#x27;s air space being provided by air surveillance radars, radio communication links with the airships, and air traffic management civil systems.

==Aircraft==
=== Current inventory ===

===Retired aircraft===
Previous aircraft operated by the Air Force were the Gulfstream IV, Cessna 150, Britten-Norman BN-2 Islander, Scottish Aviation Bulldog, and Short Skyvan.
===Future acquisitions===
The Botswana Defence Force Air Wing has been considering a replacement for the BF-5 since 2013, due to the fact that the Canadair CF-5s are old, built in the 1970s, and are increasingly hard to maintain and to find spare parts for them. A report in 2013 by the then the head of the BDF’s air arm, Major General Odirile Mashinyana, recognized the need to replace the aircraft, but also advised that upgrading the BF-5s would allow time to save funds for a well chosen successor. 

Since that time, the KAI T-50 Golden Eagle, used versions of the F-16, and the Saab Gripen were all considered. The most recent, and most likely, potential replacement is the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited new HAL Tejas fighter. As of January 2025, the Tejas is no longer being pursued.

<text>Anthony Richard Conigliaro (January 7, 1945 – February 24, 1990), nicknamed &quot;Tony C&quot; and &quot;Conig&quot;, was an American Major League Baseball outfielder and right-handed batter who played for the Boston Red Sox (1964–1967, 1969–1970, 1975) and California Angels (1971). Born in Revere, Massachusetts, he was a 1962 graduate of St. Mary&#x27;s High School in Lynn, Massachusetts. Conigliaro started his MLB career as a teenager, hitting a home run in his first at-bat during his home field debut in 1964, and reaching 100 career home runs faster than any player in American League history. 

During the Red Sox &quot;Impossible Dream&quot; season of 1967, he was hit in the face by a pitch that caused a severe eye injury and derailed his career. Though he would make a comeback from the injury, his career was not the same afterwards, as he lost vision in one eye over time. After retirement from baseball, he had a heart attack and suffered brain damage at age 37, leaving him severely impaired for the last eight years of his life. Hall of Fame baseball writer Peter Gammons&#x27; article in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; at the time of Congliaro&#x27;s 1990 death is entitled &quot;A Life Torn By Tragedy&quot;.

== Early life ==
Conigliaro was born in Revere, Massachusetts, on January 7, 1945. He was raised in Orient Heights, East Boston, Swampscott and Nahant, Massachusetts. He attended St. Mary&#x27;s High School in Lynn, Massachusetts, where he played starting quarterback on the football team and starred in baseball. In 2020, the school retired his jersey number (12), and unveiled a portrait of Conigliaro that is in the lobby of its Tony Conigliaro Gymnasium.

==Baseball career==
Conigliaro was signed by the Red Sox in 1962, at the age of 17, for $20,000. In 1963, he batted .363 with 24 home runs, and an on-base plus slugging (OPS) of 1.139, playing for the Wellsville Red Sox in the Single-A New York–Penn League. He was the league&#x27;s Rookie-of-the-Year and its Most Valuable Player. In the fall of 1963, he played instructional league baseball in Sarasota, and was included on the Red Sox 1964 roster coming into spring training. At 19 years old he made the team going into the 1964 season, without returning to the minor leagues.

During his 1964 rookie season, Conigliaro batted .290 with 24 home runs and 52 RBI in 111 games, but a pitched ball broke his arm and his toes in August. On the first pitch of his first at-bat in Fenway Park, in the team&#x27;s 1964 opening home game, Conigliaro hit a towering home run in the second inning against the White Sox. The proceeds of that game went to the John F. Kennedy Memorial Library, to honor the recently assassinated President, and those in attendance that day included among others Robert F. Kennedy, Ted Kennedy, and Governor Endicott Peabody. (His first major league hit came a day earlier against the New York Yankees, in New York.)

In 1965, Conigliaro led the league in home runs (32), becoming the youngest home run champion in American League history. He batted .269, with 82 RBI and 82 runs scored, and a .850 OPS. He suffered a cracked wrist from a pitched ball that year, but still played in 138 games. In 1966, he hit .265, with 28 home runs and 93 RBI, playing in 150 games.
During spring training in 1967, Conigliaro suffered a hairline arm fracture from a pitched ball. Through 95 games, he had 20 home runs in only 349 at-bats, while batting .287 with 67 RBI, 59 runs scored, and an .860 OPS. He was selected for the All-Star Game in 1967. In that season, at age 22, he not only reached a career total of 100 home runs, but attained that milestone at the youngest age for an American League player.

On August 18, 1967, in his 95th game of the season, the Red Sox were playing the California Angels at Fenway Park. Conigliaro, batting against Jack Hamilton, was hit by a pitch on his left cheekbone and was carried off the field on a stretcher. He sustained a linear fracture of the left cheekbone and a dislocated jaw with severe damage to his left retina. He was left with 20–300 vision and stabbing headaches. Those in attendance knew the injury was serious from the sound of the ball striking Conigliaro. The batting helmet he was wearing did not have the protective ear-flap that has since become standard, partly due to this incident. 

He missed the remainder of the 1967 season, and was unable to play at all in the 1968 season because of poor vision. In 1967, he was replaced in right field by José Tartabull and Ken Harrelson. The Red Sox reached the World Series, losing to the St. Louis Cardinals four games to three. During the World Series, Harrelson hit .077 in 13 at-bats, and Tartabull hit .154 in 13 at-bats. During the regular season, the two combined for only three home runs and 24 RBI in 327 at-bats.

A year and a half later, in 1969, Conigliaro made a remarkable return, hitting 20 home runs with 82 RBI in 141 games. He earned Comeback Player of the Year honors. In 1970, he reached career-high numbers in home runs (36) and RBI (116). Conigliaro said he batted most of the season with his left eye almost closed. That season, he and his brother Billy formed two-thirds of the Red Sox outfield. Shortly after the season ended, on October 11, 1970, the Red Sox traded, Conigliaro, Ray Jarvis and Jerry Moses to the California Angels for Ken Tatum, Jarvis Tatum and Doug Griffin. (In 1970, pitcher Ken Tatum had hit the Orioles Paul Blair in the face with a pitch that resulted in multiple fractures and the need for surgery.) There was some controversy surrounding the trade.

His vision deteriorated in 1971, including a lack of depth perception and blind spots in his vision. He went on the disabled list in July, and formally retired from baseball at the end of the season, only 26 years old. In 1971, Conigliaro played in only 74 games, batting .222 with four home runs. In 1972, he opened a resort in Nahant. He returned to the Red Sox briefly in 1975 as a designated hitter, hitting two home runs in 21 games, but was forced to retire because his eyesight had been permanently damaged. He played his final games for the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox of the International League.
Conigliaro batted .267, with 162 home runs and 501 RBI during his 802-game Red Sox career. With the Angels, he hit .222 with 4 home runs and 15 RBI in 74 games. He is the second-youngest player to hit his 100th homer (after Mel Ott), and the youngest American League player to do so.

==Final years and death==
After his retirement, in the fall of 1975, Conigliaro opened a restaurant in Providence, Rhode Island, managed by his brother Billy. In September of that same year, he was hired by WJAR TV 10 in Providence as a sports anchor. In August 1976, he moved to a similar position at KGO-TV Channel 7 in San Francisco, and won an Emmy award. He had also owned a health food store in California. It is also reported he worked as a sportscaster in Providence.

On January 9, 1982, then 37-year-old Conigliaro was in Boston to interview for a broadcasting position when he suffered a heart attack while being driven to the airport by his brother Billy. Shortly thereafter, he suffered a stroke and lapsed into a coma. Conigliaro never fully recovered and suffered slight brain damage due to the stroke, until his death more than eight years later, in February 1990, at the age of 45 from pneumonia and kidney failure. In commemoration, the Red Sox wore black armbands that season. He is interred at Holy Cross Cemetery in Malden, Massachusetts. Conigliaro&#x27;s parents and brothers cared for him closely during his last eight years, during which time he was bedridden, unable to walk and barely able to speak.

During 1982, Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis, whose wife had come out of a coma three years earlier, visited Conigliaro to try and give him some optimism. In 1983, when insurance funds were running low to cover Conigliaro&#x27;s medical care, teammates and others stepped in to raise money to help Conigliaro and the family with his care. In one April fundraising event at Boston&#x27;s Symphony Hall, Frank Sinatra, Dionne Warwick, Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio and Willie Mays were among those raising money to support Conigliaro ($230,000). Conigliaro, who once had a modest singing career, had recorded a song with Warwick in 1976. He had performed on The Merv Griffin Show a number of times. 

Since 1990, the Tony Conigliaro Award, instituted by the Red Sox after his death, is given annually to the MLB player who best overcomes obstacles and adversities through the attributes of spirit, determination and courage that were considered Tony&#x27;s trademarks.

While the tragedy of his life is well recorded, others have also tried to find inspiring aspects in his determination to overcome obstacles and reinvent himself.

==Conigliaro&#x27;s Corner==

For the start of the 2007 season, Red Sox ownership added a new 200-seat bleacher section on the right field roof, providing an additional 200 available tickets for the season. It was named &quot;Conigliaro&#x27;s Corner&quot; in honor of Conigliaro. The seats were being marketed specifically towards families. As of May 2007, the section was reserved for Red Sox Nation members on Saturdays and Red Sox Kid Nation members on Sundays. The seats were removed prior to the start of the 2009 season.

<doc id="840815" wikidata="Q6251897" url="?curid=840815" title="John Parker (Labour politician)">
<text>Herbert John Harvey Parker (15 July 1906 – 24 November 1987) was a British Labour Party politician. He was first elected as the Member of Parliament for Romford in November 1935. After boundary changes, he continued as MP for Dagenham from 1945, remaining in the House of Commons until he retired in June 1983. As the longest-serving MP, he was the Father of the House of Commons from 1979 to 1983. When he left parliament in 1983, he was the last serving Member of Parliament to have served in the Commons before the Second World War.

With over 47 years in office, he was the longest-serving Labour MP in the party&#x27;s history until 15 December 2017, when his record was overtaken by Dennis Skinner.

==Early and private life==
Parker was born in Bristol and raised in Liverpool. He was educated at Marlborough College and St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he was Chair of the Oxford University Labour Club. 

He married Zena Mimardiere in 1943; the couple had one son.

==Political career==
He contested the seat of Holland with Boston in Lincolnshire in the 1931 general election, but the sitting National Liberal MP James Blindell was reelected.

In the 1935 general election, Parker was elected as MP for Romford in Essex, which he represented until 1945. He was elected as MP for Dagenham at the 1945 general election, a new seat carved out of the Romford constituency. (His Labour colleague Thomas Macpherson was elected in Romford in 1945, but lost the seat to the Conservative John Lockwood in 1950).

Parker was briefly a junior minister from 1945 to 1946, serving as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Dominions Office, with future prime minister James Callaghan as his Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS). He lost this position as a result of the strong views he held regarding South Africa. He remained a backbencher afterwards, serving on several Parliamentary committees, including the Procedure Committee from 1966 to 1973.

His private member&#x27;s bill introduced in 1952 to repeal the Sunday Observance Act 1780 was rejected; however, another private member&#x27;s bill of his became the Legitimacy Act 1959, dealing with the legitimacy of children from void marriages and that of children whose parents married after their birth. He also shepherded a ten-minute rule bill into law, the British Nationality (No 2) Act 1964, which implemented into British law the United Nations Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.

He remained MP for Dagenham until he retired at the 1983 general election. He was the last serving MP to have been elected before the Second World War, and he was the Father of the House of Commons from 1979 to 1983. His former PPS, James Callaghan, was the next MP to hold this honorary title.

Parker was associated with the Fabian Society throughout his political career. He became General Secretary of the New Fabian Research Bureau in 1933 and was General Secretary of the Fabian Society from 1939 to 1945. He was subsequently its Vice-Chairman and Chairman. He became President of the Fabian Society in 1980.

He wrote several books, including &quot;42 Days in the Soviet Union&quot; (1946) and &quot;Labour Marches On&quot; (1947), and his memoirs, &quot;Father of the House&quot; (1982). His archive of papers, spanning nearly 40 years of public office from 1943 to 1982, are held by the London School of Economics as part of the British Library of Political and Economic Science.

==Death==
Parker died in London on 24 November 1987, at the age of 81.

<text>Paul Morton (May 22, 1857 – January 19, 1911) was a U.S. businessman, and served as the 36th Secretary of the Navy under Theodore Roosevelt.

==Biography==
He served as the U.S. Secretary of the Navy between 1904 and 1905. Previous to this, he had been vice president of the Santa Fe Railroad. When it came to light that the Santa Fe had given illegal rebates under Morton, he was forced out of the cabinet to avoid scandal, though Roosevelt maintained that Morton himself was unaware of the improprieties. After leaving government service, Morton was President of Equitable Life Assurance Society.

Born in Detroit, Michigan, and growing up in Nebraska City, Nebraska, he was the younger brother of Joy Morton, founder of Morton Salt, and the son of J. Sterling Morton, former Acting Governor of Nebraska, founder of Arbor Day, and Secretary of Agriculture under President Grover Cleveland. Though his father was a &quot;Bourbon&quot; (i.e. conservative) Democrat, Paul Morton was a Progressive Republican. This shift of party by father/son cabinet secretaries is paralleled by that of Henry Cantwell Wallace, who served as a Progressive Republican Secretary of Agriculture under Harding and Coolidge, and his son Henry A. Wallace who served in the same office as a Democrat under Franklin D. Roosevelt.

George Burroughs Torrey painted a portrait of him.

Morton&#x27;s daughter, Pauline Morton Sabin, became an influential figure in the Republican party, and played an important role in the Repeal of Prohibition in the United States.

Paul Morton died in New York City on January 19, 1911.

<doc id="840826" wikidata="Q1848488" url="?curid=840826" title="Manor Park railway station">
<text>Manor Park railway station is on the Great Eastern Main Line serving Manor Park in the London Borough of Newham, east London. It is down the line from London Liverpool Street and is situated between and . Its three-letter station code is MNP and it is in Travelcard Zone 3/4. It is currently managed and served by the Elizabeth line.

Manor Park is a short walk from Woodgrange Park on the Gospel Oak to Barking line, and an out-of-station interchange is available one stop to the west, at Forest Gate, for Wanstead Park.

==History==
===Great Eastern Railway (1873-1922)===
The railway through the site of Manor Park station was first built in 1839 by the Eastern Counties Railway as the first part of what was to become the Great Eastern Main Line, which was constructed between and .

The original name for the station was Manor Park &quot;and&quot; Little Ilford. When the original line was built the Manor House had its own access road and bridge that crossed the railway line. Little Ilford referred to the settlement on the western bank of the River Roding opposite Ilford. 

When the station opened on 6 January 1873 the land north of the station was undeveloped. The access bridge was replaced by a bridge (Forest Drive) over the railway at the station, and the station building was located on this. The Manor House itself succumbed to housing development and had disappeared by the 1890s. A signal box was provided on the upside of the line west of the station.

A goods yard was provided in 1882 which was located east of the station and a new signal box provided there to control the entrance to that yard. The earlier box was closed.

As London grew, developers starting acquiring land to build new properties and the demand at stations such as Manor Park increased. The GER realised that the two track main line was not enough to cope with the new suburban traffic and longer distance traffic and still provide a reliable service for the minor stations such as Manor Park. The answer was a programme of quadrupling (providing two additional tracks) along the route and this work took place in phases.

The GER was mostly restricted to the land it owned and work commenced c1890 in preparing for the quadrupling that was complete in 1894. The two new lines called the Through Lines, were provided south of the station and the goods yard (which was moved slightly southward) was connected to these lines. In the case of Manor Park some additional land to the north was purchased to accommodate what were now the Local Lines. A new signal box was provided east of the station and the 1882 box became an office. No platforms were provided on the Through Lines as these were used by longer distance services.

An additional track was also provided and opened on 4 April 1893 which ran between the west end of Manor Park and Forest Gate Junction. This was a reception road for the new goods yard located there. 

Table 298 of the Bradshaw&#x27;s timetable guide of July 1922 shows Manor Park to have a regular services of trains from Liverpool Street or Fenchurch Street. These trains terminated at Ilford, Chadwell Heath, Romford or Gidea Park or worked through to the Fairlop Loop. The station is referred to as Manor Park &quot;for&quot; Little Ilford in this publication.

In 1923, the GER amalgamated with other railways to form the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER).

===London and North Eastern Railway (1923 - 1947)===
During this period local stopping trains were generally hauled by LNER Class N7 locomotives on trains of corridor type carriage stock.
Plans were drawn up in the 1930s to electrify the suburban lines from Liverpool Street to Shenfield at 1,500VDC and work was started on implementing this. However, the outbreak of the Second World War brought the project to a temporary halt and it was not until 1949 that the scheme was completed.

The station was damaged by bombing on 29 July 1944 during World War II.

As part of the electrification scheme a flyover was built just north of Manor Park. The flyover was designed to remove conflicting moves between Local Line and Through Line trains and meant that Maryland, Forest Gate and Manor Park stations required new platforms to be provided on the Through Lines as these three locations only had Local Line platforms after the 1893/4 quadrupling.

An additional fifth line known as the Up Passenger Avoiding line was added which allows up trains to switch from the up Through to Up Local lines. After the work was completed the Local Lines became the Electric Lines and the Through Lines became the Main Lines.

===British Railways (1948 - 1994)===
On 1 January 1948, following nationalisation of the railways, Manor Park became part of the British Railways Eastern Region. The electrification scheme and its associated works were finished and from February 1949 the Class 306 EMUs operated the service to steam timings but an accelerated all electric schedule was introduced in September 1949.

The signal box was closed as part of the electrification scheme on 14 August 1949 and a new box at Aldersbrook north of Manor Park took over working the area&#x27;s signals.

The 1500 DC electrification system was converted to 25/6.35 KV AC operation between 4 and 6 November 1960.

In 1980 the first Class 315 EMUs were introduced to replace the Class 306s and were used on passenger trains serving Forest Gate.

The railway was sectorised in 1982 and Manor Park and the trains calling at it became part of the London and South-East sector. On 10 June 1986 this was rebranded to become Network South East which was responsible for working services up to privatisation.

===The privatisation era (1994 - present day)===
In April 1994 Railtrack became responsible for the maintenance of the infrastructure. Railtrack was succeeded by Network Rail in 2002.

Between privatisation on 1 April 1994 and 4 January 1997 the station was operated by a non-privatised business unit.
Since then passenger services calling at the station have been operated by the following franchises:
* First Great Eastern 5 January 1997 – 31 March 2004
* National Express East Anglia 1 April 2004 – 4 February 2012
* Abellio Greater Anglia between 5 February 2012– 30 May 2015
* MTR TFL Rail between 31 May 2015 and 23 May 2022 after which the line was rebranded as the Elizabeth Line who are the current operator.

In 2015, services run by Greater Anglia were intermediately rebranded to TfL Rail, as part of the development of the Elizabeth Line. Significant upgrades were made to the station, including the installation of three lifts, a new bridge, staircases, and signage.

In June 2017, new trains began entering service in preparation for the opening of the Crossrail. The Class 315 trains were finally taken out of service in 2022. Through services to central London, Heathrow Airport and Reading started running on the Crossrail line (rebranded the Elizabeth line) on 22 November 2022.

In early 2019 step free access was introduced to Manor Park station.

==Services==
All services at Manor Park are operated by the Elizabeth line using EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 8 tph to of which 2 continue to 
* 8 tph to 

During the peak hours, the station is served by a number of additional services between London Liverpool Street and . These services do not call at .

On Sundays, the service to and from Shenfield is reduced to 4 tph, with alternating services running only as far as Gidea Park.


==Future development==
New trains began entering service in 2017. Platforms 1 and 2 are only and long respectively and cannot physically be extended to accommodate the new trains, which will be over in length, so selective door operation will be used. The freight loop around platform 1 is due to be removed and replaced by a new loop line further down-line, west of .

Due to the narrow platforms and the layout of the station, fitting lifts for disabled access is difficult, requiring the walkways to be rebuilt and closing parts of the station for several months. The station will receive new ticket machines and gates, an accessible toilet and new retail space.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 101, 304, 474 and W19 serve the station.

<text>Rogers Clark Ballard Morton (September 19, 1914 – April 19, 1979) was an American politician who served as the U.S. Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of Commerce during the administrations of presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, respectively. He also served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Maryland.

Morton was born in Louisville, Kentucky, and moved to a farm on the Eastern Shore of Maryland in the early 1950s. In 1962, he was elected to the House of Representatives, in which capacity he established a pro-environment record. Morton would joke that his two middle initials stood for &quot;Chesapeake Bay&quot;. In 1968, Morton played a major role in Richard Nixon&#x27;s campaign for president, and was chosen by Nixon in 1969 to serve as chairman of the Republican National Committee.

In the elections of 1970, Morton was considered a strong candidate to challenge Joseph Tydings for his U.S. Senate seat from Maryland, but he chose instead to remain as chairman of the RNC. In 1971, President Nixon tapped Morton to serve as Secretary of the Interior, during which time he oversaw the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System and the 1973 oil crisis. Morton was the only person from the East Coast to serve as head of the Interior Department in the 20th century.

Following Nixon&#x27;s resignation due to the Watergate Scandal, Morton continued in his post in the Gerald Ford administration until 1975, when he was nominated to serve as Secretary of Commerce. From April to August 1976, Morton served as Ford&#x27;s campaign manager in his bid for election. Morton retired from politics following Ford&#x27;s election defeat. Three years later, he died of cancer at his home in Easton on the eastern shore of Maryland.

==Early life and career==
Morton was born in Louisville, the son of David Clark Morton, a physician, and his wife, Mary Harris Ballard Morton, an heiress to a flour milling business. He was related to George Rogers Clark, a military officer who served during the American Revolutionary War. Morton was one of three children; his brother Thruston B. Morton also had a career in politics, serving as chairman of the Republican National Committee and representing Kentucky in both the United States House of Representatives and then the United States Senate.

Morton received his early education from the Woodberry Forest School near Orange, Virginia, and in 1937 graduated from Yale University, where he was a brother of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Phi chapter). Like his father, Morton worked to become a physician and entered the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. However, he dropped out after only one year. In 1939, Morton married the former Anne Jones. They had two children, David Clark and Anne Morton.

In 1938, Morton was commissioned in the United States Navy but only served for a short time due to problems with his back. Afterwards, he entered his family&#x27;s flour business, Ballard &amp; Ballard. In 1941, at the outset of World War II, Morton enlisted in the Armored Field Artillery of the United States Army as a private and served in the European Theater. He received a commission during the war and left the army as a captain in 1945.

After the war, Morton returned to the family business, where he served as president from 1947 to 1951. In 1952, the business was merged into the Pillsbury Flour Company, where Morton went on to serve as a director and a member of the executive committee for several more years.

==Congressional career==
In 1947, Morton spent a great deal of time helping his brother Thruston in his ultimately successful campaign for election to the House of Representatives in Kentucky. After this initial exposure to politics, Morton moved to the Eastern Shore of Maryland in the early 1950s, where he set up a cattle farm along the Wye River in Talbot County. In 1962, Morton decided to challenge Democratic incumbent Thomas Francis Johnson of . Johnson, who was reeling from a political scandal, lost to Morton in the general election. Morton was lauded for not making Johnson&#x27;s legal troubles his primary campaign issue.

Morton was reelected to Congress four more times, and served from 1963 until 1971. In Congress, Morton worked to enact legislation that would preserve the Chesapeake Bay, including laws reducing pollution into the bay, working for the creation of a national park on Assateague Island, and providing funds to the Army Corps of Engineers to model how the Bay functions as an estuary. Concerning civil rights, Morton voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but cast no vote on the Civil Rights Act of 1968.

During the 1968 Republican National Convention, Morton served as the floor manager for eventual presidential nominee Richard Nixon. Morton also delivered the speech nominating Spiro Agnew, then-governor of Maryland, as the vice presidential candidate.

Due to his role in Nixon&#x27;s election campaign and his environmental advocacy, Morton expected to be appointed as Secretary of the Interior in 1969. However, he was passed over for the position in favor of a westerner. He had also been considered for Nixon&#x27;s vice presidential running mate, but lost out to Agnew. In January 1969, to recognize his efforts, Nixon appointed Morton as chairman of the Republican National Committee. As chairman, Morton was granted ex officio cabinet rank by Nixon, an unprecedented practice that ultimately continued through the administration of Gerald Ford.

==1970 United States Senate election==
In 1969, leading up to the 1970 elections, Morton was considered one of the strongest potential candidates to challenge incumbent Democratic senator Joseph Tydings. Morton had sought the Republican nomination for Maryland&#x27;s other U.S. Senate seat in the 1968 elections, but bowed out in favor of Congressman Charles Mathias to prevent a primary battle.

Speculation that Morton would seek election to Tydings&#x27; seat increased after an editorial in the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; encouraged him to challenge Tydings. Sources within the administration of Vice President Spiro Agnew, who was formerly governor of Maryland, were also commenting that Morton would make a strong candidate and would likely run. When Morton stated he would be making an important announcement with President Nixon in December 1969, it seemed all but certain at the time that it would be to declare his candidacy.

However, Republicans around the country were concerned that Morton, who had just been appointed chairman of the RNC in January 1969, would resign during the election season to better handle the battle with Tydings. President Nixon shared their concerns, and encouraged Morton to remain as chairman. On December 16, 1969, with Nixon by his side, Morton announced that his priorities were with the national committee, and that he would not seek Tydings&#x27; seat. Morton also threw his full support for the nomination behind J. Glenn Beall Jr., a freshman member of the House from Cumberland, Mathias&#x27;s successor in the House, and son of former senator James Glenn Beall.

Morton&#x27;s decision not to challenge Tydings initially worried Maryland Republicans, who saw Morton as one of their best candidates. National Republican strategists had also begun to write off Tydings&#x27; seat as unwinnable for the 1970 election because of Tydings&#x27; wealth and popularity in the dense urban areas of Montgomery County and Baltimore. However, despite initial misgivings by state Republicans, Beall defeated Tydings on November 3, 1970, by a margin of more than 30,000 votes.

==Secretary of the Interior==

Morton continued to serve in the House and as chairman of the RNC until 1971, when he was nominated to be Secretary of the Interior by President Nixon. He was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate Subcommittee on the Interior, though some concerns regarding Morton&#x27;s record of environmental protection were raised by Phillip Berry, then-President of the Sierra Club. Morton&#x27;s predecessor, Wally Hickel, had been chosen over Morton to fill the job in 1969, but was fired by Nixon in late 1970 for criticizing White House policy. Morton was the only person from the east coast to serve as Interior Secretary in the 20th century.

Upon assuming the office of Secretary of the Interior, Morton promised he would seek to &quot;purify the environment&quot;. However, as his tenure progressed, he was gradually isolated from the proceedings of the White House and lost several major divisions to other departments. During the 1973 oil crisis, for example, the oil and natural gas divisions of the department were transferred to the Office of Emergency Preparedness. Furthermore, though Morton was the one who announced the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, speculation was put forward that he did not play a major role in determining its route.

As he was leaving his post in 1975, further criticism was directed at Morton for his overseeing the partial dismantling of the Interior Department. He was also criticized for lacking the vigor necessary to serve as head of a cabinet department, and for failing to see through the proposed creation of a new, stronger cabinet department that would have replaced Interior.

==Secretary of Commerce and the Ford administration==
Following the resignation of President Nixon in the Watergate scandal, Morton continued in his position as Secretary of the Interior in the administration of President Gerald Ford. In March 1975, while still serving as the head of the Interior Department, Morton was nominated by Ford to serve as the next Secretary of Commerce. Ford cited Morton&#x27;s extensive business experience as the primary factor for selecting him and expressed the hope that Morton would be able to &quot;encourage American business to expand energy development and conservation efforts&quot;.

In January 1976, Ford announced Morton would be resigning as commerce secretary to instead serve as Counselor to the President with cabinet rank. Morton&#x27;s new position was to advise the president on domestic and economic policy. In addition, Morton was to serve as the special liaison to the political committee to elect President Ford. Morton&#x27;s duties blurred the line between his public and political duties, and caused controversy concerning how Morton would divide his time between the White House and Ford&#x27;s election campaign, and how much of his salary would be supplied by taxpayers versus the Ford election committee. In rebuttal, Morton stated &quot;you can&#x27;t separate government from politics&quot;, and that Presidential aides should be allowed to offer political advice.

In April 1976, Morton was named campaign manager for Ford leading up to the 1976 presidential election. He replaced former U.S. Representative Bo Callaway of Georgia, who was forced to resign following allegations of improper use of authority while he was Secretary of the Army. Morton directed Ford&#x27;s campaign until August 25, 1976, when he was reassigned as chairman of a steering committee and was replaced by James Baker of Houston, Texas. Morton&#x27;s demotion was at his own request; he said that he no longer wished to bear &quot;the responsibility and accountability of the chairmanship&quot;. After the 1976 campaign, Morton retired from politics.

==Later life==
After his retirement, Morton lived in his farm, &quot;Presqu&#x27;isle&quot;, near Easton, Maryland, where he operated a boat construction business.

Morton had been diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1973, but he said that the disease was in its early phase and was still treatable. In 1979, however, Morton died of the cancer at his home in Easton. He is interred in Old Wye Cemetery in Wye Mills, Maryland.

<doc id="840829" wikidata="Q3405340" url="?curid=840829" title="Tony Conigliaro Award">
<text>The Tony Conigliaro Award is a national recognition instituted in 1990 by the Boston Red Sox to honor the memory of Tony Conigliaro. It is given annually to a Major League Baseball (MLB) player who best &quot;overcomes an obstacle and adversity through the attributes of spirit, determination, and courage that were trademarks of Conigliaro.&quot;

Conigliaro debuted with the Red Sox in 1964, and was selected to the MLB All-Star Game in the 1967 season. Subsequently, he was hit in the face by a pitch at Fenway Park on August 18, 1967. After missing the rest of the year and all of 1968, he made a comeback in 1969, homering on opening day. He then hit 20 home runs in that season, winning &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Comeback Player of the Year Award. In 1970, he posted career highs in home runs with 36 and RBIs with 116, but vision problems continued to persist; his performance fell off, and he was never the same player. After a final comeback attempt in 1975, Conigliaro retired at age 30.

Conigliaro died in 1990, and the Red Sox instituted the award in his honor. A panel is composed of the media, representatives of the commissioner, and the two leagues&#x27; offices. The selection is made by a panel of voters and the award is presented at the annual dinner of the Boston chapter of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA), normally held in December or January, by members of the Conigliaro family.

==Award winners==


 The award is presented at the annual banquet of the Boston chapter of the BBWAA, which was not held in December 2021, possibly due to the 2021–22 Major League Baseball lockout. The 2021 winner of the Tony Conigliaro Award was instead announced the following year.

<text>Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c. (Irish: &quot;Bainc-Aontas Éireann&quot;) is one of the so-called Big Four commercial banks in the Republic of Ireland. AIB offers a full range of personal, business and corporate banking services. The bank also offers a range of general insurance products such as home, travel and car. It offers life assurance and pensions through its tied agency with Irish Life Assurance plc.

In December 2010 the Irish government took a majority stake in the bank, which eventually grew to 99.8%. AIB&#x27;s shares are currently traded on the Irish Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange, but its shares were delisted from these exchanges between 2011 and 2017, following its effective nationalisation. The remainder of its publicly traded shares were listed on the Enterprise Securities Market of the Irish Stock Exchange until 23 June 2017.

AIB also owns Allied Irish Bank (GB) in Great Britain and AIB (NI) in Northern Ireland. In November 2010, it sold its 22.5% stake in M&amp;T Bank in the United States. At the beginning of 2008 AIB entered the Latvian, Estonian and Lithuanian markets by acquiring AmCredit mortgage finance business from the Baltic – American Enterprise Fund. This stake was sold at a loss to Swedbank in 2012.

In 2009, Allied Irish Banks along with its competitor Bank of Ireland accepted a €3.5 billion bailout from the government of Ireland as a part of the Bank Recapitalisation Scheme. Over several further tranches, the total bailout of AIB (including EBS) amounted to €20.7 billion.

In June 2017, the Irish government completed an IPO of Allied Irish Banks. In December 2021, when the company was valued less than 6 billion euro on the public market, the government announced it would start gradually selling its stake. The CEO of AIB is Colin Hunt since March 2019. Jim Pettigrew was appointed chair of the board in October 2021.

AIB has been designated as a Significant Institution since the entry into force of European Banking Supervision in late 2014, and as a consequence is directly supervised by the European Central Bank.

==Name==
Allied Irish Banks is usually referred to, both inside and outside the company, simply as AIB and often by its trade name of &quot;Allied Irish Bank&quot; (singular). In Northern Ireland, the bank traded as First Trust Bank until November 2019, while in Great Britain, it is called &quot;Allied Irish Bank (GB)&quot;—the only part of the operation where the full name, in the singular, is still in day-to-day use. Initially, the bank operated under the names of its former constituent companies, alongside a new AIB logo, a circle divided in three with an &quot;A&quot; at the centre. From 1970, these were replaced by &quot;Allied Irish Banks&quot;. In 1990, AIB introduced a new logo (prompted, it was said in some quarters, by the remarkable similarity between its previous logo and that of Mercedes-Benz.) Since then, the bank has preferred to be referred to as &quot;AIB&quot;, though &quot;Allied Irish Banks plc&quot; remains its legal name.

The bank is often referred to colloquially as &quot;AIB Bank&quot;, an example of a redundant acronym. This is due to the name &quot;AIB Bank&quot; being adopted for the Republic of Ireland branch banking business at the time of the 1990 rebrand (with the word &quot;Bank&quot; being printed in the green stripe in the logo). This version of the logo is no longer used in print advertising but can still be seen on the façades of most AIB branches in the Republic. The &#x27;Trustee Savings Banks&#x27; similarly rebranded to &quot;TSB Bank&quot; in 1993. The new logo features a depiction of Noah&#x27;s Ark, after a carving on a Celtic cross at Killary Church near Lobinstown in County Meath, which dates from the 9th century.

==History==
Allied Irish Banks Limited was formed in 1966 as a new company that acquired three Irish banks: &quot;Provincial Bank of Ireland&quot;, the &quot;Royal Bank of Ireland&quot;, and the &quot;Munster &amp; Leinster Bank&quot;. In 1966, AIB&#x27;s aggregate assets were IR£255 million (€323.8 million)—as at 31 December 2005, the AIB Group had assets of €133 billion. In the 1980s the introduction of their Automatic Teller Machine Network called Banklink just shortly after the Bank of Ireland Pass. ATMs were only available in cities and major towns in the 1980s but arrived into smaller and medium towns during the 1990s.

===Early history===
In 1825, Provincial Bank commenced operations, pioneering joint stock branch banking in Ireland. It also established a branch in London.

Royal Bank of Ireland (RBI) commenced operations in 1836, becoming known for its mercantile links.

Shaw&#x27;s Bank later merged with Royal Bank in 1837.

In 1864, the Munster Bank was established. In 1867, the Munster Bank purchased some of the branches of the unsuccessful Union Bank of Ireland. In 1870, The Munster Bank acquired the David La Touche &amp; Son bank (established 1693). In 1885, the Munster Bank failed due to debt and ran out of cash, causing it to close all of its branches. Also in 1885, The Munster and Leinster Bank commenced operations.

In 1923, the Royal Bank of Ireland bought the Irish Free State business of the Belfast Banking Company, which in turn bought the Northern Ireland business of the Royal Bank.

===1985 ICI collapse===
&quot;The Can of Worms at ICI&quot; was the headline in &quot;Business &amp; Finance&quot; magazine on 8 November 1984. The Insurance Corporation of Ireland (ICI) was a wholly owned subsidiary of AIB when it collapsed in 1985 with losses of over IR£200 million. When it was discovered in November 1984 that ICI was operating below the statutory reserve ratio, a request for further capital was made to AIB — ICI had returned a profit of more than £80 million the previous year. This collapse occurred at a time of deep economic recession in Ireland. The level of Government debt at that time was 116% of GDP. But the Irish taxpayer bailed ICI out of its difficulties. The Irish Government did so to ensure a continuation of the insurance business and to protect policyholders. AIB claimed that it could not resolve the problems of ICI without putting its core banking business in jeopardy. The investment of £85 million by AIB in ICI was written off and the cost to the Irish taxpayer was £400 million.

On 9 September 2010 AIB reached agreement to sell a 66% stake in BZ-WBK to Santander for €3.1 billion, the balance of the shares to be sold on the open market. Any purchase over 66% would have forced Santander to make an offer to buy the entire company.

===Recent history===
Between 1999 and 2001 AIB had an interest in Keppel TatLee Bank in Singapore, but withdrew after Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC) acquired it.

After suffering large losses due to the activities of rogue trader John Rusnak at Allfirst (see below) in April 2003, AIB completed a deal merging Allfirst with M&amp;T Bank Corporation, which is headquartered in Buffalo, New York. In November 2010, AIB sold its 22.5% stake (26.7 million shares) in M&amp;T. The shares were sold at US$77.50 per share and generated $2.1 billion. The sale was part of AIB&#x27;s effort to raise capital amidst the ongoing financial crisis in Ireland. AIB maintains its current US customer treasury services from its branch in New York.

At the beginning of 2008 AIB entered the Latvian, Estonian and Lithuanian markets by acquiring the &quot;AmCredit&quot; mortgage finance business from the Baltic American Enterprise Fund. Now AIB operates as a branch of this financial group in Estonia and Lithuania (update needed), operations in Latvia have ceased (see below). In 2008 AIB operated through its local branches providing financial services under established AmCredit brand in all three countries. AmCredit operated as a single product mortgage business, but the company is expanding the range of banking products. All AmCredit&#x27;s mortgage customers automatically became customers of the AIB branch in their country. The goal of AIB is to become a full service customer focused bank in the Baltic region. The branch in Latvia was operating between 26 November 2007 (date of registration) and 20 September 2012 (date of liquidation). Its mortgage portfolio of 800 loans was acquired by Swedbank.

In February 2008, AIB entered into an agreement to acquire a 49.99% interest in Bulgarian American Credit Bank (BACB), a specialist provider of secured finance to small and medium-sized companies in Bulgaria. AIB later sold its stake in BACB to a Bulgarian private-equity fund for a nominal sum in May 2011.

The Irish government received shares of €3.5 billion in AIB in 2009 as part of measures to recapitalise the bank.
In April 2010, AIB announced that the Irish government would receive a stake of 16% or 17% in the bank. The Irish State had been due to receive dividends on those shares, but EU regulations state that banks that get State aid cannot make cash payments. This forced AIB to give the government shares instead.

The bank is currently involved in a number of &quot;sale and leaseback&quot; deals with its properties. In 2005 it sold an extension to its Ballsbridge Bankcentre headquarters for €367 million.

In February 2006 the bank announced record pre-tax profits of €1.7 billion, a 23% rise on the previous year and the largest ever for an Irish bank. The majority of the increase came from its Republic of Ireland operations, but with its Capital Markets in Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Poland and American divisions also making significant contributions. This led to criticism from some newspapers, as their profit per customer was some three times that of other European banks. Former Labour Party leader Pat Rabbitte called for more competition in the Irish banking sector. In August 2006 the bank again announced record profits for the first half of 2006, making €1.2 billion before tax, equating to €1.2 million per hour.

===2008 share price collapse===
The international credit crunch presented the first challenge to AIB — namely a dramatic fall-off in liquidity. As AIB depends to a significant extent on the international financial markets for liquidity due to an insufficient deposit base, this has impacted the bank severely. The Irish government stepped in with a guarantee which effectively granted a triple A rating on AIB debt, thus freeing up its access to finance.

The second and more serious problem, unacknowledged by bank management, the financial regulator and the Irish government, is solvency. The question concerning solvency has arisen due to domestic problems in the crashing Irish property market. AIB, like most Irish financial institutions, has substantial exposure to property developers in their loan portfolio. These property developers are currently suffering from gross over-supply of property, much still unsold, while demand has evaporated. The massive immigration from Eastern Europe which had propped up demand has now reversed due to rapidly rising unemployment in Ireland. Irish property developers own speculated billions of euros of overvalued land parcels such as urban brownfield and greenfield sites, and also agricultural land at an average value of €23,600 per acre (US$32,000 per acre or €60,000 per hectare) which is several multiples above the value of equivalent land in other European countries.

AIB correctly identify a systematic risk of triggering an even more severe financial crisis in Ireland if they were to call in the loans as they fall due. The loans are subject to terms and conditions, referred to as &quot;covenants&quot;. Although AIB is not one of the banks listed as waiving these covenants, confidence in the Irish banking system is low as a result of other Irish banks electing to waive these financial safeguards in fear of provoking the (inevitable) bankruptcy of many property developers and banks are thought to be &quot;&quot;lending some developers further cash to pay their interest bills, which means that they are not classified as &#x27;bad debts&#x27; by the banks&quot;.&quot;

Furthermore, AIB&#x27;s balance sheet indicated only limited impairment (bad debt) provisions. Their 2008 1st half financial report only accounts for an impairment provision of 0.21%. This does not appear to be consistent with the real negative changes taking place in property market fundamentals. The Central Bank told the Oireachtas Enterprise Committee that shareholders who lost their money in the banking collapse are to blame for their fate and got what was coming to them for not keeping bank chiefs in check, but did admit that the Central Bank had failed to give sufficient warning about reckless lending to property developers.

In contrast, on 7 October 2008, Danske Bank wrote off a substantial sum largely due to property-related losses incurred by its Irish subsidiary, National Irish Bank. Write downs by the domestically owned Irish banks are only now beginning to take place.

AIB&#x27;s subsidiary Goodbody Stockbrokers continually issued &quot;buy&quot; recommendations for its then parent, notwithstanding its worsening financial position, and used Client Discretionary mandates to invest their monies in Allied Irish Banks at the start of the post-2008 Irish banking crisis in November 2008, which generated adverse comment. When asked if they had ever issued a sell notice on AIB, a Goodbody spokesman said &quot;I don&#x27;t know if we even keep records going back that far&quot;.

===Rescue package 2009===
On 12 February 2009 the Irish government arranged a €7 billion rescue plan for AIB and Bank of Ireland. The bank&#x27;s capital value had fallen to €486 million, rather less than its 70% holding in Bank Zachodni in Poland.

Goodbody Stockbrokers was sold as part of the restructuring plan for €24 million. The Financial Times commented that the lowly price tag placed on Ireland&#x27;s oldest stockbroker and &quot;one-time bastion of Ireland&#x27;s Protestant business elite&quot; was just another measure of the dramatic decline of the Irish economy. AIB were likely to have had to indemnify the new owners of Goodbody Stockbrokers against any legal action arising from the firm&#x27;s boom-time trading.

===2010: Nationalisation===
On 30 September 2010, the Irish Government announced plans to use its National Pensions Reserve to inject €3.7 billion of capital into Allied Irish Banks, becoming the majority shareholder and effectively nationalizing the bank.

AIB needed to raise additional capital due to increasing losses on bad loans incurred from the real estate bubble, and Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan stated that the bank was unable to attract sufficient interest from private investors. As part of the deal, Chairman Dan O&#x27;Connor agreed to quit the bank while managing director, Colm Doherty, announced he would leave before the end of the year after 13 months in the job.

In December 2010, the European Commission approved the plans, and the Government passed emergency legislation to allow the deal to take place without requiring the approval of existing shareholders. The High Court subsequently approved the deal on 24 Dec 2010, allowing the Irish government to take a 49.9% stake in the bank, rising to 92.8% following disposal of the Polish subsidiary to Banco Santander.

AIB became the fourth of Ireland&#x27;s &quot;Big Six&quot; financial institutions to be nationalised, following Anglo Irish Bank, Irish Nationwide Building Society, and EBS Building Society. AIB was delisted from the main market of the Irish Stock Exchange on 25 January 2011 and the NYSE on 26 August 2011.

===2011 AIB filed lawsuit===
AIB filed a lawsuit against Oracle Financial Services, India in January 2011, claiming breach of contract on Flexcube implementation. The case was settled later that year.

===Restructuring Credit Event===
The ISDA Determinations Committee, consisting of 15 US and European banks, decided that a Restructuring Credit Event occurred with respect to Allied Irish Banks on 9 June 2011.

In December 2020 AIB announced its intention to cut 1,500 jobs by 2023 noting that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 80% of its workforce had been working from home. Some branches will also be merged.

=== Re-privatisation ===
The former Minister for Finance Pascal Donohoe said that the government would be selling its 71% stake in the bank, with the sell-off beginning in January 2022.

In June 2024, it was announced that the government&#x27;s ownership had reduced to 25% as part of a recent share sale.

==Controversy==

===2002: John Rusnak losses===
John Rusnak, a currency trader at Allfirst, racked up losses of almost US$700 million during Michael Buckley&#x27;s tenure as group chief executive. It was Ireland&#x27;s biggest banking scandal and the fourth-biggest banking scandal in the world when it came to light on 4 February 2002.

===Tax evasion===
The €90 million settlement that AIB reached with the Revenue Commissioners in respect of Deposit Interest Retention Tax evasion in 2000 was the highest tax settlement in the history of Ireland. The bank&#x27;s internal auditor, Tony Spollen, highlighted a potential Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) liability of IR£100 million for the period 1986–1991, but Gerry Scanlon, the group chief executive at that time rubbished this estimate, describing it as &quot;infantile&quot;. The Oireachtas Sub-Committee Inquiry into DIRT hearing on 27 September 1999 concluded that it was &quot;extraordinary&quot; when Scanlon told the Inquiry that he was unaware of the scale of the DIRT issue.

The Revenue Commissioners on 28 March 2006 imposed a tax settlement plus penalties on four former senior executives for their interest, while employed by AIB, arising from investments they maintained in Faldor Limited. Faldor was an investment company set up in the British Virgin Islands that between 1989 and 1996 hold funds on behalf of these senior AIB executives as well as people connected to them. Allied Irish Banks Investment Managers then managed the funds in the company on their behalf; at the time Gerry Scanlan was CEO of the bank. Faldor subsequently benefited from inappropriate deal allocations, and artificial deals that amounted to €48,000 out of AIB Investment Managers&#x27; own funds.

Those cited include:

*Gerry Scanlon, chief executive AIB Group when this arrangement was in place, of Glenageary, County Dublin; tax and penalties amounted to €206,010.
*Diarmuid Moore, former director of corporate strategy at AIB, Malahide, County Dublin; tax and penalties amounted to €51,044.
*Roy Douglas, chairman, Irish Life &amp; Permanent Plc and formerly of AIB, Howth, County Dublin; tax and penalties amounting to €53,245.43 was secured.
*Patrick Dowling, former deputy chief executive, late of Delgany, County Wicklow; the estate paid tax and penalties of €13,000.

===Excess FX charging issues===
In 2004 it was revealed that the bank had been overcharging on foreign exchange transactions for up to ten years. The overcharging affected 3 million purchase transactions of foreign drafts. Initially the projected amount of overcharging was €14 million. However the bank set aside €50 million to cover the cost of refunds.

The Central Bank of Ireland published a report into an investigation of AIB Group concerning overcharging its own customers for FX transactions and deal allocation and other associated issues. This revealed excess charges of €34.2 million, including interest. AIB failed to comply with the law for a period of almost 8 years and that certain staff and management were fully aware of this at the time.

The Central Bank of Ireland had been aware that AIB was overcharging consumers in FX fees but did not act for a number of years. They gave a parliamentary inquiry the &quot;false impression&quot; that they were unaware of it. The whistleblower who gave the Central Bank the information was requested to come to a meeting with them but was only invited to withdraw the allegations of wrongdoing and at the same time found himself removed from his position at AIB without any reason given. After his case was highlighted in the media, the Central Bank officially apologised on how the authorities treated him, eight years after alerting them of overcharging.

AIB announced on 27 September 2006 that the final outlay in respect of restitution and interest arising from overcharging amounted to €65 million and that this included a donation of €20.6 million on behalf of its customers to an unspecified charity that it was unable to identify. No employee or officer of the banks was disciplined.

Apart from FX, the Central Bank of Ireland discovered in 2004, following an anonymous tip-off, that AIB overcharged customers €8.6 million. No regulatory action was taken.

===Deal allocation and associated issues===

Between 1989 and 1996, funds of certain senior executives of AIB at the time and/or related parties were managed by Allied Irish Investment Managers Limited (now AIBIM) through a British Virgin Islands investment company, Faldor Ltd.

Faldor benefited from inappropriate favorable deal allocations, by way of artificial deals, amounting to approximately IR£38,000 (€48,000) out of AIBIM&#x27;s own funds. Further inappropriate deal allocation practices relating to eight transactions in the period 1991 to 1993 were identified which adversely affected the performance of two specialist unit trusts, amounting to a total of £137,000 (€174,000), to the advantage of other clients. These were unrelated to Faldor. While the Internal Audit function of AIB did identify some inappropriate dealing practices in 1991 and 1993, there is no evidence that the Faldor account was identified in these audits. No disciplinary action was taken against individuals involved in these practices at the time and compensation was not paid to the unit trusts affected. When this episode of law breaking was exposed a disciplinary process was put in place within AIB and compensation has been paid to those who were disadvantaged. Tom Mulcahy, group chief executive of AIB from 1994 to June 2001, resigned the chairmanship of the board of Aer Lingus on 28 May 2004 following the disclosure of this matter.

===Charles Haughey and the Moriarty Tribunal===
In 2006, the Moriarty Tribunal published its report into the financial affairs of former Taoiseach Charles Haughey. Justice Moriarty found that AIB had settled a IR£1 million (€1.27 million) overdraft with Haughey on favourable terms for the politician shortly after he became Taoiseach in 1979; the tribunal found that the leniency shown by the bank in this case amounted to a benefit from the bank to Haughey. According to the report, the bank showed an extraordinary degree of deference to Haughey despite his financial excesses.

===Cashless branches===
On 19 July 2022, AIB announced that 70 of its 170 branches would become cashless due to &quot;declining demand for these services&quot; by October 2022. Under the plans, these branches would no longer provide cash or cheque services and ATMs would also be removed. The announcement was heavily criticised by GAA clubs, local councillors and AIB customers in rural areas. On 21 July, Government TDs sought an emergency meeting with Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe regarding the move. Taoiseach Micheál Martin said AIB should &quot;reconsider and reflect on&quot; its decision to remove cash facilities at 70 branches around the country.

The next day, on 22 July, the Minister for Social Protection, Rural and Community Development, Heather Humphreys called on AIB to halt the decision to go cashless at 70 branches, stating that rural communities across the country were &quot;rightly angry&quot; about the plan, accusing the bank of showing a &quot;complete disregard&quot; for rural communities. In the afternoon, AIB announced that it would not be proceeding with its plan to end cash services at 70 branches around the country following a backlash to the move from business groups, consumers, farming and rural organisations and politicians.

==Sponsorships==

During the late 1990s and early 2000s there were AIB Better Ireland Awards shown on RTE television.

AIB were one of the key sponsors of the 2006 Ryder Cup, which was held at The K Club in Straffan, County Kildare. In May of that year, the bank launched a €5 million advertising campaign for the tournament. AIB also sponsor an MSc course in Data Science at Technological University Dublin for a select few of their employees.

<doc id="840838" wikidata="Q2429723" url="?curid=840838" title="Thruston Ballard Morton">
<text>Thruston Ballard Morton (August 19, 1907 – August 14, 1982) was an American politician. A Republican, Morton represented Kentucky in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate.

== Early life ==
Morton was born on August 19, 1907, in Louisville, Kentucky, to Dave Morton and his wife, Mary Ballard, descended from pioneer settlers of the area. He had a brother, Rogers Clark Ballard Morton, who also became a politician, and a sister, Jane, who survived him. He attended local public schools and the Woodberry Forest School, before he entered Yale University. He received a B.A. there in 1929.

Morton then worked in the family business, Ballard &amp; Ballard Flour Milling, becoming its chairman of the board before the company was sold to the Pillsbury Company.

A lifelong Episcopalian, he married Belle Clay Lyons and was survived by their two sons, Clay Lyons Morton and Thruston Ballard Morton Jr., and five grandchildren.

His brother, Rogers Clark Ballard Morton, represented Maryland in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1963 through 1971. The Morton brothers served together in the U.S. Congress from 1963 to 1968, with Thruston as a U.S. Senator representing Kentucky and Rogers as a U.S. Representative representing Maryland. Both brothers also served as chair of the Republican National Committee.

Rogers Morton subsequently became U.S. Secretary of the Interior in the administration of Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, and then became U.S. Secretary of Commerce under Ford, before chairing Ford&#x27;s re-election campaign in 1976.

== Political career ==

=== U.S. House of Representatives ===
After naval service in World War II, Morton defeated the 12-year Democratic incumbent, Rep. Emmet O&#x27;Neal, in the 1946 election in his native Louisville area (Kentucky&#x27;s 3rd congressional district), 61,899 votes to 44,599 votes. Having been re-elected in 1948 and 1950, Morton served three terms in the House, from January 3, 1947, to January 3, 1953.

=== U.S. Assistant Secretary of State ===
Morton did not seek re-election in 1952. After leaving the House, Morton was appointed as U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Congressional Relations in the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, garnering legislators&#x27; support for Eisenhower&#x27;s foreign policy.

=== U.S. Senate ===
In 1956, Morton, by a very narrow margin, defeated the Democratic incumbent, Sen. Earle Clements from Kentucky, a former governor of Kentucky and then-minority whip in the U.S. Senate, by 506,903 votes to 499,922. Morton was re-elected to a second term in the U.S. Senate in 1962, defeating the Democratic lieutenant governor and former mayor of Louisville, Wilson W. Wyatt. Morton served from January 3, 1957, until his resignation, on December 16, 1968.

In the Senate, Morton was considered a moderate. He voted in favor of the Senate amendment to the Civil Rights Act of 1957 on August 7, 1957, but did not vote on the House amendment to the bill on August 29, 1957. Morton voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court. A compromise that Morton proposed to guarantee jury trials in all criminal contempt cases except for voting rights proved, with the assistance of Sens. Everett Dirksen from Illinois and Bourke Hickenlooper from Iowa, crucial in passing that Civil Rights Act.

Morton was the chair of the Republican National Committee from 1959 to 1961 and chaired the Republican National Convention of 1964.

When Morton retired, he surprised many, who considered him at the peak of his political power. However, he opposed the Vietnam War despite being criticized by Rep. William Cowger from Kentucky. Also, he was both depressed by the urban violence after the April 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and that of Robert F. Kennedy a few weeks later, and disappointed in his party&#x27;s failure to address the broader social issues. He also ultimately counseled then-President Lyndon Johnson to decline to seek re-election, and he supported the unsuccessful presidential candidacy of Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New York.

Morton is interviewed in the 1968 documentary film &quot;In the Year of the Pig&quot;, and another interview is available through the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library.

=== Consideration for 1960 Vice Presidential Nomination ===
Morton was among the last two candidates considered by Richard Nixon as a vice presidential running mate in 1960. As a midwesterner, however, he was considered to have a regional appeal where Nixon already figured to poll strongly and Nixon instead chose Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., of Massachusetts.

== Later life ==
After his retirement from the U.S. Senate, Morton served as vice chairman of Liberty National Bank in Louisville, president of the American Horse Council, and chairman of the board of Churchill Downs, and he served as one of the directors of the University of Louisville, Pillsbury Company, Pittston Company, Louisville Board of Trade, Texas Gas Company, R.J. Reynolds Company, and the Ohio Valley Assembly.

Morton died after many years of declining health. His brother Rogers Morton had died three years previously, and his wife, Belle, survived him by more than a decade. He was interred at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville.

<doc id="840846" wikidata="Q4679664" url="?curid=840846" title="Adam Rickitt">
<text>Adam Peter Rickitt (born 29 May 1978) is an English actor and singer. He portrayed the part of Nick Tilsley on the British soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot; from 1997 to 1999, and again from 2002 to 2004. He later joined the New Zealand soap &quot;Shortland Street&quot; for a three-year stint between 2007 and 2010. From 2017 to 2020, he appeared as Kyle Kelly on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;. His other credits include the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Doctors&quot; (2001; 2016; 2023).

Rickitt had a musical career, both as a solo artist and as a member of 5th Story, a supergroup formed for the ITV reality series &quot;The Big Reunion&quot;. Alone, he released &quot;Good Times&quot; (1999) through Polydor Records, an album that spawned the UK Top 25 singles &quot;I Breathe Again&quot;, &quot;Everything My Heart Desires&quot;, and &quot;The Best Thing&quot;. He attempted to embark on a political career within the Conservative Party in 2005, but has since denounced the party&#x27;s views.

==Early life==
Rickitt was born in Crewe, the youngest of four brothers who grew up in Cuddington, Eddisbury. His father was the co-owner of an estate agency. Rickitt was educated at Sedbergh School, a boarding school in Cumbria. Rickitt has spoken publicly about suffering from bulimia in his teenage years and about how male sufferers have largely been neglected.

==Career==
===1997–2004: &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and music career===
Prior to his acting career, Rickitt was briefly a child model. He subsequently modelled for magazines including &quot;Attitude&quot; and &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;. Rickitt auditioned for the ITV soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in 1997. He did it as a joke, having never watched an episode, and his agent said that he would not get it. However, he was cast in the role of Nick Tilsley and remained on the soap until 1999, returning briefly in 2002 and for a longer spell from 2003 to 2004. His most famous and controversial storyline was in 2003, when his character was involved in the series&#x27; first gay kiss with Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley).

Rickitt left &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in 1999 to start a music career. He signed a six-album deal with Polydor Records, although he only released one album - &quot;Good Times&quot; (1999). Rickitt&#x27;s first single, &quot;I Breathe Again&quot;, reached number five in the UK and was certified silver by BPI. The album peaked at number 41 on the UK Albums Chart. Rickitt was then dropped.

Rickitt starred as Mark Cohen in the 2001 UK tour of &quot;Rent&quot;, before moving to London&#x27;s West End. He made a return to the London stage to star in Bill Kenwright&#x27;s production of &quot;Office Games&quot;, followed by a new play, &quot;Final Judgement&quot;, and also appeared in Nick Moran&#x27;s play &quot;Telstar&quot; on UK tour in 2005.

===2005–2010: Political ventures and &quot;Shortland Street&quot;===
In October 2005, Rickitt was approved as a prospective parliamentary candidate for the Conservative Party. He was asked into politics as a way of getting young people engaged in voting and admitted that he had no real intentions of progressing far. In February 2006, he appeared on the political debate show &quot;Question Time&quot; as the non-partisan guest. In May 2006, he was one of 100 would-be MPs chosen for the Conservative party A-list. The following month, he appeared on &quot;Sunday AM&quot; with Andrew Marr. He attended national and local Conservative party functions in the hope of being selected as a candidate.

Alongside David Cameron, he also provoked the anger of Sir Nicholas Winterton when it was revealed that Rickitt was being tipped to stand for the safe Conservative seat of Macclesfield, which the outraged Winterton had represented for over thirty years. Winterton responded that he had no intention of standing down from this seat: &quot;I wish Adam luck, but there are no vacancies here.&quot; Rickitt was unsuccessful in progressing his political career. According to his website, in July 2007, he decided to continue his acting career in New Zealand rather than seek selection as a candidate.

In March 2006, he took part in the Channel 4 reality series &quot;The Games&quot;. He took part as a replacement, after the scheduled contestant, Goldie, had to pull out, following an accident. Rickitt himself sustained two black eyes after over-rotating off the diving board. In December 2006, Rickitt appeared in his first pantomime, &quot;Cinderella&quot;, in the role of Prince Charming at the Norwich Theatre Royal.

Rickitt joined the cast of the New Zealand soap opera &quot;Shortland Street&quot; in early 2007, portraying the role of Kieran Mitchell, with his first appearance being shown on 16 March 2007. Rickitt was given the opportunity to have creative freedom with the character since his storylines had not been fully formed. The character was written out of the series in 2010, with Rickitt&#x27;s final episode broadcast on 2 August 2010. His death episode saw high ratings for the soap. He had said that he preferred his role on &quot;Shortland Street&quot; to working on &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.

He returned to the political scene in October 2010 as a guest reporter for the ITV breakfast television programme &quot;Daybreak&quot; covering the Conservative Party Conference from Birmingham, and hosted a conference gay party. However, in 2014, Rickitt agreed with a comment that the world would be a better place without the conservative party.

===2014–present: &quot;Doctors&quot; and &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;===
In 2014, he became part of the supergroup 5th Story, who took part in the second series of &quot;The Big Reunion&quot;, alongside Kenzie from Blazin&#x27; Squad, Dane Bowers from Another Level, Kavana and Gareth Gates. Rickitt returned to the United Kingdom to continue his acting career, and in 2016, he made a guest appearance in an episode of the BBC medical soap opera &quot;Doctors&quot;.

He was then cast in the Channel 4 soap opera &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; as regular character Kyle Kelly. He left the soap in June 2020 when his character took his own life. In June 2023, it was announced that Rickitt would be returning to &quot;Doctors&quot;. His episode aired in December 2023, where he portrayed Michael Harvey.

==Personal life==
In 1999, at a performance at The Prince&#x27;s Trust Party in the Park, a member of the audience sprayed gas onto the stage when Rickitt was performing. Rickitt fainted after inhaling the substance and was taken to hospital. He has an autoimmune disorder called ankylosing spondylitis, which made Rickitt infertile, with a sperm count of two. The disease causes the spine&#x27;s vertebrae to fuse together if they remain still for too long, so Rickitt exercises for two hours daily.

Rickitt married &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; presenter Katy Fawcett in 2014. In 2019, the couple took over an artisan bottle shop called Dexter and Jones in the Cheshire town of Knutsford.

Rickitt worked for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals as a capital appeals manager. He left in 2013 to begin working with the cancer charity Help Harry Help Others, and Chief Executive of the mental health foundation, the Caerus Partnership.

===Legal issues===
On 21 September 2007, Rickitt was arrested and charged with shoplifting a block of cheese, a bottle of HP sauce and a jar of coffee beans from an Auckland supermarket. During an interview with &quot;Herald on Sunday&quot; he claimed that it was an honest mistake though later claimed that he was drunk at the time of the incident.

In August 2020, Rickitt drove 600 m whilst under the influence of alcohol to pick up a takeaway.

<text>Carl Gustaf Mosander (10 September 1797 – 15 October 1858) was a Swedish chemist. He discovered the rare earth elements lanthanum, erbium and terbium.

==Early life and education==
Born in Kalmar, Mosander attended school there until he moved to Stockholm with his mother in 1809. In Stockholm, he became an apprentice at the &quot;Ugglan&quot; pharmacy. He took his pharmacy examination in 1817, but had an interest in medicine and joined the Karolinska Institute in 1820. He passed his medical examination in 1825. He worked in the laboratory of Jöns Jakob Berzelius and became a close friend of fellow student Friedrich Wöhler. 

==Career==
In 1832 Jöns Jakob Berzelius retired in favor of Mosander, his student, who succeeded him as professor of chemistry and pharmacy in the Karolinska Institute. 
From 1845 Mosander was also a professor at and inspector for the Pharmaceutical Institute. Mosander was an assistant curator of the mineralogical collections of the Swedish Museum of Natural History, founded by the Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1819. From 1825 he was the owner of a spa in Stockholm where people could go to drink the waters.

Mosander discovered lanthanum in 1838. This came from the Cerite-(Ce) from Bastnaes, Sweden, which at the time was the only abundant source for &quot;Cerium&quot;, which had been discovered therein by Berzelius and Hisinger, and independently by Klaproth, in 1803. At that time, one of the two known components of the mineral ytterbite (later named gadolinite) was a white oxide called ceria. Mosander partially decomposed ceria by heating it and treating the resulting salt with dilute nitric acid.
He was hesitant to report his results, both for fear of embarrassing his mentor Berzelius, by showing that his discovery cerium was not an element; and because he was uncertain that he himself had reduced cerium to all of its components. Berzelius eventually suggested the name &quot;lanthan&quot;, for &quot;hidden&quot; for this new discovery.

By 1840, Mosander had separated cerium oxide into yellow cerium oxide, white lanthanum oxide and a pinkish third component which he called &quot;didymium&quot; meaning &quot;twin&quot;. Didymium was accepted as an element for many years, appearing in Dmitri Mendeleev&#x27;s periodic system as number 95, with the symbol Di. In 1874, Per Teodor Cleve predicted that didymium contained at least two elements. In 1879, Lecoq de Boisbaudran isolated samarium, while in 1885 Carl Auer von Welsbach separated the two remaining elements through repeated fractional crystallizations. Welsbach named them praseodidymium (green didymium) and neodidymium (new didymium). They came to be known as praseodymium and neodymium.

In 1843 Mosander discovered terbium and erbium as components of yttria.

However, this discovery was hotly contested. Spectroscopist Nils Johan Berlin denied that two elements existed, failing to confirm the existence of &quot;erbia&quot; and suggesting that its name be applied to &quot;terbia&quot;. 
In 1864, Marc Delafontaine used optical spectroscopy to conclusively prove that yttrium, terbium and erbium were separate elements. Ironically, however, the confusion that had been introduced between the names continued. Mosander&#x27;s proposed names were switched, giving the amethyst compound the name &quot;erbium&quot; oxide and the yellow substance the name &quot;terbium&quot; oxide, instead of the other way around as originally proposed.

Mosander was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1833.

==Personal life and final years==
Mosander married Hulda Philippina Forsström on 20 December 1832. They had four children, two sets of twins.

Mosander suffered from cataracts in later life. He died in 1858, at his summer house on the island of Lovön, Stockholm County.

<text>Georgije &quot;Đura&quot; Jakšić (; 27 July 1832 – 16 November 1878) was a Serbian poet, painter, writer, dramatist and bohemian.

==Biography==
Đura Jakšić was born as Georgije Jakšić in Srpska Crnja, Austrian Empire (present-day Serbia). His father was a Serbian Orthodox priest. Georgije&#x27;s early education took place in Timișoara and Szeged. He lived for a time in Zrenjanin, where he began studying painting under Konstantin Danil. He later studied fine arts in Vienna and Munich but the revolution of 1848 interrupted his education, which he never finished. He took active part in the 1848 Revolution and was wounded while fighting in Srbobran. After the revolution he moved to Belgrade, Principality of Serbia, where he served as a schoolteacher, a lector in a state-owned printing office, and in various other jobs, although he was often unemployed. As a political liberal, he was persecuted by authorities. Jakšić died in 1878, having had taken part in the uprising against the Turks in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Jakšić is one of the most expressive representatives of Serbian Romanticism. According to Serbian literary critic Jovan Skerlić, Jakšiċ was influenced mainly by Sándor Petőfi, the great Hungarian poet of the 1848 Revolution, and Lord Byron&#x27;s poetry depicting the Greek War of Independence.

==Literary works==
Đura Jakšić wrote about forty short stories and three full-length dramas in verse on historical themes:

*&quot;Stanoje Glavaš&quot; (1878)
*The Migration of the Serbs (&quot;Seoba Srbalja&quot;, 1864)
*Elizabeth the Montenegrin Queen (&quot;Jelisaveta kneginja crnogorska&quot;, 1868) and the novel &quot;Warriors&quot;.

He also wrote poems, several of which are considered among the best of 19th-century Serbian poetry: &quot;Na Liparu&quot; (On the Lipar Hill), &quot;Put u Gornjak&quot; (The Road to Gornjak) and &quot;Mila&quot;, which is dedicated to his first love Mila, who he intended to marry but never found courage to tell her. He also drew sketches of Mila, one of which later became his famous painting &quot;Devojka u Plavom&quot; (The Girl in Blue). Other notable poems are &quot;Otadžbina&quot; (Fatherland), &quot;Veče&quot; (Evening) and &quot;Ponoć&quot; (Midnight). Jakšić published &quot;Pripovetke&quot; (Short Stories), which was released posthumously in two volumes on two occasions, 1882–1883 and 1902 in Belgrade. Through them he expressed his pessimism and bitterness about the harsh blows life and people had dealt him. A popular motif in Jakšić&#x27;s work is the Battle of Kosovo, Kosovo myth, eagles and Serbian epic poetry.

==Artistic opus==
Jakšić painted around 200 paintings. The main influences on Jakšić were Rembrandt, Diego Velázquez and Peter Paul Rubens. Jakšić&#x27;s work varies in quality, ranging from masterpieces to half-professional paintings. According to Novak Radonić, the biggest problem with his painting is the improper use of anatomy. His most praised picture is &quot;The Lady in Blue&quot;, which was used for promotion during the reopening of the National Museum of Serbia.

The following paintings by Đura Jakšić are part of the collection of the National Museum in Belgrade:

* Autoprotrait
* Battle of Montenegris
* Kosovo
* Night Watch (&quot;Na straži&quot;)
* &quot;Ubistvo Karađorđa&quot; (The Assassination of Karađorđe Petrović)
* Strahinja Ban (Strahinja Banović)
* Knez Lazar Hrebeljanović (Lazar of Serbia)
* Girl in Blue (&quot;Devojka u plavom&quot;) 
* Portrait of director Ćirić
* Car Dušan (Stephen Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia)
* Knjaz Milan Obrenović IV
*Nevesta Baja Pivljanina (The bride of Bajo Pivljanin)

== Legacy==

Đura Jakšić is included in The 100 most prominent Serbs. His house in Srpska Crnja is currently used as a Memorial Museum and for poetry performances.

Jakšić was one of the leaders of Serbian Romanticism and one of the country&#x27;s greatest painters of that movement, together witk Novak Radonić. Although he wrote a number of loosely organized romantic plays, he is mostly known for his paintings and poetry. His poems include sonnets, lyrics, patriotic songs and full-scale epics. His favorite theme is nature and the patriotism.

The award for the best book of poetry in the Serbian language bears his name.

Jakšić was also a teacher and a professor; schools and colleges throughout Serbia bear his name. A number of anecdotes about Jakšić was published.

<doc id="840859" wikidata="Q978918" url="?curid=840859" title="Robert Mosbacher">
<text>Robert Adam Mosbacher Sr. (March 11, 1927 – January 24, 2010) was an American businessman, accomplished yacht racer, and a Republican politician. A longtime friend and political ally of George H. W. Bush, Mosbacher served in Bush&#x27;s Cabinet as Secretary of Commerce from 1989 to 1992.

==Early life==
Mosbacher was born in Mount Vernon, New York, to Gertrude (née Schwartz) and Emil Mosbacher. His grandparents were German Jewish immigrants. He had a sister, Barbara, and a brother, Emil Mosbacher Jr., a two-time America&#x27;s Cup-winning yachtsman and former Presidential Chief of Protocol. Mosbacher had a colorful childhood, growing up around characters like George Gershwin, a friend of his father. After graduation from The Choate School, he went to Texas as a wildcatter. He befriended future president George H. W. Bush in Texas.

==Sailing career==

Sailing as a member of the Knickerbocker Yacht Club, Mosbacher led the team that won the Scoville Cup and the Midget Yacht championship for under-15 racers in 1940 on Long Island Sound. He went on to win the Southern Ocean Racing Conference championship in 1958 and the Mallory Cup, also in 1958. Mosbacher later appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated, on May 18, 1959, with his brother Bus Mosbacher, for a feature article titled &quot;Kings of the Class-Boat Sailors&quot;.

Mosbacher won the silver medal in World Championships Dragon class in 1967 in Toronto. In 1969, he won the gold medal in World Championships Dragon class at Palma de Mallorca by one point. As of 2010, he was still only one of two Americans to have ever won the World Championships in the Dragon class.

He won the gold medal in World Championships Soling class in 1971 in Oyster Bay, NY, on a boat named &quot;Adlez&quot; built by Abbott with rigging from Melges. He lost to Buddy Melges in the 1972 Olympic Trials (Soling class) in San Francisco Bay. Buddy Melges went on to win the Gold Medal in the Soling Class at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Germany. Mosbacher won the bronze medal in World Championships 5.5 metre class in 1985 at Newport Beach. In 1988, he won the Scandinavian Gold Cup for 5.5 metre yachts.

He was described in Stuart H. Walker&#x27;s book &quot;Advanced Racing Tactics&quot; as a keenly competitive racer &quot;unwilling to settle for second&quot;.

Mosbacher participated in a semi-final match race against Ted Turner in the Mallory Cup in 1960. On the final windward leg, Mosbacher was slightly ahead. Ted Turner attempted to force Mosbacher into a mistake by executing a grueling tacking duel. The windward leg involved fifty-two tacks. In the end, Mosbacher won by five seconds.

==Political career==
Mosbacher was the finance chairman of Gerald Ford&#x27;s failed election bid in 1976. He also lost his own race for delegate to the 1976 Republican National Convention in Kansas City, Missouri, to a slate backing Ronald Reagan, Ford&#x27;s rival for the party nomination. Mosbacher, running in the then 7th congressional district, lost to State Senator Walter Mengden of Houston, 39,276 to 26,344 votes.

Earlier, Mosbacher in 1970 headed the fund-raising effort for George H. W. Bush in his losing Senate campaign against Lloyd M. Bentsen and again in Bush&#x27;s presidential campaigns in 1980 and 1988.

As U.S. Secretary of Commerce, he was the principal Cabinet official responsible for initiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). He was a strong proponent of the agreement, which created the largest unified market in the world. The agreement was not signed into law in the U.S. until December 8, 1993, during the administration of President Bill Clinton. The agreement went into effect on January 1, 1994. 

Mosbacher was a member of President Reagan&#x27;s Task Force on Private Sector Initiatives 1981–83 and vice chairman of the board of trustees of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. He then became Secretary of Commerce in 1989 after he directed the George H. W. Bush 1988 Presidential Election Campaign. He also served as a director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. In 2008, he was the general chairman of John McCain&#x27;s bid for the White House. 

==Business interests==
Mosbacher was a charter member and past chairman of the All American Wildcatters Association and served on the board of directors and executive committee of the American Petroleum Institute. He was a former director of Texas Commerce Bank and also of New York Life Insurance Company. Mosbacher was a former president of the American Association of Petroleum Landmen and a former chairman of the Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association. 

In 1989, Mosbacher received an honorary doctoral degree from the University of Houston. He was trustee emeritus of the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies and president of the board of Odyssey Academy, a public charter school located in Galveston, Texas.

==Mosbacher Institute==
The Mosbacher Institute for Trade, Economics, and Public Policy was founded in October 2009 upon the request of President George H.W. Bush to honor Mosbacher.

==Family and personal life==
Mosbacher&#x27;s brother was Emil &quot;Bus&quot; Mosbacher Jr., who successfully defended the America&#x27;s Cup as skipper of the &quot;Weatherly&quot; in 1962 and again in 1967 as skipper of the &quot;Intrepid&quot;.

Mosbacher was married four times:
* In 1946, he married Jane Pennybacker. Born Jewish, Mosbacher converted to Pennybacker&#x27;s Presbyterian religion. They had four children: Diane &quot;Dee&quot; Mosbacher, Robert Mosbacher Jr., Kathryn Mosbacher, and Lisa Mosbacher Mears. The marriage ended upon his wife&#x27;s death from leukemia in 1970.
* His marriage to Sandra Smith Gerry ended in divorce in 1982.
* In 1985, he married Georgette Paulsin, herself twice previously married. They divorced in 1998.
* His last marriage of 10 years to Michele &quot;Mica&quot; Mosbacher (Mica McCutchen Duncan) ended with his death.

Mosbacher&#x27;s eldest daughter Diane &quot;Dee&quot; Mosbacher is a psychiatrist and lesbian activist. In 1992, Robert Mosbacher Sr. was the first Republican Campaign Chair to meet with leaders from the National Lesbian Gay Task Force. His son, Robert Mosbacher Jr., is a businessman, public servant, and a former Republican politician.

===Death===
On January 24, 2010, Mosbacher died of pancreatic cancer at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center at the age of 82. He is buried at the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

<text>Isaac Ignaz Moscheles (; 23 May 179410 March 1870) was a Bohemian piano virtuoso and composer. He was based initially in London and later at Leipzig, where he joined his friend and sometime pupil Felix Mendelssohn as professor of piano in the Conservatory.

==Life==
===Early life and career===
Moscheles was born 1794 in Prague, Bohemia, the son of Klara Popper (Lieben) and Joachim Moises Moscheles. He was from an affluent German-speaking Jewish merchant family. His first name was originally Isaac. His father played the guitar and was keen for one of his children to become a musician. Initially his hopes fixed on Ignaz&#x27;s sister, but when she demurred, her piano lessons were transferred to her brother. Ignaz developed an early passion for the (then revolutionary) piano music of Beethoven, which the Mozartean Bedřich Diviš Weber, his teacher at the Prague Conservatory, attempted to curb, urging him to focus on Bach, Mozart and Muzio Clementi.

After his father&#x27;s early death, Moscheles settled in Vienna in 1808. His abilities were such that he was able to study in the city under Albrechtsberger for counterpoint and theory and Salieri for composition. At this time he changed his first name from &quot;Isaac&quot; to &quot;Ignaz&quot;. He was one of the leading virtuosi resident in Vienna during the 1814–1815 Congress of Vienna, and it was at this time that he wrote his enormously popular virtuosic &quot;Alexander Variations&quot;, Op. 32 for piano and orchestra, which he later played throughout Europe. Here, too, he became a close friend of Giacomo Meyerbeer, at that time still a piano virtuoso, not yet a composer; their extemporized piano-duets were highly acclaimed. Moscheles was also familiar with Hummel and Kalkbrenner. Among the virtuosi of the 1820s, Hummel, Kalkbrenner, Cramer, Herz and Weber were his most famous rivals.

While in Vienna, Moscheles was able to meet his idol Beethoven, who was so impressed with the young man&#x27;s abilities that he entrusted him with the preparation of the piano score of his opera &quot;Fidelio&quot;, commissioned by his publisher Artaria. At the end of his manuscript, before presenting it to Beethoven, Moscheles wrote the words &quot;Fine mit gottes Hülfe&quot; (&quot;Finished with God&#x27;s help&quot;). Beethoven approved Moscheles&#x27;s version, but appended the words &quot;O Mensch, hilf dir selber&quot; (&quot;O Man, help thyself!&quot;). Moscheles&#x27;s good relations with Beethoven were to prove important to both at the end of Beethoven&#x27;s life.

===Faith and family===

Moscheles was still a practising Jew in Vienna in 1814–15. His wife noted that he was a member of the congregation in Vienna, and that he wrote for the Vienna Jewish community an oratorio celebrating the peace. Throughout his life, like many other musicians of Jewish origin, he remained close to other musicians of similar descent such as Felix Mendelssohn, Anton Rubinstein, Joseph Joachim and Ferdinand Hiller. He also remained in contact with patrons of Jewish origin such as the Eskeles family in Vienna, the Leo family in Paris, and the Rothschilds in England. He married Charlotte Emden, daughter of a Hamburg Jewish banker and a cousin of Heinrich Heine, in a Hamburg synagogue in 1825. Nonetheless, after he settled in England, Moscheles became a member of the Church of England.

His children, two sons and three daughters, were all baptised at birth and he and his wife were baptised in 1832. They were parents to the painters Felix (1833–1917), their second son, and Serena Anna Moscheles (1830–1902), their second daughter and wife of Georg Rosen. Rosen was an orientalist like his brother of Friedrich August Rosen, another friend of Mendelssohn, like Moscheles. His granddaughter Jelka Rosen, also a painter, married the composer Frederick Delius. Another granddaughter, Marie-Thérèse, married Henry Fielding Dickens, the son of author Charles Dickens. Moscheles travelled extensively in Europe as a pianist and conductor, eventually settling in London (1825–1846) where his address was 3, Chester Place, near Regent&#x27;s Park. He became co-director of the Royal Philharmonic Society in 1832. He never disavowed his Jewish origins and frequently took his family to visit his relatives in Prague, all of whom had retained their Jewish allegiances.

Through his Dickens descendants, he is a great-grandfather of Admiral Gerald Charles Dickens and a great-great-great-great-grandfather of actor Harry Lloyd. Through his Roche descendants, he is great-great-grandfather to the musicologist Jerome Roche, and great-great-great-grandfather to historian Helen Roche and electronic musician Mike Paradinas.

===Mendelssohn and the London period===
After his Viennese period there followed for Moscheles a sensational series of European concert tours – it was after hearing Moscheles play at Carlsbad that the boy Robert Schumann was fired to become a piano virtuoso himself. But Moscheles found an especially warm welcome in London, where in 1822 he was awarded an honorary membership of the London Academy of Music (later to become the Royal Academy of Music). At the end of the year he wrote in his diary, &quot;I feel more and more at home in England&quot;, and he had no hesitation in settling there after his marriage. Moscheles visited most of the great capitals of Europe, making his first appearance in London in 1822, and there securing the friendship of Muzio Clementi and Johann Baptist Cramer. Moscheles was also a student of Muzio Clementi.

In March 1823, Moscheles paid a long visit to Bath in Somerset and started work on his Piano Concerto No. 4 (Op. 64). On an excursion to Bristol, Coleridge says that, &quot;Moscheles delights in the view of the Bristol Channel and adds, &quot;What can be finer than the first view of the Welsh mountains from Clifton? an enchanting panorama? The very place to write an adagio; the blue mountains form such a grand background to this bright channel.&quot; The piano concerto had its first performance, in London, shortly afterwards, on 16 June.

Before that, however, in 1824, he had accepted an invitation to visit Abraham Mendelssohn Bartholdy in Berlin to give some lessons to his children Felix and Fanny. His comments on meeting them were: &quot;This is a family the like of which I have never known. Felix, a boy of fifteen is a phenomenon. What are all prodigies compared with him? ... He is already a mature artist. His elder sister Fanny is also extraordinarily gifted.&quot; Shortly afterwards he wrote: &quot;This afternoon ... I gave Felix Mendelssohn his first lesson, without losing sight for a moment of the fact that I was sitting next to a master, not a pupil.&quot;

Thus began a relationship of extraordinary intensity which lasted throughout and beyond Mendelssohn&#x27;s life (he died in 1847). Moscheles was instrumental in bringing Felix to London for the first time in 1829 – Abraham entrusted Felix to his care for this visit. Moscheles had carefully prepared for it. In London, apart from becoming a regular and successful performer as well as a musical adviser for the soirées of the Rothschilds, he had become an invaluable aid for Sir George Smart and the Philharmonic Society, advising them of the talents of European musicians he encountered on his own concert-tours. When Smart himself toured Europe in 1825 looking for new music and musicians for the Society, Moscheles furnished Smart with a list of contacts and letters of introduction, including both Beethoven and Mendelssohn. In Prague, Moscheles&#x27;s brother acted as Smart&#x27;s guide. Smart visited the Mendelssohns in Berlin and was impressed with both Felix and Fanny. This eventually led to Mendelssohn&#x27;s invitation to conduct at the Society on his 1829 visit.

In 1827, Moscheles acted as intermediary between the Philharmonic Society and the dying Beethoven. He helped persuade the Society to send Beethoven desperately needed funds during the composer&#x27;s illness. In return, Beethoven offered to write for the Society his (uncompleted) Tenth Symphony.

Mendelssohn&#x27;s great success in England from 1829 until the end of his life also reflected well on his friend. Although Moscheles&#x27;s music was now being looked on as a little old-fashioned, he was heavily in demand as a music teacher and included amongst his pupils many children of the rich and aristocratic classes. He was also appointed &quot;Pianist to Prince Albert&quot;, a sinecure, which nevertheless confirmed his status. Child prodigy pianist Elizabeth Jonas, a student of Moscheles, played several command performances at Windsor Castle.

Moscheles never ceased to promote the music of Beethoven and gave many recitals of his music: in 1832 he conducted the London premiere of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Missa Solemnis&quot;, and he translated A.F. Schindler&#x27;s biography of Beethoven into English. He was an early exponent of the piano recital – the concert of music for piano alone, the innovation of which is disputed between Liszt and Moscheles. Moscheles gave the first fully public performance of Beethoven&#x27;s Hammerklavier Sonata in London on 14 March 1839, three years after Liszt had performed it for an invited audience in Paris.

Moscheles notably reintroduced the harpsichord as a solo recital instrument. He also often performed in concert with Mendelssohn in London (and elsewhere) – one great favourite of both musicians were Bach&#x27;s concerti for multiple keyboard instruments. On these occasions Mendelssohn and Moscheles were renowned for vying with each other in impromptu cadenzas. Performances of the three-harpsichord concerto were given, on one occasion with Thalberg at the third keyboard, on another with Clara Schumann. Moscheles often appeared as a conductor, especially of Beethoven.

===The Leipzig years===

Although throughout this period Moscheles continued to write music and travel on concert tours, he depended heavily on teaching for income, and this placed him under considerable stress. When therefore Mendelssohn established a Conservatory at Leipzig in 1843 he was keen to attract his friend Moscheles there as a colleague, promising him ample time in his schedules for concertising and music-making. After several years, Moscheles gladly accepted the position in 1846. He became a longstanding and prominent member of the Conservatory faculty, teaching piano there for several decades.

The Conservatory became in effect a shrine to Mendelssohn&#x27;s musical legacy. The critic and pianist Edward Dannreuther, who studied under Moscheles at Leipzig between 1859 and 1863, later wrote:

[...] it was whispered that the two old Grands in the pianoforte-room of the Conservatorium were wont to rehearse Mendelssohn&#x27;s D minor Concerto all alone by themselves, from 12.30 on Sunday night until cock-crow! Force of habit, probably.

It thus fell to Moscheles to lead the counter-attack on Wagner after the latter&#x27;s snide attack on Mendelssohn (and Meyerbeer) in his notorious article &quot;Das Judenthum in der Musik&quot; (&quot;Jewry in Music&quot;), which he did by requesting the resignation from the Conservatory&#x27;s board of Wagner&#x27;s editor, Brendel. Like Mendelssohn, Moscheles believed that music had reached its Golden Age during the period Bach to Beethoven, and was suspicious of (although not necessarily antagonistic towards) new directions such as those shown by Wagner, Liszt and Berlioz. Nevertheless, his personal relations with all of these (except perhaps Wagner) remained cordial. The Mendelssohn legacy in Britain meant that the Leipzig Conservatory had a high reputation amongst English musicians and amongst those who studied there during Moscheles&#x27;s time were Arthur Sullivan and Charles Villiers Stanford.

Moscheles died in Leipzig on 10 March 1870, nine days after attending his last rehearsal with the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra.

==Music==
Among his 142 opus numbers, Moscheles wrote a number of symphonic works. Apart from an overture, a ballet and a symphony, all are scored for piano and orchestra: eight piano concertos (of which the last is in fragmentary form only, no orchestral parts having survived) and sets of variations and fantasias on folk songs. The main theme of the finale of his fourth piano concerto is based on the tune &quot;The British Grenadiers&quot;. Moscheles also left several chamber works (including a piano trio that has been recorded), and a large number of works for piano solo, including sonatas and the études that continued to be studied by advanced students even as Moscheles&#x27;s music fell into eclipse. There are also some song settings.

More recently, with the modest but noticeable revival of interest in compositions by this composer and those of his colleagues, more of Moscheles&#x27;s works are being made accessible on compact disc, especially by small and independent record labels. All the completed piano concerti and fantasias for piano and orchestra are available on the Hyperion Records label, played by Howard Shelley, who also conducted the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra; they have also issued the complete piano studies, played by Piers Lane. Ian Hobson has also recorded the first six and included a pair of variations not recorded by Shelley.

==Sources==
Much of what is known about Moscheles&#x27;s life is derived from the biography, with selections from his diaries and correspondence, written after his death by his wife, Charlotte, and published in Germany in 1872; an English edition appeared the following year. The book also gives lively portraits of his era and of his musical contemporaries. The diaries themselves are lost. Another important source is the correspondence between Moscheles and Mendelssohn, preserved at the Brotherton Collection at the University of Leeds, and published in 1888 by Ignaz&#x27;s son (and Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s god-son), Felix Moscheles.

<text>Moschion, (), is a physician quoted by Soranus, Andromachus, and Asclepiades Pharmacion, who lived in or before the 1st century. He may be the same person who was called the &quot;Corrector&quot; (), because though he was one of the followers of Asclepiades of Bithynia, he ventured to controvert his opinions on some points.

A physician of the same name is mentioned also by Soranus, Plutarch, Alexander of Tralles, Aëtius Pliny, and Tertullian.

In Byzantine times, a Latin treatise on gynecology by an otherwise unknown Muscio was translated into Greek; this author came to be wrongly identified with Moschion.
