<doc id="826766" wikidata="Q12073118" url="?curid=826766" title="Women's Army Corps Service Medal">
<text>The Women&#x27;s Army Corps Service Medal was a military award of the United States Army which was created on July 29, 1943, by issued by President Franklin Roosevelt. The medal was intended to recognize the service of women to the Army during the Second World War. The profile featured on the medal is that of the goddess Pallas Athena; the same profile was used for the Women&#x27;s Army Corps branch insignia.

The Women&#x27;s Army Corps Service Medal was awarded to any service member of the Women&#x27;s Army Auxiliary Corps between July 10, 1942, and August 31, 1943, or the Women&#x27;s Army Corps between September 1, 1943, and September 2, 1945. The medal was issued as a once-awarded medal, and there are no devices authorized for additional presentations. The medal ranked in order of precedence below the American Defense Service Medal and above the American Campaign Medal.

The Women&#x27;s Army Corps Service Medal is considered obsolete as the United States Army is a combined service and no longer maintains any separate service corps for women, although it may still be worn by those who served.

<doc id="826770" wikidata="Q458945" url="?curid=826770" title="Paula Hawkins (politician)">
<text>Paula Hawkins (née Fickes; January 24, 1927 – December 4, 2009) was an American politician from Florida. She was the first woman to represent Florida in the U.S. Senate, and as of 2025 the only one to be elected to the Senate from Florida. She was the second woman ever elected to the Senate from the American South. She was the first woman in the country to be elected to a full Senate term without having a close family member who previously served in major public office.

==Early years==
Hawkins was the eldest of three children born to Paul and Leone Fickes in Salt Lake City, Utah. Her father was a Naval Chief Warrant Officer. In 1934, the family moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where her father taught at Georgia Tech. Her parents split when Paula was in high school, and Leone and the children returned to Utah. She finished high school at Richmond, Utah in 1944, then enrolled at Utah State University. Paula was hired to be the Athletic director&#x27;s secretary and met her future husband. On September 5, 1947, Paula Fickes and Walter Eugene Hawkins were married and moved to Atlanta. Gene earned a degree in electrical engineering and eventually opened his own business. The couple had three children before moving in 1955 to Winter Park, Florida, where Paula became a community activist and Republican volunteer.

==Politics==

She began her electoral career by campaigning as a consumer advocate. She became the first woman elected to statewide office in Florida by winning a seat on the Florida Public Service Commission in 1972. Hawkins was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate in 1974, which was won by Jack Eckerd. She was reelected to the Public Services Commission in 1976. In 1978, she was the Republican candidate for Lieutenant Governor on the ticket headed by Jack Eckerd. They lost to State Sen. Bob Graham and State Rep. Wayne Mixson. In 1980, she was elected to the United States Senate representing Florida, becoming Florida&#x27;s first woman elected to the United States Senate and the fifth from the South.

===U.S. Senate===
In 1980, she defeated former Congressman Bill Gunter to win election to the United States Senate; she was Florida&#x27;s first woman elected to the United States Senate and only the fifth from the South.

Outgoing Senator Richard Stone resigned three days before his term ended, and Bob Graham as Governor of Florida nominated Hawkins to fill the two-day vacancy, giving her seniority over the other freshmen senators. 
She was the first woman senator to bring her husband to Washington, D.C. As a result, the &quot;Senate Wives&#x27; Club&quot; became known as the &quot;Senate Spouses&#x27; Club&quot;.

Hawkins was particularly active in the realm of child welfare. She was a key figure in advocating and passing the 1982 Missing Children&#x27;s Act, and in 1983 chaired the Investigation and Oversight Subcommittee of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, where she launched an investigation of the increase of children reported missing. In 1984 she spoke at the Third National Conference on Sexual Victimization of Children, where she stunned listeners by disclosing that she herself had been the victim of sexual abuse as a child. She subsequently authored, &quot;Children at Risk, My Fight Against Child Abuse: A Personal Story and a Public Plea&quot;, which was published in 1986.

In 1984, she was co-chairwoman of the platform committee at the RNC.

Senator Hawkins, in 1985, participated in the Record Label Hearings of the Senate&#x27;s Commerce Committee, where the issue of labeling musical songs was examined, after the Parents Music Resource Center initiative. During the hearings, Hawkins had a notable altercation with testifying musician Frank Zappa, who eventually invited the senator to his home to see first-hand &quot;what kind of toys&quot; his children are playing with.

Hawkins was known during her tenure for saying and doing things many considered bizarre. She was most infamous during her first year in office for hosting a luncheon in an ornate Senate dining room of New York sirloin steak, tossed salad, baked potatoes, fresh asparagus, hot apple pie, and fresh strawberries and other citrus in which she railed against the &quot;truly greedy&quot; and proposed mandatory jail time for food stamp cheaters. Critics dubbed it the &quot;steak and jail&quot; luncheon (a pun on Steak and Ale).

Hawkins once again faced Bob Graham on a statewide ballot when she campaigned for re-election to the Senate in 1986. Graham defeated her by 55 percent to 45 percent, the largest margin of defeat for an incumbent Senator in 1986.

==Post-Washington activities==
Hawkins returned to Winter Park in early 1987. She was United States representative to the Organization of American States&#x27; Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD) for seven years before leaving active politics. She remained involved behind the scenes in central Florida and her endorsement was sought by many candidates. Hawkins was named a director of Philip Crosby Associates in 1988. She joined the board of Nu Skin Enterprises in 1997. She was a lifelong member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

==Health==
In a freak accident, a television studio partition toppled and struck her in early January 1982 during an interview at WESH-TV in Winter Park, Florida. While not life-threatening, the mishap aggravated a back injury she suffered years before in an automobile collision and caused constant pain which plagued her during her years in Washington. Senator Strom Thurmond, in his capacity as President pro tempore, gave her the use of a room in the Capitol building for a hospital bed where she found pain relief under weighted traction during breaks between congressional activities.

Hawkins&#x27; right side was paralyzed in 1998 as the result of a severe stroke. After this, she used a wheelchair. She stayed active, appearing on October 1, 2009, at the opening ceremony of the Waldorf Astoria Orlando at Walt Disney World.

=== Death ===
Hawkins died at the age of 82 on December 4, 2009, of complications from a fall she suffered the previous day.

**Bob Graham/Wayne Mixson (D), 56%
**Jack Eckerd/Paula Hawkins (R), 44%

<doc id="826777" wikidata="Q560157" url="?curid=826777" title="Kujula Kadphises">
<text>Kujula Kadphises (Kushan language: Κοζουλου Καδφιζου, also Κοζολα Καδαφες; Kharosthi: 𐨐𐨂𐨗𐨂𐨫 𐨐𐨯, IAST: &#x27;,&#x27;; ; r. 30–80 CE, or 40–90 CE according to Bopearachchi. 25–85 CE as per Benjamin.) was a Kushan prince who united the Yuezhi confederation in Bactria during the 1st century CE, and became the first Kushan emperor. According to the Rabatak inscription, he was the great grandfather of Kanishka I. He is considered the founder of the Kushan Empire.

==Names and titles==
The origins of Kujula Kadphises are quite obscure, and he is usually believed to be a descendant of the Kushan ruler Heraios, or possibly identical with him. However, Kujula shares his name (Kushan: Κοζουλου on some of his &quot;Hermaeus&quot; coins, or Κοζολα on his &quot;Augustus&quot; coins) with some of the last Indo-Scythian rulers, such as Liaka Kusulaka (Greek: &quot;Λιακα Κοζουλο&quot;), or his son Patika Kusulaka, which might suggest some family connection. Kujula Kadphises, referred to himself on his coins, inscribed in the Indian Kharosthi script, as &quot;Maharaja Rajarajasa Devaputra Kujula Kara Kadphises&quot;, which translates to &quot;Great King of Kings, Son of the Divine Being, Kujula Kadphises.&quot;

==History==
===Reign===
Kujula Kadphises&#x27; reign is estimated to have lasted from approximately 25 to 85 CE, though the chronology of the Kushan rulers remains uncertain. During his reign, Kujula was a contemporary of Roman emperors such as Claudius, Nero, Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian. Latin sources mention &quot;Indian&quot; ambassadors received by some of these emperors, though it is unclear whether these representatives were independent merchants from the Indian subcontinent or officials of the Kushan Empire. Numismatic evidence points to Roman influence on early Kushan coinage. One notable series of copper tetradrachms issued by Kujula features an obverse bust modeled after Augustus and a curule chair on the reverse.

===Chinese accounts===
In the process of their expansion eastward, Kujula Kadphises and his son Vima Takto (or Vema Tahktu) seem to have displaced the Indo-Parthian kingdom, established in northwestern India by the Parthian Gondophares since around 20 CE: His son, Yangaozhen [probably Vema Tahktu or, possibly, his brother Sadaṣkaṇa], became king in his place. He defeated Tianzhu [North-western India] and installed Generals to supervise and lead it. The Yuezhi then became extremely rich. All the kingdoms call [their king] the Guishuang [Kushan] king, but the Han call them by their original name, Da Yuezhi [Great Yuezhi]. The invasion of the Indo-Parthian kingdom led by Kujula Kadphises is thought to have occurred some time after 45 CE, during the reign of Gondophares&#x27;s successors: Abdagases and Sases.

===Genealogy according to the Rabatak inscription===
The connection of Kujula with other Kushan rulers is described in the Rabatak inscription, discovered in Rabatak in what was once Bactria in 1993, which was inscribed by Kanishka. Kanishka states Kujula Kadphises to be his great-grandfather, Vima Taktu to be his grandfather, Vima Kadphises to be his father, and himself Kanishka:

And he [Kanishka] gave orders to make images of the same, (namely) of these gods who are written herein, and he gave orders to make (them) for these kings: for King Kujula Kadphises (his) great grandfather, and for King Vima Taktu (his) grandfather, and for King Vima Kadphises (his) father, and for himself, King Kanishka.

===Khalchayan===
Some of the statues of the Khalchayan palatial site in Bactria, dated circa 50 CE, probably corresponded to the rule of Kujula Kadphises.

==Coinage==
The coinage of the Kushan ruler, Kujula Kadphises, shows us the enlargement of the religious horizon of the Kushans. His first issue, which has the debased portrait and name of Hermaeus on the obverse, shows Heracles on the reverse, still following the Greek tradition, even though Heracles may be the interpretatio Graeca of the Iranian god Verethragna. Contrary to earlier assumptions, which regarded Kujula Kadphises as Buddhist on the basis of the epithet of the &#x27;satyadharmasthita&#x27; epithet, it is now clear from the wording of a Mathura inscription, in which Huvishka bears the same epithet satyadharmasthita , that the kingdom was conferred upon him by Sarva (Shiva) and Scamdavira (Candavlra), that is, he was a devotee of the Hindu God, Shiva, and hence a firm Shaivite. It is striking to see that Kujula Kadphises has already adopted the worship of Siva and the use of Kharosthï script at such an early date.

<text>Claude Denson Pepper (September 8, 1900 – May 30, 1989) was an American politician of the Democratic Party. He represented Florida in the United States Senate from 1936 to 1951, and the Miami area in the United States House of Representatives from 1963 until his death in 1989. He was considered a spokesman for left-liberalism and the elderly.

Born in Chambers County, Alabama, Pepper established a legal practice in Perry, Florida, after graduating from Harvard Law School. After serving a single term in the Florida House of Representatives, Pepper won a 1936 special election to succeed Senator Duncan U. Fletcher. Pepper became one of the most prominent liberals in Congress, supporting legislation such as the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. After World War II, Pepper&#x27;s conciliatory views towards the Soviet Union and opposition to President Harry Truman&#x27;s 1948 re-nomination engendered opposition within the party. Pepper lost the 1950 Senate Democratic primary to Congressman George Smathers, and returned to private legal practice the following year.

In 1962, Pepper won election to a newly created district in the United States House of Representatives. He emerged as a staunch anti-Communist, and strongly criticized Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Pepper served as chairman of the House Committee on Aging, and pursued reforms to Social Security and Medicare. From 1983 to 1989, he served as chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee. He died in office in 1989, and was honored with a state funeral. In 2000, the United States Postal Service issued a 33¢ Distinguished Americans series postage stamp honoring Pepper.

==Early life==
Claude Denson Pepper was born on September 8, 1900, in Chambers County, Alabama, the son of farmers Lena Corine Talbot (1877–1961) and Joseph Wheeler Pepper (1873–1945). Pepper was the fourth child born to his parents; the first three died in infancy. Pepper was an only child until he was ten years old; his younger siblings were Joseph, Sara and Frank. He attended school in Dudleyville and Camp Hill, and graduated from Camp Hill High School in 1917. He then operated a hat cleaning and repair business, taught school in Dothan and worked in an Ensley steel mill before beginning studies at the University of Alabama.

While in college he joined the Army for World War I and served in the Student Army Training Corps (SATC, precursor to the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps). The war ended before he saw active service, and after the SATC was disbanded, Pepper joined the ROTC. While lifting ammunition crates during a training event, Pepper suffered a double hernia, which required surgery to correct. After graduating from the University of Alabama with his A.B. degree in 1921, Pepper was able to use his veterans&#x27; and disability benefits to attend Harvard Law School, and he received his LL.B. in 1924.

==Career==
Pepper taught law at the University of Arkansas (where his students included J. William Fulbright) and then moved to Perry, Florida, where he opened a law practice. Pepper was a member of the Florida Democratic Party&#x27;s executive committee from 1928 to 1929.

He was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 1928 and served from 1929 to 1931. During his term, Pepper served as chairman of the House&#x27;s Committee on Constitutional Amendments. In response to the Great Depression, Governor Doyle E. Carlton proposed austerity measures including layoffs of state employees and large tax cuts. Pepper was among those who opposed Carlton&#x27;s program, and popular support was with Carlton, so Pepper was among many legislators who lost when they ran for renomination in 1930.

After being defeated for renomination, Pepper moved his law practice to Tallahassee, the state capital. In 1931, he met Mildred Webster outside the governor&#x27;s office. They began dating, and they married in St. Petersburg on December 29, 1936. They remained married until her death in 1979, and had no children.

===Florida government===
Pepper served on the Florida Board of Public Welfare from 1931 to 1932, and was a member of the Florida Board of Bar Examiners in 1933.

===U.S. Senate===

In 1934, Pepper ran for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate, challenging incumbent Park Trammell. Pepper lost to Trammell in the primary runoff 51%–49%. But Pepper was unopposed in the 1936 special election following the death of Senator Duncan U. Fletcher, and succeeded William Luther Hill, who had been appointed pending the special election. In the Senate, Pepper became a leading New Dealer and close ally of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He was unusually articulate and intellectual, and, collaborating with labor unions, he was often the leader of the liberal-left forces in the Senate. His reelection in a heavily fought primary in 1938 solidified his reputation as the most prominent liberal in Congress. His campaign based on a wages-hours bill, which soon became the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. He sponsored the Lend-Lease Act. He joined other Southern senators to filibuster an anti-lynching bill in 1937, but broke with them to support anti-poll tax legislation in the 1940s, and the popular account of the Senate, Citadel said that Pepper had broken totally with the Southern Caucus. Pepper still supported some aspects of Southern white supremacy such as the all white Primary because he &quot;thought that a Senator from the South had to do that&quot;.

In 1943, a confidential analysis by Isaiah Berlin of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for the British Foreign Office described Pepper as: A loud-voiced and fiery New Deal politician. Before Pearl Harbor, he was a most ardent interventionist. He is equally Russophile and apt to be critical of British Imperial policy. He is an out and out internationalist and champion of labour and negro rights (Florida has no poll tax) and thus a passionate supporter of the Administration&#x27;s more internationalist policies. He is occasionally used by the President for the purpose of sending up trial balloons in matters of foreign policy. With all these qualities, he is, in his methods, a thoroughly opportunist politician. Because of the power of the Conservative Coalition, he usually lost on domestic policy. He was, however, more successful in promoting an international foreign policy based on friendship with the Soviet Union. In 1946, Pepper appeared frequently in the national press and began to eye the 1948 presidential race. He considered running with his close friend and fellow liberal, former Vice President Henry A. Wallace, with whom he was active in the Southern Conference for Human Welfare.

====&quot;Eisenhower Boom&quot;====
Pepper was re-elected in 1944.

By 1947, momentum was growing for the Draft Eisenhower movement. On September 10, 1947, US General Dwight D. Eisenhower disclaimed any association with the movement. In mid-September 1947, US Representative W. Sterling Cole of New York voiced opposition to the nomination of Eisenhower or any other military leader, including George C. Marshall and Douglas MacArthur. In December 1947, an actor impersonating Eisenhower sang &quot;Kiss Me Again&quot; during a political dinner in Washington, DC, whose attendees including President Truman (Democratic incumbent) and numerous Republican potential candidates: the song&#x27;s refrain ran &quot;but it&#x27;s too soon. Some time next June, ask me, ask me again, ask me, ask me again.&quot; On April 3, 1948, Americans for Democratic Action (ADA), led by members Adolf A. Berle Jr. and Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr., declared its decision to support a ticket of Eisenhower and Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas. On April 5, 1948, Eisenhower stated his position remained unchanged: he would not accept a nomination. In mid-April 1948, American labor unions had entered the debate, as William B. Green, president of the American Federation of Labor, criticized the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) for supporting the &quot;Eisenhower Boom&quot;.

On July 2, 1948, the White House sent George E. Allen, friend and adviser to both Truman and Eisenhower, to the general to persuade him to make yet another denial about his candidacy. On July 3, 1948, Democratic state organizations in Georgia and Virginia openly backed Eisenhower, as did former New York state court judge Jeremiah T. Mahoney. The same day, Progressive presumptive candidate Wallace scorned the Eisenhower boom&#x27;s southern supporters, saying, &quot;They have reason to believe that Ike is reactionary because of his testimony on the draft and UMT [Universal Military Training].&quot; On July 4, 1948, rumors abounded, e.g., Eisenhower would accept an &quot;honest draft&quot; or (from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;) Eisenhower would accept the nomination if made by Truman himself. On July 5, 1948, a &quot;New York Times&quot; survey completed the previous day revealed that support for Eisenhower as Democratic nominee for president was &quot;increasing among delegates&quot;, fueled by an &quot;Anti-Truman Group&quot; led by James Roosevelt of California, Jacob Arvey of Illinois, and William O&#x27;Dwyer of New York. US Senator John C. Stennis of Mississippi declared his support for Eisenhower. At 10:30 PM that night, Eisenhower issued an internal memo at Columbia for release by the university&#x27;s PR director that &quot;I will not, at this time, identify myself with any political party, and could not accept nomination for public office or participate in a partisan political contest.&quot; Support persisted nonetheless, and on July 6, 1948, a local Philadelphia group seized on Eisenhower&#x27;s phrases about &quot;political party&quot; and &quot;partisan political contest&quot; and declared their continued support for him. The same day, Truman supporters expressed their satisfaction with the Eisenhower memo and confidence in the nomination. By July 7, 1948, the week before the 1948 Democratic National Convention, the Draft Eisenhower movement drifted onwards, despite flat denials by Eisenhower and despite public declarations of confidence by Truman and Democratic Party national chairman J. Howard McGrath. Nevertheless, 5,000 admirers gathered in front of Eisenhower&#x27;s Columbia residence to ask him to run.

In 1948, Pepper supported not his friend Henry A. Wallace but Eisenhower. In fact, on July 7, 1948, Pepper went further than any other supporter with an extraordinary proposal: Senator Claude Pepper of Florida called on the Democratic party today to transform itself temporarily into a national movement, draft Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower as a &quot;national&quot; and hence &quot;nonpartisan&quot; Presidential candidate and promise him substantial control of the party&#x27;s national convention opening in Philadelphia next week. It would be necessary, Mr. Pepper suggested, for the convention to invite General Eisenhower to write his own platform and to pick the vice presidential nominee. Moreover, the Senator said, the general should be assured that the Democrats would never make partisan claims on him, and he should be presented not as a &quot;Democratic&quot; candidate but the candidate of a convention &quot;speaking not as Democrats but simply as Americans.&quot; Pepper managed to gain support from ADA. The Draft Ike movement gained support from the CIO, the Liberal Party of New York State, Democratic local leaders (Jacob Arvey of Chicago, Frank Hague of New Jersey, Mayor William O&#x27;Dwyer of New York City, and Mayor Hubert Humphrey of Minneapolis), as well as ADA leaders Leon Henderson and James Roosevelt II. Eisenhower made repeated statements that he would not accept the Democratic Party&#x27;s nomination well into July, just ahead of the 1948 Democratic National Convention. When Eisenhower, who accepted to become president of Columbia University in January 1948) made three statements refusing the nomination during July 1948, Pepper and others gave up and provided lukewarm support to Harry S. Truman. His third and last denial, sent by telegram to Pepper, ended the &quot;Eisenhower Boom&quot;, and delegates began to reconsider Truman. (Pepper also made a bid for presidential candidacy but withdrew it.) On the evening of July 9, 1948, Roosevelt conceded at &quot;Eisenhower-for-President headquarters&quot; that the general would not accept a nomination. During the convention (July 12–14, 1948) and after, concern persisted that the Eisenhower Boom had weakened Truman&#x27;s hopes in the November 1948 elections.

In 1950, Pepper lost his bid for a third full term in 1950 by a margin of over 60,000 votes. Ed Ball, a power in state politics who had broken with Pepper, financed his opponent, U.S. Representative George A. Smathers. A former supporter of Pepper, Smathers repeatedly attacked &quot;Red Pepper&quot; for having far-left sympathies, condemning both his support for universal health care and his alleged support for the Soviet Union. Pepper had traveled to the Soviet Union in 1945 and, after meeting Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, declared he was &quot;a man Americans could trust.&quot; Because of his left-of-center sympathies with people like Wallace and actor-activist Paul Robeson and because of his bright red hair, he became widely nicknamed &quot;Red Pepper&quot;.

At a speech made on November 11, 1946, before a pro-Soviet group known as Ambijan, which supported the creation of a Soviet Jewish republic in the far east of the USSR, Pepper told his listeners that &quot;Probably nowhere in the world are minorities given more freedom, recognition and respect than in the Soviet Union [and] nowhere in the world is there so little friction, between minority and majority groups, or among minorities.&quot; Democracy was &quot;growing&quot; in that country, he added, and he asserted that the Soviets were making such contributions to democracy &quot;that many who decry it might well imitate and emulate rather than despair.&quot;

Two years later, on November 21, 1948, speaking to the same group, he again lauded the Soviet Union, calling it a nation which has recognized the dignity of all people, a nation wherein discrimination against anybody on account of race is a crime, and which was in fundamental sympathy with the progress of mankind.

====Communist allegations====

Regarding the 1950 Florida Senate election, President Harry Truman called George Smathers into a meeting at the White House and reportedly said, &quot;I want you to do me a favor. I want you to beat that son-of-a-bitch Claude Pepper.&quot; Pepper had been part of an unsuccessful 1948 campaign to &quot;dump Truman&quot; as the Democratic presidential nominee. Smathers ran against him in the Democratic primary (which at the time in Florida was tantamount to election, the Republican Party still being in infancy there). The contest was extremely heated, and revolved around policy issues, especially charges that Pepper represented the far left and was too supportive of Stalin. Pepper&#x27;s opponents circulated widely a 49-page booklet titled &quot;The Red Record of Senator Claude Pepper&quot;. Pepper was defeated in the primary by Smathers.

===Law practice===

Pepper returned to law practice in Miami and Washington, failing in a comeback bid to regain a Senate seat in the 1958 Democratic primary in which he challenged his former colleague, Spessard Holland. However, Pepper did carry eleven counties, including populous Dade County where he later staged a remarkable comeback.

=== U.S. House ===

In 1962, Pepper was elected to the United States House of Representatives from a newly created liberal district around Miami and Miami Beach established due to population growth in the area, becoming one of very few former United States Senators in modern times (the only other examples being James Wolcott Wadsworth Jr. from New York, Hugh Mitchell from Washington, Alton Lennon from North Carolina, Garrett Withers from Kentucky, and Magnus Johnson from Minnesota) to be elected to the House after their Senate careers. (Matthew M. Neely from West Virginia and Charles A. Towne from New York via Minnesota were also elected to the House after their Senate careers, but they had been elected to the House before their Senate careers as well.)

Pepper remained a member of the House until his death in 1989, rising to chair of the powerful Rules Committee in 1983. Despite a reputation as a leftist in his youth, Pepper turned staunchly anti-communist in the last third of his life, opposing Cuban leader Fidel Castro and supporting aid to the Nicaraguan Contras. Pepper voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Pepper would be the only Representative from Florida who would vote in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

In the early 1970s, Pepper chaired the Joint House–Senate Committee on Crime; then, in 1977, he became chair of the new House Select Committee on Aging, which became his base as he emerged as the nation&#x27;s foremost spokesman for the elderly, especially regarding Social Security programs. He succeeded in strengthening Medicare. In 1980 the committee under Pepper&#x27;s leadership initiated what became a four-year investigation into health care scams that preyed on older people; the report, published in 1984 and commonly called &quot;The Pepper Report&quot;, was entitled &quot;Quackery, a $10 Billion Scandal&quot;.

In the 1980s, he worked with Alan Greenspan in a major reform of the Social Security system that maintained its solvency by slowly raising the retirement age, thus cutting benefits for workers retiring in their mid-60s, and in 1986 he obtained the passage of a federal law that abolished most mandatory retirement ages. In his later years, Pepper, who customarily began each day by eating a bowl of tomato soup with crackers, sported a replaced hip and hearing aids in both ears, but continued to remain an important and often lionized figure in the House.

In 1988, Pepper sponsored a legislation to create the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Enacted during his final term, the NCBI has revolutionized the exchange, sharing and analysis of genetic information and aided researchers worldwide to achieve advances in medical, computational and biological sciences.

Pepper became known as the &quot;grand old man of Florida politics&quot;. He was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 1938 and 1983. During this time, Republicans often joked that he and House Speaker Tip O&#x27;Neill were the only Democrats who really drove President Ronald Reagan crazy.

==Personal life and death==
On May 26, 1989, Pepper was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George H. W. Bush. Four days later, Pepper died in his sleep from stomach cancer. His body lay in state for two days in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol; he was the 26th American so honored and was the last person to lie in state in the Capitol rotunda with an open casket. Pepper was buried at Oakland Cemetery in Tallahassee. A special election was held in August 1989 to fill his seat, won by Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who served until retiring at the conclusion of the 115th Congress.

==Legacy==

A number of places in Florida are named for Pepper, including the Claude Pepper Center at Florida State University (housing a think tank devoted to intercultural dialogue in conjunction with the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations and an institute on aging) and the Claude Pepper Federal Building in Miami, as well as several public schools. Large sections of U.S. Route 27 in Florida are named Claude Pepper Memorial Highway. Since 2002, the Democratic Executive Committee (DEC) of Lake County has held an annual &quot;Claude Pepper Dinner&quot; to honor Pepper&#x27;s tireless support for senior citizens. The Claude Pepper Building (building number 31) at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland is also named for him.

Pepper&#x27;s wife Mildred was well known and respected for her humanitarian work and was honored with a number of places in Florida named in her honor. A year after his passing, Claude Pepper was honored in a play written by Shepard Nevel and directed by Phillip Church. &quot;Pepper&quot; premiered in June 1990 to a full house at the Colony Theater in Miami Beach. In 1993, Bradenton, Florida actor Kelly Reynolds portrayed Pepper in several performances held at area schools, libraries and nursing homes.

==Awards==
In 1982, Pepper received the Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged, an annual presentation of the Jefferson Awards.

In 1983, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In 1985, the Roosevelt Institute awarded Pepper its Four Freedoms medal.

Also in 1985, Pepper was awarded a Doctor of Humane Letters from Florida State University for his public service.

Pepper would be posthumously inducted into the Florida Civil Rights Hall of Fame on February 29, 2012, in a ceremony held by Florida Governor Rick Scott in the Florida State Capitol. He was one of the first three along with Mary McLeod Bethune and Charles Kenzie Steele Sr to be inducted into it.

AIMIM has held the Lok Sabha seats for the Hyderabad constituency since 1984. In the 2014 Telangana Legislative Assembly elections, the party won seven seats and received recognition as a &quot;state party&quot; by the Election Commission of India.

For much of its existence, it had little presence beyond old Hyderabad. However, in more recent years, it has begun expanding into other states. It now has a significant presence in Maharashtra, with Imtiyaz Jaleel winning the Aurangabad Lok Sabha constituency in 2019 and with multiple members elected to the Legislative Assembly. It has also made inroads in Bihar, winning five Legislative Assembly seats in 2020.

==Origins==
AIMIM was originally founded as Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) in 1927 by Nawab Mahmood Nawaz Khan Qiledar of Hyderabad State in the presence of Ulma-e-Mashaeqeen as a pro-partition party. The first meeting was held in the house of Nawaz Khan on 12 November 1927In 1938, Bahadur Yar Jung was elected president of the MIM. At that time it had only a cultural and religious manifesto. It soon acquired a political complexion. After the death of Bahadur Yar Jang in 1944, Qasim Rizvi was elected as its leader. Indian government, after police action (named operation polo), merged Hyderabad state with India and arrested Razakars including its leader Qasim Rizvi. He was released from jail in 1957 with condition that he will go to Pakistan. 
In 1958, before he left for Pakistan, Razvi nominated Abdul Wahid Owaisi as his successor. Abdul Wahed Owaisi, a lawyer organised the party into the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen. Under his leadership, the AIMIM shifted from a hardline policy of independence to a pragmatic direction. After Abdul Wahed Owaisi, his son Sultan Salahuddin Owaisi took control of AIMIM in 1975 and was referred to as &quot;Salar E Millat&quot; (commander of the community). AIMIM President, Asaduddin Owaisi, his son claims that AIMIM is not the descendant of Razakars.

<text>The Rainbow Sash Movement is an organisation of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender Catholics, with their families and friends, who are publicly calling the Catholic Church to a &quot;conversion of heart around issues of human sexuality&quot;.

== History in Australia ==
The Movement was established in 1998 in Melbourne, Australia in response to the refusal of London&#x27;s Cardinal Basil Hume, and Melbourne&#x27;s Archbishop George Pell and New York&#x27;s Cardinal John O&#x27;Connor, to provide communion to two openly gay Catholic men, one a priest, in 1997.

On Pentecost Sunday 31 May 1998 a group of 70 people attended Mass in St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Melbourne, wearing a Rainbow Sash.

The movement acted again on Pentecost Sunday in 2002.

== History in the United States ==
The Rainbow Sash Movement was taken up in US in 2000, with Melbourne-based Michael B. Kelly as the group&#x27;s international spokesperson. The movement is largely based out of Chicago, Illinois.

The movement acted on Pentecost Sunday in 2001- 2007, and 2010. In 2012 the movement criticized the Knights of Columbus for supporting and funding homophobic messaging and campaigns. The organization also acted in October 2010 in Collegeville, Minnesota, and in October 2013 in Springfield, Illinois.

As of 2023, the movement is still ongoing.

== History in England ==
English Catholics have also taken part in the movement since the late 1997. The movement was ongoing as of 2010.

== Activity ==
The Rainbow Sash itself is a strip of a rainbow-colored fabric which is worn over the left shoulder and is put on at the beginning of the Liturgy. The members go up to receive Eucharist. If denied, they go back to pews and remain standing, but if the Eucharist is received then they go back to the pew and kneel in the traditional way.

Pentecost Sunday was chosen because the day is &quot;a celebration of God&#x27;s gifts&quot;, including the gift of sexuality. The sash is meant to serve as an act of celebration rather than an act of protest.

<text>Radio 538 () is a Dutch commercial radio station established in Hilversum, Netherlands, in 1992. It is the second-most listened to radio station in the Netherlands. The name “Radio 538” refers to the wavelength on which Radio Veronica broadcast in the 1970s. The station is owned by Talpa Network. 

Radio 538 plays a variety of music from the 1980s to the present, including dance, R&amp;B, pop, and rock. The music selection is primarily based on the Dutch Top 40 chart. During morning and drive times, the station features more talk-intensive programming.

==History==

Radio 538 was established in 1992 as the successor to Sky Hitradio, a sister station of Sky Radio that operated from July to December 11, 1992. It was initiated by a group of former Radio Veronica employees, led by Lex Harding. The station began broadcasting on December 11, 1992, from a villa in Bussum. The name “Radio 538” refers to the wavelength (538m: 557 kHz) on which Radio Veronica broadcast in the 1970s. The first presenters included Rick van Velthuysen, Wessel van Diepen, Erik de Zwart, Michael Pilarczyk, Will Luikinga, and Corné Klijn.

Radio 538 initially broadcast from Studio Concordia in Bussum, which was also used by the Veronica program &quot;Countdown&quot; in the 1980s and 1990s. In the late 1990s, the station moved to a studio complex near the town hall in Hilversum. Since December 1, 2012, the entire 538 Group has been located in the 4400 m² NCRV building at Bergweg 70 in Hilversum.

Initially, from its start in 1992 until 1995, Radio 538 was only available via cable. A request to be allowed to broadcast over the air was rejected at that time. Following a media campaign during which 320,000 signatures were collected Radio 538 acquired its over-the-air frequency in 1995 – or more precisely, a collection of several regional frequencies. In 2003, Radio 538 was granted a new nationwide frequency, 102 MHz (FM). 538 had to pay €57 million for the new frequencies.

In 1995, Lex Harding started TMF (The Music Factory), a TV station, and Erik de Zwart became the new chairman of 538. At the end of 2002, Erik de Zwart left to go to competitor Noordzee FM. Jan-Willem Brüggenwirth became the new chairman. In December 2003 Radio 538 was sold to Advent International, Lex Harding retaining 10% of the shares. In May 2005 Radio 538 was sold in its entirety to Talpa Holding, owned by Dutch media mogul John de Mol. In June 2007 De Mol sold the TV and radio assets of Talpa to RTL Nederland and became shareholder of RTL Nederland.

Radio 538 managed in 10 years to win a substantial market share. In April/May 2004, the station nudged market leader Sky Radio to the throne. Nowadays 538 still competes with NPO Radio 2 and NPO 3FM as the most listened radio station in the Netherlands. The marketing share is between 10 and 12 percent. In 2002, 2004 and 2009 Radio 538 won the Marconi Award for best radio station.

In Flanders, a Flemish version of Radio 538 launched on cable in February 1999, pending the airwave frequency allocation for national commercial radio, which in the late nineties was announced by the Flemish government in 2000. When in 2000 was no clear procedure for a given frequency, Radio 538 withdrew from Flanders.

In 2011 Talpa worked together with Finnish media conglomerate Sanoma to buy the Dutch activities of SBS Broadcasting from German broadcaster ProSiebenSat.1 Media. As part of that deal De Mol sold his shares in RTL Nederland to the RTL Group, retaining the ownership of Radio 538 and its sister station SLAM!FM. In 2014 Radio 538 started with some new programs. De Avondploeg, De Show Zonder Naam and Jurk!FM.

In 2018, the station announced that it would stop carrying the flagship Dutch Top 40 chart. Prior to this, it has been discontinued on FM signal for quite some time. The replacement will be named 538TOP50, and it is compiled based on the selection from 150,000 538Members, airplay on Spotify, YouTube and all the Dutch music stations, alongside Talpa&#x27;s app JUKE. Dutch Top 40 is now on Qmusic.

==Format==
In the beginning, the station focused mainly on youth with slogans like, &quot;The station of a young generation&quot;. With the advent of disc jockeys such as Edwin Evers, the target group expanded, and the station became wider. A new Alarmschijf and Dancesmash still ran weekly. The listener can also help decide which music is played in the program Maak &#x27;t or kraak &#x27;t and in past the Top 538. Jingles for the station is recorded by Wessel van Diepen, Rick Romijn and Kimberly van de Berkt.

Nowadays, the station makes commercial hit radio for young people in the broadest sense of the word. The format consists of Top 40 music, dance, Contemporary R&amp;B and &quot;throwbacks&quot;, supplemented with information and entertainment by DJs. The morning shows (4am-12pm) feature a mix of current and classic hits. The afternoon and nighttime shows focus more on current hits.

==Frequencies==
From the launch in 1992 and until 1994, Radio 538 was distributed via cable. In 1994 the station submitted a request for an FM license, however larger stations (such as Radio 538 and SkyRadio) were not granted any FM licenses at that time in favor of smaller, local radio stations. Subsequently, Radio 538 started a media campaign, where a total of 320,000 signatures were collected and in 1995 Radio 538 received license to broadcast on FM on the frequency (103.0 MHz, from Lelystad). On 1 January 1998 the station moved to another frequency package, with different frequencies in different regions.

At the air distribution in 2003 (called Zerobase) Radio 538 received a new nationwide FM network. Radio 538 has since been received in large parts of the Netherlands over the air on the FM band via the following frequencies: 102.1/102.3 MHz North Holland, Groningen 102.2 MHz, 102.3 MHz North Brabant, Gelderland, Limburg, 102.4 MHz Zeeland and North Brabant, Friesland and Utrecht 102.5 MHz, 102.6 MHz Over Ijssel and Gelderland, 102.7 MHz South Holland and Drenthe. Radio 538 promotes its frequencies as &quot;102 FM&quot;. Due to the lack of available FM frequencies in the south Limburg region, it was also rebroadcast on 891 kHz mediumwave from a transmitter in Hulsberg.

Radio 538 can also be received via Digitenne and the whole of Europe via satellite and worldwide via the Internet. Previously it was available on mobile phones via UMTS (on the portals of KPN i-mode and Vodafone Live) and in Limburg on AM 891 kHz, 336 m.

Radio 538 also transmits a TMC signal from traffic for route navigation.

From 30 August until 23 November 2011 Radio 538 was broadcast on 106.0 MHz from the tower of Ping FM in the Belgian Lanaken, for the region of Limburg-Maastricht from 12 midnight until 7 pm. Ping FM was eventually ordered by the Vlaamse Regulator voor de Media (Flemish Regulator for the Media) to stop the retransmission of programs of Radio 538. In mid-September 2014 the programs of 538 can be heard via Ping FM. During the day on weekdays, on Thursday, till Sunday also few hours in the evening and on Saturday and Sunday mornings.

In August 2016, it was reported that Radio 538 would cease to broadcast via mediumwave 891 kHz within one month, as it is now well-received via cable, DAB+ and the internet in the south Limburg region. From 26 October 2016 this transmitting is indeed ceased.

* Roelof Hemmen
* Jo van Egmond

At other times the news is read by newscasters associated with the ANP.

==Spinoffs==
In 1999, Radio 538 started the hip-hop and contemporary R&amp;B program &quot;Juize&quot;, which developed into the radio station Juize.FM on 18 July 2004. Since 1 July 2005, Juize FM is broadcast in most of the Netherlands by cable and has also started running shows with presenters. 

In 2011, Radio 538 created a sister television station called TV 538.

Erik de Zwart became the new director of Radio 538. In late 2002 Erik de Zwart moved to Talpa Radio International.

In December 2003, Radio 538 was sold to the investment fund Advent International. Lex Harding retained 10% of the shares.

On 23 May 2005 Radio 538 was fully acquired by Talpa by John de Mol and Lex Harding took definitely goodbye. Together with Radio 10 Gold, which already owned by Talpa, Radio 538 was brought under the management of Talpa Radio (since 2006: Talpa Media). Until that moment, Talpa, next to Radio 10 Gold, also owned Noordzee FM. Because it was not allowed under the provisions of the 2003 frequency to two general, possess national commercial radio broadcasters, Talpa was forced to sell Noordzee FM. The Flemish company De Persgroep took Noordzee FM and renamed the station few months later to Q-music. De Persgroep does not have to pay anything for Noordzee FM to Talpa.

RTL Group owned back all shares in RTL Nederland Holding since 1 January 2015, while Talpa became again the 100% owner of Radio 538. All this is a result of participation by Talpa Holding in SBS Broadcasting.

<text>Lothrop Withington (January 31, 1856 – May 7, 1915) was a well-known American genealogist, historian, and book editor who was killed in the sinking of the RMS Lusitania.

Born in Newburyport, Massachusetts to Nathan Noyes Withington (1828–1914) and Elizabeth (Little) Withington (1828–1912), he was involved with research and editing of publications on certain aspects of the American Revolutionary War but best known was his extensive genealogical research that included the publication of immigrant ships&#x27; passenger lists and the like.

On October 14, 1892, in London, he married Caroline Augusta Lloyd, a sister of Henry Demarest Lloyd. They had no children.

In May 1915, he was returning to his work in the United Kingdom but lost his life on board the when it was attacked and sunk by German U-boat .

He had no children at the time of his death. His grandnephew (a brother&#x27;s grandson) was Lothrop Withington Jr., the progenitor of goldfish swallowing.

<doc id="826809" wikidata="Q1573668" url="?curid=826809" title="Pure tone">
<text>In psychoacoustics, a pure tone is a sound with a sinusoidal waveform; that is, a sine wave of constant frequency, phase-shift, and amplitude.
By extension, in signal processing a single-frequency tone or pure tone is a purely sinusoidal signal (e.g., a voltage).
A pure tone has the property – unique among real-valued wave shapes – that its wave shape is unchanged by linear time-invariant systems; that is, only the phase and amplitude change between such a system&#x27;s pure-tone input and its output.

Sine and cosine waves can be used as basic building blocks of more complex waves. As additional sine waves having different frequencies are combined, the waveform transforms from a sinusoidal shape into a more complex shape.
When considered as part of a whole spectrum, a pure tone may also be called a &quot;spectral component&quot;.

In clinical audiology, pure tones are used for pure-tone audiometry to characterize hearing thresholds at different frequencies.
Sound localization is often more difficult with pure tones than with other sounds.

== Relation to pitch and musical tones ==

Pure tones have been used by 19th century physicists like Georg Ohm and Hermann von Helmholtz to support theories asserting that the ear functions in a way equivalent to a Fourier frequency analysis. In Ohm&#x27;s acoustic law, later further elaborated by Helmholtz, musical tones are perceived as a set of pure tones. The percept of pitch depends on the frequency of the most prominent tone, and the phases of the individual components is discarded. This theory has often been blamed for creating a confusion between pitch, frequency and pure tones.

Unlike musical tones that are composed of the sum of a number of harmonically related sinusoidal components, pure tones only contain one such sinusoidal waveform. When presented in isolation, and when its frequency pertains to a certain range, pure tones give rise to a single pitch percept, which can be characterized by its frequency. In this situation, the instantaneous phase of the pure tone varies linearly with time. If a pure tone gives rise to a constant, steady-state percept, then it can be concluded that its phase does not influence this percept. However, when multiple pure tones are presented at once, like in musical tones, their relative phase plays a role in the resulting percept. In such a situation, the perceived pitch is not determined by the frequency of any individual component, but by the frequency relationship between these components (see missing fundamental).

<doc id="826812" wikidata="Q239501" url="?curid=826812" title="Fay Weldon">
<text>Fay Weldon (born Franklin Birkinshaw; 22 September 1931 – 4 January 2023) was an English author, essayist and playwright.

Over the course of her 55-year writing career, she published 31 novels, including &quot;Puffball&quot; (1980), &quot;The Cloning of Joanna May&quot; (1989), &quot;Wicked Women&quot; (1995)&quot; and The Bulgari Connection&quot; (2000), but was most well-known as the writer of &quot;The Life and Loves of a She-Devil&quot; (1983) which was televised by the BBC in 1986.

Married three times and with four children, Weldon was a feminist. Her work features what she described as &quot;overweight, plain women&quot;. She said there were many reasons why she became a feminist, including the &quot;appalling&quot; lack of equal opportunities and the myth that women were supported by male relatives.

==Early life==
Weldon was born Franklin Birkinshaw to a literary family in Birmingham, England, on 22 September 1931. Her maternal grandfather, Edgar Jepson (1863–1938), her uncle Selwyn Jepson and her mother Margaret Jepson wrote novels (the latter sometimes under the nom de plume Pearl Bellairs, from the name of a character in Aldous Huxley&#x27;s short story &quot;Farcical History of Richard Greenow&quot;).

Weldon grew up in Christchurch, New Zealand, where her father, Frank Thornton Birkinshaw, worked as a doctor. In 1936, when she was five, her parents agreed to separate, later divorcing (1940). She and her sister Jane spent the summers with her father, first in Coromandel, later in Auckland. She attended Christchurch Girls&#x27; High School for two years from 1944. Weldon described herself as a &quot;plump, cheerful child&quot;, stating in a blog post that began as an unpublished article for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;: &quot;I was born large, blonde and big-boned into a family of small beautiful women. My mother thought it was unlikely that anyone would marry me, and therefore I would have to pass exams, earn my own living and make my own way in the world. Or that’s what I thought she thought.&quot; She goes on to explain how this view of herself affected her later writing career. &quot;I’d be happier to have been seen as a skinny, feisty child, a slim and serious adult, and a handsome octogenarian with an interesting literary past. But that was not to be, despite a lifetime of diets. It was however a state of affairs which made me write a good few novels with overweight, plain women as their heroines. I’ve always been on their side – they are the unseen majority.&quot;

In September 1946, when she was 15, Weldon returned to England with her mother and sister. She recalled: &quot;I was a literary groupie from the antipodes...Not that I had any intention of being a writer at the time – too much like hard work. All I wanted was to get married and have babies.&quot; She did not see her father again before his death in 1949.

In England Weldon won a scholarship to the all-girls South Hampstead High School, before going on to study Psychology and Economics at the University of St Andrews, Scotland. Later she recalled attending classes with the moral philosopher Malcolm Knox, who &quot;spoke exclusively to the male students, maintaining that women were incapable of moral judgement or objectivity.&quot; She completed her Master of Arts in 1952 and moved to London, where she worked as a clerk at the Foreign Office for a salary of £6 a week.

==Early career==
Weldon had temporary jobs as a waitress and hospital ward orderly before working as a clerk for the Foreign Office, where she wrote pamphlets to be dropped in Eastern Europe as part of the Cold War. She had to leave this job after she became pregnant. Later she took a job with Crawford&#x27;s Advertising Agency, where she worked with the writer Elizabeth Smart, and where she could earn enough to support herself and her young son (Nicolas).

As head of copywriting at Ogilvy, Benson &amp; Mather, she was responsible for publicising (but not originating) the phrase &quot;Go to work on an egg&quot;. She coined the slogan &quot;Vodka gets you drunker quicker&quot;, saying in a &quot;Guardian&quot; interview: &quot;It just seemed ... to be obvious that people who wanted to get drunk fast needed to know this.&quot; Her bosses disagreed and suppressed it.

==Literary career==

===Writing career===

In 1963 Weldon began writing for radio and television. Four years later her first novel, &quot;The Fat Woman&#x27;s Joke&quot;, was published. &quot;When I submitted my first novel in 1966 it was accepted without demur. I thought this was because I was a wonderful writer, But it wasn&#x27;t. It was because I had learned to have nothing turned down.&quot; She subsequently built a successful and prolific career, publishing over thirty novels, collections of short stories, films for television, newspaper and magazine articles and becoming a well-known face and voice on the BBC. She described herself as a &quot;writeaholic&quot;.

In 1971 Weldon wrote the first episode of the landmark television series &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;, for which she won a Writers Guild award for Best British TV Series Script. In 1980 Weldon wrote the screenplay for director/producer John Goldschmidt&#x27;s television movie &quot;Life for Christine&quot;, which told the true story of a 15-year-old girl&#x27;s life imprisonment. The film was shown in prime-time on the ITV Network by Granada Television. She also wrote the screenplay for the 1980 BBC miniseries adaptation of Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, starring Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul. In 1989, she contributed to the book for the Petula Clark West End musical &quot;Someone Like You&quot;.

Weldon&#x27;s most celebrated work is her 1983 novel &quot;The Life and Loves of a She-Devil&quot;, which she wrote at the age of 52.

Her novel &quot;The Hearts and Lives of Men&quot; was written and published in serial form, appearing in the British magazine &quot;Woman&quot; between 1 February and 15 November 1986. She told &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;It was written as the Dickens novels were written...You made it up as you went along, confined by the structure of the story, which is going to go on for you don&#x27;t know how long—but you have to be able to bring it to an end with three weeks&#x27; warning.&quot;

In 1993, her play &quot;Mr Director&quot; was produced at the Orange Tree Theatre in London. Its subject was the treatment of juveniles in a children&#x27;s home.

In 2000, Weldon&#x27;s novel &quot;The Bulgari Connection&quot; became notorious for its product placement, naming the jewellers not only in the title but another 34 times, while a minimum of 12 times was stipulated in the £18,000 contract.

===Other literary activities===
In 1996, she was a member of the jury at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival. She was also chair of judges for the 1983 Booker Prize. The judging for that prize produced a draw between J. M. Coetzee&#x27;s &quot;Life &amp; Times of Michael K&quot; and Salman Rushdie&#x27;s &quot;Shame&quot;, leaving Weldon to choose between the two. According to Stephen Moss in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Her arm was bent and she chose Rushdie&quot; only to change her mind as the result was being phoned through.

Weldon was appointed Professor of Creative Writing at Brunel University in West London in 2006: &quot;A great writer needs a certain personality and a natural talent for language, but there is a great deal that can be taught – how to put words together quickly and efficiently to make a point, how to be graceful and eloquent, how to convey emotion, how to build up tension, and how to create alternative worlds.&quot; In 2012 Weldon was appointed Professor of Creative Writing at Bath Spa University, where she shared an office with Professor Maggie Gee.

Weldon served together with Daniel Pipes as the most notable foreign members of the board of the Danish Free Press Society.

===Feminism===
A self-declared feminist, Weldon&#x27;s work features what she described as &quot;overweight, plain women&quot; – as she deliberately sought, she said, to write about and give a voice to women who are often overlooked or not featured in the media. She said there were many reasons why she became a feminist, including &quot;appalling&quot; lack of equal opportunities and the myth that women were supported by male relatives. &quot;What drove me to feminism fifty years ago was the myth that men were the breadwinners and women kept house and looked pretty.&quot; She noted that the turning point for her, however, was the outright sexism in the media industry at that time, such as when she attended a casting session of a TV drama she had written and watched the male director and producer &quot;...cast the lead by flicking through Spotlight and just choosing the girl they both most fancied. And they were amazed when I objected: female skill, talent, experience, intelligence meant nothing to them&quot;.

However, some of Weldon&#x27;s commentary drew controversy. In a 1998 interview for the &quot;Radio Times&quot;, Weldon stated that rape &quot;isn&#x27;t the worst thing that can happen to a woman if you&#x27;re safe, alive and unmarked after the event.&quot; She was roundly condemned by groups representing women victims of rape and violence. In a 2017 interview on BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot;, she expressed ambivalence about the successes of feminism. Social change had been enormous, &quot;thanks to feminism&quot;, but it wasn&#x27;t all wonderful: &quot;We saw a world of young, healthy, intelligent, striving women. And we didn&#x27;t really, honestly, take much notice of those who were not like us.&quot;

== Personal life and death ==
In 1953, while working at the Foreign Office, Weldon became pregnant by musician Colyn Davies whom she met when he was moonlighting as a doorman. She said that while she wanted the child (son Nicolas), she decided she did not want the father. In 1957, tired of struggling to support herself as a single mother, she married Ronald Bateman, a headmaster 25 years her senior. They lived together in Acton, London, for two years, until the marriage ended.

In 1961, aged 29, Weldon met her second husband, Ron Weldon, a jazz musician and antiques dealer. They married in 1963 when Fay was pregnant with her second son Dan (born that same year). They lived in East Compton, Somerset, later having two more sons, Tom (1970) and Sam (1977). It was while she was pregnant with Dan that Weldon began writing for radio and television. The couple visited therapists regularly and in 1992 Ron left Fay for his astrological therapist, who had told him that the couple&#x27;s astrological signs were incompatible. They began divorce proceedings, although Ron died in 1994, just eight hours before the divorce was finalised.

In 1994 Weldon married Nick Fox, a poet who was also her manager, but instigated divorce proceedings in 2020.

In 2000 Weldon became a member of the Church of England and was confirmed in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. She stated that she liked to think that she was &quot;converted by St Paul&quot;.

Weldon died at a care home in Northampton, England, on 4 January 2023, at the age of 91. She was survived by her sons as well as twelve grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.

<text>Melvin Lloyd Parnell (June 13, 1922 – March 20, 2012) was an American professional baseball pitcher who spent his entire Major League Baseball (MLB) career with the Boston Red Sox. Listed at and , he threw and batted left-handed.

== Playing career ==
Parnell spent his entire ten-year career with the Boston Red Sox (1947–1956), compiling a 123–75 record with 732 strikeouts, a 3.50 earned run average, 113 complete games, 20 shutouts, and innings pitched in 289 games (232 as a starter). He has the third-highest career winning percentage for a left-hander at Fenway Park (minimum 25 decisions), at 71–30 (.703).

Parnell was also an above-average hitting pitcher, posting a .198 batting average (132-for-668) with 52 runs, 1 home run, 50 RBIs, and 29 bases on balls. Defensively, he was solid, recording a .971 fielding percentage, 13 points above the league average for his position.

Parnell enjoyed his best season in 1949, going 25–7, leading the league in wins, complete games (27), and innings pitched (), and finishing second with a 2.77 ERA. He was the starting pitcher for the American League in that year&#x27;s All-Star Game and was selected again in 1951.

Following two 18-win seasons in 1950 and 1951, and a 12–12 record in 1952, Parnell went 21–8 in 1953 with a 3.06 ERA and a career-high 136 strikeouts. On July 14, 1956, he pitched a no-hitter against the Chicago White Sox, winning 4–0 at Fenway Park. This no-hitter was the first by a Red Sox pitcher since Howard Ehmke in 1923. It would be the final highlight of Parnell&#x27;s career, which ended prematurely after the 1956 season due to a torn muscle in his pitching arm. It took 52 years for another Red Sox left-hander, Jon Lester, to throw a no-hitter, which he achieved in 2008.

Parnell still holds the Red Sox career record for left-handed pitchers in games started, innings pitched, and victories.

Parnell once remarked that a southpaw&#x27;s biggest challenge at Fenway Park was the limited foul territory, not the wall. It’s commonly said that following a victory in Fenway during which Johnny Pesky hit a game-winning home run near the right-field foul pole, Parnell named it &quot;Pesky&#x27;s Pole.&quot; However, research shows that Pesky hit only one home run in a game pitched by Parnell, a two-run shot in the first inning of a game against Detroit on June 11, 1950. The Tigers eventually won that game in the 14th inning with a three-run homer by Tigers&#x27; right fielder Vic Wertz, and Parnell earned a no-decision.

==Post-playing career==
After his playing career, Parnell managed the New Orleans Pelicans of the Class AA Southern Association in 1959 and several Red Sox farm teams from 1961 to 1963.

From 1965 to 1968, Parnell was a member of Boston’s radio and television announcing crew and later joined the Chicago White Sox’ television crew in 1969. He called the final out of the last regular-season game of the 1967 Red Sox &quot;Impossible Dream&quot; season on WHDH-TV:
&quot;Little soft pop-up...Petrocelli will take it...he does! The ball game is over! The Red Sox win it! And what a mob on this field! They&#x27;re coming out of the stands from all over!&quot;

Parnell was mentioned in Terry Cashman’s 1981 song &quot;Talkin&#x27; Baseball&quot;.

In 1997, he was inducted into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame. Parnell resided in New Orleans until his death in 2012 after a long battle with cancer.

<doc id="826825" wikidata="Q899637" url="?curid=826825" title="HOMO and LUMO">
<text>In chemistry, HOMO and LUMO are types of molecular orbitals. The acronyms stand for &quot;highest occupied molecular orbital&quot; and &quot;lowest unoccupied molecular orbital&quot;, respectively. HOMO and LUMO are sometimes collectively called the &quot;frontier orbitals&quot;, such as in the frontier molecular orbital theory.

==Gap==
The energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO is &quot;the HOMO–LUMO gap&quot;. Its size can be used to predict the strength and stability of transition metal complexes, as well as the colors they produce in solution. As a rule of thumb, the smaller a compound&#x27;s HOMO–LUMO gap, the less stable the compound.

==Semiconductors==
The HOMO level is to organic semiconductors roughly what the maximum valence band is to inorganic semiconductors and quantum dots. The same analogy can be made between the LUMO level and the conduction band minimum.

==Organometallic chemistry==
In organometallic chemistry, the size of the LUMO lobe can help predict where addition to pi ligands will occur.

==SOMO==
A &quot;SOMO&quot; is a &quot;singly occupied molecular orbital&quot; such as half-filled HOMO of a radical. This abbreviation may also be extended to &quot;semi occupied molecular orbital&quot;.

==Subadjacent orbitals: NHOMO and SLUMO==
If existent, the molecular orbitals at one energy level below the HOMO and one energy level above the LUMO are also found to play a role in frontier molecular orbital theory. They are named &quot;NHOMO&quot; for &quot;next-to-highest occupied molecular orbital&quot; and &quot;SLUMO&quot; for &quot;second lowest unoccupied molecular orbital&quot;. These are also commonly referred to as HOMO−1 and LUMO+1 respectively.

<text>The Maitum anthropomorphic burial jars are earthenware secondary burial vessels discovered in 1991 by the National Museum of the Philippines&#x27; archaeological team in Ayub Cave, Barangay Pinol, Maitum, Sarangani Province, Mindanao, Philippines. The jars are anthropomorphic; characterized by a design that suggests human figures with complete or partial facial features of the first inhabitants of Mindanao. Furthermore, they give emphasis to the Filipinos’ popular belief of life after death.

According to Eusebio Dizon, head of the archaeological team, this type of burial jars are &quot;remarkably unique and intriguing&quot; because they have not been found elsewhere in Southeast Asia. Thus, many archaeologists from Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Laos, Cambodia, Burma and Indonesia gained interest on this initial find and a number of archaeological – either government or privately sponsored – excavations have been conducted to recover these artifacts.

These jars have characteristics that belong to the Developed Metal Age Period in the Philippines [calibrated date of 190 BC to 500 AD]. According to the laboratory results determined through radiocarbon dating, these secondary burial jars date back to the Metal Age. Two conventional dates were 1830 +/-60 B.P. [calibrated date of AD 70 to 370] and 1920 +/- 50 B.P. [calibrated date of 5 BC to 225 AD]. Experts used soot samples taken from the walls of a small earthenware vessel found inside one of the larger burial jars.

==Discovery==

The information about “potteries bearing human forms encountered while treasure hunting for Pacific War treasures” was shared through a phone call, on June 3, 1991, between a consulting geologist named Michael Spadafora and an archaeologist named Eusebio Dizon. Three days after, the archaeologist received photographs of exceptional artifacts collected by local residents. The artifacts have high probability of significance not only to the history of Maguindanao, but also to the entire Philippine prehistory. That&#x27;s why when they found a fund sponsor for Dizon&#x27;s trip to Mindanao, he still went despite the unpredictable climate and safety risks.

The Maitum Archaeological Project of the National Museum team formally started on November 6, 1991. Ayub Cave, now referred to as Pinol Cave, is a Miocene limestone formation located approximately 1,000 meters due south of the Mindanao shoreline with an elevation of 6 meters. The site is on the coastal area of Pinol, Maitum (formerly a part of South Cotobato Province), Sarangani. The first phase of the excavation ended in December 1991, the second was from April 8 to May 3, 1992, and the third and final phase was from January 17 to February 15, 1995.

Unfortunately, the conflict between the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) during the 70&#x27;s resulted in irreversible casualties in this historical site. It threatened future discoveries and prevented preservation. No complete Maitum jar in the form of a female has survived, but there are still evidence of its existence such as the many pottery shards of female breasts. This is an indication of equality in terms of the practice of jar burials.

Altogether, a total of 29 burial jars and approximately 33 baskets or about 4 cubic meters of archaeological material have been collected. Most of them are now in the possession and care of the National Museum while some are on display at the second level of Maitum Municipal Hall in an exhibit called as &quot;The Treasures of Maitum&quot;. And because of its significance the Pinol Cave was declared by the National Museum of the Philippines as an “Important Cultural Property” on May 5, 2009.

==Physical characteristics==

Even though the burial jars are similar to that of the pottery found in Kulaman Plateau, Southern Mindanao and many more excavation sites here in the Philippines, what makes the Maitum jars uniquely different is how the anthropomorphic features depict “specific dead persons whose remains they guard”.

So far, there have been four classified kinds of cover and lid: (1) Anthropomorphic motif or head, (2) Trunconical with simple appliquéd design, (3) Simple ovaloid with four ear handles, and (4) Trunconical with adz shape and round spinning shape motif. While there are three types of heads: (1) Plain, (2) Perforated, and (3) Painted red and black from hematite and organic material. The black paint may indicate where the hair of the dead has once been.

Some jars are decorated with glass beads and shell scoops, spoons and pendants. All of these features represent and reflect the Maitum potters’ creativity and thinking abilities.

===Heads===

The heads of the anthropomorphic covers portray different facial expressions and emotions, ranging from happiness and contentment to sadness and grief. Other heads also display full sets of teeth; others appear to be toothless (way by which the chin and lips recede).
The method of shaping the head is rather similar from the standard potting technique of creating a round pot with a high or long neck. The presence of paint may be an indication of status, while the size of the heads is an indication of age.

===Eyes===

Since the eyes are believed to be expressive, the eyes portrayed in Maitum jars are given high regard in describing the dead. The eyes are classified to four major shapes: (1) almond, (2) ovaloid, (3) round and (4) rectangular.

There is also a variation between the eyelids of different individuals. Some are incised, appliquéd, protruding and flat. In addition, some eyes are ringed with black hematite paints.

===Ears===

The ears either have (1) a hole in the center or (2) an ovaloid shape with an extended curl. In the former style, the upper outer ear is formed into an ovaloid shaped with a hole in the center while the lower outer ear is formed by a lobe. On the other hand, the latter style explains the formation of the upper outer ear into an ovaloid shape with an extended curl going inside and the lower outer part consisting of the earlobe.

===Nose===

The base of the nose are either (1) triangular, (2) concave, (3) beaklike or (4) bulbous.

===Mouth===

The mouth is generally distinguished by how many teeth are showing. Some mouth hold (1) two rows of incised teeth, (2) one row of incised teeth, (3) two rows of teeth and tongue, (4) row of teeth with holes on each base, or (5) one row of teeth with a hole in the middle of each tooth. To several who have no teeth, the feature is only a gaping hole with a tongue.

===Arms and Hands===

The most common type of arms and hands are appliquéd and molded. These human-like forms were associated with metal implements like bracelets.

===Breasts===

These feature were either applied or molded, and may be classified into male or female breasts with other qualities that may give hints on the age of the dead. To differentiate, male breasts are usually molded marked by a light curve topped with a nipple. On the other hand, several of the female breasts have no nipples distinguished by a shallow protrusion, and slightly sloping.

===Measurements===

The obtained measurements of Maitum jars without its anthropomorphic lid has the height of 43.5 cm, widest diameter of 36 cm, widest mouth diameter of 30 cm and a thickness of 0.7 cm. The shape was more of the torso of a male body. From the shoulder to the elbow, the arms measure 12 cm and, consequently, 17 cm from the elbow to the fingers. Along with its cover, the burial jar is noted to have a total height of 70 cm.

<text>Griffith Morgan (1700–1737), better known as Guto Nyth Brân (Guto being a diminutive of Griffith and &quot;Nyth Brân&quot; () the name of his parents&#x27; farm near Porth), was an athlete. Many of Guto&#x27;s running feats have since become merged with legend, and were disseminated by poets and authors such as I. D. Hooson, who wrote the ballad &quot;Guto Nyth Brân&quot;. Much of what is known of Guto was recorded by in his 1888 book &quot;Plwy Llanwynno&quot; ().

==History as a runner==

Guto was born in Llwyncelyn, a small village found today in the community of Porth. It was said that his talent first came to prominence as he was helping his father herd sheep when he managed to chase and catch a wild hare. Once locals heard of this there were new rumours every day of him catching hares, foxes and birds. One such legend has him running from his home to the local town of Pontypridd and back, a total distance of some , before his mother&#x27;s kettle had boiled. Another tale is that he could blow out a candle and be in bed before the light faded. His talent was noticed by a local shopkeeper, Siân o&#x27;r Siop (Siân from the Shop), and she became his trainer and manager.

The first race organised by Siân o&#x27;r Siop saw Guto taking on an unbeaten English captain over a distance of 4 miles on Hirwaun Common. Guto won easily and collected the £400 prize money, the first of many prizes he and Siân would win. Guto and Siân fell in love. As Guto kept winning his races it became difficult for him to find willing opponents to race against. He and Siân decided to retire to a quiet life before Guto turned 30. But years later a new runner had come to the fore: his name was Prince and he was affectionately known as the &quot;Prince of Bedwas&quot;. Siân convinced Guto to come out of retirement in 1737 for one race with the prize being 1000 guineas. This is .

The race was over 12 miles between Newport and Bedwas. Guto&#x27;s effort looked in vain as Prince took an early lead, but a devastating uphill sprint from Guto saw him surge past Prince near the end and beat his challenger, taking the prize and the honour of being named the fastest man of his time. But the race took a fatal toll on Guto: it is reputed that during the post-race celebrations he collapsed and died in his lover&#x27;s arms after an over vigorous congratulatory back-slap.

His body was laid to rest at St Gwynno Church in the Llanwynno forestry. A large gravestone was erected in 1866, over 100 years after his death.

==Nos Galan road race==

The Nos Galan road race () is an annual 5 kilometre (3.1 mi) race, run on &quot;Nos Galan&quot; () in Mountain Ash, in the Cynon Valley, Wales. It attracts runners from all over Great Britain. The 2009 race attracted over 800 runners, and 10,000 people into Mountain Ash for the associated entertainment.

The race was created by Mountain Ash resident Bernard Baldwin, a PE teacher in Pontypridd and a President of the Amateur Athletic Association, in 1958 as a memorial. It is run over the course of Guto&#x27;s first competitive race. Each year a mystery runner competes: these have included Lillian Board, Iwan Thomas and Linford Christie.

The main race starts with a church service at Llanwynno, and then a wreath is laid on Guto&#x27;s grave in Llanwynno graveyard. After lighting a torch, it is carried to the nearby town of Mountain Ash, where the main race takes place. The current route consists of three circuits of the town centre, starting in Henry Street and ending in Oxford Street, by the commemorative statue of Guto.

Traditionally, the race was timed to end at midnight, but in recent times it was rescheduled for the convenience of family entertainment, now concluding at around 21:00. This has resulted in a regrowth in size and scale, and now starts with an afternoon of street entertainment, and fun run races for children, concluding with the church service, elite runners&#x27; race and presentations.

==Memorial==
The statue in bronze of Guto Nyth Brân in the centre of Mountain Ash was commissioned by Mid Glamorgan County Council in 1990 and sculpted by Peter Nicholas.

<text>The Business Process Framework is an operating model framework for telecom service providers in the telecommunications industry. The model describes the required business processes of service providers and defines key elements and how they should interact.

The Business Process Framework (eTOM) is a standard maintained by the TM Forum, an association for service providers and their suppliers in the telecommunications and entertainment industries.

== History ==
The development of business process standardization for telecom service providers started with the founding of the TM Forum in 1988. The initial goal was to facilitate the creation of &#x27;interoperable network management products&#x27;. The first approved standard was the &#x27;OSI/NM Forum Protocol Specification,&#x27; an extension of OSI protocols developed since the late 1970s.

The direct development towards the Business Process Framework (eTOM), as Brenner (2007) explained, was &quot;the Telecom Operation Map (TOM) was first published in 2001. The goal of TOM was the creation of an industry-owned framework of business processes, including the definition of a common enterprise-independent terminology for service management. It was also supposed to serve as a basis for discussing the scope of information management necessary for the execution of the processes. The result of this latter effort has meanwhile spawned its own TMF document family, the Shared Information and Data Model (SID).

The Telecom Operation Map (TOM) was extended in 2001 to eTOM, an acronym for Enhanced Telecom Operations Map. The process model eTOm was renamed &quot;Enhanced Telecom Operations Map (eTOM)&quot; and in 2013 to &quot;Business Process Framework (eTOM).&quot;

There have been many versions of eTOM. Version 14 was published in May 2014. It has also been developed into a component of NGOSS, which has been renamed Frameworx.

== Building blocks ==
=== Hierarchy ===

The Business Process Framework model consists of processes at 5 levels:
* Strategy, 
* Network Operations, 
* Level-2, 
* Level-3,
* Level-4. 
These levels form a hierarchy, with each level encapsulating a group of processes at the next level of detail.

=== Rows and columns ===
The graphic representation of a Business Process Framework (eTOM) model consists of rows and columns, the intersections of which denote specific business processes. 
* The top row includes customer facing activities such as marketing, 
* While the bottom row includes supplier facing and support activities. 
In this manner the Business Process Framework map covers the whole value chain. The map also indicates the interaction between processes.

=== Three broad sections ===
Business Process Framework (eTOM) processes fall into three major process areas,
* &quot;Strategy, Infrastructure &amp; Product&quot;,
* &quot;Operations&quot;, and
* &quot;Enterprise Management&quot;,
; Strategy, Infrastructure &amp; Product:
:; Columns
:: Strategy and Commit, Infrastructure Lifecycle Management and Product Lifecycle Management
:; Rows
:: Marketing &amp; Offer Management, Service Development &amp; Management, Resource Development &amp; Management and Supply Chain Development &amp; Management

; Operations
:; Columns
:: Operations Support &amp; Readiness, Fulfillment, Assurance and Billing
:; Rows
:; Relationship Management, Service Management &amp; Operations, Resource Management &amp; Operations and Supplier/Partner
:; Relationship Management.

== Other standards ==
* ITIL is an analogous standard or framework for best practices in information technology. 
* Both of these frameworks are part of Total Quality Management, in which industries have, since 1950, formalized their business processes and metrics in search of higher quality, fewer defects, and greater efficiency.
* ISO 9000 is another of these &quot;process and results improvement&quot; standards, but it is far more generic than either Business Process Framework or ITIL. 
* Business Process Framework has been adopted by the ITU-T as a Recommendation and published in the M.3050.x series.
* OpenReference is a business process framework developed for product and service businesses and includes processes, metrics and practices.

<doc id="826868" wikidata="Q1306230" url="?curid=826868" title="Cutting stock problem">
<text>In operations research, the cutting-stock problem is the problem of cutting standard-sized pieces of stock material, such as paper rolls or sheet metal, into pieces of specified sizes while minimizing material wasted. It is an optimization problem in mathematics that arises from applications in industry. In terms of computational complexity, the problem is an NP-hard problem reducible to the knapsack problem. The problem can be formulated as an integer linear programming problem.

== Illustration of one-dimensional cutting-stock problem ==

A paper machine can produce an unlimited number of master (jumbo) rolls, each 5600 mm wide. The following 13 items must be cut, in the table below.

The important thing about this kind of problem is that many different product units can be made from the same master roll, and the number of possible combinations is itself very large, in general, and not trivial to enumerate.

The problem therefore is to find an optimum set of patterns of making product rolls from the master roll, such that the demand is satisfied and waste is minimized.

===Bounds and checks===
A simple lower bound is obtained by dividing the total amount of product by the size of each master roll. The total product required is 1380 x 22 + 1520 x 25 + ... + 2200 x 20 = 407160 mm. Each master roll is 5600  mm, requiring a minimum of 72.7 rolls, which means 73 rolls or more are required.

===Solution===

There are 308 possible patterns for this small instance. The optimal answer requires 73 master rolls and has 0.401% waste; it can be shown computationally that in this case the minimum number of patterns with this level of waste is 10. It can also be computed that 19 different such solutions exist, each with 10 patterns and a waste of 0.401%, of which one such solution is shown below and in the picture:

== Classification ==
Cutting-stock problems can be classified in several ways. One way is the dimensionality of the cutting: the above example illustrates a one-dimensional (1D) problem; other industrial applications of 1D occur when cutting pipes, cables, and steel bars. Two-dimensional (2D) problems are encountered in furniture, clothing and glass production. When either the master item or the required parts are irregular-shaped (a situation often encountered in the leather, textile, metals industries) this is referred to as the &quot;nesting&quot; problem.

Not many three-dimensional (3D) applications involving cutting are known; however the closely related 3D packing problem has many industrial applications, such as packing objects into shipping containers (see e.g. containerization: the related sphere packing problem has been studied since the 17th century (Kepler conjecture)).

==Applications==
Industrial applications of cutting-stock problems for high production volumes arise especially when basic material is produced in large rolls that are further cut into smaller units (see roll slitting). This is done e.g. in paper and plastic film industries but also in production of flat metals like steel or brass. There are many variants and additional constraints arising from special production constraints due to machinery and process limits, customer requirements and quality issues; some examples are:
* Two-stage, where the rolls produced in the first stage are then processed a second time. For instance, all office stationery (e.g. A4 size in Europe, Letter size in US) is produced in such a process. The complication arises because the machinery in the second stage is narrower than the primary. Efficient utilisation of both stages of production is important (from an energy or material use perspective) and what is efficient for the primary stage may be inefficient for the secondary, leading to trade-offs. Metallised film (used in packaging of snacks), and plastic extrusion on paper (used in liquid packaging, e.g. juice cartons) are further examples of such a process.
* Winder constraints where the slitting process has physical or logical constraints: a very common constraint is that only a certain number of slitting knives are available, so that feasible patterns should not contain more than a maximum number of rolls. Because winder machinery is not standardised, very many other constraints are encountered.
* An example of a customer requirement is when a particular order cannot be satisfied from either of the two edge positions: this is because the edges of the sheet tend to have greater variations in thickness and some applications can be very sensitive to these.
* An example of a quality issue is when the master roll contains defects that have to be cut around. Expensive materials with demanding quality characteristics such as photographic paper or Tyvek have to be carefully optimised so that the wasted area is minimised.
* Multi-machine problems arise when orders can be produced on more than one machine and these machines have different widths. Generally availability of more than one master roll width improves the waste considerably; in practice however additional order splitting constraints may have to be taken into account.
* There is also a semi-continuous problem, where the produced rolls do not have to be of the same diameter, but can vary within a range. This typically occurs with sheet orders. This is sometimes known as a &quot;1½ dimensional&quot; problem. This variant also occurs in the production of corrugated fiberboard, where it is called, somewhat confusingly, the &quot;corrugator scheduling problem&quot;.
* Because some paper machines are relatively narrow compared to the demanded items, some companies have invested in a &quot;skiving&quot; (also known as a &quot;web-welding&quot;) secondary process, whereby two reels (produced by slitting the initial jumbo reels) are joined side-by-side (with a little overlap) to make up a wider roll. Producing narrower reels in the primary process leads to lower overall waste.
* In the metals industry one key difference is that typically the master rolls are produced earlier and are generally different from each other (both in terms of width and length). Therefore, there are similarities with the multi-machine problem mentioned above. The presence of length variations creates a 2-D problem, because waste can occur both width-wise and length-wise.
* The guillotine problem is another 2-D problem of cutting sheets into rectangles of specified sizes, however only cuts that continue all the way across each sheet are allowed. Industrial applications of this problem can be found in the glass industry.
* The cutting stock problem of determining, for the one-dimensional case, the best master size that will meet given demand is known as the &quot;assortment&quot; problem.

== History ==
The cutting stock problem was first formulated by Kantorovich in 1939. In 1951 before computers became widely available, L. V. Kantorovich and V. A. Zalgaller suggested solving the problem of the economical use of material at the cutting stage with the help of linear programming. The proposed technique was later called the &quot;column generation method&quot;.

== Mathematical formulation and solution approaches ==
The standard formulation for the cutting-stock problem (but not the only one) starts with a list of &quot;m&quot; orders, each requiring formula_1 pieces, where formula_2. We then construct a list of all possible combinations of cuts (often called &quot;patterns&quot; or &quot;configurations&quot;). Let formula_3 be the number of those patterns. We associate with each pattern a positive integer variable formula_4, representing how many times pattern formula_5 is to be used, where formula_6. The linear integer program is then:

:formula_7
:formula_8
:formula_9, integer

where formula_10 is the number of times order formula_11 appears in pattern formula_5 and formula_13 is the cost (often the waste) of pattern formula_5. The precise nature of the quantity constraints can lead to subtly different mathematical characteristics. The above formulation&#x27;s quantity constraints are minimum constraints (at least the given amount of each order must be produced, but possibly more). 

When formula_15, the objective minimises the number of utilised master items and, if the constraint for the quantity to be produced is replaced by equality, it is called the bin packing problem. 

The most general formulation has two-sided constraints (and in this case a minimum-waste solution may consume more than the minimum number of master items):

:formula_16

This formulation applies not just to one-dimensional problems. Many variations are possible, including one where the objective is not to minimise the waste, but to maximise the total value of the produced items, allowing each order to have a different value.

In general, the number of possible patterns grows exponentially as a function of &quot;m&quot;, the number of orders. As the number of orders increases, it may therefore become impractical to enumerate the possible cutting patterns.

An alternative approach uses delayed column-generation. This method solves the cutting-stock problem by starting with just a few patterns. It generates additional patterns when they are needed. For the one-dimensional case, the new patterns are introduced by solving an auxiliary optimization problem called the knapsack problem, using dual variable information from the linear program. The knapsack problem has well-known methods to solve it, such as branch and bound and dynamic programming. The Delayed Column Generation method can be much more efficient than the original approach, particularly as the size of the problem grows. The column generation approach as applied to the cutting stock problem was pioneered by Gilmore and Gomory in a series of papers published in the 1960s. Gilmore and Gomory showed that this approach is guaranteed to converge to the (fractional) optimal solution, without needing to enumerate all the possible patterns in advance.

A limitation of the original Gilmore and Gomory method is that it does not handle integrality, so the solution may contain fractions, e.g. a particular pattern should be produced 3.67 times. Rounding to the nearest integer often does not work, in the sense that it may lead to a sub-optimal solution and/or under- or over-production of some of the orders (and possible infeasibility in the presence of two-sided demand constraints). This limitation is overcome in modern algorithms, which can solve to optimality (in the sense of finding solutions with minimum waste) very large instances of the problem (generally larger than encountered in practice).

The cutting-stock problem is often highly degenerate, in that multiple solutions with the same amount of waste are possible. This degeneracy arises because it is possible to move items around, creating new patterns, without affecting the amount of waste. This gives rise to a whole collection of related problems which are concerned with some other criterion, such as the following:
* The minimum pattern count problem: to find a minimum-pattern-count solution amongst the minimum-waste solutions. This is a very hard problem, even when the waste is known. There is a conjecture that any equality-constrained one-dimensional instance with &quot;n&quot; sizes has at least one minimum waste solution with no more than &quot;n&quot; + 1 patterns. This conjecture was first refuted in April 2020 with an example with 9 sizes that requires 11 patterns.
* The minimum stack problem: this is concerned with the sequencing of the patterns so as not to have too many partially completed orders at any time. This was an open problem until 2007, when an efficient algorithm based on dynamic programming was published.
* The minimum number of knife changes problem (for the one-dimensional problem): this is concerned with sequencing and permuting the patterns so as to minimise the number of times the slitting knives have to be moved. This is a special case of the generalised travelling salesman problem.

<text>The British Quiz Championship (BQC), also termed the British Quizzing Championship, is a quiz competition in the United Kingdom. The current competition has been organised since 2004 by Chris Jones&#x27; and IQA-CEO Jane Allen&#x27;s company Quizzing Ltd. Early in 2011 the re-launch of the quizzing.co.uk website saw it rebranded as the home of the British Quiz Association.

Before 2004 there had already been some sort of &quot;British Championship&quot; since 1999 run first only by Trevor Montague then by the British Quiz Association (see that page for champions), but after internal strife and a fall in interest in 2003/2004 (see attendance in the BQA links) the old BQA-management gave up and the only British Quiz Championship now is this one run by Quizzing Ltd.

==British Quizzing Championship Roll of Honour since 2004==

== 2004 - Venue Old Trafford Manchester - Winner Kevin Ashman ==

The 2004 British Quiz Championship was run in 2004 as part of the World Quizzing Championship - as staged at various worldwide locations, such as Old Trafford Stadium on 3 July 2004), 

The 2004 event saw 67 entrants at Old Trafford who were joined, in the international event, by several hundred other Quizzers from countries such as Belgium, Estonia, the Netherlands, India and Malaysia quizzing in places such as Bangalore and Kuala Lumpur.

Both the 2004 British and World events were won by England&#x27;s Kevin Ashman.

== 2005 - Venue Altrincham - Winner Kevin Ashman ==

Having won the 2005 MSN Search sponsored World Quizzing Championships on 2 July Kevin Ashman went on to retain his British title later that year. 

== 2006 - Venue Boreatton Park, Shrewsbury - Winner Kevin Ashman ==

Kevin Ashman made it a hat-trick of British Championships in 2005. In a field of 41 competitors Ashman won by 21 points from Mark Bytheway and Pat Gibson in joint second position. A full report on the event is available here

== 2007 - Venue Derby Conference Centre - Winner Pat Gibson ==

The absence of the previous winners and runners up for the last two years (Kevin Ashman and Mark Bytheway) left the field wide open. Pat Gibson emerged victorious, adding the British title to the World title he had also taken from Ashman earlier in the year. Gibson&#x27;s margin of victory over Bjortomt was 12 points.

A full report is available here.

== 2008 - Venue Staveley - Winner Sean Carey ==

A field of 61 competitors including Kevin Ashman (3 time British Champion, past World and European Champion), Mark Bytheway (2008 World Quiz Champion), Pat Gibson (2007 World and British Champion) met at Staveley in Derbyshire. With such a strong field of competitors it was perhaps a surprise that it was Sean Carey who took the title, beating second placed Kevin Ashman by 8 points. Ranked 19th before the start of the event, Carey is the lowest ranked competitor to win the British title, and the first person from outside the top 3. That said, he was likely ranked lower than he ought to have been on account of his not being able to attend as many ranking events as his peers. When he has competed in Grands Prix he has typically been placed in the top 10 of finishers.

== 2009 - Venue Derby Conference Centre - Winner Mark Bytheway ==

All the big players were in attendance for this one, including every former winner of the title. For the first time ever the event had to be settled on a tie-break, Kevin Ashman and Mark Bytheway being neck-and-neck, 8 points ahead of Pat Gibson in third place. Reference was had to the players&#x27; discarded scores (both in Sport &amp; Games) with Bytheway emerging victorious by a margin of one point (170 to 169 out of 240). Byethway&#x27;s achievement was well received by the field of 62, not least because he is still recovering from surgery undertaken after he was struck with a life-threatening illness. Kevin Ashman was typically magnanimous in defeat. He now holds &#x27;just&#x27; the World and European individual titles!

There was a first in the Pairs event, Kathryn Johnson partnering David Lea to a win. In so doing she becomes the first woman to hold a Championship title on the UK quiz circuit. Like the Individual event, the Pairs saw a tie, which had to be decided on &#x27;countback&#x27;. The unlucky Pair who finished as runners-up were Chris Quinn and Mark Kerr.

== 2010 - Venue Derby Conference Centre - Winner Pat Gibson ==

Pat Gibson regained the title he first won in 2007 and was the first to get his hands on the new Mark Bytheway Trophy, named in memory of last year&#x27;s winner who died in July 2010. The trophy is to be inscribed with the names of former winners. This year&#x27;s questions were written by former (BQA/Montague era) champion, John Wilson (since 2006 they have been composed by Quizzing.co.uk&#x27;s principal setter Chris Jones).

In the Pairs event, 2008 winners David Edwards and Nic Paul became the first duo to regain the title. Second place went to Jesse Honey &amp; Sean Carey and third to Kevin Ashman &amp; Pat Gibson.

== 2011 - Venue Cathedral Lodge Hotel, Lichfield - Winner Kevin Ashman ==

John Wilson again wrote the questions for the individual championship, which for the first time was held in 2 venues, the main one in Lichfield but with some players taking part in a venue in Normandy. 
Kevin Ashman won with a score of 158 out of a maximum 210, a full 24 points ahead of defending champion Pat Gibson.

In the Pairs event, Ian Bayley and Pat Gibson repeated their win of 2006.

<doc id="826885" wikidata="Q897194" url="?curid=826885" title="Braess's paradox">
<text>Braess&#x27;s paradox is the observation that adding one or more roads to a road network can slow down overall traffic flow through it. The paradox was first discovered by Arthur Pigou in 1920, and later named after the German mathematician Dietrich Braess in 1968.

The paradox may have analogies in electrical power grids and biological systems. It has been suggested that, in theory, the improvement of a malfunctioning network could be accomplished by removing certain parts of it. The paradox has been used to explain instances of improved traffic flow when existing major roads are closed.

== Discovery and definition ==
Dietrich Braess, a mathematician at Ruhr University, Germany, noticed the flow in a road network could be impeded by adding a new road, when he was working on traffic modelling. His idea was that if each driver is making the optimal self-interested decision as to which route is quickest, a shortcut could be chosen too often for drivers to have the shortest travel times possible. More formally, the idea behind Braess&#x27;s discovery is that the Nash equilibrium may not equate with the best overall flow through a network.

The paradox is stated as follows:&quot;For each point of a road network, let there be given the number of cars starting from it and the destination of the cars. Under these conditions, one wishes to estimate the distribution of traffic flow. Whether one street is preferable to another depends not only on the quality of the road, but also on the density of the flow. If every driver takes the path that looks most favourable to them, the resultant running times need not be minimal. Furthermore, it is indicated by an example that an extension of the road network may cause a redistribution of the traffic that results in longer individual running times.&quot;

Adding extra capacity to a network when the moving entities selfishly choose their route can in some cases reduce overall performance. That is because the Nash equilibrium of such a system is not necessarily optimal. The network change induces a new game structure which leads to a (multiplayer) prisoner&#x27;s dilemma. In a Nash equilibrium, drivers have no incentive to change their routes. While the system is not in a Nash equilibrium, individual drivers are able to improve their respective travel times by changing the routes they take. In the case of Braess&#x27;s paradox, drivers will continue to switch until they reach Nash equilibrium despite the reduction in overall performance.

If the latency functions are linear, adding an edge can never make total travel time at equilibrium worse by a factor of more than 4/3.

== Possible instances of the paradox in action ==

=== Prevalence ===
In 1983, Steinberg and Zangwill provided, under reasonable assumptions, the necessary and sufficient conditions for Braess&#x27;s paradox to occur in a general transportation network when a new route is added. (Note that their result applies to the addition of &quot;any&quot; new route, not just to the case of adding a single link.) As a corollary, they obtain that Braess&#x27;s paradox is about as likely to occur as not occur when a random new route is added.

=== Traffic ===
Braess&#x27;s paradox has a counterpart in case of a reduction of the road network, which may cause a reduction of individual commuting time.

In Seoul, South Korea, traffic around the city sped up when the Cheonggye Expressway was removed as part of the Cheonggyecheon restoration project. In Stuttgart, Germany, after investments into the road network in 1969, the traffic situation did not improve until a section of newly built road was closed for traffic again. In 1990 the temporary closing of 42nd Street in Manhattan, New York City, for Earth Day reduced the amount of congestion in the area. In 2008 Youn, Gastner and Jeong demonstrated specific routes in Boston, New York City and London where that might actually occur and pointed out roads that could be closed to reduce predicted travel times. In 2009, New York experimented with closures of Broadway at Times Square and Herald Square, which resulted in improved traffic flow and permanent pedestrian plazas.

In 2012, Paul Lecroart, of the institute of planning and development of the Île-de-France, wrote that &quot;Despite initial fears, the removal of main roads does not cause deterioration of traffic conditions beyond the starting adjustments. The traffic transfer are limited and below expectations&quot;. He also notes that some private vehicle trips (and related economic activity) are not transferred to public transport and simply disappear (&quot;evaporate&quot;).

The same phenomenon was also observed when road closing was not part of an urban project but the consequence of an accident. In 2012 in Rouen, a bridge was destroyed by fire. Over the next two years, other bridges were used more, but the total number of cars crossing bridges was reduced.

=== Electricity ===
In 2012, scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization demonstrated, through computational modelling, the potential for the phenomenon to occur in power transmission networks where power generation is decentralized.

In 2012, an international team of researchers from Institut Néel (CNRS, France), INP (France), IEMN (CNRS, France) and UCL (Belgium) published in &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot; a paper showing that Braess&#x27;s paradox may occur in mesoscopic electron systems. In particular, they showed that adding a path for electrons in a nanoscopic network paradoxically reduced its conductance. That was shown both by simulations as well as experiments at low temperature using scanning gate microscopy.

=== Springs ===

A model with springs and ropes can show that a hung weight can rise in height despite a taut rope in the hanging system being cut, and follows from the same mathematical structure as the original Braess&#x27;s paradox.

For two identical springs joined in series by a short rope, their total spring constant is half of each individual spring, resulting in a long stretch when a certain weight is hung. This remains the case as we add two longer ropes in slack to connect the lower end of the upper spring to the hung weight (lower end of the lower spring), and the upper end of the lower spring to the hanging point (upper end of the upper spring). However, when the short rope is cut, the longer ropes become taut, and the two springs become parallel (in the mechanical sense) to each other. The total spring constant is twice that of each individual spring, and when the length of the long ropes is not too long, the hung weight will actually be higher compared to before the short rope was cut.

The fact that the hung weight rises despite cutting a taut rope (the short rope) in the hanging system is counter-intuitive, but it does follow from Hooke&#x27;s law and the way springs work in series and in parallel.

=== Biology ===
Adilson E. Motter and collaborators demonstrated that Braess&#x27;s paradox outcomes may often occur in biological and ecological systems. Motter suggests removing part of a perturbed network could rescue it. For resource management of endangered species food webs, in which extinction of many species might follow sequentially, selective removal of a doomed species from the network could in principle bring about the positive outcome of preventing a series of further extinctions.

=== Team sports strategy ===
It has been suggested that in basketball, a team can be seen as a network of possibilities for a route to scoring a basket, with a different efficiency for each pathway, and a star player could reduce the overall efficiency of the team, analogous to a shortcut that is overused increasing the overall times for a journey through a road network. A proposed solution for maximum efficiency in scoring is for a star player to shoot about the same number of shots as teammates. However, this approach is not supported by hard statistical evidence, as noted in the original paper.

=== Blockchain networks ===
Braess&#x27;s paradox has been shown to appear in blockchain payment channel networks, also known as layer-2 networks. Payment channel networks implement a solution to the scalability problem of blockchain networks, allowing transactions of high rates without recording them on the blockchain. In such a network, users can establish a channel by locking funds on each side of the channel. Transactions are executed either through a channel connecting directly the payer and payee or through a path of channels with intermediate users that ask for some fees. 

While intuitively, opening new channels allows higher routing flexibility, adding a new channel might cause higher fees, and similarly closing existing channels might decrease fees. The paper presented a theoretical analysis with conditions for the paradox, methods for mitigating the paradox as well as an empirical analysis, showing the appearance in practice of the paradox and its effects on Bitcoin&#x27;s Lightning network.

== Mathematical approach ==

=== Example ===
Consider a road network as shown in the adjacent diagram on which 4000 drivers wish to travel from point Start to End. The travel time in minutes on the Start–A road is the number of travellers (T) divided by 100, and on Start–B is a constant 45 minutes (likewise with the roads across from them). If the dashed road does not exist (so the traffic network has 4 roads in total), the time needed to drive Start–A–End route with formula_1 drivers would be formula_2. The time needed to drive the Start–B–End route with formula_3 drivers would be formula_4. As there are 4000 drivers, the fact that formula_5 can be used to derive the fact that formula_6 when the system is at equilibrium. Therefore, each route takes formula_7 minutes. If either route took less time, it would not be a Nash equilibrium: a rational driver would switch from the longer route to the shorter route.

Now suppose the dashed line A–B is a road with an extremely short travel time of approximately 0 minutes. Suppose that the road is opened and one driver tries Start–A–B–End. To his surprise he finds that his time is formula_8 minutes, a saving of almost 25 minutes. Soon, more of the 4000 drivers are trying this new route. The time taken rises from 40.01 and keeps climbing. When the number of drivers trying the new route reaches 2500, with 1500 still in the Start–B–End route, their time will be formula_9 minutes, which is no improvement over the original route. Meanwhile, those 1500 drivers have been slowed to formula_10 minutes, a 20-minute increase. They are obliged to switch to the new route via A too, so it now takes formula_11 minutes. Nobody has any incentive to travel A-End or Start-B because any driver trying them will take 85 minutes. Thus, the opening of the cross route triggers an irreversible change to it by everyone, costing everyone 80 minutes instead of the original 65. If every driver were to agree not to use the A–B path, or if that route were closed, every driver would benefit by a 15-minute reduction in travel time.

=== Existence of an equilibrium ===
If one assumes the travel time for each person driving on an edge to be equal, an equilibrium will always exist.

Let formula_12 be the formula for the travel time of each person traveling along edge formula_13 when formula_14 people take that edge. Suppose there is a traffic graph with formula_15 people driving along edge formula_13. Let the energy of formula_13, formula_18, be

: formula_19

(If formula_20 let formula_21). Let the total energy of the traffic graph be the sum of the energies of every edge in the graph.

Take a choice of routes that minimizes the total energy. Such a choice must exist because there are finitely many choices of routes. That will be an equilibrium.

Assume, for contradiction, this is not the case. Then, there is at least one driver who can switch the route and improve the travel time. Suppose the original route is formula_22 while the new route is formula_23. Let formula_24 be total energy of the traffic graph, and consider what happens when the route formula_25 is removed. The energy of each edge formula_26 will be reduced by formula_27 and so the formula_24 will be reduced by formula_29. That is simply the total travel time needed to take the original route. If the new route is then added, formula_23, the total energy formula_24 will be increased by the total travel time needed to take the new route. Because the new route is shorter than the original route, formula_24 must decrease relative to the original configuration, contradicting the assumption that the original set of routes minimized the total energy.

Therefore, the choice of routes minimizing total energy is an equilibrium.

=== Finding an equilibrium ===
The above proof outlines a procedure known as best response dynamics, which finds an equilibrium for a linear traffic graph and terminates in a finite number of steps. The algorithm is termed &quot;best response&quot; because at each step of the algorithm, if the graph is not at equilibrium then some driver has a best response to the strategies of all other drivers and switches to that response.

Pseudocode for Best Response Dynamics:
 Let &quot;P&quot; be some traffic pattern.
 while &quot;P&quot; is not at equilibrium:
 compute the potential energy &quot;e&quot; of &quot;P&quot;

At each step, if some particular driver could do better by taking an alternate path (a &quot;best response&quot;), doing so strictly decreases the energy of the graph. If no driver has a best response, the graph is at equilibrium. Since the energy of the graph strictly decreases with each step, the best response dynamics algorithm must eventually halt.

=== How far from optimal is traffic at equilibrium? ===
If the travel time functions are linear, that is formula_33 for some formula_34, then at worst, traffic in the energy-minimizing equilibrium is twice as bad as socially optimal.

Proof: Let formula_35 be some traffic configuration, with associated energy formula_36 and total travel time formula_37. For each edge, the energy is the sum of an arithmetic progression, and using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression, one can show that formula_38. If formula_39 is the socially-optimal traffic flow and formula_40 is the energy-minimizing traffic flow, the inequality implies that formula_41.

Thus, the total travel time for the energy-minimizing equilibrium is at most twice as bad as for the optimal flow.

=== Effect of network topology ===
Mlichtaich proved that Braess&#x27;s paradox may occur if and only if the network is not a series-parallel graph.

<text>Maitum, officially the Municipality of Maitum (; , Jawi: ايڠد نو مايتم; ), is a municipality in the province of Sarangani, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 44,185 people, making it the least populated municipality in the province.
It is bordered on the west by the province of Sultan Kudarat, on the east by the municipality of Kiamba, on the north by the province of South Cotabato, and the south by the Celebes Sea.

==History==
According to local folklore, &quot;Maitum&quot; refers to the black stones in the Saub River. It is believed that the river stones turned black when the local native princess and her warrior lover passed through it as they eloped and escaped from the wrath of the princess&#x27;s father who disapproved of their marriage. The town&#x27;s name is derived from the Visayan word &quot;maitom&quot;, literally meaning black.

In 1928, Maitum became part of the municipality of Kiamba. It became a separate municipality on May 7, 1959, through Republic Act No. 2189.

==Geography==

===Barangays===
Maitum is politically subdivided into 19 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks while some have sitios.

* Batian
* Kalaneg
* Kalaong
* Kiambing
* Kiayap
* Mabay
* Maguling
* Malalag
* Mindupok
* New La Union
* Old Poblacion
* Pangi
* Pinol
* Sison
* Ticulab
* Tuanadatu
* Upo
* Wali
* Zion

===Climate===

==Demographics==
The majority of the population are of Ilocano origin. One of the indigenous peoples living in mountainous areas of Maitum is known as T&#x27;boli. The annual Binuyugan Festival is celebrated in May.

Internationally, Maitum is known for the discovery of very old cave artifacts called Maitum Anthropomorphic Potteries in one of the caves nearby. Ancient burial jars were discovered by archaeologists from the National Museum in Ayub Cave, Maitum, in 1991 and in 2008, at Sagel Cave, Maitum (now declared by National Historical Institute as a national historical sites). Amid Mindanao&#x27;s armed conflicts, artifacts found thereat prove settlements of pre-historic civilization in Maitum.
==Economy==

The economy of Maitum is largely based on agriculture and is often called the &quot;rice-granary&quot; of Sarangani due to its high level production of rice. Aqua-culture is the second biggest income earner, notably the culture of milkfish (&quot;bangus&quot;), prawns (particularly giant prawns) and shrimps for export. Other agricultural products are coconuts, maize, rubber, bananas, mangoes, pork, eggs, beef, fish and cacao. Maitum is also a food basket nationally famous for its marinated flying fish.

The economy has accelerated in the past decade driven by advances in global communication technology and the finishing of a modern highway that tremendously improved trade and transport.
== Wildlife ==
Tarsiers have been discovered in Maitum&#x27;s mountainous areas.

Caves and the rainforest of Maitum are the natural habitat of a rare fruit bat species called giant golden-crowned flying fox (&quot;Acedoron jubatus&quot;), also known as &quot;silent planter,&quot; since it contributes greatly to forest regeneration, because of eating many fruits and their seeds. The rare writhed-billed hornbill and Mindanao hornbill are also found in the surrounding rainforest. The Philippine eagle (a monkey-eating eagle) also thrives in the area.

Endangered hawksbill turtles have their nesting grounds in Maitum&#x27;s former main village called &quot;Old Poblacion&quot;.

Other wild animals are wild boar, deer, monkeys, and various species of snake.

Sea turtles or pawikan can also be found in Maitum, Sarangani specifically at the Pawikan Nesting Sanctuary founded in 2003.

== Cultural Heritage ==
The town is the location where the Maitum Anthropomorphic Pottery or Maitum Jars were found.

In 1991, the National Museum archaeological team discovered anthropomorphic secondary burial jars in Ayub Cave, Barangay Pinol, Maitum, Sarangani, Mindanao, Philippines. The jars are commonly known today as Maitum jars. They are made of earthenware, and are characterized by their design that suggests human figures with complete or partial facial features of the first inhabitants in Mindanao. Furthermore, they give emphasis to the Filipinos’ popular belief of life after death.

According to Dr. Eusebio Dizon, head of the archaeological team, this type of burial jars are “remarkably unique and intriguing” because they have not been found elsewhere in Southeast Asia. Thus, many archaeologists from Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Laos, Cambodia, Burma and Indonesia gained interest on this initial find and a number of archaeological - either government or privately sponsored - excavations have been conducted to recover these artifacts.

These jars have characteristics that belong to the Developed Metal Age Period in the Philippines [calibrated date of 190 BC to 500 AD]. According to the laboratory results determined through radiocarbon dating, these secondary burial jars date back to the Metal Age. Two conventional dates were 1830 +/-60 B.P. [calibrated date of AD 70 to 370] and 1920 +/- 50 B.P. [calibrated date of 5 BC to 225 AD]. Experts used soot samples taken from the walls of a small earthenware vessel found inside one of the larger burial jars.

Most of the jars are now on display at the National Museum of the Philippines in Manila. The town has a museum with Maitum jars, however, the jars are only replicas. According to the town government, they intend for the Maitum jars to be returned to Maitum town from Manila once a proper museum with high-tech conservation capabilities has been established. Unfortunately, funding for the museum from the national government is scarce. Museum researchers have speculated that many Maitum jars have been looted before their initial discovery, as many jars have been seen in the black market.

The Maitum Jars have been declared as &quot;National Treasures of the Philippines&quot; and &quot;Important Cultural Properties of the Philippines&quot;, meaning, they must never get out from the country and should be conserved by all means. Found jars should be directly given to the government for proper conservation for future generations, and must not be sold to collectors. Violating the law that safeguards the Maitum jars will lead to imprisonment of up to 20 years and payment for damages up to 250,000 pesos. Unfortunately, despite the high regard of scholars on the Maitum jars, in an interview of townsfolk in 2012, majority of the residents of Maitum town are unaware of the cultural value of the jars. The interview noted the need for a public awareness campaign on the importance of the Maitum jars for the town&#x27;s heritage, especially to the barangays within the caves they were found in.

Some locals have said that they have sold jars to foreigners, who pay them a hefty price. Locals would sometimes throw away jar shards as well. On top of that, the caves where the jars were initially found have repeatedly been ransacked since there are no physical protections in the site. There are no site guards or a conservation station located within the vicinity of the cave despite being discovered around 3 decades ago. Many jar shards exist in the caves and are left unprotected, despite the caves being declared as a heritage site. Due to these factors, despite many scholars wanting to campaign the declaration of the town as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, such declaration would be hard to achieve due to the lack of public awareness in the town itself, mindfulness for cultural heritage in the town, and physical and a better legal protection for the caves and its jars.

<text>Patsy Rouzer Keever (born December 20, 1947) is a North Carolina educator and Democratic politician.

==Family and education==
Patsy Rouzer Keever was born and raised in Charlotte, North Carolina. She attended NC public schools and graduated from Duke University with a B.A. in Elementary Education. She started graduate work, earning a master&#x27;s degree in education from Western Carolina University. Keever and her late husband John F. Keever were married for 34 years. They lived in Asheville where they raised two daughters. She has four grandchildren and continues to reside in Asheville, where she lives with her second husband Jim Aycock, former publisher of &quot;Black Mountain News.&quot;

==Teaching career==
Keever was a teacher for over 25 years. For the majority of her career, she taught 8th grade social studies and language arts. She retired from teaching in 2002 to give full-time care to her sick husband, who died from cancer the following year.

Keever served as the president of the local and district chapters of the North Carolina Association of Educators (NCAE).

==Community engagement==
Keever has been active in Asheville and Buncombe County for over 40 years. She has held leadership positions with numerous community organizations, including CarePartners, Buncombe County Library Board of Trustees, Buncombe County Board of Health, United Way, Juvenile Crime Prevention Council, Asheville/Buncombe League of Women Voters, and the Chamber of Commerce Legislative Task Force.

==Political career==
===Buncombe County Board of Commissioners (1992–2004)===
Keever won election to the Buncombe County Board of Commissioners while still teaching full-time. She was elected for three consecutive terms.

===2004 U.S. House campaign===

In 2004, Keever ran for the United States House of Representatives in North Carolina&#x27;s 11th congressional district. She won the Democratic primary with 81% of the vote. However, she lost the hard-fought election by a margin of 55% – 45% to incumbent Republican Charles H. Taylor. Keever&#x27;s campaign received strong support from Democrats in the 11th District and nationally. She also received significant support from national organizations including the National Association for Education, EMILY&#x27;s List, International Union of Police Associations, International Association of Firefighters, and the Sierra Club.

===North Carolina Legislature (2010–2013)===
Keever ran in the 2010 election for the North Carolina House of Representatives in District 115, with the campaign slogan, &quot;putting people first.&quot; She defeated incumbent Bruce Goforth in the May 4 Democratic primary, 60%-40%. After Goforth resigned before the expiration of his term, local Democrats selected Keever to be appointed by the governor to fill the vacancy. In the general election, Keever won a two-year term with 56% of the vote.

Keever served on the following committees: Agriculture, Appropriations, Appropriations Subcommittee on Justice and Public Safety, Environment, Government, and State Personnel.

The North Carolina League of Conservation Voters awarded Keever the 2012 Rising Star award for her work in the legislature.

===2012 U.S. House campaign===

Keever ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in North Carolina&#x27;s 10th congressional district in 2012. She won the Democratic primary in May 2012 with nearly 57.8% of the vote over Asheville Mayor Terry Bellamy (26.5%) and local Timothy Murphy (15.6%). Keever lost the general election to incumbent Patrick McHenry.

===State party leadership===
Keever was elected first vice-chair of the North Carolina Democratic Party in 2013. After incumbent chair Randy Voller declined to run for a second term, Keever was elected party chair in 2015. She declined to run for a second two-year term and was succeeded by Wayne Goodwin.

===State Senate Campaign===
In March 2019, Keever announced her intention to seek the Democratic Party&#x27;s nomination to run against incumbent Republican Chuck Edwards in the 48th district of the North Carolina Senate in the 2020 elections.

<text>Melastomataceae () is a family of dicotyledonous flowering plants found mostly in the tropics (two-thirds of the genera are from the New World tropics) comprising c. 175 genera and c. 5115 known species. Melastomes are annual or perennial herbs, shrubs, or small trees.

==Description==
The leaves of melastomes are somewhat distinctive, being opposite, decussate, and usually with 3-7 longitudinal veins arising either from the base of the blade, plinerved (inner veins diverging above base of blade), or pinnately nerved with three or more pairs of primary veins diverging from the mid-vein at successive points above the base.

Flowers are perfect, and borne either singly or in terminal or axillary, paniculate cymes.

==Ecology==
A number of melastomes are regarded as invasive species once naturalized in tropical and subtropical environments outside their normal range. Examples are Koster&#x27;s curse (&quot;Clidemia hirta&quot;), &quot;Pleroma semidecandrum&quot; and &quot;Miconia calvescens&quot;, but many other species are involved.

==Taxonomy==
Under the APG III system of classification, the seven genera from Memecylaceae are now included in this family.

==Genera==
There are some 167 accepted genera in the Melastomataceae family as of October 2023. They are:

<text>In philately, a Coronation issue is an issue of postage stamps made by the British Post Office and the Post Offices of Commonwealth countries and British dependencies to celebrate the coronation of a new monarch.

These stamps are often considerably more ornate and detailed than definitive issue stamps generated by the same jurisdictions; as such they are greatly favored by many collectors. A particularly favored approach is to attempt to gather all such stamps issued in honor of a particular monarch by all of the jurisdictions issuing them.

As Elizabeth II had been the British monarch for over half a century and hers is to date the last event so commemorated, there are no recent &quot;Coronation issue&quot; stamps as envisioned here. However, other monarchies also issue stamps honouring the accession of a new monarch and these stamps could obviously be defined as &quot;coronation issues&quot; as well.

<text>Wilfred Rowland Childe (26 April 1890 – 10 November 1952) was a British author and poet.

He was born in Wakefield, Yorkshire, the eldest son of Henry Slade Childe, chairman of the Yorkshire Railway Wagon Company Ltd., and Kate France Child.

Childe was educated at Harrow School and Magdalen College, Oxford. He edited &quot;Oxford Poetry&quot; in 1916 and 1917. 

In 1922, Childe became an Assistant Lecturer in English literature at the University of Leeds, being promoted to Lecturer in 1931.

He became a Roman Catholic convert in 1916. 

He is chiefly remembered for &quot;Dream English: A Fantastical Romance&quot; (1917) which was and still is something of a minor cult book. He was admired by Arthur Machen and later by the poet Robin Skelton. His &quot;Selected Poems&quot; was published in 1936. He associated with the Sitwells, but was no modernist.

He died at Harrogate, aged 62. He was eulogised in &quot;The Times&quot; by a friend, who wrote,

&quot;His influence on young poets and his practical, though covert, assistance to them were very great; he was all his life a poet himself with many volumes to his credit- poems full of his own calmness and gentle vision and sincere, contemplative thought, which never claimed to be more than a true expression of his own nature. But to those who knew him and were taught by him, it is the memory of his great kindness, saintly patience, and sweetness of character which will be held most dear.&quot;

<doc id="826946" wikidata="Q3032117" url="?curid=826946" title="Lionel Corporation">
<text>Lionel Corporation was an American toy manufacturer and holding company of retailers that was founded in 1900 and operated for more than 120 years. It started as an electrical novelties company. Lionel specialized in various products throughout its existence. Toy trains and model railroads were its main claim to fame. Lionel trains have been produced since 1900, and their trains were admired by model railroaders around the world for the solidity of their construction and the authenticity of their detail. During its peak years in the 1950s, the company sold $25 million worth of trains per year.

In 1969, the company sold their model train lines to General Mills. It continued to operate until 1993 as a holding company for their toy stores. In 2006, Lionel&#x27;s electric train became the first electric toy inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame. The model trains are still in production as Lionel, LLC.

==History==

The original Lionel Corporation was founded in 1900 by Joshua Lionel Cowen and Harry C. Grant in New York City. The company&#x27;s devotees disagree over the date of incorporation: the official paperwork is dated September 5, but the paperwork was not filed until September 22, more than two weeks later. Initially, the company specialized in electrical novelties, such as fans and lighting devices.

===Pre-World War II era (1900–1942)===
Lionel&#x27;s first train, the Electric Express, was long thought by historians to have been intended for use as a storefront display, rather than for sale to consumers. Delivered in December 1900, it operated on a brass track and was powered by a battery and a motor that Cowen had intended to use for an electric fan. Cowen hoped the public&#x27;s fascination with railroads and electricity would draw attention to his other goods for sale. Instead, the public approached store owners about buying trains, prompting Lionel to begin making toy trains for the general public. Lionel sold 12 examples of the Electric Express.

More recently, &quot;Greenberg&#x27;s Guide to Lionel Trains&quot; (2014) concluded differently: it said that the first Lionel product was the motorized Converse Trolley, with the Electric Express being made to diversify the motor&#x27;s use.

Lionel&#x27;s earliest trains were larger than the sizes commonly available today, running on two-rail tracks with the rails 2 inches apart. In 1906, Lionel began offering a three-rail track that simplified wiring of reverse loops and accessories. Its outer rails were 2 inches apart, which did not match any of the existing standards that other manufacturers had been using since 1891. Whether this was an accidental misreading of Märklin&#x27;s 2 gauge specifications or an intentional incompatibility is unclear.

Lionel marketed the non-standard track as &quot;The Standard of the World,&quot; soon adopted the name in catalogs as Standard Gauge, and trademarked the name. When other U.S. companies began using Lionel&#x27;s standard, they usually called it &quot;wide gauge&quot;. Starting in 1915, Lionel followed most of its U.S. competitors and adopted the smaller O gauge standard for its budget-level trains.

During the pre-Great War era, Lionel competed with Ives Manufacturing Company, Boucher Manufacturing Company, Dorfan, Louis Marx and Company and American Flyer.

By the end of World War I, Lionel was one of three major U.S. toy train manufacturers; the others were American Flyer and Louis Marx and Company. Cowen convinced department stores to incorporate his toy trains in their Christmas displays, linking toy trains to the holiday, and making them popular Christmas presents. Lionel made its trains larger than those of its competitors, making them appear a better value. Competitors criticized the lack of realism of Lionel&#x27;s trains. Cowen had been unwilling to invest in the equipment necessary for lithography, so its early offerings were simply painted in solid colors of enamel paint with brass detail parts. Lionel responded by targeting advertising at children, telling them its products were the most realistic toy trains. Additionally, Lionel criticized the durability of competitors&#x27; products in ads targeted at parents.

By 1922, Lionel was competing mainly against American Flyer and Ives Manufacturing Company . Also in 1922, Boucher bought out Voltamp and started making what was known as the &quot;Rolls-Royce&quot; of standard gauge trains. In 1925, American Flyer jumped into the standard gauge market; and by 1926, Dorfan started making their own standard gauge trains as well.

William Walthers, a large seller of model railroads, asked Cowen in 1929 why Lionel painted its trains in bright and unrealistic colors. Cowen said that the majority of trains were purchased by mothers for their children, and the bright colors attracted women buyers. In 1929, Lionel opened a factory in Hillside, New Jersey, where it produced trains until 1974.

By the 1920s, Lionel had overcome Ives to become &quot;the&quot; market leader, selling metal trains with colorful paint schemes. Lionel&#x27;s fierce ad campaigning took a toll on Ives, which filed bankruptcy in 1928. Lionel and American Flyer bought Ives and operated it jointly until 1930, when Lionel bought Flyer&#x27;s share outright, causing Lionel to operate Ives as a subsidiary until 1932.
The Great Depression badly hurt Lionel and other toy companies. In 1930, Lionel&#x27;s operating profit dropped to $82,000  - its operating profit in 1927 had been more than $500,000  - and in 1931, it lost $207,000. The trains were considered a luxury item. At the height of the Depression, one of Lionel&#x27;s more extravagant locomotives cost as much as a used Ford Model T. In an effort to compete with companies that were willing to undercut Lionel&#x27;s prices, without diluting its premium Lionel and Ives brands, Lionel introduced a line of inexpensive electric toy trains under the &quot;Winner Toys&quot;&#x27; or &quot;Winner Toy Corp.&quot; brand name, which were sold from 1930 to 1932. The starting price for a set, which included a transformer, was $3.25. These and other efforts to improve its financial standing were unable to keep Lionel from going into receivership in May 1934.

The product widely credited with saving the company was a wind-up handcar featuring Mickey and Minnie Mouse, which operated on O gauge track and sold for $1. Lionel manufactured 250,000 units, but was still unable to keep up with demand. But at a wholesale price of .55 cents, the handcar&#x27;s sales did not provide enough profit to pay off Lionel&#x27;s debts of $300,000; however, the model did provide much-needed cash. It was the success of the more expensive but profitable 752E City of Portland Union Pacific Streamliner that gave the company much needed revenue. As Lionel&#x27;s first scale-model, the Streamliner gave the company considerable presence in the model market. It was the start of the company&#x27;s scale-detailed, die-cast look. While numerous equally successful streamliners were issued in the following years, the handcar experiment was not repeated. Lionel left the novelty market to the cheaper toy manufacturers.

Lionel avoided bankruptcy and emerged from receivership the next year. By 1939, Lionel had discontinued its standard gauge products, concentrating instead on the more-affordable (and lucrative) O-gauge and OO gauge, which it had introduced in 1938.

Lionel ceased toy production in 1942 to produce nautical items for the United States Navy during World War II. During this period, Lionel produced ads aimed at American teenagers, to begin planning their post-war layouts. Lionel also introduced the so-called Lionel Wartime Freight Train, a detailed set of cut-and-fold models of Lionel trains printed on cardstock. These were notoriously difficult to put together.

==== Models ====
Lionel made many models, including scale models, of actual trains. The Red Comet and Blue Streak sets included models of New York Central&#x27;s Commodore Vanderbilt locomotive. In 1934, Lionel made a 1:45 scale model of Union Pacific&#x27;s M10000 diesel streamliner (also called the City of Denver) that runs on O gauge track. It was followed by a model of this diesel&#x27;s successor, the City of Portland. The 763E and 700E are 1:48 scale models of 4-6-4 Hudsons. In 1938, Lionel made a model of Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad&#x27;s Burlington Zephyr streamliner called the Flying Yankee.

=== Post-war era (1945–1969) ===

Lionel resumed producing toy trains in late 1945, replacing their original product line with less colorful, but more realistic, trains and concentrating exclusively on O-gauge trains.

Many of Lionel&#x27;s steam locomotives of this period, had a new feature: smoke, produced by dropping a small tablet or a special oil into the locomotive&#x27;s smokestack, which contained an electric heating element. Many diesel, electric, and steam engines made after 1950 had Lionel&#x27;s Magne-Traction, which made the wheels magnetic in order to grip the track better. Lionel&#x27;s most popular toy train ever mass-produced was the Santa Fe F3, numbered 2333, released in 1948.

By 1953, Lionel sales reached their highest level at over $32 million. During the same year, Lionel reportedly became the world&#x27;s largest toy manufacturer. As the 1950s progressed, Lionel sales began to decline in proportion to the growing prevalence of space and military-themed toys and slot car racing sets. These changes coincided with the decline in rail travel as private automobiles proliferated, and the launching of Sputnik, which began the space-race between the United States and Soviet Union. There was an associated military build-up as the Cold War progressed after World War II. The remaining interest in toy and model trains that existed was geared toward HO scale, which gradually overtook O gauge in popularity. It had more realistic detailing and its smaller size enabled the enthusiast to do more modelling within the same amount of space. Lionel attempted to keep pace with changing trends by offering space and military-themed train sets, and introducing their own HO line of trains. But they were never able to reclaim the market share they once held in the toy industry, and by 1958 reported a net loss of $469,057.

Company founder Joshua Cowen officially retired that same year. On September 8, 1965, Cowen died at the age of 88 in Palm Beach, Florida.

Beginning in the 1960s, Lionel attempted to diversify into other product lines, such as phonographs, science, weather station and plastics engineering kits. Toy train sales continued to decline and the company endured a series of management turnovers. In 1967 Lionel purchased American Flyer trains from bankrupt A. C. Gilbert Company, but did not have a new catalog for that year.

In December 1968 Ronald Saypol, Joshua Cowen&#x27;s former grandson-in-law, became President and CEO of the Lionel Corporation, and in the following year, in an attempt to divest the company of what was by then determined to be a cash drain by the board and shareholders, began negotiations to sell their toy train line and lease the Lionel name to Model Products Corporation (MPC), a subsidiary of General Mills, Inc. 1969 was the final year the Lionel Corporation published a toy train catalog and manufactured O gauge trains.

==== Models ====
Lionel started the postwar period in 1945 with a train set introducing remote-control uncoupling. The locomotive was the 224, a pre-war carryover 2-6-2 Prairie type. In 1947, Lionel produced a model of the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s GG1. One year later, Lionel began production of their famous Santa Fe F3. As a direct descendant of the pre-war 763E locomotive, in 1950, Lionel released the 773, another scale Hudson. The Lionel FA model was also introduced in 1950.

Many collectors and operators ranked the 746, released in 1957, as the best postwar Lionel locomotive. It is a model of Norfolk and Western&#x27;s J class steam engine. During both the pre-war and post-war eras, Lionel made many models of electric locomotives; during the post-war era, Lionel made models of the EP-5 and Virginian EL-C, in addition to the GG1. From 1946 through 1949, Lionel issued the 726 2-8-4 Berkshire, which is a prized item today. From 1950 to 1951, Lionel produced the 736 Berkshire, which was basically a 726 with Magne-Traction. In 1952, the Korean war caused a shortage of magnetic materials, so Lionel reissued the 726 as the 726rr (726 rerun). From 1953 until 1968, Lionel produced the 736 again.

====Construction set====
During the post-war period, Lionel produced a construction set, using a unique component set. While competitive sets used nut and bolt fasteners, the Lionel set employed round-head aircraft rivets retained with rubber grommets, eliminating the need for tools. The structural elements were hollow beams of square cross section made from folded and quite thin sheet aluminum. It was subject to destruction if stepped upon. A more substantial folded aluminum base plate was used to form the foundation of most constructions, and additional circular plates could be used to construct larger wheels or pivots. Pulleys, gussets, and splices were also included. The deluxe kits included an electric AC motor with a worm drive and reduction gearset that was powered from household power. While innovative, the lack of general purpose beam members with enough holes limited the adaptability of the set to complex constructions. Finished assemblies also lacked the robust durability of its principal competition at the time, the Erector Set.

====Outsells American Flyer====
During the 1950s, Lionel outsold its closest competitor, American Flyer, by nearly 2:1, peaking in 1953. Some Lionel company histories say Lionel (including more than just trains) was the largest toy company in the world by the early 1950s. Had that been the case, it was a short-lived greatness: Lionel&#x27;s 1955 sales were some $23 million, while rival Marx&#x27;s toy (more than just trains) sales were $50 million.

The 1946–1956 decade was Lionel&#x27;s Golden Age. The Lionel Santa Fe 2333 Diesel locomotive, an EMD F3 in the colorful Santa Fe &quot;Warbonnet&quot; paint scheme that was introduced in 1948, became the Lionel company icon and the icon of the era. The 2343, 2383, and 2353 Santa Fe F3&#x27;s improved on it. Lionel declined rapidly after 1956. Hobbyists preferred the smaller but more realistic HO scale trains, and children&#x27;s interest shifted from toy trains to toy cars. The shift caught Lionel off guard, and in 1957, they hastily introduced a line of HO-scale trains licensed from Rivarossi and a line of slot car racing sets. Neither product line was as popular as its O-gauge trains. Efforts to increase train set profitability and/or sales by cheaper manufacture (largely by replacing castings and folded sheet metal with unpainted injected-molded colored plastic) were largely unsuccessful; 1957 was Lionel&#x27;s last profitable post-war year.

In 1959, Cowen and son sold their interest in the Lionel company and retired. The buyer was Cowen&#x27;s grandnephew, Roy Cohn (businessman and attorney to Senator Joseph McCarthy) who replaced most of Cowen&#x27;s management. The business direction of the Lionel company changed: it added subsidiary companies unrelated to toy train sets — among them were Dale Electronics, Sterling Electric Motors, and Telerad Manufacturing. During Cohn&#x27;s unsuccessful four-year tenure, Lionel lost more than US$13 million.

====Diversification====
As part of the diversification, Lionel formed a relationship with the Porter Chemical Company, whose owner, Harold M. Porter, was a member of the Lionel Board of Directors. Lionel began making a variety of scientifically oriented, hands-on educational toys, designated &quot;Lionel-Porter.&quot; The product line, cataloged from 1961 to 1968, included &quot;Chemcraft&quot; chemistry sets, &quot;Microcraft&quot; microscope sets, &quot;Biocraft&quot; biology sets, and sets teaching about mineralogy, physics, geology, mathematics, and industrial science, along with a junior line of tool sets.

====Decline and bankruptcy====
Lionel&#x27;s efforts to diversify failed to compensate for the public&#x27;s declining interest in its toy trains. By 1966, Lionel&#x27;s revenue was $28 million, 40 percent from government contracts. Meanwhile, Lionel&#x27;s closest competitor also was fading: in January 1967, the parent company of rival American Flyer, the A. C. Gilbert Company, went bankrupt. Lionel bought the &quot;American Flyer&quot; brand name and product line in May of that year in a $150,000 deal; however, Lionel lacked the money to exploit them and filed bankruptcy less than four months later, on August 7, 1967.

In 1969, Lionel&#x27;s sales had declined to just over $1 million per year. Lionel sold the product die tooling for its struggling train line and leased the rights to the &quot;Lionel&quot; brand name to the cereal company General Mills. The Lionel brand name continues today, owned by Lionel, LLC. But many Lionel train enthusiasts consider 1969 the end of the &quot;true Lionel trains&quot;, due to the original Lionel Corporation divesting itself of toy train production and the changes in design and manufacture, sometimes for the worse, that took place under Lionel trains&#x27; new owners.

=== As a holding company (1970–1993) ===
After the Lionel Corporation sold the rights to manufacture trains to General Mills in 1969, the Modern Era began the following year with train products being reproduced and introduced. The Lionel Corporation would continue as a holding company. It invested in various chains of retail stores and electronics companies while receiving royalties on toy train sales made by General Mills (later Lionel Trains, Inc.). In 1991, it sold its trademarks to Lionel Trains, Inc. for $10 million and eventually went out of business in 1993.

==== Lionel MPC (1970–1986) ====
In 1970, after tooling purchased from the Lionel Corporation was moved to a new factory in Mt. Clemens, Michigan, limited production of Lionel trains as a new product line under MPC began. Rolling stock debuted with &quot;fast-angle wheels&quot; with needlepoint bearings. This new wheel design, coupled with the use of Delrin plastic trucks, reduced rolling friction that allowed for longer trains to be run and is still in use by Lionel today. Lionel also began to offer trains in a wider variety of road names and colors and with improved graphics that were not previously available during the postwar period.
In 1971, Lionel debuted a new electronic sound system in their engines, called &quot;Mighty Sound of Steam,&quot; to replace the electro-mechanical air whistles of the pre-war and post-war eras. An internal reorganization in 1973 caused Lionel to become part of General Mills&#x27; Fundimensions group. A new line of scale-sized freight cars, called &quot;Standard O&quot;, was introduced that same year. The new line of trains included the Blue Streak Freight, an entry-level O-27 gauge train set produced by Lionel. The set included a blue Jersey Central Lines steam locomotive with a 2-4-2 wheel configuration and attached tender car. Lionel integrated several features into the locomotive, including a working headlight and a smoke unit. In 1974, Lionel began to offer trains in HO scale for the first time since the postwar period; they were last cataloged in 1966. In 1975, Lionel introduced a 75th anniversary freight set that consisted of their U36B diesel engine and rolling stock that included images of catalog covers and logos from Lionel&#x27;s past. One year later, Lionel released a model of the American Freedom Train to celebrate the nation&#x27;s bicentennial.

The brand rose to prominence in 1976 following a series of television commercials featuring Johnny Cash, who was a longtime Lionel collector.

In 1979, Lionel re-issued the Fairbanks-Morse Train Master diesel locomotive and re-introduced the American Flyer S gauge line of trains, both of which had not been produced since 1966. Starting in the 1980s, Lionel began to issue more postwar-derived operating accessories, such as the Lumber Mill, Ice Depot, and News Stand. In 1984, they released the 783 Hudson locomotive, which descended from the 773 scale-sized Hudson originally made in 1950 and again in the 1960s.

==== Lionel, LLC (1986–present) ====
In 1985, General Mills spun off its Kenner-Parker division, with Lionel being placed under Kenner-Parker. In 1986, Lionel was sold again, this time to toy train collector and real estate developer Richard P. Kughn of Detroit, Michigan; it became Lionel Trains Inc (LTI). In 1989, Lionel phased out the Mighty Sound of Steam and replaced it with what would eventually be called &quot;RailSounds,&quot; beginning with their re-issue of the pre-war B6 Pennsylvania switcher. It was rebranded as Lionel LLC in 1995. Lionel, LLC owns all trademarks and most of the rights associated with the Lionel Corporation.

====Lionel Morsan====
In the early 1970s Lionel bought Morsan Tents from founder Mort Jarashaw. It was a small chain of sporting goods stores based in New Jersey, which became Lionel Morsan.

===Bankruptcy and buyout===
After the sale of its train product lines in 1969, Lionel Corporation became a holding company that specialized in toy stores. By the early 1980s, Lionel operated some 150 stores, under the names Lionel Kiddie City, Lionel Playworld, and Lionel Toy Warehouse. For a time it was the second-largest toy store chain in the United States. Lionel entered financial troubles during the early 1980s recession and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in February 1982. After reducing to 55 stores, it emerged from bankruptcy in September 1985.

By 1991, the chain had regrown to 100 stores and was the fourth-largest toy retailer in the country, but it encountered financial troubles due to a combination of factors. In 1989, Robert I. Toussie L.P., a partnership of several retail executives, attempted to buy the company. Lionel resisted and the fight drained the company of cash. Meanwhile, non-specialty discount stores expanded their toy sections and undercut the prices of specialty toy chains. Additionally, Lionel found it difficult to compete on price with the larger Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, and it attempted to expand too rapidly in a weakened economy. After a string of unprofitable quarters, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on June 14, 1991. In 1992, Lionel again tried to reverse its fortunes by merging with the bankrupt Child World, the United States&#x27; #3 toy retailer, but was unable to secure financing. By February 1993, Lionel had closed all but 29 stores in six states, concentrating on the markets of Philadelphia, central New Jersey, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Cleveland, and south Florida. Unable to reach an agreement for reorganization with its creditors, on June 2, 1993, Lionel announced its intention to liquidate all of its stores and go out of business.

The Lionel trademarks were purchased by Richard Kughn, the Detroit real estate magnate who had bought the Lionel product line from General Mills in 1986. &quot;See Lionel, LLC&quot;.

Lionel trains were manufactured from 1920 to 1929 in a factory at 605 21st Street in Irvington, New Jersey. The factory was destroyed by a fire on April 5, 2004. According to a report from the local fire department, 100 firefighters were needed to extinguish the blaze. The building had been vacant for ten years and was in a state of disrepair, according to Fire Chief Don Huber.

Trains were manufactured from 1929 to 1974 in the Lionel factory at 28 Sager Place in Hillside, New Jersey.
Photos of both New Jersey factories in derelict state prior to their demise can be seen at the ihorse.com Web site.
The building that housed the last Lionel office is located at 26750 23 Mile Road, Chesterfield, Michigan; as of March 31, 2017, the building was available for lease. The former Lionel assembly factory was located at 50625 Richard W. Blvd, Chesterfield — a short drive from the office building.

<text>Data-flow analysis is a technique for gathering information about the possible set of values calculated at various points in a computer program. A program&#x27;s control-flow graph (CFG) is used to determine those parts of a program to which a particular value assigned to a variable might propagate. The information gathered is often used by compilers when optimizing a program. A canonical example of a data-flow analysis is reaching definitions.

A simple way to perform data-flow analysis of programs is to set up data-flow equations for each node of the control-flow graph and solve them by repeatedly calculating the output from the input locally at each node until the whole system stabilizes, i.e., it reaches a fixpoint. This general approach, also known as &quot;Kildall&#x27;s method&quot;, was developed by Gary Kildall while teaching at the Naval Postgraduate School.

== Basic principles ==
Data-flow analysis is the process of collecting information about the way the variables are defined and used in the program. It attempts to obtain particular information at each point in a procedure. Usually, it is enough to obtain this information at the boundaries of basic blocks, since from that it is easy to compute the information at points in the basic block. In forward flow analysis, the exit state of a block is a function of the block&#x27;s entry state. This function is the composition of the effects of the statements in the block. The entry state of a block is a function of the exit states of its predecessors. This yields a set of data-flow equations:

For each block b:

: formula_1
: formula_2

In this, formula_3 is the transfer function of the block formula_4. It works on the entry state formula_5, yielding the exit state formula_6. The join operation formula_7 combines the exit states of the predecessors formula_8 of formula_4, yielding the entry state of formula_4.

After solving this set of equations, the entry and/or exit states of the blocks can be used to derive properties of the program at the block boundaries. The transfer function of each statement separately can be applied to get information at a point inside a basic block.

Each particular type of data-flow analysis has its own specific transfer function and join operation. Some data-flow problems require backward flow analysis. This follows the same plan, except that the transfer function is applied to the exit state yielding the entry state, and the join operation works on the entry states of the successors to yield the exit state.

The entry point (in forward flow) plays an important role: Since it has no predecessors, its entry state is well defined at the start of the analysis. For instance, the set of local variables with known values is empty. If the control-flow graph does not contain cycles (there were no explicit or implicit loops in the procedure) solving the equations is straightforward. The control-flow graph can then be topologically sorted; running in the order of this sort, the entry states can be computed at the start of each block, since all predecessors of that block have already been processed, so their exit states are available. If the control-flow graph does contain cycles, a more advanced algorithm is required.

== An iterative algorithm ==
The most common way of solving the data-flow equations is by using an iterative algorithm. It starts with an approximation of the in-state of each block. The out-states are then computed by applying the transfer functions on the in-states. From these, the in-states are updated by applying the join operations. The latter two steps are repeated until we reach the so-called fixpoint: the situation in which the in-states (and the out-states in consequence) do not change.
A basic algorithm for solving data-flow equations is the round-robin iterative algorithm:
:for &quot;i&quot; ← 1 to &quot;N&quot;
::&quot;initialize node i&quot;
:while (&quot;sets are still changing&quot;)
::for &quot;i&quot; ← 1 to &quot;N&quot;
:::&quot;recompute sets at node i&quot;

=== Convergence ===
To be usable, the iterative approach should actually reach a fixpoint. This can be guaranteed
by imposing constraints on the combination of the value domain of the states, the transfer functions and the join operation.

The value domain should be a partial order with finite height (i.e., there are no infinite ascending chains formula_11 &lt; formula_12 &lt; ...). The combination of the transfer function and the join operation should be monotonic with respect to this partial order. Monotonicity ensures that on each iteration the value will either stay the same or will grow larger, while finite height ensures that it cannot grow indefinitely. Thus we will ultimately reach a situation where T(x) = x for all x, which is the fixpoint.

=== The work list approach ===
It is easy to improve on the algorithm above by noticing that the in-state of a block will not change if the out-states of its predecessors don&#x27;t change. Therefore, we introduce a work list: a list of blocks that still need to be processed. Whenever the out-state of a block changes, we add its successors to the work list. In each iteration, a block is removed from the work list. Its out-state is computed. If the out-state changed, the block&#x27;s successors are added to the work list. For efficiency, a block should not be in the work list more than once.

The algorithm is started by putting information-generating blocks in the work list. It terminates when the
work list is empty.

=== Ordering ===
The efficiency of iteratively solving data-flow equations is influenced by the order at which local nodes are visited. Furthermore, it depends on whether the data-flow equations are used for forward or backward data-flow analysis over the CFG. Intuitively, in a forward flow problem, it would be fastest if all predecessors of a block have been processed before the block itself, since then the iteration will use the latest information. In the absence of loops it is possible to order the blocks in such a way that the correct out-states are computed by processing each block only once.

In the following, a few iteration orders for solving data-flow equations are discussed 
(a related concept to iteration order of a CFG is tree traversal of a
tree).

* Random order - This iteration order is not aware whether the data-flow equations solve a forward or backward data-flow problem. Therefore, the performance is relatively poor compared to specialized iteration orders.
* Postorder - This is a typical iteration order for backward data-flow problems. In &quot;postorder iteration&quot;, a node is visited after all its successor nodes have been visited. Typically, the &quot;postorder iteration&quot; is implemented with the depth-first strategy.
* Reverse postorder - This is a typical iteration order for forward data-flow problems. In reverse-postorder iteration, a node is visited before any of its successor nodes has been visited, except when the successor is reached by a back edge. (Note that reverse postorder is not the same as preorder.)

=== Initialization ===
The initial value of the in-states is important to obtain correct and accurate results. 
If the results are used for compiler optimizations, they should provide conservative information, i.e. when applying the information, the program should not change semantics. 
The iteration of the fixpoint algorithm will take the values in the direction of the maximum element. Initializing all blocks with the maximum element is therefore not useful. At least one block starts in a state with a value less than the maximum. The details depend on the
data-flow problem. If the minimum element represents totally conservative information, the results can be used safely even during the data-flow iteration. If it represents the most accurate information, fixpoint should be reached before the results can be applied.

== Examples ==
The following are examples of properties of computer programs that can be calculated by data-flow analysis.
Note that the properties calculated by data-flow analysis are typically only approximations of the real
properties. This is because data-flow analysis operates on the syntactical structure of the CFG without
simulating the exact control flow of the program.
However, to be still useful in practice, a data-flow analysis algorithm is typically designed to calculate 
an upper respectively lower approximation of the real program properties.

=== Forward analysis ===
The reaching definition analysis calculates for each program point the set of definitions that 
may potentially reach this program point.
 if b == 4 then
 a = 5;
 else 
 a = 3;
 endif
 if a &lt; 4 then

The reaching definition of variable at line 7 is the set of assignments at line 2 and at line 4.

=== Backward analysis ===
The live variable analysis calculates for each program point the variables that may be 
potentially read afterwards before their next write update. The result is typically used by
dead code elimination to remove statements that assign to a variable whose value is not used afterwards.

The in-state of a block is the set of variables that are live at the start of it. It initially contains all variables live (contained) in the block, before the transfer function is applied and the actual contained values are computed. The transfer function of a statement is applied by killing the variables that are written within this block (remove them from the set of live variables). The out-state of a block is the set of variables that are live at the end of the block and is computed by the union of the block&#x27;s successors&#x27; in-states.

Initial code:

 b1: a = 3; 
 b = 5;
 d = 4;
 x = 100;
 if a &gt; b then
 b2: c = a + b;
 d = 2;
 b3: endif
 c = 4;
 return b * d + c;
Backward analysis:

 // in: {}
 b1: a = 3; 
 b = 5;
 d = 4;
 x = 100; //x is never being used later thus not in the out set {a,b,d}
 if a &gt; b then
 // out: {a,b,d} //union of all (in) successors of b1 =&gt; b2: {a,b}, and b3:{b,d} 
 // in: {a,b}
 b2: c = a + b;
 d = 2;
 // out: {b,d}
 // in: {b,d}
 b3: endif
 c = 4;
 return b * d + c;
 // out:{}
The in-state of b3 only contains &quot;b&quot; and &quot;d&quot;, since &quot;c&quot; has been written. The out-state of b1 is the union of the in-states of b2 and b3. The definition of &quot;c&quot; in b2 can be removed, since &quot;c&quot; is not live immediately after the statement.

Solving the data-flow equations starts with initializing all in-states and out-states to the empty set. The work list is initialized by inserting the exit point (b3) in the work list (typical for backward flow). Its computed in-state differs from the previous one, so its predecessors b1 and b2 are inserted and the process continues. The progress is summarized in the table below.

Note that b1 was entered in the list before b2, which forced processing b1 twice (b1 was re-entered as predecessor of b2). Inserting b2 before b1 would have allowed earlier completion.

Initializing with the empty set is an optimistic initialization: all variables start out as dead. Note that the out-states cannot shrink from one iteration to the next, although the out-state can be smaller than the in-state. This can be seen from the fact that after the first iteration the out-state can only change by a change of the in-state. Since the in-state starts as the empty set, it can only grow in further iterations.

== Other approaches ==
Several modern compilers use static single-assignment form as the method for analysis of variable dependencies. 

In 2002, Markus Mohnen described a new method of data-flow analysis that does not require the explicit construction of a data-flow graph, instead relying on abstract interpretation of the program and keeping a working set of program counters. At each conditional branch, both targets are added to the working set. Each path is followed for as many instructions as possible (until end of program or until it has looped with no changes), and then removed from the set and the next program counter retrieved.

A combination of control flow analysis and data flow analysis has shown to be useful and complementary in identifying cohesive source code regions implementing functionalities of a system (e.g., features, requirements or use cases).

== Special classes of problems ==
There are a variety of special classes of dataflow problems which have efficient or general solutions.

=== Bit vector problems ===
The examples above are problems in which the data-flow value is a set, e.g. the set of reaching definitions (Using a bit for a definition position in the program), or the set of live variables. These sets can be represented efficiently as bit vectors, in which each bit represents set membership of one particular element. Using this representation, the join and transfer functions can be implemented as bitwise logical operations. The join operation is typically union or intersection, implemented by bitwise &quot;logical or&quot; and &quot;logical and&quot;.
The transfer function for each block can be decomposed in so-called &quot;gen&quot; and &quot;kill&quot; sets.

As an example, in live-variable analysis, the join operation is union. The &quot;kill&quot; set is the set of variables that are written in a block, whereas the &quot;gen&quot; set is the set of variables that are read without being written first. The data-flow equations become

:formula_13

:formula_14

In logical operations, this reads as

 out(&quot;b&quot;) = 0
 for &quot;s&quot; in succ(&quot;b&quot;)
 out(&quot;b&quot;) = out(&quot;b&quot;) or in(&quot;s&quot;)
 in(&quot;b&quot;) = (out(&quot;b&quot;) and not kill(&quot;b&quot;)) or gen(&quot;b&quot;)

Dataflow problems which have sets of data-flow values which can be represented as bit vectors are called bit vector problems, gen-kill problems, or locally separable problems. Such problems have generic polynomial-time solutions.

In addition to the reaching definitions and live variables problems mentioned above, the following problems are instances of bitvector problems:
* Available expressions
* Very busy expressions
* Use-definition chains

=== IFDS problems ===
Interprocedural, finite, distributive, subset problems or IFDS problems are another class of problem with a generic polynomial-time solution. Solutions to these problems provide context-sensitive and flow-sensitive dataflow analyses.

There are several implementations of IFDS-based dataflow analyses for popular programming languages, e.g. in the Soot and WALA frameworks for Java analysis.

Every bitvector problem is also an IFDS problem, but there are several significant IFDS problems that are not bitvector problems, including truly-live variables and possibly-uninitialized variables.

== Sensitivities ==
Data-flow analysis is typically path-insensitive, though it is possible to define data-flow equations that yield a path-sensitive analysis.

* A flow-sensitive analysis takes into account the order of statements in a program. For example, a flow-insensitive pointer alias analysis may determine &quot;variables &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; may refer to the same location&quot;, while a flow-sensitive analysis may determine &quot;after statement 20, variables &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; may refer to the same location&quot;.
* A path-sensitive analysis computes different pieces of analysis information dependent on the predicates at conditional branch instructions. For instance, if a branch contains a condition , then on the &quot;fall-through&quot; path, the analysis would assume that and on the target of the branch it would assume that indeed holds.
* A context-sensitive analysis is an &quot;interprocedural&quot; analysis that considers the calling context when analyzing the target of a function call. In particular, using context information one can &quot;jump back&quot; to the original call site, whereas without that information, the analysis information has to be propagated back to all possible call sites, potentially losing precision.

<text>A bunk bed or set of bunks
is a type of bed in which one bed frame (a bunk) is stacked on top of another bed, allowing two or more sleeping-places to occupy the floor space usually required by just one. Bunks are commonly seen on ships, in the military, and in hostels, dormitories, summer camps, children&#x27;s bedrooms, and prisons.

Bunk beds are normally supported by four poles or pillars, one at each corner of the bed. A ladder or a flight of stairs leads to the upper bed, which normally features a railing to prevent the sleeper from falling off. Some models also have a privacy curtain for the lower bunk. Because of the need for a ladder and the height of the upper bed, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission recommends using the top bunk of a bunk bed only for persons aged 6 and over.

A [[loft]] bed is an elevated bed similar to a bunk bed, but without the lower beds, freeing floor space for other furniture, such as a desk, which might be built into the loft bed. Low loft-beds are lower to the ground and designed for younger children.

==Types ==
The most common type is the standard bunk bed which has two same size mattresses stacked one directly over the other. A twin over full bunk bed is arranged as a standard except that the bottom mattress is a full size and the upper is a twin size. A full over full bunk bed is otherwise called as the wider bed, which means both top and bottom has the same wider size. They both have a double bed and a total of four people can sleep in it at the same time. A &quot;futon bunk&quot; is also arranged like a standard bunk, except the lower bunk is a Western-style futon couch, which converts into a bed rather than a standard mattress. Futon bunks can be used to save space in small apartments or rooms, because the lower bed converts to a couch for use during the daytime. In an L-shape bunk the bottom bed is oriented at a right angle to the top bed such that when viewed from above the beds form an L. This also creates a small alcove where a desk or bookshelf can be placed.
A loft bed denotes a bunk bed that has only the top bunk, creating an open space underneath that can be occupied by a chest, drawers, or even a work area. This makes loft beds an efficient use of small spaces by utilizing the entire vertical area that would otherwise be left unused. Some loft beds even have stowable/trundle beds while retaining the capability to contain workstations and drawers. Loft beds can be more expensive than bunk beds due to built-in storage capacity and other features.

Other names for a bunk bed are &quot;mezzanine bed&quot;, &quot;(bunk) high sleeper (bed)&quot;, and &quot;loft bunk&quot;.

A triple loft bed is an arrangement involving a total of three bunks. These bunks are a combination of bed types, where a loft bed is perpendicularly attached to a bunk bed to form an L-shape.

The bunk or bunks above the lowest one may have rails to keep the occupant from falling off.

<doc id="826956" wikidata="Q899023" url="?curid=826956" title="Clausius–Mossotti relation">
<text>In electromagnetism, the Clausius–Mossotti relation, named for O. F. Mossotti and Rudolf Clausius, expresses the dielectric constant (relative permittivity, ) of a material in terms of the atomic polarizability, , of the material&#x27;s constituent atoms and/or molecules, or a homogeneous mixture thereof. It is equivalent to the Lorentz–Lorenz equation, which relates the refractive index (rather than the dielectric constant) of a substance to its polarizability. It may be expressed as:

formula_1

where
*formula_2 is the dielectric constant of the material, which for non-magnetic materials is equal to , where is the refractive index;
* is the permittivity of free space;
* is the number density of the molecules (number per cubic meter);
* is the molecular polarizability in SI-units [C·m2/V].

In the case that the material consists of a mixture of two or more species, the right hand side of the above equation would consist of the sum of the molecular polarizability contribution from each species, indexed by in the following form:

formula_3

In the CGS system of units the Clausius–Mossotti relation is typically rewritten to show the molecular polarizability &quot;volume&quot; formula_4 which has units of volume [m3]. Confusion may arise from the practice of using the shorter name &quot;molecular polarizability&quot; for both formula_5 and formula_6 within literature intended for the respective unit system.

The Clausius–Mossotti relation assumes only an induced dipole relevant to its polarizability and is thus inapplicable for substances with a significant permanent dipole. It is applicable to gases such as and at sufficiently low densities and pressures. For example, the Clausius–Mossotti relation is accurate for N2 gas up to 1000 atm between 25 °C and 125 °C. Moreover, the Clausius–Mossotti relation may be applicable to substances if the applied electric field is at a sufficiently high frequencies such that any permanent dipole modes are inactive.

==Lorentz–Lorenz equation==
The Lorentz–Lorenz equation is similar to the Clausius–Mossotti relation, except that it relates the refractive index (rather than the dielectric constant) of a substance to its polarizability. The Lorentz–Lorenz equation is named after the Danish mathematician and scientist Ludvig Lorenz, who published it in 1869, and the Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz, who discovered it independently in 1878.

The most general form of the Lorentz–Lorenz equation is (in Gaussian-CGS units)
:formula_7
where is the refractive index, is the number of molecules per unit volume, and formula_8 is the mean polarizability. 
This equation is approximately valid for homogeneous solids as well as liquids and gases.

When the square of the refractive index is formula_9, as it is for many gases, the equation reduces to:
:formula_10
or simply
:formula_11

This applies to gases at ordinary pressures. The refractive index of the gas can then be expressed in terms of the molar refractivity as:
:formula_12
where is the pressure of the gas, is the universal gas constant, and is the (absolute) temperature, which together determine the number density .

<doc id="826961" wikidata="Q7409173" url="?curid=826961" title="Same-sex marriage in Yukon">
<text>Same-sex marriage has been legal in Yukon since July 14, 2004, immediately following a ruling from the Supreme Court of Yukon. This made the territory the fourth jurisdiction in Canada, and the seventh in the world after the Netherlands, Belgium, Ontario, British Columbia, Quebec and Massachusetts, to legalise same-sex marriage. Yukon was the first of Canada&#x27;s three territories to legalise same-sex marriage, and the only one to do so before the federal legalisation of same-sex marriage in July 2005 by the Parliament of Canada.

==Court ruling==
In July 2003, Justice Minister Elaine Taylor said the government was taking a &quot;wait-and-see&quot; approach to same-sex marriage in Yukon, and would prefer for the Supreme Court of Canada or the Parliament of Canada to settle the issue, &quot;I think it&#x27;s very important to have your ducks lined up, so to speak. The thing that I would hate to see, is that in fact, we did start issuing marriage licenses today or tomorrow, and the bill in fact did not live up to the scrutiny of the Supreme Court of Canada, or perhaps did not even go through the House of Commons. Then there would be somewhat of legal quagmire. We want to bring certainty to those individuals who want to be recognized as same-sex couples. We want to take a responsible position.&quot;

In January 2004, Rob Edge and Stephen Dunbar were denied a marriage licence at the Vital Statistics Office in Whitehorse. &quot;We could have driven across the border to British Columbia, but that wasn&#x27;t good enough. My family and I contributed a lot to this community over the years and I wanted to be married here to the man I love. I&#x27;m a Yukoner. I don&#x27;t want a license that&#x27;s not recognized by my government. I knew my timing was right and that the territory was ready for it&quot;, Dunbar said. The couple brought suit in &quot;Dunbar &amp; Edge v. Yukon (Government of) &amp; Canada (A.G.)&quot; against the Yukon and federal governments in June 2004. Their lawyer, Jim Tucker, used a novel approach: rather than arguing on the basis of Section 15 of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; as in the previous cases, he argued that the federal government&#x27;s failure to appeal the decisions legalising same-sex marriage in Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec signalled a change in Canadian common law regarding marriage. Martha McCarthy, a lawyer who had represented the couples in Ontario and Quebec, said, &quot;Same-sex couples should not have to wait patiently for their rights to be upheld. The federal government accepted not only the Ontario and B.C. court rulings that marriage licenses be issued to same-sex couples, but also the Quebec Court of Appeal&#x27;s ruling that the law has changed across the country. If they accept that in Quebec, how can they now take a different position in the Yukon?&quot;

On July 14, 2004, Supreme Court Justice Peter McIntyre agreed that the federal government was inconsistent in its approach to the definition of marriage, a federal responsibility, since it had not appealed the first three decisions. Therefore, the territory&#x27;s failure to provide marriage licences to same-sex couples meant that the law was being inconsistently applied in Yukon. Justice McIntyre declared same-sex marriages legal in Yukon, and ordered the government to issue a marriage licence to Mr. Edge and Mr. Dunbar. The judge obtained verbal promises from the Yukon Government that the couple would be granted a marriage licence. Premier Dennis Fentie praised the ruling. Laurie Arron, from Egale Canada, said, &quot;This ruling sends a message that governments across the country must now accept the Charter rights of same-sex couples to marry in a civil ceremony. There is one law for the whole country, and that law includes same-sex couples.&quot;

==Territorial legislation==
In May 2002, the Yukon Legislative Assembly approved a bill allowing same-sex couples to adopt children jointly. The law took effect on 1 January 2003. In December 2014, the Assembly amended the territorial &quot;Marriage Act&quot; (; ) to replace references to &quot;husband and wife&quot; with &quot;spouses&quot; and add &quot;or spouse&quot; in section 13. The amendments received royal assent by Commissioner Doug Phillips on 11 December and took effect on 1 June 2015. The Act states:
Further legislation, the &quot;Equality of Spouses Statute Law Amendment Act 2018&quot;, was passed by the Assembly in October 2018. It replaced references to &quot;husband and wife&quot; and &quot;a man and a woman&quot; with gender-neutral language in other acts, including the &quot;Evidence Act&quot; and the &quot;Family Property and Support Act&quot;. The law was assented by Commissioner Angélique Bernard.

==Marriage statistics==
44 same-sex couples married in Yukon between July 2004 and July 2014. The 2016 Canadian census showed that there were 70 same-sex spouses living in Yukon, with 55 (78.6%) being women. The census also showed that about 1.9% of Whitehorse women in couples were in same-sex relationships; the second highest in Canada after Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories. Men in same-sex couples accounted for 0.7% of men in couples.

==Religious performance==
In July 2019, the synod of the Anglican Church of Canada passed a resolution known as &quot;A Word to the Church&quot;, allowing its dioceses to choose whether to bless and perform same-sex marriages. The canons of the Diocese of Yukon do not explicitly prohibit same-sex marriages, and one of the only mentions to marriage defines it as being &quot;between two people&quot;. Former Bishop Larry Robertson, who retired in 2019, was opposed to same-sex marriage.

Some other religious organisations perform same-sex marriages in their places of worship, including the United Church of Canada, Quakers, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada, and the Canadian Unitarian Council.

<doc id="826975" wikidata="Q7889580" url="?curid=826975" title="United States Bicentennial coinage">
<text>The United States Bicentennial coinage is a set of circulating commemorative coins, consisting of a quarter, half dollar and dollar struck by the United States Mint in 1975 and 1976. Regardless of when struck, each coin bears the double date 1776–1976 on the normal obverses for the Washington quarter, Kennedy half dollar and Eisenhower dollar. No coins dated 1975 of any of the three denominations were minted.

Given past abuses in the system, the Mint advocated against the issuance of commemorative coins starting in the 1950s. Beginning in 1971, members of Congress introduced bills to authorize coins to honor the United States Bicentennial, which would occur in 1976. The Mint, through its director, Mary Brooks, initially opposed such proposals, but later supported them, and Congress passed legislation requiring the temporary redesign of the reverse of the quarter, half dollar and dollar.

A nationwide competition resulted in designs of a Colonial drummer for the quarter, Independence Hall for the half dollar and the Liberty Bell superimposed against the Moon for the dollar. All three coins remain common today due to the quantity struck. Circulation pieces were in copper nickel; Congress also mandated 45,000,000 part-silver pieces be struck for collectors. The Mint sold over half of the part-silver coins before melting the remainder after withdrawing them from sale in 1986.

== Background ==
Commemorative coins had been struck for a number of events and anniversaries by the United States Mint since 1892. Organizations would get Congress to authorize a coin and would be allowed to buy up the issue, selling it to the public at a premium. The final issue among these commemoratives, half dollars honoring Booker T. Washington and George Washington Carver were struck over a number of years, and were discontinued in 1954. Originally priced at , they were repeatedly discounted; many could not be sold at a premium and entered circulation. The promoter of these issues, S.J. Phillips, mishandled the distribution and lost . The negative publicity caused the Department of the Treasury, of which the Mint is a part, to oppose subsequent commemorative coin proposals, and until the 1970s, Congress passed none.

In 1966, Congress established the American Revolutionary Bicentennial Commission (ARBC) to plan and coordinate activities connected with the 1976 bicentennial of American Independence (&quot;the Bicentennial&quot;). In February 1970, the ARBC established a Coins and Medals Advisory Committee. The committee&#x27;s initial report, in July 1970, called for the production of a commemorative half dollar for the Bicentennial. In December 1970, the committee called for special designs for all denominations of US coinage for the Bicentennial; the ARBC endorsed this position the following month. The Treasury, however, opposed the change, following its longstanding position against commemorative coins. Several proposals for Bicentennial coins were introduced in Congress in 1971 and 1972, but did not pass.

Mint Director Mary Brooks had attended the Advisory Committee meetings. At one meeting, she supported having a 1776–1976 double date on circulating coins to mark the anniversary in 1976, although accommodating two dates on the obverse would involve production difficulties. However, in a newspaper interview she termed the idea of changing the six circulating coins (cent through dollar) &quot;a disaster&quot;. She felt if any Bicentennial coin was issued, it should be non-circulating, perhaps a half cent or a gold piece. Brooks believed that such a coin would not disrupt the Mint in the production of coins for circulation. During 1972, however, she retreated from that position, and by the end of the year had persuaded Treasury Secretary George Shultz to support a Bicentennial coin bill.

== Authorization ==
In January 1973, Texas Representative Richard C. White introduced legislation for commemorative dollars and half dollars. Oregon Senator Mark Hatfield also put forward a bill, calling for a $25 gold piece. On March 2, 1973, the Treasury announced its support for Bicentennial coin legislation for design changes to the reverses of the circulating dollars and half dollars, and sent proposed legislation to Congress three days later. Hearings before a subcommittee in the House of Representatives were held on May 2, 1973. Brooks testified, supporting the limited redesign in the bill, but opposing a more extensive coin redesign. Separately from the Bicentennial matter, she asked for authority to strike US coins at the West Point Bullion Depository, where space was available to install older coinage presses. Brooks deprecated the Hatfield proposal, stating that the coin would have to be .667 pure or less to avoid hoarding.

As a result of the hearings, several additional bills were introduced, and additional hearings were held before a Senate subcommittee on June 6. Brooks testified again, and responding to criticism that only the two least popular denominations were to be changed, indicated her support for a Bicentennial quarter as well. On June 13, a bill, S. 1141 which provided for a circulating Bicentennial quarter, half dollar and dollar, gave permission for coins to be struck at West Point and allowed for 40% silver clad versions of the new coins for collectors was reported favorably by the Senate Banking Committee. It passed the Senate on July 13. However, amendments authorizing US citizens to own gold, and to implement the Hatfield proposal were attached to the bill. A similar bill passed the House of Representatives on September 12, differing from the Senate bill in lacking any provision relating to gold, and in not authorizing silver versions of the new coins.

Members of the two houses met in a conference committee on September 19 in a session described by onlookers as &quot;fairly hot and heavy&quot;. The resulting bill had no gold provisions, but authorized changes to the reverses of the quarter, half dollar and dollar for the Bicentennial. The obverses of the three coins would not change, but would bear the double date 1776–1976. By the terms of the statute, all coins minted to be issued after July 4, 1975 and before January 1, 1977 would bear the Bicentennial dates and designs. Congress directed the Mint to strike 45,000,000 silver clad coins (that is, 15,000,000 sets), and the Mint received the requested authority to strike coins at West Point. Circulation quarters, half dollars and dollars would continue to be of copper nickel bonded to an internal layer of copper, that is, copper nickel clad. The modified bill passed both houses of Congress on October 4, 1973, and the bill was signed into law by President Richard Nixon on October 18. Hatfield&#x27;s measure, along with similar legislation from other senators, was reintroduced in 1975, but died in committee, as did legislation seeking a Bicentennial two-cent piece and a bill seeking a coin honoring Abigail Adams and Susan B. Anthony. The extra production at West Point was key to overcoming a shortage of cents in 1974, and permitted the Mint greater flexibility as it geared up to strike the Bicentennial pieces.

== Competition ==
On October 23, 1973, the Department of the Treasury announced a competition for the three reverse designs. Any US citizen could submit one drawing, or photograph of a plaster model in diameter. As required by law, submissions were to include the legends , and the respective denomination , and . Treasury Secretary Shultz, advised by a panel of judges, would decide which design would be used for each denomination.

At Director Brooks&#x27; request, the National Sculpture Society selected the five judges for the competition. The judges were society President Robert Weinman (son of Adolph Weinman, who had designed the Mercury dime and Walking Liberty half dollar), Connecticut sculptor Adlai S. Hardin, former Mint Chief Engraver Gilroy Roberts, Julius Lauth of the Medallic Art Company, and Elvira Clain-Stefanelli, curator in the Division of Numismatics, Smithsonian Institution.

The deadline was originally December 14, 1973, but was extended to January 9, 1974 because of the energy crisis and Christmas mail delays. Brooks traveled more than to publicize the competition. By the deadline, the Mint had received 15,000 inquiries and 884 entries. Members of the panel and any person employed by the US government as a sculptor were ineligible to enter. The prize for each of the three winners was $5,000. The judging was originally supposed to take place at West Point; with the delay, it took place instead at the Philadelphia Mint.

From the entries, the judges selected twelve semifinalist designs; the sculptor submitting each received a prize of $750. The competitors were to place their work on plaster models, if that had not already been done, and were offered assistance in making the models.

== Preparation ==
The twelve remaining designs were released by the Treasury for public comment in early 1974. Two of the proposed coins featured sailing ships, two featured Independence Hall in Philadelphia, where the Declaration of Independence was signed, and three depicted the moon or lunar spacecraft. Another depicted the Liberty Bell superimposed on an atomic symbol. According to numismatist Michael Marotta in his 2001 article on the Bicentennial coins, &quot;the numismatic community&#x27;s reaction to the entries was predictable: everyone complained by writing letters to the editor&quot;.

From the twelve, the judges selected six finalists for review by the National Bicentennial Coin Design Competition Committee, consisting of Brooks, Representative Wright Patman, Senator John Sparkman, Commission of Fine Arts Secretary Charles H. Atherton and Eric P. Newman, chairman of the ARBC&#x27;s coins and medals advisory committee. After receiving the committee&#x27;s recommendations, Secretary Shultz selected the winners and on March 6, 1974, Brooks went on the &quot;Today&quot; show to announce them. Jack L. Ahr&#x27;s design featuring a colonial drummer, with a torch of victory surrounded by thirteen stars (representing the original states) was selected for the quarter. Seth Huntington&#x27;s image of Independence Hall was selected for the half dollar while Dennis R. Williams&#x27; superimposition of the Liberty Bell against the Moon was chosen for the dollar. Ahr owned a commercial art firm and Huntington was head artist for Brown and Bigelow, a Minneapolis publishing firm. Williams, at age 21 the youngest person to design a US coin, was an art student who had originally created his design for a class assignment. No change would be made to the obverses of the coins, except for the double dating.

Ahr was accused of copying his drummer from a 1973 stamp by the stamp&#x27;s designer, William A. Smith; he denied it. According to numismatic historian Walter Breen, &quot;both obviously derive from Archibald Willard&#x27;s 1876 painting &quot;Spirit of &#x27;76&quot;,&quot; a painting which numismatic author David L. Ganz suggests that both undoubtedly saw sometime in their lives. Ahr, however, stated that his son had been the model for the drummer. Brooks, in a letter to Smith, stated that the design for the quarter was &quot;sufficiently original&quot; to impress the National Sculpture Society. Weinman later deprecated the winning designs:
I really don&#x27;t think what we got was a great bargain. Nothing we selected was a real winner that I&#x27;d fight to the death for. In terms of what we had to work with, though, I think we did the best we could.
On April 24, 1974, the three winning designers were brought to Washington, D.C. After a tour of the White House and meetings with the congressional committees which considered the coin bills, they went to the Treasury Building and received their $5,000 checks from the new Treasury Secretary, William E. Simon, who jokingly asked them if they wanted to invest their awards in savings bonds.

Mint Chief Engraver Frank Gasparro made minor changes to all three reverse designs. Gasparro simplified the quarter design, altered the drum for the sake of authenticity, changed the lettering and modified the expression on the drummer&#x27;s face. He made slight changes to Independence Hall on the half dollar and altered the lettering on the dollar to facilitate the metal flow during stamping and asked the designer to straighten the bottom edge of the Liberty Bell. Ahr later stated that he would have liked more time to finalize his design, wishing to clarify the features of the drummer&#x27;s face. The initials of the designer were added to the design by the Mint. All three agreed that Gasparro&#x27;s changes improved their designs.

== Production ==

On August 12, 1974, the three designers were at the Philadelphia Mint, where they ceremonially operated the presses to strike the first coins bearing their designs. These prototypes were exhibited under armed guard at the American Numismatic Association convention in Florida the next day. They differ from all other Bicentennial coins in that they were struck in silver proof without mint mark; other silver proof coins bear an &quot;S&quot; mint mark as struck at the San Francisco Assay Office (as the San Francisco Mint was then known). Coins struck at Denver bear a &quot;D&quot; on the obverse; pieces lacking a mint mark were struck at Philadelphia. Sets of these prototypes were presented to President Gerald Ford, Counselor to the President Anne Armstrong and Director John Warner of the American Revolutionary Bicentennial Administration (the successor to the ARBC). All other first strikes were melted, with copies not even kept for the National Numismatic Collection.

The Mint believed that if it was required to strike 1975 quarters, half dollars and dollars, not enough could be struck before it had to begin the Bicentennial issues to prevent the 1975 pieces from becoming collector&#x27;s items. This risked coin shortages at a time when the Mint was seeking to build a surplus of quarters. Mint officials returned to Congress to seek amending legislation. President Ford signed a bill on December 26, 1974 that made several noncontroversial changes to law, including provisions to allow the Mint to keep striking 1974-dated pieces until it began striking the Bicentennial coins. By terms of the amending legislation, the commemorative coins could not be issued until after July 4, 1975.

On November 15, 1974, the Mint began taking orders for the silver clad pieces, at a price of for proof sets and for uncirculated, with a deadline for orders of January 31, 1975. Uncirculated coins are like those newly released into circulation; proof coins have a mirror finish. Buyers were initially limited to five sets per person. On January 19, 1975, Brooks announced that the silver proof set price was cut to , and the order limit was waived. Buyers who had paid the higher price were sent refunds by check. Brooks stated that the price reduction was because of production efficiencies, the benefit of which she wished to pass along to the public. Numismatic columnist Ed Reiter noted, though, that the reduction came amidst protests from the numismatic community that the price was too high. Coin dealer Herby Skelton suggested in 1977 that the initial high price for the sets followed by the reduction, together with the large mintage of silver sets made the public suspicious and contributed to lagging sales. On August 20, 1975, the price for the uncirculated silver sets was reduced to when bulk purchases of 50 or more were made. A bank in Taiwan ordered 250,000 sets at this price.

The first Bicentennial coins to be produced that were intended for the public were dollars, struck during February 1975. The first for collectors were struck at San Francisco on April 23, 1975. The San Francisco Assay Office struck the 45,000,000 silver coins first, producing eleven million sets in uncirculated and four million in proof, then began the base metal pieces. Once striking began, the Mint found that the copper nickel dollar was striking indistinctly, a problem not seen with the silver pieces. The Mint modified the dies; the most noticeable change is that the revised issue, or Type II as it came to be known, have narrower, sharper lettering on the reverse. All silver pieces (struck only at San Francisco) are Type I; all three mints struck both Type I and Type II copper nickel pieces. All dollars included in 1975 proof sets are Type I; all those included in 1976 proof sets are Type II. Bicentennial coins for collectors were not delivered until after July 4, 1975. The Bicentennial pieces, in base metal, were included in 1975 proof sets and mint sets together with 1975-dated cents, nickels and dimes.

The new coins first entered circulation on July 7, 1975, when the half dollar was released in conjunction with ceremonies in Minneapolis, Huntington&#x27;s hometown. The quarter followed in September and the dollar in October, each also with ceremonies to mark the issuance. The pieces were struck in numbers exceeding those needed for circulation; a Mint spokesman stated, &quot;The theory in striking them was to have enough available so as many Americans as possible would have an opportunity to have a coinage commemoration of the Bicentennial year. They&#x27;re mementos.&quot;

In 1977, the Mint returned to the old reverse designs for the quarter, half dollar and dollar. Sales by mid-1977 had dropped off considerably, to perhaps 300 sets a week, with one Mint official describing the sales against the massive unsold quantities as &quot;a drop in the bucket&quot;. By 1979, the Mint anticipated an eventual sellout for the silver proof set, but admitted that with massive quantities unsold, there was no realistic possibility of selling all uncirculated silver sets. On September 17, 1979, faced with a spike in silver prices, Mint Director Stella B. Hackel announced that the sets were being removed from sale. They were returned to sale in August 1980, at increased prices of in proof and in uncirculated. In September 1981, the Mint, citing a decline in the price of silver, reduced the price of the sets to in proof and in uncirculated. A limit of 100 sets per person was set on proof sales, with none on uncirculated. A large number of sets were melted by the government in 1982. Reagan administration Mint Director Donna Pope later stated,
&quot;Sales of 1776–1976 regular-issue Bicentennial coins went on and on, seemingly forever.&quot; On December 31, 1986, the remaining Bicentennial uncirculated silver sets were removed from sale. At the time, it was announced that proof sets had already sold out when coins went off sale. However, Marotta, writing in 2001, stated that when sales ceased, 400,000 proof sets and 200,000 uncirculated sets remained in inventory.

Due to the large quantities struck, Bicentennial coins remain inexpensive. A set of three silver coins contains of the precious metal. In a 1996 statistical study, T.V. Buttrey found that about 750,000,000 of the circulation quarters, more than a third, had been hoarded and did not circulate. Coin dealer Marcel Sassola suggested in 1977 of the silver sets, &quot;There were just too many sold, and I think it will take a long time before they have any real value. Maybe by the Tricentennial.&quot;

<doc id="826979" wikidata="Q3396296" url="?curid=826979" title="Beinn Eighe">
<text>is a mountain massif in the Torridon area of Wester Ross in the Northwest Highlands of Scotland. Lying south of Loch Maree, it forms a long ridge with many spurs and summits, two of which are classified as Munros: Ruadh-stac Mòr at and Spidean Coire nan Clach at . Unlike most other hills in the area it has a cap of Cambrian basal quartzite which gives the peaks of Beinn Eighe a distinctive light colour. Its complex topography has made it popular with both hillwalkers and climbers and the national nature reserve on its northern side makes it an accessible mountain for all visitors.

== Geography ==

Located between Loch Maree and Glen Torridon on the west coast of Scotland, Beinn Eighe is a complex mountain. The main ridge runs on a line extending from close to the village of Kinlochewe in the north-east to the narrow glen of the Coire Dubh Mòr, which separates it from the neighbouring mountain of Liathach to the south-west. The slopes into Glen Torridon on the south side are steep with few features and are covered in white quartzite screes. On the north side are four large corries between which are spurs extending out from the main ridge. The southern and eastern sides of the mountain are flanked by the A896 and A832 roads, however the area to the northwest is largely unpopulated, comprising the mountainous landscape of the Torridon Hills and the Flowerdale Forest.

The eastern half of Beinn Eighe is owned by NatureScot, who manage it as a national nature reserve, whilst the rest of the southern side is owned by the National Trust for Scotland: this area is also managed as part of the reserve. The remaining northwestern part of Beinn Eighe lies within the Grudie &amp; Talladale Estate.

Two of Beinn Eighe&#x27;s summits are classified as Munros. The highest point Beinn Eighe, Ruadh-stac Mòr (&#x27;Big Red Stack&#x27; in Scottish Gaelic), lies on one of the spurs off the main ridge and stands at a height of . Spidean Coire nan Clach (&#x27;Peak of the Corrie of Stones&#x27; in Scottish Gaelic), which was added to the list of Munros in 1997 to become the second Munro on Beinn Eighe, is the highest point on the main ridge itself. It stands at a height of and commands an extensive view over both Glen Torridon and the rest of the Beinn Eighe massif. Ruadh-stac Beag (), which lies on a spur from the main ridge east of Ruadh-stac Mòr, has sufficient relative height to be classified as a Corbett.

One of the most famous features of Beinn Eighe is the corrie of Coire Mhic Fhearchair, often simply known as the &quot;Triple Buttress Corrie&quot; after the three large rock features which dominate the view from the north. There are many rock climbs on the buttresses and hillwalkers can access the tops of the buttresses from the head of the corrie.

==Geology==
In common with much of the Northwest Highlands, the underlying rocks of the area are composed of Lewisian gneiss, a very ancient rock type. The younger Precambrian Torridonian Sandstone, which sits on top of the gneiss, forms the bulk of all of the Torridon Hills, including Beinn Eighe, and was formed around 800 million years ago from the sediment of rivers that flowed across the landscape of the gneiss. Beinn Eighe is however unusual amongst the Torridon Hills in that the summit ridge is composed of white-coloured Cambrian basal quartzite. This is a very hard but brittle rock, that was laid down around 540 million years ago as pure white sands during a period when the area was flooded by warm tropical seas. The quartzite gives Beinn Eighe its familiar light coloured summits, which form a notable contrast to the other peaks in the area, and can appear similar to a covering of snow on the mountain. Within the Cambrian rocks a distinct rock layer, known as the Fucoid Beds, has been identified. The fossils found in the Fucoid Beds are very different to those from rocks of a similar age found in England, a fact that was crucial in establishing that during the Cambrian period the two land masses were separated by ocean. These fossils, which include trilobites, and worm burrows, are some of the oldest fossils to be found in Scotland. The fossil of one creature identified in the rocks of Beinn Eighe, &quot;Olenellus armatus&quot;, has not been found at any other location.

The area was heavily sculpted by glaciers during successive ice ages.

==Flora and fauna==

Many rare plants, including two variants of dwarf shrub heath and a western variant of moss heath, are to be found at Beinn Eighe. In total 680 different species of plants have been identified, including the greatest variety of oceanic mosses and liverworts of any single site in Britain. The summit plateau is the only location in Britain at which the liverwort &quot;Herbertus borealis&quot; (northern prongwort) has been found; whilst Beinn Eighe is also the most northerly known global location at which the moss species &quot;Daltonia splachnoides&quot; has been identified. Other rare plant species found include tufted saxifrage and brook saxifrage.

In total 235 ha of the Beinn Eighe National Nature Reserve are covered in ancient woodlands, which grows in areas between 12 and 300 metres above sea level, and the woodland at Coille na Glas Leitir on the northern side of the mountain is the largest fragment of ancient Caledonian pinewood remaining in north-west Scotland. The Scots pine in this area show genetic differences to those in eastern parts of Scotland, and are more similar to those growing in southern Europe. It is thought that this results from the fact that western Scotland became ice-free first at the end of the last ice-age, allowing pine to move north along the western fringe of Europe. Pines reached Eastern Scotland from more northerly areas during a later period, as the ice sheets retreated further. In March 2019 a &quot;genetic reserve&quot; was established at Beinn Eighe as part of the European Forest Genetic Resources Programme in order to coordinate investigation and protection of the unique DNA fingerprint of the area&#x27;s pines.

Bird species observed at Beinn Eighe include golden eagles, Scottish crossbills, bramblings, ring ouzels, golden plovers, skylarks, redwings and divers. The reserve is home to mammal species including red deer, mountain hare and pine martens, although the Scottish wildcat has not been observed for many years. Otters breed along the shores of Loch Maree, and have been sighted on burns and lochans up to 400 m above sea level.

== Ascents ==

Beinn Eighe&#x27;s complex topography offers both hillwalkers and climbers a wide variety of routes, climbs and traverses. For the hillwalker a popular route is the western traverse which includes both of the Munro summits and Coire Mhic Fhearchair. A full traverse of Beinn Eighe includes navigating a series of pinnacles known as the Black Carls, which provide good scrambling and are located at the eastern end of the main ridge. Approached from the east the Black Carls are a popular climb in their own right.

The cartographer Timothy Pont visited the Loch Maree area when producing his series of maps of Scotland in the late sixteenth century, including a sketch of Coire Mhic Fhearchair on his maps, however there is little evidence of any recorded visits to the summits of Beinn Eighe prior to the nineteenth century. The earliest recorded ascent appears to have been during surveying of the boundary between the Gairloch and Torridon Estates, which surveyor George Campbell Smith was required to determine and delineate in 1851.

==Air crash==

The Triple Buttress Corrie was the scene of an aviation tragedy on the night of 13–14 March 1951. An Avro Lancaster crashed about 5 m below the crest of the summit ridge in a gully now known as Fuselage Gulley (or Far West Gulley) above Loch Coire Mhic Fhearchair. The aircraft, which was part of 120 Squadron, had taken off from RAF Kinloss around 6 pm for a maritime reconnaissance mission in the vicinity of Rockall and the Faroe Isles, and was due back at around 2:30 am. During the return journey the weather conditions were poor, with freezing temperatures and a strong north-easterly wind.

Although experienced local mountaineers offered to assist, the RAF initially determined that the search would be handled by their own search teams. It was not until 16 March (two days after the crash) that the location of the crash was identified, from an Airspeed Oxford taking part in the search. The search had been directed to the Beinn Eighe area as a result of reports from local witnesses, who had seen a red flash over the mountain. The RAF rescue teams arrived at the foot of the mountain on 17 March but despite several attempts were unable to reach the crash site due to the mountainous terrain and adverse winter weather conditions. Finally, two Royal Marine commandos reached the crash site. It was not until nearly 6 months after the incident that the bodies of the crew were finally recovered.

The length of time taken to complete the recovery operation was a key factor in the introduction of formal training courses for the RAF Mountain Rescue Teams; prior to this MRS teams were neither adequately trained nor equipped to undertake recovery operations in such extreme mountainous areas. It also led to the creation of an Air Ministry post of Inspector of Land Rescue (ILR). Similarly, the involvement of local gamekeepers and gillies in removing the bodies was instrumental in the formation of the Kinlochewe and Torridon Mountain Rescue Team.

The eight crew members who died in the incident were:

*Fl/Lt Harry Smith Reid DFC (29), Pilot, RAF.
*Sgt Ralph Clucas (23), Co-Pilot, RAF.
*Flt Lt Robert Strong (27), Navigator, RAF.
*Fl/Lt Peter Tennison (26), Air Signals, RAF.
*Sgt James Naismith (28), Air Signals, RAF.
*Sgt Wilfred D Beck (19), Air Signals, RAF.
*Sgt James W Bell (25), Air Signals, RAF.
*Sgt George Farquhar (29), Flight Engineer, RAF.

== Beinn Eighe National Nature Reserve ==

The Beinn Eighe National Nature Reserve covers 4758 hectares, including open moorland, woodland and bogs. It was established in 1951 by Dr John Berry in his role as Director of Nature Conservancy in Scotland, and was the first such area in Great Britain. In 2014 the Beinn Eighe NNR was merged with the neighbouring Loch Maree Islands NNR, which covers over 60 islands in Loch Maree to be managed as a single &quot;Beinn Eighe and Loch Maree Islands NNR&quot;, although the two reserves are still formally designated separately. Most of the Beinn Eighe reserve is owned by NatureScot, although an area of 577 ha on the western side belongs to the National Trust for Scotland. NatureScot provides a visitor centre at Aultroy, just over a kilometre northwest of Kinlochewe. From the visitor centre there are several marked trails through woodland on the lower slopes of Beinn Eighe, as well as picnic areas and viewpoints. Further to west, NatureScot have constructed two further routes: the 1.5 km-long Woodland Trail passes through the pinewood of the Coille na Glas Leitir, whilst the 6.5 km-long Mountain Trail climbs to the &#x27;Conservation Cairn&#x27; at &quot;c.&quot; which offers extensive views of the surrounding landscape including Loch Maree and the nearby mountain Slioch. NatureScot also provides a field station with full laboratory facilities for up to fourteen people which is used by scientists and researchers to co-ordinate field data recording and as a base for undergraduate fieldwork. A tree nursery lies alongside the field station; trees are raised from local stock for planting on the reserve in order to expand the amount of woodland.

The Beinn Eighe and Loch Maree Islands NNR forms part of the UNESCO Wester Ross Biosphere reserve, and also lies within the Wester Ross national scenic area. The NNR is classified as a Category II protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The reserve is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), and forms part of the Loch Maree Complex Special Area of Conservation (SAC), a European site of international significance, with the Caledonian pinewood, the rich mosaic of upland habitats and the otter population all forming part of the qualifying interests of the SAC designation. The Loch Maree Islands portion of the reserve also forms part of the Loch Maree Special Protection Area (SPA), which hosts the single most important breeding population of black-throated diver in Britain.

<text>All Jammu &amp; Kashmir Patriotic Peoples Front, a state political party in Jammu and Kashmir. The group is a pro-Indian faction, linked to the so-called counter-insurgent or paramilitary forces. Their origins lie in the Muslim Mujahedin group (itself a splinter group from Hizbul Mujahideen). The Muslim Mujahedin group was a former islamist guerrilla group that turned themselves in to the government in 1995 and developed cooperation with the Indian army. During 1997–1998, the forces of the Muslim Mujahedin group were demobilized, and the remaining members reorganized as The Patriotic Peoples Front.

After 1997, the PPF supported Farooq Abdullah&#x27;s Jammu &amp; Kashmir National Conference government in Kashmir.

In the Lok Sabha elections of 1999, the leader of PPF, Ghulam Nabi Mir, was a candidate in the constituency of Anantnag district. He received 1,500 votes, or 1.46% of the total. Ghulam Nabi Mir was shot to death outside his residence by Hizbul Mujahideen militants on 16 June 2001. He had previously escaped a similar attack in 2000.

The PPF does not currently have any seats in the assembly of Jammu and Kashmir.

<text>Pikit, officially the Municipality of Pikit (Maguindanaon: &quot;Inged nu Pikit&quot;, Jawi: ايڠد نو ڤيكت; Hiligaynon: &quot;Banwa sang Pikit&quot;; Cebuano: &quot;Lungsod sa Pikit&quot;; Tagalog: &quot;Bayan ng Pikit&quot;) is a municipality in the province of Cotabato, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 67,024 people.

==History==
Pikit was the oldest settlement ever founded in Cotabato province. The landmark which eventually became the town&#x27;s namesake, Fort Pikit, was established in 1893 by the Spaniards who have by then just recently conquered what is now the province of Cotabato from the Sultanate of Maguindanao. The name &quot;Pikit&quot; was given to the place by the Spaniards. It was formerly called by the natives &quot;Malasiquit&quot; because it was situated within the shadows of hills situated to each other. The fort was built to consolidate their hold in the region.

The Spaniards abandoned Fort Pikit at the end of the 19th century, which paved the way for the eventual American occupation in 1902.

Under the Osmeña Colony Act of 1912, Pikit was founded on June 17, 1913, by the first Christian Filipino colonists from the Province of Cebu. About one hundred twenty Cebuanos came under the Colony Agent, Vicente Lozada. The first batch of colonists from Cebu arrived at Fort Pikit after two days of sailing on board a river boat called &quot;Hall&quot;, followed the Rio Grande de Mindanao.

The Rio Grande where the colonists landed is now a corn field. It became dry land due to the cut-off river found in Kulanguan, Tunggol, Pagalungan, Maguindanao.

The first batch of colonists were distributed at Ladtingan, Calawag, Ginatilan, Panicupan, Manding and Inug-ug. They belonged to Colony No. 1, while other colonists followed in 1914 up to 1915 and they were assigned in the following colonies, Colony No. 2 (Paidu Pulangi) Colony no. 3 (Silik) Colony No. 4 (Makasendeg) Colony No. 5 (Pagalungan) and Colony No.7 (Talitay).

Those who came in 1918 from the Visayas and Luzon were called homeseekers, immigrants, and settlers because the government did not give them anymore free transportation and ration in their coming.

During the Colony days the Colonies had a special government under the administration of the Colony Superintendent; Mr. Maximo Abad was then appointed. Mr. Miguel Jacosalem, Asst. Supt. for Colony No. 3, Datu Abdula Piang, Asst. Supt. for Colony No. 3, Mr. Tuan Afdal, Asst. Supt. for Colony No. 4, Mr. Ruperto Gemarino, Asst. Supt. for Colony No. 5 and Mr. Primo Curo, Astt. Supt. for Colony No. 7.

Schools were opened in the Colonies. The first school opened was Ladtingan which James E. McCall was assigned as Supervisor. The first teachers were Frucosa Lucero and Ponciana Lucero.

In 1924, the colonists began to fight for the townsite and local autonomy, for the creation of Pikit into a regular municipality.

In 1928, the Colony Administration was turned over to the Bureau of Lands. Pikit was created a Municipal District, including the new municipality of Pagalungan.

In 1935, the construction of the Cotabato-Davao national Highway helped enhance the progress of this town. This road passes through the heart of Pikit. It afforded a faster and more convenient means of transportation and shipment of farm products.

In the early part of 1947 this Municipal District was created into a regular municipality, as the Municipality of Pagalungan and Pikit as a barrio, Mr. Gorgonio P. Initan was the first appointed mayor who was also the first elected mayor because this year was also the election of the municipal officials. The seat of Government was in Pagalungan.

On May 9, 1948, the Barrio Planning Personnel accompanied by Atty. Sergio F. Tocao, came to Pikit. This marked the triumph of the colonists for the establishment of Manding as a townsite.

In September 29, 1949, Pikit was created a regular municipality by Executive Proclamation with Manding as the seat of the municipal government. This ended the struggle of the colonists and marked the fulfillment of their aspirations. Pikit was created out of the municipality of Pagalungan.

Pikit was proclaimed into a regular municipality thru the efforts of then Congressman Gumbay Piang and Governor Duma Sinsuat by virtue of Executive Order No. 270 with its townsite at Manding.

The territory was reduced when, through &quot;Batas Pambansa Blg. 206&quot; of 1982, 19 &quot;barangays&quot; were separated to create the municipality of Aleosan.

The so-called Pikit War between Muslim separatists and the Philippines army took place there in early 2003.

===Partial inclusion to the Bangsamoro===
In 2019, twenty-two &quot;barangays&quot; were among the 63 in the province which became part of the Special Geographic Area of the newly created Bangsamoro, after having the affirmative vote won to join the autonomous region in a plebiscite held on February 6. Ten of these, with Balatican, were among the 39 &quot;barangays&quot; in the province that unsuccessfully voted for the inclusion in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao in 2001; the other twelve petitioned to be part of the Bangsamoro, which replaced ARMM by virtue of &quot;Republic Act No. 11054&quot;.

In 2023, the Bangsamoro Parliament approved the creation of eight new municipalities in the area. Those &quot;barangays&quot; became part of municipalities of Malidegao (&quot;Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 46&quot;) and Ligawasan (&quot;BAA No. 48&quot;)—which will be composed of seven in each, and Tugunan (&quot;BAA No. 47&quot;)—to be composed of eight along with Tapodoc in Aleosan; following ratification in a plebiscite on April 13, 2024.

==Geography==
The municipality is bounded on the north by the Municipality of Aleosan, on the south by Pagalungan, Maguindanao, on the west by the Municipality of Midsayap and the Liguasan marsh and on the east by the Municipality of Datu Montawal.

<text>In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the &quot;outcome&quot; or &quot;response&quot; variable, or a &quot;label&quot; in machine learning parlance) and one or more error-free independent variables (often called &quot;regressors&quot;, &quot;predictors&quot;, &quot;covariates&quot;, &quot;explanatory variables&quot; or &quot;features&quot;).

The most common form of regression analysis is linear regression, in which one finds the line (or a more complex linear combination) that most closely fits the data according to a specific mathematical criterion. For example, the method of ordinary least squares computes the unique line (or hyperplane) that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the true data and that line (or hyperplane). For specific mathematical reasons (see linear regression), this allows the researcher to estimate the conditional expectation (or population average value) of the dependent variable when the independent variables take on a given set of values. Less common forms of regression use slightly different procedures to estimate alternative location parameters (e.g., quantile regression or Necessary Condition Analysis) or estimate the conditional expectation across a broader collection of non-linear models (e.g., nonparametric regression).

Regression analysis is primarily used for two conceptually distinct purposes. First, regression analysis is widely used for prediction and forecasting, where its use has substantial overlap with the field of machine learning. Second, in some situations regression analysis can be used to infer causal relationships between the independent and dependent variables. Importantly, regressions by themselves only reveal relationships between a dependent variable and a collection of independent variables in a fixed dataset. To use regressions for prediction or to infer causal relationships, respectively, a researcher must carefully justify why existing relationships have predictive power for a new context or why a relationship between two variables has a causal interpretation. The latter is especially important when researchers hope to estimate causal relationships using observational data.

==History==
The earliest regression form was seen in Isaac Newton&#x27;s work in 1700 while studying equinoxes, being credited with introducing &quot;an embryonic linear aggression analysis&quot; as &quot;Not only did he perform the averaging of a set of data, 50 years before Tobias Mayer, but summing the residuals to zero he &quot;forced&quot; the regression line to pass through the average point. He also distinguished between two inhomogeneous sets of data and might have thought of an &quot;optimal&quot; solution in terms of bias, though not in terms of effectiveness.&quot; He previously used an averaging method in his 1671 work on Newton&#x27;s rings, which was unprecedented at the time. 

The method of least squares was published by Legendre in 1805, and by Gauss in 1809. Legendre and Gauss both applied the method to the problem of determining, from astronomical observations, the orbits of bodies about the Sun (mostly comets, but also later the then newly discovered minor planets). Gauss published a further development of the theory of least squares in 1821, including a version of the Gauss–Markov theorem.

The term &quot;regression&quot; was coined by Francis Galton in the 19th century to describe a biological phenomenon. The phenomenon was that the heights of descendants of tall ancestors tend to regress down towards a normal average (a phenomenon also known as regression toward the mean).
For Galton, regression had only this biological meaning, but his work was later extended by Udny Yule and Karl Pearson to a more general statistical context. In the work of Yule and Pearson, the joint distribution of the response and explanatory variables is assumed to be Gaussian. This assumption was weakened by R.A. Fisher in his works of 1922 and 1925. Fisher assumed that the conditional distribution of the response variable is Gaussian, but the joint distribution need not be. In this respect, Fisher&#x27;s assumption is closer to Gauss&#x27;s formulation of 1821.

In the 1950s and 1960s, economists used electromechanical desk calculators to calculate regressions. Before 1970, it sometimes took up to 24 hours to receive the result from one regression. 

Regression methods continue to be an area of active research. In recent decades, new methods have been developed for robust regression, regression involving correlated responses such as time series and growth curves, regression in which the predictor (independent variable) or response variables are curves, images, graphs, or other complex data objects, regression methods accommodating various types of missing data, nonparametric regression, Bayesian methods for regression, regression in which the predictor variables are measured with error, regression with more predictor variables than observations, and causal inference with regression. Modern regression analysis is typically done with statistical and spreadsheet software packages on computers as well as on handheld scientific and graphing calculators.

==Regression model==
In practice, researchers first select a model they would like to estimate and then use their chosen method (e.g., ordinary least squares) to estimate the parameters of that model. Regression models involve the following components:
*The unknown parameters, often denoted as a scalar or vector formula_1.
*The independent variables, which are observed in data and are often denoted as a vector formula_2 (where formula_3 denotes a row of data).
*The dependent variable, which are observed in data and often denoted using the scalar formula_4.
*The error terms, which are &quot;not&quot; directly observed in data and are often denoted using the scalar formula_5.

In various fields of application, different terminologies are used in place of dependent and independent variables.

Most regression models propose that formula_4 is a function (regression function) of formula_2 and formula_8, with formula_5 representing an additive error term that may stand in for un-modeled determinants of formula_4 or random statistical noise:

:formula_11

Note that the independent variables formula_2 are assumed to be free of error. This important assumption is often overlooked, although errors-in-variables models can be used when the independent variables are assumed to contain errors.

The researchers&#x27; goal is to estimate the function formula_13 that most closely fits the data. To carry out regression analysis, the form of the function formula_14 must be specified. Sometimes the form of this function is based on knowledge about the relationship between formula_4 and formula_2 that does not rely on the data. If no such knowledge is available, a flexible or convenient form for formula_14 is chosen. For example, a simple univariate regression may propose formula_18, suggesting that the researcher believes formula_19 to be a reasonable approximation for the statistical process generating the data.

Once researchers determine their preferred statistical model, different forms of regression analysis provide tools to estimate the parameters formula_20. For example, least squares (including its most common variant, ordinary least squares) finds the value of formula_20 that minimizes the sum of squared errors formula_22. A given regression method will ultimately provide an estimate of formula_1, usually denoted formula_24 to distinguish the estimate from the true (unknown) parameter value that generated the data. Using this estimate, the researcher can then use the &quot;fitted value&quot; formula_25 for prediction or to assess the accuracy of the model in explaining the data. Whether the researcher is intrinsically interested in the estimate formula_24 or the predicted value formula_27 will depend on context and their goals. As described in ordinary least squares, least squares is widely used because the estimated function formula_28 approximates the conditional expectation formula_29. However, alternative variants (e.g., least absolute deviations or quantile regression) are useful when researchers want to model other functions formula_30.

It is important to note that there must be sufficient data to estimate a regression model. For example, suppose that a researcher has access to formula_31 rows of data with one dependent and two independent variables: formula_32. Suppose further that the researcher wants to estimate a bivariate linear model via least squares: formula_33. If the researcher only has access to formula_34 data points, then they could find infinitely many combinations formula_35 that explain the data equally well: any combination can be chosen that satisfies formula_36, all of which lead to formula_37 and are therefore valid solutions that minimize the sum of squared residuals. To understand why there are infinitely many options, note that the system of formula_34 equations is to be solved for 3 unknowns, which makes the system underdetermined. Alternatively, one can visualize infinitely many 3-dimensional planes that go through formula_34 fixed points.

More generally, to estimate a least squares model with formula_40 distinct parameters, one must have formula_41 distinct data points. If formula_42, then there does not generally exist a set of parameters that will perfectly fit the data. The quantity formula_43 appears often in regression analysis, and is referred to as the degrees of freedom in the model. Moreover, to estimate a least squares model, the independent variables formula_44 must be linearly independent: one must &quot;not&quot; be able to reconstruct any of the independent variables by adding and multiplying the remaining independent variables. As discussed in ordinary least squares, this condition ensures that formula_45 is an invertible matrix and therefore that a unique solution formula_24 exists.

==Underlying assumptions==

By itself, a regression is simply a calculation using the data. In order to interpret the output of regression as a meaningful statistical quantity that measures real-world relationships, researchers often rely on a number of classical assumptions. These assumptions often include:

*The sample is representative of the population at large.
*The independent variables are measured with no error.
*Deviations from the model have an expected value of zero, conditional on covariates: formula_47
*The variance of the residuals formula_5 is constant across observations (homoscedasticity).
* The residuals formula_5 are uncorrelated with one another. Mathematically, the variance–covariance matrix of the errors is diagonal.

A handful of conditions are sufficient for the least-squares estimator to possess desirable properties: in particular, the Gauss–Markov assumptions imply that the parameter estimates will be unbiased, consistent, and efficient in the class of linear unbiased estimators. Practitioners have developed a variety of methods to maintain some or all of these desirable properties in real-world settings, because these classical assumptions are unlikely to hold exactly. For example, modeling errors-in-variables can lead to reasonable estimates independent variables are measured with errors. Heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors allow the variance of formula_5 to change across values of formula_2. Correlated errors that exist within subsets of the data or follow specific patterns can be handled using &quot;clustered standard errors, geographic weighted regression&quot;, or Newey–West standard errors, among other techniques. When rows of data correspond to locations in space, the choice of how to model formula_5 within geographic units can have important consequences. The subfield of econometrics is largely focused on developing techniques that allow researchers to make reasonable real-world conclusions in real-world settings, where classical assumptions do not hold exactly.

==Linear regression==
In linear regression, the model specification is that the dependent variable, formula_53 is a linear combination of the &quot;parameters&quot; (but need not be linear in the &quot;independent variables&quot;). For example, in simple linear regression for modeling formula_54 data points there is one independent variable: formula_55, and two parameters, formula_56 and formula_57:

:straight line: formula_58

In multiple linear regression, there are several independent variables or functions of independent variables.

Adding a term in formula_59 to the preceding regression gives:

:parabola: formula_60

This is still linear regression; although the expression on the right hand side is quadratic in the independent variable formula_61, it is linear in the parameters formula_56, formula_57 and formula_64

In both cases, formula_65 is an error term and the subscript formula_3 indexes a particular observation.

Returning our attention to the straight line case: Given a random sample from the population, we estimate the population parameters and obtain the sample linear regression model:

: formula_67

The residual, formula_68, is the difference between the value of the dependent variable predicted by the model, formula_69, and the true value of the dependent variable, formula_70. One method of estimation is ordinary least squares. This method obtains parameter estimates that minimize the sum of squared residuals, SSR:

:formula_71

Minimization of this function results in a set of normal equations, a set of simultaneous linear equations in the parameters, which are solved to yield the parameter estimators, formula_72.

In the case of simple regression, the formulas for the least squares estimates are

:formula_73
:formula_74

where formula_75 is the mean (average) of the formula_76 values and formula_77 is the mean of the formula_78 values.

Under the assumption that the population error term has a constant variance, the estimate of that variance is given by:

: formula_79

This is called the mean square error (MSE) of the regression. The denominator is the sample size reduced by the number of model parameters estimated from the same data, formula_80 for formula_81 regressors or formula_82 if an intercept is used. In this case, formula_83 so the denominator is formula_84.

The standard errors of the parameter estimates are given by

:formula_85

:formula_86

Under the further assumption that the population error term is normally distributed, the researcher can use these estimated standard errors to create confidence intervals and conduct hypothesis tests about the population parameters.

===General linear model===
In the more general multiple regression model, there are formula_81 independent variables:

: formula_88

where formula_89 is the formula_3-th observation on the formula_91-th independent variable.
If the first independent variable takes the value 1 for all formula_3, formula_93, then formula_57 is called the regression intercept.

The least squares parameter estimates are obtained from formula_81 normal equations. The residual can be written as

:formula_96

The normal equations are

:formula_97

In matrix notation, the normal equations are written as

:formula_98

where the formula_99 element of formula_100 is formula_89, the formula_3 element of the column vector formula_103 is formula_70, and the formula_91 element of formula_106 is formula_107. Thus formula_100 is formula_109, formula_103 is formula_111, and formula_106 is formula_113. The solution is

:formula_114

===Diagnostics===
Once a regression model has been constructed, it may be important to confirm the goodness of fit of the model and the statistical significance of the estimated parameters. Commonly used checks of goodness of fit include the R-squared, analyses of the pattern of residuals and hypothesis testing. Statistical significance can be checked by an F-test of the overall fit, followed by t-tests of individual parameters.

Interpretations of these diagnostic tests rest heavily on the model&#x27;s assumptions. Although examination of the residuals can be used to invalidate a model, the results of a t-test or F-test are sometimes more difficult to interpret if the model&#x27;s assumptions are violated. For example, if the error term does not have a normal distribution, in small samples the estimated parameters will not follow normal distributions and complicate inference. With relatively large samples, however, a central limit theorem can be invoked such that hypothesis testing may proceed using asymptotic approximations.

===Limited dependent variables===

Limited dependent variables, which are response variables that are categorical variables or are variables constrained to fall only in a certain range, often arise in econometrics.

The response variable may be non-continuous (&quot;limited&quot; to lie on some subset of the real line). For binary (zero or one) variables, if analysis proceeds with least-squares linear regression, the model is called the linear probability model. Nonlinear models for binary dependent variables include the probit and logit model. The multivariate probit model is a standard method of estimating a joint relationship between several binary dependent variables and some independent variables. For categorical variables with more than two values there is the multinomial logit. For ordinal variables with more than two values, there are the ordered logit and ordered probit models. Censored regression models may be used when the dependent variable is only sometimes observed, and Heckman correction type models may be used when the sample is not randomly selected from the population of interest. An alternative to such procedures is linear regression based on polychoric correlation (or polyserial correlations) between the categorical variables. Such procedures differ in the assumptions made about the distribution of the variables in the population. If the variable is positive with low values and represents the repetition of the occurrence of an event, then count models like the Poisson regression or the negative binomial model may be used.

==Nonlinear regression==
When the model function is not linear in the parameters, the sum of squares must be minimized by an iterative procedure. This introduces many complications which are summarized in Differences between linear and non-linear least squares.

==Prediction (interpolation and extrapolation) ==


Regression models predict a value of the &quot;Y&quot; variable given known values of the &quot;X&quot; variables. Prediction the range of values in the dataset used for model-fitting is known informally as &quot;interpolation&quot;. Prediction this range of the data is known as &quot;extrapolation&quot;. Performing extrapolation relies strongly on the regression assumptions. The further the extrapolation goes outside the data, the more room there is for the model to fail due to differences between the assumptions and the sample data or the true values.

A &quot;prediction interval&quot; that represents the uncertainty may accompany the point prediction. Such intervals tend to expand rapidly as the values of the independent variable(s) moved outside the range covered by the observed data.

For such reasons and others, some tend to say that it might be unwise to undertake extrapolation.

===Model selection=== 

The assumption of a particular form for the relation between &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;X&quot; is another source of uncertainty. A properly conducted regression analysis will include an assessment of how well the assumed form is matched by the observed data, but it can only do so within the range of values of the independent variables actually available. This means that any extrapolation is particularly reliant on the assumptions being made about the structural form of the regression relationship. If this knowledge includes the fact that the dependent variable cannot go outside a certain range of values, this can be made use of in selecting the model – even if the observed dataset has no values particularly near such bounds. The implications of this step of choosing an appropriate functional form for the regression can be great when extrapolation is considered. At a minimum, it can ensure that any extrapolation arising from a fitted model is &quot;realistic&quot; (or in accord with what is known).

==Power and sample size calculations==
There are no generally agreed methods for relating the number of observations versus the number of independent variables in the model. One method conjectured by Good and Hardin is formula_115, where formula_31 is the sample size, formula_117 is the number of independent variables and formula_118 is the number of observations needed to reach the desired precision if the model had only one independent variable. For example, a researcher is building a linear regression model using a dataset that contains 1000 patients (formula_31). If the researcher decides that five observations are needed to precisely define a straight line (formula_118), then the maximum number of independent variables (formula_117) the model can support is 4, because

: formula_122.

==Other methods==
Although the parameters of a regression model are usually estimated using the method of least squares, other methods which have been used include:
* Bayesian methods, e.g. Bayesian linear regression
* Percentage regression, for situations where reducing &quot;percentage&quot; errors is deemed more appropriate.
* Least absolute deviations, which is more robust in the presence of outliers, leading to quantile regression
* Nonparametric regression, requires a large number of observations and is computationally intensive
* Scenario optimization, leading to interval predictor models
* Distance metric learning, which is learned by the search of a meaningful distance metric in a given input space.

== Software ==
All major statistical software packages perform least squares regression analysis and inference. Simple linear regression and multiple regression using least squares can be done in some spreadsheet applications and on some calculators. While many statistical software packages can perform various types of nonparametric and robust regression, these methods are less standardized. Different software packages implement different methods, and a method with a given name may be implemented differently in different packages. Specialized regression software has been developed for use in fields such as survey analysis and neuroimaging.

<text>Object–role modeling (ORM) is used to model the semantics of a universe of discourse. ORM is often used for data modeling and software engineering.

An object–role model uses graphical symbols that are based on first order predicate logic and set theory to enable the modeler to create an unambiguous definition of an arbitrary universe of discourse. Attribute free, the predicates of an ORM Model lend themselves to the analysis and design of graph database models in as much as ORM was originally conceived to benefit relational database design.

The term &quot;object–role model&quot; was coined in the 1970s and ORM based tools have been used for more than 30 years – principally for data modeling. More recently ORM has been used to model business rules, XML-Schemas, data warehouses, requirements engineering and web forms.

== History ==
The roots of ORM can be traced to research into semantic modeling for information systems in Europe during the 1970s. There were many pioneers and this short summary does not by any means mention them all. An early contribution came in 1973 when Michael Senko wrote about &quot;data structuring&quot; in the IBM Systems Journal. In 1974 Jean-Raymond Abrial contributed an article about &quot;Data Semantics&quot;. In June 1975, Eckhard Falkenberg&#x27;s doctoral thesis was published and in 1976 one of Falkenberg&#x27;s papers mentions the term &quot;object–role model&quot;.

G.M. Nijssen made fundamental contributions by introducing the &quot;circle-box&quot; notation for object types and roles, and by formulating the first version of the conceptual schema design procedure. Robert Meersman extended the approach by adding subtyping, and introducing the first truly conceptual query language.

Object role modeling also evolved from the &quot;Natural language Information Analysis Method&quot;, a methodology that was initially developed by the academic researcher, G.M. Nijssen in the Netherlands (Europe) in the mid-1970s and his research team at the Control Data Corporation Research Laboratory in Belgium, and later at the University of Queensland, Australia in the 1980s. The acronym NIAM originally stood for &quot;Nijssen&#x27;s Information Analysis Methodology&quot;, and later generalised to &quot;Natural language Information Analysis Methodology&quot; and &quot;Binary Relationship Modeling&quot; since G. M. Nijssen was only one of many people involved in the development of the method.

In 1989, Terry Halpin completed his PhD thesis on ORM, providing the first full formalization of the approach and incorporating several extensions.

Also in 1989, Terry Halpin and G.M. Nijssen co-authored the book &quot;Conceptual Schema and Relational Database Design&quot; and several joint papers, providing the first formalization of object–role modeling.

A graphical NIAM design tool which included the ability to generate database-creation scripts for Oracle, DB2 and DBQ was developed in the early 1990s in Paris. It was originally named Genesys and was marketed successfully in France and later Canada. It could also handle ER diagram design. It was ported to SCO Unix, SunOs, DEC 3151&#x27;s and Windows 3.0 platforms, and was later migrated to succeeding Microsoft operating systems, utilising XVT for cross operating system graphical portability. The tool was renamed OORIANE and is currently being used for large data warehouse and SOA projects.

Also evolving from NIAM is &quot;Fully Communication Oriented Information Modeling&quot; FCO-IM (1992). It distinguishes itself from traditional ORM in that it takes a strict communication-oriented perspective. Rather than attempting to model the domain and its essential concepts, it models the communication in this domain (universe of discourse). Another important difference is that it does this on instance level, deriving type level and object/fact level during analysis.

Another recent development is the use of ORM in combination with standardised relation types with associated roles and a standard machine-readable dictionary and taxonomy of concepts as are provided in the Gellish English dictionary. Standardisation of relation types (fact types), roles and concepts enables increased possibilities for model integration and model reuse.

== Concepts ==
=== Facts ===
Object–role models are based on elementary facts, and expressed in diagrams that can be verbalised into natural language. A fact is a proposition such as &quot;John Smith was hired on 5 January 1995&quot; or &quot;Mary Jones was hired on 3 March 2010&quot;.

With ORM, propositions such as these, are abstracted into &quot;fact types&quot; for example &quot;Person was hired on Date&quot; and the individual propositions are regarded as sample data. The difference between a &quot;fact&quot; and an &quot;elementary fact&quot; is that an elementary fact cannot be simplified without loss of meaning. This &quot;fact-based&quot; approach facilitates modeling, transforming, and querying information from any domain.

=== Attribute-free ===
ORM is attribute-free: unlike models in the entity–relationship (ER) and Unified Modeling Language (UML) methods, ORM treats all elementary facts as relationships and so treats decisions for grouping facts into structures (e.g. attribute-based entity types, classes, relation schemes, XML schemas) as implementation concerns irrelevant to semantics. By avoiding attributes, ORM improves semantic stability and enables verbalization into natural language.

=== Fact-based modeling ===
Fact-based modeling includes procedures for mapping facts to attribute-based structures, such as those of ER or UML.

Fact-based textual representations are based on formal subsets of native languages. ORM proponents argue that ORM models are easier to understand by people without a technical education. For example, proponents argue that object–role models are easier to understand than declarative languages such as Object Constraint Language (OCL) and other graphical languages such as UML class models. Fact-based graphical notations are more expressive than those of ER and UML. An object–role model can be automatically mapped to relational and deductive databases (such as datalog).

=== ORM 2 graphical notation ===
ORM2 is the latest generation of object–role modeling. The main objectives for the ORM 2 graphical notation are:
* More compact display of ORM models without compromising clarity
* Improved internationalization (e.g. avoid English language symbols)
* Simplified drawing rules to facilitate creation of a graphical editor
* Extended use of views for selectively displaying/suppressing detail
* Support for new features (e.g. role path delineation, closure aspects, modalities)

=== Design procedure ===

System development typically involves several stages such as: feasibility study; requirements analysis; conceptual design of data and operations; logical design; external design; prototyping; internal design and implementation; testing and validation; and maintenance. The seven steps of the conceptual schema design procedure are:

# Transform familiar information examples into elementary facts, and apply quality checks
# Draw the fact types, and apply a population check
# Check for entity types that should be combined, and note any arithmetic derivations
# Add uniqueness constraints, and check arity of fact types
# Add mandatory role constraints, and check for logical derivations
# Add value, set comparison and subtyping constraints
# Add other constraints and perform final checks

ORM&#x27;s conceptual schema design procedure (CSDP) focuses on the analysis and design of data.

<doc id="827016" wikidata="Q763978" url="?curid=827016" title="Lazarus taxon">
<text>In paleontology, a Lazarus taxon (plural &quot;taxa&quot;) is a taxon that disappears for one or more periods from the fossil record, only to appear again either in later fossil records, or as actual living organisms, and often in isolated, obscure, or otherwise very specialized habitats. Likewise in conservation biology and ecology, it can refer to species or populations that were mistakenly thought to be extinct, and are rediscovered to be still living. The term Lazarus taxon was coined by Karl W. Flessa and David Jablonski in 1983 and was then expanded by Jablonski in 1986. Paul Wignall and Michael Benton defined Lazarus taxa as, &quot;At times of biotic crisis many taxa go extinct, but others only temporarily disappeared from the fossil record, often for intervals measured in millions of years, before reappearing unchanged&quot;. Earlier work also supports the concept though without using the name Lazarus taxon, like work by Christopher R. C. Paul.

The term refers to the story in the Christian biblical Gospel of John, in which Jesus Christ raised Lazarus from the dead.

== Potential explanations ==
Lazarus taxa are observational artifacts that appear to occur either because of (local) extinction, later resupplied, or as a sampling artifact. The fossil record is inherently sporadic (only a very small fraction of organisms become fossilized, and an even smaller fraction are discovered before destruction) and contains gaps not necessarily caused by extinction, particularly when the number of individuals in a taxon is very low.

After mass extinctions, such as the Permian–Triassic extinction event, the Lazarus effect occurred for many taxa. However, there appears to be no link with the abundance of fossiliferous sites and the proportion of Lazarus taxa, and no missing taxa have been found in potential refuges. Therefore, reappearance of Lazarus taxa probably reflects the rebound after a period of extreme rarity during the aftermath of such extinctions.

== Related but distinct concepts ==

An Elvis taxon is a look-alike that has supplanted an extinct taxon through convergent evolution.

A zombie taxon is a taxon that contains specimens that have been collected from strata younger than the extinction of the taxon. Later such fossils turn out to be freed from the original seam and refossilized in a younger sediment. For example, a trilobite that gets eroded out of its Cambrian-aged limestone matrix, and reworked into Miocene-aged siltstone.

A ghost lineage is a pronounced gap in time for the fossil record of a group, indicating that the group continued evolving throughout the gap, without direct fossil evidence from within the gap. Lazarus taxa are a type of ghost lineage where extinction was originally assumed to occur within the gap, only for younger fossils or surviving members of the group to indicate otherwise.

A living fossil is an extant taxon that appears to have changed so little compared with fossil remains, that it is considered identical. Living fossils may occur regularly in the fossil record, such as the lampshell &quot;Lingula&quot;, though the living species in this genus are not identical to fossil brachiopods.

Other living fossils however are also Lazarus taxa if these have been missing from the fossil record for substantial periods of time, such as applies for coelacanths.

In paleovirology, divergent clades of genomic elements from presumably extinct viruses are often known only from host genomes. However, in some cases extant viruses have later been associated with these &quot;fossil&quot; elements, indicating Lazarus-like taxa. For example, a clade of paleoviruses from presumed extinct filoviruses found in shrews was later found to contain an extant filovirus (Tapajós virus, TAPV). 

Finally, the term &quot;Lazarus species&quot; is applied to organisms that have been rediscovered as being still alive after having been widely considered extinct for years, without ever having appeared in the fossil record. In this last case, the term Lazarus taxon is applied in neontology.

=== From Quaternary (2.6 to 0 million years ago) ===

*Bush dog (&quot;Speothos venaticus&quot;), last surviving species of the genus &quot;Speothos&quot;; first described as an extinct taxon in 1842 by Peter Wilhelm Lund, based on fossils uncovered from Brazilian caves; Lund found and described living specimens in 1843 without realizing they were of the same species as the fossils, dubbing the living bush dogs as members of the genus &quot;Icticyon&quot;; this was not corrected until some time in the 20th century.
*Chacoan peccary (&quot;Catagonus wagneri&quot;), last surviving species of the genus &quot;Catagonus&quot;; believed to be the closest living relative to the extinct genus &quot;Platygonus&quot;. First described as extinct in 1930 as fossils; live specimens found in 1974.
* False killer whale, first described by the British paleontologist and biologist Richard Owen based on a skull discovered in 1843 found in Stamford, Lincolnshire in England and dated to the Middle Pleistocene around 126,000 years ago. The first carcasses washed up on the shores of Kiel Bay in Denmark in 1861; until this point the species was thought to be extinct.
* Bulmer&#x27;s fruit bat (&quot;Aproteles bulmerae&quot;), originally described from a Pleistocene garbage pile, it was subsequently discovered alive elsewhere in its native New Guinea.
* The arboreal chinchilla rats (&quot;Cuscomys&quot; spp.), which were originally described based on a single species (&quot;Cuscomys oblativus&quot;) known only from archaeological remains discovered in ancient Inca tombs described in 1912 and believed to be extinct for almost a century. A second species (&quot;Cuscomys ashaninka&quot;) was discovered alive in Peru in 1999, and photographs taken at Machu Picchu in 2009 suggest that &quot;C. oblativus&quot; is still alive as well.
* Majorcan midwife toad (&quot;Alytes muletensis&quot;), in the family Alytidae, described from fossil remains in 1977, discovered alive in 1979.
*&quot;Cymatioa cookae,&quot; a small bivalve mollusk of family Galeommatidae; originally documented in 1937 from Pleistocene fossil specimens near Los Angeles, then living specimens discovered in 2018 on the coast of Santa Barbara.
* Mountain pygmy possum (&quot;Burramys parvus&quot;), first discovered in the fossil record in 1895; rediscovered alive in 1966.
*&quot;Calliostoma bullatum&quot;, a species of deepwater sea snail; originally described in 1844 from fossil specimens in deep-water coral-related sediments from southern Italy, until extant individuals were described in 2019 from deep-water coral reefs off the coast of Mauritania.

=== From Neogene (23 to 2.6 million years ago) ===

* Nightcap oak (&quot;Eidothea hardeniana&quot; and &quot;Eidothea zoexylocarya&quot;), representing a genus previously known only from fossils 15 to 20 million years old, were recognized in 2000 and 1995, respectively.
* &quot;Gracilidris&quot;, a genus of dolichoderine ants thought to have gone extinct 15–20 million years ago was found in Paraguay, Brazil, and Argentina and redescribed in 2006.
*Laotian rock rat (&quot;Laonastes aenigmamus&quot;), a member of a family (Diatomyidae) thought to have gone extinct 11 million years ago; found in 1996.
* Monito del monte (&quot;Dromiciops&quot;), sole surviving member of the order Microbiotheria; first described in 1894, thought to have gone extinct 11 million years ago.
*&quot;Submyotodon&quot;, a genus of bat originally known from a single fossil species (&quot;S. petersbuchensis&quot;) described in 2003 from the Miocene of Germany, about 11 to 16 million years ago. In 2015, a phylogenetic analysis of bats from Taiwan and China found three species previously classified in &quot;Myotis&quot; (&quot;M. caliginosus&quot;, &quot;M. latirostris&quot;, and &quot;M. moupinensis&quot;) to be wholly distinct from any other member of &quot;Myotis&quot;, and instead more closely allied to the fossil &quot;Submyotodon&quot;, and thus reclassified them in &quot;Submyotodon&quot;, making the genus extant once more.
* Dawn redwood (&quot;Metasequoia&quot;), a genus of conifer, described as a fossil in 1941, rediscovered alive in 1944.
* Wollemi pine (&quot;Wollemia&quot;), a genus of coniferous tree in the family Araucariaceae; previously known only from fossils from 2 to 90 million years ago, rediscovered in 1994.

=== From Cretaceous (145 to 66 million years ago) ===

* Coelacanth (&quot;Latimeria&quot;), a member of a subclass (Actinistia) thought to have gone extinct 66 million years ago; live specimens found in 1938.

=== From Devonian (419 to 359 million years ago) ===

* Monoplacophora, a class of molluscs believed to have gone extinct in the middle Devonian Period (c. 380 million years ago) until living members were discovered in deep water off Costa Rica in 1952.

=== From Cambrian (539 to 485 million years ago) ===
* &quot;Schinderhannes bartelsi&quot;, an extinct Devonian member of the order Radiodonta. The discovery of its fossils in Devonian was astonishing because previously, radiodonts were known only from the Cambrian, 100 million years earlier.

== Discussions ==
Because its definition is ambiguous, some, like R. B. Rickards and A. J. Wright, reject the very concept of the Lazarus taxon. Rickards and Wright have questioned the usefulness of the concept, writing in &quot;Lazarus taxa, refugia and relict faunas: evidence from graptolites&quot; that anyone could argue that any gap in the fossil record could potentially be considered a Lazarus effect because the duration required for the Lazarus effect is not defined. They have argued that accurate plotting of biodiversity changes and species abundance through time, coupled with an appraisal of their palaeobiogeography, is more important than using this title to categorize species.

== Communication and education ==
The lack of public engagement around environmental issues has led conservationists to attempt newer communication strategies. One of them is the focus on positive messages, of which Lazarus species are an important part. One conservation outreach project that has focused exclusively on species rediscoveries is the Lost &amp; Found project which aims to tell the stories of species once thought extinct but that were subsequently rediscovered.

<doc id="827023" wikidata="Q147357" url="?curid=827023" title="Bleed air">
<text>Bleed air in aerospace engineering is compressed air taken from the compressor stage of a gas turbine, upstream of its fuel-burning sections. Automatic air supply and cabin pressure controller (ASCPC) valves bleed air from low or high stage engine compressor sections; low stage air is used during high power setting operation, and high stage air is used during descent and other low power setting operations. Bleed air from that system can be utilized for internal cooling of the engine, cross-starting another engine, engine and airframe anti-icing, cabin pressurization, pneumatic actuators, air-driven motors, pressurizing the hydraulic reservoir, and waste and water storage tanks. Some engine maintenance manuals refer to such systems as &quot;customer bleed air&quot;. 

Bleed air is valuable in an aircraft for two properties: high temperature and high pressure (typical values are and , for regulated bleed air exiting the engine pylon for use throughout the aircraft).

==Uses==

In civil aircraft, bleed air&#x27;s primary use is to provide pressure for the aircraft cabin by supplying air to the environmental control system. Additionally, bleed air is used to keep critical parts of the plane (such as the wing leading edges) ice-free.

Bleed air is used on many aircraft systems because it is easily available, reliable, and a potent source of power. For example, bleed air from an airplane engine is used to start the remaining engines. Lavatory water storage tanks are pressurized by bleed air that is fed through a pressure regulator.

When used for cabin pressurization, the bleed air from the engine must first be cooled as it exits the compressor stage at temperatures as high as by passing it through an air-to-air heat exchanger cooled by the cold outside air. It is then fed to an air cycle machine unit that regulates the temperature and flow of air into the cabin, keeping the environment comfortable. This process is contrary to the common misconception that cabin air in airplanes is the same air being recycled.

Bleed air is also used to heat the engine intakes. This prevents ice from forming, accumulating, breaking loose, and being ingested by the engine, which could damage it.

On aircraft powered by jet engines, a similar system is used for wing anti-icing by the &#x27;hot-wing&#x27; method. In icing conditions, water droplets condensing on a wing&#x27;s leading edge can freeze. If that happens, the ice build-up adds weight and changes the shape of the wing, causing a degradation in performance and possibly a critical loss of control or lift. To prevent this, hot bleed air is pumped through the inside of the wing&#x27;s leading edge, heating it to a temperature above freezing, which prevents the formation of ice. The air then exits through small holes in the wing edge.

On propeller-driven aircraft, it is common to use bleed air to inflate a rubber boot on the leading edge, breaking the ice loose after it has already formed.

Bleed air from the high-pressure compressor of the engine is used to supply reaction control valves as used for part of the flight control system in the Harrier family of military aircraft.

==Contamination==
On about 1 in 5,000 flights, bleed air used for air conditioning and pressurization can be contaminated by chemicals such as oil or hydraulic fluid. This is known as a fume event. While those chemicals can be irritating, such events have not been established to cause long-term harm.

Certain neurological and respiratory ill health effects have been linked anecdotally to exposure to bleed air that has been alleged to have been contaminated with toxic levels on commercial and military aircraft. This alleged long-term illness is referred to as aerotoxic syndrome, but it is not a medically recognized syndrome. One potential contaminant is tricresyl phosphate.

Many lobbying groups have been set up to advocate for research into this hazard, including the Aviation Organophosphate Information Site (AOPIS) (2001), the Global Cabin Air Quality Executive (2006) and the UK-based Aerotoxic Association (2007). Cabin Environment Research is one of many functions of the ACER Group, but their researchers have not yet established any causal relationship.

Although a study made for the EU in 2014 confirmed that contamination of cabin air could be a problem, that study also stated:

::&quot;A lot of reported fume events caused comfort limitations for the occupants but posed no danger. A verification of cabin air contamination with toxic substances (e.g. TCP/TOCP) was not possible with the fume events the BFU investigated.&quot;

While no scientific evidence to date has found that airliner cabin air has been contaminated to toxic levels (exceeding known safe levels, in ppm, of any dangerous chemical), a court in Australia in March 2010 found in favor of a former airline flight attendant who claimed she suffered chronic respiratory problems after being exposed to oil fumes on a trip in March 1992. Such testing is infrequent due to Boeing&#x27;s refusal to install air quality sensors in its planes, fearing lawsuits from crew or passengers over fume events, and airlines refused to allow flight attendants to carry air samplers after Congress mandated chemical measurements.

The FAA has revoked the medical certificates of several pilots who developed neurological issues after fume events. A judge who awarded workers&#x27; compensation to a pilot who had suffered toxic encephalopathy (brain damage) from a fume event condemned the airline industry&#x27;s obstructionism around fume events.

In July 2015, pilots on a Spirit Airlines flight were partially incapacitated by fumes in bleed air.

==Bleedless aircraft==
Bleed air systems have been in use for several decades in passenger jets. Recent improvements in solid-state electronics have enabled pneumatic power systems to be replaced by electric power systems. In a bleedless aircraft such as the Boeing 787, each engine has two variable-frequency electrical generators to compensate for not providing compressed air to external systems. Eliminating bleed air and replacing it with extra electric generation is believed to provide a net improvement in engine efficiency, lower weight, and ease of maintenance.

According to Boeing internal documents, eliminating the use of bleed air as a source of cabin air also translates into the “elimination of engine contaminants potentially entering cabin air supply.”

A bleedless aircraft achieves fuel efficiency by eliminating the process of compressing and decompressing air, and by reducing the aircraft&#x27;s mass due to the removal of ducts, valves, heat exchangers, and other heavy equipment.

The APU (auxiliary power unit) does not need to supply bleed air when the main engines are not operating. Aerodynamics are improved due to the lack of bleed air vent holes on the wings. By driving cabin air supply compressors at the minimum required speed, no energy wasting modulating valves are required. High-temperature, high-pressure air cycle machine (ACM) packs can be replaced with low temperature, low-pressure packs to increase efficiency. At cruise altitude, where most aircraft spend the majority of their time and burn the majority of their fuel, the ACM packs can be bypassed entirely, saving even more energy. Since no bleed air is taken from the engines for the cabin, the potential of engine oil contamination of the cabin air supply is eliminated.

Lastly, advocates of the design say it improves safety as heated air is confined to the engine pod, as opposed to being pumped through pipes and heat exchangers in the wing and near the cabin, where a leak could damage surrounding systems.

<text>K-66 is a east–west state highway in the southeastern corner of the U.S. state of Kansas. Its western terminus is at U.S. Route 69 Alternate (US-69 Alt.) and US-400 in Riverton. Its eastern terminus is at the Missouri state line near Galena (where it continues as Missouri Route 66). This road is noteworthy in the fact that it used to be part of the famed US-66. After 1961, the nearby Interstate 44 (I-44) offered a more direct route between Missouri and Oklahoma. In 1985, US-66 was decommissioned nationally. Kansas replaced the US-66 designation with K-66 on the portion of historic highway not numbered as US-69 Alt.

==Route description==
K-66 begins at a roundabout with US-69 Alt. and US-400 in Riverton. From here the highway travels eastward, and after intersects Southeast 70th Street and Military Street. Shortly past this intersection, K-66 becomes a four-lane divided highway and then crosses the Spring River. It remains a divided highway for roughly then converts back to two-lane, and shortly later intersects the northern terminus of K-26 (South Main Street). Past K-26, the highway travels about then turns to the northeast and becomes a four-lane divided highway once again. It continues northeastward for a short distance before crossing into Missouri and becoming Missouri Route 66 near Galena.

==History==
The easternmost section of K-66 was not US-66 until 1979. Prior to 1979, US-66 came in from Missouri as Front Street and turned south on Main Street before joining K-66. US-66 then followed K-66 to Riverton, where K-66 ends. Original US-66 through Kansas continues as a county road to the north and west of US-69 Alt. to Baxter Springs, and joins US-69 Alt. to the Oklahoma state line. The of US-66 in Kansas retain much of the character of the Mother Road.

Thus the final (1985) alignment of US-66 completely matches present US-69 Alt. and K-66. US-69 Alt. was formed in 1985 when US-66 was decommissioned.

<doc id="827027" wikidata="Q3750886" url="?curid=827027" title="Elvis taxon">
<text>In paleontology, an Elvis taxon (plural &quot;Elvis taxa&quot;) is a taxon that has been misidentified as having re-emerged in the fossil record after a period of presumed extinction, but is not actually a descendant of the original taxon, instead having developed a similar morphology by convergent evolution. This implies that the extinction of the original taxon is real, and one taxon containing specimens from before and after the extinction would be polyphyletic.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;Elvis taxon&quot; was coined by D. H. Erwin and M. L. Droser in a 1993 paper to distinguish descendant from non-descendant taxa:

== Related but distinctive concepts ==
By contrast, a Lazarus taxon is one that really is a descendant of the original taxon, and highlights transitional fossil records, which might be found later.

A zombie taxon has been considered a Lazarus taxon because it has been collected from younger strata, but it later turns out to be a fossil that was freed from the original seam and was refossilized in a sediment of a younger age. An example is a trilobite that gets eroded out of its Cambrian-aged limestone matrix and reworked into Miocene-aged siltstone.

== Examples ==
*&quot;Rhaetina gregaria&quot;, one of the most common Late Triassic brachiopod species, has been regarded as a survivor that ranges across the Triassic-Jurassic boundary into the Early Jurassic. The external morphology of specimens from before and after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event were initially thought to be identical. Study of the internal features of the early Jurassic material showed that it was actually quite distinct from the Triassic specimens, and should be assigned to the genus &quot;Lobothyris&quot; as &quot;L. subgregaria&quot;.

*The flightless bird Aldabra rail became extinct approximately 136,000 years ago following sea level rise and the total inundation of the island of Aldabra it inhabited. Fossil evidence suggests this species reappeared approximately 100,000 years ago when sea levels dropped and related species reinhabited the island, from which the modern white-throated rail evolved, where it is found to the present day.

<doc id="827028" wikidata="Q1439682" url="?curid=827028" title="Fotolog">
<text>Fotolog.com (originally Fotolog.net) was a social network for sharing primarily photos. The site claimed that its vision was to build a &quot;good&quot; social network which prioritizes the well-being of users. The site only allowed all members of the community to post once per day, which, according to the site, was aimed to end the overuse of social networking today and the meaningless consumption of content.

In 2020 the Fotolog.com domain name was turned into an SEO spam blog.

==History==
Launched in May 2002, the Fotolog site formerly generated over 3 billion page views, and it received over 20 million unique visitors each month. In 2007, Fotolog.com was in the list of the top 20 busiest websites in the Alexa global site rankings.

Fotolog used to be a registered trademark of Fotolog, Inc., which is a privately held company backed by BV Capital, 3i and several individual investors. Fotolog headquarters were in New York City, prior to its acquisition by Hi-Media Group.

The site had frequent technical problems during its growth. Originally, free accounts could not upload during peak hours, and only 500 people a day per country were allowed to register. On December 10, 2005, the site stated that &quot;Fotolog is currently able to accept 1,000 new free accounts from each country each day&quot;, up from 500 a day previously. According to Fotolog co-founder Scott Heiferman, upgrades had made the site much faster and, as of November 16, 2005, Fotolog was generating 750 million pageviews a month. In mid-2006, 10,000 people per day, per country were allowed to register, and on August 14, 2006, the limiting of daily registrations was removed.

In 2005, Fotolog received an investment of $2.4 million from BV Capital.

In Spring 2006, a book of photographs from fotolog.com was published by the UK publisher Thames &amp; Hudson titled &quot;fotolog.book: A Global Snapshot for the Digital Age&quot;. Edited by Andrew Long and containing text contributions by Nick Currie, the book is organized in sections highlighting several themes that arose in the site&#x27;s community of photographers and several individual photographers from some of the major cities and countries with many fotolog users.

On August 17, 2007, French online advertising company HiMedia agreed to acquire Fotolog for a combination of stock and cash worth $90 million.

After a few weeks of periodic downtime, on January 26, 2016, Fotolog announced (in the form of a large header message on all pages) that the site was being closed down and would become &quot;permanently unavailable&quot; on the February 20. However, the header was removed later.

On April 24, 2018, a new website was released under the fotolog.com domain, with a new logo and an overhauled design. Fotolog posted the new logo with a small line of text saying &quot;A new chapter of Fotolog begins here&quot;.

The last activity on the redesigned Fotolog website was recorded on March 13, 2019. Following this, Thinking Different, a company owned by serial domain name investor Kevin Macpherson, purchased the domain names for an undisclosed amount. Fotolog.com appeared as a completely new website on November 14, 2019. The new Fotolog.com presents itself as an online magazine. According to its WHOIS credentials, it now appears to be based in Brčko, Bosnia and Herzegovina.

==Usage==

The website used to offer both free and subscription accounts. The free version was ad-supported, and it limited users to uploading one picture per day and having only 20 comments (in their &quot;guestbook&quot;). The free user could also customize their page and add other fotologs into their &quot;Friends/Favorites&quot; list.

Paying members, known as &quot;Gold Camera patrons&quot; were allowed to upload up to 6 pictures a day and to have 200 comments per photo. Subsequent changes allowed Gold Camera members to comment on any guestbook that was full. Other features included customized photo-headings and having the most recent image appear beside the member&#x27;s name when commenting on other photoblogs.

However, the 2019 version was free for everyone and limited everyone to only post one photo per day in order to, according to the team letter, end the overuse of social networking today and the meaningless consumption of content.

The old Fotolog had &quot;groups&quot; which consisted of users focusing on a certain topic, and were managed by Fotolog users themselves. Fotolog groups allowed 50 photos per day. These photos might be added by any registered member. However, the &quot;groups&quot; feature was no longer available in the newer version.

Some site users, mainly in Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Spain, created so-called &quot;dedicated fotologs&quot; on their favorite actors and musicians, with images and information about them.

In Argentina and Uruguay, Fotolog gave rise to a fashion trend, called &#x27;Flogger&#x27;. Chilean urban group pokemones made use of Fotolog.

==User demographics==

The site was based in New York City, and the majority of its users come from the Americas, especially South America.

Previous site data showed that, as of September 2, 2008, Chile claimed the most accounts (4,827,387), Argentina was second with 4,225,209, and Brazil had 1,443,474 users. Fotolog&#x27;s success prompted many other websites to appear and compete. In Spanish, and also in Portuguese, the word &quot;fotolog&quot; is almost universally understood to mean &quot;any photoblog&quot;. For a time, Brazil was the country with most users; the site later lost users there to Orkut and Facebook.

==Password leak==
According to Avast Hackcheck and Firefox Monitor, there was a massive security breach sometime between December 2018 and March 2019. 28 million accounts were affected. The leak contains usernames, passwords, salts, email addresses and additional personal information.

<doc id="827035" wikidata="Q1417338" url="?curid=827035" title="1981 Irish hunger strike">
<text>The 1981 Irish hunger strike was the culmination of a five-year protest during the Troubles by Irish republican prisoners in Northern Ireland. The protest began as the blanket protest in 1976 when the British government withdrew Special Category Status (prisoner of war rather than criminal status) for convicted paramilitary prisoners.

In 1978, the dispute escalated into the dirty protest, where prisoners refused to leave their cells to wash and covered the walls of their cells with excrement. In 1980, seven prisoners participated in the first hunger strike, which ended after 53 days.

The second hunger strike took place in 1981 and was a showdown between the prisoners and the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. One hunger striker, Bobby Sands, was elected as a member of parliament during the strike, prompting media interest from around the world. The strike was called off after ten prisoners had starved themselves to death, including Sands, whose funeral was attended by 100,000 people. The strike radicalised Irish nationalist politics and was the driving force that enabled Sinn Féin to become a mainstream political party.

== Background ==
=== Tradition of hunger striking ===

The use of a hunger strike as a means of protest in Ireland is a tradition dating to pre-Christian times. This was not ascetic, but rather a way of publicly reprimanding those who deserved it. By fasting—possibly to death—on the doorstep of his master, the hunger striker enforced a claim against the other until either the latter gave in or the faster died. This tradition carried on even into the Christian era, and there are documented cases of early Irish saints fasting against God. The tradition of —fasting against an opponent—and —gaining justice through fasting—became codified in the 8th century .

In the 20th century, there had been hunger strikes by Irish republican prisoners since 1917, twelve men died on hunger strike prior to the 1981 strikes: Thomas Ashe (1917), Terence MacSwiney (1920), Michael Fitzgerald (1920), Joe Murphy (1920), Joseph Whitty (1923), Andy O&#x27;Sullivan (1923), Denny Barry (1923) (see 1923 Irish hunger strikes), Tony D&#x27;Arcy (1940), Jack McNeela (1940), Seán McCaughey (1946), Michael Gaughan (1974), and Frank Stagg (1976).

=== Internment ===

Although The Troubles had been ongoing since 1969, internment—which had been used several times in Ireland during the 20th century by both the British and Irish Free State—was not introduced until 1971. Internees were originally held in disused RAF base in County Down, called Long Kesh. Later renamed HM Prison Maze, it was run along the lines of a prisoner of war camp, complete, says the author Thomas Hennessey, &quot;with imagery reminiscent of Second World War POW camps surrounded by barbed wire, watchtowers and Nissen huts&quot;. Internees lived in dormitories and disciplined themselves with military-style command structures, drilled with dummy guns made from wood, and held lectures on guerrilla warfare and politics. 

Convicted prisoners were refused the same rights as internees until July 1972, when Special Category Status was introduced following a hunger strike by 40 Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) prisoners led by the veteran republican Billy McKee. Special Category, or political status, meant prisoners were treated similarly to prisoners of war; for example, not having to wear prison uniforms or do prison work. 

On 1 March 1976, Merlyn Rees, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in the Wilson ministry, announced that paramilitary prisoners would no longer be entitled to Special Category Status. This was part of Britain&#x27;s long-term strategy of criminalisation in the north, the intention being to alter perceptions of the conflict from a colonial war to that of a campaign against, effectively, criminal gangs. The policy was not imposed retroactively and only affected those convicted of offences after 1 March 1976. Long Kesh prisoners remained in the huts, but new intakes arrived at eight newly built cellular &quot;H-Blocks&quot;, so called due to their layout. 

After the introduction of the strategy of internment in 1971, both IRA violence and recruitment escalated.

=== Blanket and dirty protests ===

IRA volunteer Kieran Nugent had been interned in Long Kesh in 1974, but when he was arrested and convicted in 1976, he faced a very different prison regime. On 14 September, he was the first republican to be convicted since the withdrawal of status. As such he was required to wear a prison uniform as every other, non-political, prisoner did. Nugent refused, telling the warder, &quot;If you want me to wear a uniform, you&#x27;ll have to nail it to my back&quot;, and wore a blanket in its place. This began the blanket protest, in which IRA and Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) prisoners refused to wear prison uniforms and either went naked or fashioned garments from prison blankets. In 1978, after a number of clashes between prison officers and prisoners leaving their cells to wash and &quot;slop out&quot; (empty their chamber pots), this escalated into the dirty protest, where prisoners refused to wash and smeared their excrement on the walls of their cells. The scholar Begoña Aretxaga has suggested that, unlike the hunger strike which followed, &quot;the Dirty Protest had no precedent in the political culture&quot;. The protest soon spread to the women&#x27;s prison at Armagh, where not just faeces and urine but menstrual blood coated cell walls. These protests aimed to re-establish the political status expected by prisoners of war and were encapsulated in what became known as the &quot;Five Demands&quot;:

# The right not to wear a prison uniform;
# The right not to do prison work;
# The right of free association with other prisoners, and to organise educational and recreational pursuits;
# The right to one visit, one letter and one parcel per week;
# Full restoration of remission lost through the protest.

Initially, the dirty protest did not attract a great deal of attention, and even the IRA regarded it as a side issue in the context of the armed struggle. It began to attract attention when Tomás Ó Fiaich, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh, visited the prison and condemned the conditions there. O&#x27;Fiaich subsequently told the press, &quot;I was shocked at the inhuman conditions prevailing in H-Blocks... The stench and filth in some of the cells, with the remains of rotten food and human excreta scattered around the walls was almost unbearable. In two of them I was unable to speak for fear of vomiting.&quot; In 1979, former MP Bernadette McAliskey stood in the election for the European Parliament on a platform of support for the protesting prisoners and won just under 34,000 votes, even though Sinn Féin had called for a boycott of the election, and on one occasion, Martin McGuinness heckled her with a megaphone during a public meeting. Other republicans believed that her standing would be a diversion from the military campaign, and the Maze prisoners released a statement emphasising that, in their collective opinion, only physical force could remove the British.

Although McAliskey had stood solely on a prisoner&#x27;s rights ticket, there was no intention of turning the popular support the campaign had exposed into an organised movement at that time. However, the dirty protests had now lasted nearly three years, and morale inside was felt to be dangerously low. One ex-blanketman recalled that &quot;the more experienced men spoke for the rest of us when they said they were nearly at the end of their tether&quot;. Shortly after this, a &quot;Smashing H-Block&quot; conference took place in West Belfast in October 1979. Over 600 people, from many republican or left-wing organisations attended. This led to the formation of the broad-based National H-Block/Armagh Committee on a platform of support for the &quot;Five Demands&quot;, and included seasoned activists such as McAliskey, Eamonn McCann and Miriam Daly.

The period leading up to the hunger strike saw assassinations by both republicans and loyalists. The IRA shot and killed a number of prison officers, while loyalist paramilitaries shot and killed a number of activists in the National H-Block/Armagh Committee. These included a UFF gun attack which badly injured McAliskey and her husband, the assassination of Miriam Daly by the UDA while her house was under military observation, and, of the Irish Independence Party, John Turnley&#x27;s death at the hands of the UVF.

==1980 hunger strike ==
With the three-year anniversary of the dirty protest approaching in 1979, the prisoners presented a proposal for a hunger strike to the external leadership. Although this was rejected—former prisoner Laurence McKeown has said this proposal was &quot;unknown to most prisoners&quot;—the external leadership &quot;conceded, reluctantly&quot; that they had no alternative proposal. In June 1980, the European Court of Human Rights rejected a claim by the prisoners that their treatment during imprisonment was against the Convention on Human Rights on the grounds that the dirty protest was self-inflicted. On 27 October 1980, republican prisoners in the Maze began a hunger strike. One hundred and forty-eight prisoners volunteered to be part of the strike, but a total of seven were selected to match the number of men who signed the Easter 1916 Proclamation of the Republic. The group consisted of IRA members Brendan Hughes, Tommy McKearney, Raymond McCartney, Tom McFeely, Sean McKenna, Leo Green, and INLA member John Nixon.

On 1 December, three prisoners in Armagh Women&#x27;s Prison joined the strike. These were Mairéad Farrell (age 23), Mary Doyle (24) and Mairéad Nugent (21); Farrell stated that the intention was to &quot;create an additional source of pressure on the authorities&quot;. In four days, their average weight loss was . They were moved to a single clean cell 2 days after beginning and were in a stable condition. In the Maze, the seven men were in the prison hospital where they were weak but generally stable, except for McKenna and McKearney, who were sinking faster than their comrades. They remained defiant, however, and refused to accept less than the settlement of the Five Demands. The British government, while offering extensive prison reform, refused to acknowledge political status. The women&#x27;s strike lasted 19 days, finishing on 19 December. Twenty-six women remained on the dirty protest at Armagh Token three-day fasts broke out sporadically in Belfast Prison. In a between the IRA leadership and the government, with McKenna lapsing in and out of a coma and on the brink of death, the government appeared to concede the essence of the prisoners&#x27; five demands. The republicans were unsure whether the British position of refusing to negotiate could itself be a negotiating position, although this was emphatically denied by the Northern Ireland Office. The situation escalated on 15 December when 23 more prisoners joined the Maze strike. McKenna was by now gravely ill, and McKearney close behind; the eyesight of both had deteriorated.

Following &quot;intense&quot; and &quot;highly secret&quot; negotiations involving the Irish Government, the British clarified their position in a thirty-page document detailing a proposed settlement, which touched on many of the demands, although without conceding any. With the document in transit to Belfast, Hughes—having already been informed that rights to free association and to their own clothing had been granted, which he deemed &#x27;close&#x27; to what they wanted—took the decision to save McKenna&#x27;s life and end the strike after 53 days on 18 December. Later, however, Hughes stated that the reason he called it off was purely to save McKenna&#x27;s life and explicitly not because he expected British concessions or a prisoners&#x27; victory. Sands believed that the strikers &quot;were beat by a few lousy hours&quot;. The final British offer made no promises but gave assurances that the government &quot;will, subject to the overriding requirements of security, keep prison conditions—and that includes clothing, work, association, education, training and remission—under continuing review&quot;.

== 1981 hunger strike ==

By January 1981, it became clear that the prisoners&#x27; demands had not been conceded. The republican movement—&quot;unconvincingly&quot;, argues Kelly—blamed Britain, insisting that Thatcher had reneged on her promises. Instead, for example, of the right to their own clothes, which the prisoners believed had been conceded them, it became clear that they would have to wear prison-issued clothes until they could demonstrate full compliance with the regime. Sands saw this as &quot;a demand for capitulation rather than a step-by-step approach&quot;, argues O&#x27;Dochartaigh, and began pressuring the external leadership to authorise another hunger strike. The investigative author R. K. Walker has reported one member of British Intelligence as believing that

Walker&#x27;s source argues that this was a Pyrrhic victory for the government, as it heightened the resolve of the prisoners in the event of another hunger strike. Prison authorities began to supply the prisoners with officially issued civilian clothing, as had been announced. The Secretary of State, Humphrey Atkins, had already begun preparations for dealing with a second hunger strike based on the lessons of the first one. These included the behaviour of the military, close liaison between the NIO and Belfast community and church leaders, with the Irish government, and the attitude of the United States. In Dublin, the Irish Taoiseach, Charles Haughey recommended the British continue the strategy of &quot;a good mixture of ingenuity, subtlety and sensitivity&quot; that had served them the previous year.

On 4 February, the prisoners issued a statement saying that the British government had failed to resolve the crisis and declared their intention of &quot;hunger striking once more&quot;. The prisoners gradually wound down the dirty protest, requesting baths and shaving and allowing themselves to be moved to new cell blocks. The blanket protest continued. The seven volunteers who had recently ended their hunger strike publicly announced their support for another, although Sands was still concerned at this point that the external leadership might veto a strike. The leadership did not, in fact, and desperately sent in comms attempting to dissuade Sands from another hunger strike. But Sands intended to &quot;send a clear signal to his own superiors that he &#x27;meant business&#x27;&quot;. The second hunger strike began on 1 March, when Bobby Sands, the IRA&#x27;s former officer commanding (OC) in the prison, refused food. The date was deliberately chosen as the fifth anniversary of the withdrawal of status. A statement from the prisoners was issued by Danny Morrison, Sinn Féin&#x27;s publicity director:

We have asserted that we are political prisoners and everything about our country, our arrests, interrogations, trials, and prison conditions, show that we are politically motivated and not motivated by selfish reasons or for selfish ends. As further demonstration of our selflessness and the justness of our cause a number of our comrades, beginning today with Bobby Sands, will hunger-strike to the death unless the British government abandons its criminalization policy and meets our demand for political status.
Sands organised the strike along lines which made his death—and several more—effectively inevitable. Unlike in the first strike, the prisoners joined one at a time and at staggered intervals; Sands started first and was, therefore, almost certain to die, and die first. This was intended to arouse maximum public support and exert maximum pressure on Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, which the republican movement initially struggled to generate. The Sunday Sands began his strike, 3,500 people marched through West Belfast; this was compared to 10,000 marchers four months previously. Edward Daly, Bishop of Derry, condemned the return to hunger strike as being not &quot;morally justified&quot; while Sands held journalists&#x27; interviews from his bed. Food was given to Sands every day, although this was refused. One of Sands&#x27;s fellow prisoners reported how food would sit there all day, and when it was taken away at night, the warders &quot;would accuse Bobby of having eaten a pea as they had put &#x27;130 on the plate and now there are only 129&#x27;.&quot;

The author and researcher Ed Moloney has argued, on Sands&#x27;s strategy, that it meant that &quot;if any hunger striker died, the moral pressure on those who followed to continue through to the end was huge. The fast also guaranteed that if there were deaths, the North would be pitched into a crisis every fortnight or so until the end. As an instrument for destabilizing political life in Ireland, it was beyond historical comparison.&quot;

On 5 March, Thatcher flew to Belfast for a lightning visit, in an attempt to reassure the Protestant community of the government&#x27;s continuing commitment to the Union. She denied it was a response to the latest hunger strike, saying &quot;it ought to be as natural for the Prime Minister to visit this part of the United Kingdom as for her... to visit Lancashire or Kent&quot;, and that she wished to build a &quot;healthy and harmonious society&quot; in the north. She summarised the government&#x27;s philosophy in a speech before leaving:

However, she also seems to have not held the prisoners themselves responsible for their actions, and even regret, at their forthcoming deaths:

Ten days later, Sands was joined by Francis Hughes. On the 22nd, Raymond McCreesh and Patsy O&#x27;Hara began their fasts. The British strategy, at first, was to wait it out and allow time to collapse the strike as it had done in 1980. In the meantime, though, &quot;the strike was quickly overtaken by other events&quot; outside Belfast.

===Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election===
On the same day Thatcher visited the north, Independent Republican &quot;unity&quot; MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone Frank Maguire died, resulting in a by-election. According to McAliskey, it was already intended that Sands should win Maguire&#x27;s seat. She later told how Frank was going to make his first speech in Westminster announcing his resignation. There was debate among nationalists and republicans regarding who should contest the election: Austin Currie of the Social Democratic and Labour Party expressed an interest, as did McAliskey and Maguire&#x27;s brother Noel.

After negotiations, they agreed not to split the nationalist vote by contesting the election. This was unpopular in the SDLP, whose ex-leader Gerry Fitt—until 1978, the party&#x27;s only MP and now a Unity MP—criticised the SDLP for abstaining, and Currie himself later said he was &quot;extremely angry and frustrated&quot; not to have been chosen as his party&#x27;s candidate. Sands thus stood as an Anti H-Block candidate and had a clear run against Ulster Unionist Party candidate Harry West. Sands was allowed to stand under the Criminal Law Act 1967, which allowed convicted criminals to be elected. The election took place on 9 April, and following a high-profile campaign, Sands was elected to the British House of Commons with 30,492 votes to West&#x27;s 29,046, amounting to over 52% of the vote. The result &quot;gravely alarmed&quot; the government, which almost immediately began looking at ways of disqualifying the new MP. It also alarmed the unionist community, to whom Sands was merely a convicted terrorist. An Enniskillen councillor protested that Fermanagh unionists were &quot;astounded&quot; that the Catholic community elected Sands as they did. Harry West said afterwards, &quot;Now we know the types of people who are living among us&quot;. The Anti-H Block cause received a profile boost: now that a British MP might starve to death, Bowyer Bell says, &quot;the international media began to arrive&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the result as &quot;a stunning blow to the Protestant establishment of Northern Ireland&quot; and that it &quot;cast into doubt the view often expressed by politicians in London that the IRA is supported only by a fringe of the Catholic voters&quot;. For its part, the &quot;Irish Times&quot; also reported the election as &quot;a serious embarrassment to the British Government&quot; and a &quot;body blow for those who claimed that most Nationalists would not support paramilitary organisation&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot;, meanwhile, concentrated on whether it was possible to remove Sands from office, and noted that, in any case, &quot;even if he is allowed to keep his seat, he is likely to be dead of starvation soon&quot;.

Sands&#x27; election victory raised hopes that a settlement could be negotiated, but Thatcher stood firm in refusing to give concessions to the hunger strikers. She stated, &quot;We are not prepared to consider special category status for certain groups of people serving sentences for crime. Crime is crime is crime; it is not political&quot;. In the blaze of the world&#x27;s cameras, several intermediaries visited Sands in an attempt to negotiate an end. These included three Irish MEPs, Síle de Valera—granddaughter of Éamon de Valera—Neil Blaney and John O&#x27;Connell, as well as Pope John Paul II&#x27;s personal envoy, John Magee. Several European Commission of Human Rights (ECHR) officials also sought a meeting with Sands, but he refused unless representatives of the IRA and Sinn Féin could attend, and this the Maze authorities could not allow. Labour MP Roy Mason also visited Sands in order to tell him that when he died, he would get no sympathy or recognition from the British labour movement. This appears to have alienated moderate Catholics, however. With Sands close to death, the government&#x27;s position remained unchanged, with Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Humphrey Atkins stating that &quot;If Mr Sands persisted in his wish to commit suicide, that was his choice. The Government would not force medical treatment upon him.&quot; Sands died in the early hours of 5 May 1981; Hughes was two weeks behind him and the next two a week behind Hughes. Small-scale rioting broke out almost immediately, particularly in the interface area of New Barnsley. The Gaelic Athletic Association was condemned by an Irish Republican Socialist Party councillor for banning anti-H Block activity on its premises.

===Other elections===
Sinn Féin had traditionally abstained from electoral politics, seeing it as reinforcing colonial rule in the north and an illegal and illegitimate process in the south. Local elections in the south were contested, but although there were increasing calls for this approach to be expanded to the north, the most recent attempt—in November 1980—was voted down at the party&#x27;s Ard Fheis. The death of Sands necessitated another by-election in Fermanagh and South Tyrone. This time the Anti-H Block candidate was Owen Carron, Sands&#x27;s election agent. Held on the day Devine died, Carron won the by-election with an increased number of votes. The increasing electability of republican candidates worried the Irish government. Anti-H Block candidates won over 40,000 first preference votes at the 1981 Irish general election, and elected two prisoners to the Dáil, Paddy Agnew to Louth and hunger striker Kieran Doherty in Cavan-Monaghan. Neither took their seat. Joe McDonnell narrowly missed election in Sligo–Leitrim. The election victories of Doherty and Agnew denied power to Charles Haughey&#x27;s outgoing Fianna Fáil government, which lost their narrow majority.

Gerry Adams saw these results primarily as a warning to the next Irish government to &quot;move on the prisoners&#x27; demands&quot;. There were also local elections in Northern Ireland on 20 May, although Sinn Féin did not contest them. Some smaller groups and independents who supported the hunger strikers gained seats, such as the Irish Independence Party with 21 seats, while the IRSP (the INLA&#x27;s political wing) and People&#x27;s Democracy (a Trotskyist group) gained two seats each, and a number of pro-hunger strike independent candidates also won seats. The British government passed the Representation of the People Act 1981 to prevent another prisoner from contesting the second by-election in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, which was due to take place following the death of Sands. On 4 July, the prisoners stated they were not asking for preferential treatment, saying, &quot;We would warmly welcome the introduction of the Five Demands for all prisoners&quot;.

==Prisoner communication==
Until the late 1970s, the blanket protest was effectively a passive one. Because the prisoners would not wear uniforms, they could not come out of their cells, even for masses or visits. The problem with this all-or-nothing &quot;macho&quot; strategy is that it made communicating with the outside world much harder, and it was difficult to get word out about the conditions they dwelt in. It also undermined morale, both in the Maze and on the outside. The situation changed with the arrival of Brendan Hughes in the H Block; Hughes, supported by Sands, advocated coming out of cells, not just to improve their own existence but, more importantly, to allow them to take advantage of the opportunities visits presented for smuggling. The Adams/Hughes stratagem also made prison protests more sustainable in the long term. It also improved internal and external communications, the weaknesses of which had been exposed in the first hunger strike, when Sands and Hughes could not meet, and there was little up-to-date information being shared. Internally, prisoners in one wing could generally shout to another wing, especially at night. Other methods they developed were creative, such as tying items onto a blanket-thread string, tying the other end to a button, and then &quot;shooting the button&quot; across the corridor under cell doors.

External communication was maintained via prison visits. These allowed the prisoners to send out letters and receive items from the outside, such as ball point refills, cigarette papers—for both smoking and writing on—tobacco, and quartz crystal radios. For smuggling goods and letters, the prisoners&#x27; mouths and body cavities provided not just a practical method of importation but another act of resistance against the prison regime. Cavities for the Maze prisoners included rectal, throat and nasal passages, as well as within foreskins and navels. One prisoner became known as &quot;The Suitcase&quot; on account of how much he could carry inside him, while another set a record with 40 comms under his foreskin. The long-term effect of the change of prisoner strategy and the opening up of lines of communication in 1978 was that, three years later, the world now had a thorough, if a third party, knowledge of conditions inside the Maze, due to the volume of information that had previously come out.

David Beresford, a Northern Ireland correspondent for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1981, researched the methods the prisoners used to collect equipment, as the H Blocks had been designed to constrain prisoners&#x27; communications. Although the prisoners had the final say on who visited them—they had to send their VOs to the governor—they were generally expected to accept the recommendations of the Army Council, which was interested in maximising the number of couriers available. If possible, these couriers—nearly all of them women—would also be family or friends of the prisoner. They brought and received comms. These were tiny letters, written on cigarette papers and wrapped in clingfilm during transportation, either internally or under clothing: &quot;The system became so efficient that on occasion the external leadership could expect to get a message in, a reply out and a second message back in in a single day&quot;.

==Continuing violence==
===Paramilitary activity===
Even before Sands&#x27;s death, pro-prisoner violence was occurring. British businessman Geoffrey Armstrong of British Leyland was giving a speech to the Dublin Junior Chamber of Commerce when three balaclavad men shot him in the legs while shouting, &quot;This action is in support of the H-Blocks&quot;. The IRA denied responsibility. Violence was not confined to the IRA. Other incidents included the shooting and wounding of UDA councillor Sam Millar at home on Shankill Road by the INLA. There were retaliatory UDA killings in Belfast; an RUC officer was blown up by a car bomb, and a woman in Derry was assassinated while collecting census forms door to door. The IRA released a statement that attacks on security services would increase. The first paramilitary victim following Sands&#x27;s death was Constable Peter Ellis, who was shot by the IRA on 6 May in New Lodge. The following day James Power, INLA, was blown up by his organisation&#x27;s own bomb near his home in the Markets area. The &quot;Lost Lives&quot; project has calculated that around 50 people lost their lives in the period between the death of Sands and the taking off of Devlin. Following Hughes&#x27;s death, the Irish country homes of James Comyn, a British High Court judge, and Lord Farnham, were burned out by the IRA, and in Belfast, the night before his burial, there were seven shooting incidents and an explosion. Two days later, Constable Stephen Vallely died when an RPG hit his Land Rover; he was the first RUC to be killed in a rocket attack. Attacks on security forces continued and became more intense when there was a burial. Soldiers were killed by a landmine in Newry; a police officer was shot outside a pub; reservist Colin Dunlop was shot in the Royal Victoria Hospital, the conflict&#x27;s first Mormon casualty; Further hunger striker deaths were met with further street violence; following the death of O&#x27;Hara, for example, the police were attacked, and a man was killed by a plastic bullet.

The IRA killed 13 policemen, 13 soldiers—including five members of the UDR—and five civilians. The seven months were one of the bloodiest periods of the Troubles, with a total of 61 people killed, 34 of them civilians. Prison officers became a favoured target by the IRA: Eighteen had been killed in the run-up to and duration of the first hunger strike, as well as two prison governors, including Albert Mills in 1978. This was the republican movement&#x27;s means of upping the ante against a relatively soft target. Former IRA prisoner Richard O&#x27;Rawe has argued that, from the perspective of the prisoners, prison staff waged a campaign of violence against them, including beatings and testicular squeezings.

===Funerals===
By late April, with Sands on the verge of death, the British government was making plans to deal with the popular consequences. Atkins briefed Thatcher that not only were thousands expected to turn out for Sands&#x27;s funeral, but large-scale rioting was expected. The RUC&#x27;s main priority was to prevent demonstrators from entering Protestant areas, which were already being spoken of as defended by Protestant paramilitaries. Although Sands&#x27;s funeral—attended by around 100,000 people—on 7 May passed off peacefully, that night, violence broke out across Belfast; security forces were attacked with acid and petrol bombs. Ten thousand people attended the funeral of Francis Hughes, which took place &quot;not without some controversy&quot;, argues Hennessey. &quot;The Times&quot; Northern Ireland correspondent Chris Ryder described an &quot;undignified chase&quot; across South Belfast after his body was handed over to his family. The family, and the wider republican movement, wanted the remains to be taken via the Falls Road and Toomebridge—where receptions had been laid on—whereas the RUC had directed it be taken from the Maze to his place of burial, Bellaghy. The police considered any other route—which would have to march past Protestant areas—too dangerous for both security forces and civilians. As such it was decided to give Hughes a police convoy, although the chief constable, Jack Hermon, was &quot;less certain than one would like&quot; of the exact statutory powers under which the force did so.

Hermon&#x27;s priority for the future was that—however many more funerals there might be—the IRA would not be in control. Both McCreesh&#x27;s and O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s funerals were accompanied by paramilitary colour parties, speeches and other trappings. The former passed without incident, but O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s descended into rioting. Next to die, McDonnell&#x27;s funeral experienced some of the worst violence yet. The British Army, through an airborne observation post, attempted to arrest the IRA firing party that had volleyed over the coffin, and this led to rioting when the crowd stopped them. Walker argues this was a tactical decision by the government, and &quot;gave the authorities a chance to demonstrate that there would be no let up in their battle against the IRA—not in jail, not on the streets and not at funerals&quot;. Black flags were flown from nationalist homes: these were intended to express both grief and anger towards the government, but they also contained an implicit threat towards those deemed the strikers&#x27; opponents.

==Response==
===British–Republican negotiations===

Despite Thatcher&#x27;s oft-repeated mantra that she &quot;did not talk to terrorists&quot;, historians are aware that the British government had been negotiating with elements of the IRA since 1972, when the first ceasefire was being arranged between Willie Whitelaw and a delegation including Martin McGuinness, Gerry Adams and IRA chief-of-staff Seán Mac Stíofáin. The same occurred with church-backed talks in 1974–1975. Historians and political observers are also aware that &quot;behind closed doors she &quot;did&quot; authorize discussions with the Irish Republican movement&quot;. This back-channel line of communication between the IRA Army Council and the higher echelons of the British government was &quot;painstakingly created&quot; in 1972 and involved many of the same individuals for the next 20 years. It was known about by the prime minister and overseen by MI6. However, it was complicated by the fact that when the talks with Whitelaw had been exposed in the tabloids, he had banned further direct communications. Thomas Hennessey has argued that the Prime Minister&#x27;s &quot;hand was literally all over the &#x27;deal&#x27;&quot; accepted by Hughes in December 1979, and the speed with which the government were able to present a working hypothesis to Brendan Hughes in the Maze—regardless of its acceptability—told the republican movement that the British were, in fact, willing and able to negotiate. Morrison admitted that the British were &quot;taking a big risk here, dealing with us, because that alone is a huge story—&#x27;you shouldn&#x27;t talk to these people&#x27;, and here you are, flying somebody over&quot;.

Kenneth Stowe—at the time Permanent Under-Secretary of State of the NIO—later said that Thatcher was &quot;fully aware&quot; of the necessity in negotiating with Sinn Féin if one wished to settle Northern Irish affairs. According to Thatcher&#x27;s biographer, Charles Moore, Adams and McGuinness wanted to bring the hunger strike to an end but required something to take back to the republican movement which demonstrated British good faith. Moore says that Thatcher allowed Adams to receive some further concessions while rejecting the fundamental premise of status. According to Adams, it was the government who &quot;opened up contact&quot; but then closed it the moment the first hunger strike was called off.

However, lines of communication remained open after the end of the 1980 hunger strike, and were still available on the outbreak of the next. Indeed, soon after her election, Thatcher spoke to President Jimmy Carter on the telephone in which she stated that her preferred strategy was through &quot;patient and persistent negotiation&quot;. Publicly, however, it was a different story. In December 1980, the NIO&#x27;s PUM, John Blelloch emphasised to a republican contact that there could be no question of negotiations while the strike was ongoing. When Northern Ireland Office (NIO) officials did meet, on occasion, with republicans, these were generally called &quot;exercises in clarification&quot; rather than negotiations. This was so as not to send the wrong message to observers, particularly to unionist leaders. Even so, John Molyneux, leader of the UUP, wondered if the British understood they would &quot;have difficulty&quot; in persuading people that this was all the talks amounted to. Hence the British talked to republicans through third parties, such as members of the religious community, rather than to Sands or Hughes directly. For example, the Pope&#x27;s envoy, John Magee, met with Atkins as he did Sands; again, Atkins emphasised that this did not constitute negotiation. To Magee, Sands appeared to understand this, stating that he merely wanted &quot;satisfaction&quot; on the question of the demands. However, the result was that 

Thatcher continued, in public, to maintain her stance that &quot;you can&#x27;t compromise with violence&quot;. Meeting Protestant religious leaders, though, she was prepared to admit that, whatever the public view of the IRA, there was &quot;a lot&quot; of sympathy for their ideals among Catholics. By May, Atkins was enjoining upon Thatcher a policy of responding positively to external proposals—such as from the EHCR—which would also prevent the government from being &quot;sucked into any kind of negotiation&quot;. O&#x27;Fiaich also believed more input from the ECHR would be useful, and that he and Father Crilly could join them; but again, O&#x27;Fiaich emphasised that he was not negotiating. In the event, Thatcher turned the suggestion down in case it looked as though the ECHR were her emissaries.

Privately, contact between the NIO and contacts of the republican leadership continued. In early June 1981, communications were sufficiently advanced for there to be &quot;a rich crop of rumours&quot; circulating in the British press as to whether Thatcher was, in fact, negotiating with the IRA. As a result, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) threatened to release a statement condemning her government for brinkmanship and requesting that civil servants be allowed openly into the Maze to negotiate. The government was also under increased pressure from senior police echelons and military commanders to take a more conciliatory approach, sufficient for Atkins to urge a change tactics upon Thatcher. The four days before McDonnell does saw intense negotiations. Duddy telephoned Tom, his contact in the shady areas of government when communication lines open, at 2230. This was to advise the British that the prisoners would likely be responding in the next few hours. His next call to Tom—at 0230 the following day—lasted two and a half hours. Duddy attempted to gain as much information on British tactics as he could. The issue of clothing seemed most easily resolvable. By 0500, Duddy had a fair amount of information to take back to the leadership. Morrison took the news into the Maze; Tom phoned Duddy later that afternoon, seeking information on the IRA&#x27;s likely view. Twenty-four hours and eight lengthy phone calls later, on the evening of 6 July, Atkins, Thatcher, the senior civil servant Philip Woodfield and others met to discuss these reports. Atkins could not afford to appear soft, but in view of the time pressure—McDonnell was by now close to collapse—he suggested to Thatcher that &quot;we should communicate to the PIRA overnight a draft statement&quot; addressing the five demands. Work, for example, would constitute light-weight, domestic tasks or studying for Open University, while association would be dealt with by local supervisory officers. Thatcher edited the draft to reduce its conciliatory tone, signalling that while they might soften their approach to uniform, work and association were not included. Another meeting just past midnight on the 8th saw the same group meet. This time, Atkins suggested resending the earlier proposal but emphasising that in the event of non-acceptance, &quot;the British government would immediately issue an alternative statement&quot;. By 0210, McDonnell had gone into a coma, which, at that point, the republican leadership was not aware of, although the government was. Previous prisoners had not died until they had been in a comatose state for around 48 hours, so it is possible that the government thought it had some hours still to negotiate in.

Joe McDonnell died the same early morning as the statement was released, a couple of hours before it was read to the prisoners by the Governor and a civil servant. The external leadership heard of the death on the radio. The prisoners were dismayed at what they saw as government hypocrisy. After weeks of being told that the government would not talk to them, they managed to send in an NIO official hours after McDonnell&#x27;s death. The prisoners were insisting on open negotiations by the end of July. When pressed on this by the Dublin government, the British response was that &quot;we have always understood the Irish Government to be opposed to all forms of negotiation with subversive organisations... [so] that is not possible&quot;.

===International===

In Ireland, there were demonstrations in many towns, including the burning of Thatcher-style effigies. Vigils were held with paramilitaries attending in some cases, and in Dublin, Gardaí were attacked with petrol bombs. In Lisbon on 7 May, a crowd of several hundred marched on the British Embassy and were addressed by a Sinn Féin speaker, while in Reykjavík, a demonstration outside the embassy condemned Britain for having &quot;savagely attacked the ranks of Irish Freedom Fighters&quot; in a statement. Solidarity leader Lech Walesa praised Sands, in Oslo—where Queen Elizabeth II was touring—pro-IRA graffiti appeared, and in India, opposition MPs stood for a minute&#x27;s silence. A street outside the embassy in Tehran was renamed from Churchill Street to Khiyaban–E Bobby Sands, and members of the Iranian Embassy in London attended Sands&#x27;s funeral. Over the course of the strikes, the British government faced increasing international opposition. In France, the Foreign Minister Claude Cheysson talked of the strikers&#x27; &quot;supreme sacrifice&quot;, and threatened to boycott the royal wedding that July; in response the British Ambassador, Reginald Hibbert, pointed out that it was no different to how the French government treated demands for Corsican independence when it was backed by the FLNC&#x27;s armed struggle. The French Communist Party praised the strikers in a statement to the embassy, and in New York City, the consulate said they dare not fly the union flag for fear it would be stolen and burnt in protest, while in Milan, the Red Brigades firebombed a British Leyland showroom. In France &quot;ignorant and uninformed students,&quot; as Wharton describes them, chanted &quot;&quot;, while in Italy, 5,000 students burnt union flags; they were, comments Wharton, &quot;blessed with the same ignorance as their French counterparts&quot;. Approximately one thousand people attended a public mass in New York&#x27;s St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral by Cardinal Cooke calling for reconciliation, while also in the city Longshoremen boycotted British ships. In London, the Queen was also harassed by a banner protesting Sands&#x27;s &quot;murder&quot; when she opened Wood Green Shopping Centre in North London in May. However, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; supported Thatcher&#x27;s position, agreeing with her in an editorial that the safety of the state was at risk. On the death of Doherty, the Dáil&#x27;s national flag was lowered to half mast as was traditional on the death of a sitting member; he had lasted, at 73 days, the longest yet.

==Deaths and end of strike==
When, on 5 May, Sands died in the prison hospital on the 66th day of his hunger strike, Humphrey Atkins issued a statement saying that Sands had committed suicide &quot;under the instructions of those who felt it useful to their cause that he should die&quot;. More than 100,000 people lined the route of his funeral, which was conducted with full IRA military honours. Margaret Thatcher showed no sympathy for his death, telling the House of Commons that &quot;Mr. Sands was a convicted criminal. He chose to take his own life. It was a choice that his organisation did not allow to many of its victims.&quot;

In the two weeks following Sands&#x27;s death, three more hunger strikers died. Francis Hughes died on 12 May, resulting in further rioting in nationalist areas of Northern Ireland, in particular Derry and Belfast. Following the deaths of Raymond McCreesh and Patsy O&#x27;Hara on 21 May, Tomás Ó Fiaich, by then Primate of All Ireland, criticised the British government&#x27;s handling of the hunger strike. Despite this, Thatcher continued to refuse to negotiate a settlement. She stated, &quot;faced with the failure of their discredited cause, the men of violence have chosen in recent months to play what may well be their last card&quot;, during her visit to Belfast in May.

Following the deaths of Joe McDonnell and Martin Hurson, the families of some of the hunger strikers attended a meeting on 28 July with Catholic priest Father Denis Faul. The families expressed concern at the lack of a settlement to the priest, and a decision was made to meet with Adams later that day. At the meeting, Father Faul put pressure on Adams to find a way of ending the strike, and Adams agreed to ask the IRA leadership to order the men to end the hunger strike. The following day, Adams held a meeting with six of the hunger strikers to outline a proposed settlement on offer from the British government should the strike be brought to an end. The six men rejected the settlement, believing that accepting anything less than the Five Demands would be a betrayal of the sacrifice made by Sands and the other hunger strikers who had died. Richard O&#x27;Rawe has suggested, on this, that by now, &quot;&#x27;no compromise&#x27; meant &#x27;no strategy&#x27;&quot; and that the prisoners were &quot;shackled&quot; by a &quot;frantic desire&quot; to prove that no hunger striker had died in vain. In September 1981, after a cabinet reshuffle, James Prior took over at the NIO. Prior was deputized by Lord Gowrie, later suggested having &quot;quiet admiration for what he saw as the dying men&#x27;s misguided courage&quot;. Prior&#x27;s and Gowrie&#x27;s appointments to the Northern Ireland office led to what Hennessey has called a &quot;fissure&quot; in the strike. By now, all parties—British and republican—knew that the impetus for the strike&#x27;s continuation came from within, not outside of, the Maze. When Doherty died, critics of the strike became louder, and began pointing the finger at individuals such as Adams as having the power to end the strike. The priest who officiated at McElwee&#x27;s funeral harangued &quot;those that had called the hunger strike&quot; for not ending it: several mourners, including McAliskey, walked out in protest.

==Family interventions==
Gowrie was in a difficult position. He had to make it clear that government could not act under duress, or while a threat of violence hung over the proceedings. He was clear to the families, at a Stormont meeting on 28 September—a meeting that would have been unthinkable for both sides a few months earlier—that he would negotiate with the prisoners. But he also acknowledged to them that, in his view, there was much that could be done after the strike ended. The families represented McCarville, McElroy, Pickering, Hodgins, Quinn, McMullen and Sheehan. Gowrie was positive to them, although he urged them to make their views known publicly, not just to him. In the meantime, another three strikers—Pickering, Hodging and Devine—joined the fast, although, to some extent, this was soon to be counterbalanced. The first family to intervene in the strike was that of Paddy Quinn, whose mother requested medical support to save his life on 31 July. The following day Kevin Lynch died, followed by Kieran Doherty on 2 August, Thomas McElwee on 8 August and Michael Devine on 20 August. Not every family was willing to intervene. Doherty&#x27;s family complained that Catholic churchmen had split the families&#x27; united front, and rejected their involvement. The prisoners themselves considered that the influence of moderate nationalists was pervasive in their struggle. Devine was the last to die, on the same day as Carron&#x27;s election victory. Before he went into a coma, Devine rejected medical intervention, telling his sister, &quot;Now, there&#x27;s to be no needles&quot;.

On 4 September, the family of Matthew Devlin approved medical treatment, and he was taken to the Royal Victoria. Two days later, Laurence McKeown&#x27;s became the fourth family to intervene and ask for medical treatment to save his life; Cahal Daly issued a statement calling on prisoners to end the hunger strike. Liam McCloskey ended his strike on 26 September after his family said they would ask for medical intervention if he became unconscious, and it became clear that the families of the remaining hunger strikers would also intervene to save their lives. The NIO noted these early interventions as the &quot;first major setbacks&quot; in the strike: the impact of the strike was immediately lessened by the increasing likelihood that deaths would be avoided from then on. Bernard Fox was taken off on 24 September (he was &quot;dying too quickly&quot;), and Liam McCloskey took himself off two days later after family told him they would request intervention. Hunger striker John Pickering later recalled realising, by the end of September, that &quot;we were not persuading, and we would not be able to persuade, our families not to intervene&quot;. Another striker, Pat McGeown, argues that the families were susceptible because the later round of deaths—&quot;with no apparent critical situation and no crisis situation and no major attempts at negotiation&quot;—seemed to them increasingly pointless.

===Responses===
By 2 October it had become apparent that the family of every remaining hunger striker was intending to intervene when it became necessary. The strike was called off at 3:15 pm on 3 October. The time was deliberately chosen by the IRA leadership as the Sunday papers would have already gone to print by then, and the expected tabloid triumphalism would be more muted over 24 hours later. The prisoners&#x27; statement, penned by O&#x27;Rawe, &quot;keelhauled the Catholic Church, the SDLP and the Dublin government for letting down our fallen comrades&quot;. Morrison claimed that it had been &quot;subverted by people within the Irish establishment, by the SDLP, but particularly by the Irish hierarchy who are working on the emotions and putting moral pressure on the understandably distressed relatives&quot;. He also argued that the strikes had shown that the government—privately—recognised the IRA as a legitimate anti-imperialist army with whom they would have to negotiate someday. Unsurprisingly, Bernadette Devlin and Adams also both condemned the British government, while O&#x27;Fiaich called on the government to show &quot;generosity and compassion&quot;.

In Ireland, John Hulme also called for a magnanimous gesture from the British, while the Taoiseach called upon the IRA to abandon the armed struggle. In the north, the British Israelite Robert Bradford, of the UUP, accused Britain of making a deal with the IRA and granting them concessions, while his party leader, Molyneux, did not believe that any deals existed, but advised the government against being blackmailed into further concessions. The DUP were also &quot;gravely suspicious&quot; that a deal had been brokered. Thatcher, then in Australia, announced that she was &quot;delighted to hear that this waste of life is at an end&quot;. Labour MP Tony Benn criticised the actions of his own party, writing at the time, &quot;I was infuriated that Don Concannon, our Front Bench spokesman on Northern Ireland, should have gone to the Maze prison to interview the hunger strikers and then said on television that the Labour Party agreed 100 per cent with the Government and endorsed everything&quot;.

Three days later, Prior announced partial concessions to the prisoners, including the right to wear their own clothes at all times. Recreation was also addressed, with wings now being permitted to mingle in common areas and yards. The only one of the Five Demands still outstanding was the right not to do prison work. Following sabotage by the prisoners and the Maze Prison escape in 1983, the prison workshops were closed, effectively granting all of the Five Demands but without any formal recognition of political status from the government.

== Participants of the 1981 hunger strike ==
The original pathologist&#x27;s report recorded the hunger strikers&#x27; cause of death as &quot;self-imposed starvation&quot;. This was later amended to simply &quot;starvation&quot; after protests from the dead strikers&#x27; families. The coroner recorded verdicts of &quot;starvation, self-imposed&quot;. Although ten men died during the course of the hunger strike, thirteen others began refusing food but were taken off hunger strike, either for medical reasons after intervention by their families or because the strike was called off. Many of them still suffer from the effects of the strike, with problems including digestive, visual, physical and neurological disabilities.


== Aftermath ==

The British press hailed the hunger strike as a triumph for Thatcher, with &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper stating &quot;The Government had overcome the hunger strikes by a show of resolute determination not to be bullied&quot;. At the time most thought the hunger strike a crushing defeat for the republicans, a view shared by many within the IRA and Sinn Féin, but Sands&#x27; by-election win was a propaganda victory, and the hunger strike became a Pyrrhic victory for Thatcher and the British government. Indeed, Richard English has argued that Thatcher effectively &quot;breathed life&quot; back into the republican movement in 1981. Sands became a martyr to Irish republicans, while Thatcher became &quot;a republican hate figure of Cromwellian proportions&quot;, with Danny Morrison describing her as &quot;the biggest bastard we have ever known&quot;. Authors Jack Holland and Henry McDonald have speculated that Thatcher&#x27;s uncompromising attitude towards the hunger strikers may well have stemmed from losing her close friend and associate Airey Neave, who was assassinated by the INLA in the House of Commons underground car park a few months before her election.

As with internment in 1971 and Bloody Sunday in 1972, IRA recruitment was boosted with the hunger strike, resulting in a new surge of paramilitary activity, both a recruiting sergeant for new members and galvanising old members back into service; Thatcher&#x27;s uncompromising stance had alienated much of the nationalist community. This mass mobilisation also had the consequence of strengthening the northern—and younger—leadership of Adams, McGuinness and Morrison against the old guard as represented in Dublin by O&#x27;Bradaigh and O&#x27;Connell. There was an upsurge of violence after the comparatively quiet years of the late 1970s, with widespread civil disorder in Northern Ireland and rioting outside the British Embassy in Dublin. Security forces fired 29,695 plastic bullets in 1981, causing seven deaths, compared to a total of around 16,000 bullets and four deaths in the eight years following the hunger strikes. The problem for the government was that it effectively lost a propaganda war. As Professor Robert Savage puts it, &quot;television images of emaciated Christ-like figures with long hair and beards confined to hospital beds contrasted with the stern countenance of the intransigent prime minister&quot;. The modern historian Ian Miller argues that this kind of imagery was powerful on two levels. Firstly, in representing self-sacrifice, it enabled the narrative to shift from the prisoners&#x27; portrayals as terrorists to martyrs, and forced reconsideration of terms such as &quot;terrorist&quot;. Secondly, by fermenting the street violence that the hunger strikes did, international attention was drawn to their treatment: &quot;Meanings became attached to Sands&#x27;s withered body; his corpse became politically encoded. Both his hunger strike and death provided a public spectacle.&quot; Irish politics was further polarised, and McKitterick and McVea have argued to great extent:

Three years later, the IRA tried to take their revenge on Thatcher with the Brighton hotel bombing, an attack on the Conservative party conference that killed five people and in which Thatcher herself only narrowly escaped death. Yet in her memoirs, 30 years later, Thatcher wrote that she found it possible &quot;to admire the courage of Sands and the other hunger strikers who died but not to sympathise with their murderous cause&quot;.

The hunger strike resulted in the republican movement taking public relations more seriously. More importantly, in the long run, it prompted Sinn Féin to move towards electoral politics. Sands&#x27;s election victory, combined with that of pro-hunger strike candidates in the Northern Ireland local elections and Dáil elections in the Republic of Ireland, gave birth to the Armalite and ballot box strategy. The IRA and Sinn Féin achieved an ideological cohesion they had never before. Adams remarked that Sands&#x27;s victory &quot;exposed the lie that the hunger strikers—and by extension the IRA and the whole republican movement—had no popular support&quot;. The following year, Sinn Féin won five seats in the elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly, and in 1983 Adams won a seat in the UK general election. As a result of the political base built during the hunger strike, Sinn Féin continued to grow in the following two decades. After the 2001 United Kingdom general election, it became the largest nationalist party in Northern Ireland. It has been argued that the hunger strikes are part of a deliberate Sinn Féin tactic of preserving the past in the party&#x27;s favour: simplified to &quot;a cause, political status, and the recognition of their struggle for a united Ireland&quot;, albeit by a &quot;selective and reductive&quot; process. As several groups could claim legitimate heritage from the men of 1981, this made it all the more imperative that Sinn Féin&#x27;s version became the accepted paradigm.

Internationally, the hunger strikes encouraged similar protests from imprisoned radicals, including members of the ANC on Robben Island, in Diyarbakır in Kurdistan, and Chiapas, Mexico. These were followed by outbreaks from Kurds in Turkish jails and Basques in Spain.

===Challenge to the Adams/Morrison paradigm===
Four years later, however, 2005 was a difficult year for the republican movement. What the author R. K. Walker has called a &quot;blitzkrieg of propaganda&quot; erupted just before Sinn Féin contested the 2005 UK General Election. New allegations of IRA brutality emerged, including punishment beatings, protection and its role in the Northern Bank robbery of December 2004, and the killing of Robert McCartney in February 2005. These issues were, however, argues Walker, only short-term problems. The same year, allegations were made against the republican leadership which &quot;called into question [its] integrity&quot;. These were more serious. Walker continues that, although no one suggests that the author, Richard O&#x27;Rawe, chose that particular moment to publish his book, &quot;the timing struck many republicans as unfortunate&quot;. O&#x27;Rawe questioned the role Adams played in the strike, and whether he manipulated it for political ends. O&#x27;Rawe, himself a prisoner and a blanketman, had been the public relations officer inside the prison during the strike. O&#x27;Rawe states in his book &quot;Blanketmen&quot; that Adams prolonged the strike as it was of great political benefit to Sinn Féin and allowed Owen Carron to win Sands&#x27;s seat:
 O&#x27;Rawe&#x27;s argument is effectively that the same offer as was eventually accepted after ten men had died was the same—&quot;or better&quot;—than the prison leadership had supposedly turned down in June, after McDonnell&#x27;s death, which allegedly offered four out of the five demands. Father Denis Faul had suspected something similar at the time, although this was denied by several hunger strikers and Brendan McFarlane, who was OC inside the prison during the hunger strike. O&#x27;Rawe&#x27;s account has been described by the historian Richard English as &quot;explosive&quot; and by F. S. Ross as &quot;highly contested&quot;. O&#x27;Rawe claims that he and McFarlane discussed it in Irish and believed it was acceptable on behalf of the prisoners. However, this was rejected in a message from the outside leadership stating that it was insufficient for four men to have already died for. Those that remained on hunger strike, being unaware of the alleged offer and &quot;weighed down by the deaths of their comrades and the fear that ending the protest in such circumstances would amount to betrayal, they decided to carry on&quot;. Richard English also believes that a &quot;substantial British offer was indeed available&quot; before McDonnell&#x27;s death; the question, he argues is not so much whether the evidence exists but whether it bears the weight of the claim that it was good enough to accept in June 1981. Ed Moloney has also stated that he &quot;believed [O&#x27;Rawe&#x27;s] account from the moment I heard it... It made complete sense to me&quot;. Moloney had been sceptical of the leadership&#x27;s line at the time, when he was Northern Editor for &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, that the prisoners were in charge and that the external leadership operated under their didact. Moloney argues that not only did the continued deaths &quot;keep the pot boiling on the streets&quot;, but it aligned with a growing body of thought within Sinn Féin that the party should become political and electorally attractive.

O&#x27;Rawe&#x27;s suggestion, however, has been &quot;sharply rejected&quot; by Sinn Féin, says the political journalist Deaglán de Bréadún. McFarlane states O&#x27;Rawe&#x27;s version of events is confused and fragmentary, and states &quot;we were desperate for a solution. Any deal that went some way to meeting the five demands would have been taken. If it was confirmed in writing, we&#x27;d have grabbed it... There was never a deal, there was never a &quot;take it or leave it&quot; option at all&quot;. Likewise McKeown has suggested that &quot;Richard has frozen a moment in time&quot;, and argues that while there were many hints at offers to come, nothing was in writing, and that at the time &quot;unless it&#x27;s in writing, it&#x27;s not an offer&quot;. Adams has personally stated that he was effectively impotent over the prisoners&#x27; tactics in 1981, later revealing that, when an unnamed hunger striker&#x27;s father &quot;begged him to do something to save his son, Adams replied &#x27;I can&#x27;t, but you can&#x27;&quot;. Although O&#x27;Rawe&#x27;s thesis has not met with universal agreement, the author Andrew Sanders has argued that the existing narrative was &quot;all changed&quot; as a result. O&#x27;Rawe&#x27;s arguments were subsequently backed by a hunger striker, Gerard Hodgins, who told Sanders:

== Commemorations ==

A memorial to the men who died in the Irish Rebellion of 1798, the Easter Rising, and the hunger strike stands in Waverley Cemetery, Sydney, Australia, which is also the burial place of Michael Dwyer of the Society of United Irishmen. In 1997 NORAID&#x27;s Hartford Unit in the United States dedicated a monument to Sands and the other hunger strikers, &quot;the only one of its kind in America&quot;, notes Wharton. 

In 2001, Sinn Féin&#x27;s 20th-anniversary commemoration committee focussed on a diverse range of events. On 3 October 2001—the 20th anniversary of the end of the hunger strike—a memorial was unveiled by Adams, Patrick Sheehan and Ahmed Kathrada, on Robben Island, South Africa. The inscription reads, &quot;To political prisoners who suffered and died as a result of hunger strikes in prison in Ireland and South Africa&quot;. In December that year, Adams attended the unveiling of a commemoration to the strikers in Havana, Cuba, which was attended by Fidel Castro, whom Adams thanked for Castro&#x27;s public support of the hunger strike at the time.

In 2011, Sinn Féin launched a thirty-year anniversary exhibition of the hunger strike at the Linen Hall, Belfast; mild criticism came from one DUP politician, Lord Browne, who emphasised its &quot;highly sensitive&quot; nature. Similar exhibitions were held across the country, involving several different media, and ranging from sculptures by Irish artists to rebuilding a makeshift H-Block cell on the Falls Road but also including more symbolic events, such as tree planting ceremonies.

==Cultural depictions==

There have been many representations of Irish history and politics in culture, and the 1981 hunger strike is no different; many songs and ballads were written during and immediately after the strike. In 1920, during the War of Independence Daniel Corkery, the republican politician, argued that &quot;Any great movement toward a spiritual end, such as Ireland&#x27;s push for freedom... endows itself with creative power&quot;. This is especially true of hunger striking, where the scholar George Sweeney noted, the &quot;meshing of religious practice with aspirations of nationalism and militant republicanism&quot;; in other words, quasi-religious self-sacrifice and immortality in song. Notable songs in the genre are Francie Brolly’s &#x27;The H-Block Song&#x27;—to which Sands&#x27;s coffin was carried through West Belfast—&#x27;Bobby Sands MP&#x27;, and &#x27;The Time Has Come&#x27;, which relates the story of O&#x27;Hara meeting his mother for the last time. Others include &#x27;Joe McDonnell&#x27;, on the fifth striker; &#x27;Roll of Honour&#x27;, on the collective; &#x27;The People&#x27;s Own MP&#x27;, on Sands&#x27;s election; &#x27;Farewell to Bellaghy&#x27; and Christy Moore&#x27;s &#x27;The Boy from Tamlaghtduff&#x27;, both on Hughes. Moore—a high profile supporter of the H-Block protests—also put to music two of Sands&#x27;s own compositions, &#x27;I Wish I Was Back Home in Derry&#x27; and &#x27;McIlhatton&#x27; and released them in his 1986 album, &quot;The Spirit of Freedom&quot;. In the former, Sands draws direct comparison between the transported revolutionaries of the failed 1803 rebellion with the prison struggles of the present day. When Sands died, the Derry punk group The Undertones were in London recording their song &#x27;It&#x27;s Going to Happen!&#x27; for Top of the Pops. The song was inspired by the hunger strike, and the guitarist wore a black armband.

In visual culture, wall murals—often painted on the gable ends of terraces—have been an important method of communities on both sides of the sectarian divide to transmit history and ideology to the viewer, and statements of resistance. The hunger strikes were no different; indeed, it was from the H-Block and hunger strike that the first murals emerged. One of the first and most significant mural artists, Gerard &quot;Mó Chara&quot; Kelly, was imprisoned in the Maze while the struggles took place, and has acknowledged their influence on his subsequent work. There are memorials and murals in memory of the hunger strikers in towns and cities across Ireland. In the cities, these include Belfast—where a smiling Sands fills an external wall of the Falls Road Sinn Fein office; Dublin, with Yann Goulet&#x27;s 1983 granite sculpture in Glasnevin Cemetery; and Derry, which gained a new mural in 2000, from the Bogside Artists, depicting local 1980 hunger striker Raymond McCartney as a &quot;Christ-like&quot; figure alongside an anonymous female striker in Armagh, who looks similar to the Irish famine victims as illustrated by the &quot;London Evening News&quot; at the time. The historian Agnés Maillot has argued that, while films such as &quot;H3&quot; and the play &quot;Diary of a Hunger Strike&quot; were not actually commissioned by Sinn Féin, the party intended the hunger strikes—and the party&#x27;s dominant role in them—to become &quot;part not just of the Irish political identity, but of the cultural identity as well&quot;.

Apart from non-fictional documentaries (such as BBC NI&#x27;s 25th anniversary &quot;The Hunger Strike&quot;, directed by Margo Harkin), the hunger strike has been the background to several major films. For example, Les Blair&#x27;s &quot;H3&quot;—co-written by former IRA prisoners Brian Campbell and Laurence McKeown, the latter also a 1981 hunger striker—recounts the events leading up to as well as during the strike, and has been described as both a commemoration and the product of commemoration in the way it treats human memory as historical record. 2001&#x27;s &quot;Silent Grace&quot;, from Maeve Murphy tells the story of the republican women on the first hunger strike in Armagh, and stars Orla Brady as the block OC. In 2008 Steve McQueen directed &quot;Hunger&quot;, starring Michael Fassbender as Sands and Liam Cunningham as Father Dominic Moran. The film is almost completely silent, except for sound effects and occasional dialogue (the first instance of which is 30 minutes into the film). &quot;Some Mother&#x27;s Son&quot;, directed by Terry George, starring Helen Mirren, Fionnula Flanagan as the two mothers and Aidan Gillen and David O&#x27;Hara as their imprisoned sons. Gerard McSorley plays the mediating and condemnatory Father Daly. The film explores how two mothers, divided by class and politics, respond to their sons&#x27; IRA involvement and their joining the hunger strike. Stephen Burke&#x27;s half-hour &quot;″81&quot;, set in the final days of Sands&#x27;s strike, displays the differing viewpoints through two families, one from each side of the political divide.

<text>TU Dresden (for , abbreviated as TUD), also as the Dresden University of Technology, is a public research university in Dresden, Germany. It is the largest institute of higher education in the city of Dresden, the largest university in Saxony and one of the 10 largest universities in Germany with 32,389 students .

The name Technische Universität Dresden has only been used since 1961; the history of the university, however, goes back nearly 200 years to 1828. This makes it one of the oldest colleges of technology in Germany, and one of the country&#x27;s oldest universities, which in German today refers to institutes of higher education that cover the entire curriculum. The university is a member of TU9, a consortium of the nine leading German Institutes of Technology. The university is one of eleven German universities which succeeded in the Excellence Initiative in 2012, thus getting the title of a &quot;University of Excellence&quot;. The TU Dresden succeeded in all three rounds of the German Universities Excellence Initiative (Future Concept, Graduate Schools, Clusters of Excellence).

==History==
In 1828, with emerging industrialization, the Saxon Technical School was founded to educate skilled workers in technological subjects such as mechanics, mechanical engineering and ship construction. In 1871, the year the German Empire was founded, the institute was renamed the Royal Saxon Polytechnic Institute (). At that time, subjects not connected with technology, such as history and languages, were introduced. By the end of the 19th century the institute had developed into a university covering all disciplines. The school was named Technische Hochschule since 1919, it was given its present name, (&quot;TU Dresden&quot;) in 1961.

===Nazi rules===
Alfred Baeumler declared his Nazi views in 1932 and moved to Berlin in 1933.
Nazi German Student Union organised a book burning at the Bismarck Column on Räcknitzhöhe in 1933. 
Victor Klemperer, Gustav Kafka, Richard Seyfert, Hans Gehrig were expelled or forced to resign. Richard von Mises, Paul Tillich, Harry Dember had to emigrate.

===GDR===
Students of the university were tried in two 1959 political trials.
The third reform of universities took place in 1968. 
The university has integrated the Dresden College of Engineering () in 1986.

===After reunification===

Upon German reunification in 1990, the university had already integrated the College of Forestry (), formerly the Royal Saxony Academy of Forestry, in the nearby small town of Tharandt. This was followed by the integration of the Friedrich List College of Transport () the faculty of transport science, and the &quot;Carl-Gustav Carus&quot; Medical Academy ( or MedAk for short), the medical faculty. Some faculties were newly founded: the faculties of Information Technology (1991), Law (1991), Education (1993) and Economics (1993).

In 2009 TU Dresden, all Dresden institutes of the Fraunhofer Society, the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community and the Max Planck Society and Forschungszentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, soon incorporated into the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres, published a joint letter of intent with the name – Dresden Research and Education Synergies for the Development of Excellence and Novelty, which points out worldwide elite aspirations, which was recognized as the first time that all four big post-gradual elite institutions declared campus co-operation with a university.

==Campus==

TU Dresden is a campus university in most aspects. Some of its buildings are more than a hundred years old (such as the buildings around Muenchner Platz square). The architecture of these buildings is mostly influenced by the art nouveau style or the Bauhaus school (e.g. the chemistry building ). In recent years these historic buildings have been complemented by modern buildings (e.g. the library, the main auditorium, the biochemistry department or the life sciences building).

The main campus, as well as the medical faculty and that of computer science, are all within the boundaries of the city of Dresden. The main campus is located south of the city center, mostly in the area bordered by Nöthnitzer Straße, Fritz-Förster-Platz and Münchner Platz; the medical faculty can be found in the Johannstadt district. The faculty of forestry, formerly the Royal Saxon Academy of Forestry, resides in a forest area in the nearby town of Tharandt.

==Organization==
TU Dresden has 17 faculties. Almost all faculties are located on the main campus south of the city center, except for the Faculty of Medicine that has its own campus near the Elbe river East of the city center and the Department of Forestry in Tharandt.

===Sciences===
The school of sciences is composed of five faculties: Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics and Psychology. The faculties are all located on the main campus. In 2006, a new research building for the biology department opened. In October 2006 the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft decided to fund a new graduate school, the &quot;Dresden International Graduate School for Biomedicine and Bioengineering&quot; and a so-called cluster of excellence &quot;From Cells to Tissues to Therapies&quot;.

<text>Lauri Aleksanteri Lehtinen (10 August 1908 – 4 December 1973) was a Finnish long-distance runner and the winner of a controversial 5000 m race at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.

Lehtinen set a new world record in the 5000 m (14:17.0) just a month before the Olympics, making him a leading favorite for the Olympic 5000 m title. In the final, Lehtinen and fellow Finn Lauri Virtanen led the race early, eventually distancing themselves from all competitors except Ralph Hill of the United States. The race soon became a duel between Lehtinen and Hill. On the last lap, Hill attempted to overtake Lehtinen, who blocked him by zig-zagging across lanes—a common tactic in Europe but unfamiliar to the American audience, who responded with boos. Lehtinen narrowly won by 50 centimeters, with both runners recording identical times of 14:30.0. Hill declined to protest the result. This remains the only Olympic race longer than 200 meters where the top two finishers recorded identical times.

Lehtinen won the British AAA Championships title in the 3-mile event at the 1933 AAA Championships.

At the 1936 Summer Olympics, Lehtinen attempted to defend his title but finished second to fellow Finn Gunnar Höckert.

In 1940, Lehtinen donated his Los Angeles gold medal to a soldier who had served with distinction on the Karelian Isthmus. This gesture honored Höckert, who was killed in action on the Isthmus.

In the village of Kerkkoo in Porvoo, a road is named in his honor: &quot;Lauri Lehtisen Tie.&quot;

<text>Ellen Mary Clerke (26 September 1840 – 2 March 1906) was an Irish poet, linguist and a journalist. Originally from County Cork in Ireland, Clerke was educated in Italy. She wrote in English and Italian, publishing works on astronomy, travel, and poetry. Her journalistic works, including on European politics and current affairs, were published in several magazines in the 1880s and 1890s. Clerke died in London in 1906.

== Early life ==
She was the daughter of Catherine Mary Deasy, whose father was a wealthy brewer and shipbuilder in the town of Clonakilty, County Cork, and John William Clerke (c. 1814–1890), a bank manager of Anglo-Irish descent in Skibbereen, and later a registrar for his brother-in-law, Richard Morgan Deasy, a High-Court judge.

Clerke and her younger sister, Agnes, were home-schooled by their parents, particularly by their father in the areas of classical languages and mathematics, which featured heavily in their education.
At the age of 27, Clerke moved to Florence, Italy with her sister to continue their educations. Ellen Clerke&#x27;s primary interest was Italian history and literature. She became an accomplished linguist. 

With the linguistic skills she acquired from moving to Italy, she translated Italian poetry and also wrote her own. Aside from translating and writing poems in Italian, she also wrote travel articles and published monographs on two planets -- one on Jupiter in 1892 and one on Venus in 1893. Aside from Italian, she also learned German and wrote articles in that language and also learned how to read in Arabic.

==Work==
Ellen Clerke published a significant volume of content throughout her life. For twenty years, she wrote frequently for &quot;The Tablet&quot; and also published many travel logs for the &quot;Dublin Review&quot; for twenty five years. She became one of the magazine&#x27;s most celebrated journalists, writing many articles on current affairs including &quot;Madagascar Past and Present&quot; (1884), &quot;The Crisis in Rhodesia&quot; (1896) and &quot;Maritime Canals&quot; (1885). 

Ellen&#x27;s younger sister, Agnes, wrote frequently for an astronomical journal called &quot;Observatory&quot;, and she encouraged Ellen to contribute to the same journal. Ellen Clerke was also a poet, having published several works of poetry during her life. &quot;The Flying Dutchmen&quot;, a poem which has been out of print for some time, was one of her most famous works. Clerke spent a long period of her life in Florence, Italy, and the Italian culture was a great source of inspiration to her, prompting her to write a book of verse-translations, &quot;Fable and Song in Italy&quot;, published in 1899, and a novel, &quot;Flowers of Fire&quot;, a story set in Naples. The novel was published in the years leading up to Clerke&#x27;s death, but was not well received. One review states, &quot;This story is interesting, as proving that neither Polish conspiracies nor Neapolitan courtships can fill the dreary void left in a novel by the absence of men and women... [the characters] are distinguished from each other only by some external badge, such as yellow hair or a hot temper, and by the single hard black line that marks off the good characters from the bad.&quot; 

In addition to contributing a number of biographical entries to the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, works by Ellen Mary Clerke include:
* The Flying Dutchman and Other Poems (London: Satchell &amp; Co. 1881), another ed. (1882); 
* Jupiter and His System (London: Edward Stanford 1892); 
* Translations of poetry in R. Garnett, History of Italian Literature (London: Hutchinson 1902); 
* Fable and Song in Italy (London: Grant Richards 1899); 
* Flowers of Fire (London: Hutchinson 1902).

==Later life==
After ten years in Italy, the family moved to London in 1877. There, Clerke took up a post as a journalist at the &quot;Dublin Review&quot;, a Roman Catholic newspaper. From 1885, Clerke also wrote about Italian and German politics as a permanent editor at the weekly &quot;Tablet&quot; - a position she held until her death. Ellen Mary Clerke died of pneumonia at her home in South Kensington on 2 March 1906, aged 65, following a short illness.

<text>Oxleas Wood is one of the few remaining areas of ancient deciduous forest in Eltham in the Royal Borough of Greenwich (with a small amount passing over the boundary into the London Borough of Bexley), in southeast London. Some parts date back over 8,000 years to the end of the last ice age, the Younger Dryas. It is part of a larger continuous area of woodland and parkland on the south side of Shooter&#x27;s Hill: other parts are Jack Wood, Castle Wood (home to Severndroog Castle), Oxleas Meadows, Falconwood Field, Eltham Common and Eltham Park North (the latter being divided by the A2 main road from its southern section). Eltham Park North includes the ancient Shepherdleas Wood. 
==History==
In 1311, the Royal manor of Eltham was established and this included the woods.
The woods were leased to Sir John Shaw, 2nd Baronet, from crown occupation in 1679. His family managed them until 1811, when they were taken over by the War Department. 
The woods were then acquired by the London County Council for the use of public recreation in 1930, and then opened to the public in 1934. 
Ownership then passed from the Greater London Council to the Borough of Greenwich on abolition of the GLC in 1986.

In 1993 plans for an East London River Crossing that would have cut through Oxleas Wood were withdrawn following opposition from local residents. People Against the River Crossing (PARC), the road protest group formed to oppose the crossing, comprised local residents, with support from established environmental organisations, radical environmentalists and pagans. The campaign&#x27;s objective was to halt the road scheme, by using all possible means within the established institutional framework. This involved 2 public inquiries and PARC&#x27;s complaint to the European Commission, reinforced by legal action in conjunction with Greenwich Council, which led to the abandonment of the road project. Over 3,000 people and organisations signed a pledge in which they promised to engage in civil disobedience to defend the woodland.

==Description==

Oxleas Wood, Jack Wood and Shepherdleas Wood are a Site of Special Scientific Interest called Oxleas Woodlands, covering 72 hectares with oak, silver birch, hornbeam, coppice hazel, and a great number of fine samples of the Wild Service Tree. A larger area including Eltham Common is designated a Local Nature Reserve called Oxleas/Shooters Hill Woodlands.

The site covers most of the top of Shooters Hill (in the Royal Borough of Greenwich).

There is an underground water reservoir in the grassed area called Oxleas Meadow. This serves the local area with water. This is associated with &#x27;the hut&#x27; which is a building containing the equipment that Thames Water uses to control the reservoir. Several streams begin within Oxleas Wood, the longest being the &quot;Wogebourne&quot; which eventually joins the River Thames after flowing . 

Within Oxleas Meadow is a cafe. The café building is of brick construction and is owned by the Borough of Greenwich. Public male and female toilets are also located in this building and are available for use during the café opening hours. The café part of the building is leased to the café operator.

Within the woods there is a thriving honeybee apiary, the Oxleas Wood Apiary which was managed by the late apiarist John Large obit.

<doc id="827069" wikidata="Q806378" url="?curid=827069" title="Bandsaw">
<text>A bandsaw (also written band saw) is a power saw with a long, sharp blade consisting of a continuous band of toothed metal stretched between two or more wheels to cut material. They are used principally in woodworking, metalworking, and lumbering, but may cut a variety of materials. Advantages include uniform cutting action as a result of an evenly distributed tooth load, and the ability to cut irregular or curved shapes like a jigsaw. The minimum radius of a curve is determined by the width of the band and its kerf. Most bandsaws have two wheels rotating in the same plane, one of which is powered, although some may have three or four to distribute the load. The blade itself can come in a variety of sizes and tooth pitches (teeth per inch, or TPI), which enables the machine to be highly versatile and able to cut a wide variety of materials including wood, metal and plastic. Band saw is recommended for use in cutting metal as it produces much less toxic fumes and particulates when compared with angle grinder and reciprocating saw.

Almost all bandsaws today are powered by an electric motor. Line shaft versions were once common but are now antiques.

==History==
The idea of the bandsaw dates back to at least 1809, when William Newberry received a British patent for the idea, but bandsaws remained impractical largely because of the inability to produce accurate and durable blades using the technology of the day. Constant flexing of the blade over the wheels caused either the material or the joint welding it into a loop to fail.

Nearly 40 years passed before Frenchwoman Anne Paulin Crepin devised a welding technique overcoming this hurdle. She applied for a patent in 1846, and soon afterward sold the right to employ it to manufacturer A. Perin &amp; Company of Paris. Combining this method with new steel alloys and advanced tempering techniques allowed Perin to create the first modern bandsaw blade.

The first American bandsaw patent was granted to Benjamin Barker of Ellsworth, Maine, in January 1836. The first factory produced and commercially available bandsaw in the U.S. was by a design of Paul Prybil.

Power hacksaws (with reciprocating blades) were once common in the metalworking industries, but bandsaws and cold saws have mostly displaced them.

==Types==
===Residential and light industry===
Many workshops in residential garages or basements and in light industry contain small or medium-sized bandsaws that can cut wood, metal, or plastic. Often a general-purpose blade is left in place, although blades optimized for wood or metal can be switched out when volume of use warrants. Most residential and commercial bandsaws are of the vertical type mounted on a bench or a cabinet stand. Portable power tool versions, including cordless models, are also common in recent decades, allowing building contractors to bring them along on the truck to the jobsite.

===Meat cutting===
Saws for cutting meat are typically of all stainless steel construction with easy to clean features. The blades either have fine teeth with heat treated tips, or have plain or scalloped knife edges.

===Metal fabrication shop and machine shop models===
Bandsaws dedicated to industrial metal-cutting use, such as for structural steel in fabrication shops and for bar stock in machine shops, are available in vertical and horizontal designs. Typical band speeds range from to , although specialized bandsaws are built for friction cutting of hard metals and run band speeds of . Metal-cutting bandsaws are usually equipped with brushes or brushwheels to prevent chips from becoming stuck in between the blade&#x27;s teeth. Systems which cool the blade with cutting fluid are also common equipment on metal-cutting bandsaws. The coolant washes away swarf and keeps the blade cool and lubricated.

Horizontal bandsaws hold the workpiece stationary while the blade swings down through the cut. This configuration is used to cut long materials such as pipe or bar stock to length. Thus it is an important part of the facilities in most machine shops. The horizontal design is not useful for cutting curves or complicated shapes. Small horizontal bandsaws typically employ a gravity feed alone, retarded to an adjustable degree by a coil spring; on industrial models, the rate of descent is usually controlled by a hydraulic cylinder that bleeds through an adjustable valve. When the saw is set up for a cut, the operator raises the saw, positions the material to be cut underneath the blade, and then turns on the saw. The blade slowly descends into the material, cutting it as the band blade moves. When the cut is complete, a switch is tripped and the saw automatically turns off. More sophisticated versions of this type of saw are partially or entirely automated (via PLC or CNC) for high-volume cutting of machining blanks. Such machines provide a stream of cutting fluid recirculated from a sump, in the same manner that a CNC machining center does.

A vertical bandsaw, also called a contour saw, keeps the blade&#x27;s path stationary while the workpiece is moved across it. This type of saw can be used to cut out complex shapes and angles. The part may be fed into the blade manually or with a power assist mechanism. This type of metal-cutting bandsaw is often equipped with a built-in blade welder. This not only allows the operator to repair broken blades or fabricate new blades quickly, but also allows for the blade to be purposely cut, routed through the center of a part, and re-welded in order to make interior cuts. These saws are often fitted with a built-in air blower to cool the blade and to blow chips away from the cut area giving the operator a clear view of the work. This type of saw is also built in a woodworking version. The woodworking type is generally of much lighter construction and does not incorporate a power feed mechanism, coolant, or welder.

Advancements have also been made in the bandsaw blades used to cut metals. Bimetal blades with high speed steel teeth, including cobalt grades, are now the norm. The development of new tooth geometries and tooth pitches has produced increased production rates and greater blade life. New materials and processes such as M51 steel and the cryogenic treatment of blades have produced results that were thought impossible just a few years ago. New machines have been developed to automate the welding process of bandsaw blades as well.

===Timber cutting===
Timber mills use very large bandsaws for ripping lumber; they are preferred over circular saws for ripping because they can accommodate large-diameter timber and because of their smaller (cut size), resulting in less waste.

There are also small portable sawmills consisting of a shop-size bandsaw mounted on a guiding table, which are called bandsaw mills (band saw mills, band sawmills). Like chain saw mills (a chainsaw on a guiding table), they can be used inexpensively by one or two people out in the field.

In a full-size sawmill, the blades are mounted on wheels with a diameter large enough not to cause metal fatigue due to flexing when the blade repeatedly changes from a circular to a straight profile. It is stretched very tight (with fatigue strength of the saw metal being the limiting factor). Bandsaws of this size need to have a deformation worked into them that counteracts the forces and heating of operation. This is called &quot;benching&quot;. They also need to be removed and serviced at regular intervals. Sawfilers or sawdoctors are the craftsmen responsible for this work.

The shape of the tooth gullet is highly optimized and designed by the sawyer and sawfiler. It varies according to the mill, as well as the type and condition of the wood. Frozen logs often require a &quot;frost notch&quot; ground into the gullet to break the chips. The shape of the tooth gullet is created when the blade is manufactured and its shape is automatically maintained with each sharpening. The sawfiler will need to maintain the grinding wheel&#x27;s profile with periodic dressing of the wheel.

Proper tracking of the blade is crucial to accurate cutting and considerably reduces blade breakage. The first step to ensuring good tracking is to check that the two bandwheels or flywheels are co-planar. This can be done by placing a straightedge across the front of the wheels and adjusting until each wheel touches. Rotate the wheels with the blade in position and properly tensioned and check that the tracking is correct. Now install the blade guide rollers and leave a gap of about 1 mm between the back of the blade and the guide flange. The teeth of blades that have become narrow through repeated sharpening will foul the front edge of the guide rollers due to their kerf set and force the blade out of alignment. This can be remedied by cutting of a small step on the rollers&#x27; front edges to accommodate the protruding teeth. Ideally the rollers should be crowned, (see belt_and_pulley_systems) a configuration that assists in the proper tracking of bands and belts, at the same time allowing clearance for the set of the teeth.

====Head saws====
Head saws are large bandsaws that make the initial cuts in a log. They generally have a tooth space on the cutting edge and &quot;sliver teeth&quot; on the back. Sliver teeth are non-cutting teeth designed to wipe slivers out of the way when the blade needs to back out of a cut.

==== Resaws ====
A resaw is a large bandsaw optimized for cutting timber along the grain to reduce larger sections into smaller sections or veneers. Resawing veneers requires a wide blade—commonly —with a small kerf to minimize waste. Resaw blades of up to may be fitted to a standard bandsaw.

====Double cut saws====
Double cut saws have cutting teeth on both sides. They are generally very large, similar in size to a head saw.

==Construction==
===Feed mechanisms===
* Gravity feed saws fall under their own weight. Most such saws have a method to allow the cutting force to be adjusted, such as a movable counterbalancing weight, a coil spring with a screw-thread adjustment, or a hydraulic or pneumatic damper (speed control valve). The latter does not force the blade downwards, but rather simply limits the speed at which the saw can fall, preventing excessive feed on thin or soft parts. This is analogous to door closer hardware whose damping action keeps the door from slamming. Gravity feed designs are common in small saws.
* Hydraulic feed saws use a positive pressure hydraulic piston to advance the saw through the work at variable pressure and rate. Common in production saws.
* Screw feed saws employ a leadscrew to move the saw.

===Fall mechanisms===
* Pivot saws hinge in an arc as they advance through the work.
* Single column saws have a large diameter column that the entire saw rides up and down on, very similar to a drill press.
* Dual column saws have a pair of large columns, one on either side of the work, for very high rigidity and precision. The dual column setup is unable to make use of a miter base due to inherent design. Dual column saws are the largest variety of machine bandsaws encountered, to the point where some make use of a rotary table and X axis to perform complex cutting.

===Automated saws===
Automatic bandsaws feature preset feed rate, return, fall, part feeding, and part clamping. These are used in production environments where having a machine operator per saw is not practical. One operator can feed and unload many automatic saws.

Some automatic saws rely on numerical control to not only cut faster, but to be more precise and perform more complex miter cuts.

===Common tooth forms===
* Precision blade gives accurate cuts with a smooth finish.
* Buttress blade provides faster cutting and large chip loads.
* Claw tooth blade gives additional clearance for fast cuts and soft material.

At least two teeth must be in contact with the workpiece at all times to avoid stripping off the teeth.

<text>RMS &quot;Oceanic&quot; was a transatlantic ocean liner built for the White Star Line. She sailed on her maiden voyage on 6 September 1899 and was the largest ship in the world until 1901. At the outbreak of World War I she was converted into an armed merchant cruiser. On 8 August 1914 she was commissioned into Royal Navy service.

On 25 August 1914, the newly designated HMS &quot;Oceanic&quot; departed Southampton to patrol the waters from the North Scottish mainland to Faroe. On 8 September she ran aground and was wrecked off the island of Foula, in the Shetland Islands.

==Background==
In the late 1890s the White Star Line&#x27;s existing flagship ocean liners and both launched in 1889, had become outmoded due to rapid advances in marine technology: Their competitors, the Cunard Line, had introduced the and in 1893, and from 1897 the German Norddeutscher Lloyd began introducing four new s beginning with . In order to compete with these ships the White Star Line needed to produce a new flagship which could rival them.

==Design and construction==
The RMS &quot;Oceanic&quot; was built at Harland and Wolff’s Queen&#x27;s Island yard at Belfast, as was the tradition with White Star Line ships, and her keel was laid down in 1897. 
She used the luxury over speed strategy, which first began with the &quot;Cymric&quot; in 1897. She was named after their first successful liner of 1870, and was to be the first ship to exceed Brunel&#x27;s in length, although not in tonnage. At 17,272 gross register tons, the future &quot;Queen of the Ocean&quot; cost one million pounds sterling and required 1,500 shipwrights to complete. However, &quot;Oceanic&quot; was not designed to be the fastest ship afloat or compete for the Blue Riband, as it was the White Star Line&#x27;s policy to focus on size and comfort rather than speed. &quot;Oceanic&quot; was designed for a service speed of . She was powered by two four-cylinder triple expansion engines, which were when constructed the largest of their type in the world, and could produce .
In order to build the ship a new 500 ton overhead gantry crane had to be constructed at the yard in order to lift the material necessary for the ship&#x27;s construction. Another innovation was the use of hydraulic riveting machines, which were used for the first time at Harland and Wolff during her construction.

&quot;Oceanic&quot;″s bridge was integrated with her superstructure, giving her a clean fluid look; this design feature would be omitted from the next big four White Star ships, , , and , with their odd but distinguishable &#x27;island&#x27; bridges. &quot;Nothing but the very finest&quot; was Ismay&#x27;s policy toward this new venture. The architect Richard Norman Shaw was employed as the consultant for the design of much of the interiors of the ship, which were lavishly decorated in the first-class sections. 

&quot;Oceanic&quot; was built to accommodate 1,710 passengers: 410 First Class, 300 Second Class and 1,000 Third Class, plus 349 crew. In his autobiography &quot;Titanic and Other Ships&quot;, Charles Lightoller gives an account of what it was like to be an officer on this vessel.

Her passenger accommodations were laid out in a manner similar to that of &quot;Teutonic&quot; and &quot;Majestic&quot;, with First Class amidships, Second Class situated at the aft end of the superstructure and Third Class divided at the forward and aft ends of the vessel on four decks; Promenade, Upper, Saloon and Main. First Class occupied spaces on all four decks, most of which was dedicated to an array of spacious and comfortable single, two-berth and three-berth cabins. There was a library on the Promenade Deck and a smoke room at the aft end of the Upper Deck, with the most impressive feature being the elegant dome which capped the First Class dining room on the Saloon Deck. The First Class Dining Room boasted both a piano and an organ. There were berths for valets and ladies&#x27; maids in close proximity to the first class accommodation.

Similar to what was seen aboard &quot;Teutonic&quot; and &quot;Majestic&quot;, Second Class accommodations aboard were of more modest elegance, but spacious and comfortable. A separate deckhouse at the aft end of the superstructure provided both open and closed promenade decks and housed a library and smoke room which were scaled-down versions of their First Class counterparts. The same scaling-down was seen with the Second Class dining room, which could seat 148, and the array of comfortable two-berth and four-berth cabins.

Third Class, as was customary on all White Star Line vessels on the North Atlantic, strictly segregated at opposite ends of the vessel on the Upper, Saloon and Main decks. On the Upper Deck, entrances were located adjacent to the forward and aft well decks, where most of the lavatories were located. At the very aft end of the deck were the Third Class Smoke Room and General Room, as well as the galley. Single men were berthed in five compartments at the forward end of the vessel (two on the Saloon deck, three on the Main deck), each of which were laid out in a rather novel design of open berths. Because the berthing of Third Class was distributed at either end of the vessel, the forward compartments each had berths for roughly 100 men, whereas conventional open berth dormitories often berthed up to 300 passengers on other ships. This allowed for a more open layout which was far less crowded, complete with long tables and wooden benches where male passengers were served their meals.

In the aft quarters of the ship for Third Class were accommodations for single women, married couples and families located in five compartments (parallel to the forward layout, with two on the Saloon deck and three on the Main deck). As was seen aboard &quot;Teutonic&quot; and &quot;Majestic&quot;, as well as the newly completed &quot;Cymric&quot;, there were a limited number of two-berth and four-berth cabins, these were strictly reserved for married couples and families with children. The smaller of the two Saloon deck compartments was designated for married couples. On the main deck, a section of another compartment was designated for families with children. Each of the two compartments also had small dining rooms fashioned with fitted tables and swivel chairs similar to that in Second Class. In the remaining three compartments, single women were berthed in 20-berth dormitory-style cabins situated on the outer sides of each compartment. At the centre of each compartment, a widened corridor was fashioned as a dining room with long fitted tables and swivel chairs running lengthwise through each compartment.

===Proposed sister ship &quot;Olympic&quot;===
As White Star typically ordered ships in pairs, a sister ship for &quot;Oceanic&quot; to be named &quot;Olympic&quot; was proposed. However, following the death of the company chairman Thomas Ismay in November 1899, the order was postponed and then cancelled. Instead the company decided to deploy the resources to produce a set of larger liners which would become the &quot;Big Four&quot; class. The name &quot;Olympic&quot; was later bestowed upon the of 1910.

==Career==

&quot;Oceanic&quot; was launched on 14 January 1899, an event watched by over 50,000 people. She would be the largest and last British liner to be launched in the 19th century. Following her fitting out and sea trials, she left Belfast for Liverpool on the 26 August that year, and when she arrived she was opened to the public and press where she was received with great fanfare. She departed Liverpool on her maiden voyage to New York on 6 September, under the command of Captain John G. Cameron. Thomas Ismay had planned to be on board but was by this stage too unwell. She completed the voyage in 6 days 2 hours and 37 minutes at an average speed of and arrived at New York to a rapturous welcome. One disappointing feature which soon became apparent in service was the tendency for the ship to experience excessive vibration at full speed, due in part to her long and narrow design. To avoid this problem it was soon found necessary to operate her at a service speed of , lower than her planned service speed of .

The early years of &quot;Oceanic&quot;″s career were fairly eventful, as she was well received by the public on both sides of the Atlantic. Between 1900 and 1906, she bested her main rivals, Cunard&#x27;s speed queens &quot;Campania&quot; and &quot;Lucania&quot;, as well as her own running mates for westbound crossings.

In 1900, she was struck by lightning while at dock at Liverpool and lost the top of her mainmast. On 4 August that year while berthed at New York harbour, she was threatened by a serious fire in a cargo hold of the which was docked adjacent to her. The fire was brought under control before it could spread to &quot;Oceanic&quot;. On 7 August 1901 in a heavy fog, near Tuskar Rock, Ireland, &quot;Oceanic&quot; was involved in a collision with the small Waterford Steamship Company &quot;Kincora&quot;, sinking the smaller vessel and killing seven.

On 18 November 1904, four days out from New York, &quot;Oceanic&quot; encountered strong gales, stormy seas and snow, the battering the ship took from the sea stove in two portholes, which allowed a considerable amount of water to enter the ship.

In 1905, 45 of the ship&#x27;s firemen mutinied in protest at the unpleasant working conditions in the ship&#x27;s boiler rooms, which resulted in the conviction and imprisonment of 33 stokers.

In 1907, White Star set in place plans to establish an express service out of Southampton. Another IMM subsidiary, the American Line, had experienced great success out of this port due to its proximity to London, and it was ultimately decided &quot;Oceanic&quot;, along with &quot;Teutonic&quot;, &quot;Majestic&quot; and the newly completed &quot;Adriatic&quot; would terminate from this port, making double calls at the French port of Cherbourg and the line&#x27;s traditional terminal at Queenstown before setting for New York.

In April 1912, during the departure of from Southampton, &quot;Oceanic&quot; became involved in the near collision of &quot;Titanic&quot; with , when &quot;Oceanic&quot; was nearby as &quot;New York&quot; broke from her mooring and nearly collided with &quot;Titanic&quot;, due to the large wake caused by &quot;Titanic&quot;″s size and speed. A month later, in mid-May 1912, &quot;Oceanic&quot; picked up three bodies in one of the lifeboats left floating in the North Atlantic after &quot;Titanic&quot; sank. After their retrieval from Collapsible A by &quot;Oceanic&quot;, the bodies were buried at sea.

===World War I===
&quot;Oceanic&quot; had been built under a deal with the Admiralty, which made an annual grant toward the maintenance of any ship on the condition that it could be called upon for naval work, during times of war. Such ships were built to particular naval specifications, in the case of &quot;Oceanic&quot; so that the guns she was to be given could be quickly mounted. &quot;The greatest liner of her day&quot; was commissioned into Royal Navy service on 8 August 1914 as an armed merchant cruiser.

On 25 August 1914, the newly designated HMS &quot;Oceanic&quot; departed Southampton on naval service that was to last just two weeks. &quot;Oceanic&quot; was to patrol the waters from the North Scottish mainland to the Faroes, in particular the area around Shetland. She was empowered to stop shipping at her captain&#x27;s discretion, and to check cargoes and personnel for any potential German connections. For these duties, she carried Royal Marines and Captain William Slayter was appointed in command. Her former merchant master, Captain Henry Smith, with two years&#x27; service, remained in the ship with the rank of commander RNR. Many of the original crew also continued to serve on &quot;Oceanic&quot;. In effect therefore &quot;Oceanic&quot; had two captains, and this would lead to confusion about the chain of command.

====Wrecking====
&quot;Oceanic&quot; headed for Scapa Flow in Orkney, Britain&#x27;s main naval anchorage, with easy access to the North Sea and the Atlantic. From here she proceeded north to Shetland travelling continuously on a standard zigzag course as a precaution against being targeted by U-boats. This difficult manoeuvring required extremely accurate navigation, especially with such a large vessel. In the end it appears to have been poor navigation, rather than enemy action, that was to doom &quot;Oceanic&quot;.
An inaccurate fix of their position was made on the night of 7 September by navigator Lieutenant David Blair. While everyone on the bridge thought they were well to the southwest of the Isle of Foula, they were in fact an estimated farther north than they believed and to the east of the island instead of the west. This put them directly on course for a reef, the notorious Shaalds of Foula (also known as the Hoevdi Grund and so marked on charts), which poses a major threat to shipping, coming within a few feet of the surface, and in calm weather giving no warning sign whatsoever.

Captain Slayter had retired after his night watch, unaware of the situation, with orders to steer to Foula. Commander Smith took over the morning watch. Having previously disagreed with his naval superior about navigating a ship as large as &quot;Oceanic&quot; in the dangerous waters around the Scottish islands, he instructed the navigator to plot a course west, and out to sea, away (so he thought) from hidden dangers like outlying reefs. Unbeknown to Smith, this put the ship onto a course between the island and the reef just south of it. Slayter must have felt the course change, as he reappeared on the bridge to countermand Smith&#x27;s order and made what turned out to be a hasty and ill-informed judgement, as the ship again changed course directly towards the reef.

The ship ran aground on the Shaalds on the morning of 8 September, approximately east of Foula&#x27;s southern tip. She was wrecked in a flat calm and clear weather. She was the first Allied passenger ship to be lost in the war. She lies at , grid reference .

=====Rescue=====
The Aberdeen trawler &quot;Glenogil&quot; was the first vessel on the scene, and although she attempted to pull off the massive ship, it proved an impossible task, and with the hull already ruptured, &quot;Oceanic&quot; would not have stayed afloat long in open waters. Other ships in the area were called in to assist in the rescue operation that was to follow. All of the ship&#x27;s crew transferred to the trawler via the ship&#x27;s lifeboats and were then ferried to the waiting armed merchant cruiser HMS &quot;Alsatian&quot;, and . Charles Lightoller, the ship&#x27;s First Officer (and also the most senior officer to survive the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;), was the last man off, taking the navigation room&#x27;s clock as a souvenir.

The 573-ton Admiralty salvage vessel &quot;Lyons&quot; was dispatched to the scene hurriedly, and in the words of the Laird of Foula, Professor Ian Holbourn, writing about the disaster in his book &quot;The Isle of Foula&quot;:

The launch of the Lyons, a salvage boat which hurried to the scene, was capable of a speed of ten knots, yet was unable to make any headway against the tide although she tried for fifteen minutes. Even then it was not the top of the tide, and the officer in charge reckoned the full tide would be 12 knots, he confessed he would not have believed it had he been told.

Commander Smith is said to have come ashore at the remote island&#x27;s tiny pier, and on looking back out to sea toward his stranded ship two miles away, commented that the ship would stay on the reef as a monument and nothing would move it. One of the Foula men, wise to the full power and fury of a Shetland storm, is said to have muttered with a cynicism not unknown in those parts &quot;I‘ll give her two weeks&quot;.

Remarkably, following a heavy gale that had persisted throughout the night of 29 September, just two weeks after the incident the islanders discovered the following day that the ship had been entirely swallowed up by the sea, where she remains to this day scattered as she fell apart under the pressure of the seas on the Shaalds.

The disaster was covered up at the time, since it was felt that it would have been embarrassing to make public how a world-famous liner had run aground in friendly waters in good weather within a fortnight of beginning its service as a naval vessel. The revelation of such gross incompetence at this early stage of the war would have done nothing good for national morale.

=====Courts-martial=====
Lt. Blair was court-martialled at Devonport in November 1914, when he was found guilty of &quot;stranding or suffering to be stranded&quot; HMS &quot;Oceanic&quot;, and was ordered to be reprimanded. He offered in his defence that he was exonerated by the evidence given by Captain Slayter and Commander Smith that he was under their supervision, and that the stranding was due to abnormal currents.

A similar charge was made against Commander Smith at a second court-martial; the evidence for the prosecution was the same as in the previous case, but witnesses were cross-examined with a view to showing that the position of the accused on &quot;Oceanic&quot; was not clearly defined by the naval authorities, and that he was understood to be acting solely in an advisory capacity. He was acquitted the following day, as he was found not to have been in command on 8 September.

Captain Slayter was also acquitted.

==Salvage==

In 1924, a salvage company which had been engaged on the scuttled German warships at Scapa Flow attempted to salvage what remained of the wreck; however they were unsuccessful. In 1973 another attempt was made to salvage parts of the wreck and the propellers for scrap. Over the next six years, Simon Martin and Alec Crawford, with wet-suits and Scuba gear, and initially working from an inflatable dinghy, recovered more than 200 tonnes of non-ferrous metal. Martin told the story in his best-selling book, &quot;The Other Titanic&quot;.

==Lifeboat==

<text>The Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church (EELC; Estonian: &quot;Eesti Evangeelne Luterlik Kirik&quot;, abbreviated EELK) is a Lutheran church in Estonia. The EELC is member of the Lutheran World Federation and belongs to the Community of Protestant Churches in Europe. It is also a member of the Porvoo Communion, putting it in full communion with the Church of England and other Anglican churches in Europe.

==History==
The Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church was constituted in 1949, after the previous church hierarchy, &quot;Eesti Evangeeliumi Luteriusu Kirik&quot;, which had formed in 1919 and was headed by bishop Johan Kõpp, had escaped to Sweden in 1944. When the Soviet Union invaded Estonia in 1940, most Christian organizations were dissolved, church property was confiscated, theologians were exiled to Siberia, and religious education programs were outlawed. World War II later brought devastation to many church buildings. It was not until 1988 that church activities were renewed when a movement for religious tolerance began in the Soviet Union.

Although women had studied theology at Tartu University in the 1920s and some had sought ordination as priests, it was not until 1967 that the first woman, Laine Villenthal, was ordained. In 2014, the church reported that there were 169 men and 43 women serving as ministers.

While the EELC is not an established church, until 2023 it enjoyed a preferential status not extended to other churches in Estonia. In May 2023, Interior Minister Lauri Läänemets said that the state cannot favour one church over others, adding that a committee would be created involving the ecumenical Estonian Council of Churches.

==Leadership==
The Church of Estonia is episcopal in polity and is led by five bishops, including the archbishop who serves as the Primate. The archbishop has overall authority, and under his authority there are four jurisdictions, each with its own bishop.

Following the retirement of Andres Põder as archbishop, the current archbishop, Urmas Viilma, was consecrated on 2 February 2015.

During the Soviet occupation of Estonia, the Archbishop went into exile, which resulted in the formation of a parallel church, the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church Abroad. Until 2010, this body was independent, with its own archbishop based in Canada. In 2010, the two churches reunited, and the former overseas church became a diocese of the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church, known as the Extra-Estonian Diocese ().

==Bishops and Archbishops of Tallinn and Primates==
*Jaan Kiivit Sr. (1949–1967) 
*Alfred Tooming (1967–1977)
*Edgar Hark (1978–1986)
*Kuno Pajula (1987–1994)
*Jaan Kiivit Jr. (1994–2005)
*Andres Põder (2005–2014)
*Urmas Viilma (2015–&quot;present&quot;)

==Membership==
As of February 2009, the EELC reported approximately 160,000 baptized members and the EELC Abroad (based in Canada) reported approximately 8,000 baptized members. A previous figure broke down the EELC Abroad into 3,508 members with 12 clergy in the USA and 5,536 members with 11 clergy in Canada.

In 2014, the Lutheran World Federation (LWF) reported the number of registered members as being 180,000. The church reported that it had served 143,895 communicants. As of 2025, the LWF reported 160,000 members.

==Social issues== 
The church has both theologically conservative and liberal members. The church does ordain women to the priesthood, unlike the more conservative Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia and Evangelical Lutheran Church of Lithuania. In an interview, Archbishop Urmas Viilma stated that the church allows women ordination and &quot;will continue to do so&quot;. The church disapproves of homosexual unions, believing marriage is the sacred union of a man and a woman. It only allows celibate gay ministers to be ordained. However, Archbishop Viilma did state that if same-sex marriage is legalized in the country, &quot;then the church will clearly need to redefine itself&quot;, but he also stated that &quot;we clearly interpret the Bible to say that practicing homosexuality is sin...but we all are equal in God’s eyes and welcome in church.&quot; Archbishop Viilma announced his support for civil unions and agreed to be a part of a panel working in 2021 on a proposal to pass a bill to define marriage as heterosexual and to strengthen the civil partnership registration with equal rights for same-sex couples. In 2023, in response to the legalization of same-sex marriage in Estonia, the church reaffirmed its position that clergy could only perform or bless heterosexual marriages. Archbishop Viilma opposed the legalization of same-sex marriage, arguing that the government could improve the &quot;Cohabitation Act&quot; and that civil unions were sufficient for same-sex couples. The Lutherans leaned toward opposing the death penalty, although they took no official stance, and the church does not have a committee &quot;dealing with social-political questions&quot;.

==Awards conferred by EELC==
There are three awards conferred by EELC:
# Cross of Merit of EELC ()
# ().

<text>Escoba is a Spanish variant of the Italian fishing card game Scopa, which means &quot;broom&quot;, a name that refers to the situation in the game where all of the cards from the board are &quot;swept&quot; in one turn. The game is usually played with a deck of traditional Spanish playing cards, called .

==Objective==
The object of the game is to be the first player to score 15 points through capturing cards. Points are scored in a variety of ways as detailed below. It does not necessarily follow that the player with the most captured cards in any particular round will get the greatest score.

===Deal===
A traditional Spanish deck of 40 cards is used to play. For traditional decks which have 1 through 12 of each suit, the 8 and 9 of each suit must be removed, leaving 40 cards. A standard deck of playing cards (having Ace, 2-10, Jack, Knight, King) can be modified by removing the 8, 9, and 10 of every suit, leaving 40 cards. At the start of each round the dealer will deal three cards to each player, face down. After all the players have been dealt cards, four board cards are dealt, face up, in the center of the table, and play commences.

On rare occasions where the four initial cards dealt to the board add up to 15, they are taken by the dealer and added to his scoring pile.

===Play===
Play commences with the person to the right of the dealer. Each player in turn attempts to match one card from the hand with one or more cards on the board to produce a total of 15. When using a traditional deck, all cards are worth their face value except for the 10 (&quot;Jack&quot; or &quot;Page&quot;), 11 (&quot;Horse&quot;) and the 12 (&quot;King&quot;), which are reduced in value to 8, 9 and 10, respectively. All cards matched, including the one from the player&#x27;s hand, are removed from the board and placed in a scoring pile beside the player. A player unable to make a total of 15, must discard a hand card, adding it to the available cards in the centre of the table. After either scoring a hand or discarding, play then moves to the next player in anticlockwise order.

If a player can combine one hand card with all of the cards on the board to total 15, that player has scored an , worth one additional point at the end of the round. Each scored is typically noted by the player turning one card of their pile face up.

After players have exhausted their hands, the dealer will then deal a fresh hand of three cards each just as in the beginning of the round. The last hand in any particular round is the one which exhausts the deck. At the end of this round, the last player to have taken cards from the board receives any remaining cards regardless of their value. After this, the round is scored, and the deal progresses to the next player on the left.

===Scoring===

Points are determined at the end of each round. Players score points based on the following categories:

* Most cards: The player with the most cards in their score pile gets one point.
* Most coins: The player with the most (coins) gets one point.
* Most sevens: The player with the most sevens gets one point.
* Seven of coins: The player with the seven of coins gets one point.
* All of the sevens: If a player has managed to capture all of the sevens, they get one additional point.
* Players also get one additional point for each they have obtained.

If two or more players score the same in any category, none of them is awarded a point in that category, e.g., if two players each take 5 coins, neither scores a point. The first player to reach a score of 21 is declared the winner. If two players reach at least 21 on the same hand, the player with the most points wins. If there is a tie, play continues until the tie is broken.

==Variations==

===Escova===
 , also known as , is the Brazilian variation of Scopa, very popular in the Brazilian State of Rio Grande do Sul.

====Object====
The game is played until someone reaches 31 points. These points are gained by completing objectives. When the deck cards are finished, each player counts their own points.

*Each = 1 point
*Having all diamond cards = 2 points
*Having the most diamond cards = 1 point
*Having the most cards = 1 point
*Having the (7♦) = 1 point

The sub-objective of is to get and . To get an , the player must have a card that matches with all of the cards in the middle of the table to make 15, e.g., the cards on the table are 3♠ 2♣ 1♥ and 4♦ and Sara has a 5♠. If she adds 5+3+2+1+4, she will have 15. To get a , a player must have a card that matches with any card on the middle of the table to make 15.

====Deck====
 is played with Spanish playing cards but can also be played with Anglo-American cards. If played with Anglo-American cards, the 8, 9 and the 10 should be removed. has no (jokers).

====Card values====
Most cards have the same value as their numbers. These cards are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. The remaining cards have different values:

*Ace () = 1
*Jack () = 8
*Horse () = 9
*King () = 10

<text>Terry Moore (born 1954) is an American cartoonist, known for the series &quot;Strangers in Paradise&quot;, &quot;Rachel Rising&quot;, and the founding of Homage Comics. His work has won him recognition in the comics industry, including the Eisner Award for Best Serialized Story in 1996 for &quot;Strangers in Paradise&quot; #1–8, which was collected in the trade paperback &quot;I Dream of You&quot;.

==Early life==
Moore was born in Texas and he grew up in the Southern United States, Africa, and England. His younger sister was born while his family lived in Africa. He began drawing in sketchbooks when he was eight, and when he was thirteen, he learned to play the electric guitar. He has said his greatest career influence is &quot;Peanuts&quot;&#x27; Charles Schulz. 

While working as a musician, Moore met and married his wife. When they decided to have a family, he took a more stable job as a video editor. He moved into cartooning when he became tired of editing.

==Career==
Following the examples of independent comic creators like Dave Sim and Jeff Smith, Terry Moore decided to publish &quot;Strangers in Paradise&quot; himself through his own Houston-based Abstract Studio imprint.

In 2008, Moore wrote and drew covers for all five issues of Marvel Comics&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane&quot; vol. 2. The following year, he began writing &quot;Runaways&quot; vol. 2, also for Marvel. This run lasted for nine issues.

The first issue of his next self-published series, &quot;Echo&quot; was released on March 5, 2008. &quot;Echo&quot; ran for 30 issues and concluded in June 2011. It was followed in August 2011 by &quot;Rachel Rising&quot;, a 42-issue horror comic which won the 2014 Harvey Award for Best Lettering and 2015 award for Best Cartoonist in addition to several other nominations. It was also nominated for an Eisner Award in the categories Best Continuing Series (2012), Best Writer/Artist (2012, 2014), and Best Letterer (2014). His next book, &quot;Motor Girl&quot;, ran for 10 issues between November 2016 and November 2017.

Moore was featured in &quot;The Cartoonist,&quot; a 2009 documentary film on the life and work of Jeff Smith, creator of &quot;Bone.&quot; Moore was nominated in 2016 for the Inkwell Awards All-in-One Award.

Moore has expressed a desire to do a syndicated cartoon strip in the authors notes at the back of the &quot;Strangers in Paradise&quot; collection books. Some of Moore&#x27;s strip work has been published in &quot;Paradise, Too!&quot; and as a second feature in select issues of &quot;Rachel Rising&quot;.

<text>Consumer sovereignty is the economic concept that the consumer has some controlling power over goods that are produced, and that the consumer is the best judge of their own welfare.

&quot;Consumer sovereignty in production&quot; is the controlling power of consumers, versus the holders of scarce resources, in what final products should be produced from these resources. It is sometimes used as a hypothesis that the production of goods and services is determined by the consumers&#x27; demand (rather than, say, by capital owners or producers).

&quot;Consumer sovereignty in welfare&quot; is the idea that the consumer is the best judge of their own welfare (rather than, say, politicians). It is used to claim that, for example, the government should help the poor by giving them monetary transfers, rather than by giving them products that are deemed &quot;essential&quot; by the politicians.

== Consumer sovereignty in production ==
Consumer sovereignty was first defined by William Harold Hutt as follows:The consumer is sovereign when, in his role of citizen, he has not delegated to political institutions for authoritarian use the power which he can exercise socially through his power to demand (or refrain from demanding).The double use of the word &quot;power&quot; in this definition makes it clear that the power of the consumers was the most important topic in the whole concept. Hutt later reformulated the definition in a similar sense:...the controlling power exercised by free individuals, in choosing between ends, over the custodians of the community&#x27;s resources, when the resources by which those ends can be served are scarce.

=== Examples ===
Sometimes a business will fail because it can’t provide the products necessary to make consumers happy:

* Blockbuster ultimately failed because consumers started to adapt to more convenient alternatives like Netflix, Redbox, and video on demand. Blockbuster continued renting out DVDs and VHS tapes at traditional stores and was slow to modernize, causing Blockbuster to lose money and eventually go bankrupt.
* Dell, once the biggest computer manufacturer, faltered as mobile devices began to displace PCs, cheap Asian machines cut into profitability, and big customers began to demand end-to-end service in addition to the hardware.
* When other companies (such as Nikon and Canon) began making cameras that took digital photos unlike the film cameras from Kodak, consumers switched to these companies and eventually, Eastman Kodak went under.

=== Origins ===

The idea of primacy of consumption over production was first pronounced by Adam Smith in 1776:

Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production; and the interest of the producer ought to be attended to, only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer. 

The term &quot;consumer sovereignty&quot; was first coined by William Harold Hutt in his book &quot;Economists and the Public: A Study of Competition and Opinion&quot; (1936). However, Hutt himself was always cautious of claiming credit for the term:

I am not sure whether I coined the term myself. Marketing literature contains phrases like &quot;the customer is always right&quot;, and I am told that a proverbial expression in High Dutch is &quot;De klant is koning&quot; (the customer is king). I first used the term in its present sense in an unpublished article which I circulated in 1931. It first appeared in print, I believe, in an article which I published in March 1934. In 1935 Dr. W. Röpke used the phrase &quot;democracy of the consumers&quot;; and in the same year Professor F. A. Hayek used the phrase &quot;sovereignty of the consumer&quot; in a section heading in Collectivist Economic Planning. Since then the term seems to have been fairly widely employed.

Although Hutt did not mean to establish any theory based on this concept, some economists argue that consumer sovereignty does not hold in some cases, for example, in healthcare.

When the term was used for the first time by Hutt, it was written as &quot;consumers&#x27; sovereignty&quot;. In the book&#x27;s review by Jacob Viner, he used it as &quot;consumer&#x27;s sovereignty&quot;. Later, the term &quot;consumer sovereignty&quot; became generally used.

=== Consumers versus suppliers ===
To understand consumer sovereignty you must also understand consumers and their demand. Everyone is a consumer and demands not only products such as food, or commodities like oil or gas, but also production factors such as time, and all other possible things. When a worker wants to have more leisure time, his demand for leisure is confronted with the demand of the society for his work. Only after the worker outbids the society for his leisure, can he consume it as he wishes. According to Hutt, the poor understanding of consumers and their demand led to some of the early criticisms of this concept:

It seems to me that one basic misunderstanding is mainly responsible for all Professor Fraser&#x27;s criticisms. He says that the &quot;doctrine of consumers&#x27; sovereignty implies, perhaps even entails, that preferences on the side of demand are fundamentally and in principle more important than those on the side of supply.&quot; But all I have done is to make the concept correspond with the distinction between ends and means. As I have used the term, it covers the expression of all human preferences in respect of ends, in so far as those ends are confronted with scarce means. When ends are being sought, we are concerned with demand; when means are being chosen, we are concerned with an aspect of supply—entrepreneurship.

As Hutt also described, the concept therefore does not neglect suppliers:

This does not involve any &quot;startling neglect,&quot; as Professor Fraser describes it, &quot;of the producers&#x27; side of the picture.&quot; Every owner of resources (including his own physical powers) may be regarded as bidding, with the rest of the consumers, for the services of his own resources. We may regard him as normally offering part of those services for exchange, actual or anticipated bidding as a whole. He is, so to speak, outbid for such services by other consumers.

=== Criticism ===
The concept of consumer sovereignty has been criticized for not respecting a presumed symmetry between freedom to demand and freedom to supply. Although Hutt may be blamed for the misunderstanding of the critics, they have missed the point of the concept:

Recognizing that in some situations a producer might choose a less remunerative activity which that producer finds more personally satisfying, Hutt defined such a decision as one of consumption, not production. In doing so, he attempted to force the distinction between consumption and production to run exactly parallel to the distinction between ends and means.

Some economists viewed the effort to make the distinction between consumption and production parallel to the distinction between ends and means as an unfortunate exercise in wordplay.

Even if consumers are approached traditionally, they are largely sovereign under the assumption that in the role of producers, people maximize their income. Economists address this hypothesis also as consumer sovereignty.

This element supports society because consumers have the power to decide how a store is going to function and to increase or decrease sales - simply by buying things, consumers determine what goods are produced and how well they sell, and whether supply brings consumers to the market and whether new consumers will visit. It also brings competition between other markets because other markets might need to change the price on their goods in order to bring consumers back.

Views on the primacy of consumption can become matters of ideological debate in socialist economies - as happened in Poland in the 1940s.

===Related concepts===
*Consumers&#x27; co-operative is an enterprise owned and managed democratically by its consumers.
*Dollar voting is the impact of consumer choice on producers&#x27; actions through the flow of consumer payments to producers for their goods and services.
*Ethical consumerism is a process by which consumers deliberately try to influence the production process according to their moral values, for example by preferring ethical producers or boycotting non-ethical ones.
*Resource dependence theory is the theory that production depends on resources available from the environment, rather than just on consumers&#x27; demand.

== Consumer sovereignty in welfare ==
Consumer sovereignty is defined in the Macmillan dictionary of modern economics as:The idea that the consumer is the best judge of his or her own welfare. This assumption underlies the theory of consumer behaviour and through it the bulk of economic analysis including the most widely accepted optimum in welfare economics, the Pareto optimum. 
A more detailed definition was given by Abba P. Lerner:The basic idea of consumer sovereignty is really very simple: arrange for everybody to have what he prefers whenever this does not involve any extra sacrifice for anybody else.… One of the deepest scars of my early youth was etched when my teacher told me, “You do not want that,” after I had told her that I did. I would not have been so upset if she had said that I could not have it, whatever it was, or that it was very wicked of me to want it. What rankled was the denial of my personality—a kind of rape of my integrity. I confess I still find a similar rising of my hackles when I hear people&#x27;s preferences dismissed as not genuine, because influenced or even created by advertising, and somebody else telling them what they “really want.”
=== Empirical evidence ===
A possible way to test the consumer sovereignty assumption is to compare consumers&#x27; valuations of items they purchase on their own, to their valuations of items they receive as gifts from friends and family. In one such experiment, done during a holiday season, it was found that consumers value their own purchases about 18% more than the gifts they receive. This supports the consumer sovereignty assumption.

Another experiment compared the effects of two parallel government programs in Mexico, both intended to help poor villagers: the first provided cash transfers, and the second provided food transfers. The experiment found no evidence for the &quot;paternalistic&quot; view that in-kind transfers are better and that cash transfers induce consumption of unhealthy products. Since cash transfers are cheaper to carry out, a practical conclusion of this experiment is that it is better to help the poor by giving them cash transfers that they can use according to their subjective preferences.

=== Criticism ===
J. K. Galbraith claims that advertising distorts consumers&#x27; preferences, so consumers&#x27; revealed preferences actually represent what is good for the advertisers and not what is good for consumers themselves.

Lester Thurow claims that many consumers (e.g. children and drug-addicts) are not competent to know what is good for them. Moreover, even competent individuals have preferences that are partly influenced by society, and do not represent only their own wants.

Various studies show that consumers&#x27; preferences are irrational and inconsistent, and so they cannot represent what is actually good for them. This is true, in particular, for inter-temporal decisions (such as deciding how much to save for old age) and probabilistic decisions (such as assessing the risks of financial investments).

A practical implication of such criticisms is that governments should provide merit goods rather than lump-sum transfers.

<text>The Geneva drive or Geneva mechanism is a gear mechanism that translates a continuous rotation movement into intermittent rotary motion. 

The &quot;rotating drive&quot; wheel is usually equipped with a pin that reaches into a slot located in the other wheel (&quot;driven wheel&quot; that advances it by one step at a time. The drive wheel also has an elevated circular blocking disc that &quot;locks&quot; the rotating driven wheel in position between steps.

==History==
The name, Geneva drive, is derived from the device&#x27;s earliest application in mechanical watches, which were popularized in Geneva. The mechanism is frequently used in mechanical watches, since it can be made on a small scale and is able to withstand substantial mechanical stress. 

The &quot;Geneva drive&quot; is also called a &quot;Maltese cross mechanism&quot; due to the visual resemblance when the rotating wheel has four spokes.

In the most common arrangement of the Geneva drive, the client wheel has four slots and thus advances the drive by one step at a time (each step being 90 degrees) for each full rotation of the master wheel. If the steered wheel has &quot;n&quot; slots, it advances by per full rotation of the propeller wheel. The minimum number of slots in a practical Geneva drive is 3; it is rare to find a mechanism with more than 18 slots.

Because the mechanism needs to be well lubricated, it is often enclosed in an oil capsule.

== Uses and applications ==

One application of the Geneva drive is in film movie projectors and movie cameras, where the film is pulled through an exposure gate with periodic starts and stops. The film advances frame by frame, each frame standing still in front of the lens for a portion of the frame cycle (typically at a rate of 24 cycles per second), and rapidly accelerating, advancing, and decelerating during the rest of the cycle. This intermittent motion is implemented by a Geneva drive, which in turn actuates a claw that engages sprocket holes in the film. The Geneva drive also provides a precisely repeatable stopped position, which is critical to minimizing jitter in the successive images. (Modern film projectors may also use an electronically controlled indexing mechanism or stepper motor, which allows for fast-forwarding the film.) The first uses of the Geneva drive in film projectors date to 1896, with the projectors of Oskar Messter and Max Gliewe and the &quot;Teatrograph&quot; of Robert William Paul. Previous projectors, including Thomas Armat&#x27;s projector, marketed by Edison as the &quot;Vitascope&quot;, had used a &quot;beater mechanism&quot;, invented by Georges Demenÿ in 1893, to achieve intermittent film transport.
Geneva wheels having the form of the driven wheel were also used in mechanical watches, but not in a drive, rather to limit the tension of the spring, such that it would operate only in the range where its elastic force is nearly linear. If one of the slots of the driven wheel is occluded, the number of rotations the drive wheel can make is limited. In watches, the &quot;drive&quot; wheel is the one that winds up the spring, and the Geneva wheel with four or five spokes and one closed slot prevents overwinding (and also complete unwinding) of the spring. This so-called Geneva stop or &quot;Geneva stop work&quot; was the invention of 17th or 18th century watchmakers.

Other applications of the Geneva drive include the pen change mechanism in plotters, automated sampling devices, banknote counting machines, and many forms of indexable equipment used in manufacturing (such as the tool changers in CNC machines; the turrets of turret lathes, screw machines, and turret drills; some kinds of indexing heads and rotary tables; and so on). The Iron Ring Clock uses a Geneva mechanism to provide intermittent motion to one of its rings.

A Geneva drive was used to change filters in the Dawn mission framing camera used to image the asteroid 4 Vesta in 2011. It was selected to ensure that should the mechanism fail at least one filter would be usable.

=== Internal version ===
A variant exists where the drive wheel is inside the driven wheel. While an external Geneva drive advances the driven wheel one step in less than 180° rotation of the drive wheel, so (assuming a constant-speed drive wheel) the stop is always longer than the motion, in an internal wheel the motion always requires more than 180° rotation of the drive wheel, so the motion takes longer than the stop. The axis of the drive wheel can have a bearing only on one side.

The external form is the more common, as it can be built smaller and can withstand higher mechanical stresses. A shorter stop time can also be achieved by having more than one drive pin on an external drive wheel.

=== Spherical version ===
Another variant is the spherical Geneva drive.


== Kinematics ==
The figure shows the motion curves for an external four-slot Geneva drive, in arbitrary units. A discontinuity appears in the acceleration when the drive pin enters and leaves the slot, occurring at the instant the rigid bearing surfaces make contact or separate. This generates an &quot;infinite&quot; peak of jerk (Dirac peak), and therefore vibrations.

<text>Crithmum is a monospecific genus of flowering plant in the carrot family, Apiaceae. The sole species, Crithmum maritimum, is commonly known as rock samphire, sea fennel or samphire. It is found in parts of the Old World and is edible.

==Description==
It is a perennial plant growing to in both height and width. The stems are woody at the base, fleshy elsewhere and hairless. The leaves are fleshy lobes. The greenish-yellow flowers are borne in umbels. The fruits (seed pods) are yellow or purple and up to .

==Distribution and habitat==
Crithmum is found on coastlines throughout much of Europe (north to the British Isles), Macaronesia, parts of West Asia and North Africa in the Atlantic, Mediterranean and Black Sea coasts.

==Cultivation==
In England, rock samphire is cultivated in gardens, where it grows readily in a light, rich soil. In the United Kingdom the uprooting of wild plants is illegal under the Wildlife and Countryside Act.

==Uses==
Rock samphire or sea fennel has fleshy, divided aromatic leaves that Culpeper described as having a &quot;pleasant, hot and spicy taste&quot;. The plant can be prepared much like marsh samphire (&quot;Salicornia europaea&quot;); the stems and leaves should be washed and cooked, while the stems, leaves and young seed pods can be pickled, perhaps in salted and spiced vinegar. The fresh leaves may be used in salads. Dried and ground sea fennel can also be used as a salt substitute.

Sea fennel pickle in olive oil or vinegar is a traditional food of Italy (Marche region), Croatia (Dalmatia), Greece, and Montenegro (Bay of Kotor). It is known as Paccasassi del Conero and used as an antipasto, to accompany fish and meat dishes and to garnish pizza and sandwiches.

=== Nutrition ===
Sea fennel has nutritional value, and is rich in antioxidants.

==In culture==
In the 17th century, Shakespeare in &quot;King Lear&quot; referred to the dangerous practice of collecting rock samphire from cliffs. In the 19th century, samphire was being shipped in casks of seawater from the Isle of Wight to market in London at the end of May each year. Rock samphire used to be cried in London streets as &quot;Crest Marine&quot;.

The reclaimed piece of land adjoining Dover, called Samphire Hoe, is named after rock samphire. The land was created from spoil from the Channel Tunnel, and rock samphire used to be harvested from the neighbouring cliffs.

<doc id="827108" wikidata="Q7824424" url="?curid=827108" title="Top Banana (video game)">
<text>Top Banana is an environmentally-themed platform game produced by Hex and Psycore for the Acorn Archimedes in 1991 and ported to the Amiga and Atari ST in 1992. The chief artist and coder was Miles Visman, with supporting graphics and sound by Karel Dander and supporting graphics by Sophie Smith, Robert Pepperell and Matt Black. &quot;Top Banana&quot; was released using recycled cardboard packaging, furthermore being advertised as being the &#x27;first video game with recycled packaging&#x27;. &quot;Top Banana&#x27;s&quot; plot is about trying to save the environment from pollution using love.

&quot;Top Banana&quot; is heavily influenced by techno and rave culture, and the game features a techno music video as an introduction. Reception for &quot;Top Banana&quot; was polarized; some reviewers praised the game&#x27;s techno soundtrack and &#x27;original&#x27; environmental plot, while others heavily criticized the game due to its &#x27;repetitive&#x27; and &#x27;difficult&#x27; gameplay and &#x27;difficult to parse&#x27; graphics. The game&#x27;s graphics and sound are left uncompressed, allowing the player to edit them, something that the README included alongside the game encourages.

==Plot==
:&quot;Our planet is under threat - not from slimy aliens or evil wizards but from direct consequences of our own greed and stupidity. Every moment sees further demolition of the rainforest, more leaking nuclear waste, land floods caused by melting ice caps and much needed food rotting in locked warehouses. Your task is to combat those forces which are worlds tilts into oblivion you must redress the balance through positive action. To aid you in this task you are invested with a great power - that power is Love. Use this power to repel the agents of destruction. By spreading Love your enemies will vanish, or even begin to help you. You will be able to stem the tide of flood, neutralise the acid rain and release the hoarded fruits of the World&#x27;s produce for all to share. If you succeed then you will have proved your skill and courage in the material world. Consequently, you will be offered the opportunity to seek ultimate wisdom in the Mind-Scape and achieve the status of Top Banana.&quot;
::- &quot;Top Banana&quot; Manual
==Gameplay==
&quot;Top Banana&quot; is a platformer with the goal of each level being to reach the top of the level. The heroine, KT, must travel through psychedelic levels while jumping across platforms and throwing lovehearts to convert planet-damaging enemies into energising fruit. The enemies include Corprats, Popstars, Chainsaws and Bulldozers. Much like &quot;Rainbow Islands&quot;, water that damages the player rises from the bottom of the level to motivate the player to ascend to the top of the level quickly. However, in &quot;Top Banana&quot; the water is not an instant kill, and instead deals 1 point of damage to the player, the water then resets to the bottom of the level, and continues to rise. The player has one life and can take 5 hits before dying; upon death, all progress in the game is lost, and the player must start again from the beginning of the game. KT&#x27;s health is depicted visually by her portrait in the lower left, and parts of it disappear as health is lost. Fruit that the player may collect throughout the game does not replenish health, and instead awards points, which have no tangible reward other than the player may place in the high score table if enough points are collected.

Enemies are defeated in one hit, except for bosses which take several, and stationary enemies such as skulls that cannot be defeated and must be avoided. Some enemies can move through platforms, and towards the player directly. Bosses in &quot;Top Banana&quot; include a digitized photo of a man&#x27;s head surrounded by circling dollar signs, a mecha robot, a motorcycle police officer&#x27;s helmet combined with a spider, and a convulsing knobbled multi-coloured sphere, referred to in the manual as the &quot;psychesphere of Enlightenment&quot;.

&quot;Top Banana&quot; features bosses at the end of each stage; each stage has several levels, and have differing background graphics and enemies. To finish a level, a picture of a woman&#x27;s head at the top of the level must be touched by the player, and stages with bosses are completed when the boss is defeated. &quot;Top Banana&quot; has four stages: the Rain Forest, the Metal-City, the Temple, and the Mind-Scape. The background graphics in each stage are randomly selected from a set of graphics matching the stage&#x27;s theme; each time the level is loaded the graphics may differ, although platforms remain fixed in the same locations. Upon finishing a level, the game displays a phrase randomly selected from a list of phrases as the next level loads, including &quot;Beware, Behave&quot;, &quot;Recycle The Hype&quot; and &quot;Get Up Get Down&quot;. In later stages, there are traps that if walked into, slow movement, reverses the game&#x27;s controls, as well as inverting the colors of the level&#x27;s graphics for several seconds. Upon taking damage, the player phases through the platforms they are on for several seconds, causing the player to lose progress. There are checkpoints in each level that, upon being reached, the player cannot fall through. Blue flowers in levels may be turned into moving platforms by shooting them.

As a copy-protection measure, the player is prompted to enter a word from a specific page and line in the manual upon starting the game.

==Development==
Many of &quot;Top Banana&#x27;s&quot; sprites are taken from videos and television for use in the game, much in the same way audio may be sampled in music. Musician and Coldcut member Matt Black worked on &quot;Top Banana&quot;, and later members of the Hex multimedia group formed Hexstatic. &quot;Top Banana&quot; was playtested in the Netherlands. Top Banana cost 329 Swedish Kronor in 1992.

&quot;Top Banana&#x27;s&quot; developer &amp; publisher Hex is also known as Hardwire, a company specializing in computer graphics work for music videos. Hex spokesman Robert Pepperell stated in an article in a May 1991 issue of &quot;The One&quot; that &quot;Top Banana&quot; was developed because Hex believed &quot;a computer game would be an interesting challenge&quot;, and because &quot;Most games look rather sterile. We wanted to do something really different and positive. The technique of video sampling has never been used in a game before. &quot;Top Banana&quot; really looks and sounds completely different to any other computer game yet written.&quot; Matt Black was initially going to make a cameo appearance in &quot;Top Banana&quot; as a manic bongo player, but this is absent in the final game. The screenshot of &quot;Top Banana&quot; featured in &quot;The One&#x27;s&quot; article is drastically visually different to that of the final game, with a differing artstyle, a top-down perspective as opposed to a 2D one, and depicts a performance hall with a piano, a location absent in the final game.

==Reception==
Several reviewers compare &quot;Top Banana&quot; to &quot;Rainbow Islands&quot; and criticize &quot;Top Banana&#x27;s&quot; graphics.

The Atari ST version of &quot;Top Banana&quot; is featured in Stuart Ashen&#x27;s (also known by his online presence as Ashens) 2017 book &quot;Attack of the Flickering Skeletons: More Terrible Old Games You&#x27;ve Probably Never Heard Of&quot;, particularly criticizing &quot;Top Banana&#x27;s&quot; graphics, calling them &quot;an utterly indecipherable, garbled mess&quot; and that &quot;the only reason you can actually pick out the enemies from the rest of the screen is because they move ... each area gets progressively uglier and more muddled.&quot; Ashens criticises the sound effects, calling them &quot;irritating&quot;, and notes that playing the Atari ST version on anything but an Atari STe removes them, replacing them with stock sound chip effects, which Ashens expresses is a more &#x27;tolerable&#x27; alternative. Ashens also criticises &quot;Top Banana&#x27;s&quot; gameplay and its difficulty, calling it &quot;semi-playable&quot; and a &quot;badly executed platformer&quot;. When discussing the other versions of the game, Ashens says while the original Acorn Archimedes version is better than the ports, it is still not a good game.

&quot;Amiga Power&quot; gave the Amiga version of &quot;Top Banana&quot; an overall score of 45%, starting their review by stating that &quot;the last thing I wanted to have thrust at me was a game featuring psychedelic &#x27;acid&#x27; graphics, a &#x27;dance&#x27; soundtrack, a naive ecological plot, environmentally-friendly packaging and things that wobble the screen about when you walk into them.&quot; &quot;Amiga Power&quot; criticises &quot;Top Banana&#x27;s&quot; gameplay, plot, and graphics, comparing its gameplay to &quot;Rainbow Islands&quot;, stating that &quot;&quot;Rainbow Islands&quot; does it all a hundred times better&quot; and calls the traps that reverse the player&#x27;s controls &#x27;irritating&#x27;, and the graphics &quot;confusing&quot; and that it&#x27;s &quot;impossible to see what&#x27;s going on most of the time&quot;. &quot;Amiga Power&quot; also expresses that there &#x27;isn&#x27;t much to do&#x27;, summarizing &quot;Top Banana&#x27;s&quot; gameplay as &quot;just collecting, shooting, and climbing.&quot;

German gaming magazine &quot;Amiga Joker&quot; gave &quot;Top Banana&quot; an overall score of 16%, beginning their review with the following: &quot;Our beautiful Earth is in a miserable state: the rainforests are dying, the hole in the ozone gets bigger every day, the sea levels are rising uncontrollably, and environmentally friendly software also gets worse! The box is made of recycled cardboard, which makes it very environmentally friendly - but the platforming game inside is unfortunately everything but friendly. Although this game follows in the tradition of &quot;Captain Planet&quot; and the packaging states it is &quot;as engrossing as Sonic and Mario&quot;, the reality is quite different: what you see on your screen will ruin your eyes, destroy your eardrums and kill every last nerve.&quot;

&quot;Amiga Joker&quot; continues their review by criticising its graphics and gameplay, saying that &quot;it plays even more boring than we have described it here; moreover there may as well be nothing recognisable on the screen: [there are] disgusting, barely animated digital graphics in hideous colors.&quot; &quot;Amiga Joker&quot; furthermore expressed their disdain for the music, gameplay and sound effects, calling &quot;Top Banana&quot; &quot;almost unplayable, wholeheartedly unoriginal and, thanks to idiotic sound effects and grinding title music, also acoustically unbearable ... Conclusion: picking up trash in the park is a more exciting and meaningful environment game [than &quot;Top Banana&quot;].&quot; &quot;Amiga Joker&#x27;s&quot; only compliment was the parallax scrolling, which they called &quot;smooth&quot;, but expressed that it did not make up for the rest of the game&#x27;s shortcomings.

German gaming magazine &quot;Aktueller Software Markt&quot; gave the Amiga version of &quot;Top Banana&quot; four out of twelve; the reviewer is a fan of Coldcut, and praised &quot;Top Banana&#x27;s&quot; introductory music video ^, stating in regards to the game that &quot;Such a first-class promotion will naturally bring lots of interest to the game - so what is concealed within &quot;Top Banana&quot;? The answer: a cheap version of hopscotch.&quot; &quot;ASM&quot; criticises &quot;Top Banana&#x27;s&quot; gameplay and graphics, expressing that &quot;Perhaps quite notable are the crazy techno sounds and the psychedelic graphics, which are best enjoyed with a pair of sunglasses. But other than that? More sparkle than sense!&quot; &quot;ASM&quot; praised &quot;Top Banana&#x27;s&quot; music, giving it a ten out of twelve.

Swedish gaming magazine &quot;Datormagazin&quot; gave the Amiga version of &quot;Top Banana&quot; an overall score of 75%, beginning their review by stating that &quot;It&#x27;s not easy to break new ground when it comes to platform games, but &quot;Top Banana&quot; attempts exactly this.&quot; &quot;Datormagazin&quot; expresses a desire for more problem solving in &quot;Top Banana&quot;, and further notes that the gameplay is &#x27;par for the course&#x27; for platform games, comparing it to &quot;Rainbow Islands&quot;. &quot;Datormagazin&quot; praises &quot;Top Banana&#x27;s&quot; unique graphics and music, praising the techno soundtrack and stating that &quot;The backgrounds look like a middle ground between &#x27;neat 70&#x27;s style &amp; a MTV video run off a modem&#x27;, complete with music.&quot; &quot;Datormagazin&quot; however notes that &quot;sometimes it can be difficult to distinguish between the background and things on screen that are important or dangerous ... [also] some enemies you cannot see because they&#x27;re too small&quot;, furthermore calling the graphics &quot;a bit messy at times.&quot; &quot;Datormagazin&quot; praises &quot;Top Banana&#x27;s&quot; plot and meaning as &quot;deep&quot;, and praises the ability to edit &quot;Top Banana&#x27;s&quot; graphics, stating that it adds &quot;longetivity&quot; to what the player can get out of the game. &quot;Datormagazin&quot; concludes by calling &quot;Top Banana&quot; &quot;not the best of the best&quot;, but that it has the &#x27;spirit&#x27; of the original &quot;Rainbow Islands&quot;.

British Channel 4 television programme &quot;GamesMaster&quot; reviewed &quot;Top Banana&quot; in episode five of season one; the reviewers were contestants on the game show, and gave &quot;Top Banana&quot; an overall score of 65%. &quot;Top Banana&quot; was reviewed by three reviewers with differing opinions on the game; one reviewer praised &quot;Top Banana&#x27;s&quot; &quot;great&quot; music and &quot;absolutely superb&quot; graphics, while simultaneously calling the game &#x27;unplayable&#x27;, while another praised its &#x27;original&#x27; environmental plot, but summarized &quot;Top Banana&quot; as &quot;just another platformer with a beat &#x27;em up in the middle.&quot; Another reviewer stated that &quot;I&#x27;ve seen it all before, really.&quot;

==Legacy==
A demo for &quot;Top Banana&quot; is featured on &quot;Amiga Format&quot; issue #32&#x27;s coverdisk. In November 1992 the game was included in Hex&#x27;s release &quot;Global Chaos CDTV&quot; on the then new CD-ROM medium, alongside remixes of &quot;Top Banana&#x27;s&quot; soundtrack.

<doc id="827110" wikidata="Q144125" url="?curid=827110" title="Xenophilia">
<text>Xenophilia or xenophily is the love for, attraction to, or appreciation of foreign people, manners, customs, or cultures. It is the antonym of xenophobia or xenophoby. The word is a modern coinage from the Greek &quot;xenos&quot; () (stranger, unknown, foreign) and &quot;philia&quot; () (love, attraction), though the word itself is not found in classical Greek.

==In biology==
In biology xenophily includes, for example, the acceptance by an insect of an introduced foreign plant closely related to the normal host. Xenophily is distinguished from xenophagy (or allotrophy), and is less common than xenophoby. Early 20th-century entomologists incorrectly concluded that the evolution of the glandular terminal disk was a function of xenophily, following its discovery in myrmecophilous larvae.

==In culture==
Cultural appreciation refers to attraction or admiration towards one or more cultures which are not one&#x27;s own. Individual examples are usually suffixed with -philia, from the Ancient Greek word &quot;philia&quot; (φιλία), &quot;love, affection&quot;. Cultural xenophilia according to some sources can be connected with cultural cringe. It may also be area-specific, such as led the Romans to believe that Greeks were better than Romans at music, art and philosophy, but evidently not better at military matters. In the book and movie series &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, an extravagant character is named Xenophilius Lovegood.

==In politics and history==
George Washington, in his 1796 Farewell Address, described having allegiance to more than one nation as negative:

==In religion==
Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, the English Orthodox Chief Rabbi, philosopher, theologian, and author, posited that xenophilia is deeply ingrained and central to Judaism. He invokes the biblical injunction: &quot;When a stranger comes to live in your land, do not mistreat him. Treat the stranger the way you treat your native-born. Love him as yourself, for you were strangers in Egypt. I am the Lord your God&quot; (Leviticus 19:33–34). Sacks writes:

Most people in most societies in most ages have feared, hated and often harmed the stranger. There is a word for this: xenophobia. How often have you heard the opposite word: xenophilia? My guess is, never. People don’t usually love strangers. That is why, almost always when the Torah states this command – which it does, according to the Sages, 36 times – it adds an explanation: &quot;because you were strangers in Egypt.&quot; I know of no other nation that was born as a nation in slavery and exile. We know what it feels like to be a vulnerable minority. That is why love of the stranger is so central to Judaism and so marginal to most other systems of ethics. But here too, the Torah does not use the word &quot;justice.&quot; There is a command of justice toward strangers, but that is a different law: &quot;You shall not wrong a stranger or oppress him&quot; (Ex. 22:20). Here the Torah speaks not of justice but of love.

These two commands define Judaism as a religion of love – not just of God (&quot;with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your might&quot;), but of humanity also. That was and is a world-changing idea.

<text>Mary Coleridge (23 September 1861 – 25 August 1907) was a British novelist and poet who also wrote essays and reviews. She wrote poetry under the pseudonym Anodos (a name taken from George MacDonald). Other influences on her were Richard Watson Dixon and Christina Rossetti. Robert Bridges, the Poet Laureate, described her poems as &#x27;wondrously beautiful… but mystical rather than enigmatical&#x27;.

== Biography ==
Mary Elizabeth Coleridge was born in Hyde Park Square, London, the daughter of Arthur Duke Coleridge, who was a lawyer and influential amateur musician. With the singer Jenny Lind, her father was responsible for the formation of the London Bach Choir in 1875. Other family friends included Robert Browning, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, John Millais and Fanny Kemble. She was the great-grandniece of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and the great niece of Sara Coleridge, the author of &quot;Phantasmion&quot;.

Coleridge was educated at home, mostly by the poet and educationalist W. J. Cory, and began writing poetry as a child. She travelled widely throughout her life, although her home was in London, where she lived with her family. She taught at the London Working Women&#x27;s College for twelve years from 1895 to 1907.

She completed five novels. Her first was &quot;The Seven Sleepers of Ephesus&quot;, published in February 1893 by Chatto &amp; Windus. The story (which is unrelated to the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus legend) centres on a mysterious &quot;Brotherhood&quot; involved in the production of a play in a nineteenth-century German town. It received mixed reviews. The novel was credited only to &quot;M. E. Coleridge&quot;, which led at least one newspaper to assume that the author was a man. 

Edward Arnold published the other four novels. The best known is &quot;The King with Two Faces&quot;, which earned her £900 in royalties in 1897, running through six editions in its first year. The subject is the French Revolution and the assassination of Gustavus III of Sweden in 1792.

Coleridge died of complications arising from appendicitis while on holiday in Harrogate in 1907, leaving an unfinished manuscript for her next novel and hundreds of unpublished poems. Her poetry was first published under her own name in the posthumous &quot;Poems&quot; (1908). It proved very popular, with four reprints within six months of first publication. In the preface to this volume, Henry Newbolt wrote: 

In 1954 interest was revived by the first comprehensive &quot;Collected Poems&quot; to be issued, edited by Rupert Hart-Davis and with an introduction by Theresa Whistler. More recently, her work has been further re-assessed and included in anthologies of &quot;fin de siècle&quot; Victorian women&#x27;s poetry by Angela Leighton and Margaret Reynolds, and Isobel Armstrong and Joseph Bristow. Heather Braun contributed a substantial introduction to a reprint of her final published novel, &quot;The Lady on the Drawingroom Floor&quot; (with selected poetry and prose) in 2018.

==Musical settings==
The relative simplicity of Mary Coleridge&#x27;s lyrical poetry, combined with its touch of mysticism and strong imagery, proved congenial to composers. Both Hubert Parry and Charles Villiers Stanford were friends of Mary&#x27;s father, and frequent visitors to the family home at 12, Cromwell Place, South Kensington. Parry set seven of her poems as songs for voice and piano in his &quot;English Lyrics, Ninth Set&quot;, published in 1909. In the opinion of Trevor Hold, &quot;no-one set her more sympathetically than Parry.&quot; Stanford composed two sets of eight choral partsongs, Op. 119 and Op. 127 (both 1910). By far the best known of these (and of any Coleridge setting) is &quot;The Blue Bird&quot;, from Mary&#x27;s poem originally published in 1897 under the French title &quot;L&#x27;Oiseau Bleu&quot;.

Other settings include several by John Ireland and Roger Quilter, three poems (including &quot;Thy Hand in Mine&quot;) by Frank Bridge, and the &quot;Four Dramatic Songs&quot;, Op. 44 for solo voice and orchestra by Cyril Rootham (1913 - later also arranged for voice and piano). William Busch set &quot;L&#x27;Oiseau Bleu&quot; in a German translation as &quot;Der blaue Vogel&quot; (1944).

<text>James Carlyle Long (born September 20, 1967) is an American professional stock car racing driver, mechanic, and team owner. He last competed part-time in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, driving the No. 66 Toyota Supra for MBM Motorsports. In the past, he served as a mechanic for Mansion Motorsports, Spears Motorsports, and Travis Carter Motorsports. He was a crew chief at Front Row Motorsports for Eric McClure and Competition director at Rick Ware Racing.

==Early career==
Long began racing in 1983 at Orange County and South Boston Speedway. He won the track championship at South Boston in 1987 and the Street Stock championship at Orange County in 1990. In 1992, he raced in NASCAR-sanctioned competition for the first time, earning Rookie of the Year honors at Orange County in the Winston Racing Series, and was awarded the Best Sportsmanship award the following season. After competing at various Winston Racing tracks in the 90&#x27;s, he moved up to the Slim Jim All Pro Series in 1997, grabbing a win at Bristol Motor Speedway in the No. 15 Austin Foods Chevy.
In 1998, he began running ARCA and Craftsman Truck races for Mansion Motorsports. Most recently, he won the championship race at Orange County Speedway on November 12, 2006.

==NASCAR career==
===1999–2002===
Long made his NASCAR debut in 1998 in the Craftsman Truck Series. at Bristol, starting 21st but finishing 31st after the engine in his No. 91 Mansion Motorsports Ford F-150 expired.

He began running the Cup races in 1999 with the No. 85 Mansion Motorsports team, but DNQ&#x27;d for every attempt throughout that year. He ran Bristol again the following year, in the Truck Series posting a career-best ninth place qualifying effort, as well as at Louisville Speedway, where he wrecked very early in the race. After more struggles in 2000, he finally qualified to make his Cup Series debut in one of its most prestigious races, the Coca-Cola 600. However, Darrell Waltrip, one of the top drivers in series history, who was retiring at the end of the 2000 season, failed to qualify. Long gave up his ride to Waltrip for the race. He made another truck race in 2000 at Texas, where he started 33rd but finished 17th in a truck fielded by Team 23 Racing. Long would eventually make his Cup debut at Dover, qualifying 42nd but finishing 41st after a crash on lap 12. He made one more start that year, at Rockingham Speedway, finishing 32nd. He ran three races in 2001, his best finish being a 29th at the UAW-GM Quality 500. He also made his Busch Series debut in 2001 in the Aaron&#x27;s 312 at Atlanta. Driving the No. 49 for Jay Robinson Racing, Carl started 41st but came across handling problems during the race, relegating him to 42nd.

In 2002, Long ran for Rookie of the Year, but failed to earn the award mainly due to an incomplete season. Long attempted a group of the races, but failed to qualify for all except two. He started the season with Mansion Motorsports again, but when that team ran out of money, Long departed the team, originally to Glenn Racing, then to Ware Racing Enterprises, and then finally the No. 59 Foster Price team, with whom he finished 39th at Atlanta Motor Speedway. In addition, he had a sixteenth-place start at Dover for Mansion in the Truck Series (during which Long ran in the Top 10 before an engine failure), and a 30th-place finish at Richmond for Rick Ware in the Revival Soy truck.

===2003–2014===
He made two Busch races in 2003 for Robert Creech, his best finish a 28th at Rockingham. He had another 28th at Rockingham the following year, as well as running the No. 07 for Moy Racing at Loudon, where his engine expired early in the race. He also ran another race for Ware at New Hampshire, but finished last. He made his first race as a team owner that season, when Matt Carter drove his No. 96 truck to a 17th-place finish at Martinsville Speedway. After failing to make a Cup race in 2003, Long returned to the Glenn Racing Dodge in 2004. In their first race together, Long&#x27;s car flipped several times in a violent accident at the Subway 400, the final Cup race ever held at North Carolina Speedway in Rockingham, North Carolina. Long was uninjured and returned to the series in the following Cup event at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, driving for fellow independent Hermie Sadler. Long then drove at Pocono Raceway for the McGlynn Racing operation, finishing 41st. After a final race for Glenn he ran two races with Hover Motorsports.

Long announced he would merge his No. 46 team with the McGlynn Racing team to run in 2005. Although he drove only the No. 00 from McGlynn, Long ran nine races that year, and had a career-best qualifying effort of 20th at Atlanta. Unfortunately, sponsors wanted 1990 Daytona 500 winner Derrike Cope to drive the car, which forced McGlynn to release Long. Long closed out the year running at Homestead-Miami Speedway in a personally owned chassis originally purchased from Petty Enterprises. The car was prepared in Stan Hover&#x27;s shop with mostly volunteers, and a leased motor from Bill Davis Racing was dropped into the car. Unfortunately, a crash in qualifying ended his weekend prematurely. That season Long was also announced as a driver for a new team, Victory Motorsports, owned by Terance Mathis, but the team never ran.

In 2006, Long ran the No. 80 for Hover Motorsports at the Daytona 500, but missed the race. He attempted three races for R&amp;J Racing but also failed to qualify for those events. He returned to the Busch Series, driving the No. 23 for Keith Coleman Racing in six races before being replaced, and also ran a Truck Series race for Jim Rosenblum Racing. He attempted a race at Bristol with Long Brothers Racing, but did not qualify. Long joined a new Nextel Cup team, Cupp Motorsports, in the No. 46 Millstar Tools-sponsored Dodge. Long attempted three races for Cupp, but failed to qualify for each of them. He returned with help from McGlynn to attempt the Ford 400 at the end of 2006, but did not make the race.
In 2007, Long ran a limited schedule for Long Brothers Racing in the USAR Hooters Pro Cup Series, posting a best finish of second. He ran two races for Carter 2 Motorsports in the Busch Series, before the team closed down. He attempted the 2008 Daytona 500 for E&amp;M Motorsports with sponsorship from Millstar and Rhino&#x27;s Energy Drink, but did not qualify. He began fielding his own car with Red Line Oil sponsoring in the Nationwide Series, making his first start of the season at Darlington Raceway.

Long attempted the 2009 Daytona 500 with sponsorship from Romeo Guest Construction, one of Long&#x27;s first sponsors in the mid-1990s when he was competing in Late Models.

In May 2009, Long was fined $200,000 after his engine was discovered to be 0.17 cubic inches over the regulation size during practice for the Sprint Showdown. It was the largest fine in NASCAR history until 2013, when Michael Waltrip Racing was fined $300,000 for allegedly manipulating the outcome of the Federated Auto Parts 400. In addition to the fine, Long&#x27;s team was penalized 200 driver and 200 owner points, suspended for 12 Cup races, suspended from all NASCAR races until August 18, and placed on probation until December 31. Because Long was unable to pay the fine, he was barred from participating in the Cup series. Prior to his suspension, he was a crew member on the No. 34 Front Row Motorsports Cup team. He has driven for numerous independent teams in the Sprint Cup, Nationwide Series, and Camping World Truck Series, as well as the Auto Racing Club of America. In 2010, Long was named to drive the No. 01 Chevrolet for Daisy Ramirez&#x27;s Truck Series team and the No. 68 Nationwide Series car for Fleur-de-lis Motorsports. For 2011, he drove for Rick Ware Racing in the Nationwide Series.

In 2014, Long partnered with Derek White to form Motorsports Business Management, fielding a team in the Nationwide Series under the name MBM Motorsports. The team made its debut at Bristol with Matt Carter as driver of the No. 13. For six more races in 2014, Long fielded rides for himself, White, and Mike Wallace, failing to qualify for four and not finishing all six races they had qualified.
===2017–present===
In May 2017, Long announced he had reached an agreement with NASCAR to allow him to return to the Cup Series garage. He also declared his intention to field the No. 66 Chevrolet SS at the Go Bowling 400 in Kansas under the MBM Motorsports banner. The number was selected as tribute to MBM driver Mark Thompson, while the paint scheme was nearly identical to the No. 46 car Long drove in the Cup Series prior to his ban from the Cup garage in 2009; the green and yellow colors remained, though the red roof number was changed to yellow. Although the team received sponsorship from marijuana vaping manufacturer Veedverks, NASCAR prevented the company from appearing on the car after Long misspelled the company name in his sponsor submission to NASCAR, spelling it with an &quot;o&quot; instead of a &quot;d&quot;; upon further investigation by NASCAR, the sanctioning body ordered Long to remove the sponsorship. Long missed the first practice session before running 14 laps in the second session, followed by being unable to set a qualifying lap as he was one of 11 cars stuck in inspection during the session. This relegated Long to a 40th-place starting spot, from which he finished 31st.

Since 2014, Long has owned MBM Motorsports. The team competes full time in the NASCAR Xfinity Series and part-time in the NASCAR Cup Series.

In February 2021, Long called Noah Gragson an &quot;over-entitled mouthpiece who did not have the talent to avoid the wreck.&quot; This was in response to Gragson calling his driver, David Starr, a &quot;dipshit&quot; after Gragson ran into him after Starr blew a tire. Following the season finale weekend at Phoenix, Long, Starr, and seven team members tested positive for COVID-19.

Long is seen as a &#x27;working man&#x27;s&#x27; driver who never had the family corporate money that many of today&#x27;s stars in racing have behind them.

==Personal life==
Long was a former manager at a Raleigh/Durham Domino&#x27;s Pizza, where he was named manager of the year in 1988. He has a wife and 4 kids: Kierstyn, Dane, Nicole, and Carly Long. Additionally, he holds the record for most pizzas delivered in one night at that location.

<text>Wishing Moon by Michael O. Tunnell is a modern-style Arabian fantasy for children. It was published in New York in 2004 by Dutton Children&#x27;s Books, and is followed by a sequel titled &quot;Moon Without Magic&quot;.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Wishing Moon&quot; follows the tale of Aminah Barnes, a beggar orphan who is thrown Aladdin&#x27;s magical lamp by an unwitting princess, Badr Al-Budur, after Aladdin has married her. As Aminah works out problems with the lamp and its demon, she eventually begins her own journey of emotions while trying to avoid the notice of the spoiled and ambitious princess who seeks to regain the lost lamp. After settling into a moderately prosperous life, Aminah decides to help other people in need, but selectively, only helping those who help others. Soon, however, her good deeds draw the unwanted eye of Badr Al-Budur.

==Characters==

*Aminah Barnes: The main character and an orphaned beggar in the city Al-Kal&#x27;as, Aminah approaches the princess hoping for sympathy and gets knocked on the head with the jinni&#x27;s lamp instead. Since she was raised in a comfortably middle-class family before being orphaned, she treats the jinni with politeness and sympathy, eventually earning his affection. With a moderately large sum of wealth, she purchases a house and takes in first Idris as a manservant and then Barra as cook. Aminah wishes for the ability to travel through time and space at will in order to fulfil a dream she shared with her father. Eager to help the poor but disenchanted with humanity&#x27;s greed after practically starting a riot by giving too much to the beggars in the market, she adds to this ability an orb with which to seek out the best people to help in order to help others. Using these two abilities, she helps a tailor and foster-father of thirteen named Ahab and the selfless baker Hassan in their respective trades. Eventually, she is forced to rescue Hassan from Badr&#x27;s dungeon and concoct a plan to escape Al-Kal&#x27;as. Over the course of the book, she also goes by the names Zubaydah and Zaynab, as well as impersonating an angel and is eventually revealed to be Cinderella&#x27;s fairy godmother.

*Princess Badr Al-Budur: The spoiled and ambitious daughter of the Sultan, her name literally means &#x27;full moon of full moons&#x27; because of her great beauty. She schemes with the captain of her guard, Saladin, to assassinate Aladdin and use the jinni to seize the throne, but has much difficulty locating Aminah because she underestimates the girl&#x27;s wits by looking only for beggar girls, especially ones with too much money.

*Jinni: The jinni of Aladdin&#x27;s bottle, he at first holds only contempt for Aminah and the human race as a whole, but begins to soften towards her as she does things no other master has, such as accepting the rules of wishing and offering him food. In order to be able to play chess against Aminah and spend more time out of the bottle, he takes on the form of the human he once was and the name Uncle Omar, after Aminah&#x27;s father, who he looks much like. Over time, he does become something of a father figure and even threatens Hassan with all kinds of bodily harm, should Hassan ever take advantage of Aminah. At Aminah&#x27;s urging and with her help, Jinni discovers he was once a ruthless landlord named Gindar who loved only his sister. When Aminah offers to go back in time and stop him from becoming a jinni, he declines, fearing both a relapse for those he has helped and causing a time paradox. Though very much a paternal figure for Aminah, he enjoys confusing her, primarily by making references to future things like pizza, Galileo, and New York City.

*Hassan: The handsome and orphaned son of a merchant, Hassan first meets Aminah outside the city while she is still dressed as a beggar and he is traveling with a caravan to pay off his father&#x27;s debt to the Sultan. Aminah does not see him again until she uses her orb to search the city for a worthy soul and finds him in his bakery. In the interim, Hassan used what little money he has to set up a bakery, but rather than selling any bread, he gives all of it away to beggars and thus becomes impoverished. Aminah gives him, through wishes, several jars that will fill with any ingredient at his command, the ability to heat and cool ovens instantly, and baking knowledge that would not become common for several centuries (with this, he makes angel food cake and cream puffs). After the first meeting, Aminah never doubt&#x27;s Hassan&#x27;s loyalty or sincerity. As a result, Hassan and Aminah begin to develop a secret relationship by meeting after dark in the bakery, though everyone in Aminah&#x27;s household soon discover it, one way or another. His earlier traveling companion, Rashid, reports his doings to the Princess and Hassan is captured and tortured, but gives up no information on Aminah. After being rescued with a wish, Jinni sends him ahead to Tyre inside his special pots.

*Idris: Aminah initially encounters Idris in a marketplace, where she uses him in a charade to divert the palace guards. Idris offers her his help, but she refuses until she meets him again in a horse market. Initially, she keeps him around in order to escape notice as an unescorted woman, but his eye for every marketable goods proves valuable. He develops feelings for Aminah, but is rebuffed and begins to keep his distance from the house, as well as staying behind when the rest move to Tyre. After they leave, he is implied to have become a traveling storyteller.

*Barra: Comes to the house to be Aminah&#x27;s cook. Aminah never doubts her loyalty and Barra is only one of two characters in the book of whom this can be said. Barra eventually becomes a mother figure for Aminah and is attracted to Jinni, though she wants to have nothing to do with demons or magic. Aminah wishes for Barra to live long enough to see her great-grandchildren grow up and thus saves her life when a guard slits Barra&#x27;s throat.

<doc id="827126" wikidata="Q7603662" url="?curid=827126" title="State bureau of investigation">
<text>A state bureau of investigation (SBI) is a state-level detective agency in the United States. They are plainclothes agencies that usually investigate criminal cases involving the state and/or multiple jurisdictions. They also typically provide technical support to local agencies in the form of laboratory and/or record services, or to directly assist in the investigation of cases at the local agency&#x27;s request.

An SBI is a state&#x27;s equivalent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, but can include investigative jurisdiction similar to other federal law enforcement agencies as well. The SBIs investigate all manner of cases assigned to them by their state&#x27;s laws and usually report to their state&#x27;s attorney general, or in some cases, directly to their state&#x27;s governor.

SBIs can also exist either independently or within a state Department of Public Safety/Department of Justice (which is an umbrella agency coordinating and/or controlling the various state-level law enforcement agencies) or a state police force (which is a general law enforcement agency).

<doc id="827135" wikidata="Q3694294" url="?curid=827135" title="Corrado Parducci">
<text>Corrado Giuseppe Parducci (March 10, 1900 – November 22, 1981) was an Italian-American architectural sculptor who was a celebrated artist for his numerous early-20th century works.

==Early life and education==
Parducci was born to Giulio Parducci and Zelinda Petragnani in Buti, Italy, a small village near Pisa, and immigrated to New York City in the United States in 1904. At a young age, he was sponsored by heiress/sculptor Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney and sent to art school. He attended the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design and Art Students League. His teachers included anatomist George Bridgman and sculptor Albin Polasek.

==Training and career==
Parducci was apprenticed to architectural sculptor Ulysses Ricci in 1917. While working for Ricci, and later while in the Anthony DiLorenzo studio, his work came to the attention of Detroit architect Albert Kahn.

In 1924 Parducci traveled to Detroit to work for Kahn, only planning to stay for a few months. However, with the automotive industry booming in the 1920s, Parducci moved his family to Michigan and ended up spending the rest of his career working from Detroit. One of Parducci&#x27;s known Detroit studios was located at Cass Ave. and Sibley St., but it has been demolished. Parducci&#x27;s studio had tall windows which illuminated his work. Parducci&#x27;s work can be found on many of the Detroit area&#x27;s finest buildings including churches, schools, banks, hospitals, and residences.
His sculptures can be found in most major Michigan cities including Ann Arbor, Dearborn, Flint, Grand Rapids, Jackson, Kalamazoo, Marquette, Royal Oak, Saginaw, Midland and Ypsilanti. By the end of his long and productive career, Parducci&#x27;s efforts adorned about 600 buildings.

The last commission Parducci completed was a portrait of architect Henry Hobson Richardson in a Romanesque setting that was carved on a lintel in the Senate chamber of the New York State Capitol in Albany, New York in 1980.

Although Parducci worked in a variety of styles, notably Romanesque, Classical, Renaissance, and even Aztec/Mayan/Pueblo Deco, it was his pioneering of the Greco Deco style for which he is best remembered.

==Parducci&#x27;s Detroit Masonic Temple lobby==
Anthony Di Lorenzo, New York ornamentalist, held two contracts for interior decoration in the Detroit Masonic Temple - #1 (Corrado Parducci) $13,160.00 and #2 for $9,680.00. Thomas Di Lorenzo&#x27;s contract for interior decoration amounted to $59,074.00. Joe (Corrado) Parducci worked in the New York firm of Ricci, Ardolino and Di Lorenzo as a very young man. When the firm broke up, he stayed with DiLorenzo who was an ornamentalist and Parducci was the sculptor. Parducci met Albert Kahn in New York City who urged him to come to Detroit and work on two bank buildings on Griswold Street. Parducci came to Detroit to work for only a couple of months. Anthony DiLorenzo had some work here and Kahn wanted Parducci. He worked indirectly for Kahn through DiLorenzo. Other work came from Detroit architects Donaldson &amp; Meier, Smith, Hinchman &amp; Grylls, and George D. Mason.

The first 8 months, 1924 to middle of 1925, Parducci worked under DiLorenzo. The Masonic Temple contracts were DiLorenzos&#x27; jobs until Parducci bought them out for $5,000.00.

Parducci&#x27;s lobby design was reportedly adapted from an old castle in Palermo, Sicily. Parducci did model the 5&#x27; bronze floor plaque depicting Strength, Truth and Beauty. He sculpted the two plaques in the stone walls of the interior stairs of the Scottish Rite entrance. These two are repeated in the lobby as plaster plaques.

On 1 April 1935 it was enlarged by the addition of the parishes of Lidgate and Ousden from the disbanded Moulton Rural District, Cavendish and Hawkedon from the Melford Rural District and Depden from the Thingoe Rural District. It was named after and administered from Clare. 

Since 1 April 1974 it has formed part of the borough of St Edmundsbury which became West Suffolk district in 2019.

<text>Seth Pomeroy (May 20, 1706 – February 19, 1777) was an American gunsmith and soldier from Northampton, Massachusetts. His military service included the French and Indian War and the early stages of the American Revolutionary War. He fought as a private soldier in the Battle of Bunker Hill, but was later appointed a major general in the Massachusetts militia.

==Private life==
Seth was born in Northampton, Province of Massachusetts Bay, to Ebeneezer and Sarah (King) Pomeroy. His father was a prominent local citizen, and had been a Major in the militia. Seth became a mechanic and gunsmith, as well as joining the local militia in Hampshire County. He earned a reputation as one of the best gunsmiths in the colony.

Pomeroy married Mary Hunt (1705–1777) on December 14, 1732. They had nine children: Seth (b.1733), Quartus (b.1735), Medad (b.1736), Lemuel (b.1738), Martha (b.1740), Mary (b.1742), Sarah (b. 1744), A child born in 1747, and Asahel (b.1749).

==King George&#x27;s War==
When Massachusetts undertook an expedition against the French in Nova Scotia, Major Pomeroy answered Governor William Shirley&#x27;s call for volunteers. He was part of the expedition led by William Pepperrell that captured Fortress Louisbourg in Nova Scotia in 1745. He used his professional skills in support of Richard Gridley, the expedition&#x27;s chief engineering officer. He reconditioned the guns captured from an outlying position after the French had spiked them and supported 46 days of heavy bombardment.

==French and Indian War==
In 1755, Lt. Colonel Pomeroy was second in command of the regiment led by Colonel Ephraim Williams. They marched to New York to support a move to capture Crown Point.

While on the march, they were ambushed by a force of 800 French and Canadian troops, supported by 600 Iroquois warriors, and led by Baron Dieskau at the Battle of Lake George. Of all the commanding officers, Pomeroy was the only one to survive the battle, and in lieu of Williams&#x27; death assumed the rank of Colonel. Although suffering significant losses, they withdrew to the English camp at the south end of Lake George. There they built a hasty wall of wood and carts and made their stand, supported by cannon and additional forces under General William Johnson. The natives and Canadians would not attack in the open. When Baron Dieskau was wounded, the entire French force withdrew for Fort Carillon (later called Fort Ticonderoga).

Dieskau was captured, and Johnson would build a more permanent Fort William Henry to protect the site.

==American Revolutionary War==

Although a senior officer in the Massachusetts militia at the start of the war, Pomeroy had a limited role. He was, after all, nearly seventy years old. But when the Siege of Boston began in 1775, he was among the volunteers that went in support of it. On June 17, a British naval bombardment marked the start of the Battle of Bunker Hill. He borrowed a horse from General Artemas Ward and set out for Charlestown. When he reached the neck of the peninsula, he found troops piled up because the narrow strip was under fire from British warships. Giving the horse to a soldier to return, he shouldered his musket and marched through the barrage. He declined any command, but took a post at the rail fence, fighting with John Stark&#x27;s 1st New Hampshire Regiment.

The next week, the Continental Congress named him a brigadier general in the Continental Army. Since his health was not the best, when difficulties arose about seniority, he declined this commission and served instead as a major general in the Massachusetts militia.

When General George Washington asked for support in New Jersey the following year, Pomeroy marched with his militia unit. He didn&#x27;t complete the trip, but fell ill and died in Peekskill, New York. He is buried in St. Peter&#x27;s Churchyard, in an unmarked grave. The churchyard is now part of Hillside Cemetery.

Honoring Seth Pomeroy in Hillside Cemetery is an estimated 26-foot high monument, being a large square base, a column, and a ball on top. Inscribed in a wreath on one side is &quot;General Seth Pomeroy. Born at Northampton, Mass., May 20th 1706. Died near this spot Feb. 19th 1777.&quot; Inscribed on another side is a quote from him dated February 11, 1777, at Peekskill, perhaps referring to his facing his last days: &quot;I go cheerfully, for I am sure the cause we are engaged in is just, and the call I have to it is clear, and the call of God.&quot;
