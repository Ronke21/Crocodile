<text>Fotbal Club Sheriff Tiraspol (), commonly known as Sheriff Tiraspol or simply Sheriff, is a professional football club based in Tiraspol, a city located in the unrecognised breakaway state of Transnistria, that plays in the Super Liga, the top tier of Moldovan football. Founded in 1997 as &quot;Tiras Tiraspol&quot; and rebranded the following year as &quot;Sheriff&quot;, it quickly established itself within Moldovan football.

&quot;The Wasps&quot; recorded their debut in the first league in the 1998–99 season, when they also won their first trophy, the Moldovan Cup. They have since amassed 21 championship titles, 12 Cups, and seven Super Cups–all competition records. On the European stage, Sheriff has reached the group stage of the UEFA Europa League on six occasions and in 2021 became the first ever Moldovan side to reach the group stages of the UEFA Champions League, where they would go on to notch a win against eventual champions Real Madrid before eventually bowing out of the competition.

The club takes its current name from its main sponsor, Sheriff, a company which operates nearly all forms of profitable private industries in Transnistria. Home games are played in yellow and black kits at the Sheriff Arena, to which the club moved in 2002 and which has a capacity of 12,746.

==History==

The club was originally established in 1996 and introduced in the Moldovan &quot;B&quot; Division as &quot;FC Tiras Tiraspol&quot;. On 4 April 1997, former KGB officer Viktor Gushan, owner of the conglomerate Sheriff which remains a key sponsor, renamed it FC Sheriff Tiraspol.

Sheriff achieved promotion to the second tier of Moldovan football, the Moldovan &quot;A&quot; Division, and under the guidance of Ahmad Alaskarov was charged with leading the team to the Moldovan top division. Later that year the club won the championship by 14 points, being promoted to Divizia Națională. The club won its first major honour with the 1999 Moldovan Cup. In the final at the Republican Stadium, Sheriff scored an injury-time equaliser before winning the match against Constructorul Chișinău 2–1 after extra time. Sheriff&#x27;s first National Division title came in the 2000–01 season, which also included their second Moldovan Cup triumph as they beat Nistru Otaci on penalties after a goalless match. The league triumph was the first of a run of ten consecutively up to 2010, also including league-cup doubles in 2002, 2006 and 2008–10. Sheriff won each Moldovan Super Cup from 2004 to 2010, but did not have to play a match on four occasions due to winning it on default through a double. Sheriff were denied an 11th-straight title by Dacia Chișinău in 2010–11, but reclaimed the title the following season. In 2014–15, Sheriff again lost the championship despite being level with both Milsami Orhei and Dacia Chișinău at the top of the table with 55 points; Milsami would finish in first place because of its superior head-to-head record against both Sheriff and Dacia, with Dacia second and Sheriff third, despite Sheriff having the superior goal difference amongst the clubs.

The team won the Commonwealth of Independent States Cup in 2003 and 2009, becoming the first team from Moldova to win an international title. Sheriff were the first club in Moldova to sign players from Brazil and Africa.

===Europe===

From 2001–02 to 2008–09, the club tried to reach the group stage in the UEFA Champions League every year, but failed in the second qualifying round every time. Its European fortunes improved after 2009. Sheriff has appeared in three UEFA Europa League group stages (2009–10, 2010–11, 2013–14) with decent results, although they didn&#x27;t manage to qualify to the knock-out stage. In 2017, they qualified to the group stage for the fourth time, after beating favourites Legia Warsaw on away goals in the play-off round.

====2009–10 UEFA Europa League====
In the 2009–10 season, Sheriff finally reached the third qualifying round when they defeated Inter Turku. In the next round, Sheriff defeated Slavia Prague 1–1 on aggregate, progressing via the away goal rule due to Nadson&#x27;s 94th-minute strike in the second leg. They were then eliminated from the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League by Greek club Olympiacos in the qualifying play-off for a spot in the group stage. Sheriff lost 2–0 in the first leg at home, and 1–0 in the second leg away.

However, by virtue of losing in the play-off round, Sheriff qualified for the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League group stage, where they were drawn into Group H alongside Fenerbahçe, Twente and Steaua București. On 17 September 2009, their first Europa League match, Sheriff drew 0–0 away against Steaua. On 1 October, Sheriff&#x27;s first Europa League home match, the club lost 1–0 to Fenerbahçe. On 22 October, Sheriff produced a stunning 2–0 home victory over Twente, ending Twente&#x27;s 17-match unbeaten run. 2 December, Sheriff drew 1–1 at home with Steaua. Sheriff failed to progress past the group stage after finishing third in Group H with five points, ahead of Steaua.

====2010–11 UEFA Champions League====
In the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League, on 14–20 July 2010, Sheriff defeated Dinamo Tirana in the second qualifying round (3–1, 0–1). Then, on 4 August, the club defeated Dinamo Zagreb on penalties (6–5) after identical 1–1 draws at home and away, thereby reaching the play-off round. On 18–24 August, in the play-off round against Basel, Sheriff lost 1–0 in Switzerland before losing 3–0 at home.

====2010–11 UEFA Europa League====
Dropping to the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League after their play-off defeat to Basel, Sheriff was drawn into Group E alongside Dynamo Kyiv, AZ and BATE Borisov. After losing their first match 2–1 away against AZ on 15 September 2010, on 30 September, Sheriff defeated Dynamo Kyiv 2–0 at home. After losing two-straight matches against BATE – 0–1 at home and 3–1 away on 21 October and 4 November respectively – on 2 December, Sheriff drew 1–1 with AZ at home, then on 15 December, Sheriff drew 0–0 against Dynamo Kyiv away in Kyiv. Accumulating five points, Sheriff failed to progress past the group stage after finishing last in Group E.

====2013–14 UEFA Europa League====

In the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League, Sheriff played in a group with Tottenham Hotspur, Anzhi Makhachkala and Tromsø, in which they finished third.

====2017–18 UEFA Europa League====
In the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League, Sheriff played in a group with Lokomotiv Moscow, Copenhagen, Fastav Zlín, in which they finished third once more.

====2021–22 UEFA Champions League====
In the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League, Sheriff became the first Moldovan team to qualify for the group stages of the competition after a 3–0 aggregate win over Dinamo Zagreb. They were drawn into Group D to face Inter Milan, Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk. On 15 September, Sheriff won their opening group game, 2–0 against Shakhtar Donetsk, before following it up with an upset 2–1 away victory over Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu on 28 September 2021, with Sébastien Thill scoring the winning goal in the 89th minute. Despite losing their next three games against Inter Milan and Real Madrid, they secured qualification for the preliminary knockout round of the Europa League on 24 November 2021 when Shakhtar Donetsk lost to Inter Milan. They ended their campaign with a 1–1 away draw with Shakhtar Donetsk, which meant they ended up with a very respectable 7 points from their 6 games.

====2021–22 UEFA Europa League====
Sheriff had serious squad problems before the start of the UEFA Europa League knockout rounds. The departure of important players such as Cristiano da Silva Leite, Frank Castañeda, Danilo Arboleda, Dimitris Kolovos and Fernando Peixoto Costanza caused serious problems in the squad. Sheriff replaced all the departures with new players like Regi Lushkja, Gaby Kiki, Renan Guedes and Patrick Kpozo. However, the rules of the Moldovan championship allow teams to announce their new players from 23 February. Since the deadline for registration in the Europa League was February 2, coach Yuriy Vernydub was obliged to include players who had not played much in the starting line-up, such as Stjepan Radeljić, Stefanos Evangelou and Charles Petro. 

They were the first ever Moldovan side to play in the knockout stages of a European competition, and were drawn against S.C. Braga of Portugal. They won 2–0 in the initial home leg – with the goal scorers being Sébastien Thill and Adama Traoré in a game where Sheriff put in a solid performance despite having a vastly different squad to the one that stunned Real Madrid. Finally, the European campaign ended with a 2–0 defeat and a dramatic penalty shootout that ended 3–2 in favour of Braga.

==Stadium==
Sheriff Arena is the home ground of Sheriff Tiraspol and is owned by the corporation Sheriff. Construction of the ground began on 1 August 2000 and was completed in May 2002, with the official opening in July 2002. It was renovated in 2011. The stadium has a seating capacity for 12,746 spectators and is eligible for FIFA/UEFA international events. Beside Sheriff, the stadium has also hosted matches for FC Tiraspol and the Transnistria national football team.

Aside from the main arena of Sheriff Sports Complex, there is also an 8,000 seater stadium, Malaya Sportivnaya Arena, also situated in the same complex, along with eight training fields, a covered training centre, housing for the players, a college for students and a five-star hotel.

In June 2022, UEFA ordered that no European games would be permitted to be played in Transnistria, as a direct consequence of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Sheriff played all of their home fixtures in the 2022–23 UEFA Europa League and 2022–23 UEFA Europa Conference League at Zimbru Stadium in Chișinău.

<text>FC Gomel () is a Belarusian football club based in the city of Gomel. Their home stadium is Central Stadium.

== History ==
Teams from Gomel (usually city or raion selection or railway-based team &quot;Lokomotiv&quot;, but not always) played in the Belarusian SSR championships since the early 1920s. In 1946, Byelorussian SSR league for one season becomes one of the zones of the USSR 3rd level league, and &quot;Lokomotiv Gomel&quot; became the first city team to play in the Soviet league.

The modern Gomel team was founded in 1959 as &quot;Lokomotiv Gomel&quot;. They played at the 2nd level of Soviet football between 1959 and 1968. The results varied between seasons, as the team managed to finish 1st in their zone in 1962 as well as last in 1959 and 1963. However, because Soviet league system structure was changing almost every season in the 1950s and 1960s, Lokomotiv wasn&#x27;t promoted or relegated until another league reorganisation in 1969.

&quot;Gomselmash&quot; played at the 3rd level of Soviet football between 1969 and 1989, until further league reorganisation in 1990, after which the team was relegated to the 4th level.

In 1992, Gomselmash joined the newly formed Belarusian Premier League. The first years were unsuccessful and the team relegated in 1995. They changed name to the current one, FC Gomel, the same year. In 1998, Gomel returned to Premier League and achieved much better results than before (champions title in 2003, 2nd place in 2007 and 3rd in 1999). The team also won the Belarusian Cup in 2002 and made it to the final in 2004.

In 2012, they played English club Liverpool in the UEFA Europa League qualifying rounds. In the first leg they lost 0–1 and lost again away at Anfield in the second leg 3–0.

*1 Finished last in its zone, but saved from relegation due to 2nd level (&quot;Class B&quot;) expansion from 7 to 9 territorial zones (from 101 to 142 teams) in 1960.
*2 No promotion to the Top League in 1962 was awarded due to Top League (&quot;Class A&quot;) reduction from 22 to 20 teams in 1963. Lokomotiv&#x27;s play-off performance didn&#x27;t affect its next season league allocation. Winning their zone allowed them to stay on the second level (&quot;Class B&quot;), which was reduced from 10 zones (150 teams) in 1962 to a single group of 18 teams in 1963.
*3 Finished last, but saved from relegation due to 2nd level (&quot;Class A Second Group&quot;) expansion from 18 to 27 teams in 1964.

<text>Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi (), commonly known as HJK Helsinki (), or simply as HJK (), is a Finnish football club based in Helsinki. The club competes in Veikkausliiga, the top division of the Finnish football league system. Founded in 1907, the club has spent most of its history in the top tier of Finnish football. The club&#x27;s home ground is the 10,770-seat Bolt Arena, where they have played their home games since 2000.

Generally considered as Finland&#x27;s biggest club, HJK is the most successful Finnish club in terms of championship titles with 33. The club has also won 14 Finnish Cups and 6 Finnish League Cups. Many of Finland&#x27;s most successful players have played for HJK before moving abroad. The club has also similar success with women&#x27;s Kansallinen Liiga.

HJK is the only Finnish club that has participated in the UEFA Champions League group stage. In 1998, they beat Metz in the play-off round to clinch their place in the competition for the following season. HJK have also participated twice in the group stages of the UEFA Europa League in 2014–15 and 2022–23 respectively, along with appearing three times in the UEFA Europa Conference League. The club&#x27;s highest score in a European competition came during the 2011–12 season, with a 13–0 aggregate victory over Welsh champions Bangor City, which included a 10–0 home win.

HJK&#x27;s traditional kit colours have long been blue and white striped shirts with blue shorts and socks. The club&#x27;s crest has been nearly untouched for a century, it has only undergone one minor font change in order to modernize it.

==History==
===20th century===
The club was founded as Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi – Helsingfors Fotbollsklubb in 1907 by Fredrik Wathén. The founding meeting was held at a bowling alley in Kaisaniemi Park in May. The first ever competitive fixture was played against Ekenäs IF in Ekenäs. HJK won 2–4.

Early on, HJK became popular amongst Finnish-speaking students, while Swedish-speaking students preferred to play mainly for Unitas or HIFK. In late 1908, after a heated debate, the language was switched to unilingually Finnish and this resulted in many Swedish-speaking members switching over to HIFK and other clubs, although a few chose to stay.

In 1909, the colours blue and white were chosen to support the fennoman movement and bandy was introduced as the club&#x27;s second official sport. The club moved from Kaisaniemi Ground to the new Eläintarha Stadium. At the end of the year, Fredrik Wathen was forced to leave his post as the club&#x27;s chairman due to illness.

In 1910, Lauri Tanner became the longest-running club chairman to date. The same year, the club&#x27;s first international match was played, against Eriksdals IF from Stockholm in Kaisaniemi. The first championship title was won in 1911. In 1915, the club moved to newly build Töölön Pallokenttä. In 1916, tennis was introduced as the third official sport in HJK, and it was played in the club until the early 1920s. During the Finnish Civil War in 1918, two HJK club members, fighting for the &quot;Whites&quot;, were killed.

In 1921, the first bandy championship was won and during the following five seasons, HJK reached five finals, winning three more titles. Bowling was added to the club&#x27;s repertoire in 1925, but the bowlers formed their own club, Helsingin Keilaajat, the following year. In 1928, ice hockey became an official sport and the first championship was won in 1929. League format was introduced to Finnish football in 1930 but HJK failed to qualify for the first season. In 1931, HJK played their first season in the league, however at the end of the season, they were relegated.

During World War II, HJK lost 22 members serving in the military, of which nine fell in the Winter War, twelve in the Continuation War and one in the Lapland War. In 1943, handball was introduced as the club&#x27;s sixth official sport. HJK won one silver and two bronze medals in handball during the following three seasons but did not gain further success. Handball was first of HJK&#x27;s sports where women also competed. The women&#x27;s team played a total of 22 seasons at the highest level; their highest finish was fourth.

In 1963, HJK played their last ever season in the second level of the football pyramid, winning 20 out of 22 matches and scoring 127 goals. In 1964, the newly promoted club won their tenth championship title and the following season, in 1965–66, they played their first European Cup match, against Manchester United at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium. However, a 2–9 aggregate loss resulted in HJK&#x27;s elimination from the competition.

In 1966, the club secured their first ever cup title by winning KTP 6–1 in the final in front of 7,000 spectators. Bandy section was disbanded in the late 1960s. The last official sport, figure skating, was added into the club&#x27;s repertoire in 1966, was abolished in 1972. The ice hockey section was also disbanded in 1972 and the last season in handball was played in 1978. Hereafter, HJK therefore only participated in football following 69 years as a multisport club.

===1998–1999: First Champions League appearance===
The 1998–99 season saw HJK become the first and, to date, only Finnish club to play in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League, after defeating Metz in the second qualifying round. The club also managed a respectable five points in their group, defeating Benfica at home and earning draws at home to 1. FC Kaiserslautern and away to Benfica. They lost to PSV twice and to Kaiserslautern away.

===2000–2018: First Europa League appearance===
The club&#x27;s current home stadium, the Bolt Arena, was opened in 2000. The 20th championship title was won in 2002, and in 2008 the club won its tenth Finnish Cup title. The 2009 season was the start of a championship run that resulted in six titles in a row from 2009 to 2014.

In 2014, HJK became the first Finnish club to play in the UEFA Europa League group stage after defeating Rapid Wien in the play-off round. HJK, with wins over Torino and Copenhagen at home, finished third in their group with six points.

HJK made several acquisitions during the winter of 2015, including Córdoba forward Mike Havenaar, J-league playmaker Atomu Tanaka and Birmingham City holding midfielder Guy Moussi. With the new signings on their side, HJK began the season on a high by winning the league cup, a feat they had not accomplished since 1998. HJK also played its first local derby against HIFK since April 1972, drawing 1–1. However, HJK could not replicate the league success they had enjoyed for the last six seasons, finishing the 2015 season in third place, behind champions SJK and runners-up RoPS.

During the 2017 campaign the club lost only three games, which resulted in a domestic double.

HJK won the 2018 Veikkausliiga, 16 points clear at the top.

===2019–2023: Toni Koskela era===
HJK failed to win the 2019 championship, as KuPS won the league. HJK&#x27;s season was unusually unsuccessful, manager Mika Lehkosuo was replaced by Toni Koskela mid-season, and the club finished in a disappointing 5th place in the league with 37 points. During the season, HJK named Miika Takkula their new sporting director in July.

Koskela&#x27;s first three full seasons have seen HJK win three titles in a row, including the club&#x27;s 30th championship in 2020. HJK also won the Finnish cup in 2020. For the 2022 season, HJK loaned in some new additions like Conor Hazard, Nassim Boujellab, Bojan Radulović and Malik Abubakari. The club&#x27;s 2022 title was a remarkable 11th in 15 years.

The club has also fared well in European competitions under Koskela. During the 2021 season, HJK qualified for the 2021–22 UEFA Europa Conference League group stage, where they finished 3rd in the group with six points. During the 2022 season, HJK qualified for the 2022–23 UEFA Europa League for only the second time in the club&#x27;s history, by defeating Silkeborg IF 2–1 on aggregate in the play-off round. HJK&#x27;s group included Italian AS Roma, Spanish Real Betis, and Bulgarian Ludogorets. Despite valiant home performances, HJK performed poorly on the road, losing all three away games with a total goal difference of 0–7. HJK ended the campaign fourth in the group with a single point, from a 1–1 draw to Ludogorets at home.

HJK started the 2023 Veikkausliiga season relatively poorly, and eventually head coach Koskela was dismissed, following a 1–0 home victory against Larne FC in the Champions League qualifiers in July.

===2023: Korkeakunnas===
Koskela was replaced by his last season&#x27;s assistant coach Toni Korkeakunnas. Korkeakunnas led HJK to a third consecutive European group stage, advancing to the 2023–24 UEFA Europa Conference League, by defeating Romanian champions Farul Constanța in the play-off round 3–2 on aggregate. HJK also renewed their league title for the fourth straight season, on a goal difference against KuPS.

After the season, the club announced that Korkeakunnas will not receive a contract extension, and that the new manager would be announced soon. It was also announced earlier in late August 2023, that sporting director Miika Takkula departs from the club. In September, Vesa Mäki was named as his replacement as a new sporting director.

===2024: Sibila and Virta===
On 3 November 2023, the club announced that they had appointed Spanish coach Ferran Sibila as the manager of HJK on a two-year deal, starting in January 2024. On 21 December 2023, it was reported by Helsingin Sanomat that Sibila lacks the required UEFA Pro -coaching licence, and thus would not be eligible to work solely as a head coach in Veikkausliiga. The club&#x27;s new sporting director Vesa Mäki, who was in charge of recruiting Sibila, said in the media that Sibila is going to start the required UEFA Pro -training in February 2024 in Sweden, or the club could name their assistant coach Ossi Virta as an associate head coach with Sibila.

On 3 January 2024, it was reported in Swedish media that Sibila was not granted a spot in the aforementioned UEFA Pro -training class by Swedish FA. The next day, HJK announced that the club will comply with the licence requirements set by Veikkausliiga, Finnish FA and UEFA. On 12 January 2024, HJK appointed Ossi Virta as the club&#x27;s new interim head coach, until Sibila is able to attend the UEFA Pro -class.

During the 2024 pre-season, reigning Veikkausliiga Top Goalscorer Bojan Radulović was sold to Huddersfield Town for £1.2 million and Defender of the Year Tuomas Ollila was acquired by Paris FC.

===2024–present: Korkeakunnas returns===
On 20 May 2024, Ferran Sibila and the sporting director Vesa Mäki were both sacked and Toni Korkeakunnas was appointed the head coach of the first team again.

Winger Topi Keskinen joined Aberdeen FC in August for an estimated transfer fee of around €1 million. During the summer of 2024, as has become routine, HJK made a slate of transfers mid-season as the team’s form remained poor. The club brought in striker and former Veikkausliiga golden boot winner Lee Erwin, goalkeeper Thijmen Nijhuis, centre-backs Georgios Antzoulas and Daniel O&#x27;Shaughnessy, midfielder Kevor Palumets, and wingers Alessandro Albanese and Ozan Kökcü. Despite being knocked out of the Champions League earlier in the 1st qualifying round by Panevėžys, HJK managed to qualify for the 2024–25 UEFA Conference League new league phase, after defeating KÍ Klaksvík in the play-off round 3–2 on aggregate with two stoppage-time goals, making it the club&#x27;s fourth consecutive appearance in the final phase of a European competition. During the club&#x27;s European qualification campaign, Erwin scored five goals in six matches, including three goals over the two games against Klaksvik.

After HJK was not able to defend their championship and had finished third in Veikkausliiga, in late October 2024 the club appointed Petri Vuorinen the new sporting director to fill the vacancy.

==Crest and colours==

===Badge===
In 1910, HJK arranged competition to find a crest for club, but the club board wasn&#x27;t happy with the proposals. The crest was finally designed by Osmo Korvenkontio in 1913, it has only gone through minor changes during history.

===Colours===
First kit of HJK was plain white shirt, black shorts and black socks with few white horizontal stripes on top. In 1909 HJK introduced its trademark blue and white striped shirt. Blue and white colours were homage to fennoman movement. Black trunks still remained for decades. Shirt was changed to unicolour blue for season 1973 due to pressure from sponsors. In attempt to professionalize hockey department club had fallen in to financial despair and sponsors demanded more visibility for their logos. Clubs financial situation had improved by 1986 and due fans demands shirt was changed back to striped by the end of the year and has remained so ever since.

==Supporters and rivalries==
HJK Helsinki supporters
Historically HJK had a wide support within Finnish speaking, prosperous middle class of Helsinki. The club&#x27;s supporters were often nationalistic after the fashion of almost every other Finnish FA club at the time. Leftist working class&#x27; clubs played their own leagues and competitions under the Finnish Workers&#x27; Sports Federation. However, The club remained open to all &#x27;honorable citizens&#x27; regardless of their native language, race or social class, and always had members from other communities as well. Before the 1970s HJK came to be known especially as a Töölöan club due to most of their activity taking place in this particular district.

During recent decades the club&#x27;s old image as a prosperous, middle class group from Töölö has largely disappeared due to social changes in Finland as well as migration from inner city to housing projects built during the mass migration from the countryside during the 1960s and the 1970s.

===The Helsinki Derby and other local rivalries===
HJK&#x27;s main rivals in Helsinki were widely considered to be Kiffen, HPS and HIFK. In the past these were the four big clubs from Helsinki. The clubs were mainly separated by language, HJK and HPS being Finnish speaking clubs whereas HIFK and KIF were Swedish speaking. These four clubs competed also in bandy, ice hockey and handball. The support for HJK mainly came from around the inner city and after 1940s also from Töölö, in its early years HPS Support came from same areas as HJK. Later in 1940s and 1950s when HJK support shifted more towards Töölö area, HPS gained more support in Vallila and Alppila districts, this was mostly due their youth activities taking part in those particular areas, these boundaries were not strict however and each of the four clubs had support, players and members across the city. HJK were already founding youth teams to new suburbs in 1960s and their reputation as a Töölöan club was short lived. KIF and HPS were both struggling to survive and were both relegated to lower leagues after 1964 season and rapidly lost their support. KIF made a brief two season stint to first level in 1977–78. While both KIF and HPS are still active as of 2020, they have spend their recent decades playing in lower levels, HPS focusing more on youth football in northern Helsinki.

HJK and HIFK share the biggest rivalry being two of the oldest and most successful clubs. Both were also successful in Bandy which was major winter sport in the first half of the 20th century, KIF and HPS gained lesser success. Also in Ice Hockey clubs faced numerous times and played more seasons in first level than HPS or KIF. A match between these two clubs is called as Stadin derby. Language was the biggest separating factor between the clubs, HIFK was the club of choice for the Swedish speaking population of the city and HJK for the Finnish speaking. In 2015 HIFK was promoted back to the top flight after 40 years of struggling in the lower leagues having played their last season in the top division in 1972. Since HJK ceased their activity in other sports during the 1960s and 1970s the rivalry faded away on a large scale and in recent decades many even supported both clubs at the same time, HJK in football and HIFK in ice hockey. However, due to the rise of the Finnish supporter scene in the 2000s, there is a high tension between the most vocal supporters.

HJK shared a short but fierce rivalry with FC Jokerit around the late 1990s and the early 2000s. Jokerit were well supported due to their popular ice hockey section and the clubs also competed against each other in ice hockey in the late 1960s and the early 1970s.

Multiple Helsinki based clubs have played in the league but due to their short term visits and relatively low support base large scale rivalries were never born. Some notable clubs were Ponnistus, FinnPa, Pallo-Pojat and Helsingin Toverit.

===Helsinki-Lahti rivalry===
HJK has competed against Lahti based clubs from the 1960s, between 1964 and 1980 HJK and Lahden Reipas had a minor rivalry as both clubs gained good success winning some titles and were also generally well supported. Reipas also won seven cup titles against one of HJK. Reipas was relegated after 1980 season. More notable rivalry was against Kuusysi from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s. Between 1981 and 1992 HJK won six league titles against Kuusysi&#x27;s five, both clubs also won the cup twice, facing two times in the finals (which were both won by HJK). Both clubs also performed well in the European competitions. In 1996 both the Lahti clubs merged and FC Lahti was born, HJK and FC Lahti matches are more known from outside pitch activities, some crowd disturbances and small fights have occurred which otherwise are rare in Finnish football. Due to a relatively short distance between the two cities, these matches often draw more notable away support than others.

===HJK-Haka rivalry===
HJK and Valkeakosken Haka are the two most successful clubs in Finnish football, HJK with 27 league and 12 cup titles and Haka with 9 league and 12 cup titles. The match is also considered as &quot;urban vs. rural&quot; rivalry as HJK is a club from Finland&#x27;s biggest city Helsinki and Haka is representing the small town of Valkeakoski.

==Stadiums==
The club&#x27;s current home stadium is Bolt Arena, located in Töölö neighbourhood in Helsinki, where HJK has played their home matches since its completion in 2000. Initially the stadium had natural grass pitch, but in 2003 the surface was changed to artificial turf.

During their first years in 1907–1908, HJK played at the Kaisaniemen kenttä, and in 1909–1914 at the Eläintarha Stadium. HJK&#x27;s first official home ground was Töölön Pallokenttä where they played in 1915–1998. During the Veikkausliiga era, HJK played their home matches occasionally also at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium.

<text>Sgùrr Alasdair is the highest peak of the Black Cuillin, and the highest peak on the Isle of Skye and in the Inner Hebrides, and indeed in all the Scottish islands, at . Like the rest of the range it is composed of gabbro, a rock with excellent grip for mountaineering. It is named after Alexander Nicolson, who made the first recorded ascent in 1873. Prior to this the mountain had been locally known as Sgurr Biorach.

==Ascent==
As with other hills of the Cuillin, a head for heights and scrambling ability are needed to attain the summit. The least technical route follows a feature known as the &quot;Great Stone Chute&quot;, a scree gully that leads up from the corrie of Coire Lagan to a bealach just below the main ridge. From this col, a pleasant scramble (Grade 2 standard) up the well scratched east ridge leads to the narrow summit.

Other routes require scrambling ability or rock climbing; while there are rock climbs directly up the flanks, the only other way of reaching the summit via a ridge is the south-west ridge, a Grade 3 scramble that begins up a scratched chimney which can be accessed from the summit of Sgùrr Sgumain or from Coir&#x27; a&#x27; Ghrunnda; there is also a slightly easier route from the top of this chimney directly up a shallow gully on the south face. The summit of Sgùrr Alasdair can be attained by a short detour (from Sgùrr Theàrlaich) off the main ridge by climbers undertaking the full traverse of the Cuillin ridge, or by those following the circuit of Coire Lagan.

<doc id="830776" wikidata="Q5282068" url="?curid=830776" title="Discrete valuation">
<text>In mathematics, a discrete valuation is an integer valuation on a field &quot;K&quot;; that is, a function:

:formula_1

satisfying the conditions:

:formula_2
:formula_3
:formula_4

for all formula_5.

Note that often the trivial valuation which takes on only the values formula_6 is explicitly excluded.

A field with a non-trivial discrete valuation is called a discrete valuation field.

==Discrete valuation rings and valuations on fields==
To every field formula_7 with discrete valuation formula_8 we can associate the subring

::formula_9

of formula_7, which is a discrete valuation ring. Conversely, the valuation formula_11 on a discrete valuation ring formula_12 can be extended in a unique way to a discrete valuation on the quotient field formula_13; the associated discrete valuation ring formula_14 is just formula_12.

==Examples==
* For a fixed prime formula_16 and for any element formula_17 different from zero write formula_18 with formula_19 such that formula_16 does not divide formula_21. Then formula_22 is a discrete valuation on formula_23, called the p-adic valuation.
* Given a Riemann surface formula_24, we can consider the field formula_25 of meromorphic functions formula_26. For a fixed point formula_27, we define a discrete valuation on formula_7 as follows: formula_29 if and only if formula_30 is the largest integer such that the function formula_31 can be extended to a holomorphic function at formula_16. This means: if formula_33 then formula_34 has a root of order formula_30 at the point formula_16; if formula_37 then formula_34 has a pole of order formula_39 at formula_16. In a similar manner, one also defines a discrete valuation on the function field of an algebraic curve for every regular point formula_16 on the curve.

More examples can be found in the article on discrete valuation rings.

<text>Jeunesse Esch (full name Association Sportive la Jeunesse d&#x27;Esch/Alzette) is a professional football club based in Esch-sur-Alzette, in south-western Luxembourg. The side play in the National Division, the highest league in the country, and have won the league title on 28 occasions between 1921 and 2010, the most of any team in Luxembourg.

==History==
The club was founded in 1907 as Jeunesse la Frontière d&#x27;Esch in reference to the proximity of their stadium to the border with France. &quot;La frontière&quot; was dropped to give the club its current name in 1918, which it retained until World War II, where the Nazi regime implemented the German name SV Schwarz-Weiß 07 Esch and the club had to play in the &quot;Gauliga Moselland&quot;, finishing runners-up in the 1943–44 season. After the liberation of Luxembourg, the name reverted to AS la Jeunesse d&#x27;Esch.

Historically, Jeunesse Esch has been the most successful side in Luxembourgish football. They have won the National Division on 28 occasions: first in 1921, and most recently in 2010. This is a national record, unless Racing FC Union Luxembourg&#x27;s many predecessor clubs are counted together (they won a total of 28, divided between six incarnations). Jeunesse has also won the Luxembourg Cup on twelve occasions, second behind the fourteen won by FA Red Boys Differdange (now a part of FC Differdange 03). In total, they have completed the coveted Double on eight occasions.

They first entered the European Cup in 1958, but like most of Luxembourg&#x27;s clubs, failed to pass the preliminary rounds of the competition. Their most famous result came in the early stages of the 1973 competition when they held then-UEFA Cup holders Liverpool to a 1–1 draw at home before losing the second leg 2–0 at Anfield.

Jeunesse have continued their success into recent times, being one of the top three Luxembourgish clubs, along with F91 Dudelange and FC Etzella Ettelbruck, of the past few years. However, the club had a disastrous 2006–07 season, in which the club finished ninth, and only just avoided a relegation play-offs.

Jeunesse Esch is the only club from Luxembourg to have reached the second round of the European Cup, and it has achieved that feat on two occasions, both under the leadership of George Berry in the early years of the competition:
*In 1959–60, Jeunesse were drawn against ŁKS Łódź, champions of Poland. In an incredible first leg, Jeunesse put five past the Poles without reply, practically guaranteeing their place in the second round regardless of the return leg (in the event, Łódź won 2–1, but only after Jeunesse had gone ahead). In the next round, Jeunesse faced somewhat harder opponents: Real Madrid, champions of Europe four times in a row. The first match, in the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, was no contest, as Real Madrid trounced Jeunesse 7–0, with Puskás scoring a hat-trick. Despite their comfortable victory, Real Madrid took no chances in the second leg and fielded a full-strength team, including Puskás, Di Stéfano, and Gento. The array of stars did nothing to over-awe the Luxembourgers on their home patch; Jeunesse scored twice within fifteen minutes, and made a good account of themselves, but succumbed to lose 5–2, 12–2 on aggregate. Real went on to win the European Cup for a fifth straight season, beating Eintracht Frankfurt 7–3 in a memorable final.
*In the first round of the European Cup in 1963–64, Jeunesse was given a relatively easy tie against FC Haka. Although they had avoided the biggest sides in the competition, Jeunesse was facing the dominant Finnish side, and Jeunesse was thrashed 4–1 in Valkeakoski. In the return, Jeunesse mounted a comeback, but were winning by only 2–0 after 84 minutes. Suddenly, two goals in as few minutes put the Luxembourgish side through. The second round pitted Jeunesse against the Yugoslav champions, Partizan Belgrade for a place in the quarter-finals. Jeunesse won the first match 2–1, thanks to another late goal. However, the tie was turned on its head by four goals by Vladimir Kovačević, and Partizan won 6–2, and 7–4 on aggregate. 1963–64 turned out to be the &quot;annus mirabilis&quot; of Luxembourgish football, as the national team almost reached the semi-finals of the European Championship.

Overall, Jeunesse&#x27;s record in European competition reads:

<doc id="830780" wikidata="Q231224" url="?curid=830780" title="Suzanne Pleshette">
<text>Suzanne Pleshette (January 31, 1937 – January 19, 2008) was an American actress. Pleshette was known for her roles in theatre, film, and television. She was nominated for three Emmy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards. For her role as Emily Hartley on the CBS sitcom &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot; (1972–1978), she received two nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. 

Pleshette started her career in the theatre before gaining attention for her role in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s horror-thriller &quot;The Birds&quot; (1963). Her other notable film roles include &quot;Rome Adventure&quot; (1962), &quot;Support Your Local Gunfighter&quot; (1971), and &quot;Hot Stuff&quot; (1979). For her portrayal of Leona Helmsley in &quot;Leona Helmsley: The Queen of Mean&quot; (1990), she received nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Miniseries or Movie. She later voiced roles in &quot;The Lion King II: Simba&#x27;s Pride&quot; (1998) and &quot;Spirited Away&quot; (2001).

== Early life and education ==
Suzanne Pleshette was born on January 31, 1937, in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, to Geraldine (née Kaplan) and Eugene Pleshette. Her parents were Jewish, the children of emigrants from Russia and Austria-Hungary. Her mother was a dancer and artist who performed under the stage name Geraldine Rivers. Her father was a stage manager of the Paramount Theater in Manhattan and of the Paramount Theater in Brooklyn, and later, a network executive. She graduated from Manhattan&#x27;s High School of Performing Arts and attended Syracuse University for one semester, then transferred to Finch College. She later graduated from the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in Manhattan and was under the tutelage of acting teacher Sanford Meisner.

== Career ==
&quot;The Boston Globe&quot; described her appearance and demeanor as sardonic and her voice as sultry. Five-foot, four-inch Pleshette began her career at age 20 as a stage actress. She made her Broadway debut in Meyer Levin&#x27;s 1957 play &quot;Compulsion&quot;, adapted from his novel inspired by the Leopold and Loeb case. The following year, she performed in the debut of &quot;The Cold Wind and the Warm&quot; by S. N. Behrman at the Shubert Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut, directed by Harold Clurman and produced by Robert Whitehead. In 1959, she was featured in the comedy &quot;Golden Fleecing&quot;, starring Constance Ford and Tom Poston. (Poston would eventually become her third husband.) That same year, she was one of two finalists for the role of Louise/Gypsy in the original production of &quot;Gypsy&quot;. During the run of &quot;The Cold Wind and the Warm&quot;, she spent mornings taking striptease lessons from Jerome Robbins for the role in &quot;Gypsy&quot;. In his autobiography, Arthur Laurents, the play&#x27;s author stated, &quot;It came down to between Suzanne Pleshette and Sandra Church. Suzanne was the better actress, but Sandra was the better singer. We went with Sandra.&quot; In February 1961, she succeeded Anne Bancroft as Anne Sullivan Macy opposite 14-year-old Patty Duke&#x27;s Helen Keller in &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot;.

Her early screen credits include &quot;The Geisha Boy&quot; (1958), &quot;Rome Adventure&quot; (1962), &quot;Fate Is the Hunter&quot; (1964), and &quot;Youngblood Hawke&quot; (1962), but she was best known at that time for her role in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s suspense film &quot;The Birds&quot; (1963). Immediately following &quot;The Birds&quot;, Pleshette was cast in &quot;40 Pounds of Trouble&quot; (1962), a comedy film co-starring Tony Curtis and Phil Silvers, which Curtis was producing through his own film production company, Curtis Enterprises. &quot;40 Pounds of Trouble&quot; was the first motion picture ever filmed at Disneyland, and was distributed by Universal-International Pictures in late 1962. She worked with Steve McQueen in the 1966 western drama film &quot;Nevada Smith&quot;, was nominated for a Laurel Award for her starring performance in the comedy &quot;If It&#x27;s Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium&quot; opposite Ian McShane, and co-starred with James Garner in a pair of films, &quot;Support Your Local Gunfighter&quot; (1971) and the drama &quot;Mister Buddwing&quot; (1966).
Pleshette&#x27;s first screen role was in the episode &quot;Night Rescue&quot; (December 5, 1957) of the CBS adventure/drama television series &quot;Harbormaster&quot;, starring Barry Sullivan and Paul Burke. Other early television appearances include &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, &quot;Decoy&quot;, &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;, &quot;One Step Beyond&quot;, &quot;Riverboat&quot;, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;The Tab Hunter Show&quot;, &quot;Channing&quot;, &quot;Ben Casey&quot;, &quot;Naked City,&quot; &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, the pilot episode of &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, and &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;, for which she was nominated for her first Emmy Award. She guest-starred more than once as different characters in each of the following 1960s TV series: &quot;Route 66&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, &quot;The Invaders&quot;, &quot;The F.B.I.&quot;, &quot;Columbo (Dead Weight)&quot; (1971) and &quot;The Name of the Game&quot;.

1970 game show appearances include &quot;It Takes Two&quot;, with her husband, and &quot;Name Droppers&quot;.

On August 5, 1971, TV producers saw her on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; and noticed a certain chemistry between Suzanne and fellow guest Bob Newhart. She was cast as the wife of Newhart&#x27;s character on the popular CBS sitcom &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot; (1972–1978) for all six seasons, as part of CBS television&#x27;s Saturday night lineup. During this time she was nominated twice for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. She reprised her role of Emily Hartley in the final episode of Newhart&#x27;s subsequent comedy series, &quot;Newhart&quot;, in which viewers discovered that the entire later series had been her husband Bob&#x27;s dream when he awakens next to her in the bedroom set from the earlier series.

During this time she starred in films such as the western comedy &quot;Support Your Local Gunfighter&quot; (1971) starring James Garner. She also starred in a number of Walt Disney family films, most notably in &quot;The Shaggy D.A.&quot; (1976) acting opposite Dean Jones and Tim Conway. She was the lead actress in the comedies &quot;Hot Stuff&quot; (1979) opposite Dom DeLuise and Ossie Davis and &quot;Oh, God! Book II&quot; (1980) starring George Burns. Her 1984 situation comedy, &quot;Suzanne Pleshette Is Maggie Briggs&quot;, was canceled after seven episodes. In 1989, she played the role of Christine Broderick in the NBC drama, &quot;Nightingales&quot;, which lasted one season. In 1990, Pleshette portrayed Manhattan hotelier Leona Helmsley in the television movie &quot;Leona Helmsley: The Queen of Mean&quot;, which garnered her nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film. 

In addition, she starred opposite Hal Linden in the 1994 sitcom &quot;The Boys Are Back&quot;. She had a starring role in &quot;Good Morning, Miami&quot;, as Mark Feuerstein&#x27;s grandmother Claire Arnold in season one and played the mother of Katey Sagal&#x27;s character in the ABC sitcom &quot;8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter&quot; following John Ritter&#x27;s death. Pleshette provided the voices of Yubaba and Zeniba in the English dub of Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s Academy Award-winning film &quot;Spirited Away&quot; and the voice of Zira in Disney&#x27;s direct-to-video film &quot;The Lion King II: Simba&#x27;s Pride&quot; in 1998 (replacing Kathleen Turner) and sang the song &quot;My Lullaby&quot;. In her last role she appeared as the estranged mother of Megan Mullally&#x27;s character Karen Walker in three episodes of the NBC sitcom &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Friendships===
Madlyn Rhue was her &quot;oldest friend&quot;.

Pleshette appears in beach home movies filmed by Roddy McDowall in 1965.

=== Marriages ===
Pleshette&#x27;s 1964 marriage to her &quot;Rome Adventure&quot; and &quot;A Distant Trumpet&quot; co-star Troy Donahue ended in divorce after six months.

Her second husband was oilman &quot;Tommy&quot; Thomas Joseph Gallagher III (born January 28, 1934, in Galveston, Texas, to Thomas Joseph Gallagher Jr., and Toy Fay ), to whom she was married from March 16, 1968, to his death on January 21, 2000. He survived lung cancer, and later died of E. coli and was buried in Hillside Memorial Park, Culver City, Los Angeles, California. She suffered a miscarriage during her marriage to Gallagher, and they were childless. Asked about children in an October 2000 interview, Pleshette stated: &quot;I certainly would have liked to have had Tommy’s children. But my nurturing instincts are fulfilled in other ways. I have a large extended family; I&#x27;m the mother on every set. So if this is my particular karma, that&#x27;s fine.&quot;

In 2001, Pleshette married fellow actor Tom Poston. Poston had been a recurring guest star on &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot; in the 1970s and a &quot;Newhart&quot; cast member. But long before they worked together on television, Poston and Pleshette had been involved romantically in 1959, when they acted together in the Broadway comedy &quot;Golden Fleecing&quot;. During the subsequent 40 years, they married others but remained friends. After they were both widowed, the deaths of their spouses brought Poston and Pleshette together again, and they married in 2001. They remained married until his death from respiratory failure in Los Angeles on April 30, 2007.

Pleshette’s last public appearance was with the cast of “The Bob Newhart Show” at &quot;The Bob Newhart Show 35th Anniversary Reunion&quot; at PaleyLive LA, September 5, 2007, at the Paley Center for Media, in Beverly Hills. She died January 19, 2008.

Gallagher, Pleshette, and Poston are all interred close to each other in the Jewish Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery.

Suzanne Pleshette was the cousin of the actor John Pleshette.

=== Interests ===
From 1969 to 1980, Pleshette and Harriet Rosalind Dolin Stuart designed sheets for J.P. Stevens &amp; Co. She also wrote screenplays under a pen name. She also wrote poems, with some recited on &quot;The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson&quot;.

=== Illness and death ===
On August 11, 2006, Pleshette&#x27;s agent Joel Dean announced that she was being treated for lung cancer at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Three days later, &quot;The Herald-Palladium&quot; reported that Dean said the cancer was the size of &quot;a grain of sand&quot; when it was found during a routine X-ray, that the cancer was &quot;caught very much in time&quot;, that she was receiving chemotherapy as an outpatient and that Pleshette was &quot;in good spirits&quot;.

She was later hospitalized for a pulmonary infection and developed pneumonia which caused her to remain in the hospital for an extended period of time. She arrived at a &quot;Bob Newhart Show&quot; cast reunion in September 2007 in a wheelchair, which raised concern about her health, although she insisted that she was &quot;cancer-free&quot;. (She was seated in a regular chair during the actual telecast.) During an interview in &quot;USA Today&quot; given at the time of the reunion, Pleshette stated that she had been released four days earlier from the hospital where, as part of her cancer treatment, part of one of her lungs had been removed.

Pleshette died on January 19, 2008 in her Los Angeles home. She is buried close to her third husband, Tom Poston (who died the previous year), in the Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California. She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Television on January 31, 2008, the walk&#x27;s 2,355th star, which was placed (at her request) in front of Frederick&#x27;s of Hollywood. Bob Newhart, Arte Johnson, and Marcia Wallace spoke at the star&#x27;s unveiling which had been planned before Pleshette&#x27;s death. Tina Sinatra accepted the star on Pleshette&#x27;s behalf.

<text>Telefónica Ireland was a broadband and telecommunications provider in Ireland that traded under the O2 brand (typeset as O2). O2 Ireland was previously called Esat Digifone when it was owned by Esat Telecommunications (and Telenor) from 1997 to 2006.

O2 Ireland became a subsidiary of Telefónica in 2006, after its parent company O2 in the United Kingdom was purchased. In June 2013, Hutchison Whampoa announced it would acquire the Irish arm of O2 for €780 million. O2 was merged into Hutchison Whampoa&#x27;s subsidiary Three Ireland in March 2015.

== History ==

=== 1997–2000: Origin ===
In 1995, the government, with Michael Lowry as Minister for Transport, Energy, and Communications, authorised a second mobile phone network, to compete with Eircell owned by the semi-state Telecom Éireann. The licence was awarded to Esat Digifone, a joint venture between Denis O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s company Esat Telecommunications and Norway&#x27;s Telenor, which began operations in 1997. In 2008, the Moriarty Tribunal found that the awarding of the licence was influenced by payments made to Lowry by O&#x27;Brien.

=== 2000–2001: BT ownership. ===

In 1999, Esat Telecom and Telenor began to dispute how Esat Digifone should be operated. Telenor removed the word &quot;Esat&quot; from the companies name, and began the attempted removal of Denis O&#x27;Brien as chairman of Digifone. Esat Telecom retaliated by threatening to take legal action against Telenor, and make repeated offers to buy Telenor&#x27;s share of Digifone.

In November 1999, Telenor placed a bid for the entire share capital of Esat Telecom as a way of resolving the conflict. The bid was rejected by the majority shareholders of Esat Telecommunications who voted against the takeover. In January 2000, British Telecommunications counteracted Esat Telecom failed bid by placing its own bid to buy Telenor&#x27;s shares in Digifone.

In January 2000, British Telecommunications made a takeover offer for Telenor which was backed by Esat Telecommunications shareholders. Esat Telecommunications became a wholly owned subsidiary of British Telecommunications and was delisted from the stock market. When BT acquired Esat, they began integrating the business along with its Northern Ireland subsidiary, BT (NI). This eventually became BT Ireland. However Esat Digifone was not part of the operations integrated with BT&#x27;s existing Irish operations. Instead, it became part of the BT Wireless division within BT, and was briefly rebranded simply &quot;Digifone&quot;. This branding lasted for less than six months.

===2001–2005: Demerger from BT Ireland===
In 2001, the BT Wireless division became mmO2 plc, a separate company, through a demerger from BT. British Telecommunications shareholders received 1 BT Group and 1 mmO2 share for each British Telecommunications share they held. After the de-merger, most of mmO2&#x27;s operations, including Digifone, were rebranded O2. mmO2 plc later became O2 plc and remained an independent company until 2005.

=== 2005–2006: Telefónica transition ===
On 31 October 2005 it was announced that Telefónica, S.A., the Spanish telecommunications company, had made a recommended takeover bid for O2 Ireland&#x27;s parent company, O2 plc. This was then approved by shareholders and O2 was officially purchased in mid February 2006. The O2 brand is now used in several countries for Telefónica&#x27;s mobile operations outside Spain and Latin America, where Telefónica fixed line and mobile services are branded as Movistar. In January 2009, it was revealed that Ireland was nearly the most profitable market in the world for multinational mobile operators like O2.

===2006-2013===
On 23 March 2009 Vodafone and O2&#x27;s parent company Telefónica announced a deal to share their existing networks in Ireland and rollout future infrastructure jointly.

On 6 April 2011 it was announced that Telefónica O2 Ireland and Eircom had agreed a new network sharing partnership.

=== 2013: Hutchison 3 Ireland merger ===
On 24 June 2013, it was announced that Hutchison Whampoa would acquire Telefónica&#x27;s Irish mobile operations for €780 million, to be merged into 3 Ireland upon completion of the deal. The deal was cleared by the EU in June 2014. On 15 July 2014, the acquisition was fully completed.

On 2 March 2015 it was announced on social media that O2 Ireland and Three Ireland were merging.

This change meant that Three Ireland had over 1.5 million customers on their network putting them up near the customer numbers of Vodafone Ireland.

==Services==
O2 was the second largest telecommunications provider in Ireland, with approximately 40% market share or 1.6 million customers. The company&#x27;s STD prefix was 086, but following the introduction of full number portability, some O2 Irish mobile numbers featured prefixes starting 087, 085, 089 or 083, as customers may switch provider but keep their old phone number.

The company provided WAP and GPRS services under the &quot;O2 Active&quot; brand. In October 2005, O2 Ireland launched a version of NTT DoCoMo&#x27;s i-mode service. The company held a UMTS licence, and was the third Irish operator to offer 3G services, after Vodafone Ireland and Three Ireland, offering services in some built-up areas in late 2006.

===O2 Broadband===
In July 2007, O2 launched its mobile broadband offering in Ireland using HSDPA technology over its 3G network. They provided speeds of up to 7.2 Mbit/s and claimed to cover 90% of the population on the least contended Irish 3G network following an upgrade in 2007.

===Speak Easy===
Speak Easy was the name of O2 Ireland&#x27;s prepaid service. In 2007 they became the first Irish operator to offer free text messages to all Irish mobile numbers, although it only applied for weekends. However, in early 2008 they introduced a new tariff which offered unlimited free text messages to all networks at any time, for life.

The term &quot;speak easy&quot; was introduced when the company was branded as Esat Digifone

===O2 Freedom===
The O2 Freedom plans were introduced in June 2013 which offered 2 main new price plans, Freedom talk and Freedom Internet. O2 was the first Irish operator to offer free calls to all networks at any time on prepay. This offer was Freedom Talk and gave customers Unlimited calls to all Irish mobiles and landlines which required a €20 top up of which €10 was deducted for the offer. Freedom Internet offered 1 GB of data and 350 any network texts. Same terms applied as per Freedom talk. In December 2013 the data allowance of 1 GB was increased to 7.5 GB which O2 advertised as Unlimited Internet.
Along with the new price plan O2 also launched a vast amount of prepay addons such as Talk, Text, Data, International Talk and International text.

==Corporate affairs==

===Company structure===
In 2010, O2 underwent a restructuring phase, implementing a number of cost-cutting measures which involved outsourcing internal divisions to external companies.
O2&#x27;s IT division was outsourced to IBM Ireland, while the &quot;Network Operations&quot; division was outsourced to BT Ireland (&quot;who also run the network operations for Three Ireland&quot;). The Network team outsource was limited to the Field Operations team along with some other support functions. The Network rollout team &amp; Transmission team remained in-house to facilitate future network changes. It was more cost effective to retain these divisions in-house.

===Charitable activities===
In 2006 O2 chose Irish Autism Action as their charity of choice. The three-year deal involved sponsorship, creating awareness, using O2 staff to assist the charity and using technology developed by O2 to assist children affected by autism. In 2010, the company&#x27;s charity of choice became Headstrong, a charity providing mental health support to young people.

===Sponsorship programmes===
Over the years, O2 entered into some very high-profile sponsorship arrangements. In 1998 the then ESAT Digifone committed its support to the Hurlers &amp; Footballers of Cork. They remained sponsors of Cork GAA for ten years.

Another high-profile sponsorship agreement was their association with the Irish Rugby Football Union and the Ireland national team, which has been continued by Three. Building on their rugby links with Shannon RFU, O2 joined forces with the top level of rugby in Ireland. They also sponsored the West Stand at Ireland&#x27;s former home ground, Lansdowne Road.

They were also the title sponsor of one of the country&#x27;s most high-profile venue, &quot;The O2&quot;, now renamed the &quot;3Arena&quot;.

They were title sponsor of the Aisling Foundation&#x27;s Ability Awards.

===Chief executive===
Tony Hanway was Chief Executive of Telefónica Ireland from his appointment in September 2011 until March 2015. Hanway first joined Telefónica in Ireland in 2005 as Head of Customer Care, subsequently becoming Consumer Sales Director. Immediately prior to taking the role, Hanway headed up the Consumer division of Telefónica in the Czech Republic, managing a team of over 4000 people across the retail, online and customer care functions.

==Criticism==

In July 2004 the company admitted overcharging 71,000 customers following a review of its systems. The disclosure meant that 136,535 O2 subscribers - more than 10 per cent of its customer base - were overcharged.

Analysis by the Sunday Independent in January 2006 showed the massive margins being earned by Vodafone and O2 in the country were costing Irish mobile phone users about €300m a year. If the mobile phone companies were to cut their Irish margins to the group average, O2 customers would end up paying €84.07 less every year (€7 a month less).

The European Commission upheld a ruling by the Irish regulatory body, ComReg, that the Irish mobile phone market needed greater competition, and acknowledged that &quot;tacit collusion possibly existed between O2 and Vodafone&quot;.

In May 2007, O2 Ireland management announced that the entire O2 Ireland technical staff were to be outsourced to a single Managed Service Provider. The next month O2 customers got a busy signal or no dial tone at all when they tried to make calls due to a network glitch. The reason for the glitch remained a mystery at the time because the company&#x27;s spokesperson couldn&#x27;t be reached by the media on her mobile, also seemingly affected by the problem.

The Consumers&#x27; Association of Ireland lodged a complaint with the Competition Authority over a loophole used by O2 that allowed it to bombard customers with unwanted text messages.

The telecoms lobby group ALTO criticised O2 Ireland for its decision to quadruple the revenue it generated from calls to the 1850 LoCall number. This is a fixed price, shared cost service used by charities and a number of public service bodies.

The company was criticised for its monthly subscription fees levied on Irish users of the iPhone, as they represented poor value for money when compared with the services available to customers paying similar amounts in the UK. Less than 48 hours after the much hyped launch of Apple&#x27;s latest model, owners of all phones on the O2 network discovered they could not access the internet at all due to a network failure. Further criticism came from iPhone customers regarding the continued failure of O2 to deploy Visual Voicemail. O2 was the only carrier in the world to launch the original iPhone without Visual Voicemail, one of its headline features.

O2 was responsible for the highest number of registered judgments, which financially blacklists those people who do not pay their bills on time in August 2008.

The Advertising Standards Authority upheld complaints concerning advertisements by O2.

In August 2010, O2 was warned by the telecoms watchdog, ComReg, that it could not move customers to online billing without their explicit agreement.

In March 2011, O2 pleaded guilty to a breach of the Data Protection Act at the Dublin District Court.

In March 2011, it was revealed that Denis O&#x27;Brien made payments to the Minister for Communications, Michael Lowry, to aid Esat Digifone&#x27;s licence bid.

<text>Howard Robert Swearer (March 13, 1932 – October 19, 1991) was an American educator. He served as the sixth president of Carleton College, serving from 1970 to 1977, and the 15th president of Brown University between 1977 and 1988. His death from cancer shocked and saddened the Brown community, as few had known of his illness.

==Early life and education==
Swearer was born on March 13, 1932, in Hutchinson, Kansas. His undergraduate work was at Princeton University, graduating in 1954. He earned a master&#x27;s and a Ph.D. in political science from Harvard University, in 1956 and 1960, respectively. After receiving his doctorate, he became a political science professor at UCLA, teaching there from 1960 to 1967. He left UCLA to work for Ford Foundation from 1967 to 1970, working in their International Division.

==Carleton College==
Swearer served as Carleton&#x27;s president from 1970 to 1977. Carleton&#x27;s new Music and Drama Center, which had been in the planning stages since 1960, was finally dedicated during his administration, as was the new Seely G. Mudd Hall of Science. He also oversaw a successful capital campaign during this period.

It was during the Swearer administration that Carleton&#x27;s Winter Break was extended from four to six weeks by moving the start date of fall term two weeks earlier. Due to the high fuel prices in 1974 with the OPEC embargo, Swearer and the college&#x27;s treasurer suggested the change might save fuel (not only would the college be largely unoccupied for a longer period during the colder months of November and December, but students who wished to visit home for Thanksgiving would not need to return to campus immediately afterward and then head home again a week or two later). Though students were at the time opposed to the change, their objections were overruled and it was put into effect for the 1974-1975 school year. A poll taken in 1975 found a high level of support for the change, and Carleton has had a six-week winter break ever since.

==Brown University==
President Swearer left Carleton in 1977 to become president of Brown University, where he served until December 1988. During his tenure there, he led another successful capital campaign that increased several research grants and allowed for several deferred building projects to go forward. In 1985, Swearer helped found Campus Compact, a national non-profit dedicated to the civic purpose of higher education and the development of future democratic leaders. Swearer believed universities should be communities of compassionate people involved in serious intellectual pursuits, but never divorced from the realities of their communities. In 1987, he formed what is now known as the Howard R. Swearer Center for Public Service at Brown.

==Retirement==
Following his term as Brown&#x27;s president, he was appointed as the director of Brown&#x27;s Institute for International Studies. He later moved to Thompson, Connecticut, where he died of cancer on October 19, 1991. Swearer&#x27;s wife Janet died in 2020.

==Trivia==
* President Swearer&#x27;s son, Nick, built Iggy, a long iron sculpture of an iguana that stands in front of the Science Museum of Minnesota, when he was a high school student in Northfield. At one point during construction, Iggy was stolen from the Swearers&#x27; driveway and placed on a bridge on campus.

<text>The Forest of Bere is a mixed-use partially forested area in Hampshire immediately north of Fareham, Portsmouth and Roman Road, Havant and including a small part of the South Downs National Park.

The former uninterrupted forest is now a mix of woodland, open space, ponds, streams, heathland, farmland and downland interspersed by minor villages and the major settlements of Waterlooville (with Cowplain) and Eastleigh (with Chandlers Ford). There are a number of paths and bridleways for walking and cycling. In the southern portion, towards the area south of the Queen Elizabeth Country Park, conifer plantations were created in the twentieth century.

==History==
In the 13th and 14th centuries, two royal forests formed a greater forerunner of the later vestigial forest between the New Forest and the Sussex border. North of Southampton between the rivers Test and Itchen was the Royal Forest of Bere Ashley. North of Portsmouth between the River Meon and the suburb of Bedhampton was the Royal Forest of Bere Portchester.

<doc id="830860" wikidata="Q15524684" url="?curid=830860" title="Frank Swinnerton">
<text>Frank Arthur Swinnerton (12 August 1884 – 6 November 1982) was an English novelist, critic, biographer and essayist.

He was the author of more than 50 books, and as a publisher&#x27;s editor helped other writers including Aldous Huxley and Lytton Strachey. His long life and career in publishing made him one of the last links with the generation of writers that included H. G. Wells, John Galsworthy and Arnold Bennett.

==Biography==
Swinnerton was born in Wood Green, a suburb of London, the son of Charles Swinnerton, a copperplate engraver, and Rose, née Cottam.

===Career===
Swinnerton left school at the age of 14 and was employed as an office boy for a newspaper publisher, Hay, Nisbet &amp; Co and then as a clerk-receptionist by J. M. Dent, publishers of Everyman&#x27;s Library. He moved on to the publishing house of Chatto &amp; Windus, first as a proof-reader and then as an editor. Although he began writing novels in 1909, he continued editing until he became a full-time author in 1926. Even then, he also worked as literary critic for the magazine &quot;Truth&quot;, the &quot;London Evening News&quot; (1929–32) and &quot;The Observer&quot; (1937–43).

As a novelist, Swinnerton achieved critical and commercial success with &quot;Nocturne&quot; in 1917, and remained a successful writer for the rest of his life. His last novel, &quot;Some Achieve Greatness&quot; (1976), was published when he was in his early nineties. Some critics detected echoes of George Gissing and Arnold Bennett in Swinnerton&#x27;s work, but he himself thought his chief influences were Henry James, Henrik Ibsen and Louisa May Alcott.

His prose style was &quot;natural and lucid&quot;, and he was disapproving of over-intellectual or pretentious writing. In &quot;The Georgian Literary Scene&quot;, an evocation of the era of the gentlemanly man of letters in its final years, he wrote, &quot;If I dwell for a moment longer, as I fear I must, upon the weakness of too much scholarship in the arts, it is because I think scholarship is nowadays excessively valued as a necessary preliminary to creative writing.&quot; Of all of his critical contributions, &quot;The Georgian Literary Scene&quot; stands out, and it is still used by those who study the period. &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared it &quot;wholly – and most refreshingly – unlike other literary histories.&quot; Swinnerton himself said of his work: &quot;My best books, in my own opinion, are &quot;Harvest Comedy&quot; and &quot;The Georgian Literary Scene&quot;, but I do not regard either one as of lasting importance... I live in the country, am very lazy, work unwillingly very hard, and have few intolerances.&quot;

===Personal life===
Swinnerton lived for more than fifty years in Old Tokefield, Cranleigh, Surrey, a rural spot not far from London. He was twice married; his first marriage, in 1917, to the poet Helen Dircks, ended in divorce. In 1924 he married Mary Dorothy Bennett, with whom he had one daughter. Swinnerton died at Old Tokefield at the age of 98. His obituary notice in &quot;The Times&quot; began by noting that his death &quot;breaks one of the last links with his great contemporaries, Wells, Galsworthy and Arnold Bennett.&quot;

<text>Gerard Swope (December 1, 1872 – November 20, 1957) was an American electronics businessman. He served as the president of General Electric Company between 1922 and 1940, and again from 1942 until 1945. During this time Swope expanded GE&#x27;s product offerings, reorienting GE toward consumer home appliances, and offering consumer credit services.

==Biography==
Swope was born in St. Louis, Missouri, to Ida and Isaac Swope, Jewish immigrants from Germany. He graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1895. He married Mary Dayton Hill. He was the brother of Herbert Bayard Swope, and father of Henrietta Swope and John Swope, the Hollywood and Life Magazine photographer who married actress Dorothy McGuire.

He is possibly best known for his labor relations innovations. At General Electric, Swope implemented numerous labor reforms, making conditions better for employees with voluntary unemployment insurance, profit-sharing, and other programs that were considered radical in their day. Swope increased sales and overall efficiency (economics), earning high profits and market share and focused on employee training, retention, and loyalty. Before the passage of the Wagner Act, Swope &quot;had long supported labor legislation.&quot;

He served as Chairman of The Business Council, then known as the Business Advisory Council, for the United States Department of Commerce in 1933. Swope&#x27;s other Roosevelt administration roles included member, Industrial Advisory Board of the National Recovery Administration (NRA) (1933); member, Bureau of Advertising and Planning of the Department of Commerce (1933); chairman, Coal Advisory Board (1933); member, National Labor Board (1933); member, President&#x27;s Advisory Council on Economic Security (1934); and member, Advisory Council on Social Security (1937–1938). Swope was Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in 1942, when he was chairman of the committee to Study Budgets of Relief Appeals for Foreign Countries. For his work, he won the Hoover Medal.

==Later life==
In 1949, Swope made his first visit to Israel at the suggestion of friends who were active in the Palestine Economic Corporation. On the trip, Swope expressed that he would consider moving to a &quot;kibbutz&quot; &quot;if he didn&#x27;t love New York so much.&quot; He was a long-time sponsor of the American Technion Society, which supported Technion University in Haifa.

He died in New York City on November 20, 1957. In 2005, Forbes Magazine ranked Swope as the 20th most influential businessman of all time.

==Swope Plan==
In September 1931, Swope presented a proposal for recovery. Under the Swope plan, the Federal Trade Commission would supervise trade associations established for each industry. Trade associations would cover every company with at least 50 employees after three years. Associations would regulate output and set prices. Workers would receive life insurance, pensions, and unemployment insurance paid for in part by employers. The Chamber of Commerce and other conservative groups provided enthusiastic support.

President Herbert Hoover, who strongly supported voluntary trade associations, denounced the plan for being compulsory, inefficient, and monopolistic.

In an oral history interview, Leon H. Keyserling said the New Deal&#x27;s National Industrial Recovery Act &quot;started as a trade association act. The original draft of the act grew out of the so-called Gerard Swope plan for Recovery.&quot; When asked in November 1933 about an updated Swope Plan, President Roosevelt said, &quot;Mr. Swope&#x27;s plan is a very interesting theoretical suggestion in regard to some ultimate development of N.R.A.&quot;

<text>Empire is the fourth full-length studio album by the American heavy metal band Queensrÿche, released on August 20, 1990. The album is Queensrÿche&#x27;s most commercially successful release, reaching triple-platinum status. The primary single, the power ballad &quot;Silent Lucidity&quot;, reached number 1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks and number 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Silent Lucidity&quot; was also nominated in 1992 for the Grammy Awards for Best Rock Song and Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group. The album won a 1991 Northwest Area Music Award for Best Metal Recording.

==Reception==
&quot;Empire&quot; has received generally positive reviews from critics since its release.

AllMusic praised the album, selecting the songs &quot;Jet City Woman&quot;, &quot;Empire&quot;, and &quot;Silent Lucidity&quot; as the album&#x27;s best tracks. The review stated that the band went for &quot;a song-oriented approach that is more art rock and less metal&quot; with lyrics that talk about social and physical handicaps in &quot;Best I Can&quot; and issues such as poverty and regret in &quot;Della Brown&quot; and romance with &quot;Another Rainy Night (Without You)&quot; and &quot;Hand On Heart&quot;. The reviewer concluded by praising the band&#x27;s mature sound and the work of producer Peter Collins.

&quot;Record Collector&quot; gave the 20th anniversary edition of the album a generally positive review. The reviewer called the album a &quot;very pleasant, but only intermittently gripping&quot; listen, identifying the songs &quot;Best I Can&quot;, &quot;Silent Lucidity&quot;, and &quot;Jet City Woman&quot; as some of the band&#x27;s best material. Comparing &quot;Empire&quot; to the band&#x27;s earlier albums, &quot;The Warning&quot; and &quot;Rage for Order&quot;, the reviewer wrote that it is &quot;a little boring&quot;. The reviewer concluded by calling the live CD accompanying the re-issue &quot;flawless&quot;, making it a &quot;worthwhile reissue&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot; reviewer Adrien Begrand also reviewed the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary release. Begrand called the album an &quot;enigma&quot; that&#x27;s &quot;beautifully produced and features some of the band&#x27;s quintessential songs, but at the same time it&#x27;s a rather bloated, conceptually scattershot piece of work containing filler that honestly has not aged very well&quot;. Begrand praised the songs &quot;Empire&quot;, &quot;Another Rainy Night&quot;, and &quot;Silent Lucidity&quot;, calling them the album&#x27;s best tracks, favorably comparing &quot;Silent Lucidity&quot; to Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;, which also includes orchestra arrangements from Michael Kamen. Begrand had a mixed reaction to the live CD and referred to the cover of &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot; as being &quot;abysmal&quot;.

Jim Farber of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; was highly critical of the album. He criticized both the album&#x27;s progressive metal riffs, calling them &quot;tuneless bombast&quot;, and the dire nature of the lyrics. Farber concluded his review by calling the band members &quot;relentless killjoys&quot;.

<text>Henrietta Hill Swope (October 26, 1902 – November 24, 1980) was an American
astronomer who studied variable stars. In particular, she measured the period-luminosity relation for Cepheid stars, which are bright variable stars whose periods of variability relate directly to their intrinsic luminosities. Their measured periods can therefore be related to their distances and used to measure the size of the Milky Way and distances to other galaxies.

==Personal life==

She was the daughter of Mary Hill and Gerard Swope, and niece of Herbert Bayard Swope. Both of her parents taught at Hull-House in Chicago in the late 1890s, where they met. Her father had attended MIT and was an engineer. He worked for General Electric, eventually rising to be president of the company in 1922 and enabling his daughter to be independently wealthy throughout her life.

She learned of talks at Maria Mitchell Observatory while vacationing with her family on Nantucket, and took an evening class there alongside her brother. She also heard Harvard astronomer Harlow Shapley speak; eventually she would go to work with him on variable stars.

==Education==

Swope attended Barnard College, and graduated in 1925, with an AB degree in mathematics. She only took an astronomy class, from Harold Jacoby, in her final year.

After college, she went back to Chicago and attended the School of Social Service Administration, at the University of Chicago, but only for one year.

While working with Harlow Shapley, she obtained her Masters in Astronomy in 1928 from Radcliffe College. 

==Professional history==

She learned that Dr. Shapley at Harvard was offering fellowships for women to work on finding variable stars. Swope went to work for Shapley in 1926 and began working alongside other &quot;girls&quot; to identify variable stars in the Milky Way. She became friends with Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin and Adelaide Ames. She supported herself on a salary from Harvard and a stipend from her family. She became an expert on estimating magnitudes of stars from images on photographic plates.

Swope left Harvard to work for MIT&#x27;s staff radiation laboratory in 1942. In her Oral History, she says, &quot;...they said, &#x27;How much were you getting [at Harvard]?&#x27; And I said, I think, $2000. That’s what they say they would pay me, what I was getting, but that was too little for them. They couldn&#x27;t. So I rose fairly quickly.&quot; From 1942-1947, she worked on the LORAN navigation tables.

From 1947 until 1952, Swope taught astronomy at Barnard College and Connecticut College for Women and did research using old plates from Harvard.

In 1952, Walter Baade of the Carnegie Institution of Washington&#x27;s Observatories asked her, via Martin Schwarzschild as an intermediary, to come work with him on variable stars detected in other galaxies by the new 200-inch Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory. Although she was hired as Baade&#x27;s research assistant, in the &quot;nebular-studies&quot; group, she worked independently even to the point of writing scientific publications with his name on them after his death. She stayed at the Carnegie Institution for the rest of her career; she officially retired in 1968.

In 1964, a paper by Baade &amp; Swope reported the results of light curves for 275 Cepheids derived by Swope from photographic plates of the Andromeda Galaxy taken at the relatively new Hale 200-inch Telescope at Palomar Mountain. They reported a new distance to M31, given as a distance modulus of 24.25. They followed up
this work in 1963 with new results of 20 Cepheids in a region of Andromeda less affected by extinction and estimated a new distance modulus of 24.20 mag.

==Legacy==

In 1967, Swope made a donation of securities valued at $650,000 to the Carnegie Institution of Washington to develop &quot;optical astronomical observatory facilities in the Southern Hemisphere.&quot; This gift was used for development of the site, including roads, water, and power systems, and for building a 40-inch telescope at Carnegie&#x27;s Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. This telescope was named the Swope Telescope in her honor; it started operation in 1971 and is still used today. Swope also left most of her estate to Carnegie to support further Las Campanas and astronomical research at the institution more generally.

Henrietta Hill Swope died at the age of 78 in Pasadena in California.

==Awards and honors==
* Annie J. Cannon Award in 1968
* Asteroid 2168 Swope is named in her honor.
* Barnard Distinguished Alumnae Award, 1975 
* The Swope Telescope at the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile is named in her honor.
* Honorary PhD, 1975, University of Basel, Switzerland

<text>Herbert Bayard Swope Sr. (; January 5, 1882 – June 20, 1958) was an American editor, journalist and intimate of the Algonquin Round Table. Swope spent most of his career at the &quot;New York World.&quot; He was the first and three-time recipient of the Pulitzer Prize for Reporting. Swope was called the greatest reporter of his time by Lord Northcliffe of the London &quot;Daily Mail&quot;.

==Background==
Herbert Bayard Swope was born on January 5, 1882, in St. Louis, Missouri, to German immigrants Ida Cohn and Isaac Swope, a watchcase maker. He was the youngest of four children – the younger brother of businessman and General Electric president Gerard Swope.

==Career==

Swope was the first recipient of the Pulitzer Prize for Reporting in 1917 for a series of articles that year entitled &quot;Inside the German Empire&quot; The articles formed the basis for a book released in 1917 entitled &quot;Inside the German Empire: In the Third Year of the War&quot; (), which he co-authored with James W. Gerard.

He is known for saying, &quot;I can&#x27;t give you a sure-fire formula for success, but I can give you a formula for failure: try to please everybody all the time.&quot; He is also credited with coining the phrase &quot;Cold War&quot;.

Although standard editorial pages have been printed by newspapers for many centuries, Swope established the first modern op-ed page in 1921. When he took over as editor in 1920, he realized that the page opposite the editorials was &quot;a catchall for book reviews, society boilerplate, and obituaries.&quot; He wrote:It occurred to me that nothing is more interesting than opinion when opinion is interesting, so I devised a method of cleaning off the page opposite the editorial, which became the most important in America... and thereon I decided to print opinions, ignoring facts.

He hired the widowed Consuela Sheridan (nee Frewen), the maternal cousin of Winston Churchill, as a roving reporter in Europe, and she landed many scoops including interviews with the negotiating parties for Irish Independence.

Swope served as the editor for &quot;New York World&quot;&#x27;s 21-day crusade against the Ku Klux Klan in October 1921, which won the newspaper the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service in 1922. As an example of investigative journalism, it was ranked 81st of the top 100 journalism stories of the 20th century by New York University&#x27;s journalism department.

He was a legendary poker player, at one point winning over $470,000 in a game with an oil baron, a steel magnate, and an entertainer. He was also a member of a social club, the precursor to the Algonquin Round Table known as the Thanatopsis Inside Straight and Pleasure Club. He was inducted into the 
Croquet Hall of Fame of the United States Croquet Association in 1979 and his son Herbert Bayard Swope, Jr. in 1981.

==Mansion==
Swope died in 1958, aged 76, at his home, known as Land&#x27;s End, Prospect Point, Sands Point, New York. He hosted parties with the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Vivien Leigh and Laurence Olivier, Dorothy Parker, Harpo Marx, Winston Churchill, Averell Harriman, Albert Einstein, Alexander Woollcott – as well as F. Scott Fitzgerald. These associations, along with other similarities to the houses and events in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, helped give rise to unsubstantiated reports that Fitzgerald had modeled Daisy Buchanan&#x27;s home in the 1925 novel after Swope&#x27;s home.

However, Swope did not buy Land&#x27;s End until late 1928. The more likely explanation that ties Swope to Fitzgerald is the time period of 1922–24, when Fitzgerald was living in nearby Great Neck. Prior to buying the Sands Point mansion, Swope had been renting a home since 1919 on East Shore Road in Great Neck, overlooking Manhasset Bay. The property was directly north of 325 East Shore Road, the residence of sportswriter Ring Lardner. The two were good friends. David O. Selznick and Jock Whitney met at the home many times throughout the 20s and 30s and held meetings at the mansion that secured funding for &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.

Other reports suggest the home, built in 1902, had been designed by Stanford White – although most sources dispute the claim.

The clapboard colonial mansion included 15 bedrooms and 14 baths (eleven full baths), a seven-car garage, a tennis court with a tennis pavilion, a rose garden and a guest house – on 13.35 acres. The waterfront mansion had originally been built for clothing merchant John S. Browning Sr. in 1911 and originally named Kidd&#x27;s Rocks. It was purchased in 1921 by Malcolm D. Sloane, whose wife renamed the estate &quot;Keewaydin&quot;. The house had been a site for a &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; photo shoot with Madonna and had been a location for the 1978 shooting of &quot;The Greek Tycoon&quot;, a film on the life of Aristotle Onassis.

Keith Richards&#x27; family lived there for a time in the early 1980s. Charles Shipman Payson and his wife, Virginia Kraft, purchased the house in the 1980s. In 2005 she sold the house to developer Bert Brodsky of Port Washington for $17.5 million. &quot;They misrepresented themselves&quot;, Payson told &quot;The Observer&quot;, &quot;I would not show it to any developer. He said that his life&#x27;s ambition was to live in that manor, but it was very clear at the closing that they had no intention of living in it. They are the most awful people I have ever heard of, and that includes terrorists and dictators. They have taken a work of art and permitted it to be totally decimated. It was in pristine condition when I left ... He let it fall apart. He stripped everything out that he could sell, which is sacrilegious. I went by the house perhaps two years after we sold it, and that&#x27;s when I realized how he was going to get around the town&#x27;s objections. Broken windows, storming in—it&#x27;s sinful&quot;. In 2011, the home was demolished and the property was subdivided.

<text>Vain Glory Opera is the third (or second &quot;official&quot;) studio album by the German power metal band Edguy, released in 1998. It was mixed by Stratovarius&#x27; Timo Tolkki, who also played additional lead guitar on &quot;Out Of Control&quot;, and featured additional lead and backing vocals by Hansi Kürsch of Blind Guardian on &quot;Out of Control&quot; and the title track &quot;Vain Glory Opera.&quot; Further choir vocals were supplied by Ralf Zdiarstek and Norman Meiritz. At the time of recording the album, Edguy had not yet chosen a permanent drummer to succeed Dominik Storch. So session musician Frank Lindenthal, a good friend of the band, was asked to play drums on the album.

&quot;Hymn&quot; is a cover version of the song from the album &quot;Quartet&quot; (1982) by the British new wave band Ultravox.

<text>Christopher Thornton Taylor (born 15 July 1974) is an Australian comedy writer, performer and broadcaster from Sydney. As a founding member of The Chaser, he is best known for co-writing and appearing on satirical ABC Television shows &quot;CNNNN&quot; (2002–2003) and &quot;The Chaser&#x27;s War on Everything&quot; (2006 – July 2009). He formerly co-hosted the drive radio show &quot;Today Today&quot; (2004–05) on Triple J with fellow Chaser member Craig Reucassel, and in 2007, he wrote the musical comedy &quot;Dead Caesar&quot;. Taylor also hosted the mini documentary series &#x27;Australia&#x27;s Heritage: National Treasures&#x27;. In 2010, with his Chaser colleague Andrew Hansen, Taylor made a musical comedy series for Triple J titled &quot;The Blow Parade&quot;, which became the number one podcast in the country, and won the 2010 ARIA Award for Best Comedy Release. In 2019, Taylor was the creator and co-writer of the drama Upright starring Tim Minchin. The series screened to critical acclaim in both Australia and the UK.

==Early years==
Taylor grew up on Sydney&#x27;s Northern Beaches and North Shore and attended Shore School, North Sydney.

After completing secondary school, Taylor undertook an arts degree at the University of Sydney, and also studied play-writing at NIDA. But at 21 he abandoned play-writing and went back to university to study journalism at University of Technology, Sydney. In 1997, he moved to Melbourne after the ABC offered him a journalism cadetship there.

For five years, Taylor worked as an ABC journalist, including two years as a court reporter. He covered cases including the murder of toddler Jaidyn Leskie, the fatal Longford gas fire and the defamation action by the then Victorian premier Jeff Kennett against &quot;The Australian&quot;.
Taylor then moved back to Sydney in 2001 to work full-time for The Chaser&#x27;s newspaper, and ultimately became a Chaser member.

Chris is also a cricketer and plays in an amateur team &quot;The Mighty Ducks&quot; with Julian Morrow and Charles Firth.

==&quot;CNNNN&quot;==
In 2001, Andrew Denton got hold of one of The Chaser&#x27;s newspapers and gave them the opportunity to produce a television show, hence The Chaser team produced their first ABC Television program &quot;The Election Chaser&quot;, which covered the 2001 Australian federal election. They then went on to create other television shows for ABC TV, including two series of the Logie Award-winning &quot;CNNNN&quot; in 2002–03 (in which Taylor portrayed a chief commentator), and &quot;The Chaser Decides&quot; in 2004, which covered the 2004 Australian federal election.

==&quot;Triple J&quot;==
In addition to his roles on television, Taylor has teamed up with Chaser colleague Andrew Hansen to write and star in a musical comedy series, &quot;The Blow Parade&quot;, on Australian radio station Triple J from 14 April 2010 until 26 May 2010. The program will also be available to download free of charge for a limited time.

Taylor also united with fellow Chaser Craig Reucassel to present the Triple J drive slot, &quot;Today Today&quot; in 2004–2005.

As part of his role on &quot;Today Today&quot;, Taylor wrote and voiced a weekly Coma FM sketch, satirising the formats and style of commercial radio. He also co-hosted the radio program &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot; with Reucassel in 2006 and 2007. During the shows Chris would regularly ask listeners to &quot;go for broke&quot; and vandalise Wikipedia pages. Tara Reid, Peter Overton and Wikipedia&#x27;s own Wikipedia page were chosen targets. And in 2008 Taylor and Reucassel returned to present &quot;The Race Race&quot;, covering the US presidential election. The show quickly became the number one podcast in the country.

Taylor also has the distinction of being Roy Slaven&#x27;s official understudy at Triple J, broadcasting alongside HG Nelson on &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; and a Twenty20 cricket game on the couple of instances when Roy Slaven was absent.

In a notable instance while working at Triple J, Taylor agreed to streak across the grounds of the Sydney Big Day Out if the theme song from &quot;Media Watch&quot; polled in the &#x27;Triple J Hottest 100&#x27; Countdown. It was announced that in terms of votes counted, the Media Watch theme had in fact come in at number 7, and Taylor proceeded to do his nude run in front of a large group of spectators.

==&quot;The Chaser&#x27;s War on Everything&quot;==
Taylor, who&#x27;s often referred to as &quot;Tayls&quot; by his colleagues, is one of the main presenters on &quot;The Chaser&#x27;s War on Everything&quot;. He is also the program&#x27;s script editor and principal writer behind many of the show&#x27;s segments, sketches and songs, some of which were controversial.

===Appearance on &quot;Sunrise&quot;===
In &quot;The Chaser&#x27;s War on Everything&quot; skit &quot;Will You Divorce Me?&quot;, Taylor made a guest appearance on &quot;Sunrise&quot;, a live morning talk show on Channel 7. He said he had an announcement for his wife and ended up yelling &quot;Get the fuck out of my life&quot; at the camera. The appearance of authenticity of this clip made it appear as though the segment went live to air on &quot;Sunrise&quot;, but it only ever appeared on &quot;The Chaser&#x27;s War on Everything&quot;. When the segment became a viral video, Taylor and the hosts admitted it was staged on the &quot;Sunrise&quot; set after one of their shows though the latter said the dialogue was improvised and unaware of the profane punchline.

===Tim Freedman parody===
Taylor sparked controversy with Tim Freedman, singer and songwriter of indie rock band The Whitlams. On 7 October 2007, Freedman posted a message on the band&#x27;s official website, citing a parody of him which was written by Taylor and had aired on the 3 October 2007 episode of &quot;The War&quot;. The song was performed by a fellow Chaser, Andrew Hansen, and the lyrics implied that Freedman was obsessed with the Sydney suburb of Newtown and that he continually referred to the area of Newtown in his own songs. In his message, Freedman said that the lyrics were indeed written by Taylor and that the parody had been motivated by jealousy over a woman they had both dated, Anna Skellern, who was a non-contributing cast member in the first season of &quot;CNNNN&quot;. Taylor denied this and said that the song had nothing to do with Skellern. Andrew Hansen in the commentary track for the Season 2 DVD revealed that Taylor and Freedman had sorted the issue out and that everything between them was all good. In the final episode of Season 3, Freedman even made a friendly cameo appearance on the show in a mock oral sex scene with Taylor.

===The Eulogy Song===
On 17 October 2007 episode of &quot;The War&quot;, Andrew Hansen performed &quot;The Eulogy Song&quot;, a song written by Taylor which satirised the lives of several deceased celebrities, including Peter Brock, Princess Diana, Donald Bradman, Steve Irwin, Stan Zemanek, John Lennon, Jeff Buckley, and Kerry Packer, expressing the view that people with flaws during life are often disproportionately hailed as &quot;top blokes&quot; after death. The song became the target of significant media attention, with several radio and television personalities saying the song was in &quot;bad taste&quot;. Then Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard, and then Opposition Leader, Kevin Rudd, expressed negative views.

In response to the attention, Taylor defended the song, stating that it was a legitimate skit about the way the media airbrushes celebrities in death. He also revealed it was a &quot;watered down&quot; version of the song which was previously performed on stage in the musical &quot;Dead Caesar&quot;. The original had a verse about Rene Rivkin, but it was replaced with one about Stan Zemanek.

Andrew Hansen performed an updated version of &quot;The Eulogy Song&quot; in his 2020 national tour.

==&quot;Dead Caesar&quot;==

As well as writing for &quot;The Chaser&#x27;s War on Everything&quot;, Taylor wrote the play called &quot;Dead Caesar&quot; which premiered at the Sydney Theatre Company on 1 February 2007, and then had a one-month run in July 2007. The play was a musical comedy based on the life of Julius Caesar, featuring original music composed by Andrew Hansen, who also appeared in the play as Mark Antony and Lucius. The now infamous &quot;Eulogy Song&quot; was originally written for this production.

<text>Long Ashton Research Station (LARS) was an agricultural and horticultural government-funded research centre located in the village of Long Ashton near Bristol, UK. It was created in 1903 to study and improve the West Country cider industry and became part of the University of Bristol in 1912. Later, it expanded into fruit research (particularly apples, pears, plums, strawberries and blackcurrants) and in the 1980s was redirected to work on arable crops and aspects of botany. It closed in 2003.

The Research Station is commonly known for developing Ribena, a still-popular vitamin C-rich drink that was widely distributed in the UK during the Second World War, and for the development of the Long Ashton Nutrient Solution (LANS).

==History==

Research on cider making began privately in 1893 at Robert Neville-Grenville&#x27;s farm near Glastonbury. Prompted by a letter from Frederick James Lloyd (1852–1923), the Board of Agriculture sponsored a conference held at Bristol on 15 October 1902 in order to create an institute for research in fruit growing, fruit utilisation, and making cider and perry. The conference was presided over by Sir Thomas Elliott, 1st Baronet and was attended by representatives from more than ten counties. This led to the formation of the National Fruit and Cider Institute in 1903 in fields south of the main road through Long Ashton. Frederick J. Lloyd was appointed Director. His successor was B. T. P. Barker, who was the director from 1905 to 1943.

In 1912 the Institute became the University of Bristol&#x27;s Department of Agricultural and Horticultural Research and its name was changed to Long Ashton Research Station. Indeed, the Universities of Bath and Bristol ran Master of Science (MSc) courses at the research station for many years. The first purpose-built laboratory, the Barker Laboratory, was ready for use in 1914.

Fenswood Farm on the north side of the road was bought by the university in 1920 to extend the space available for experiments, and in 1921 the Campden Research Station was taken under Long Ashton&#x27;s management.
The British Government formed the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) in 1931 and this body was given a direct role in managing LARS. During World War II a home grown source of Vitamin C was needed and the blackcurrant drink Ribena was developed at Long Ashton. A new Biology Laboratory was completed in 1948 and in 1952, although links with Campden Research Station ended, the ARC Unit of Plant Nutrition was set up at Long Ashton.

The Station&#x27;s 50th year was celebrated by the publication of a book, &quot;Science and Fruit&quot;, edited by Thomas Wallace and Ralph Warren Marsh. At LARS, Wallace was the deputy director from 1923 to 1943 and the director from 1943 to 1957. Marsh was a research mycologist at LARS from 1926 to 1965. The 1950s were a time of rapid expansion for Long Ashton with the opening of the Kearns and Hewitt Laboratories (1956) and the Wallace Laboratory, Refectory and Conference Room (1959). The first Long Ashton International Symposium was held in 1967.

1981 saw the disbandment of two of Long Ashton&#x27;s major research divisions, the &quot;Pomology and Plant Breeding Division&quot; and the &quot;Food and Beverage Division&quot;. This action by the ARC was a severe blow to the Research Station and began a long period of structural change. The Hirst Laboratory was built in 1983 as part of the reorganisation process, and work on arable crops substantially replaced Long Ashton&#x27;s long history of work on fruit and cider.

The Agricultural and Food Research Council (AFRC, previously ARC) closed other research sites including the Letcombe Laboratory (1985) and the Weed Research Organisation (1986) and their staff and programmes were moved to Long Ashton. With Rothamsted it became part of the Institute of Arable Crops Research (IACR) in 1986. Although the new Treharne Library and Fryer Laboratory were built in 1987, as a junior partner in IACR, Long Ashton was now vulnerable in the event of further restructuring.

The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC, formed from the previous AFRC in 1994) announced in 1999 that Long Ashton was to be closed. The seventeenth and final Long Ashton International Symposium took place in 2002 and the Research Station was duly closed in 2003 having served agriculture and horticulture for exactly 100 years. Some of the remaining staff were moved to Rothamsted during Long Ashton&#x27;s final years, providing some continuity with the programmes of work under way prior to closure. The site was sold and subsequently redeveloped for housing, employment space, community uses and playing fields.

==Nutrient solution==
The Long Ashton Nutrient Solution (LANS) was derived from nutrient solutions used at Long Ashton to grow fruit trees. It was first published in 1952 by Eric John Hewitt. The standardized LANS concentrations in ppm for almost all essential elements and sodium in a full solution of the nitrate-type are shown below:
*N 168 ppm
*K 156 ppm
*Ca 160 ppm
*P 41 ppm
*S 48 ppm
*Na 31 ppm
*Mg 36 ppm
*B 0.54 ppm
*Mn 0.55 ppm
*Zn 0.065 ppm
*Cu 0.064 ppm
*Mo 0.048 ppm
*Fe 5.6 ppm or 2.8 ppm
In particular, the composition and concentration of the micronutrients (B, Mn, Zn, Cu, and Mo) is still commonly used in plant science today (cf. Table (1)).

===Micronutrients===
Table (1) to prepare the stock solutions of micronutrients and a full micronutrient solution of LANS
Micronutrient salts such as MnSO4•4H2O (cf. Table (1)) can be substituted with an equivalent amount of MnCl2•4H2O because chloride is one of the elements essential for plant growth. For optimal plant growth, the LANS micronutrients can be combined with the macronutrients of the Hoagland solution. According to Hewitt iron is plant-available as ferric citrate or it may be supplied as ferric EDTA complex according to Jacobsen.

The Long Ashton or Hewitt solution is widely used and is considered to be suitable for supporting normal growth of a range of different plant species. Hewitt&#x27;s and Hoagland&#x27;s solution formulations led to increased growth of nursery fig trees in high-tunnel and open-field conditions, respectively.

Numerous current research papers on plant nutrition use these standard feeding recipes to grow plants, and frequently without explicit description of the recipes.

<text>Craig Bruce Reucassel is an Australian 
radio and television presenter and comedian. He is currently the presenter of Breakfast on ABC Radio Sydney.

He was an original member of the satirical team, The Chaser.

==Early life==
Reucassel was born in South Africa and moved to Adelaide at a young age with his parents. There, he attended Semaphore Park Primary School. The family relocated to the Southern Highlands of New South Wales, and Reucassel attended Bowral Public School and Bowral High School.

Reucassel attended the University of Sydney, and completed a Bachelor of Economics (Social Science) degree in 1999 and graduated with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 2002. Reucassel ran the arts revue and the canoe club, and was an editor of the student newspaper &quot;Honi Soit&quot;. He also debated at several World Universities Debating Championships, ranking 30th in the World at Manila in 1999 and 167th in Glasgow in 2001. In 2000, he competed in the Philip C. Jessup Cup international law mooting competition, his team winning the Australian rounds. He graduated from the Sydney Law School, along with Chaser colleagues Julian Morrow, Dominic Knight and Chas Licciardello.

==Triple J==
In 2004 and 2005, Reucassel embarked on a radio journey, co-hosting the drive-time show &quot;Today Today&quot; on Triple J alongside his fellow Chaser, Chris Taylor.

Following their successful stint on drive-time radio, Reucassel and Taylor reunited for their Sunday afternoon show, &quot;Bloody Sunday,&quot; which saw them return for relief shifts in mid-2006 and during the summer of 2006–07. This return to the airwaves demonstrated their enduring appeal and ability to captivate audiences across different time slots and formats.

==&quot;The Chaser&#x27;s War on Everything&quot;==

Reucassel played a pivotal role as a founding member of the acclaimed satirical group, The Chaser team. His contributions extended across various media platforms, including their satirical newspaper and several television programs aired on ABC TV. Notable among these were &quot;The Election Chaser,&quot; &quot;CNNNN,&quot; &quot;The Chaser Decides,&quot; and &quot;The Chaser&#x27;s War on Everything.&quot;

Reucassel&#x27;s involvement with &quot;The War&quot; has been significant, spanning from its pilot episode to its subsequent successes. Additionally, his personal life includes a partnership with his wife Keisha, with whom he shares three children. Interestingly, their son Ollie has even made appearances in sketches featured on &quot;The War.&quot;

Known for his daring and humorous confrontations, Reucassel was often the chosen one to engage with prominent figures, such as former Prime Minister John Howard. One particularly memorable encounter involved an axe stunt during one of Howard&#x27;s morning walks.

===Speedos incident===
On March 19, 2007, an incident unfolded during a campaign event for the New South Wales State Election involving the then opposition leader, Peter Debnam, and the comedic antics of Craig Bruce Reucassel. Dressed in nothing but Speedos and a baseball cap, Reucassel humorously parodied Debnam&#x27;s penchant for campaign appearances in swimwear.

As TV cameras shifted their focus to Reucassel rather than Debnam, the comedian seized the opportunity to inject humor into the situation, quipping, &quot;Sorry, I&#x27;m not Peter Debnam, he&#x27;s over there. Just because I&#x27;m wearing this doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m Peter Debnam.&quot; Despite his comedic efforts, Reucassel&#x27;s attempts to elicit a response from the opposition leader were met with silence, and even his gesture to shake Debnam&#x27;s hand went unnoticed.

===The axe stunt===
On 2 August 2006, Reucassel responded to a news story about a private school student who had hugged then-Prime Minister John Howard while holding a screwdriver during one of Howard&#x27;s morning walks. To test the Prime Minister&#x27;s security arrangements, he approached Howard during a morning walk and asked for a hug while holding a large plastic battle axe. Reucassel did receive the hug, but a later approach while holding a running chainsaw was not so successful. There was much debate surrounding whether to turn on the chainsaw and whether they would be shot at for doing this. Cut out from this segment was an unsuccessful attempt that took place between the axe and the chainsaw, in which Reucassel was holding a four-point-star mace.

==Television career==
One of his notable hosting roles was on the Australian adaptation of &quot;Balls of Steel&quot;, which premiered in April 2011. 

Since 2013, Reucassel, alongside fellow Chaser member Julian Morrow, has been a main presenter on the ABC program &quot;The Checkout.&quot; This show delves into consumer rights and exposes unethical business practices, empowering viewers with valuable information about their purchases.

In 2017, Reucassel embarked on a significant environmental initiative with the four-part ABC TV series &quot;War on Waste.&quot; This groundbreaking program shed light on Australia&#x27;s alarming rates of clothing and food waste, highlighting their environmental consequences and advocating for sustainable solutions.

Following the success of &quot;War on Waste,&quot; Reucassel continued his environmental advocacy with the 2018 series &quot;Fight For Planet A: Our Climate Challenge.&quot; This installment focused on the detrimental impact of single-use plastics, such as straws, on the environment, urging viewers to adopt eco-friendly practices.

In 2019, he began acting as one of the hosts of The Drum on ABC TV.

Reucassel ventured into directing with the two-part ABC TV series &quot;Big Deal&quot; in 2021. This investigative program, hosted by actor Christiaan Van Vuuren, explored the influence of lobbying and donations on Australia&#x27;s political landscape.

==Other work==

In 2012, Reucassel was a patron of the Left Right Think-Tank, Australia&#x27;s first independent and non-partisan youth think-tank.

Since 2024, Reucassel has been presenting Breakfast on ABC Radio Sydney.

<doc id="830945" wikidata="Q6832493" url="?curid=830945" title="Michael Manning (murderer)">
<text>Michael Manning (1 September 1928 - 20 April 1954) was an Irish man who was convicted for rape and murder and executed in 1954. He was the 29th and last person to be executed in the Republic of Ireland, as capital punishment was gradually abolished in the decades following Manning&#x27;s execution.

==Murder and trial==
Manning, a 25-year-old carter from Johnsgate in Limerick, was found guilty in February 1954 of the rape and murder of Catherine Cooper, a 65-year-old nurse who worked at Barringtons&#x27; Hospital in the city. Nurse Cooper&#x27;s body was discovered on 18 November 1953 in the quarry under the New Castle, Dublin Road, Castletroy, where she was found to have choked on grass stuffed into her mouth to keep her from screaming during the commission of the crime.

Manning expressed remorse for the crime, which he did not deny. By his own account, he was making his way home on foot after a day’s drinking in The Black Swan, Annacotty when he saw a woman he did not recognise, walking alone. &quot;I suddenly lost my head and jumped on the woman and remember no more until the lights of a car shone on me.&quot; He took flight at this point but was arrested within hours, after his distinctive hat was found at the scene of the crime.

Although Manning made an impassioned plea for clemency in a letter to the Minister for Justice Gerald Boland, his request was denied, although it was supported by Nurse Cooper&#x27;s family. The execution by hanging was duly carried out on 20 April 1954 in Mountjoy Prison, Dublin by Albert Pierrepoint, who had travelled from Britain where he was one of three Senior Executioners.

Frank Prendergast, subsequently TD for Limerick East who knew Manning well, recalled later: &quot;Friends of mine who worked with me, I was serving my time at the time, went up to visit him on the Sunday before he was hanged. And they went to Mass and Holy Communion together and they played a game of handball that day. He couldn&#x27;t have been more normal.&quot;

Manning left a wife who was pregnant at the time of the murder. His body was buried in an unmarked grave in a yard at Mountjoy Prison.

==Aftermath==
The death penalty was abolished in 1964 for all but the murder of Gardaí, diplomats and prison officers. It was abolished by statute for these remaining offences in 1990 and was finally expunged from the Constitution of Ireland by a referendum in 2001.

<text>Derrick is a German crime television series produced between 1974 and 1998, starring Horst Tappert as Detective Chief Inspector (&quot;Kriminaloberinspektor&quot;) Stephan Derrick, and Fritz Wepper as Detective Sergeant (&quot;Kriminalhauptmeister&quot;) Harry Klein, his loyal assistant. They solve murder cases in Munich and surroundings (with three unsolved cases in total). It was produced by Telenova Film und Fernsehproduktion in association with ZDF, ORF and SRG.

&quot;Derrick&quot; is considered to be one of the most successful television programmes in German television history; it was also a major international success, with the series sold in over 100 countries.
It has been claimed ZDF would no longer carry reruns of the show, after Tappert was found to have been quiet about his service in the Waffen-SS in World War II. However, ZDF has denied that claim.

==History==
All 281 sixty-minute episodes were written by veteran screenwriter Herbert Reinecker and produced by Helmut Ringelmann. As a rule, new &quot;Derrick&quot; episodes were broadcast on Friday night at 8:15 p.m. The series received enormous popularity, and was aired in more than 100 countries worldwide.

The series&#x27; discontinuation in October 1998 came as Horst Tappert had reached the age limit he had set himself.

&quot;Derrick&quot; had many fan clubs abroad, including the Netherlands and France. In France, &quot;Derrick&quot; is known as &quot;Inspecteur Derrick&quot;. In Italy, the show is called &quot;L&#x27;ispettore Derrick&quot;. In Chinese, it is known as &quot;Dé li kè&quot;.

==Evolution of concept==
Some episodes follow a whodunit structure, while others follow a howcatchem structure.

The series took a noticeable turn towards psychological drama as time progressed, and Derrick approached retirement age. Acting on a hunch, Derrick would ignore a number of possible suspects right from the start, and instead of doing the legwork often shown in police movies, would follow the main suspect to his or her favourite haunts and involve them in lengthy conversations, claiming that he had to get to know them better. Towards the end of the show, the murderers, now revolted by what they had done, would then be prepared to confess to their crimes without Derrick having to produce any further evidence. Generally, the show has little violence or bloodshed, and no shoot-out at the end.

===Final episode===
This philosophy also held true to the last episode, &quot;Das Abschiedsgeschenk&quot; (&quot;The Farewell Gift&quot;). Originally, Derrick was supposed to die by the hands of one of the criminals he had incarcerated, just as he is about to take a new job as the chief of Europol. The violent end was eventually scrapped, though; while there is a shoot-out, no one is killed, and Derrick goes on into the dark city and towards a new life.

==Derrick and Klein==
As the series begins, Derrick has only recently been promoted from &quot;Hauptinspektor&quot; to &quot;Oberinspektor&quot;. The personal relationship between Derrick and his assistant, Klein, is characterized by Derrick&#x27;s frequent annoyance over Klein, which takes its form as sarcastic remarks to the point of rolling his eyes and shaking his head over his companion in front of witnesses and in public. The reason for this animosity remains unclear, since Klein rarely makes any mistakes, yet Derrick seems to pick at him quite regularly. Klein, though, never talks back and also never gives the slightest appearance of taking offense at this low-level bullying. These many minor episodes notwithstanding, the two work very professionally and organically as a team, but with Derrick always as the leading partner. This behavior of Derrick&#x27;s becomes less noticeable as the seasons progress.

Derrick hardly has any private life; a girlfriend occurs only in two episodes. In one episode, Derrick says, &quot;no, I am no longer married&quot;; Klein, however, does not seem to have any private life; as a younger inspector, he seems to love getting statements from young, good-looking girls. In that respect and also in the way he goes about a case, Derrick resembles Lt. Columbo. As Umberto Eco has pointed out, though, Columbo is the obedient public servant of rich and powerful Californians (even as he relentlessly, remorselessly, and successfully pursues those engaged in wrongdoing, particularly murder) while Derrick, elegantly dressed and impeccably behaved, always appears in control, and is superior even to the wealthy people he is tracking down.

Just like an earlier television series, &quot;Der Kommissar&quot; (also written by Reinecker), &quot;Derrick&quot; features many prominent German and Austrian actors and actresses (including a few expatriates), such as Lilli Palmer, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Maria Schell, Horst Buchholz, Curd Jürgens, Christine Kaufmann, Brigitte Mira, Gottfried John, Sybil Danning, Reinhard Kolldehoff, Carl Möhner, Eric Pohlmann, Anton Diffring, Ursula Buchfellner and Christoph Waltz. Many appeared repeatedly in different roles throughout several of the seasons.

As one of the first Western TV series shown on the screen of Chinese televisions after the country opened its gate to outside world in 1980s, the series (as &quot;Detective Derek&quot; – 《探长德里克》) was popular in China. Reportedly, it was also actually used to teach police officers and inspectors in proper procedure of tracing and solving criminal cases. &quot;Derrick&quot; reached cult status in Australia, where it screened on SBS Television with English subtitles.

===&quot;Harry, hol schon mal den Wagen&quot;===
The famous phrase &quot;Harry, hol schon mal den Wagen&quot; (&quot;Harry, bring the car &#x27;round&quot;; implying &quot;we&#x27;re done here&quot;) was attributed to Derrick and became part of popular culture in Germany and China as catch phrases. Actually, this phrase was never spoken in any of the 281 episodes; however, in the second episode of the series, &quot;Johanna&quot; (which premiered on 3 November 1974), Derrick orders Klein &quot;Harry! Wir brauchen den Wagen sofort!&quot; (&quot;Harry! We need the car immediately!&quot;). The exact same phrase was used by Erik Ode in the earlier TV series &quot;Der Kommissar&quot;, where Fritz Wepper already played the character named Harry Klein, then the assistant to a different police inspector (played by Ode).

How exactly this phrase became attributed to Derrick is unknown, but one theory is that since &quot;Der Kommissar&quot; and &quot;Derrick&quot; were both created and written by screenwriter Herbert Reinecker, a TV critic may have attributed this phrase to the wrong one of Reinecker&#x27;s series, after which it entered German popular culture as a catch phrase for Derrick. Horst Tappert did, however, speak this phrase in character as Stephan Derrick was as voice actor of his animated self in the 2004 animated feature film &quot;Derrick – die Pflicht ruft&quot; (&quot;Derrick – Duty calls&quot;; see &quot;Beam me up, Scotty&quot; for a catchphrase with a similar background). This animated film shed some satirical light on the ever-serious and sombre world of the original series, making fun of numerous clichés attributed to the series, including Harry&#x27;s rumoured envy over Derrick standing in the spotlight, while he, Derrick&#x27;s assistant for 25 years, always stood behind his boss.

==International popularity==

==References in popular culture==
&quot;Derrick&quot; was briefly referenced in Marjane Satrapi&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;Persepolis&quot;.

&quot;Inspektor Derrick&quot; is referenced in Elfriede Jelinek&#x27;s &quot;Die Kinder der Toten&quot;.

The series was parodied on the Norwegian comedy show &quot;Åpen Post&quot;. It was humorously claimed that NRK had bought the rights to produce dubbed remakes of the series&#x27; original episodes after the show stopped airing in Germany. However, NRK could not afford expensive remakes, leading to a very simplistic (and, in the viewers&#x27; eyes, ridiculous) approach to the show, involving uninspired actors and a strong lack of action.

&quot;Derrick&quot; has been parodied in the Netherlands in a series called &quot;Jiskefet&quot;. Herman Koch played the role of inspector Tampert (this name is a corruption of Tappert) and Michiel Romeyn that of his assistant. The parody contained a lot of faux-German and emphasized the slowness of the original series.

In the Netherlands a new phone number was introduced in 2000, to reach the police authorities for non-urgent requests. A TV campaign was launched in 2002 to make the number more well known, entitled &quot;Geen spoed – wel politie&quot; (no urgency – but still police). The TV spot showed Tappert at his house, preparing bratwurst, while being constantly disturbed by phone calls from people trying to reach the police.

==Books==
Derrick was also used as the protagonist for a series of books published in Germany and Italy:

* Das große Derrick Buch (), Henschel Verlag 
* Das Derrick Buch (), Henschel Verlag 
* Derrick «Harry, hol schon mal den Wagen» (), Ullstein (for ZDF) 
* Die Derrick Story (), BSV Burgschmiet Verlag 
* Grazie, Derrick (), Bompiani 
* Derrick – L&#x27;ordre des choses (), Les Editions de l&#x27;Hèbe

<text>Miroslav Holub (; 13 September 1923 – 14 July 1998) was a Czech poet and immunologist.

Holub&#x27;s work was heavily influenced by his experiences as an immunologist, writing many poems using his scientific knowledge to poetic effect. His work is almost always unrhymed, so lends itself easily to translation. It has been translated into more than 30 languages and is especially popular in the English-speaking world. Although one of the most internationally well-known Czech poets, his reputation continues to languish at home.

Holub was born in Plzeň. His first book in Czech was &quot;Denní služba&quot; (1958), which abandoned the somewhat Stalinist bent of poems earlier in the decade (published in magazines).

In English, he was first published in the &quot;Observer&quot; in 1962, and five years later a &quot;Selected Poems&quot; appeared in the Penguin Modern European Poets imprint, with an introduction by Al Alvarez and translations by Ian Milner and George Theiner. Holub&#x27;s work was lauded by many, including Ted Hughes and Seamus Heaney (eg there are five poems by Holub in their 1982 anthology &quot;The Rattle Bag&quot;), and his influence is visible in Hughes&#x27; collection &quot;Crow&quot; (1970).

In addition to poetry, Holub wrote many short essays on various aspects of science, particularly biology and medicine (specifically immunology) and life. A collection of these, titled &quot;The Dimension of the Present Moment,&quot; is still in print. In the 1960s, he published two books of what he called &#x27;semi-reportage&#x27; about extended visits to the United States.

Under the fictitious name &quot;Jaromil,&quot; Holub figures prominently in Patricia Hampl&#x27;s memoir of her Czech heritage, &quot;A Romantic Education,&quot; first published in 1981 and reissued in 1999 with an Afterword revealing his real name. 

The minor planet , an outer main belt asteroid, is named in his honour.

<text>Reydon is a village and civil parish, north-west of Southwold and south-east of Wangford, in the East Suffolk district and the ceremonial county of Suffolk, England. Its population of 2,567 in 2001 including Easton Bavents eased up to 2,582 at the 2011 Census, and was estimated at 2,772 in 2018. The name probably means &quot;Rye Hill&quot;, &quot;Rey&quot; meaning rye and &quot;-don&quot; being an old word for hill or rise). The village is close to the cliffs at Easton Bavents, a village now much eroded. Both were established before neighbouring Southwold. The parish church is St Margaret of Antioch. The parish of Easton Bavents was merged with Reydon in 1987, when part of Southwold was also transferred.

==Communications and services==
There are three main roads through Reydon, around which the village is built: A1095 Halesworth heading west to Blythburgh and Halesworth, B1126 Wangford heading north-west through Reydon to Wangford, and B1127 Lowestoft heading north-east to Wrentham and Lowestoft. The village of Reydon lies to the north of the town of Southwold. The three main roads converge at Reydon Corner, about 100 metres from Mights Bridge across Buss Creek, which provides the only road entry to Southwold.

Reydon has two shops. Local opposition could not prevent the sub-post office from closing on 11 February 2008, but the associated shop continues. It also has a pub/hotel with restaurant, &quot;The Randolph Hotel&quot;, in Wangford Road. It was renamed &quot;The Cricketers&quot;, due to the adjacent locality of Southwold&#x27;s former Eversley School cricket ground and playing fields, but reverted to its original name. The cricket ground was sold for housing and has now been built upon.

Further along is a group of new houses on the site of a former senior school, Reydon Modern, renamed Reydon High after converting into a comprehensive in 1978, but closed in 1990.

Continuing towards Wangford, there is St Margaret&#x27;s Church (see below), then Reydon Hall, at one time the home of the writers Elizabeth Strickland, Agnes Strickland, Jane Margaret, Catharine Parr, Susanna Moodie and Samuel Strickland.

Reydon Wood is popular with walkers, especially when carpeted with bluebells in the spring. There is sheltered accommodation in Lowestoft Road.

==Education==
Reydon Primary School caters for 200 children aged three to eleven, from the village and surrounding area. At age 11, most pupils moved on to Sir John Leman High School in Beccles, with some choosing to attend Bungay High School. However, after a 2019 decision by Suffolk County Council on eligibility for free school transport, the default 11–16 secondary school for Reydon students is now Pakefield High School in Lowestoft.

Up to 1990, secondary education was provided by Reydon High School. After its closure in that year, students were then bussed to other schools in the area, and the land sold for housing development. The school playing fields are still in use, with the original school canteen building being used for changing rooms. Plans to extend the fields have been adopted by Waveney District Council.

Saint Felix School on the Halesworth Road is independent. Founded as a girls&#x27; public school in 1897, it now takes pupils of both sexes aged 1–18. The independent St George&#x27;s School on the same site closed in 2004.

==Development and building==
Reydon has seen much new housing construction recently, due mainly to rising house prices in Southwold and the popularity of Reydon itself as a retirement village. Housing replaced the former Eversley School playing field to the south of the Randolph Hotel, and further construction is planned on other vacant plots throughout the village, and on adjacent farmland. According to figures in the 2011 Census, Reydon&#x27;s permanent population has risen to more than double that of Southwold.

The spread of new homes has lost Reydon much of its village atmosphere. Additionally, rising house prices in Southwold have led to several properties in Reydon being purchased as second homes, often unoccupied for long periods. However, this is unlikely to affect the increase in permanent population, at least in the short term.

In 2004, a 4400 m2 distribution centre for Adnams Brewery was constructed on the western edge of Reydon on the site of an old open-cast sand quarry.

==The Church of St Margaret==

The parish church, dedicated to St Margaret of Antioch, stands in Wangford Road, to the north-west of the village. One of its striking features is a large, unnamed bronze angel inscribed &quot;To Fanny my beloved wife&quot;. The present building is mainly from the early 14th century. The tower was built about 1325. The chancel was restyled in the 15th century, and has many niches for saints in the window splays. The church suffered damage during the Reformation and the Civil War and was much altered in succeeding centuries.

More drastic was the restoration and re-roofing of 1875–1887, which robbed the church of most of its old furnishings and architectural detail. The replacement roof is of a plain, simple design. The royal arms displayed are those of Queen Anne and date from 1713. In 1988 a large extension was built onto the north side of the nave using the original north door, which was reopened when the organ was moved into the chancel to allow for the building. The building is the frequently-used parish room. The rood loft stairs are open but partly bricked up at the top.

The Victorian organ is in the chancel, for want of space in the nave, but it clutters the space and distracts attention from some Victorian stained glass. Behind the organ is a blocked entrance, also apparent from the outside. The small chapel to which it led has vanished. The font, of no great age, stands at the base of the tower, having been moved there from the nave in 1988 to improve access to a new parish room. The font cover, donated in 1922, was once suspended from the ceiling in the nave and operated by a system of weights; the wood in the roof still shows this.

In 1999, the parish of Reydon became part of the Sole Bay Team Ministry.

===The church bells ===

The tower originally held three bells, two of which were sold in 1792 to fund repairs to the church. In 1991 an appeal was launched to restore the tower, replace the two missing bells and procure a further three. These were dedicated at a service in December 1996. The original 15th-century bell, &quot;Gabriel&quot;, has been joined by &quot;Michael&quot;, &quot;Raphael&quot;, &quot;Peter&quot;, &quot;Mary&quot; and &quot;Seraph&quot;, all cast at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1995 and 1996. The tenor (the largest) weighs 517 kg and the treble (the smallest) about a third of that. The bells hang in a two-tier steel frame, installed in 1995. The bells are hung for the traditional English art of change ringing. Ringing takes place from ground level with the font in the centre of the rope circle. The tower is affiliated to the Suffolk Guild of Ringers. The bells are rung regularly for practice, Sunday services, weddings and other special occasions.

<doc id="831012" wikidata="Q984209" url="?curid=831012" title="William Symington">
<text>William Symington (1764–1831) was a Scottish engineer and inventor during the Georgian era. He is most well known as the builder of the first practical steamboat, the Charlotte Dundas. The engine has been described as &quot;without doubt the most compact and efficient marine steam engine up to that time&quot; and its design would influence later steamboat and steamship engine designs. While Symington died in poverty after failing to commercialise his steam engine designs, he is still credited as one of the great inventors of the early Industrial Revolution.

==Early life==
Symington was born in Leadhills, South Lanarkshire, Scotland, to a family he described as being &quot;respectable but not wealthy.&quot; His father worked as a practical mechanic at the Leadhills mines.

Although his parents intended for him to enter the ministry, he intended to use his good education to make a career as an engineer. So, in 1785, he joined his brother George in his attempts to build a steam engine at Wanlockhead, Dumfriesshire. While there, he impressed the manager of a local mining company, Gilbert Meason, so much that he was sent to the University of Edinburgh in 1786 to spend a few months attending science lectures.

By the time William joined his brother, George had already succeeded in building the second engine using James Watt&#x27;s design to be built in Scotland.

==Improvements to Watt&#x27;s design==

Symington quickly saw a way to marry the efficiency of the Watt engine with the simplicity of that devised by Thomas Newcomen. Encouraged by Gilbert Meason, Symington demonstrated the practicality of his idea and his improved atmospheric engine was patented in 1787. When Watt sent someone to make a sketch of how this new engine worked, he discovered that the steam was condensed under a second piston and this was then pushed down when fresh steam entered the cylinder, forcing out the condensate. The power piston worked by the atmospheric pressure acting on the vacuum created by the condensing steam.

After its completion, Symington drew up a prospectus outlining the advantages of his invention, and this was circulated by Meason and his influential friends.

==Dalswinton steamboat==
The banker Patrick Miller of Dalswinton, just north of Dumfries, had experimented with double hulled pleasure boats propelled by cranked paddlewheels placed between the hulls, and he got Symington to build the patent steam engine with its drive into a pleasure boat built in 1785 which was successfully tried out on Dalswinton Loch near Miller&#x27;s house on 14 October 1788. The trial was said to have been a success and the boat stated to have reached 8 kilometers an hour in speed.

Alexander Nasmyth depicted her on her trial run. A version of the illustration held by the Science Museum in London, Ref No. 0307379 shows her flying a red saltire, presumably a lithographer&#x27;s mistake. James Nasmyth in his autobiography published in 1883 stated erroneously that she was built of tinned iron plate.

==The canal steamboat==
After the successful demonstration of a steam engine on a boat, a larger engine was commissioned that would be tried in a boat on the Forth and Clyde Canal.

The parts for the engine were ordered and an engine similar to that used previously, but a lot larger, was erected on another twin hull paddle boat. It was . The first trial, on 2 December 1789, was unsuccessful because the paddle wheels were not up to the task and began to break up when an increase in speed was attempted.

Patrick Miller, the patron of the venture, sanctioned repairs and, on 26 and 27 December, more successful trials were done.

==Mines and mills==
Although Symington is best remembered for his contribution to steam powered vessels, he also built successful engines for mines and mills.

The first of these was built on a mine in Wanlockhead in 1790. This was followed by engines in Sanquhar, and then in London. In 1792, he built a large pumping engine that James Watt was also considered for. In the same year, he built an engine for the colliery of James Bruce. This marked a move to live near Falkirk and, later, a place as engine consultant for the Carron Company.

In 1793, he developed a crank drive with a crosshead above the cylinder, and built such an engine to wind coal from one of Bruce&#x27;s pits. his engine proved very successful and about fifteen were built.

In all, there are firm references to thirty-two engines built by Symington up until 1808, and passing mention of several more.

==More steamboats==
It was Thomas, Lord Dundas who would motivate further steamboat trials. This was because he had extensive business interests on the east and west coasts and was governor of the Forth and Clyde Canal Company. Therefore, the canal was essential to his business, and steam power could speed up the movement of vessels through the canal. It helped progress that the Dundas family were one of the most powerful families of the late 18th century.

At a meeting of company directors on 5 June 1800, Dundas brought up the idea of having a Captain Schank boat worked by a steam engine provided by Symington. The directors immediately agreed that this was a good idea.

A diagram of Symington&#x27;s engine recently came to light and it showed an engine driving a forward wheel (or two wheels, one on either side) within the hull. The boat was built by Alexander Hart at Grangemouth and was tested on the River Carron in June 1801, when it moved with ease. It was less successful on the canal and was rejected by the committee.

By 1800, Watt&#x27;s patent had expired, so Symington set about the task of building a horizontal engine. He applied and received a patent for his design in 1801. This design was ahead of its time because other engineers believed that it would not work. It was not widely accepted until 1825.

==The &quot;Charlotte Dundas&quot;==
Since the Canal Company had not been satisfied with the first boat, Lord Dundas gave Symington his support for the building of a second boat. Therefore, a model of the new boat was shown to Dundas and was named after one of his daughters in an attempt to secure his interest. The hull of the boat was made by John Allan to Symington&#x27;s direction and the Carron Company made the engine.

The &quot;Charlotte Dundas&quot; was first sailed on 4 January 1803, with Lord Dundas and some of his friends and relatives on board. The crowd were pleased with what they saw, but Symington wanted to make improvements and another more ambitious trial was made on 28 March. On this occasion, the steamboat towed two loaded vessels through the canal, covering 18½ miles in 9½ hours.

The &quot;Charlotte Dundas&quot; therefore became the first boat to do more than just move itself, but the Canal Company – to Symington&#x27;s disappointment – did not wish to pursue the construction of another vessel. Lord Dundas invited Symington to meet Duke of Bridgewater with a view to order 8 new boats for his canal. However, Symington was further upset when a scheme to build tug boats for the Duke of Bridgewater collapsed when the Duke died a few days before the trial was due to take place.

==Colliery manager==
As well as an engine builder, Symington was a colliery manager, also known as a &#x27;viewer&#x27;. His first appointment in this capacity was in 1794 when the Trustees asked him to take over on James Bruce&#x27;s death. His salary for this was £100 per annum and a house on the estate. This appointment ended in 1800 when Symington took over management of the Grange colliery near Bo&#x27;ness. William Cadell was behind Symington at this job.

In 1804, he joined a local businessman in a partnership intended to manage the Callendar colliery at Falkirk. A new pump was needed there and this allowed Symington to develop what he called a &#x27;lifting engine&#x27;. He may have built one of these for the Wanlockhead mines in 1789.

The Callendar venture ended badly, however, and, in a dispute at the High Court in Edinburgh that lasted until 1810, Symington lost.

==Last years==

Due to Patrick Miller&#x27;s unwillingness to pursue the potential of the 1789 trial, the loss of interest from Lord Dundas and the proceedings at the High Court, Symington was left out-of-pocket. Aware of his engineering legacy and financial difficulties, Ronald Craufurd Ferguson, the MP for Dysart Burghs presented a petition to the House of Lords for Symington to receive financial assistance in 1825 from the Government. While he was not awarded a pension, the House of Lords issued him with two lifetime payments ex gratia of £50 and 
£100.

In 1829, in ill health and in debt, Symington and his wife moved to London to live with their daughter and her husband. Symington died in 1831 and was buried in St. Botulph&#x27;s without Aldgate churchyard.

==Honours and memorials==
In 1890, a bust was unveiled in Edinburgh, in what is now the National Museum, in memory of the great engineer.

In 1891, a memorial in obelisk form was erected to Symington, by public subscription, in the mining village of Leadhills where Symington was born. The monument remains and overlooks a row of miners&#x27; cottages.

He was inducted into the Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame in 2023.

<text>William Stuart Symington III ( ; June 26, 1901 – December 14, 1988) was an American businessman and Democratic politician from Missouri. He served as the first secretary of the Air Force from 1947 to 1950 and was a United States senator from Missouri from 1953 to 1976.

Born in Amherst, Massachusetts, Symington worked as an executive in his uncle&#x27;s iron products company and for other companies before becoming president of Emerson Electric. He resigned from Emerson in 1945 to take various positions in the administration of President Harry S. Truman, becoming the first Secretary of the Air Force in 1947. He was elected to the Senate in 1952, defeating incumbent Republican Senator James P. Kem. He joined the United States Senate Armed Services Committee and the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and emerged as a prominent critic of McCarthyism.

Symington sought the Democratic nomination in the 1960 presidential election with the backing of former President Truman, but the nomination went to John F. Kennedy. After the Kansas City Athletics moved to Oakland, Symington threatened to revoke Major League Baseball&#x27;s antitrust exemption, which in turn encouraged the formation of the Kansas City Royals. Symington declined to seek re-election in 1976 and was succeeded by John Danforth.

==Education and business career==
Symington was born in Amherst, Massachusetts, the son of Emily Kuhn (née Harrison) and William Stuart Symington Jr. His father, who received a Ph.D in French literature, was a Romance languages professor at Stanford and Amherst College before pursuing a law career and becoming a federal judge in Baltimore, Maryland. His mother came from a prominent Maryland family.
Symington grew up in Baltimore, and was the oldest of his five brothers and sisters. Symington attended Roland Park Public School and the Gilman School, a private all-male preparatory school in Baltimore&#x27;s Roland Park neighborhood. He graduated from Baltimore City College in 1918, and at the age of 17, Symington enlisted in the United States Army as a private first class during World War I.

Stationed in an Officer Training Program at Camp Zachary Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, Symington was never deployed to fight in World War I, with the war ending before he could seek deployment. Symington was commissioned as a second lieutenant, becoming one of the youngest members of the Army to achieve that rank; being discharged as a second lieutenant in January 1919.

He graduated from Yale University in 1923. At Yale he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Phi chapter), the Elihu senior society, and served on the board of the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot;. In 1924, he married the former Evelyn Wadsworth in a lavish ceremony attended by President Coolidge and other prominent politicians. By all accounts, the two had a very happy marriage and were known for their devotions and faithfulness to each other, both of which were not always present among the social elite. When Evelyn died in 1972, Symington was devastated, telling his biographer that &quot;he never knew this much loneliness could be around.&quot;

In 1923, Symington went to work for an uncle in the shops of the Symington Company of Rochester, New York, manufacturers of malleable iron products. Two years later he formed Eastern Clay Products but in 1927 returned to the Symington Company as executive assistant to the President.

Symington resigned in 1930 to become President of the Colonial Radio Corporation. In January 1935, he accepted the presidency of Rustless Iron and Steel Corporation (manufacturers of stainless steel) but remained a director of Colonial Radio Corporation.

When Rustless Iron and Steel Corporation was sold to the American Rolling Mill Company in 1937, Symington resigned and in 1938 accepted the presidency of Emerson Electric Company in St. Louis, Missouri. During World War II he transformed the company into the world&#x27;s largest builder of airplane gun turrets. Symington, who was an active proponent of racial justice (&quot;All Americans should have their chance&quot;) integrated the Emerson Electric work force, which resulted in increased productivity.

==First Secretary of the Air Force==
He resigned from Emerson in 1945 to join the administration of fellow Missourian Harry S. Truman. His first positions were chairman of the Surplus Property Board (1945), administrator of the Property Administration (1945–1946) and Assistant Secretary of War for Air (1946–1947).

On September 18, 1947, the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force was created and Symington became the first secretary. Symington had a stormy term as he worked to win respect for the United States Air Force, which previously had been part of the Army. He had numerous public battles with Secretary of Defense James Forrestal.

===Cancellation of the Flying Wing===
During his tenure, there was a major debate and investigation into production of the Convair B-36 Peacemaker, which was the last piston-powered bomber at the beginning of the Jet Age. During his tenure, Symington had a meeting with John K. Northrop on the contract for the YB-49 Flying Wing bomber, which was well underway with seven examples manufactured. During this meeting, Symington threatened Northrop that if they refused to enter into a corporate merger with Convair (the company building the rival B-36 Peacemaker bomber) that Northrop would be, &quot;Goddamn sorry if you don&#x27;t!&quot;. This threat, later reported by Northrop, was eventually carried though when Symington cancelled the Flying Wing programme and ordered all existing aircraft destroyed.

Major accomplishments during Symington&#x27;s term as Secretary included the Berlin Airlift and championing the United States Air Force Academy. Symington resigned in 1950 to protest lack of funding for the Air Force after the USSR detonated its first nuclear weapon. He remained in the administration as the Chairman of the National Security Resources Board (1950–1951) and the Chairman of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation Administrator (1951–1952). He was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s January 19, 1948 issue.

==U.S. Senator==
===Election===
At the urging of his father-in-law James Wolcott Wadsworth Jr., a former Republican Speaker of the New York State Assembly and U.S. Senator from New York, Symington decided to run for the U.S. Senate.

In 1952, he was elected Senator from Missouri, taking the seat previously held by Truman and scoring a win for the Democrats in a year otherwise favorable to the Republicans. He was re-elected in 1958, 1964, and 1970.

===Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees===
As a member of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees, Symington specialized in military affairs and became known as an advocate for a strong national defense. He was also a strong supporter of the Air Force Academy.

In 1954, he charged that the Department of Defense had wasted millions of dollars on outdated weapons. He became a leading critic of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War (1957–1975). During 1966, he was thoroughly briefed on the Central Intelligence Agency-run covert operations of the Laotian Civil War. At one point, he was a guest of CIA Chief of Station Ted Shackley while touring the Kingdom of Laos. In the early 1970s, when his committee held hearings on the subject, Symington professed shocked outrage at the CIA&#x27;s audacity.

===Opponent of Joseph McCarthy===
Symington was an especially vocal opponent of Senator Joseph McCarthy, to the vexation of the latter, who nicknamed him &quot;Sanctimonious Stu&quot;. He involved himself in the case of Annie Lee Moss, who had been brought before McCarthy&#x27;s committee under the accusation that she was a Communist spy. Evidence supporting this claim was given by an undercover FBI agent who could not be cross-examined by Mrs. Moss or her counsel. As it appeared that Moss had been mistakenly identified, Symington proclaimed before the packed audience that he believed she was not a Communist and had never been, receiving thunderous applause from those present. Later that year, Symington took a lead role in censuring McCarthy during the Army–McCarthy hearings, capitalizing upon his prominence and expertise as a former Secretary of the Air Force.

===Presidential candidacy===
In 1959, Symington, then Chairman of the National Security Resources Board in Washington, D.C., was preparing to run in the 1960 presidential election and won the backing of former President and fellow Missourian Harry Truman, but eventually lost the nomination to Senator John F. Kennedy. On July 2, 1960, Truman announced that he would not be attending the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. Truman was miffed that the convention was being controlled by the &quot;overzealous&quot; supporters of Kennedy. Announcing his decision, Truman restated his support for the candidacy of Symington and added, &quot;I have no second choice&quot;.

Symington, unlike Kennedy or Lyndon B. Johnson, refused to speak to segregated audiences in the southern United States and this hurt his chances. Additionally, having concluded that the nomination would be determined by party bosses at the convention, Symington declined to enter any of the Democratic primaries, clearing the way for Kennedy to win enough primaries to be the frontrunner and probable nominee as the convention opened. He was Kennedy&#x27;s first choice for Vice President, but was dropped in favor of Texas Senator Lyndon B. Johnson. He advised President Kennedy as a member of EXCOMM during the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.

===Other issues===
Symington was also committed to constituent services, answering letters from Missouri citizens both important, trivial, and sometimes even zany. As an example, Symington once formally requested a report from military sources regarding the possible existence of subterranean superhumans, which one of his constituents had become concerned about after reading a fiction book and mistaking it for non-fiction. In 2002, this and Symington&#x27;s other senatorial correspondence and papers were donated to the Western Historical Manuscripts Collection of the University of Missouri and are now available to the general public.

In 1967 when Major League Baseball owners approved the move of the Kansas City Athletics to Oakland, California, he threatened legislation to revoke the league&#x27;s antitrust exemption and vowed to support lawsuits challenging the legality of the reserve clause. Kansas City was awarded an expansion team, the Kansas City Royals, which was scheduled to begin play in 1971. Symington, saying Kansas City should not wait, continued to threaten the league, and the team began play in 1969. An indirect consequence of this was that Sick&#x27;s Stadium (the home of the other American League expansion team, the Seattle Pilots) was unable to be renovated in time for the season, its resulting poor quality being a leading reason for the team&#x27;s bankruptcy and subsequent move to Milwaukee as the Brewers after just one season.

Symington did not sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto, and voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court.

===Resignation===
In 1976, Symington did not seek a fifth term and resigned on December 27, a week before the end of his final term, so that his Republican successor, John Danforth, would gain a seniority advantage in the Senate.

==Legacy==

In 1962, in recognition of his career, Princeton University&#x27;s American Whig-Cliosophic Society awarded Symington the James Madison Award for Distinguished Public Service.

His son, James W. Symington, served in the United States House of Representatives from Missouri&#x27;s Second Congressional District from 1969 to 1977. His cousin, Fife Symington III, was Governor of Arizona from 1991 to 1997. His grandson, also named Stuart Symington, is employed by the U.S. State Department, and has served as U.S. ambassador to Djibouti (2006–2008), Rwanda (2008–2011) and Nigeria (2016–2019). Symington was an active member of the Grand Lodge of Missouri Ancient Free and Accepted Masons.

Symington retired in 1978 to his home in New Canaan, Connecticut, where he died on December 14, 1988.

He is buried in a crypt in Washington National Cathedral.

In Jeff Greenfield&#x27;s alternate history book &quot;If Kennedy Lived&quot;, Symington is featured as surviving-President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s running mate in the 1964 presidential election, after Vice President Lyndon Johnson was forced to leave due to financial scandals.

<text>Svazarm or Union for Cooperation with the [[Army]] (Czech: Svaz pro spolupráci s armádou / Svazarm, Slovak: Zväz pre spoluprácu s armádou / Zväzarm) was, in Communist Czechoslovakia, the largest &quot;paramilitary&quot; organisation, although many of the activities that Svazarm provided for its members were more reminiscent of a Boy Scout movement than of a regimented paramilitary group.

Established in 1951, the Svazarm was an almost exact copy of the Soviet Union&#x27;s DOSAAF, however, with massively scaled down maritime activities as Czechoslovakia was landlocked. However, canoeing was still a popular activity. In 1985, it had about one million members, 60% of whom were under 35 years of age.

==Activities==
The activities the Svazarm provided were extremely diverse, ranging from medical training to dog training. Dog lovers would be instructed in the training and breeding of dogs suitable for military purposes, especially German Shepherds. Shortwave radio operation was another popular activity, and was also useful for creating future radio operators in the army.

A more specialised branch of the Svazarm, based at Košice, trained pilots for the air force. Training included at least twenty flight hours of glider training and forty hours of basic training on motorised aeroplanes, as well as the necessary aviation theory.

There were also sections: Model airplanes and gliding (formally DOSLET), motor sport section (motorcycles and cars) and all sorts of shooting sports.

Svazarm also operated its own hi-fi club and record label, Čs. Hifi-klub, which distributed its releases primarily to club members. The repertoire included Czechoslovak and Warsaw Pact as well as Western artists.

==Svazarm members in the armed forces==

The Czechoslovakian military were usually less than impressed with the recruits that the Svazarm sent them, complaining that Svazarm members were &quot;too soft&quot; and lacked military knowledge. As military training for Svazarm members totalled 25 hours per year, and nearly all Svazarm instructors were insufficiently trained, this complaint was not unfounded.

Many Svazarm members thought that as any World War III would be fought with nuclear weapons, conventional military training was a complete waste of time and thus took up an apathetic view of the entire Svazarm enterprise.

It was also rumoured that many Svazarm trainers were not too enthusiastic themselves and would tell their students how to avoid being conscripted.

<doc id="831048" wikidata="Q512692" url="?curid=831048" title="Ngwane V">
<text>Ngwane V (also known as Mahlokohla, Bhunu, Hhili) (11 May 1876 – 10 December 1899) was the King of Swaziland from 1895 until his death on 10 December 1899. Ngwane was born the son of Mbandzeni and his mother was Labotsibeni Mdluli. He ascended to the throne after a short regency of Queen Mother Tibati Nkambule.
He was only 16 years old when he became king. His royal capital was at Zombodze while the Queen Mother&#x27;s residence was at Lobamba. 

Ngwane became the king after the Swaziland convention of 1894. This had led to the classification of Swaziland as a protected state of the South African Republic which was then led by President Paul Kruger. During this time Swaziland had a partial Dutch administration in parallel to Ngwane&#x27;s administration. The Dutch or European for European interests and Ngwane as head and authority of the Swazi nation. An annual payment was made to Ngwane and Labotsibeni while they were in office from taxes collected and from contributions from concessionaires and taxes. Ngwane&#x27;s rule was short. 

In 1899 the Anglo-Boer war began, and brought to an end the Dutch or Boer partial administration of Swaziland and hence gave way to independence. However Mahlokohla died on 10 December of that year while dancing incwala. This was hid from the nation until the ceremony was over. Ngwane was succeeded by his four-month-old son Nkhotfotjeni and his wife Lomawa Ndwandwe. His mother Labotsibeni who had been very influential during his reign continued as queen regent until Sobhuza was crowned in 1921. Ngwane&#x27;s reign gave way to a stable territory surrounded by conflicting states. Today Mahlokohla is named for one of the main streets, &quot;Mahlokohla Street&quot; in Swaziland&#x27;s capital Mbabane.

==Early life==

Ingwenyama Ngwane was born in 1876 to King Mbandzeni and inkhosikati Labotsibeni. He became the crown prince of Swaziland after his father&#x27;s death in 1889 during the &quot;paper conquest&quot; of Swaziland. He was however too young to be installed king, thus a queen regent ruled on his behalf until he was old enough and he was prepared for the reins of power. His mother Labotsibeni was the daughter of Matsafeni Mdluli who was a governor under Mswati II and was given the name &quot;Tsibeni&quot; while fighting the Tsibeni people in present-day Barberton. Ngwane had a younger brother named Prince Malunge.

==Reign==
The Swaziland convention of 1894 had seen Swaziland made a protected territory under the South African Republic. This meant that there existed some institutions in Swaziland particularly for European interests such as the concessionaires and other white settlers. The concessions, many of whom were granted during the reign of Mbandzeni and earlier by Mswati II were enforced. Ngwane and Queen Mother Labotsibeni were paid a stipend or proceeds from administrative revenues such as postal service, taxes and concession agreements. These taxes collected from Swazi residents meant that many had to seek employment in the tin and gold mines within the Kingdom or in the numerous mines of the South African Republic. The Transvaal authority in Swaziland was never fully implemented and Swazis continued to be directly ruled by traditional methods.

In 1898 Ngwane allegedly ordered the killing of royal governor Mbhabha Nsibandze and his collaborators. &quot;Killing off&quot;, a practice which existed in earlier precolonial times when the king had total judicial power was unacceptable to the Transvaal authorities. As a result, Ngwane was prosecuted. He first fled to Zululand which was under British Natal administration at the time. His return occurred after guarantees for his safety, after which he was tried in court in Bremersdorp (present day Manzini). Ngwane brought with him to court a large Swazi army, and in the trial was only charged with a minor offence of public disturbance. For this he was to pay a fine. For the rest of his rule, Ngwane oversaw a largely stable country and he maintained the old regimental system for warriors at the royal residences.

In 1899 war broke out between the British and the Boer Republics of Transvaal and the Orange Free State. As a result, all white residents of Swaziland or burghers were advised to leave Swaziland in anticipation for the skirmishes about to take place. President Paul Kruger notified Ngwane of the unfolding events and their withdrawal and advised him to continue to &quot;rule his country&quot; in peace. Swaziland, in a precarious position announced its neutrality in the conflict. However this was not to be as the Anglo-Boer war took place in Swaziland territory later on. As the result of the outbreak of the Anglo-Boer war, Swaziland regained its independence.

==Later life==

Ngwane died in December 1899 while dancing the sacred incwala ceremony at the age of 23. His death was speculated to be of poisoning and was not announced to the nation until the ceremony was over. The Swazi council then chose his wife Lomawa Ndwandwe and their four-month-old son Nkhotfotjeni to be Queen Mother and King. Sobhuza would remain as king-in-waiting until 1921 after a long regency of his grandmother Labotsibeni and his uncle Prince Malunge. Mahlokohla left Swaziland in an uncertain state but had led it as a stable country from a protectorate to short-lived independence (1899–1903). His son Sobhuza would rule Swaziland for 82 years and become the longest verifiable reigning monarch in history.

<text>Sir Roland Theodore Symonette, NH (16 December 1898 – 13 March 1980) was a Bahamian politician and the first Premier of the Bahamas after self-government was achieved in 1964. He was leader of the United Bahamian Party (UBP), which was the ruling party between 1958 and 1967. 

==Early life and education==
Roland &quot;Pop&quot; Symonette was one of nine children of Methodist minister Edwin Lofthouse Symonette and his wife Lavania Alethia (née Weech) on the small island settlement of Current, Eleuthera.

Although he had only six years of formal education, he became one of the wealthiest men of his generation. 

== Career ==
He was a school teacher early in his career. Later he tried to make his way as a fisherman and a tomato farmer in Riviera Beach, Florida, and then during Prohibition, Symonette transported whiskey to the United States.

During prohibition, liquor was legal in the Bahamas but not in the United States. Bahamian citizens could legally buy and transport alcohol as long as they stayed outside US territorial waters. Symonette was among the most successful of Bahamian bootleggers. With the profits from bootlegging, Symonette invested in real estate, hotels, and a shipyard which built boats for the British Navy during WWII.

== Politics ==
In 1925, Symonette campaigned successfully for a seat in the Bahamas&#x27; House of Assembly. He served in the House, representing the Shirlea district until his retirement in 1977. His 53 years as a Member of Parliament is the longest record of service in the House of Assembly.

Symonette served as the head of government of the Bahama Islands from 1955 to 1964 and, in 1964, when the country achieved internal self-government, he became the first Premier of the Bahama Islands. In 1959, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. After the 1967 elections, Symonette was appointed leader of the opposition in the House of Assembly of Bahamas.
==Personal life==
Symonette was married three times. He and his first wife Gertrude Nellie had one son, Basil. He and his second wife, the former Thelma Bell Clepper of Andalusia, Alabama, had a son, Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; and a daughter, Zelda. In the late 1940s, Symonette married Canadian Margaret Frances. They had one daughter, Margaret, who died of encephalitis when she was a toddler, and two sons, Roland and Brent. 

Symonette&#x27;s son Basil founded the Bitter End Resort in the BVI&#x27;s. His second son Bobby served as Speaker of the House of Assembly and his youngest son Brent Symonette later became the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Minister of Financial Services, Trade &amp; Industry and Immigration. 

== Death and legacy ==
Symonette died on 13 March 1980 at his home in Nassau. He was survived by wife, Lady Margaret Symonette three sons, and one daughter.

A community park in the settlement of Current, Eleuthera, Bahamas was named for him, a stone&#x27;s throw from his birthplace, on what would have been his 111th birthday on 16 December 2009. 

Symonette&#x27;s portrait appears on the Bahamian $50 note. In 2018, he was posthumously awarded the Bahamian Order of National Hero (NH).

<text>Jan Syrový (24 January 1888 – 17 October 1970) was a Czechoslovak general who was the prime minister of Czechoslovakia during the Munich Crisis.

==Early life and military career==
Jan Syrový studied building at a technical school. Following his graduation in 1906, he became a one-year volunteer in the Austro-Hungarian army. After that, he studied at a technical college in Russia. During World War I, he fought in the Czechoslovak Legions of the Russian Army and lost his right eye at the Battle of Zborov.

By the end of the war, he commanded the Legions and the anti-Bolshevik forces on the Trans-Siberian railway. A well-known veteran commander, he served as Chief of Staff of the Czechoslovak Army from 1926 to 1933 and as its general inspector from 1933 to 1938. He helped to prepare the Czechoslovak Air Force with the help of Jan Antonín Baťa and moved military personnel and materials away from Nazi Germany.

==Munich Crisis==
When Milan Hodža&#x27;s government resigned on 23 September 1938, President Edvard Beneš appointed Syrový to head a national unity government. Syrový demurred at first by insisting that he was just a soldier, not a politician, and that he lacked the qualifications and the relevant experience for such an important post. Beneš told Syrový that the nation needed him and added that as a soldier, Syrový should consider it not as an offer but an order. With some reluctance, Syrový accepted and took the defence portfolio as well.

Barely a week after becoming Prime Minister, he was forced to accept the terms of the Munich Agreement on 30 September. Announcing the acceptance of the agreement in a nationwide radio address, he stated that Czechoslovakia was not in a position to turn the agreement down because without British or French support, the country was outnumbered and any conflict would result in severe casualties. &quot;We were abandoned&quot;, he said. &quot;We stand alone&quot;.

After the resignation of Beneš on 5 October, Syrový assumed most presidential duties, in accord with the Czechoslovak Constitution until Emil Hácha was duly elected President on 30 November 1938.

He resigned the premiership on 1 December 1938 and remained as Minister of National Defence until 27 April 1939. He did not join the anti-German resistance since he was too well-known a figure for his involvement to be anything other than a liability. However, he arranged the transfer of substantial sums from a Legionary relief fund to assist the resistance and the people facing persecution.

== Later life ==
On 14 May 1945, in the immediate aftermath of the war, Syrový was arrested and charged with collaboration although he had consciously steered clear of that as far as his office allowed. In a show trial of alleged collaborators in 1947, the National Court found him guilty, along with Rudolf Beran, and sentenced him to 20 years of imprisonment in severe conditions.

Released in 1960 by Antonín Novotný&#x27;s amnesty, Syrový was left with no pension or any means of maintenance, and the communist regime barred him from employment. Eventually, he was allowed to work as a nightwatchman, guarding Luděk Marold&#x27;s panorama of the Battle of Lipany. Not until late 1967 would the regime grant him a limited retirement pension.

Syrový was deeply wounded by the verdict of the National Court and remained so for the rest of his life. His own conscience was clear, and he never came to terms with the apparent injustice of the decision. He reviewed his trial in an interview for the Report Magazine in 1968 and stated that there were three critical pieces of evidence laid against him. The first was a snapshot of himself shaking hands with Adolf Hitler during a meeting that he was obliged to attend at the Prague Castle. Hitler had made a speech of reassurance as to Czechoslovakia&#x27;s future under the &#x27;protection&#x27; of the Reich and then held out his hand to Syrový, and the photographers immediately took a picture.

Another photograph provided the second piece of evidence, which was taken at a government banquet that showed Syrový sitting alongside Konrad Henlein. Syrový stated that the picture was taken out of context, to be used for Nazi propaganda.

The third piece of critical evidence was an arms contract with the Nazis. Syrový stated the weapons sold had been obsolete items from the First World War, which were no longer of any use to Czechoslovakia, and that the weapons had been sold to German private companies. He also stated that the decision to sell was made ultimately not by him alone but by the government as a whole. Syrový felt that if the Czechoslovak allies had offered their promised help, he would never have had to accept the Munich Agreement, but under the circumstances, the Czechoslovak Army had no chance of success on its own.

Syrový died on 17 October 1970.

<text>British Bechuanaland was a short-lived Crown colony of the United Kingdom that existed in southern Africa from its formation on 30 September 1885 until its annexation to the neighbouring Cape Colony on 16 November 1895. British Bechuanaland had an area of and a population of 84,210. Today the region forms part of South Africa.

==History==
Bechuanaland meant &quot;the country of the Tswana&quot;, and for administrative purposes was divided into two political entities by the Molopo River. The northern part was administered as the Bechuanaland Protectorate, and the southern part was administered as the Crown colony of British Bechuanaland.
In 1882, the Tswana country suffered two secessions by the Boer states of Stellaland and Goshen. For many months, starting in 1883, pressure was placed on the British Government to take action in Bechuanaland because of unrest in the area. On 29 October 1884, the British Government appointed Sir Charles Warren as Special Commissioner of Bechuanaland. On 13 November 1884, Parliament voted a sum of £675,000 (this is equivalent to over £32 million today) for military operations in Bechuanaland. Sir Charles Warren was authorised to recruit an irregular force of 1,500 in South Africa in addition to the regular troops that would be provided.

A force of 4,000 troops, under Sir Charles Warren, set off to recapture Stellaland and Goshen. On 7 February 1885 the force reached Vryburg, the principal town in Stellaland, then continued to the hamlet of Rooigrond, the administrative centre of Goshen. Just north of Rooigrond the town of Mafeking was laid out as an administrative centre. By 8 April 1885, Sir Charles Warren sent a dispatch to notify the British Government that he had occupied Bechuanaland and had entirely restored order. The two Boer republics had collapsed without any bloodshed.

On 30 September 1885, Stellaland, Goshen and other territories to the south of the Molopo and Nossob rivers (excluding Griqualand West) were constituted as the Crown Colony of British Bechuanaland. In 1891, the South African Customs Union was extended to British Bechuanaland, and, in 1895, the colony was annexed to the Cape Colony and now forms part of South Africa, the area around Mafikeng.

<text>Árpád Szakasits (; 6 December 1888 – 3 May 1965) was a Hungarian Social Democrat, then Communist politician. He served as the country&#x27;s head of state from 1948 to 1950, the first Communist to hold the post.

A longtime leader of the Hungarian Social Democratic Party, he supported its merger with the Hungarian Communist Party to form the Hungarian Working People&#x27;s Party. When President Zoltán Tildy was forced to resign, Szakasits was named his successor on 3 August 1948 as part of the final stage of the Communists&#x27; complete takeover of the country.

After the adoption of a new Soviet-style Constitution in 1949, the presidency was replaced with a Presidential Council, and Szakasits became its chairman on 23 August 1949, serving until 26 April 1950.

In 1950, as acting chairman, he was arrested on trumped-up charges of war crimes, espionage, and conspiracy to overthrow the democratic order, and sentenced to life imprisonment. He was released in March 1956. He was also rehabilitated in the spirit of de-Stalinisation. After the Hungarian Revolution, he took part in the consolidation of the Communist regime, and from 1958 he became president of the National Association of Hungarian Journalists and again a member of parliament. He was elected President of the National Peace Council in 1960 and was also President of the World Federation of Hungarians from 1959 to 1963.

Until his death he was a member of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (MSZMP).

Szakasits was an Esperantist for over 40 years, attended Esperanto congresses, and was a member of the International Patron Committee for the World Esperanto Congress in 1959.

==Personal life==
Szakasits was married to Emma Grosz (1888–1954). They had together a son, György (1916–1985) and a daughter, Klára (1918–2001). After the death of his first wife, he remarried. His second wife was Maria Theresia Schneider. This marriage was childless.

His daughter Klára was the grandmother of Hungarian politician, András Schiffer, the founder and onetime leader of the Politics Can Be Different political party.

<text>Dickinson High School is a public high school located in Dickinson, North Dakota. It currently serves about 1,060 students and is a part of the Dickinson Public Schools system. The official school colors are orange and black and the athletic teams are known as the Midgets.

DHS educates an average of 1,000 students in grades nine through twelve each year, and employs 60 certified teachers and 35 classified staff members. DHS offers 328 different courses in a variety of subjects, as well as Advanced Placement courses and college dual-credit courses.

==History==

In 1909 the community built Central High School, a two-story structure of 12 classrooms. The first floor contained the library and assembly hall, and the basement served as the gym. Central High possessed the latest in technological marvels when electric lights were installed in 1910. The school stood on the southwest corner of the school block where P.S. Berg Elementary stands today.

By the mid-1930s Dickinson&#x27;s schools suffered from overcrowding. The school board felt it was time to build a new high school, but, despite information presented to the public, the city voted against the $100,000 bond issue necessary for construction. However, the school board applied for assistance from the Public Works Administration to build the high school and adjoining athletic field. Additions were made to this new Central High School in 1950. Central High School became increasingly more crowded and as the Model High at Dickinson State College closed in 1963, the need for a new high school was evident. The State Department of Vocational Education agreed to help with construction.
In March 1966, voters approved the $1,525,000 bond issue for construction. The new high school, Dickinson High School, was designated as one of the two area vocational high schools in North Dakota. Several outbuildings and a new auditorium were added over the years.

The 1981–1982 school year saw the largest student enrollment in the district&#x27;s history, with 1,041 students in the high school. The former Central High became A.L. Hagen Junior High in 1968, when the new Dickinson High School was built on Empire Road north of town.

In 1994, Dickinson adopted the block scheduling system, in which students attend only four courses a day, each 90 minutes long, enabling them to earn more class credits than in other schools (which traditionally mandate seven courses per day). They have recently added the &quot;opportunity period,&quot; which allows a 30-minute period for lunch. In this time the students can work on homework, tests, or whatever the teacher assigns. This takes place three days a week and freshmen are required to attend. If the other classes do not need the extra help, they get an extended lunch.

===Mascot controversy===
There has been controversy surrounding Dickinson&#x27;s mascot, the Midget. In the mid-1990s the school became concerned that their 80-year-old mascot was not politically correct and communicated that they were considering a change. In 1996, the school board voted to change the mascot. Residents of Dickinson were angry at the decision and recalled at least three of the board members. A South Dakota school changed its nickname from Midget to Mustangs by request of the Little People of America, but Dickinson refused a change. In 2010, the school board&#x27;s president, Dean Rummel, brought up the issue again, but the board decided not to address it. In 2019, the Little People of America came to Dickinson to request again that the school consider changing the mascot. The school board directed the school district administration to collect feedback from the community about the change. A resulting survey found that 35% of the community supported the change, while 65% opposed it. , the name has not been changed, with no plans to change it and the mascot still visible on the school website. According to the Little People of America, as of July 2021, Dickinson was one of five schools in the United States still using a midget mascot.

<doc id="831103" wikidata="Q469664" url="?curid=831103" title="Henrietta Szold">
<text>Henrietta Szold ( , ; December 21, 1860 – February 13, 1945) was an American-born Jewish Zionist leader and founder of Hadassah, the Women&#x27;s Zionist Organization of America. In 1942, she co-founded Ihud, a political party in Mandatory Palestine dedicated to a binational solution.

==Biography==
Henrietta Szold was born in Baltimore, Maryland, December 21, 1860. She was the daughter of Rabbi Benjamin Szold of Hungarian birth, who was the spiritual leader of Baltimore&#x27;s Temple Oheb Shalom. She was the eldest of eight daughters, and her younger sister Adele Szold-Seltzer was the translator of the first American edition of &quot;Maya the Bee&quot;.

In 1877, Henrietta Szold graduated from Western High School. For fifteen years she taught at Miss Adam&#x27;s School and Oheb Shalom religious school, and gave Bible and history courses for adults. Highly educated in Jewish studies, she edited Professor Marcus Jastrow&#x27;s Talmudic Dictionary. To further her own education, she attended public lectures at Johns Hopkins University and the Peabody Institute.

In 1902, Szold took classes in advanced Jewish studies at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. However, its rabbinic school was restricted to males. Szold begged the school&#x27;s president, Solomon Schechter, to allow her to study; he did only with the provision that she not seek ordination. Szold did well at the seminary, earning the respect of other students and faculty alike.

Szold never married and never had children of her own. While she was in her forties, she had an unrequited relationship with Talmudic scholar Rabbi Louis Ginzberg. He was fifteen years her junior, and he returned her feelings only platonically. After their relationship ended, she expressed her sadness: &quot;Today it is four weeks since my only real happiness was killed.&quot; Years afterward, she said: &quot;I would exchange everything for one child of my own.&quot;

Szold was the oldest of eight daughters and had no brothers. In Orthodox Judaism, it was not the norm for women to recite the Mourners″ Kaddish. In 1916, Szold&#x27;s mother died, and a friend, Hayim Peretz, offered to say Kaddish for her. In a letter, she thanked Peretz for his concern but said she would do it herself.

&quot;I know well, and appreciate what you say about the Jewish custom; and Jewish custom is very dear and sacred to me. And yet I cannot ask you to say Kaddish after my mother. The Kaddish means to me that the survivor publicly and markedly manifests his wish and intention to assume the relation to the Jewish community, which his parent had, and that so the chain of tradition remains unbroken from generation to generation, each adding its own link. You can do that for the generations of your family, I must do that for the generations of my family.&quot;

Szold&#x27;s answer to Peretz is cited by &quot;Women and the Mourners&#x27; Kaddish,&quot; a responsum written by Conservative Rabbi David Golinkin. This responsum, adopted unanimously by Conservative Judaism&#x27;s Va&#x27;ad Halakhah (Law Committee) of the Rabbinical Assembly of Israel, permits women to recite the Mourners&#x27; Kaddish in public when a minyan is present. Szold was religiously traditional, but advocated a larger role for women in Rabbinic Judaism.

==Pedagogic career and Zionist activism==
Szold established the first American night school to provide English language instruction and vocational skills for Russian Jewish immigrants in Baltimore. Beginning in 1893, she worked as the first editor for the Jewish Publication Society, a position she retained for over 23 years. &quot;The sole woman at the JPS, Szold&#x27;s duties included the translation of a dozen works, writing articles of her own, editing the books, and overseeing the publication schedule.

In 1896, one month before Theodor Herzl published &quot;Der Judenstaat&quot; (&quot;The Jewish State&quot;), Szold described her vision of a Jewish state in Palestine as a place to ingather Diaspora Jewry and revive Jewish culture. In 1898, the Federation of American Zionists elected Szold as the only female member of its executive committee. During World War I, she was the only woman on the Provisional Executive Committee for General Zionist Affairs.

In 1899, she took on the lion&#x27;s share of producing the first &quot;American Jewish Year Book&quot;, of which she was sole editor from 1904 to 1908. She also collaborated in the compilation of the &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;.

==Health, education and welfare==
Her commitment to Zionism was heightened by a trip to Palestine in 1909, at age 49. Here, she discovered her life&#x27;s mission: the health, education and welfare of the Yishuv (pre-state Jewish community of Palestine). Szold joined six other women to found Hadassah, which recruited American Jewish women to upgrade health care in Palestine. Hadassah&#x27;s first project was the inauguration of an American-style visiting nurse program in Jerusalem. Hadassah funded hospitals, a medical school, dental facilities, x-ray clinics, infant welfare stations, soup kitchens and other services for Palestine&#x27;s Jewish and Arab inhabitants. Szold persuaded her colleagues that practical programs open to all were critical to Jewish survival in the Holy Land. She founded Hadassah in 1912 and served as its president until 1926. 

In 1933, she immigrated to Palestine and helped run Youth Aliyah, an organization that rescued 30,000 Jewish children from Nazi Europe.
In October 1934, Szold laid the cornerstone of the new Rothschild-Hadassah-University Hospital on Mount Scopus. 
==Political activism==
In the 1920s and 1930s, she supported Brit Shalom, a small organization dedicated to Arab-Jewish unity and a binational solution. In 1942, she was one of the co-founders of the Ihud party.

==Death and burial==
On February 13, 1945, at age 84, Henrietta Szold died in the same Hadassah Hospital she helped to build in Jerusalem. She was buried in the Jewish Cemetery on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. From 1948 to 1967, the Mount of Olives was cut off from the rest of Jerusalem by the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine and the 1949 Armistice Agreements.

After Israel regained the region in the Six-Day War, Kalman Mann, then-director general of Hadassah Medical Center, went with a group of rabbis to the cemetery to assess the condition of Szold&#x27;s grave. They found that it had been paved over by a road built by the Jordanians, who had also vandalized many grave markers.

They were able to locate Szold&#x27;s burial site using a cemetery chart and &quot;counting the indentations in the ground&quot;. The grave was later rebuilt and remarked with a new stone marker in an official ceremony.

==Awards and recognition==
Kibbutz Kfar Szold, in Upper Galilee is named after her. The Palmach, in recognition of her commitment to &quot;Aliyat Hanoar&quot; Youth Aliyah, named the illegal immigration (Ha&#x27;apalah) ship &quot;Henrietta Szold&quot; after her. The ship, carrying immigrants from the Kiffisia orphanage in Athens, sailed from Piraeus on July 30, 1946, with 536 immigrants on board, and arrived on August 12, 1946. The passengers resisted capture, but were transferred to transport for Cyprus.

In 1949, Hadassah inaugurated the Henrietta Szold Prize, which was awarded that year to Eleanor Roosevelt.

The Henrietta Szold Institute, National Institute for Research in the Behavioral Sciences, located in Jerusalem, is named after her. The institute is Israel&#x27;s foremost planner of behavioral science intervention and training programs.

Public School 134 on Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side in New York City is also named after her.

In Israel, Mother&#x27;s Day is celebrated on the day that Szold died, on the 30th of Shevat.

In the northwest corner of Szold&#x27;s home city of Baltimore, Szold Drive, a short street in a residential neighborhood with homes built in the 1950s, is named after her as well. The northernmost part of the street is in Baltimore County.

In New York City, Szold Place, formerly Dry Dock Street runs from East 10th Street to East 12th Street in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan.

In 2007, Szold was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, New York.

<doc id="831137" wikidata="Q6601533" url="?curid=831137" title="List of United Kingdom by-elections (1979–2010)">
<text>There were 131 parliamentary by-elections in the United Kingdom between the 1979 and 2010 general elections. In the list below, the names of the incumbent and victor and their respective parties are given. Where seats changed political party at the election, the result is highlighted: blue for a Conservative gain, red for a Labour gain, yellow for an SNP gain, orange for a Liberal, Social Democratic Party or Liberal Democrat gain and other colours for other gains.

==Resignations==
Where the cause of by-election is given as &quot;resignation&quot; or &quot;seeks re-election&quot;, this indicates that the incumbent was appointed on his or her own request to an &quot;office of profit under the Crown&quot;, either the Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds or the Steward of the Manor of Northstead. Accepting an office of profit under the Crown vacates the member&#x27;s seat. This process is used because members of the House of Commons are not technically permitted to resign. A member who resigns in this manner may stand for re-election.

==By-elections==

===2005–2010 Parliament===
There were 14 by-elections in the 2005–2010 Parliament. Eight were in seats held by the governing Labour party, three by the Conservatives, one by the Liberal Democrats, one by an independent and one by the speaker. Eight by-elections were won by the incumbent party, including in Haltemprice and Howden where Conservative David Davis resigned to recontest his seat. Meanwhile, Blaenau Gwent was won by a second independent candidate. Labour lost four seats; two to the Conservatives, one to the Liberal Democrats and one to the SNP. The speaker&#x27;s seat was regained by Labour, the party speaker Michael Martin represented before he took up the position in a previous constituency. Eight by-elections were a result of the death of the incumbent MP - five Labour MPs died, along with one Liberal Democrat, one Conservative and independent MP Peter Law.

At the dissolution of Parliament in 2010 there were three vacancies: North West Leicestershire and Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, caused by the death of their respective Labour members David Taylor and Ashok Kumar; and Strangford caused by the resignation of the DUP&#x27;s Iris Robinson. With the close proximity of the 2010 general election, by-elections were not held in these seats. Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland and Strangford were held by Tom Blenkinsop and Jim Shannon respectively, but North West Leicestershire was won by Conservative Andrew Bridgen.


===2001–2005 Parliament===
There were six by-elections in the 2001–2005 Parliament. Each were in seats held by the governing Labour party, four of which were held and two won by the Liberal Democrats. Four by-elections were a result of the death of the incumbent MP.


===1997–2001 Parliament===
There were 17 by-elections in the 1997–2001 Parliament. Eight were in seats held by the governing Labour party, five by the Conservatives, one by the Liberal Democrats, one by Plaid Cymru, one by the Ulster Unionist Party and one by the speaker. 14 by-elections were won by the incumbent party. The Conservatives lost one seat to the Liberal Democrats, and the Democratic Unionist Party gained South Antrim from the Ulster Unionists. The speaker&#x27;s seat was regained by Labour, the party speaker Betty Boothroyd represented before she took up the position. Ten by-elections were a result of the death of the incumbent MP; six were Labour, three Conservative and one was the Ulster Unionist MP Clifford Forsythe.

===1992–1997 Parliament===
There were 18 by-elections in the 1992–1997 Parliament. Eight were in seats held by the governing Conservative party, nine by Labour and one by the Ulster Popular Unionist Party.

The Conservatives lost all eight seats in the by-elections - four to the Liberal Democrats, three to Labour and one to the SNP. The UK Unionist Party gained North Down from the Ulster Popular Unionists. 16 by-elections were a result of the death of the incumbent MP - eight Conservatives died, along with seven Labour MPs and the Ulster Popular Unionist MP Sir James Kilfedder.

At the dissolution of Parliament in 1997 there were two vacancies: Meriden, caused by the death of its Conservative member Iain Mills, and Don Valley, caused by the death of its Labour member Martin Redmond. With the close proximity of the 1997 general election, by-elections were not held in these seats. They were held by Caroline Spelman and Caroline Flint respectively.

===1987–1992 Parliament===
There were 24 by-elections in the 1987–1992 Parliament. Ten were in seats held by the governing Conservative party, 13 by Labour and one by the Ulster Unionist Party. 16 by-elections were won by the incumbent party. Labour lost one seat to the SNP, and the Conservatives lost seven seats; four to Labour and three to the Liberal Democrats. 20 by-elections were a result of the death of the incumbent MP - 11 Labour MPs died, along with eight Conservatives and Ulster Unionist Harold McCusker.

===1983–1987 Parliament===
There were 31 by-elections in the 1983–1987 Parliament. Nine were in seats held by the governing Conservative party, six by Labour and one by the Liberals. The remaining 15 were in Northern Ireland, involving the province&#x27;s own political parties. 25 by-elections were won by the incumbent party, including all in Northern Ireland except one. The Conservatives lost five seats; one to Labour, two to the Liberals, and two to the Social Democrats. The Ulster Unionists lost one seat to the Social Democratic and Labour Party. 11 by-elections were the result of the death of the incumbent MP; seven were Conservatives, three Labour and one Liberal.

===1979–1983 Parliament===
There were 20 by-elections in the 1979–1983 Parliament. Seven were in seats held by the governing Conservative party, ten by Labour, one by the Ulster Unionists and two (in the same seat) by Irish republican parties, who do not take up their seats in the House of Commons. 13 by-elections were won by the incumbent party. The Conservatives lost four seats: one to Labour, one to the Liberals and two to the Social Democrats, and Labour lost two seats: one to the Liberals and one to the Conservatives. Meanwhile, the seat of Fermanagh and South Tyrone was won from the Independent Republican Party by Anti H-Block, a branch of Sinn Féin. 15 by-elections were a result of the death of the incumbent MP; six were Conservatives, six Labour, and the others were the Ulster Unionist Robert Bradford, the Independent Republican Frank Maguire and the Anti H-Block member Bobby Sands (who was in prison).

<text>First Growth () status is a classification of wines primarily from the Bordeaux region of France. 

The wines considered “best of the best” are assigned the rank of Premier Cru, with only five wines, Château Lafite Rothschild, Château Margaux, Château Haut-Brion, Château Latour, and Château Mouton Rothschild rated “First Growth”.

== History ==

===Bordeaux reds===
The need for a classification of the best Bordeaux wines arose from the 1855 Exposition Universelle de Paris. The result was the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855, a list of the top ranked wines, named the Grand Crus Classés (Great Classified Growths). With several thousand Chateaux producing their wines in Bordeaux, to be classified was to carry a mark of high prestige.

Within the Grand Cru Classé list, wines were further ranked and placed in one of five divisions. The best of the best wines were assigned the highest rank of Premier Cru; only four wines, Château Latour, Château Lafite Rothschild, Château Margaux and Château Haut-Brion were deemed worthy. Of all the 61 great classified wines, all but one came from the Médoc region. The exception was the premier cru Château Haut-Brion, produced in Graves.

The 1855 list remained unchanged for over a hundred years until finally Mouton Rothschild was promoted to Premier Cru status in 1973, after decades of relentless lobbying by its powerful owner, Baron Philippe de Rothschild. Of lesser importance, in 1988 the premier cru Château Haut-Brion was changed in appellation from Graves to Pessac-Leognan to represent apparent changes in soil structure caused by the urbanisation of areas surrounding Bordeaux.

===Bordeaux sweet wines===
Also in 1855, 21 of the best sweet wines from Bordeaux were classified as Grand Crus Classés in a separate list. In the original classification, nine wines (primarily from the Sauternes and Barsac regions) were classed as &quot;Premier Cru&quot;, while 11 were assigned the lower (though still prestigious) rank of &quot;Deuxième Cru&quot; (Second Growth). One wine (Château d&#x27;Yquem) was considered so great it was granted a special &quot;Premier Cru Supérieur&quot; classification.

===Other classification schemes in Bordeaux===
With the exception of Château Haut-Brion from Graves, the 1855 Classification did not include producers in the regions of Graves, Saint-Émilion and Pomerol. For details on their own classification schemes, see their sections below.

===Other classification schemes in France===

Burgundy maintains its own classification scheme based on specific appellations. Although the terminology used is similar, the classification hierarchy is different and also attaches to the vineyards themselves. The most-highly rated vineyards are graded as Grand Cru, while those at the next level are classified as Premier Cru.

==First Growth wines today==

===Bordeaux reds===

====&quot;Premier Grand Cru&quot;====
* Château Lafite Rothschild Médoc (Pauillac)
* Château Margaux Médoc (Margaux)
* Château Latour Médoc (Pauillac)
* Château Haut-Brion Graves (Pessac-Leognan)
* Château Mouton-Rothschild Médoc (Pauillac)

===Bordeaux sweet wines===

====&quot;Premier Cru Supérieur&quot;====
* Château d&#x27;Yquem (Sauternes)

====&quot;Premier Cru&quot;====
* Château La Tour Blanche, Bommes (Sauternes)
* Château Lafaurie-Peyraguey, Bommes (Sauternes)
* Château Clos Haut-Peyraguey, Bommes (Sauternes)
* Château de Rayne-Vigneau, Bommes (Sauternes)
* Château Suduiraut, Preignac (Sauternes)

* Château Guiraud, Sauternes
* Château Rieussec, Fargues (Sauternes)
* Château Rabaud-Promis, Bommes (Sauternes)
* Château Sigalas-Rabaud, Bommes (Sauternes)

The communes of Bommes, Fargues and Preignac were once separate communes but now fall into the single commune of Sauternes.

==The Graves classification==
After the Second World War the omission of wines of Graves from the official classification was having a negative effect on the price and desirability of wines from the region. To improve marketing the region announced in 1953 its own classification of red wines and one white wine, with more white wines added in 1959. Sixteen wines were given special classification.
* Château Bouscaut (red &amp; white)
* Château Carbonnieux (red &amp; white)
* Château Couhins (white)
* Château Couhins-Lurton (white)
* Domaine de Chevalier (red &amp; white)
* Château de Fieuzal (red)
* Château Haut-Bailly (red)
* Château Haut-Brion (red)
* Château La Mission Haut-Brion (red)
* Château La Tour Haut-Brion (red)
* Château Latour-Martillac (red &amp; white)
* Château Laville Haut-Brion (white)
* Château Malartic-Lagravière (red &amp; white)
* Château Olivier (red &amp; white)
* Château Pape Clément (red)
* Château Smith Haut Lafitte (red)

==The Saint-Émilion classification==

Missing from the 1855 list, the Bordeaux region of Saint-Émilion offered its own classification in 1955 to improve market demand and prices. The Classification of Saint-Émilion wine differs from the 1855 list in that it is updated approximately every ten years based on new assessments of quality. For each new release of the classification, wines may be promoted or demoted within the list. A wine may even be removed entirely, while other unclassified wines may be added. In 2006, for example, eleven wines were removed from the list, six new wines added, and two existing wines promoted to a higher division.

The Saint-Émilion Classification currently labels 15 wines as First Growths. These &quot;Premiers Grands Crus Classés&quot;, subdivided into two further classes : &quot;A&quot; (2 wines) and &quot;B&quot; (13 wines). A further 64 wines are currently classified as &quot;Grands Crus Classés&quot;.

===Premiers Grands Crus Classés A===
* Château Figeac
* Château Pavie

===Premiers Grands Crus Classés B===
* Château Beauséjour (Duffau-Lagarrosse)
* Château Beau-Séjour Bécot
* Château Bélair-Monange
* Château Canon
* Château Canon-la-Gaffelière
* Château Figeac
* Clos Fourtet
* Château Larcis Ducasse
* Château La Gaffelière
* Château Magdelaine
* Château Pavie-Macquin
* Château Troplong Mondot
* Château Trottevieille

=== Former Premier Crus Classés ===

* Château Angélus
* Château Ausone
* Château Cheval Blanc

==Pomerol==

Pomerol has refused to create any sort of classification scheme but it has produced red wines that are among the most expensive in the world, such as Petrus.

<text>The Sloan Digital Sky Survey or SDSS is a major multi-spectral imaging and spectroscopic redshift survey using a dedicated 2.5-m wide-angle optical telescope at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, United States. The project began in 2000 and was named after the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, which contributed significant funding.

A consortium of the University of Washington and Princeton University was established to conduct a redshift survey. The Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC) was established in 1984 with the additional participation of New Mexico State University and Washington State University to manage activities at Apache Point. In 1991, the Sloan Foundation granted the ARC funding for survey efforts and the construction of equipment to carry out the work.

==Background==
At the time of its design, the SDSS was a pioneering combination of novel instrumentation as well as data reduction and storage techniques that drove major advances in astronomical observations, discoveries, and theory. 

The SDSS project was centered around two instruments and data processing pipelines that were groundbreaking for the scale at which they were implemented: 
# A multi-filter/multi-array scanning CCD camera to take an imaging survey of the sky at high efficiency, followed by
# A multi-object/multi-fiber spectrograph that could take spectra in bulk (several hundred objects at a time) of targets identified from the survey 

A major new challenge was how to deal with the exceptional data volume generated by the telescope and instruments. At the time, hundreds of gigabytes of raw data per night was unprecedented, and a collaborating team as complex as the original hardware and engineering team was needed to design a software and storage system for processing the data. From each imaging run, object catalogs, reduced images, and associated files were produced in a highly automated pipeline, yielding the largest astronomical object catalogs (billions of objects) available in digital queryable form at the time. For each spectral run, thousands of two-dimensional spectral images had to be processed to automatically extract calibrated spectra (flux versus wavelength). 

In the approximate decade it took to achieve these goals, SDSS contributed to notable advances in massive database storage and accessing technology, such as SQL, and was one of the first major astronomical projects to make data available in this form. The model of giving the scientific community and public broad and internet-accessible access to the survey data products was also relatively new at the time. 

The collaboration model around the project was also complex but successful, given the large numbers of institutions and individuals needed to bring expertise to the system. Universities and foundations were participants along with the managing partner ARC. Other participants included Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab), which supplied computer processing and storage capabilities, and colleagues from the computing industry.

==Operation==
Data collection began in 2000; the final imaging data release (DR9) covers over 35% of the sky, with photometric observations of around nearly 1 billion objects, while the survey continues to acquire spectra, having so far taken spectra of over 4 million objects. The main galaxy sample has a median redshift of &quot;z&quot; = 0.1; there are redshifts for luminous red galaxies as far as &quot;z&quot; = 0.7, and for quasars as far as &quot;z&quot; = 5; and the imaging survey has been involved in the detection of quasars beyond a redshift &quot;z&quot; = 6.

Data release 8 (DR8), released in January 2011, includes all photometric observations taken with the SDSS imaging camera, covering 14,555 square degrees on the sky (just over 35% of the full sky). Data release 9 (DR9), released to the public on 31 July 2012, includes the first results from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), including over 800,000 new spectra. Over 500,000 of the new spectra are of objects in the Universe 7 billion years ago (roughly half the age of the universe). Data release 10 (DR10), released to the public on 31 July 2013, includes all data from previous releases, plus the first results from the APO Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), including over 57,000 high-resolution infrared spectra of stars in the Milky Way. DR10 also includes over 670,000 new BOSS spectra of galaxies and quasars in the distant universe. The publicly available images from the survey were made between 1998 and 2009.

In July 2020, after a 20-year-long survey, astrophysicists of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey published the largest, most detailed 3D map of the universe so far, filled a gap of 11 billion years in its expansion history, and provided data which supports the theory of a flat geometry of the universe and confirms that different regions seem to be expanding at different speeds.

== Observations ==
SDSS uses a dedicated 2.5 m wide-angle optical telescope; from 1998 to 2009 it observed in both imaging and spectroscopic modes. The imaging camera was retired in late 2009, since then the telescope has observed entirely in spectroscopic mode.

Images were taken using a photometric system of five filters (named &quot;u&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;i&quot; and &quot;z&quot;). These images are processed to produce lists of objects observed and various parameters, such as whether they seem pointlike or extended (as a galaxy might) and how the brightness on the CCDs relates to various kinds of astronomical magnitude.

For imaging observations, the SDSS telescope used the drift scanning technique, but with a choreographed variation of right ascension, declination, tracking rate, and image rotation which allows the telescope to track along great circles and continuously record small strips of the sky. The image of the stars in the focal plane drifts along the CCD chip, and the charge is electronically shifted along the detectors at the same rate, instead of staying fixed as in tracked telescopes. (Simply parking the telescope as the sky moves is only workable on the celestial equator, since stars at different declination move at different apparent speeds). This method allows consistent astrometry over the widest possible field and minimises overheads from reading out the detectors. The disadvantage is minor distortion effects.

The telescope&#x27;s imaging camera is made up of 30 CCD chips, each with a resolution of pixels, totaling approximately 120 megapixels. The chips are arranged in 5 rows of 6 chips. Each row has a different optical filter with average wavelengths of 355.1 (&quot;u&quot;), 468.6 (&quot;g&quot;), 616.5 (&quot;r&quot;), 748.1 (&quot;i&quot;), and 893.1 (&quot;z&quot;)nm, with 95% completeness in typical seeing to magnitudes of 22.0, 22.2, 22.2, 21.3, and 20.5, for &quot;u&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;z&quot; respectively. The filters are placed on the camera in the order &quot;r&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, &quot;g&quot;. To reduce noise, the camera is cooled to 190 kelvins (about −80°C) by liquid nitrogen.

Using these photometric data, stars, galaxies, and quasars are also selected for spectroscopy. The spectrograph operates by feeding an individual optical fibre for each target through a hole drilled in an aluminum plate. Each hole is positioned specifically for a selected target, so every field in which spectra are to be acquired requires a unique plate. The original spectrograph attached to the telescope was capable of recording 640 spectra simultaneously, while the updated spectrograph for SDSSIII can record 1000 spectra at once. Throughout each night, between six and nine plates are typically used for recording spectra. In spectroscopic mode, the telescope tracks the sky in the standard way, keeping the objects focused on their corresponding fiber tips.

Every night the telescope produces about 200GB of data.

== Phases ==
=== SDSS-I: 2000–2005 ===
During its first phase of operations, 2000–2005, the SDSS imaged more than 8,000 square degrees of the sky in five optical bandpasses, and it obtained spectra of galaxies and quasars selected from 5,700 square degrees of that imaging. It also obtained repeated imaging (roughly 30 scans) of a 300 square-degree stripe in the southern Galactic cap.

=== SDSS-II: 2005–2008 ===
In 2005 the survey entered a new phase, the SDSS-II, by extending the observations to explore the structure and stellar makeup of the Milky Way, the SEGUE and the Sloan Supernova Survey, which watches after supernova Ia events to measure the distances to far objects.

==== Sloan Legacy Survey ====
The Sloan Legacy Survey covers over 7,500 square degrees of the Northern Galactic Cap with data from nearly 2 million objects and spectra from over 800,000 galaxies and 100,000 quasars. The information on the position and distance of the objects has allowed the large-scale structure of the Universe, with its voids and filaments, to be investigated for the first time. Almost all of these data were obtained in SDSS-I, but a small part of the footprint was finished in SDSS-II.

==== Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE) ====
The Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration obtained spectra of 240,000 stars (with a typical radial velocity of 10 km/s) to create a detailed three-dimensional map of the Milky Way. SEGUE data provide evidence for the age, composition and phase space distribution of stars within the various Galactic components, providing crucial clues for understanding the structure, formation and evolution of our galaxy.

The stellar spectra, imaging data, and derived parameter catalogs for this survey are publicly available as part of SDSS Data Release 7 (DR7).

==== Sloan Supernova Survey ====
The SDSS Supernova Survey, which ran from 2005 to 2008, performed repeat imaging of one stripe of sky 2.5° wide centered on the celestial equator, going from 20 hours right ascension to 4 hours RA so that it was in the southern galactic cap (see Draft:Galactic cap) and did not suffer from galactic extinction. The project discovered more than 500 type Ia supernovae, Running until the end of the year 2007, the Supernova Survey searched for Type Ia supernovae. The survey rapidly scanned a 300 square degree area to detect variable objects and supernovae. It detected 130 confirmed supernovae Ia events in 2005 and a further 197 in 2006. In 2014 an even larger catalogue was released containing 10,258 variable and transient sources. Of these, 4,607 sources are either confirmed or likely supernovae, which makes this the largest set of supernovae so far compiled.

=== SDSS III: 2008–2014 ===

In mid-2008, SDSS-III was started. It comprised four separate surveys:

==== APO Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) ====
The APO Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) used high-resolution, high signal-to-noise infrared spectroscopy to penetrate the dust that obscures the inner Galaxy. APOGEE surveyed 100,000 red giant stars across the full range of the galactic bulge, bar, disk, and halo. It increased the number of stars observed at high spectroscopic resolution (R ≈ 20,000 at λ ≈ 1.6μm) and high signal-to-noise ratio () by more than a factor of 100. The high-resolution spectra revealed the abundances of about 15 elements, giving information on the composition of the gas clouds the red giants formed from. APOGEE planned to collect data from 2011 to 2014, with the first data released as part of SDSS DR10 in late 2013.

==== Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) ====
The SDSS-III&#x27;s Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) was designed to measure the expansion rate of the Universe. It mapped the spatial distribution of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and quasars to determine their spatial distribution and detect the characteristic scale imprinted by baryon acoustic oscillations in the early universe. Sound waves that propagate in the early universe, like spreading ripples in a pond, imprint a characteristic scale on the positions of galaxies relative to each other. It was announced that BOSS had measured the scale of the universe to an accuracy of one percent, and was completed in Spring 2014.

==== Multi-object APO Radial Velocity Exoplanet Large-area Survey (MARVELS) ====

The Multi-object APO Radial Velocity Exoplanet Large-area Survey (MARVELS) monitored the radial velocities of 11,000 bright stars, with the precision and cadence needed to detect gas giant planets that have orbital periods ranging from several hours to two years. This ground-based Doppler survey used the SDSS telescope and new multi-object Doppler instruments to monitor radial velocities.

The main goal of the project was to generate a large-scale, statistically well-defined sample of giant planets. It searched for gaseous planets having orbital periods ranging from hours to 2 years and masses between 0.5 and 10 times that of Jupiter. A total of 11,000 stars were analyzed with 25–35 observations per star over 18 months. It was expected to detect between 150 and 200 new exoplanets, and was able to study rare systems, such as planets with extreme eccentricity, and objects in the &quot;brown dwarf desert&quot;.

The collected data was used as a statistical sample for the theoretical comparison and discovery of rare systems. The project started in the fall of 2008, and continued until spring 2014.

==== SEGUE-2 ====
The original Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE-1) obtained spectra of nearly 240,000 stars of a range of spectral types. Building on this success, SEGUE-2 spectroscopically observed around 120,000 stars, focusing on the in situ stellar halo of the Milky Way, from distances of 10 to 60kpc. SEGUE-2 doubled the sample size of SEGUE-1.

Combining SEGUE-1 and 2 revealed the complex kinematic and chemical substructure of the galactic halo and disks, providing essential clues to the assembly and enrichment history of the galaxy. In particular, the outer halo was expected to be dominated by late-time accretion events. SEGUE data can help constrain existing models for the formation of the stellar halo and inform the next generation of high-resolution simulations of galaxy formation. In addition, SEGUE-1 and SEGUE-2 may help uncover rare, chemically primitive stars that are fossils of the earliest generations of cosmic star formation.

=== SDSS IV: 2014–2020 ===

The fourth generation of the SDSS (SDSS-IV, 2014–2020) is extending precision cosmological measurements to a critical early phase of cosmic history (eBOSS), expanding its infrared spectroscopic survey of the Galaxy in the northern and southern hemispheres (APOGEE-2), and for the first time using the Sloan spectrographs to make spatially resolved maps of individual galaxies (MaNGA).

==== APO Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE-2) ====
A stellar survey of the Milky Way, with two major components: a northern survey using the bright time at APO, and a southern survey using the 2.5m Du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas.

==== Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) ====
A cosmological survey of quasars and galaxies, also encompassing subprograms to survey variable objects (TDSS) and X-ray sources (SPIDERS).

==== Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) ====

MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory), explored the detailed internal structure of nearly 10,000 nearby galaxies 
from 2014 to the spring of 2020. Earlier SDSS surveys only allowed spectra to be observed from the center of galaxies. By using two-dimensional arrays of optical fibers bundled together into a hexagonal shape, MaNGA was able to use spatially resolved spectroscopy to construct maps of the areas within galaxies, allowing deeper analysis of their structure, such as radial velocities and star formation regions.

=== SDSS-V: 2020–current ===
Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico began to gather data for SDSS-V in October 2020. Apache Point is scheduled to be converted by mid-2021 from plug plates (aluminum plates with manually-placed holes for starlight to shine through) to small automated robot arms, with Las Campanas Observatory in Chile following later in the year. The Milky Way Mapper survey will target the spectra of six million stars. The Black Hole Mapper survey will target galaxies to indirectly analyze their supermassive black holes. The Local Volume Mapper will target nearby galaxies to analyze their clouds of interstellar gas.

== Data access ==
The survey makes the data releases available over the Internet. The SkyServer provides a range of interfaces to an underlying Microsoft SQL Server. Both spectra and images are available in this way, and interfaces are made very easy to use so that, for example, a full-color image of any region of the sky covered by an SDSS data release can be obtained just by providing the coordinates. The data are available for non-commercial use only, without written permission. The SkyServer also provides a range of tutorials aimed at everyone from schoolchildren up to professional astronomers. The tenth major data release, DR10, released in July 2013, provides images, imaging catalogs, spectra, and redshifts via a variety of search interfaces.

The raw data (from before being processed into databases of objects) are also available through another Internet server and first experienced as a &#x27;fly-through&#x27; via the NASA World Wind program. 

Sky in Google Earth includes data from the SDSS, for those regions where such data are available. There are also KML plugins for SDSS photometry and spectroscopy layers, allowing direct access to SkyServer data from within Google Sky.

The data is also available on Hayden Planetarium with a 3D visualizer.

There is also the ever-growing list of data for the Stripe 82 region of the SDSS.

Following Technical Fellow Jim Gray&#x27;s contribution on behalf of Microsoft Research with the SkyServer project, Microsoft&#x27;s WorldWide Telescope makes use of SDSS and other data sources.

MilkyWay@home also used SDSS&#x27;s data to create a highly accurate three-dimensional model of the Milky Way galaxy.

== Results ==

Along with publications describing the survey itself, SDSS data have been used in publications over a huge range of astronomical topics. The SDSS website has a full list of these publications covering distant quasars at the limits of the observable universe, the distribution of galaxies, the properties of stars in our galaxy and also subjects such as dark matter and dark energy in the universe.

=== Maps ===
Based on the release of Data Release 9 a new 3D map of massive galaxies and distant black holes was published on August 8, 2012.

<text>The Marxist Forward Bloc is a political party in India, a splinter group of the All India Forward Bloc. The MFB was formed in 1953 as Satyapriya Banerjee, a member of the AIFB Central Secretariat, Amar Bose, Suhurit Chaudhury and Ram Chatterji were expelled from AIFB. At its foundation, Satyapriya Banerjee was the party&#x27;s general secretary and Amar Bose its chairman.

The MFB is part of the Left Front and has been associated with the combined left movement since its inception. Its leader Ram Chatterjee was a minister in the West Bengal Left Front government for several years. Later the MFB was led by Pratim Chatterjee, who served in the West Bengal government as Minister of Fire Services in the Left Front cabinet. Chatterjee represented the Tarakeswar seat from 1996 in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly till 2011, when he lost to Rachhpal Singh of the TMC.

In West Bengal Assembly elections till 2011, the MFB contested the seats for Tarakeswar in Hooghly district and Jamalpur in East Burdwan district as a Left Front partner. In the 2006 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election, the party retained both seats as Pratim Chatterjee and Samar Hazra won with good margins. Later in the 2011 election the party lost its representation in the Legislative Assembly when both of the sitting MLAs lost from their respective constituencies.

In the Kolkata municipal polls in 2005, the MFB contested two wards as a Left Front partner. Biren Chakroborty, the secretary of the MFB, was elected from ward number 57.

In the 2008 Panchayet polls, the MFB won seats in Panchayet, Panchayet Samity and ZP levels in Hoogly and Burdwan districts.

In the 2010 municipal polls, the MFB lost its seat in Kolkata corporation. It won a seat each at Rampurhat in Birbhum and Arambagh in Hooghly.

<text>In statistics, the Bhattacharyya distance is a quantity which represents a notion of similarity between two probability distributions. It is closely related to the Bhattacharyya coefficient, which is a measure of the amount of overlap between two statistical samples or populations.

It is not a metric, despite being named a &quot;distance&quot;, since it does not obey the triangle inequality.

== History ==
Both the Bhattacharyya distance and the Bhattacharyya coefficient are named after Anil Kumar Bhattacharyya, a statistician who worked in the 1930s at the Indian Statistical Institute. He has developed this through a series of papers. He developed the method to measure the distance between two non-normal distributions and illustrated this with the classical multinomial populations, this work despite being submitted for publication in 1941, appeared almost five years later in Sankhya. Consequently, Professor Bhattacharyya started working toward developing a distance metric for probability distributions that are absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure and published his progress in 1942, at Proceedings of the Indian Science Congress and the final work has appeared in 1943 in the Bulletin of the Calcutta Mathematical Society.

== Definition ==

For probability distributions formula_1 and formula_2 on the same domain formula_3, the Bhattacharyya distance is defined as
:formula_4
where
:formula_5
is the Bhattacharyya coefficient for discrete probability distributions.

For continuous probability distributions, with formula_6 and formula_7 where formula_8 and formula_9 are the probability density functions, the Bhattacharyya coefficient is defined as
:formula_10.

More generally, given two probability measures formula_11 on a measurable space formula_12, let formula_13 be a (sigma finite) measure such that formula_1 and formula_2 are absolutely continuous with respect to formula_13 i.e. such that formula_17, and formula_18 for probability density functions formula_19 with respect to formula_13 defined formula_13-almost everywhere. Such a measure, even such a probability measure, always exists, e.g. formula_22. Then define the Bhattacharyya measure on formula_12 by
:formula_24
It does not depend on the measure formula_13, for if we choose a measure formula_26 such that formula_13 and an other measure choice formula_28 are absolutely continuous i.e. formula_29 and formula_30, then 
:formula_31,
and similarly for formula_2. We then have
:formula_33.
We finally define the Bhattacharyya coefficient
:formula_34. 
By the above, the quantity formula_35 does not depend on formula_13, and by the Cauchy inequality formula_37. Using formula_17, and formula_18, formula_40

=== Gaussian case ===
Let formula_41, formula_42, where formula_43 is the normal distribution with mean formula_26 and variance formula_45; then

:formula_46.

And in general, given two multivariate normal distributions formula_47,
: formula_48,

where formula_49 Note that the first term is a squared Mahalanobis distance.

== Properties ==
formula_50 and formula_51.

formula_52 does not obey the triangle inequality, though the Hellinger distance formula_53 does.

===Bounds on Bayes error===

The Bhattacharyya distance can be used to upper and lower bound the Bayes error rate:

formula_54

where formula_55 and formula_56 is the posterior probability.

== Applications ==
The Bhattacharyya coefficient quantifies the &quot;closeness&quot; of two random statistical samples.

Given two sequences from distributions formula_11, bin them into formula_58 buckets, and let the frequency of samples from formula_1 in bucket formula_60 be formula_61, and similarly for formula_62, then the sample Bhattacharyya coefficient is

:formula_63

which is an estimator of formula_64. The quality of estimation depends on the choice of buckets; too few buckets would overestimate formula_64, while too many would underestimate.

A common task in classification is estimating the separability of classes. Up to a multiplicative factor, the squared Mahalanobis distance is a special case of the Bhattacharyya distance when the two classes are normally distributed with the same variances. When two classes have similar means but significantly different variances, the Mahalanobis distance would be close to zero, while the Bhattacharyya distance would not be.

The Bhattacharyya coefficient is used in the construction of polar codes.

The Bhattacharyya distance is used in feature extraction and selection, image processing, speaker recognition, phone clustering, and in genetics.

<doc id="831289" wikidata="Q222861" url="?curid=831289" title="FC Flora">
<text>FC Flora, commonly known as Flora Tallinn, or simply as Flora, is an Estonian professional football club based in Tallinn that competes in the Meistriliiga, the top flight of Estonian football. The club&#x27;s home ground is Lilleküla Stadium.

Formed in 1990, Flora were founding members of the Meistriliiga, and is one of two clubs which have never been relegated from the Estonian top division, along with Narva Trans. Flora is the first and only Estonian football club to have played in the group stage of a UEFA club competition, having achieved this in the 2021–22 UEFA Europa Conference League season. Flora have won more trophies than any other club in Estonian football, with 35 titles; a record 15 Meistriliiga titles, eight Estonian Cups and a record 12 Estonian Supercups.

Flora is known for playing exclusively with Estonian players as the club&#x27;s transfer policy is to sign players that are native Estonians or who hold Estonian citizenship. The policy is related to Estonian nationalism and to the club&#x27;s overall aim to develop Estonian football and its culture, which was also the basis upon which Flora was established in 1990.

==History==
===Early history (1990–2000)===
Flora was founded on 10 March 1990 by Aivar Pohlak as an effort to revive Estonian football during the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The team was mainly based on players from Lõvid youth team. Flora finished their first season in last place and were relegated. The situation changed after the formation of the Meistriliiga in 1992. After 52 years of the Soviet occupation (Estonian SSR), Estonian clubs could once again play for the Estonian League Championship title. Flora finished the inaugural season of the Meistriliiga in fourth place. After the first season, the league was reformed to run from Autumn to Spring. Flora finished the 1992–93 season as runners-up. In 1993, Roman Ubakivi was appointed as manager. One round before the end of the 1993–94 season, Tevalte, who led the Meistriliiga table at the time, was controversially disqualified over allegations of match fixing. The season ended with Flora and Norma both on equal 36 points. Flora won the championship play-off match 5–2 and was awarded their first league title. The club made their European debut in the 1994–95 UEFA Cup, losing to Odense 0–6 on aggregate in the preliminary round. Flora managed to defend the league title in the 1994–95 season and won the 1994–95 Estonian Cup, defeating Lantana-Marlekor 2–0 in the final.

In January 1996, Teitur Thordarson replaced Ubakivi as manager. Disappointing start in the 1995–96 season left the team in second place. Flora finished the 1996–97 season as runners-up once again. In the 1997–98 season, the club won their first league title under Thordarson. Subsequently, the league format was changed and Flora managed to win another title in the same calendar year. Flora made their debut in the UEFA Champions League for the first time in the 1998–99 season, narrowly losing to Steaua București 4–5 on aggregate in the first qualifying round. The club added another Estonian Cup trophy after defeating Lantana 3–2 in the finals. Since 1999, Meistriliiga adopted the current league format with the season running from Spring to Autumn within a single calendar year. The 1999 season was unsuccessful as Flora placed third. In 2000, Tarmo Rüütli was appointed as manager. Under Rüütli, Flora finished the 2000 season as runners-up behind Levadia, who won the title without a single loss.

===New stadium and a new era (2001–2017)===

In 2001, a new era began for Flora as the club moved to the new Lilleküla Stadium and Rüütli was replaced by Arno Pijpers. Under Pijpers, Flora won three consecutive Meistriliiga titles in 2001, 2002 and 2003. In the 2003 season, Flora won the league without losing a single league match, extending their unbeaten run from the previous season to 37, while Tor Henning Hamre scored a record 39 goals in a season. Pijpers left Flora in September 2004, before the end of the 2004 season, and was replaced by Janno Kivisild. The team failed to defend the league title for another season, finishing in third place.

The 2005 season was unsuccessful as Flora placed fourth, 26 points behind the league champions TVMK. This was the first time Flora didn&#x27;t win a Meistriliiga medal since 1992. After the disappointing season, Kivisild was replaced by Pasi Rautiainen. In the 2006–07 UEFA Cup, Flora defeated Lyn Oslo 1–1 on aggregate on away goals in the first qualifying round, before losing to Brøndby 0–4 on aggregate in the second qualifying round. The club finished the 2006 season in third place and placed second in the 2007 season. Flora also suffered their biggest margin of defeat in the Meistriliiga thus far, losing 0–6 to TVMK in 2007. Flora finished the 2008 season as runners-up, behind Levadia once again, despite amassing 91 points and scoring 113 goals. Tarmo Rüütli returned to Flora for the 2009 season, but failed to lead the club to winning the league, placing fourth. Flora were more successful in the Estonian Cup, winning the trophy in 2008 and 2009.

In 2010, Rüütli was replaced by the former Flora player and Estonia national team record cap holder Martin Reim. Under Reim, rejuvenated Flora ended the reign of Levadia who had won the four previous Meistriliiga titles and won the league in the 2010 season. Flora successfully defended their title in the 2011 season and won the 2010–11 Estonian Cup, defeating Narva Trans 2–0 in the final. Flora finished the 2012 season in third place, behind the champions Nõmme Kalju and Levadia. After the season, Reim left the club and was replaced Marko Lelov in December 2012. Lelov won the 2012–13 Estonian Cup, but was sacked in July 2013 after disappointing results in the league. He was replaced by Norbert Hurt, initially as a caretaker, with position being made permanent later. Flora finished the 2013 season in fourth place and placed third in 2014.

In 2015, Flora celebrated their 25th anniversary by winning their 10th league title in the 34th round of the season. The club also won the 2015–16 Estonian Cup, defeating Sillamäe Kalev 3–0 in extra time in the final. In May 2016, Aivar Pohlak resigned from the club&#x27;s presidency and was succeeded by his son Pelle Pohlak. In the first qualifying round of the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League, Flora lost to Lincoln Red Imps 2–3 on aggregate, after which Hurt resigned and was replaced by Argo Arbeiter. Flora finished the disappointing 2016 season in fourth place. Arbeiter was sacked and in January 2017, Arno Pijpers returned to take over as manager. In the 2017 season, Flora won their 11th Meistriliiga title. In December 2017, it was announced that Pijpers will not continue as manager.

=== Jürgen Henn era (2018–2023) ===

Jürgen Henn was appointed in Pijpers&#x27; place in January 2018. Under Henn, Flora won the 2019 Meistriliiga and advanced through the first qualifying round of Europa League, beating Radnički Niš 4–2 on aggregate. Flora faced Eintracht Frankfurt in the second round which brought a record 8,537 people onto the stands in Tallinn, as Flora narrowly lost 1–2 with Mihkel Ainsalu scoring for the hosts. The second leg saw Flora face the German side at the sold out Waldstadion, where they were again defeated 1–2 in front of a crowd of 48,000. Despite the result, Flora players were celebrated by the Eintracht fans after the final whistle for their impressive performance, with Eintracht manager Adi Hütter labelling the scene as extraordinary and touching. Led by Jürgen Henn, Flora won the treble in 2020 by lifting the 2020 Estonian Supercup, the 2019–20 Estonian Cup and the 2020 Meistriliiga title. The club also advanced to the UEFA Europa League qualifying play-offs, where they lost 1–3 to Dinamo Zagreb on 1 October 2020.Flora became the first Estonian side to advance to a UEFA club competitions group stage when they beat Shamrock Rovers 5–2 on aggregate to qualify for the 2021–22 UEFA Europa Conference League on 26 August 2021, where they were drawn into group B against Gent of Belgium, Partizan of Serbia and Anorthosis Famagusta of Cyprus. The 2–2 draw away against Anorthosis was the first ever point picked up by an Estonian side in UEFA group stage history, with Rauno Sappinen scoring both goals as Flora came from 2–0 down to earn a point in Cyprus. On match day 5, Flora made more history by beating Partizan 1–0 in Tallinn, thanks to a goal from Martin Miller. This result meant that they became the first ever Estonian side to win a game in a UEFA group stage.

After finishing the 2021 Meistriliiga season as runners-up, FC Flora won their 14th Estonian championship title in the 2022 season, earning 97 points and thus repeating Levadia&#x27;s 2009 record of most points in a season. Flora lifted their 15th league title in 2023. On 30 November 2023, Jürgen Henn announced he will be stepping down after six years in charge, marking the end of the longest and most successful managerial tenure in Flora&#x27;s history.

=== Recent history (2024–present) ===
Flora replaced Henn with their sporting director and former manager Norbert Hurt, under whom the club started the 2024 season by lifting their 12th Estonian Supercup in February 2024. However in July, Hurt resigned after a disappointing 0–5 home loss in the Champions League first qualifying round and was replaced by the club&#x27;s U21 head coach Taavi Viik. Flora finished the 2024 season in fourth place, their first outside the top three finish in eight years. The club appointed their recently retired player Konstantin Vassiljev as head coach for the following season.

==Crest and colours==
Flora crest features the Greco-Roman goddess Flora, after whom the club is named. The club&#x27;s colours are green and white, symbolizing growth, purity and honesty. Since 2024, Flora&#x27;s first team crest also features three stars as the club won their 15th league title in 2023.
== Kit manufacturers and shirt sponsors ==
==Stadium==
The club&#x27;s home ground is the 14,336-seat Lilleküla Stadium. Opened in 2001 and expanded from 2016 to 2018, it is the largest football stadium in Estonia. The Lilleküla Football Complex also includes two grass surface pitches, two artificial turf pitches and an indoor hall. Lilleküla Stadium is located at Jalgpalli 21, Kesklinn, Tallinn.

Flora uses Sportland Arena artificial turf ground, located next to Lilleküla Stadium, for home matches during winter and early spring months, as natural grass grounds are not playable during the period due to the region&#x27;s harsh winter climate.

== Rivalries ==

=== The Tallinn Derby ===
Flora&#x27;s deepest rivalry is with FCI Levadia and the fixture between the two clubs is known as the Tallinn Derby (). Flora and Levadia are the two biggest and most successful clubs in Estonian football. The rivalry began in 1999, when Levadia entered Meistriliiga and immediately challenged the reigning champions Flora for the title, winning the treble in their first year in top-flight football. In the early 2000s, language and nationality was also one of the separating factors between the two clubs, as Levadia was seen as the club of choice for the Russian speaking population of the city and Flora for the Estonian speaking. However, that image of Levadia has since then faded away. From 2019, the two clubs also share their home ground A. Le Coq Arena. The attendance record of 3,510 was set on 28 June 2023.

=== Flora–Kalju rivalry ===
The fixture between Flora and Nõmme Kalju FC is known as &quot;raudteederbi&quot; (). The name derives from the fact that the stadiums of the two clubs are connected via a railway. The rivalry emerged in the early 2010s, when Kalju started challenging Flora in terms of on-field success, as well as in fan popularity. Throughout the years, the rivalry has also intensified due to an enmity between Flora&#x27;s founder Aivar Pohlak and Kalju&#x27;s president Kuno Tehva. Flora&#x27;s signing of Kalju&#x27;s homegrown players Henrik Pürg and Vlasiy Sinyavskiy in 2018 caused a further strife in the relationship of the two clubs and since then, no transfer deals have taken place between them. In an interview in 2023, Flora&#x27;s academy graduate and current national team player Rauno Sappinen said he would rather retire than join Kalju, also calling the rival club &#x27;appalling&#x27;. The fixture&#x27;s attendance record of 3,521 was set in the 2013 Estonian Cup final.

<text>Asom Gana Parishad (translation: &quot;Assam People&#x27;s Council&quot;, AGP) is a political party in the state of Assam, India. The AGP was formed following the historic Assam Accord of 1985 and formally launched at the Golaghat Convention held from 13 to 14 October 1985 in Golaghat, which also allowed Prafulla Kumar Mahanta who was  the youngest chief minister of the state to be elected. The AGP has formed government twice once in 1985 then again in 1996. The popularity of AGP surged in the late 1980s but declined in the 2000s. After a 20-year gap, AGP, in alliance with NDA, won a Lok Sabha seat in 2024.

The party split in 2005, with former Chief Minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta forming the Asom Gana Parishad (Progressive), but regrouped on 14 October 2008 in Golaghat.

It won 14 seats out of 126 in the 2016 Legislative Assembly Elections, coming to power after a long gap. It was a partner in a coalition with the Bodoland People&#x27;s Front and Bharatiya Janata Party.

Currently it is a part of North-East Regional Political Front consisting of political parties of the northeast that has supported the National Democratic Alliance (India). As of 2021, the party is likely to form an alliance with BJP in coming assembly elections as well.
==History==
AGP was a result of a six-year-long civil unrest in Assam, known as The Assam Agitation, led by All Assam Students&#x27; Union, Due to illegal infiltration of foreigners from Bangladesh into the state Assam citizens had raised concerns about illegal infiltration of migrants from neighboring Bangladesh (East Pakistan until 1972), as they feared that it is altering the demographic, social and economic make-up of the state.

In 1979, AASU led what started as a nonviolent campaign to highlight illegal immigration into the state, but later descended into violence. The AASU, joined by the AGSP demanded detection and disenfranchisement of all illegal migrants in the state, and deportation of all immigrants entering the country from 1951 on under the laws of the land. One of the most serious outcomes of the ethnic violence that ensued came to be known as the Nellie massacre when anti-immigrant groups attacked and killed at least 2,000 Muslim, Bengali immigrants. The agitation lasted from 1979 to 1985, and caused tension and hostility during the assembly Election in 1983.

AASU then constituted the All Assam Gana Sangram Parishad (AAGSP) which consisted of representatives of various organizations including the Asom Sahitya Sabha, two regional political parties – Asom Jatiyabadi Dal and Purbanchaliya Loka Parishad, the Sadau Asom Karmachari Parishad, Asom Jatiyabadi Yuva-Chatra Parishad, Asom Yuvak Samaj, All Assam Central and semi-Central Employees’ Association etc.

Several rounds of discussions with successive governments in New Delhi. The accord was signed between the government, represented by prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, and representatives of the AASU.

The State Assembly was then dissolved and the Congress government headed by Hiteswar Saikia, who came to power in February 1983, was dismissed.

The Golaghat National Convention, held in Golaghat on 13–14 October 1985 determined that a regional political party similar to Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) should be formed and the Asom Gana Parishad was launched in Golaghat on 14 October 1985.

The central executive committee of the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) had been dissolved at a convention in North Lakhimpur in September, and Prafulla Kumar Mahanta, the president of the AASU, was elected the president of the presidium of the new political party. Asom Jatiyabadi Dal and the Purbanchaliya Loka Parishad also merged with AGP. Members from other organizations joined the party.

The AGP contested the State Assembly elections held in December 1985 and swept the polls by winning 67 of the 126 seatsin addition to capturing seven of the 14 Lok Sabha (Parliament) seats thus forming the Government of Assam. The party won the election and formed a government again in 1996.

Party leader Prafulla Kumar Mahanta served as the Chief Minister of Assam for two terms, first from 1985 to 1990 and again from 1996 to 2001. Asom Gana Parishad was a part of the National Front government from December 1989 to November 1990.

AGP Member of Parliament Dinesh Goswami was the Union Minister of Law and Justice in the V. P. Singh Ministry. The party also took part in the United Front governments headed by H. D. Deve Gowda and Inder Kumar Gujral. Party leaders Birendra Prasad Baishya and Muhi Ram Saikia took office as Union Minister of Steel and Mines and the Union Minister of State for Human Resources Development respectively in the United Front governments.

The party began losing ground in the 2010s; from 67 seats in the assembly in 1985 and 59 in 1996, the AGP&#x27;s strength in the assembly came down to 14 seats in 2016. Once a formidable force, it has been sidelined by the Bodoland People&#x27;s Front and the AIUDF of Badruddin Ajmal. Currently, the party has only 9 M.L.A in the Legislative Assembly of Assam.AGP was criticised by AASU for supporting CAA in 2019.

==Internal splits and mergers==
The AGP in March 1991 underwent a split when party general secretary and former Assam Home Minister Bhrigu Kumar Phukan, former Union Law Minister and MP Dinesh Goswami, former state Education Minister Brindaban Goswami, Assam Legislative Assembly speaker Pulakesh Barua and others formed the Natun Asom Gana Parishad (&quot;natun&quot; means &quot;new&quot; in Assamese). This fraction came back to the party fold in 1992.

In 2000, former Assam PWD minister and senior party leader Atul Bora (Senior) moved away along with Pulakesh Barua and formed Trinamool Gana Parishad.

After the second AGP Government&#x27;s reign under Prafulla Kumar Mahanta came to an end and Congress regained power, numerous allegations were raised against him related to the corruption during his tenure, government&#x27;s involvement in secret killings, and Mahanta&#x27;s overall inactive leadership. These led to his demotion from being President of the party and later he was expelled from the party on 3 July 2005 after being accused of anti-party activities. Mahanta then formed his own party, Asom Gana Parishad (Progressive).

In 2008, a process started to reconcile the differences among all the breakaway fractions and to bring back everybody under the mother party umbrella to strengthen the regional party movement in Assam. Finally, on 14 October 2008, all breakaway groups reconciled in one umbrella at the historic town Golaghat. Prafulla Mahanta merged his AGP(P) with it. Atul Bora and Pulakesh Barua merged their TGP with the AGP and farmer leader and former legislator of Patacharkuchi, Pabindra Deka too merged the Purbanchaliya Loka Parishad (PLP) with it.

==Splits from AGP==
In 2011, firebrand youth leader Sarbananda Sonowal resigned from all executive posts within AGP and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party, due to dissatisfaction with and amongst the senior leadership of the party who were trying to forge an alliance with a party that was against the scrapping of the controversial IMDT Act. &quot;The AGP was born out of the illegal foreigners&#x27; issue after the six-year-long Assam agitation; 855 people laid down their lives in the agitation. However, the party has failed to honor the sacrifice of the martyrs by deviating from its principles. But I have no grievances against the dedicated grassroots-level workers. Since the AGP has failed to tackle the illegal migrants&#x27; problem, I&#x27;ve joined the BJP keeping in mind the interest of the people of Assam and the fact that I&#x27;ll be able to highlight the problems and issues of the state at the national level,&quot; Sonowal, the former AGP general secretary, said.

On 8 February 2011, Sonowal joined Bharatiya Janata Party in the presence of the then BJP National President Nitin Gadkari and senior leaders like Varun Gandhi, Vijay Goel, Bijoya Chakravarty and state BJP president Ranjit Dutta. He was immediately appointed a member of the BJP National Executive and then later on State Spokesperson of the state BJP unit, prior to his current assignment to head the state as the new president.

Again on 3 July 2013, senior party leader Atul Bora once again left the party and joined BJP.

==2016-present==
In May 2016, after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led National Democratic Alliance which included parties like Asom Gana Parishad and Bodoland People&#x27;s Front formed its first government in Assam, and formed a new alliance called the North-East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) with Himanta Biswa Sarma as its convener. The Chief Ministers of the north eastern states of Sikkim and Nagaland also belong to this alliance. Thus, the Asom Gana Parishad joined the BJP led NEDA.

In November 2016, Atul Bora was elected for President of Asom Gana Parishad second time amending party&#x27;s constitution ‘one man one post’ as he is also minister of Agriculture, Horticulture and Food Processing, Animal Husbandry and Veterinary in Sarbananda Sonowal Ministry.

In January 2019, they broke an alliance with Bharatiya Janata Party on the issue of Citizenship Amendment Bill 2019 but in March 2019 the party returned to North-East Democratic Alliance for the Lok Sabha election. As per the agreement, AGP contested on 3 seats, Bodoland People&#x27;s Front at one and Bharatiya Janata Party on ten seats.

<text>Havnar Bóltfelag (HB, &#x27;Harbour Football Club&#x27;) is a Faroese professional football club, and is one of the oldest in the Faroe Islands. The club was founded in 1904, and is based in the city of Tórshavn. Home matches are played in Gundadalur and they compete in the Faroe Islands Premier League. The full name of the club is &quot;Havnar Bóltfelag Tórshavn&quot;, which means &quot;Port Football Club&quot;. The club was founded by port workers.

==History==

HB Tórshavn was founded in October 1904. The club&#x27;s first board was elected in a meeting, on 14 November 1904. The board consisted of three people: Mads Andrias Winther, Joan Pauli Joensen and Jakup Mouritsen. The future mayor of Tórshavn (1909–12), Mads Andrias Winther, was HB&#x27;s first chairman. HB&#x27;s first match against TB Tvøroyri took place on 23 May 1909, in Tvøroyri. The match ended in a 2–2 draw. Two months later, on 18 July 1909, a second match was organized against TB Tvøroyri, this time held in Tórshavn. HB won the match 3–1.
The first match against future rivals KÍ Klaksvík was held on 16 July 1911, which finished in a 3–3 draw.

In 1942, a national league was formed in the Faroe Islands. The first few seasons weren&#x27;t very successful for HB. Later their results improved and they finished runners-up in 1948, 1949, 1953 and 1954. Then in 1955, HB won the double, by winning the league and the first ever national cup competition, beating KÍ Klaksvík in the final. HB went on to win many more trophies; despite this by 1970, KÍ Klaksvík were the most successful club in the Faroe Islands at the time. That year HB were due to play KÍ Klaksvík in the national cup final. But the final never took place, as KÍ refused to play the final in Tórshavn. HB was not named the winners of the cup that year, even though KÍ failed to appear. HB were the current holders at the time, after beating B36 Tórshavn in the cup final, the previous year. They finished runners-up in 1970 after KÍ Klaksvík won their 5th title in a row. It was the fourth time HB had finished runners-up in the league in the past 4 seasons. The following year it was HB v TB in the cup final, the match went ahead this time and HB won. In the final round of the league there was fighting in the match between HB and KÍ players. HB were the eventual winners of the league and KÍ finished runners-up. HB also won the cup in 1972 and 1973, making them 11 times winners, and winning the cup for 5 consecutive years. They also won the cup 5 times in a row, in the years between 1978 and 1982. HB are the only club in the Faroe Islands to achieve this, with other clubs only having won the cup 2 years consecutively. By this time they had won the Faroe Islands Cup many more times than all other clubs in the Faroe Islands, but KÍ still held the most league titles.

In 1992, clubs in the Faroe Islands took part in European competitions for the first time, after the Faroe Islands Football Association became a member of UEFA a couple of years earlier. HB Tórshavn made their European debut in 1993 against RAF Jelgava in the Cup Winners Cup qualifying round. HB lost the first leg 0–1 away from home, but due to problems with their travel to the Faroe Islands the opponents did not show up for the return leg and HB were awarded a 3–0 win. HB advanced into the first round, but were knocked out by FC U Craiova of Romania. This would turn out to be the only time HB Torshavn or any other Faroese club managed to get through the qualifying round(s) of any European Club Competition to date (June 2018). Since then HB has been involved in European competitions every season except for 2002–03 and 2012–13.

In 2003, HB won the league and equalled KÍ Klaksvík&#x27;s record of 17 league titles. A year later HB won the league again and bettered KÍ&#x27;s record, making HB Tórshavn the most successful team in the Faroe Islands, as they had now won the most national cups and won the most league titles.

HB won the league in 2013 and participated in the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League.

In November 2017, HB hired Heimir Guðjónsson, who had previously guided Fimleikafélag Hafnarfjarðar to five Icelandic championships, as manager. On 23 September 2018 the club won the Faroe Islands Premier League after defeating second placed KÍ, 2–1. With the victory, no team could catch HB even with four matches remaining.

<doc id="831350" wikidata="Q901698" url="?curid=831350" title="Distance matrix">
<text>In mathematics, computer science and especially graph theory, a distance matrix is a square matrix (two-dimensional array) containing the distances, taken pairwise, between the elements of a set. Depending upon the application involved, the &quot;distance&quot; being used to define this matrix may or may not be a metric. If there are elements, this matrix will have size . In graph-theoretic applications, the elements are more often referred to as points, nodes or vertices.

== Non-metric distance matrix ==
In general, a distance matrix is a weighted adjacency matrix of some graph. In a network, a directed graph with weights assigned to the arcs, the distance between two nodes of the network can be defined as the minimum of the sums of the weights on the shortest paths joining the two nodes (where the number of steps in the path is bounded). This distance function, while well defined, is not a metric. There need be no restrictions on the weights other than the need to be able to combine and compare them, so negative weights are used in some applications. Since paths are directed, symmetry can not be guaranteed, and if negative-weight cycles exist the distance matrix may not be hollow (and in the absence of a bound on the step count, the matrix may be undefined).

An algebraic formulation of the above can be obtained by using the min-plus algebra. Matrix multiplication in this system is defined as follows: Given two matrices and , their distance product is defined as an matrix such that 
:formula_1
Note that the off-diagonal elements that are not connected directly will need to be set to infinity or a suitable large value for the min-plus operations to work correctly. A zero in these locations will be incorrectly interpreted as an edge with no distance, cost, etc.

If is an matrix containing the edge weights of a graph, then (using this distance product) gives the distances between vertices using paths of length at most edges, and so is the distance matrix of the graph when the step count bound is set to &quot;k&quot;. If there are no loops of negative weight, will give the true distance matrix, with no bound, because removing repeated vertices from a path cannot lower its weight. On the other hand, if &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; are on a negative-weight loop, will decrease without bound as &quot;k&quot; increases.

An arbitrary graph on vertices can be modeled as a weighted complete graph on vertices by assigning a weight of one to each edge of the complete graph that corresponds to an edge of and infinity to all other edges. for this complete graph is the adjacency matrix of . The distance matrix of can be computed from as above; by contrast, if normal matrix multiplication is used, and unlinked vertices are represented with 0, would instead encode the number of paths between any two vertices of length exactly . 
== Metric distance matrix ==
The value of a distance matrix formalism in many applications is in how the distance matrix can manifestly encode the metric axioms and in how it lends itself to the use of linear algebra techniques. That is, if with is a distance matrix for a metric distance, then

# the entries on the main diagonal are all zero (that is, the matrix is a hollow matrix), i.e. for all ,
# all the off-diagonal entries are positive ( if ), (that is, a non-negative matrix),
# the matrix is a symmetric matrix (), and
# for any and , for all (the triangle inequality). This can be stated in terms of tropical matrix multiplication

When a distance matrix satisfies the first three axioms (making it a semi-metric) it is sometimes referred to as a pre-distance matrix. A pre-distance matrix that can be embedded in a Euclidean space is called a Euclidean distance matrix. For mixed-type data that contain numerical as well as categorical descriptors, Gower&#x27;s distance is a common alternative.

Another common example of a metric distance matrix arises in coding theory when in a block code the elements are strings of fixed length over an alphabet and the distance between them is given by the Hamming distance metric. The smallest non-zero entry in the distance matrix measures the error correcting and error detecting capability of the code.

== Additive distance matrix ==
An additive distance matrix is a special type of matrix used in bioinformatics to build a phylogenetic tree. Let be the lowest common ancestor between two species and , we expect . This is where the additive metric comes from. A distance matrix for a set of species is said to be additive if and only if there exists a phylogeny for such that:

* Every edge in is associated with a positive weight 
* For every , equals the sum of the weights along the path from to in 

For this case, is called an additive matrix and is called an additive tree. Below we can see an example of an additive distance matrix and its corresponding tree:

== Ultrametric distance matrix ==
The ultrametric distance matrix is defined as an additive matrix which models the constant molecular clock. It is used to build a phylogenetic tree. A matrix is said to be ultrametric if there exists a tree such that:

* equals the sum of the edge weights along the path from to in 
* A root of the tree can be identified with the distance to all the leaves being the same

Here is an example of an ultrametric distance matrix with its corresponding tree:

== Bioinformatics ==

The distance matrix is widely used in the bioinformatics field, and it is present in several methods, algorithms and programs. Distance matrices are used to represent protein structures in a coordinate-independent manner, as well as the pairwise distances between two sequences in sequence space. They are used in structural and sequential alignment, and for the determination of protein structures from NMR or X-ray crystallography.

Sometimes it is more convenient to express data as a similarity matrix.

It is also used to define the distance correlation.

=== Sequence alignment ===
An alignment of two sequences is formed by inserting spaces in arbitrary locations along the sequences so that they end up with the same length and there are no two spaces at the same position of the two augmented sequences. One of the primary methods for sequence alignment is dynamic programming. The method is used to fill the distance matrix and then obtain the alignment. In typical usage, for sequence alignment a matrix is used to assign scores to amino-acid matches or mismatches, and a gap penalty for matching an amino-acid in one sequence with a gap in the other.

==== Global alignment ====
The Needleman–Wunsch algorithm used to calculate global alignment uses dynamic programming to obtain the distance matrix.

==== Local alignment ====
The Smith–Waterman algorithm is also dynamic programming based which consists also in obtaining the distance matrix and then obtain the local alignment.

==== Multiple sequence alignment ====
Multiple sequence alignment is an extension of pairwise alignment to align several sequences at a time. Different MSA methods are based on the same idea of the distance matrix as global and local alignments.

* Center star method. This method defines a center sequence which minimizes the distance between the sequence and any other sequence . Then it generates a multiple alignment for the set of sequences so that for every the alignment distance is the optimal pairwise alignment. This method has the characteristic that the computed alignment for whose sum-of-pair distance is at most twice the optimal multiple alignment.
* Progressive alignment method. This heuristic method to create MSA first aligns the two most related sequences, and then it progressively aligns the next two most related sequences until all sequences are aligned.

There are other methods that have their own program due to their popularity:

* ClustalW
* MUSCLE
* MAFFT
* MANGO
* And many more

===== MAFFT =====
Multiple alignment using fast Fourier transform (MAFFT) is a program with an algorithm based on progressive alignment, and it offers various multiple alignment strategies. First, MAFFT constructs a distance matrix based on the number of shared 6-tuples. Second, it builds the guide tree based on the previous matrix. Third, it clusters the sequences with the help of the fast Fourier transform and starts the alignment. Based on the new alignment, it reconstructs the guide tree and align again.

=== Phylogenetic analysis ===
To perform phylogenetic analysis, the first step is to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree: given a collection of species, the problem is to reconstruct or infer the ancestral relationships among the species, i.e., the phylogenetic tree among the species. Distance matrix methods perform this activity.

==== Distance matrix methods ====
Distance matrix methods of phylogenetic analysis explicitly rely on a measure of &quot;genetic distance&quot; between the sequences being classified, and therefore require multiple sequences as an input. Distance methods attempt to construct an all-to-all matrix from the sequence query set describing the distance between each sequence pair. From this is constructed a phylogenetic tree that places closely related sequences under the same interior node and whose branch lengths closely reproduce the observed distances between sequences. Distance-matrix methods may produce either rooted or unrooted trees, depending on the algorithm used to calculate them. Given species, the input is an distance matrix where is the mutation distance between species and . The aim is to output a tree of degree which is consistent with the distance matrix.

They are frequently used as the basis for progressive and iterative types of multiple sequence alignment. The main disadvantage of distance-matrix methods is their inability to efficiently use information about local high-variation regions that appear across multiple subtrees. Despite potential problems, distance methods are extremely fast, and they often produce a reasonable estimate of phylogeny. They also have certain benefits over the methods that use characters directly. Notably, distance methods allow use of data that may not be easily converted to character data, such as DNA–DNA hybridization assays.

The following are distance based methods for phylogeny reconstruction:

* Additive tree reconstruction
* UPGMA
* Neighbor joining
* Fitch–Margoliash

===== Additive tree reconstruction =====
Additive tree reconstruction is based on additive and ultrametric distance matrices. These matrices have a special characteristic:

Consider an additive matrix . For any three species the corresponding tree is unique. Every ultrametric distance matrix is an additive matrix. We can observe this property for the tree below, which consists on the species .

The additive tree reconstruction technique starts with this tree. And then adds one more species each time, based on the distance matrix combined with the property mentioned above. For example, consider an additive matrix and 5 species and . First we form an additive tree for two species and . Then we chose a third one, let&#x27;s say and attach it to a point on the edge between and . The edge weights are computed with the property above. Next we add the fourth species to any of the edges. If we apply the property then we identify that should be attached to only one specific edge. Finally, we add following the same procedure as before.

===== UPGMA =====
The basic principle of UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) is that similar species should be closer in the phylogenetic tree. Hence, it builds the tree by clustering similar sequences iteratively. The method works by building the phylogenetic tree bottom up from its leaves. Initially, we have leaves (or singleton trees), each representing a species in . Those leaves are referred as clusters. Then, we perform iterations. In each iteration, we identify two clusters and with the smallest average distance and merge them to form a bigger cluster . If we suppose is ultrametric, for any cluster created by the UPGMA algorithm, is a valid ultrametric tree.

===== Neighbor joining =====
Neighbor is a bottom-up clustering method. It takes a distance matrix specifying the distance between each pair of sequences. The algorithm starts with a completely unresolved tree, whose topology corresponds to that of a star network, and iterates over the following steps until the tree is completely resolved and all branch lengths are known:

# Based on the current distance matrix calculate the matrix (defined below).
# Find the pair of distinct taxa i and j (i.e. with) for which has its lowest value. These taxa are joined to a newly created node, which is connected to the central node. 
# Calculate the distance from each of the taxa in the pair to this new node.
# Calculate the distance from each of the taxa outside of this pair to the new node.
# Start the algorithm again, replacing the pair of joined neighbors with the new node and using the distances calculated in the previous step.

===== Fitch–Margoliash =====
The Fitch–Margoliash method uses a weighted least squares method for clustering based on genetic distance. Closely related sequences are given more weight in the tree construction process to correct for the increased inaccuracy in measuring distances between distantly related sequences. The least-squares criterion applied to these distances is more accurate but less efficient than the neighbor-joining methods. An additional improvement that corrects for correlations between distances that arise from many closely related sequences in the data set can also be applied at increased computational cost.

== Data Mining and Machine Learning ==

=== Data Mining ===
A common function in data mining is applying cluster analysis on a given set of data to group data based on how similar or more similar they are when compared to other groups. Distance matrices became heavily dependent and utilized in cluster analysis since similarity can be measured with a distance metric. Thus, distance matrix became the representation of the similarity measure between all the different pairs of data in the set.

==== Hierarchical clustering ====
A distance matrix is necessary for traditional hierarchical clustering algorithms which are often heuristic methods employed in biological sciences such as phylogeny reconstruction. When implementing any of the hierarchical clustering algorithms in data mining, the distance matrix will contain all pair-wise distances between every point and then will begin to create clusters between two different points or clusters based entirely on distances from the distance matrix.

If N be the number of points, the complexity of hierarchical clustering is:

* Time complexity is formula_2 due to the repetitive calculations done after every cluster to update the distance matrix
* Space complexity is formula_3

=== Machine Learning ===
Distance metrics are a key part of several machine learning algorithms, which are used in both supervised and unsupervised learning. They are generally used to calculate the similarity between data points: this is where the distance matrix is an essential element. The use of an effective distance matrix improves the performance of the machine learning model, whether it is for classification tasks or for clustering.

==== K-Nearest Neighbors ====
A distance matrix is utilized in the k-NN algorithm which is one of the slowest but simplest and most used instance-based machine learning algorithms that can be used both in classification and regression tasks. It is one of the slowest machine learning algorithms since each test sample&#x27;s predicted result requires a fully computed distance matrix between the test sample and each training sample in the training set. Once the distance matrix is computed, the algorithm selects the K number of training samples that are the closest to the test sample to predict the test sample&#x27;s result based on the selected set&#x27;s majority (classification) or average (regression) value.

* Prediction time complexity is formula_4, to compute the distance between each test sample with every training sample to construct the distance matrix where:

# k = number of nearest neighbors selected 
# n = size of the training set
# d = number of dimensions being used for the data
This classification focused model predicts the label of the target based on the distance matrix between the target and each of the training samples to determine the K-number of samples that are the closest/nearest to the target.
=== Computer Vision ===
A distance matrix can be used in neural networks for 2D to 3D regression in image predicting machine learning models.

== Information retrieval ==

=== Distance matrices using Gaussian mixture distance ===

** Gaussian mixture distance for performing accurate nearest neighbor search for information retrieval. Under an established Gaussian finite mixture model for the distribution of the data in the database, the Gaussian mixture distance is formulated based on minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the distribution of the retrieval data and the data in database. In the comparison of performance of the Gaussian mixture distance with the well-known Euclidean and Mahalanobis distances based on a precision performance measurement, experimental results demonstrate that the Gaussian mixture distance function is superior in the others for different types of testing data.

Potential basic algorithms worth noting on the topic of information retrieval is Fish School Search algorithm an information retrieval that partakes in the act of using distance matrices in order for gathering collective behavior of fish schools. By using a feeding operator to update their weights

Eq. A:

:formula_5

Eq. B:

:formula_6

Stepvol defines the size of the maximum volume displacement preformed with the distance matrix, specifically using a Euclidean distance matrix.

=== Evaluation of the similarity or dissimilarity of Cosine similarity and Distance matrices ===
** While the Cosine similarity measure is perhaps the most frequently applied proximity measure in information retrieval by measuring the angles between documents in the search space on the base of the cosine. Euclidean distance is invariant to mean-correction. The sampling distribution of a mean is generated by repeated sampling from the same population and recording of the sample means obtained. This forms a distribution of different means, and this distribution has its own mean and variance. For the data which can be negative as well as positive, the null distribution for cosine similarity is the distribution of the dot product of two independent random unit vectors. This distribution has a mean of zero and a variance of 1/n. While Euclidean distance will be invariant to this correction.

=== Clustering Documents ===
The implementation of hierarchical clustering with distance-based metrics to organize and group similar documents together will require the need and utilization of a distance matrix. The distance matrix will represent the degree of association that a document has with another document that will be used to create clusters of closely associated documents that will be utilized in retrieval methods of relevant documents for a user&#x27;s query.

=== Isomap ===
Isomap incorporates distance matrices to utilize geodesic distances to able to compute lower-dimensional embeddings. This helps to address a collection of documents that reside within a massive number of dimensions and empowers to perform document clustering.

=== Neighborhood Retrieval Visualizer (NeRV) ===
An algorithm used for both unsupervised and supervised visualization that uses distance matrices to find similar data based on the similarities shown on a display/screen.

The distance matrix needed for Unsupervised NeRV can be computed through fixed input pairwise distances.

The distance matrix needed for Supervised NeRV requires formulating a supervised distance metric to be able to compute the distance of the input in a supervised manner.

== Chemistry ==
The distance matrix is a mathematical object widely used in both graphical-theoretical (topological) and geometric (topographic) versions of chemistry. The distance matrix is used in chemistry in both explicit and implicit forms.

=== Interconversion mechanisms between two permutational isomers ===
Distance matrices were used as the main approach to depict and reveal the shortest path sequence needed to determine the rearrangement between the two permutational isomers.

=== Distance Polynomials and Distance Spectra ===
Explicit use of Distance matrices is required in order to construct the distance polynomials and distance spectra of molecular structures.

=== Structure-property model ===
Implicit use of Distance matrices was applied through the use of the distance based metric Weiner number/Weiner Index which was formulated to represent the distances in all chemical structures. The Weiner number is equal to half-sum of the elements of the distance matrix. 
=== Graph-theoretical Distance matrix ===
Distance matrix in chemistry that are used for the 2-D realization of molecular graphs, which are used to illustrate the main foundational features of a molecule in a myriad of applications.
# Creating a label tree that represents the carbon skeleton of a molecule based on its distance matrix. The distance matrix is imperative in this application because similar molecules can have a myriad of label tree variants of their carbon skeleton. The labeled tree structure of hexane (C6H14) carbon skeleton that is created based on the distance matrix in the example, has different carbon skeleton variants that affect both the distance matrix and the labeled tree

However, LVFF requires the input to be a diagonalized distance matrix which is easily resolved by implementing the Householder tridiagonal-QL algorithm that takes in a distance matrix and returns the diagonalized distance needed for the LVFF method.

=== Geometric-Distance Matrix ===

While the graph-theoretical distance matrix 2-D captures the constitutional features of the molecule, its three-dimensional (3D) character is encoded in the geometric-distance matrix. The geometric-distance matrix is a different type of distance matrix that is based on the graph-theoretical distance matrix of a molecule to represent and graph the 3-D molecule structure. The geometric-distance matrix of a molecular structure is a real symmetric matrix defined in the same way as a 2-D matrix. However, the matrix elements will hold a collection of shortest Cartesian distances between and in . Also known as topographic matrix, the geometric-distance matrix can be constructed from the known geometry of the molecule. As an example, the geometric-distance matrix of the carbon skeleton of &quot;2,4-dimethylhexane&quot; is shown below:

== Other Applications ==

=== Time Series Analysis ===
Dynamic Time Warping distance matrices are utilized with the clustering and classification algorithms of a collection/group of time series objects.

== Examples ==
For example, suppose these data are to be analyzed, where pixel Euclidean distance is the distance metric.

The distance matrix would be:

These data can then be viewed in graphic form as a heat map. In this image, black denotes a distance of 0 and white is maximal distance.

<text>Marian Otis Chandler (July 1, 1866 – August 9, 1952) was the secretary and a director of the Times-Mirror Company, which published the &quot;Los Angeles Times.&quot;

==Biography==
She was born as Emma Marian Otis July 1, 1866, in Marietta, Ohio, to Harrison Gray Otis (publisher) and Eliza Ann Wetherby. Marian had three sisters, Mabel, Lilian, and Esther (who died in infancy),{} and a brother, Harrison Gray (who died in infancy).{}

In 1894, Marian married Harry Chandler, who later became publisher of the &quot;Los Angeles Times.&quot; Marian and Harry raised eight children together, two from Harry&#x27;s first marriage, and six of their own. Norman Chandler (1899–1973), became publisher of the &quot;Times&quot; after his father&#x27;s death.

After the death of her husband in 1944, Mrs. Chandler resigned as secretary; a month later she was elected chairman of the Times-Mirror board. She also was vice president of the Chandis Securities Company and vice-president of the Southwest Land Company and the Southwest Company. She was known for her numerous philanthropies.

She died on August 9, 1952, at her home in the Los Feliz foothills, Los Angeles, California., owned many years later by Father Yod. She was buried at Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood, California. She left seven children — Mrs. Roger Goodan (Alice May), Mrs. Earle E. Crowe (Constance), Mrs. John J. Garland (Helen), Mrs. James G. Boswell (Ruth), Norman Chandler. Philip Chandler and Harrison Chandler, as well as a sister, Mabel Otis Booth.

==Legacy==
* The community of Reseda, California, was originally named Marian, after Mrs. Chandler.
* A freighter ship built in 1917 (originally named War Flame but known as Empire Leopard when torpedoed and sunk November 2, 1942, by the German submarine U-402) was bought in 1929 by the Los Angeles Steamship Company and renamed Marian Otis Chandler, holding that name until it was sold again in 1939.

<text>The Metropolitan Autonomous University (Spanish: &quot;Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana&quot;) also known as UAM, is a Mexican public research university. Founded in 1974 with the support of then-President Luis Echeverria Alvarez, the institution aims to be closely linked to the social and human environment.

As an autonomous university, UAM is a public agency of the Mexican government. It has five academic units located in Mexico City and Greater Mexico City: Azcapotzalco, in north, Iztapalapa, in east, Cuajimalpa, in west, Xochimilco, in south, and Lerma in State of Mexico.),

The institution is among the top academic universities in Mexico. In 2019, it ranked first among both public and private institution, was second in the number of full-time research professors with doctorates, according to the (&quot;Estudio Comparativo de Universidades Mexicanas&quot;); having the second largest number of built in National and Research System (&quot;Sistema Nacional de Investigadores&quot;) the second in having researchers at Level 3 of the same researchers. One of the leading universities in Mexico to submit the highest number of research. And the second institution to have publications in refereed journals, such as the Institute for Scientific Information, Latindex and journals included in the &quot;Index of Mexican Journals of Scientific and Technological Research&quot; of the National Council of Science and Technology (&quot;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología&quot;) and the second to have magazines within the Conacyt, it is also among the top four with the largest number of patents granted in Mexico.

== History ==
After the historic 1968 Tlatelolco massacre in Mexico concluded, and after other subsequent movements in favor of education and claim social improvements, the need for comprehensive education reform in Mexico was evident.

In 1973, during the administration of President Luis Echeverria Alvarez, the &quot;National Association of Universities and Institutions of Higher Education&quot; (ANUIES), he presented a document to the President noting the need to establish a new university in the metropolitan area Mexico City, taking into consideration issues such as increasing student demand and the increasing failure of existing universities to admit more students.

It then proposed that the nascent university project also constituted an opportunity to modernize higher education in the country. The expected characteristics of the new university were it to be public, metropolitan, independent, innovative addition to its educational and organizational terms. It is under such expectations that the law comes into force for the creation of the Autonomous Metropolitan University, on 1 January 1974. On 10 January of that year, he was appointed first Rector of the UAM architect Pedro Ramirez Vazquez.

The University is established since its creation three units, which are located in Iztapalapa, Azcapotzalco and Xochimilco, with the idea of promoting decentralization and allow the full development of each. Empirically, scientific research in Iztapalapa (UAM-I) Unit is located, the traditional careers such as civil engineering and architecture at the Azcapotzalco (UAM-A) unit and the area of health in the Xochimilco Unit (UAM -X). Subsequently, it was decided that their internal organization would be composed of divisions and academic departments, creating a contrast with the Schools and Colleges of existing universities. Each division would group different areas of knowledge and related disciplines each department, in order to give a flexible structure that prevents the lag that education has suffered in relation to the progress of science. The first Rector of the Iztapalapa Unit was Dr. Alonso Fernandez González and began operations on September 30, 1974.

In turn, the Rector of the Azcapotzalco Unit was Dr. Juan Casillas García de León, which opened its doors 11 November 1974. For the Xochimilco was Rector Dr. Ramon Villarreal Perez, initiating teaching also the November 11, 1974. Recently, the possibility of creating a new unit of the UAM was analyzed. The April 26, 2005 the Academic College of the institution approved the creation of the Cuajimalpa campus, appointing in June of that year Dr. Fresán Magdalena Orozco as the first Rector. The activities of the Unit officially pulled the September 14, 2005, using different locations, at first at the Universidad Iberoamericana. Then he took three temporary facilities: Baja California, Artifice and Constituents Constituents adding a fourth in 647. His final location was achieved in 2014 on the grounds of &quot;Scorpio&quot;, ancient land of the &quot;Zona Especial Forestal y de Repoblación Bosques Industriales La Venta&quot;, which had not been built by the lack of legal certainty and the opposition of local people to Ocotal forest development in the sale of Cuajimalpa.

==Campuses==
The university system has 5 units, with campuses located in different boroughs of Mexico City and in the adjacent state:
* UAM Azcapotzalco — located in Azcapotzalco, northern Mexico City
* UAM Iztapalapa — located in Iztapalapa, eastern Mexico City
* UAM Cuajimalpa — located in Cuajimalpa, western Mexico City
* UAM Xochimilco — located in Coyoacán, southern Mexico City.
* UAM Lerma — located near Toluca, in the State of Mexico.

===Main office===
UAM Rectoría is the main office of the university system. It is located in the south of the city, on Canal de Miramontes street near Xochimilco.

<doc id="831390" wikidata="Q3049304" url="?curid=831390" title="TCP Wrappers">
<text>TCP Wrappers (also known as tcp_wrappers) is a host-based networking ACL system, used to filter network access to Internet Protocol servers on (Unix-like) operating systems such as Linux or BSD. It allows host or subnetwork IP addresses, names and/or ident query replies, to be used as tokens on which to filter for access control purposes.

The original code was written by Wietse Venema in 1990 to monitor a cracker&#x27;s activities on the Unix workstations at the Department of Math and Computer Science at the Eindhoven University of Technology. He maintained it until 1995, and on June 1, 2001, released it under its own BSD-style license.

The tarball includes a library named libwrap that implements the actual functionality. Initially, only services that were spawned for each connection from a super-server (such as inetd) got &quot;wrapped&quot;, utilizing the tcpd program. However most common network service daemons today can be linked against libwrap directly. This is used by daemons that operate without being spawned from a super-server, or when a single process handles multiple connections. Otherwise, only the first connection attempt would get checked against its ACLs.

When compared to host access control directives often found in daemons&#x27; configuration files, TCP Wrappers have the benefit of runtime ACL reconfiguration (i.e., services don&#x27;t have to be reloaded or restarted) and a generic approach to network administration.

This makes it easy to use for anti-worm scripts, such as DenyHosts or Fail2ban, to add and expire client-blocking rules, when excessive connections and/or many failed login attempts are encountered.

While originally written to protect TCP and UDP accepting services, examples of usage to filter on certain ICMP packets exist too, such as &#x27;pingd&#x27; – the userspace ping request responder.

==1999 Trojan==
In January 1999, the distribution package at Eindhoven University of Technology (the primary distribution site until that day) was replaced by a modified version. The replacement contained a trojaned version of the software that would allow the intruder access to any server that it was installed on. The author spotted this within hours, upon which he relocated the primary distribution to his personal site.

<doc id="831399" wikidata="Q831664" url="?curid=831399" title="Betrayal at Krondor">
<text>Betrayal at Krondor is an MS-DOS-based role-playing video game developed by Dynamix and released by Sierra On-Line in the summer of 1993. &quot;Betrayal at Krondor&quot; takes place largely in Midkemia, the fantasy world developed by Raymond E. Feist in his &quot;Riftwar&quot; novels. The game is designed to resemble a book, separated into chapters and narrated in the third-person with a quick-save bookmark feature.

Although neither the dialog nor narrative were written by Feist himself, the game is considered canon, having been novelized as &quot;&quot; five years later. Events in the game were also written into the &quot;Riftwar&quot; novels.

PyroTechnix completed a sequel, &quot;Return to Krondor&quot;, which was released by Sierra in 1998. Its protracted development experienced considerable delay, and the finished product was not nearly as warmly received as &quot;Betrayal&quot;.

GOG.com released an emulated version of &quot;Betrayal at Krondor&quot; for Microsoft Windows in 2010.

==Gameplay==

Gameplay occurs mainly from a first-person perspective while traveling the overworld, dungeons, and caves, but switches to a third-person view during combat. The user interface is mouse-driven, with keyboard hotkeys for each action.

The game has two possible views, the 3D first-person view and the 2D top-down map view, where the player is represented with a triangular marker. The overworld is completely mapped, but other locations are automatically mapped in the top-down view as the player explores them. The player can also view the full map of Midkemia and see their location.

Each chapter&#x27;s main plot usually takes place completely within one or two regions of the game world. However, the player is given enormous freedom to explore the world however they wish, with ample opportunity to perform optional sub-quests and enhance their characters&#x27; abilities, gain cash, upgrade weapons and armor, and so on. Only certain locations are accessible in each chapter, though the player is free to explore anywhere within those boundaries as well as take their time performing quests. While traveling, the party camps in the wilderness to rest and recover lost health and stamina, provided that there are no enemies in the vicinity.

===Moredhel wordlock chests===
One of the game&#x27;s unique features is the large assortment of Moredhel wordlock chests, hidden throughout the land. These chests have combination locks with letters on each dial, and a riddle written upon them whose answer opens the chest. Wordlock chests can hold valuable items and equipment, as well as quest items essential to completing the game. If no member of the player&#x27;s party can read Moredhel, the writing on the chest will appear untranslated, although it can still be opened by a brute force method of systematically cycling through each tumbler. The Moredhel alphabet is a character substitution of the A-Z alphabet. Gorath, a Moredhel, can read it, and casting the Union spell allows Patrus to do so for short periods of time. Wordlock chests containing essential quest items are relatively easy to find, either located near roads or their locations being disclosed through interaction with NPCs. However, &quot;bonus&quot; wordlock chests are typically hidden in areas where the player is not likely to travel unless they are assiduously searching for treasure.

===Plot and dialogue===
The storyline is advanced primarily through literary cutscenes. Each chapter begins and ends with a cutscene, consisting of text, dialogue, and animations. The player meets various NPCs during their travels. Dialogue is text-based and some NPCs have their own pictures as well. Conversation is tree-based: in some cases, the player can choose between various dialogue keywords. This is used to get information, training, and items, sometimes for a price.

===RPG system and player character development===

There are two or three characters in the adventuring party at any time. While the player meets various non-human characters during the game (including dwarves, elves, goblins, and dragons), five of the six player characters are human. The exception is Gorath, a dark elf. There are two classes of characters: fighters (Locklear, James, and Gorath) and magicians (Pug, Owyn, and Patrus). Fighters use swords and crossbows, while magicians use a staff. The only long-range attacks magicians are capable of are magic spells.

The character system is unique. The main character attributes are health, stamina, speed, and strength. Speed determines how many combat grid squares the character can move. Strength influences the amount of damage the character inflicts in mêlée combat. Spell-casting, swinging one&#x27;s weapon, and combat damage first use up stamina. Once stamina is depleted, you begin to eat into health. Once it decreases, the character&#x27;s skills (such as the crucial trait of weapon accuracy), as well as their movement speed, are adversely impacted.

In addition to attributes, each character has a set of skills expressed as percentages. Skills can be emphasized, causing them to improve faster, while de-emphasized skills improve more slowly. Unlike many other role-playing games, skills are improved by using them rather than through a leveling up system. For example, fixing weapons will improve the weaponcraft skill, which in turn will make the character more effective at fixing weapons in the future. Skills include defense, crossbow accuracy, mêlée weapon accuracy, spell-casting accuracy, enemy assessment, weapon and armor repair, barding, haggling, lockpicking, scouting for ambushes, and stealth. Some NPCs offer training in skills and items can increase skills permanently or temporarily.

Characters can acquire various status effects that affect their health or skills. Characters whose health drops to zero in combat are knocked out and acquire &quot;near death&quot; status, making them ineffective in combat, and their health recovery rate drops virtually to nil. If the health of the entire party drops to zero, the game will end. Improved healing rate is handled as a status effect as well, as are poisoning, drunkenness, sickness (from eating spoiled rations), and plague, which is an extremely serious condition that can reduce the party to moribund husks incapable of any productive action.

===Magic===

Spells are organized into six groups, grouped by magic symbol. Four groups of spells are combat spells and two groups are non-combat spells.

Spells first drain the caster&#x27;s stamina and then health. Some spells have variable strength; the player can choose how much energy the spell consumes. Some combat spells also require that the target being within line of sight of the caster.

Spells are learned from scrolls that are found in caches or on enemies and can be bought from shops or NPCs throughout the world.

===Items and inventory===

The game features a wide variety of items, including equipment, food, treasure, and magical artifacts. Each item also has detailed background information available by right-clicking it.

The inventory management allows transferring items between the party characters. In the case of stacks of multiple items, there&#x27;s also an option to distribute them evenly within the party. The game also manages money and keys independently.

Each weapon and type of armor has modifiers affecting its combat effectiveness, such as accuracy, damage, blessing, and racial modifiers. After combat, most weapons and armor must be kept in shape with a whetstone or armorer&#x27;s hammer respectively. There are also items that enhance weapons and armor, such as the poisonous silverthorn or fiery naphtha.

Player characters must carry and eat rations every day or their health starts dropping. Rations are sold in taverns and can be found on enemies and in caches. Rations can also be poisoned or spoiled and will sicken characters if they eat it, adversely affecting their health, although careful inspection of all packages of questionable provenance will avoid this possibility.

===Combat===

Combat is turn-based and takes place on a grid, similar to tactical role-playing games. The characters can move to a different location on the grid and if they can reach an enemy, can attack in the same move. There are two options for attacking: a thrust and a swing. The thrust is the default attack used when moving to attack an enemy. The swing often does more damage but is less accurate and uses up one point of health/stamina. Fighters can use crossbows and magicians can cast spells, but only if there are no enemy units in adjacent squares. The player can also rest, which regains health and stamina, defend against enemy mêlée attacks, or assess an enemy&#x27;s capabilities.

Injured enemies may try to flee from combat, and will escape entirely and permanently from the player&#x27;s grasp, unless they are killed or otherwise prevented them from reaching the upper edge of the battlefield. Defeated enemies remain on the ground after a battle, allowing the player to loot their remains. Salvaged items of little use to the party may be sold at shops in order to boost cash reserves.

The combat interface is also used to solve magical traps. Traps involve various types of hazards, such as fireball blasters and laser crystals, and the player either has to disable them using the objects provided or otherwise navigate through the trap and reach the top of the combat field.

Although the game uses a GUI, many actions can be performed using keys as well. There is a glitch (or intended hidden feature) that allows the player to make certain combinations of two moves in a single turn—one using the mouse and another using the keyboard—or rest twice by pressing &#x27;R&#x27; before the turn begins and holding it through the turn. Computer opponents also seem to use this in some instances (like moving and defending in the same turn).

Another type of character-environment interaction, that could be considered a trap or a bonus, are the graveyards scattered around the landscape. The player is able to read the inscriptions on the gravestones (usually in the form of a short poetic eulogy), and then decide to dig up the grave (if someone has a shovel). Some graves reveal items and/or money, while others summon a ghost (in some cases, multiple ghosts), which must be fought using the standard combat interface.

===Temples, stores and inns===
Temples offer a variety of services including healing and blessing equipment. They also sell a relatively expensive teleportation service; the player is able to teleport between any temples they have already visited, with the price based on the distance traveled. This operates on the principle that a person visiting a new temple will memorize a unique pattern upon the wall, and by recalling this pattern at a different temple, be transported to the first temple with the aid of a priest.

Stores buy and sell various kinds of items; some also repair equipment. Inns and taverns allow characters to buy food and alcohol, gain information on local happenings, gamble (in some inns), talk to some NPCs, earn money by playing the lute, and sleep, which allows full healing of wounds and fatigue, whereas resting in the wilderness only restores 80% of health and stamina.

==Characters==
===Main characters===
; Seigneur Locklear
: (Chapters 1, 5, 7) Locklear is the youngest son of the Baron of Land&#x27;s End, a Seigneur in Prince Arutha&#x27;s court, and a skilled swordsman decorated for his service at Armengar and Sethanon during the Great Uprising (&quot;A Darkness at Sethanon&quot;). Locklear recently entered the service of a Kingdom garrison in Yabon to investigate reports of moredhel activity, where he rescued Gorath of the Ardanien from an assassin.

; Squire Owyn Beleforte
: (Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9) Owyn is a nineteen-year-old magician and the youngest son of the Count of Tiburn. Uninterested in politics, Owyn instead idolizes the magician Pug. A resourceful and crafty boy, Owyn used part of his father&#x27;s wealth to travel and study magic in secret. His father eventually discovered what he was doing and, due to the political embarrassment Owyn causes him, has given him a great deal of freedom, hoping that he will eventually settle down and become suitable for a political marriage. Owyn was traveling home from visiting his aunt in Yabon when he met Locklear and Gorath. Not eager to return to the boredom of life at home, Owyn hitches his fate to theirs.

; Gorath of the Ardanien
: (Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9) A hero of the Riftwar, Gorath was chieftain of Clan Ardanien and Delekhan&#x27;s chief rival to the throne of Sar-Sargoth. Gorath believes Delekhan&#x27;s plan to invade the Kingdom to be madness and betrays the moredhel to warn Prince Arutha, as it the only way to save his people from another disastrous war. There is also another reason for his exile: he has broken from the Dark Path and is &quot;Returning&quot; to the eledhel in Elvandar, assuming he is not killed by his brethren first.

; Seigneur James
: (Chapters 2, 3, 5, 7) Once known as Jimmy the Hand, James is a legend among the Mockers and the son of the Upright Man, though he is unaware of his parentage. After foiling a Nighthawk attempt to assassinate Prince Arutha (&quot;Silverthorn&quot;), James was forced to give up his life as a thief and became a squire in Arutha&#x27;s court, where he became best friends with Locklear. James eventually rose to the rank of Seigneur, becoming one of Arutha&#x27;s most trusted and loyal servants but still wanders the Thieves&#x27; Highway, often on business for the Crown.

; Patrus
: (Chapters 5, 7) Patrus is the court magician and magical adviser to Baron Gabot in Northwarden and one of Owyn&#x27;s early magical tutors. Despite his old age, he is a spry and capable magician, whose knowledge of the Union spell allows him to temporarily read moredhel.

; Duke Pug conDoin
: (Chapters 8, 9) As an orphan growing up in Crydee, Pug was apprenticed to Kulgan the magician but showed little magical ability until he was captured by the Tsurani during the Riftwar (&quot;Magician: Apprentice&quot;). Seeing potential in the boy, Tsurani Great Ones trained him in the magic of the Greater Path, previously nonexistent in Midkemia. When he returned, Pug helped the sorcerer Macros the Black end the Riftwar and was adopted into the royal family and given land to start his academy of magic at Stardock (&quot;Magician: Master&quot;). Pug is considered the most powerful magician in Midkemia, having inherited much of Macros&#x27; power in addition to his Tsurani training. He is married to Katala, whom he met in Kelewan, and has two children: a biological son William and an adopted daughter Gamina, who has telepathic powers.

===Allies===
; Prince Arutha conDoin
: Prince Arutha of Krondor is ruler of the Western Realm, younger brother of King Lyam, and half-brother of Duke Martin of Crydee. Arutha proved himself one of the Kingdom&#x27;s best field commanders defending Crydee during the Riftwar and became prince after the unexpected deaths of King Rodric, Prince Erland, and his father Duke Borric. He is a well-loved and capable ruler, albeit a reluctant one.

; Cullich
: Gorath&#x27;s estranged wife Cullich is a moredhel witch who helped him escape from the Northlands. Cullich thinks Gorath&#x27;s willingness to surrender his position as clan leader is a sign of weakness but she doesn&#x27;t trust Delekhan and will help Gorath if she can.

; Baron Gabot
: Baron Gabot is commander of Northwarden, which guards one of the four passes between the Kingdom and the Northlands. Previously Huntmaster of Carse, Gabot was old acquaintances with Duke Martin, who recommended him to the position after Baron Rossol died. Like Martin&#x27;s father Duke Borric, Gabot saw the benefit of having a magician in his service and appointed Patrus his magical adviser.

; Liallan
: As a powerful moredhel clan leader and Delekhan&#x27;s consort, Liallan openly supports him though she believes his plan is doomed to fail. She has her eye on the throne of Sar-Sargoth for herself and secretly aids many of Delekhan&#x27;s enemies, including engineering Gorath&#x27;s escape from the Northlands. Should Delekhan and his son Moraeulf die during their invasion, it would leave her in a prime position to take over the leadership of the moredhel.

; Duke Martin conDoin
: Once known as Martin Longbow, Duke Martin of Crydee is the elder half-brother of King Lyam and Prince Arutha. The illegitimate son of Duke Borric, he was raised and trained by the elves in Elvandar before becoming Huntmaster and later Duke upon the death of his father. One of the best archers in Midkemia, Martin dislikes court life and often roams the forests with his longbow in hand.

; The Oracle of Aal
: The Aal are among the oldest races in the universe and one of the few to survive the Chaos Wars between the Valheru and the gods. The Oracle, the last of its dying race, agreed to help Pug and Tomas during the Great Rising in exchange for salvation. After the battle of Sethanon, Pug brought the Oracle to Sethanon and placed it in the body of the dragon Ryath, whose mind was drained by a Dreadlord (&quot;A Darkness at Sethanon&quot;). The Oracle of Aal now watches over the Lifestone and will send warning to Pug and a secret garrison near Sethanon if it is disturbed.

; Squire Phillip
: Though he appears to be a young noble about Owyn&#x27;s age, Phillip is actually thirty-seven, a captain in the Kingdom Army, and a courier for the secret garrison near Sethanon. Owyn met him at a party in Yabon prior to the start of the game and meets him again throughout his travels.

; Tomas
: Prince Consort to Queen Aglaranna and Warleader of Elvandar, Tomas grew up in Crydee with his best friend Pug. During the Riftwar, Tomas discovered the dying dragon Rhuagh, who gave him an ancient suit of armor (&quot;Magician: Apprentice&quot;). The armor transformed Tomas into a blend of human and Valheru and gave him the memories and abilities of Ashen-Shugar, the Valheru to whom it once belonged. After marrying Aglaranna, Tomas considers Elvandar under his protection and only leaves in the most extreme of circumstances.

===Villains===
; Delekhan
: Delekhan is the leader of the Moredhel Nations of the North. One of the Murmandamus&#x27; field generals during the Great Rising (&quot;A Darkness at Sethanon&quot;), Delekhan believes Murmandamus still lives, imprisoned by Prince Arutha at Sethanon. He has unified his people with the help of magicians known only as &quot;the Six&quot; (later revealed to be Tsurani Great Ones) in order to invade the Kingdom of the Isles, free Murmandamus, and finish what was started a decade before.

; Makala
: Makala is a Great One, a magician from the Tsurani homeworld of Kelewan, who is visiting Prince Arutha&#x27;s court ostensibly as a representative of the Emperor of Tsuranuanni. Believing that Pug hid a weapon of tremendous power which could be used against the Tsurani, Makala set out to investigate what really happened at the battle of Sethanon. He manipulates Delekhan and the moredhel, using their attack as a diversion so that he can enter Sethanon unhindered.

; Narab and Nago
: The brothers Narab and Nago are magicians who serve Delekhan. Nago has infiltrated the Kingdom and coordinates moredhel spies from a secret location near Sarth. Narab has fallen out of favor with Delekhan, and seeking to regain his position in Delekhan&#x27;s inner circle, captures Owyn and Gorath for him. However, Delekhan is displeased with what he has done so Narab turns on his former master and helps Owyn and Gorath escape. He then plans on becoming leader of the moredhel himself.

; Navon du Sandau
: To most he is simply a charismatic young merchant, but Navon is actually Neville Corvalis, the half-brother of Owyn&#x27;s cousin Ugyne. When Ugyne&#x27;s father Count Corvalis found out that Neville was his wife&#x27;s illegitimate son, he arranged to have Neville killed in a wine cellar collapse. Though he was believed dead, Neville&#x27;s body was never found. He was found by Nighthawks who had regrouped in Cavall after their destruction in Krondor by Prince Arutha (&quot;A Darkness at Sethanon&quot;). Using a Corvalis family heirloom, a magical spyglass, Neville convinced them he had magical powers and became their leader. He then set about exacting revenge on Count Corvalis, burning down the keep so the caverns underneath could be used as a Nighthawk hideout and courting Ugyne so he could take over her family&#x27;s fortune.

==Locations==

===Midkemia===
; Cavall Keep
: (Accessible in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 6) Cavall Keep is a small eastern farming town in the Kenting Hills ruled by Owyn&#x27;s uncle, Count Geoffrey Corvalis. The keep burned down mysteriously three years ago, preventing access to the caverns underneath, which run south to the waterfall known as Cavall Run.

; Elvandar
: (Accessible in Chapter 6) The forest city of Elvandar, home of the eledhel (the light elves), lies far to the northwest of the duchy of Yabon and is ruled by Queen Aglaranna and Prince Consort Tomas. Though isolated and well-protected, the Tsurani attacked Elvandar during the Riftwar and there are still skirmishes with the moredhel on its northern borders.

; Highcastle
: (Accessible in Chapters 1, 2, 3) The frontier fort town of Highcastle guards Cutter&#x27;s Gap, one of the four passes between the Kingdom and the Northlands. Overrun by the moredhel during the Great Rising (&quot;A Darkness at Sethanon&quot;), Prince Arutha had the fortifications reinforced in recent years. Highcastle is currently commanded by Baron Baldwin de la Troville and, in his absence, Baron Kevin of Zun.

; Krondor
: (Accessible in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 6) Capital of the Western Realm of the Kingdom of the Isles, Krondor is the traditional home of the heir apparent to the throne. It is currently ruled by Prince Arutha and Princess Anita, though the sewers under the city are a maze of tunnels known as the Thieves&#x27; Highway and controlled by the Mockers, the thieves&#x27; guild of Krondor, and their mysterious leader, the Upright Man.

; LaMut
: (Accessible in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 6) The city of LaMut is located in the duchy of Yabon, near the reopened rift to Kelewan. It is ruled by the Earl Kasumi and home to a large Tsurani population that settled there after the Riftwar.
; Malac&#x27;s Cross
: (Accessible in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 6) The city of Malac&#x27;s Cross marks the eastern boundary of the Western Realm and is home to the Abbaye Ishap, an ancient temple currently run by the Abbot Graves. Outside of the city, where the old city once stood, is a statue of a dragon, built as a tribute to Malac, from which the Oracle of Aal can be contacted.

; Northwarden

; Sarth
: (Accessible in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 6) The town of Sarth is home to an ancient mountaintop fortress which was converted into an abbey and library by the Order of Ishap. The vaults have hundreds of thousands of books, containing a wealth of knowledge about the history and lore of Midkemia, tended to by Brother Anthony and Brother Marc. Beneath the vaults is an abandoned dwarven emerald mine known as the Mac Bourgalan Dok.

; Sar-Isbandia (Armengar)
: (Accessible in Chapter 4) The fortress city of Sar-Isbandia was built atop miles of naphtha tunnels long ago by the glamredhel (the mad elves) before they were obliterated by the moredhel (the dark elves). Located in the Vale of Isbandia north of the Inclindel Gap, humans from Yabon settled in the city hundreds of years ago, renamed it Armengar and became lifelong enemies of the moredhel. The Armengarians were among Murmandamus&#x27; first targets during the Great Rising so Prince Arutha and Guy du Bas-Tyra, the city&#x27;s Protector, evacuated the city and attempted to destroy Murmandamus&#x27; army by incinerating the city (&quot;A Darkness at Sethanon&quot;). Recently, moredhel have moved into the ruins and started to rebuild.

Coincidentally built above the ancient Valheru ruins containing the Lifestone, King Lyam and Prince Arutha ordered the city abandoned after the Battle of Sethanon, ostensibly as a memorial to those who had died there, and stationed a secret garrison nearby to protect it. Within the ruins beneath the city lies the Lifestone and its guardian, the dragon Ryath, whose mind contains the Oracle of Aal.

===Timirianya===
: (Accessible in Chapter 8) The desolate world of Timirianya was destroyed by the Valheru and is currently inhabited by Panath-Tiandn, humanoid serpents akin to Pantathians. During the Chaos Wars, the gods of Timirianya crystallized magic into solid manna, causing the Valheru to leave when they thought the world&#x27;s energy was depleted. In order to cast magic on Timirianya, one must use a crystal staff and keep it charged with raw manna.

; The Temple of Karzeen Mauk
: Located in the north, all that remains of the high temple of the gods of Timirianya are nine pillars, within which the surviving gods have taken refuge. Only Dhatsavan, Lord of Gates, still has enough power left to communicate with visitors.

; The Temple of Dhatsavan (Riftworld Mine)
: Also known as the Riftworld Mine, the ruins of the temple are buried underground and are currently occupied by Panath-Tiandn. After Makala abducts her, Gamina is imprisoned in a crystal cage within the ruins.

==Plot==
Ten years after &quot;A Darkness at Sethanon&quot;, Seigneur Locklear is serving at a northern Kingdom garrison when he saves Gorath of the Ardanien from an assassin. Gorath has brought a warning of an invasion planned by Delekhan, leader of the moredhel, so Locklear agrees to take him to see Prince Arutha in Krondor. Injured from numerous attacks, they ask for help from Owyn Beleforte, a young magician from Tiburn. The game begins in their camp north of LaMut.

===Chapter I: Into A Dark Night===
Owyn is bandaging Gorath&#x27;s and Locklear&#x27;s injuries when they are attacked by a moredhel assassin whom Gorath dispatches before the three of them set out south. Surviving multiple assassination attempts, they eventually reach Krondor. Finding the palace gates sabotaged, they enter the palace via the sewers with Seigneur James&#x27; help. Upon meeting Prince Arutha, another moredhel assassin sneaks in and attempts to kill Gorath, only to be foiled by Pug.

===Chapter II: Shadow Of The Nighthawks===
Gorath informs Arutha of Delekhan&#x27;s plans, but Arutha does not trust him because he does not know the location of the attack. Gorath thinks they can find out by intercepting Delekhan&#x27;s Nighthawk spies in Romney. Arutha arranges for James to escort Gorath to Romney and meet with a group of the king&#x27;s soldiers investigating recent Nighthawk activity in the east. Arutha will muster his army and await word of where the attack will occur. James, Owyn, and Gorath secretly slip out of the city through the sewers and head east. Arriving at the tavern in Romney, they discover that the king&#x27;s soldiers have all been murdered.

===Chapter III: The Spyglass And The Spider===
Two clues were left behind at the murder scene: an enchanted spyglass and a silver spider. James, Owyn, and Gorath follow the trail of the spyglass and the spider north to Cavall Keep and uncover the leader of the Nighthawks, the merchant Navon du Sandau. After killing him, they enter the Nighthawks&#x27; hideout in the caverns beneath Cavall Keep, where they learn that Delekhan plans to attack Northwarden. Realizing that Nighthawks probably infiltrated the fortress, they split up. James heads to Northwarden while Owyn and Gorath head south to warn Arutha. Before they can reach Arutha though, Owyn and Gorath are captured by Narab, one of Delekhan&#x27;s chieftains.

===Chapter IV: Marked For Death===
Gorath and Owyn are taken to Sar-Sargoth, where Narab presents them to Delekhan. Delekhan, enraged that Narab has ruined his plans, tells him his life is forfeit. Narab turns on Delekhan and, unbeknownst to them, frees Owyn and Gorath. They escape Sar-Sargoth and head south to the Inclindel Gap, where they meet a Kingdom patrol and are taken to Arutha&#x27;s camp. Learning of the impending attack on Northwarden, Arutha readies his army and sends Owyn and Gorath to Krondor to seek Pug&#x27;s help in case the moredhel employ magic.

===Chapter V: When Rivers Run Blood===
James and Locklear arrive at Northwarden and are sent by Baron Gabot to find his magical adviser Patrus. The three of them help Duke Martin prepare for the attack by poisoning moredhel food supplies, finding the minstrel Tamney, stealing the moredhel battle plans, and killing six moredhel magicians hiding behind Kingdom lines. Returning to Northwarden as the moredhel siege begins, they discover that Nighthawks have murdered Baron Gabot, leaving James in command. The battle goes badly and they are about to be overrun when Arutha arrives with his army in time to drive off the moredhel.

===Chapter VI: Betrayal===
Makala visits Pug in Krondor, telling him that Gamina is considered an abomination by the Assembly of Magicians and that he has imprisoned her until her fate can be decided. Pug is enraged at Makala&#x27;s betrayal and vows to find her, blasting the words &quot;The Book Of Macros&quot; into the wall. When Katala is unable to find him or their daughter, she discovers his message and informs Owyn and Gorath. Following clues from the libraries at Sarth and the Abbaye Ishap, Owyn and Gorath head west to Elvandar, where Gorath completes his &quot;Returning&quot; and pledges his allegiance to Queen Aglaranna and Prince Consort Tomas. Tomas shows them the Book of Macros, a gift from Pug to find him should he leave the message to do so. Recently injured by a poisoned blade in a moredhel skirmish, Tomas asks Owyn and Gorath to go in his stead. Owyn and Gorath read the book, which teleports them into the unknown.

===Chapter VII: The Long Ride===
In Northwarden, the moredhel raiding leader is captured and reveals that they plan to use a rift machine in the Dimwood to bypass Arutha&#x27;s army, enter Sethanon, and free Murmandamus, whom they believe is alive and imprisoned there. Realizing that the attack was a diversion engineered by Makala, Arutha orders his troops to Sethanon and instructs James, Locklear, and Patrus to find and destroy the rift machine. After learning that the machine can be disrupted by a Tsurani device called a Waani, they find the machine and disable it. However, as the rift collapses, it pulls in everything nearby before exploding. James and Locklear grab onto trees but Patrus is sucked into the collapsing rift and is apparently killed. At the same moment, three figures appear in a flash of purple light.

===Chapter VIII: Of Lands Afar===
Owyn and Gorath are teleported to Timirianya, where Owyn realizes that magic does not work and Pug would be powerless. Owyn and Gorath eventually find Pug, who has figured out that by abducting Gamina and manipulating Delekhan, Makala has lured Pug away from Midkemia and Arutha&#x27;s army away from Sethanon and is free to enter Sethanon unopposed and seek out the Lifestone. Using the Cup of Rlnn Skrr, Owyn restores Pug&#x27;s powers and they find Gamina imprisoned in a crystal cage in the underground ruins of the Temple of Dhatsavan. Gorath smashes the cage and, using a special pattern stone Pug has brought, the four of them return to Midkemia.

===Chapter IX: Mad Gods Rage===
In a flash of purple light, Pug, Owyn, and Gorath appear before James and Locklear in the Dimwood and tell them to wait for Arutha and let him know that there is no magical threat to his army; Makala will be waiting for Pug at Sethanon. Pug, Owyn, and Gorath travel to the caverns beneath Sethanon and kill the Tsurani Great Ones (&quot;the Six&quot;) protecting the Lifestone Chamber. Gorath remains behind to protect the Oracle of Aal, which was incapacitated by Makala, while Pug and Owyn confront the magician. Makala believes that Pug was keeping the Lifestone hidden to use as a weapon and wants it destroyed, but Pug refuses because it would release the Valheru souls trapped inside. Engaging Makala in a magical battle, Pug and Owyn eventually kill him.

Afterward, Gorath enters the chamber locked in combat with Delekhan. When Delekhan reaches for the Lifestone, Gorath tries to stop him and they begin to transform as the Valheru within try to escape. Pug and Owyn are forced to kill them both with a blast of magic in order to prevent the Valheru from being released. Returning above ground, Pug creates magical illusions of Murmandamus and Delekhan which are then incinerated by the Oracle of Aal. Having seen their leaders killed, the moredhel retreat, during which Narab kills Delekhan&#x27;s son Moraeulf, fulfilling his plans for taking over the moredhel. Owyn is left alone with Pug, who reveals that since Owyn now knows about the Lifestone, Pug must ensure that the secret is safe and suggests that Owyn become one of his students at Stardock. Owyn laughs and replies that he&#x27;s never wanted anything else.

==Development==
Although the game was licensed from Raymond E. Feist, a long-held myth was that the text and the story of the game were actually created by Feist himself. Feist states in his afterword to &quot;Krondor: The Betrayal&quot; that he was busy writing &quot;The King&#x27;s Buccaneer&quot; during the game&#x27;s production and that the plot, text, and new characters were created solely by designers Neal Hallford and John Cutter. Feist did have editorial final say on the game, but most of what Hallford and Cutter created was left intact.

===Technical details===
The game runs in 256-color 320x200 VGA mode. The graphics engine uses textured 3D graphics to draw the terrain and uses sprites for most of the detailed objects. The engine does not support multilevel terrain as such, but obstacles such as hills and mountains are supported. Most shops, inns, temples, special locations, and large cities are navigated through pictures usable through hotspots, while smaller towns have 3D buildings.

NPC and character art is based on photographs. Environments are a mix of captured images and hand-drawn. In combat and puzzle screens, all characters are animated, except for movement - characters do not appear to move their legs while walking. The game models illuminate to a certain extent: in the overworld, day and night are modeled, and in underground locations, the player needs to use a torch or a light spell to illuminate their surroundings.

The game runs in protected mode, using Borland C++&#x27;s Ergo DPMI / RTM DOS extender. It remained quite compatible with Microsoft Windows up to the 9x series and works very well in DOSBox and VDMSound. A playable version for Mac OS X DOSBox is also available. xBaK is a game engine recreation which allows &quot;Betrayal at Krondor&quot; to be played natively under the X Window System, using the original data files.

===Release history===
The following commercial editions of the game have been released:

* 1993: The original 3½&quot; floppy disk release.
* 1994: CD-ROM edition, which includes Red Book CD-audio versions of the original game&#x27;s MIDI music tracks, a 5-minute video interview with Raymond E. Feist, and a Windows hint program/package.
* 1996: Re-release of the CD-ROM in Sierra&#x27;s SierraOriginals budget line.
* 1997: free download on Sierra&#x27;s website to promote the game &quot;Betrayal in Antara&quot;, though this version is no longer available.
* 1998: CD-ROM edition (but without the CD-audio soundtrack) that came with the hardcover edition of &quot;Krondor: the Betrayal&quot;, with a PDF manual and video interview with Feist, promotional materials and a trailer for &quot;Return to Krondor&quot;.
* 2010: CD-ROM edition re-released on GOG.com as a downloadable file.

Contrary to popular belief, Vivendi Universal Games has stated that the game is not free to be redistributed by others.

===&quot;Krondor: The Betrayal&quot;===
Feist later wrote &quot;&quot;, a novelization of the game and the first in a series of new Midkemia books called &quot;The Riftwar Legacy&quot;. Feist credited Hallford and Cutter as co-authors of the original story for &quot;Krondor: the Betrayal&quot;, and dedicated the book to both of them.

The game and book are set approximately halfway between &quot;A Darkness at Sethanon&quot; and &quot;Prince of the Blood&quot;. There are minor differences, such as Owyn&#x27;s last name being Belefote rather than Beleforte and the towns of Tanneurs and Eggley are changed to Tannerus and Eggly, but the novel largely covers the main plot of the game accurately and ignores most of the sidequests.

The game first introduced Lysle Rigger, Jimmy the Hand&#x27;s long lost twin brother as well as Kat and Abbot Graves, whose granddaughter was Katherine &quot;Kitty&quot; Graves. Both Lysle Rigger and Kitty Graves would play significant roles in Feist&#x27;s Serpentwar novels.

==Reception==

Sales of the original 3½&quot; floppy disk release were slow, leading Sierra to sell the &quot;Riftwar&quot; rights back to Raymond Feist, but the game became a hit when it was re-released on CD-ROM.

Jim Trunzo reviewed &quot;Betrayal at Krondor&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #38 (1993), giving it a final evaluation of &quot;Excellent&quot; and stated that &quot;&quot;Betrayal at Krondor&quot; employs one of the easiest and most intuitive interfaces encountered, one that conveniently handles all aspects of the game, from trading to casting magic spells to combat. Graphics and sound are top-notch, character development is logical an fair, combat is beautifully animated, and I have yet to find anything about the game that I don&#x27;t like. There simply isn&#x27;t any facet of the game that isn&#x27;t outstanding.&quot;

&quot;Pelit&quot; gave &quot;Betrayal at Krondor&quot; a 94% score, calling the game citing &quot;the wonderful game system, lack of bugs, and the book-like atmosphere&quot; and said &quot;Krondor is as big a revolution in turn-based role-playing games as the &quot;Underworld&quot;s were in 3D role-playing games.&quot; &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in October 1993 called &quot;Krondor&quot; &quot;a fantasy role-playing game unlike any other ... a new high-watermark in RPG design&quot;. While noting that the graphics &quot;are not going to knock players out of their chairs&quot;, the magazine praised combat as &quot;the best I&#x27;ve seen in a fantasy CRPG&quot;. It concluded that the game was &quot;a rare gem ... and has set new standards for others to follow. For once, a game actually lives up to, even exceeds, its advance billing&quot;. A less enthusiastic review by Sandy Petersen appeared in November 1993 in &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine #199 in the &quot;Eye of the Monitor&quot; column, in which he gave the game two stars out of five. Though Petersen praised the graphics for being &quot;well-rendered&quot; at times and for its &quot;rather entertaining plot&quot;, he chastised the gameplay for being slow and for subjecting the player to &quot;dull maintenance activities&quot;, such as armor polishing, as well as quests that he found frustratingly hard to understand how to complete. Quandary gave it a 4.5/5 in its 1996 review, calling it &quot;no ordinary role-playing game&quot; with its &quot;complex&quot; immersive environment, traps, and riddles replacing &quot;the usual pits and levers and rolling rocks that are more common in role-playing dungeons.&quot; They also called the strategic turn-based combat &quot;very satisfying&quot; though &quot;it takes a little getting used to.&quot;

&quot;Betrayal at Krondor&quot; was named 1993&#x27;s best role-playing game and overall &quot;Game of the Year&quot; by &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot;. In June 1994 &quot;Betrayal at Krondor&quot; won &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s Role-Playing Game of the Year award. The editors wrote that it &quot;is the quintessential example of how a computer game should be built from a fantasy novel&quot;, stating that they thought it took the most creative risks while readers liked &quot;its play value and non-linear story&quot;. The magazine ranked &quot;Krondor&quot; #43 on their list of the 150 best games of all time in the magazine&#x27;s November 1996 Anniversary Edition. The magazine added the game to its Hall of Fame in 2001, saying that &quot;Krondor&quot; was the &quot;first role-playing game to offer a 3D environment and...one of the first games to use digitized images effectively in the context of a role-playing game.&quot; In 1994, &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; named &quot;Betrayal at Krondor&quot; as the 31st best computer game ever. The editors hailed it as &quot;a pivotal title in the evolution of role-playing games&quot;, praising its &quot;interactive plot and characters that stir the emotions of the player.&quot; The magazine later included it on its 1997 &quot;The Best 50 Games of All-Time&quot; list. In 1998, &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; declared it the 44th-best computer game ever released, and the editors called it &quot;a classic that will last through the ages.&quot;

<text>Beaumanor Hall is a stately home with a park in the small village of Woodhouse on the edge of the Charnwood Forest, near the town of Loughborough in Leicestershire, England. The present hall was built in 1842–1848 by architect William Railton and builder George Bridgart of Derby, for the Herrick family, with previous halls dating back to the 14th century, and is a Grade II* listed building It was used during the Second World War for military intelligence. It is now owned by Leicestershire County Council as a training centre, conference centre and residential facility for young people.

== Beaumanor Park history ==
Following the Norman Conquest, the land in the area was owned by Hugh d&#x27;Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester. In the 13th century ownership passed to the Despenser family, who created a deer park and hunting lodge at what is now Beaumanor. In 1327 the land passed to Henry de Beaumont, for whom a new house, Beau Manor was built in 1330, Beaumont also having the nearby church built in 1338. The house was replaced by a new construction in 1595 for Sir William Herrick, a government official under Elizabeth I and later a member of parliament for Leicester. The house was extensively altered around 1610, and stood until 1725, when it was replaced by a smaller house, completed in 1726. The third hall was demolished in 1842, and the present hall built for William Herrick over a seven-year period between 1842 and 1848 by William Railton in the Jacobean style. The hall was constructed using stone from Derbyshire quarries, primarily Duffield and Ashover, with floors of marble from Ashford. When completed, the building had cost £37,000.

==The Herrick family==
William Perry Herrick (1794 – 1876) who built the present house in about 1850 was born in Wolverhampton in 1794. His father was Thomas Bainbrigge Herrick who was a barrister and his mother was Mary Perry daughter of James Perry of Eardisley Park. William spent his childhood in his family home Merridale House (now called Bantock House) in Wolverhampton. He went to Oxford and became a barrister. In 1832 his uncle who owned Beaumanor died and as he had no male heirs the property was inherited by William. He also inherited Earlisley Park in 1852 when his maternal uncle James Perry died. These properties and their associated landholdings made him a very wealthy man.
He lived with his younger sister Mary Ann Herrick (1796-1871) at Beaumanor for many years. Mary Ann had inherited money from her mother in her own right and was known to be a great benefactor. An account of her generosity was contained in a book about Leicestershire. It stated:

:&quot; &quot;Many were the gifts made to the church by this benevolent lady; to give an account of them is impossible. The best known examples of her munificence are the almshouses at Woodhouse, built in 1856; a house for the schoolmaster and mistress at Woodhouse Eaves, built in 1860; the infant school in the same parish, built six years later; and the dispensary at Loughborough, built in 1862, at a cost of 5000 pounds; the expense of the last two benefactions being shared by her brother, William Perry Herrick, Esq., of Beaumanor.&quot;&quot;

William also gave generously to the Anglican Church. In 1872 he paid for the construction of St Marks Church in Leicester with some help from his sister.

In 1862 William married Sophia Christie (1831-1915) who was 37 years his junior and the daughter of Jonathan Henry Christie, a London barrister. The couple had no children. His sister Mary Ann who continued to live at Beaumanor died in 1871 and William died in 1876. He left all of his property to his wife Sophia and on her death to his relative Montagu Curzon.

Sophia managed the Beaumanor estate for the next 40 years and was well regarded by the tenants. She kept a fairly large number of household staff one of whom was Elizabeth Ellerbeck (1843 – 1919) the housekeeper who remained with her for over 30 years.

Sophia died in 1915 and Beaumanor was inherited by William&#x27;s relative William Montagu Curzon who took the additional surname of Herrick in 1915 when he became owner of Beaumanor.

William Montagu Curzon Herrick (1891-1945) was born in 1891 in London. His father was Colonel Montagu Curzon who was named by William Herrick as his heir when his wife Sophia died. In 1898 shortly after Sophia built Garatshay which is near Beaumanor, the family moved to this residence. Unfortunately Montagu died in 1907 and did not gain his inheritance. His wife Esme remarried the Reverend King and the family continued to live at Garatshay.

Shortly after William inherited Sophia&#x27;s property he married Maud Kathleen Cairns Plantagenet Hastings (known as Kathleen) who was the daughter of the 15th Earl of Huntingdon.

In 1923 a wedding was held at Beaumanor which was widely reported in the newspapers. It was the marriage between Dorothy Hastings the cousin of Kathleen and the Queen&#x27;s nephew Lord Eltham. One newspaper gave the following description of the wedding.

:&quot;&quot;The bride who was given away by her father wore a cream satin dress with a long trail of orange blossom on the left side, long tight fitting sleeves, train of cloth of gold and Brussels lace veil (heirloom of the bridegroom&#x27;s family). She carried a bouquet of deep cream roses and wore a pearl ribbon with a diamond pendant, the gift of the Queen.&quot;

:&quot;&quot;She was attended by two bridesmaids who were attired in powder blue satin, veiled with heavy silver lace, powder blue sleeves and belt of chiffon. They carried arum lilies and wore diamond arrows, the gift of the bridegroom.&quot;
William and Kathleen held frequent house parties at Beaumanor and one of them hosted in 1926 is shown in the photograph.

Until just preceding the Second World War in 1939, the Herrick family owned the park. The estate consisted of Beaumanor Hall and 6,500 acres of land, including several farms, Beacon Hill, the Hangingstone Rocks, St Mary&#x27;s in the Elms church, the vicarage house (Garats Hay), workers houses/cottages along Forest Road and 350 acres (1.4 km²) of parkland.

In 1939 the War Office requisitioned the estate, including Garats Hay, and the vicar moved to a cottage in the village.

The park became a secret listening station where encrypted enemy signals (Morse code) were intercepted and sent to the famous Station X at Bletchley Park (by motorcycle every day) for decoding. Beaumanor Park was to be the home of the War Office &#x27;Y&#x27; Group for the duration of the war.

After the war (1945) the estate passed back to the Herrick family, and on the death of William Montague Curzon-Herrick, the Beaumanor estate passed to Lt. Col. Assheton Penn Curzon Howe Herrick, who in 1946, for financial reasons (death duties, etc.), decided to dispose of his assets. In a sale conducted at the Town Hall in Loughborough on 20–21 December 1946, the War Office bought both Beaumanor Hall and Garats Hay and some of the immediate surrounding grounds used during the war.

=== Beaumanor Hall history 1939–1970 ===
From 1939 the hall itself was occupied by Number 6 Intelligence school, and the rooms inside Beaumanor Hall were used as a training centre for the Civilian Staff of the Post Office, Civil Service and Merchant Navy. The Royal Corps of Signals, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force were also having military staff trained inside the hall.

The huge cellars stretching underneath the whole of the building were used as electricians&#x27; workshops. The outbuildings and stables at the side and rear of the hall were used as workshops. These housed aerial riggers, a barracks store, M T Office, transport garage workshop and the instrument mechanics&#x27; laboratory.

By late 1941, most of the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force military personnel had left for duties at other Y-stations, and the main part of the site became the home of the Royal Signals. Military personnel were still being trained inside the hall for various tasks until the end of the war. In February 1942 the first of the newly trained ladies of the Auxiliary Territorial Service arrived at Beaumanor and were billeted in outlying villages and Garats Hay hall. Beaumanor became one of the most important of the small number of strategic intercept stations, or &quot;Y stations&quot;, intercepting enemy radio transmissions and relaying the information to &quot;Station X&quot;, at Bletchley Park, for decryption and analysis. It is known that one of the first confirmations of the successful Operation Chastise mission was received here. It is also widely rumoured that this listening post knew details of the Katyn massacre as early as 1941; however, the British government files were not released to the public, as it would implicate surviving perpetrators.

By 1943, Room 61 on the top floor of the hall was being used for Radio fingerprinting (Ackbar 13). This new technology was employed to uniquely identify the particular wireless set that was being used to send the transmissions.

Special receiving sets filmed the signals as they came in, like a cathode ray tube, and then the signals were captured on film and developed. Light tables were then used to compare the signals in order to verify who was sending them. A civilian from military intelligence at Bletchley Park was in charge of this room.

The Radio Direction Finding records room was next door and kept records of the signals&#x27; exact locations of origin.

In 1940 the use of the hall for all of these different functions allowed for the required specially designed wireless set rooms to be constructed in the grounds of the hall. This was instead of converting the existing rooms within the building for this purpose. A field to the north of the hall was chosen as the ideal location to construct the new set huts.

In the mid-1970s the hall was bought by Leicestershire County Council, developing quickly into a busy Conference and Education Centre.

===The operational huts===
The War Office Y Group had acquired an architect who worked as part of the local staff at Beaumanor, and he was tasked with designing the set rooms and other buildings. These were to be disguised and fitted into their surroundings by being made to look like normal outbuildings associated with a country house. This form of disguise is almost unique to Beaumanor; among other sites the military used during the war only Bomber Command Headquarters at RAF High Wycombe was disguised in this way.

A twenty acre (8.1 ha) field to the north of the hall was chosen as the appropriate site to build the required operational set rooms (huts). The huts were spaced far enough apart to avoid collateral damage should a bombing raid occur. Each hut was brick-built with blast walls, and then a disguising outer covering was put over it.

The huts were disguised in different ways: one to look like a cart shed with barn (J), two to look like cottages (H&amp;I), the fourth to look like stables (K), the fifth disguised as a glasshouse (M) block, and the sixth, Hut G, as a cricket pavilion complete with a false clock tower.

To give them an identity, the huts were each given a letter of the alphabet. The four huts around the perimeter of the field were lettered H, I, J and K. These huts were to be the four set rooms, which housed the wireless receivers for intercepting messages.

All of the cables and aerial feeds were located in underground ducts. Each hut had a pneumatic tube for sending the handwritten, received messages to G hut via a cylinder, which was shot down the tube. This tube system was also underground and out of sight.

In order to carefully conceal them, the other huts were given wooden exteriors and located in the wooded area to the rear of the hall on its western side. These huts were lettered A, B, C, D, E and F.

The wireless listeners were uniformed women of the ATS (Auxiliary Territorial Service), who had been trained on the Isle of Man. They intercepted German and Italian messages, many of which had been enciphered on Enigma machines. It was the most difficult of signals intelligence gathering, because the enciphering meant that no prediction was possible. Once gathered, the intercepts were sent by motorcycle courier to Bletchley Park, for decryption. Collectively, the women who worked at Beaumanor were known as the WOYGians.

<text>Pathare Prabhu is one of the Hindu communities found mainly in the Indian state of Maharashtra.

==Introduction==

The Pathare Prabhus and the Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhus (CKP) are considered sister communities, both being part of the &#x27;Prabhu caste&#x27;.
Both Pathare Prabhu and CKP follow the Advaita Vedanta Smarta tradition of Hinduism propounded by Adi Shankara.

Along with all the Maharashtrian Brahmin castes and the CKP, they are considered one of the &#x27;high&#x27; or &#x27;elite&#x27; castes of Maharashtra.

The Pathare Prabhu, in the 19th century would to refer to Mumbai (then known as Bombay) as &#x27;Desh&#x27; (country). They formed the &quot;Union Club&quot; under which were the five primary collectives of Girgaon, Mazagaon, Parel, Mahim and Worli. In 1887, they held a meeting at the &quot;Desh&quot; level in which it was decided to stop inviting &quot;naikins&quot; (dancers) to sing at the Upanayana (thread ceremonies or &quot;munja&quot;) and marriage celebrations. Historians cite an incident where a Pathare Prabhu member who broke this rule two years later was socially outcast by the community. He sued for defamation but the British Court ruled against him.

==Notable people==
*Moroba Kanhoba – 19th century writer and social reformer (women&#x27;s rights advocate), author of the famous Marathi novel &quot;Ghashiram Kotwal&quot;. His highly publicized marriage to a widow ended in a tragedy after the couple was found dead within a year of the marriage.
*Shivkar Bapuji Talpade – allegedly flew an unmanned heavier-than-air aircraft in 1895, this pseudohistorical claim was made by Hindu nationalists.
*Atmaram Sadashiv Jayakar – Notable zoologist, physician, naturalist and explorer. Best known for his scientific study on animals and medical surveys of Oman. He described some unknown species like Arabitragus jayakari, Hippocampus jayakari and Omanosaura jayakari, all named after him. He also studied the Omani dialect of Arabic.
*Mahadev Vishwanath Dhurandhar – Well known Indian painter and artist.
*Kanhoba Ranchoddas Kirtikar – Notable botanist, surgeon and Marathi poet.
*Mukund Ramarao Jayakar – First vice chancellor of the University of Pune.
*Raobahadur Narayan Dinanath Velkar (1798–1870) – 19th century social reformer, and first Native Municipal Commissioner of Bombay city and one of the founders of &quot;The Times of India&quot;.

<text>A.G. Barr p.l.c, commonly known as Barr&#x27;s, is a Scottish soft drink and energy drink manufacturer based in Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire, Scotland widely known for manufacturing the drink Irn-Bru. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.

== History ==

The company was founded in 1875 by Robert Barr in Falkirk. In 1887, his son, Robert Fulton Barr, set up a division of the original company in Glasgow, which had a much larger population. In 1892 the Glasgow branch passed to Andrew Greig Barr (where the name A.G. Barr comes from), a brother of the branch&#x27;s founder. In 1899, they soft launched Irn-Bru, eventually launching it in 1901. The Falkirk and Glasgow divisions merged in 1959, and the company was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1965.

In 1972, A.G. Barr acquired the Tizer brand. In 2001 the company acquired Findlays Mineral Water which is sourced in the Lammermuir Hills. In 2002, Roger White joined A.G. Barr as managing director, and in 2004 became the first chief executive from outside the Barr family.

The company acquired Forfar-based Strathmore Mineral Water in May 2006. The Irn-Bru 32 energy drink variant was launched in 2006. In 2008, the company purchased the Taut sports drink range, and exotic fruit drink company Rubicon.

In November 2012, the company agreed to merge with Britvic, which produces drinks like J2O, Tango and Robinsons, as well as holding the authority to produce Pepsi for the UK market, to create one of Europe&#x27;s largest soft drinks companies. The merger was abandoned in July 2013.

The company acquired a cocktail mixer business, Funkin, in February 2015.

In December 2022, the company acquired Boost Drinks for £20 million from founders Simon and Alison Gray. The company also took full control of Moma Foods at that time.

In October 2023, it was announced A.G. Barr had acquired the Rio Tropical Limited soft drinks brand from the independent brewer and pub company, Hall and Woodhouse Limited, for £12.3 million.

== Legal disputes ==
On 14 July 1961, the Coca-Cola Company asked Lord Walker for an interim interdict about the type of bottle used by A.G. Barr&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Kolabar&quot;, &quot;Cydrap&quot; and &quot;Stilkrush&quot;&quot; in the Court of Session. Coca-Cola&#x27;s argument was that &quot;real danger that the bottle used by [A.G. Barr] for containing Kolabar will be mistaken by the public for [Coca-Cola].&quot;, while A.G. Barr&#x27;s argument was &quot;the position of Coca-Cola in the soft drinks industry in Scotland is insignificant in comparison with that of [A.G. Barr]&quot;. Lord Walker refused the interim interdict, as a large part of their business could&#x27;ve been disturbed, additionally because Coca-Cola made no sales in the country at that point.

==Operations==
A.G. Barr produces a variety of soft drinks from production sites at Cumbernauld, Forfar and Milton Keynes. Irn-Bru was launched in 1901.

<text>Trax is a two-player abstract strategy game of loops and lines invented by David Smith in 1980.

The game is played with a set of identical square tiles. One side of the tile has red and white straight lines and the other red and white curves.

==History==

Trax was invented in 1980 by David Smith, a chartered accountant in Christchurch, New Zealand. Smith published five games between 1970 and 1980, including &quot;Chess Cards&quot;, a variant of chess in which players could choose to either draw a card (with a chess piece printed on the obverse) or move a card already in play according to the revealed piece&#x27;s rules. &quot;Chess Cards&quot; featured &quot;boardless&quot; play; once drawn, the card could be played onto any flat surface, subject to additional rules that would prevent playing the cards into isolation from the cards already in play. In November 1980, Smith began to develop the boardless aspect of &quot;Chess Cards&quot; with a more original, abstract game, which led to Trax. He quickly developed the idea of two coloured paths, but discovered that play could stop if three edges had the same colours, leading to his breakthrough invention of the forced-play rule, approximately one week later on November 26.

The game was first published in New Zealand and the United States in 1982. Originally, the tiles were made out of cardboard and were red with black and white lines. As the game became more popular, the tiles were changed to high-density plastic using the same colors. The change to black tiles with red and white lines took place in 2005. 

In 1999, Microsoft Corporation selected Trax as one of the first proprietary games in its Internet Gaming Zone. For the 2015 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology in Queenstown, New Zealand, Trax was selected for the design competition for implementation using a field programmable gate array processor.

The reigning world champion is Donald Bailey, an engineering professor at Massey University in New Zealand. , with the exception of a loss in the 1994 final, he has won every Trax world championship since 1990.

==Gameplay==
TRAX is a two-player game that does not have a defined playing board, but any flat surface is suitable. For the commercial boxed versions of the game, 64 identical square, double-sided tiles are included. On one side is the cross/straight paths, where the colors connect opposite sides, and on the other side is the curved paths, where the colors connect adjacent sides. Rotating the tile by 90 degrees yields six possible orientations:

* Straight side: 
* Curved side: 

By mutual agreement, the players select a colour for their path, with the player selecting the white path making the first move. The first tile to be played is either (curved tile with white running top–left and red running bottom–right) or (cross tile with white running top–bottom and red running left–right). Each successive move is made adjacent to a tile in play; the colours of the track on the newly-played tile must link to the track on the adjacent tile in play. For example, the following sequence is a legal series:

The objective is to get a loop or line of your colour while attempting to stop your opponent from completing a loop in their colour.

TRAX includes a &quot;forced-play&quot; rule. If a tile played in any turn forms an adjacent space or spaces into which same coloured track enters from two edges, that same player must play an additional tile into each such space so as to join up the same coloured track, be it white or red, as part of that turn. A forced play may itself require further forced plays to be made. A turn is not complete until the only remaining spaces are either single edged spaces or two edged spaces entered by tracks of both colours. In the three-move example above, note that the White path player created a forced move with the third tile played and the fourth tile extended the path of the Red player.

An &quot;illegal move&quot; is one that creates an adjacent space into which the same coloured track enters from more than two edges. The entire turn must be replayed from the initial tile.

===Winning conditions===
A player wins when they form a &quot;loop&quot;, which is a continuous closed path of the player&#x27;s chosen color, or when they form a &quot;line&quot;, which is a continuous path of the player&#x27;s chosen color that extends for at least 8 rows or columns from one edge of the board to the opposite edge. Examples of each condition are given below.


If the result of a single turn (including forced moves) is that both players meet the winning criteria simultaneously, the player whose turn it was is declared the winner.

===Notation===

The turns in a game may be recorded in text format as a three-character code according to the position and type of the tile played. The first character denotes the column into which the tile was played, and the second character denotes the row. Columns are numbered successively from left to right as @, A, B, ..., Z, AA, AB, ..., AZ, BA, ... and rows are numbered successively from top to bottom as 0, 1, 2, 3, ... The third character denotes the type of tile played; symbols were chosen based on the general shape of the tracks. Crosses/straights are denoted by &quot;+&quot; and the curved tiles are denoted by the forward slash (&quot;/&quot;) or backslash (&quot;\&quot;) characters, which represent the direction of the diagonal of the corners between unconnected sides. The rotational orientation of the tile played is determined unambiguously by the tile(s) adjacent to where it was played, so the orientation of the tile played does not need to be specified using this nomenclature system. Similarly, the forced-play rule determines any additional tiles played during that turn, so the forced tiles do not need to be recorded.

However, because the first tile to be played determines the orientation (relative directions) of the game board, only two valid first moves are possible. The two valid first moves are:
* (denoted ), where the white track defines the top and left sides of the game board and the red track defines the bottom and right sides.
* (denoted ), where the white track defines the top and bottom of the game board and the red track defines the left and right sides.

The third possibility would be:
* (which would be denoted ) is not a valid first move. Since the white path on a curved tile defines the top and left sides, if the curved tile is played as the first move in this orientation, the playing field is rotated by 90° clock-wise and the move would still be recorded as .

In this notation system, because the @ column and 0 row are used for the leftmost empty column and topmost empty row, this &quot;origin&quot; point will change in the turn following a turn in which a tile was played (or forced) into the @ column or 0 row. For example, once the first move is made ( or ), that first tile becomes position A1 for the second turn, so if the second player plays a tile to the right of that first tile, the second move is recorded as , , or . The only legal moves for the second turn would be (to the left), (above), (below), or (to the right).

Prior to 1998, an alternative three-character notation system was used. The first two characters consist of a number and a letter, with the letter denoting the column (in order from left to right, A, B, C, ...) and the number denoting the row (in order from top to bottom, 1, 2, 3, ...). The third character is either S (when a straights/cross piece is played), C (when a curved piece is played as the first tile or against two edges), or U/D/L/R (depending on the track which being continued, either Up, Down, Left, or Right, respectively). The sequence of the first two characters are reversed when the tile is played above the tile in the top left corner, so for example A1&quot;x&quot; is played to the left of the tile in the top-left corner, while 1A&quot;x&quot; is played above that tile.

===Variations===
&quot;Loop Trax&quot; is a variant where the winning criterion is limited to closed loops only. Other variations include limiting playing board size (to 8×8, as &quot;Limited Tiles&quot; or 3×3, as &quot;Mini Trax&quot;). Originally, the game was limited to an 8×8 board because each set was supplied with 64 tiles; the variant &quot;SuperTrax&quot;, which removed the size limits, required the purchase of at least one additional set. With the advent of virtual play, &quot;SuperTrax&quot; has become the dominant variant.
==Example game==

This game was played between Donald Bailey (white) and Tom Seigenthaler (black) in early 1994. The cross/straights tile placed during the first move (as ) ended up in the final position of &quot;C7&quot;.

<doc id="831596" wikidata="Q4900993" url="?curid=831596" title="Bhandup">
<text>Bhandup (Pronunciation: ) () is a suburban locality in Mumbai, in the state of Maharashtra, India. The name &quot;Bhandup&quot; is derived from &quot;Bhandupeshwar&quot;, one of the names of the Hindu god Shiva. An old temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, the Bhandupeshwar Mahadev Mandir, is located in Bhandup (west) near Moti Bai Wadi IDUBS high school. Sonapur signal is north lead line on L.B.S. Marg and south is dockyard colony. Bhandup railway station is on the Central line of the Mumbai Suburban Railway network. A few fast trains stop at Bhandup station, mostly during the peak hours.

==History==

Bhandup is one of the oldest suburbs in Mumbai. It is home to Shivaji Talao, or Shivaji Lake, named after the Maratha ruler, Shivaji. Devotees of Ganapati immerse idols of the elephant god Ganesh at the lake during the months of August through September, as well as in Bhandupeshwar Kundh in Bhandup Village East near the Eastern Express Highway.

The earliest records of Bhandup come from 1803, and show the contemporary Bhandup estate to comprise Bhandup, Nahur and Kanjur Marg.

The Silaharas, also known as Shilahara, were the rulers of this region with partial Dravidian ancestry who later mixed with the Prakrit speaking Indo-Aryan locals of Konkan. The Silaharas promoted socio-economic progress in the 11th century around Bombay. To control the regions in Bombay and Thane, the built the &quot;Rajapatha&quot;, passing from the north of Bhandup, following the current Bombay-Thane road.

Historical records indicate that the distillery at Bhandup was one of the two biggest sources of liquor in the Bombay Presidency, the other being the Uran distillery.

Bhandup was also one of the first railway stations in India. The first train ran between Bori Bunder and Thane on 16 April 1853 with 400 passengers aboard 14 railway carriages, at 3:35 pm. It is said that the idea to connect Bombay with Thane and Kalyan occurred to Mr. George Clark, the Chief Engineer of the Bombay Government, on a visit to Bhandup in 1843.

However, Bhandup was not a part of Bombay until 1950, when the boundaries of the Bombay municipal corporation were extended up to Andheri on the western side and Bhandup on the eastern side.

==Demographics==
Bhandup falls within the S-ward, as defined by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai. The population of Bhandup has risen exponentially in the last twenty years.

*&quot;The discordance between population and density could be due to re-drawing of ward boundaries&quot;

The majority of residents of Bhandup are Hindus by religion. The dominant language is Marathi. Although a large percentage of the residents are natives of Maharashtra, in the last few decades, there has been a huge influx of non-native residents into Bhandup, reflecting the trend witnessed for Mumbai as a whole.

==Economy==
===Industry===
According to the 2001 census, there were 12,380 industrial establishments in Bhandup (S-Ward), providing employment to 36,921 residents of Bhandup. The rest of the employed populace are employed outside the limits of the S-ward.

One of the first industries to start in this area was Crompton Greaves in 1937, currently in Kanjur Marg. Currently, almost all of the industries in Bhandup are in Bhandup West, including CEAT Tyres, Asian Paints Ltd, BASF, and the Indian Smelting And Refining Company Limited. Apart from these big companies, there are several small-scale manufacturing units all over Bhandup West.

The presence of a large number of industries, coupled with large traffic flows throughout the day, led to Bhandup&#x27;s air is one of the worst in Mumbai in 1999. However, several of the polluting industries have moved out of Mumbai since, leading to slightly better air quality.
Bhandup has Asia&#x27;s biggest water filtration plant. The eastern sections of Kanjurmarg and Nahur blend into Bhandup without clear demarcation.

===Retail===
In recent years, several mall construction projects have been initiated in Bhandup. One reason for Bhandup being a prime location for malls is its proximity to affluent areas like Powai and Mulund. In the past few years, several industries in Bhandup have shifted or started shifting out of Mumbai, rendering vast tracts of land vacant. These land-plots are being used for the construction of huge residential complexes, in turn, providing the customer base for these malls.

Neptune Magnet Mall is a shopping mall that is part of a satellite township, Living Point, comprising six towers of 22 stories each being developed by Neptune group. Some of the other malls in the area include the Leo Mall and a shopping space being developed by HBS Centrix. Dreams the Mall, developed by Satra Properties, located close to Bhandup Railway Station, was one of the biggest malls in Bhandup. However due to multiple fires, the 1st occurring on 25-March-2021 in Sunrise Hospital with a loss of 11 lives and the 2nd incident on 04-March-2022 the Dreams mall is currently non operational. 

==Transport==
Bhandup is connected with the rest of the city through the road network. The arterial road of Bhandup West is the Agra Road i.e. L.B.S. Marg, while Bhandup East is flanked by the Eastern Express highway. Four buses (numbers 144, 453, 545 and 603), however, pass through Bhandup East, as the area is relatively sparsely populated. There is also a special bus service in the mornings for female commuters, going from Bhandup to Andheri. There is also a special State Transport Bus service in the morning which run between Bhandup and CWC (Navi Mumbai) and Navi Mumbai Municipal Transport Corporation runs a bus (route no 144) through Bhandup East which plies between Andheri East and Airoli.

Bhandup is also a railway station on the Central Line of the Mumbai Suburban Railway network, between KanjurMarg and Nahur.

==Schools==
There are over 35 schools in Bhandup. Notable schools include:
* NES High School and Junior College

===Colleges===
Bhandup has five major accredited colleges, out of which two are in Bhandup (East) and three in Bhandup (West). All of them are affiliated to the University of Mumbai. The breakup is as follows:

<text>Fitzroy High School is a state school catering for Years 7 to 10, located in Falconer Street, Fitzroy, Melbourne, Australia. The school was first opened in 1915, but closed in 1992. After a long community campaign, it re-opened in 2004.

==History==
The Fitzroy Central School as it was first known, opened for the 1915 school year, admitting students from Grades 5 to 8. In 1957, it received its current name, and was allowed to take students up to Year 12. In 1988, it merged with Exhibition High School, but retained its original site.

===Closure===

After coming to power in 1992, then-Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett embarked on an array of budget cuts in an attempt to restore the state&#x27;s flagging finances. As a result, the decision was made to close a significant number of schools across the state. Fitzroy High was one of the first to be earmarked for closure, and it shut down at the end of the 1992 school year.

After its closure, the local community feared that the site, which had been public land ever since 1871, would be sold for development. Community groups decided to occupy the site, in an attempt to prevent its sale, and in a widely publicised campaign, maintained a 24-hour vigil for fourteen months. People occupied the site in four-hour shifts, or slept overnight in the principal&#x27;s office or administration wing.

===Twelve years later, Fitzroy High reopens its doors===
In 1993, the state government finally struck a deal with the local community, and the Kangan Batman TAFE was allowed to use the site. They operated a campus at the site until 1998, when budgetary requirements forced it to close. The following year, they handed the site back to the Education Department. Around the same time, Jeff Kennett lost power, and was replaced by Steve Bracks, who was more supportive of their cause.

The site lay dormant for two years, until then-Education Minister Mary Delahunty approved plans to re-open the school for Years 7 to 10 in 2001. The site was significantly renovated, involving the construction of a new science and technology wing, a library and a food technology division.

During 2002, the school was used as a central filming location for the children&#x27;s series &quot;Short Cuts&quot;.

===Re-opening===
On 28 January 2004, the school re-opened, with 135 students in Years 7 and 8. It expanded to Years 9 and 10 in the 2005 school year, and plans were announced in December 2005 to begin classes for Years 11 and 12 in 2007 in conjunction with another Melbourne school, Collingwood College.

A building program, comprising a unique design to facilitate the school&#x27;s learning philosophy, was completed in 2009 to increase accommodation for up to 600 students in years 7–12. The new building has now won a number of design awards including the Dulux Colour and the Australian Institute of Architecture Victorian Chapter annual award 2010 -Public Alterations and Additions. The school was also short listed in the 2010 Premier Design Awards in Victoria.

=== New campus ===

Since the start of 2022, Fitzroy High School has opened a new campus, called the Wurun Senior Campus, that they are sharing with Collingwood College. Their original (and main) campus only hosts year 7-10 students.

===Notable alumni===

*Filmmaker Nadia Tass
*Invincibles Test Cricketer Neil Harvey
*Architect/developer Nonda Katsalidis 
*Cinematographer/director Vincent Monton 
*Actor George Spartels 
*Politician Lidia Thorpe (Years 7 and 9)

===Teachers===

Writer Helen Garner, former MP Caroline Hogg, former Lord Mayor of Melbourne John So, painter John Brack, and past director of the National Gallery of Australia James Mollison previously taught at the school.

<doc id="831609" wikidata="Q1713498" url="?curid=831609" title="Stepping switch">
<text>In electrical engineering, a stepping switch or stepping relay, also known as a uniselector, is an electromechanical device that switches an input signal path to one of several possible output paths, directed by a train of electrical pulses.

The major use of stepping switches was in early automatic telephone exchanges to route telephone calls. Later, they were often used in industrial control systems. During World War II, Japanese cypher machines, known in the United States as CORAL, JADE, and PURPLE, contained them. Code breakers at Bletchley Park employed uniselectors driven by a continuously rotating motor rather than a series of pulses in the Colossus to cryptanalyse the German Lorenz ciphers.

In a uniselector, the stepping switch steps only along or around one axis, although several sets of contacts are often operated simultaneously. In other types, such as the Strowger switch, invented by Almon Brown Strowger in 1888, mechanical switching occurs in two directions, across a grid of contacts.

==Single-axis stepping switches==

Stepping switches were widely used in telephony and industrial control systems when electromechanical technology was paramount.

A basic stepping switch is an electrically operated rotary switch with a single (typically input) terminal, and multiple (typically output) terminals. Like other typical rotary switches, the single terminal connects to one of the multiple terminals by rotating a contact arm, sometimes called a wiper, to the desired position. Moving from one position to the next is called stepping, hence the name of the mechanism. Using traditional terminology, this is a single-pole, multi-position switch.

While some stepping switches have only one pole (layer of contacts), a typical switch has more; in the latter case, all wipers are aligned and move together. Hence, one input with multiple wires could be connected to one of multiple outputs, based on the receipt of a single set of pulses. In this configuration, the rotating contacts resembled the head support arms in a modern hard disk drive. Multipole switches were common; some had perhaps as many as a dozen poles, but those were less common.

Most switches have a bank of stationary contacts extending over half a cylinder, while some have only a third of a cylinder. The typical &quot;half-cylinder&quot; switch has two sets of wiper contacts opposite each other, while the &quot;third of a cylinder&quot; type has three sets, equally spaced. For any given level, both or all three wipers are connected, so it makes no difference which of the two (or three) is connecting. When access to more outlets was required, the rotor had two sets of wipers opposite each other but offset vertically: on the first half rotation one set of outlets was accessed; the second set of outlets was accessed on the second half rotation.

An electromagnet advances (steps) the wipers to the next position when fed with a pulse of DC. The magnet&#x27;s armature (spring-loaded) operates a pawl that advances a ratchet. When the pawl reaches its full stroke, it blocks the ratchet so it and the wipers will not overshoot. When power to the coil disconnects, the spring retracts the pawl. Another pawl, sometimes called a detent spring, pivoted on the frame ensures that the wipers do not move backward; contact friction keeps them in place. Some uniselector designs step on application of the operate pulse; others step on its removal.

In most applications, such as telephony, it is desirable to be able to return the wipers to a &quot;home&quot; position; this is at the beginning of rotation, at one end of the array of fixed contacts. Some switches have a cam attached to the wiper shaft. This cam operates a set of contacts when the wiper is at home position, which is at the beginning of the span of rotation. Other circuit designs used one level (pole) of the contacts to home the wipers, so the separate homing contacts were not needed.

Typical stepping switches have contacts directly operated by the stepping magnet&#x27;s armature; these contacts can serve to make the magnet cycle (&quot;self-step&quot;) and advance the wipers as long as power is applied. The external control circuits remove power when the wipers reach the desired position; that could be the home position.

Most stepping switches rotate the wipers in only one direction, but some are bidirectional; the latter have a second magnet to rotate the wipers the other way. A third variety &quot;winds&quot; a spring as the wiper steps progressively, and a ratchet holds the wipers from returning to home position. When the circuit is no longer needed, another electromagnet releases the holding pawl; the spring then returns the wipers to their home position.

Stepping switches were quite noisy in operation (especially when self-stepping), because their mechanisms accelerated and stopped quickly to minimize operating time. One could compare their sound to that of some snap-action mechanisms. Nevertheless, they were engineered for long life, given periodic maintenance; they were quite reliable.

Single-axis stepping switches are sometimes known as uniselectors.

==Two-axis stepping switch==
Slightly more complicated was the &quot;two axis stepping switch&quot;, (also called &quot;Strowger switch&quot; or &quot;two motion selector&quot; in Britain). Typically, a single compact group of wipers could connect to one of 100 (or 200) different fixed contacts, in ten levels. When the switch was idle, the wipers were disengaged from the fixed contacts. The wipers moved up and down on a vertical shaft, and rotated into the contact bank to make a connection. A spring, internal to the vertical shaft, returned the wipers to their home position at the bottom.

This type had two stepping coils with pawls and ratchets, one to raise the wipers to the desired banks of contacts, and one to rotate the wipers into the banks. These were commonly used in telephone switching with ten banks of ten contacts. The coils were typically driven by the electrical pulses derived from a rotary telephone dial. On a two-motion selector, as a digit was dialed, the wipers would step up the banks, then automatically rotate (self-step) into the selected bank until they found an &quot;unused&quot; outlet to the next switch stage. The last two digits dialed would operate the connector switch (&quot;final selector&quot; in Britain). The second to last digit would cause the wipers to move up and the last digit would cause them to rotate into the bank to the called customer&#x27;s line outlet. If the line was idle then ringing voltage would be applied to the called line and ringing tone was sent to the calling line.

Another variant of the two-axis switch was the Stromberg-Carlson X-Y Switch which was quite common in telephone exchanges in the western USA. It was a flat mechanism, and the moving contacts moved both sidewise, as well as to and fro. It was quite reliable, and could be maintained by people with minimal training.

==Applications==

Stepping switches are used in a variety of applications, other than telephone systems. By connecting several in series with the highest output of one going to the stepping contact of the next, a counter could be constructed. Or by feeding the stepping contact with an endless pulse train via a relay, and controlling the relay from the switch&#x27;s own output, it can be made to automatically hunt for the first unpowered line (or powered, depending on whether the relay is normally open or normally closed). They could also be used as a demultiplexer, so that two input lines could control a number of output devices. One input line steps the switch until the correct device is selected, and the other then powers that device. Many other applications are possible.

Such switches were used in a series of Japanese cypher machines during World War 2: CORAL, JADE, PURPLE (the names were American). The British code-breaking machine called Colossus used rotary stepping switches, which was used to break the German Lorenz cipher.

<text>The plain-brown woodcreeper (Dendrocincla fuliginosa), is a sub-oscine passerine bird in subfamily Dendrocolaptinae of the ovenbird family Furnariidae. It is found in the tropical New World from Honduras through South America to central Brazil and in Trinidad and Tobago.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The plain-brown woodcreeper&#x27;s taxonomy is unsettled. The International Ornithological Committee (IOC) and the Clements taxonomy assign it these 11 subspecies:

*&quot;D. f. ridgwayi&quot; 
*&quot;D. f. lafresnayei&quot; 
*&quot;D. f. meruloides&quot; 
*&quot;D. f. deltana&quot; 
*&quot;D. f. barinensis&quot; 
*&quot;D. f. phaeochroa&quot; 
*&quot;D. f. neglecta&quot; 
*&quot;D. f. atrirostris&quot; 
*&quot;D. f. fuliginosa&quot; 
*&quot;D. f. rufoolivacea&quot; 
*&quot;D. f. trumaii&quot; 

BirdLife International&#x27;s &quot;Handbook of the Birds of the World&quot; (HBW) includes subspecies &quot;taunayi&quot; in the plain-brown woodcreeper. The IOC and Clements assign it to the plain-winged woodcreeper (&quot;D. turdina&quot;), which itself was once considered to be part of the plain-brown woodcreeper.

In the past some authors have treated &quot;atrirostris&quot; as a separate species. Subspecies &quot;meruloides&quot; has in the past been treated as a separate species and also as a subspecies of the white-chinned woodcreeper (&quot;D. merula&quot;).

This article follows the 11-subspecies model.

==Description==

The plain-brown woodcreeper is long. Males weigh and females . The species is a medium-sized member of its genus, with a straight medium-length bill and a slight crest. The sexes have the same plumage but females are smaller than males. The nominate subspecies &quot;D. f. fuliginosa&quot; has a narrow buff supercilium and a faint buff stripe under an otherwise grayish face. Its crown, nape, back, and wing coverts are dull olive-brown; its uppertail coverts and tail are rufous-chestnut. Its wings are rufous-chestnut with dusky outer edges and tips on the primaries. Its throat is pale gray to buffy with fine mottling. Its breast and belly are paler olive-brown than its back and with fine buff streaks on the former. Its undertail coverts are cinnamon-rufous and its underwing coverts cinnamon-buff to ochraceous. Its iris is yellowish brown to dark brown or pale gray, its bill black with whitish, yellowish, or gray edges and tip, and its legs and feet black, slate gray, dark brownish olive, or light blue.

The other subspecies of the plain-brown woodcreeper differ from the nominate thus:

*&quot;D. f. ridgwayi&quot;, more rufescent, less mottling and streaking, a less grayish throat, and a black bill
*&quot;D. f. lafresnayei&quot;, more olivaceous especially on the belly, less mottling and streaking, a grayer throat, and a blackish brown bill
*&quot;D. f. meruloides&quot;, quite rufescent, less mottling and streaking, little contrast between throat and breast, and paler mandible than maxilla
*&quot;D. f. deltana&quot;, less mottling and streaking, little contrast between throat and breast, and paler mandible than maxilla
*&quot;D. f. barinensis&quot;, darker and browner upperparts, less mottling and streaking, more dusky underparts, and paler mandible than maxilla
*&quot;D. f. phaeochroa&quot;, darker and more olivacous upperparts, less mottling and streaking, much whiter throat, and paler mandible than maxilla
*&quot;D. f. neglecta&quot;, darker and more olivacous upperparts than &quot;phaeochroa&quot;, paler underparts, less mottling and streaking, and paler mandible than maxilla
*&quot;D. f. atrirostris&quot;, more rufescent, bold supercilium, conspicuous streaks on crown, and paler mandible than maxilla
*&quot;D. f. rufoolivacea&quot;, duller and more olivaceous overall, less streaky neck
*&quot;D. f. trumaii&quot;, more greenish than all others, bold supercilium, conspicuous streaks on crown

==Distribution and habitat==

The subspecies of the plain-brown woodcreeper are found thus:

*&quot;D. f. ridgwayi&quot;, from northeastern Honduras through Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, western Colombia, and western Ecuador into northwestern Peru
*&quot;D. f. lafresnayei&quot;, northern and eastern Colombia and adjoining northwestern Venezuela
*&quot;D. f. meruloides&quot;, northern Venezuela, Trinidad, and Tobago
*&quot;D. f. deltana&quot;, the delta of the Orinoco River in northeastern Venezuela
*&quot;D. f. barinensis&quot;, north-central Colombia and west-central Venezuela
*&quot;D. f. phaeochroa&quot;, the Amazon Basin of southeastern Colombia, southern Venezuela, and northwestern Brazil
*&quot;D. f. neglecta&quot;, the western Amazon Basin on both sides of the Amazon River from eastern Ecuador and eastern Peru to the Rio Negro and Rio Madeira
*&quot;D. f. atrirostris&quot;, the southwestern Amazon Basin in southeastern Peru, northern and central Bolivia, and southwestern Brazil to the Rio Tapajós
*&quot;D. f. fuliginosa&quot;, the Amazon Basin north of the Amazon River in southeastern Venezuela, the Guianas, and northern Brazil between the Rio Negro and the Atlantic Ocean
*&quot;D. f. rufoolivacea&quot;, Brazil south of the Amazon River between the Rio Tapajós and the state of Maranhão
*&quot;D. f. trumaii&quot;, the upper Rio Xingu in Brazil&#x27;s Mato Grosso state

The plain-brown woodcreeper inhabits a variety of humid forest landscapes. It is most common in evergreen forest and occurs less frequently in deciduous and gallery forest, rainforest, and forest on sandy soils. It is occasionally found in mangroves. In the Amazon Basin it mostly inhabits &quot;terra firme&quot; and floodplain forests, and less frequently occurs in &quot;várzea&quot; and swamp forests. It mostly favors the interior of primary forest but is frequently found at its edges and in mature secondary forest. It is uncommon in young secondary forest, bamboo, and plantations. It is a bird of the lowlands and foothills, seldom occurring above . In elevation it is mostly found below in Honduras, in Costa Rica, in Colombia, and in Ecuador. It does reach near the Caribbean coast in Colombia and Venezuela.

==Behavior==
===Movement===

The plain-brown woodcreeper is a year-round resident throughout its range, though some local movements are suspected.

===Feeding===

The plain-brown woodcreeper mostly forages in the lower to mid-levels of the forest. Its diet is a wide variety of arthropods (mostly beetles and orthoptera) and also includes small vertebrates like lizards. It often follows army ant swarms to feed on prey fleeing the ants, but is not exclusively an ant-follower. It often forages alone, as a member of a mixed-species feeding flock, and by following South American coatis (&quot;Nasua nasua&quot;) and troops of monkeys . When attending an ant swarm it clings to a vertical trunk or vine, typically between above the ground. It makes brief flights to capture prey from other trunks and stems, foliage, the ground, and in mid-air. Away from ants it may perch higher or lower, and on horizontal branches.

===Breeding===

The plain-brown woodcreeper&#x27;s nesting season varies geographically, from May to October in Central America and apparently August to December in Amazonia. It builds a cup nest of dead leaves, plant fibers, and plant down at the bottom of a cavity in a stump, bamboo, or palm; it may first build up a deep cavity with moss. Pairs appear to bond only briefly and only females are known to incubate eggs and tend nestlings. The clutch size is one to three eggs. The incubation period is not known; fledging occurs 23 to 25 days after hatch.
===Vocalization===

The plain-brown woodcreeper&#x27;s song is variously described as a long whinny, rattle, or sputter. It has been put into words as &quot;&quot;Whee-hee-he-hah-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-hu-hu-hu-hu-hu-hu-hoo-hoo-hooh, wee-i-woo!&quot;, &quot;keé-keé-keé-kee-kee-kee-kew-kew-kew&quot;&quot;, and a &quot;long series of sweeping &#x27;weekweekweek---&#x27; notes&quot;. It makes a wide variety of calls; the most frequent are &quot;peeyk&quot; (or &quot;PWEEK!&quot;), &quot;stieek&quot;, and &quot;squeeeik&quot;. Others include &quot;sweeuh&quot;, &quot;chauhh&quot;, &quot;cheeng, cheeng&quot;, and &quot;pooo&quot;.

==Status==

The IUCN follows HBW taxonomy and so includes the plain-winged woodcreeper&#x27;s &quot;D. turdina taunayi&quot; subspecies in its evaluation of the plain-brown woodcreeper. It has assessed the species as being of Least Concern. It has an extremely large range and an estimated population of at least five million mature individuals, though the population is believed to be decreasing. It &quot;is considered highly sensitive to habitat fragmentation and human disturbance in at least parts of its range, and is likely to have suffered declines owing to deforestation&quot;. It is the most common and most widespread &quot;Dendrocincla&quot; woodcreeper. It is considered uncommon to locally common in most of its range, though it is scarce in the northernmost parts of it. It is thought &quot;less sensitive than are &#x27;professional&#x27; ant-followers in that its numbers may remain stable, at least over short term, in both selectively logged forest and all but the smallest forest fragments&quot;.

<text>In non-Asian countries, an Asian supermarket largely describes a category of grocery stores that focuses and stocks items and products imported from countries located in the Far East (e.g. East, Southeast and South Asia).

These stores go further than a typical quintessential supermarket in that they sell general merchandise, goods, and services related to specific Asian countries of origin, immigrant communities or the ethnic enclave that the store may be located in. 

They would also often tend to diversify by carrying products from other fellow Asian countries; Japanese supermarkets would carry some Chinese, Indonesian, Korean and Singaporean products; Korean supermarkets carry some Chinese and Japanese products; Taiwanese supermarkets carry Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese products, and so on.

==Overview==
Asian supermarkets carry items and ingredients generally well-suited for Asian cuisines and simply not found or considerably more expensive in most Western supermarkets, due to low turnover and small quantities.

While it primarily caters to a single particular Asian cultural group, many also additionally caters to other Asian immigrant groups who do not have easy access to foodstuffs from their country of origin. These are prevalent in Asian enclaves in the United States and Canada. Urban centers such as New York City, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., San Diego, Chicago, Houston, Dallas, Atlanta, San Francisco, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Seattle have Chinatowns, Little Indias, Little Saigons, Koreatowns, or Japantowns and other ethnic neighborhoods with specialty small business, but surrounding areas or smaller cities will have Asian supermarkets providing the same but reduced amenities for the same purposes.

Sometimes, these markets are surrounded by an Asian-themed strip mall. The markets are generally ethnocentric and may be mainly Chinese, Indonesian, Japanese or Filipino market; however, in many areas such supermarkets cater to a more diverse Asian population as a means of diversification and Pan-Asian cooperation. 

It is this diversity that led to the establishment of Pan-Asian goods in a one-stop shop with aisles selling foods in common and others dedicated to other groups such as Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Indian, Malaysian, Singaporean, Vietnamese, Thai, Taiwanese, Korean, and others. Some Asian supermarkets in Australia and the United States also stock Pacific food items aimed at the Pacific Islander communities in those countries. Similarly, some Asian supermarkets in the Netherlands stock items from Suriname aimed at the large Surinamese communities of Indian and Javanese origins found in the country. 

Despite sourcing from many multiple nations, items stocked are very different depending on their target ethnic market. For example, in Chinese and Vietnamese supermarkets it is common for animal meat to be hung on hooks for display; in Japanese supermarkets this is less common except for seafood. Chinese supermarkets may also carry Japanese products but the range of selection would be very limited as compared to a Japanese supermarket. For example, for green tea, in a Japanese market, an entire aisle may be dedicated to it, stocking a wide variety and grades of regional loose-leaf teas, whereas the Chinese market may simply carry a few brands of Japanese tea bags and bottled teas, while focusing on chrysanthemum tea.

==Chains==

Though most Asian supermarkets tend to be neighborhood-oriented, small and independent and may carry similar or even identical names, many large chains of stores have floor area that is comparable to other American supermarket chain stores. Among the largest of these chains is H Mart, which has 66 locations.

Major chains include:
* Chinese and Pan-Asian: Hong Kong Supermarket (US-6 locations), Kam Man Food (East Coast US), Hoo Hing (UK), Miracle Supermarket (Australia-New South Wales), Grand Asia Market (US), Nations Fresh Foods (Canada-Ontario), Lion Supermarket (US- Silicon Valley), zTao Marketplace (US-Texas, Georgia), G&amp;L Supermarket (Good Luck Plaza ) (Australia-New South Wales) Asian Foods (Australia-Queensland) iFresh Supermarket
* Filipino and Pan-Asian: Seafood City (US-25 stores, Canada-5 stores), Island Pacific Supermarket (US-California), Manila Oriental Market (US-California), Amazing Oriental (東方行) (Netherlands)
* Hmong and Pan-Asian: Shuang Hur Supermarket (3 stores in Minneapolis and Saint Paul, Minnesota
* Indian and Pan-Asian: Patel Brothers (US-54 stores), Subzi Mandi Cash &amp; Carry (US-10 stores, Canada-5 stores), Sabzi Mandi (Canada-7 stores), Panchvati Supermarket (Canada-5 stores), MKS Spices &#x27;N Things (Australia-Victoria), Asian Food Centre (Canada-7 stores), India Town Food Centre (Canada-2 stores).
* Japanese: Marukai (US, 14 stores), Nijiya Market (US, 12 stores), Mitsuwa Marketplace (US, 11 stores), Uwajimaya (Greater Seattle and Greater Portland, OR), Yaohan (defunct)
* Korean: H Mart (84 stores as of 2021), Zion Market (US, 6 stores), Assi Market (US, 3 stores), Arirang Supermarket (US, 2 stores), Galleria Supermarket (Canada-Greater Toronto), Oseyo (UK, 6 stores), Lotte Plaza (US, 14 stores)
* Taiwanese: 99 Ranch Market (US), T &amp; T Supermarket (Canada), 168 Market (US-California, Nevada, 6 stores)
* Vietnamese: Shun Fat Supermarket (US-15 locations)
* Indonesian: Maya Asian Market, currently 1 store in Lynnwood, Washington

===Online===
Due to concentration of immigrant communities in metropolitan areas, few Asian supermarket chain stores are located in non-metro areas. In order to better compete and serve this market, a few of these chains have begun online sales, which compete directly with the likes of general online e-commerce merchandisers such as Amazon.com, Walmart.com, Shopee and Rakuten.

===In Asia===
Major operators in Asia such as AEON, Don Quijote (Don Don Donki) and Jusco operate somewhat like Asian supermarkets, as they offer products not normally found in their home countries; as such they also serve as a platform for selling regional Asian cuisines and foods from their origin country. An example would be selling a Singaporean drink in Japan and vice versa, when they are both Asian countries.

==Operations==
Most of these supermarkets are started and operated by Asian immigrant entrepreneurs and their families. Others are started by investors of existing corporate conglomerates already headquartered in Asia, namely Mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan.

Asian supermarkets can range from small mom-and-pop grocery stores to large big-box stores and may cater specifically to one ethnic Asian immigrant group or to a wide pan-Asian crowd. They serve the generally unserved or underserved immigrant and descendant population. They are usually the main attraction for food shopping within overseas Asian shopping malls and Chinatowns. Asian supermarkets may re-occupy older buildings formerly anchored by mainstream regional or national supermarket chains.

 Chinese shopping centers and supermarkets have been constructed using traditional Chinese architecture, and provide services catered toward immigrant customers. Examples include Asian restaurants, beauty salons, bakeries, foreign film rental stores, travel agencies, book stores, and other businesses.

In recent years, some mainstream markets have attempted to compete with Asian supermarkets for the minority customer base by stocking certain Asian goods as well as directing marketing towards various Asian ethnic immigrant populations. Conversely, some Asian supermarkets attempt to appeal to the general population. Asian markets are reputed to have lower prices than the mainstream chains.

Asian supermarkets represent a new trend in which Asian immigrants no longer settle in old enclaves such as Chinatown, San Francisco but in suburbs where shopping centers provide services as well as cultural amenities, such as hosting ethnic festivals, shows and dance.

One of the major redevelopments highlighted in the press has been Buford Highway in the Atlanta suburb of Doraville, Georgia, where Asian supermarkets have done brisk business in a once-blighted neighborhood. Such supermarkets have also revitalized the once-rundown sections of Bellaire Blvd in Houston, Texas, and turned it into a thriving new Asian shopping district. There are also many competing Chinese supermarkets in the Southern California Chinatowns and Vietnamese markets anchoring communities such as Little Saigon.

<doc id="831647" wikidata="Q5870395" url="?curid=831647" title="History of the Scots Guards (1946–present)">
<text>The Scots Guards are a regiment of the British Army. The regiment takes part in numerous events, most notably the Beating Retreat, Changing of the Guard, Queen&#x27;s Birthday Parade, Remembrance Sunday and State Visits. The Guards&#x27; regiments ceremonial uniforms differ from each other only slightly, the differentiations being in the tunic and the type of plume on the bearskin, if any, they have. The Scots Guards uniform consists of tunic buttons in threes, the Order of the Thistle on the shoulder badge, the Thistle on the collar badge and no plume on the bearskin.

Throughout the latter half of the 20th century, the Scots Guards fought to preserve British colonialism by violently crushing pro-independence uprisings in Malaya, Ireland, Cyprus, and Uganda. In 1948 during the Malayan Emergency the Scots Guards committed the infamous Batang Kali massacre by executing the entire male population (24 innocent civilians) of a villiage near the Batang Kali river before falsely claiming that the victims were communist rebels of the Malayan National Liberation Army. The Scots Guards committed another killing of unarmed civilians, shooting dead an unarmed 18-year-old boy in the back during the McBride shooting.

==World War II history==

Both &quot;battalions&quot; were back in the UK by 1946, having returned from Germany and Trieste respectively. In 1948, the &quot;1st Battalion&quot; assumed the role of Guards Training Battalion, a role that lasted until 1951.

== The Malayan Emergency ==
The &quot;2nd Battalion&quot; of the Scots Guards, as a part of the 2nd Guards Brigade was deployed to Malaya in October to crush a communist led anti-colonial uprising known as the Malayan Emergency. The communist rebels, known as the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), were led by veteran anti-fascist and trade union leader Chin Peng, were a continuation of an earlier communist guerrilla force known as the Malayan Peoples&#x27; Anti-Japanese Army which was funded by the British to resist the Japanese occupation of Malaya.

== The Batang Kali Massacre ==
Several months after being stationed in Malaya, the Scots Guards committed atrocities by executing innocent and unarmed villagers and burning down civilian homes. This event became known as the Batang Kali massacre.

In December 1948, the Scots Guards surrounded a rubber plantation close to the Batang Kali river and rounded up the entire population of the village, approximately 50 people. Soon afterwards the Scots Guards began abusing the villagers and started psychologically torturing them by staging mock executions. After segregating the men from the women and children, the Scots Guards rounded up all the men and executed them all, with one exception who survived by playing dead. The Scots Guards had murdered 24 unarmed civilians, and afterwards burnt down the village after evicting all the women and children. Many of the bodies of those executed were found to have been mutilated.

The Batang Kali massacre has been described as both &quot;Britain&#x27;s My Lai&quot;, and the killings as &quot;one of the most contentious in British colonial history.&quot; In order to protect the Scots Guards, senior British diplomats introduced a &quot;license to kill&quot; law to legalise British colonial atrocities. Despite pleas from the families of the victims, British courts ruled against the families, citing that the year the massacre was committed. However British courts had conceded that the massacre had indeed taken place, after hearing witness testimonies from member of the Scots Guards, the victim&#x27;s families, and by examining declassified British military archives.

== The Cyprus Emergency and Suez Crisis ==
In late 1951, the &quot;1st Battalion&quot; deployed to Cyprus with the rest of the 32nd Guards Brigade, and in February the following year, the battalion deployed to the Suez Canal Zone after the Egyptian government abrogated the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936 which had given the British a base in the Suez Canal Zone, and was intended to expire in 1956. During its time in Egypt, the battalion performed a number of tasks, including the usual patrolling and guarding, which at times, tended to be monotonous and uneventful, though at others, such duties sometimes involved incidents which included coming under attack from Egyptians, including by snipers as well as rioting taking place. The battalion remained in Egypt until late 1954, when it, and the rest of the 32nd Guards Brigade, departed after a Treaty was signed between the two countries, which agreed that British and Egyptian technicians would maintain the base, and that a gradual phase-out of British forces in Egypt would begin, with the last British forces leaving Egypt in June 1956. During its time in Egypt the battalion suffered a single fatality.

== Reorganisation, African colonialism, and Borneo ==
Also in 1952, Queen Elizabeth succeeded to the throne, and became the &quot;regiment&#x27;s&quot; fifth Colonel-in-Chief since the first, King Edward VII, in 1901. Also in 1952, the regiment formed a new alliance with the 3rd Battalion, The Royal Australian Regiment, an alliance that remains intact as of 2004. In July 1953, the &quot;2nd Battalion&quot; deployed to West Germany to join the 4th Guards Brigade at Hubbelrath, part of the British Army of the Rhine, and returned home in 1957. That year the &quot;1st Battalion&quot; headed for Hubbelrath to join the 4th Guards Brigade and remained there until 1960 when it too returned home to the UK. In February 1962, the &quot;2nd Battalion&quot; arrived in Kenya where it joined the 24th Infantry Brigade. While there the battalion operated in support of the civil power there, which included in 1964, assistance during the mutiny of the 1st Battalion, The Kenya Rifles and in Uganda, sent a company to help in quelling the mutiny of the 1st Battalion, The Uganda Rifles, and the battalion departed Kenya that same year for home.

Elsewhere in 1964 the &quot;regiment&#x27;s&quot; alliance with the Canadian Winnipeg Grenadiers came to an end, ending an alliance that had existed since 1933. The Winnipeg Grenadiers would disband the following year. In late 1964 the &quot;1st Battalion&quot; deployed to Malaysia, which had only been formed the previous year, where it joined the 28th Commonwealth Brigade, and was based in Camp Terendak, Malacca. In 1965 the battalion undertook two tours in Borneo during the Indonesian Confrontation. The battalion&#x27;s time in Borneo was quite similar to the &quot;2nd Battalion&#x27;s&quot; experiences in the Malaysian mainland during the Malayan Emergency, with patrols being undertaken against Indonesian incursions in the dense jungle that covered Borneo. The following year the &quot;1st Battalion&quot; returned home from the Far East. That same year the &quot;2nd Battalion&quot; deployed to West Germany where it was based in Iserlohn as part of 4th Armoured Brigade and the following year moved to Munster, Germany.

==Actions in Northern Ireland==
The &quot;1st Battalion&quot; deployed for the first time to the Persian Gulf when it arrived in Sharjah, now part of the United Arab Emirates and left in late 1970. Also that year the &quot;2nd Battalion&quot; returned home from Germany and deployed on a short tour of Northern Ireland which would be one of many for the regiment, and especially so during the 1970s. In 1971 the &quot;2nd Battalion&quot;, due to defence cuts, was placed in &#x27;suspended animation&#x27; and two companies were retained, but the following year, due to the change of Government, the battalion was reformed. Also in 1971 the &quot;1st Battalion&quot; deployed to Ireland for the first time. Such deployments were difficult with troops being in constant danger from snipers and bombs, with patrols and guarding being the main routine duties. Their tour came to an end in December. During their deployment five men were lost to shooting and bombing incidents.

In 1972 the &quot;1st Battalion&quot; deployed to West Germany where it was stationed in Munster as part of 4th Armoured Brigade. That same year the recently reformed &quot;2nd Battalion&quot; undertook a tour of Northern Ireland and during its tour the battalion lost three of its men by gunfire. In May 1973 the &quot;1st Battalion&quot; deployed to Northern Ireland, leaving in September to return to its base in Germany. The &quot;2nd Battalion&quot; followed in late 1973 and suffered a fatality from sniper fire during its tour. In 1974 two members of the regiment lost their lives during an IRA bombing of two pubs in Guildford. Two members of the Women&#x27;s Royal Army Corps and a civilian were also killed and dozens were wounded.

In 1975 the &quot;1st Battalion&quot; deployed to Ireland yet again, though this time they did not suffer any fatalities during their four-month tour-of-duty and returned to Munster in August. The &quot;2nd Battalion&quot; arrived in Belize in Central America for a five-month deployment. In January 1976 the &quot;1st Battalion&quot; returned home from Germany while the &quot;2nd Battalion&quot; journeyed in the opposite direction, being based in Munster. Later that year the &quot;2nd Battalion&quot; deployed to Northern Ireland for another tour-of-duty fulfilling the usual roles of troops in Ireland before returning to Munster in January 1977. The &quot;1st Battalion&quot; arrived in Northern Ireland later that year for a very brief tour there. In August 1978 the &quot;1st Battalion&quot; returned again to Ireland for another four-month tour-of-duty. That year a member of the &quot;2nd Battalion&quot; was killed while working undercover for the 14th Intelligence Company in Northern Ireland. In March 1980 the &quot;1st Battalion&quot; deployed to Northern Ireland where it was stationed at Aldergrove for a deployment that would last until late 1981. The &quot;2nd Battalion&quot; joined the &quot;1st Battalion&quot; when it deployed to Northern Ireland in May 1980 for a five-month tour-of-duty. In late 1981 the &quot;1st Battalion&quot; left Aldergrove and deployed to Hong Kong in the Far East on a two-year posting.

==Falklands War==
On 2 April 1982, Argentina, then under a dictatorship led by General Galtieri, invaded the British territory of the Falkland Islands off South America. The British soon assembled a large array of Royal Navy (RN) warships, Royal Fleet Auxiliaries and merchant ships and headed south for Ascension Island. On 25 April, the island of South Georgia, off Antarctica was recaptured and on 1 May the RN Carrier Battle Group had entered the 200-mile (370 km) Total Exclusion Zone (TEZ) which had been placed around the Falklands. On 12 May the &quot;2nd Battalion&quot;, as part of the 5th Infantry Brigade (1st Battalion, The Welsh Guards, 1st/7th Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles), embarked aboard &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; (&quot;QE2&quot;), which had been requisitioned by the Government for use as a troopship, and departed Southampton for South Georgia. In the early hours of the 21 May D-Day began with 3 Commando Brigade (including two Para battalions) landing unopposed at San Carlos water and successfully established a bridgehead.

In late May the &quot;QE2&quot; arrived at her destination but because she could not be risked by moving her closer to the Falklands, most of 5th Brigade were transferred to the P &amp; O liner who would then take them to their destination. On 2 June, &quot;Canberra&quot; anchored in San Carlos Water, and subsequently the Guards were landed at San Carlos by LCU, a day after the 1st/7th Gurkhas had been landed by LCU from the ferry &quot;Norland&quot;. On 5 June the Scots Guards were embarked aboard the assault ship before being transferred to the ship&#x27;s four LCUs who transported them to Bluff Cove. On 8 Welsh Guards were aboard RFA &quot;Sir Galahad&quot; also waiting to be landed at Bluff Cove when &quot;Sir Galahad&quot; and RFA &quot;Sir Tristram&quot; were attacked by Argentinian Skyhawk fighters who proceeded to hit both ships. &quot;Sir Galahad&quot; was terribly hit and both ships caught fire, causing terrible casualties aboard &quot;Sir Galahad&quot;. Forty eight people, including thirty two Welsh Guards, were killed and many were wounded, many suffering from terrible burns. Unfortunately, only 200 survived.

On the morning of 13 June the &quot;Scots Guards&quot; were moved from their positions at Bluff Cove by helicopter to an assembly area near Goat Ridge near to their objective, Mount Tumbledown, which was defended by a crack Argentinian unit, the 5th Marine Infantry Battalion. On the night of the 13th the main force of the &quot;Scots Guards&quot; began its advance on the western side of Mount Tumbledown. During the course of the battle in the early hours of the 14th, men of the battalion launched a bayonet charge on the stout Argentinian defenders which resulted in bitter and bloody fighting, and was one of the last bayonet charges by the British Army. The battle raged on and by 8:00 am the final objective was taken and Mount Tumbledown was in the hands of the &quot;Scots Guards&quot;. The battle had been bloody, yet successful, and the battalion had proven the elite calibre and professionalism of the regiment in taking a well-defended mountain, defended by a top Argentinian unit, for it had been performing public duties back in London only a few months before. The &quot;Scots Guards&quot; casualties were eight &quot;Guards&quot; and one Royal Engineer killed, and forty three wounded. Their Argentinian opponents lost forty men and over thirty captured. See Battle of Mount Tumbledown.

On 14 June the Argentinian commander surrendered his forces of just under 10,000 men to the British, the war was over, though the end of hostilities would not officially be declared until 20 June. The following day, Juiliet Company (made up mostly of men of Naval Party 8901 who had defended the Falklands when it had been invaded) raised the Governor&#x27;s flag above Government House, it had been down for seventy four days; the Falklands was finally liberated. Most of 5th Brigade were moved back to Fitzroy and the &quot;Scots Guards&quot; were subsequently moved to West Falkland to await the arrival of the first garrison troops and eventually departed the Falklands for Ascension on &quot;Norland&quot; on 19 July. The battalion was subsequently returned home by air, being transported by RAF VC-10 aircraft. The regiment won a number of gallantry awards for their actions in the Falklands War. A single Distinguished Service Order (DSO) was won, being awarded to the &quot;battalion&#x27;s&quot; CO Lieutenant-Colonel Michael Scott. Also won by the battalion were two Military Crosses (MC), two Distinguished Conduct Medals (DCM) and two Military Medals (MM). The battalion was awarded two battle honours for its part in the war, &quot;Tumbledown Mountain&quot; and &quot;Falkland Islands 1982&quot;.

==Activity in the 1980s and 1990s==
In 1984 the &quot;1st Battalion&quot; returned from Hong Kong while the &quot;2nd Battalion&quot; did the opposite and left for abroad, being deployed to the Sovereign Base Area, Cyprus where the battalion would remain until February 1986 when it returned home. In June the &quot;1st Battalion&quot; took part once more in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Parade, a parade which was the last time Queen Elizabeth rode on horseback during the parade. In September the &quot;1st Battalion&quot; deployed to Ireland on an emergency tour that lasted until January 1987 The &quot;1st Battalion&quot; was presented with new Colours by Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace and the regiment also takes part in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Parade. In October the &quot;2nd Battalion&quot; deployed on the usual tour of NI, a tour that lasted until February 1988. That same month, the &quot;1st Battalion&quot; deployed to Hohne, West Germany where it joined the 22nd Armoured Brigade.The &quot;2nd Battalion&quot; also deployed abroad, when it took part in mechanised infantry exercises in the BATUS, Canada which lasted for 6-weeks. Also that year the &quot;2nd Battalion&quot; was presented with new colours by the Queen at Hopeton House, Edinburgh In 1989 the &quot;1st Battalion&quot; deployed on an emergency tour of East Tyrone, NI, a tour that lasted for about 4 months. The &quot;2nd Battalion&quot; also deployed abroad, to Canada where they took part in 6-week exercises at the BATUS.

The first year of the 1990s brought much of the same for the &quot;Scots Guards&quot; when the &quot;1st Battalion&quot; departed for 6-weeks of exercises at BATUS, Canada. The &quot;1st Battalion&quot; did gain new equipment that year when it converted from the FV432 to the much more capable Warrior APC. In March the &quot;2nd Battalion&quot; arrived in Northern Ireland for another tour, and during that year the regiment suffered one fatality in Ireland.

In November 1990, commanded by Lt. Col. Price, the Regimental Band of the Scots Guards set off to the Gulf to take part in Operation &quot;Granby&quot;. The band served in 33 Field Hospital in Kuwait as medics on various wards, as well as providing musical entertainment at the British ambassadors residence as well as playing for the coffins as they returned home. Musicians of the Scots Guards band can still be seen wearing their medals today. The &quot;1st Battalion&quot; also deployed to the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Granby, the British contribution to the war against Saddam Hussein, for which the battalion was awarded the theatre honour &quot;Gulf 1991&quot;. That same year the &quot;2nd Battalion&quot; took part in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Parade.

Other events in 1992 for the regiment included the &quot;2nd Battalion&quot; providing the Royal Guard at Balmoral Castle, participating in the Edinburgh Military Tattoo, in which the regiment has participated in many times. Also that year the regiment celebrated at Holyrood Palace, the 350th Anniversary of the &quot;regiment&#x27;s&quot; creation. In 1993 the &quot;2nd Battalion&quot; took part in 6-week exercises at BATUS in Canada but on 4 November, due to defence cuts, the battalion was placed in &#x27;suspended animation&#x27; and a single company (&quot;F Company&quot;) was formed for public and other duties. In 1994 the &quot;1st Battalion&quot; deployed on a tour of Ireland that lasted for 6-months. The following year saw the &quot;1st Battalion&quot; take part in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Parade and deploy to Canada for 6-weeks of exercises at BATUS. In 1996 the battalion deployed once more to Ireland and the following year the regiment takes part in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Parade. In 1998 the &quot;1st Battalion&quot; deployed to Abercorn Barracks at Ballykinler, Ireland on a 2-year posting and returned home.

===The McBride shooting===
In 1992 the 1st Battalion deployed to Belfast, Northern Ireland and during that six-month tour the battalion suffered two fatalities. In September of this tour, two members of the 1st Battalion were involved in the shooting of an unarmed civilian, 18-year-old Peter McBride. During a routine patrol of the New Lodge area of Belfast, Guardsmen Mark Wright and James Fisher came across McBride. He was searched and found to have no weapons and no outstanding warrants. Frightened by the confrontation, McBride ran from the Guardsmen, who responded by shooting him in the back. Seriously wounded, McBride collapsed across a car and slid to the ground, where he was again shot in the back.

In 1995, Wright and Fisher were convicted of the shooting, and given life sentences. However, they were freed in 1998 according to the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, which provides for the early release of prisoners (in both Britain and Ireland) serving sentences in connection with the activities of paramilitary groups. Upon release, the two men were reinstated into the British Army, despite Queen&#x27;s regulations stating that any member given a custodial sentence in a civilian court must be dismissed, barring &quot;exceptional reasons&quot;. This decision caused a great deal of controversy in Northern Ireland, with national politicians such as Belfast Lord Mayor Martin Morgan speaking out against it. McBride&#x27;s mother and sister have continued their activism against this decision.

==Dawn of a new millennium==

For the regiment, activities in the new millennium began similarly to the 1990s. The 1st Battalion was deployed to Ireland in 2000. Later that year, the battalion also deployed to Kenya for exercises that lasted 6 weeks. A contingent of the Scots Guards was also deployed to Sierra Leone in West Africa. In 2001 the 1st Battalion was back in Ireland, and a single company stayed there for 6 months. When the Queen Mother died in March 2002, only a month after her daughter, Princess Margaret, the regiment was very active contributing to the funeral. On 5 April, 6 officers and 300 other Guardsmen of various ranks took part in the funeral procession to Westminster Hall where the late Queen Mother would be lying-in-state until 9 April. Officers of the regiment took turns at standing vigil in Westminster Hall around the Queen Mother&#x27;s coffin. Later that month, the &quot;1st Battalion&quot; and &quot;F Company&quot; were presented with their new Colours by Queen Elizabeth at Windsor Castle. On 15 June the battalion took part in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Parade, a parade that was all the more significant because 2002 was also the year of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s golden jubilee, her 50th year as Queen. The regiment was also celebrating its 360th year, and had been the first regiment (the 2nd Battalion) to parade the Colour for Queen Elizabeth in 1952. The battalion and F Company were also involved in firefighting duties as part of Operation Fresco during the firefighters&#x27; strike. The Scots Guards, as did all other armed forces units, used vintage Army Green Goddess fire engines. The Scots Guards operated in Greater London during their firefighting duties.

In 2003 the 1st Battalion deployed to Münster, Germany where it joined British Forces Germany (BFG) on a 6-year posting. Also that year, F Company deployed abroad to take part in exercises in the ex-Soviet state of Kazakhstan. In 2004 the 1st Battalion deployed to Iraq on a 6-month posting as part of 4th Armoured Brigade. The 4th Brigade relieved 1st Mechanised Brigade, and joined the Multi-National Division (South East), which was under UK command. The Multi-National Division provided security to south-east Iraq until 2009, when command was transferred to the United States Army.

Under the British Army reforms announced in 2004, the Scots Guards remained as a single battalion regiment, and were given a fixed role as an armoured infantry battalion. They were moved from Münster to Catterick, North Yorkshire, in northern England in 2009. In 2011, the 1st Battalion undertook public duties for the first time in many years, in conjunction with it having its Queen&#x27;s Colour trooped during the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Parade. For this, elements of the battalion moved from Catterick to Pirbright for a time.

In 2021, the 1st Battalion moved to Somme Barracks, Catterick Garrison as part of the Army 2020 Refine reforms.

On 1 May 2022 (delayed from the originally intended 1 April 2022), soldiers in A (The London Scottish) Company, the London Regiment transferred to foot guards regiments and the company became G (Messines) Company, Scots Guards, 1st Battalion London Guards.

<text>Anodizing is an electrolytic passivation process used to increase the thickness of the natural oxide layer on the surface of metal parts.

The process is called &quot;anodizing&quot; because the part to be treated forms the anode electrode of an electrolytic cell. Anodizing increases resistance to corrosion and wear, and provides better adhesion for paint primers and glues than bare metal does. Anodic films can also be used for several cosmetic effects, either with thick porous coatings that can absorb dyes or with thin transparent coatings that add reflected light wave interference effects.

Anodizing is also used to prevent galling of threaded components and to make dielectric films for electrolytic capacitors. Anodic films are most commonly applied to protect aluminium alloys, although processes also exist for titanium, zinc, magnesium, niobium, zirconium, hafnium, and tantalum. Iron or carbon steel metal exfoliates when oxidized under neutral or alkaline micro-electrolytic conditions; i.e., the iron oxide (actually ferric hydroxide or hydrated iron oxide, also known as rust) forms by anoxic anodic pits and large cathodic surface, these pits concentrate anions such as sulfate and chloride accelerating the underlying metal to corrosion. Carbon flakes or nodules in iron or steel with high carbon content (high-carbon steel, cast iron) may cause an electrolytic potential and interfere with coating or plating. Ferrous metals are commonly anodized electrolytically in nitric acid or by treatment with red fuming nitric acid to form hard black Iron(II,III) oxide. This oxide remains conformal even when plated on wiring and the wiring is bent.

Anodizing changes the microscopic texture of the surface and the crystal structure of the metal near the surface. Thick coatings are normally porous, so a sealing process is often needed to achieve corrosion resistance. Anodized aluminium surfaces, for example, are harder than aluminium but have low to moderate wear resistance that can be improved with increasing thickness or by applying suitable sealing substances. Anodic films are generally much stronger and more adherent than most types of paint and metal plating, but also more brittle. This makes them less likely to crack and peel from ageing and wear, but more susceptible to cracking from thermal stress.

==History==
Anodizing was first used on an industrial scale in 1923 to protect Duralumin seaplane parts from corrosion. This early chromic acid–based process was called the Bengough–Stuart process and was documented in British defence specification DEF STAN 03-24/3. It is still used today despite its legacy requirements for a complicated voltage cycle now known to be unnecessary. Variations of this process soon evolved, and the first sulfuric acid anodizing process was patented by Gower and O&#x27;Brien in 1927. Sulfuric acid soon became and remains the most common anodizing electrolyte.

Oxalic acid anodizing was first patented in Japan in 1923 and later widely used in Germany, particularly for architectural applications. Anodized aluminium extrusion was a popular architectural material in the 1960s and 1970s, but has since been displaced by cheaper plastics and powder coating. The phosphoric acid processes are the most recent major development, so far only used as pretreatments for adhesives or organic paints. A wide variety of proprietary and increasingly complex variations of all these anodizing processes continue to be developed by industry, so the growing trend in military and industrial standards is to classify by coating properties rather than by process chemistry.

==Aluminium==

Aluminium alloys are anodized to increase corrosion resistance and to allow dyeing (coloring), improved lubrication, or improved adhesion. However, anodizing does not increase the strength of the aluminium object. The anodic layer is insulative.

When exposed to air at room temperature, or any other gas containing oxygen, pure aluminium self-passivates by forming a surface layer of amorphous aluminium oxide 2 to 3 nm thick, which provides very effective protection against corrosion. Aluminium alloys typically form a thicker oxide layer, 5–15 nm thick, but tend to be more susceptible to corrosion. Aluminium alloy parts are anodized to greatly increase the thickness of this layer for corrosion resistance. The corrosion resistance of aluminium alloys is significantly decreased by certain alloying elements or impurities: copper, iron, and silicon, so 2000-, 4000-, 6000 and 7000-series Al alloys tend to be most susceptible.

Although anodizing produces a very regular and uniform coating, microscopic fissures in the coating can lead to corrosion. Further, the coating is susceptible to chemical dissolution in the presence of high- and low-pH chemistry, which results in stripping the coating and corrosion of the substrate. To combat this, various techniques have been developed either to reduce the number of fissures, to insert more chemically stable compounds into the oxide, or both. For instance, sulphuric-anodized articles are normally sealed, either through hydro-thermal sealing or precipitating sealing, to reduce porosity and interstitial pathways that allow corrosive ion exchange between the surface and the substrate. Precipitating seals enhance chemical stability but are less effective in eliminating ionic exchange pathways. Most recently, new techniques to partially convert the amorphous oxide coating into more stable micro-crystalline compounds have been developed that have shown significant improvement based on shorter bond lengths.

Some aluminium aircraft parts, architectural materials, and consumer products are anodized. Anodized aluminium can be found on MP3 players, smartphones, multi-tools, flashlights, cookware, cameras, sporting goods, firearms, window frames, roofs, in electrolytic capacitors, and on many other products both for corrosion resistance and the ability to retain dye. Although anodizing only has moderate wear resistance, the deeper pores can better retain a lubricating film than a smooth surface would.

Anodized coatings have a much lower thermal conductivity and coefficient of linear expansion than aluminium. As a result, the coating will crack from thermal stress if exposed to temperatures above 80 °C (353 K). The coating can crack, but it will not peel. The melting point of aluminium oxide is 2050°C (2323K), much higher than pure aluminium&#x27;s 658°C (931K). This and the insulativity of aluminium oxide can make welding more difficult.

In typical commercial aluminium anodizing processes, the aluminium oxide is grown down into the surface and out from the surface by equal amounts. Therefore, anodizing will increase the part dimensions on each surface by half the oxide thickness. For example, a coating that is 2 μm thick will increase the part dimensions by 1 μm per surface. If the part is anodized on all sides, then all linear dimensions will increase by the oxide thickness. Anodized aluminium surfaces are harder than aluminium but have low to moderate wear resistance, although this can be improved with thickness and sealing.

===Process===
====Desmut====
A desmut solution can be applied to the surface of aluminium to remove contaminates. Nitric acid is typically used to remove smut (residue), but is being replaced because of environmental concerns.

====Electrolysis====
The anodized aluminium layer is created by passing a direct current through an electrolytic solution, with the aluminium object serving as the anode (the positive electrode in an electrolytic cell). The current releases hydrogen at the cathode (the negative electrode) and oxygen at the surface of the aluminium anode, creating a build-up of aluminium oxide. Alternating current and pulsed current is also possible but rarely used. The voltage required by various solutions may range from 1 to 300 V DC, although most fall in the range of 15 to 21 V. Higher voltages are typically required for thicker coatings formed in sulfuric and organic acid. The anodizing current varies with the area of aluminium being anodized and typically ranges from 30 to 300 A/m2.

Aluminium anodizing (eloxal or Electrolytic Oxidation of Aluminium) is usually performed in an acidic solution, typically sulphuric acid or chromic acid, which slowly dissolves the aluminium oxide. The acid action is balanced with the oxidation rate to form a coating with nanopores, 10–150 nm in diameter. These pores are what allow the electrolyte solution and current to reach the aluminium substrate and continue growing the coating to greater thickness beyond what is produced by auto-passivation. These pores allow for the dye to be absorbed, however, this must be followed by sealing or the dye will not stay. Dye is typically followed up by a clean nickel acetate seal. Because the dye is only superficial, the underlying oxide may continue to provide corrosion protection even if minor wear and scratches break through the dyed layer.

Conditions such as electrolyte concentration, acidity, solution temperature, and current must be controlled to allow the formation of a consistent oxide layer. Harder, thicker films tend to be produced by more concentrated solutions at lower temperatures with higher voltages and currents. The film thickness can range from under 0.5 micrometers for bright decorative work up to 150 micrometers for architectural applications.

===Dual-finishing===

Anodizing can be performed in combination with chromate conversion coating. Each process provides corrosion resistance, with anodizing offering a significant advantage when it comes to ruggedness or physical wear resistance. The reason for combining the processes can vary, however, the significant difference between anodizing and chromate conversion coating is the electrical conductivity of the films produced. Although both stable compounds, chromate conversion coating has a greatly increased electrical conductivity. Applications where this may be useful are varied, however the issue of grounding components as part of a larger system is an obvious one.

The dual finishing process uses the best each process has to offer, anodizing with its hard wear resistance and chromate conversion coating with its electrical conductivity.

The process steps can typically involve chromate conversion coating the entire component, followed by a masking of the surface in areas where the chromate coating must remain intact. Beyond that, the chromate coating is then dissolved in unmasked areas. The component can then be anodized, with anodizing taking to the unmasked areas. The exact process will vary dependent on service provider, component geometry and required outcome. It helps to protect aluminium article.

==Widely used specifications==
The most widely used anodizing specification in the US is a U.S. military spec, MIL-A-8625, which defines three types of aluminium anodizing. Type I is chromic acid anodizing, Type II is sulphuric acid anodizing, and Type III is sulphuric acid hard anodizing. Other anodizing specifications include more MIL-SPECs (e.g., MIL-A-63576), aerospace industry specs by organizations such as SAE, ASTM, and ISO (e.g., AMS 2469, AMS 2470, AMS 2471, AMS 2472, AMS 2482, ASTM B580, ASTM D3933, ISO 10074, and BS 5599), and corporation-specific specs (such as those of Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Airbus and other large contractors). AMS 2468 is obsolete. None of these specifications define a detailed process or chemistry, but rather a set of tests and quality assurance measures which the anodized product must meet. BS 1615 guides the selection of alloys for anodizing. For British defense work, a detailed chromic and sulfuric anodizing processes are described by DEF STAN 03-24/3 and DEF STAN 03-25/3 respectively. 

===Chromic acid (Type I)===
The oldest anodizing process uses chromic acid. It is widely known as the Bengough-Stuart process but, due to the safety regulations regarding air quality control, is not preferred by vendors when the additive material associated with type II doesn&#x27;t break tolerances. In North America, it is known as Type I because it is so designated by the MIL-A-8625 standard, but it is also covered by AMS 2470 and MIL-A-8625 Type IB. In the UK it is normally specified as Def Stan 03/24 and used in areas that are prone to come into contact with propellants etc. There are also Boeing and Airbus standards. Chromic acid produces thinner, 0.5 μm to 18 μm (0.00002&quot; to 0.0007&quot;) more opaque films that are softer, ductile, and to a degree self-healing. They are harder to dye and may be applied as a pretreatment before painting. The method of film formation is different from using sulfuric acid in that the voltage is ramped up through the process cycle.

===Sulfuric acid (Type II &amp; III)===

Sulfuric acid is the most widely used solution to produce an anodized coating. Coatings of moderate thickness 1.8 μm to 25 μm (0.00007&quot; to 0.001&quot;) are known as Type II in North America, as named by MIL-A-8625, while coatings thicker than 25 μm (0.001&quot;) are known as Type III, hard-coat, hard anodizing, or engineered anodizing. Very thin coatings similar to those produced by chromic anodizing are known as Type IIB. Thick coatings require more process control, and are produced in a refrigerated tank near the freezing point of water with higher voltages than the thinner coatings. Hard anodizing can be made between 13 and 150 μm (0.0005&quot; to 0.006&quot;) thick. Anodizing thickness increases wear resistance, corrosion resistance, ability to retain lubricants and PTFE coatings, and electrical and thermal insulation. Sealing Type III will improve corrosion resistance at the cost of reducing abrasion resistance. Sealing will reduce this greatly. Standards for thin (Soft/Standard) sulfuric anodizing are given by MIL-A-8625 Types II and IIB, AMS 2471 (undyed), and AMS 2472 (dyed), BS EN ISO 12373/1 (decorative), BS 3987 (Architectural). Standards for thick sulphuric anodizing are given by MIL-A-8625 Type III, AMS 2469, BS ISO 10074, BS EN 2536 and the obsolete AMS 2468 and DEF STAN 03-26/1.

===Organic acid ===
Anodizing can produce yellowish integral colors without dyes if it is carried out in weak acids with high voltages, high current densities, and strong refrigeration. Shades of color are restricted to a range which includes pale yellow, gold, deep bronze, brown, grey, and black. Some advanced variations can produce a white coating with 80% reflectivity. The shade of color produced is sensitive to variations in the metallurgy of the underlying alloy and cannot be reproduced consistently.

Anodizing in some organic acids, for example malic acid, can enter a &#x27;runaway&#x27; situation, in which the current drives the acid to attack the aluminium far more aggressively than normal, resulting in huge pits and scarring. Also, if the current or voltage are driven too high, &#x27;burning&#x27; can set in; in this case, the supplies act as if nearly shorted and large, uneven and amorphous black regions develop.

Integral color anodizing is generally done with organic acids, but the same effect has been produced in laboratories with very dilute sulfuric acid. Integral color anodizing was originally performed with oxalic acid, but sulfonated aromatic compounds containing oxygen, particularly sulfosalicylic acid, have been more common since the 1960s. Thicknesses of up to 50 μm can be achieved. Organic acid anodizing is called Type IC by MIL-A-8625.

===Phosphoric acid ===
Anodizing can be carried out in phosphoric acid, usually as a surface preparation for adhesives. This is described in standard ASTM D3933.

===Borate and tartrate baths===
Anodizing can also be performed in borate or tartrate baths in which aluminium oxide is insoluble. In these processes, the coating growth stops when the part is fully covered, and the thickness is linearly related to the voltage applied. These coatings are free of pores, relative to the sulfuric and chromic acid processes. This type of coating is widely used to make electrolytic capacitors because the thin aluminium films (typically less than 0.5 μm) would risk being pierced by acidic processes.

===Plasma electrolytic oxidation===
Plasma electrolytic oxidation is a similar process, but where higher voltages are applied. This causes sparks to occur and results in more crystalline/ceramic type coatings.

==Other metals==

===Magnesium===
Magnesium is anodized primarily as a primer for paint. A thin (5 μm) film is sufficient for this. Thicker coatings of 25 μm and up can provide mild corrosion resistance when sealed with oil, wax, or sodium silicate. Standards for magnesium anodizing are given in AMS 2466, AMS 2478, AMS 2479, and ASTM B893.

===Niobium===
Niobium anodizes in a similar fashion to titanium with a range of attractive colors being formed by interference at different film thicknesses. Again the film thickness is dependent on the anodizing voltage. Uses include jewelry and commemorative coins.

===Tantalum===
Tantalum anodizes similarly to titanium and niobium with a range of attractive colors being formed by interference at different film thicknesses. Again the film thickness is dependent on the anodizing voltage and typically ranges from 18 to 23 Angstroms per volt depending on electrolyte and temperature. Uses include tantalum capacitors.

===Titanium===
An anodized oxide layer has a thickness in the range of to several micrometers. Standards for titanium anodizing are given by AMS 2487 and AMS 2488.

AMS 2488 Type III anodizing of titanium generates an array of different colors without dyes, for which it is sometimes used in art, costume jewellery, body piercing jewellery and wedding rings. The color formed is dependent on the thickness of the oxide (which is determined by the anodizing voltage); it is caused by the interference of light reflecting off the oxide surface with light travelling through it and reflecting off the underlying metal surface. AMS 2488 Type II anodizing produces a thicker matte grey finish with higher wear resistance.

===Zinc===
Zinc is rarely anodized, but a process was developed by the International Lead Zinc Research Organization and covered by MIL-A-81801. A solution of ammonium phosphate, chromate and fluoride with voltages of up to 200 V can produce olive green coatings up to 80 μm thick. The coatings are hard and corrosion resistant.

Zinc or galvanized steel can be anodized using DC at lower voltages (20–30 V) in silicate baths containing varying concentrations of sodium silicate, sodium hydroxide, borax, sodium nitrite, and nickel sulfate.

==Dyeing==
The most common anodizing processes, for example, sulphuric acid on aluminium, produce a porous surface which can accept dyes easily. The number of dye colors is almost endless; however, the colors produced tend to vary according to the base alloy. The most common colors in the industry, due to them being relatively cheap, are yellow, green, blue, black, orange, purple and red. Though some may prefer lighter colors, in practice they may be difficult to produce on certain alloys such as high-silicon casting grades and 2000-series aluminium-copper alloys. Another concern is the &quot;lightfastness&quot; of organic dyestuffs—some colors (reds and blues) are particularly prone to fading. Black dyes and gold produced by inorganic means (ferric ammonium oxalate) are more lightfast. Dyed anodizing is usually sealed to reduce or eliminate dye bleed out. White color cannot be applied due to the larger molecule size than the pore size of the oxide layer. 

Alternatively, metal (usually tin) can be electrolytically deposited in the pores of the anodic coating to provide more lightfast colors. Metal dye colors range from pale champagne to black. Bronze shades are commonly used for architectural metals. Alternatively, the color may be produced integral to the film. This is done during the anodizing process using organic acids mixed with the sulfuric electrolyte and a pulsed current. 

Splash effects are created by dying the unsealed porous surface in lighter colors and then splashing darker color dyes onto the surface. Aqueous and solvent-based dye mixtures may also be alternately applied since the colored dyes will resist each other and leave spotted effects.
Another interesting coloring method is anodizing interference coloring. The thin oil film resting on the water&#x27;s surface displays a rainbow hue due to the interference between light reflected from the water-oil interface and the oil film&#x27;s surface. Because the oil film&#x27;s thickness isn&#x27;t regulated, the resulting rainbow color appears random.

In the anodizing coloring of aluminum, desired colors are achieved by depositing a controllably thick metal layer (typically tin) at the base of the porous structure. This involves reflections on the aluminum substrate and the upper metal surface. The color resulting from interference shifts from blue, green, and yellow to red as the deposited metal layer thickens. Beyond a specific thickness, the optical interference vanishes, and the color turns bronze. Interference-colored anodized aluminum parts exhibit a distinctive quality: their color varies when viewed from different angles. The interference coloring involves a 3-step process: sulfuric acid anodizing, electrochemical modification of the anodic pore, and metal (tin) deposition.

==Sealing==
Sealing is the final step in the anodizing process. Acidic anodizing solutions produce pores in the anodized coating. These pores can absorb dyes and retain lubricants but are also an avenue for corrosion. When lubrication properties are not critical, they are usually sealed after dyeing to increase corrosion resistance and dye retention. There are three most common types of sealing. 

# Long immersion in boiling-hot——deionized water or steam is the simplest sealing process, although it is not completely effective and reduces abrasion resistance by 20%. The oxide is converted into its hydrated form and the resulting swelling reduces the porosity of the surface. 
# Mid-temperature sealing process which works at in solutions containing organic additives and metal salts. However, this process will likely leach the colors. 
# Cold sealing process, where the pores are closed by impregnation of a sealant in a room-temperature bath, is more popular due to energy savings. Coatings sealed in this method are not suitable for adhesive bonding. Teflon, nickel acetate, cobalt acetate, and hot sodium or potassium dichromate seals are commonly used. MIL-A-8625 requires sealing for thin coatings (Types I and II) and allows it as an option for thick ones (Type III).

==Cleaning==
Anodized aluminium surfaces that are not regularly cleaned are susceptible to panel edge staining, a unique type of surface staining that can affect the structural integrity of the metal.

==Environmental impact==
Anodizing is one of the more environmentally friendly metal finishing processes. Except for organic (aka integral color) anodizing, the by-products contain only small amounts of heavy metals, halogens, or volatile organic compounds. Integral color anodizing produces no VOCs, heavy metals, or halogens as all of the byproducts found in the effluent streams of other processes come from their dyes or plating materials. The most common anodizing effluents, aluminium hydroxide and aluminium sulfate, are recycled for the manufacturing of alum, baking powder, cosmetics, newsprint and fertilizer or used by industrial wastewater treatment systems.

==Mechanical considerations==
Anodizing will raise the surface since the oxide created occupies more space than the base metal converted. This will generally not be of consequence except where there are tight tolerances. If so, the thickness of the anodizing layer has to be taken into account when choosing the machining dimension. A general practice on engineering drawing is to specify that &quot;dimensions apply after all surface finishes&quot;. This will force the machine shop to take into account the anodization thickness when performing the final machining of the mechanical part before anodization. Also in the case of small holes threaded to accept screws, anodizing may cause the screws to bind, thus the threaded holes may need to be chased with a tap to restore the original dimensions. Alternatively, special oversize taps may be used to precompensate for this growth. In the case of unthreaded holes that accept fixed-diameter pins or rods, a slightly oversized hole to allow for the dimension change may be appropriate. Depending on the alloy and thickness of the anodized coating, the same may have a significantly negative effect on fatigue life. Conversely, anodizing may increase fatigue life by preventing corrosion pitting.

<text>Vyšehrad (also spelled &quot;Wyschehrad ,&quot; German: &quot;Prager Hochburg&quot;, English: &quot;upper castle&quot;) is a historic fort in Prague, Czech Republic, just over 3 km southeast of Prague Castle, on the east bank of the Vltava River. It was probably built in the 10th century. Inside the fort are the Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul and the Vyšehrad Cemetery, containing the remains of many famous Czechs, such as Antonín Dvořák, Bedřich Smetana, Karel Čapek, and Alphonse Mucha. It also contains Prague&#x27;s oldest Rotunda of St. Martin, from the 11th century.

==History==
Local legend holds that Vyšehrad was the location of the first settlement which later became Prague, though thus far this claim remains unsubstantiated. 

Legend has it that Duke Krok founded Vyšehrad while looking for a safer seat than in Budeč. On a steep rock above the Vltava river, he ordered a forest to be cut down and a castle built there. Also according to legend, Prince Křesomysl imprisoned the knight Horymír at Vyšehrad because he damaged silver mines, and Horymír jumped with his horse Šemík over the walls and from &quot;Libuše&#x27;s bath&quot; into the river.

When the Přemyslid dynasty settled on the current site of Prague Castle, the two castles maintained opposing spheres of influence for approximately two centuries. The zenith of Vyšehrad was during the second half of the 11th century, when Vratislav II transferred his seat from Prague Castle to Vyšehrad, and the original fort was remodeled as a complex comprising the sovereign&#x27;s palatial residence, a church, and the seat of the chapter. The period of growth ended around 1140 when Prince Soběslav moved his seat back to Prague Castle.

When Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV began to build the Prague Castle in its current dimensions in the early 14th century, the deteriorating Vyšehrad was abandoned as a royal seat. Later the whole complex was renewed by Charles IV and new fortifications, with two gates and a royal palace were built, while the Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul awaited repair. At the beginning of the Hussite Wars, the Hussites conquered and ransacked Vyšehrad in 1420. The troops of King George of Poděbrady did the same in 1448. The castle was then abandoned and became ruined. It underwent a renovation in the 17th century, when the Habsburg monarchy took over the Czech lands after the Thirty Years&#x27; War and remodeled it in 1654 as a Baroque fortress, turning it into a training center for the Imperial Army of the Emperor, and later incorporating it into the Baroque city walls.

The present form of Vyšehrad as a fortified residence, with powerful brick ramparts, bastions, and the Tábor and Leopold gates, is a result of Baroque remodeling. The Cihelná brána (Brick gate) is an Empire-style structure, dating from 1841. The main part of the Špička Gate, parts of the Romanesque bridge, and the ruined Gothic lookout tower known as Libušina lázeň (Libuše&#x27;s Bath) are the only fragments that have been preserved from the Middle Ages. The Romanesque rotunda of St. Martin dates from the second half of the 11th century. The 11th century Basilica of Sts. Peter and Paul, which dominates Vyšehrad, was remodeled in the second half of the 14th century and again in 1885 and 1887 in neo-Gothic style. Vyšehrad and the area around it became part of the capital city in 1883. The area is one of the cadastral districts of the city.

By the twenty-first century, Vyšehrad has become a public park that is a popular site for recreation and celebrations. For example, it is a popular place for Czechs to celebrate New Year&#x27;s Eve.

<text>Constabulary may have several definitions:
*A civil, non-paramilitary (police) force consisting of police officers called constables. This is the usual definition in the United Kingdom, in which all county police forces once bore the title (and some still do). Constables also exist in some U.S. states including Texas and Pennsylvania.
*In English-speaking Canada, the starting rank of all police officers is Constable. The provincial police service of Newfoundland and Labrador is the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary. This term reflects the force’s history of having been modelled after the Royal Irish Constabulary. In this case, Constabulary is used in the same sense in which it is used in the UK. 
*A large civil police force organised and trained along military lines, which may contain paramilitary elements. This is the usual definition in places outside Great Britain such as the former Royal Irish Constabulary, the former Royal Ulster Constabulary, Royal Newfoundland Constabulary, Jamaica Constabulary Force.
*A military or paramilitary type force consisting of soldiers trained for police duties. Mostly established by the United States in the several countries over which it had protective status e.g. Philippine Constabulary; United States Constabulary in West Germany after World War II. These forces also performed military functions by maintaining &quot;mobile forces&quot; of organised units.

<doc id="831689" wikidata="Q3491629" url="?curid=831689" title="Pontryagin's maximum principle">
<text>Pontryagin&#x27;s maximum principle is used in optimal control theory to find the best possible control for taking a dynamical system from one state to another, especially in the presence of constraints for the state or input controls. It states that it is necessary for any optimal control along with the optimal state trajectory to solve the so-called Hamiltonian system, which is a two-point boundary value problem, plus a maximum condition of the control Hamiltonian. These necessary conditions become sufficient under certain convexity conditions on the objective and constraint functions.

The maximum principle was formulated in 1956 by the Russian mathematician Lev Pontryagin and his students, and its initial application was to the maximization of the terminal speed of a rocket. The result was derived using ideas from the classical calculus of variations. After a slight perturbation of the optimal control, one considers the first-order term of a Taylor expansion with respect to the perturbation; sending the perturbation to zero leads to a variational inequality from which the maximum principle follows.

Widely regarded as a milestone in optimal control theory, the significance of the maximum principle lies in the fact that maximizing the Hamiltonian is much easier than the original infinite-dimensional control problem; rather than maximizing over a function space, the problem is converted to a pointwise optimization. A similar logic leads to Bellman&#x27;s principle of optimality, a related approach to optimal control problems which states that the optimal trajectory remains optimal at intermediate points in time. The resulting Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation provides a necessary and sufficient condition for an optimum, and admits a straightforward extension to stochastic optimal control problems, whereas the maximum principle does not. However, in contrast to the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation, which needs to hold over the entire state space to be valid, Pontryagin&#x27;s Maximum Principle is potentially more computationally efficient in that the conditions which it specifies only need to hold over a particular trajectory.

==Formal statement of necessary conditions for minimization problems==
Here the necessary conditions are shown for minimization of a functional. 

Consider an n-dimensional dynamical system, with state variable formula_11, and control variable formula_12, where formula_1 is the set of admissible controls. The evolution of the system is determined by the state and the control, according to the differential equation formula_14. Let the system&#x27;s initial state be formula_15 and let the system&#x27;s evolution be controlled over the time-period with values formula_16. The latter is determined by the following differential equation:
:formula_17
The control trajectory formula_18 is to be chosen according to an objective. The objective is a functional formula_19 defined by
:formula_20,
where formula_21 can be interpreted as the &quot;rate&quot; of cost for exerting control formula_22 in state formula_23, and formula_24 can be interpreted as the cost for ending up at state formula_23. The specific choice of formula_26 depends on the application.

The constraints on the system dynamics can be adjoined to the Lagrangian formula_27 by introducing time-varying Lagrange multiplier vector formula_28, whose elements are called the &quot;costates&quot; of the system. This motivates the construction of the Hamiltonian formula_29 defined for all formula_30 by:
:formula_31
where formula_32 is the transpose of formula_28.

Pontryagin&#x27;s minimum principle states that the optimal state trajectory formula_34, optimal control formula_35, and corresponding Lagrange multiplier vector formula_36 must minimize the Hamiltonian formula_29 so that

for all time formula_30 and for all permissible control inputs formula_12. Here, the trajectory of the Lagrangian multiplier vector formula_28 is the solution to the costate equation and its terminal conditions:

If formula_41 is fixed, then these three conditions in (1)-(3) are the necessary conditions for an optimal control. 

If the final state formula_41 is not fixed (i.e., its differential variation is not zero), there is an additional condition

These four conditions in (1)-(4) are the necessary conditions for an optimal control.

<text>A visitor center or centre (see American and British English spelling differences), visitor information center or tourist information centre is a physical location that provides information to tourists.

==Types==
A visitor center may be a Civic center at a specific attraction or place of interest, such as a landmark, national park, national forest, or state park, providing information (such as trail maps, and about camp sites, staff contact, restrooms, etc.) and in-depth educational exhibits and artifact displays (for example, about natural or cultural history). Often a film or other media display is used. If the site has permit requirements or guided tours, the visitor center is often the place where these are coordinated.

A tourist information center provides visitors with information on the area&#x27;s attractions, lodgings, maps, and other items relevant to tourism. These are often operated at the airport or other port of entry, by the local government or chamber of commerce. Some are called information centers.

==Signage==
The Unicode code block Letterlike Symbols allocates a code point (U+2139) for a symbol that may used to identify an information source. The default form is a lower case, roman type, serif, extra bold, letter , but the script typeface form formula_1 is common.

==Europe==
===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, there is a nationwide network of Tourist Information Centres run by the British Tourist Authority (BTA), represented online by the VisitBritain website and public relations organisation. Other TICs are run by local authorities or through private organisations such as local shops in association with BTA.

In England, VisitEngland promotes domestic tourism.

In Wales, the Welsh Government supports TICs through Visit Wales.

In Scotland, the Scottish Government supports VisitScotland, the official tourist organisation of Scotland, which also operates Tourist Information Centres across Scotland.

===Poland===
In Poland there are special offices and tables giving free information about tourist attractions. Offices are situated in interesting places in popular tourists&#x27; destinations and tables usually stay near monuments and important culture

==North America==

In North America, a welcome center is a rest area with a visitor center, located after the entrance from one state or province to another state or province or in some cases another country, usually along an Interstate Highway or other freeway. These information centers are operated by the state they are located in. The first example opened on 4 May 1935, next to US 12 in New Buffalo, Michigan, near the Indiana state line.

Many United States cities, such as Houston, Texas and Boca Raton, Florida, as well as counties and other areas smaller than states, also operate welcome centers, though usually with less facilities than state centers have.

In Ontario, there are 11 Ontario Travel Information Centres located along 400-series highways.

==South America==
===Peru===
Peru features Iperú, Tourist Information and Assistance, a free service that provides tourist information for domestic and foreign travelers, the information covers destinations, attractions, recommended routes and licensed tourism companies in Peru. It also provides assistance on various procedures or where tourists have problems of various kinds. Iperú receives complaints and suggestions for destinations and tourism companies operating in Peru (lodging, travel agencies, airlines, buses, etc.).

Iperú, Tourist Information and Assistance has a nationwide network represented online by the Peru.travel website, the 24/7 line (51 1) 5748000, and 31 local offices in 13 regions in all over Peru: Lima-Callao, Amazonas, Piura, Lambayeque, La Libertad, Ancash, Arequipa, Tacna, Puno, Ayacucho, Cusco, Tumbes and Iquitos.

The official tourist organization or national tourist board of Peru is PromPerú, a national organization that promotes both tourism and international commerce of this country worldwide.

==Oceania==
In Australia, most visitor centres are local or state government-run, or in some cases as an association of tourism operators on behalf of the government, usually managed by a board or executive. Those that comply with a national accreditation programme use the italic formula_1 as pictured. These visitor information centres (often abbreviated as VICs) provide information on the local area, and usually perform services such as accommodation and tour bookings, flight/bus/train/hire car options, and act as the first point of contact a visitor has with the town or region.

<doc id="831754" wikidata="Q5253599" url="?curid=831754" title="Delegated legislation in the United Kingdom">
<text>Delegated legislation or [[secondary legislation]] in the United Kingdom is law that is not enacted by a legislative assembly such as the UK Parliament, but made by a government minister, a delegated person or an authorised body under powers given to them by an Act of Parliament.

Statutory instruments are the most frequently used type of secondary legislation, with approximately 3,500 made each year, although only about 1,000 need to be considered by Parliament. They usually have either &quot;Rules&quot;, &quot;Order&quot; or &quot;Regulations&quot; in their title.

Secondary legislation is used for a wide variety of purposes such as fixing the date on which an Act of Parliament will come into force; setting fees for a public service; or establishing the details of an Act of Parliament. Delegated legislation is dependent on its parent act, which prescribes its parameters and procedures. Although a large volume of delegated legislation is written without close parliamentary scrutiny, there are statutory instruments to prevent its misuse.

==Background==
Delegated legislation is derived from its parent act, which prescribes its parameters and procedures. Delegated legislation saves parliamentary time by considering matters of technical detail. Such details are prepared by those with relevant expert knowledge.

Through its inherent flexibility, delegated legislation accommodates changing circumstances such as changing fees for public services, developments in science or minor changes in government policy. Delegated legislation allows the rapid drafting of emergency powers. In comparison to acts of Parliament, which may take much time to pass, the flexibility of delegated legislation can be used to solve problems of governance in a timely way.

Delegated legislation is effected by signature of the author or his authorized representative. In the case of the monarch, only his verbal assent is required. A statutory instrument related to the parent act is required to write delegated legislation. It ensures the legislation is catalogued and published by the King&#x27;s Printer. Exceptions are directions and by-laws where notifications are made to affected entities.

Criticism of delegated legislation may arise because:
# it is subject to a lesser degree of parliamentary scrutiny than acts of Parliament.
# it may be used to remove from the scrutiny of the parliament matters that are causing difficulty for the government by designating them &quot;matters concerning detail&quot;.
# within the large volume of delegated legislation there may be little public knowledge of changes being made. However, the statutory instruments are in place to prevent misuse.

==Types==
Delegated legislation can take a variety of forms, each with different uses. The boundaries between the forms are not fixed. The types used will be determined by the wording of the parent Act.
* Orders in Council are made by the King on the advice of the Privy Council (the Government). Orders in Council are used in matters of constitutional significance. An example is bringing into force emergency powers to be exercised by ministers.
* Orders of Council are made by the lords of the Privy Council. They are used for regulation of professional bodies and the higher education sector.
* Ministerial orders are made by ministers.
* Orders exercise executive powers of government ministers. An example is the dissolution of a public body. Commencement orders set the date on which an Act, or part of an Act, comes into force.
* Regulations set out how an Act is to be implemented and are usually made by ministers. 
* Rules set out procedures for operation of a government entity such as the courts or the Patent Office. Rules may be made by ministers or, if specified in the parent Act, a senior judge. In Scotland, rules of court take the form of Scottish statutory instruments. Those regulating civil procedure are enacted by the Court of Session and are called Acts of Sederunt. Those regulating criminal procedure are enacted by the High Court of Justiciary as Acts of Adjournal. Acts of Adjournal can modify primary legislation where it relates to criminal judicial procedure.
* Schemes are made by commissions to proscribe how entities under their remit are governed. An example is the Charity Commission which supervises charitable organizations.
* Directions are a means by which ministers give legally binding instructions to a public body about the way it exercises its functions.
* By-laws are laws of limited application (usually restricted to certain places) made by local authorities or certain other bodies (for example, train operating companies or the National Trust) to control the activities of the people in public spaces.

===Church of England instruments===
The secondary legislation of the Church of England is known as &quot;instruments&quot;. The procedure for the General Synod approving instruments is set out in the standing orders of the General Synod.

After approval of the General Synod, the instruments are presented before Parliament, signed by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of York.

Sometimes they have a different date for when they are &quot;made&quot; and when they come &quot;into force&quot;. 

So far they have only been used to commence Church of England measures.
====Crown Dependencies====
The Isle of Man has a similar system – the diocesan synod takes the place of the General Synod, Tynwald takes the place of Parliament and the Bishop of Sodor and Man takes the place of the Archbishops of Canterbury and York. Similarly to instruments the United Kingdom, in the Isle of Man orders are presented by the Lord Bishop of Sodor and Man to Tynwald so that to particular provisions of measures can be commenced. 

There is no equivalent for the Channel Islands – application of measures to the Channel Islands happens at Parliament. Previously this happened through statutory instruments rather than instruments. Currently the procedure has been modified through the Channel Islands Measure 2020 so it will occur directly in the measure and therefore the instrument that commences the measure.

==Layout of official documents==
A document which records delegated legislation will begin with a preamble. It describes the author of the legislation, the related parent Act and its preconditions and any stakeholders. The terms used in the document are determined by the type of delegated legislation it records. For instance, in orders, clauses are called &quot;articles&quot;. Clauses may be grouped under headings and in complex delegated legislation, the document may be divided into parts. The main text is followed by any schedules and explanatory notes.

==Controls==
Delegated legislation is controlled by Parliament and the judiciary. Parliamentary controls include &quot;affirmative resolution procedures&quot; where the legislation requires approval in both houses of parliament and &quot;negative resolution procedures&quot; where the legislation may be vetoed by either house. By convention, the House of Lords will not veto but rather pass a motion to convey its concerns about the legislation.

Judicial control of delegated legislation is exercised through judicial review. Delegated legislation can be quashed by a court if it is found to be &quot;ultra vires&quot; (outside the parameters defined in the parent act). There are two types of ultra vires. In &quot;substantive ultra vires&quot;, delegated legislation is deemed void because it goes beyond the powers defined in the parent act. In &quot;procedural ultra vires&quot;, delegated legislation is deemed void because of some procedural deficiency. A court may also quash delegated legislation on the basis of unreasonableness.

<text>The Philadelphia History Museum was a public history museum located in Center City, Philadelphia from 1938 until 2018. From 1938 until 2010, the museum was known as the Atwater Kent Museum. The museum occupied architect John Haviland&#x27;s landmark Greek Revival structure built in 1824–1826 for the Franklin Institute. The Museum operated as a city agency as part of Philadelphia&#x27;s Department of Recreation. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 1, 1979.

==History==
The museum was established through the efforts of Philadelphia Mayor S. Davis Wilson, Frances Wistar, president of the Philadelphia Society for the Preservation of Landmarks, and A. Atwater Kent, radio pioneer and inventor. In 1938 Kent purchased the former Franklin Institute building, which the Institute had vacated in 1933, and gifted the building to the city for use as a public history museum. Following renovations carried out by the Works Progress Administration, the Museum opened in 1941.

After years of declining attendance and financial shortfalls, the museum closed its doors in 2018. In September 2019, the city approved a plan to transfer the museum&#x27;s collections to Drexel University who would preserve the collections and offer them out for loan. Drexel was granted control of the collection in April 2022.
Drexel University has reverted the name of the collection to refer to Atwater Kent as the Atwater Kent Collection at Drexel.

==Collection==
The Museum&#x27;s collections included more than 80,000 objects related to Philadelphia and regional history, including an estimated 10,000 17th- to 20th-century artifacts transferred from the Historical Society of Pennsylvania art and artifact collection in 2009, 1700 Quaker-related items from Friends Historical Association Collection, and collections reflecting Philadelphia manufacturing, the 1876 Centennial Exposition, toys and miniatures, and radio broadcasting.

Highlights from the permanent exhibitions included the boxing gloves of Joe Frazier, the desk of George Washington, a drinking glass owned by Benjamin Franklin, and a wampum belt allegedly given to William Penn by the Lenape.

<doc id="831788" wikidata="Q5287631" url="?curid=831788" title="Document Structuring Conventions">
<text>Document Structuring Conventions (DSC) is a set of standards for PostScript, based on the use of comments, that specifies a way to structure a PostScript file and a way to expose that structure in a machine-readable way. A PostScript file that conforms to DSC is called a &quot;conforming document&quot;.

The need for a structuring convention arises since PostScript is a Turing-complete programming language. There is thus no guaranteed method — short of actually printing the document — to do things like determining how many pages long a given document is or how large a given page is, or how to skip to a particular page. The addition of structure, with DSC comments exposing that structure, helps provide a way for, e.g., an intelligent print spooler to have the ability to rearrange the pages for printing, or for a page layout program to find the bounding box of a PostScript file used as a graphic image. Collectively, any such program that takes PostScript files as input data is called a &quot;document manager&quot;.

In order for a PostScript print file to properly distill to PDF using Adobe tools, it should conform to basic DSC standards. 

Some DSC comments serve a second function, specifying a way to tell the document manager to do certain things, like inserting a font or other PostScript code (collectively called &quot;resources&quot;) into the file. DSC comments that serve this second function are more akin to preprocessing directives and are not purely comments. Documents using those kinds of DSC comments require a functioning document manager to come out as intended; sending them directly to a printer will not work.

DSC is the basis for Encapsulated PostScript (EPS): EPS files are documents that conform to the DSC standards with further restrictions.

The set of DSC comments can be expanded by a mechanism called the Open Structuring Conventions, which, together with the EPS specification, form the basis of early versions of the Adobe Illustrator Artwork file format.

==DSC at a glance==
The basic premise of DSC is the separation of &quot;prolog&quot; (static definitions) and &quot;script&quot; (code that affects job-specific printed output), plus the disallowing of certain PostScript operators deemed inappropriate for page descriptions. This ensures a basic level of predictability in the PostScript code, thus forming the basis of document manageability.

An optional, additional layer of document manageability is provided by separating the script into a &quot;document setup&quot; section, zero or more functionally independent &quot;pages&quot;, and an optional &quot;trailer&quot; (cleanup code). (“Zero pages” in DSC usually means “one page without the use of the PostScript ‘showpage’ operator.”) The functional independence between pages, plus the disallowing of more PostScript operators in the pages section, form the basis for &quot;page independence&quot;, which allows pages to be reordered, and independently and randomly accessed.

This imposed structure is then exposed by delimiting the PostScript file with &quot;DSC comments&quot;, which normally begin with two percent signs followed by a keyword. Some keywords need to be followed by a colon, an optional space character, and then a series of arguments.

Finally, the document is marked as conforming by starting it with a comment starting with “%!PS-Adobe-” followed by the DSC version number.

Sections of reusable PostScript code can be modularized into &quot;procsets&quot; (procedure sets, corresponding to function libraries in other programming languages), in order to ease the generation of PostScript code. Procsets and other PostScript resources (for example, fonts) can be omitted from the PostScript file itself, and externally referenced by a directive-like DSC comment; such external referencing, however, can only work with a document manager that understands such DSC comments.

DSC version 3.0 was released on September 25, 1992. The specification states, &quot;Even though the DSC comments are a layer of communication beyond the PostScript language and do not affect the final output, their use is considered
to be good PostScript language programming style.&quot; Thus, most PostScript-producing programs output DSC-conformant comments along with the code, although some such programs do not actually produce conforming documents.

==Example==
A DSC-conforming document (this one generated by dvips) might begin:

 %!PS-Adobe-2.0
 %%Creator: dvips(k) 5.95a Copyright 2005 Radical Eye Software
 %%Title: texput.dvi
 %%Pages: 1
 %%PageOrder: Ascend
 %%BoundingBox: 0 0 612 792
 %%DocumentPaperSizes: Letter
 %%EndComments

which has the following meaning:

# marks the document as conforming to version 2.0 of the DSC
# identifies the PostScript-producing program as dvips 5.95a
# identifies the document title
# tells the document manager that the document consists of one page
# tells the document manager that pages are independent (i.e., not in Special ordering) and appear in ascending order in the document; in this example, since the document only consists of one page, this information is not usually relevant, but will be needed if additional pages are to be inserted by a document manager
# tells the document manager the coordinates, measured in PostScript points, of the bounding box for all the pages taken together; 0 0 612 792 is the coordinates of a US Letter–sized page
# tells the document manager what kind of paper sizes are used in the whole document; in this example only one size is used, namely the US Letter size
# marks the end of the prolog

<text>The Lieber Code (General Orders No. 100, April 24, 1863) was the military law that governed the wartime conduct of the Union Army by defining and describing command responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity; and the military responsibilities of the Union soldier fighting in the American Civil War (April 12, 1861 – May 26, 1865) against the Confederate States of America (February 8, 1861 – May 9, 1865).

The General Orders No. 100: &quot;Instructions for the Government of the Armies of the United States in the Field&quot; (Lieber Code) were written by Franz Lieber, a German lawyer, political philosopher, and combat veteran of the Napoleonic Wars.

==History==
===Background===
At military age, the jurist Francis Lieber soldiered and fought in two wars, first for Prussia in the Napoleonic Wars (18 May 1803 – 20 November 1815) and then in the Greek War of Independence (21 February 1821 – 12 September 1829) from the Ottoman Empire (1299–1922). In his later career, Lieber was an academic at the College of South Carolina, in the southern region of United States of America. Although not personally an abolitionist, Lieber opposed slavery in principle and in practice because he had witnessed the brutalities of black chattel slavery in the South, from which he departed for New York City in 1857. In 1860, Professor Lieber taught history and political science at the Columbia Law School, and publicly lectured about the &quot;Laws and Usages of War&quot; proposing that the laws of war correspond to a legitimate purpose for the war.

During that time, Lieber had three sons who fought in the American Civil War (April 12, 1861 – May 26, 1865): one in the Confederate Army, who was killed at the Battle of Eltham&#x27;s Landing (May 7, 1862), and two in the Union Army. Later in 1862, in St. Louis, Missouri, while searching for the Union-soldier son wounded at the Battle of Fort Donelson (February 11–16, 1862), Lieber asked the help of his professional acquaintance Major General Henry W. Halleck, who had been a lawyer before the Civil War and was the author of &quot;International Law, or, Rules Regulating the Intercourse of States in Peace and War&quot; (1861), a book of political philosophy that emphasized legal correspondence between the &quot;casus belli&quot; and the purpose of the war.

===Legal dilemma===
In fighting the Confederate Army, guerrillas, and civilian collaborators of the Confederacy, Union Army soldiers and officers faced ethical dilemmas of command responsibility concerning their summary execution &quot;in situ&quot;, per military custom, because the 1806 Articles of War did not address the management and disposition of prisoners of war and irregular fighters; nor the management and safe disposition of escaped black slaves – who were not to be repatriated to the Confederacy, per the Act Prohibiting the Return of Slaves (1862).

To resolve the lack of military authority in the 1806 Articles of War, Commanding General of the Union Army Halleck commissioned Professor Lieber to write military laws specific to the modern warfare of the American Civil War. For the Union Army&#x27;s management and disposal of irregular fighters (guerrillas, spies, saboteurs, &quot;et al.&quot;), Lieber wrote the tract of military law &quot;Guerilla Parties Considered with Reference to the Laws and Usages of War&quot; (1862), which disallowed a soldier&#x27;s POW-status to Confederate guerrillas and irregular fighters with three functional disqualifications: (i) guerrillas do not wear the army uniform of a belligerent party to the war; (ii) guerrillas have no formal chain of command, like a regular army unit; and (iii) guerrillas cannot take prisoners, as could an army unit.

At the end of 1862, General Halleck and War Secretary Stanton commissioned Lieber to revise the military law of the 1806 Articles of War to include the practical considerations of military necessity and the humanitarian needs of civilian populations under military occupation. The editorial-revision committee, Major General Ethan A. Hitchcock and Major General George Cadwalader, Major General George L. Hartsuff and Brigadier General John Henry Martindale, requested from Lieber comprehensive military laws to govern the Union Army&#x27;s prosecution of the Civil War. Gen. Halleck edited Lieber&#x27;s military law to concur with the Emancipation Proclamation (1 January 1863), and, on April 24, 1863, President Lincoln promulgated General Orders No. 100, &quot;Instructions for the Government of the Armies of the United States in the Field&quot;, the Lieber Code.

==Legal provisions==
For the Union Army&#x27;s prosecution of the American Civil War, General Order No. 100 (April 24, 1863) concerns the practical particulars of martial law, military jurisdiction, and the treatment of Confederate irregular fighters, such as spies, deserters, and prisoners of war. In the field practice of military justice, the unit commander held authority for any prosecution under the Lieber Code, which command authority included the summary execution of Confederate prisoners of war and war-criminal soldiers of the Union Army. In the context of the American Civil War, the Lieber Code explains the concepts of &quot;military necessity&quot; and &quot;humanitarian needs&quot; in articles 14, 15, and 16 of Section I:

In the late 19th century, the Lieber Code was the first modern codification of both customary international law and the law of war of Europe, and later was a basis for the Hague Convention of 1907, which restated and codified the practical particulars of that U.S. military law for application to international war among the signatory countries.

===Ethical warfare===
As the modernization of the 1806 Articles of War (An Act for Establishing Rules and Articles for the Government of the Armies of the United States), the Lieber Code defines and describes what is a state of civil war, what is military occupation, and explains the politico-military purposes of war; explains what are the permissible and the impermissible military means an army can employ to fight and win a war; and defines and describes the nature of the nation-state, the nature of national sovereignty, and what is rebellion.

The Code requires the humane, ethical treatment of civil populations under the military occupation of the Union Army, and forbids the policy of killing prisoners of war – except when taking prisoners endangers the capturing unit. Moreover, concerning the ethics of fighting a civil war, Article 70, Section III stipulates that &quot;the use of poison in any manner, be it to poison wells, or food, or arms, is wholly excluded from modern warfare. He that uses it puts himself out of the pale of the law and usages of war.&quot;

The Code forbids torture as warfare; thus Article 44, Section II prohibits &quot;all wanton violence committed against persons in the invaded country, all destruction of property not commanded by the authorized officer, all robbery, all pillage or sacking, even after taking a place by main force, all rape, wounding, maiming, or killing of such inhabitants, are prohibited under the penalty of death, or such other severe punishment as may seem adequate for the gravity of the offense. A soldier, officer, or private, in the act of committing such violence, and disobeying a superior ordering him to abstain from it, may be lawfully killed on the spot by such superior.&quot;

===Black prisoners of war===
The Lieber Code military law concorded with the Emancipation Proclamation (1 January 1863) and prohibited racist discrimination against black soldiers of the Union Army, specifically the Confederate Army denying them the rights and privileges of prisoners of war. Those stipulations of U.S. military law specifically addressed the Confederate government&#x27;s proclamation that the Confederate Army would treat captured black soldiers of the Union Army as escaped slaves, and not as prisoners of war, subject either to summary execution or to re-enslavement in the Confederacy; likewise, the white officers commanding the captured black soldiers would be denied prisoner-of-war status and would be arrested, tried, and condemned as common criminals for helping slaves escape human bondage.

===Hard measures===

Regarding a successful military occupation, the Lieber Code proposed a reciprocal relationship between the U.S. military authority and the Confederate civilian population, whose co-operation with the military authority would ensure considerations and good treatment for the civilian populace; that against guerrilla warfare and armed resistance to martial law the Union Army would subject the insubordinate enemy civilians to imprisonment and death.

Moreover, to defend against the Confederate Army&#x27;s violations of the laws of war by way of irregular fighters, the Lieber Code allowed retaliation by musketry against Confederate POWs, and allowed the summary execution of captured enemy civilians (spies, saboteurs, &quot;francs-tireurs&quot;, guerrillas) caught attacking the Union Army and the United States.

In the 19th century, the Lieber Code legalized limited circumstances for retaliation against enemies for acts such as giving no quarter, reasoning &quot;a reckless enemy ... leaves to his opponent no other means of securing himself against the repetition of barbarous outrage.&quot; (article 27) &quot;Retaliation shall only be resorted to after careful inquiry into the real occurrence, and the character of the misdeeds that may demand retribution.&quot;(article 28)

However, retribution is limited: &quot;Unjust or inconsiderate retaliation removes the belligerents farther and farther from the mitigating rules of regular war, and by rapid steps leads them nearer to the internecine wars of savages.&quot;(article 28)

As he believed war&#x27;s ultimate goal is to bring peace, Lieber preferred for short wars fought and won with decisive warfare, as proposed in the strategy and tactics of the Prussian military science of Carl von Clausewitz. To that end, the Lieber Code legitimized and justified aggressive war to expand the operational range of the Union Army’s prosecution of the civil war to conquer the Confederacy and free the slaves.

===Occupation of the Confederacy===
For the conquest and military occupation of the Confederate States of America (February 8, 1861 – May 9, 1865), General William Tecumseh Sherman based his Special Field Orders No. 120 (November 9, 1864) upon General Orders No. 100 (April 24, 1863) for the Union Army. To realize a peaceful military occupation of the state of Georgia, Special Field Order No. 120 stipulated that &quot;in districts and neighborhoods where the army is unmolested no destruction of such property should be permitted; but, should guerrillas or bushwhackers molest our march, or should the inhabitants burn bridges, obstruct roads, or otherwise manifest local hostility, then army commanders should order and enforce a devastation more or less relentless according to the measure of such hostility.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;https://cwnc.omeka.chass.ncsu.edu/items/show/145&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the Lieber Code (General Orders No. 100, April 24, 1863) was the military law applied to the prosecution of war crimes and for equal prisoner-of-war exchanges between the Union Army and the Confederate Army, regardless of the skin color of the soldier.

==Legacy==
===International law===
In the late 19th century and in the early 20th century, the parties to the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 used the Lieber Code (General Orders No. 100, April 24, 1863) as a basis for their legislation of the international law of war and the codification (definition and description) of what is a war crime and of what is a crime against humanity. In the mid 20th century, in the aftermath of the Second World War (1 September 1939 – 2 September 1945), at the war-crime Nuremberg Trials (20 November 1945 – 1 October 1946) and at the Tokyo Trials (29 April 1946 – 12 November 1948) the jurists determined that, by the year 1939, most governments in the world knew of the existence the law of war, agreed in Switzerland, and thus most governments knew the legal responsibilities of the belligerent parties, of neutral countries, and of the refugees from the war.

===Philippine–American War===
An abridged version of the Lieber Code was published in &quot;The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies&quot; (1899). Lieber&#x27;s son, Guido Norman Lieber, was the Judge Advocate General of the Army (1895–1901), during the Spanish–American War (April 21 – August 13, 1898) and Philippine–American War (February 4, 1899 – July 2, 1902). The Lieber Code was the military law then applied for courts martial of American military personnel, and for litigation against the Filipino natives and against the Filipino revolutionaries fighting the U.S. occupation of the Philippine Islands; e.g. the unlawful concentration camps of General J. Franklin Bell and war-crime trial of Littleton Waller.

=== U.S. &quot;Law of War Manual&quot;===
In 2015, the United States Department of Defense published its &quot;Law of War Manual&quot;. It was updated and revised in July 2023. The &quot;Manual&quot; explicitly refers to the Lieber Code, and the Lieber Code&#x27;s influence on the &quot;Law of War Manual&quot; is apparent throughout.

<text>Benjamin Foster (born April 8, 1968), also known as Ben Weasel, is an American musician best known as the lead singer and guitarist of the punk rock band Screeching Weasel.

== Early life ==
Foster was born in 1968, and was raised in Prospect Heights, Illinois. He attended River Trails Middle School in Mount Prospect, Illinois, where he first met future Screeching Weasel co-founder John Pierson. Weasel was expelled from John Hersey High School and St. Viator High School. He was eventually sent to the Élan School in Poland, Maine for his behavior issues.

== Music career ==
=== Screeching Weasel ===
When Foster returned to Illinois from the Élan School, he got a job at a local movie theater, and formed the band Screeching Weasel with co-worker and former junior high classmate John Pierson, aka Jughead.

Screeching Weasel have released 14 studio albums: Screeching Weasel (1987), Boogadaboogadaboogada! (1988), My Brain Hurts (1991), Ramones (1992), Wiggle (1993), Anthem for a New Tomorrow (1993), How to Make Enemies and Irritate People (1994), Bark Like a Dog (1996), Television City Dream (1998), Emo (1999), Teen Punks In Heat (2000), and First World Manifesto (2011)

On May 26, 2015, Screeching Weasel released a rock opera entitled &quot;Baby Fat: Act 1&quot; on Recess Records, followed by &quot;Some Freaks of Atavism&quot; on March 24, 2020.

=== The Riverdales and The Vindictives ===
After an initial break-up in 1989, Screeching Weasel reformed in 1991 and broke up for a second time in 1994. Following the second breakup, Foster formed a new band, the Riverdales, with Screeching Weasel members Dan Vapid, and Dan Panic.

In the early 1990s, Foster founded &quot;The Gore Gore Girls&quot; (unrelated to the later band of the same name) with SW guitarist Jughead, Glynis Johnson (also of Red Red Meat) and Russ Forester (founder of Underdog Records). The Gore Gore Girls lasted only three shows and made an appearance on a compilation EP, &quot;Mouthful of Monkey Bile&quot; (1992). He also played 2nd guitar in The Vindictives, to be replaced by Billy Blastoff. Foster appeared on the first 4 EPs released by the band. In 1996, Lookout! Records released a 7-inch EP by The Shotdowns which included Foster, Jughead, and rock critic Jim DeRogatis. Foster was credited as &quot;Pappy Le Pew&quot;.

Foster reunited with Screeching Weasel again in 1996. The band lasted until 2001 before breaking up again. On March 27, 2009, Foster announced he was reforming Screeching Weasel. He and Danny Vapid were the only returning members.

=== Solo albums ===
In 2002, Foster released his first solo album, &quot;Fidatevi&quot;. His second album, &quot;These Ones Are Bitter&quot;, was released in June 2007. A live album (featuring all Screeching Weasel songs, including the majority of the album My Brain Hurts), titled &quot;The Brain That Wouldn&#x27;t Die&quot;, appeared in 2009 and featured Screeching Weasel member Danny Vapid. As well as Jon Phillip.

=== Panic Button Records ===
Foster formed Chicago-based record label, Panic Button Records, in 1997 with Pierson. The label was later purchased by Lookout! Records.

==Other ventures==
=== Writing ===
In the early 1990s, Foster published the fanzine &quot;Panic Button&quot;. He published two chapbooks through Oyster Publications, &quot;Brady Bunch Behemoth&quot; (1991) and &quot;Stab! Stab! Stab!&quot; (1992). Weasel also wrote for other various zines, including &quot;Razorcake&quot;, &quot;Non-Stop Banter&quot;, &quot;Jersey Beat&quot;, &quot;Hit List&quot; and &quot;10 Things Jesus Wants You To Know&quot;. He also had a long-running column in &quot;MAXIMUM ROCKNROLL&quot;, one of the most prominent punk rock fanzines. He wrote a novel in 2001 called &quot;Like Hell&quot; and put out a collection of his columns and articles in 2002 entitled &quot;Punk is a Four Letter Word&quot;. Both books were published by Hope and Nonthings, a small publishing house based in Chicago run by former bandmate John Jughead.

=== Acting and directing ===
In 1990 Foster wrote, produced, directed and starred in a low-budget &quot;gay vampire&quot; film entitled &quot;Disgusteen&quot;.

Foster appeared as himself in the 1994 Bruce LaBruce film &quot;Super 8½&quot; in a scene in which he receives fellatio.

=== Weasel Radio ===
Foster co-hosted a weekly radio show with Owen Murphy called &quot;Weasel Radio&quot; which premiered on ESPN 1070. Weasel Radio eventually became a podcast and its last episode was released on May 5, 2016.

Foster appeared on &quot;Ken Reid&#x27;s TV Guidance Counselor&quot; Podcast on September 11, 2015.

He was a guest host on &quot;Dying Scene Radio&quot; episode 017.

== SXSW incident ==
On Friday, March 18, 2011, at Austin, Texas&#x27;s SXSW Festival, Foster was involved in an altercation with two women during a Screeching Weasel performance. The first woman threw ice cubes at Foster. Upon being hit with more ice Foster found an unruly woman was the source of the ice. Foster originally stated he &quot;can&#x27;t kick a girl&#x27;s ass&quot; and offered money for another woman to handle the attacker. As the ice and spitting continued Foster threatened to beat the woman up himself. The woman then threw beer at Foster, who responded by attacking her. A club owner, also female, then came on stage and grabbed Foster from behind. He pushed her and punched her before being pulled to the other side of the stage by a bouncer.

On March 20, Foster posted an apology on his website BenWeasel.com stating 

Following the incident, several bands who were slated to appear at Weasel Fest in Chicago dropped out, including Chinese Telephones, Chixdiggit, The Soviettes, Teenage Bottlerocket and Kepi Ghoulie. On March 23, 2011, the other four members of Screeching Weasel all resigned from the band citing the SXSW incident as the reason.
On March 31 it was announced that the entire Weasel Fest had been cancelled. In August, Weasel issued a full article on Screeching Weasel&#x27;s website describing his whole point of view on the situation.

== Personal life ==
On November 30, 2010, Foster appeared on &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot; and revealed that he suffers from anxiety, panic attacks, and bouts of agoraphobia.

Foster lives with his wife and 3 children in Madison, Wisconsin. He used to be a Buddhist but then became Catholic.

<text>Jantantrik Bahujan Samaj Party (Democratic Majority Society Party), splinter group of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) formed in 1997 when 19 BSP Members of the Legislative Assembly of Uttar Pradesh broke away. JBSP allied themselves with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and joined the National Democratic Alliance. In UP they gave their support to Kalyan Singh&#x27;s government. 17 out of the JBSP MLAs were inducted as ministers in the state government. The president of JBSP was DP Yadav (Rajya Sabha MP) and the general secretary Shahidullah Khan.

JBSP became an unstable party and suffered various splits. Four MLAs defected to Lok Jan Shakti Party. Another splinter group was Kisan Mazdoor Bahujan Party.

When JBSP fell apart DP Yadav organized a new party, Rashtriya Parivartan Dal.

JBSP should not be confused with another BSP splinter group, Loktantrik Bahujan Samaj Party.

<text>Loktantrik Bahujan Samaj Party (Democratic Majority Society Party [DMSP]), splinter group of Bahujan Samaj Party formed in September 2003 when 37 Members of the Legislative Assembly of Uttar Pradesh broke away. The party leader was Haji Yakub. In October the same year LBSP merged with the Samajwadi Party.

The formation of LBSP was a way to avoid sanction under the Anti-Defection Law, and thus LBSP was in many ways a transitional pseudo-party (like Democratic Congress Party, etc.).</text><links>
