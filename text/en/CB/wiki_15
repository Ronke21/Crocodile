<text>Rancho Rinconada is a residential neighborhood in the eastern part of Cupertino, California. It is bordered by Saratoga Creek (just west of Lawrence Expressway), Stevens Creek Boulevard, Miller Avenue and Bollinger Road. It is bordered by the West San Jose neighborhood to the east and south, central Cupertino to the west, and the city of Santa Clara to the north.

Cupertino High School, Sedgwick Elementary School, and Hyde Middle School serve Rancho Rinconada.

The homes in Rancho Rinconada were originally low-cost, single-story houses built in the 1950s by builders Stern &amp; Price. These ranch houses or &quot;ranchos&quot; were designed by architect Cliff May and marketed under the name &quot;Miracle House&quot;, while their landscapes were designed by landscape architect Douglas Baylis. Similar projects were later undertaken in Palo Alto and Long Beach.

The modular construction and materials used were designed to keep the cost of construction to a bare minimum in order to produce a very affordable home. This modular design reduced materials and man hours to the point where a home could be put up in a single day.

Since the Rancho Rinconada residences were outside of any city limits up until the 1990s and were only subject to county regulations, modifications to the houses were not as tightly regulated as those within a city limit. Over the years, many homes in Rancho were remodeled or changed, and much was done without regard to building codes or good building practices.

With the advent of the era for two-income families came the need for two-car garages, which became more prevalent in the 1960s. Rancho Rinconada homes were built with one-car carports. More time-saving kitchen appliances were going into kitchens. The 1970s brought the microwave oven in as a common kitchen appliance, but the Rancho kitchen was designed with only a few low-amp outlets connected to the other houses&#x27; outlets and a total of two electrical breakers for the whole house. Computers and their peripherals came along in the late 80s, putting even more demand on a home&#x27;s electrical system, for which Rancho homes were not designed.

As various city boundaries surrounded the county (Santa Clara County) pocket containing Rancho Rinconada, land values rose and its location relative to the high-tech industry made it into a desirable location. Rancho Rinconada was no longer a blue-collar rural community located among cherry orchards. It became a community located in the heart of the high-tech industry explosion and surrounded by tech growth and highly educated white collar workers. However, for part of the 1970s and 1980s, it was a neighborhood in decline that facilitated a lot of undesirable activities.

However, residents of Rancho Rinconada had the privilege of a Cupertino mailing address, which by itself lends to higher land values than surrounding cities, and shared the acclaim of the famed Cupertino schools. As the tech industry drew more Asian engineers and managers whose culture emphasizes education, Cupertino became a highly desirable area for them. Though not a part of the City of Cupertino, Rancho gave a low-cost avenue for families to get their children into one of the best school systems. People had the strong desire to put their children in good schools, and these there often extended families living in the same household. Larger houses were needed for such families and Rancho was the place to get larger housing at the cheapest price for the Cupertino schools.

By the mid-1990s, the value for the Rancho properties that had the original homes was now almost all in the land alone, as the old Rancho homes held little value due to the nature of their cheap construction. The expense of bringing the old modular construction to modern standards had become cost-prohibitive. Rather than do a major remodel, it was cheaper to tear an old Rancho home down and rebuild from scratch. This gave the builder more flexibility in what to build and resulted in a better-built house to meet modern standards.

By the mid-1990s many contractors, particularly some Asian ones, were knocking down the old Rancho buildings and building from scratch. To get as much profit as possible from the property, they built as big as they could. This resulted in many newly built &quot;Pink Mansions&quot; of the two-story 3,000 - 3,500 sq. ft. type on standard lots of 5,500 sq. ft.

Near the end of the 1990s, a portion of the neighborhood bordering San Jose along Lawrence Expressway was annexed by the city, and contractors then began construction on large, executive-style homes. Rancho Rinconada became a target for wealthy Silicon Valley executives, as the county&#x27;s development laws, to which the rest of the neighborhood was subject, allowed remodeling or rebuilding a home up to the size of the largest home in the immediate area. Additionally, the county did not have community input or review of building plans. As a result, families employed in high-tech industries bought property in unincorporated Rancho Rinconada and demolished the existing houses to build new &quot;monster houses&quot;.

In March 1999, the residents of the unincorporated part of Rancho Rinconada voted to be annexed to Cupertino, with the promise of more restrictive property development procedures and improved services to the neighborhood. Later that month, the Cupertino City Council voted into law a bill that required neighborhood comment and reduced the percentage of a lot that could be covered by a building.

The &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; at the dawn of the new millennium brought another paradigm shift in the remodeling and construction of homes in the Rancho Rinconada neighborhood. Not only were large homes being built, but high-end materials, fixtures and appliances were incorporated to market as executive homes for high-income families. Though there were restrictions put in place that reduced the percentage of the lot that could be built above ground, the contractors went underground building underground living space to maintain a large available living space for an executive class home.

As of 2020, the neighborhood was made up of an eclectic group of homes, from the old cheaply built Rancho houses of the 1950s, to the high-end executive homes of the 2000s and 2010s.

<text>Anthony Maria Zaccaria, CRSP (Italian: Antonio Maria Zaccaria; 1502 – 5 July 1539) was an Italian Catholic priest and early leader of the Counter-Reformation. He was the founder of the Barnabites and a promoter of the Passion of Christ, the Eucharist and the renewal of the religious life among the laity. He is venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church, which celebrates his feast day on 5 July.

==Life==
Anthony Zaccaria was born in the city of Cremona, Italy, in December 1502 to Lazzaro and Antonia Pescaroli Zaccaria. He was baptized the same day in Cremona Cathedral, probably by his uncle Don Tommaso Zaccaria, canon of the cathedral. When he was two, his father died. His family was of the nobility, and in order to teach him compassion for the poor, his mother made him her almoner. 

After attending the Episcopal School annexed to the cathedral, he studied philosophy at the University of Pavia, and, from 1520, medicine at the University of Padua. After completing studies in 1524, he returned to Cremona and practised as a physician for three years. In 1527, he started studying for the priesthood, and continued his theological studies in Bologna.

On 20 February 1529 Zaccaria was ordained a priest in the Chapel of Saint Joseph in Cremona Cathedral. Having explored his calling, mainly by working in hospitals and institutions for the poor, he became spiritual advisor to Countess Ludovica Torelli of Guastalla (then the tiny County of Guastalla), and in 1530 followed her to Milan. There, he became a member of the Oratory of Eternal Wisdom, where he met Bartolomeo Ferrari and Giacomo Antonio Morigia.

Their devotions mainly focused on the teachings of Paul of Tarsus with emphasis on love for the Eucharist and Christ crucified. They were soon joined by others. They instructed in the rudiments of their faith, gave missions in parishes in the city and elsewhere, and cared for the sick in the hospitals. Zaccaria preached regularly in churches and on street corners and is credited for reviving the custom of ringing church bells in Milan at 3:00 p.m. on Fridays, in remembrance of the passion and death of Jesus. There activities aroused some opposition, but the group persevered. 

In 1533, having received encouragement from Pope Clement VII, Zaccaria took a small house near the church of St. Catherine at the Ponte dei Fabbri, and here they began their community life. The congregation was named after the companion of Paul. In 1534 at St. Catherine&#x27;s, he popularized the Forty-hour devotion for the laity – the solemn exposition of the Blessed Sacrament for adoration by the faithful – accompanied by preaching. In July 1535 Pope Paul III, with a Bull of approbation, confirms the devotion to Saint Paul for Zaccaria and his group.

In July 1537 Zaccaria accompanied the first Pauline missionaries (Barnabites, Angelic Sisters, and Laity of St. Paul) and some collaborators (Castellino da Castello and Fra Bono Lizzari) to Vicenza to open the congregation&#x27;s second house.

While on mission to Guastalla in 1539, he caught a fever. Combined with the strict penances he performed, his health worsened. In June Zaccaria writes to the couple Omodei in Milan and speaks of a great &quot;weariness of the body.&quot; He feels that his end is imminent and wants to be brought back to Cremona by a boat of dealers who have two mandatory stops (in Cremona and Casalmaggiore) on their trade route along the Po River.

Anthony Zaccaria died on Saturday, 5 July 1539, at the age of 36, at three o’clock in the afternoon, in the house where he was born, in the arms of his mother and surrounded by his first companions. 

The suffragan bishop, Luca di Seriate, who had ordained him a priest, presided over his funeral. In attendance were the aristocrats and people of Cremona and the surrounding towns. He was buried in the San Paolo Convent of the Angelics of Saint Paul, the female branch of the Barnabites, in Milan. In his last will and testament, Zaccaria stipulated the construction of a chapel in honor of the Conversion of Saint Paul in his parish, Saint Donato.

==Foundations==
While in Milan, he laid the foundations of three religious institutes: one for men (the Clerics Regular of Saint Paul, commonly known as the Barnabites); a female branch of uncloistered nuns, the Angelic Sisters of St. Paul; and a lay congregation for married people, the Laity of Saint Paul, originally called the Married of Saint Paul (sometimes called the Oblates of Saint Paul in North America). The three foundations met regularly, and engaged together in various forms of apostolic action. Their aim was the reform of decadent society, beginning with the clergy and religious.

===The Clerics Regular of St. Paul (the Barnabites)===
&quot;The Congregation of the Regular Clerks of St. Paul&quot; was canonically sanctioned by Pope Clement VII in 1533. Since the order criticized what they saw as abuses in the Church, Zaccaria soon gained a number of enemies, and as the order&#x27;s founder, he was twice investigated for heresy, in 1534 and 1537. He was acquitted both times. In 1536, he stepped down as General of the Order. Giacomo Antonio Morigia was elected Superior. Zaccaria went to Vicenza, where he reformed two convents and founded the Order&#x27;s second house.

===The Angelic Sisters of St. Paul===
On 15 January 1535 Pope Paul III approved the Angelic Sisters with the Bull, &quot;Debitum pastoralis officii&quot;. On 25 December Zaccaria celebrated Mass for the first time at the Oratory of the Monastery of Saint Paul. On 27 February 1536 Zaccaria conferred the habit on six postulants of the Angelic Sisters. Zaccaria appointed Paola Antonia Negri as mistress of novices on 4 March 1537.

==Veneration==
After his death, a number of cures were attributed to the intercession of Anthony Mary Zaccaria. 27 years after his death, his body was found to be incorrupt. His mortal remains are now enshrined at the Church of Saint Barnabas in Milan, Italy. He was canonized by Pope Leo XIII on 27 May 1897. His feast day is celebrated on 5 July, and he is a patron saint of physicians.

===Iconography===
In art, he is depicted wearing the black cassock of the Order and holding a lily, cross, chalice and/or a host.

== Writings ==
He has left only a few writings: twelve letters, six sermons, and the constitution of the Barnabites.
=== Letters ===

There are eleven letters signed by Anthony Mary. Four are original manuscripts: Letter II (addressed to Bartolomeo Ferrari and Giacomo Antonio Morigia, 4 January 1531); Letter IV (to Giovan Giacomo Piccinini, 16 January 1534); Letter VI (to Ferrari, 8 October 1538); and Letter VII (to Battista Soresina, 3 November 1538). Of the other seven, we have only copies, though they are very early. Three letters are cosigned by Anthony Mary and Angelic Paola Antonia Negri. They are, Letter VI, Letter VII], and Letter VIII. In addition, there is a twelfth letter: though it bears only Negri&#x27;s signature, it was without a doubt penned by Anthony Mary. In fact, the original manuscript of this letter is in Anthony Mary&#x27;s own handwriting. 
One letter is addressed to Fra Battista da Crema (Letter I); two are addressed to the Angelics (Letter V and Letter IX); three to laymen (Letter III, Letter IV, and Letter XI); and four to the Barnabites (Letter II, Letter VII, Letter VIII, and Letter X). One (Letter VI) is addressed to Bartolomeo Ferrari, but it is meant for both Barnabites and Angelics who were doing missionary work in Vicenza.
The eleven letters cover a nine-year period, 1530 to 1539. However, there are gaps between 1531 and 1534, and between 1534 and 1537. Letter IX and Letter XII are undated. The last three letters, a remarkable total of 2,200 words penned in the brief space of ten busy days, were addressed to an Angelic, a Barnabite, and a Married Couple. Written respectively on 10, 11, and 20 June 1539, that is, within less than a month of his death, these letters unwittingly became, as it were, his final testament to the three families of his foundation. Anthony Mary&#x27;s letters do not belong to any literary genre nor can they be styled “spiritual letters” &quot;per se&quot;. They were occasional writings dashed off without any concern for style, in plain, totally unadorned language. However, they do contain a wealth of extraordinary spirituality, a fact easily recognized by his earliest biographers.
Anthony Mary himself, in his last letter, pointedly remarked: “I have not written one word without some special meaning in it. If you discover it, it will be, I think, most useful and gainful for you.”

=== Sermons ===

The manuscript codex of the Sermons is kept in the General Archives of the Barnabites in Rome. It was entrusted by Anthony Mary&#x27;s mother to the Angelics of Santa Marta Convent in Cremona. Early Barnabite historian, Father Giovanni Antonio Gabuzio, retrieved it during his stay in that city from 1584 to 1595. It is an index-notebook. When he was a student at the University of Padua, Anthony Mary recorded in it some lines of the philosopher, Averroës. Later on, as a priest in Cremona, he wrote in it the talks on the Ten Commandments, which he gave at the Amicizia Oratory in Saint Vitalis Church. Clearly, he planned to write out ten sermons, one on each commandment. However, the notebook contains only five sermons: four on the first four commandments. The fifth one is on the commandment, but is only half finished. Sermon I has an appendix on how nuns should practice the first commandment. It was likely intended for the Augustinian Community of Santa Maria Annunziata in Cremona.
A sixth sermon was part of a projected trilogy on moral and spiritual lukewarmness. The Sermons are addressed to noble laymen, who were married and had children, and were active members of the Amicizia Oratory, in the years 1529-1530 when Anthony Mary was a priest; however, their content is applicable to everyone. The above-mentioned appendix to Sermon I proves it. All the Sermons have the same structure. They are divided in two parts. The first one treats of a specific theme. In Sermon I it is the “due order” of the spiritual life; in Sermon II, “true spiritual life”; in Sermon III, “acknowledgment”; in Sermon IV, love; in Sermon V, passions; in Sermon VI, the “way of God.” The second part of Sermons 1–V is an extensive exposition of each commandment and its practice. In the case of Sermon VI, the second part is a detailed explanation of lukewarmness. 
The Sermons exhibit a more elaborate style than that of the Letters. The language, though direct, reveals greater care and elegance. The reasoning is cogently logical and is structured on solid theological preparation. The numerous Biblical quotations reveal a mastery of the Scriptures.
Recently, a hypothesis was put forth, saying the Sermons are not liturgical homilies but opening talks given at the Amicizia Oratory meetings, where all present could then speak. It is noteworthy that Anthony Mary reserves the term “sermon” only for his talk on lukewarmness.

=== Constitutions ===

No original manuscript of the &quot;Constitutions&quot; survive, only a very early copy. The &quot;Constitutions&quot; is no more than an extended outline. It was never approved nor promulgated, hence, it was never binding. In all probability, it is a reworked translation of a previous Latin outline by Fra Battista, the so-called “Primitive Constitutions.” It was a basic text worked on by the first Fathers toward a definitive text.
The available text consists of 19 chapters, but a close scrutiny points to several layers of composition. There is a conclusion at the end of Chapter 16; another one at the end of Chapter 18; and a third one at the end of Chapter 19. This is evidence that the text went through several writings and underwent multiple reworking.

A letter of Father Nicolò D’Aviano, dated October 10, 1570 (even as the definitive &quot;Constitutions&quot; of 1579 were being redacted), informs us that three chapters of the &quot;Constitutions&quot; were undoubtedly written by Anthony Mary himself. They are Chapter 12: “Formation of Novices”; Chapter 17: “Signs of Deteriorating 17 Religious Life”; and Chapter 19: “Qualities of a Reformer.” In addition, Anthony Mary&#x27;s hand can be recognized, more or less, throughout the entire document.
The &quot;Constitutions&quot; is a document of laws, hence its classification in the juridical literary genre. However, in Anthony Mary&#x27;s additions, the peremptory style turns exhortatory. This change of style helps locate Anthony Mary&#x27;s interpolations in the original text of Battista da Crema.

<text>Jennifer Mary Sparks is a superhero in the WildStorm comic book universe created by Warren Ellis during his 1997 revamp of the &quot;Stormwatch&quot; series. Her first appearance was in issue #37 (Ellis&#x27; starting issue) where she was appointed the leader of Stormwatch Black (Black Ops division), with Swift and Jack Hawksmoor, with whom she would later create The Authority.

Sparks is described as &quot;The Spirit of the 20th Century&quot;, having been born at its beginning and later dying at its end. Throughout her time, she is shown to have influenced many of the most significant individuals who shaped that century, both positively and negatively. Sparks is depicted as a superficial hedonist hiding a strong underlying sense of morality. She was named the 44th Greatest Comic Book Character by &quot;Empire&quot; in 2006. In August 2024, DC Comics revived Sparks as a DC Universe character in a 21st-century setting for an eponymous DC Black Label mini-series written by Tom King.

== Publication history ==

Jenny Sparks first appeared in &quot;Stormwatch&quot; vol. 2 #37 (cover-dated July 1996) and was created by writer Warren Ellis and artist Tom Raney. After that series ended with the death of most characters not created by Ellis, he started a new series, &quot;The Authority&quot;, featuring the eponymous team led by Sparks.

After the 12th issue, Warren Ellis left the title and Mark Millar took over. He did some extra fleshing out of Jenny&#x27;s history in the &quot;Jenny Sparks: The Secret History of the Authority&quot; limited series, focusing on the origin stories of the members of The Authority. Most of Millar&#x27;s additions are furthering Ellis&#x27;s backstory and intermeshing Jenny Sparks with important historical figures of the 20th century, including Albert Einstein, Ernest Hemingway, Adolf Hitler, Jacques Cousteau, John Lennon, Princess Diana, and many others.

== Fictional character biography ==
Jennifer Sparks was born in England on 1 January 1900. Her family possessed quite a fortune, and she was sent to an all-girls school in Vienna. Her family had died on the &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1912, and her father&#x27;s nemesis took over their fortune. Left penniless, young Jenny was invited by her godfather, Albert Einstein, to Zürich, where he offered to finish her education. Before leaving she recommended that a young painter named Adolf Hitler, whose art was quite abysmal, leave it behind and take a career in politics as he had a certain charisma and talent for speeches.

Between 1913 and 1919, her powers started to manifest. Jenny Sparks had absolute control of electricity, including travel through power lines, shooting bolts of lightning and shaping electricity. With age, her control and power increased. By 1919, Jenny stopped aging.

In various comics, a number of Sparks&#x27; adventures through the early and middle part of the 20th century have been told. A common theme in these stories is her interaction with prominent historical figures.

In the 1960s through 1980s, Sparks is shown to have become involved with the first British bands of superheroes, but she encounters problems with some extreme personalities that disillusioned her to that role.

=== Stormwatch and The Authority ===
Despite those experiences, in the 1990s she agreed to join a new group called Stormwatch that had been formed by a man named Henry Bendix.

Against her wishes, she was given command of a covert team called Stormwatch Black.

When Stormwatch disbanded after the Xenomorph attack that took the lives of half the team, she created a new superhero group called The Authority alongside a number of Stormwatch Black teammates. During her leadership, Jenny and her team faced many threats, including super-powered terrorists and an invasion by an alternate reality.

On 31 December 1999, Jenny Sparks knew that she would die at midnight as the 20th century ended, a fact known only by her teammate The Doctor. She electrocuted the brain of an enormous alien creature, the &quot;God&quot; that had originally created Earth and which was planning to wipe the planet clean of all life. This was her final act, in her words, as humanity&#x27;s defense mechanism. She died moments later in her teammates&#x27; arms. Her dying words and last will were: &quot;Save the world. They deserve it. Be better. Or I&#x27;ll come back and kick your heads in.&quot;

The passing of “The Spirit of the 20th Century” heralded the arrival of a successor. At the moment Jenny Sparks died, a new entity was born: Jenny Quantum, “Spirit of the 21st Century”.
During the &quot;Transfer of Power&quot; storyline, a magical version of Jenny appeared and temporarily removed all mechanical weapons from the earth.

===The New 52===
In the DC Comics’ rebooted &quot;Stormwatch&quot; series, part of their New 52 event, Jenny&#x27;s shirt was seen in storage in Stormwatch&#x27;s base. Jenny Sparks herself also makes an appearance in a flashback montage, projected by Adam One, in Stormwatch&#x27;s &quot;0&quot; edition.

===The Wild Storm===

In Warren Ellis&#x27; 2017 reboot of the WildStorm properties following DC Rebirth, Jenny Sparks is reinterpreted as an aspect of a &quot;Planetary defense system&quot; created by aliens, complete with new powers. She is also of Asian descent, with her name being Jenny Mei Sparks, and is almost 120 years old. She is a &quot;techne&quot; – a spirit of the mechanical arts and crafts, empowered by the defining technology of her era, and created by unknown powers to defend the planet Earth.

===DC All In===
In 2021, DC established with its Infinite Frontier soft reboot that it &quot;everything is canon&quot;, extending the editorial mandate from DC Rebirth to restore characters to their traditional, most iconic depictions. This continued wth DC All In, which restored Jenny Sparks to her original Wildstorm look and characterisation. The &quot;Jenny Sparks&quot; (2024-) solo series by Tom King and Jeff Spokes published under the DC Black Label imprint depicts Jenny again as the spirit of the 20th century and a former member of the Authority and Stormwatch, and otherwise broadly retaining her previous Wildstorm character history with some small changes. 

In her new backstory as part of the DC Universe, Jenny was the great-granddaughter of Charles Darwin and goddaughter of Albert Einstein who died in 1999 and was buried in Westminster Abbey, passing her role as Century Baby onto Jenny Quantum, before being mysteriously resurrected on September 11, 2001. She and Superman also briefly had a &quot;snog&quot; when he was a &quot;college boy&quot; rebounding from a Mermaid ex-girlfriend. The series sees Jenny working at arms length from the Justice League to try and apprehend an out-of-control Captain Atom.

== Powers and abilities ==
Jenny Sparks is one of the Century Babies, a being produced by the multiverse for a specific task. In her case, this is to influence the 20th century. As such, her moods are tied directly to the world&#x27;s status. For example, she was suicidally depressed during the Great Depression and deliriously high during the Roaring Twenties. Additionally, she stopped aging at nineteen and remained this way until her death. Her appearance alters from time to time and it is unclear if this is an effect of her connection to the planet or an artist interpretation.

Jenny has the ability to manipulate electricity. She can easily draw electricity from electronic devices as well as from the human brain, a move she has threatened to kill people with. Sparks can also convert her entire body into electricity and travel anywhere electricity would. She can apparently survive being transformed into other forms of energy, as when she travelled through a TV and power lines and then into a police radio. Shifting into her electrical form heals Sparks from injuries as well as poisons. Like an electric current, Sparks as electricity must go somewhere before she can re-emerge in her human form. Normally this is into a machine, but other conductors seem to work as well. She was once able to go into the sky and remain there until striking down as lightning. She can also enter a person briefly and electrocute them.

A key distinction is that Jenny Sparks does not generate electricity like Electro and others. If she is unable to access electricity from any sources or has no place for her electrical form to go, she is powerless and as vulnerable as a normal human. This limitation is woven into the plotlines of many of her adventures.

Through her lifetime, Sparks was a member of several branches of the British military and led various superhero teams. As such, she is an experienced leader and knowledgeable about military protocol. She has not demonstrated the fighting skill that one might associate with this experience, usually relying on her powers instead.

A short-lived 2017 reboot of Jenny Sparks in &quot;The Wild Storm&quot; possessed the ability to travel between electronic devices, such as televisions, computers and smartphones.

<text>Jan Maurycy Hauke (26 October 1775 – 29 November 1830) was a Polish general and professional soldier of Hauke family, which had Flemish and Saxon origins.

==Life==
Maurycy Hauke was the son of Fryderyk Karol Emanuel Hauke (1737–1810), a German professor at the Warsaw Lyceum, and served between 1790 and 1793 in the army of Poland during the country&#x27;s last years of independence. Maurycy Hauke was an alumnus of Warsaw&#x27;s Corps of Cadets, and fought in the Kościuszko Uprising, the Polish Legions in France and later served in the army of the Duchy of Warsaw in Austria, Italy, Germany and the Peninsular War. After 1815, Maurycy joined the army of Congress Poland, reaching the rank of full general in 1826 and receiving a title of Polish nobility. Recognizing his abilities, Tsar Nicholas I appointed him Deputy Minister of War of Congress Poland and elevated him in 1829 to Count.

In the uprising of 1830 led by revolutionary army cadets, the target was Grand Duke Constantine, Poland&#x27;s Governor-General. Count Maurycy Hauke was on his way to the Grand Duke who managed to escape, but Hauke was shot to death by the cadets on the street of Warsaw before the eyes of his wife, Sophie Lafontaine (daughter of Franz Leopold Lafontaine), and his three younger children. He was riding on a horse beside the carriage of his wife and having met a group of rebels who shouted: &quot;Be our leader, General!&quot; Hauke reprimanded them and told them to go back to their quarters, whereupon they opened fire and killed him. His wife died shortly afterward, and their younger children were made wards of the Tsar, while three elder sons joined the uprising and one of them, Maurice Leopold, fell during the battle of Ostrołęka in 1831 only 27 years old. After his victory over the Poles, the Tsar raised in 1841 an enormous obelisk in Warsaw, which was dedicated to the memory of Hauke and five other Polish generals who &quot;preserved their fidelity to their Monarch&quot;. Detested by the inhabitants of the Polish capital, the obelisk was pulled down in 1917.

On 28 October 1851, Hauke&#x27;s youngest daughter, Countess Julia Hauke, then lady-in-waiting to Russian Empress Maria Alexandrovna, married Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine, Maria&#x27;s brother. Julia became an ancestress of the Mountbatten family, the British royal family, and the Spanish royal family. Hauke&#x27;s older daughter, Katarzyna, became the mistress of Paul Friedrich, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg.

<text>The coat of arms of France is an unofficial emblem of the French Republic. It depicts a lictor&#x27;s fasces upon branches of laurel and oak, as well as a ribbon bearing the national motto of . The full achievement includes the star and grand collar of the Legion of Honour. This composition was created in 1905 (during the Third Republic) by heraldic painter-engraver Maurice de Meyère, and it has been used at the Foreign Ministry during state visits and for presidential inaugurations.

The country is traditionally associated with the fleurs-de-lis design, which came into use by French kings during the High Middle Ages. This design still represents France and the House of Bourbon in the form of marshalling, such as in the arms of Spain, Quebec, and Canada. The fleur-de-lis was also the symbol of Île-de-France, the core of the French kingdom, and the arms of many French communes.

The only national symbol specified in the present constitution is the tricolour flag in Article 2.

Although it finds its origins in the French Revolution, it was then only one motto among others and was not institutionalized until the Third Republic at the end of the 19th century.

====Fasces====

Fasces are a bundle of birch rods containing a sacrificial axe. In Roman times, the fasces symbolized the power of magistrates, representing union and accord with the Roman Republic. French architects began to use the Roman fasces (&quot;faisceaux romains&quot;) as a decorative device during the reign of Louis XIII (1610–1643), and the imagery of the French Revolution used references to the ancient Roman Republic to an even greater extent. During the First Republic, topped by the Phrygian cap, the fasces is a tribute to the Roman Republic and means that power belongs to the people. It also symbolizes the &quot;unity and indivisibility of the Republic&quot;, as stated in the French Constitution.

====Branches====

*The oak is France&#x27;s national tree, and a common symbol of strength and endurance.
*A bay laurel () branch, an aromatic broadleaf evergreen, or later from spineless butcher&#x27;s broom (&quot;Ruscus hypoglossum&quot;) or cherry laurel (&quot;Prunus laurocerasus&quot;). It is a symbol of triumph, which traces back to Greek mythology. Apollo is represented wearing a laurel wreath on his head, and wreaths were awarded to victors in athletic competitions, including the ancient Olympics — for which they were made of wild olive-tree known as &quot;kotinos&quot; (), (sc. at Olympia)—and in poetic meets. In Rome they were symbols of martial victory, crowning a successful commander during his triumph.

===External devices===
*Star and grand collar of the Legion of Honour, which is the highest French order of merit for military and civil merits, established in 1802 by Napoleon Bonaparte and retained by all later French governments and régimes. The achievement includes the order&#x27;s grand collar, which is worn only by the President, as Grand Master of the order.

==History==
===Background===
====13th century – 1870: Arms of dominion / French Revolution====

French kings and emperors had personal arms of dominion, which by extension also represented France. The &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; was used by French kings since the Middle Ages, which were followed by the Napoleonic eagle designs after the French Revolution. The fleur-de-lis is still popular, and used by overseas people of French heritage, like the Acadians, Québécois or Cajuns. The Napoleonic eagle is also used by Swedish royal house.



====1870–1905: Period without any national coat of arms====

The state was left without a coat of arms after the proclamation of the Third Republic in 1870. Consequently, the façade and balconies of French embassies and consulates were sometimes decorated with quasi-heraldic emblems, such as a simple RF monogram or a lictor&#x27;s fasces topped with a Phrygian cap. This was lamented by diplomats, as it neither reflected the country&#x27;s rich heraldic tradition nor matched other European countries&#x27; emblems.

In 1881 Foreign Minister Charles de Freycinet sought to address this issue by proposing arms. This first attempt was not successful. Count Horace de Choiseul, undersecretary of state in this department, invited the sculptor Francia to submit a proposal to him, which this denier executed on the drawing of Émile Bin.

===1905–present: Adoption and modifications in external devices===
King Alfonso XIII of Spain&#x27;s official visit to France in 1905, as well as preceding visits from king Edward VII and Victor Emmanuel III of the United Kingdom and Italy, respectively, once again brought attention to the fact that France had no coat of arms. The Foreign Ministry responded by consulting the Grand Chancellery, which in turn asked the heraldists to propose national heraldic devices. Among about twenty proposals which were approved by the government, heraldic painter-engraver Maurice de Meyère&#x27;s composition was formally adopted as the new coat of arms of France. This design was to be used by embassies and consulates abroad, instead of previous quasi-heraldic emblems.
In de Meyère&#x27;s composition, the escutcheon was framed by an artistic console, whereas the Legion of Honour&#x27;s star featured as the sole external heraldic device. The entire achievement was depicted upon an oval background with the words &quot;French Republic&quot; on the edge, a non-heraldic element. The console and oval background were mentioned as late as February 1914, but generally omitted after World War I, while the star of the Legion of Honour had been accompanied by the 1881 version of the grand collar.

In 1924/1925, a greater version of the arms was invented for a decorative tapestry commissioned by the city of Strasbourg to Gustave Louis Jaulmes. It was never formally adopted.

In 1953, the collar was redesigned.

==Usage==
A list of notable depictions:

*1905: A watercolour reproducing de Meyère&#x27;s design was sent to each member of the government, and the arms adorned the two entrances of the French foreign ministry (37 Quai d&#x27;Orsay) at the occasion of king Alfonso&#x27;s visit.
*1922: The arms was emblazoned on the bronze Medal for Fidelity to France (), awarded to inhabitants of the two border regions of Alsace and Lorraine, who had been either imprisoned or exiled by the occupying Germans during World War I because of their loyalty to France.
*1924/1925: A greater version of the arms was depicted on a painted tapestry by Gustave Louis Jaulmes, titled &quot;Les armes de France&quot;. Commissioned by the city of Strasbourg, this piece was to be installed at the &quot;Commissariat General of the Republic&quot; in the city.
*1928: German encyclopedias gave a color reproduction of Jaulmes&#x27; greater arms.
*1929: On 10 May the German embassy in France inquired what was the official coat of arms of France was. The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied that &quot;there is no, in principle, official coat of arms or emblem,&quot; but that such a composition was used for the French embassies and consulates.
*1933–1942: The arms were depicted on prefects&#x27; uniforms.
*1935: The annual edition of &quot;Le Petit Larousse&quot; reproduced a monochrome reproduction of the arms as a symbol of the French Republic.
*1953: The United Nations Secretariat requested that France submit a national coat of arms that were to adorn the wall behind the podium in the General Assembly hall in New York, alongside the other member states&#x27; arms. On 3 June, an interministerial commission met at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to select this emblem. It requested Robert Louis (1902–1965), heraldic artist, to produce a version of the Jules-Clément Chaplain design. In the end, Louis chose Maurice de Meyère&#x27;s 1905 design instead, and this was adopted and submitted to the UN.
*1975: President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing adopted the charge of the arms in his presidential standard.
*6 June 1980: President d&#x27;Estaing assumed on him being admitted to the Order of the Seraphim: &quot;Azure a Fasces Or bindings Argent between two Laurel sprigs disposed orleways of the second and bound together in base by a ribbon of the third.&quot;, based on the republican arms.
*1982/1988: The arms were depicted on French space suits during the Franco-Soviet space missions of 1982 and 1988.
*2009: Used to represent France in the &quot;Hanseatic Fountain&quot; in Veliky Novgorod, Russia.
The coat of arms is still used, e.g. in relation to presidential inaugurations, including that of François Mitterrand, Jacques Chirac and Emmanuel Macron in 1981, 1995 and 2017, respectively.

<doc id="799859" wikidata="Q1061983" url="?curid=799859" title="Defensive driving">
<text>Defensive driving describes the practice of anticipating dangerous situations, despite adverse conditions or the mistakes of others when operating a motor vehicle. It can be achieved by adhering to general guidelines, such as keeping a two- or three-second gap between the driver&#x27;s vehicle and the vehicle in front to ensure adequate space to stop. It is a form of training for drivers that goes beyond road rules and the basic mechanics of driving techniques. Defensive driving reduces the risk of collisions and improves road safety.

== History ==

A driver safety program called the &quot;Driver Example Program&quot; was developed in 1964 by Chris Imhoff of the (US) National Safety Council. The program instituted a &quot;Defensive Driving Course (DDC)&quot;. Defensive Driving Courses, along with Instructor Development Courses were offered beginning 1964 and 1965, typically through corporate sponsorships. A similar driving course is offered by the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe.

== General principles ==

Driving defensively includes:

* General principles: 
** Controlling your speed.
** Looking ahead and being prepared for unexpected events.
** Being alert and distraction free.
* Regarding other participants in traffic:
** Preparedness for all sorts of actions and reactions of other drivers and pedestrians.
** Not expecting the other drivers to do what you would ordinarily do.
** Watching and respecting other drivers.
* Regarding your own vehicle:
** Maintaining a safe following distance.
** Driving safely considering (adjusting for) weather and/or road conditions.
** Adjusting your speed before entering a bend, in order to avoid applying the brakes in the middle of a bend.

== Training and courses ==

Several US government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and private schools have launched specialty courses that improve the public&#x27;s driving skills. In the United States a few of the familiar courses in defensive driving include Alive at 25, DDC or Defensive Driving Course, Coaching the Mature Driver, Attitudinal Dynamics of Driving, Insurance discount, Seat Belt Safety, Handsfree, Professional Truck Driving, and DDC for Instructors. In relation to this, the government has launched active airbag and seat belt safety campaigns that encourage high visibility enforcement.

In addition to improving one&#x27;s own driving skills, many US states provide an incentive to complete an approved defensive driving course by offering mandated insurance discounts or a way to mask a traffic ticket from one&#x27;s driving record. In some instances, these courses are referred to as traffic school or a defensive driving school. States with the biggest incentives include Arizona, California, Florida, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, and Texas. A number of private providers offer a variety of courses. The methods and styles of the courses vary; but they are typically less comprehensive than training to pass an advanced driving test through the Institute of Advanced Motorists, Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents Advanced Drivers and Riders, or British Motorcyclists Federation Blue Riband.

While US training has typically focused on handling skills – such as the Bondurant school of high-performance driving – British training has emphasized roadcraft. Defensive and advanced driving and motorcycling are commonly recognized in the UK, championed by charities such as the Institute of Advanced Motorists and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents&#x27; Advanced Drivers and Riders.

=== Online Defensive Driving Courses ===
In many states, online defensive driving courses are available for drivers to improve their skills and manage traffic tickets without attending in-person classes. These courses are designed to help keep the Motor Vehicle Division (MVD) or Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) records clean, and course providers often handle most court filings, thereby preventing points from being added to drivers&#x27; records. Completion of these courses can result in the dismissal of eligible violations.

==Benefits of roadcraft==
British research has shown advanced drivers who use the roadcraft system of car control are safer and have better fuel efficiency too. The roadcraft system was devised in 1937 by racing driver Mark Everard Pepys, 6th Earl of Cottenham, to reduce accidents in police pursuits. A study by Brunel University found advanced drivers who had successfully completed the Institute of Advanced Motorists training were nearly 70% better in all aspects of their driving – from steering to judging distances and speed. Earlier research by Britain&#x27;s Transport Research Laboratory that concluded drivers are less likely to crash if they have reached a measurable higher driving standard. Unpublished research by IAM Surety (an insurance company) showed that insurance claims by members of the Institute of Advanced Motorists were far cheaper than comparable non-members. Additionally – according to the Association of Motor Insurers – there is a reduction in claims for the first four years after passing the Institute of Advanced Motorists test.

<text>Alma Isabella Fahlstrøm (née Bosse; 23 November 1863 – 29 May 1946) was a well known Norwegian stage actress, director and theatre manager.

Alma Isabella Bosse was born in Skanderborg, Denmark. She was the daughter of Johan Heinrich Bosse and Anne-Marie Lehmann.
She was the sister of sociologist Ewald Bosse (1880–1956), singer Dagmar Möller and actress Harriet Bosse (1878–1961) who was married to playwright August Strindberg (1849–1912). 

In 1889, she married fellow actor Johan Fahlstrøm (1867–1938). In 1897, she and her husband established the Centralteatret in Oslo. The theatre was especially known for a repertoire of light comedy, revues and operettas, as well as Norwegian drama. The couple subsequently operated the Fahlstrøm Theater on Torggata in Oslo from 1903 to 1911. 

In 1912, the couple&#x27;s only child, Arne Jonas Fahlstrøm (1893–1912) died in the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster. To help avoiding further shipping disasters, they donated nearly all their fortune to the Norwegian Sea Rescue Society, which used it to purchase two rescue boats that were named in their son&#x27;s honor.

<text>Johan Peter Broust Fahlstrøm (30 August 1867 – 28 July 1938) was one of Norway&#x27;s leading male actors before World War I.

Johan Fahlstrøm was born in Trondheim, Norway. He debuted as an actor at the Christiania Theatre in 1887 in the play &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; by William Shakespeare. Fahlstrøm was employed at the Christiania Theater from 1887 to 1897 and at the National Theatre from 1899 to 1903.

In 1889, Johan Fahlstrøm married the actress Alma Isabella Bosse, who was the sister of the actress Harriet Bosse and sociologist Ewald Bosse. In 1897, the couple opened the Central Theater in Christiania (now Oslo) with both concert and vaudeville venues. Fahlstrøm appeared in a variety of roles and his wife served as director. From 1902 onward, Harald Otto (1865–1928) was the theater manager and owner. Fahlstrøm featured a farewell performance of &quot;The Pillars of Society&quot; by Henrik Ibsen in 1911, after which he decided to retire from the stage.
The couple&#x27;s only child, Arne Jonas Fahlstrøm, was born in 1893. He died in the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster in 1912. Because they had no other children, they willed their fortune to the Norwegian Sea Rescue Society, which used the funds to purchase rescue boats that were named in honor of the couple&#x27;s son.

<doc id="799870" wikidata="Q7569001" url="?curid=799870" title="South Yorkshire Joint Railway">
<text>The South Yorkshire Joint Railway was a committee formed in 1903, between the Great Central Railway, the Great Northern Railway, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, the Midland Railway and the North Eastern Railway to oversee the construction of a new railway in the Doncaster area of South Yorkshire, England. The five companies had equal rights over the line, each of the companies regularly working trains over it.

The line&#x27;s passenger service terminated in 1929, but freight service continued, with eight collieries supplied at its height. Most of the collieries closed by the 1990s; but the line remained important for coal transportation both north and southwards to the Aire and Trent Valley power stations.

==History==

===Authorisation and operators===
Parliamentary permission to build the line was authorised with the passing of the &quot;South Yorkshire Joint Railway Act&quot; on 14 August 1903, and the formation of the South Yorkshire Joint Line Committee; formed from the railway companies: NER, L&amp;YR, GNR, MR, and GCR. The South Yorkshire Joint Railway act incorporated an earlier scheme, the &quot;Shireoaks Laughton &amp; Maltby Railway&quot; (Act passed 9 August 1901), a venture of the GCR and MR companies.

In the grouping of 1923, the Midland and L&amp;YR were grouped into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), whilst the GCR, GER and GNR were all grouped into the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). It thus remained an LMS-LNER joint line until nationalisation into British Railways in 1948.

===Route===
The line ran from Kirk Sandall Junction on the Great Central&#x27;s – (former South Yorkshire Railway) to join up with the Great Central and Midland Joint Railway at Dinnington junction. The NER had access over the GCR from Hull, the MR had access from the Nottingham-Worksop line, over GCR metals from , the L&amp;Y joined at St. Catherine&#x27;s Junction from its Dearne Valley Railway and the GNR had connections to the south of Doncaster. As opened, the SYJR was in length, including its colliery branch lines and connections to the several lines it crossed in its path. It opened to freight on 1 January 1909, and to passengers on 1 December 1910. The capital cost was almost £411,000.

The line initially served Markham Main, Yorkshire Main, Dinnington Main, Maltby Main, Thurcroft and Harry Crofts collieries. The largest amount of coal traffic originating on the line was recorded in 1929, almost 3 million tons. This was the result of the new Firbeck and Harworth collieries coming into full production and their branch lines becoming part of the SYJR. This produced a net revenue for the SYJR of £81,000 – equal to about £5.3 million in 2020 prices, an astonishing figure for a line (excluding sidings) of just under . By the end of 1929, capital expenditure on the SYJR had reached more than £710,000. As of 2010, only Maltby colliery was still producing coal, around 1.2 million tonnes a year according to the owners, but this last one closed in March 2013.

The route used encounters hilly country, and there are three viaducts, the largest being at the village of Slade Hooton one over the East Coast Main Line at Potteric Carr and the last being on the now lifted Harworth Branch passing over the A631 to the west of the village of Tickhill and, a rising gradient for most of its journey. The highest point of the line is in the vicinity of Brookhouse viaduct.

Maltby signal box which controlled train entry into and out of the colliery at Maltby is still operating and is the last mechanical Great Central type 5 designed signal box left on the line (built 1912), This box is actually within the town of Doncaster&#x27;s boundary – so technically the box is the last mechanical signal box still in operation within the town of Doncaster.(See British Ordnance Survey map for Doncaster area village of Stainton)

===Passenger services===
There were three stations on the railway, these being , and , all of them being situated away from the villages in their title. Four passenger trains each way daily were operated by the GCR and the GNR and these ran between , over the Great Northern Main Line as far as Potteric Carr junction, and Shireoaks. Services called at all stations on the SYJR and , on the Great Central and Midland Joint line. The joint passenger service operated for just one year before the GNR services were discontinued, reducing the service to two GCR trains with an extra one on Saturday. From April 1920, the service was extended to . Passenger traffic over the line was never great, with the largest total number of travellers – 60,220 – being recorded in 1913. The service became Saturdays-only in June 1917 until April 1920 but was suspended from April 1926 to July 1927 due to the 1926 general strike; this service was withdrawn altogether on 2 December 1929.

==Present day==
As of October 2020, the line, although only single track, is an important freight railway line; now coal traffic has ceased there is very little traffic over the route but recent traffic has been the transfer to store of LNER Mk4 coaches and DVTs in the Up side yard at Worksop. Network Rail operate their test trains over the route to and from Derby also. Route learning locomotives operate and the occasional off-route freight runs as well. There are plans to reroute the intermodal trains via Maltby over the South Yorkshire Joint line to the I-Port but no date has been given yet. Short spurs also connect the route with Doncaster Decoy Yard.

Doncaster International Railport, which opened in 2012 south-east of junction 3 of the M18 motorway, uses the line as its primary rail access point.

<doc id="799876" wikidata="Q598305" url="?curid=799876" title="Electric susceptibility">
<text>In electricity (electromagnetism), the electric susceptibility (formula_1; Latin: &quot;susceptibilis&quot; &quot;receptive&quot;) is a dimensionless proportionality constant that indicates the degree of polarization of a dielectric material in response to an applied electric field. The greater the electric susceptibility, the greater the ability of a material to polarize in response to the field, and thereby reduce the total electric field inside the material (and store energy). It is in this way that the electric susceptibility influences the electric permittivity of the material and thus influences many other phenomena in that medium, from the capacitance of capacitors to the speed of light.

==Definition for linear dielectrics==

If a dielectric material is a linear dielectric, then electric susceptibility is defined as the constant of proportionality (which may be a tensor) relating an electric field E to the induced dielectric polarization density P such that
formula_2
where
* formula_3 is the polarization density;
* formula_4 is the electric permittivity of free space (electric constant);
* formula_1 is the electric susceptibility;
* formula_6 is the electric field.

In materials where susceptibility is anisotropic (different depending on direction), susceptibility is represented as a tensor known as the susceptibility tensor. Many linear dielectrics are isotropic, but it is possible nevertheless for a material to display behavior that is both linear and anisotropic, or for a material to be non-linear but isotropic. Anisotropic but linear susceptibility is common in many crystals.

The susceptibility is related to its relative permittivity (dielectric constant) formula_7 by
formula_8
so in the case of a vacuum,
formula_9

At the same time, the electric displacement D is related to the polarization density P by the following relation:
formula_10
where 
* formula_11
* formula_12

==Molecular polarizability==

A similar parameter exists to relate the magnitude of the induced dipole moment p of an individual molecule to the local electric field E that induced the dipole. This parameter is the &quot;molecular polarizability&quot; (&quot;α&quot;), and the dipole moment resulting from the local electric field Elocal is given by:
formula_13

This introduces a complication however, as locally the field can differ significantly from the overall applied field. We have:
formula_14
where P is the polarization per unit volume, and &quot;N&quot; is the number of molecules per unit volume contributing to the polarization. Thus, if the local electric field is parallel to the ambient electric field, we have:
formula_15

Thus only if the local field equals the ambient field can we write:
formula_16

Otherwise, one should find a relation between the local and the macroscopic field. In some materials, the Clausius–Mossotti relation holds and reads
formula_17

===Ambiguity in the definition===

The definition of the molecular polarizability depends on the author. In the above definition,
formula_18
formula_19 and formula_20 are in SI units and the molecular polarizability formula_21 has the dimension of a volume (m3). Another definition would be to keep SI units and to integrate formula_4 into formula_21:

formula_24

In this second definition, the polarizability would have the SI unit of C.m2/V. Yet another definition exists where formula_19 and formula_20 are expressed in the cgs system and formula_21 is still defined as
formula_24

Using the cgs units gives formula_21 the dimension of a volume, as in the first definition, but with a value that is formula_30 lower.

== Nonlinear susceptibility ==

In many materials the polarizability starts to saturate at high values of electric field. This saturation can be modelled by a nonlinear susceptibility. These susceptibilities are important in nonlinear optics and lead to effects such as second-harmonic generation (such as used to convert infrared light into visible light, in green laser pointers).

The standard definition of nonlinear susceptibilities in SI units is via a Taylor expansion of the polarization&#x27;s reaction to electric field:
formula_31
(Except in ferroelectric materials, the built-in polarization is zero, formula_32.)
The first susceptibility term, formula_33, corresponds to the linear susceptibility described above. While this first term is dimensionless, the subsequent nonlinear susceptibilities formula_34 have units of .

The nonlinear susceptibilities can be generalized to anisotropic materials in which the susceptibility is not uniform in every direction. In these materials, each susceptibility formula_34 becomes an ()-degree tensor.

==Dispersion and causality==

In general, a material cannot polarize instantaneously in response to an applied field, and so the more general formulation as a function of time is
formula_36

That is, the polarization is a convolution of the electric field at previous times with time-dependent susceptibility given by formula_37. The upper limit of this integral can be extended to infinity as well if one defines formula_38 for formula_39. An instantaneous response corresponds to Dirac delta function susceptibility formula_40.

It is more convenient in a linear system to take the Fourier transform and write this relationship as a function of frequency. Due to the convolution theorem, the integral becomes a product,
formula_41

This has a similar form to the Clausius–Mossotti relation:
formula_42

This frequency dependence of the susceptibility leads to frequency dependence of the permittivity. The shape of the susceptibility with respect to frequency characterizes the dispersion properties of the material.

Moreover, the fact that the polarization can only depend on the electric field at previous times (i.e. formula_38 for formula_39), a consequence of causality, imposes Kramers–Kronig constraints on the susceptibility formula_45.

<text>Marie Eleonor Serneholt (; born 11 July 1983) is a Swedish singer and model. She was a member of the Swedish pop band A*Teens from 1998 to 2004, and briefly pursued a solo recording career after the band dissolved.

==Career==

===A*Teens (1998–2006)===
In 1998, Serneholt signed a recording deal with Stockholm Records (part of Universal Music Group) along with her bandmates Sara Lumholdt, Dhani Lennevald, and Amit Sebastian Paul. Together they performed as the A*Teens. In 1999, they released their first single, a cover of Swedish pop group ABBA&#x27;s &quot;Mamma Mia&quot;. The single topped the charts in Sweden for eight consecutive weeks, and achieved international success.

By 2000, the A*Teens&#x27; first album, &quot;The ABBA Generation&quot;, had sold two million copies, and they became one of the most internationally successful Swedish pop bands. By 2001, the group had sold more than six million albums. In 2004, it released a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album, and in 2006 the group broke up.

===Music hiatus (2005)===
With the A*Teens split, it was rumored that Serneholt would be the first to pursue a solo career. This proved to be unfounded when Lennevald released his debut single in September 2004. In 2005, Serneholt was picked as the face of the Maybelline cosmetics line in Scandinavia. She also gave her voice for the Swedish versions of the movies &quot;Robots&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

===&quot;Enjoy the Ride&quot; (2006–2008)===
In 2005, Serneholt called Jörgen Elofsson, who had written music for Britney Spears and Céline Dion. Elofsson was busy with other artists at the time, but Serneholt was adamant to have him produce an album for her. When she contacted him again later that year, he had just started collaborating with two relatively young and unknown producers, Richard Brandén and Pär Westerlund.

Elofsson created the label Planet Six (a part of Sony BMG), and Serneholt signed her first recording deal as a solo artist. In February 2006, Serneholt&#x27;s first single, &quot;That&#x27;s The Way My Heart Goes&quot;, premiered on Swedish radio with decent reviews and good response from the public. The single debuted at No. 2 on the Swedish Charts and reached No. 1 on the official Swedish Digital Downloads Chart, ensuring Gold Status on physical sales alone on 19 May 2006.

The album &quot;Enjoy the Ride&quot; was released on 29 March 2006, debuting at No. 9 in her home country but dropping off the charts quickly, while the single&#x27;s success was growing around the world with releases throughout Europe along with the album and with plans to release it in South and North America in 2007. In May 2006, Serneholt started a promotional tour in Germany coinciding with the German release of her album. She embarked on a Radio Station&#x27;s Concert Tour of Sweden and Finland. In June, Serneholt released her second single, &quot;I Need a House&quot;, which debuted at No. 2 on the Swedish Digital Downloads Chart, but failed on the physical sales as it reached only No. 40 in Sweden. The single was released in Europe in September 2006. On 19 August 2006, Serneholt performed at Voice &#x27;06 in the Kungsträdgården park in Stockholm.

===2009–present===
On 3 December 2008, SVT confirmed Serneholt as the third of four wildcard artists for Melodifestivalen 2009. On 7 February 2009, during the first semi-final heat, she performed her new single, &quot;Disconnect Me&quot;. She placed sixth of eight and did not advance to the finals. &quot;Disconnect Me&quot; (which also served as the first single from Serneholt&#x27;s second album) was released on 25 February 2009.

She worked with Filip Cederholm on the album photoshoots and artwork. She co-hosted Sveriges Television&#x27;s broadcast of the National Day of Sweden celebrations in 2009 alongside André Pops.

In October 2009, it was announced that she would appear in a Swedish-language version of the musical &quot;Grease&quot;, resulting in fans questioning whether a follow-up to &quot;Enjoy the Ride&quot; would ever be released.

Alongside Rickard Olsson, she co-hosted the semi-finals and finals of the Melodifestivalen 2011 contest. In December 2011, she released a new single, &quot;Himlen i min famn&quot;, under Warner Music Sweden. She participated in the first semi-final of Melodifestivalen 2012 which was held on 4 February 2012 in Vida Arena, Växjö. She sang the song &quot;Salt &amp; Pepper&quot;, composed by Lina Eriksson, Mårten Eriksson, and Figge Boström. She finished sixth in the first round of voting and so was eliminated from the competition. Serneholt presented the Sjuan&#x27;s channel bingo show &quot;Bingolotto&quot; for two seasons in 2013–14.

Serneholt was announced as one of the judges of the Swedish version of popular talent show &quot;The X Factor&quot;, which premiered on 9 September 2012. She competed as one of the celebrity dancers in &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance 2015&quot;, broadcast on TV4, where she was the runner-up. In August 2015, she co-hosted the Swedish game show &quot;Fångarna på Fortet&quot; (alongside Gunde Svan) at Fort Boyard for TV4, after Agneta Sjödin was injured in a bicycle accident. In October 2015 it was announced that Serneholt would host the baking show &quot;Det stora tårtslaget&quot; on Sjuan in 2016.

==Personal life==
Serneholt has twin boys.

<doc id="799881" wikidata="Q443153" url="?curid=799881" title="Early Netherlandish painting">
<text>Early Netherlandish painting is the body of work by artists active in the Burgundian and Habsburg Netherlands during the 15th- and 16th-century Northern Renaissance period, once known as the Flemish Primitives. It flourished especially in the cities of Bruges, Ghent, Mechelen, Leuven, Tournai and Brussels, all in present-day Belgium. The period begins approximately with Robert Campin and Jan van Eyck in the 1420s and lasts at least until the death of Gerard David in 1523, although many scholars extend it to the beginning of the Dutch Revolt in 1566 or 1568–Max J. Friedländer&#x27;s acclaimed surveys run through Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Early Netherlandish painting coincides with the Early and High Italian Renaissance, but the early period (until about 1500) is seen as an independent artistic evolution, separate from the Renaissance humanism that characterised developments in Italy. Beginning in the 1490s, as increasing numbers of Netherlandish and other Northern painters traveled to Italy, Renaissance ideals and painting styles were incorporated into northern painting. As a result, Early Netherlandish painters are often categorised as belonging to both the Northern Renaissance and the Late or International Gothic.

The major Netherlandish painters include Campin, van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden, Dieric Bouts, Petrus Christus, Hans Memling, Hugo van der Goes and Hieronymus Bosch. These artists made significant advances in natural representation and illusionism, and their work typically features complex iconography. Their subjects are usually religious scenes or small portraits, with narrative painting or mythological subjects being relatively rare. Landscape is often richly described but relegated as a background detail before the early 16th century. The painted works are generally oil on panel, either as single works or more complex portable or fixed altarpieces in the form of diptychs, triptychs or polyptychs. The period is also noted for its sculpture, tapestries, illuminated manuscripts, stained glass and carved retables.

The first generations of artists were active during the height of Burgundian influence in Europe, when the Low Countries became the political and economic centre of Northern Europe, noted for its crafts and luxury goods. Assisted by the workshop system, panels and a variety of crafts were sold to foreign princes or merchants through private engagement or market stalls. A majority of the works were destroyed during waves of iconoclasm in the 16th and 17th centuries; today only a few thousand examples survive.

Early northern art in general was not well regarded from the early 17th to the mid-19th century, and the painters and their works were not well documented until the mid-19th century. Art historians spent almost another century determining attributions, studying iconography, and establishing bare outlines of even the major artists&#x27; lives; attribution of some of the most significant works is still debated. Scholarship of Early Netherlandish painting was one of the main activities of 19th- and 20th-century art history, and a major focus of two of the most important art historians of the 20th century: Max J. Friedländer (&quot;From Van Eyck to Breugel&quot; and &quot;Early Netherlandish Painting&quot;) and Erwin Panofsky (&quot;Early Netherlandish Painting&quot; only covering artists up to Hieronymus Bosch who died in 1516).

==Terminology and scope==
The term &quot;Early Netherlandish art&quot; applies broadly to painters active during the 15th and 16th centuries in the northern European areas controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy and later the Habsburg dynasty. These artists became an early driving force behind the Northern Renaissance and the move away from the Gothic style. In this political and art-historical context, the north follows the Burgundian lands which straddled areas that encompass parts of modern France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands.

The Netherlandish artists have been known by a variety of terms. &quot;Late Gothic&quot; is an early designation which emphasises continuity with the art of the Middle Ages. In the early 20th century, the artists were variously referred to in English as the &quot;Ghent-Bruges school&quot; or the &quot;Old Netherlandish school&quot;. &quot;Flemish Primitives&quot; is a traditional art-historical term borrowed from the French &quot;primitifs flamands&quot; that became popular after the famous exhibition in Bruges in 1902 and remains in use today, especially in Dutch and German. In this context, &quot;primitive&quot; does not refer to a perceived lack of sophistication, but rather identifies the artists as originators of a new tradition in painting. Erwin Panofsky preferred the term &quot;ars nova&quot; (&quot;new art&quot;), which linked the movement with innovative composers of music such as Guillaume Dufay and Gilles Binchois, who were favoured by the Burgundian court over artists attached to the lavish French court. When the Burgundian dukes established centres of power in the Netherlands, they brought with them a more cosmopolitan outlook. According to Otto Pächt a simultaneous shift in art began sometime between 1406 and 1420 when a &quot;revolution took place in painting&quot;; a &quot;new beauty&quot; in art emerged, one that depicted the visible rather than the metaphysical world.

In the 19th century, the Early Netherlandish artists were classified by nationality, with Jan van Eyck identified as German and van der Weyden (born Roger de la Pasture) as French. Scholars were at times preoccupied as to whether the school&#x27;s genesis was in France or Germany. These arguments and distinctions dissipated after World War I, and following the leads of Friedländer, Panofsky, and Pächt, English-language scholars now almost universally describe the period as &quot;Early Netherlandish painting&quot;, although many art historians view the Flemish term as more correct.

In the 14th century, as Gothic art gave way to the International Gothic era, a number of schools developed in northern Europe. Early Netherlandish art originated in French courtly art, and is especially tied to the tradition and conventions of illuminated manuscripts. Modern art historians see the era as beginning with 14th-century manuscript illuminators. They were followed by panel painters such as Melchior Broederlam and Robert Campin, the latter generally considered the first Early Netherlandish master, under whom van der Weyden served his apprenticeship. Illumination reached a peak in the region in the decades after 1400, mainly due to the patronage of Burgundian and House of Valois-Anjou dukes such as Philip the Bold, Louis I of Anjou and Jean, Duke of Berry. This patronage continued in the low countries with the Burgundian dukes, Philip the Good and his son Charles the Bold. The demand for illuminated manuscripts declined towards the end of the century, perhaps because of the costly production process in comparison to panel painting. Yet illumination remained popular at the luxury end of the market, and prints, both engravings and woodcuts, found a new mass market, especially those by artists such as Martin Schongauer and Albrecht Dürer.
Following van Eyck&#x27;s innovations, the first generation of Netherlandish painters emphasised light and shadow, elements usually absent from 14th-century illuminated manuscripts. Biblical scenes were depicted with more naturalism, which made their content more accessible to viewers, while individual portraits became more evocative and alive. Johan Huizinga said that art of the era was meant to be fully integrated with daily routine, to &quot;fill with beauty&quot; the devotional life in a world closely tied to the liturgy and sacraments. After about 1500 a number of factors turned against the pervasive Northern style, not least the rise of Italian art, whose commercial appeal began to rival Netherlandish art by 1510, and overtook it some ten years later. Two events symbolically and historically reflect this shift: the transporting of a marble &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; by Michelangelo to Bruges in 1506, and the arrival of Raphael&#x27;s tapestry cartoons to Brussels in 1517, which were widely seen while in the city. Although the influence of Italian art was soon widespread across the north, it in turn had drawn on the 15th-century northern painters, with Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;Madonna&quot; based on a type developed by Hans Memling.

Netherlandish painting ends in the narrowest sense with the death of Gerard David in 1523. A number of mid- and late-16th-century artists maintained many of the conventions, and they are frequently but not always associated with the school. The style of these painters is often dramatically at odds with that of the first generation of artists. In the early 16th century, artists began to explore illusionistic depictions of three dimensions. The painting of the early 16th century can be seen as leading directly from the artistic innovations and iconography of the previous century, with some painters, following the traditional and established formats and symbolism of the previous century, continuing to produce copies of previously painted works. Others came under the influence of Renaissance humanism, turning towards secular narrative cycles, as biblical imagery was blended with mythological themes. A full break from the mid-15th-century style and subject matter was not seen until the development of Northern Mannerism around 1590. There was considerable overlap, and the early- to mid-16th-century innovations can be tied to the Mannerist style, including naturalistic secular portraiture, the depiction of ordinary (as opposed to courtly) life, and the development of elaborate landscapes and cityscapes that were more than background views.

==Chronology==
The origins of the Early Netherlandish school lie in the miniature paintings of the late Gothic period. This was first seen in manuscript illumination, which after 1380 conveyed new levels of realism, perspective and skill in rendering colour, peaking with the Limbourg brothers and the Netherlandish artist known as Hand G, to whom the most significant leaves of the Turin-Milan Hours are usually attributed. Although his identity has not been definitively established, Hand G, who contributed c. 1420, is thought to have been either Jan van Eyck or his brother Hubert. According to Georges Hulin de Loo, Hand G&#x27;s contributions to the Turin-Milan Hours &quot;constitute the most marvelous group of paintings that have ever decorated any book, and, for their period, the most astounding work known to the history of art&quot;.

Jan van Eyck&#x27;s use of oil as a medium was a significant development, allowing artists far greater manipulation of paint. The 16th-century art historian Giorgio Vasari claimed van Eyck invented the use of oil paint; a claim that, while exaggerated, indicates the extent to which van Eyck helped disseminate the technique. Van Eyck employed a new level of virtuosity, mainly from taking advantage of the fact that oil dries so slowly; this gave him more time and more scope for blending and mixing layers of different pigments, and his technique was quickly adopted and refined by both Robert Campin and Rogier van der Weyden. These three artists are considered the first rank and most influential of the early generation of Early Netherlandish painters. Their influence was felt across northern Europe, from Bohemia and Poland in the east to Austria and Swabia in the south.
A number of artists traditionally associated with the movement had origins that were neither Dutch nor Flemish in the modern sense. Van der Weyden was born Roger de la Pasture in Tournai. The German Hans Memling and the Estonian Michael Sittow both worked in the Netherlands in a fully Netherlandish style. Simon Marmion is often regarded as an Early Netherlandish painter because he came from Amiens, an area intermittently ruled by the Burgundian court between 1435 and 1471. The Burgundian duchy was at its peak influence, and the innovations made by the Netherlandish painters were soon recognised across the continent. By the time of van Eyck&#x27;s death, his paintings were sought by wealthy patrons across Europe. Copies of his works were widely circulated, a fact that greatly contributed to the spread of the Netherlandish style to central and southern Europe. Central European art was then under the dual influence of innovations from Italy and from the north. Often the exchange of ideas between the Low Countries and Italy led to patronage from nobility such as Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, who commissioned manuscripts from both traditions.

The first generation were literate, well educated and mostly from middle-class backgrounds. Van Eyck and van der Weyden were both highly placed in the Burgundian court, with van Eyck in particular assuming roles for which an ability to read Latin was necessary; inscriptions found on his panels indicate that he had a good knowledge of both Latin and Greek. A number of artists were financially successful and much sought-after in the Low Countries and by patrons across Europe. Many artists, including David and Bouts, could afford to donate large works to the churches, monasteries and convents of their choosing. Van Eyck was a valet de chambre at the Burgundian court and had easy access to Philip the Good. Van der Weyden was a prudent investor in stocks and property; Bouts was commercially minded and married the heiress Catherine &quot;Mettengelde&quot; (&quot;with the money&quot;). Vrancke van der Stockt invested in land.

The Early Netherlandish masters&#x27; influence reached artists such as Stefan Lochner and the painter known as the Master of the Life of the Virgin, both of whom, working in mid-15th-century Cologne, drew inspiration from imported works by van der Weyden and Bouts. New and distinctive painterly cultures sprang up; Ulm, Nuremberg, Vienna and Munich were the most important artistic centres in the Holy Roman Empire at the start of the 16th century. There was a rise in demand for printmaking (using woodcuts or copperplate engraving) and other innovations borrowed from France and southern Italy. Some 16th-century painters borrowed heavily from the previous century&#x27;s techniques and styles. Even progressive artists such as Jan Gossaert made copies, such as his reworking of van Eyck&#x27;s &quot;Madonna in the Church&quot;. Gerard David linked the styles of Bruges and Antwerp, often travelling between the cities. He moved to Antwerp in 1505, when Quentin Matsys was the head of the local painters&#x27; guild, and the two became friends.

By the 16th century the iconographic innovations and painterly techniques developed by van Eyck had become standard throughout northern Europe. Albrecht Dürer emulated van Eyck&#x27;s precision. Painters enjoyed a new level of respect and status; patrons no longer simply commissioned works but courted the artists, sponsoring their travel and exposing them to new and wide-ranging influences. Hieronymus Bosch, active in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, remains one of the most important and popular of the Netherlandish painters. He was anomalous in that he largely forwent realistic depictions of nature, human existence and perspective, while his work is almost entirely free of Italian influences. His better-known works are instead characterised by fantastical elements that tend towards the hallucinatory, drawing to some extent from the vision of hell in van Eyck&#x27;s &quot;Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych&quot;. Bosch followed his own muse, tending instead towards moralism and pessimism. His paintings, especially the triptychs, are among the most significant and accomplished of the late Netherlandish period.

The Reformation brought changes in outlook and artistic expression as secular and landscape imagery overtook biblical scenes. Sacred imagery was shown in a didactic and moralistic manner, with religious figures becoming marginalized and relegated to the background. Pieter Bruegel the Elder, one of the few who followed Bosch&#x27;s style, is an important bridge between the Early Netherlandish artists and their successors. His work retains many 15th-century conventions, but his perspective and subjects are distinctly modern. Sweeping landscapes came to the fore in paintings that were provisionally religious or mythological, and his genre scenes were complex, with overtones of religious skepticism and even hints of nationalism.

==Technique and material==
Campin, van Eyck and van der Weyden established naturalism as the dominant style in 15th-century northern European painting. These artists sought to show the world as it actually was, and to depict people in a way that made them look more human, with a greater complexity of emotions than had been previously seen. This first generation of Early Netherlandish artists were interested in the accurate reproduction of objects (according to Panofsky they painted &quot;gold that looked like gold&quot;), paying close attention to natural phenomena such as light, shadow and reflection. They moved beyond the flat perspective and outlined figuration of earlier painting in favour of three-dimensional pictorial spaces. The position of viewers and how they might relate to the scene became important for the first time; in the &quot;Arnolfini Portrait&quot;, van Eyck arranges the scene as if the viewer has just entered the room containing the two figures. Advancements in technique allowed far richer, more luminous and closely detailed representations of people, landscapes, interiors and objects.
Although, the use of oil as a binding agent can be traced to the 12th century, innovations in its handling and manipulation define the era. Egg tempera was the dominant medium until the 1430s, and while it produces both bright and light colours, it dries quickly and is a difficult medium in which to achieve naturalistic textures or deep shadows. Oil allows smooth, translucent surfaces and can be applied in a range of thicknesses, from fine lines to thick broad strokes. It dries slowly and is easily manipulated while still wet. These characteristics allowed more time to add subtle detail and enable wet-on-wet techniques. Smooth transitions of colour are possible because portions of the intermediary layers of paint can be wiped or removed as the paint dries. Oil enables differentiation among degrees of reflective light, from shadow to bright beams, and minute depictions of light effects through the use of transparent glazes. This new freedom in controlling light effects gave rise to more precise and realistic depictions of surface textures; van Eyck and van der Weyden typically show light falling on surfaces such as jewellery, wooden floors, textiles and household objects.

The paintings were most often made on wood, but sometimes on the less expensive canvas. The wood was usually oak, often imported from the Baltic region, with the preference for radially cut boards which are less likely to warp. Typically the sap was removed and the board well-seasoned before use. Wood supports allow for dendrochronological dating, and the particular use of Baltic oak gives clues as to the artist&#x27;s location. The panels generally show very high degrees of craftsmanship. Lorne Campbell notes that most are &quot;beautifully made and finished objects. It can be extremely difficult to find the joins&quot;. Many paintings&#x27; frames were altered, repainted or gilded in the 18th and early 19th centuries when it was common practice to break apart hinged Netherlandish pieces so they could be sold as genre pieces. Many surviving panels are painted on both sides or with the reverse bearing family emblems, crests or ancillary outline sketches. In the case of single panels, the markings on the reverse are often wholly unrelated to the obverse and may be later additions, or as Campbell speculates, &quot;done for the artist&#x27;s amusement&quot;. Painting each side of a panel was practical since it prevented the wood from warping. Usually the frames of hinged works were constructed before the individual panels were worked on.

Glue binder was often used as an inexpensive alternative to oil. Many works using this medium were produced but few survive today because of the delicateness of the linen cloth and the solubility of the hide glue from which the binder was derived. Well known and relatively well preserved – though substantially damaged – examples include Matsys&#x27; &quot;Virgin and Child with Saints Barbara and Catherine&quot; (c. 1415–25) and Bouts&#x27; &quot;Entombment&quot; (c. 1440–55). The paint was generally applied with brushes or sometimes with thin sticks or brush handles. The artists often softened the contours of shadows with their fingers, at times to blot or reduce the glaze.

==Guilds and workshops==
The most usual way in the 15th century for a patron to commission a piece was to visit a master&#x27;s workshop. Only a certain number of masters could operate within any city&#x27;s bounds; they were regulated by artisan guilds to whom they had to be affiliated to be allowed to operate and receive commissions. Guilds protected and regulated painting, overseeing production, export trade and raw material supply; and they maintained discrete sets of rules for panel painters, cloth painters and book illuminators. For example, the rules set higher citizenship requirements for miniaturists and prohibited them from using oils. Overall, panel painters enjoyed the highest level of protection, with cloth painters ranking below.

Membership of a guild was highly restricted and access was difficult for newcomers. A master was expected to serve an apprenticeship in his region, and show proof of citizenship, which could be obtained through birth in the city or by purchase. Apprenticeship lasted four to five years, ending with the production of a &quot;masterpiece&quot; that proved his ability as a craftsman, and the payment of a substantial entrance fee. The system was protectionist at a local level through the nuances of the fee system. Although it sought to ensure a high quality of membership, it was a self-governing body that tended to favour wealthy applicants. Guild connections sometimes appear in paintings, most famously in van der Weyden&#x27;s &quot;Descent from the Cross&quot;, in which Christ&#x27;s body is given the t-shape of a crossbow to reflect its commission for a chapel for the Leuven guild of archers.

Workshops typically consisted of a family home for the master and lodging for apprentices. The masters usually built up inventories of pre-painted panels as well as patterns or outline designs for ready sale. With the former, the master was responsible for the overall design of the painting, and typically painted the focal portions, such as the faces, hands and the embroidered parts of the figure&#x27;s clothing. The more prosaic elements would be left to assistants; in many works it is possible to discern abrupt shifts in style, with the relatively weak Deesis passage in van Eyck&#x27;s &quot;Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych&quot; being a better-known example. Often a master&#x27;s workshop was occupied with both the reproduction of copies of proven commercially successful works, and the design of new compositions arising from commissions. In this case, the master would usually produce the underdrawing or overall composition to be painted by assistants. As a result, many surviving works that evidence first-rank compositions but uninspired execution are attributed to workshop members or followers.

==Patronage==
By the 15th century the reach and influence of the Burgundian princes meant that the Low Countries&#x27; merchant and banker classes were in the ascendancy. The early to mid-century saw great rises in international trade and domestic wealth, leading to an enormous increase in the demand for art. Artists from the area attracted patronage from the Baltic coast, the north German and Polish regions, the Iberian Peninsula, Italy and the powerful families of England and Scotland. At first, masters had acted as their own dealers, attending fairs where they could also buy frames, panels and pigments. The mid-century saw the development of art dealership as a profession; the activity became purely commercially driven, dominated by the mercantile class.
Smaller works were not usually produced on commission. More often the masters anticipated the formats and images that would be most sought after and their designs were then developed by workshop members. Ready made paintings were sold at regularly held fairs, or the buyers could visit workshops, which tended to be clustered in certain areas of the major cities. The masters were allowed to display in their front windows. This was the typical mode for the thousands of panels produced for the middle class – city officials, clergy, guild members, doctors and merchants.

Less expensive cloth paintings (&quot;tüchlein&quot;) were more common in middle-class households, and records show a strong interest in domestically owned religious panel paintings. Members of the merchant class typically commissioned smaller devotional panels, containing specified subject matter. Alterations varied from having individualised panels added to a prefabricated pattern, to the inclusion of a donor portrait. The addition of coats-of-arms were often the only change – an addition seen in van der Weyden&#x27;s &quot;Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin&quot;, which exists in several variations.

Many of the Burgundian dukes could afford to be extravagant in their taste. Philip the Good followed the example set earlier in France by his great-uncles including Jean, Duke of Berry by becoming a strong patron of the arts and commissioning a large number of artworks. The Burgundian court was seen as the arbiter of taste and their appreciation in turn drove demand for highly luxurious and expensive illuminated manuscripts, gold-edged tapestries and jewel-bordered cups. Their appetite for finery trickled down through their court and nobles to the people who for the most part commissioned local artists in Bruges and Ghent in the 1440s and 1450s. While Netherlandish panel paintings did not have intrinsic value as did for example objects in precious metals, they were perceived as precious objects and in the first rank of European art. A 1425 document written by Philip the Good explains that he hired a painter for the &quot;excellent work that he does in his craft&quot;. Jan van Eyck painted the &quot;Annunciation&quot; while in Philip&#x27;s employ, and Rogier van der Weyden became the duke&#x27;s portrait painter in the 1440s.
Burgundian rule created a large class of courtiers and functionaries. Some gained enormous power and commissioned paintings to display their wealth and influence. Civic leaders also commissioned works from major artists, such as Bouts&#x27; &quot;Justice for Emperor Otto III&quot;, van der Weyden&#x27;s &quot;The Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald&quot; and David&#x27;s &quot;Justice of Cambyses&quot;. Civic commissions were less common and were not as lucrative, but they brought notice to and increased a painter&#x27;s reputation, as with Memling, whose &quot;St John Altarpiece&quot; for Bruges&#x27; Sint-Janshospitaal brought him additional civic commissions.

Wealthy foreign patronage and the development of international trade afforded the established masters the chance to build up workshops with assistants. Although first-rank painters such as Petrus Christus and Hans Memling found patrons among the local nobility, they catered specifically to the large foreign population in Bruges. Painters not only exported goods but also themselves; foreign princes and nobility, striving to emulate the opulence of the Burgundian court, hired painters away from Bruges.

==Iconography==

The paintings of the first generation of Netherlandish artists are often characterised by the use of symbolism and biblical references. Van Eyck pioneered, and his innovations were taken up and developed by van der Weyden, Memling and Christus. Each employed rich and complex iconographical elements to create a heightened sense of contemporary beliefs and spiritual ideals. Morally the works express a fearful outlook, combined with a respect for restraint and stoicism. The paintings above all emphasise the spiritual over the earthly. Because the cult of Mary was at an apex at the time, iconographic elements related to the &quot;Life of Mary&quot; vastly predominate.

Craig Harbison describes the blending of realism and symbolism as perhaps &quot;the most important aspect of early Flemish art&quot;. The first generation of Netherlandish painters were preoccupied with making religious symbols more realistic. Van Eyck incorporated a wide variety of iconographic elements, often conveying what he saw as a co-existence of the spiritual and material worlds. The iconography was embedded in the work unobtrusively; typically the references comprised small but key background details. The embedded symbols were meant to meld into the scenes and were &quot;a deliberate strategy to create an experience of spiritual revelation&quot;. Van Eyck&#x27;s religious paintings in particular &quot;always present the spectator with a transfigured view of visible reality&quot;. To him the day-to-day is harmoniously steeped in symbolism, such that, according to Harbison, &quot;descriptive data were rearranged ... so that they illustrated not earthly existence but what he considered supernatural truth.&quot; This blend of the earthly and heavenly evidences van Eyck&#x27;s belief that the &quot;essential truth of Christian doctrine&quot; can be found in &quot;the marriage of secular and sacred worlds, of reality and symbol&quot;. He depicts overly large Madonnas, whose unrealistic size shows the separation between the heavenly from earthly, but placed them in everyday settings such as churches, domestic chambers or seated with court officials.

Yet the earthly churches are heavily decorated with heavenly symbols. A heavenly throne is clearly represented in some domestic chambers (for example in the &quot;Lucca Madonna&quot;). More difficult to discern are the settings for paintings such as &quot;Madonna of Chancellor Rolin&quot;, where the location is a fusion of the earthly and celestial. Van Eyck&#x27;s iconography is often so densely and intricately layered that a work has to be viewed multiple times before even the most obvious meaning of an element is apparent. The symbols were often subtly woven into the paintings so that they only became apparent after close and repeated viewing, while much of the iconography reflects the idea that, according to John Ward, there is a &quot;promised passage from sin and death to salvation and rebirth&quot;.

Other artists employed symbolism in a more prosaic manner, despite van Eyck&#x27;s great influence on both his contemporaries and later artists. Campin showed a clear separation between spiritual and earthly realms; unlike van Eyck, he did not employ a programme of concealed symbolism. Campin&#x27;s symbols do not alter the sense of the real; in his paintings a domestic scene is no more complicated than a one showing religious iconography, but one the viewer would recognise and understand. Van der Weyden&#x27;s symbolism was far more nuanced than Campin&#x27;s but not as dense as van Eyck&#x27;s. According to Harbison, van der Weyden incorporated his symbols so carefully, and in such an exquisite manner, that &quot;Neither the mystical union that results in his work, nor his reality itself for that matter, seems capable of being rationally analyzed, explained or reconstructed.&quot; His treatment of architectural details, niches, colour and space is presented in such an inexplicable manner that &quot;the particular objects or people we see before us have suddenly, jarringly, become symbols with religious truth&quot;.
Paintings and other precious objects served an important aid in the religious life of those who could afford them. Prayer and meditative contemplation were means to attain salvation, while the very wealthy could also build churches (or extend existing ones), or commission artworks or other devotional pieces as a means to guarantee salvation in the afterlife. Vast numbers of Virgin and Child paintings were produced, and original designs were widely copied and exported. Many of the paintings were based on Byzantine prototypes of the 12th and 13th centuries, of which the &quot;Cambrai Madonna&quot; is probably the best known. In this way the traditions of the earlier centuries were absorbed and re-developed as a distinctly rich and complex iconographical tradition.

Marian devotion grew from the 13th century, mostly forming around the concepts of the Immaculate Conception and her Assumption into heaven. In a culture that venerated the possession of relics as a means to bring the earthly closer to the divine, Mary left no bodily relics, thus assuming a special position between heaven and humanity. By the early 15th century, Mary had grown in importance within the Christian doctrine to the extent that she was commonly seen as the most accessible intercessor with God. It was thought that the length each person would need to suffer in limbo was proportional to their display of devotion while on earth. The veneration of Mary reached a peak in the early 15th century, an era that saw an unending demand for works depicting her likeness. From the mid-15th century, Netherlandish portrayals of the life of Christ tended to be centred on the iconography of the Man of Sorrows.

Those who could afford to commissioned donor portraits. Such a commission was usually executed as part of a triptych, or later as a more affordable diptych. Van der Weyden popularised the existing northern tradition of half-length Marian portraits. These echoed the &quot;miracle-working&quot; Byzantine icons then popular in Italy. The format became extremely popular across the north, and his innovations are an important contributing factor to the emergence of the Marian diptych.
==Formats==
Although the Netherlandish artists are primarily known for their panel paintings, their output includes a variety of formats, including illuminated manuscripts, sculpture, tapestries, carved retables, stained glass, brass objects and carved tombs. According to art historian Susie Nash, by the early 16th century, the region led the field in almost every aspect of portable visual culture, &quot;with specialist expertise and techniques of production at such a high level that no one else could compete with them&quot;. The Burgundian court favoured tapestry and metalwork, which are well recorded in surviving documentation, while demand for panel paintings is less evident – they may have been less suited to itinerant courts. Wall hangings and books functioned as political propaganda and as a means to showcase wealth and power, whereas portraits were less favoured. According to Maryan Ainsworth, those that were commissioned functioned to highlight lines of succession, such as van der Weyden&#x27;s of Charles the Bold; or for betrothals as in the case of van Eyck&#x27;s lost &quot;Portrait of Isabella of Portugal&quot;.

Religious paintings were commissioned for royal and ducal palaces, for churches, hospitals, and convents, and for wealthy clerics and private donors. The richer cities and towns commissioned works for their civic buildings. Artists often worked in more than one medium; van Eyck and Petrus Christus are both thought to have contributed to manuscripts. Van der Weyden designed tapestries, though few survive. The Netherlandish painters were responsible for many innovations, including the advancement of the diptych format, the conventions of donor portraits, new conventions for Marian portraits, and, through works such as van Eyck&#x27;s &quot;Madonna of Chancellor Rolin&quot; and van der Weyden&#x27;s &quot;Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin&quot; in the 1430s, laying the foundation for the development of landscape painting as a separate genre.

===Illuminated manuscript===

Before the mid-15th century, illuminated books were considered a higher form of art than panel painting, and their ornate and luxurious qualities better reflected the wealth, status and taste of their owners. Manuscripts were ideally suited as diplomatic gifts or offerings to commemorate dynastic marriages or other major courtly occasions. From the 12th century, specialist monastery-based workshops (in French &quot;libraires&quot;) produced books of hours (collections of prayers to be said at canonical hours), psalters, prayer books and histories, as well as romance and poetry books. At the start of the 15th century, Gothic manuscripts from Paris dominated the northern European market. Their popularity was in part due to the production of more affordable, single leaf miniatures which could be inserted into unillustrated books of hours. These were at times offered in a serial manner designed to encourage patrons to &quot;include as many pictures as they could afford&quot;, which clearly presented them as an item of fashion but also as a form of indulgence. The single leaves had other uses rather than inserts; they could be attached to walls as aids to private meditation and prayer, as seen in Christus&#x27; 1450–60 panel &quot;Portrait of a Young Man&quot;, now in the National Gallery, which shows a small leaf with text to the &quot;Vera icon&quot; illustrated with the head of Christ. The French artists were overtaken in importance from the mid-15th century by masters in Ghent, Bruges and Utrecht. English production, once of the highest quality, had greatly declined and relatively few Italian manuscripts went north of the Alps. The French masters did not give up their position easily however, and even in 1463 were urging their guilds to impose sanctions on the Netherlandish artists.

The Limbourg brothers&#x27; ornate &quot;Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry&quot; perhaps marks both the beginning and a highpoint of Netherlandish illumination. Later the Master of the Legend of Saint Lucy explored the same mix of illusionism and realism. The Limbourgs&#x27; career ended just as van Eyck&#x27;s began – by 1416 all the brothers (none of whom had reached 30) and their patron Jean, Duke of Berry were dead, most likely from plague. Van Eyck is thought to have contributed several of the more acclaimed miniatures of the Turin-Milan Hours as the anonymous artist known as Hand G. A number of illustrations from the period show a strong stylistic resemblance to Gerard David, though it is unclear whether they are from his hands or those of followers.
A number of factors led to the popularity of Netherlandish illuminators. Primary was the tradition and expertise that developed in the region in the centuries following the monastic reform of the 14th century, building on the growth in number and prominence of monasteries, abbeys and churches from the 12th century that had already produced significant numbers of liturgical texts. There was a strong political aspect; the form had many influential patrons such as Jean, Duke of Berry and Philip the Good, the latter of whom collected more than a thousand illuminated books before his death. According to Thomas Kren, Philip&#x27;s &quot;library was an expression of the man as a Christian prince, and an embodiment of the state – his politics and authority, his learning and piety&quot;. Because of his patronage the manuscript industry in the Lowlands grew so that it dominated Europe for several generations. The Burgundian book-collecting tradition passed to Philip&#x27;s son and his wife, Charles the Bold and Margaret of York; his granddaughter Mary of Burgundy and her husband Maximilian I; and to his son-in-law, Edward IV, who was an avid collector of Flemish manuscripts. The libraries left by Philip and Edward IV formed the nucleus from which sprang the Royal Library of Belgium and the English Royal Library.

Netherlandish illuminators had an important export market, designing many works specifically for the English market. Following a decline in domestic patronage after Charles the Bold died in 1477, the export market became more important. Illuminators responded to differences in taste by producing more lavish and extravagantly decorated works tailored for foreign elites, including Edward IV of England, James IV of Scotland and Eleanor of Viseu.
There was considerable overlap between panel painting and illumination; van Eyck, van der Weyden, Christus and other painters designed manuscript miniatures. In addition, miniaturists would borrow motifs and ideas from panel paintings; Campin&#x27;s work was often used as a source in this way, for example in the &quot;Hours of Raoul d&#x27;Ailly&quot;. Commissions were often shared between several masters, with junior painters or specialists assisting, especially with details such as the border decorations, these last often done by women. The masters rarely signed their work, making attribution difficult; the identities of some of the more significant illuminators are lost.

Netherlandish artists found increasingly inventive ways to highlight and differentiate their work from manuscripts from surrounding countries; such techniques included designing elaborate page borders and devising ways to relate scale and space. They explored the interplay between the three essential components of a manuscript: border, miniature and text. An example is the Nassau book of hours (c. 1467–80) by the Vienna Master of Mary of Burgundy, in which the borders are decorated with large illusionistic flowers and insects. These elements achieved their effect by being broadly painted, as if scattered across the gilded surface of the miniatures. This technique was continued by, among others, the Flemish Master of James IV of Scotland (possibly Gerard Horenbout), known for his innovative page layout. Using various illusionistic elements, he often blurred the line between the miniature and its border, frequently using both in his efforts to advance the narrative of his scenes.

During the early 19th century, the collection of 15th- and 16th-century Netherlandish cut-out, as miniatures or parts for albums, became fashionable amongst connoisseurs such as William Young Ottley, leading to the destruction of many manuscripts. Originals were highly sought after, a revival that helped the rediscovery of Netherlandish art in the later part of the century.

===Tapestry===
During the mid-15th century, tapestry was one of the most expensive and prized artistic products in Europe. Commercial production proliferated across the Netherlands and northern France from the early 15th century, especially in the cities of Arras, Bruges and Tournai. The perceived technical ability of these artisans was such that, in 1517, Pope Leo X sent Raphael&#x27;s cartoons to Brussels to be woven into hangings. Such woven wall hangings played a central political role as diplomatic gifts, especially in their larger format; Philip the Good gifted several to participants at the Congress of Arras in 1435, where the halls were draped from top to bottom and all around (&quot;tout autour&quot;) with tapestries showing scenes of the &quot;Battle and Overthrow of People of Liege&quot;. At Charles the Bold and Margaret of York&#x27;s wedding the room &quot;was hung above with draperies of wool, blue and white, and on the sides was tapestried with a rich tapestry woven with the history of Jason and the Golden Fleece&quot;. Rooms typically were hung from ceiling to floor with tapestries and some rooms named for a set of tapestries, such as a chamber Philip the Bold named for a set of white tapestries with scenes from &quot;The Romance of the Rose&quot;. For about two centuries during the Burgundian period, master weavers produced &quot;innumerable series of hangings heavy with gold and silver thread, the like of which the world had never seen&quot;.

The practical use of textiles results from their portability; tapestries provided easily assembled interior decorations suited to religious or civic ceremonies. Their value is reflected in their positioning in contemporary inventories, in which they are typically found at the top of the record, then ranked in accordance with their material or colouring. White and gold were considered of the highest quality. Charles V of France had 57 tapestries, of which 16 were white. Jean de Berry owned 19, while Mary of Burgundy, Isabella of Valois, Isabeau of Bavaria and Philip the Good all held substantial collections.

Tapestry production began with design. The designs, or cartoons were typically executed on paper or parchment, put together by qualified painters, then sent to weavers, often across a great distance. Because cartoons could be re-used, craftsmen often worked on source material that was decades old. As both paper and parchment are highly perishable, few of the original cartoons survive. Once a design was agreed upon its production might be farmed out among many weavers. Looms were active in all the major Flemish cities, in most of the towns and in many of the villages.
Looms were not controlled by the guilds. Dependent on a migrant workforce, their commercial activity was driven by entrepreneurs, who were usually painters. The entrepreneur would locate and commission patrons, hold a stock of cartoons and provide raw materials such as wool, silk, and sometimes gold and silver – which often had to be imported. Entrepreneurs were in direct contact with the patron, and often went through the nuances of the design at both the cartoon and final stages. This examination was often a difficult business and necessitated delicate management; in 1400 Isabeau of Bavaria rejected a completed set by Colart de Laon having earlier approved the designs, to de Laon&#x27;s – and presumably his commissioner&#x27;s – considerable embarrassment.

Because tapestries were designed largely by painters, their formal conventions are closely aligned with the conventions of panel painting. This is especially true with the later generations of 16th-century painters who produced panoramas of heaven and hell. Harbison describes how the intricate, dense and overlaid detail of Bosch&#x27;s &quot;Garden of Earthly Delights&quot; resembles, &quot;in its precise symbolism ... a medieval tapestry&quot;.

===Triptychs and altarpieces===
Northern triptychs and polyptychs were popular across Europe from the late 14th century, with the peak of demand lasting until the early 16th century. During the 15th century, they were the most widely produced format of northern panel painting. Preoccupied with religious subject matter, they come in two broad types: smaller, portable private devotional works, or larger altarpieces for liturgical settings. The earliest northern examples are compound works incorporating engraving and painting, usually with two painted wings that could be folded over a carved central corpus.
Polyptychs were produced by the more accomplished masters. They provide greater scope for variation, and a greater number of possible combinations of interior and exterior panels that could be viewed at one time. That hinged works could be opened and closed served a practical purpose; on religious holidays the more prosaic and everyday outer panels were replaced by the lush interior panels. The &quot;Ghent Altarpiece&quot;, completed in 1432, had different configurations for weekdays, Sundays and church holidays.

The first generation of Netherlandish masters borrowed many customs from 13th- and 14th-century Italian altarpieces. The conventions for Italian triptychs before 1400 were quite rigid. In central panels the mid-ground was populated by members of the Holy Family; early works, especially from the Sienese or Florentine traditions, were overwhelmingly characterised by images of the enthroned Virgin set against a gilded background. The wings usually contain a variety of angels, donors and saints, but there is never direct eye contact, and only rarely a narrative connection, with the central panel&#x27;s figures.

Netherlandish painters adapted many of these conventions, but subverted them almost from the start. Van der Weyden was especially innovative, as apparent in his 1442–1445 &quot;Miraflores Altarpiece&quot; and c. 1452 &quot;Braque Triptych&quot;. In these paintings members of the Holy Family appear on the wings instead of just the central panels, while the latter is notable for the continuous landscape connecting the three inner panels. From the 1490s Hieronymus Bosch painted at least 16 triptychs, the best of which subverted existing conventions. Bosch&#x27;s work continued the move towards secularism and emphasised landscape. Bosch also unified the scenes of the inner panels.

Triptychs were commissioned by German patrons from the 1380s, with large-scale export beginning around 1400. Few of these very early examples survive, but the demand for Netherlandish altarpieces throughout Europe is evident from the many surviving examples still extant in churches across the continent. Till-Holger Borchert describes how they bestowed a &quot;prestige which, in the first half of the 15th century, only the workshops of the Burgundian Netherlands were capable of achieving&quot;. By the 1390s, Netherlandish altarpieces were produced mostly in Brussels and Bruges. The popularity of Brussels&#x27; altarpieces lasted until about 1530, when the output of the Antwerp workshops grew in favour. This was in part because they produced at a lower cost, allocating different portions of the panels among specialised workshop members, a practice Borchert describes as an early form of division of labour.

Multi-panel Netherlandish paintings fell out of favour and were considered old-fashioned as Antwerp Mannerism came to the fore in the mid-16th century. Later the iconoclasm of the Reformation deemed them offensive, and many works in the Low Countries were destroyed. Extant examples are found mostly in German churches and monasteries. As secular works grew in demand, triptychs were often broken up and sold as individual works, especially if a panel or section contained an image that could pass as a secular portrait. A panel would sometimes be cut down to only the figure, with the background over-painted so that &quot;it looked sufficiently like a genre piece to hang in a well-known collection of Dutch 17th-century paintings&quot;.

===Diptychs===
Diptychs were widely popular in northern Europe from the mid-15th to the early 16th century. They consisted of two equally sized panels joined by hinges (or, less often, a fixed frame); the panels were usually linked thematically. Hinged panels could be opened and closed like a book, allowing both an interior and exterior view, while the ability to close the wings allowed protection of the inner images. Originating from conventions in Books of Hours, diptychs typically functioned as less expensive and more portable altarpieces. Diptychs are distinct from pendants in that they are physically connected wings and not merely two paintings hung side by side. They were usually near-miniature in scale, and some emulated medieval &quot;treasury art&quot; -small pieces made of gold or ivory. The tracery seen in works such as van der Weyden&#x27;s &quot;Virgin and Child&quot; reflects ivory carving of the period. The format was adapted by van Eyck and van der Weyden on commission from members of the House of Valois-Burgundy, and refined by Hugo van der Goes, Hans Memling and later Jan van Scorel.
Netherlandish diptychs tend to illustrate only a small range of religious scenes. There are numerous depictions of the Virgin and Child, reflecting the Virgin&#x27;s contemporary popularity as a subject of devotion. The inner panels consisted mainly of donor portraits – often of husbands and their wives – alongside saints or the Virgin and Child. The donor was nearly always shown kneeling in full or half length, with hands clasped in prayer. The Virgin and Child are always positioned on the right, reflecting the Christian reverence for the right hand side as the &quot;place of honour&quot; alongside the divine.

Their development and commercial worth has been linked to a change in religious attitude during the 14th century, when a more meditative and solitary devotion – exemplified by the Devotio Moderna movement – grew in popularity. Private reflection and prayer was encouraged and the small-scale diptych fitted this purpose. It became popular among the newly emerging middle class and the more affluent monasteries across the Low Countries and northern Germany. Ainsworth says that regardless of size, whether a large altarpiece or a small diptych, Netherlandish painting is a &quot;matter of small scale and meticulous detail&quot;. The small size was meant to entice the viewer into a meditative state for personal devotion and perhaps the &quot;experience of miraculous visions&quot;.

Late 20th-century technical examination has shown significant differences in technique and style between the panels of individual diptychs. The technical inconsistencies may be the result of the workshop system, in which the more prosaic passages were often completed by assistants. A change in style between panels can be seen, according to historian John Hand, because the divine panel was usually based on general designs sold on the open market, with the donor panel added after a patron was found.

Few intact diptychs survive. As with altarpieces, the majority were later separated and sold as single &quot;genre&quot; pictures. In the workshop system some were interchangeable, and the religious works may have been paired with newly commissioned donor panels. Later many diptychs were broken apart, thus creating two saleable works from one. During the Reformation, religious scenes were often removed.
===Portraiture===
Secular portraiture was a rarity in European art before 1430. The format did not exist as a separate genre and was only found infrequently at the highest end of the market in betrothal portraits or royal family commissions. While such undertakings may have been profitable, they were considered a lower art form and the majority of surviving pre-16th-century examples are unattributed. Large numbers of single devotional panels showing saints and biblical figures were being produced, but depictions of historical, known individuals did not begin until the early 1430s. Van Eyck was the pioneer; his seminal 1432 &quot;Léal Souvenir&quot; is one of the earliest surviving examples, emblematic of the new style in its realism and acute observation of the small details of the sitter&#x27;s appearance. His &quot;Arnolfini Portrait&quot; is filled with symbolism, as is the &quot;Madonna of Chancellor Rolin&quot;, commissioned as testament to Rolin&#x27;s power, influence, and piety.

Van der Weyden developed the conventions of northern portraiture and was hugely influential on the following generations of painters. Rather than merely follow van Eyck&#x27;s meticulous attention to detail, van der Weyden created more abstract and sensual representations. He was highly sought after as a portraitist, yet there are noticeable similarities in his portraits, likely because he used and reused the same underdrawings, which met common ideals of rank and piety. These were then adapted to show the facial characteristics and expressions of the particular sitter.

Petrus Christus placed his sitter in a naturalistic setting rather than a flat and featureless background. This approach was in part a reaction against van der Weyden, who, in his emphasis on sculptural figures, utilised very shallow pictorial spaces. In his 1462 &quot;Portrait of a Man&quot;, Dieric Bouts went further by situating the man in a room complete with a window that looks out at a landscape, while in the 16th century, the full-length portrait became popular in the north. The latter format was practically unseen in earlier northern art, although it had a tradition in Italy going back centuries, most usually in fresco and illuminated manuscripts. Full-length portraits were reserved for depictions of the highest echelon of society, and were associated with princely displays of power. Of the second generation of northern painters, Hans Memling became the leading portraitist, taking commissions from as far as Italy. He was highly influential on later painters and is credited with inspiring Leonardo&#x27;s positioning of the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; in front of a landscape view. Van Eyck and van der Weyden similarly influenced the French artist Jean Fouquet and the Germans Hans Pleydenwurff and Martin Schongauer among others.

The Netherlandish artists moved away from the profile view – popularised during the Italian Quattrocento – towards the less formal but more engaging three-quarter view. At this angle, more than one side of the face is visible as the sitter&#x27;s body is rotated towards the viewer. This pose gives a better view of the shape and features of the head and allows the sitter to look out towards the viewer. The gaze of the sitter rarely engages the viewer. Van Eyck&#x27;s 1433 &quot;Portrait of a Man&quot; is an early example, which shows the artist himself looking at the viewer. Although there is often direct eye contact between subject and viewer, the look is normally detached, aloof and uncommunicative, perhaps to reflect the subject&#x27;s high social position. There are exceptions, typically in bridal portraits or in the case of potential betrothals, when the object of the work is to make the sitter as attractive as possible. In these cases the sitter was often shown smiling, with an engaging and radiant expression designed to appeal to her intended.

Around 1508, Albrecht Dürer described the function of portraiture as &quot;preserving a person&#x27;s appearance after his death&quot;. Portraits were objects of status, and served to ensure that the individual&#x27;s personal success was recorded and would endure beyond his lifetime. Most portraits tended to show royalty, the upper nobility or princes of the church. The new affluence in the Burgundian Netherlands brought a wider variety of clientele, as members of the upper middle class could now afford to commission a portrait. As a result, more is known about the appearance and dress of the region&#x27;s people than at any time since the late Roman period. Portraits did not generally require lengthy sittings; typically a series of preparatory drawings were used to flesh out the final panel. Very few of these drawings survive, a notable exception being van Eyck&#x27;s study for his &quot;Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati&quot;.

===Landscape===

Landscape was a secondary concern to Netherlandish painters before the mid 1460s. Geographical settings were rare and when they did appear usually consisted of glimpses through open windows or arcades. They were rarely based on actual locations; the settings tended to be largely imagined, designed to suit the thematic thrust of the panel. Because most of the works were donor portraits, very often the landscapes were tame, controlled and served merely to provide a harmonious setting for the idealised interior space. In this, the northern artists lagged behind their Italian counterparts who were already placing their sitters within geographically identifiable and closely described landscapes. Some of the northern landscapes are highly detailed and notable in their own right, including van Eyck&#x27;s unsentimental c. 1430 &quot;Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych&quot; and van der Weyden&#x27;s widely copied 1435–1440 &quot;Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin&quot;.

Van Eyck was almost certainly influenced by the Labours of the Months landscapes the Limbourg brothers painted for the &quot;Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry&quot;. The influence can be seen in the illuminations painted in the Turin-Milan Hours, which show rich landscapes in the tiny &quot;bas de page&quot; scenes. These, according to Pächt, should be defined as early examples of Netherlandish landscape painting. The landscape tradition in illuminated manuscripts would continue for at least the next century. Simon Bening &quot;explored new territory in the genre of landscape&quot;, seen in several of the leaves he painted for the c. 1520 &quot;Grimani Breviary&quot;.

From the late 15th century, a number of painters emphasised landscape in their works, a development led in part by the shift in preference from religious iconography to secular subjects. Second-generation Netherlandish painters applied the mid-14th-century dictum of natural representation. This was born of the rising affluence of the region&#x27;s middle class, many of whom had now travelled south and seen countryside noticeably different from their flat homeland. At the same time, the later part of the century saw the emergence of specialisation and a number of masters focused on detailing landscape, most notably Konrad Witz in the mid-15th century, and later Joachim Patinir. Most innovations in this format came from artists living in the Dutch regions of the Burgundian lands, most notably from Haarlem, Leiden and &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch. The significant artists from these areas did not slavishly reproduce the scenery before them, but in subtle ways adapted and modified their landscapes to reinforce the emphasis and meaning of the panel they were working on.

Patinir developed what is now called the world landscape genre, which is typified by biblical or historical figures within an imagined panoramic landscape, usually mountains and lowlands, water and buildings. Paintings of this type are characterised by an elevated viewpoint, with the figures dwarfed by their surroundings. The format was taken up by, among others, Gerard David and Pieter Bruegel the Elder, and became popular in Germany, especially with painters from the Danube school. Patinir&#x27;s works are relatively small and use a horizontal format; this was to become so standard for landscapes in art that it is now called &quot;landscape&quot; format in ordinary contexts, but at the time it was a considerable novelty, as the vast majority of panel paintings before 1520 were vertical in format. World landscape paintings retain many of the elements developed from the mid-15th century, but are composed, in modern cinematic terms, as a long rather than a medium shot. The human presence remained central rather than serving as mere staffage. Hieronymus Bosch adapted elements of the world landscape style, with the influence especially notable in his single-panel paintings.

The most popular subjects of this type include the Flight into Egypt and the plight of hermits such as Saints Jerome and Anthony. As well as connecting the style to the later Age of Discovery, the role of Antwerp as a booming centre both of world trade and cartography, and the wealthy town-dweller&#x27;s view of the countryside, art historians have explored the paintings as religious metaphors for the pilgrimage of life.

==Relationship to the Italian Renaissance==

The progressions in northern art developed almost simultaneously with the early Italian Renaissance. The philosophical and artistic traditions of the Mediterranean were not however part of the northern heritage, to the extent that many elements of Latin culture were actively disparaged in the north. The role of Renaissance humanism in art, for example, was less pronounced in the Low Countries than in Italy. Local religious trends had a strong influence on early northern art, as can be seen in the subject matter, composition and form of many late 13th- and early 14th-century artworks. The northern painters&#x27; doctrine was also built on elements of recent Gothic tradition, and less on the classical tradition prevalent in Italy.

While devotional paintings – especially altarpieces – remained dominant in Early Netherlandish art, secular portraiture became increasingly common in both northern and southern Europe as artists freed themselves from the prevailing idea that portraiture should be restricted to saints and other religious figures. In Italy this development was tied to the ideals of humanism.

Italian influences on Netherlandish art are first apparent in the late 15th century, when some of the painters began to travel south. This also explains why a number of later Netherlandish artists became associated with, in the words of art historian Rolf Toman, &quot;picturesque gables, bloated, barrel-shaped columns, droll cartouches, &#x27;twisted&#x27; figures, and stunningly unrealistic colours – actually employ[ing] the visual language of Mannerism&quot;. Wealthy northern merchants could afford to buy paintings from the top tier of artists. As a result, painters became increasingly aware of their status in society: they signed their works more often, painted portraits of themselves, and became well-known figures because of their artistic activities.
The northern masters were greatly admired in Italy. According to Friedländer they exercised a strong influence over 15th-century Italian artists, a view Panofsky agrees with. However, Italian painters began to move beyond Netherlandish influences by the 1460s, as they concentrated on composition with a greater emphasis on harmony of parts belonging together – &quot;that elegant harmony and grace ... which is called beauty&quot;, evident, for example, in Andrea Mantegna&#x27;s &quot;Entombment&quot;. By the early 16th century, the reputation of the northern masters was such that there was an established north–south trade in their works, although many of the paintings or objects sent south were by lesser artists and of lower quality. Innovations introduced in the north and adopted in Italy included the setting of figures in domestic interiors and the viewing of interiors from multiple vantage points, through openings such as doors or windows. Hugo van der Goes&#x27; &quot;Portinari Altarpiece&quot;, in Florence&#x27;s Uffizi, played an important role in introducing Florentine painters to trends from the north, and artists like Giovanni Bellini came under the influence of northern painters working in Italy.

Memling successfully merged the two styles, exemplified in his &quot;Virgin and Child with Two Angels&quot;. By the mid-16th-century, however, Netherlandish art was seen as crude; Michelangelo claimed it was appealing only to &quot;monks and friars&quot;. At this point northern art began to fall almost completely out of favour in Italy. By the 17th century, when Bruges had lost its prestige and position as the pre-eminent European trading city (the rivers silted and ports were forced to close), the Italians dominated European art.

==Destruction and dispersal==

===Iconoclasm===

Religious images came under close scrutiny as actually or potentially idolatrous from the start of the Protestant Reformation in the 1520s. Martin Luther accepted some imagery, but few Early Netherlandish paintings met his criteria. Andreas Karlstadt, Huldrych Zwingli and John Calvin were wholly opposed to public religious images, above all in churches, and Calvinism soon became the dominant force in Netherlandish Protestantism. From 1520, outbursts of reformist iconoclasm broke out across much of Northern Europe. These might be official and peaceable, as in England under the Tudors and the English Commonwealth, or unofficial and often violent, as in the &quot;Beeldenstorm&quot; or &quot;Iconoclastic Fury&quot; in 1566 in the Netherlands. On 19 August 1566, this wave of mob destruction reached Ghent, where Marcus van Vaernewijck chronicled the events. He wrote of the &quot;Ghent Altarpiece&quot; being &quot;taken to pieces and lifted, panel by panel, into the tower to preserve it from the rioters&quot;. Antwerp saw very thorough destruction in its churches in 1566, followed by more losses in the Spanish Sack of Antwerp in 1576, and a further period of official iconoclasm in 1581, which now included city and guild buildings, when Calvinists controlled the city council.

Many thousands of religious objects and artefacts were destroyed, including paintings, sculptures, altarpieces, stained glass, and crucifixes, and the survival rate of works by the major artists is low – even Jan van Eyck has only some 24 extant works confidently attributed to him. The number grows with later artists, but there are still anomalies; Petrus Christus is considered a major artist, but is given a smaller number of works than van Eyck. In general the later 15th-century works exported to southern Europe have a much higher survival rate.

Many of the period&#x27;s artworks were commissioned by clergy for their churches, with specifications for a physical format and pictorial content that would complement existing architectural and design schemes. An idea of how such church interiors might have looked can be seen from both van Eyck&#x27;s &quot;Madonna in the Church&quot; and van der Weyden&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. According to Nash, van der Weyden&#x27;s panel is an insightful look at the appearance of pre-Reformation churches, and the manner in which images were placed so that they resonated with other paintings or objects. Nash goes on to say that, &quot;any one would necessarily be seen in relation to other images, repeating, enlarging, or diversifying the chosen themes&quot;. Because iconoclasts targeted churches and cathedrals, important information about the display of individual works has been lost, and with it, insights about the meaning of these artworks in their own time. Many other works were lost to fires or in wars; the break-up of the Valois Burgundian state made the Low Countries the cockpit of European conflict until 1945. Van der Weyden&#x27;s &quot;The Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald&quot; polyptych is perhaps the most significant loss; from records it appears to have been comparable in scale and ambition to the &quot;Ghent Altarpiece&quot;. It was destroyed by French artillery during the bombardment of Brussels in 1695, and is today known only from a tapestry copy.

===Documentation===
There have been significant challenges for art historians in establishing the names of Netherlandish masters and attributing specific works. The historical record is very poor, such that some major artists&#x27; biographies are still bare outlines, while attribution is an ongoing and often contentious debate. Even the most widely accepted attributions are typically only as a result of decades of scientific and historical research originating from after the start of the 20th century. Some painters, such as Adriaen Isenbrandt and Ambrosius Benson of Bruges, who were mass-producing panels to be sold at fair stalls, have had as many as 500 painting attributed to them.

The avenues for research have been limited by many historical factors. Many archives were destroyed in bombing campaigns in the two world wars, and a great number of works for which records do exist are themselves lost or destroyed. The record-keeping in the region was inconsistent, and often the export of works by major artists was, owing to the pressures of commercial demand, not adequately recorded. The practice of signing and dating works was rare until the 1420s, and while the inventories of collectors may have elaborately described the works, they attached little importance to recording the artist or workshop that produced them. Surviving documentation tends to come from inventories, wills, payment accounts, employment contracts and guild records and regulations.

Because Jan van Eyck&#x27;s life is well documented in comparison to his contemporary painters, and because he was so clearly the period&#x27;s innovator, a great number of works were attributed to him after art historians began to research the period. Today Jan is credited with about 26–28 extant works. This reduced number in part follows from the identification of other mid-15th-century painters such as van der Weyden, Christus and Memling, while Hubert, so highly regarded by late-19th-century critics, is now relegated as a secondary figure with no works definitively attributed to him. Many early Netherlandish masters have not been identified, and are today known by &quot;names of convenience&quot;, usually of the &quot;Master of ...&quot; format. The practice lacks an established descriptor in English, but the &quot;notname&quot; term is often used, a derivative of a German term. Collecting a group of works under one notname is often contentious; a set of works assigned one notname could have been produced by various artists whose artistic similarities can be explained by shared geography, training, and response to market-demand influences. Some major artists who were known by pseudonyms are now identified, sometimes controversially, as in the case of Campin, who is usually, but not always, associated with the Master of Flémalle.

Many unidentified late-14th- and early-15th-century northern artists were of the first rank, but have suffered academic neglect because they have not been attached to any historical person; as Nash puts it, &quot;much of what cannot be firmly attributed remains less studied&quot;. Some art historians believe that this situation has fostered a lack of caution in connecting works with historical persons, and that such connections often rest on tenuous circumstantial evidence. The identities of a number of well-known artists have been founded on the basis of a single signed, documented or otherwise attributed work, from which follow further attributions based on technical evidence and geographical proximity. The so-called Master of the Legend of the Magdalen, who may have been Pieter van Coninxloo, is one of the more notable examples; others include Hugo van der Goes, Campin, Stefan Lochner and Simon Marmion.

The lack of surviving theoretical writing on art and recorded opinion from any of the pre-16th-century major artists presents still more difficulties in attribution. Dürer, in 1512, was the first artist of the era to properly set down in writing his theories of art, followed by Lucas de Heere in 1565 and Karel van Mander in 1604. Nash believes a more probable explanation for the absence of theoretical writing on art outside Italy is that the northern artists did not yet have the language to describe their aesthetic values, or saw no point in explaining in writing what they had achieved in painting. Surviving 15th-century appreciations of contemporary Netherlandish art are exclusively written by Italians, the best known of which include Cyriacus Ancona in 1449, Bartolomeo Facio in 1456, and Giovanni Santi in 1482.

==Rediscovery==
The dominance of Northern Mannerism in the mid-16th century was built on a subversion of the conventions of Early Netherlandish art, which in turn fell out of public favour. Yet it remained popular in some royal art collections; Mary of Hungary and Philip II of Spain both sought out Netherlandish painters, sharing a preference for van der Weyden and Bosch. By the early 17th century, no collection of repute was complete without 15th- and 16th-century northern European works; the emphasis however tended to be on the Northern Renaissance as a whole, more towards the German Albrecht Dürer, by far the most collectable northern artist of the era. Giorgio Vasari in 1550 and Karel van Mander (c. 1604) placed the art works of era at the heart of Northern Renaissance art. Both writers were instrumental in forming later opinion about the region&#x27;s painters, with emphasis on van Eyck as the innovator.

The Netherlandish painters were largely forgotten in the 18th century. When Musée du Louvre was converted to an art gallery during the French Revolution, Gerard David&#x27;s &quot;Marriage at Cana&quot; – then attributed to van Eyck – was the only piece of Netherlandish art on display there. More large panels were added to the collection after the French conquered the Low Countries. These works had a profound effect on German literary critic and philosopher Karl Schlegel, who after a visit in 1803 wrote an analysis of Netherlandish art, sending it to Ludwig Tieck, who had the piece published in 1805.

In 1821 Johanna Schopenhauer became interested in the work of Jan van Eyck and his followers, having seen early Netherlandish and Flemish paintings in the collection of the brothers Sulpiz and Melchior Boisserée in Heidelberg. Schopenhauer did primary archival research because there was very little historical record of the masters, apart from official legal documents. She published &quot;Johann van Eyck und seine Nachfolger&quot; in 1822, the same year Gustav Friedrich Waagen published the first modern scholarly work on early Netherlandish painting, &quot;Ueber Hubert van Eyck und Johann van Eyck&quot;; Waagen&#x27;s work drew on Schlegel and Schopenhauer&#x27;s earlier analyses. Waagen went on to become director of the Gemäldegalerie in Berlin, amassing a collection of Netherlandish art, including most of the &quot;Ghent&quot; panels, a number of van der Weyden triptychs, and a Bouts altarpiece. Subjecting the works to meticulous analysis and examination in the course of acquisition, based on distinguishing characteristics of individual artists, he established an early scholarly system of classification.

In 1830 the Belgian Revolution split Belgium from the Netherlands of today; as the newly created state sought to establish a cultural identity, Memling&#x27;s reputation came to equal that of van Eyck in the 19th century. Memling was seen as the older master&#x27;s match technically, and as possessing a deeper emotional resonance. When in 1848 the collection of Prince Ludwig of Oettingen-Wallerstein at Schloss Wallerstein was forced onto the market, his cousin Prince Albert arranged a viewing at Kensington Palace; though a catalogue of works attributed to the School of Cologne, Jan van Eyck and van der Weyden was compiled by Waagen, there were no other buyers so Albert purchased them himself. At a period when London&#x27;s National Gallery sought to increase its prestige, Charles Eastlake purchased Rogier van der Weyden&#x27;s &quot;The Magdalen Reading&quot; panel in 1860 from Edmond Beaucousin&#x27;s &quot;small but choice&quot; collection of early Netherlandish paintings.

Netherlandish art became popular with museum-goers in the late 19th century. At the beginning of the 20th century, van Eyck and Memling were the most highly regarded, with van der Weyden and Christus little more than footnotes. Later many of the works then attributed to Memling were found to be from van der Weyden or his workshop. In 1902, Bruges hosted the first exhibition of Netherlandish art with 35,000 visitors, an event that was a &quot;turning point in the appreciation of early Netherlandish art&quot;. For a number of reasons, the chief of which was the difficulty of securing paintings for the exhibition, only a few of van Eyck&#x27;s and van der Weyden&#x27;s panels were displayed, while almost 40 of Memling&#x27;s pieces were shown. Nevertheless, van Eyck and van der Weyden, to an extent, were then considered the first rank of Netherlandish artists.

The Bruges exhibition renewed interest in the period and initiated scholarship that was to flourish in the 20th century. Johan Huizinga was the first historian to place Netherlandish art squarely in the Burgundian period – outside of nationalistic borders – suggesting in his book &quot;The Waning of the Middle Ages&quot;, published in 1919, that the flowering of the school in the early 15th century resulted wholly from the tastes set by the Burgundian court. Another exhibition visitor, Georges Hulin de Loo, published an independent critical catalogue highlighting the large number of mistakes in the official catalogue, which had used attributions and descriptions from the owners. He and Max Friedländer, who visited and wrote a review of the Bruges exhibition, went on to become leading scholars in the field.

==Scholarship and conservation==

The most significant early research of Early Netherlandish art occurred in the 1920s, in German art historian Max Jakob Friedländer&#x27;s pioneering &quot;Meisterwerke der Niederländischen Malerei des 15. und 16. Jahrhunderts&quot;. Friedländer focused on the biographical details of the painters, establishing attribution, and examining their major works. The undertaking proved extremely difficult, given the scant historical record of even the most significant artists. Fellow-German Erwin Panofsky&#x27;s analysis in the 1950s and 1960s followed and in many ways challenged Friedländer&#x27;s work. Writing in the United States, Panofsky made the work of the German art historians accessible to the English-speaking world for the first time. He effectively legitimized Netherlandish art as a field of study, and raised its status to something similar to the early Italian renaissance.
Panofsky was one of the first art historians to abandon formalism. He built on Friedländer&#x27;s attempts at attribution, but focused more on social history and religious iconography. Panofsky developed the terminology with which the Netherlandish paintings are usually described, and made significant advances identifying the rich religious symbolism especially of the major altarpieces. Panofsky was the first scholar to connect the work of Netherlandish painters and illuminators, noticing the considerable overlap. He considered the study of manuscripts to be integral to the study of panels, though in the end came to view illumination as less significant than panel painting – as a prelude to the truly significant work of the northern artists of the 15th and 16th centuries.

Otto Pächt and Friedrich Winkler continued and developed on Panofsky&#x27;s work. They were key in identifying sources of iconography and ascribing attribution, or at least differentiating anonymous masters under names of convenience. The paucity of surviving documentation has made attribution especially difficult, a problem compounded by the workshop system. It was not until the late 1950s, after the research of Friedländer, Panofsky and Meyer Schapiro, that the attributions generally accepted today were established.
More recent research from art historians such as Lorne Campbell relies on X-ray and infrared photography to develop an understanding of the techniques and materials used by the painters. The conservation of the &quot;Ghent Altarpiece&quot; in the mid-1950s pioneered methodologies and scholarship in technical studies. Examination of paint layers and underlayers was later applied to other Netherlandish works, allowing for more accurate attributions. Van Eyck&#x27;s work, for example, typically shows underdrawings unlike Christus&#x27; work. These discoveries, too, hint at the relationships between the masters of the first rank and those in the following generations, with Memling&#x27;s underdrawings clearly showing van der Weyden&#x27;s influence.

Scholarship since the 1970s has tended to move away from a pure study of iconography, instead emphasizing the paintings&#x27; and artists&#x27; relation to the social history of their time. According to Craig Harbison, &quot;Social history was becoming increasingly important. Panofsky had never really talked about what kind of people these were.&quot; Harbison sees the works as objects of devotion with a &quot;prayer book mentality&quot; available to middle-class burghers who had the means and the inclination to commission devotional objects. Most recent scholarship is moving away from the focus on religious iconography; instead, it investigates how a viewer is meant to experience a piece, as with donor paintings that were meant to elicit the feeling of a religious vision. James Marrow thinks the painters wanted to evoke specific responses, which are often hinted at by the figures&#x27; emotions in the paintings.

<doc id="799882" wikidata="Q1935866" url="?curid=799882" title="Schüfftan process">
<text>The Schüfftan process is a special effect in filmmaking named after its inventor, German cinematographer Eugen Schüfftan (1893–1977). The technique consists of covering part of the camera&#x27;s view with a mirror, allowing filmmakers to assemble an image from multiple parts. It was widely used in the first half of the 20th century.

First popularized in the 1927 film &quot;Metropolis&quot;, this technique involved positioning a plate of glass at a 45-degree angle between the camera and the miniatures, outlining the area where actors would be inserted, and transferring this outline to a mirror. The process is similar to &quot;Pepper&#x27;s ghost&quot;, a 19th century stage technique. Despite its use in numerous films, including works by Alfred Hitchcock and Peter Jackson, the Schüfftan process has largely been replaced by matte shots and chroma key.

==Application==
The process was refined and popularized by the German cinematographer Eugen Schüfftan while he was working on the film &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927), although there is evidence that other film-makers were using similar techniques earlier than this. The film&#x27;s director, Fritz Lang, wanted to insert the actors into shots of miniatures of skyscrapers and other buildings, so Schüfftan used a specially made mirror to create the illusion of actors interacting with huge, realistic-looking sets.

Schüfftan placed a plate of glass at a 45-degree angle between the camera and the miniature buildings. He used the camera&#x27;s viewfinder to trace an outline of the area into which the actors would later be inserted onto the glass. This outline was transferred onto a mirror and all the reflective surface that fell outside the outline was removed, leaving transparent glass. When the mirror was placed in the same position as the original plate of glass, the reflective part blocked a portion of the miniature building behind it and also reflected the stage behind the camera. The actors were placed several meters away from the mirror so that when they were reflected in the mirror, they would appear at the right size.
In the same film, Schüfftan used a variation of this process so that the miniature set (or drawing) was shown on the reflective part of the mirror and the actors were filmed through the transparent part.

Over the following years, the Schüfftan process was used by many other film-makers, including Alfred Hitchcock, in his films &quot;Blackmail&quot; (1929) and &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; (1935), and as recently as &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; (2003), directed by Peter Jackson. The Schüfftan process has largely been replaced with matte shots, which allow the two portions of the image to be filmed at different times and give opportunities for more changes in post production.

The Schüfftan process&#x27;s use of mirrors is very similar to the 19th century stage technique known as Pepper&#x27;s ghost.

<doc id="799888" wikidata="Q1776302" url="?curid=799888" title="Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball">
<text>is a 2003 beach volleyball video game developed by Team Ninja and published by Tecmo for the Xbox. It is a spin-off of the &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; series which otherwise consisted of fighting games. It also marked the first game in the series to have a Mature rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board due to nudity.

The game is set immediately after the tournament in &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; ended. Gameplay revolves around the women of the &quot;DOA&quot; series playing various mini-games in the many locations of Zack Island, a reclusive private resort on an island owned by Zack, the only male character from the series to appear anywhere in the game. This installment features no fighting engine, instead being much like a simulation game that encourages the player to establish relationships with the AI of characters, and eventually make a two-person team to compete in volleyball competitions. Currency earned from completing mini-games and gambling in the island&#x27;s casino allows the player to purchase hundreds of different swimsuits to wear in the game.

Its sequel, &quot;Dead or Alive Xtreme 2&quot;, was released on November 13, 2006, exclusively for the Xbox 360. The next sequel, &quot;Dead or Alive Xtreme 3&quot;, was released on March 24, 2016, in Asian countries.

== Gameplay ==
In the main story mode, players select a woman to play as for the duration of their two-week period. Since the volleyball matches in the game are always two on two, the player automatically begins with a partner. Each day, players can select one activity in the morning, one in the afternoon, and one in the evening. While players do have an opportunity to simply relax during these time periods, they are generally used to either court new partners, or to challenge existing partnerships to a game of volleyball. Winning a match provides money which can be used to buy swimsuits and accessories, either for oneself, or as gifts to bestow upon the other women. Alternatively, players can also earn money through gambling at a casino located on the island.

Playing volleyball is done primarily through the use of two buttons, one designated for spiking and blocking, and the other for receiving or setting. As many of the actions happen automatically (e.g., jumping up to spike the ball), the game forces the player to focus on timing; a poorly timed press of a button results in a weak hit or a smash into the net. While it is possible to manually direct one&#x27;s partner towards or away from the net, she will generally move to cover whichever area the player has left empty. The game is one of the few to make use of the analog sensitivity of the face buttons on the Xbox controller, with a softer touch allowing one to barely hit the ball over the net.

In addition to the core volleyball mechanic, the game features a relationship system between the various women on the island. Through gifts and skillful play, players can induce other characters to increase their esteem and positive feelings toward the character being played. A positive relationship with one&#x27;s partner can translate into better performance during a volleyball match, while strong relationships with the other women leads to opportunities for new partners. Conversely, negative feelings from a partner can lead to missteps on the court, or can lead to gifts being thrown away unopened.

All money carries over between vacations, so that unspent &quot;Zack bucks&quot; can be used by a different character selected on the next play-through. Similarly, all swimsuits acquired by a given character remain with that character for all future play sessions. Since each character has access to a different set of swimsuits at the shop, the majority of suits for each character can only be acquired as gifts. Many of the costumes are very revealing and make the women appear almost nude in some instances. This, coupled with the suggestive poses the women present themselves in (which can be viewed and zoomed in on from almost any angle, as controlled by the player) led to the first Mature rating in the series&#x27; history.

While the game is entirely played with Japanese voiceovers, the story&#x27;s CG cutscenes are played with English and Japanese voiceovers.

== Characters ==
There are eight playable characters, seven from previous &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; titles plus Lisa, who makes her debut in this title. Zack (voiced by Bin Shimada / Dennis Rodman) is not a playable character but appears in the game&#x27;s beginning and ending cinematics, with small appearances throughout the game. His girlfriend, Niki (voiced by Yuka Koyama / Kari Wahlgren), appears only in cutscenes. As such, the volleyball players consist of:

* Ayane – Japanese ninja and rival (as well as half-sister) of Kasumi. (voiced by Wakana Yamazaki)
* Christie – British assassin and automobile enthusiast. (voiced by Kotono Mitsuishi)
* Helena – French opera singer fond of walking her dog. (voiced by Yuka Koyama)
* Hitomi – German/Japanese high-school student and aspiring chef. (voiced by Yui Horie)
* Kasumi – Japanese runaway ninja who enjoys fortune-telling and origami. (voiced by Houko Kuwashima)
* Leifang – Chinese college student with an interest in aromatherapy. (voiced by Yumi Tōma)
* Lisa – American stock broker and amateur surfer. (voiced by Maaya Sakamoto)
* Tina – American wrestler and daughter of Bass Armstrong. (voiced by Yūko Nagashima)

Each of the playable characters has her own likes and dislikes (documented in the game manual), which influence how likely she is to accept or be impressed by certain gifts. Favorable gifts include those based on her favorite food, favorite color, and hobbies. In order to suit the lighter, more playful nature of the game, the &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; characters&#x27; previous rivalries were reduced to just a general dislike in this title. As a result, even characters who would normally try to kill another (such as Ayane and Kasumi, or Christie and Helena) can become fast friends through a brief exchange of gifts.

==Plot==
Zack gambles his winnings from the &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; tournament at a casino. In the process, he hits the jackpot, earning a ridiculously large sum of money. The money is used to purchase a private island, which he promptly turns into a resort named after himself (&quot;Zack Island&quot;). He then invites the women from the previous tournament (along with one newcomer — his girlfriend, Niki) to his island under the pretense that the next Dead or Alive tournament will be held there. The women arrive but soon discover it was all a hoax. They decide to make the best of the situation by spending two weeks vacationing on the island.

At the end of the two-week time period, the ladies depart, leaving only Zack and Niki on the island. Shortly thereafter, a volcano, previously thought to be inactive, spontaneously erupts, threatening to destroy Zack&#x27;s island. In the chaos, Niki escapes using Zack&#x27;s jetpack. Zack survives the volcanic eruption, but the island itself is completely destroyed. While not part of the game itself, Zack&#x27;s later &quot;Dead or Alive 4&quot; ending shows the pair robbing an ancient tomb and escaping with a truck filled with gold, suggesting a possible financing source for a sequel. In the sequel, it is confirmed that this is indeed the source for financing &quot;New Zack Island&quot;.

==Development==
During &quot;Dead or Alive 2&#x27;s&quot; development, the fan base requested Team Ninja to add a beach volleyball mini game as other fighting games such as &quot;Street Fighter&quot; and &quot;Tekken&quot;, had similar mini games. After &quot;Dead or Alive 3&#x27;s&quot; release, the staff later decided to create the beach volleyball game as a standalone game. Tomonobu Itagaki cited that spending time on a beach resort was one of his main inspirations for the game and also cited &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot; as another inspiration. He wanted to make a game that was special for the fans, and as a result, the game was designed exclusively for fans of the series, knowing that it wouldn&#x27;t be understood by others who viewed making things for fans as negative. Itagaki rebuked that idea and fervently expressed that there wasn&#x27;t anything wrong with that type of practice.

Making a traditional sports game was also a big point of contention since the fixed camera was how they made fighting games and the overall goal was to create a game that was easy to play and had cool movements. Only the female cast of the series are playable characters and development for the game was scheduled after &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; due the amount of work required to develop it and the small amount of female characters in the series since having less than 8 playable characters was considered boring to have in a game.

==Soundtrack==
== Reception ==
Reviewers were mostly positive, especially to the depth of the volleyball game, as well as with the high quality of the visuals and animation. Review scores ranged from poor to very high, resulting in the averaged ratings of 74% at GameRankings and 73/100 at Metacritic.

In its review, &quot;Edge&quot; focused on the game&#x27;s unusual social, rather than adversarial, focus. &quot;Maxim&quot; gave the game a score of eight out of ten and stated that &quot;The sharp graphics and advanced jiggle physics will no doubt prick the interest of lonely gamers, but surprisingly, the game&#x27;s volleyball action is pretty solid. And that&#x27;s the most important thing... right?&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a B and said, &quot;It&#x27;s kinda difficult not to get caught up in this goofy title, as you use your v-ball winnings to buy shoes and skimpy clothes for your fellow beach bunnies.&quot; &quot;Playboy&quot; gave it a score of 74% and said, &quot;As long as you know what you&#x27;re in for, &quot;DOA: Xtreme Beach Volleyball&quot; can be a mildly entertaining collection of digital diversions with, at the very least, the best-looking virtual women to grace a video game.&quot;

At the first Spike Video Game Awards in 2003, &quot;Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball&quot; won in the category Best Animation. In 2006, GamesRadar ranked gravure scenes in the game to be one of the 100 greatest gaming moment in history. Conversely, &quot;Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball&quot; won the &quot;GameSpot&#x27;s Best and Worst of 2003&quot; in &quot;Dubious Honors&quot; category for Most Embarrassing Game.

In Japan, the game sold over 122,000 copies during its release week including 73,000 copies on its launch day. By the end of the year it had sold over 127,000 units in the region according to Media Create sales data.

==Lawsuit==
In January 2005, Tecmo sued Ninjahacker.net, a hobbyist game modding site dedicated to user-created modifications to the game and other Tecmo games. The site included custom skins that made the game&#x27;s characters fully nude. Tecmo alleged that the site breached the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and other laws, and sought between $1,000 and $100,000 for every skin swapped on the site. Tecmo said the lawsuit was necessary to &quot;uphold the integrity of our work&quot;, while a lawyer for the non-profit Electronic Frontier Foundation said the suit was &quot;absurd&quot; and that the site&#x27;s offerings were &quot;completely legal&quot;. Ultimately, the site was shut down and the defendants reached an undisclosed settlement with Tecmo.

<text>Yunmen Wenyan (; romaji: &quot;Ummon Bun&#x27;en&quot;; 862 or 864 – 949 CE), was a major Chinese Chan master of the Tang dynasty. He was a dharma-heir of Xuefeng Yicun.

Yunmen founded the Yunmen school, one of the five major schools of Chán (Chinese Zen). The name is derived from &quot;Yunmen&quot; monastery of Shaozhou where Yunmen was abbot. The Yunmen school flourished into the early Song Dynasty, with particular influence on the upper classes, and eventually culminating in the compilation and writing of the &quot;Blue Cliff Record&quot;.

The school would eventually be absorbed by the Linji school later in the Song. The lineage still lives on to this day through Chan Master Hsu Yun (1840–1959).

==Biography==

===Early years===
Yunmen was born in the town of Jiaxing near Suzhou and southwest of Shanghai to the Zhang family, apparently in 864 CE. His birth year is uncertain. The two memorial stele at the Yunmen monastery states he was 86 years old when he died in 949 CE, which suggests that he was born in 864 CE.

===Initial Zen-studies===
While a boy, Yunmen became a monk under a &quot;Commandment master&quot; named Zhicheng in Jiaxing. He studied there for several years, taking his monastic vows at age 20, in 883 CE.

The teachings there did not satisfy him, and he went to the school of Reverend Muzhou Daoming (Chinese: 睦州道明; Pinyin: &quot;Mùzhōu Dàomíng&quot;), also known as Muzhou Daozong (Chinese: 睦州道蹤; Pinyin: &quot;Mùzhōu Dàozōng&quot;) to gain enlightenment. According to legend, first mentioned in 1100, he had his leg broken for his trouble:

Daoming told Yunmen to visit the pre-eminent Chan master of the day, Xuefeng Yicun of Mount Xianggu, in Fuzhou in modern-day Fujian Province, and become his disciple, as Daoming was by then too old (~100 years old) to further teach Yunmen. After a few years studying with him, Yunmen did so, and received enlightenment after several years.

===Advanced Zen-studies===
While Yunmen had received his teacher&#x27;s seal of approval, he nevertheless did not become abbot, probably because he had only stayed there for 4 or 5 years. When Xuefeng Yicun died, Yunmen began travelling and visited quite a number of monasteries, cementing his reputation as a Chan master.

During a subsequent visit to the tomb of the Sixth Patriarch in Guangdong, Yunmen eventually joined (c. 911 CE) the monastery of Rumin Chanshi/Ling-shu Ju-min, who died in 918 CE. They became great friends. With his death, Yunmen became head priest of the Lingshu monastery on Mount Lingshu.

In this Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, the Tang dynasty was greatly weakened, and entire sections of the empire had broken away. The South was peaceful and developed, but the &quot;North was torn by the ravages of war&quot;. The area of Southern China where Yunmen lived broke free during the rebellion of Huang Chao, a viceroy of the Liu family. Eventually, the Liu family became the rulers of the Southern Han (918–978) kingdom during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. The ruler, Liu Yan, visited the monastery for Rumin&#x27;s cremation (as Liu often sought Rumin&#x27;s advice), and met Yunmen.

===Abbot of Yunmen monastery===
Impressed, Liu Yan extended him his patronage and protection, as well as confirming his appointment as the new abbot of the Lingshu monastery. But Yunmen&#x27;s fame drew a great flow of visitors from all over China and even from Korea. All these visitors proved too distracting for Yunmen&#x27;s taste, and in 923, he asked the king to aid him in building a new monastery on Mount Yunmen. The king acquiesced, and five years later, at the age of 64, Yunmen began living in and teaching in the monastery on the mountain from which he took the name by which he is best known.

While the king and some of Yunmen&#x27;s disciples continued to try to give Yunmen more responsibilities and honors, Yunmen refused, and returned to his monastery.

===Farewell===
One day, when Yunmen was 85 or 86, he composed a farewell letter to his patron, the new king of the Southern Han, and gave a final lecture to his monks, finishing with the statement:
Yunmen then sat in a full lotus posture and died. He would be buried with great honors, and his well-preserved corpse was exhumed several years later, and given a procession. In honor of this, his monastery was given a new name, and two stele erected, which recorded his biography. His corpse would be venerated until the 20th century, when it would disappear during the chaos of the Cultural Revolution.

Yunmen was succeeded as abbot by Dongshan Shouchu (Chinese: 洞山守初; Pinyin: &quot;Dòngshān Shǒuchū&quot;; Rōmaji: &quot;Tōzan Shusho&quot;; d. 900). His foremost disciple was accounted Baiyun Zixiang (Chinese: 白云子祥; Pinyin: &quot;Báiyún Zixiáng&quot;), who had founded his own temple on the nearby Mount Baiyun.

==Teachings==
Yunmen was renowned for his forceful and direct yet subtle teaching, often expressed through sudden shouts and blows with a staff, and for his wisdom and skill at oratory:
Yet, his teachings are also described as &quot;difficult to understand&quot;. According to Gyomay Kubose: &quot;Yunmen&#x27;s school is deep and difficult to understand since its mode of expression is indirect; while it talks about the south, it is looking at the north.&quot;

===One Word Barriers===
Yunmen is known for apparently meaningless short sharp single word answers, like &quot;Guan!&quot; (literally, &quot;barrier&quot; or &quot;frontier pass&quot;) – these were called &quot;Yunmen&#x27;s One Word Barriers&quot;. These one-word barriers
===Koans===
An apocryphal anecdote that began circulating around the beginning of the 12th century has Yunmen going so far as to forbid any of his sayings or teachings from being recorded by his many pupils:
Despite this, Yunmen is one of the greatest sources of &quot;live words&quot;, &quot;old cases&quot;, and paradoxical statements that would later evolve into the koan tradition, along with Zhaozhou (Japanese: &quot;Jōshū Jūshin&quot;). Most were collected in the &quot;Yúnmén kuāngzhēn chánshī guǎnglù&quot; (雲門匡眞禪師廣錄).

Eighteen koans in the &quot;Blue Cliff Record&quot; involve Yunmen:
:A monk asked Yunmen (Ummon), &quot;What is the teaching that transcends the Buddha and patriarchs?&quot;
::Yunmen (Ummon) said, &quot;A sesame bun.&quot;
::(From the &quot;Blue Cliff Record&quot;, case no. 77)
Eight of Yunmen&#x27;s sayings are included in &quot;Book of Equanimity&quot;, and five in &quot;The Gateless Gate&quot;:
:A monk asked Yunmen, &quot;What is Buddha?&quot;
::Yunmen said, &quot;Dried shitstick.&quot;
::(From case no. 21, &quot;The Gateless Gate)&quot;

Eighteen other koans were later discovered when a subsequent master of the Yunmen school, Xuedou Chongxian (Setchō Jūken, 980–1052 CE), published his &quot;Boze songgu&quot;, which contained one hundred &quot;old cases&quot; popular in his teaching line, in which the eighteen Yunmen koans were included. Further examples can be found in the &quot;Jen-t&#x27;ien Yen-mu&quot;, and the &quot;Yün-men Lu&quot;.

While his short ones were popular, some of his longer ones were iconic and among the most famous koans:
==Lineage==

His disciples reputedly numbered 790, an unusual number of whom became enlightened. The Yunmen School flourished as one of the &quot;Five Schools&quot; for about 300 years, after which it was absorbed into the Linji school towards the end of the Southern Song dynasty (~1127 CE).

The lineage still lives on to this day through Chan Master Hsu Yun (1840–1959). He rebuilt the Yunmen Temple as well as Huineng&#x27;s temple, Nanhua Temple. The Yunmen school continues through Master Hsu Yun, Fo Yuan, and Master Ming Zhao Shakya, who have disciples in America and abroad.

==Legacy==
Despite being a popular place for pilgrimages, the legendary Mount Wutai in Shanxi was ordered off-limits by Yunmen and his dharmic descendent, Linji Yixuan. When the legendary monk Ikkyū was studying under Kaso, he was assigned kōan no. 15 from the &quot;Gateless Gate&quot; where Yunmen/Ummon rebukes Tozan for wandering from one monastery to another; after being reprimanded, Tozan experiences enlightenment. When Ikkyū &#x27;penetrated&#x27; into understanding this kōan, he was rewarded his dharma name.

The Rinzai master Shuho Myocho experienced great enlightenment after contemplating a Yunmen kōan for ten days. After the moment of enlightenment, his master Nanpo Shomyo told him: &quot;Yesterday I dreamed that the great Ummon (Yunmen) personally came to my room. Today, it is you - the second Ummon.&quot;

By its preservation in the &quot;Blue Cliff Record&quot;, Yunmen&#x27;s famous saying &quot;Nichinichi kore kōnichi&quot; (&quot;Every day is a good day&quot;) became a useful phrase for later Zen teachers, including Kōdō Sawaki and his student Taisen Deshimaru. The avant-garde composer John Cage featured the saying in his &quot;Song Books&quot; as &quot;Solo for Voice 64&quot;, specifically as a repetition of &quot;“kichi kichi kiri ko nichi”&quot;.

The &quot;shit stick&quot; kōan of Yunmen (case no. 21, &quot;The Gateless Gate&quot;) became renowned for its incomprehensibility. American Zen teacher Robert Baker Aitken explained that the term was used as &quot;a soft stick that was used the way our ancestors used a corncob in their outhouses&quot; Jack Kerouac paraphrased the kōan in his book &quot;The Dharma Bums&quot; as &quot;The Buddha is a dried piece of turd.&quot; Wumen Huikai appended the kōan with the following verse:

Yunmen&#x27;s Japanese name, Ummon, was the namesake for a prominent character in Dan Simmons&#x27;s Hyperion Cantos science fiction series; Simmon&#x27;s Ummon was a vastly advanced AI from the &quot;TechnoCore&quot;, who reveals key plot elements to the main characters through kōans and &quot;mondo&quot; (dialogue).

<doc id="799913" wikidata="Q1986441" url="?curid=799913" title="Rod (Slavic religion)">
<text>In the pre-Christian religion of Eastern and Southern Slavs, Rod (Slovenian, Croatian Bosnian: Rod, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Russian, Serbian Cyrillic: Род, Ukrainian Cyrillic: Рід) is the god of the family, ancestors and fate. Among Southern Slavs, he is also known as Sud (&quot;(the) Judge&quot;). He is usually mentioned together with Rozhanitsy deities (among Southern Slavs, the Sudzenitsy). One&#x27;s first haircut (&quot;postriziny&quot;) was dedicated to him, in a celebration in which he and the rozhanitsy were given a meal and the cut hair. His cult lost its importance through time, and in the ninth or tenth century he was replaced by Perun, Svarog and/or Svetevid, which explains his absence in the pantheon of Vladimir the Great.

== Etymology ==
Rod&#x27;s name is confirmed in Old Church Slavonic and Old East Slavic sources about pre-Christian Slavic religion. The name is derived from the Proto-Slavic word , meaning &quot;family&quot;, &quot;birth&quot;, &quot;origin&quot;, &quot;clan&quot;, but also &quot;yield&quot;, &quot;harvest&quot;. Aleksander Brückner also notes the similarity of the name to the Avestan word &quot;rada-&quot;, meaning &quot;guardian&quot;, &quot;keeper&quot;.

== Sources ==
The first source mentioning Rod is the &quot;Word of St. Gregory the Theologian about how pagans bowed to idols&quot;, from the 11th century:

The Russian &quot;Word of a certain Christ-lover&quot;:

In a handwritten commentary on the Gospel from the 15th century, Rod defies the Christian god as the creator of humans:

The cult of Rod was still popular in 16th-century Rus, as evidenced by the penance given during confession by Orthodox priests as described in the penitentiaries of Saint Sabbas of Storozhi:

== Cult ==
According to ethnologist Halyna Lozko, Rod&#x27;s Holiday was celebrated on December 23, or according to Czech historian and archaeologist Naďa Profantová, on December 26. Rod and the rozhanitsy were offered bloodless sacrifices in the form of bread, honey, cheese and groat (kutia). Before consuming the kutia, the father of the family, who took up the role of the volkhv or zhretsa, tossed the first spoon up to the holy corner. This custom exists in Ukraine to this day. Then the feast began at a table in the shape of a trapezium. After the feast, they made requests to Rod and the rozhanitsy: &quot;let all good things be born&quot;.

In Rus, after Christianization, feasts dedicated to Rod were still practiced, as mentioned in &quot;Word of a certain Christ-lover&quot;.&quot;&quot; In the first years of the existence of Saint Sophia&#x27;s Cathedral in Kyiv, pagans came to celebrate Koliada there, which was later severely punished. The remains of the Rod cult were to survive until the 19th century.

== Interpretations ==

=== Scholars&#x27; opinions ===

==== Boris Rybakov ====
According to the concept presented by Boris Rybakov, Rod was originally the chief Slavic deity during the times of patriarchal agricultural societies in the first millennium CE, later pushed to a lower position, which would explain his absence in the pantheon of deities worshiped by Vladimir the Great. Rybakov relied on the &quot;Word of St. Gregory Theologian...&quot;, where the Slavs first sacrificed to wraiths, then to Rod and rozhanitsy, and finally to Perun, which would reflect the alleged evolution of Slavic beliefs from animism through cult of natural forces to henotheism. The sculpture known as Zbruch Idol was supposed to depict Rod as the main Slavic deity according to Rybakov&#x27;s concept.

Rybakov also believes that all the circles and spiral symbols represent the different hypostases of Rod. Such symbols are to be &quot;six-petal rose inscribed in a circle&quot; (rosette) () and the sign of the Thunderer ().

==== Leo Klejn and Mikola Zubov ====
These scholars criticized Rybakov&#x27;s findings. In one of his works, Rybakov maintained that Perun could not be borrowed by the Vainakhs, since the supreme god of the Slavs was Rod, and Perun was introduced only by Vladimir as the druzhina patron. However, this is contradicted by the traces of Perun throughout Slavic territory. These researchers argue that it is necessary to identify traces of the original sources of texts and restore them to the historical context under which specific Old Russian texts were created. They believe that Old Russian authors, when describing Rod and rozhanitsy, used ready semantic blocks borrowed from other sources, mainly the Bible and writings of Greek theologians that were misinterpreted: in Byzantine Empire the horoscope was called &quot;genealogy&quot;, which can literally be translated as &quot;rodoslovo&quot;. Therefore, these researchers believe that the cult of Rod and parents did not exist in the pre-Christian religion of the Slavs. Zubov also believes that there was no extensive genealogy of the gods in the East Slav religion and Perun was the only god.

==== Aleksander Gieysztor ====
Gieysztor considers Rod the god of social organization. After Benveniste he compares him to the Roman Quirinus, whose name comes from *&quot;covir&quot; or &quot;curia&quot;, which can be translated as &quot;god of the community of husbands&quot;, to the Umbrian Vofionus, whose name contains a root similar to the Indo-European word *&quot;leudho&quot;, Anglo-Saxon &quot;leode&quot; (&quot;people&quot;), Slavic *&quot;ludie&quot; and Polish &quot;ludzie&quot;, and to the Celtic Toutatis, whose name derives from the Celtic core *&quot;teuta&quot; meaning &quot;family&quot;, but rejects connecting Rod with Indian Rudra.

Because of the function of fertility and wealth, he identifies with him the Belarusian , a personification of abundance, fertility.

==== Andrzej Szyjewski ====
According to Andrzej Szyjewski, Rod &quot;personifies the ideas of family kinship as a symbol of spiritual continuity (rodoslovo).&quot; Rod was also to direct the souls of the dead to Vyraj, and then send them back to our world in the form of clods of earth cast down or entrusted to nightjars and storks.

==== Fyodor Kapitsa ====
According to the folklorist Fyodor Kapitsa, the cult of Rod and parents was almost completely forgotten over time. Rod transformed into a ghost – a patron of the family, a &quot;home grandfather&quot;, and later a guardian of newborns and honoring ancestors. Traces of Rod&#x27;s cult were mainly seen in everyday life. Remains of the Rod cult are to be Russian Orthodox holidays such as Day of the Dead (Holy Thursday) and Radonica (Tuesday of the first week after Easter) during which the dead are worshiped.

In the times of Kievan Rus in the 11th and 12th centuries, the cult of Rod was to be particularly important for princes because he was considered the patron of the unity of the clan, and the right to the throne and land of ancestors depended on it. Since fertility has always been associated with femininity, Rod&#x27;s cult was traditionally feminine. Thus, female priestesses were associated with the cult of Rod, who were to sacrifice him or organize special feasts several times a year. Bread, porridge, cheese and honey were prepared for the feast, then such a meal was put in the shrines. It was believed that the gods appear there invisible to the human eye. Rod was sometimes called to protect people from illness, but rozhanitsy played a major role in this ritual.

==== Oleg Kutarev ====
Kutarev notes the similarity between the cult of Rod and the cult of the South Slavic Stopan and the East Slavic Domovoy – all were given a meal, they were to manage the fate and were associated with the worship of ancestors.

==== Viljo Mansikka ====
This Russian and Finnish philologist notes that sometimes in the Slavic languages the Greek term &quot;τύχη&quot; (týchi, &quot;luck&quot;) is translated as &quot;rod&quot;, and &quot;είμαρμένη&quot; (eímarméni, &quot;destiny&quot;) is translated as a &quot;rozhanitsa&quot;.

==== Jan Máchal ====
This Czech slavist claimed that Rod was a god who represented male ancestors and rozhanitsy represented female ancestors.

==== Halyna Lozko ====
According to Halynaa Losko, for Ukrainians Rod was god over the gods. He is the giver of life and was supposed to stay in heaven, ride on clouds and assign man his fate. Rod was the personification of the descendants of one ancestor, that is, he was associated with the entire family: dead ancestors, living people and unborn generations. Over time, Rod became a Domovoy whose figurines were owned by many families. Rod&#x27;s and rozhanitsy images were also to appear on the rushnyks as motives of the tree of life. The 20th-century ethnographic finds show the door of huts with the image of a family tree: men were depicted on leaves and women on flowers of this tree. When someone was dying – a cross was drawn next to his name, when someone was being born – a new twig, leaf or flower was drawn.

=== Rodnovers&#x27; opinions ===

Russian volkhs Veleslav (Ilya Cherkasov) and Dobroslav (Alexey Dobrovolsky) describe Rod as a life force, the god &quot;all-pervading&quot; and &quot;omnipresent.&quot; In cosmology, considered the source of cosmic emanation, which is expressed in the hierarchy of the gods.

<doc id="799936" wikidata="Q27431036" url="?curid=799936" title="Eagle Harbor, Michigan">
<text>Eagle Harbor is an unincorporated community and census-designated place located on the north side of the Keweenaw Peninsula within Eagle Harbor Township, located on the tip of Michigan&#x27;s farthest county, Keweenaw County, in the U.S. State of Michigan. Its population was 69 as of the 2020 census. M-26 passes through this community. This hamlet was especially popular with the sailors in days past, as it had a good steamboat landing and is about equally distant from Sault Sainte Marie, Michigan, and Duluth, Minnesota. It was the first stop for supplies for the many boats on Lake Superior.

==Etymology==
This community received its name from the beautiful harbor and the many eagles that were then in the region. It has an excellent sand beach on a large bay some four miles in circumference. Additionally, the harbor is irregularly shaped about four-thousand-nine-hundred feet long and one-thousand-one-hundred feet in width. With a natural opening, its entrance is on the west side of a large rock that appears above the surface of the water about forty rods from the east cape of the harbor. There is a reef of sunken rocks off the mouth of the bay, but the harbor may be entered from the north-west or north-east, between the reef and the capes, the opening being about one-thousand-five-hundred feet wide.

==History==
=== Early history ===

Edward Taylor and a group of men came to Eagle Harbor prior to the winter of 1842 and 1843, spending the winter on the lake shore between Copper Harbor and Eagle River. In the year of 1844, Taylor returned to Eagle Harbor and constructed a tavern out of logs, which later burned down on an unspecified date. The location in which the tavern sat is now the site of the present-day Lake Breeze Hotel. Taylor then erected yet another saloon and built additions to his building as more space was eventually required. This, too, also burned down.

On January 17, 1852, the new wood-frame dining room and kitchen were saved from the devouring flames by strenuous efforts and the favorable turn of the wind. The front of the hotel was soon re-erected by James Bawden and the business was again opened to the public. With a grand total of thirty-six rooms, the Eagle Harbor Hotel was the largest hotel in all of Keweenaw County.

James Rasewarn purchased the Eagle Harbor Hotel in the year of 1881. He was born in Cornwall, England, on July 7, 1835, and was brought up by a miner. He came to the United States in 1854, working in New Jersey for one year. In 1855, he moved to the Lake Superior region and worked for eight months at the Flint Steel mine, as well as in the Douglass Houghton, Toltec and Evergreen mines. After a brief four-year trip to England, Brazil and South America, he returned to the United States and located at the Central mine, where he worked for three and a half years as a copper miner, and then worked at the Copper Falls mine for eight years. During the fall of 1880, he moved to Eagle Harbor, and in June 1881 leased the Eagle Harbor Hotel, purchasing it during the same year.

The area was first occupied by the Eagle Harbor Mining Company, who landed a party of men here during the summer of 1845, a man by the name of Sprague being its agent. On October 17, 1845, Franklin Hopkins arrived with thirteen men and resided within a tent. He arrived at Copper Harbor the night that Dr. Douglass Houghton drowned, and had to remain there for four days because of the memorable storm of October 13, 1845, which deprived the copper region of its most able and accomplished explorer and surveyor.

Hopkins was one of the earliest pioneers of the Lake Superior region, and an early mining agent. He was born in Trenton, New York, on November 28, 1817. He moved to the Lower Peninsula of Michigan in 1845. He first worked at the North American mine and then at the Eagle Harbor mine, working as a mining carpenter, staying with that company for two years. He then went to the Lower, Peninsula, returning in 1848 when he was appointed carpenter to the Methodist Indian Mission at L&#x27;Anse. He completed the trip to L&#x27;Anse on foot and after fifteen months left the Mission, as he did not particularly enjoy that position.

Hopkins then went to the old Northwest mine, which was later known as the Conglomerate, and continued working at that mine for two years. He then served two years as the agent of the Isle Royale mine at Houghton, moving to take charge of the Pontiac mine for a short time. He then kept the Phoenix House at Eagle River. It was during this time that he lost his wife and one child on the wrecked steamer PS Lady Elgin, on September 8, 1860. He became connected with the dock and warehouse business and thus became one of its most active citizens.

During the community&#x27;s earliest time, there was only one house in the area, and it was constructed of rough logs and covered with &quot;shakes&quot; which are thin strips split from logs. By 1846, Hiram Joy was tending to a log constructed boardinghouse in Eagle Harbor, which was purchased by Charles Kuntz in 1849. At this time there were four buildings in the town. Charles Kuntz was the village blacksmith and was born in Germany, in the village of Wennenbergerhoff, on November 25, 1822. He emigrated to the United States in 1844, landing at New Orleans where he spent six months, moving up to the northern states where he became engaged as a blacksmith at the Northwest mine, remaining there for two years. He then did blacksmith work at the Copper Falls mine during the years of 1847, 1848 and 1850. In 1849 he moved to Eagle harbor, where he opened a blacksmith shop and maintained the hotel. He was known as a large real estate owner and had quite a few buildings. He was also Under Sheriff for Houghton County, and upon the organization of Michigan&#x27;s new Keweenaw County, he was elected as Sheriff of that county, being an efficient peace officer.

===Recent history===
In 1983, the Holy Protection Monastery of the Society of St. John belonging to the Ukrainian Metropoly was formed in Eagle Harbor and is known for its Poorrock Abbey™ preserves. The community of Eagle Harbor was listed as a newly organized census-designated place for the 2010 census, meaning it now has officially defined boundaries and population statistics for the first time.

==Climate==
Eagle Harbor has a humid continental climate (Dfb). Summers are short but warm with cool nights. Winters are long, cold, and very snowy due to lake effect snow from Lake Superior. Precipitation is relatively uniform year round.

==Demographics==

As of 2020, the population of Eagle Harbor was 69 and its median household income was $76,406.

<doc id="799945" wikidata="Q7055259" url="?curid=799945" title="North Eastern Council">
<text>North Eastern Council (NEC) is a statutory advisory body constituted under the North Eastern Council Act 1971 and came into being on 8 August 1972 at Shillong. The eight States of Northeast India viz. Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura and Sikkim, are members of the council, with their respective Chief Ministers and Governors representing them. Sikkim was added to the council in the year 2002. The headquarters of the council is situated in Shillong and functions under the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DONER) of the Government of India.

==Role==
The Council was initially set up as an advisory body but now sanctioned as a Regional planning body since 2002. They now discuss any matter in which the North Eastern States have a common interest and decide the action to be taken on any such matter. This was done so as to take care of the economic and social planning of these states, as well as to provide mediation in the event of inter-State disputes.

==Funding==
The funding of the Council mainly lies with the Central Government, with historically 56% contributed by the state governments and the rest by the central govt departments. 3 year plan issued in 2017, envisages an annual budget of INR2500 crore, 40% from the government and the rest 60% from the Non-Laspable Central Pool of Resources (NLCPR).

==Impact==
The distribution of financial resources spent has been 47% towards transport and communication, 14% in agriculture, 11% in human resource development and education, 9% in power, 4% in health, 3% in tourism and 3% in industries for fiscal year 2017. The Council has demonstrated considerable achievements, mostly in the provision of electricity, education, highways and bridges development in the North-Eastern States. The Council has also taken up major highway and bridge building projects and funds several engineering and medical colleges. The council has funded projects producing around 250 megawatts of electricity to reduce the region&#x27;s dependency on the States of West Bengal and Odisha.

<text>Makiki is an area of Honolulu, Hawaii, located northeast of downtown Honolulu, stretching east to west from Punahou Street to Pensacola Street and north to south from Round Top Drive/Makiki Heights Drive to Lunalilo Freeway. Punchbowl, an extinct tuff cone, and Tantalus overlook the Makiki.

==Composition of area==
The area consists primarily of older houses, smaller apartment buildings, and side streets. Major roadways include Punahou Street, Pensacola Street, Piikoi Street, Nehoa Street, and Wilder Avenue. The area also includes a fire station, hospital, public school system, private schools including Punahou School, several churches of various denominations, a library, a community center, market place, and parks. The valley heights have hiking trails owned by the state for public use, and are mostly underdeveloped; a non-profit conservation organization, Hawaii Nature Center, has a small property providing conservation education and work opportunity to local schools students.
Two Makiki community organizations, Hui o Makiki and Friends of Makiki Community Library, have worked together to create a Makiki Community with information about educational, cultural, recreational, and social-service offerings in the Makiki area, including a calendar of events.

==History==
Punahou school was opened in Makiki on July 11, 1842, with the mission of educating missionary children, on a land grant of 200 acres from Governor Boki near the site of &quot;Kapunahou&quot; water spring. Makiki is also the site of the Claus &quot;King of Sugar&quot; Spreckels Victorian-style mansion near Dole Street, which was later refurbished and converted into the St. Louis Alumni Clubhouse. Lunalilo Home was opened in Makiki under the sponsorship of King William Charles Lunalilo for &quot;the poor, the destitute, the infirm, and the aged people of Hawaiian blood or extraction, giving preference to old people.&quot; Central Union Church on Beretania and Punahou streets was cornerstoned on December 2, 1922 (completed in 1924), on property that belonged to the Dillingham homestead.

==Notable residents==
*Ferdinand Marcos and his wife Imelda Romualdez Marcos in the Makiki Heights area, after being overthrown in the 1986 People Power Revolution.
*Bruno Mars, President Theodore Roosevelt High School, R&amp;B Singer.
*Brian Schatz, U.S. Senator of Hawaii, resides in the district.

<doc id="799952" wikidata="Q1141924" url="?curid=799952" title="Videotape format war">
<text>The videotape format war was a period of competition or &quot;format war&quot; of incompatible models of consumer-level analog video videocassette and video cassette recorders (VCR) in the late 1970s and the 1980s, mainly involving the Betamax and Video Home System (VHS) formats. VHS ultimately emerged as the preeminent format.

==History==
Sony had demonstrated a prototype videotape recording system it called &quot;Beta&quot; to the other electronics manufacturers in 1974, and expected that they would back a single format for the good of all. But JVC in particular decided to go with its own format. 

Manufacturers also introduced other systems such as needle-based, record-style discs (RCA&#x27;s Capacitance Electronic Disc, JVC&#x27;s Video High Density disc) and optical discs (Philips/MCA/Pioneer&#x27;s LaserDisc). None of these disc formats gained much ground as none was capable of home recording; however, they did hold small niche markets. 

Some sources say that VHS won over Betamax due to the greater availability of pornographic movies on the format. In the 1980s, the founder of Vivid Entertainment said &quot;we pushed VHS harder, and in that sense we did have something to do with VHS winning out&quot;. Steve Duplessie, the founder of research firm Enterprise Strategy Group, disagreed, saying that VHS won over Betamax due to its more open format.

==Competing technologies==
Sony had met with Matsushita executives in late 1974/early 1975 to discuss the forthcoming home video market. 

Soon after, RCA met with executives at the Victor Company of Japan (JVC), at the time a Matsushita subsidiary, who had created their own video format called &quot;VHS&quot; (which stands for &quot;Video Home System&quot;). But JVC also refused to compromise the picture quality of their format by allowing a four-hour mode. JVC&#x27;s parent corporation, Matsushita, later met with RCA and agreed to manufacture a four-hour-capable VHS machine for RCA.

===Picture-quality===
When Betamax was introduced in Japan and the United States in 1975, its Beta I speed of 1.57 inches per second (ips) offered a higher horizontal resolution (approximately 250 lines vs 240 lines horizontal NTSC), lower video noise, and less luma/chroma crosstalk than VHS, and was later marketed as providing pictures superior to VHS&#x27;s playback. However, the introduction of Beta II speed, 0.79 ips (two-hour mode), to compete with VHS&#x27;s two-hour Standard Play mode (1.31 ips) reduced Betamax&#x27;s horizontal resolution to 240 lines.

===Outcome===
Although Betamax initially owned 100% of the market in 1975 (as VHS did not launch until the following year) the perceived value of longer recording-times eventually tipped the balance in favor of VHS. By 1980, VHS had proven favorable among consumers and was successful in controlling 60% of the North American market. By 1981, sales of Beta machines in the United States had sunk to 25% of the VCR market. As movie studios, video studios, and video rental stores turned away from Betamax, the combination of lower market share and a lack of available titles further strengthened VHS&#x27;s position. In the United Kingdom Beta held a 25% market share, but by 1986 it was down to 7.5% and continued to decline further. In Japan, Betamax had more success, but VHS was still the market leader. By 1987, VHS accounted for 90% of the VCR market in the United States. In 1988, &quot;Videofax&quot; magazine declared that Beta had lost the format war after Sony agreed to start adding VHS to the company&#x27;s VCR lineup.

Both Betamax and VHS were supplanted by higher-quality video available from laser-based technology. The last Sony Betamax unit was produced in 2002, while the last VCR/DVD combo unit was produced in 2016.

==End of Beta==
What Sony did not take into account was what consumers wanted. While Betamax was &quot;believed&quot; to be the superior format in the minds of the public and press (due to excellent marketing by Sony), consumers wanted an &quot;affordable&quot; VCR (which often cost hundreds of dollars less than a Betamax player); Korean electronic manufacturers, such as Samsung and GoldStar (now LG Electronics), responded to Funai, Shintom, and Orion Electric for the availability of video cassette players (VCP) to movie rental stores, by offering first VHS VCR prices down to under $300 by year 1986. Sony believed that having better quality recordings was the key to success, and that consumers would be willing to pay a higher retail price for this, whereas it soon became clear that consumer desire was focused more intently on recording-time, lower retail price, compatibility with other machines for sharing (as VHS was becoming the format in the majority of homes), and brand loyalty to companies who licensed VHS (RCA, Magnavox, Zenith, Quasar, Mitsubishi, Panasonic, Hitachi, Sharp, even JVC itself, etc.). In addition, Sony, being the first producer to offer its technology, also thought it would establish Betamax as the leading format. This kind of lock-in and path dependence failed for Sony, but succeeded for JVC. For forty years JVC dominated the home market with its VHS, Super VHS and VHS-C formats, and collected billions in royalty payments.

The video recording market was an unknown when VCRs first came on the market; as such, Sony and JVC were both developing technologies that were unproven. As a result of the desire to enter the marketplace faster, the firms both spent less time on research and development and tried to save money by picking a version of the technology they thought would do best without exploring the full gamut of options.

==Similar video-format-wars==
Following the videotape format war, VHS was dominant until the creation of DVD technology. The major electronics corporations agreed on a single standard for playback of pre-recorded material on DVDs. A minor skirmish arose over DIVX, but it died a quick death. Video 2000, a system developed by Grundig and Philips in 1979 was available for PAL and SECAM and distributed only in Europe, South Africa and Argentina. A later format-war resulted from a failure to agree on a single standard for DVD&#x27;s high-definition successor (HD DVD) in May 2005. This format war ended in victory for the Blu-ray Disc Association&#x27;s Blu-ray Disc in February 2008.

<doc id="799959" wikidata="Q93630" url="?curid=799959" title="National Order of Vietnam">
<text>The National Order of Vietnam () was a combined military-civilian decoration of South Vietnam and was considered the highest honor that could be bestowed upon an individual by the Republic of Vietnam government.

The decoration was created in 1950 and was awarded to any person who performed &quot;grandiose works, remarkable deeds, exhibited bravery, or for those who have honored and served the country by lofty virtues and outstanding knowledge.&quot;

The National Order was modeled after the French National Order of the Legion of Honour, and as such it was issued in five degrees:

*Grand Cross – wore the badge of the Order on a sash on the right shoulder, plus the star of the Order on the right stomach or just the star of the Order on the left stomach
*Grand Officer – wore the star of the Order on the right stomach
*Commander – wore the badge on a necklet
*Officer – wore the badge on a ribbon with rosette on the left chest
*Knight – wore the badge on a ribbon on the left chest

Both the badge and the star had the same design, as shown in the top right of this page. The ribbon was red with yellow borders. It was, in fact, the ribbon of the former Order of the Dragon of Annam when awarded by the Emperor of Annam himself (when awarded by the French Government the ribbon was green with orange borders).

During the Vietnam War, the National Order of Vietnam was bestowed on several members of the United States military, most of whom were senior military and political advisors to the South Vietnamese government. The decoration could also be awarded posthumously.

Since the National Order of Vietnam was both a civil and a military decoration, it was displayed above all other awards when worn on a military uniform. A purely military equivalent of the decoration was the Vietnam Military Merit Medal, awarded only to members of the military.

<text>Kabuki syndrome (previously known as Kabuki-makeup syndrome (KMS) or Niikawa–Kuroki syndrome) is a rare congenital disorder of genetic origin. It affects multiple parts of the body, with varying symptoms and severity, although the most common is the characteristic facial appearance.

Kabuki syndrome (KS) affects roughly one in 32,000 births. It was first identified and described in 1981 by two Japanese groups, led by scientists Norio Niikawa and Yoshikazu Kuroki. It is named Kabuki syndrome because of the facial resemblance of affected individuals to stage makeup used in &quot;kabuki&quot;, a Japanese traditional theatrical form.

There are two types of Kabuki syndrome. Type 1 is caused by pathogenic variants in KMT2D and Type 2 is caused by pathogenic variants in KDM6A.

== Signs and symptoms ==

Specific symptoms for Kabuki syndrome vary, with large differences between affected individuals. Most people with Kabuki syndrome have distinctive facial features that include arched eyebrows, long eyelashes, elongated eyelids with lower lids that turn out, prominent ears, a flat tip of the nose and a downward slant to the mouth.

Overlapping phenotypic features for patients between KDM6A and KMT2D variations include prominent ears, abnormal dentition, congenital heart disease, feeding difficulties, cryptorchidism, joint hypermobility, developmental delay, hypotonia, and behavioral difficulties.

Other common symptoms are skeletal abnormalities, short stature, heart defects, feeding difficulties and a failure to thrive, vision and hearing difficulties, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), small head size (microcephaly), and frequent infections.

Mild to moderate intellectual disability and mild to severe developmental delay are often associated with Kabuki syndrome. Infants and young children often experience difficulties relating to hypotonia, feeding issues/failure to thrive, infections, surgical repair of heart and palate defects and developmental delays.

Young children with Kabuki syndrome benefit from early intervention services. School age children tend to have fewer medical issues requiring hospitalization, though frequent infections, hearing loss and feeding issues occur. In addition, intellectual impairment, difficulty with visuospatial tasks and maintaining attention usually require an individualized education plan (IEP) if the child attends public school. Older children and adults report difficulties with anxiety. Endocrine abnormalities and immune system abnormalities such as idiopathic thrombocytopenia (ITP) and common variable immune deficiency (CVID) are medical issues that tend to present in older children, adolescents and adults.

== Causes ==
Type 1 Kabuki syndrome is caused by germline heterozygous loss of function variants in &quot;KMT2D&quot; (formerly known as the &quot;MLL2&quot;), located on human chromosome 12. It is estimated that between 55 and 80% of cases of Kabuki syndrome are of Type 1. Type 1 Kabuki syndrome demonstrates an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.

Type 2 Kabuki syndrome is caused by germline hemizygous (in males) or heterozygous (in females) chromosome deletions or loss of function point variants involving &quot;KDM6A&quot; (formerly known as &quot;UTX)&quot;, located on the X chromosome. Approximately 5% of cases of Kabuki syndrome are of Type 2. Type 2 Kabuki syndrome demonstrates an X-linked dominant pattern of inheritance.

Most cases of Kabuki syndrome occur &quot;de novo&quot;, that is, the parents are unaffected and the gene was mutated early in embryological development. However, several cases of inherited mutations causing Type 1 or Type 2 Kabuki syndrome are now known.

Some cases of Kabuki syndrome have no identifiable causative mutation. These may represent individuals with types of mutations that are challenging to detect via current routine investigations or patients who have disorders that share some features with Kabuki syndrome.

== Pathophysiology ==
The &quot;KMT2D&quot; and &quot;KDM6A&quot; genes belong to a family of genes called chromatin-modifying enzymes. Specifically, these genes code for a histone methyltransferase (KMT2D) and a histone demethylase (KDM6A), and play a part in the regulation of gene expression. Under normal circumstances, these enzymes transfer methyl groups on and off histones to regulate genes via epigenetic pathways. When the genes that encode these enzymes are mutated, epigenetic activation of certain developmental genes is impaired and developmental abnormalities occur, leading to the characteristics of Kabuki syndrome patients. The specific developmental genes that are affected by the impaired epigenetic mechanisms in Kabuki syndrome are not yet fully known.

There are hundreds of different mutations that have been identified in Kabuki syndrome patients. Most of these mutations are in the &quot;KMT2D&quot; gene and involve a change in amino acid sequence that creates a shortened and nonfunctional chromatin-modifying enzyme.

==Diagnosis==

Kabuki syndrome is diagnosed with genetic testing (targeted, whole exome or whole genome sequencing). When genetic testing is not available, Kabuki syndrome is diagnosed clinically (through identifying symptoms, physical exams, and lab results), most commonly by a geneticist.

A consensus on clinical diagnostic criteria for KS was defined in December 2018 by an international group of experts. The authors propose that a definitive diagnosis can be made in an individual of any age with a history of infantile hypotonia, developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, and one or both of the following major criteria: 
# a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in KMT2D or KDM6A; and (2) typical dysmorphic features (defined below) at some point of life. Typical dysmorphic features include long palpebral fissures with eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid and two or more of the following: (1) arched and broad eyebrows with the lateral third displaying notching or sparseness;
# short columella with depressed nasal tip;
# large, prominent or cupped ears; and # persistent fingertip pads.

Further criteria for a probable and possible diagnosis, including a table of suggestive clinical features, were included in the publication.

The original description of Kabuki syndrome by Niikawa et al. defined five cardinal manifestations, although some of these “cardinal manifestations” may or may not be present in a patient with Kabuki syndrome.

# Typical facial features: Elongated palpebral fissures with eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid; arched and broad eyebrows with the lateral third displaying sparseness or notching; short columella with depressed nasal tip; large, prominent, or cupped ears
# Skeletal anomalies: Spinal column abnormalities, including sagittal cleft vertebrae, butterfly vertebrae, narrow intervertebral disc space, and/or scoliosis, Brachydactyly V Brachymesophalangy Clinodactyly of fifth digits
# Dermatoglyphic abnormalities: persistence of fetal fingertip pads
# Mild to moderate intellectual disability
# Postnatal growth deficiency

Diagnosis can be difficult given the large spectrum of disease. The fact that some patients do not carry one of the two known mutations or can carry multiple mutations complicates the diagnosis further. In 2017, researchers published work that showed people with Kabuki syndrome have a unique pattern of DNA methylation. This unique methylation pattern may lead to new ways to diagnose Kabuki syndrome in those who do not show mutations in KMT2D or KDM6A, but still present with a Kabuki syndrome phenotype.

== Screening ==
Due to its rarity, Kabuki syndrome is not screened for in routine prenatal testing including blood tests, chorionic villus sampling (CVS), or amniocentesis. Although not routine for the general population, if Kabuki syndrome is a specific concern (i.e. expectant mother who has been diagnosed with Kabuki syndrome or sibling with KS), it is possible to test for one of the specific mutations. This prenatal testing does require a CVS or amniocentesis. However Kabuki syndrome is usually not inherited and therefore most cases do not have a positive family history. Kabuki syndrome can have positive screening tests, such as cystic hygroma seen on nuchal translucency ultrasound screening, although these findings are non-specific and have a wide differential diagnosis.

==Management==
Management is supportive, aimed at improving quality of life. Newly diagnosed patients with Kabuki syndrome will often undergo tests that are aimed at detecting common abnormalities associated with the syndrome. They include an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) for detection of structural heart defects, kidney ultrasound for detection of structural renal abnormalities, immunoglobulin levels, pneumococcal titers and a hearing screening test. Further evaluation and testing by specialists may be indicated in addition to cardiology, nephrology, allergy/immunology, audiology-mentioned above. This may include orthopedics (such as hip dysplasia), pulmonary (sleep study to rule out obstructive sleep apnea due to hypotonia), ophthalmology evaluation (vision screen), ENT evaluation (hearing evaluation), Neurology evaluation (i.e. if seizures present), Hematology evaluation (if bleeding disorder), GI evaluation (if gi abnormalities), or others as needed.

There are currently no Kabuki syndrome specific treatments and there is no cure. Treatment plans are customized to address the symptoms the individual is experiencing. For example, someone experiencing seizures will be treated with the standard anti-epilepsy therapies. Additionally, patients with Kabuki syndrome are routinely evaluated and monitored to address problems that may develop, such as vision or hearing problems, or cognitive difficulties. If congenital heart disease is present, prophylactic antibiotics may be recommended before any procedures such as dental work that might cause infection.

== Prognosis ==
Life expectancy is not shortened in most cases of Kabuki syndrome. Some patients have coexisting conditions which may shorten life expectancy, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome or kidney dysfunction. It is important that patients with cardiac, renal, or immunologic issues are identified and well-managed.

== Epidemiology ==
Kabuki syndrome occurs about once in every 32,000 births. The disease appears to affect all population groups equally, with no differences based on sex, race, or environment. In 2023, a project called Kabuki Count was launched by a global collection of patient advocacy groups (led by the Kabuki Syndrome Foundation) as a global census to document how many people have Kabuki syndrome worldwide.

== Research ==
Research on Kabuki syndrome is limited due to its low incidence. Despite this, several groups around the world are studying Kabuki syndrome.

In the United States, these include Dr. Hans Bjornson at Johns Hopkins University, The Roya Kabuki Program at Boston Children&#x27;s Hospital, Dr. Mark Hannibal at the University of Michigan, Dr. Margaret Adam at Seattle Children&#x27;s Hospital, Dr. Jacqui Harris at Kennedy Krieger Institute, as well as groups at University of Colorado, University of Utah, University of South Florida and others.

In the UK, Prof Siddharth Banka&#x27;s group at the University of Manchester and Manchester University Hospitals has a research program for Kabuki syndrome. In Canada, Dr. Rosanna Weksberg at SickKids and University of Toronto. Several European groups based in Italy, France, Germany and the Netherlands are also actively working on improving understanding of the condition and to identifying potential treatments.

In 2018, the Kabuki Syndrome Foundation was established to accelerate research efforts to treat or cure Kabuki syndrome. They launched the Kabuki Syndrome Outcome measures and Biomarkers Consortium (KSOC) in 2023 which is a collaborative clinical research study of Kabuki syndrome biomarkers.

== History ==

In 1969, Norio Niikawa MD, a geneticist in Japan, was treating a child patient presenting with unique facial characteristics and various health problems. Never having seen this constellation of symptoms before, Dr Niikawa wondered if he was faced with an undiagnosed condition, a disorder with a genetic basis. Over the next several years, this physician treated several other patients with the same symptoms in his outpatient genetics clinic, furthering support for a disorder never before diagnosed.

In 1979, Dr Niikawa presented his findings and hypothesis at the first Japan Dysmorphology Conference. A fellow physician at this conference, Yoshikazu Kuroki, recognized the symptoms, and realized that he had also seen several paediatric patients with this presentation; he presented two of his own cases at the second annual conference the following year. In 1981, the two doctors separately submitted articles on this new diagnosis to the &quot;Journal of Pediatrics&quot;.

Dr Niikawa coined the term &#x27;Kabuki syndrome&#x27; (also known as Kabuki make-up syndrome or Niikawa–Kuroki syndrome) as a reference to traditional Japanese theatre which he respected greatly. Many of the children presenting with this diagnosis had unusual, elongated lower eyelids, and this feature was reminiscent of the theatrical make-up worn by actors in Kabuki theatre.

As reported by Dr. Niikawa &quot;The name, &#x27;Kabuki make-up&#x27;, of the syndrome was given by myself, because the facial appearance of patients, especially eversion of their lower eyelids, is reminiscent of the makeup of actors in Kabuki, the traditional form of Japanese theater. Kabuki was founded early in the 17th century in Japan and over the next 300 years developed into a sophisticated form of theater. Kabuki actors usually apply traditional makeup to strengthen their eyes, especially in a hero play, and they are very proud of their performing art.&quot;

The individual kanji, from left to right, mean &quot;sing&quot; (歌), &quot;dance&quot; (舞), and &quot;skill&quot; (伎). Kabuki is therefore sometimes translated as &quot;the art of singing and dancing&quot;.

The genes for Kabuki syndrome were discovered in 2010 and 2012 for Type 1 and Type 2 Kabuki syndrome respectively.

== In popular culture ==
* &quot;The Good Doctor&quot; is an American medical drama television series that airs on ABC. Season five&#x27;s ninth episode features Matthew Horner, an actor with Kabuki syndrome. Horner is likely the first actor with Kabuki syndrome to be cast in a major network TV drama.
* &quot;Nineteen Paper Cranes&quot; is a short documentary by Michael Joseph McDonald. The film follows a deaf Japanese papermaker with Kabuki syndrome as she memorializes the nineteen victims of the Sagamihara stabbings.

<text>The Conservative Party of Quebec () was a political party in Quebec, Canada, from 1867 until 1936, when it merged with members of the Action libérale nationale to form the .

==Origins==
The party originated as the which was formed around 1850. The &quot;parti bleu&quot; opposed the anti-clericalism of its rival, the &quot;parti rouge&quot;.

The &quot;parti bleu&quot; supported the role of the clergy in Quebec society. Members of the &quot;parti bleu&quot;, led by George-Étienne Cartier from Canada East, joined with the followers of Sir John A. Macdonald in Canada West to form a coalition government with Cartier as co-premier from 1857 to 1862. It was out of this coalition that the Conservative Party was formed (then known as the &quot;Liberal-Conservative Party&quot;), laying the basis for Confederation in 1867.

==Post-Confederation==
With Confederation and Quebec&#x27;s entry as a province, what had been the &quot;parti bleu&quot; became the Quebec wing of Macdonald&#x27;s Conservative Party. It formed the government in the province, with Pierre-Joseph-Olivier Chauveau as Quebec&#x27;s first premier. Cartier acted as Macdonald&#x27;s Quebec lieutenant in the federal House of Commons. The Conservatives dominated Quebec politics at both the federal and provincial level for the next 30 years. The Conservatives held power in Quebec for 25 out of 30 years, providing eight of the province&#x27;s ten premiers in that period.

However, the party became increasingly divided between a moderate wing and an Ultramontane wing of Catholic fundamentalists. As well, the party&#x27;s links with the federal Conservatives harmed the party as the Tories in English Canada became increasingly identified as hostile to French Canadians and Quebec. The execution of Louis Riel in 1885 outraged French Canadians and hurt the Macdonald Conservatives at the polls.

After Macdonald&#x27;s death in 1891, the coalition that formed the national Conservatives unravelled, particularly around the Manitoba Schools Question that pitted English-Canadian Protestants against French-Canadian Catholics. This issue essentially ended the possibility of a significant French-Canadian presence in western Canada.

The federal Conservatives lost the 1896 federal election, largely due to the collapse of their support in Quebec. The provincial Conservative government of Edmund James Flynn lost the 1897 Quebec election.

With the defeats of 1896 and 1897, the Conservatives became a minority party in Quebec at both levels of government. The Conservative Party of Quebec never formed another provincial government. The Quebec Liberal Party held power without interruption for the next 38 years.

==Decline and re-emergence as Union Nationale==
Conservative fortunes were further hurt by the Conscription Crisis of 1917 when the federal Conservative government of Sir Robert Borden invoked conscription against the opposition of Quebec. This led to riots in the province.

In 1929, mayor of Montreal Camillien Houde succeeded Arthur Sauvé as leader of the Conservative Party, which went on to lose four by-elections. 

In 1933, Maurice Duplessis became leader of the Quebec Conservatives. The next year, the ruling Liberal party split when a group of nationalist Liberals dissatisfied with the government of Louis-Alexandre Taschereau bolted from the party to form the Action libérale nationale or ALN. Duplessis wooed the dissident party and, two weeks before the 1935 election, the Conservatives and ALN formed a &quot;&quot; alliance to contest the election. On June 20, 1936 the Quebec Conservative Party dissolved when the alliance became a formal merger into a single political party, the .

Two months later, the UN took power in the 1936 election under the leadership of Duplessis. The party was unexpectedly defeated in 1939, but went on to dominate Quebec politics from 1944 until Duplessis died in 1959.

The Union Nationale formed the government again from 1966–1970 and afterwards went into rapid decline, being supplanted by the Parti Québécois as the main opposition to the Liberals.

==Federal Tories and Quebec after the Union Nationale==
Since the late 1960s, the main divide in Quebec politics was between supporters of Quebec separatism and federalism, rather than the traditional conservatism and liberalism. This resulted in a reorientation of Quebec politics with the conservative collapsing in the early 1970s and the new polarization in Quebec politics being between the separatist Parti Québécois and the federalist Quebec Liberal Party.

Federalists, whether conservative or liberal, generally supported the Liberals with federalist former members joining that party in the 1970s while more nationalist UN members joined the PQ. This reorientation could be seen in the family of former premier Daniel Johnson, Sr. whose son, Daniel Johnson, Jr. joined and eventually became leader of the Quebec Liberals while his brother, Pierre-Marc Johnson, joined and eventually led the PQ.

Claude Wagner, a judge and a prominent Quebec Liberal cabinet minister who departed provincial politics in 1970, ran successfully as a Progressive Conservative in the 1972 federal election, and was the front-runner in the party leadership convention in 1976 before losing on the final ballot to Joe Clark. When Bourassa returned to politics in the 1980s, he worked closely with the federal Progressive Conservatives led by Brian Mulroney. During that decade, the Liberals won the majority of Quebec&#x27;s seats in 1985 and 1989, while the PCs did so at the federal level in 1984 and 1988. Some Quebec Progressive Conservatives attempted to form a provincial party, the Progressive Conservative Party of Quebec, in the 1980s but this effort was not supported by the federal party and failed to win any seats.

In 1998, federal PC leader Jean Charest moved to provincial politics as the leader of the Quebec Liberals.

With the decline of support for separatism in the early twenty-first century there are indications that Quebec politics is returning to a right/left divide and there have been several attempts to create centre-right parties, with varying success. The Action démocratique du Québec was formed in 1994 and attracted support from a number of federal Conservatives due to its neoliberal economic program and populist conservative social positions. In the years following the ADQ&#x27;s collapse following the 2008 Quebec election a new nationalist party was formed, the Coalition Avenir Québec, which absorbed the ADQ in 2012. Conservative Quebec federalists have created a new Quebec Conservative Party under the leadership of former Conservative Party of Canada MP Luc Harvey.

<doc id="799986" wikidata="Q851014" url="?curid=799986" title="Fraunhofer diffraction">
<text>In optics, the Fraunhofer diffraction equation is used to model the diffraction of waves when plane waves are incident on a diffracting object, and the diffraction pattern is viewed at a sufficiently long distance (a distance satisfying Fraunhofer condition) from the object (in the far-field region), and also when it is viewed at the focal plane of an imaging lens. In contrast, the diffraction pattern created near the diffracting object and (in the near field region) is given by the Fresnel diffraction equation.

The equation was named in honor of Joseph von Fraunhofer although he was not actually involved in the development of the theory.

This article explains where the Fraunhofer equation can be applied, and shows Fraunhofer diffraction patterns for various apertures. A detailed mathematical treatment of Fraunhofer diffraction is given in Fraunhofer diffraction equation.

==Equation==

When a beam of light is partly blocked by an obstacle, some of the light is scattered around the object, light and dark bands are often seen at the edge of the shadow – this effect is known as diffraction. These effects can be modelled using the Huygens–Fresnel principle; Huygens postulated that every point on a wavefront acts as a source of spherical secondary wavelets and the sum of these secondary wavelets determines the form of the proceeding wave at any subsequent time, while Fresnel developed an equation using the Huygens wavelets together with the principle of superposition of waves, which models these diffraction effects quite well.

It is generally not straightforward to calculate the wave amplitude given by the sum of the secondary wavelets (The wave sum is also a wave.), each of which has its own amplitude, phase, and oscillation direction (polarization), since this involves addition of many waves of varying amplitude, phase, and polarization. When two light waves as electromagnetic fields are added together (vector sum), the amplitude of the wave sum depends on the amplitudes, the phases, and even the polarizations of individual waves. On a certain direction where electromagnetic wave fields are projected (or considering a situation where two waves have the same polarization), two waves of equal (projected) amplitude which are in phase (same phase) give the amplitude of the resultant wave sum as double the individual wave amplitudes, while two waves of equal amplitude which are in opposite phases give the zero amplitude of the resultant wave as they cancel out each other. Generally, a two-dimensional integral over complex variables has to be solved and in many cases, an analytic solution is not available.

The Fraunhofer diffraction equation is a simplified version of Kirchhoff&#x27;s diffraction formula and it can be used to model light diffraction when both a light source and a viewing plane (a plane of observation where the diffracted wave is observed) are effectively infinitely distant from a diffracting aperture. With a sufficiently distant light source from a diffracting aperture, the incident light to the aperture is effectively a plane wave so that the phase of the light at each point on the aperture is the same. At a sufficiently distant plane of observation from the aperture, the phase of the wave coming from each point on the aperture varies linearly with the point position on the aperture, making the calculation of the sum of the waves at an observation point on the plane of observation relatively straightforward in many cases. Even the amplitudes of the secondary waves coming from the aperture at the observation point can be treated as same or constant for a simple diffraction wave calculation in this case. Diffraction in such a geometrical requirement is called &quot;Fraunhofer diffraction&quot;, and the condition where Fraunhofer diffraction is valid is called &quot;Fraunhofer condition&quot;, as shown in the right box. A diffracted wave is often called &quot;Far field&quot; if it at least partially satisfies Fraunhofer condition such that the distance between the aperture and the observation plane formula_1 is formula_2.

For example, if a 0.5 mm diameter circular hole is illuminated by a laser light with 0.6 μm wavelength, then Fraunhofer diffraction occurs if the viewing distance is greater than 1000 mm.

=== Derivation of Fraunhofer condition ===

The derivation of Fraunhofer condition here is based on the geometry described in the right box. The diffracted wave path &quot;r&quot;2 can be expressed in terms of another diffracted wave path &quot;r&quot;1 and the distance &quot;b&quot; between two diffracting points by using the law of cosines;

formula_3

This can be expanded by calculating the expression&#x27;s Taylor series to second order with respect to formula_4,
formula_5

The phase difference between waves propagating along the paths &quot;r&quot;2 and &quot;r&quot;1 are, with the wavenumber where λ is the light wavelength,
formula_6

If formula_7 so formula_8, then the phase difference is formula_9. The geometrical implication from this expression is that the paths &quot;r&quot;2 and &quot;r&quot;1 are approximately parallel with each other. Since there can be a diffraction - observation plane, the diffracted wave path whose angle with respect to a straight line parallel to the optical axis is close to 0, this approximation condition can be further simplified as formula_10 where &quot;L&quot; is the distance between two planes along the optical axis. Due to the fact that an incident wave on a diffracting plane is effectively a plane wave if formula_10 where &quot;L&quot; is the distance between the diffracting plane and the point wave source is satisfied, Fraunhofer condition is formula_10 where &quot;L&quot; is the smaller of the two distances, one is between the diffracting plane and the plane of observation and the other is between the diffracting plane and the point wave source.

===Focal plane of a positive lens as the far field plane===

In the far field, propagation paths for wavelets from every point on an aperture to a point of observation are approximately parallel, and a positive lens (focusing lens) focuses parallel rays toward the lens to a point on the focal plane (the focus point position on the focal plane depends on the angle of the parallel rays with respect to the optical axis). So, if a positive lens with a sufficiently long focal length (so that differences between electric field orientations for wavelets can be ignored at the focus) is placed after an aperture, then the lens practically makes the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern of the aperture on its focal plane as the parallel rays meet each other at the focus.

==Examples==

In each of these examples, the aperture is illuminated by a monochromatic plane wave at normal incidence.

===Diffraction by a narrow rectangular slit===

The width of the slit is . The Fraunhofer diffraction pattern is shown in the image together with a plot of the intensity vs. angle . The pattern has maximum intensity at , and a series of peaks of decreasing intensity. Most of the diffracted light falls between the first minima. The angle, , subtended by these two minima is given by:

formula_13

Thus, the smaller the aperture, the larger the angle subtended by the diffraction bands. The size of the central band at a distance is given by

formula_14

For example, when a slit of width 0.5 mm is illuminated by light of wavelength 0.6 μm, and viewed at a distance of 1000 mm, the width of the central band in the diffraction pattern is 2.4 mm.

The fringes extend to infinity in the direction since the slit and illumination also extend to infinity.

If , the intensity of the diffracted light does not fall to zero, and if , the diffracted wave is cylindrical.

====Semi-quantitative analysis of single-slit diffraction====

We can find the angle at which a first minimum is obtained in the diffracted light by the following reasoning. Consider the light diffracted at an angle where the distance is equal to the wavelength of the illuminating light. The width of the slit is the distance . The component of the wavelet emitted from the point A which is travelling in the direction is in anti-phase with the wave from the point at middle of the slit, so that the net contribution at the angle from these two waves is zero. The same applies to the points just below and , and so on. Therefore, the amplitude of the total wave travelling in the direction is zero. We have:

formula_15

The angle subtended by the first minima on either side of the centre is then, as above:

formula_16

There is no such simple argument to enable us to find the maxima of the diffraction pattern.

==== Single-slit diffraction using Huygens&#x27; principle ====

We can develop an expression for the far field of a continuous array of point sources of uniform amplitude and of the same phase. Let the array of length &quot;a&quot; be parallel to the y axis with its center at the origin as indicated in the figure to the right. Then the differential field is:

formula_17

where formula_18. However formula_19 and integrating from formula_20 to formula_21,

formula_22
where formula_23.

Integrating we then get
formula_24

Letting formula_25 where the array length in radians is formula_26, then,
formula_27

===Diffraction by a rectangular aperture===

The form of the diffraction pattern given by a rectangular aperture is shown in the figure on the right (or above, in tablet format). There is a central semi-rectangular peak, with a series of horizontal and vertical fringes. The dimensions of the central band are related to the dimensions of the slit by the same relationship as for a single slit so that the larger dimension in the diffracted image corresponds to the smaller dimension in the slit. The spacing of the fringes is also inversely proportional to the slit dimension.

If the illuminating beam does not illuminate the whole vertical length of the slit, the spacing of the vertical fringes is determined by the dimensions of the illuminating beam. Close examination of the double-slit diffraction pattern below shows that there are very fine horizontal diffraction fringes above and below the main spot, as well as the more obvious horizontal fringes.

===Diffraction by a circular aperture===
The diffraction pattern given by a circular aperture is shown in the figure on the right. This is known as the Airy diffraction pattern. It can be seen that most of the light is in the central disk. The angle subtended by this disk, known as the Airy disk, is
formula_28
where is the diameter of the aperture.

The Airy disk can be an important parameter in limiting the ability of an imaging system to resolve closely located objects.

===Diffraction by an aperture with a Gaussian profile===

 The diffraction pattern obtained given by an aperture with a Gaussian profile, for example, a photographic slide whose transmissivity has a Gaussian variation is also a Gaussian function. The form of the function is plotted on the right (above, for a tablet), and it can be seen that, unlike the diffraction patterns produced by rectangular or circular apertures, it has no secondary rings. This technique can be used in a process called apodization—the aperture is covered by a Gaussian filter, giving a diffraction pattern with no secondary rings.

The output profile of a single mode laser beam may have a Gaussian intensity profile and the diffraction equation can be used to show that it maintains that profile however far away it propagates from the source.

===Diffraction by a double slit===

In the double-slit experiment, the two slits are illuminated by a single light beam. If the width of the slits is small enough (less than the wavelength of the light), the slits diffract the light into cylindrical waves. These two cylindrical wavefronts are superimposed, and the amplitude, and therefore the intensity, at any point in the combined wavefronts depends on both the magnitude and the phase of the two wavefronts. These fringes are often known as Young&#x27;s fringes.

The angular spacing of the fringes is given by
formula_29

The spacing of the fringes at a distance from the slits is given by
formula_30
where is the separation of the slits.

The fringes in the picture were obtained using the yellow light from a sodium light (wavelength = 589 nm), with slits separated by 0.25 mm, and projected directly onto the image plane of a digital camera.

Double-slit interference fringes can be observed by cutting two slits in a piece of card, illuminating with a laser pointer, and observing the diffracted light at a distance of 1 m. If the slit separation is 0.5 mm, and the wavelength of the laser is 600 nm, then the spacing of the fringes viewed at a distance of 1 m would be 1.2 mm.

====Semi-quantitative explanation of double-slit fringes====
The difference in phase between the two waves is determined by the difference in the distance travelled by the two waves.

If the viewing distance is large compared with the separation of the slits (the far field), the phase difference can be found using the geometry shown in the figure. The path difference between two waves travelling at an angle is given by
formula_31

When the two waves are in phase, i.e. the path difference is equal to an integral number of wavelengths, the summed amplitude, and therefore the summed intensity is maximal, and when they are in anti-phase, i.e. the path difference is equal to half a wavelength, one and a half wavelengths, etc., then the two waves cancel, and the summed intensity is zero. This effect is known as interference.

The interference fringe maxima occur at angles
formula_32
where is the wavelength of the light. The angular spacing of the fringes is given by
formula_33

When the distance between the slits and the viewing plane is , the spacing of the fringes is equal to and is the same as above:
formula_34

===Diffraction by a grating===

 A grating is defined in Born and Wolf as &quot;any arrangement which imposes on an incident wave a periodic variation of amplitude or phase, or both&quot;.

A grating whose elements are separated by diffracts a normally incident beam of light into a set of beams, at angles given by:

formula_35

This is known as the grating equation. The finer the grating spacing, the greater the angular separation of the diffracted beams.

If the light is incident at an angle , the grating equation is:
formula_36

The detailed structure of the repeating pattern determines the form of the individual diffracted beams, as well as their relative intensity while the grating spacing always determines the angles of the diffracted beams.

The image on the right shows a laser beam diffracted by a grating into = 0, and ±1 beams. The angles of the first order beams are about 20°; if we assume the wavelength of the laser beam is 600 nm, we can infer that the grating spacing is about 1.8 μm.

====Semi-quantitative explanation====

 A simple grating consists of a series of slits in a screen. If the light travelling at an angle from each slit has a path difference of one wavelength with respect to the adjacent slit, all these waves will add together, so that the maximum intensity of the diffracted light is obtained when:
formula_37

This is the same relationship that is given above.

<text>Arrows Grand Prix International was a British Formula One team active from to . It was known as Footwork from 1991 to 1996.

== Origins ==
The Arrows Grand Prix International team was founded in Milton Keynes, England in November 1977, by Italian businessman Franco Ambrosio, Alan Rees, former racing driver Jackie Oliver, Dave Wass and Tony Southgate (the team deriving its name from the initials of their surnames) when they left the Shadow team. The team was formed and appeared on the grid for their first race at the 1978 Brazilian Grand Prix, all within three months.

Arrows signed Gunnar Nilsson and Riccardo Patrese to drive, but Nilsson was diagnosed with cancer shortly afterwards. His failing health caused Rolf Stommelen to take his place. The team initially ran a copy of the Shadow DN9, with the initials of the team&#x27;s first sponsor, Franco Ambrosio, used in naming the car, the Arrows FA1. However, Ambrosio left the team in early 1978 when jailed in Italy for financial irregularities and main sponsor became Warsteiner. Shadow sued for copyright infringement, and the London High Courts ruled that the FA1 was a direct copy of the Shadow DN9. Arrows knew that they would lose the case and designed a brand new car, the Arrows A1, in 52 days. It was shown the day after the High Court of Justice in London upheld Shadow&#x27;s claim and banned the team from racing the FA1.

==Arrows Grand Prix International==
Patrese scored points in the team&#x27;s third race, the US West Grand Prix at Long Beach. He was on course for victory in South Africa, but an engine failure in the closing stages of the race robbed him of the win. A second-place finish in Sweden behind Niki Lauda and the infamous fan car was a highlight for the Italian. In September 1978, in the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, Patrese was involved in an accident which eventually claimed the life of Ronnie Peterson. Patrese was accused of causing the accident and then subsequently banned from racing at the following event (the United States Grand Prix) by his fellow drivers. Patrese was later exonerated of all charges.

At the 1979 Monaco GP, Jochen Mass&#x27; Arrows A1 moved into third place during the race and looked to be closing in on the leaders. However, brake issues dropped him down to sixth position by the chequered flag. Lotus had introduced ground effect to F1 in 1978. As a result, Tony Southgate designed a radical ground effect car, the A2. While striking to look at, it was not competitive and Arrows was forced to use an upgraded version of the A1.

===Moderate success in the 1980s===
With the A2 being too radical, Southgate penned the Arrows A3 for 1980. The car was competitive, and it was used during the following season as well. In , Patrese scored the team&#x27;s only Formula One pole position in Long Beach, which he led until retiring with mechanical problems on lap 33 of 80. Arrows finished joint eighth in the Constructors&#x27; Championship that year.

At the Long Beach Grand Prix in 1983, World Drivers&#x27; Champion Alan Jones was tempted out of retirement on a one-off basis. He qualified 12th but dropped out with pain in the closing stages. A few weeks prior to the race Jones had fallen from a horse on his farm at home in Australia resulting in a broken hip. Jones also drove for the team at the 1983 Race of Champions at Brands Hatch (the last ever in-season, non-championship Formula One race), finishing 3rd and a week later was later entered in the French Grand Prix with a view to keeping the drive for the duration of the season, however expected sponsorship money never materialised and the teams regular driver Chico Serra returning to the seat.

In with BMW M12 turbo engines and sponsorship from cigarette brand Barclay things got much better. That year they were ninth in the Constructors&#x27; Championship and eighth in . At the 1985 San Marino Grand Prix, Thierry Boutsen finished third behind Alain Prost and Elio de Angelis. However, after the race, Prost was disqualified because his car was 2 kg underweight, giving Boutsen the second place.

Tony Southgate had fallen out with the other founder members and left to work for Tom Walkinshaw, who would have a major impact on the team in later years. The season was a disaster. The A9 car was delivered late after British Aerospace had problems building the team&#x27;s first carbon composite chassis. The car proved uncompetitive and its designer Dave Wass left to join Benetton, leaving just Oliver and Alan Rees in charge. Oliver wasted no time in replacing the two and hired Ross Brawn to design the effective A10 for .

BMW pulled out of Formula One and the engines were badged Megatron through a deal with Arrows major sponsor USF&amp;G, but the British team had their best seasons yet, finishing seventh in 1987 and fifth in (the final year for turbocharged engines) thanks to frequent points finishes by drivers Eddie Cheever and Derek Warwick. While 1987 and 1988 were Arrows&#x27; best years in F1, they were also the cause of frustration for the team and its drivers Warwick and Cheever. At the start of 1987 the sports ruling body (FIA) mandated that all turbo powered cars were to use a pop-off valve in order to restrict turbo boost. This was done not only to slow the cars down for safety reasons, but it was an effort to curb the rapidly rising costs of Formula One. The problem for Arrows was that the valve would regularly cut in lower than the set limit (4.0 bar in 1987, 2.5 bar in 1988). This meant that the Megatron engines were not producing their full power. It took the team&#x27;s engine designer Heini Mader until just before the 1988 Italian Grand Prix at Monza (Round 12) to find the solution, which was simply moving the valve closer to the engine, something Honda and Ferrari engineers had long before discovered. Although Cheever and Warwick finished the race in third and fourth respectively, it was too little too late as the turbo era ended after the 1988 season.

Warwick and Cheever stayed with the team for 1989 and drove the Brawn designed Arrows A11, which was powered by the Ford DFR V8 engine. The team&#x27;s best finish came at the United States Grand Prix in Cheever&#x27;s home town of Phoenix. There, the American scored his final podium finish by finishing third. Ultimately, however, Cheever struggled in the A11 (which had to be specially modified early in the season so the tall American could fit in the car) and he actually failed to qualify at the British and Italian Grands Prix. Warwick&#x27;s perennial bad luck also continued: a long pit stop during the opening race in Brazil cost him what many believed would have been his first win, while at Round 6 in the wet Canadian Grand Prix, Warwick briefly led, and was in second place when his Ford V8 blew. He had been regularly faster than those behind him (including eventual winner Thierry Boutsen, who drove a Williams-Renault), and could have won when race leader Ayrton Senna blew the Honda engine in his McLaren with only two laps remaining. After finishing fifth in 1988, Arrows dropped to seventh in 1989.

==Footwork Arrows==

Japanese businessman Wataru Ohashi invested in Arrows in 1990 and the cars started displaying the Footwork logo prominently. Jackie Oliver sold his shares in the team to Ohashi, but remained as team principal. Alan Jenkins was hired as technical director after Brawn moved to TWR, but had a difficult relationship with Oliver. The team was officially renamed Footwork in 1991, and secured a deal to race with Porsche V12 engines, but the car was woefully uncompetitive. The engine was overweight and underpowered and Porsche quickly pulled the plug. Footwork quickly switched to a Ford V8.

In 1992 the team switched to Mugen engines while Jenkins continued to design simple but effective cars on a limited budget. The season was the most competitive showing, with several points finishes gained, including a double points finish in Germany. Christian Fittipaldi was partnered with Gianni Morbidelli after impressive performances in testing, while the FA15 featured some innovative aerodynamics. Alan D. Harrison (longest serving member having been with JO &amp; AR since early Shadow F1) took over as Team Manager, after John Wickham. Morbidelli was Footwork&#x27;s most successful driver, and scored a podium in Australia in 1995, the final race in the Footwork era. Morbidelli enjoyed the experience, stating they were his favourite years in racing but conceded that money was tight. Oliver had retained control throughout the entire period, funding the team from his own pocket after Ohashi withdrew his support and taking on pay drivers due to lack of sponsorship.

==TWR Arrows==

After a failed attempt to buy Ligier, Tom Walkinshaw bought 51% of the team. In so doing he bought out Alan Rees&#x27; share in March 1996, and the team dropped the Footwork name (though the team was still listed as Footwork in the constructor standings that year). In taking over Arrows, he brought designer Frank Dernie and several others with him from Ligier and dropped Alan Jenkins, who joined the new Stewart outfit. Walkinshaw had a history of success in various motor sport categories, having won the World Sportscar Championship for Jaguar three times, several touring car championships and had been behind Michael Schumacher&#x27;s first world title. At the time, TWR was running the Holden Racing Team in Australia with great success. At home, Walkinshaw was operating the Volvo team in the British Touring Car Championship, and the Volvo and Arrows programmes were operated concurrently.

Walkinshaw had plans to turn Arrows into a world championship winning team. To that end in September he signed up World Champion Damon Hill and hired wealthy Brazilian Pedro Diniz to help pay for Hill&#x27;s salary. His TWR operation moved the outfit to Leafield and put a new technical team in place. John Judd prepared the Yamaha sourced engine, while Dernie made way for John Barnard who was hired as designer and technical chief. Under an exclusive deal, Bridgestone supplied tyres. The team nearly secured a maiden victory at the 1997 Hungarian Grand Prix, where Hill started in third position and passed Michael Schumacher to take first place. Hill led comfortably until with just two laps left, a rubber seal in the hydraulic system failed. Hill was overtaken on the last lap but he clung on to finish second.

As Hill left Arrows after 1997 season to race for Jordan, the team contracted Finnish driver Mika Salo to partner Diniz for the 1998 F1 season. The 1998 season marked a new era for Arrows, as the team decided to build its own engines after buying out Brian Hart&#x27;s preparation company. A V10 Arrows T2-F1 was made to power the cars for the team. It proved to be a difficult season, although both cars finished a respectable fourth and sixth at the eventful 1998 Monaco GP, and Diniz went on to score a single fifth-place finish at the wet Belgian race. Arrows ended up finishing seventh in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, with a total of six points. Barnard left the team after a dispute with Walkinshaw, with Mike Coughlan taking over as technical director. At this point Zakspeed tried to buy Walkinshaw&#x27;s shares in Arrows for around $40 million but terms could not be reached and the deal fell through.

At the start of the 1999 Formula One season Malik Ado Ibrahim bought a 25% shareholding in the team, and his T-Minus brand appeared on the cars for most of the year. However, he too could not provide sufficient funding. The idea behind the T-Minus brand was that companies and corporations would purchase the rights to use the name and they would be permitted to use the brand to promote their products. Malik stated that he had intentions to use the brand in conjunction with Lamborghini but a deal never pulled through. An Arrows employee at the time stated &#x27;The T-Minus brand has brought in absolutely no money over the year&#x27; and that &#x27;It was simply a dream in the Prince&#x27;s head and nothing materialised.&#x27; The year was a tough one. Money was tight and the car was a mild update of the 1998 model. A solitary point was scored all season. During 1999, Jackie Oliver sold his remaining shares, leaving Walkinshaw in complete control. A deal with equity company Morgan Grenfell who bought into Arrows kept the team afloat, but would have long term implications for TWR. The driver lineup also changed when the team brought in rookie Pedro de la Rosa and 1998 Tyrrell driver Toranosuke Takagi, who both brought much needed funds.

In the 2000 season, Jos Verstappen returned to Arrows with teammate Pedro de la Rosa, where he had driven in 1996 and his teammate then was Ricardo Rosset. The chassis was an Arrows A21 with a Supertec (rebadged Renault) engine, the in-house built units proving unsuccessful. The Supertec engine was not the most powerful, but was still very good, and had been developed further for the season. Allied to an excellent aerodynamic package and good rear end stability, it allowed the Arrows A21 to set the best straight line speeds consistently around the circuits. An influx of sponsorship from Orange helped to fund the team. Generally, both Verstappen and de la Rosa were competitive within a close midfield. During the 2000 season, the Arrows team took part in a thirteen-part TV series named &quot;Racing Arrows&quot;, which followed the team and drivers throughout the year. It was shown on British TV channel ITV in 2001 during late-night slots.

Supertec was bought out by Renault at the end of 2000, which could have caused the team to take on expensive customer engines for 2001. As a result, a switch to Asiatech (rebadged Peugeot) V10s in 2001 and the loss of a lot of staff including team manager Steve Nielsen and designer Eghbal Hamidy left the team significantly weaker in 2001 when Tom Walkinshaw decided to replace de la Rosa with F1 debutant Enrique Bernoldi. The team struggled through the season and Verstappen scored the team&#x27;s only point in Austria.

For 2002, Walkinshaw made a deal to use customer Jaguar-spec Cosworth V10 engines in order to help Jaguar become a competitive team and retained Bernoldi (with support from Red Bull) but dropped Verstappen in favour of Heinz-Harald Frentzen, who became available when Prost Grand Prix closed down. This caused Verstappen successfully to sue for breach of contract. That year also saw a costly payout to Pedro Diniz after unsuccessfully suing the Brazilian, who had taken his funding to Sauber for 1999. The team faced a third litigation from Frentzen, who was contracted on a race-by-race basis and who had not yet been paid. Mounting debts including money owed to Cosworth spelled the end. Allied to sponsorship problems, Arrows ran out of money in the mid-season and did not appear at all the races at the end of the year, their drivers deliberately failing to qualify for the French Grand Prix.

Negotiations were undertaken throughout the season with potential investors to buy into the team or buy it outright, such as Craig Pollock, who had just been ousted from BAR and twice made an offer for the team, and Dietrich Mateschitz.

The team went into liquidation at the end of the season, also forcing TWR to close. The FIA rejected Arrows&#x27; entry application for the 2003 season prior to start date in Australia.

In their chequered history, Arrows set the unenviable record of 382 races without a win, although they collected nine podium finishes (one under Footwork) including five second places.

==Final chapter of Arrows Grand Prix International==
All the Arrows A23 chassis and the full Arrows Grand Prix International intellectual property rights were bought by the Minardi team, including the initial concept and drawings of the Arrows A24. The Arrows A23 was renamed the Minardi PS04 and in back-to-back tests it was found superior to Minardi&#x27;s PS03. Minardi however decided that they could not run a &quot;pure-Arrows&quot; and hence use the Arrows intellectual property to take the best from the PS03, PS04 / Arrows A23 and Arrows A24 design concepts to develop the Minardi PS04B for the 2004 season. For following season the PS04B is developed into the PS05.

In 2005 the Arrows Grand Prix International bloodline continued through into Super Aguri when Paul Stoddart sold the combined Minardi and Arrows Grand Prix International intellectual property rights, as well as the Minardi PS05 cars to Red Bull and Aguri Suzuki respectively.

At the end of 2005, the newly formed Super Aguri F1 team took over the former Arrows base at Leafield in Oxfordshire and bought four unmodified Arrows A23&#x27;s from Minardi, all of the spare parts, as well as the Arrows Grand Prix International intellectual property rights. Many of the ex-Arrows staff were hired to engineer the team, including technical director Mark Preston. The 2002 Arrows A23&#x27;s were run (with minor modifications) as the Super Aguri SA05 during the first races of the 2006 season. An update of the 2002 Arrows chassis was designated the SA06 and made its debut at the 2006 German Grand Prix.

In late 2008 when Super Aguri folded, Formtech Composites purchased the intellectual property rights held by Super Aguri and took over the former Arrows base at Leafield. Today Formtech Composites engineer composite components for the automotive, motorsport, military and aerospace industries.

<text>John Charles Barrett (born October 28, 1953), known professionally as Desmond Child, is an American songwriter and producer. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2008. He has been nominated for four Grammy Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, and has won a Latin Grammy Award.

His hits as a songwriter include Kiss&#x27; &quot;I Was Made for Lovin&#x27; You&quot;; Joan Jett &amp; the Blackhearts&#x27; &quot;I Hate Myself for Loving You&quot;; Bon Jovi&#x27;s &quot;You Give Love a Bad Name&quot;, &quot;Livin&#x27; on a Prayer&quot;, &quot;Bad Medicine&quot;, and &quot;Born to Be My Baby&quot;; Aerosmith&#x27;s &quot;Dude (Looks Like a Lady)&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;What It Takes&quot; and &quot;Crazy&quot;; Cher&#x27;s &quot;We All Sleep Alone&quot; and &quot;Just Like Jesse James&quot;; Brit Smith&#x27;s &quot;Karma&#x27;s a Bitch&quot;, recently redone by Jojo Siwa; Alice Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Poison&quot;; Michael Bolton&#x27;s &quot;How Can We Be Lovers?&quot;; and Ricky Martin&#x27;s &quot;The Cup of Life&quot; and &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot;.

== Career ==
Child&#x27;s career started when he formed an R&amp;B-influenced pop rock band, Desmond Child &amp; Rouge in 1975 with singers Myriam Valle, Maria Vidal, and Diana Grasselli, backed by hired musicians. The band was known for their inclusion on the soundtrack to &quot;The Warriors&quot; in 1979, with the song &quot;Last of an Ancient Breed&quot;, and for the song &quot;Our Love is Insane&quot;, which charted at No. 51 in the Billboard Hot 100. Their two albums received positive reviews but sold poorly and the group disbanded in 1980. One member, Maria Vidal, had a hit in 1985 with &quot;Body Rock&quot;.

Child then worked with songwriter Bob Crewe for two years.

Artists Child has worked with include Kiss, Cher, Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, Bonnie Tyler, Dream Theater, Roxette, Ricky Martin, Selena Gomez, and Kelly Clarkson. Desmond is credited with discovering Troy Curtis Tuminelli and recommending him to Edgardo Diaz before Tuminelli landed in Menudo, and, eventually, on &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. He was the key partner in Alice Cooper&#x27;s album &quot;Trash&quot; (1989). He was also responsible for co-writing the Ratt album &quot;Detonator&quot; (1990).

Child scored a Billboard Top 40 hit in 1991 as a solo artist with &quot;Love on a Rooftop&quot;, a song he had co-written with Diane Warren, originally recorded by Ronnie Spector, and later by Cher. &quot;Love on a Rooftop&quot; also peaked at number 55 on the Australian ARIA Charts.

He produced Meat Loaf&#x27;s album &quot;Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose&quot;, and co-wrote six of its songs.

Child wrote the song &quot;Believe in Me&quot; for Bonnie Tyler in 2012 and one year later it was selected as the Eurovision Song Contest entry for the United Kingdom, where it finished in 19th place in the final. Following the contest, Tyler received two Eurovision Song Contest Radio Awards for Best Song and Best Singer, making her the first UK representative to win the award. Child was to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest again as a songwriter in 2022, co-writing and producing the Finnish entry, Jezebel, performed by the Rasmus. The song would go on to finish 21st in the final.

Child was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2008. In 2013, he co-founded the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame along with fellow Cuban-American composer Rudy Pérez. Desmond&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Livin&#x27; on a Prayer: Big Songs Big Life&quot; with David Ritz, was released September 19, 2023.

== Personal life ==
Child lives in Nashville, Tennessee with his husband, Curtis Shaw, and their twin sons. Child and Shaw&#x27;s struggle to have a baby via surrogacy is recounted in the documentary &quot;Two: The Story of Roman &amp; Nyro&quot;.

The track &quot;The Truth Comes Out&quot; from Desmond Child &amp; Rouge&#x27;s second album &quot;Runners in the Night&quot; (1979) was written about &#x27;coming out&#x27; to his girlfriend and Rouge bandmate, Maria Vidal.

The song &quot;A Ray of Hope&quot;, written by Don Paul Yowell, was recorded by Child as a tribute to Child&#x27;s younger brother, Joey (b. Joseph Stephen), who died in January 1991 of AIDS-related complications.

He is the biological son of Hungarian baron Joseph S. Marfy and Cuban songwriter Elena Casals. Child did not discover that Marfy was his biological father until he was 18 years old. Until that time, he had believed that his father was John Frederick Barrett, Casals&#x27; husband at the time of his birth, and for whom he was named. Through his Hungarian ancestry, Child received dual American-Hungarian citizenship in 2016. Child subsequently released &quot;The Steps of Champions&quot;, a song he wrote for the Hungarian government as the official anthem of the sixtieth anniversary commemorations of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. In 2016 he received Artisjus Lifetime Achievement Award.

<doc id="800010" wikidata="Q4060686" url="?curid=800010" title="Belief propagation">
<text>Belief propagation, also known as sum–product message passing, is a message-passing algorithm for performing inference on graphical models, such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields. It calculates the marginal distribution for each unobserved node (or variable), conditional on any observed nodes (or variables). Belief propagation is commonly used in artificial intelligence and information theory, and has demonstrated empirical success in numerous applications, including low-density parity-check codes, turbo codes, free energy approximation, and satisfiability.

The algorithm was first proposed by Judea Pearl in 1982, who formulated it as an exact inference algorithm on trees, later extended to polytrees. While the algorithm is not exact on general graphs, it has been shown to be a useful approximate algorithm.

== Motivation ==
Given a finite set of discrete random variables formula_1 with joint probability mass function formula_2, a common task is to compute the marginal distributions of the formula_3. The marginal of a single formula_3 is defined to be
:formula_5

where formula_6 is a vector of possible values for the formula_3, and the notation formula_8 means that the sum is taken over those formula_9 whose formula_10th coordinate is equal to formula_11.

Computing marginal distributions using this formula quickly becomes computationally prohibitive as the number of variables grows. For example, given 100 binary variables formula_12, computing a single marginal formula_3 using formula_2 and the above formula would involve summing over formula_15 possible values for formula_9. If it is known that the probability mass function formula_2 factors in a convenient way, belief propagation allows the marginals to be computed much more efficiently.

==Description of the sum-product algorithm==
Variants of the belief propagation algorithm exist for several types of graphical models (Bayesian networks and Markov random fields in particular). We describe here the variant that operates on a factor graph. A factor graph is a bipartite graph containing nodes corresponding to variables formula_18 and factors formula_19, with edges between variables and the factors in which they appear. We can write the joint mass function:

:formula_20

where formula_21 is the vector of neighboring variable nodes to the factor node formula_22. Any Bayesian network or Markov random field can be represented as a factor graph by using a factor for each node with its parents or a factor for each node with its neighborhood respectively.

The algorithm works by passing real valued functions called &quot;messages&quot; along the edges between the nodes. More precisely, if formula_23 is a variable node and formula_22 is a factor node connected to formula_23 in the factor graph, then the messages formula_26 from formula_23 to formula_22 and the messages formula_29 from formula_22 to formula_23 are real-valued functions formula_32, whose domain is the set of values that can be taken by the random variable associated with formula_23, denoted formula_34. These messages contain the &quot;influence&quot; that one variable exerts on another. The messages are computed differently depending on whether the node receiving the message is a variable node or a factor node. Keeping the same notation:
* A message formula_35 from a variable node formula_23 to a factor node formula_22 is defined by formula_38for formula_39, where formula_40 is the set of neighboring factor nodes of formula_23. If formula_42 is empty then formula_43 is set to the uniform distribution over formula_34.

* A message formula_45 from a factor node formula_22 to a variable node formula_23 is defined to be the product of the factor with messages from all other nodes, marginalized over all variables except the one associated with formula_23,formula_49for formula_39, where formula_51 is the set of neighboring (variable) nodes to formula_22. If formula_53 is empty, then formula_54, since in this case formula_55.
As shown by the previous formula: the complete marginalization is reduced to a sum of products of simpler terms than the ones appearing in the full joint distribution. This is the reason that belief propagation is sometimes called &quot;sum-product message passing&quot;, or the &quot;sum-product algorithm&quot;.

In a typical run, each message will be updated iteratively from the previous value of the neighboring messages. Different scheduling can be used for updating the messages. In the case where the graphical model is a tree, an optimal scheduling converges after computing each message exactly once (see next sub-section). When the factor graph has cycles, such an optimal scheduling does not exist, and a typical choice is to update all messages simultaneously at each iteration.

Upon convergence (if convergence happened), the estimated marginal distribution of each node is proportional to the product of all messages from adjoining factors (missing the normalization constant):

:formula_56

Likewise, the estimated joint marginal distribution of the set of variables belonging to one factor is proportional to the product of the factor and the messages from the variables:

:formula_57

In the case where the factor graph is acyclic (i.e. is a tree or a forest), these estimated marginal actually converge to the true marginals in a finite number of iterations. This can be shown by mathematical induction.

==Exact algorithm for trees==

In the case when the factor graph is a tree, the belief propagation algorithm will compute the exact marginals. Furthermore, with proper scheduling of the message updates, it will terminate after two full passes through the tree. This optimal scheduling can be described as follows:

Before starting, the graph is oriented by designating one node as the &quot;root&quot;; any non-root node which is connected to only one other node is called a &quot;leaf&quot;.

In the first step, messages are passed inwards: starting at the leaves, each node passes a message along the (unique) edge towards the root node. The tree structure guarantees that it is possible to obtain messages from all other adjoining nodes before passing the message on. This continues until the root has obtained messages from all of its adjoining nodes.

The second step involves passing the messages back out: starting at the root, messages are passed in the reverse direction. The algorithm is completed when all leaves have received their messages.

==Approximate algorithm for general graphs==

Although it was originally designed for acyclic graphical models, the Belief Propagation algorithm can be used in general graphs. The algorithm is then sometimes called loopy belief propagation, because graphs typically contain cycles, or loops. The initialization and scheduling of message updates must be adjusted slightly (compared with the previously described schedule for acyclic graphs) because graphs might not contain any leaves. Instead, one initializes all variable messages to 1 and uses the same message definitions above, updating all messages at every iteration (although messages coming from known leaves or tree-structured subgraphs may no longer need updating after sufficient iterations). It is easy to show that in a tree, the message definitions of this modified procedure will converge to the set of message definitions given above within a number of iterations equal to the diameter of the tree.

The precise conditions under which loopy belief propagation will converge are still not well understood; it is known that on graphs containing a single loop it converges in most cases, but the probabilities obtained might be incorrect. Several sufficient (but not necessary) conditions for convergence of loopy belief propagation to a unique fixed point exist. There exist graphs which will fail to converge, or which will oscillate between multiple states over repeated iterations. Techniques like EXIT charts can provide an approximate visualization of the progress of belief propagation and an approximate test for convergence.

There are other approximate methods for marginalization including variational methods and Monte Carlo methods.

One method of exact marginalization in general graphs is called the junction tree algorithm, which is simply belief propagation on a modified graph guaranteed to be a tree. The basic premise is to eliminate cycles by clustering them into single nodes.

==Related algorithm and complexity issues==
A similar algorithm is commonly referred to as the Viterbi algorithm, but also known as a special case of the max-product or min-sum algorithm, which solves the related problem of maximization, or most probable explanation. Instead of attempting to solve the marginal, the goal here is to find the values formula_58 that maximizes the global function (i.e. most probable values in a probabilistic setting), and it can be defined using the arg max:

:formula_59

An algorithm that solves this problem is nearly identical to belief propagation, with the sums replaced by maxima in the definitions.

It is worth noting that inference problems like marginalization and maximization are NP-hard to solve exactly and approximately (at least for relative error) in a graphical model. More precisely, the marginalization problem defined above is #P-complete and maximization is NP-complete.

The memory usage of belief propagation can be reduced through the use of the Island algorithm (at a small cost in time complexity).

==Relation to free energy==
The sum-product algorithm is related to the calculation of free energy in thermodynamics. Let &quot;Z&quot; be the partition function. A probability distribution

(as per the factor graph representation) can be viewed as a measure of the internal energy present in a system, computed as

:formula_61

The free energy of the system is then

:formula_62

It can then be shown that the points of convergence of the sum-product algorithm represent the points where the free energy in such a system is minimized. Similarly, it can be shown that a fixed point of the iterative belief propagation algorithm in graphs with cycles is a stationary point of a free energy approximation.

==Generalized belief propagation (GBP)==
Belief propagation algorithms are normally presented as message update equations on a factor graph, involving messages between variable nodes and their neighboring factor nodes and vice versa. Considering messages between &quot;regions&quot; in a graph is one way of generalizing the belief propagation algorithm. There are several ways of defining the set of regions in a graph that can exchange messages. One method uses ideas introduced by Kikuchi in the physics literature, and is known as Kikuchi&#x27;s cluster variation method.

Improvements in the performance of belief propagation algorithms are also achievable by breaking the replicas symmetry in the distributions of the fields (messages). This generalization leads to a new kind of algorithm called survey propagation (SP), which have proved to be very efficient in NP-complete problems like satisfiability
and graph coloring.

The cluster variational method and the survey propagation algorithms are two different improvements to belief propagation. The name generalized survey propagation (GSP) is waiting to be assigned to the algorithm that merges both generalizations.

==Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP)==
Gaussian belief propagation is a variant of the belief propagation algorithm when the underlying distributions are Gaussian. The first work analyzing this special model was the seminal work of Weiss and Freeman.

The GaBP algorithm solves the following marginalization problem:

:formula_63

where Z is a normalization constant, &quot;A&quot; is a symmetric positive definite matrix (inverse covariance matrix a.k.a. precision matrix) and &quot;b&quot; is the shift vector.

Equivalently, it can be shown that using the Gaussian model, the solution of the marginalization problem is equivalent to the MAP assignment problem:

: formula_64

This problem is also equivalent to the following minimization problem of the quadratic form:

: formula_65

Which is also equivalent to the linear system of equations

: formula_66

Convergence of the GaBP algorithm is easier to analyze (relatively to the general BP case) and there are two known sufficient convergence conditions. The first one was formulated by Weiss et al. in the year 2000, when the information matrix &quot;A&quot; is diagonally dominant. The second convergence condition was formulated by Johnson et al. in 2006, when the spectral radius of the matrix

:formula_67

where &quot;D&quot; = diag(&quot;A&quot;). Later, Su and Wu established the necessary and sufficient convergence conditions for synchronous GaBP and damped GaBP, as well as another sufficient convergence condition for asynchronous GaBP. For each case, the convergence condition involves verifying 1) a set (determined by A) being non-empty, 2) the spectral radius of a certain matrix being smaller than one, and 3) the singularity issue (when converting BP message into belief) does not occur.

The GaBP algorithm was linked to the linear algebra domain, and it was shown that the GaBP algorithm can be viewed as an iterative algorithm for solving the linear system of equations &quot;Ax&quot; = &quot;b&quot; where &quot;A&quot; is the information matrix and &quot;b&quot; is the shift vector. Empirically, the GaBP algorithm is shown to converge faster than classical iterative methods like the Jacobi method, the Gauss–Seidel method, successive over-relaxation, and others. Additionally, the GaBP algorithm is shown to be immune to numerical problems of the preconditioned conjugate gradient method

== Syndrome-based BP decoding ==
The previous description of BP algorithm is called the codeword-based decoding, which calculates the approximate marginal probability formula_68, given received codeword formula_69. There is an equivalent form, which calculate formula_70, where formula_71 is the syndrome of the received codeword formula_69 and formula_73 is the decoded error. The decoded input vector is formula_74. This variation only changes the interpretation of the mass function formula_75. Explicitly, the messages are

:formula_76
:where formula_77 is the prior error probability on variable formula_23formula_79

This syndrome-based decoder doesn&#x27;t require information on the received bits, thus can be adapted to quantum codes, where the only information is the measurement syndrome.

In the binary case, formula_80, those messages can be simplified to cause an exponential reduction of formula_81 in the complexity

Define log-likelihood ratio formula_82, formula_83, then

The posterior log-likelihood ratio can be estimated as formula_87

<text>Cyrus II of Persia ( ; 530 BC), commonly known as Cyrus the Great, was the founder of the Persian Achaemenid Empire. Hailing from Persis, he brought the Achaemenid dynasty to power by defeating the Median Empire and embracing all of the previous civilized states of the ancient Near East, expanding vastly and eventually conquering most of West Asia and much of Central Asia to create what would soon become the largest polity in human history at the time. The Achaemenid Empire&#x27;s largest territorial extent was achieved under Darius the Great, whose rule stretched from Southeast Europe in the west to the Indus River valley in the east.

After conquering the Median Empire, Cyrus led the Achaemenids to conquer Lydia and eventually the Neo-Babylonian Empire. He also led an expedition into Central Asia, which resulted in major military campaigns that were described as having brought &quot;into subjection every nation without exception&quot;; Cyrus allegedly died in battle with the Massagetae, a nomadic Eastern Iranian tribal confederation, along the Syr Darya in December 530 BC. However, Xenophon of Athens claimed that Cyrus did not die fighting and had instead returned to the city of Pasargadae, which served as the Achaemenid ceremonial capital. He was succeeded by his son Cambyses II, whose campaigns into North Africa led to the conquests of Egypt, Nubia, and Cyrenaica during his short rule.

To the Greeks, he was known as Cyrus the Elder ( ). Cyrus was particularly renowned among contemporary scholars because of his habitual policy of respecting peoples&#x27; customs and religions in the lands that he conquered. He was influential in developing the system of a central administration at Pasargadae to govern the Achaemenid Empire&#x27;s satraps, which worked for the profit of both rulers and subjects.

Following the Persian conquest of Babylon, Cyrus issued the Edict of Restoration, in which he authorized and encouraged the return of the Jewish people to what had been the Kingdom of Judah, officially ending the Babylonian captivity. He is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible and left a lasting legacy on Judaism due to his role in facilitating the return to Zion, a migratory event in which the Jews returned to the Land of Israel following Cyrus&#x27;s establishment of Yehud Medinata and subsequently rebuilt the Temple in Jerusalem, which had been destroyed by the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem. According to Isaiah 45:1, Cyrus was anointed by Yahweh for this task as a biblical messiah; he is the only non-Jewish figure to be revered in this capacity.

In addition to his influence on traditions in both the Eastern and Western worlds, Cyrus is also recognized for his achievements in human rights, politics, and military strategy. The Achaemenid Empire&#x27;s prestige in the ancient world would eventually extend as far west as Athens, where upper-class Greeks adopted aspects of the culture of the ruling Persian class as their own. As the founder of the Persian Achaemenid Empire, Cyrus played a crucial role in defining the national identity of the Iranian nation; the Achaemenid Empire was instrumental in spreading the ideals of Zoroastrianism as far east as China. He remains a cult figure in Iran, with the Tomb of Cyrus at Pasargadae serving as a spot of reverence for millions of the country&#x27;s citizens.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Cyrus&quot; is a Latinized form derived from the Greek-language name (&quot;Kỹros&quot;), which itself was derived from the Old Persian name &quot;Kūruš&quot;. The name and its meaning have been recorded within ancient inscriptions in different languages. The ancient Greek historians Ctesias and Plutarch stated that Cyrus was named from the Sun (&quot;Kuros&quot;), a concept which has been interpreted as meaning &quot;like the Sun&quot; (&quot;Khurvash&quot;) by noting its relation to the Persian noun for Sun, &quot;khor&quot;, while using &quot;-vash&quot; as a suffix of likeness. Karl Hoffmann has suggested a translation based on the meaning of an Indo-European root &quot;to humiliate&quot;, and accordingly, the name &quot;Cyrus&quot; means &quot;humiliator of the enemy in verbal contest&quot;. Another possible Iranian derivation would mean &quot;the young one, child&quot;, similar to Kurdish &quot;kur&quot; (&quot;son, little boy&quot;) or Ossetian &quot;i-gur-un&quot; (&quot;to be born&quot;) and &quot;kur&quot; (young bull). In the Persian language and especially in Iran, Cyrus&#x27;s name is spelled as (, ). In the Bible, he is referred to in the Hebrew language as &quot;Koresh&quot; (). Some pieces of evidence suggest that Cyrus is Kay Khosrow, a legendary Persian king of the Kayanian dynasty and a character in &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, a Persian epic.

Some scholars, however, believe that neither Cyrus nor Cambyses were Iranian names, proposing that Cyrus was Elamite in origin and that the name meant &quot;he who bestows care&quot; in the extinct Elamite language. One reason is that, while Elamite names may end in &quot;-uš&quot;, no Elamite texts spell the name this way – only &quot;Kuraš&quot;. Meanwhile, Old Persian did not allow names to end in &quot;-aš&quot;, so it would make sense for Persian speakers to change an original &quot;Kuraš&quot; into the more grammatically correct form &quot;Kuruš&quot;. Elamite scribes, on the other hand, would not have had a reason to change an original &quot;Kuraš&quot; into &quot;Kuruš&quot;, since both forms were acceptable. Therefore, &quot;Kuraš&quot; probably represents the original form. Another scholarly opinion is that &quot;Kuruš&quot; was a name of Indo-Aryan origin, in honour of the Indo-Aryan Kuru and Kamboja mercenaries from eastern Afghanistan and Northwest India that helped in the conquest of the Middle East.
==Dynastic history==


The Persian domination and kingdom in the Iranian plateau started as an extension of the Achaemenid dynasty, who expanded their earlier dominion possibly from the 9th century BC onward. The eponymous founder of the dynasty was Achaemenes (from Old Persian &quot;Haxāmaniš&quot;). Achaemenids are &quot;descendants of Achaemenes&quot;, as Darius the Great, the ninth king of the dynasty, traced his ancestry to him, declaring &quot;for this reason, we are called Achaemenids&quot;. Achaemenes built the state of Parsumash in the southwest of Iran and was succeeded by Teispes, who took the title &quot;King of Anshan&quot; after seizing the city Anshan and enlarging his kingdom further to include Pars proper. Ancient documents mention that Teispes had a son called Cyrus I, who also succeeded his father as &quot;king of Anshan&quot;. Cyrus I had a full brother whose name is recorded as Ariaramnes.

In 600 BC, Cyrus I was succeeded by his son, Cambyses I, who reigned until 559 BC. Cyrus II &quot;the Great&quot; was a son of Cambyses I, who had named his son after his father, Cyrus I. There are several inscriptions of Cyrus the Great and later kings that refer to Cambyses I as the &quot;great king&quot; and &quot;king of Anshan&quot;. Among these are some passages in the Cyrus cylinder where Cyrus calls himself &quot;son of Cambyses, great king, king of Anshan&quot;. Another inscription (from CM&#x27;s) mentions Cambyses I as a &quot;mighty king&quot; and &quot;an Achaemenian&quot;, which according to the bulk of scholarly opinion was engraved under Darius and considered as a later forgery by Darius. However, Cambyses II&#x27;s maternal grandfather Pharnaspes is named by historian Herodotus as &quot;an Achaemenian&quot;. Xenophon&#x27;s account in his Cyropædia names Cambyses&#x27;s wife as Mandane and mentions Cambyses as king of Iran (ancient Persia). These agree with Cyrus&#x27;s own inscriptions, as Anshan and Parsa were different names for the same land. These also agree with other non-Iranian accounts, except on one point from Herodotus which states that Cambyses was not a king but a &quot;Persian of good family&quot;. However, in some other passages, Herodotus&#x27;s account is wrong also on the name of the son of Chishpish, which he mentions as Cambyses but according to modern scholars, should be Cyrus I.

The traditional view based on archaeological research and the genealogy given in the Behistun Inscription and by Herodotus holds that Cyrus the Great was an Achaemenid. However, M. Waters has suggested that Cyrus is unrelated to the Achaemenids or Darius the Great, and that his family was of Teispid and Anshanite origin instead of Achaemenid.

==Early life==
Cyrus was born to Cambyses I, King of Anshan, and Mandane, daughter of Astyages, King of Media, during the period of 600–599 BC.

By his own account, generally believed now to be accurate, Cyrus was preceded as king by his father Cambyses I, grandfather Cyrus I, and great-grandfather Teispes. Cyrus married Cassandane who was an Achaemenian and the daughter of Pharnaspes who bore him two sons, Cambyses II and Bardiya along with three daughters, Atossa, Artystone, and Roxane. Cyrus and Cassandane were known to love each other very much – Cassandane said that she found it more bitter to leave Cyrus than to depart her life. After her death, Cyrus insisted on public mourning throughout the kingdom. The Nabonidus Chronicle states that Babylonia mourned Cassandane for six days (identified as 21–26 March 538 BC). After his father&#x27;s death, Cyrus inherited the Persian throne at Pasargadae, which was a vassal of Astyages. The Greek historian Strabo has said that Cyrus was originally named Agradates by his step-parents. It is possible that, when reuniting with his original family, following the naming customs, Cyrus&#x27;s father, Cambyses I, named him Cyrus after his grandfather, who was Cyrus I. There is also an account by Strabo that claimed Agradates adopted the name Cyrus after the Cyrus river near Pasargadae.

===Mythology===


Herodotus gave a mythological account of Cyrus&#x27;s early life. In this account, Astyages had two prophetic dreams in which a flood, and then a series of fruit-bearing vines, emerged from his daughter Mandane&#x27;s pelvis, and covered the entire kingdom. These were interpreted by his advisers as a foretelling that his grandson would one day rebel and supplant him as king. Astyages summoned Mandane, at the time pregnant with Cyrus, back to Ecbatana to have the child killed. His general Harpagus delegated the task to Mithradates, one of the shepherds of Astyages, who raised the child and passed off his stillborn son to Harpagus as the dead infant Cyrus. Cyrus lived in secrecy, but when he reached the age of 10, during a childhood game, he had the son of a nobleman beaten when he refused to obey Cyrus&#x27;s commands. As it was unheard of for the son of a shepherd to commit such an act, Astyages had the boy brought to his court, and interviewed him and his adoptive father. Upon the shepherd&#x27;s confession, Astyages sent Cyrus back to Persia to live with his biological parents. However, Astyages summoned the son of Harpagus, and in retribution, chopped him to pieces, roasted some portions while boiling others, and tricked his adviser into eating his child during a large banquet. Following the meal, Astyages&#x27;s servants brought Harpagus the head, hands and feet of his son on platters, so he could realize his inadvertent cannibalism.

==Rise and military campaigns==
===Median Empire===
Cyrus the Great succeeded to the throne in 559 BC following his father&#x27;s death; however, Cyrus was not yet an independent ruler. Like his predecessors, Cyrus had to recognize Median overlordship. Astyages, last king of the Median Empire and Cyrus&#x27;s grandfather, may have ruled over the majority of the Ancient Near East, from the Lydian frontier in the west to the lands of the Parthians and Persians in the east.
According to the Nabonidus Chronicle, Astyages launched an attack against Cyrus, &quot;king of Ansan&quot;. According to the historian Herodotus, it is known that Astyages placed Harpagus in command of the Median army to conquer Cyrus. However, Harpagus contacted Cyrus and encouraged his revolt against Media, before eventually defecting along with several of the nobility and a portion of the army. This mutiny is confirmed by the Nabonidus Chronicle. The Chronicle suggests that the hostilities lasted for at least three years (553–550 BC), and the final battle resulted in the capture of Ecbatana. This was described in the paragraph that preceded the entry for Nabonidus&#x27;s year 7, which detailed Cyrus&#x27;s victory and the capture of his grandfather. According to the historians Herodotus and Ctesias, Cyrus spared the life of Astyages and married his daughter, Amytis. This marriage pacified several vassals, including the Bactrians, Parthians, and Saka. Herodotus notes that Cyrus also subdued and incorporated Sogdia into the empire during his military campaigns of 546–539 BC.

With Astyages out of power, all of his vassals (including many of Cyrus&#x27;s relatives) were now under his command. His uncle Arsames, who had been the king of the city-state of Parsa under the Medes, therefore would have had to give up his throne. However, this transfer of power within the family seems to have been smooth, and it is likely that Arsames was still the nominal governor of Parsa under Cyrus&#x27;s authority—more a Prince or a Grand Duke than a King. His son, Hystaspes, who was also Cyrus&#x27;s second cousin, was then made satrap of Parthia and Phrygia. Cyrus the Great thus united the twin Achaemenid kingdoms of Parsa and Anshan into Persia proper. Arsames lived to see his grandson become Darius the Great, Shahanshah of Persia, after the deaths of both of Cyrus&#x27;s sons. Cyrus&#x27;s conquest of Media was merely the start of his wars.

===Lydian Empire and Asia Minor===


The exact dates of the Lydian conquest are unknown, but it must have taken place between Cyrus&#x27;s overthrow of the Median kingdom (550 BC) and his conquest of Babylon (539 BC). It was common in the past to give 547 BC as the year of the conquest due to some interpretations of the Nabonidus Chronicle, but this position is currently not much held. The Lydians first attacked the Achaemenid Empire&#x27;s city of Pteria in Cappadocia. The king of Lydia Croesus besieged and captured the city enslaving its inhabitants. Meanwhile, the Persians invited the citizens of Ionia who were part of the Lydian kingdom to revolt against their ruler. The offer was rebuffed, and thus Cyrus levied an army and marched against the Lydians, increasing his numbers while passing through nations in his way. The Battle of Pteria was effectively a stalemate, with both sides suffering heavy casualties by nightfall. Croesus retreated to Sardis the following morning.

While in Sardis, Croesus sent out requests for his allies to send aid to Lydia. However, near the end of the winter, before the allies could unite, Cyrus the Great pushed the war into Lydian territory and besieged Croesus in his capital, Sardis. Shortly before the final Battle of Thymbra between the two rulers, Harpagus advised Cyrus the Great to place his dromedaries in front of his warriors; the Lydian horses, not used to the dromedaries&#x27; smell, would be very afraid. The strategy worked; the Lydian cavalry was routed. Cyrus defeated and captured Croesus. Cyrus occupied the capital at Sardis, conquering the Lydian kingdom in 546 BC. According to Herodotus, Cyrus the Great spared Croesus&#x27;s life and kept him as an advisor, but this account conflicts with some translations of the contemporary Nabonidus Chronicle which interpret that the king of Lydia was slain.

Before returning to the capital, Commagene was incorporated into Persia in 546 BC. Later, a Lydian named Pactyas was entrusted by Cyrus the Great to send Croesus&#x27;s treasury to Persia. However, soon after Cyrus&#x27;s departure, Pactyas hired mercenaries and caused an uprising in Sardis, revolting against the Persian satrap of Lydia, Tabalus. Cyrus sent Mazares, one of his commanders, to subdue the insurrection but demanded that Pactyas be returned alive. Upon Mazares&#x27;s arrival, Pactyas fled to Ionia, where he had hired more mercenaries. Mazares marched his troops into the Greek country and subdued the cities of Magnesia and Priene. The fate of Pactyas is unknown, but after capture, he was probably sent to Cyrus and put to death after being tortured.

Mazares continued the conquest of Asia Minor but died of unknown causes during his campaign in Ionia. Cyrus sent Harpagus to complete Mazares&#x27;s conquest of Asia Minor. Harpagus captured Lycia, Aeolia and Caria, using the technique of building earthworks to breach the walls of besieged cities, a method unknown to the Greeks. He ended his conquest of the area in 542 BC and returned to Persia.

===Eastern Campaigns===
After the conquest of Lydia, Cyrus campaigned in the east between around 545 BC to 540 BC. Cyrus first tried to conquer Gedrosia, however he was decisively defeated and departed Gedrosia. Gedrosia was most likely conquered during the reign of Darius I. After the failed attempt to conquer Gedrosia, Cyrus attacked the regions of Bactria, Arachosia, Sogdia, Saka, Chorasmia, Margiana and other provinces in the east. In 533 BC, Cyrus the Great crossed the Hindu Kush mountains and collected tribute from the Indus cities. Thus, Cyrus probably had established vassal states in western India. Cyrus then returned with his army to Babylon due to the unrest taking place in and around Babylon.

===Neo-Babylonian Empire===
By the year 540 BC, Cyrus captured Elam and its capital, Susa. The Nabonidus Chronicle records that, prior to the battle(s), the king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, Nabonidus, had ordered cult statues from outlying Babylonian cities to be brought into the capital, suggesting that the conflict had begun possibly in the winter of 540 BC. Just before October 539 BC, Cyrus fought the Battle of Opis in or near the strategic riverside city of Opis on the Tigris, north of Babylon. The Babylonian army was routed, and on 10 October, Sippar was seized without a battle, with little to no resistance from the populace. It is probable that Cyrus engaged in negotiations with the Babylonian generals to obtain a compromise on their part and therefore avoid an armed confrontation. Nabonidus, who had retreated to Sippar following his defeat at Opis, fled to Borsippa.


Around 12 October, Persian general Gubaru&#x27;s troops entered Babylon, again without any resistance from the Babylonian armies, and detained Nabonidus. Herodotus explains that to accomplish this feat, the Persians, using a basin dug earlier by the Babylonian queen Nitokris to protect Babylon against Median attacks, diverted the Euphrates river into a canal so that the water level dropped &quot;to the height of the middle of a man&#x27;s thigh&quot;, which allowed the invading forces to march directly through the river bed to enter at night. Shortly thereafter, Nabonidus returned from Borsippa and surrendered to Cyrus. On 29 October, Cyrus entered the city of Babylon.

Prior to Cyrus&#x27;s invasion of Babylon, the Neo-Babylonian Empire had conquered many kingdoms. In addition to Babylonia, Cyrus probably incorporated its sub-national entities into his Empire, including Syria, Judea, and Arabia Petraea, although there is no direct evidence to support this assumption.

After taking Babylon, Cyrus the Great proclaimed himself &quot;king of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad, king of the four corners of the world&quot; in the famous Cyrus Cylinder, an inscription on a cylinder that was deposited in the foundations of the Esagila temple dedicated to the chief Babylonian god, Marduk. The text of the cylinder denounces Nabonidus as impious and portrays the victorious Cyrus as pleasing the god Marduk. It describes how Cyrus had improved the lives of the citizens of Babylonia, repatriated displaced peoples, and restored temples and cult sanctuaries. Although some have asserted that the cylinder represents a form of human rights charter, historians generally portray it in the context of a long-standing Mesopotamian tradition of new rulers beginning their reigns with declarations of reforms.

Cyrus the Great&#x27;s dominions composed the largest empire the world had ever seen to that point. At the end of Cyrus&#x27;s rule, the Achaemenid Empire stretched from Asia Minor in the west to the Indus River in the east.

==Death==
The details of Cyrus&#x27;s death vary by account. Ctesias, in his &quot;Persica&quot;, has the longest account, which says Cyrus met his death while putting down resistance from the Derbices infantry, aided by other Scythian archers and cavalry, plus Indians and their war-elephants. According to him, this event took place northeast of the headwaters of the Syr Darya.
The account of Herodotus from his &quot;Histories&quot; provides the second-longest detail, in which Cyrus met his fate in a fierce battle with the Massagetae, a Scythian tribal confederation from the southern deserts of Khwarezm and Kyzyl Kum in the southernmost portion of the Eurasian Steppe regions of modern-day Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, following the advice of Croesus to attack them in their own territory. The Massagetae were related to the Scythians in their dress and mode of living; they fought on horseback and on foot. In order to acquire her realm, Cyrus first sent an offer of marriage to their ruler, the empress Tomyris, a proposal she rejected.

He then commenced his attempt to take Massagetae territory by force (c. 529 BC), beginning by building bridges and towered war boats along his side of the river Oxus, or Amu Darya, which separated them. Sending him a warning to cease his encroachment (a warning which she stated she expected he would disregard anyway), Tomyris challenged him to meet her forces in honorable warfare, inviting him to a location in her country a day&#x27;s march from the river, where their two armies would formally engage each other. He accepted her offer, but, learning that the Massagetae were unfamiliar with wine and its intoxicating effects, he set up and then left camp with plenty of it behind, taking his best soldiers with him and leaving the least capable ones.

The general of Tomyris&#x27;s army, Spargapises, who was also her son, and a third of the Massagetian troops, killed the group Cyrus had left there and, finding the camp well stocked with food and the wine, unwittingly drank themselves into inebriation, diminishing their capability to defend themselves when they were then overtaken by a surprise attack. They were successfully defeated, and, although he was taken prisoner, Spargapises committed suicide once he regained sobriety. Upon learning of what had transpired, Tomyris denounced Cyrus&#x27;s tactics as underhanded and swore vengeance, leading a second wave of troops into battle herself. Cyrus the Great was ultimately killed, and his forces suffered massive casualties in what Herodotus referred to as the fiercest battle of his career and the ancient world. When it was over, Tomyris ordered the body of Cyrus brought to her, then decapitated him and dipped his head in a vessel of blood in a symbolic gesture of revenge for his bloodlust and the death of her son. However, some scholars question this version, mostly because even Herodotus admits this event was one of many versions of Cyrus&#x27;s death that he heard from a supposedly reliable source who told him no one was there to see the aftermath.

Herodotus also recounts that Cyrus saw in his sleep the oldest son of Hystaspes (Darius I) with wings upon his shoulders, shadowing with the one wing Asia, and with the other wing Europe. Archaeologist Sir Max Mallowan explains this statement by Herodotus and its connection with the four winged bas-relief figure of Cyrus the Great in the following way:

Muhammad Dandamayev says that Persians may have taken Cyrus&#x27;s body back from the Massagetae, unlike what Herodotus claimed.

According to the Chronicle of Michael the Syrian (AD 1166–1199) Cyrus was killed by his wife Tomyris, queen of the Massagetae (Maksata), in the 60th year of Jewish captivity.

An alternative account from Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Cyropaedia&quot; contradicts the others, claiming that Cyrus died peacefully at his capital. The final version of Cyrus&#x27;s death comes from Berossus, who only reports that Cyrus met his death while warring against the Dahae archers northwest of the headwaters of the Syr Darya.

===Burial===


Cyrus the Great&#x27;s remains may have been interred in his capital city of Pasargadae, where today a limestone tomb (built around 540–530 BC) still exists, which many believe to be his. Strabo and Arrian give nearly identical descriptions of the tomb, based on the eyewitness report of Aristobulus of Cassandreia, who at the request of Alexander the Great visited the tomb twice. Though the city itself is now in ruins, the burial place of Cyrus the Great has remained largely intact, and the tomb has been partially restored to counter its natural deterioration over the centuries. According to Plutarch, his epitaph read:

Cuneiform evidence from Babylon proves that Cyrus died around December 530 BC, and that his son Cambyses II had become king. Cambyses continued his father&#x27;s policy of expansion, and captured Egypt for the Empire, but soon died after only seven years of rule. He was succeeded either by Cyrus&#x27;s other son Bardiya or an impostor posing as Bardiya, who became the sole ruler of Persia for seven months, until he was killed by Darius the Great.

The translated ancient Roman and Greek accounts give a vivid description of the tomb both geometrically and aesthetically; the tomb&#x27;s geometric shape has changed little over the years, still maintaining a large stone of quadrangular form at the base, followed by a pyramidal succession of smaller rectangular stones, until after a few slabs, the structure is curtailed by an edifice, with an arched roof composed of a pyramidal shaped stone, and a small opening or window on the side, where the slenderest man could barely squeeze through.

Within this edifice was a golden coffin, resting on a table with golden supports, inside of which the body of Cyrus the Great was interred. Upon his resting place, was a covering of tapestry and drapes made from the best available Babylonian materials, utilizing fine Median worksmanship; below his bed was a fine red carpet, covering the narrow rectangular area of his tomb. Translated Greek accounts describe the tomb as having been placed in the fertile Pasargadae gardens, surrounded by trees and ornamental shrubs, with a group of Achaemenian protectors called the &quot;Magi&quot;, stationed nearby to protect the edifice from theft or damage.

Years later, in the chaos created by Alexander the Great&#x27;s invasion of Persia and after the defeat of Darius III, Cyrus the Great&#x27;s tomb was broken into and most of its luxuries were looted. When Alexander reached the tomb, he was horrified by the manner in which the tomb was treated, and questioned the Magi and put them to court. On some accounts, Alexander&#x27;s decision to put the Magi on trial was more about his attempt to undermine their influence and his show of power in his newly conquered empire, than a concern for Cyrus&#x27;s tomb. However, Alexander admired Cyrus, from an early age reading Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Cyropaedia&quot;, which described Cyrus&#x27;s heroism in battle and governance as a king and legislator. Regardless, Alexander the Great ordered Aristobulus to improve the tomb&#x27;s condition and restore its interior. Despite his admiration for Cyrus the Great, and his attempts at renovation of his tomb, Alexander had, six years previously (330 BC), sacked Persepolis, the opulent city that Cyrus may have chosen the site for, and either ordered its burning as an act of pro-Greek propaganda or set it on fire during drunken revels.

The edifice has survived the test of time, through invasions, internal divisions, successive empires, regime changes, and revolutions. The last prominent Persian figure to bring attention to the tomb was Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (Shah of Iran) the last official monarch of Persia, during his celebrations of 2,500 years of monarchy. Just as Alexander the Great before him, the Shah of Iran wanted to appeal to Cyrus&#x27;s legacy to legitimize his own rule by extension. The United Nations recognizes the tomb of Cyrus the Great and Pasargadae as a UNESCO World Heritage site.

==Legacy==
British historian Charles Freeman suggests that &quot;In scope and extent his achievements [Cyrus] ranked far above that of the Macedonian king, Alexander, who was to demolish the [Achaemenid] empire in the 320s but fail to provide any stable alternative.&quot; Cyrus has been a personal hero to many people, including Thomas Jefferson, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and David Ben-Gurion.

The achievements of Cyrus the Great throughout antiquity are reflected in the way he is remembered today. His own nation, the Iranians, have regarded him as &quot;The Father&quot;, the very title that had been used during the time of Cyrus himself, by the many nations that he conquered, as according to Xenophon:

The historian Plutarch () tells that &quot;the Persians, because Cyrus was hook-nosed, even to this day love hook-nosed men and consider them the most handsome&quot;.

The Babylonians regarded him as &quot;The Liberator&quot;, as they were offended by their previous ruler, Nabonidus, for committing sacrilege.

The Book of Ezra narrates a story of the first return of exiles in the first year of Cyrus, in which Cyrus proclaims: &quot;All the kingdoms of the earth hath the LORD, the God of heaven, given me; and He hath charged me to build Him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.&quot;()

Cyrus was distinguished equally as a statesman and as a soldier. Due in part to the political infrastructure he created, the Achaemenid Empire endured long after his death.

The rise of Persia under Cyrus&#x27;s rule had a profound impact on the course of world history, including in forms of Iranian philosophy, literature and religion.

Many of the Iranian dynasties following the Achaemenid Empire and their kings saw themselves as the heirs to Cyrus the Great and have claimed to continue the line begun by Cyrus. However, there are different opinions among scholars whether this is also the case for the Sassanid Dynasty.

Alexander the Great was himself infatuated with and admired Cyrus the Great, from an early age reading Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Cyropaedia&quot;, which described Cyrus&#x27;s heroism in battle and governance and his abilities as a king and a legislator. During his visit to Pasargadae he ordered Aristobulus to decorate the interior of the sepulchral chamber of Cyrus&#x27;s tomb.

Cyrus&#x27;s legacy has been felt even as far away as Iceland and colonial America. Many of the thinkers and rulers of Classical Antiquity as well as the Renaissance and Enlightenment era, and the forefathers of the United States of America sought inspiration from Cyrus the Great through works such as &quot;Cyropaedia&quot;. Thomas Jefferson, for example, owned two copies of &quot;Cyropaedia&quot;, one with parallel Greek and Latin translations on facing pages showing substantial Jefferson markings that signify the amount of influence the book has had on drafting the United States Declaration of Independence.
According to Professor Richard Nelson Frye, Cyrus—whose abilities as conqueror and administrator Frye says are attested by the longevity and vigor of the Achaemenid Empire—held an almost mythic role among the Persian people &quot;similar to that of Romulus and Remus in Rome or Moses for the Israelites&quot;, with a story that &quot;follows in many details the stories of hero and conquerors from elsewhere in the ancient world.&quot; Frye writes, &quot;He became the epitome of the great qualities expected of a ruler in antiquity, and he assumed heroic features as a conqueror who was tolerant and magnanimous as well as brave and daring. His personality as seen by the Greeks influenced them and Alexander the Great, and, as the tradition was transmitted by the Romans, may be considered to influence our thinking even now.&quot;

His rule was studied and admired by many of the great leaders, such as Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar and Thomas Jefferson.

===Religion and philosophy===


Pierre Briant wrote that given the poor information we have, &quot;it seems quite reckless to try to reconstruct what the religion of Cyrus might have been.&quot; It is also debated whether he was a practitioner of Zoroastrianism or whether Zoroastrianism only becomes involved with the imperial religion of the Achaemenid empire after him. The evidence in favor of it comes from some of the names of members of Cyrus&#x27;s family, and similarities between the description of Cyrus in Isaiah 40–48 and the Gathas. Against the thesis is how Cyrus treated local polytheistic cults, acknowledging their gods and providing funding for the establishment of their temples and other holy sites, as well as a possible late-date for the activity of the Iranian prophet Zoroaster, who founded Zoroastrianism.

The policies of Cyrus with respect to treatment of minority religions are documented in many historical accounts, particularly Babylonian texts and Jewish sources. Cyrus had a general policy of religious tolerance throughout his vast empire. Whether this was a new policy or the continuation of policies followed by the Babylonians and Assyrians (as Lester Grabbe maintains) is disputed. He brought peace to the Babylonians and is said to have kept his army away from the temples and restored the statues of the Babylonian gods to their sanctuaries.

Information about religion and ritual during the reign of Cyrus is also available from the Cyropaedia of Xenophon, the Histories of Herodotus, and inscriptions, though these were written in later periods and so must be used carefully.

The Cyrus Cylinder was composed in the name of Cyrus with him as the first-person speaker. The Cylinder is highly religious and is framed around the interventions of the god Marduk. It is Marduk who is praised in the outset of the text, whose direct intervention is thought to be responsible for what happened in recent history, and it is Marduk who summons Cyrus for the purpose of righting the wrongs of his predecessor, Nabonidus. Furthermore, Cyrus offers respect not only to the cult of Marduk but also to local cults. One inscription from Uruk states &quot;(Cyrus) loves Esangil and Ezida&quot;, while another from Ur mentons that he &quot;returned the gods to their shrines&quot;. Another from Babylon or Sippar says that unlike Nabonidus, Cyrus provided proper and even increased the sacrifices for the gods. Additional reliable information may come from the funerary customs around the tomb of Cyrus which indicates a privileged cult honoring Mithra. Some have also identified the figure depicted in the bas-relief from Pasargadae as Mithra, further indicating the reverence of Cyrus for this deity. Additional evidence further indicates the connection between Cyrus and Mithra.

==== Jewish texts ====
The treatment of the Jews by Cyrus during their exile in Babylon after Nebuchadnezzar II destroyed Jerusalem is reported in the Bible. Cyrus is represented positively and as an agent of Yahweh, even though he is said to &quot;not know&quot; Yahweh (Isaiah 45:4–5).

The Hebrew Bible&#x27;s Ketuvim ends in Second Chronicles with the decree of Cyrus, which returned the exiles to the Promised Land from Babylon along with a commission to rebuild the temple.

Thus saith Cyrus, king of Persia: All the kingdoms of the earth hath the , the God of heaven given me; and He hath charged me to build Him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whosoever there is among you of all His people – the , his God, be with him – let him go there. – ()

This edict is also fully reproduced in the Book of Ezra.

In the first year of King Cyrus, Cyrus the king issued a decree: &quot;Concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, let the temple, the place where sacrifices are offered, be rebuilt and let its foundations be retained, its height being 60 cubits and its width 60 cubits; with three layers of huge stones and one layer of timbers. And let the cost be paid from the royal treasury. Also let the gold and silver utensils of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be returned and brought to their places in the temple in Jerusalem; and you shall put them in the house of God.&quot; – ()

The Jews honored him as a dignified and righteous king. In one Biblical passage, Isaiah refers to him as Messiah (lit. &quot;His anointed one&quot;) (), making him the only gentile to be so referred. Elsewhere in Isaiah, God is described as saying, &quot;I will raise up Cyrus in my righteousness: I will make all his ways straight. He will rebuild my city and set my exiles free, but not for a price or reward, says God Almighty.&quot; () As the text suggests, Cyrus did ultimately release the nation of Israel from its exile without compensation or tribute. These particular passages (Isaiah 40–55, often referred to as &quot;Deutero-Isaiah&quot;) are believed by most modern critical scholars to have been added by another author toward the end of the Babylonian exile 

Josephus, the first-century Jewish historian, relates the traditional view of the Jews regarding the prediction of Cyrus in Isaiah in his Antiquities of the Jews, book 11, chapter 1:


While Cyrus is praised in the Tanakh ( and ), there was Jewish criticism of him after he was lied to by the Cuthites, who wanted to halt the building of the Second Temple. They accused the Jews of conspiring to rebel, so Cyrus in turn stopped the construction, which would not be completed until 515 BC, during the reign of Darius I.
According to the Bible, it was King Artaxerxes who was convinced to stop the construction of the temple in Jerusalem. (Ezra 4:7–24)

The historical nature of this decree has been challenged. Professor Lester L Grabbe argues that there was no decree but that there was a policy that allowed exiles to return to their homelands and rebuild their temples. He also argues that the archaeology suggests that the return was a &quot;trickle&quot;, taking place over perhaps decades, resulting in a maximum population of perhaps 30,000. Philip R. Davies called the authenticity of the decree &quot;dubious&quot;, citing Grabbe and adding that arguing against &quot;the authenticity of Ezra 1.1–4 is J. Briend, in a paper given at the Institut Catholique de Paris on 15 December 1993, who denies that it resembles the form of an official document but reflects rather biblical prophetic idiom.&quot;
Mary Joan Winn Leith believes that the decree in Ezra might be authentic and along with the Cylinder that Cyrus, like earlier rulers, was through these decrees trying to gain support from those who might be strategically important, particularly those close to Egypt which he wished to conquer. She also wrote that &quot;appeals to Marduk in the cylinder and to Yahweh in the biblical decree demonstrate the Persian tendency to co-opt local religious and political traditions in the interest of imperial control.&quot;

Some modern Muslims have suggested that the Quranic figure of Dhu al-Qarnayn is a representation of Cyrus the Great, but the scholarly consensus is that he is a development of legends concerning Alexander the Great.

===Politics and management===
Cyrus founded the empire as a multi-state empire governed by four capital states; Pasargadae, Babylon, Susa and Ecbatana. He allowed a certain amount of regional autonomy in each state, in the form of a satrapy system. A satrapy was an administrative unit, usually organized on a geographical basis. A &#x27;satrap&#x27; (governor) was the vassal king, who administered the region, a &#x27;general&#x27; supervised military recruitment and ensured order, and a &#x27;state secretary&#x27; kept the official records. The general and the state secretary reported directly to the satrap as well as the central government.

During his reign, Cyrus maintained control over a vast region of conquered kingdoms, achieved through retaining and expanding the satrapies. Further organization of newly conquered territories into provinces ruled by satraps was continued by Cyrus&#x27;s successor, Darius the Great. Cyrus&#x27;s empire was based on tribute and conscripts from the many parts of his realm.

Through his military savvy, Cyrus created an organized army including the Immortals unit, consisting of 10,000 highly trained soldiers. He also formed an innovative postal system throughout the empire, based on several relay stations called Chapar Khaneh.

Cyrus&#x27;s conquests began a new era in the age of empire building, where a vast superstate, comprising many dozens of countries, races, religions, and languages, were ruled under a single administration headed by a central government. This system lasted for centuries, and was retained both by the invading Seleucid dynasty during their control of Persia, and later Iranian dynasties including the Parthians and Sasanians.

Cyrus has been known for his innovations in building projects; he further developed the technologies that he found in the conquered cultures and applied them in building the palaces of Pasargadae. He was also famous for his love of gardens; the recent excavations in his capital city has revealed the existence of the Pasargadae Persian Garden and a network of irrigation canals. Pasargadae was a place for two magnificent palaces surrounded by a majestic royal park and vast formal gardens; among them was the four-quartered wall gardens of &quot;Paradisia&quot; with over 1000 meters of channels made out of carved limestone, designed to fill small basins at every 16 meters and water various types of wild and domestic flora. The design and concept of Paradisia were exceptional and have been used as a model for many ancient and modern parks, ever since.

The English physician and philosopher Sir Thomas Browne penned a discourse entitled The Garden of Cyrus in 1658 in which Cyrus is depicted as an archetypal wise ruler – while the Protectorate of Cromwell ruled Britain. However, despite being featured in the title, Cyrus was not a main focus of Browne&#x27;s work.

&quot;Cyrus the elder, brought up in Woods and Mountains, when time and power enabled, pursued the dictate of his education, and brought the treasures of the field into rule and circum-scription. So nobly beautifying the hanging Gardens of Babylon, that he was also thought to be the authour thereof.&quot;

Cyrus&#x27;s standard, described as a golden eagle mounted upon a &quot;lofty shaft&quot;, remained the official banner of the Achaemenids.

===Cyrus Cylinder===


One of the few surviving sources of information that can be dated directly to Cyrus&#x27;s time is the Cyrus Cylinder (), a document in the form of a clay cylinder inscribed in Akkadian cuneiform. It had been placed in the foundations of the Esagila (the temple of Marduk in Babylon) as a foundation deposit following the Persian conquest in 539 BC. It was discovered in 1879 and is kept today in the British Museum in London.

The text of the cylinder denounces the deposed Babylonian king Nabonidus as impious and portrays Cyrus as pleasing to the chief god Marduk. It describes how Cyrus had improved the lives of the citizens of Babylonia, repatriated displaced peoples and restored temples and cult sanctuaries. Although not mentioned specifically in the text, the repatriation of the Jews from their &quot;Babylonian captivity&quot; has been interpreted as part of this general policy.

In the 1970s, the Shah of Iran adopted the Cyrus cylinder as a political symbol, using it &quot;as a central image in his celebration of 2500 years of Iranian monarchy&quot;, and asserting that it was &quot;the first human rights charter in history&quot;. This view has been disputed by some as &quot;rather anachronistic&quot; and tendentious, as the modern concept of human rights would have been quite alien to Cyrus&#x27;s contemporaries and is not mentioned by the cylinder. The cylinder has, nonetheless, become seen as part of Iran&#x27;s cultural identity.

The United Nations has declared the relic to be an &quot;ancient declaration of human rights&quot; since 1971, approved by then Secretary General Sithu U Thant, after he &quot;was given a replica by the sister of the Shah of Iran&quot;. The British Museum describes the cylinder as &quot;an instrument of ancient Mesopotamian propaganda&quot; that &quot;reflects a long tradition in Mesopotamia where, from as early as the third millennium BC, kings began their reigns with declarations of reforms.&quot; The cylinder emphasizes Cyrus&#x27;s continuity with previous Babylonian rulers, asserting his virtue as a traditional Babylonian king while denigrating his predecessor.

Neil MacGregor, Director of the British Museum, has stated that the cylinder was &quot;the first attempt we know about running a society, a state with different nationalities and faiths – a new kind of statecraft.&quot; He explained that &quot;It has even been described as the first declaration of human rights, and while this was never the intention of the document – the modern concept of human rights scarcely existed in the ancient world – it has come to embody the hopes and aspirations of many.&quot;

===Currency denomination===


The use of the name &quot;Kuruş&quot; as a currency denomination for coinage goes back to the 6th century BC, dating to the time of the Croeseid, the world&#x27;s first gold coin, originally minted by King Croesus of Lydia. The Croeseid was later continued to be minted and spread in a wide geographical area by Cyrus the Great ( ), the founder of the Achaemenid Empire, who defeated King Croesus and conquered Lydia with the Battle of Thymbra in 547 BC. Cyrus (Kūruš) made the Croeseid the standard gold coin of his vast empire, using the same &quot;lion and bull&quot; design, but with a reduced weight (8.06 grams, instead of the standard 10.7 grams of the original version issued by King Croesus) due to the need for larger amounts of these coins, for a much larger population.

== Titles ==

His regal titles in full were The Great King, King of Persia, King of Anshan, King of Media, King of Babylon, King of Sumer and Akkad, and King of the Four Corners of the World. The Nabonidus Chronicle notes the change in his title from &quot;King of Anshan&quot; to &quot;King of Persia&quot;. Assyriologist François Vallat wrote that &quot;When Astyages marched against Cyrus, Cyrus is called &#x27;King of Anshan&quot;, but when Cyrus crosses the Tigris on his way to Lydia, he is &#x27;King of Persia.&#x27; The coup therefore took place between these two events.&quot;

<text>Johann Theodor Kaspar Rudolph Ambros Alois Xaver Ab Yberg or more compactly Theodor Ab Yberg (8 December 1795, Schwyz - 30 November 1869) was a Swiss statesman.

Theodor is the son of alderman Alois Xaver Ab Yberg and his wife Maria Anna von Reding. He served in the Swiss Guard in Paris, but returned home in 1823. After having been member of the cantonal court, he was elected alderman in 1826. In 1830 he became governour of the Schwyz district and as well the canton. 

In a dispute between the outer districts of Schwyz who demanded equal rights under the Constitution and the &quot;old lands&quot;, he fervently vindicated the supremacy of the latter. Thereby he gained the esteem of his fellow countrymen. When the council decided to occupy Küssnacht in the then existing district &quot;Schwyz outer lands&quot; in August 1833, Ab Yberg was the leading commander of the troops. The assault failed though, as did a simultaneous from Basel, and he forfeited his military rank of colonel.

As a result of the attack on Küssnacht, the canton Schwyz was occupied by the confederate Swiss army. On 11 October 1833 it was reunited with the outer Schwyz under equal rights in the constitution. On 3 November, Ab Yberg was reelected head of the district council, in 1834, 1838, 1842 and 1846 head of the canton (&quot;Landammann&quot;).

On 26 September 1847 he was elected main commandant of the Schwyz troops. With the fall of the &quot;Sonderbund&quot;, a special alliance between seven Swiss cantons, he disappeared from the political scene. In 1852 he was once more elected into the cantonal council, but could not keep up with the political changes and retired soon thereafter and went to exile in Austria.

<text>Chatto &amp; Windus is an imprint of Penguin Random House that was formerly an independent book publishing company founded in London in 1855 by John Camden Hotten. Following Hotten&#x27;s death, the firm would reorganize under the names of his business partner Andrew Chatto and poet William Edward Windus. The company was purchased by Random House in 1987 and is now a sub-imprint of Vintage Books within the Penguin UK division.

==History==
The firm developed out of the publishing business of John Camden Hotten, founded in 1855. After his death in 1873, it was sold to Hotten&#x27;s junior partner Andrew Chatto (1841–1913), who took on the poet William Edward Windus (1827–1910), son of the patron of J. M. W. Turner, Benjamin Godfrey Windus (1790–1867), as partner. Chatto &amp; Windus published Mark Twain, W. S. Gilbert, Wilkie Collins, H. G. Wells, Wyndham Lewis, Richard Aldington, Frederick Rolfe (as Fr. Rolfe), Aldous Huxley, Samuel Beckett, the &quot;unfinished&quot; novel &quot;Weir of Hermiston&quot; (1896) by Robert Louis Stevenson, and the first translation into English of Marcel Proust&#x27;s novel &quot;À la recherche du temps perdu&quot; (&quot;Remembrance of Things Past&quot;, C. K. Scott-Moncrieff, 1922), among others.

In 1946, the company took over the running of the Hogarth Press, founded in 1917 by Leonard and Virginia Woolf. Active as an independent publishing house until 1969, when it merged with Jonathan Cape, it published broadly in the field of literature, including novels and poetry. It is not connected, except in the loosest historical fashion, with Pickering &amp; Chatto Publishers.

Chatto &amp; Windus became a limited company in 1953. Norah Smallwood was appointed to the board, and later succeeded Ian Parsons as chairman and managing director in 1975, serving until her retirement in 1982.

Chatto, along with Jonathan Cape and Virago Press were purchased by Penguin Random House in 1987. As of 2019, Chatto &amp; Windus is an imprint of Vintage Publishing UK.

The club takes its name from the region of Twente, the eastern part of Overijssel.

== History ==
=== Foundation and early years ===
The club was formed in 1965 as a merger of two professional clubs, Sportclub Enschede and the Enschedese Boys. One of such predecessors, SC Enschede, had also won a single Dutch championship in 1926.

The first successes of the club started just after the merger of 1965, under the innovative coach Kees Rijvers. Twente finished third in 1969, fourth in 1970, fifth in 1971, third in 1972 and again in 1973. The team&#x27;s key figures were local heroes, such as Epi Drost, Eddy Achterberg, Kick van der Vall and Theo Pahlplatz. Their finest Eredivisie season was 1973–74, in which Twente battled for the Dutch championship with Feyenoord. A head-to-head confrontation in the final game of the season, in Rotterdam, where Feyenoord prevailed 3–2, sealed Twente&#x27;s fate in second. Nonetheless, this earned the side a position in the UEFA Cup.

The &quot;Tukkers,&quot; as FC Twente fans are known, made the most of their UEFA Cup appearance in 1974–75, making it all the way to the final, where they lost 0–0 on aggregate (1–5 on away goals) to German side Borussia Mönchengladbach. They also eliminated the likes of Juventus en route to the final.

In 1977, Twente won their first trophy, the KNVB Cup, after beating PEC Zwolle 3–0.

=== The 1980s and 1990s ===
After enjoying some success in the 1970s, prospects went downhill for Twente, with the club ultimately suffering relegation to the Eerste Divisie, the Dutch second division, in 1983. However, Twente returned to the top flight a year later, but the club soon became known for their &quot;impressive&quot; amount of 1–1 and 0–0 draws. Although the club&#x27;s &quot;boring&quot; reputation seemed to stick, Twente continued to achieve European qualification on a regular basis, qualifying for Europe five times between 1985 and 2009.

Re-establishment then followed in the 1990s: German coach Hans Meyer led Twente to third-place in the Eredivisie of 1997 and into the third round of the 1997–98 UEFA Cup the next season. On 24 May 2001, Twente clinched their second triumph in the KNVB Cup after beating PSV in the final after being 3–1 down in the penalty shoot-out. The season after, Twente crashed out of the Cup at the hands of Ajax&#x27;s second team. Additionally, results in the league were poor, with hardcore Twente fans &quot;Ultras Vak-P&quot; eventually going on a rampage at the club&#x27;s brand-new stadium, De Grolsch Veste, out of frustration.

=== From bankruptcy to national champions (2002–2011) ===

The club&#x27;s mother corporation (FC Twente &#x27;65) was declared bankrupt in the 2002–03 season, almost leading to the club&#x27;s going out of existence. Despite the club&#x27;s financial troubles, it continued to enjoy success, reaching the 2004 KNVB Cup final, and finishing fourth in the 2006-07 Eredivisie season under the stewardship of chairman Joop Munsterman. In the 2007–08 season, Twente placed fourth and won the play-offs for a ticket to the Champions League qualifiers by defeating Ajax in the play-off finals.

In the 2008–09 season, Twente hired former England manager Steve McClaren as its new head coach. Under his tenure, unseeded Twente entered the draw for the third qualifying round of the Champions League, being drawn against seeded Arsenal. The two legs were played at home on 13 August and away on 27 August 2008. Twente lost 6–0 on aggregate, resulting in their elimination from the Champions League and subsequent entry of the 2008–09 UEFA Cup first round. At the domestic level, Twente finished second in the Eredivisie, 11 points behind champions AZ, and again secured entry to the Champions League qualifying rounds as Dutch runners-up, as well as KNVB Cup finalists (defeated by Heerenveen).

The 2009–10 season started with Twente being knocked out of the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League third qualifying round after a 1–1 aggregate draw against Sporting CP, which sent the Portuguese side through on away goals. The club was then admitted to the Europa League, where it enjoyed a relatively successful path that ended in a 4–2 aggregate defeat at the hands of Werder Bremen in the round of 32. At the domestic level, Twente won its first Eredivisie title at the end of a campaign in which they lost just twice, winning 16 of 17 at home. The championship was confirmed on the final day of the season when they beat NAC 2–0 away, making Steve McClaren the first Englishman to guide a Dutch team to a national title since Bobby Robson in 1992. The victory qualified Twente for the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League group stage, the club&#x27;s first appearance in the competition. At the end of the season, McClaren resigned as the manager, moving to German side VfL Wolfsburg, and was replaced by the Belgian Michel Preud&#x27;homme. Twente continued their success by having a good run during the 2010–11 KNVB Cup, reaching the final on 8 May 2011 at De Kuip. Twente recovered from down to defeat Ajax 3–2 in extra time with a winner from Marc Janko, which claimed the club&#x27;s third KNVB Cup title. One week later, the two teams faced each other in Amsterdam in the final round of matches in the Eredivisie, with Twente leading by a point. However, Ajax gained revenge for the Cup defeat by winning 3–1, to claim their first title in seven years.

The start of the 2011–12 season, under Preud&#x27;homme&#x27;s successor Co Adriaanse, featured another clash between the duo in the Amsterdam Arena, this time with Twente winning 2–1 in their second successive Johan Cruijff Shield supercup victory.

===Financial problems and relegation (2014–2019)===
During the 2014–15 Eredivisie season, Twente found themselves in financial trouble again, forcing the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB) to deduct the club three points from the side in March 2015. Club President Munsterman, who had announced to leave the club at the end of the season, then already quit the club on 1 April 2015 over allegations of financial mismanagement. The team fired 18 employees and stopped with their scouting department after they received a second three-point penalty in April 2015. They also decided to withdraw Jong Twente from the Eerste Divisie for the 2015–16 season and the women&#x27;s professional team was relocated in a separate foundation. On 18 May 2016, the KNVB declared its intent to relegate FC Twente to the Eerste Divisie. This was however still subject to appeal by FC Twente and on 17 June 2016, the KNVB appeal committee decided that Twente can remain in the Eredivisie. At the end of the 2017–18 Eredivisie season, Twente relegated to the Eerste Divisie by finishing at the bottom of the table at the end of the season, after having fired two managers that season. The 2018–19 Eerste Divisie season was the first outside of the top flight for 34 years. Commercial director Jan van Halst felt partly responsible and then stepped down.

===Back to Europe===
In the Eerste Divisie, Twente had a season marked by ups and downs. From December 2018, however, through a 15-game stretch, not a single loss was recorded, giving the club a big lead over the competition. On 22 April 2019, the title and promotion were secured. Twente drew 0–0 at home against Jong AZ, but because the last remaining competitor Sparta Rotterdam lost, Twente could no longer be reached.

Despite Pušić&#x27;s success in earning Twente promotion, he was let go and replaced by his assistant Gonzalo García, who was put in charge of the club for their return to the Eredivisie. After a strong start, a 3–2 home defeat to archrivals Heracles Almelo was the start of a lesser period. Twente dropped to the bottom regions of the Eredivisie and after an impressive victory over AZ, three more defeats followed. However, after a 1–0 defeat against Vitesse, the Eredivisie season was abandoned due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands. As a result, Twente finished the 2019–20 season in fourteenth place, safe of relegation.

At the beginning of the 2020–21 season, García was also dismissed to be succeeded by the experienced Ron Jans. At the same time, Jan Streuer became technical director as a replacement for the Ted van Leeuwen who had resigned. Streuer brought in players such as Queensy Menig and Václav Černý, who would both become key players in the following season. After an excellent first half of the season, the results in the second half of the season were disappointing. Twente missed play-offs for European football and finished in tenth place. As a result of this season, Streuer wanted to bring more experienced players to the club, and signed Robin Pröpper and Ricky van Wolfswinkel. In addition, youth players were increasingly integrated in the first team with Mees Hilgers, Ramiz Zerrouki and Daan Rots becoming starters. Jody Lukoki was also signed, but he was seriously injured shortly after his arrival, which meant that he never played a match for Twente. Lukoki&#x27;s contract was terminated on 17 February 2022 after being convicted of domestic violence. Three months later, on 9 May 2022, Lukoki died of cardiac arrest after being beaten by family members.

After a strong season, Twente finished in fourth place in the league table and qualified for the third qualifying round of the 2022–23 UEFA Europa Conference League; their first return to Europe in eight years.

== Stadium ==

De Grolsch Veste, formerly named Arke Stadion, is the official stadium of FC Twente and is owned by the club. It is located at the Business &amp; Science Park, near the University of Twente and between the city centers of Enschede and Hengelo. It has a spectator capacity of 30,205 with a standard pitch heating system and has a promenade instead of fences around the stands.
De Grolsch Veste replaced the old Diekman Stadion as Twente&#x27;s home ground on 22 March 1998. Initially, plans had been afoot to expand and renovate the old and now demolished Diekman stadium. However, with a growing fan capacity and with arguments that the location of the Diekman stadium was not strategic enough, the idea was conceived to build a new arena for the Twente fans. The Diekman ground also faced problems with its seating plans as a result of the FIFA regulations, which impose a requirement to construct a seating stand behind each goal.

The new stadium, De Grolsch Veste, cost an estimated 33 million guilders and took 14 months to build, with construction starting on 31 January 1997. Due to the tight budget available, the layout of the stadium was constructed so that future expansions are possible without the necessity to tear down entire existing stands.

On 10 May 1998, the first match played at the stadium resulted in a 3–0 victory by the home team against PSV in an Eredivisie match.

Initially, the Grolsch Veste had a capacity of 13,500 spectators, which was later reduced to 13,250. As of the start of the 2008–09 season, the stadium has been expanded with a partial second ring increasing the capacity to 24,000 seats. After a second expansion, completed in 2011, the current capacity became 30,205.

The recording of &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; by Gerry and the Pacemakers is sung along in the whole stadium before every kick-off.

On 7 July 2011, a section of the stadium roof collapsed whilst expansion work was taking place at the stadium, killing two people.

<doc id="800035" wikidata="Q1377922" url="?curid=800035" title="Vincent Drucci">
<text>Vincent Drucci (born Ludovico D&#x27;Ambrosio; January 1, 1898 – April 4, 1927), also known as &quot;The Schemer&quot;, was an American mobster during Chicago&#x27;s Prohibition era who was a member of the North Side Gang, Al Capone&#x27;s best known rivals. A friend of Dean O&#x27;Banion, Drucci succeeded him by becoming co-leader. He is the only American organized crime boss to have been killed by a policeman.

==Early years==
Drucci was born Ludovico D&#x27;Ambrosio in Chicago, Illinois, on January 1, 1898, to Italian parents from northern Italy. After serving in the U.S. Navy, he returned to Chicago and started committing small-time crimes such as breaking open pay telephone coin boxes. He joined Dean O&#x27;Banion&#x27;s North Side Gang, which had taken over the formerly legal breweries and distilleries in that part of the city giving them massive profits from illicit production of alcohol, in addition to shakedowns and other rackets. Often described as mainly Irish-American, after O&#x27;Banion&#x27;s death the North Side Gang was successively headed by Hymie Weiss, Drucci and Bugs Moran who were respectively of Polish, Italian and French descent, while the most influential members who never became leader were Louis Alterie, of Spanish parentage, Samuel Morton who was from a Jewish background, and the German Albert Kachellek.

Though a leading member of the relatively small gang, Drucci acted as enforcer and was actively involved in numerous violent incidents; on one occasion when ambushed in the street by gunmen with a Capone trademark driveby, he charged at the assailants and tried to give chase in a hijacked car.

Laurence Bergreen, in his book, &quot;Capone: The Man and the Era&quot;, describes Drucci:

==&quot;The Schemer&quot;==
He was known by the nickname &quot;The Schemer&quot;, in part because of his penchant for inebriated rumination about outlandish plans; in reality he operated by intimidation in activities such as extortion of money from legitimate businesses. One female shop owner who refused to pay was beaten up by a husky woman as Drucci looked on. Drucci, whose practical jokes including making salacious comments to couples on the street while dressed as a priest, performed in a 1923 pornographic film called &quot;Bob&#x27;s Hot Story&quot;.

Drucci was believed to have been responsible for a November 30, 1926 incident at a Chicago North Side garage. In what the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; described as a &quot;serio-comedy&quot;, Drucci, along with North Side Gang members Bugs Moran, Frank Gusenberg, and Pete Gusenberg, are alleged to have entered the garage where two Chicago police officers were securing fifty cases of seized beer. Claiming to be a federal agent, Drucci ordered the others to handcuff the officers and confiscate their guns, showing no interest in the seized beer, and left with the officers still handcuffed. The incident humiliated the Chicago police department, which was already more sympathetic to the North Sider&#x27;s rivals the Capone organization.

==Conflict with South Side==
The North Siders found themselves undercut on the price of alcohol by rivals the Genna crime family, which was allied to the Italian American South side gang led by Johnny Torrio, who had pretensions of citywide overlordship. O&#x27;Banion at first tried to get Torrio to rein in the Gennas. When Torrio failed to do so, O&#x27;Banion started hijacking the Gennas&#x27; shipments. The Gennas wanted to kill O&#x27;Banion but Sicilian politician Mike Merlo, head of the Chicago chapter of Unione Siciliana and an underworld power broker due to his political influence, vetoed the killing. On November 10, 1924, days after Merlo had died of an illness, Torrio men John Scalise and Albert Anselmi arrived at O&#x27;Banion&#x27;s Chicago flower shop ostensibly arranging floral tributes for Merlo&#x27;s funeral, and murdered O&#x27;Banion. The North Side gang then moved against the Gennas and the South Side gang in retaliation. As a result of O&#x27;Banion&#x27;s death the leadership fell to Hymie Weiss, who initiated a string of retaliatory attacks on the Gennas and Torrio.

On January 25, 1925, Drucci, Weiss, and Moran ambushed Torrio&#x27;s bodyguard-lieutenant, Al Capone, shooting up his car, but failing to kill him; his bodyguard was then kidnapped, tortured and murdered. On January 27, Drucci and the two other North Siders ambushed Torrio while he was shopping with his wife. While severely wounded, Torrio survived the attack. At one point, police brought Drucci and Weiss to Torrio&#x27;s hospital bedside, but Torrio refused to identify them as the shooters. After his recovery and a short jail term, Torrio relinquished control of the South Side Gang to Capone and returned to Italy.

On May 25, Drucci, Weiss, and Moran killed South Side ally Angelo Genna. On July 8, Drucci and a second gunman murdered Tony Genna. On November 13, they murdered Genna gunman Samuzzo Amatuna in a barber shop. The owner of his favorite restaurant was also kidnapped and murdered, and Capone began referring to Drucci as the &quot;bedbug&quot;.

==Gang warfare==
On August 10, 1926, Drucci and Weiss were ambushed by Capone gunmen on a Chicago street and shot their way out. Five days later, Drucci and Weiss exchanged shots with Capone&#x27;s men in a re-run assassination attempt at the same location. The North Side Gang responded with an even more high-profile assassination attempt, using a ploy to lure Capone to the front of the Cicero, Illinois hotel in which he lived, and then firing hundreds of rounds through the windows. Capone was shaken, but unhurt. On October 11, Capone&#x27;s men killed Weiss outside the Holy Name Cathedral as he walked from his car to the gang&#x27;s headquarters. Drucci and Moran now assumed leadership of the North Side Gang. After Weiss&#x27; shooting, Drucci and Moran attended a peace conference with all the Chicago gangs, including the South Siders. Although Moran wanted to keep fighting, Drucci persuaded him to accept a ceasefire.

In 1927 William Hale Thompson at the head of his powerful Cook County machine that included strong support among African American districts, attempted to return as mayor. Thompson&#x27;s campaign statements were interpreted as an indication that if he won the city would have a relaxed attitude to law enforcement, and he was seen as Capone&#x27;s man. There were complex interactions between the political and ethnic aspects of the rivalries. Irish American politicians attempted to paint Thompson as an anti-Catholic Anglo Saxon chauvinist, despite his Capone-influenced Italian first ward support. However, Thompson&#x27;s perceived beholdenness to African American voters also led to shifting of allegiance among voters, which partially nullified his political machine. Capone resorted to an escalation of violence to ensure the political contest would be decided in Thompson&#x27;s favour. A citywide gang war erupted at the prospect of Capone getting a mayor inimical to all his rivals. On April 3, 1927, Drucci decided to take the offensive by ransacking the office of Dever-supporting alderman Dorsey Crowe. The Chicago Police Department Chief then ordered his men to arrest all North Side gang members on sight.

==Death==
On April 4, 1927, Chicago police arrested Drucci and found a concealed .45 pistol. One of the arresting officers was Detective Dan Healy, who had shot an armed robber dead a few months earlier. Exploits such as a near-fatal beating of Capone rival, Joseph Saltis, during a November 1926 saloon raid, had gained Healy a reputation for apoplectic violence against criminals, though not always in the line of duty.

Drucci objected to being held by the arm while waiting for the car that would take him and two associates arrested at the same time to the courthouse, where Drucci&#x27;s lawyer was waiting to post bail. He insulted Healy, who responded with a slap, then drew and brandished his gun and threatened to shoot Drucci. In the car the argument continued. One account is that the policemen who had been present during the incident supported Healy&#x27;s version of events: that Drucci, while announcing his intention, had lunged for Healy&#x27;s gun, but Healy had drawn back then shot Drucci. Drucci&#x27;s two associates gave a different account, asserting that a scuffle started after Healy punched Drucci, causing the driver to halt the car at the roadside, whereupon Healy had got out on the running board before drawing and firing at Drucci, who was shot while sitting in the car, handcuffed, with his hands in his lap. Hit in the arm, leg, and abdomen, Drucci collapsed, dying on the floor of the car.

==Aftermath==
He received a lavish funeral at Mount Carmel Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois, that was typical gangland fashion at the time. Drucci&#x27;s silver casket cost $10,000 and more than $30,000 in flowers adorned the funeral rooms. Healy and the other policemen&#x27;s version of the death was accepted by the authorities. Drucci&#x27;s estate amounted to $500,000.

Capone continued to back Thompson, and on the polling day of April 10, 1928, in the so-called Pineapple Primary, voting booths in the wards known to oppose Thompson were targeted by Capone&#x27;s bomber, James Belcastro, causing the deaths of 15 people. Belcastro also was accused of the murder of a black candidate in the election who had been chased by cars of gunmen through the streets on polling day before being shot dead; four police officers were accused along with Belcastro. An indication of the attitude of local law enforcement to Capone&#x27;s organization came in 1931 when Belcastro was shot in an attempt on his life; police suggested to skeptical journalists that Belcastro was an independent operator. The North Side gang was finished as a force in the underworld by the 1929 Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day massacre. However, the massacre led to public disquiet about Thompson&#x27;s alliance with Capone, a factor in Anton J. Cermak winning the mayoral election on April 6, 1931. A remnant of the North Side persisted alongside the similarly weak Roger Touhy, but got eliminated during Capone&#x27;s push back against the allies of Cermak.

<doc id="800042" wikidata="Q2296453" url="?curid=800042" title="Connor (Angel)">
<text>Connor is a fictional character created by Joss Whedon and Tim Minear for the television series &quot;Angel&quot;. The character is portrayed as an infant by the triplets Connor, Jake, and Trenton Tupen and as a teenager by Vincent Kartheiser. Connor has a recurring role in season 3, becomes a regular in season 4, and has his last television appearance in the series finale as a guest star. He continues his story in the canonical comic book series &quot;&quot;.

Connor is the superhuman son of the title character Angel, who is a vampire. Introduced in the third season as a newborn, Connor is kidnapped and taken to a hell dimension in an act of revenge against his father. He returns as a battle-hardened, disturbed teenager who has been raised to hate Angel. His consequent violent and estranged relationship with his father and increasing internal conflict make him shift alliances between protagonists and antagonists forms the storyline for his character. Towards the end of season 4, events take their toll on Connor&#x27;s sanity, and his memories are rewritten to give him a normal life. The next time he appears in season 5, Connor is a well-adjusted person. At the return of his memories, Connor finally reconciles with Angel in the series finale. The comic book series follows Connor accepting his abilities and role of a hero in addition to maintaining a normal life as a college student.

Created to give Angel a paternal bond, the infant Connor was used to develop other characters. After he grows up, he initially becomes a tragic figure and foil for the protagonists before eventually evolving into a protagonist himself. Connor has received attention in academic texts related to family studies and masculinity in fiction. The character proved to be controversial among fans, while critics have given mixed views.

In a seemingly impossible event, vampires Angel and Darla had a child, the end result being Connor, a human-like offspring of vampires. Connor is introduced in the episode &quot;Lullaby&quot;, when Darla sacrifices herself to give birth to him, by staking herself in the heart. Darla&#x27;s sacrifice for their son allows Angel to make peace with her, and welcomes Connor into his life with hope for their family&#x27;s future, especially since Angel is prophesied that he eventually become human again and thus one day a normal life as a father. For the first few months of his life, Connor is jointly raised by Angel and his team, including Wesley and Cordelia, though he is constantly targeted by different factions. Connor is prophesied to destroy the time-shifting demon lord Sahjhan. In attempt to negate the prophecy, he travels through time and rewrites the prophecy to read &quot;The father will kill the son&quot; in reference to Angel and Connor, and recruits Angelus&#x27;s nemesis Daniel Holtz whose family the vampire killed centuries ago with Darla. Wesley kidnaps the baby in a misguided effort to save his life from Angel, conveniently leading him into the hands of Holtz. Holtz steals the baby and is forced to escape to the hell dimension &quot;Quor&#x27;Toth: Darkest of the dark world&quot;.

Holtz raises Connor as his son and instills him with a deep hatred of Angel, although revealed later that he also occasionally abuses Connor when training him out of his hatred towards Connor&#x27;s parents. As time runs more quickly in Quor&#x27;Toth, Connor ages at an accelerated rate in relation to time on Earth. Surviving the hell, a teenage Connor returns with the goal of avenging the Holtz family by killing Angel. After failing in his first attempt on Angel&#x27;s life, Connor tentatively begins to reconcile with him. Fearful of the development, Holtz has himself killed by Justine Cooper in a manner that frames Angel for the action. In the finale &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, an enraged Connor seals Angel in a metal box and sinks him to the bottom of the ocean.

====Season 4====

The opening episode &quot;Deep Down&quot; picks up three months after last season. Angel returns, and Holtz&#x27; deception is revealed. Relations are shaky as Angel kicks Connor out of the house in punishment for sinking him, but secretly keeps a protective eye on him from afar. Stricken by the betrayal of his adoptive father and the apparent abandonment by his real one, Connor seeks solace in Cordelia&#x27;s arms. When an all-powerful demon lord The Beast rises from the ground at the place he was born, Connor feels responsible. As The Beast causes fire to rain from the sky in an apparent apocalypse, Cordelia sleeps with Connor to give him some happiness before the end. While an apocalypse does not occur, Angel (also in love with Cordelia) doesn&#x27;t take kindly to the development, causing another rift between him and Connor. Unbeknownst to all, Cordelia is possessed to be with Connor by a cosmic entity, Jasmine, looking to give herself birth in this world through their union. As Cordelia becomes pregnant and manipulates Connor into helping her sacrifice an innocent girl for their child, his inhuman actions begin conflicting with his inner good, accelerating his already deteriorating mental health.

Jasmine arrives as a grown woman and immediately bewitches everyone to bask in immense joy and do her bidding. Connor is the only one left in misery because of sharing a blood link with her, which results in his further isolation. As Jasmine enacts her plans for world domination, Angel and his team break free from her spell. Caught between his father and daughter, Connor initially supports Jasmine against Angel, but this conflict, combined with the belief that neither truly cares about him, eventually makes him completely snap. Connor kills Jasmine after Angel manages to break her hold over the city but fails to kill her. An emotional wreck and attempting suicide, Connor wires himself, a comatose Cordelia, and shop full of innocent people to explosives. The season finale (&quot;Home&quot;) shows Angel desperate to save his son. Angel agrees to take over Wolfram &amp; Hart in exchange for Connor&#x27;s life. As per the agreement, Connor is to have a whole new existence as an ordinary boy who is raised in a happy family. Other than Angel, everyone&#x27;s memories are rewritten to accommodate this new reality.

====Season 5====

A few months after the events of season 4, episode &quot;Origin&quot; shows Connor as the son of Laurence and Colleen Reilly. Connor crosses paths with Angel when the demon warlock Cyvus Vail draws him out to make him fulfill his destiny of killing Sahjhan. Angel informs Connor of his special abilities and helps prepare him for the fight, but he does not reveal that he is Connor&#x27;s real father. As the duel with Sahjhan begins, Connor is outmatched due to having forgotten his formidable fighting skills. Meanwhile, Wesley discovers Angel&#x27;s deception of altering reality. Distrusting Angel, Wesley shatters the Orlon Window, which restores Connor&#x27;s, Wesley&#x27;s, and Illyria&#x27;s memories. Remembering his old self and discovering that Sahjhan is directly responsible for all the pain he has endured, Connor slips to his original persona of &#x27;demon-killer&#x27; and dispatches Sahjhan with ease.

In &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; the finale of the series, Angel visits Connor for coffee on the eve of his final battle with the Circle of the Black Thorn. Connor reveals that he remembers that Angel is his father. He tells Angel he is grateful for all he has done for him, but he prefers to leave it at that. When Angel fights Marcus Hamilton, Connor shows up to fight by his father&#x27;s side (knowing that Angel wouldn&#x27;t do something so innocuous unless the world were about to end), saving Angel from being staked by Hamilton and helping him gain the upper hand. As the Senior Partners begin to exact their vengeance, Angel tells Connor to go home to his foster parents and assures him that as long as Connor is safe, the Partners can never destroy Angel.

===Comics===
The comic series &quot;&quot; picks up immediately after the events of the television series. Connor is shown sprinting home as ordered by Angel. He debates going back but gets drawn into the battle when the whole city is sent to hell by the Senior Partners. A veteran of hell, Connor takes it upon himself to provide sanctuary to humans and good demons. Along to help him are the benevolent werewolf Nina Ash, the mutant Gwen Raiden, and the vampire Spike. Connor also becomes much closer to Angel as he joins his newest battle to wrestle back control of the city from Demon Lords. Part of the story centers on Connor and Gwen&#x27;s romance, which ends when he discovers Gwen has betrayed the team.

Following the event, Gunn reverts Illyria to her demonic form, after which, Illyria decides to wholly collapse time and all existence. In an attempt to prevent Angel and his team from stopping Illyria, Gunn mortally wounds Connor. Connor pleads with Angel not to let the Senior Partners win and assures him that he is a good person despite being a vampire. Connor then dies in Angel&#x27;s arms. He is restored to life when Angel provokes Gunn into killing him, forcing the Senior Partners to turn back time to the moment of the original alleyway fight in the television finale. All those who died in the time since the city was sent to hell come back to life, and all who experienced that time retain their memories.

&quot;&quot;, a companion piece to &quot;Angel: After the Fall&quot;, shows how Connor came to form his alliance with Spike shortly after Los Angeles went to hell. Connor appears when Spike and Illyria are in a violent showdown with a group of demonic women. Catching the demon leader off-guard, he rescues the last human hostage and then has to be rescued by Spike. On their second encounter, the two strike up a connection immediately, leading to their joint crusade of saving the remaining humans. Connor is set to appear in the arcs of &quot;Angel and Faith&quot;.

Connor appears in the Family Reunion arc of &quot;Angel &amp; Faith.&quot; Willow, on a quest to restore magic to herself and the world asks Angel and Faith to travel from London to LA with her so she can use the residual magic in Buffy&#x27;s scythe and Connor&#x27;s connection to Quor&#x27;toth to reopen the tear in reality at the Hyperion Hotel to get to a dimension that has magic. Angel and Faith agree to this in order to gain the piece of Giles&#x27;s soul in the scythe, but will only help reopen the tear and go to Quor&#x27;toth if Connor agrees to it. Connor is living a normal life as a college student studying social work with a girlfriend. Though initially disappointed Angel ignored his attempts to contact his father, Connor is glad to have Angel in his life and realizes that his normal life is precious, but he still wants Angel to be a part of it. Angel is genuinely proud of the man his son has become. Connor agrees that magic needs to be returned to the world as the most vulnerable in society are already starting to lose hope without it.

Once in Quor&#x27;toth, Connor briefly falls back into more aggressive behavior before he is able to shake off the negative influences of the dimension. His fake magical memories of the childhood Wolfram &amp; Hart created for him have faded since magic was taken from the world, but he has made enough real memories of a happy life to not fall back into his unstable behavior. Dog-like demons of Quor&#x27;toth came to fear and respect &quot;The Destroyer&quot; and overheard Holtz telling Connor about love. Generations of these demons expressed love and compassion in Connor&#x27;s name and were slaughtered for it. Connor, Angel, Faith, and Willow are able to rescue the last few of these demons while fighting off the Old One that rules Quor&#x27;toth, and Willow sends the dog demons to a peaceful dimension.

Angel obtains the piece of Giles&#x27;s soul. Angel, Faith, and Connor return to the hotel just as the tear closes while Willow goes off on her own to find a new source of magic for Earth. Connor accepts Angel has important business to do in England, and wishes his father well. Angel agrees to spend a week in LA with his son before going back to London.

==Character development==

===Creation and casting===
The intent for Connor&#x27;s character was to put &quot;Angel in an emotional space.&quot; He was meant to give Angel more to live for than just the usual &quot;day to day&quot; living he was experiencing. &quot;Plus, I just love the idea of this embarrassing effect of a one-night stand,” Joss Whedon explained in his decision to introduce Angel&#x27;s son. The character was given the Irish name Connor, meaning ‘counselor’ or &#x27;helping warrior&#x27;, to match Angel&#x27;s Irish ancestry. Three different babies, triplets Connor, Jake, and Trenton Tupen, were chosen to portray Connor so that none of them had to remain on the set for very long.
Baby Connor was a main focus of season 3, but the creators were well aware of the limitations of a baby character. With Connor&#x27;s initial role in plot decided, they came up with the concept of a &#x27;teenage&#x27; version for further appearances.

Vincent Kartheiser, then 23, was looking for something more stable than the usual feature movies. He decided to audition after his agent sent him the role and tapes of all previous seasons. The producers wanted the character to be a surprise to audiences, so not even Kartheiser was informed that he was trying out for Angel&#x27;s son. Instead he auditioned for a character created for the purpose of audition, ‘the Street Kid’, a normal teenager who had Angel as his guardian. &quot;Right away everyone kind of had a good feeling about me joining the cast,&quot; Vincent says. &quot;It seemed that I just fit right in.&quot; Kartheiser was excited after learning that his real role was &#x27;Angel&#x27;s son, a demon killer from Quor&#x27;toth.’ He was confused about his portrayal, thinking that the character was to have a &quot;living-in-the-brush kind of ‘failed being’ attitude.&quot; Instead, he was told to just &quot;stand up straight, [use a] normal voice,&quot; and let a regular boy come on. Vincent Kartheiser was initially contracted for three episodes with an option to pick him up further.

===Characterization===

Teenage Connor is an angry, brooding, intense, and volatile teenager who is vindictive towards Angel. Vincent Kartheiser described him as withdrawn and &quot;not willing to open up to the group happiness everyone is so inclined to be part of&quot;. He also highlighted his alienation of this world and resulting caution and unwillingness to trust others. Tim Minear further characterizes Connor by his strong need for family which &quot;means everything to this kid because he&#x27;s never had one&quot; and put emphasis on his &quot;conflicted&quot; personality triggered by his upbringing. David Fury and Minear also highlight Connor&#x27;s similarity to Angel. Fury worked on the resemblance of strength, fighting style, and personality. Minear compared their trait of accepting responsibility even in the worst times. Intending to show Connor as a formidable fighter, Kelly A. Manners described him as &quot;quite the hunter, quite the killer.&quot; Kartheiser notes him as &quot;truly badass&quot;, and jokingly compares his fighting style to that of Jackie Chan. He is attracted to women older than him, which becomes a running gag in the series.

Connor, despite being the son of two vampires, is meant to be human, though with super powers, and therefore was not given the vampire makeup of the series. Kartheiser expresses his simultaneous joy and dismay at this, considering makeup an added benefit for the character and agreeing that the lack of it saved him much time. Connor was initially clad in clothes made of animal skin, said to resemble those of Peter Pan and Robin Hood. He was also wearing, as a trophy, a necklace made of parts of demons he killed in hell. After he settles in this world, he drops the necklace and is given more casual clothes: jeans, T-shirts, and jackets. The concept behind Connor&#x27;s wardrobe was that, unconcerned with this world&#x27;s fashion sense, he &quot;just took whatever was available.&quot; Yet, one interviewer notices his clothing to be &quot;conservative [..] for somebody who&#x27;s never seen an advert&quot;. Connor&#x27;s hairstyle at the start was short and choppy as if cut with a knife. Afterward he&#x27;s given a modern and cleaner look with longer, styled hair. Kartheiser was critical of the new hair style, calling it &quot;David Cassidy hair-do&quot; and feeling it was a &quot;little bit heavy&#x27;.

Connor undergoes dramatic changes in season 5. Very much an opposite to his earlier persona, the only features common with his previous self are his protectiveness of loved ones, attraction to older women, and later his fighting prowess. Otherwise he&#x27;s a prosperous, sweet young man, due to his fake memories of a happy childhood. Jeffrey Bell wanted to highlight Connor&#x27;s &quot;well-adjusted&quot; mentality for this season. Kartheiser called him a &quot;happy&quot; person and enjoyed the contrast with the previous &quot;brooding&quot; version. The comic book Connor develops in the same direction as he starts emerging a hero still keeping his pleasant personality. Joss Whedon characterizes the comic book Connor as &quot;the closest thing to a superhero hell has&quot; because he has powers without any of the weaknesses of the vampire, and is well adjusted. Brain considers him &quot;one of the coolest characters in any series or comics&quot;.

===Story progression===

As is characteristic for Joss Whedon&#x27;s characters, Connor goes through drastic changes with the series progression. Introduced as an &#x27;impossible birth&#x27; at the start of season 3, as an infant the character still had little chance of his own development. So he became an agent for evolution of others; Darla through him, redeems herself of her villainous acts spanning two television series, and Wesley transform from a goofy sidekick to a brooding anti-hero. Once these developments came to fruition, the creators chose to upgrade Connor to a teen. Taking advantage of the fantasy genre, they were able to accelerate his growth within a few weeks of the show&#x27;s normal timeline, thus not affecting the ages of the rest of the characters and setting up stage for the next act. The middle of season 3 sees the infant kidnapped by Angel&#x27;s long-term adversary Holtz, who takes Connor to a hell dimension where &quot;time moves differently,&quot; explains David Greenwalt. &quot;We didn&#x27;t want to raise a baby for 18 years.&quot;

Connor returns near the end of the season as a feral teenage warrior who is vindictive towards Angel. Connor&#x27;s age at his return is disputed: both the creators and episodes vary between putting him at 16 and 18. Regarding Connor&#x27;s upbringing, Mere Smith elaborates that &quot;Holtz has brought up Connor to hate his father, his father is the devil as far as Holtz is concerned and he tells Connor that&quot; This development allowed the writers to explore a unique &#x27;foil&#x27; to protagonists because Connor was established to be &quot;deep down&quot; much like Angel himself. Minear goes on to explain with Smith that immediately following Connor&#x27;s return from hell, Angel had started &quot;converting the boy to his side,&quot; showing him that he&#x27;s no longer a bad guy. Just when Connor is bonding with Angel, Holtz kills himself upon sensing the danger of their reconciliation. This makes Connor back track and sets off a back and forth pattern that continues to repeat till the end of season 4 with Cordelia and then Jasmine taking Holtz&#x27; position between father and son.

Much of Connor&#x27;s development in seasons 3 and 4 is his continuous shifting alliances between protagonists and antagonists; he is unable to find his place or his purpose for being. Jeffrey Bell says that all the confusing and conflicting circumstances never allow Connor a break, which he thinks &quot;makes him empathetic in midst of making all wrong choices&quot;. Steven S. DeKnight says: We really wanted to highlight [..] that he is a tragic victim of circumstance. He never had a childhood, he&#x27;s been lied to and manipulated and in this episode we find out his whole reason for being was to bring this other thing into this world, so he&#x27;s been played his entire life. You really root for him to make the right decision in this one, but you know tragic figure he doesn&#x27;t.

Season 4 also sees the writers exploring teenage sexuality through him, in a small arc with Faith, with whom Steven S. DeKnight compares him in their characterization of misguided youth with superpowers; and the overarching arc with his father&#x27;s love Cordelia. Jeffrey Bell states Arthurian Legend&#x27;s animosity between King Arthur, his son Mordred, and their love triangle with Guinevere as inspiration for the Connor-Cordelia-Angel plot line. Whedon notes that while he already has decided that Cordelia and Connor were going to have sex, the story had to be changed and move faster because Charisma Carpenter became pregnant. The Cordelia plot line additionally gave writers opportunity to explain Connor&#x27;s birth via Jasmine, a character brought in to replace Carpenter as final villain. Taking Jasmine as a base point the writers started connecting back the dots they&#x27;d set up in previous seasons. In the words of DeKnight, &quot;It&#x27;s always been the big mystery of how and why Darla and Angel have a child, &#x27;cause vampires are sterile. We find out this miracle birth was created kind of like a secret ingredient all planned out to sleep with Cordelia and create this superbeing.&quot;

Regarding the resolution of the character at season 4 and dropping of Kartheiser from regular cast, Minear says that they had an idea at the conception of teenage Connor that he would only last a season, and &quot;it was time to end the character&#x27;s story&quot;. But, they changed his original &quot;violent, morbid&quot; sendoff to a relatively happy one, citing their likability of actor and character as the reason. Also it was &quot;nice to give someone a happy ending for once.&quot; Kartheiser was satisfied with the sendoff, particularly because the issue between Angel and Connor was confronted: That to me is the soul of the character. The name of the show is Angel so it all comes back to him. For Connor, everything stems from this place with Angel and Holtz, and when we got the opportunity for him to let that out, I think he came out of his tough shell and showed a little bit of his sensitivity. He showed that he was hurt by his father and that he was hurt by Holtz. The last scene of Angel watching memory-wiped Connor dine with his new family and slipping away quietly was Whedon&#x27;s idea, derived from 1937&#x27;s classic movie &quot;Stella Dallas&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;ve given up my child. I see my child is happy, and does not know me, and I&#x27;m happy. That is the thing that made Stella Darlas the greatest, the thing that made this episode work.&quot;

Despite Whedon&#x27;s claim that the fourth season is a ‘final statement&#x27; for Connor, the character returns for a couple guests appearances in the fifth. This season sees a big development with a &quot;well-adjusted&quot; Connor and the long-due reconciliation of father and son; Connor is able to accept and appreciate all Angel did for him after his memories return. Minear and Bell were open to and had mentioned the possibility of character&#x27;s return to Kartheiser at the end of season 4. But following his return, Kartheiser isn&#x27;t sure if the re-appearance was not only due to the necessity of tying up loose ends after the series was reckoned to be canceled. Originally Kartheiser was asked to appear for one episode &quot;Origin&quot; but the crew and Kartheiser enjoyed working with revamped Connor so much that &quot;it became clear to [them] that he had to appear for the series finale&quot;.

Connor again returns for &quot;Angel:After the Fall&quot;. Brian Lynch was initially confused about how to incorporate Connor into the story. It was Whedon who hit upon the arc that Connor would follow in the series. He said, &quot;Connor&#x27;s a young kid, he&#x27;s got powers, he doesn&#x27;t have any of the bad things, he&#x27;s not a vampire, so maybe he would enjoy it, and maybe he would be the closest thing to a superhero hell has&quot;. Well-adjusted now, Connor is shown &quot;fully embracing his qualities and role of a hero&quot; for the comic series. Originally Lynch had planned for Nina Ash to be more involved in his storyline, but with time it became clear to him that Connor&#x27;s story is more about his relationship with Angel. So Nina fell to the wayside and Connor-Angel went on to become a much closer father-son unit. Connor also went from the character Lynch had the most trouble with to the character he enjoys writing most. Regarding Connor&#x27;s upcoming role in &quot;Angel &amp; Faith&quot;, Whedon joked about time-traveling him to the early 1960s and making him an ad executive, referencing Kartheiser &#x27;s recent role in the television series &quot;Mad Men&quot;. Author Christos Gage describes the necessity of Connor&#x27;s appearance with &quot;otherwise Angel is just a deadbeat Dad!&quot;

In the Angel &amp; Faith Comics, Connor returns in the &quot;Family Reunion&quot; arc, beginning with Issue #11. Willow telling Angel that she needs Connor to act as a compass to Quor&#x27;toth, the world he grew up in, to help restore magic to the world. Connor is now a college student studying social work with a girlfriend named Natalie he&#x27;s been dating 3 months. He rapidly agrees to help Willow and a very reluctant Angel. Connor has seen the toll on society, especially the disenfranchised, that has occurred since magic seed was destroyed in Buffy Season 8. With a blood ritual using Connor&#x27;s blood, Willow tears a fabric in reality to Quor&#x27;toth and Willow, Faith, Angel, and Connor head into the &quot;darkest of the dark worlds&quot;.

==Reception==

===Merchandise===
Several pieces of merchandise, based on Angel television and series, featuring Connor have been released. These merchandise includes a few action figures, but more prominently novels and spin-off comic books. Connor stars as a regular in &quot;After the Fall&quot;&#x27;s spin-off &quot;&quot; and one-shot &quot;&quot;. He is the title character of &quot;&quot;. Continuing his appearances in other media, Connor stars in novels &quot;Dark Mirror&quot;, &quot;Love and Death&quot;, and &quot;Monolith&quot;. These appearances, though a part of official merchandise, are not considered canon.

===Reviews===
The show&#x27;s cast and crew repeatedly praised Vincent Kartheiser for his professionalism and ability to bring much to his character. &quot;You can bet the family fortune on this kid, he can really do it,&quot; stated director Vern Gillum. Producer Tim Minear described Vincent as one of the main reasons of their avoidance of giving the character a ghastly send-off as planned before, “We’ve all grown so fond of the character and the actor that we didn’t want do that.” Although fans and critics reception to Kartheiser&#x27;s portrayal of the disturbed teen was also very positive, the character and his storylines turned out to be controversial.

His sexual relationship with his surrogate mother, Cordelia, particularly evoked attention. Most responses to this couple were negative. &quot;Darkworlds.com&quot;&#x27;s columnist Amy Berner declared them a &quot;finalist in the Most Disturbing Couple In Television History&quot;. In her academic essay &quot;The Assassination of Cordelia Chase,&quot; Jennifer Crusie complained that this plot line led to the destruction of Cordelia&#x27;s character. Charisma Carpenter herself, despite previously noted to have fun portraying the role, became critical of the storyline over time, declaring her character&#x27;s seduction of a teenage boy creepy. Yet, a few gave a positive response. Liz Gasto of &quot;Moviefreak.com&quot; included the Angel–Cordelia–Connor triangle in the plus points of fourth season. &quot;Underland.com&quot; praised the plot line as a &quot;very King Arthur like tale of love and betrayal.&quot; Another group was neutral towards the development. In his book &quot;Blood Relations: Chosen Families in Buffy and Angel&quot;, Jes Battis simply observed that the relationship completes the already present &quot;circuit of erotic incest within &quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;.&quot; Jean Lorrah, in her academic essay &quot;A World Without Love: The Failure of Family in Angel,&quot; agreed with previous statements, further noting that Connor is the product of a relationship with incestuous tones: &quot;Angel is seduced by Darla, formerly his sire (mother), now his granddaughter [..] Connor&#x27;s life, unbeknownst to either parent, has begun.&quot;

Connor&#x27;s characterization and main storyline with his father in seasons 3 and 4 received mixed reviews. Ben from &quot;thescifichristian.com&quot; was not fond of the initial episodes with baby Connor because Angel wasted time &quot;baby-talking,&quot; but he loved the development with teenage Connor, “The [third] season ends with a great storyline as Connor returns [..] and betrays Angel.” Jes Battis praised the father/son dynamics and described as “highly dramatic and (engagingly perverse)”. Journalist Sarah D. Bunting called Connor &quot;a frustrating character&quot; and wrote that while she &quot;gets where he is coming from&quot; and his ”twitchy, PTSD-ish interactions ring true&quot;, they become old too quick due to lack of real development of character and the relationship with Angel for most of season 4. Kartheiser himself expressed this development concern, but he said that &quot;Towards the end of the season I was really happy about the chances I was getting.&quot; This last statement is echoed in Jamie Pool&#x27;s review, who called the “ending” to Connor &quot;emotionally satisfying&quot;, despite noting him to not have been particularly endearing through most of the remaining season. S.Wiebe of &quot;eclipsemagazine.com&quot;, described Connor’s overall characterization &quot;sharp&quot; with &quot;really intriguing sub-textual material&quot; and among the saving graces of the season. Strega of &quot;Television Without Pity&quot;, also praised the character&#x27;s psychology, &quot;The thing I like most is that they&#x27;ve not only created a teenager who doesn&#x27;t just feel like he&#x27;s the most alienated person in the world -- he actually &quot;is&quot;,&quot; and &quot;I love how unloved Connor [thinks he] is…” Jean Lorrah described the Darla-Angel-Connor-Jasmine arc as &quot;surely one of the most ambitious story arcs any television show has ever attempted“ Stacey Abbott of &quot;PopMatters&quot; called the Darla-Angel-Connor storyline &quot;provocative&quot; and &quot;pure family melodrama&quot;. &quot;Cityofangels.com&quot;&#x27;s Tara DiLullo summed up:
 &quot;Vincent Kartheiser [Connor] had a challenging year playing Angel’s errant son, to say the least. While audiences may have hoped for a reconciliation between the two, it was never meant to be. Connor instead started and remained [..] as petulant and unsympathetic as many teens are in real life. [His pairing with] Cordelia completely fouled just about everyone and made him the whipping boy for fan ire. But [Vincent] earns serious kudos for his amazing last inning transformation of Connor from brat to tragic figure worthy of pity and understanding in Peace Out and Home. That Vincent was able to redeem Connor in such a short time is a true feat in itself and it was singularly responsible for making the finale as heartbreaking and haunting as it ended up being.&quot;

A revamped Connor received praise during the final season. Phoenix of &quot;cityofangel.com&quot; declared Connor&#x27;s return as “triumphant”, saying this “shy, sweet, happy young man” is the kid Angel always wanted, and “for the audience, a version of the character finally worth liking and supporting.” Roz Kaveney, in his essay &quot;A Sense of the Ending: Schrödinger&#x27;s Angel,&quot; praised the new Connor as a “heroic youth”. Writer Brian Lynch admitted that he did not love season 4&#x27;s Connor, but that he &quot;really liked him&quot; in season 5&quot;when he came back and he was well adjusted.&quot;

Connor&#x27;s name is often mentioned with &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;&#x27;s Dawn Summers younger sister to Buffy Summers similarly created to give a strong emotional connection to the titular character. Four years after the cancellation of &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;IGN&quot; included Connor along with Dawn in their list of classic TV&#x27;s cliché of ‘Adding a Kid’ as a last-ditch effort to save a dying show. In order to avoid swamping themselves with comments from irate fans of either side, they did not say if his addition was a good or bad choice. David Hofstede in his book &quot;What Were They Thinking?&quot; openly criticized Connor and Dawn&#x27;s addition, appointing them number No.98 in his list of &quot;100 Dumbest Events in Television History&quot;.

Connor&#x27;s appearance as a regular in &quot;After the Fall&quot;, was initially met with dismay by some fans. IDW representative Chris Ryall responded to these complaints with optimism, assuring the fans that the character would win them over, just the way he has been, by the time the series end. True to his words, &quot;After The Fall&quot;’s Connor was received positively. Brian Lynch confirmed this in an interview, stating that Connor has not only been the most pleasantly surprising character for him to write, he has been the most surprising for the fans as well, &quot;Connor was a great character on the TV show but, I don’t think he was ever a favorite. But he’s slowly but surely become one of the most popular characters in &quot;After The Fall&quot;, which is wonderful.&quot; He further said that he himself like the character so much now, he wants to do a book called &#x27;Son of Angel&#x27; based on him.

===Analysis===
Connor has been analyzed and compared with other male characters of the series in terms of the presentation and evolution of masculinity in fiction. His sexual relation with his surrogate mother, coupled with his struggles to kill his father, led to numerous speculations that mythical Greek figure Oedipus was the inspiration for the character. and references to Arthurian Legend were also made. In Erin B. Waggoner&#x27;s book &quot;Sexual rhetoric in the works of Joss Whedon,&quot; he found it interesting that the ancient Oedipus complex continues to be used as a way to underscore one&#x27;s masculinity, but he added that &quot;Connor is not the only one [..] Angel, Wes, Spike and even Fred (through Gunn) kill father or father figures in order to come into their own as individuals.&quot; Further citing Gwen&#x27;s role among Connor and Gunn in the comic series triangle, he observed the unrelenting use of women as a device for men to shore up.

Stacey Abbott of &quot;PopMatters&quot; cited David Greenwalt&#x27;s statement that &quot;&quot;Angel&quot; is about how hard it is to be a man.&quot; Greenwalt observed that the show raises questions about what it means to be a man and does this not only through the characterization of Angel but also the men around him. He said that like other male characters, taken alone Connor may seem a stereotypical teen boy, but considered with rest of the cast offers a complex image of modern masculinity. Greenwalt also compared Connor&#x27;s journey with others in terms of identity, which he considers a poignant theme within the series. He found it ironic that Connor who was &quot;initially the most damaged of all the characters&quot;, was the only one able to &quot;reconcile his actions and new man existence together&quot; and be at peace with himself in the end.

<doc id="800052" wikidata="Q2311346" url="?curid=800052" title="Anorak (slang)">
<text>&quot;Anorak&quot; is a British slang term which refers to a person who has a very strong interest, perhaps obsessive, in niche subjects. This interest may be unacknowledged or not understood by the general public. The term is sometimes used synonymously with &quot;geek&quot; or &quot;nerd&quot;, or the Japanese term &quot;otaku&quot;, albeit referring to different niches.

==Etymology==
The first use of the term to describe an obsessive fan has been credited to the radio presenter Andy Archer, who used the term in the early 1970s for fans of offshore radio, who would charter boats to come out to sea to visit the radio ships.
In 1983, the first edition of the &quot;Anoraks UK Weekly Report&quot; was published, featuring news of pirate radio broadcasts.
In 1984 the &quot;Observer&quot; newspaper used the term as a metonym for the prototype group interested in detailed trivia, the trainspotters, as members of this group often wore unfashionable but warm cagoules or parkas called &quot;anoraks&quot; when standing for hours on station platforms or along railway tracks, noting down details of passing trains.

<text>The following is the 1972–73 network television schedule for the three major English language commercial broadcast networks in the United States. The schedule covers prime-time hours from September 1972 through August 1973. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series cancelled after the 1971–72 season. All times are Eastern and Pacific, with certain exceptions, such as &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;.

New fall series are highlighted in bold.

Each of the 30 highest-rated shows is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.

: Yellow indicates the programs in the top 10 for the season.
: Cyan indicates the programs in the top 20 for the season.
: Magenta indicates the programs in the top 30 for the season.

Note: This was the first full season in which all networks, on every day of the week except for Sunday, started airing programs at 8:00 instead of 7:30, as dictated by the FCC under its Prime Time Access Rule, intended to increase diversity in programming.

PBS is not included; member stations have local flexibility over most of their schedules and broadcast times for network shows may vary.

== Sunday ==
Note: &quot;60 Minutes&quot; aired at 6:00-7:00 pm on CBS from January to June 1973.

== Monday ==
== Tuesday ==

* formerly &quot;Chronolog&quot;

== Wednesday ==

Note: &quot;Dan August&quot; consisted of reruns of the 1970-1971 ABC series.

== Thursday ==
== Friday ==

Note: &quot;Ghost Story&quot; was retooled slightly and retitled &quot;Circle of Fear&quot; (under the same production team) with the episode broadcast January 5, 1973.

<text>Acarius (died 14 March 642), venerated as Saint Acarius, was a monk of Luxeuil Abbey who became Bishop of Doornik and Noyon, which today are located on either side of the Franco-Belgian border.

==Life==
Acarius was born to a noble family of Burgundy. He entered the Abbey of Luxeuil and was a pupil of Abbot Eustace. Audomar, future bishop of Thérouanne was a classmate.

While the date of his election is not known, it is assured that he was bishop of Doornik and Noyon in 627. He was an adviser to King Clothar II. Apparently, Acarius had great influence on the spreading of Christianity in Belgic Gaul. It was Acarius that recommended to Dagobert that Audomar be appointed Bishop of Thérouanne. He was a strong supporter of the missionary Amandus, but despite his influence could not prevent King Dagobert I from banishing Amandus for chastising him. Amandus then went to Gascony. Along with Audomar and the King&#x27;s counselor, Éloi, they were eventually able to persuade Dagobert to allow Amandus to return, and Acarius sent him to preach in the area of Tournai.

As bishop, Acarius was especially attentive to the poor and afflicted, whose needs he enjoyed relieving and calming their suffering. He built a number of monasteries.

==Veneration==
Soon after his death in November 640, he was venerated as a Saint. He was succeeded as bishop by Eligius.

His memorial is 27 Nov. Acarius is invoked against a &quot;cantankerous&quot; mood. The Église Saints-Hugues-et-Achaire de Haspres

<text>Charles Floyd (June 20, 1782 – August 20, 1804) was an American explorer, a non-commissioned officer in the U.S. Army, and the quartermaster of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. A native of Kentucky, he was a son of Robert Clark Floyd, a nephew of James John Floyd, a cousin of Virginia governor John Floyd, and possibly a relative of William Clark. He was one of the first men to join the expedition, and the only member of the Corps of Discovery to die during the expedition.

==Lewis and Clark Expedition==
While exploring the Louisiana Purchase with Lewis and Clark, he took ill at the end of July 1804. On July 31, Floyd wrote in his diary, &quot;I am very sick and have been for sometime but have recovered my health again.&quot; However, this apparent recovery was soon followed by a severe turn for the worse. William Clark described Floyd&#x27;s death as one &quot;with a great deal of composure&quot; and that before Floyd died he said to Clark, &quot;I am going away. Please write me a letter.&quot;

A funeral was held and Floyd was buried on a bluff overlooking the Missouri River. The expedition named the location Floyd&#x27;s Bluff in his honor. They camped that night at the mouth of Floyd River, &quot;about 30 yards wide, a beautiful evening.--&quot;

Clark diagnosed the condition which led to Floyd&#x27;s demise as bilious colic, though modern doctors and historians believe Floyd&#x27;s death was more likely to have been caused by a ruptured appendix. The brief &quot;recovery&quot; Floyd described may have represented the temporary relief afforded by the bursting of the organ, which would have been followed by a fatal peritonitis. If that were the case, because there was no known cure for appendicitis at that time, he would have been no better off had he been with the best physicians of the day.

==Legacy==

Floyd&#x27;s Bluff is currently within the city limits of Sioux City, Iowa. The Sergeant Floyd Monument was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1960. This monument is now located in a park that offers visitors a view of the Missouri River valley. Floyd&#x27;s final resting place is located on old U.S. Highway 75, in the southern part of Sioux City, Iowa, in the United States.

After Floyd&#x27;s expedition journal was published in 1894, new interest was taken in him and his grave-marker was stolen by thieves. He was re-buried once more on August 20, 1895, with a monument. A marble cornerstone three feet wide and seven feet long was placed in 1900. When the obelisk of white sandstone standing high was completed on May 30, 1901, Floyd&#x27;s grave was moved for the fourth time to rest nearby. It was designated a National Historic Landmark on June 30, 1960.

Charles Floyd is the namesake of Floyd County, Iowa. The town of Sergeant Bluff is named in honor of Floyd. The Interstate 129 bridge between Sioux City and South Sioux City, Nebraska is named the Sergeant Floyd Memorial Bridge in his honor.

<text>Romneya () is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the poppy family (Papaveraceae). There are two species in the genus &quot;Romneya&quot;, which was named for Irish astronomer John Thomas Romney Robinson. They are known commonly as Matilija poppies ( ), bush poppies, California poppies, or tree poppies. The common name &quot;Matilija&quot; is said to come from the Chumash leader, Chief Matilija. They are also known as the &quot;fried egg flower&quot; or the &quot;fried egg plant&quot; due to their bright yellow stamen, which creates the image of a sunny-side-up egg. They are native to chaparral and coastal scrub habitats in Southern California and Baja California. They are also known to do well in Britain.

They are perennial subshrubs with woody stems. They may grow to a height of and a width of , with the flowers up to across. The silvery green leaves are deeply cut, with a small fringe of hairs at the margins.

They are notable for their large, satiny white flowers and intense boss of yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and summer. Their thin white petals have a satiny crepe-like texture. &quot;Romneya&quot; produce the largest flowers of any members of the poppy family. These flowers prefer a warm, sunny spot against a south-facing wall with fertile soil with good water drainage. They are not easily grown but once established are difficult to remove. In the wild, they are known as &quot;fire followers&quot; because they need smoke to germinate and can be frequently, but not exclusively, found in burned areas. When these flowers are grown on a hillside, they can act as a soil binder and prevent erosion. Matilija poppies were reportedly used medicinally by the Chumash to treat skin and gum problems, and stomach aches. 
The two species are:
*&quot;Romneya coulteri&quot; – Coulter&#x27;s Matilija poppy
*&quot;Romneya trichocalyx&quot; – Bristly Matilija poppy. Some consider this a variety of &quot;Romneya coulteri&quot;, but it is accepted in recent manuals.

<text>Sittingbourne is an industrial town in the Swale district of Kent, southeast England, from Canterbury and from London, beside the Roman Watling Street, an ancient trackway used by the Romans and the Anglo-Saxons.

The town stands next to the Swale, a strip of sea separating mainland Kent from the Isle of Sheppey. The town became prominent after the death of Thomas Becket in 1170, since it provided a convenient resting point on the road from London to Canterbury and Dover.

Chatham Main Line links to London Victoria station and HS1 to St Pancras International, the journey taking about an hour from Sittingbourne railway station.

==History==
Sittingbourne owes its name to a modernised version of an observation on its location. The town&#x27;s name came from the fact that there is a small stream or &quot;bourne&quot; running underground in part of the town. Hasted writing in the 1790s in his &quot;History of Kent&quot; states that:
The Kent Hundred Rolls of 1274–5, preserved in the National Archives, record Sittingbourne as Sydingeburn in the following entries &quot;
Item dicunt quod Johannes Maresescall de Synele tenet unam parvam purpresturam in villa de Sydingeburn et solvit domino regi per annum 1d et dominus rex nichil perdit et quod Petrus de London tenet unam parvam purpresturam in villa de Sydingeburn et solvit inde per annum domino regi 1d et rex nichil perdit.&quot; Translated as, &quot;Then they say John Marshall de Synele holds one small encroachment in the vill of Sittingbourne and he pays the lord king 1d. each year and the lord king loses nothing and that Peter of London holds one small encroachment in the vill of Sittingbourne and he pays 1d. each year to the lord king and the king loses nothing.&quot;

In 1921, the civil parish had a population of 9339. On 31 March 1930 the parish was abolished to form &quot;Sittingbourne and Milton&quot;, part also went to Tunstall.

===Romans===
There is evidence of settlement in the area before 2000 BC, with farming and trading tribes living inland to avoid attack, yet close enough to access the sea at Milton Creek. In AD 43, the Romans invaded Kent, and to make access quicker between London and Dover, built Watling Street, which passed straight through Sittingbourne. As a point where sea access met road access, the port of Milton Regis became the Roman administrative centre for the area, with some 20 villas so far discovered, but Sittingbourne remained a minor hamlet throughout Roman times. 

Most Roman finds in this area were due to the efforts of 19th-century brick makers who used topsoil to make bricks, and uncovered the finds; and preserved thanks to banker George Payne, who preserved or bought materials and published his works in 1893 in &quot;Collectanea Cantiana&quot;.

===Middle Age Hostelry===

There was no entry for Sittingbourne in the Domesday book of 1086, merely a note attached to Milton Regis showing a population of 393 households. However, after the murder of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket in 1170, pilgrims began to travel to Canterbury Cathedral and Sittingbourne became a useful hostelry for travellers. Sittingbourne is mentioned as a stopping point in Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, with the Summoner in &quot;The Wife of Bath&#x27;s Prologue&quot; saying:

The parish church of St Michael was built in the 13th century. At that time, the High Street had 13 pubs and hostels. The Lyon – now the Red Lion – hosted King Henry V of England on his way back from the Battle of Agincourt, and Henry VIII visited Sittingbourne in 1522 and 1532. In 1708, the Rose Inn was built, originally called Rose Place and used as a private house. According to Edward Hasted &quot;the principal inn now in it (Sittingbourne), called the Rose, is perhaps the most superb of any throughout the kingdom.&quot; In 1825 the future Queen Victoria and her mother, Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld stayed overnight at the Rose Inn.

===Railway and Industrial Revolution===
After the railway came in 1858, Sittingbourne became less a market trading and hostelry stop-off, and more a 19th-century centre of production to fuel the expansion of London, by producing bricks and paper from its clay substrata.

===The First World War===
The area around Sittingbourne was subject to constant air raids by Zeppelins and aeroplanes during the First World War. The Germans used the town as a reference point for bearings on the way to London.

The first visit by a German aeroplane happened on Christmas Day 1914. Guns at Sheerness fired at the lone invader but still one shell dropped into a field at Iwade. The next event was to occur on 16 January 1915 when another solitary pilot from a German aerodrome in Belgium bombed Sittingbourne. This aircraft, a Taube, was pursued by two local airmen, but managed to escape after dropping a couple of bombs.

About 100 air-raid warnings were sounded in Sittingbourne during the First World War and anti-aircraft batteries were strengthened in 1917. The last big raid to pass over the town on Whit Sunday (19 May 1918), carried out by a number of Gothas, eliciting perhaps the most ferocious barrage from the ground defences the town had ever seen.

The local newspaper, the &quot;East Kent Gazette&quot;, reported:

:&quot;The first of these duels occurred about an hour after the raid had been in progress, and probably this machine was caught while on its way to London. It was engaged by a daring aviation officer while at a great height. The British airman attacked his opponent so fiercely that the German was forced down to a lower height, and ultimately, to the joy of the onlookers, the Gotha burst into flames, seemed to break in two and came down piecemeal, all aflame. The wrecked machine and the three occupants fell by a farm. Two of the Germans fell into marshy ground and their bodies were deeply embedded in the mud. The third man&#x27;s head struck a wall and was shattered like an eggshell. All three bodies were removed to a local aviation establishment. The fall of the burning Gotha was seen for miles around.&quot;

The second Gotha was surrounded by British fighters shortly after, returning from a successful raid on London.

Donald John Dean VC OBE of Sittingbourne was awarded the Victoria Cross for deeds carried out in France in 1918. His ashes are interred in the family plot at St John the Baptist Church, Tunstall, Kent.

As a result of the number of soldiers blinded during the war, the Kent Association for the Blind was formed in Sittingbourne in 1920.

==Economy==
The local clay was suitable for making bricks, and North Kent is geologically rich in chalk, which is not found in many other places in Europe in such abundance. This led to the development associated industries: water transport, paper, and cement; all of which continue today in the area.

===Brickmaking===
In 1870, up to 2,628 men were working in the brick and tile industry, this is compared to Staffordshire (the next largest brick manufacturing area) that had only 1,566 men working in the industry. Brickmaking continued in the town well into the mid twentieth century. The bricks for the London Bridge – Greenwich Railway Viaduct were all made at Sittingbourne and transported to the site by barge.

===Bargebuilding and water transport===
Barges were needed to move many other raw materials and finished goods into the Thames and to London and beyond. Sittingbourne was ideally suited for this purpose and a successful barge-building industry developed at Milton Creek.

Sittingbourne developed into a port during the Industrial Revolution, from which Kentish produce was transported to the London markets. During this era over 500 types of barges are believed to have been built, centred around Conyer, a Roman hamlet of the village of Teynham, found at the head of a small creek between Sittingbourne and Faversham.

After World War II, these activities began to fall into a decline, so that only the Burley yard continued with the repair of barges until about 1965.
Charles Burley was a brick maker and barge owner who occupied the yard in Crown Quay Lane, which is now occupied by a builders&#x27; merchant.
This lack of barge repairs led the creek to become silted and derelict. In 1968, the site was owned by Bourncrete Limited, manufacturers of concrete products.

The yard was then leased to the newly established Dolphin Sailing Barge Museum Trust.
The inlet alongside the Museum usually contains at least one vessel brought to the yard for restoration, including the famous sailing barge Cambria.

The town&#x27;s links with water transport survive today, through a bronze statue of a bargeman in the town centre.
The Dolphin Sailing Barge Museum was destroyed by arson in 2008.
The museum is now awaiting relocation to a new site
Plans to move to Whitstable Harbour were refused in 2013.

===Paper===
Paper mills and brickfields were fed by barges that brought in sand, mud and household waste such as cinders for brick making, and took away the finished product on the return journey.

Paper manufacture started in Sittingbourne in 1708, when Peter Archer was recorded as a Paper Maker. Sittingbourne Mill existed from circa 1769, which by 1820 had grown and was owned by Edward Smith. The &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot; owner Edward Lloyd bought the site in 1863. Using pulped straw from the local farmers and esparto (imported from Algeria and Southern Spain) as a replacement for expensive cotton rag which was becoming more expensive; the output supplied newsprint for his mills in Bow.

To speed production, in 1904 Lloyd&#x27;s son built a wharf on the tidal inlet at Milton Creek in 1904;a horse-drawn tramway to carry materials to the mill was also built. On what is now known as the Sittingbourne &amp; Kemsley Light Railway, in 1906 the first of three steam locomotives, Premier, came into service, all 0-4-2 &quot;Brazil&quot; type tank engines sourced from Kerr Stuart. In 1913 the railway was extended to the new dock built at Ridham. In 1912, Sittingbourne Paper Mill was the largest producer of newsprint in the world, with its 1,200 employees using 17 machines to make over 2000 tonnes per week, supplying the demands of Fleet Street.

In 1924, Lloyd&#x27;s son built a new factory at Kemsley, together with a model village for employees. He died in 1936, when the Lloyd group was taken over by Sir William Berry, who in 1936 formed the Bowater-Lloyd Group. After both plants were acquired by Metsa Serla in 1998, the decision was made to close the Sittingbourne Mill in October 2006, with the last reel produced on 23 January 2007.

==Education==
Sittingbourne and the surrounding area have a number of primary schools. The main secondary schools in the town are Fulston Manor School, The Sittingbourne School, The Westlands School and two single sex Grammar Schools, Borden Grammar School (Boys) and Highsted Grammar School (Girls). Pupils wishing to apply for a year 7 place at grammar school have to take the Kent Test (11+) to assess if grammar school is a suitable option for them.

Sittingbourne Adult Education Centre provides some post-16 and adult training in the town and there is an Adult Skills centre located in the town centre. In May 2015 a post-16 technical college opened in the town.

==Transport==
The town is served by Sittingbourne railway station which is located approximately 44 miles from and located on the Chatham Main Line, close to the junction where it meets the Sheerness Line. Opened by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway in 1858, the station is now managed by Southeastern who operate all services. The station is served by regular mainline and high speed services to , London St Pancras International (via High Speed 1), The Medway Towns, Canterbury, Dover and Ramsgate as well as by an hourly shuttle service to .

Most bus services in Sittingbourne are provided by Chalkwell Coaches who operate services 326, 327, 347 and 349 to Chatham, Gillingham, Rainham, Upchurch, Newington, Kemsley and Murston. Sittingbourne is also served by the Arriva Southern Counties route 334 to Maidstone, Iwade, Minster and Sheerness and by the Stagecoach South East route X3 to Maidstone, Teynham, Faversham and Canterbury. The towns bus services all serve Sittingbourne Bus Hub which opened in 2019.

Sittingbourne is geographically located midway between the major port of Dover and London. The first significant transport connection to the town was the Roman construction of Watling Street, now the A2 main road. The M2 motorway bypasses the town to the south. The A249 passes the town on the west, heading between Maidstone and Sheerness.

===Sittingbourne and Kemsley Light Railway===
The preserved former paper mill railway the Sittingbourne and Kemsley Light Railway still exists today. In 1965 it was decided that the railway was uneconomic, so lorries were more commonly used for transporting produce. Consequently, by 1969 the Bowater Light Railway, much loved as it was by the firm (and with assistance of Capt Peter Manisty) was handed over to the Locomotive Club of Great Britain to be preserved and operated as the Sittingbourne and Kemsley Light Railway. 

It has since become a significant feature in the town&#x27;s tourist industry, and provides the only method of transport to the annual Sittingbourne Beer Festival. However, it has been under threat of closure since 2008 when M-real sold the site to a property developer.

<text>Denis Gauthier, Jr. (born October 1, 1976) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman. A first round selection of the Calgary Flames at the 1995 NHL Entry Draft, Gauthier played for the Flames, Phoenix Coyotes, Philadelphia Flyers and Los Angeles Kings during his ten-season National Hockey League (NHL) career.

==Playing career==
Gauthier played four seasons of major-junior hockey with the Drummondville Voltigeurs of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. He holds the franchise record for most goals by a defenceman in one season, 25, and had his number 21 retired by the Voltiguers in 2009.

Known for his big open-ice hits, this physical, defensive player was the Calgary Flames&#x27; first-round draft pick, 20th overall, in the 1995 Entry Draft. He made his NHL debut in 1997 and quickly established himself as a powerful presence on the blue line.

He played only the first round of the Flames&#x27; 2004 playoff run after suffering a knee injury in Game 6 against the Vancouver Canucks. He later underwent surgery on his anterior cruciate ligament on May 21.

In the 2004 off-season, he was traded to the Phoenix Coyotes in a deal also involving Daymond Langkow and Oleg Saprykin. During the 2006 trade deadline, Gauthier was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers for Josh Gratton and 2 second round draft picks. Prior to the 2007-08 season, Gauthier was waived by the Flyers and was assigned to the Philadelphia Phantoms. He spent the entire season with the Phantoms, and following the season was waived again on June 30, 2008. The following day, he was traded along with a 2010 second round draft pick to the Los Angeles Kings for Patrik Hersley and Ned Lukacevic.

On February 2, 2009, Gauthier was suspended for five games for a high elbow head shot to Montreal Canadiens defenseman Josh Gorges. On February 21, 2009, Gauthier was suspended for two games for boarding on an icing call to San Jose Sharks captain Patrick Marleau.

<text>Jonathan Cape is a British publishing firm headquartered in London and founded in 1921 by Herbert Jonathan Cape, who was head of the firm until his death.

Cape and his business partner Wren Howard (1893–1968) set up the publishing house in 1921. They established a reputation for high-quality design and production and a fine list of English-language authors, fostered by the firm&#x27;s editor and reader Edward Garnett. Cape&#x27;s list of writers ranged from poets including Robert Frost and C. Day Lewis, to children&#x27;s authors such as Roald Dahl, Hugh Lofting and Arthur Ransome, to James Bond novels by Ian Fleming, to heavyweight fiction by James Joyce and T. E. Lawrence.

After Cape&#x27;s death, the firm later merged successively with three other London publishing houses. In 1987 it was taken over by Random House. Its name continues as one of Random House&#x27;s British imprints.

==Cape – biography==
===Early years===

Herbert Jonathan Cape was born in London on 15 November 1879, the youngest of the seven children of Jonathan Cape, a clerk from Ireby in what is now Cumbria, and his wife Caroline, &quot;née&quot; Page. He received a basic schooling; in his early teens, Cape was taken on by Hatchards bookshop in Piccadilly as an errand-boy.

Four years later, in 1899, Cape joined the London office of the American publishers Harper and Brothers, where he worked, successively, as a clerk, general utility man and travelling salesman, first in the provinces and later in London. In 1904 he joined the publishing house of Duckworth as London traveller, and from 1911 as manager. In 1914, on the outbreak of the Great War, he took over the sole charge of the business when the proprietor, Gerald Duckworth, was absent on war duties. In 1915, Duckworth returned. In December of that year Cape joined the army, serving for the rest of the war.

Cape returned to Duckworth in 1918. In 1920, he was appointed manager of the Medici Society, known mainly for publishing prints of paintings but with a small list of books. While in this post he met George Wren Howard, 14 years his junior, who was learning the publishing trade at the Medici Society. 
Cape&#x27;s biographer (and sometimes junior partner) Rupert Hart-Davis writes:
===Independent publisher===
Howard was able to raise money from his family. Cape, with no such option, raised his share of the starting capital by selling cheap paperback reprints of novels by Elinor Glyn. Duckworth held the rights to her books, but did not wish to issue cut-price editions; Cape negotiated the rights in early 1920 and successfully issued the paperbacks under the imprint Page &amp; Co. With just enough starting capital, the firm of Jonathan Cape began trading on 1 January 1921 at 11 Gower Street, Bloomsbury.

Cape and Howard recruited Edward Garnett as their editor and reader. Garnett, described by &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;the prince of publisher&#x27;s readers,&quot; remained with the firm until his death in 1937. Each of the three principals brought his own contribution to the firm&#x27;s success: Cape was experienced in publishing; Howard ensured high quality design and production; and Garnett was given the freedom to foster talent and build up a fine publishing list. Hart-Davis credits Garnett&#x27;s literary judgment and Howard&#x27;s production with gaining the firm an &quot;outstanding reputation for quality during the next two decades&quot;.

The firm&#x27;s first publication was widely regarded as a gamble: Cape published a new two-volume edition, at the high price of nine guineas, of C. M. Doughty&#x27;s &quot;Travels in Arabia Deserta.&quot; The book, first published in 1888 with no success, had been out of print for 30 years. The Cape edition sold out and had to be reprinted several times. Among those who admired it was T. E. Lawrence, who became friendly with Cape, and wrote an introduction to the firm&#x27;s 1926 single-volume edition of the book. Jonathan Cape Ltd became Lawrence&#x27;s publishers, issuing &quot;Revolt in the Desert&quot; (1927), &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot; (1935), and &quot;The Mint&quot; (1955).

In 1922, Cape took over the small publishing house A. C. Fifield, acquiring the rights to works by such authors as H. G. Wells, W. H. Davies, Sidney Webb and Samuel Butler. Cape was among the first British publishers to seek out American authors. Hart-Davis notes that the firm recruited three future Nobel Prize-winners – Sinclair Lewis, Ernest Hemingway, and Eugene O&#x27;Neill – as well as many other American writers including H. L. Mencken, Robert Frost, and Margaret Mead. British and other European authors published by Cape included H. E. Bates, Peter Fleming, Robert Graves, Christopher Isherwood, James Joyce, Malcolm Lowry, André Maurois, Douglas Reed, and Henry Williamson. The firm&#x27;s best-sellers included Arthur Ransome&#x27;s adventure books, Hugh Lofting&#x27;s Doctor Dolittle stories, and most profitable of all, Ian Fleming&#x27;s James Bond series.

Cape opened an American publishing house in 1929, first in partnership with Harrison Smith and later with Robert Ballou. The firm was not successful and went bankrupt in 1932.

===Marriage and family===

Cape was three times married and three times widowed. In 1907 he married Edith Louisa Creak, with whom he had two daughters. Edith Cape died in 1919. In 1927 Cape married Olyve Vida James, with whom he had a son and a daughter; Olyve Cape died in 1931. In 1941 he married Kathleen Mary Webb, with whom he had a son; Kathleen Cape died in 1953.

Cape suffered two strokes in 1954, which impaired his speech, but he fought his way back to health. He was still running the firm when he celebrated his 80th birthday in November 1959. He died suddenly at his London flat on 10 February 1960. He was buried at St Peter&#x27;s Church, Petersham.

==The firm after Cape==
From 1960, the publishing house was headed by Tom Maschler for more than three decades. As the 1960s progressed, the firm successfully courted and published authors who were representative of the age, including the Beatle John Lennon, and the former &quot;angry young man&quot; Kingsley Amis. Cape also signed up Len Deighton, whose series of spy novels was a gritty alternative to the far-fetched adventures of James Bond. In the 1970s, Cape published popular authors in many genres, including the novelists J. G. Ballard and Salman Rushdie, and the children&#x27;s writer Roald Dahl. One of their freelance cover artists was Bill Botten.

A defensive merger with Chatto and Windus was carried out in 1969; and The Bodley Head and Virago Press were added to the group. In 1987 Cape was taken over and became an imprint of Random House.

<text>The Hawaii State Public Library System (HSPLS) is the only statewide public library system in the United States.

The system has 51 libraries on all the major Hawaiian Islands: Big Island of Hawaii, Kauai, Lānai, Maui, Molokai and Oahu. The system&#x27;s collection of books and other library materials totals over three million. There is one library for the blind and physically handicapped, located on Oahu. The Hawaii State Public Library System is headed by the Hawaii State Librarian, currently Stacey Aldrich, who reports to the Hawaii Board of Education.

The flagship Hawaii State Library, built in 1911 and designed by architect Henry D. Whitfield, was funded in part by industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. It is a historic downtown Honolulu building.

== Early years ==
In 1879, the Honolulu Library and Reading Room Association was formed. The HLRRA was Hawaii&#x27;s second subscription library and was supported by the Hawaiian royal family. King Kalakaua, Queen Kapionlani, Queen Emma, and Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop gave financially and donated their personal book collections to the association. King Kalakaua gave tax exemptions and a land grant for a site in downtown Honolulu.

== First library of Hawaii ==
The Hawaii Library and Reading Room Association served the people of Hawaii for 34 years, and in 1909 signed an agreement with the trustees of the Library of Hawaii to contribute the collection of 20,000 printed materials, furnishings, and funds toward the new library. The trustees obtained a $100,000 grant from the Andrew Carnegie Foundation for the new library building. The cornerstone was laid on October 21, 1911, and the first day the library opened was February 1, 1913. The front columns identify the building as a Carnegie library, and the total cost of the building was $127,000 with the territorial legislature providing the additional $27,000. During the next 10 years the library grew rapidly, and in 1927 the legislation appropriated $300,000 to expand and renovate the original building. The expansion was designed by C.W. Dickey and included the addition of two wings creating a quadrangle with an open-air courtyard in the middle. In 1978, the building was designated a historic site and was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 1990, the State Legislature passed funding for a second renovation. The updated building now includes air conditioning, a new roof, new plumbing, handicapped access, landscaping, and another large wing successfully blending in with the existing building.

<doc id="800078" wikidata="Q23811062" url="?curid=800078" title="Fiscal drag">
<text>Fiscal drag happens when the government&#x27;s net fiscal position (spending minus taxation) fails to cover the net savings desires of the private economy, also called the private economy&#x27;s spending gap (earnings minus spending and private investment). The resulting lack of aggregate demand leads to deflationary pressure, or drag, on the economy, essentially due to lack of state spending or to excess taxation.

One cause of fiscal drag may be bracket creep, where progressive taxation increases automatically as taxpayers move into higher tax brackets due to inflation. This tends to moderate inflation, and can be characterized as an automatic stabilizer to the economy. Fiscal drag can also be a result of a hawkish stance towards government finances.

==Real fiscal drag==
Real fiscal drag takes place when tax thresholds are increased in line with price rises to avoid &quot;nominal fiscal drag&quot;, but where a growing economy means that earnings rise faster still, so increasing taxes as proportion of earnings.

==Political dimension==
Ireland is an example of a country in which, in recent years, the progressive income tax system has allowed government revenues to swell due to both nominal and real fiscal drag without either increases in the tax rates or decreases in the thresholds. That is because the country has experienced considerable economic growth, which some attribute to the low-interest monetary regime of the European Central Bank, resulting in high wage inflation. Whereas others attribute to the economic and educational policies of the Irish government, in subsidizing education and eliminating taxation of the arts, two historically low-income demographics that would thus respond strongly to an increase in income, resulting in price inflation and thus wage inflation to retain purchasing power parity.

<text>The Professional Spring Football League (PSFL) was a proposed outdoor american football minor league slated to begin in 1992. The league was founded by Vincent Sette, a computer sales executive, while TV executive Rex Lardner served as commissioner.

==Beginning==
Spring football was nothing new by the early 90s: the United States Football League played three seasons from 1983-85, while the NFL&#x27;s own minor league, the World League of American Football, was starting its second season in 1992. Lardner was unconcerned about the USFL&#x27;s failure or competition from the WLAF: &quot;We&#x27;re going to play a new brand of football that will create excitement.&quot; Two-point conversions were to be allowed and overtime was to be a modified sudden death, with each team being guaranteed a possession. The PSFL also had what they called a &quot;universal ticket&quot; which allowed season ticket holders to attend any league game anywhere in the country.

Announced on October 1, 1991 -- less than five months before their scheduled opening game -- the PSFL had no TV contract, but did air a preview show on SportsChannel America in 1991, laying out the ten teams that would play. Walt Michaels, former coach of the New York Jets and the USFL&#x27;s New Jersey Generals was announced as the PSFL&#x27;s Director of Football Operations, but apparently had no role with the league going forward.

The PSFL also hired some fairly high-profile coaches (including ex-Denver Gold coach Craig Morton and former Detroit Lions and college coach Darryl Rogers), and a number of current or future notable Arena Football and NFL players were in the teams&#x27; training camps, including mid-90s Miami Dolphins running back Bernie Parmalee, AFL quarterback Ben Bennett, AFL defensive specialist Durwood Roquemore, and AFL wide receiver/defensive back Barry Wagner. Also vying for spots in the PSFL were former Notre Dame signal-caller Tony Rice and running back Timmy Smith, who rushed for a then-record 204 yards in Super Bowl XXII for the Washington Redskins. The team salary cap was set at $2 million per team with 50-man rosters.

The 1992 PSFL season was set to begin in Tampa on February 29, with the Utah Pioneers taking on the Tampa Bay Outlaws. There was to be a sixteen-game regular season through June 14, two rounds of playoffs, and the championship game (or &quot;Red, White And Blue Bowl&quot;), scheduled for Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in Washington, D.C., on Sunday, July 5.

The league was the first sports LLC, which has been used as a blueprint for several leagues since, such as Major League Soccer and the WNBA. Rather than the league being set up as a non-profit organization which technically exists for the benefit of its for-profit franchises, the PSFL was one single corporation (the &quot;entity&quot; model of sports league organization) with limited partners operating the teams and performing many of the functions usually performed by team owners in the traditional model of North American professional sport organization. The idea was to eliminate weak financial teams as well as the potential for collusion as all players were contracted by the PSFL, and then assigned to individual teams.

==Ending==
Many sports leagues have folded before actually playing a game, but the PSFL probably got the closest to starting their season before the plug was pulled; each team had players already in camp and practicing, and rosters cut down to 60 players. On February 11, 1992, the Miami Tribe (who had actually played a game, an exhibition against the Miami Police Department team) disbanded after its equipment was seized as collateral against an unpaid hotel bill at training camp in Florida. Meanwhile, the Washington Marauders (whose entire operation, including equipment, was being run out of a single hotel room in Deland, Florida) stated they had sold only 100 season tickets, and also threatened to quit the league without more money. Finally, the end of the PSFL was announced by Lardner on February 19, just ten days before the scheduled season opener, after a needed cash infusion of $1 million did not surface. The league had over $7 million in escrow from ticket sales as funds were not to be spent until the games were played and revenues were earned. This protected fans and sponsors from losses or failure, and ticketholders received full refunds. The teams shut down all on the same day as all invoiced expenses were paid by the league headquarters. The PSFL tried to regroup for 1993 season, but again the start-up funding did not get secured and the league organization disbanded.

<text>Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin (20 November 1816 – 10 August 1893), also known as Reb Hirsch Leib Berlin, and commonly known by the acronym Netziv, was an Orthodox rabbi, rosh yeshiva (dean) of the Volozhin Yeshiva and author of several works of rabbinic literature in Lithuania.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
The Netziv was the eldest son of Yaakov Berlin, a merchant and Torah scholar in the city of Mir. His paternal lineage traces back to Rabbi Elchanan of Berlin, known as &quot;R&#x27; Elchanan Ba&#x27;al HaTosafot&quot; due to his profound Torah knowledge, comparable to that of the Tosafists. On his maternal side, his lineage goes back to Rabbi Meir Eisenstadt, author of the responsa &quot;Panim Meirot.&quot; Rabbi Sholom Schwadron recounted that in his youth, the Netziv struggled with his studies, and his father considered sending him to learn a trade. In response, the boy cried for a long time until the gates of wisdom were opened for him. Some of the Netziv&#x27;s family members strongly deny this story, and in another version, his brother-in-law and nephew, Rabbi Baruch Epstein, recounts in his book &quot;Mekor Baruch&quot; that during the period following the Netziv’s marriage, there were times when he felt despair and considered entering commerce. However, during this time, he formed scholarly connections with Rabbi David Luria, which greatly encouraged him. Rabbi Luria even gave him a haskamah (approbation) for the first part of his work, &quot;Haamek She&#x27;elah,&quot; which was published in 1855.

At the age of 11, the Netziv began studying at the Volozhin Yeshiva, and at 13 and a half, he was betrothed to Reina-Batya, the daughter of R&#x27; Yitzhak of Volozhin, head of the Volozhin Yeshiva. Upon marriage, the Netziv devoted himself to deep Torah study for about twenty-five years, where he became known for his dedication. The Netziv&#x27;s son, Rabbi Meir Bar-Ilan, recalls that at first, his father’s exceptional greatness was not widely known due to his humility. A correspondence between the Netziv and Rabbi Luria made R&#x27; Yitzchak of Volozhin aware of his greatness. From 1847 onward, the Netziv began delivering lectures at the Volozhin Yeshiva.

=== Head of the Volozhin Yeshiva ===

When his father-in-law died in 1849, his first son-in-law, R&#x27; Eliezer Yitzchak, was appointed as the head of the yeshiva, with the Netziv as his deputy. When R&#x27; Eliezer Yitzchak died young in 1853, the Netziv was appointed head of the yeshiva, with R&#x27; Joseph Dov Ber Soloveitchik as his deputy. The two served together for a time, but there were many disagreements and conflicts between them. The Netziv emphasized mastery and simplicity in study, while R&#x27; Joseph Dov preferred dialectical analysis and sharpness in reasoning. Four prominent rabbis of that generation, including R&#x27; Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor of Kovno, intervened in the dispute that threatened the yeshiva’s existence, ruling in favor of the Netziv, who continued to serve as the primary head of the yeshiva, with R&#x27; Joseph Dov as his deputy. The two served in this capacity for twelve years, during which conflicts periodically erupted between the Netziv’s students and those of R&#x27; Joseph Dov. After twelve years, R&#x27; Joseph Dov left to accept a rabbinic position in Brisk, and to prove that his departure was not due to the dispute, he married his son, Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik, to the Netziv’s granddaughter (the daughter of his son-in-law, Rabbi Refael Shapiro).
From 1853 until the yeshiva&#x27;s closure in 1892, the Netziv led the yeshiva with great dedication, as he wrote: Under the Netziv&#x27;s leadership, the yeshiva&#x27;s reputation grew, and the number of students increased from about 100 to more than 500. The character of the yeshiva was reflected in &quot;The Talmid&quot; written by Chaim Nachman Bialik, who had studied there.

In 1871, the Netziv&#x27;s wife, Reina-Batya, died. With her he had a son, R&#x27; Chaim Berlin. After her death, the Netziv married his niece, Batya Miriam Epstein, daughter of Rabbi Yechiel Michel Epstein (author of the &quot;Aruch HaShulchan&quot;), who was about thirty years younger than him. They had two sons, Rabbi Yaakov and Rabbi Meir Bar-Ilan.

In his later years, the Netziv strongly desired to move to Eretz Yisrael, and he sought to appoint his son, R&#x27; Chaim Berlin, the rabbi of Moscow, as his successor. However, some students opposed this and preferred Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik. This unrest eventually led to an informant reporting the &quot;poor functioning&quot; of the yeshiva to the authorities, which brought about the involvement of the Russian Minister of Education.

The Volozhin Yeshiva was ultimately closed due to the relentless pressure imposed by the Russian authorities on the Netziv. The prevailing narrative is that the Netziv chose to close the yeshiva rather than introduce the teaching of Russian language within its walls. However, he had agreed to allow the teaching of Russian outside the yeshiva, as he wrote: However, this did not satisfy the Russian Minister of Education, who, in 1891, demanded extensive secular studies from 9 AM to 3 PM, no studies in the evening, no more than ten hours of study per day, and that all yeshiva staff have diplomas. These demands were unacceptable to the Netziv, leading to the closure of the yeshiva.

When the yeshiva was closed in February 1892, the yeshiva&#x27;s leaders were expelled from the area. The closure, after the Netziv had invested his life into the yeshiva for 38 years, took a toll on his health, as did the concern over the 9,000 ruble debt left behind. His condition worsened to the point of paralysis. His poor health prevented him from fulfilling his dream of moving to Eretz Yisrael. A year and a half later, on the morning of August 10, 1893, he died in Warsaw. He was buried the next day in the Jewish Cemetery in Warsaw. Later, his son-in-law, Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik, was buried beside him.

His son, R&#x27; Chaim Berlin, served as the rabbi of Moscow, and after making aliyah to Eretz Yisrael following his father’s death, he became the rabbi of the Perushim community in Jerusalem after the death of R&#x27; Shmuel Salant. His other son, Rabbi Meir Bar-Ilan, became a prominent leader in Religious Zionism. The Ein HaNetziv kibbutz in the Beit She&#x27;an Valley is named in his honor, with three springs named after him: Ein Naftali, Ein Tzvi, and Ein Yehuda.

== His role in the Chibbat Tzion Movement ==
The Netziv was a great supporter of the settlement of Eretz Yisrael and an active member of the Chovevei Zion movement. He was convinced that the awakening for aliyah to Eretz Yisrael stemmed from a Divine plan for the redemption of Israel. These ideas, scattered throughout his writings, were expressed succinctly in two letters he sent in 1886 to the Chovevei Zion associations. He compared the secular youth leading the rebuilding of the land to the returnees of the Second Temple period under Ezra the Scribe, where many of the returnees were Shabbat desecrators and intermarried with non-Jews. However, he emphasized that the settlement of the land must be accompanied by the observance of mitzvot in general and especially the mitzvot dependent on the land, without which the entire endeavor would be unworthy.

Though the Netziv initially did not actively participate in the movement due to the heavy workload of the yeshiva, he gradually became involved until, at the Druskininkai Conference (1887), he was appointed one of the three &quot;advisory trustees&quot; to lead the movement. Later that year, they issued a circular letter to all community rabbis about establishing charity boxes to collect funds for the settlement of Eretz Yisrael. As part of his duties, the Netziv worked to instill religious values in the movement. In his letters, he pointed out &quot;flaws&quot; he observed in the movement&#x27;s activities and often aroused the anger of the secular leaders. For instance, when they wanted to appoint Yehuda Leib Pinsker as the head of the movement, he vehemently opposed the decision due to Pinsker’s distance from religion. His spirit was particularly stirred by reports of the secular behavior of the BILU pioneers who settled in Gederah. The Netziv demanded action be taken against them, even suggesting their removal from the settlement. Eventually, he retracted this demand.

At the &quot;Chovevei Zion&quot; convention in Vilnius in 1889, he was re-elected as an advisory trustee. At the beginning of 1891, he published his essay &quot;Acharit KeReshit&quot; (The End as the Beginning), calling for enlistment in the work of settling the land &quot;whether through material action — working the land or engaging in industry or commerce — or through spiritual action, that is, publishing beneficial books on this important subject.&quot; He also emphasized the obligation of Gedolei Yisrael to contribute to the process of the return to Zion.

All of the Netziv&#x27;s activities with the Chovevei Zion took place outside the walls of the yeshiva, which he considered a sacred institution devoted solely to Torah study. It was not without reason that secret Zionist societies were established within his yeshiva. The first, named &quot;Nes Tzionah,&quot; was founded in 1885 without his knowledge but was closed after the police discovered it. The second, named &quot;Netzach Yisrael,&quot; was founded in 1890 with his knowledge.

== Views on contemporary issues ==
The Netziv emphasized the importance of unity and opposed rabbis who called for the establishment of separate communities, as had been done in Hungary and Germany. When Orthodox leaders sought to promote this idea in Galicia, he wrote that their counsel was &quot;as harmful as swords to the body of the nation and its existence.&quot;

== His method in Torah study ==
The Netziv&#x27;s approach to Torah study was unique in its focus on Midrashic literature and the literature of the Geonim. His seminal work, &quot;Haamek She’elah,&quot; was written on the She&#x27;iltot of Rabbi Ahai Gaon of Shabha. His methodology closely aligned with the school of the Vilna Gaon (whose influence led to the founding of the Volozhin Yeshiva), making extensive use of textual emendations. While yeshiva study often focuses on theoretical learning detached from practical halachic rulings, the Netziv was also famous for answering halachic queries.

In the lengthy introductions to each part of &quot;Haamek She’elah,&quot; the Netziv outlined his approach to learning. Torah study, he explained, consists of two foundations: received tradition and dialectical reasoning (which he termed &quot;Esh-Dat&quot; — the &quot;dat&quot; being the tradition and the &quot;esh&quot; the fiery dialectic). The Geonim, being close to the Talmudic era, based all of their words on tradition (Kabbalah). In contrast, the Rishonim were compelled to derive their interpretations through reason and dialectic. The Netziv combined these two approaches in his study, striving to return to the foundations of the Geonim while supplementing them with the reasoning of the Rishonim. His understanding of halachic principles and laws was always underpinned by the She’iltot, Ba’al Ha’Itur, and the Rif.

His study of the early Rishonim led him to engage in textual criticism and to search for accurate manuscripts, where he demonstrated an impressive scientific rigor. In his quest for the most precise version of the She’iltot, he acquired various rare manuscripts.

== Writings ==
During his lifetime, his works &quot;Haamek She’elah&quot; on the She’iltot of Rabbi Ahai Gaon, his commentary Haamek Davar on the Torah, and &quot;Rinah Shel Torah&quot; on the Song of Songs were published. Additionally, he wrote a Responsa titled &quot;Meishiv Davar,&quot; and a collection of novellae on the Talmud called &quot;Meromei Sadeh&quot; (based on the verse &quot;And Naphtali is on the heights of the field,&quot; Judges 5:18), which were published posthumously. His sons, who published his responsa, refused to include a biographical introduction, as their father believed that such biographies constituted a Bitul Torah (distraction from Torah study) and were thus the &quot;counsel of the Yetzer Hara.&quot;

* His daughter, Drezel, who also married Rabbi Raphael Shapira after the death of her sister.
His first wife died in 1873 or 1874, after more than forty years of marriage.

After her death, he married Batya-Miriam (who died in Jerusalem in 1933), the daughter of his sister and his brother-in-law, Rabbi Yechiel Michel Epstein (author of the &quot;Aruch HaShulchan&quot;). She assisted him in managing the financial affairs of the Volozhin Yeshiva. Despite the significant age gap, she married him at the age of 28, driven by her desire to marry a Torah scholar. The couple had two children:
* Yaakov Berlin, named after his grandfather. His daughter, Tova Berlin-Papish, published her family memoirs in her book, &quot;&quot;From Mohilev to Jerusalem&quot;.&quot;

<text>Kaziranga National Park is a national park in the Golaghat, Sonitpur, Biswanath and Nagaon districts of the state of Assam, India. KNP has 5 ranges. The park, which hosts two-thirds of the world&#x27;s Indian rhinoceroses, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. According to a March 2018 census conducted jointly by the Forest Department of the Government of Assam and some recognized wildlife NGOs, the rhino population in Kaziranga National Park is 2,613. It comprises 1,641 adult rhinos and 385 calves.

In 2015, the rhino population stood at 2,401. Kaziranga National Park was declared a Tiger Reserve in 2006. The park is home to large breeding populations of elephants, wild water buffalo, and swamp deer. Kaziranga is recognized as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International for conservation of avifaunal species which refers as the birds or types of birds found in a specific region, period, or environment. When compared with other protected areas in India, Kaziranga has achieved notable success in wildlife conservation. Located on the edge of the Eastern Himalaya biodiversity hotspot, the park combines high species diversity and visibility.

Kaziranga is a vast expanse of tall elephant grass, marshland, and dense tropical moist broadleaf forests, criss-crossed by four major rivers, including the Brahmaputra, and the park includes numerous small bodies of water. Kaziranga has been the theme of several books, songs, and documentaries. The park celebrated its centennial in 2005 after its establishment in 1905 as a reserve forest.

==History of Kaziranga National Park==

The history of Kaziranga as a protected area can be traced back to 1904, when Mary Curzon, Baroness Curzon of Kedleston, the wife of the Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon of Kedleston, visited the area. After failing to see a single-horned rhinoceros, for which the area was renowned, she persuaded her husband to take urgent measures to protect the dwindling species which he did by initiating planning for their protection. On 1 June 1905, the Kaziranga Proposed Reserve Forest was created with an area of .

Over the next three years, the park area was extended by , to the banks of the Brahmaputra River. In 1908, Kaziranga was designated a &quot;Reserve Forest&quot;.

In 1916, it was redesignated the &quot;Kaziranga Game Sanctuary&quot; and remained so till 1938, when hunting was prohibited and visitors were permitted to enter the park.. In 1934 Kaziranga was changed to Kaziranha. A few people call it by its original name till today.

The Kaziranga Game Sanctuary was renamed the &quot;Kaziranga Wildlife Sanctuary&quot; in 1950 by P. D. Stracey, the forest conservationist, in order to rid the name of hunting connotations.

In 1954, the government of Assam passed the Assam (Rhinoceros) Bill, which imposed heavy penalties for rhinoceros poaching. Fourteen years later, in 1968, the state government passed the Assam National Park Act of 1968, declaring Kaziranga a designated national park. The park was given official status by the central government on 11 February 1974. In 1985, Kaziranga was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO for its unique natural environment.

Kaziranga has been the target of several natural and man-made calamities in recent decades including major floods. Floods caused by the overflow of the river Brahmaputra, leading to significant losses of animal life. In 2024, six dead rhinos along with hundreds of deer were tallied as drowned by the rising water. Encroachment by people along the periphery has also led to a diminished forest cover and a loss of habitat. An ongoing separatist movement in Assam led by the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) has crippled the economy of the region, but Kaziranga has remained unaffected by the movement; indeed, instances of rebels from the United Liberation Front of Assam protecting the animals and, in extreme cases, killing poachers, have been reported since the 1980s.

== Etymology ==

Although the etymology of the name Kaziranga is not certain, there exist a number of possible explanations derived from local legends and records. According to one legend, a girl named Rawnga, from a nearby village, and a youth named Kazi, from Karbi Anglong, fell in love. This match was not acceptable to their families, and the couple disappeared into the forest, never to be seen again, and the forest was named after them. According to another legend, Srimanta Sankardeva, the sixteenth-century Vaisnava saint-scholar, once blessed a childless couple, Kazi and Rangai, and asked them to dig a big pond in the region so that their name would live on.

Testimony to the long history of the name can be found in some records, which state that once, while the Ahom king Pratap Singha was passing by the region during the seventeenth century, he was particularly impressed by the taste of fish, and on asking was told it came from Kaziranga. Kaziranga also could mean the &quot;Land of red goats (Deer)&quot;, as the word &quot;Kazi&quot; in the Karbi language means &quot;goat&quot;, and &quot;Rangai&quot; means &quot;red&quot;.

Some historians believe, however, that the name Kaziranga was derived from the Karbi word &quot;Kajir-a-rong&quot;, which means &quot;the village of Kajir&quot; (&quot;kajiror gaon&quot;). Among the Karbis, Kajir is a common name for a girl child, and it was believed that a woman named Kajir once ruled over the area. Fragments of monoliths associated with Karbi rule found scattered in the area seem to bear testimony to this assertion.
== Geography ==
Kaziranga is located between latitudes 26°30&#x27; N and 26°45&#x27; N, and longitudes 93°08&#x27; E to 93°36&#x27; E within three districts in the Indian state of Assam—the Kaliabor subdivision of Nagaon district, Bokajan subdivision of Karbi Anglong and the Bokakhat subdivision of Golaghat district.

The park is approximately in length from east to west, and in breadth from north to south. Kaziranga covers an area of , with approximately lost to erosion in recent years. A total addition of along the present boundary of the park has been made and designated with separate national park status to provide extended habitat for increasing the population of wildlife or, as a corridor for safe movement of animals to Karbi Anglong Hills. Elevation ranges from to . The park area is circumscribed by the Brahmaputra River, which forms the northern and eastern boundaries, and the Mora Diphlu, which forms the southern boundary. Other notable rivers within the park are the Diphlu and Mora Dhansiri. 

Kaziranga has flat expanses of fertile, alluvial soil, formed by erosion and silt deposition by the River Brahmaputra. The landscape consists of exposed sandbars, riverine flood-formed lakes known as, &quot;beels&quot;, (which make up 5% of the surface area), and elevated regions known as, &quot;chapories&quot;, which provide retreats and shelter for animals during floods. Many artificial &quot;chapories&quot; have been built with the help of the Indian Army to ensure the safety of the animals. Kaziranga is one of the largest tracts of protected land in the sub-Himalayan belt, and due to the presence of highly diverse and visible species, has been described as a &quot;biodiversity hotspot&quot;. The park is located in the Indomalayan realm, and the dominant ecoregions of the region are Brahmaputra Valley semi-evergreen forests of the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome, and the frequently-flooded Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands of the tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome. Kaziranga is also surrounded by lush green tea plantations, most of them contributing heavily to Assam&#x27;s economy.

== Climate ==
The park experiences three seasons: summer, monsoon, and winter. The winter season, between November and February, is mild and dry, with a mean high of and low of . During this season, &quot;beels&quot; and &quot;nullahs&quot; (water channels) dry up. The summer season between March and May is hot, with temperatures reaching a high of . During this season, animals usually are found near water bodies. The rainy monsoon season lasts from June to September, and is responsible for most of Kaziranga&#x27;s annual rainfall of . During the peak months of July and August, three-fourths of the western region of the park is submerged, due to the rising water level of the Brahmaputra. Each time a flood comes, 70％~80％ percent of the national park is inundated for 5–10 days at a time. The flooding causes most animals to migrate to elevated and forested regions outside the southern border of the park, such as the Mikir hills. 540 animals, including 13 rhinos and mostly hog deer perished in unprecedented floods of 2012. However, occasional dry spells create problems as well, such as food shortages and occasional forest fires.

Seasonal variations in the vegetation and habitat of the animal is notable in the park. During winter the shallow beels and nullahs (small water channel) dry up and the growth of short grasses cover up their beds. The grasses also grow around the perennial beels. With the end of the monsoon season, herbivorous animals, especially the rhinoceros, rush into these areas for grazing.

In the other parts of the park the tall coarse grasses dry up by the month of December and January and are then control burnt by the park staff. After such burning some animals begin to concentrate in the burnt patches and relish the ash and the partially burnt stems of the reeds. With few winter showers fresh grass blades shoot up in the burnt patches attracting larger number of animals to these areas.

With the onset of the summer season the grasses in the burnt patches grow up quickly and the tender shoots turn into coarse blades, which no longer attract the animals. The temperature also goes up and the animals prefer to remain near the water sources especially around the numerous perennial beels and water streams inside the park.

During the monsoon, the shallow beels and the nullahs start to get filled up, firstly by the monsoon showers and later by the floodwaters. The animals gradually start moving towards higher grounds, which are situated around the tree forests. When the flood water covers most of the areas the animals migrate to the nearby Karbi Anglong Hills and other adjoining areas.

== Fauna ==

Kaziranga contains significant breeding populations of 35 mammalian species, of which 15 are threatened as per the IUCN Red List. The park has the distinction of being home to the world&#x27;s largest population of the Indian rhinoceros (2,401), wild water buffalo (1,666) and eastern swamp deer (468). Significant populations of large herbivores include Indian elephants (1,940), sambar (58). Small herbivores include the Indian muntjac, Indian boar and Indian hog deer. Kaziranga has the largest population of the Wild water buffalo anywhere accounting for about 57% of the world population. The Indian rhinoceros, royal Bengal tiger, Asian elephant, wild water buffalo and swamp deer are collectively known as &#x27;Big Five&#x27; of Kaziranga.

Kaziranga is one of the few wild breeding areas outside Africa for multiple species of large cats, such as Bengal tigers and Indian leopard. Kaziranga was declared a Tiger Reserve in 2006 . Other felids include the jungle cat, fishing cat and leopard cat. It is also the only place in India and the world, where a Golden tiger was spotted in the wild.

Small mammals include the rare hispid hare, Indian gray mongoose, small Indian mongooses, large Indian civet, small Indian civets, Bengal fox, golden jackal, sloth bear, Chinese pangolin, Indian pangolins, hog badger, Chinese ferret-badger, and particoloured flying squirrel. Nine of the 14 primate species found in India occur in the park. Prominent among them are the Assamese macaque, capped and golden langur, as well as the only ape found in India, the hoolock gibbon. The binturong and the Asian small-clawed otter were recorded in the park in the year 2024. Kaziranga&#x27;s rivers are also home to the endangered Ganges dolphin.

Kaziranga has been identified by Birdlife International as an Important Bird Area. It is home to a variety of migratory birds, water birds, predators, scavengers, and game birds. Birds such as the lesser white-fronted goose, ferruginous duck, Baer&#x27;s pochard duck and lesser adjutant, greater adjutant, black-necked stork, and Asian openbill stork migrate from Central Asia to the park during winter. Riverine birds include the Blyth&#x27;s kingfisher, white-bellied heron, Dalmatian pelican, spot-billed pelican, Nordmann&#x27;s greenshank, and black-bellied tern. Birds of prey include the rare eastern imperial, greater spotted, white-tailed, Pallas&#x27;s fish eagle, grey-headed fish eagle, and the lesser kestrel.

Kaziranga was once home to seven species of vultures, but the vulture population reached near extinction, supposedly by feeding on animal carcasses containing the drug Diclofenac. Only the Indian vulture, slender-billed vulture, and white-rumped vulture have survived. Game birds include the swamp francolin, Bengal florican, and pale-capped pigeon.

Other families of birds inhabiting Kaziranga include the great pied hornbill and wreathed hornbill, Old World babblers such as Jerdon&#x27;s and marsh babblers, weaver birds such as the common baya weaver, threatened Finn&#x27;s weavers, and bristled grassbird. Other threatened species include the black-breasted parrotbill

Two of the largest snakes in the world, the reticulated python and Indian rock python, as well as the longest venomous snake in the world, the king cobra, inhabit the park. Other snakes found here include the Indian cobra, monocled cobra, Russell&#x27;s viper, and the common krait. Monitor lizard species found in the park include the Bengal monitor and the Asian water monitor. Other reptiles include fifteen species of turtle, such as the endemic Assam roofed turtle and one species of tortoise, the brown tortoise. 42 species of fish are found in the area, including the &quot;Tetraodon&quot;.

== Flora ==

Four main types of vegetation exist in this park. These are alluvial inundated grasslands, alluvial savanna woodlands, tropical moist mixed deciduous forests, and tropical semi-evergreen forests. Based on Landsat data for 1986, percent coverage by vegetation is: tall grasses 41%, short grasses 11%, open jungle 29%, swamps 4%, rivers and water bodies 8%, and sand 6%.

There is a difference in altitude between the eastern and western areas of the park, with the western side being at a lower altitude. The western reaches of the park are dominated by grasslands. Tall elephant grass is found on higher ground, while short grasses cover the lower grounds surrounding the beels or flood-created ponds. Annual flooding, grazing by herbivores, and controlled burning maintain and fertilize the grasslands and reeds. Common tall grasses are sugarcanes, spear grass, elephant grass, and the common reed. Numerous forbs are present along with the grasses. Amidst the grasses, providing cover and shade are scattered trees—dominant species including kumbhi, Indian gooseberry, the cotton tree (in savanna woodlands), and elephant apple (in inundated grasslands).

Thick evergreen forests, near the Kanchanjhuri, Panbari, and Tamulipathar blocks, contain trees such as &quot;Aphanamixis polystachya&quot;, &quot;Talauma hodgsonii&quot;, &quot;Dillenia indica&quot;, &quot;Garcinia tinctoria&quot;, &quot;Ficus rumphii&quot;, &quot;Cinnamomum bejolghota&quot;, and species of &quot;Syzygium&quot;. Tropical semi-evergreen forests are present near Baguri, Bimali, and Haldibari. Common trees and shrubs are &quot;Albizia procera&quot;, &quot;Duabanga grandiflora&quot;, &quot;Lagerstroemia speciosa&quot;, &quot;Crateva unilocularis&quot;, &quot;Sterculia urens&quot;, &quot;Grewia serrulata&quot;, &quot;Mallotus philippensis&quot;, &quot;Bridelia retusa&quot;, &quot;Aphania rubra&quot;, &quot;Leea indica&quot;, and &quot;Leea umbraculifera&quot;.

There are many different aquatic floras in the lakes and ponds, and along the river shores. The invasive water hyacinth is very common, often choking the water bodies, but it is cleared during destructive floods. Another invasive species, &quot;Mimosa invisa&quot;, which is toxic to herbivores, was cleared by Kaziranga staff with help from the Wildlife Trust of India in 2005.

The Wildlife wing of the forest department of the Government of Assam, headquartered at Bokakhat, is responsible for the administration and management of Kaziranga. The administrative head of the park is the director, who is a Chief Conservator of Forests-level officer. A divisional Forest Officer is the administrative chief executive of the park. He is assisted by two officers with the rank of Assistant Conservator of Forests. The park area is divided into five ranges, overseen by Range Forest Officers. The five ranges are the Burapahar (HQ: Ghorakati), Western (HQ: Baguri), Central (HQ: Kohora), Eastern (HQ: Agaratoli) and Northern (HQ: Biswanath). Each range is further sub-divided into beats, headed by a forester, and sub-beats, headed by a forest guard.

The park receives financial aid from the State Government as well as the Ministry of Environment, Forests &amp; Climate Change of Government of India under various Plan and Non-Plan Budgets. Additional funding is received under the Project Elephant from the Central Government. Most of this funding is used in paying wages and salaries of the staff and in anti-poaching measures, only a little sum is left behind for the development of the park. In spite of the funding from the government the park faces shortage of funds. In 1997–1998, a grant of US$ 100,000 was received under the Technical Co-operation for Security Reinforcement scheme from the World Heritage Fund. Additional funding is also received from national and international Non-governmental organizations.

There are three dirt tracks inside the park corresponding to the three forest ranges of the park for patrolling and to view wildlife by the tourists. The Central or Kaziranga range with Kohora as the entry point covers the Daglang and Foliomari area. Some part of this range is the &quot;Core Zone&quot; of the Tiger Reserve or a Strict Nature Reserve, where casual visitors are not permitted. The Western range has Baguri as the entry point and covers the Monabeel, Bimoli, Kanchanjuri areas. This range is preferred for seeing big game like rhinos and water buffaloes. The Eastern range with Agortoli as the entry point covers Sohola and Rangamatia. This is from Kohora and is preferred for birding.

Local people get employment from the park in the form of labour and allied activities. Labour requirements for the park include labour for anti-poaching activities and construction of bridges, culverts, etc. Approximately 100 to 200 people are hired per range for removal of Mimosa, a weed which is harmful for the herbivores. As of 2007 the park authorities have also hired security guards to protect the tourist jeeps inside the park. The park has developed a very good network of intelligence throughout the villages surrounding the park. There are key informants in every village, which reports about the movement of poachers and are monetarily compensated for information they provide to the park authorities.

== Conservation management ==


Kaziranga National Park has been granted maximum protection under the Indian law for wildlife conservation. Various laws, which range in dates from the &quot;Assam Forest Regulation of 1891&quot; and the &quot;Biodiversity Conservation Act of 2002&quot; have been enacted for protection of wildlife in the park. Poaching activities, particularly of the rhinoceroses for its horn, has been a major concern for the authorities. Between 1980 and 2005, 567 rhinoceroses were hunted by poachers. Following a decreasing trend for the past few years, 18 Indian rhinoceroses were killed by poachers in 2007. Reports have suggested that there are links between these poaching activities and funding of terrorist organizations. But these could not be substantiated in later years.
Preventive measures such as construction of anti-poaching camps and maintenance of existing ones, patrolling, intelligence gathering, and control over the use of firearms around the park have reduced the number of casualties. Since 2013, the park used cameras on drones which are monitored by security guards to protect the rhino from armed poachers.
Perennial flooding and heavy rains have resulted in the death of wild animals and damage to the conservation infrastructures. To escape the water-logged areas, many animals migrate to elevated regions outside the park boundaries where they are susceptible to hunting, hit by speeding vehicles, or subject to reprisals by villagers for damaging their crops. To mitigate the losses, the authorities have increased patrols, purchased additional speedboats for patrol, and created artificial highlands for shelter. Several corridors have been set up for the safe passage of animals across National Highway–37 which skirts around the southern boundary of the park. To prevent the spread of diseases and to maintain the genetic distinctness of the wild species, systematic steps such as immunization of livestock in surrounding villages and fencing of sensitive areas of the park, which are susceptible to encroachment by local cattle, are undertaken periodically.

Water pollution due to run-off from pesticides from tea gardens, and run-off from a petroleum refinery at Numaligarh, pose a hazard to the ecology of the region. Invasive species such as Mimosa and wild rose have posed a threat to the native plants in the region. To control the growth and irradiation of invasive species, research on biological methods for controlling weeds, manual uprooting and weeding before seed settling are carried out at regular intervals. Grassland management techniques, such as controlled burning, are effected annually to avoid forest fires.

== Visitor activities ==


Observing the wildlife, including birding, is the main visitor activity in and around the park. Guided tours by elephant or Jeep are available. Hiking is prohibited in the park to avoid potential human-animal conflicts. Observation towers are situated at Sohola, Mihimukh, Kathpara, Foliamari, and Harmoti for wildlife viewing. The snow-covered Lower Himalayan peaks frame the park&#x27;s landscape of trees and grass interspersed with numerous ponds. An interpretation centre is at the Bagori range of Kaziranga to help visitors learn more about the park. The park remains closed for visitors from May to October due to monsoon rains.

Four tourist lodges at Kohora and three tourist lodges outside the park are maintained by the Department of Environment and Forests, Government of Assam. Private resorts are available outside the park borders. Increase in tourist inflow has led to the economic empowerment of the people living at the fringes of the park, by means of tourism related activities, encouraging a recognition of the value of its protection. A survey of tourists notes that 80 percent found rhino sightings most enjoyable and that foreign tourists were more likely to support park protection and employment opportunities financially, while local tourists favored support for veterinary services. Recently set up Kaziranga National Orchid and Biodiversity Park established at Durgapur village is a latest attraction to the tourists. It houses more than 500 species of orchids, 132 varieties of sour fruits and leafy vegetables, 12 species of cane, 46 species of bamboo and a large varieties of local fishes.

Tourism benefits the people living in the fringe of the park and helps in empowering the local people. As of 2007, about 35 hotels or lodges of various kinds located just outside the park, four of which run by the government. They employ about 300 people. Some families also offer home stay facilities just outside the park so that the tourists may get a taste of the local life and host can drive and guide visitors into the park. There are also 26 shops selling souvenirs and locally handmade woven cloth that are owned and/or managed by local community members. The Ministry of Tourism, Government of India and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) jointly support rural tourism in village of Durgapur, which falls in the periphery of the Kohora range of Kaziranga along with other initiatives at 31 sites across India.

== Transport ==

Authorised guides of the forest department accompany all travelers inside the park. Mahout-guided elephant rides and Jeep or other 4WD vehicles rides are booked in advance. Starting from the Park Administrative Centre at Kohora, these rides can follow the three motorable trails under the jurisdiction of three ranges—Kohora, Bagori, and Agaratoli. These trails are open for light vehicles from November to April. Visitors willing to view wild life by motorcars are guided through these roads by the staff of this department. Visitors are allowed to take their own vehicles when accompanied by guides.

Buses owned by Assam State Transport Corporation and private agencies between Guwahati, Tezpur, and Upper Assam stop at the main gate of Kaziranga on NH 37 at Kohora. The nearest town is Bokakhat, Golaghat situated at 23 km and 65 km away. Major cities near the park are Guwahati, Dimapur and Jorhat . Furkating , which is under the supervision of Northeast Frontier Railway, is the nearest railway station. Jorhat Airport at Rowriah ( away), Tezpur Airport at Salonibari ( away), Dimapur Airport and Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport in Guwahati ( away) are the nearby airports. Transportation is also available from Guwahati to Kaziranga National Park and other places in Assam and Nagaland.

== In popular culture ==
Kaziranga has been the theme of, or has been mentioned in, several books, songs, and documentaries. The park first gained international prominence after Robin Banerjee, a physician-turned-photographer and filmmaker, produced a documentary titled &quot;Kaziranga&quot;, which was aired on television in Berlin in 1961 and became a runaway success. American science fiction and fantasy author, L. Sprague de Camp wrote about the park in his poem, &quot;Kaziranga, Assam&quot;. It was first published in 1970 in &quot;Demons and Dinosaurs&quot;, a poetry collection, and was reprinted as &quot;Kaziranga&quot; in &quot;Years in the Making: the Time-Travel Stories of L. Sprague de Camp&quot; in 2005.

&quot;Kaziranga Trail&quot; (Children&#x27;s Book Trust, 1979), a children&#x27;s storybook by Arup Dutta about rhinoceros poaching in the national park, won the Shankar&#x27;s Award. The Assamese singer Bhupen Hazarika refers to Kaziranga in one of his songs. The BBC conservationist and travel writer, Mark Shand, authored a book and the corresponding BBC documentary &quot;Queen of the Elephants&quot;, based on the life of the first female mahout in recent times—Parbati Barua of Kaziranga. The book went on to win the 1996 Thomas Cook Travel Book Award and the Prix Litteraire d&#x27;Amis, providing publicity simultaneously to the profession of mahouts as well as to Kaziranga.

== Controversy ==
In 2017, Kaziranga came under severe criticism after a BBC News documentary revealed a hardliner strategy to conservation, reporting the killing of 20 people a year in the name of rhino conservation. As a consequence of this reporting, BBC News was banned from filming in protected areas in India for 5 years. While several news reports claimed that BBC had apologized for the documentary, the BBC stood by its report, with its director general, Tony Hall, writing in a letter to Survival International that &quot;the letter &#x27;in no way constitutes an apology for our journalism. As a response to the report, researchers in India have provided more nuanced understanding of the matter, calling out BBC for the carelessness of its journalism, but also pointing to the problems of conservation in Kaziranga and questioning whether shoot-at-sight has been a useful conservation strategy at all.

== Economic valuation ==
Kaziranga Tiger Reserve estimated its annual flow benefits to be 9.8 billion rupees (0.95 lakh / hectare). Important ecosystem services included habitat and refugia for wildlife (5.73 billion), gene-pool protection (3.49 billion), recreation value (21 million), biological
control (150 million) and sequestration of carbon (17 million).

<text>Acton Central is a station on the Mildmay line of the London Overground, situated between and stations in Travelcard Zone 3. 

The station is located at the point where Mildmay line trains switch their power supply from overhead line equipment (25 kV AC) to third rail shoes (750 V DC), or vice versa, depending on direction of travel (overhead line is used to Stratford, while third rail is used to Richmond).

==History==

The station was opened as &quot;Acton&quot; on 1 August 1853 by the North and South Western Junction Railway (N&amp;SWJR), but was renamed &quot;Acton Central&quot; on 1 November 1925. The N&amp;SWJR was leased jointly to the London and North Western Railway (LNWR), the Midland Railway (MR) and the North London Railway (NLR) from 1871, but only the NLR operated passenger trains on the N&amp;SWJR until operation of the NLR (and thus of the N&amp;SWJR also) was taken over by the LNWR in 1909. Under the terms of the Railways Act 1921, the LNWR and MR amalgamated (together with some others) at the start of 1923 to form the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, which then absorbed both the NLR and the N&amp;SWJR. The line then passed on to the London Midland Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948.

When sectorisation was introduced, the station was served by Network SouthEast until the privatisation of British Rail.

Between 1875 and 1902 it was connected with via the Dudding Hill line, which branches off the North London line between Acton Central and Willesden Junction. Harlesden (Midland) railway station was the next stop on the line north. The Dudding Hill line is still open today, but only carries freight.

Acton Central station was named for closure by the 1963 Beeching Report, also known as the Beeching Axe.

Acton Central was in Zone 2 until 2 January 2008.

In 2011, the platforms were lengthened to allow longer trains.

<text>On 4 June 1967, a Canadair C-4 Argonaut passenger aircraft owned by British Midland Airways operating as British Midland Flight 542 crashed near the centre of Stockport, Cheshire, England. Of the 84 people on board, 72 were killed. It is the fourth-worst accident in British aviation history.

==Accident==
The aircraft, registered had been chartered by Arrowsmith Holidays Ltd and had left Palma de Mallorca at 5:00 am, carrying holidaymakers back from the Balearic Islands to Manchester Airport. The approach controller vectored the aircraft towards the ILS as soon as it reached the Congleton NDB, but the pilots were apparently unable to put the aircraft on the extended runway centreline and called an overshoot. As the aircraft was making a second approach to the airport, the No. 3 and 4 engines suddenly cut out over Stockport. The No. 4 propeller was feathered, but No. 3 kept windmilling. The aircraft became uncontrollable and crashed at 10:09 am local time in a small open area at Hopes Carr, close to the town centre.

Despite the crash occurring in a densely populated area, there were no fatalities on the ground. Members of the public and police risked harm to save 12 people from the mangled debris. However, a fire started towards the rear of the aircraft after the fuel tanks had ruptured and worked back through the cabin, engulfing and killing most of the fuel-soaked passengers.
As it was a Sunday and most people were not at work, the accident drew a large crowd, estimated at 10,000, hampering the rescue organisations.

==Investigation==
Investigators with the Accidents Investigation Branch (AIB) determined that the double engine failure had been caused by fuel starvation, due to a previously unrecognised flaw in the model&#x27;s fuel system. The Argonaut had eight fuel tanks, divided into pairs. Each pair fed one engine, but there was also a cross-feed system that allowed fuel from a pair of tanks to be fed to other engines, if necessary. It was found that the selectors controlling the cross-feed valves were poorly placed in the cockpit, and difficult to operate, also giving an unclear indication of what was selected. This could cause the inadvertent selection of cross-feed from some pairs of tanks, leading to the exhaustion of fuel in those tanks and the failure of the associated engine.

These problems had been noticed by pilots of other Argonauts before, but neither British Midland nor the other airlines using the Argonaut (Trans-Canada Airlines and Canadian Pacific Airlines) had reported it to the manufacturer. Without this information, the AIB believed that it would have been extremely difficult for the pilots of G-ALHG to determine the exact nature of the emergency.

A fuel problem had been noted on the aircraft five days earlier, but this did not come to light until four months after the crash. A third contributory factor was fatigue: the captain had been on duty for nearly 13 hours. This was within legal and operational limits, but the inquiry noted that he had made several errors in repeating ATC messages.

The AIB also examined passenger and crew survivability during the accident. Post-mortem examinations on the passengers showed that those in the very front of the fuselage had been killed by rapid deceleration injuries, but those further aft had suffered massive crushing injuries to their lower legs that stopped them from escaping the burning wreckage. Investigators found that the bracing bars meant to keep the rows of seats separate were too weak to stop the rows from collapsing together like a concertina, and determined that had the bars been adequately strong, most of the passengers would have been able to escape the aircraft.

Harry Marlow, the captain, survived but had amnesia and did not remember the accident, and the first officer died. The aircraft was over an open area at the time the starboard engines cut out, and AIB investigators believed that it became completely uncontrollable after the loss of power. There was testimony from witnesses that it made a pronounced turn to port and levelled out before descending into the crash site. This suggests that Marlow exerted a degree of control and successfully avoided hitting houses.

==Legacy==

In 1998, a memorial plaque was unveiled by two survivors at the scene of the accident. In 2002, a campaign was launched to create a further memorial at the site, commemorating the rescuers who risked their lives to pull survivors from the burning aeroplane; the campaign was supported by the then Prime Minister Tony Blair. The second memorial was unveiled that October.

A service was held in 2007 to mark the 40th anniversary. On 4 June 2017, the 50th anniversary of the crash (and also a Sunday), a service was led at the time and place of the crash by the Bishop of Stockport, Libby Lane, and new information boards were unveiled giving details of the crash and the names of those who died. Ian Barrie, an aviation expert, and Roger Boden produced a documentary, &quot;Six Miles from Home&quot;, for the 50th anniversary.

<doc id="800092" wikidata="Q3912012" url="?curid=800092" title="Category of groups">
<text>In mathematics, the category Grp (or Gp) has the class of all groups for objects and group homomorphisms for morphisms. As such, it is a concrete category. The study of this category is known as group theory.

==Relation to other categories==
There are two forgetful functors from Grp, M: Grp → Mon from groups to monoids and U: Grp → Set from groups to sets. M has two adjoints: one right, I: Mon→Grp, and one left, K: Mon→Grp. I: Mon→Grp is the functor sending every monoid to the submonoid of invertible elements and K: Mon→Grp the functor sending every monoid to the Grothendieck group of that monoid. The forgetful functor U: Grp → Set has a left adjoint given by the composite KF: Set→Mon→Grp, where F is the free functor; this functor assigns to every set &quot;S&quot; the free group on &quot;S.&quot;

==Categorical properties==
The monomorphisms in Grp are precisely the injective homomorphisms, the epimorphisms are precisely the surjective homomorphisms, and the isomorphisms are precisely the bijective homomorphisms.

The category Grp is both complete and co-complete. The category-theoretical product in Grp is just the direct product of groups while the category-theoretical coproduct in Grp is the free product of groups. The zero objects in Grp are the trivial groups (consisting of just an identity element).

Every morphism &quot;f&quot; : &quot;G&quot; → &quot;H&quot; in Grp has a category-theoretic kernel (given by the ordinary kernel of algebra ker f = {&quot;x&quot; in &quot;G&quot; | &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;e&quot;}), and also a category-theoretic cokernel (given by the factor group of &quot;H&quot; by the normal closure of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) in &quot;H&quot;). Unlike in abelian categories, it is not true that every monomorphism in Grp is the kernel of its cokernel.

===Not additive and therefore not abelian===
The category of abelian groups, Ab, is a full subcategory of Grp. Ab is an abelian category, but Grp is not. Indeed, Grp isn&#x27;t even an additive category, because there is no natural way to define the &quot;sum&quot; of two group homomorphisms. A proof of this is as follows: The set of morphisms from the symmetric group &quot;S&quot;3 of order three to itself, formula_1, has ten elements: an element &quot;z&quot; whose product on either side with every element of &quot;E&quot; is &quot;z&quot; (the homomorphism sending every element to the identity), three elements such that their product on one fixed side is always itself (the projections onto the three subgroups of order two), and six automorphisms. If Grp were an additive category, then this set &quot;E&quot; of ten elements would be a ring. In any ring, the zero element is singled out by the property that 0&quot;x&quot;=&quot;x&quot;0=0 for all &quot;x&quot; in the ring, and so &quot;z&quot; would have to be the zero of &quot;E&quot;. However, there are no two nonzero elements of &quot;E&quot; whose product is &quot;z&quot;, so this finite ring would have no zero divisors. A finite ring with no zero divisors is a field by Wedderburn&#x27;s little theorem, but there is no field with ten elements because every finite field has for its order, the power of a prime.

===Exact sequences===
The notion of exact sequence is meaningful in Grp, and some results from the theory of abelian categories, such as the nine lemma, the five lemma, and their consequences hold true in Grp. 

Grp is a regular category.

<doc id="800094" wikidata="Q106099" url="?curid=800094" title="Jeanne Moreau">
<text>Jeanne Moreau (; 23 January 1928 – 31 July 2017) was a French actress, singer, screenwriter, director, and socialite. She made her theatrical debut in 1947, and established herself as one of the leading actresses of the Comédie-Française. Moreau began playing small roles in films in 1949, later achieving prominence with a starring role in Louis Malle&#x27;s &quot;Elevator to the Gallows&quot; (1958). She was most prolific during the 1960s, winning the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress for &quot;Seven Days... Seven Nights&quot; (1960) and the BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actress for &quot;Viva Maria!&quot; (1965), with additional prominent roles in &quot;La Notte&quot; (1961), &quot;Jules et Jim&quot; (1962), and &quot;Le journal d&#x27;une femme de chambre&quot; (1964).

Moreau worked as a director on several films beginning with 1976&#x27;s &quot;Lumière&quot;. She continued to act into the 2010s, winning the César Award for Best Actress for &quot;The Old Lady Who Walked in the Sea&quot; (1992) and receiving several lifetime achievement awards, including a BAFTA Fellowship in 1996, a Cannes Golden Palm in 2003, and another César Award in 2008. Her collaborator and friend Orson Welles called her &quot;the greatest actress in the world&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Moreau was born in Paris, the daughter of Katherine (née Buckley), a dancer who performed at the Folies Bergère (d. 1990), and Anatole-Désiré Moreau, a restaurateur (d. 1975). Moreau&#x27;s father was French; her mother was English, a native of Oldham, Lancashire, England and of part Irish descent. Moreau&#x27;s father was Catholic and her mother, originally a Protestant, converted to Catholicism upon marriage. When Jeanne was a young girl, &quot;the family moved south to Vichy, spending vacations at the paternal ancestral village of Mazirat, a town of 30 houses in a valley in the Allier. &quot;It was wonderful there&quot;, Moreau said. &quot;Every tombstone in the cemetery was for a Moreau&quot;. During World War II, the family was split, and Moreau lived with her mother in Paris. Moreau ultimately lost interest in school and, at age 16, after attending a performance of Jean Anouilh&#x27;s &quot;Antigone&quot;, found her calling as an actor. She later studied at the Conservatoire de Paris. Her parents separated permanently while Moreau was at the conservatory and her mother, &quot;after 24 difficult years in France, returned to England with Jeanne&#x27;s sister, Michelle.&quot;

== Career ==
In 1947, Moreau made her theatrical debut at the Avignon Festival. She debuted at the Comédie-Française in Ivan Turgenev&#x27;s &quot;A Month in the Country&quot; and, by her 20s, was already one of the leading actresses in the theatre&#x27;s troupe. After 1949, she began appearing in films with small parts but continued primarily active in the theatre for several years — a year at the Théâtre National Populaire opposite among others Gérard Philipe and Robert Hirsch, then a breakout two years in dual roles in &quot;The Dazzling Hour&quot; by Anna Bonacci, then Jean Cocteau&#x27;s &quot;La Machine Infernale&quot; and others before another two-year run, this time in Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Pygmalion&quot;. From the late 1950s, after appearing in several successful films, she began to work with the emerging generation of French film-makers. &quot;Elevator to the Gallows&quot; (1958) with first-time director Louis Malle was followed by Malle&#x27;s &quot;The Lovers&quot; (&quot;Les Amants&quot;, 1959).

Moreau went on to work with many of the best known New Wave and avant-garde directors. François Truffaut&#x27;s New Wave film &quot;Jules et Jim&quot; (1962), her biggest success internationally, is centered on her magnetic starring role. She also worked with a number of other notable directors such as Michelangelo Antonioni (&quot;La notte&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Clouds&quot;), Orson Welles (&quot;The Trial&quot;, &quot;Chimes at Midnight&quot; and &quot;The Immortal Story&quot;), Luis Buñuel (&quot;Diary of a Chambermaid&quot;), Elia Kazan (&quot;The Last Tycoon&quot;), Rainer Werner Fassbinder (&quot;Querelle&quot;), Wim Wenders (&quot;Until the End of the World&quot;), Carl Foreman (&quot;Champion&quot; and &quot;The Victors&quot;), and Manoel de Oliveira &quot;(Gebo et l&#x27;Ombre)&quot;.

In 1983, she was head of the jury at the 33rd Berlin International Film Festival. In 2005, she was awarded with the Stanislavsky Award at the 27th Moscow International Film Festival.

Moreau was also a vocalist. She released several albums and once performed with Frank Sinatra at Carnegie Hall in 1984. In addition to acting, Moreau worked behind the camera as a writer, director and producer. Her accomplishments were the subject of the film &quot;Calling the Shots&quot; (1988) by Janis Cole and Holly Dale. She appeared in Rosa von Praunheim&#x27;s film &quot;Fassbinder&#x27;s Women&quot; (2000).

== Personal life ==
Throughout her life, Moreau maintained friendships with prominent writers such as Jean Cocteau, Jean Genet, Henry Miller, and Marguerite Duras (an interview with Moreau is included in Duras&#x27;s book &quot;Outside: Selected Writings&quot;). She formerly was married to Jean-Louis Richard (1949–1964, separated in 1951), and then to American film director William Friedkin (1977–1979). She and Richard had a son, Jérôme. Director Tony Richardson left his wife Vanessa Redgrave for her in 1967, but they never married. She also had relationships with directors Louis Malle and François Truffaut, fashion designer Pierre Cardin, and the Greek actor/playboy Theodoros Roubanis.

In 1971, Jeanne Moreau was a signatory of the Manifesto of the 343 which publicly announced that she had obtained an illegal abortion.

Moreau was a close friend of Sharon Stone, who presented a 1998 American Academy of Motion Pictures life tribute to Moreau at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater, academy headquarters, in Beverly Hills. Orson Welles called Moreau &quot;the greatest actress in the world&quot;, and she remained one of France&#x27;s most accomplished actresses.

In 2009, Moreau signed a petition in support of director Roman Polanski, who had been detained while traveling to a film festival in relation to his 1977 sexual abuse charges, which the petition argued would undermine the tradition of film festivals as a place for works to be shown &quot;freely and safely&quot;, and that arresting filmmakers traveling to neutral countries could open the door &quot;for actions of which no-one can know the effects&quot;.

Moreau died on 31 July 2017 at her home in Paris at the age of 89. Her body was discovered by her cleaning maid. Shortly before her death, she had said she felt &quot;abandoned&quot; because she could not act anymore.

<text>André Martinet (; 12 April 1908 – 16 July 1999) was a French linguist, influential due to his work on structural linguistics. In linguistic theory, Martinet is known especially for his studies on linguistic economy and double articulation.

==Life and work==
Martinet passed his in English and received his doctorate after submitting, as is traditional in France, two theses: and . From 1938 to 1946 he served as a director of studies of the École pratique des hautes études (EPHE). After World War II he moved to New York City, where he remained until 1955.

In New York, he directed the International Auxiliary Language Association up to the end of 1948 and taught at Columbia University, where he served as chair of the department from 1947 to 1955. Also, he became editor of &quot;Word&quot;, a linguistics journal. In 1955, he returned to his position at EPHE and took up a chair in general linguistics at the Sorbonne, and then at Paris V. He continued to be active professionally by serving as president of the European Linguistic Society and founding both the Society for Functional Linguistics and the journal .

The Prague School of linguistics was one of Martinet&#x27;s main influences, and he is known for pioneering a functionalist approach to syntax, which led to a violent polemic with Noam Chomsky. He wrote over twenty books on topics ranging from historical linguistics (, 1955) to general linguistic theory. His most widely known work, (1960) has been translated into 17 languages and has influenced a generation of students, both in France and abroad.

Other works include &quot;General Syntax&quot; (1985), &quot;The Function and Dynamics of Language&quot; (1989), and an intellectual autobiography entitled &quot;Memories of a Linguist and the Life of Language&quot;.

==Personal life==
Martinet was married twice:
* To Karen Martinet (née Mikkelsen Sørensen)
* To Jeanne Martinet (née Allard).

<text>Catford railway station is one of two stations in the London suburb of Catford. Mainly used by commuters, it is in Travelcard Zone 3 and on the Catford Loop Line between and . It is served mainly by Thameslink trains between , and Sevenoaks. Connections to London Victoria are available at Peckham Rye. Catford is measured from Victoria.

It is adjacent to, and on a higher level than, Catford Bridge railway station on the Mid-Kent Line. The two stations are separated by the site of the former Catford Stadium. Interchange on one ticket is allowed between the two stations.

There is only a small shelter, a ticket machine, a few lamp-posts and a stairway on each of the two otherwise bare platforms, unlike the more ornate Catford Bridge station, which has retained most of its original architecture. Each platform has customer information screens.

==Services==

All services at Catford are operated by Thameslink using Class 700 EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:

* 2 tph to London Blackfriars
* 2 tph to via 

During the peak hours, additional services between , and call at the station. In addition, the service to London Blackfriars is extended to and from via .

==1945 derailment==
On 23 September 1945, a Victoria to Ramsgate train derailed on its approach to the station, much of it falling down the embankment towards Catford Stadium. One passenger was killed, and many others were injured (the train had been carrying 377 passengers). The enquiry concluded that it was probably caused by an unnoticed track defect that perhaps arose from heavy rainfall in the preceding days.

== In the media ==
The second episode of the 1979 London Weekend Television comedy series &quot;End of Part One&quot; includes the main characters watching a film called &quot;The Life of Christopher Columbus&quot;. In the film, Columbus goes to a tube station and asks for a train to America, but is told he can only go as far as Catford. Part of a modified tube map is shown with the fictitious tube stations &quot;Lewisham&quot;, &quot;Ladywell&quot;, &quot;Edge of the World&quot; and &quot;Catford&quot; on the East London section of the Metropolitan line south from New Cross tube station. This is based on the main line railway line serving Catford Bridge railway station.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 75, 124, 171, 181, 185, 202, 284 and night route N171 serve the station.

<text>Catford Bridge railway station is on the Mid-Kent Line, serving Hayes line trains from London to Hayes. It lies between Ladywell and Lower Sydenham stations, from and in Travelcard Zone 3. It is adjacent to (and on a lower level than) Catford railway station (from which it is separated by the former Catford Stadium site) on the Catford loop line. The station entrance is on Catford Road, a part of the South Circular Road (A205), and has brick buildings on both platforms, though the up side building is no longer in use by the railway. The station is managed by Southeastern, who operate all trains serving it.

==History==
===Early years (1857-1922)===

The Mid Kent line was built by the Mid-Kent and North Kent Junction Railway (MK&amp;NKJR) and was opened on 1 January 1857 as far as Beckenham Junction (although it was not technically a junction as the West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway&#x27;s line did not open until 3 May 1858).

From opening the line was worked by the South Eastern Railway (SER). On opening Catford Bridge was provided with a small goods yard on the up side north of the platform.

Seven years later the MK&amp;NKJR built an extension from a new junction station at New Beckenham to Croydon (Addiscombe Road) which again was operated by the SER.

Almost all services from the station have terminated at Charing Cross or Cannon Street stations but between 1880 and 1884 a service worked between Croydon (Addiscombe Road) calling all stations to New Cross and then via a connection to the East London Line and terminating at Liverpool Street station.

In 1898 the South Eastern Railway and its bitter rivals the London Chatham and Dover Railway agreed to work as one railway company under the name of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway and Catford Bridge became an SECR station.

===Southern Railway (1923-1947)===

Following the Railways Act 1921 (also known as the Grouping Act), Catford Bridge became a Southern Railway station on 1 January 1923.

The Mid-Kent line was electrified with the (750 V DC) third rail system and electric services commenced on 28 February 1926. Early electric services were worked by early Southern Railway 3-car Electric Multiple Unit trains often built from old SECR carriages.

Between 1927 and 1935 speculative house building west of the station saw an increase in commuter numbers.

===British Railways (1948-1994)===
After World War II and following nationalisation on 1 January 1948, the station fell under the auspices of British Railways Southern Region.

The goods yard closed to general traffic on 28 December 1964 and to coal on 25 March 1968.
Colour light signalling was introduced between Ladywell and New Beckenham on 4 April 1971 with signalling being controlled by the signal box at New Beckenham. The small SER signal box which was located on the up platform was closed as a result. On 28 September 1975 the control of the signalling was transferred to London Bridge signalling centre.

In May 1993 the up (towards London) side ticket office was destroyed by fire and following this a new ticket office was opened on the down side of the station.

===The privatisation era (1994–present day)===
On 13 October 1996 operation of the passenger services passed to Connex South Eastern. Services were subsequently operated by South Eastern Trains, and Southeastern since 1 April 2006.

==Services==
All services at Catford Bridge are operated by Southeastern using , , and EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 4 tph to London Charing Cross (2 of these run non-stop between and and 2 call at )
* 4 tph to 

On Sundays, the station is served by a half-hourly service between Hayes and London Charing Cross via Lewisham.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 75, 124, 160, 171, 181, 185, 202, 284, 320, 336 and night route N171 serve the station.

==In the media==
The second episode of the 1979 London Weekend Television comedy series End of Part One includes the main characters watching a film called &quot;The Life of Christopher Columbus&quot;. In the film, Columbus goes to a tube station and asks for a train to America, but is told he can only go as far as Catford. Part of a modified tube map is shown which shows the fictitious tube stations &quot;Lewisham&quot;, &quot;Ladywell&quot;, &quot;Edge of the World&quot; and &quot;Catford&quot; on the East London Section of the Metropolitan line south from New Cross station. There is an actual part of the main line Mid-Kent Railway that interchanges with New Cross station, and the stations are, southwards in order: St. John&#x27;s, Lewisham, Ladywell and Catford Bridge.

<text>Jersey Post is the licensed universal service provider of mail service for the Bailiwick of Jersey.

== History ==
Jersey Post was established (as the Committee for Postal Administration) by the &quot;Post Office (Jersey) Law 1969&quot;, in 1969 as a result of an Order in Council which enabled the Crown Dependencies to establish independent postal services.

Jersey is postcoded as the JE postcode area, established between 1990 and 1994 as an extension of the United Kingdom postcode system. Previously, Jersey did not have postcodes (despite an unsuccessful experiment using delivery round numbers).

Jersey Post International Limited was incorporated as a Limited Liability Company by the States Assembly on 1 July 2006 when the &quot;Postal Services (Jersey) Law 2005&quot; came fully into force allowing competition in this sector for the first time. It is licensed by the Jersey Competition Regulatory Authority as a Class II postal operator and, as such, is designated to hold significant market power and thus is liable for the universal service on the Island. Jersey Post International Limited is wholly owned by the Government of Jersey through Government of Jersey Investments Limited.

== Jersey stamps ==
In 1969, with the establishment of Jersey Post, UK postage stamps ceased to be valid in the Crown Dependencies. The Bailiwicks had previously produced stamps and operated independent postal systems during the 1940–1945 German occupation of the Channel Islands.

Jersey Post has a philatelic department which researches, designs, produces and markets Jersey postage stamps which are then sold to stamp collectors worldwide. Jersey Post is member of the Small European Postal Administration Cooperation (SEPAC), which is an organisation that represents small post offices in Europe and the United Kingdom in connection with both philatelic and postal matters.

== Postal and other services ==

Jersey Post has entered several other markets. These include Promail, its mailing house set up in 1996, and Offshore Solutions, its fulfilment service. Promail provides a bulk mail service for the offshore financial community.

In 2006, Jersey Post added a new premium service (FedEx Express) which Jersey Post calls J-express.

In December 2009, Jersey Post launched Jersey&#x27;s first virtual telephone network, a pay as you go mobile telephone service called Me:Mo. In 2011, this telecoms service was terminated, and customer accounts were transferred to Airtel-Vodafone.

In 2016, Jersey Post Group acquired UK based European logistics company, Fraser Freight, now known as Woodside Logistics, this acquisition formed the basis for global logistics company JPGL.

<doc id="800124" wikidata="Q2908391" url="?curid=800124" title="The Bodley Head">
<text>The Bodley Head is an English book publishing imprint of Penguin Random House. Founded in 1887 by John Lane and Elkin Mathews, The Bodley Head existed as an independent entity or as part of multiple consortia until it was acquired by Random House in 1987 alongside sister companies Jonathan Cape and Chatto &amp; Windus. Random House used The Bodley Head as a children&#x27;s book imprint until April 2008, when it was repositioned as an adult non-fiction imprint within the Vintage Books division.

The Bodley Head launched Penguin Books as an imprint in 1935, which John Lane spun off as an independent company the following year. The Bodley Head acquired several other imprints prior to the Random House acquisition, including Martin Hopkinson and Gerald Howe in 1941, Nonesuch Press in 1953, Werner Laurie in 1957, and Hollis &amp; Carter in 1962.

==History==
Originally named Elkin Mathews and John Lane, The Bodley Head was a partnership set up in 1887 by booksellers Elkin Mathews and John Lane, initially to trade in antiquarian books in London. It took the name Bodley Head from a bust of Sir Thomas Bodley, the of the Bodleian Library in Oxford, above the shop door.

Lane and Mathews began in 1894 to publish works of ‘stylish decadence’, including the notorious literary periodical &quot;The Yellow Book&quot;. Also notable amongst Bodley Head&#x27;s pre-Great War books were the two volume sets: &quot;Foundations of the Nineteenth Century&quot; (1910 and later editions, selling over fifty thousand copies), and &quot;Immanuel Kant&quot;, both by Houston Stewart Chamberlain.

Herbert George Jenkins was a manager at the firm during the first decade of the twentieth century, before leaving to set up his own publishing house in 1912. The Bodley Head became a private company in 1921. In 1926 it published the &quot;Book of Bodley Head Verse&quot;, an anthology edited by J. B. Priestley. The firm published some mainstream popular authors such as Arnold Bennett and Agatha Christie and the book series, Twentieth Century Library (edited by V. K. Krishna Menon), but ran into financial difficulties. Allen Lane, John Lane&#x27;s nephew who had inherited control, left in 1936 to found Penguin Books. Before Allen Lane&#x27;s new company was established, however, he published the first Penguins in 1935 under the imprint of The Bodley Head. Both &quot;Penguin Books&quot; and &quot;The Bodley Head&quot; appeared on the cover.

The Bodley Head continued after 1936 backed by a consortium of Allen &amp; Unwin, Jonathan Cape, and J. M. Dent. In 1941, John Lane the Bodley Head took over two smaller publishing houses, Gerald Howe Ltd and Martin Hopkinson &amp; Co., whose authors included Cecil Day Lewis and H. L. Mencken.

The firm was bought in 1957 by Ansbacher &amp; Co., headed by Max Reinhardt. During this period Bodley Head published the work of authors such as George Bernard Shaw, Graham Greene, Charles Chaplin, William Trevor, Maurice Sendak, Muriel Spark, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Sam Haskins and Alistair Cooke. Max Reinhardt was also responsible for the expansion of one of the outstanding children&#x27;s books lists in modern publishing. The imprint was still important in the 1970s when it was drawn into the Jonathan Cape/Chatto &amp; Windus group. The firm was sold to Random House in 1987, who published children&#x27;s books under The Bodley Head name until 2008.

The archives of The Bodley Head Ltd are kept at Reading University.

==Relaunch==
The Bodley Head imprint was relaunched by Random House as an adult imprint in April 2008. Its two principal strands are stated to be books &quot;of scholarship in both the humanities and sciences&quot;, and books which &quot;contribute to the intellectual and cultural climate of our times&quot;.
