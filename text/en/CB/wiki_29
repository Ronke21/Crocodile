<text>The Puerto Rico national basketball team () represents Puerto Rico in men&#x27;s international basketball competitions, it is governed by the Puerto Rican Basketball Federation (), The team represents both FIBA and FIBA Americas.

Since joining FIBA in 1957, the Puerto Rican national team has been mostly composed by Puerto Rican-born players and players of Puerto Rican descent born in the continental United States such as Raymond Gause, Rick Apodaca, Georgie Torres, Héctor Blondet, Renaldo Balkman, Ramón Clemente, Maurice Harkless, Tyler Davis and many others.

The team&#x27;s unofficial mascot is Moncho Loubriel.

==History==
The Puerto Rican Basketball Federation joined FIBA in 1957. Puerto Rico has participated in nine Olympics and 12 World Championships, although they have never won a medal at either competition.

===Early years===
Puerto Rico&#x27;s first appearance at a World Championship was in 1959 in Chile, where, led by Juan Vicéns, who averaged 22 points per game, the team finished 5th with a record of 3–6. In 1963, at Puerto Rico&#x27;s second World Championship appearance which took place in Brazil, the team, led by Rafael Valle and Juan Vicéns, opened the tournament winning two straight games. Yet, after losing other six games back to back, ended its participation with a win over Italy, obtaining the 6th place.

Coming back from its 13th place debut at the 1960 Olympics in Rome, in 1964 in Tokyo, the team was able to reach 4th place, in good part because of the contributions of point guard Juan Vicéns. This was, and still is as of 2016, the highest place it has ever reached since the team&#x27;s birth at any Olympic Games. Three years later in Uruguay, at the 1967 World Championship, the team, led this time by Raymond Dalmau, was only able to finish 12th, ending the decade with a 9th place at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City.

Before the 1970s, regardless of the non-remarkable performance at world international tournaments, Puerto Rico started to emerge as a power player at regional tournaments, medaling in all the competitions it participated (the Pan American Games, the CentroBasket tournament and the Central American and Caribbean Games). The medal count included two golds at the 1962 and the 1966 Central American and Caribbean Games, failing to medal only at the 1967 Pan American Games, where it finished 5th.

===1970s===
The 1970s brought some memorable moments for the team, particularly a dramatic one-point loss to the United States at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal, where a win by Puerto Rico would have been the first undisputed basketball loss for the United States team at an Olympic competition. Also, the 1974 World Championship and the 1979 Pan American Games were held in San Juan, promoting local enthusiasm for international basketball and Puerto Rico&#x27;s presence in it. The 7th and 10th places at the 1974 and 1978 World Championships, where the team, led by Hector Blondet and Rubén Rodríguez respectively, saw 2–5 and 4–3 finishes, became turning points for the Puerto Rican team. The 4–3 showing in 1978 in the Philippines was the first time ever the team finished with a positive record at a World Championship. These achievements were accompanied by golds at the 1973 Centrobasket and the 1978 Central American and Caribbean Games. In all, Puerto Rico continued its regional success and was able to medal in all regional competitions.

===1980s===
The 1980s were very good for the team, attaining gold at two of the first four FIBA Americas Championships in 1980 and 1989, and at the 1985, 1987 and 1989 CentroBasket tournaments. The silver medal at the 1988 Americas Championship held in Montevideo, Uruguay, secured the team&#x27;s first Olympic participation since 1976. Having qualified and earned the right to participate, the Puerto Rican team chose not to do so at the 1980 Olympic Games, held in Moscow, due to the American boycott of that competition (being an autonomous nation sportswise, the team could have participated, but decided to respect the boycott instead). It wouldn&#x27;t participate either at the 1984 Olympic Games, held in Los Angeles, because the team failed to qualify for it. Twelve years after its last Olympic showing, Puerto Rico was able to advance to the second round and finished 7th at the 1988 Olympic Games, held in Seoul. Two years earlier, at the 1986 World Championshipat in Spain, Puerto Rico&#x27;s performance granted it the 10th place, having failed to qualify for the 1982 Championship in Colombia.

===1990s===
During the 1990s, the team&#x27;s successes continued as usual. Led by José Ortiz, Ramón Rivas, Jerome Mincy, Fico López, and Edgar León. the decade began with a 4th-place finish at the 1990 World Championship in Argentina. This is Puerto Rico&#x27;s best showing at a World Championship so far, defeating teams such as Yugoslavia, Argentina and the United States, but losing to the USSR and then, losing by two points the rematch in overtime to the US. In 1991, led by Raymond Gause, besides earning gold at the CentroBasket tournament, the team also won, for the first time in basketball, the gold medal at the Pan American Games, which were held in Cuba. The team also qualified for the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, where it reached the second round, losing to the US in its first game of the elimination round, finishing at the end in 8th place. In 1993, Puerto Rico signed its Caribbean supremacy at this sport by winning gold at both the CentroBasket and the Central American and Caribbean Games. This victory at CentroBasket was the last of a 5 gold medal streak at the tournament. In 1994, the team finished in a 6th place at the World Championship in Canada, but won the gold at the 1994 Goodwill Games in St. Petersburg, Russia, defeating teams such as Croatia, Russia, Brazil and Italy. It was then when Puerto Rico began to be classified as one of the top 10 international teams. Having won gold in 1995 at the FIBA Americas Pre-Olympic Championship, in 1996 at the Olympic Games, the team placed 10th in Atlanta, while in 1998, it placed 11th at the World Championship in Greece.

In 1994, Puerto Rico&#x27;s national basketball team won the gold medal at the 1994 Goodwill Games in Russia, beating Italy, 94–80, in the gold medal game.

===2000–2004===
This Olympic cycle did not go well for the team at the International level, although it did have great moments and it performed well at the local level. Having failed to qualify for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia with its 4th place at the 1999 Tournament of the Americas hosted in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in 2001 the team was able to recover its CentroBasket title, with a triumph in Mexico. Later that year, the team repeated its 4th place at the 2001 FIBA Americas tournament in Argentina.

In 2002, the team had a strong showing at the World Championship held in Indianapolis, USA. The team beat the top 3 European teams at the time; eventual champion Yugoslavia, Turkey and Spain. Puerto Rico, with a 5–1 record entering the quarterfinals, lost its chance to get into the medals round only by a dramatic 2-points loss to New Zealand, eventually placing 7th. It is worth mentioning that Carlos Arroyo debuted at this tournament.

In 2003, the team also won gold at the CentroBasket tournament, held in Mexico, but was only able to achieve the bronze medal at the Tournament of the Americas and the Pan American Games. Reaching its 16th final at the CentroBasket tournament, Puerto Rico conquered the silver medal at the 2004 CentroBasket tournament, losing to the host Dominican Republic, 75–74, in the championship game.

On 15 August 2004, at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, the Puerto Rico National Basketball Team became the second team in history to defeat the United States Olympic basketball team, recording only the third loss in an Olympic competition for the U.S. team, and the first since NBA players were allowed to compete. The 92–73 outcome of that game is, as of 2016, the most lopsided victory against the U.S. (collegiate or NBA players) in the history of Olympic basketball. The other team to defeat the U.S. had been the Soviet Union at the 1972 gold medal game (the outcome of which is still disputed) and the 1988 semifinals.

===2005–2008===
In 2005, Puerto Rico was invited to play at the 2005 Stanković Continental Champions&#x27; Cup in Beijing, where it lost all five games and ended up finishing in 6th place. Still, having failed to qualify directly to the 2006 World Championship by achieving a 7th place at the 2005 FIBA Americas Championship in Santo Domingo, due to its great tradition, in November 2005, Puerto Rico received an invitation to participate in the World tournament as a wildcard, along with Italy, Serbia and Montenegro and Turkey. En route to the World Championship, Puerto Rico won bronze at the 2006 Centrobasket, losing the automatic classification to the 2008 tournament, but recovering in time to earn gold at the 2006 Central American and Caribbean Games. Later, at the group play stage of the 2006 World Championship, which was contested in Japan, Puerto Rico started with victories over Senegal and China, but lost ties against the United States, Italy and Slovenia. The application of a second tiebreaker by points differential to Slovenia, China and Puerto Rico, each with a winning percentage of .400, placed Puerto Rico fifth in Group D, preventing the team from advancing to the knockout round for the first time since 1986; Puerto Rico ultimately placed 17th out of twenty-four, that being its shyest performance in a long time. The following year began with Puerto Rico earning its fifth silver medal at the 2007 Pan American Games, followed by the team&#x27;s first participation in a CaribeBasket tournament, debuting against Trinidad &amp; Tobago. Although the team didn&#x27;t have the participation of Daniel Santiago or Rick Apodaca, Puerto Rico won the tournament undefeated, which meant its classification to the 2008 Centrobasket tournament. Later that year, Puerto Rico started to host an exhibition tournament called the Marchand Continental Championship Cup in order to prepare for the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship. After playing against Brazil, Canada and Argentina, Puerto Rico lost all three games, ending up in fourth place. The year ended with a bronze at the FIBA Americas Championship. On 31 January 2008, a draw took place for the FIBA Preolympic tournament, which placed Puerto Rico in the same group as Croatia and Cameroon, where its winner would have to face the second place of Group C. Following this event, the president of the National Superior Basketball League confirmed that the team would play exhibition games at the 2008 Bamberg Super Cup in Germany against Greece, Slovenia and the host, beginning on 4 July 2008. Then, a second set of exhibition games would follow, scheduled to start on 8 July 2008, in Slovenia: the 2008 Alpos International Cup, where the team would face New Zealand, Iran and the hosts. After these preparatory tournaments, the team would train until the Preolympic tournament&#x27;s beginning. The team began practicing on 19 May 2008, and included several players that were under consideration for inclusion by Cintrón. On 4 June 2008, Daniel Santiago confirmed that he would abandon his international retirement and play with Puerto Rico in the Preolympic tournament. Santiago announced that he would join the team in July, following an exhibition game. Javier Mojica, Alejandro Carmona and Joel Jones were included in as potential members in the preliminary team. On 1 July 2008, hours before the team was scheduled to travel to Europe, Ángelo Reyes was excluded after not establishing communication with the directives. Reyes was replaced with Alex Falcón. Subsequently, Reyes asked for a dispensation to attend personal matters, noting that he intended to join the team in a week; however, he was not included due to time constraints. In the first game at the Bamberg Super Cup, Puerto Rico defeated Germany with a team composed mostly of reserve players, as Carlos Arroyo, Santiago, Larry Ayuso and Carmelo Lee were attending other compromises. Puerto Rico continued playing with these players, finishing 2nd, after losing the final game to Greece, who entered the cup with their entire lineup. Santiago and Ayuso joined the practices on 5 July 2008, when Puerto Rico traveled to Slovenia, where the Alpos International Cup was being held. The first match in the tournament was a victory against New Zealand, followed by another victory in the semifinals over Iran. At the end, Puerto Rico finished second, losing to Slovenia in the finals. The Preolympic tournament began on 14 July 2008, but Puerto Rico&#x27;s debut came the following day, when the team defeated Cameroon and advanced to the second round, due to a loss that the African team had suffered during the first day of competition. On its second game, the team lost to Croatia, but in the quarterfinals, defeated Slovenia. The team didn&#x27;t qualify to the Olympics, after losing to Greece in the semifinals and to Germany in the tournament&#x27;s bronze medal game.

===2008–2012===
This Olympic cycle began with the 2008 Centrobasket competition. After having failed to classify directly to it, Puerto Rico&#x27;s spot was secured after its first and only participation in the 2007 CaribeBasket tournament, where Puerto Rico won all round one games by over 25 points and went on to win gold. The 2008 Centrobasket was scheduled to take place before the Olympic Qualifying Tournament, but due to time constraints it was postponed. A group of prospects was included in the roster to replace Peter John Ramos and Ricky Sanchez, who were injured. Among those included was Ángel Daniel Vassallo, who played as a small forward in Virginia Tech. In the first game of the tournament, Puerto Rico defeated Costa Rica. In the other two games of the first round, the team defeated Cuba and Panama. During the course of the event, Carlos Arroyo and Larry Ayuso were forced to rest a game due to injuries. In the semifinals, the team scored a win over the Dominican Republic. Puerto Rico won the gold medal by defeating the United States Virgin Islands in the finals. The team has secured a spot for the 2010 FIBA World Championship by finishing in 1 of the top 4 spots in the 2009 FIBA Americas Championship. At the end, Puerto Rico finished the tournament with the silver medal, having lost the game against Argentina in the group stage, and losing the final against Brazil. Pending the performance at the 2010 FIBA World Championship, this cycle has had Puerto Rico with a record of 19–2 (Caribebasket 6–0, Centrobasket 5–0, FIBA Americas 8–2), not counting the 2nd-place finish at the 2009 Marchand Continental Championship Cup, where Puerto Rico won the exhibition games against Argentina and Canada, but lost the final to Brazil.

At the 2010 CentroBasket, Puerto Rico won Group B with Cuba finishing second. The team defeated Panama in semifinals and the Dominican Republic in the final to win the gold medal. Arroyo and Barea were included in the tournament&#x27;s All-Star Team.

In 2010, the Puerto Rican Basketball Federation relieved Manolo Cintron of his coaching duties, and on 8 June 2011, the Federation officially announced the new head coach of the national team, Flor Melendez, which will be Melendez&#x27;s second stint with the team as head coach.

On 27 August 2011, a chartered airplane carrying the team as well as the Canadian, Dominican and Brazilian national basketball teams from Foz de Iguacu, Brazil, to Mar del Plata, Argentina, made an emergency landing at Ezeiza International Airport, Buenos Aires, Argentina, after experiencing severe weather conditions mid-flight. The plane left for Mar del Plata an hour and a half after it landed.

===2019===
On 26 February 2019, Puerto Rico defeated the Uruguayan national basketball team 65–61, securing their entrance into the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup in China They were drawn to Group C, facing 2nd-ranked Spain, alongside Iran and Tunisia, with Puerto Rico facing Iran and Tunisia for the very first time.

===2023 FIBA World Cup===
On 27 July 2023, the New Orleans Pelicans announced that for precautionary reasons that Puerto Rican star PG Jose Alvarado would miss the 2023 FIBA world cup to allow him to heal up for the upcoming NBA season.

On 10 August 2023, FIBA had announced the 2025 AmeriCup Qualifiers groups, placing PR in Group D with the United States, Cuba, and Bahamas.

===2024===
On July 7, 2024, Puerto Rico qualified for the 2024 Summer Olympics after defeating both Mexico in the semifinals and Lithuania in the final of one of four 2024 FIBA Men&#x27;s Olympic Qualifying Tournaments. However, they were eliminated after back-to-back losses against South Sudan and Serbia as a result of their very poor performance at the Olympics, marred by their inconsistent playing styles that led to their early exit from the Olympics. In the final game, they lost to the United States. Ultimately, Puerto Rico finished dead last in the Olympics basketball as a result of their worst performance after their 20-year return.

==Uniform==
During most of the 1980s and up until the late 1990s, the team wore a solid color uniform, with accent lines and the word &quot;Puerto Rico&quot; written in stylized cursive. Nowadays, the national team&#x27;s uniform resembles a Puerto Rican flag, but also includes the traditional Puerto Rico letters in cursive. The uniforms are red or blue for &quot;home&quot; status, and white for &quot;away&quot;.

===Pan American Games===

Since joining FIBA in 1957, Puerto Rico has participated in the basketball competition for all editions of the Pan American Games since 1959, obtaining medals in all but the 1967, 1983, 1995, 2015, and 2023 games. It has a total of 12 medals.

===Centrobasket===

Puerto Rico has a great record at the Centrobasket Championships, having participated in all of them but 1967, and obtaining a medal in all.

===Central American and Caribbean Games===

Since its basketball debut in the 1935 Games, Puerto Rico has only failed to medal in the 1938, 1946, 1950, and 1998 Games. The team has a total of 16 medals.

===CaribeBasket Championships===

Since the founding of the CaribeBasket tournament in 1981 as a CentroBasket qualification stage for Caribbean countries, Puerto Rico has only participated in the 2007 tournament, after failing to classify directly to CentroBasket 2008. In this tournament, it won all round one games by over 25 points and went on to win gold.

===Goodwill Games===
Because the 1986 FIBA World Championship was scheduled to be held at the same time as the 1986 Goodwill Games, the inaugural men&#x27;s Goodwill Games basketball title was based on results from the World&#x27;s. For the 2001 games, although scheduled to compete with seven other teams, Puerto Rico was not able to make it to the tournament, being replaced by Mexico, which finished 7th.

<text>Cadel Lee Evans (; born 14 February 1977) is an Australian former professional racing cyclist who competed professionally in both mountain biking and road bicycle racing. A four-time Olympian, Evans is one of three non-Europeans – along with Greg LeMond and Egan Bernal – to have won the Tour de France, winning the race in 2011.

Early in his career, he was a champion mountain biker, winning the UCI Mountain Bike World Cup in 1998 and 1999 and placing seventh in the men&#x27;s cross-country mountain bike race at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. Evans is a four-time Olympian. Evans turned to full-time road cycling in 2001, and gradually progressed through the ranks. He finished second in the Tour de France in 2007 and 2008. Both of these 2nd place finishes are in the top 10 of the closest Tours in history. He became the first Australian to win the UCI ProTour (2007) and the UCI Road World Championships in 2009.

After finishing outside the top twenty in 2009 and 2010, Evans became the first Australian rider to win the Tour de France in 2011, riding for the . He took the race lead on the penultimate day, after completing a individual time trial some two-and-a-half minutes quicker than his closest rivals, Andy Schleck and Fränk Schleck. At age 34, he was among the five oldest winners in the race&#x27;s history. He also made the podium in the 2009 Vuelta a España and the 2013 Giro d&#x27;Italia.

Evans retired on 1 February 2015, after completing a race named in his honour.

==Early life==
Cadel Evans was born on 14 February 1977 at the Katherine District Hospital, Katherine, Northern Territory, Australia, to Helen (née Cocks), a bank manager, and Paul Evans, a council foreman. He spent his early childhood in the small Aboriginal community of Barunga, east of Katherine. At the age of seven, he was hit in the head by a horse, and spent seven days in an induced coma. In 1986, his parents separated and he first moved with his mother to Armidale, New South Wales, and then to the Melbourne suburb of Eltham, Victoria, where his mother still lives. Evans attended Newling Public School in Armidale, and Eltham High School in Melbourne. Skateboarding was one of his teenage interests. His father describes him as a good student, but otherwise just an ordinary kid who would leave his toys around; &quot;Not in [my] wildest dreams&quot; would he imagine that his son would become a top world athlete.

==Career==
===Mountain biking career===
Evans started his international career in 1995 as a Scholarship-holder in the Australian Institute of Sport mountain bike (MTB) Program, under A.I.S. Cycling Program&#x27;s MTB coach Damian Grundy, and up to 1998 under road coach Heiko Salzwedel. While Evans was at the Australian Institute of Sport, physiological tests showed he possessed a rare combination – an unusually high lung volume and the capacity to absorb more oxygen from each breath than 99.9 per cent of the population. This ability led to him becoming known as &#x27;The Lung&#x27;.

Evans won bronze medals at the 1995 Junior world mountain bike championship and Junior world road time trial championship, and silver medals at the 1997 and 1999 under-23 world championships. He won the cross-country event in the UCI Mountain Bike World Cup in both 1998 and 1999. In 1998 Shayne Bannan was the under-23 road cycling coach based in Italy.

In 1997, he rode for the Diamondback MTB team, and then for the Volvo–Cannondale MTB team.

In March 2017, Evans was back on a mountain bike and competing in the Masters category at the eight-day Cape Epic stage race in South Africa over . The race, held in a two-person team format saw Evans partner George Hincapie – his domestique at the 2011 Tour de France – and they won the category.

===Switch to road cycling===
Cadel Evans had a breakthrough road cycling performance at the 1999 Tour of Tasmania, where commentator Phil Liggett famously proclaimed that Evans would win the Tour de France one day. It was not until 2001, however, that Evans officially made the switch to road cycling and joined the team. He spent one year with in 2001 and another year with in 2002 before two years with (2003–2004). Other early successes included overall wins in the 2001 and 2004 editions of the Tour of Austria, 14th in the 2002 Giro d&#x27;Italia (he wore the general classification leader&#x27;s pink jersey for one day), Commonwealth Games time trial champion in 2002 and a stage win of the 2002 Tour Down Under.

At Mapei, he was coached by Aldo Sassi, who helped him make the transition from mountain biker to grand tourer. After Sassi&#x27;s death from cancer in 2010, Evans continued cooperation with his protege Andrea Morelli. After winning the Tour de France in 2011, Evans dedicated the victory to the late coach.

===Davitamon–Lotto (2005–09)===

From the 2005 season he joined and came eighth in his first Tour de France, the first Australian in the top ten since Phil Anderson. He finished fifth at the Deutschland Tour.

In 2006, Evans started the season by winning the mountains classification in the Tour Down Under. Evans won the Tour de Romandie, beating Spanish riders Alberto Contador and Alejandro Valverde on the last stage, a time trial around Lausanne. He finished fifth in the Tour de France but was promoted to fourth after the disqualification of apparent winner Floyd Landis due to a failed drug test. Evans was also named Australian Cyclist of the Year.

In the 2007 Tour de France, Evans finished runner-up to Contador. He won the stage 13 individual time trial and came second in the stage 19 individual time trial. Evans finished fourth in the Vuelta a España. He came fifth in the world championship and sixth in the final UCI ProTour race, the Giro di Lombardia. As a result, he won the overall ProTour classification with 247 points ahead of Davide Rebellin and Contador. He was again named Australian Cyclist of the Year.

The 2008 season saw Evans become one of Australia&#x27;s most successful cyclists after consecutive podium places at the Tour de France. Evans was a favourite to win the Tour de France because Contador was not allowed to participate as his team were not invited. Evans held the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification from stages 10 to 14. However, during Alpe d&#x27;Huez on stage 17, Carlos Sastre of took 2 minutes 15 seconds from Evans. By the penultimate stage time trial, Evans needed to ride 1 minute 34 seconds faster than Sastre. He beat Sastre and jumped to second place but remained 58 seconds behind at the end of the Tour. While recovering from a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament, Evans contested the men&#x27;s road race at the Beijing Olympics, finishing 15th, 22 seconds behind Samuel Sánchez. He placed fifth in the road time trial four days later.

In 2009, Evans won the Settimana Internazionale di Coppi e Bartali Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré. A combination of poor team support and poor form hampered his Tour de France campaign and he was only able to finish in 30th place, 45 minutes behind winner Contador. Evans finished third overall in the Vuelta a España, during which he wore the gold leader&#x27;s jersey for a day, although his race was marred by mechanical failure in the way up the Sierra Nevada mountain finish. Evans joined an elite group of cyclists who have all worn all three leaders jerseys; the pink jersey for the leader of the general classification in the Giro d&#x27;Italia in 2002, the yellow jersey for the leader of the general classification in the Tour de France for 4 days in the 2008 Tour de France, and the gold jersey for the leader of the general classification in the Vuelta a España.

Evans went on to win the road race at the UCI Road World Championships in Mendrisio, Switzerland on 27 September. He was awarded Australian Cyclist of the Year for the third time.

===BMC Racing Team (2010–15)===
There was much speculation at the end of the 2009 season of Evans looking for a new team to better support him at the 2010 Tour de France. After Evans became world champion he seemed to commit himself fully to helping teammate Philippe Gilbert. To many, this was evidence of a happier relationship between Evans and . However, it was then revealed that Evans was to depart the team, who cited his reason for leaving as &quot;to look for new challenges&quot;.

====2010====

In 2010, Evans moved to the .
He had success in La Flèche Wallonne and he led the general classification after Stage 2 of the Giro d&#x27;Italia. Evans won stage seven of the race with a dominating sprint from the front of a small group, after resisting numerous attacks from Alexander Vinokourov in the final . This stage was later dubbed as &quot;the mud stage&quot;, since it was raining profusely and the path of the race was going through dirt roads, resulting in unrecognisable riders. Evans finished the Giro 5th overall, winning the points classification and the Azzurri d&#x27;Italia classification. Evans also held the yellow jersey for stage nine of the Tour de France while riding with a hairline fracture in his left elbow caused during a crash in the previous stage. He lost significant time to the leaders during stage nine, which lost him the yellow jersey and put him out of serious contention for overall victory. He ended the tour in 26th place, 50 minutes and 27 seconds behind Alberto Contador.

====2011====
Evans had a much more successful start to 2011, winning stage 4 and the general classification at Tirreno–Adriatico, and the general classification at the Tour de Romandie, both of which formed part of the UCI World Tour. Skipping the Giro d&#x27;Italia, Evans prepared for the Tour de France by finishing as runner-up in the Criterium du Dauphine, one of the major Tour warm up events. This was the fourth consecutive Dauphine that Evans entered where he finished in 2nd.
Evans finished second on stage one of the Tour de France, and won stage 4, the third Tour de France stage win of his career. Evans then led the mountains classification after stage 4 for a single day. As the Tour de France continued Evans was looked upon often to chase down breakaways in order to preserve his position in the top 5 of the general classification and in order to maintain time gaps that he believed he could strategically make up in the individual time trial of stage 20. During stage 19, Evans was forced to chase an early breakaway containing the general classification contenders and led by Alberto Contador, who at the time was seeking his 4th Tour de France win. However, he experienced mechanical trouble and was forced to change bikes. He again led the peloton to pull back the contender group, keeping himself within striking distance for overall victory by remaining just under a minute behind Andy Schleck. On the time trial, the last stage before Paris, Evans took the lead of the general classification by 1&#x27; 34&quot; after finishing close second in the stage, beating previous race leader Schleck by 2&#x27; 31&quot;. With the win he became the first Australian to win the Tour de France, the second non-European to have officially won it, and the oldest to win the overall general classification in the post-war era.

Evans&#x27; win elicited much celebration in his home nation with calls for a national holiday as his win was compared to that of the 1983 America&#x27;s Cup which was considered Australia&#x27;s greatest sporting achievement. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard phoned to congratulate Evans saying that &quot;I do want to say a very big congratulations to Cadel Evans. I had the opportunity this morning to speak and to personally offer my congratulations. I believe I disturbed him while he was trying to get a nice, hot bath.&quot; Evans said immediately following the tour that he was unsure of how his win would be received in Australia, saying &quot;I haven&#x27;t had time to consider that aspect, to be honest. It&#x27;s been a long, long process and it will take a long time to realise what it means. A few people always believed in me and they&#x27;re the people that matter the most. We did it. It&#x27;s been a real pleasure these past three weeks.&quot; At a homecoming parade held on his return to Australia, tens of thousands of people turned out, many dressed in yellow and waving yellow flags, in Melbourne&#x27;s Federation Square. A state reception was held in his honour.

====2012====
In March, Evans won the overall classification of the 2.HC Critérium International, a three-stage race. He was victorious on the second stage, a individual time trial, and held on to his lead in the final stage, grabbing the Points classification jersey. Evans also took a prestigious victory on stage 1 of the Critérium du Dauphiné after attacking on the last descent, catching and out sprinting the two men who were at the front of the race, Jérôme Coppel () and Andrey Kashechkin (). Evans finished in third position in the general classification, with the points classification jersey on his shoulders.
Evans started the Tour de France with high hopes of a repeat performance from 2011. On stage 7, Evans showed great form by finishing second atop La Planche des Belles Filles, registering the same time as rival Bradley Wiggins of , the latter grabbing the yellow jersey. Evans then lost a substantial amount of time on the ninth stage individual time trial, coming in sixth place with a deficit of one minute and forty-three seconds on the winner Wiggins. He suffered another setback in the high mountain stage from Albertville to La Toussuire-Les Sybelles (stage 11), where he tried a daring attack with teammate Tejay van Garderen away from the summit of the Col de la Croix de Fer with almost to go in the race. The attempted escape failed and he was subsequently dropped on the slopes leading to La Toussuire, being unable to follow the pace set by Chris Froome. He lost another minute and 26 seconds to the race leader. Stage 14 saw Evans puncture three times as tacks had been thrown on the road, with calling a temporary halt to the racing on the descent. As riders brought Evans back from his predicament to rejoin the bunch, they saluted &#x27;s car as they crossed the convoy to thank them for the gesture of sportsmanship. Evans dropped out of contention on stage 16, where he lost contact with the leaders on the penultimate climb, was paced back by teammates on the descent only to be dropped again on the Col de Peyresourde. He slipped to seventh overall, and behind van Garderen. Evans lost further time on the last time trial to Chartres, where he was overtaken on the road by van Garderen, despite setting out three minutes ahead of him; he cited illness to explain his performance. He finished the Tour in seventh position, 15 minutes and 49 seconds down on winner Wiggins and stated that he would be back as BMC&#x27;s leader in 2013.

Evans was selected in the Australian teams for the road race and time trial at the London Olympics. However, after making no impact in the road race, Evans withdrew from the time trial citing fatigue. A couple of weeks later, he cancelled his scheduled participation to the Québec and Montréal World Tour races, stating that he was putting an end to his 2012 racing season because he was exhausted and did not want to compromise his 2013 campaign.

====2013====
Evans&#x27; 2013 season came to a good start after finishing third in the Tour of Oman in presence of a strong field. His strategy that year was to ride both the Giro d&#x27;Italia and the Tour de France. In April, he placed eighth in the Giro del Trentino, a short stage race he rode in preparation for the Italian Grand Tour. The Giro d&#x27;Italia featured cold and wet weather, leading &quot;Bicycling&quot; magazine to call it &quot;one of the more grueling Grand Tours in recent memory.&quot; Despite the difficulties, Evans was posted in second position for a long time behind overall classification leader Vincenzo Nibali. He lost his second place on the last mountain stage, climbing to Tre Cime di Lavaredo, which was hindered by snowfall. He still managed to finish third in the general classification. Evans was the designated leader of his team in the Tour de France, but he encountered major difficulties as he was constantly dropped from the leading group in mountainous stages. His teammate Tejay van Garderen sacrificed his overall chances to help him in key stages, but to no avail. The Tour concluded in a major disappointment for Team BMC, as Evans took 39th place and Van Garderen finished 45th while Briton Chris Froome won the overall classification.

====2014–2015====

In September 2014, Evans announced that he would retire in February 2015. Evans participated in the inaugural Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race in 2015, finishing fifth. Evans then became the Global Ambassador for the .

==Personal life==
In 2005, Evans married Chiara Passerini, an Italian pianist and music teacher he met at the end of 2002. Evans proposed to her after his first Tour de France. In January 2012, the couple adopted their son Robel, from Ethiopia, at the age of six months. Evans and Passerini separated in 2015. Since 2015 he has been dating Stefania Zandonella, a ski Instructor from Italy. Their son Aidan was born in 2019.

Cadel&#x27;s grandfather was from Wales, and so he was named &quot;Cadel&quot; in honour of three Welsh kings.

Evans&#x27; first cousin is Australian London 2012 Paralympian Matthew Haanappel.

His current Australian home is Barwon Heads, Victoria. He resides in Stabio, Switzerland when in Europe.

Evans was made a Member (AM) in the General Division of the Order of Australia on 10 June 2013.

Evans supports the Geelong Cats in the Australian Football League. A biography, &quot;Cadel Evans: Close To Flying&quot;, was published by Hardie Grant Books in November 2009.

===Philanthropy and political views===
Winning &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; 2007 Sports Performer of the Year, Evans pledged to donate his $50,000 winner&#x27;s prize to charity, including the Amy Gillett Foundation, established in memory of Australian rower and cyclist Amy Gillett, who was killed on the eve of a stage race in Germany in 2005, when she and her Australian teammates were struck by a car. Another nominated beneficiary was Ian Thorpe&#x27;s Fountain for Youth, established by the Olympic swimmer to alleviate and treat illness and disease in people under 20. Making the announcement, Evans revealed that Thorpe had visited the Northern Territory Aboriginal community of Barunga where Evans lived until the age of three.

In 2008, Evans wore a cycling undershirt with the Flag of Tibet and supported freedom for Tibet. He said:

:&quot;Trying to bring awareness of the Tibet movement is something someone in my position can do. I just feel really sorry for them. They don&#x27;t harm anyone and they are getting their culture taken away from them. I don&#x27;t want to see a repeat of what happened to Aboriginal culture [in Australia] happen to another culture.&quot;

In support of youth mental health initiatives of Orygen Youth Health, Evans has featured in the annual &quot;Suit Up &amp; Ride&quot; corporate team cycling event in Melbourne since 2010.

<text>Fort McRee was a historic military fort constructed by the United States on the eastern tip of Perdido Key to defend Pensacola and its important natural harbor. In the defense of Pensacola Bay, Fort McRee was accompanied by Fort Pickens, located across Pensacola Pass on Santa Rosa Island, and Fort Barrancas, located across Pensacola Bay on the grounds of what is now Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola. Fort Pickens was the largest of these. Very little remains of Fort McRee today.

== History ==

===Design and construction===
Fort McRee was one of three major installations constructed by the United States to strengthen defenses at Pensacola Bay following the War of 1812. Its construction lasted from 1834 to 1839; the facility was a three-tiered fort and a detached water battery close to sea level. It was located on the eastern tip of Perdido Key on a stretch of beach known as Foster&#x27;s Bank. It had a highly unusual shape because of its position on a small, narrow barrier island.

Fort McRee had a strange boomerang shape, of a rather archaic design. In this design, it had 19 casemates (4 on each face, 1 on the tip, and 5 on each wing), each capable of mounting 4 cannons. However, General Simon Bernard&#x27;s plans for the fort called for 8 of the casemates to be used as quarters and store rooms, and 2 of the 8 were to be used as powder magazines. This left the wings of the fort rather under defended, but it still left 44 casemated guns aiming at Pensacola Pass, which was enough to stop enemy ships.

The landward facing walls of the fort, containing the Sally Port, were known as the gorge. The large rooms on the ends of the gorge were also powder magazines, and each of them were 17 x 35 feet in area. The Sally Port was 12 feet wide. The gorge was designed to have 6 casemates- 3 on either face- to be used as quarters. In each, it was possible to mount 1 carronade.

Although the fort was completed in 1839, its 122 guns were not installed until sometime between 1843 and 1845. It is likely that many of these guns were not in place for some time due to several issues, the most important of which was a problem with rot beginning in the second tier wooden decking.

Fort McRee was named in April 1840 for Army engineer Colonel William McRee.
===Early use===
The first troops stationed at Fort McRee, the men of I Company, 3rd Artillery, arrived on 2 May 1842. These men were joined by E Company, 7th Infantry in July. From this time until October 1845, when much of the artillery unit was ordered to Louisiana, the fort was manned at various levels.

After the Mexican–American War was finished in 1848, barracks were built near Fort Barrancas on the mainland. Once these were completed, Fort McRee was manned only during drills, maneuvers and target practice. The strength of the entire US Army on 1 December 1853 was reported at 10,417, so commanders had to be effective in use of troops. The other two Pensacola area forts were manned in a similar way until the outbreak of the Civil War.

===Civil War action===
With less than 50 men to occupy all three fortifications in Pensacola, First Lieutenant Adam J. Slemmer (the senior Army officer present) decided to concentrate his small force in a more defensible location. January 8, 1861 the Union soldiers at Fort Barrancas fired upon the Florida Militia effectively firing the first shots of the war. Over 9 and 10 January 1861, his garrison spiked the guns of Barrancas and McRee then moved across the bay to Fort Pickens. The move was a timely one as on 12 January, Florida and Alabama militia arrived and took control of the evacuated fortifications.

Over the next several months, both sides built new cannon batteries and brought in more personnel. The opposing forces engaged in cannon duels many times but with little effect. Near the end of the year, manning stood at about 7,000 men on the Confederate side opposed by 2,000 Union soldiers around Fort Pickens.

On 9 October 1861 the commander of Confederate forces in Pensacola, General Braxton Bragg, ordered an assault on Fort Pickens that was ultimately unsuccessful. Colonel Harvey Brown, the commander of Union forces, felt this attack required an answer and planned an attack of his own. Fort McRee, the closest fortification to Fort Pickens and a road block to any attempted assault on Pensacola, was to be the primary target.

Starting on the morning of 22 November 1861, Fort McRee was bombarded heavily by Union forces at Fort Pickens, and by two ships, &quot;Niagara&quot; and &quot;Richmond&quot;. Initially returning strong fire, the Confederates were able to hold their own and even managed to heavily damage the &quot;Richmond&quot;. However, the combined efforts of the two ships eventually led to the suppression of fire by an adjacent battery early in the afternoon with the guns of Fort McRee falling silent by 5pm. A fall in tide and the onset of darkness caused the two ships to withdraw.

After the days fight, General Bragg sent messengers out to ascertain the extent of damage to the Confederate defenses. The commander of Fort McRee, Colonel John B. Villepique, advised that his position was heavily exposed on most sides and that half his weapons had been dismounted and their powder stores unprotected. Villepique stated he was unable to return fire and asked to sabotage the fort and withdraw. Worried about the effect the retreat would have not only on his men but the enemy as well, Bragg denied the request.

At 10am on 23 November, the &quot;Niagara&quot; resumed its attack on Fort McRee as did the cannons at Fort Pickens. The guns of Fort McRee remained silent. The end of fighting that day signaled the end of the Colonel Brown&#x27;s attack. Although Fort McRee survived, it was badly battered. Large chunks of the wall were blown away while other portions had holes shot clean through by the cannon shells. In one area a section of wall totally collapsed. Most of the wood decking within the fort had gone up in flames while one powder magazine caved in, killing six Confederates in the process.

The actions on 22 and 23 November would be the last engagement for Fort McRee. Although there was an artillery duel on 1 January 1862, the fort was not a participant in that action.

When Confederate forces abandoned Pensacola in May 1862, they burned Fort McRee and several other buildings in the area believed to be of strategic value. No mention in surviving records indicate that any repairs were made or even attempted on the fort by Union forces.

===Post-war neglect===
Battered and burned is how Fort McRee remained for the next three decades. The only actions taken were to stem the erosion of the beach by the construction of two jetties. An example of this neglect can be seen in an 1871-1872 expenditures report which recorded a total of $191.29 being spent on maintaining the fort.

In 1875, the War Department authorized the commander of Fort Barrancas to remove 50,000 bricks from Fort McRee to build walkways and make structural repairs at his location.

In 1885, a group of businessmen offered to purchase the remaining structure of Fort McRee for $500. This request was denied by the Army Corps of Engineers on the basis that the remaining bricks were worth more to the War Department as a source of material for repairing Fort Barrancas and structures at the nearby Navy yard.

===Activity returns===
With the completion of the Endicott Board and the subsequent renewed interest in strengthening the coastal defenses of the US, activity returned to Fort McRee. In 1898 a battery of two 8-inch rifled guns were constructed just west of the fort. It was named Battery Slemmer in honor of the Union officer who evacuated Pensacola at the start of the Civil War.

In 1899 a battery of rapid fire guns were installed and named Battery Center after Lieutenant J. P. Center, an officer killed at the Battle of Lake Okeechobee.

Batteries Slemmer and Center were manned by members of the US Army Coast Artillery Corps, with between 50 and 100 personnel who were rotated from Fort Barrancas.

A hurricane that struck on 26–27 September 1906 destroyed most of the newer structures that had been erected since 1898. After the hurricane, only a minimal caretaker staff remained to ensure the security of the site. With America&#x27;s entry into World War I in 1917, the guns of Battery Slemmer were removed and sent to Europe for mounting on railway cars. In 1920, the guns of Battery Center were declared surplus and removed as well. With the removal of these guns, Fort McRee once again fell into disuse.

===Final military use===
With the onset of World War II, activity once again returned to Fort McRee. A battery of two 6-inch shield guns with a range of 15 miles was planned for the site. Foundations were poured and the gun carriages received. However, the war ended before the guns were put in place and the site, known as Battery 233, was abandoned.

With the end of World War II came the end of the need for fixed coastal defenses. In 1947, Fort Barrancas was deactivated and ownership transferred to NAS Pensacola. As a sub-post of Barrancas, Fort McRee was included in this transfer.

The US Navy managed the forts until 1971 when Fort Barrancas, along with Fort Pickens, was turned over to the National Park Service and became part of Gulf Islands National Seashore. This ended nearly 140 years of military ownership for Fort McRee.

===Fort McRee today===
Of the three forts that once protected Pensacola, Forts Pickens and Barrancas were preserved first through continued use and later as historic sites. However, due to its location on a site accessible only by foot or boat, Fort McRee was left to the elements. Storms and erosion took their toll on the site. Today, nothing more than a few scattered foundations remain.

Because the land on which Fort McRee once stood now belongs to the National Park Service, it is open to anyone visiting Gulf Islands National Seashore. However, the area is remote and no visitor facilities of any kind exist. Additionally, the use of metal detectors is prohibited and any artifacts found are not to be removed from the site.

==Location confusion==
The actual location of Fort McRee is open to some speculation. Foster&#x27;s Bank has seen much change over the past 170-plus years, shrinking and growing from the effects of weather and the sea. Warfare, fires, weather and recycling all but reduced the fort to its foundations. Combined, these conditions have left very little physical evidence of the structures.

Adding to the confusion are two differing sets of coordinates listed for the site by the US Coast Guard in an 1882 survey. One set of coordinates places the fort at latitude 30 degrees 30 minutes 19 seconds, longitude 87 degrees 48 minutes 18 seconds in which case the fort lies just on shore of the present day remains of Foster&#x27;s Bank. The other set of coordinates places the fort at latitude 30 degrees 29.4 minutes 19 second, longitude 87 degrees 46.8 minutes 18 seconds which puts the fort under water just off the beach.

<text>Priyadarshan (born 30 January 1957) is an Indian film director and screenwriter. He has worked in Indian cinema since 1982, directing over 90 films in multiple Indian languages, predominantly Malayalam and Hindi, with notable works in Tamil and Telugu. He has received several accolades, including three National Film Awards, multiple Kerala State Film Awards, and the Padma Shri in 2012.

== Career ==
Priyadarshan began his cinematic career in the early 1980s within Malayalam, directing films such as &quot;Mazha Peyyunnu Maddalam Kottunnu&quot; (1986), &quot;Thalavattam&quot; (1986), &quot;Vellanakalude Nadu&quot; (1988), &quot;Chithram&quot; (1988), &quot;Vandanam&quot; (1989), and &quot;Kilukkam&quot; (1991). In the 1990s, his work included films like &quot;Abhimanyu&quot; (1991), &quot;Mithunam&quot; (1993), &quot;Thenmavin Kombath&quot; (1994), &quot;Kaalapaani&quot; (1996), &quot;Chandralekha&quot; (1997), and &quot;Megham&quot; (1999).

In the 2000s, Priyadarshan transitioned to Bollywood and became known for his Hindi adaptations of Malayalam films, many of which were box-office successes. These include the drama films &quot;Gardish&quot; (1994) and &quot;Virasat&quot; (1997), and comedies such as &quot;Hera Pheri&quot; (2000), &quot;Hungama&quot; (2003), &quot;Hulchul&quot; (2004), &quot;Garam Masala&quot; (2005), &quot;Bhagam Bhag&quot; (2006), &quot;Chup Chup Ke&quot; (2006), &quot;Dhol&quot; (2007), &quot;De Dana Dan&quot; (2009), and &quot;Bhool Bhulaiyaa&quot; (2008). Many of these films have gained a cult following following among Hindi-speaking audiences.

In 2013, Priyadarshan announced that &quot;Rangrezz&quot; would be his last Hindi film for the time being, as he shifted his focus back to Malayalam cinema.

== Early life ==
Priyadarshan received his early education at the Government Model School in Thiruvananthapuram, and a Master of Arts in Philosophy from University College Thiruvananthapuram. His father was a college librarian, which fostered his interest in books. He was an avid reader in his teens, and during college, he began writing short plays and skits for All India Radio. He was influenced by the films of director P. Venu. His friends during this time included Mohanlal, M. G. Sreekumar, Suresh Kumar, Sanal Kumar, Jagadish, Maniyanpilla Raju, and Ashok Kumar. Mohanlal entered the film industry, and his friends followed him to Chennai in search of opportunities. With Mohanlal&#x27;s help, Priyadarshan worked as an assistant scriptwriter on a few films and began writing his own scripts, some of which became successful. Eventually, he returned to Kerala.

Priyadarshan originally wanted to become a cricketer, but an eye injury led him to filmmaking.

== Film career ==
Priyadarshan has worked for 40 years in Indian cinema as a director and screenwriter, directing over 95 films in 4 Indian languages, Malayalam, Tamil, Hindi, and Telugu.

=== 1984–1987 ===
In 1984, Priyadarshan, along with friends Suresh Kumar and Sanal Kumar, decided to produce a film. Shankar secured finance from Thiruvenkadam. Mohanlal, by then a prominent actor, was selected as the parallel lead along with Shankar. Priyadarshan debuted as director with &quot;Poochakkoru Mookkuthi&quot;, which received critical acclaim. The slapstick comedy, made on a low budget, ran for 100 days in Kerala theatres. Priyadarshan continued with slapstick comedy in &quot;Odaruthammava Aalariyam&quot; and later made &quot;Onnanam Kunnil Oradi Kunnil&quot; and the Mammootty-Shankar family thriller &quot;Parayanumvayya Parayathirikkanumvayya&quot;. He then made &quot;Punnaram Cholli Cholli&quot;, his first film without Mohanlal, followed by &quot;Boeing Boeing&quot; and &quot;Aram + Aram = Kinnaram.&quot; He was later criticised for &quot;Rakkuyilin Ragasadassil&quot;. Despite hit songs, the film flopped. However, &quot;Mazha Peyyunnu Maddalam Kottunnu&quot;, &quot;Ayalvasi Oru Daridravasi&quot; and &quot;Dheem Tharikida Thom&quot; were successful. Priyadarshan gained recognition as a serious director with the successful family drama &quot;Thalavattam&quot;. His Tamil film &quot;Chinnamanikkuyile&quot; remained unreleased, while his work in Malayalam continued with &quot;Cheppu&quot;, which was a success.

=== 1988–1998 ===
1988 was a significant year in Priyadarshan&#x27;s career. He directed &quot;Vellanakalude Nadu&quot;, scripted by Sreenivasan, starring Mohanlal. The film revolved around corruption, land mafia, and social issues, becoming one of the most recognisable films in Priyadarshan&#x27;s career at that time. Then came &quot;Aryan&quot;, an action film based on the Mumbai underworld, scripted by T. Damodaran, which ran for 150 days in theatres. &quot;Chithram&quot;, Priyadarshan&#x27;s biggest hit, was also released in 1988. &quot;Chithram&quot; ran for 366 days in theatres and set collection records, later broken by his own film, &quot;Kilukkam&quot; in 1991. &quot;Oru Muthassi Katha&quot; and &quot;Mukunthetta Sumitra Vilikkunnu&quot; completed his 5 releases of 1988. However, he did not have hits in 1990 with &quot;Kadathanadan Ambadi&quot; and &quot;Akkare Akkare Akkare&quot;. In 1991, Priyadarshan released &quot;Kilukkam&quot; with Mohanlal, Jagathi Sreekumar and Revathi. &quot;Kilukkam&quot; broke collection records and is considered one of the best films from the Priyadarshan-Mohanlal team. His next three films, &quot;Abhimanyu&quot; (1991), &quot;Advaitham&quot; (1992), and &quot;Thenmavin Kombathu&quot; (1994) ran for 100 days in theatres. Both &quot;Midhunam&quot; (1993) and &quot;Minnaram&quot; (1994) were able to make response in cinemas. Priyadarshan was invited by Shri. M. Karunanidhi to direct a film for his son&#x27;s production house, resulting in his Tamil debut with &quot;Gopura Vasalile&quot;. In 1991, he also made a Telugu film film, &quot;Nirnayam&quot; when Nagarjuna approached him to remake his Malayalam film &quot;Vandanam&quot; in Telugu. In 1992, Priyadarshan debuted in Bollywood with &quot;Muskurahat&quot;, a remake of his own Malayalam film &quot;Kilukkam&quot;, which flopped.

In 1993, he made a comeback in Hindi with &quot;Gardish&quot;, an adaptation of the Malayalam film &quot;Kireedom&quot;, written by A. K. Lohithadas. In 1994, Priyadarshan directed his second and last Telugu film to date, &quot;Gandeevam&quot;, starring Balakrishna. He directed the Miss World 1996 event in Bangalore, gaining national recognition. In 1996, Priyadarshan released &quot;Kalapani&quot;, an epic period film about the Indian independence struggle, scripted by T. Damodaran, starring Mohanlal, Tabu, Prabhu and Amrish Puri with music by Ilaiyaraja. &quot;Kalapani&quot; helped advance his career. Originally filmed in Malayalam, it was dubbed and released in Tamil, Telugu, and Hindi simultaneously. &quot;Kalapani&quot; earned him several awards. In 1997, Priyadarshan directed two successful films, &quot;Chandralekha&quot; in Malayalam and &quot;Virasat&quot;, a Hindi adaptation of Bharathan&#x27;s&#x27;s Tamil film &quot;Thevar Magan&quot;. In 1998, Priyadarshan directed three films: &quot;Saat Rang Ke Sapne&quot;, a remake of his own &quot;Thenmavin Kombathu&quot;, and &quot;Doli Saja Ke Rakhna&quot;, with a story adapted from &quot;Fazil&quot;″s &quot;Aniyathi Pravu&quot; and &quot;Kabhi na Kabhi&quot;; all three failed at the box office. Priyadarshan collaborated with Mammooty in 1999 for &quot;Megham&quot; after a long gap.

=== 2000–2016 ===
In 2000, &quot;Hera Pheri&quot; was released in Hindi. &quot;Hera Pheri&quot;, an adaptation of the Malayalam film &quot;Ramjirao Speaking&quot; (1989), was a box-office hit. Starring Akshay Kumar, Sunil Shetty, Tabu and Paresh Rawal, the film is considered a landmark in Hindi cinema and established the Priyadarshan-Akshay Kumar team. After &quot;Hera Pheri&quot;, Paresh Rawal became a regular in Priyadarshan&#x27;s films. This was followed by a series of Hindi films including &quot;Yeh Teraa Ghar Yeh Meraa Ghar&quot;, &quot;Hungama&quot;, &quot;Hulchul&quot;, &quot;Garam Masala&quot;, and &quot;Kyon Ki&quot;. In 2000, Priyadarshan directed the Malayalam-Tamil bilingual &quot;Raakilipattu&quot; (&quot;Snegithiye&quot; in Tamil) starring Tabu and Jyothika, with a story adapted from the Marathi film &quot;Bindhaast&quot;. The experimental film with an all-female cast received critical acclaim. The Malayalam and dubbed Hindi version, &quot;Friendship&quot;, was released seven years later in 2007.

Priyadarshan&#x27;s English language epic period film titled &quot;The Last Revolutionary&quot; produced by 20th Century Fox, based on the life of Indian freedom fighter Chandrasekhar Azad was planned for filming in 2001, but was shelved. During this time, Kamal Haasan was working on &quot;Anbe Sivam&quot; and approached Priyadarshan to direct it. Pre-production commenced; but Priyadarshan left the project due to creative differences.; Sundar C. was then brought in to direct the film.

Priyadarshan made the comedy film &quot;Kakkakuyil&quot; in 2001, reuniting Mohanlal and Mukesh, which was successful in the 1980s and 1990s. The film was a box-office hit. His other two Malayalam films, &quot;Kilichundan Mampazham&quot; and &quot;Vettam&quot; released in 2003 and 2004, had an average run at the box office, leading him to focus on Bollywood. In Hindi, Priyadarshan continued his success with &quot;Chup Chup Ke&quot;, &quot;Bhagam Bhag&quot;, &quot;Malamaal Weekly&quot;, &quot;Dhol&quot;, &quot;Bhool Bhulaiyaa&quot;, &quot;De Dana Dan&quot; and &quot;Mere Baap Pehle Aap&quot;. However, subsequent films &quot;Billu&quot;, &quot;Bumm Bumm Bole&quot;, &quot;Khatta Meeta&quot;, &quot;Aakrosh&quot; and &quot;Tezz&quot; did not meet expectations. In 2013, &quot;Rangrezz&quot; also failed at the box office.

Priyadarshan released &quot;Kanchivaram&quot;, a film about weavers in Kanchipuram. Prakash Raj won the National Film Award for Best Actor in 2008 for his performance. &quot;Kanchivaram&quot; also won awards at film festivals.

Priyadarshan returned to Malayalam films with &quot;Arabeem Ottakom P. Madhavan Nayarum in Oru Marubhoomikkadha&quot;, starring Mohanlal. The 2013 film &quot;Geethaanjali&quot; starring Mohanlal as Dr. Sunny Joseph, and the 2014 film &quot;Aamayum Muyalum&quot; did not perform well at the box office.

In late 2015, Priyadarshan announced a crime thriller in Malayalam with Mohanlal. The production was confirmed, and the title &quot;Oppam&quot; was announced in December 2015. The director began working on the film, delaying another big-budget film starring Mohanlal due to weather in Russia. The screenplay and dialogues, written by Priyadarshan based on a story by Govind Vijayan, received positive reviews and became a blockbuster, breaking records and becoming the highest-grossing Malayalam film of the year within 16 days of release.

=== 2018–present ===
In early 2018, he began pre-production on &quot;&quot;, a Malayalam language historical period film set in the 16th century. The film, starring Mohanlal, is based on the battle exploits of Kunjali Marakkar IV—the naval chieftain of the Zamorin of Calicut who organised the first naval defense of the Indian coast by safeguarding Calicut from Portuguese invasion for almost a century. Released on 2 December 2021, it received mixed reviews and failed at the box office. Before the release of &quot;Marakkar,&quot;, a spiritual sequel to his 2003 Hindi film Hungama, titled Hungama 2 was released directly on 23 July 2021 on Disney+ Hotstar and received negative reviews. The film was loosely based on Priyadarshan&#x27;s 1994 Malayalam film Minnaram.

In 2023, he produced and directed &quot;Corona Papers,&quot;, a Malayalam film starring Shane Nigam. The film, an official remake of the Tamil film 8 Thottakkal (inspired by Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s 1949 Stray Dog), was released on 6 April 2023 to positive reviews, and had a moderate performance in the box office. In the same year, he directed the Tamil film &quot;Appatha&quot; starring Urvashi in the lead role, released directly on 29 July 2023 on JioCinema.

<doc id="805893" wikidata="Q2662037" url="?curid=805893" title="Akihiko Yoshida">
<text>is a Japanese video game artist. Yoshida was born in 1967 and joined Square in 1995, before the company merged with Enix. He then left Square Enix in September 2013 and became freelance. In October 2014, he became the company director of CyDesignation, a subsidiary of Cygames.
He is well known for his work on the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. He is a frequent collaborator of game designer Yasumi Matsuno.

==Biography==
In 1995, Yoshida joined Square and with each project he took on, he experimented with different styles of graphic design. He has compared his use of color to that of &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; character designer Tetsuya Nomura, and the keeping of color consistent between the characters and the game world.

For the game &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot;, pencil etchings and CG coloration were used together for the first time. Yoshida considers the tone and style of the game to be the &quot;ideal&quot; art style and thus within his comfort zone. The original tarot card illustrations for the game were done for dot graphics, and reflected a limited color index. When remade for the PlayStation Portable, some staff wanted to use the original illustrations, but Yoshida requested to redraw the illustrations with more detail and color than was possible or required previously.

In designing the character of Vaan for &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot;, initially the character was &quot;rugged&quot; and &quot;tough&quot;, but after considering the demographics of the games audience, the character was made younger and thinner. Once the actors motion captured and voice actor Kohei Takeda did the part, the character became slightly less effeminate than was originally designed.
Yoshida set out to create a cast of characters who looked unlike any previous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; cast. He also stated that the character reflected what Japanese audiences want, but that they try to design characters everyone likes.

In addition to his work in video games, Yoshida designed the original characters for the 2018 directorial debut film of screenwriter Mari Okada entitled &quot;&quot;.
==Reception==
He has been cited as a &quot;fantastic&quot; artist by Kotaku, and his work on &quot;Vagrant Story&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; was called &quot;brilliant&quot; and &quot;refined&quot; by IGN.

<doc id="805895" wikidata="Q239429" url="?curid=805895" title="Hiroshi Minagawa">
<text>, also known by the nickname &quot;Nigoro&quot;, is a Japanese video game artist, designer and director.

==Career==
Minagawa had worked at Quest Corporation alongside his colleagues Yasumi Matsuno and Akihiko Yoshida before they all decided to switch to Square in 1995. He continued collaborating with his co-workers as the art director of &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; and &quot;Vagrant Story&quot;. For the &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; project, he was originally the graphics and real-time visual director. However, when the original director Matsuno left the company due to an illness, Minagawa was put in charge of directing the game in collaboration with Hiroyuki Ito. He felt that the pressure of working on a &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; installment helped him and influenced his decisions. Minagawa most enjoyed the period in which the team continued to come up with new ideas, but he ultimately had to decide to abandon many features in order to finish the game.

Following the positive reception of &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions&quot;, a decision was made to remake Quest&#x27;s &quot;Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together&quot;. Minagawa directed the game and took on the laborious task of assembling the original 1995 staff members—including Matsuno—who were now working at different companies. Upon finishing his work on the project, Minagawa was asked to join the &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot; team as the lead user interface and web designer. This was part of a plan to salvage the game after its initial negative reception by critics and players. Director Naoki Yoshida considered the fact that one of the &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; directors was now solely responsible for one aspect of &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot; an indication of how serious Square Enix was about improving the game. A relaunch for the game, called &quot;Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn&quot;, was released to critical acclaim in August 2013. Minagawa served as art director for &quot;Final Fantasy XVI&quot;, which released on June 22, 2023. After game director Hiroshi Takai described a visual style with a similar feel to &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, Minagawa sought to blend character designer Kazuya Takahashi&#x27;s light art style with the dark tone of the setting, which he described as his biggest challenge during development.

<doc id="805897" wikidata="Q7901790" url="?curid=805897" title="Useful art">
<text>Useful art, or useful arts or technics, is concerned with the skills and methods of practical subjects such as manufacture and craftsmanship. The phrase was used during the Victorian era and earlier as an antonym to the performing art and the fine art.

The term &quot;useful Arts&quot; is used in the United States Constitution, Article One, Section 8, Clause 8, which is the basis of United States patent and copyright law:

&quot;To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries;...&quot;
According to the US Supreme Court, the phrase &quot;useful Arts&quot; is meant to reference inventions. There is controversy in the Court as to whether or not this includes business methods. In the majority opinion for &quot;In re Bilski&quot;, Justice Anthony Kennedy states &quot;the Patent Act leaves open the possibility that there are at least some processes that can be fairly described as business methods that are within patentable subject matter under §101.&quot; At the appellate level, Federal Circuit Court Judge Mayer disagreed because he did not consider the claimed business method to be within the useful arts.

<doc id="805905" wikidata="Q7678533" url="?curid=805905" title="Taku Murata">
<text>is a video game programmer working for Square Enix (formerly Square), as well as the general manager of the research and development division of the company. He was born in 1965 and joined Square in 1991. He is most notable as the main programmer for &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; and &quot;Vagrant Story&quot;. He also worked on the development of the PlayOnline service. Murata also helped promote a new proprietary cross platform game development tool called Crystal Tools. His latest work was on &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; as the programming supervisor of the game.

==Biography==

===Games===
During the creation of &quot;Vagrant Story&quot;, Murata and other team members decided that a &quot;real time 3D&quot; was the way to go, though the scale of the game and the heightened expectations that came with it made him feel &quot;uneasy&quot;.

Later, while supervising development on &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot;, he stated that development and innovation became such a protracted affair that the game was in danger of being technically obsolete upon release, so 70% of their staff was assigned to improve the quality of the game&#x27;s art assets. In this way, each of the three development priorities (innovation, quality and volume) were all held together, though innovation remained top priority.

===Crystal Tools===
Beginning in 2004, Square Enix decided there was a need to create a common 3D data format, and as a result a Research and Development Division was established in September 2006. At the 2007 Game Developers Conference, Murata noted that the development team was using proprietary software to allow &quot;real time display&quot; of PlayStation 2 output to a television to see immediately and precisely how a game would look. At the Game Developers Conference 2008, Murata did a presentation called &quot;The Technology of Final Fantasy&quot; during which he revealed that they had been working on a PlayStation 3 exclusive game development engine called &quot;White Engine&quot;, and it had already reached Version 1.0. He also announced that Version 1.1, or &quot;Crystal Tools&quot;, was finished in September 2007. Murata later said in an interview that White Engine was meant to be a code name, and they wanted to have an official name that had something to do with Square Enix, and Crystal both sounded right and reflected &quot;many different colors&quot;. Finishing his 2008 speech, he stated that the technology would be used on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PC and a &quot;scaled down&quot; version for the Wii, and that &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy Versus XIII&quot;, and a new MMORPG would both make use of the technology. The developers working with the engine, in keeping with the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; style, requested many closeups and stylization of characters. When asked if Square might license the engine to other companies to develop games with, he stated that Squares focus was elsewhere, and that there was not yet enough documentation to do that.

Seven of their singles placed in the top 40 of the British singles chart. Their most recent album, &quot;Audio Vertigo&quot;, was released on 22 March 2024.

In 2008, Elbow won the Mercury Music Prize for their album &quot;The Seldom Seen Kid.&quot; In 2009, they won the Brit Award for Best British Group. The same year, the song &quot;One Day Like This&quot; won the Ivor Novello Award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically. In October 2011 &quot;NME&quot; placed it at number 41 on its list of &quot;150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years&quot;. After featuring in the 2012 Summer Olympics Closing Ceremony, the single peaked at No. 4 in the UK Singles Chart. In 2012, they released &quot;First Steps&quot;, the BBC theme for the 2012 London Olympics.

==History==
===1997–2001: Formation and first EPs===
 Potter asked Garvey to sing in a band he was in with drummer Richard Jupp and bassist Pete Turner. Together, the four formed the band Mr. Soft, named after the song by Cockney Rebel (the name was later shortened to Soft). Potter&#x27;s brother Craig then joined the band on keyboards. That year the band played their first gig together at the Corner Pin pub in Ramsbottom.

They changed their name a second time to Elbow in 1997, inspired by a line in the BBC TV drama &quot;The Singing Detective&quot; in which the character Philip Marlow describes the word &#x27;elbow&#x27; as the loveliest word in the English language. After winning a local Battle of the Bands, the band signed with Island Records and recorded their first album with producer Steve Osborne at Real World Studios. However, Island sold out to major label Universal. The band was dropped in a mass cull and the album was not released.

Elbow continued to record with independent label Ugly Man Records and released &quot;The Noisebox EP&quot;, &quot;The Newborn EP&quot;, and &quot;The Any Day Now EP&quot;. These releases garnered extensive airplay on BBC Radio 1.

===2001–2004: &quot;Asleep in the Back&quot; and &quot;Cast of Thousands&quot;===
Elbow&#x27;s debut album &quot;Asleep in the Back&quot; was released in May 2001 on V2 Records. The album was written over the course of six years, and contains six rerecorded tracks from the Real World Studios sessions. &quot;Asleep in the Back&quot; was shortlisted for the Mercury Music Prize and earned the band a BRIT Award nomination for Best New British Band.

The band&#x27;s second album &quot;Cast of Thousands&quot; was released in August 2003. The title of the album is a reference to their performance at the 2002 Glastonbury Festival, where they recorded the audience singing, &quot;We still believe in love, so fuck you&quot;. The recording is featured on the song &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot;.

In 2004 Elbow toured Cuba, playing songs from &quot;Asleep in the Back&quot; and &quot;Cast of Thousands&quot; at venues in and around Havana. British documentary maker Irshad Ashraf filmed a large portion of the tour. The resulting short film was shown at film festivals in 2004, but remains commercially unavailable.

===2004–2006: &quot;Leaders of the Free World&quot;===
Their third album, &quot;Leaders of the Free World&quot;, was released in 2005. It was self-produced at Blueprint Studios in Salford, a studio the band hired for the sessions. They teamed up with video artists The Soup Collective to produce an integrated music and video DVD.

In mid-2006, Elbow headlined the Ukula Bright Lights Festival in Toronto&#x27;s Distillery District.

===2006–2009: &quot;The Seldom Seen Kid&quot;===
In 2006, the band moved to Fiction Records and completed their fourth studio album &quot;The Seldom Seen Kid&quot; in late 2007, which was produced and mixed by Craig Potter. The album was released in March 2008 and sold over 1 million copies.

On 9 September 2008, they were awarded the Mercury Music Prize for &quot;The Seldom Seen Kid&quot;, and in May 2009 the band won two Ivor Novello Awards: &quot;One Day Like This&quot; won the main award for Best Song, and &quot;Grounds for Divorce&quot; was voted Best Contemporary Song. Elbow were also awarded Best International Band at the Meteor Awards in Dublin on 17 March 2009.

Elbow and Bournemouth-based band Air Traffic embarked on an extensive North American tour in May 2008, which was very well received by the media including Blender and Spin magazine. Elbow performed at Delamere Forest in Cheshire on 14 June 2008 as part of the Forestry Commission&#x27;s 2008 music tours, supported by I Am Kloot. The band commented before the show, &quot;We always love playing gigs in unusual places. We&#x27;ve never done a gig in a forest before so we&#x27;re really looking forward to it.&quot; Elbow appeared on the Other Stage at the Glastonbury Festival on 28 June 2008, joined on stage by violinists and cellists. They performed in the Obelisk Arena at the Latitude Festival on 19 July 2008, and in August played at the Electric Picnic festival. On 9 September, they performed at the National Movie Awards broadcast on ITV, and appeared on BBC2&#x27;s &quot;Later Live&quot; show hosted by Jools Holland on 23 September.

On 17 January 2009, Elbow gave an exclusive performance of their album &quot;The Seldom Seen Kid&quot; for BBC Radio 2 and BBC 6 Music together with the BBC Concert Orchestra and London-based chamber choir Chantage at Abbey Road Studios (first broadcast on 31 January 2009). On 14 March 2009, they played Wembley Arena. On 3 July 2009, Elbow played to an audience of 80,000 at Rock Werchter. The next day, Elbow played for approximately 15,000 at Roskilde Festival, Denmark; on stage, Garvey remarked that &quot;last time we played in Denmark, 7 people came.&quot; They performed with The Hallé Orchestra and Youth Choir at the Bridgewater Hall as part of the Manchester International Festival on 8 and 9 July 2009. These concerts featured specially-commissioned orchestral and choral arrangements of material spanning all 4 albums. The Hallé musicians and Garvey singers were positioned just to the right of conductor and arranger Joe Duddell. On 11 July 2009 they played the Main Stage at Oxegen 2009 at Punchestown Racecourse, County Kildare. The band performed on the Main Stage at T in the Park in Balado, Kinross, Scotland, on 12 July 2009. And on 18 July, they played the &quot;Escenario Verde&quot; at FIB 2009 in Benicassim, Spain. They opened for Coldplay at several stops on the Viva la Vida Tour&#x27;s 2009 North American leg. They performed at All Points West Music &amp; Arts Festival in Jersey City and the Osheaga Festival in Montreal. On 4 August 2009, Elbow headlined their second show at the 9:30 Club in Washington, DC and on 8 August 2009, they performed at the Center Stage Theatre in Atlanta. They opened for U2 during their August 2009 UK shows at Wembley Stadium in London and the Sheffield Don Valley Stadium.

===2009–2011: &quot;Build a Rocket Boys!&quot;===
In November 2009, Britain&#x27;s long-running arts series &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; aired a 60-minute documentary about Elbow on ITV. Combining live footage of Elbow&#x27;s September 2009 live performance at Manchester Evening News Arena with an interview between Guy Garvey and presenter Melvyn Bragg, the first half of the documentary focused on Elbow&#x27;s early career and attempts to get a record deal. The second half discussed songs from &quot;Asleep in the Back&quot;, &quot;Leaders of the Free World&quot; and &quot;The Seldom Seen Kid&quot;. The documentary also contained sequences of Craig Potter demonstrating Elbow&#x27;s unusual recording techniques at Blueprint Studios, Mark Potter driving around Elbow&#x27;s old neighbourhood in Bury, Greater Manchester, Pete Turner showing cameras around Manchester&#x27;s Northern Quarter where the band played their first gigs as Elbow and sequences of Guy Garvey reading through old and new lyric books. Some of the lines Garvey recited became the lyrics to &quot;Jesus Was a Rochdale Girl&quot; and &quot;High Ideals&quot;.

Elbow&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Build a Rocket Boys!&quot;, was released on 7 March 2011. Upon its release, the album hit Number 2 in the UK album charts, the highest of any Elbow album to date. &quot;Build a Rocket Boys!&quot; also earned the band their third nomination for the Mercury Prize.

The album had the working title &#x27;Lippy Kids&#x27;. Guy Garvey told BBC 6 Music&#x27;s Shaun Keaveney &quot;It&#x27;s quite a nostalgic thing. I&#x27;ve got a thing about growing up. Not needing to, but a certain period of your life when – well kids are called &#x27;hoodies&#x27; these days aren&#x27;t they when they reach their teens. I remember it being an amazing important time, so I&#x27;ve written a lot about that.&quot;

The album was supported by the Build a Rocket Boys! Tour. On Saturday 11 June 2011, Elbow played at Pinkpop in the Netherlands. On Saturday 25 June 2011, Elbow played the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury 2011, in a performance which music journalist Stuart Maconie described as &quot;career-defining&quot;. Between 26 and 28 August 2011 Elbow performed at both Reading and Leeds Festivals, after a long tour of British festivals including Glastonbury 2011.

===2011–2012: &quot;Dead in the Boot&quot;===
In November 2011, it was announced that Elbow were to compose the theme for the BBC&#x27;s 2012 Olympic coverage. The six-minute anthem entitled &quot;First Steps&quot; was recorded with the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra and the NovaVox gospel choir. Elbow were also one of the few artists chosen to perform at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony, where they performed &quot;Open Arms&quot; and &quot;One Day Like This&quot; as the athletes began their entrance into the stadium. This resulted in a sales increase of over 1000%, among the highest of any performers.

Elbow headlined the 2012 Latitude Festival on 14 July. Elbow told Festival Republic that they would only headline the Saturday of Latitude 2012 so they could celebrate the French Revolution by closing their set with a large fireworks display in honour of Bastille Day.

A compilation album called &quot;Dead in the Boot&quot; was released on 27 August 2012. Described by Garvey as &quot;a real late night vibe&quot;, it features B-sides and &quot;hard to find non-album tracks&quot;. The title is a reference to Elbow&#x27;s debut album &quot;Asleep in the Back&quot;.

===2012–2014: &quot;The Take Off and Landing of Everything&quot;===
In June 2011, Garvey confirmed to the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; that the band had started working on new material for the follow-up to &quot;Build a Rocket Boys!&quot;, saying, &quot;Rich [drummer Richard Jupp] went into the studio and recorded several different drum patterns for me. I&#x27;ll go away next week and try and write lyrics for them. We&#x27;ve never worked this way before, but we&#x27;ll see what happens.&quot; The band started recording the album in November 2012, with Turner telling &quot;Q&quot; magazine that the new album would be &quot;experimental&quot;: &quot;We&#x27;ve been going very left-field with things. We are trying out new things&quot;. On 30 September 2013, the band simultaneously announced a live album, &quot;Live at Jodrell Bank&quot;, and the release date of their next studio album as 10 March 2014. Garvey said in an interview with &quot;Q&quot; that the Manchester band&#x27;s sixth LP would be called &quot;Carry Her Carry Me&quot;, after previously having the working title of &quot;All at Once&quot;.

The group spent two weeks working on the early stages of the album at Peter Gabriel&#x27;s Real World Studios near Bath. Garvey told &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s the least aptly-named studio in the world. Real World? Is it fuck. But when you&#x27;re there, you get six months work done in two weeks. To go and live and breathe your record without the distractions of the rest of life, you make creative decisions you would not have made at home.&quot;

In January 2014, the band announced that the album&#x27;s title had changed to &quot;The Take Off and Landing of Everything&quot;. The album was released on 10 March 2014 and debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, becoming the group&#x27;s first chart-topper.

=== 2015–2018: Departure of Richard Jupp and &quot;Little Fictions&quot; ===
In July 2015, Elbow released the &quot;Lost Worker Bee&quot; EP. Announced in June to the NME, Garvey stated &quot;Elbow are involved in various solo projects and collaborative endeavours for the next few months and we just felt we really wanted to get &#x27;something&#x27; away to tide fans over until the next album.&quot;

In October 2015, Guy Garvey released his first solo album &quot;Courting the Squall&quot;, preceded by a short UK tour.

On 13 January 2016, Elbow released a 45-second long video filmed by Mark Potter with the tagline &quot;Elbow 7. vibes.&quot;, showing the band working on guitar, keyboard and rhythm parts, as a possible indication that the band were in early stages of writing for their seventh album.

It was announced on 6 March 2016, that drummer Richard Jupp would be leaving the group and their forthcoming album would go ahead without him. They have since worked with session drummer Alex Reeves, taking an official photo with him in 2019.

On 27 July 2016, Elbow announced that their new album would be released on 3 February 2017, and would coincide with a British tour that would take place late February through March of the same year. They later released dates and a pre-order link through their website, with the initial cover art being a white background with black text reading &quot;Elbow&quot;.

On 6 December 2016, Elbow released further details of the new record. It was revealed the title was &quot;Little Fictions&quot;, and that it would be released on CD, on vinyl, for digital download, and as a limited edition boxset, all available through their webstore. The lead single, &quot;Magnificent (She Says)&quot;, debuted on Jo Whiley&#x27;s BBC Radio 2 show and was later added to the Elbow YouTube page. On 10 February 2017, &quot;Little Fictions&quot; reached number 1 on the UK Albums Chart, making the record their second to top the chart.

The band kicked off their US Tour in support of the album on 1 November with a sold-out show at The Paradise Rock Club in Boston, Massachusetts.

The band performed &quot;Magnificent (She Says)&quot; on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot; on 2 November 2017. Also recorded, but not aired was a shorter version of &quot;One Day Like This&quot; which was released to the Tonight Show&#x27;s YouTube channel.

On 10 November 2017, Elbow released a cover of &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot; by The Beatles. It was used in the 2017 John Lewis Christmas advert, titled &quot;Moz the Monster&quot;.

=== 2019: &quot;Giants of All Sizes&quot;===
On 1 August 2019, Elbow released the track &quot;Dexter &amp; Sinister&quot; on their official YouTube channel.

On 7 August 2019, Elbow announced their eighth studio album &quot;Giants of All Sizes&quot; for release on 11 October 2019.

On 4 October 2019, Elbow released the track &#x27;White Noise White Heat&#x27; on their official YouTube channel.

=== 2021: &quot;Flying Dream 1&quot;===
On 1 September 2021, Elbow announced their ninth studio album &quot;Flying Dream 1&quot; for release on 19 November 2021.

They have released two songs from the album called &#x27;The Seldom Seen Kid&#x27; and &#x27;Six Words&#x27;

On 4 June 2022 the band performed the song &quot;One Day Like This&quot; at the Platinum Party at the Palace.

=== 2024: &quot;Audio Vertigo and Alex Reeves Joining&quot; ===
On 25 January 2024, Elbow released single &quot;Lover&#x27;s Leap&quot; and announced their tenth studio album &quot;Audio Vertigo&quot;, released on 22 March 2024. Touring and session drummer Alex Reeves contributed to the writing of the album, which led to him becoming a full member of the band. Following delays in the opening of the new Co-op Live arena in Manchester, causing the cancellation of several performances by other artists, Elbow gave the first performance at the venue on the evening of the 14th May, following their support act The Waeve.

On 7 November 2024, Elbow released single &quot;Adriana Again&quot; as the first track of an upcoming EP for release in 2025, along with a music video featuring a mystery band. The band wanted to give the sound from Audio Vertigo &quot;another crack&quot;, as Garvey put it.

On 24 February 2025 they announced a US/Canada tour. This marks the first North America shows since 2020 and the first proper North America tour since 2017.

==Contributions and collaborations==
Elbow recorded an acoustic cover of Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s &quot;Independent Women&quot; for a BBC Radio 1 session which was turned into a popular web animation by Joel Veitch, featuring a band of flat-capped northern kittens &quot;performing&quot; the song.

In January 2001, Elbow donated their unreleased original version of &quot;Scattered Black and Whites&quot; to Manchester Aid to Kosovo&#x27;s compilation &quot;Cohesion&quot;.

The band released several songs for War Child compilations. In 2002 Elbow recorded a cover of &quot;Something in the Air&quot; for the compilation &quot;1 Love&quot;. Elbow contributed the song &quot;Snowball&quot; to another compilation, &quot;Help!: A Day in the Life&quot;, in September 2005. The song was originally recorded for the &quot;Cast of Thousands&quot; record but omitted from the final album as the band felt it did not fit; the political lyrics suited the Warchild compilation. In 2009 Elbow contributed their cover of U2&#x27;s &quot;Running to Stand Still&quot; to &quot;War Child Presents Heroes&quot;. Garvey explained: &quot;When the band first met each other aged 17, Mark and Craig&#x27;s father Gareth would lend us his Volvo to get our gear around. It seemed that for a year and a half all that we listened to in that car was &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot;. I remember the excitement every time a U2 album was released, we just loved them. The first song we ever covered together before we had enough of our own songs to do a performance was &#x27;Running to Stand Still&#x27;. For &#x27;Heroes&#x27; we&#x27;ve changed the order of things but kept every musical theme in the song. We wrote it with the members of U2 in mind. War Child do exactly what it says on the tin. These kids shouldn&#x27;t be in such circumstances in the first place, but they are, so thank god someone&#x27;s doing something about it&quot;.

A cover of &quot;Working Class Hero&quot; was recorded by the band as part of a John Lennon tribute album, &quot;Lennon: Covered Vol. 1&quot;, given away with Q Magazine in 2005. A The The cover of &quot;August and September&quot; was recorded as part of a tribute album &quot;Q Covered: Best of 86/06&quot; in 2006.

In 2010, Peter Gabriel released a version of Elbow&#x27;s song &quot;Mirrorball&quot; on his album &quot;Scratch My Back&quot;. In return, Elbow recorded a version of Gabriel&#x27;s song &quot;Mercy Street&quot; from his 1986 album &quot;So&quot;, which appeared on the album of Gabriel cover versions &quot;And I&#x27;ll Scratch Yours&quot;, released in 2013.

The song &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; appeared in the 2004 film &quot;9 Songs&quot;, and the song &quot;The Night Will Always Win&quot; was used in the opening credits and title sequence of 2012&#x27;s &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops II&quot;.

Elbow created the song &quot;What Time Do You Call This?&quot; for the film Man Up, where it was featured in the end credits.

Elbow covered the song &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot; by The Beatles for the 2017 John Lewis Christmas commercial.

==Musical style and influences==
Elbow&#x27;s musical style has been described as alternative rock, indie rock, indie pop, Britpop, art rock, progressive rock, dream pop, post-rock, and post-Britpop. Elbow have cited a number of influences on their music, including Genesis (in particular the progressive rock years featuring Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett), Talk Talk and Radiohead. Guy Garvey has said: &quot;I grew up listening to every Genesis record. I learned to write harmonies by listening to Peter Gabriel.&quot; The song &quot;Newborn&quot; from Elbow&#x27;s debut album was directly influenced by &quot;Entangled&quot; from the Genesis album &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot;. Garvey has also said &quot;there&#x27;d be no Elbow without Radiohead&quot;. He credits the band&#x27;s sense of dynamics to the influence of Talk Talk and has said: &quot;Volume dynamics are an essential part of classical music, but a lost art with guitar music. I think it&#x27;s incredibly boring and shortsighted if a band sticks with just one sound song for song. An album should take people on a journey.&quot;

<doc id="805911" wikidata="Q1196596" url="?curid=805911" title="Hitoshi Sakimoto">
<text>is a Japanese composer and sound producer. He is best known for scoring the video games &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot;, though he has composed soundtracks for numerous other games. Sakimoto first played music and video games in elementary school and began composing music professionally in 1988. He worked at the video game company Square from 1998 to 2000, before founding the music and sound production company Basiscape in 2002.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Sakimoto was born on February 26, 1969, in Tokyo, Japan. He began developing an interest in music beginning in elementary school, when he taught himself to play the piano and electronic organ and participated in some brass and rock bands. A fan of video games, he began creating his own games in junior high school with some friends. While in his senior high school years, Sakimoto wrote for the computer magazine &quot;Oh!FM&quot; and compiled data about pieces of music he liked, becoming a self-professed &quot;computer, games, and music geek&quot;.

Sakimoto started composing for games when he was 16, and was paid to both create the music and the program to play it for several games. Composing for these games was the first time he had ever composed music for any instrument. His debut as a professional gaming composer came in 1988, when he and his friend Masaharu Iwata, whom he has worked with on numerous later titles, scored the shooter game &quot;Revolter&quot;, published by ASCGroup for the NEC PC-8801. Sakimoto also created the synthesizer driver &quot;Terpsichorean&quot; to enhance the sound quality of the game&#x27;s music; the synthesizer driver has been implemented into many games throughout the Japanese game market in the early 1990s. Despite &quot;Revolter&quot;″s success, he continued with his previous goal to become a video game programmer rather than a composer; however, his friends and colleagues encouraged him to continue composing game music. The recognition he gained within the gaming industry jump-started his career.

===Career===

After &quot;Revolter&quot;, Sakimoto&#x27;s music and synthesizer driver earned him immediate recognition in the industry, resulting in him being asked to score several PC-9801 and Mega Drive games such as &quot;Starship Rendezvous&quot; and &quot;Gauntlet IV&quot;, as well as use his driver both in the scores he wrote and for other games. Between 1990 and 1992, Sakimoto worked on over 20 different video games for several different companies such as Toshiba EMI, Artec, and Data East. It was during this time that he composed his first solo score in 1990 for &quot;Bubble Ghost&quot;.

Sakimoto&#x27;s first encounter with mainstream success in Japan came about in 1993 when he composed &quot;Ogre Battle: March of the Black Queen&quot;. The game was directed by Yasumi Matsuno, and since the release of the title, he has chosen Sakimoto as a regular for his development team at Quest and later Square. Sakimoto also worked on 14 other titles that year, including &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; and &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot;. Over the next few years, he would go on to compose for or work on over 40 more titles such as &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot;. In 1997, Sakimoto composed the score for &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot;, which made him internationally famous, and was the score he was best known for outside Japan until at least 2006. This led to him joining Square as an employee, where he worked on &quot;Vagrant Story&quot;, his only score as an employee of Square. After leaving in 2000 he became freelance and went on to compose &quot;Breath of Fire V&quot; and &quot;Tactics Ogre: The Knight of Lodis&quot; for Capcom and Quest respectively. After a couple of years of planning he formed his own music production company, Basiscape, in October 2002.

===Basiscape===
Basiscape is a music and sound production studio founded by Sakimoto in 2002. The company has contributed to video games, anime, and films. Sakimoto says that he left Square to found the company because he wanted more freedom in choosing his projects. At its founding, it had only three members: Sakimoto, Iwata, and Manabu Namiki. Through Basiscape, Sakimoto continued to compose for several different companies, including Square Enix. The company expanded in the mid-2000s with the addition of Mitsuhiro Kaneda, Kimihiro Abe, Noriyuki Kamikura, Yoshimi Kudo, and Azusa Chiba. Members of the company are free to procure personal work as well as collaborate with other members on projects. The company launched a record label in 2009.

===Other projects===
Sakimoto has also been involved in non-gaming projects during his career. He contributed one track each to the albums &quot;Ten Plants&quot; (1998) and &quot;2197&quot; (1999), which feature music from various well-known artists. Sakimoto collaborated with singer Lia in 2005 to create the music for the album &quot;Colors of Life&quot;. He composed the music for two anime series; &quot;Romeo x Juliet&quot; (2007) and &quot;The Tower of Druaga: The Aegis of Uruk&quot; (2008); as well as the original video animation (OVA) &quot;Legend of Phoenix ~Layla Hamilton Monogatari~&quot; in 2005.

==Performances==

Sakimoto has made numerous appearances at video game concerts that have performed his compositions. He, along with Yoko Shimomura and Michael Salvatori, were special guests at a July 2006 &quot;Play! A Video Game Symphony&quot; event at the Orchestra Hall in Detroit. He has developed a strong relationship with the Australian-based Eminence Symphony Orchestra. Sakimoto and Yasunori Mitsuda made guest appearances at their &quot;Passion&quot; event in December 2006. In April 2007, he appeared at Eminence&#x27;s &quot;A Night in Fantasia 2007: Symphonic Games Edition&quot;, which featured three of his compositions. Sakimoto and Mitsuda collaborated with Eminence in July the same year to create &quot;Destiny: Reunion&quot;, a concert held exclusively in Japan. Eminence released &quot;Passion&quot; (2006) and &quot;Destiny: Dreamer&#x27;s Alliance&quot; (2007), two studio recorded albums that feature various compositions from the Passion and Destiny: Reunion concerts respectively. &quot;Penelo&#x27;s Theme&quot; from &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; and a medley of pieces from &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics A2&quot; were played at the &quot;Fantasy Comes Alive&quot; concert in Singapore in April 2010.

==Musical style and influences==
Sakimoto composes his music by playing the pieces &quot;briefly on the piano&quot;, and then working on a computer for more detailed arrangements. The style of Sakimoto&#x27;s compositions is mostly orchestral; he creates the orchestral sound by playing the music through a sequencer instead of using a real orchestra due to the high cost. When composing a soundtrack for a video game, Sakimoto first sits down with the director or producer of the game and works out what emotions they want the game to evoke in the player, and after making a demo for them, sets out to create music that fits that feeling. He claims that his style of composition does not change when he works on non-game works such as anime series, saying that only the tone of the pieces is different. He attributes any changes in his style over the years to his desire to constantly keep growing and learning new styles and techniques, saying that if you have not moved forward in your skill and style over time, &quot;you&#x27;ve wasted your time&quot;.

He has stated that his biggest musical influences are &quot;old techno and progressive rock&quot; groups such as the Japanese synthpop group Yellow Magic Orchestra. When he was starting out in the field of music, he went under the pseudonym &quot;YmoH.S&quot;, a reference to Yellow Magic Orchestra. He also cites the American jazz musician Chick Corea as a major influence. While creating the music for &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot;, however, his biggest musical inspiration was former regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu. Sakimoto enjoys listening to techno and jazz fusion in his spare time. While he sometimes gets inspiration while relaxing at home, Sakimoto feels that his best ideas come to him while he is at his studio concentrating. He cited &quot;Vagrant Story&quot; as one of his favorite soundtracks.

<doc id="805912" wikidata="Q574415" url="?curid=805912" title="Delayed onset muscle soreness">
<text>Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is the pain and stiffness felt in muscles after unaccustomed or strenuous exercise. The soreness is felt most strongly 24 to 72 hours after the exercise. It is thought to be caused by eccentric (lengthening) exercise, which causes small-scale damage (microtrauma) to the muscle fibers. After such exercise, the muscle adapts rapidly to prevent muscle damage, and thereby soreness, if the exercise is repeated.

Delayed onset muscle soreness is one symptom of exercise-induced muscle damage. The other is acute muscle soreness, which appears during and immediately after exercise.

==Signs and symptoms==
The soreness is perceived as a dull, aching pain in the affected muscle, often combined with tenderness and stiffness. The pain is typically felt only when the muscle is stretched, contracted or put under pressure, not when it is at rest. This tenderness, a characteristic symptom of DOMS, is also referred to as &quot;muscular mechanical hyperalgesia&quot;.

Although there is variance among exercises and individuals, the soreness from DOMS usually increases in intensity in the first 24 hours after exercise. It peaks from 24 to 72 hours, then subsides and disappears up to seven days after exercise.

==Cause==
Muscle soreness is caused by eccentric exercise, that is, exercise consisting of eccentric (lengthening) contractions of the muscle. Isometric (static) exercise causes much less soreness, and concentric (shortening) exercise causes none.

==Mechanism==
The mechanism of delayed onset muscle soreness is not completely understood, but the pain is ultimately thought to be a result of microtrauma—mechanical damage at a very small scale—to the muscles being exercised.

DOMS was first described in 1902 by Theodore Hough, who concluded that this kind of soreness is &quot;fundamentally the result of ruptures within the muscle&quot;. According to this &quot;muscle damage&quot; theory of DOMS, these ruptures are microscopic lesions at the Z-line of the muscle sarcomere. The soreness has been attributed to the increased tension force and muscle lengthening from eccentric exercise. This may cause the actin and myosin cross-bridges to separate prior to relaxation, ultimately causing greater tension on the remaining active motor units. This increases the risk of broadening, smearing, and damage to the sarcomere. When microtrauma occurs to these structures, nociceptors (pain receptors) within the muscle&#x27;s connective tissues are stimulated and cause a sensation of pain.

Another explanation for the pain associated with DOMS is the &quot;enzyme efflux&quot; theory. Following microtrauma, calcium that is normally stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum accumulates in the damaged muscles. Cellular respiration is inhibited and ATP needed to actively transport calcium back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum is produced at a lower rate. This accumulation of calcium may activate proteases and phospholipases which in turn break down and degenerate muscle protein. This causes inflammation, and in turn pain due to the accumulation of histamines, prostaglandins, and potassium.

An earlier theory posited that DOMS is connected to the build-up of lactic acid in the blood, which was thought to continue being produced following exercise. This build-up of lactic acid was thought to be a toxic metabolic waste product that caused the perception of pain at a delayed stage. This theory has been largely rejected, as concentric contractions which also produce lactic acid have been unable to cause DOMS. Additionally, lactic acid is known from multiple studies to return to normal levels within one hour of exercise, and therefore cannot cause the pain that occurs much later.

===Relation to other effects===
Although delayed onset muscle soreness is a symptom associated with muscle damage, its magnitude does not necessarily reflect the magnitude of muscle damage.

Soreness is one of the temporary changes caused in muscles by unaccustomed eccentric exercise. Other such changes include decreased muscle strength, reduced range of motion, and muscle swelling. It has been shown, however, that these changes develop independently in time from one another and that the soreness is therefore not the cause of the reduction in muscle function.

===Possible function as a warning sign===
Soreness might conceivably serve as a warning to reduce muscle activity to prevent injury or further injury. With delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) caused by eccentric exercise (muscle lengthening), it was observed that light concentric exercise (muscle shortening) during DOMS can cause initially more pain but was followed by a temporary alleviation of soreness with no adverse effects on muscle function or recovery being observed. Furthermore, eccentric exercise during DOMS was found to not exacerbate muscle damage, nor did it have an adverse effect on recovery, indicating that soreness is not necessarily a warning sign to reduce the usage of the affected muscle. However, it was also observed that a second bout of eccentric exercise within one week of the initial exercise did lead to decreased muscle function immediately afterward.

===Repeated-bout effect===
After performing an unaccustomed eccentric exercise and exhibiting severe soreness, the muscle rapidly adapts to reduce further damage from the same exercise. This is called the &quot;repeated-bout effect&quot;.

As a result of this effect, not only is the soreness reduced the next time the exercise is performed, but other indicators of muscle damage, such as swelling, reduced strength, and reduced range of motion, are also more quickly recovered from. The effect is mostly, but not wholly, specific to the exercised muscle; experiments have shown that some of the protective effects is also conferred on other muscles.

The magnitude of the effect is subject to many variations, depending for instance on the time between bouts, the number and length of eccentric contractions, and the exercise mode. It also varies between people and between indicators of muscle damage. Generally, though, the protective effect lasts for at least several weeks. It seems to gradually decrease as the time between bouts increases and is undetectable after about one year.

The first bout does not need to be as intense as the subsequent bouts to confer at least some protection against soreness. For instance, eccentric exercise performed at 40% of maximal strength has been shown to confer a protection of 20–60% from muscle damage incurred by a 100% strength exercise two to three weeks later. Also, the repeated-bout effect appears even after a relatively small number of contractions, possibly as few as two. In one study, a first bout of 10, 20 or 50 contractions provided equal protection for a second bout of 50 contractions three weeks later.

The reason for the protective effect is not yet understood. A number of possible mechanisms, which may complement one another, have been proposed. These include neural adaptations (improved use and control of the muscle by the nervous system), mechanical adaptations (increased muscle stiffness or muscle support tissue), and cellular adaptations (adaptation to inflammatory response and increased protein synthesis, among others).

==Prevention==
Delayed onset muscle soreness can be reduced or prevented by gradually increasing the intensity of a new exercise program, thereby taking advantage of the repeated-bout effect.

Soreness can theoretically be avoided by limiting exercise to concentric and isometric contractions, but eccentric contractions in some muscles are normally unavoidable during exercise, especially when muscles are fatigued. Limiting the length of eccentric muscle extensions during exercise may afford some protection against soreness, but this may also not be practical depending on the mode of exercise.

Physical activity before eccentric exercise helps to prevent delayed-onset muscle soreness.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1080/02640410400021989&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Static stretching or warming up the muscles before or after exercise does not prevent soreness.

==Treatment==
The soreness usually disappears within about 72 hours after appearing. If treatment is desired, any measure that increases blood flow to the muscle, such as low-intensity activity, massage, nerve mobilization, hot baths, or a sauna visit may help somewhat.

There is insufficient evidence to determine whether whole-body cryotherapy—compared with passive rest or no whole-body cryotherapy—reduces DOMS, or improves subjective recovery, after exercise.

Counterintuitively, continued exercise may temporarily suppress the soreness. Exercise increases pain thresholds and pain tolerance. This effect, called exercise-induced analgesia, is known to occur in endurance training (running, cycling, swimming), but little is known about whether it also occurs in resistance training. There are claims in the literature that exercising sore muscles appears to be the best way to reduce or eliminate the soreness, but this has not yet been systematically investigated.

<doc id="805915" wikidata="Q7693476" url="?curid=805915" title="Ted Mack (radio and television host)">
<text>William Edward Maguiness (February 12, 1904 – July 12, 1976) was an American radio and television host and musician, best known for hosting &quot;Ted Mack and The Original Amateur Hour&quot;.

==Early years==
The son of a railroad brakeman, Mack was born in Greeley, Colorado. His mother was a teacher and a pianist. Mack graduated from Sacred Heart High School in Denver, Colorado, in 1922. He was class president there for three years in addition to playing football and basketball and playing in the school&#x27;s orchestra. He went on to graduate from the University of Denver, where he majored in Law and Commerce, and funded his college education by playing saxophone in an orchestra.

==Big bands==
Mack&#x27;s career in show business began in 1926 when he joined Ben Pollack&#x27;s orchestra. In the late 1920s, clarinetist and saxophonist Mack formed a dance band, under his real name. A nightclub owner disliked how &quot;Edward Maguiness&quot; looked on his marquee, so he changed the bandleader&#x27;s name to the shorter and snappier &quot;Ted Mack&quot;. At one point, Mack was known as &quot;the performer with the longest run of any master of ceremonies at the Paramount theater, New York&quot;, having been in that role for five months.

Mack and his orchestra spent the summer of 1933 entertaining at the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair, after which they had an engagement for two months in New York City. A 1934 newspaper review said, &quot;Ted Mack and his bandmen furnish comedy fare and entertaining music in equal measure, and the group of personable young women who assist display talent as well as good looks.&quot;

==Film==
Mack was musical supervisor for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where he was orchestra director for &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot; and &quot;Beat the Band&quot;.

==&quot;Original Amateur Hour&quot;==
&quot;The Original Amateur Hour&quot; began on radio in 1934 as &quot;Major Bowes&#x27; Amateur Hour&quot;, and ran until the 1946 death of its creator, Major Bowes. Mack, a talent scout who had directed the show under Bowes, revived it in 1948 for ABC Radio and the DuMont Television Network.
The show lasted on radio until 1952 and until 1970 on television, where it ran on all four major networks, ending as a Sunday afternoon CBS staple. A success in the early days of television, the program set the stage for numerous programs seeking talented stars, from &quot;The Gong Show&quot; to &quot;Star Search&quot; to &quot;American Idol&quot; to &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;.

Auditions for the show were generally held in New York&#x27;s Radio City Music Hall. Those who passed the initial screening were invited to compete on the program, featuring amateurs whose performance were judged by viewers, voting via letters and phone calls. Contestants who won three times earned cash prizes, scholarships, or participation in a traveling stage show associated with the program.

Winners who went on to show business careers included singers Gladys Knight, Ann-Margret, Pat Boone, Raul Julia, Teresa Brewer, Irene Cara, The Rock and Roll Trio, and Los Concertinos from Puerto Rico.

Ted Mack and producer Lewis Graham (the former Lou Goldberg) programmed something for everybody. A single broadcast (Easter Sunday, 1959) featured an opera singer, a trumpet sextet, a dulcimer player, a kiddie dance troupe, a young vocalist, a dancer, a rhythm-and-blues combo, a barbershop quartet, and mother-and-son Irish step dancers. Mack&#x27;s pleasant manner and unflappable calm put many nervous contestants at ease, and he used the same down-to-earth tone for commercials and public-service announcements.

==Other television==
In 1951, Mack was host of &quot;Ted Mack&#x27;s Family Hour&quot; on ABC. A TV reference book summarized the show as &quot;A Sunday evening program of music, songs and comedy.&quot; In 1955, he had a daily afternoon program, &quot;Ted Mack&#x27;s Matinee&quot; on NBC. A review of the April 20 episode in the April 30, 1955, issue of &quot;Billboard&quot; said, &quot;Unpretentious and easy-going, NBC&#x27;s new &quot;Ted Mack&#x27;s Matinee&quot; looks as if it&#x27;s going to provide housewives with a smooth, relaxing stanza to break up her [sic] daytime chores.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1926, Mack married Ellen Marguerite Overholt. They had no children but fostered children from Catholic charities at their home.

<text>Edward Carrington Mack (20 December 1933 – 6 November 2018) was an architect and Australian politician. He is the only person ever to have been elected and re-elected as an independent to local, state, and federal government in Australia, and is often referred to as the &quot;father of the independents&quot;. He chose to serve for only two terms in both the New South Wales state seat of North Shore and the federal seat of North Sydney to avoid receiving a parliamentary pension.

==Early life==
Mack was born in the Sydney suburb of Paddington and educated at Sydney Boys High School, finishing in 1950. He completed national service in the RAAF in 1951–1952 at Albury. At the University of New South Wales, he trained as an architect, graduating with a Bachelor of Architecture in 1958. Following graduation, he married Wendy, with whom he has two daughters, one of whom is consumer activist Jenni Mack, and two sons. He and his wife travelled to Europe and worked in London 1958–61. Returning to Australia he worked as an architect mainly on hospitals and public housing until 1974 and in private practice until 1980. He supervised the construction of the Port Kembla district hospital (1961–63) and was later appointed as Architect-in-charge of Hospital design and construction at the NSW Public Works Department in 1966. In 1972 he was appointed as Assistant Chief Architect at the NSW Housing Commission. In 1975, he was appointed to a committee chaired by H.C. Coombs (former Governor of both the Commonwealth and Reserve Banks) to monitor and advise on Aboriginal housing in remote areas of Australia. Between 1974 and 1980, Mack was also employed as a part-time tutor at UNSW in architecture.

==Political career==
Mack began to take an interest in politics in 1970 after the North Sydney Municipal Council approved construction of a 17-storey office block near his residence. He subsequently ran for election to the council in 1974 and was successful. He was re-elected as an Alderman in 1977 and 1980. He was elected by the council as mayor in 1980, 1981, and 1982. He was re-elected by popular vote in 1983 and 1987. He began his term as mayor by selling the mayoral Mercedes-Benz car to help buy community buses. For the next eight years he used his 1951 Citroen as the mayoral car at no cost to the ratepayers. He relinquished his private architectural practice on becoming mayor.

He introduced open government policies making all council meetings, committees and council files open to the public. There were no meetings of any sort from which the public or press were excluded while he was mayor. Public participation in decision making was created through the establishment of some 24 precinct committees, some 3000 public meetings and 36 referendums over his eight years as mayor. Under Mack&#x27;s leadership the council decided all decision making is ultimately the right of the public not aldermen – irrespective of the merits of the public decision. He initiated a policy of raising funds from sources other than rates, with the result that rates fell from 66% of council&#x27;s income in 1980 to 38% in 1987. In that year North Sydney was named as the top Sydney council in an independent financial analysis. This enabled the council to establish a large public works program without using rates or loans to fund it. The works program consisted of several new and renovated parks, four multi-storey car parks, four new childcare facilities, four renovated community centres and one major new community centre, four new tennis centres, two renovated public swimming pools, major library extensions, major renovations to North Sydney Oval, over one hundred new public housing dwellings (funded by the State Government), major streetscape improvements throughout the municipality, seats, signs, footpaths, lighting, forty bus shelters, some 50,000 street trees and a substantial number of commercial and retail establishments providing an income stream for council. Mack ensured that his name was not on any of the opening plaques for these facilities. He received a 90% vote at the 1987 mayoral election.

In 1981, he decided to run as an independent for the newly created New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of North Shore, based in North Sydney. On paper, it was a comfortably safe Liberal seat; the North Shore has been the power base for the Liberals (and their predecessors) in Sydney for over a century. Mack nominated for North Shore after noticing that on its boundaries, the newly created North Shore was virtually coextensive with the Municipality of North Sydney. Mack considered that being both mayor and state member for electorates that covered nearly identical boundaries would make both positions more effective. His opponent was state opposition leader Bruce McDonald. After the first count on election night he pushed the Labor candidate into third place, and ultimately defeated McDonald on Labor preferences—one of the few times a major-party leader has been defeated at any level in Australia. Mack did not accept a mayoral allowance for the next seven years. He was returned by comfortable margins in 1984 and 1988, the latter election coming as the Coalition won government in a landslide. Shortly after his 1988 victory, he abruptly retired from all of his offices. He did so just two days short of serving seven years in parliament, which would have made him eligible for parliamentary pension entitlements in excess of $1,000,000. Mack had always taken a dim view of what he perceived as the excesses of public political office, and decided to retire in protest. His retirement from both local and state government resulted in three by-elections for North Sydney ward alderman, North Sydney mayor and state member for North Shore. All three people he recommended for these positions were elected.

Despite living nearby, for a time, he refused to travel across the Sydney Harbour Bridge or through the Sydney Harbour Tunnel in protest at the secret contract and awarding of all tolls to Kumagai Transfield for 30 years.

==Federal politics==
After 18 months out of politics, mainly spent camping in the outback, Mack achieved even broader fame by winning the federal seat of North Sydney in 1990. The seat had long been regarded as a blue-ribbon Liberal seat; it had been held by the Liberals or their predecessors since Federation. However, Mack defeated incumbent Liberal MP and Shadow Foreign Minister John Spender on a large swing. Mack led on the primary vote, while Spender lost over 18 percent of his primary vote from 1987. He was elected on the fourth count after Democrat and Labor preferences flowed overwhelmingly to him. Mack was narrowly re-elected in 1993. During his tenure in federal Parliament, Mack opposed unilateral tariff removal, privatisations and was the only vote against Australian involvement in the Gulf War. In his speech on 22 January 1991, Mack said: &quot;This war is about oil, because 40 per cent of the world&#x27;s oil reserves are in this area. This war is about years of greed, of intrigue, of malevolence by local despots and the developed world. Saddam Hussein is a Frankenstein monster created over the last decade by the United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, China, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and other western European countries that supplied him with billions of dollars of armaments, and with the technology for chemical and nuclear warfare. France built Saddam&#x27;s nuclear reactor. In the years 1983 to 1989, United States trade with Iraq increased from $571M to $3.6 billion. Only one month before the invasion, the United States Department of Commerce tried to push through a $7.6m deal to sell Iraq nuclear parts.&quot; He successfully opposed the appointment of an Indonesian general involved in East Timor as ambassador to Australia. He also introduced a private member&#x27;s bill for citizen initiated referendums as practised in Switzerland. He served on the transport and communications committee for six years.

Mack chose to retire from federal parliament at the 1996 election for the same reason he had previously chosen to retire from state parliament − to avoid receiving a parliamentary pension. When the Liberals held their preselection contest for the seat, they did not know at the time that Mack was leaving politics, and Joe Hockey won the nomination with very little opposition. It is widely believed that Hockey would have faced a more rigorous preselection contest had it been known that Mack was retiring. During Mack&#x27;s tenure, calculations of &quot;traditional&quot; two-party margins pegged North Sydney as a fairly safe Liberal seat. In 1993, for instance, the Liberals would have held it on a margin of 9.5 percent, on the stronger side of fairly safe and just on the edge of being safe. It had been an almost foregone conclusion that it would revert to the Liberals once Mack retired. As expected, Hockey easily won the seat, and later went on to serve in various ministerial roles including Treasurer.

==Post-political life==
Mack was elected as an independent Republican delegate to the Australian Constitutional Convention. He opposed the model favoured by the Australian Republican Movement. Along with Clem Jones, he was a director of Real Republic and was appointed to the official ten person &quot;no&quot; committee for the 1999 referendum.

In 1997, Ted Mack was elected as one of the one hundred &quot;National Living Treasures&quot;, organised by the National Trust of Australia. After his retirement from federal parliament he was an occasional media political commentator, and was chosen to deliver the 2013 Henry Parkes Oration, entitled &quot;The State of the Federation&quot; at .

===2015 North Sydney by-election===
Ahead of the 2015 North Sydney by-election held on 5 December, Mack re-entered the federal political arena by announcing he would steer the campaign of independent candidate Stephen Ruff, which had the support of some disgruntled Liberal supporters. A senior orthopaedic surgeon at Royal North Shore Hospital, Ruff was a late entrant into the 2015 New South Wales state election for the North Shore state seat, and despite little financial resources and facing veteran Liberal incumbent Jillian Skinner, Ruff still managed a vote in excess of 10 percent.

Regarding the North Sydney by-election, Mack stated &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen an election where a Liberal candidate is so disliked by such a lot of Liberal members and Liberal voters&quot;. Leaked emails showed potential voters were sent registration forms at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and asked to signal their availability, with the cut-off for replying by noon the next day, and additionally, advance notice of the email and cut-off was provided to Liberal candidate Trent Zimmerman&#x27;s backers. It was claimed up to 550 Liberal branch members were unable to vote after the Liberal state executive pushed through a shortened pre-selection process to select Zimmerman, who was also head of the body that sets the rules for Liberal pre-selections, which has been claimed as a &quot;complete conflict of interest&quot;. Mack also claimed that much of the electorate was angered that the outgoing Joe Hockey, who penned the &quot;age of entitlement&quot; speech, had forced a $1-million by-election within a year of the 2016 federal election, with the expectation of becoming the next Ambassador of Australia to the United States. Ruff was ultimately unsuccessful, coming second to Zimmerman with a 19 percent primary and 40 percent two-candidate vote. It was only the second time in the seat&#x27;s history that the successful Liberal candidate did not obtain a majority of the primary vote, having to rely on preferences after a larger than predicted double-digit primary vote swing.

===Health and death===
In 2016, it was reported that Mack had commenced treatment for brain cancers following the discovery of multiple small tumours in his brain. Mack informed the media that the diagnosis was terminal. The inaugural Ted Mack Oration was hosted by North Sydney Council and delivered in March 2017 by Elizabeth Farrelly, a &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; columnist and architecture academic at the University of New South Wales. Mack died after a stroke on 6 November 2018. On the first anniversary of his death on 6 November 2019, the Mayor of North Sydney, Jilly Gibson, officially renamed the park next to North Sydney Council Chambers as &quot;Ted Mack Civic Park&quot;.

<doc id="805921" wikidata="Q1803422" url="?curid=805921" title="Erotic sexual denial">
<text>Erotic sexual denial is a popular form of sexual activity whereby sexual gratification for one or both partners is delayed or &quot;denied&quot; sexual experiences in order to increase erotic arousal and/or tension. It is commonly used as sex play within the context of a mild dominance and submission relationship, though it can also be a solo practice. When used in the context of dominance and submission, the dominant partner is often encouraged to prioritize their own sexual pleasure over that of their submissive partner. The submissive partner receives gratification from providing sexual pleasure to their partner and from the feelings of vulnerability and tension that come from having their own sexual pleasure controlled by another. The prohibited sexual experience can be narrowly or broadly defined for a specific or indeterminate length of time, depending on the practitioner. The experience withheld can be any favored or desired sexual activities, such as specific acts or positions, provided it is something the practitioner wants.

Orgasm control practices like edging are well-known varieties of erotic sexual denial in which a person is kept in a heightened state of sexual arousal for an extended length of time without orgasm. Edging often ends with a delayed orgasm, unlike the similar practice of orgasm denial which typically does not lead to orgasm. Chastity devices such as penile chastity cages, cock harnesses or chastity belts can be used as a physical barrier to restrict an individual&#x27;s ability to self-pleasure during periods of sexual denial.

Though not necessary to practice tease and denial, some practitioners find that these devices heighten feelings of submissiveness and empowerment between partners. Another frequently mentioned variety is the use of dice or other games of chance by couples to determine how long a person is to be withheld oral and/or penetrative sex, etc., from their partner. Erotic sexual denial is commonly, but not exclusively, practiced in association with BDSM and sexual bondage.

==Denial practices==
===Tie and tease===
Bondage techniques are commonly used to restrain the person being sexually denied, allowing them to experience their powerlessness more intensely. This practice is typically called &quot;tie and tease&quot; and can be thought of as extended tease and denial games. This practice is often an integral part of sexual denial. In discussions between BDSM partners, negotiation usually focuses on the activities which may or may not be agreed to. Tie and tease activities are physically as well as psychologically intense, because the strong feelings of sexual frustration are escalated by the sensation of helplessness induced by bondage.

===Tease and denial===

Tease and denial is a situation where a person is stimulated until they are close to orgasm, then stimulation is stopped, keeping the person on the brink of orgasm. It is sometimes referred to as &quot;edging&quot;. This is similar to orgasm control, but without the promise of orgasm at the end.

If orgasm still occurs after removal of stimulation, it typically brings less pleasure than usual, and is considered a &quot;ruined orgasm&quot;, as opposed to being a &quot;denied orgasm&quot; (which can sometimes lead to epididymal hypertension for both men and women). Alternatively (for men), the release of semen during the emission phase of ejaculation might be prevented by some sort of constriction (&quot;blocked orgasm&quot;). Depending on the relationship, subjects might be repeatedly teased to the point of orgasm several times, but without actual orgasm, causing feelings of intense arousal and psychological need.

=== Total denial ===

The practice of total sexual denial usually includes total avoidance of genital stimulation to the penis or vulva. This often involves the use of a physical barrier or device, such as a chastity belt or cage. Chastity belts or similar locking devices are available for all genders. Depending on the situation, sexual arousal may still be possible regardless of physical barriers to genital stimulation. This, however, depends on the belt used.

=== Male strap-on harness ===
A strap-on dildo may be worn by a male to still allow penetrative vaginal sex to the female while denying the male partner the ability to orgasm, and the male then may also wear a chastity device. This is distinct from pegging, as the strap-on in this case replaces the penis of the male. This can be seen as a form of total denial if the strap-on replaces the penis throughout the whole duration of the play, or as a form of teasing if the strap-on is only used during foreplay. In the last case, the strap-on can be used to prolong penetrative sex and thus sexually satisfy the female partner in case the male suffers from premature ejaculation.

==As a form of control==
Erotic sexual denial is sometimes used by a dominant to increase their control over a submissive. Because the submissive is kept in a state of sexual need and vulnerability, they are more likely to take a compliant stance with the dominant; failure to comply can result in additional teasing or an extended period of denial, among other punishments.

Orgasm denial practices can allow the dominant to exercise control over many aspects of the submissive&#x27;s life. As such, they are often (though not always) practiced as an extension or enhancement of a broader BDSM relationship, or as a means of establishing one. They can allow the dominant to experience enjoyable and sometimes intensely craved feelings of sexual control and erotic power, and the submissive can enjoy intense feelings of sexual objectification and submission to the dominant.

Orgasm denial can also be used to increase a submissive&#x27;s tolerance for physical stimulation, as training in holding back an orgasm, or to allow the submissive to orgasm on command; as a way to maintain a heightened state of sexual arousal in the submissive, or as a means of erotic humiliation desired by either the submissive or the dominant.

Erotic humiliation can also help enforce the dominants&#x27; position in the relationship. Orgasm denial is often accompanied by other forms of erotic humiliation such as forcing the submissive to do chores, crossdress, or consume bodily fluids. These can be used as punishments, as conditions for release, or simply at the discretion of the dominant.

<doc id="805941" wikidata="Q5490992" url="?curid=805941" title="The Deadly Assassin">
<text>The Deadly Assassin is the third serial of the 14th season of the British science fiction television programme &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was first broadcast in four weekly parts on BBC1 from 30 October to 20 November 1976. It is the first serial in which the Doctor is featured without a companion, and the only such story for the classic era.

In the serial, the renegade alien Time Lord the Master (Peter Pratt) seeks to restore his life force by disrupting a power source that would destroy the planet Gallifrey along with his archenemy the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker).

==Plot==
The Doctor has a precognitive vision about the President of the Time Lords being assassinated and goes to Gallifrey to stop it. At the Panopticon, a Gallifreyan ceremonial chamber, he notes a camera and a sniper rifle on a catwalk. The Doctor fights his way to the catwalk, but the assassin is among the delegates and shoots the President dead – the crowd assumes the Doctor is the killer. Under interrogation, he maintains that he has been framed; Castellan Spandrell believes him and orders Engin to assist him in an independent investigation. The Doctor announces that he will run for President, as liberty is guaranteed for those running for office during the course of an election.

He realises that it was the Master who had sent him the vision through the Matrix, a vast electronic neural network which can turn thoughts into virtual reality. Entering the Matrix, the Doctor confronts an assassin who reveals himself as Chancellor Goth; the Master tries to trap the Doctor; Engin gets the Doctor out of the Matrix. They arrive where the two were accessing the Matrix, and find the Master pulse-less and Goth fatally burnt and dying. Goth reveals that he found the Master, nearing the end of his final regeneration, and went along with him for power. Dying, Goth warns that the Master has a doomsday plan.

The Doctor finds that the President has access to the symbols of office: the Sash and Great Key of Rassilon. As records describe how Rassilon found the Eye of Harmony within the &quot;black void,&quot; the Doctor realises that the Eye is actually a black hole&#x27;s nucleus, an inexhaustible energy source, and the Sash and Key are its control devices; the Master&#x27;s plan is to steal this energy to gain a new cycle of regenerations; however, if the Eye is disrupted, Gallifrey will be destroyed.

He also realises that the Master injected himself with a neural inhibitor that mimics a deathlike state. The Doctor, Spandrell, and Engin arrive at the morgue, where the Master seizes the Sash from the President&#x27;s corpse and traps the three. Inside the Panopticon, the Master makes his way to the Eye and unhooks the coils; the Doctor arrives via a service shaft. Quakes and cracks appear in the floor. The two fight, until the Master loses his footing and falls into a chasm. The Doctor reconnects the coils, saving Gallifrey.

The Doctor bids farewell but warns that the Master may not be dead, as he had already harvested some energy. As the Doctor&#x27;s TARDIS dematerialises, the Master sneaks into his own TARDIS and escapes.

==Production==
Following Elisabeth Sladen&#x27;s departure, Tom Baker told producer Philip Hinchcliffe that he wanted to do a story without a companion. Robert Holmes said that it was difficult to write the script for &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot; without anyone for the Doctor to share his thoughts and plans with, which was the usual role of the companion. Working titles for this story included &quot;The Dangerous Assassin&quot; (which Holmes changed to &quot;deadly&quot; because he thought it &quot;didn&#x27;t sound right&quot;). The final title is a tautology: a successful assassin must, by definition, be deadly. However, since Time Lords can in general survive death, and the assassin&#x27;s victims do not, he is perhaps &quot;deadly&quot; in that sense. According to the text commentary on the DVD, Holmes argued that the title was not a tautology, stating that there were plenty of incompetent assassins.

===Cast notes===
Bernard Horsfall guest stars as Chancellor Goth. He had previously appeared as an unnamed Time Lord (credited as &#x27;Time Lord 1&#x27;) in the serial &quot;The War Games&quot; (1969); extended media have since stated they are the same character. Other parts played by Horsfall in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; were Gulliver in &quot;The Mind Robber&quot; (1968) and Taron in &quot;Planet of the Daleks&quot; (1973), all of which were directed by David Maloney. Angus MacKay later played the Headmaster in &quot;Mawdryn Undead&quot; (1983). George Pravda previously played Denes in &quot;The Enemy of the World&quot; (1967–68) and Jaeger in &quot;The Mutants&quot; (1972). Hugh Walters previously played William Shakespeare in &quot;The Chase&quot; (1965) and later appeared as Vogel in &quot;Revelation of the Daleks&quot; (1985).

Peter Pratt, who plays the Master, was previously a leading man with the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company and a radio actor.

==Broadcast and reception==
The cliffhanger to Part Three—where Goth holds the Doctor&#x27;s head underwater in an attempt to drown him—came in for heavy criticism, particularly from the &#x27;clean-up TV&#x27; campaigner Mary Whitehouse. She often cited it in interviews as one of the most frightening scenes in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, her reasoning being that children would not know if the Doctor survived until the following week and that they would &quot;have this strong image in their minds&quot; during all that time. After the episode&#x27;s initial broadcast, the BBC apologised to Whitehouse and the master tape was edited to remove the original ending. The edited episode was included when the story was repeated on BBC1 from 4 to 25 August 1977 seen by 4.4, 2.6, 3.8 &amp; 3.5 million viewers.

Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping wrote of the serial in &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot; (1995), &quot;The reputation of &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot; rests with its violence and its revelations about the Doctor&#x27;s people and their culture. Politically literate and cynical (&#x27;We must adjust the truth&#x27;), the serial is the definitive text on the Time Lords. The Doctor&#x27;s journey into the APC net ... is a visual and intellectual tour de force of hallucinatory images.&quot; In &quot;The Television Companion&quot; (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker reported that at the time of broadcast several viewers took issue with the serial&#x27;s portrayal of the Time Lords, finding it a contradiction of the small details that had previously been dropped about the Doctor&#x27;s home planet, but over time its reputation became more positive. The pair themselves called it &quot;a truly remarkable story&quot; and praised the reintroduction of the Master. In 2010, Patrick Mulkern of &quot;Radio Times&quot; awarded the serial four stars out of five. He described &quot;the Master&#x27;s putrid skull and split bangers for fingers&quot; as &quot;the most revolting images presented on teatime TV&quot; but was positive towards its supporting characters, though he did criticise the Matrix sequences for being more earthly rather than alien, despite them being constructed from deceased Time Lords. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; reviewer Christopher Bahn praised the plotting and Matrix sequences, calling it &quot;well-crafted all around&quot;. 

In 2010, Charlie Jane Anders of io9 listed the cliffhanger to the first episode—in which it appears the Doctor shoots the president—as one of the greatest cliffhangers in the history of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Den of Geek named the cliffhanger to the third episode as one of the ten best &quot;Doctor Who&quot; cliffhangers, praising the freeze frame. In 2013, &quot;Starburst&quot; also chose Part Three as one of the &quot;Top Ten &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Cliffhangers&quot;. In 2018, Digital Spy described Part Three as &quot;the show&#x27;s most controversial cliffhanger&quot;.

===Analysis===

Tat Wood suggests it is &quot;blindingly obvious&quot; that the story was largely inspired by the film and book &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;.

<text>Johannes Sturm (also known as Jean Sturm; Latinized as Ioannes Sturmius; 1 October 1507 – 3 March 1589), was a German educator and Protestant reformer, who was influential in the design of the gymnasium system of secondary education.

== Biography ==
Sturm was born in Schleiden. In 1521 or 1522 he started studies at the school of St. Jerome, Liège, and went on to the University of Leuven. There he had a share in a printing press and issued several Greek works. In 1529 he moved to Paris, where in addition to selling books he was asked to teach and gave lectures on Cicero and Demosthenes. Influenced by the writings of Martin Bucer he adopted the principles of the Protestant Reformation. He participated in the attempt to reconcile Protestant and Roman Catholic parties in 1534.

At the urging of Bucer and the unrelated statesman Jacob Sturm von Sturmeck, Sturm accepted a call to teach in Strassburg in 1537, and in 1538 he set up the Protestant gymnasium, the Schola Argentoratensis (now called Jean Sturm Gymnasium), there, which provided the model for the modern German gymnasium. He directed the school for 43 years, and the school attained a wide celebrity, becoming an influential model for humanistic gymnasia especially in Germany.

He undertook diplomatic missions on behalf of Strassburg, the Protestant estates and the king of France. He attended the conferences at Hagenau and Worms in 1540, and at Regensburg in 1541; and went with Bucer to meet the elector of Cologne, in 1542. After helping to negotiate peace between England and France in 1545, he again went to France in 1546, at the outbreak of the War of the Schmalkaldic League, to seek the help of François I. He asked for German aid to the Huguenots, which made him suspect in the eyes of Lutherans.

Sturm was often asked to advise on the creation or reform of schools, among others the gymnasium at Lauingen (1564). His influence is seen in the school regulations of Württemberg (1559), Brunswick (1569), and Saxony (1580).

After the death of Jacob Sturm and with the stricter enforcement of the Lutheran confession in Strassburg after 1555, Sturm became involved in ongoing controversies. He upheld the broader views of Bucer, and was influenced by his Biblical and Renaissance humanistic views towards a non-dogmatic Christianity. A dispute over the orthodoxy of Girolamo Zanchi (whom Sturm defended against Johann Marbach and other Lutheran critics) was resolved in 1563, but the theological complaints against Sturm&#x27;s views, and those of his staff, persisted; in 1570 Sturm offered to resign, but the city council declined to accept. Sturm&#x27;s ongoing conflict with Marbach was adjudicated in Sturm&#x27;s favor in 1575. But the 1577 Lutheran Formula of Concord reopened the conflict; the theologian Johannes Pappus agitated for its official imposition in Strassburg, supported in the ensuing pamphlet war by the Swabians Andreas Osiander and Jakob Andrea; Sturm opposed them vigorously and vituperatively. Sturm was relieved of his position in 1581 and retired to Northeim. He died in Strassburg in 1589.

== Legacy ==
Sturm was generally regarded as the greatest educator connected with the Reformed Church. The school he directed and his art of teaching were a humanist model for a century all over Europe. His ideal in education was &quot;to direct the aspiration of the scholars toward God, to develop their intelligence, and to render them useful citizens by teaching them the skill to communicate their thoughts and sentiments with persuasive effect.&quot; Sturm&#x27;s emphasis on eloquence and rhetoric is reflected in the readings prescribed for students: Cicero, Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Eclogues&quot;, selections of Latin poetry, and Terence form the Latin syllabus, and in Greek the focus is on Demosthenes and other rhetoricians. The Greek and Latin historians, philosophers and natural scientists appear on the reading lists only occasionally.

Sturm implemented a gradation of the course of study, and novel methods of instruction. His system of classes (practically the same that still prevailed in all gymnasia some centuries later), his classification of literary material for use in schools, his writing of textbooks, and his organization of school management shaped the practice of secondary education, not only in the German schools, but also in secondary schools of England and France. His collection of Cicero&#x27;s letters is recommended by Roger Ascham in his &quot;The Scholemaster&quot;.

In addition to the Jean Sturm Gymnasium, Foyer Jean-Sturm, a modern student dormitory in Strasbourg, also bears his name.

<text>Jan Josef Štursa (15 May 1880 – 2 May 1925) was a Czech sculptor, one of founders of modern Czech sculpture.

== Birth and studies ==
Štursa was born on 15 May 1880 in Nové Město na Moravě. He studied masonry and sculpture in Hořice and worked as stone cutter. Later, he studied at the Academy of Arts (AVU) in Prague under professor Josef Myslbek, a known sculptor. As a result of very rigorous criticism from Myslbek, Štursa destroyed most of his early works.

== Themes and materials ==
Štursa was not influenced by Czech National Revival as the older sculptors but tried to find his own way. The female body was his frequent motif, for example in &quot;Before taking bath&quot;, 1906 or &quot;The Melancholy Girl&quot;, 1906. A monumental couple of figures decorates the pylons of Hlávka Bridge in Prague. In addition to stone and bronze he also used plaster and wax. Later, he was influenced by Cubism. Portrait painting was an important part of his works.

== World War I ==

The tragedy of World War I (he had served at the front) affected Štursa&#x27;s work. The most famous work of this period is &quot;The Wounded&quot;: early version, final version (1921), more details.

The inspiration for the &quot;Burial in the Carpathians&quot; sculpture was a photograph from a Carpathian battlefield. The original group in Austrian uniforms was remade in the 1920s into a memorial of victims of World War I and placed in the village Předměřice nad Jizerou, with copies in Místek and in Nové Město na Moravě.

In 1922–1924, Štursa served as Rector of the Academy of Arts (AVU). Štursa suffered from the effects of syphilis and on 2 May 1925, faced with increasing pain, he killed himself in his atelier in Prague at age 44.

Štursa&#x27;s nephew Jiří Štursa was the architect of Stalin&#x27;s Monument (Prague).

<doc id="805953" wikidata="Q6055890" url="?curid=805953" title="Funding">
<text>Funding is the act of providing resources to finance a need, program, or project. While this is usually in the form of money, it can also take the form of effort or time from an organization or company. Generally, this word is used when a firm uses its internal reserves to satisfy its necessity for cash, while the term financing is used when the firm acquires capital from external sources.

Sources of funding include credit, venture capital, donations, grants, savings, subsidies, and taxes. Funding methods such as donations, subsidies, and grants that have no direct requirement for return of investment are described as &quot;soft funding&quot; or &quot;crowdfunding&quot;. Funding that facilitates the exchange of equity ownership in a company for capital investment via an online funding portal per the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (alternately, the &quot;JOBS Act of 2012&quot;) (U.S.) is known as equity crowdfunding.

Funds can be allocated for either short-term or long-term purposes.

==Economics==
In economics funds are injected into the market as capital by lenders and taken as loans by borrowers. There are two ways in which the capital can end up at the borrower. The lender can lend the capital to a financial intermediary against interest. These financial intermediaries then reinvest the money against a higher rate. The use of financial intermediaries to finance operations is called indirect finance. A lender can also go to the financial markets to directly lend to a borrower. This method is called direct finance.

==Purpose of Funding==

===Research funding===
Research funding is funding used for research-related purposes. It is most often used to describe funding in the fields of technology or social science. The allocation of funds are usually granted based on a per project, department, or institute basis stemming from scope of the research or project. Research funding can be split into commercial and non-commercial allocations. Research and development departments of a corporation normally provide commercial research funding. Whereas, non-commercial research funding is obtained from charities, research councils, or government agencies. Organizations that require such funding normally have to go through competitive selections. Only those that have the most potential would be chosen. Funding is vital in ensuring the sustainability of certain projects.

===Launch a business===
Entrepreneurs with a business concept would want to accumulate all the necessary resources including capital to venture into a market. Funding is part of the process, as some businesses would require large start-up sums that individuals would not have. These start-up funds are essential to kick-start a business idea, without it, entrepreneurs would not have the ability to carry out their concepts in the business world.

===Uses on investment===
Fund management companies gather pools of money from many investors and use them to purchase securities. These funds are managed by professional investment managers, which may generate higher returns with reduced risks by asset diversification. The size of these funds could be as little as a few millions or as much as multi billions. The purpose of these funding activities is mainly aiming to pursue individual or organization profits.

== Types of Funding ==

=== Personal Funding ===
Personal funding involves using personal finances to fund an initiative. This could include savings, personal loans, or funds from friends and family. It is common in the early stages of a business or project when other sources of funding may not be accessible.

=== Corporate Funding ===
Corporate funding involves funds provided by corporations, often in the form of investments or loans. Corporations might provide funding for other businesses, especially in industries where there is a strategic benefit.

=== Government Funding ===
Government funding is provided by local, state, or federal governments to support specific projects or activities. This type of funding can come in the form of grants, subsidies, or loans. Government funding is often aimed at promoting public policies or supporting economic growth and development.

=== Angel Investors ===
Angel investors are affluent individuals who provide capital for a business start-up and small business, usually in exchange for convertible debt or ownership equity. They are often among an entrepreneur&#x27;s family and friends. The funds they provide can be a one-time investment to help the business get off the ground or an ongoing injection to support and carry the company through its difficult early stages.

=== Venture Capital ===
Venture capital is a type of private equity and a form of financing that is provided by firms or funds to small, early-stage, emerging firms that are deemed to have high growth potential or which have demonstrated high growth. Venture capital investments are generally made in exchange for equity in the company.

=== Grants ===
Grants are funds provided by one party, often a government department, corporation, foundation, or trust, to a recipient, typically a nonprofit entity, educational institution, business, or individual. Unlike loans, grants do not need to be repaid.

=== Loans ===
Loans are borrowed sums of money that are expected to be paid back with interest. They can be provided by banks, credit unions, or other financial institutions. Loans are a common form of funding for businesses, individuals, and governments.

=== Equity Financing ===
Equity financing involves raising capital through the sale of shares in an enterprise. Equity financing is essentially the sale of an ownership interest to raise funds for business purposes. This type of financing is typically used by startups and growing businesses to raise capital.

=== Debt Financing ===
Debt financing involves borrowing money to be repaid, plus interest, at a later date. Common types of debt financing include traditional bank loans, personal loans, bonds, and lines of credit. This form of financing is advantageous because it does not require giving up ownership of the business.

===Guarantees===
One form of guarantee creates a conditional liability to make a payment, whereby the guarantor will pay the principal debt holder fails to do so. Effectively when the liability to make a payment is trigged the guarantor becomes a funder.

==Methods of Funding==

===Government Grants===

Government could allocate funds itself or through government agencies to projects that benefit the public through a selection process to students or researchers and even organizations. At least two external peer-reviewers and an internal research award committee review each application. The research awards committee would meet some time to discuss shortlisted applications. A further shortlist and ranking is made. Projects are funded and applicants are informed. Econometric evidence shows public grants for firms can create additionality in jobs, sales, value added, innovation and capital. For example, this was shown to be the case for large R&amp;D grants, as well as smaller public grants for the tourism firms or small and medium sized firms in general.

Government grants are offered by various levels of government to support projects that benefit the public. Supported projects may include funding for scientific research, infrastructure development, public health initiatives, and education programs. Examples include the Pell Grant in the United States, which helps low-income students pay for college, and the Horizon Europe program, which funds research and innovation projects across Europe. 

For businesses, government grants are financial contributions provided by governmental organizations to help businesses achieve specific goals, such as innovation, expansion, job creation, and export development. For example, in Canada, the CanExport program helps businesses expand into international markets by covering expenses related to travel, marketing, and trade shows. Unlike interest-free loans, grants do not need to be repaid, making them an attractive funding option for businesses looking to reduce financial risk.

===Crowdfunding===

Crowdfunding exists in mainly two types, reward-based crowdfunding and equity-based crowdfunding. In the former, small firms could pre-sell a product or service to start a business whereas in the latter, backers buy a certain amount of shares of a firm in exchange of money. As for reward-based crowdfunding, project creators would set a funding target and deadline. Anyone who is interested can pledge on the projects. Projects must reach its targeted amount in order for it to be carried out. Once the projects ended with enough funds, projects creators would have to make sure that they fulfill their promises by the intended timeline and delivery their products or services.

===Raise from investors===
To raise capital, you require funds from investors who are interested in the investments. You have to present those investors with high-return projects. By displaying high-level potentials of the projects, investors would be more attracted to put their money into those projects. After a certain amount of time, usually in a year&#x27;s time, rewards of the investment will be shared with investors. This makes investors happy and they may continue to invest further. If returns do not meet the intended level, this could reduce the willingness of investors to invest their money into the funds. Hence, the amounts of financial incentives are highly weighted determinants to ensure the funding remains at a desirable level. Venture Capital (VC) is a subdivision of Private Equity wherein external investors fund small-scale startups that have high growth potential in the long run. Investors receive a portion of the company’s equity in return for the money invested by them. The amount of money that a Venture capital firm can raise is predominantly built on the Principal-agent relationship between the Limited Partners and the Venture Capital Firm.

===Self-Organized Funding Allocation===

Self-organized funding allocation (SOFA) is a method of distributing funding for scientific research. In this system, each researcher is allocated an equal amount of funding, and is required to anonymously allocate a fraction of their funds to the research of others. Proponents of SOFA argue that it would result in similar distribution of funding as the present grant system, but with less overhead. In 2016, a test pilot of SOFA began in the Netherlands.

== Securing loans ==
A company or an individual may secure a loan to get access to capital. Often borrowers must use a secured loan where assets are pledged as collateral. If the borrower defaults, ownership of the collateral reverts to the lender. Both tangible and intangible assets can be used to secure loans. The use of IP as collateral in IP-backed finance transactions is the subject of a report series at the World Intellectual Property Organization.

== Withdrawal of funding ==

Withdrawal of funding, or defunding, occurs when funding previously given to an organisation ceases, especially in relation to Governmental funding.
Defunding could be as a result of a disagreement or failure to meet set s. An example that explains the withdrawal of funding in this case is that of President Trump&#x27;s decision to stop funding the World Health Organization (WHO) over alleged Coronavirus mismanagement.

<doc id="805964" wikidata="Q757302" url="?curid=805964" title="Trunks (Dragon Ball)">
<text>is a fictional character in the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; manga series created by Akira Toriyama. Within the series, he is the half-Saiyan half-human son of Vegeta and Bulma and has at least two noteworthy incarnations. Trunks makes his debut appearance in chapter #331 &quot;The Young Boy of Mystery&quot;, first published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; magazine on July 2, 1991, as an unidentified young man who traveled back in time to warn Son Goku and his allies of a deadly new enemy, the Androids of the Red Ribbon Army. This alternate future timeline incarnation of Trunks, who is usually referred to as in media to distinguish him from his present-timeline counterpart, is one of the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; series&#x27; most popular characters and has been praised for his unique role within the series.

The present-timeline incarnation of Trunks is introduced as an infant during the story arc, which features the first appearance of the Red Ribbon Androids. This version of Trunks makes recurring appearances as a major character in the &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; and various other media such as &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot; and films produced by Toei Animation.

==Voice actors==
In the original Japanese version of the entire &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; anime series and in all other media, Trunks is voiced by Takeshi Kusao with the only exception being in Dragon Ball Daima, where a mini Trunks was voiced by Tsubasa Yonaga. Akira Toriyama stated that it was difficult to decide on Present Trunks&#x27; voice. The producer at Toei Animation and the editorial department discussed that, perhaps, it would be better if they changed to a different voice actor for the child version. At that time, the serialization was still going on, and Toriyama did not know how the manga story would end; young Trunks might have ended up growing up and the story might have continued to the same time period when teenage Trunks returned to the future. In that case, if the voice actor would have been changed, it would have sounded strange. Eventually, Kusao ended up also voicing Trunks as a child and, after listening a few times, Toriyama felt that it was the right choice. However, the cries given by the character&#x27;s infant form were provided by Hiromi Tsuru in an uncredited role.

In the English-language dub by Funimation, Eric Vale voices Trunks as both a teen and an adult in all &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; media, while Laura Bailey voices him as a child in the series, as well as the movie, &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods&quot;, as well as the other non-canon movies. Alexis Tipton voices him as a child starting from &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;.

==Abilities==
Trunks possesses several Saiyan abilities including superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, and energy blasts, which can be utilized by the use of &quot;ki&quot;. Both incarnations of Trunks have access to the Super Saiyan transformation, although their achievement of this form differs between incarnation. Future Trunks achieved this in his early teens, while present Trunks would be shown to have the ability at the age of eight.

Some of Future Trunks&#x27; signature attacks are the and the . Trunks is also known for his use of a longsword that he keeps in a scabbard mounted across his back. His main means of conveyance is a technique called which gives him the ability of flight. However, Trunks does not rely on this technique as his only conveyance as he can also be seen piloting various crafts manufactured by his family&#x27;s company, including the time machine which allowed him to visit Goku in the past. Unlike his present time counterpart, Future Trunks obtains two additional grades of Super Saiyan during his training with Vegeta in the Room of Spirit and Time. Unfortunately, these forms would greatly increase his &quot;ki&quot; consumption and greatly decrease his speed at the cost of additional strength, resulting in Future Trunks abandoning these grades after his initial fight with Cell. Upon his return to the past, Trunks is able to attain Super Saiyan 2 and can now also use his father&#x27;s signature techniques, such as the &quot;Galick Gun&quot; and &quot;Final Flash&quot;. Later, when Black and Zamasu blame him for his constant time traveling, it fueles Trunks&#x27; rage and lets him transform into a new, previously unknown form named and gives him enough power to fight both Black and Zamasu.

The present incarnation of Trunks is able to temporarily fuse with Goten to become the powerful being named through a technique called &quot;Fusion&quot;, which was taught to them by Goku. Gotenks is able to use a variety of attacks that he gives humorous names to, such as and his signature . They can also achieve Super Saiyan 3 with ease, a feat that was very difficult for Goku to achieve and maintain.

==Appearances==
===Future Trunks===
Trunks first appears in chapter #331 , published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; magazine on July 15, 1991. Here he is a mysterious seventeen year old capable of transforming into the Super Saiyan state, who appears and singlehandedly kills Frieza and his father, King Cold. Upon Goku&#x27;s return from Planet Yardrat, Trunks confides in Goku his tragic story.

As told in the stand-alone manga side story and chapters #419 and 420, Trunks has traveled from twenty years in the future where the world is in constant ruin due to the terror of the two androids #17 and #18 which were created by Doctor Gero, the former chief scientist of the Red Ribbon Army. By this time, Goku has succumbed to an unknown heart virus and everyone, with the exception of Goku&#x27;s son Gohan, has fallen at the hands of the artificial humans. Trunks has been living with Bulma and secretly training with his master Gohan. After an unsuccessful ambush, Gohan is murdered by the Androids. When Trunks finds the body, he becomes engulfed in rage and sadness, awakening his Super Saiyan transformation. After Gohan&#x27;s death, Trunks assumes the mantle of Earth&#x27;s sole protector against the artificial humans for the next three years until Bulma finishes her time machine. Once he informs Goku of the events to come, Trunks gives Goku a special medicine and returns to his own time.

Trunks returns to help in the present day battle against the artificial humans, only to learn that his actions only affected the present timeline with a new future while his own timeline remains unaffected. With the appearance of Cell from another alternate timeline, Trunks trains with Vegeta in the &quot;Room of Spirit and Time&quot;. After Vegeta&#x27;s defeat, Trunks fights Cell in his newly gained Perfect form before conceding once learning his new Super Saiyan form proves to be ineffective. He later participates in Cell&#x27;s martial arts tournament, where he is killed by Cell. After Trunks is revived by the Dragon Balls following Cell&#x27;s defeat, he returns to his own timeline to defeat both the Androids and later the Cell of his time. A few years later, Trunks is accosted by the Supreme Kai of Universe 7, whom he helps in defeating Babidi and Dabura in order to prevent the revival of Majin Buu.

Years later, having reached Super Saiyan 2 during his fight against Badidi and Dabura, Trunks encounters a new dark enemy known as Goku Black, who slaughters the Earth&#x27;s residents as the Saiyan survivor helps the survivors defend themselves, before attempting to recruit Goku and Vegeta from the present timeline. During Goku and Goku Black&#x27;s fight, Trunks&#x27; time machine is destroyed, leaving him stuck in the present era, until Bulma rebuild a new one. After a reunion with a now adult Gohan, Trunks becomes encouraged to defeat Goku Black in order for the people of his own timeline to have a chance at that same happiness, also having a reunion with a reformed Android #18. Trunks then receives training from Vegeta, vowing to surpass both his father and Goku Black in strength. After Beerus erased Zamasu in the present timeline, Trunks would later learn that Goku Black is a rogue Supreme Kai named Zamasu from an unaltered present timeline who acquired Goku&#x27;s body and allied himself with the future timeline&#x27;s Zamasu. During the battle, both versions of Zamasu provoke Trunks into his Super Saiyan Rage form by telling him that his meddling in time is the cause of their actions. After numerous fights, including Goku Black and Zamasu fusing with the Potara earrings, Trunks gathers the energy from all remaining life on the planet into his sword into the Spirit Bomb Sword and cuts Fusion Zamasu in half. Despite losing his body, Zamasu&#x27;s essence began to envelop the entire universe, before being destroyed alongside the entire multiverse by that timeline&#x27;s version of Zeno. Trunks and the others retreat to the past. Goku later invited Trunks to get Future Zeno. The two go back, with Trunks and Mai bidding their farewells as they live for a new future timeline where Zamasu&#x27;s actions never occurred that is home to another Mai and another Trunks.

===Present Trunks=== 
Trunks&#x27; second incarnation first appears as an infant in chapter #337 , published on August 26, 1991. He is only featured as a background character. When he is eight, Trunks participates in the 25th and defeats Son Goten in the junior division, although the two of them cheated equally. Goten is his best friend and childhood rival, though Trunks is stronger and older than Goten as it is later pointed out by Goku. Eager to compete in the adult division, Trunks and Goten together impersonate another competitor, and are pitted against Android #18 and others in the Tenkaichi Budokai. But they are disqualified when #18 figures out the ruse and blows their cover, revealing that they are really two people.

Upon the arrival of Majin Buu, Trunks is forced to train with Goten in the &quot;Room of Spirit and Time&quot; to become the fused warrior Gotenks. Gotenks fights Buu, first in the time dimension, then in the real world until the thirty-minute fusion time limit expires. Through Buu&#x27;s treachery they, along with Piccolo, are absorbed by Buu, thus increasing his power. Once freed, Trunks, along with Goten, Gohan, and Piccolo are killed when Buu blows up the Earth. After being resurrected, Trunks helped to rally the people on Earth to support Goku&#x27;s &quot;Genki-Dama&quot; in his defeat of Majin Buu. At the end of the series, Trunks, now grown up, participates in the 28th Tenkaichi Budokai against the fighter Otokosuki.

Trunks appears in &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;, which chronologically takes place before the ending of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, as a recurring support character. He is usually paired with Goten and often used as comic relief. He then meets his future counterpart in person for the first time during the Goku Black arc, having beforehand interacted with him as an infant. In the Universe Survival arc, Trunks and Goten are stopped from taking part in the Tournament of Power, and instead instructed to look after Android 17&#x27;s haven for animals so that he can aid Goku in the tournament.

He, alongside Goten, both grown up, appear in &quot;Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero&quot;, assisting Gohan, Piccolo, and their friends in combating the revived Red Ribbon Army. Gotenks also appears, albeit is in the obese state due to the duo doing the fusion technique wrong.

===Appearances in other media===
In &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot;, Trunks&#x27; second incarnation has become the President of Capsule Corporation, but does not take the job seriously. He accompanies Goku and Pan into space to recover the Black Star Dragon Balls. They have many strange encounters and meet many unusual characters including the robot named Giru, who would act as the gang&#x27;s Dragon Radar. Upon arriving on Giru&#x27;s home world, the trio are hijacked by Dr. Myu&#x27;s robots and Trunks is solidified in living metal for study. Although, the contents of the plate was not really Trunks, but a cleverly made decoy by both Trunks and Giru. Trunks uses the opportunity to uncover Dr. Myu&#x27;s plan, which is to awaken Baby, and sabotage the process. Trunks&#x27; plan fails as Baby had managed to escape to Earth. When they return home, Baby has managed to possess Vegeta and brainwash everyone else into becoming his followers. Shortly after arriving, Trunks also falls victim to Baby&#x27;s mind control and battles Goku. Later, he along with Goten travel the globe fighting the villains that escape from Hell.

Trunks also appears in the promotional anime for Super Dragon Ball Heroes, as Xeno Trunks. Xeno Trunks is able to use the Super Saiyan God transformation using God Ki.

Both incarnations of Trunks have appeared in most &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; related video games. He has also appeared in other related games such as &quot;Jump Super Stars&quot;, its sequel &quot;Jump Ultimate Stars&quot;, and &quot;Battle Stadium D.O.N&quot;. The game &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Shin Budokai – Another Road&quot; centers around Trunks&#x27; battle with Majin Boo in his future timeline. In 1992, Trunks would act as escort through time in the interactive Videkko game &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Get Together! Goku World&quot;. Future Trunks is also featured in the MMORPG &quot;Dragon Ball Online&quot;, where he is referred to as . This version of Trunks plays a major role in the plot of &quot;Dragon Ball: Xenoverse&quot;, helping the player to correct changes in the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; timeline caused by the manipulations of Towa and Mira and fights the player in the game&#x27;s climax alongside the game&#x27;s main antagonist Demigra after becoming possessed by him. After the duo are defeated and Trunks is returned to normal, he intervenes when Demigra tries to take control of the player.

In the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and &quot;One Piece&quot; crossover manga &quot;Cross Epoch&quot;, Trunks is a member of Captain Vegeta&#x27;s air pirate crew. Trunks also made an appearance in the 2004 Fuji TV interactive feature &quot;Kyūtai Panic Adventure Returns!&quot;, where he and six other Dragon Ball characters delivered the Dragon Balls to restore the aqua city of Odaiba.

In music, the song &quot;Chīsa na Senshi~Goten to Trunks no Theme~&quot; by Shin Oya focuses on both Trunks and Goten.

Trunks has been featured in his own brand of soft drink called Trunks Cola.

==Reception==
Trunks, especially the future incarnation, has been very positively received. While reviewing the TV special &quot;The History of Trunks&quot;, which was adapted from the stand-alone manga &quot;Trunks the Story: The Lone Warrior&quot;, Bobby Cooper of DVD Talk praised Trunks&#x27; background story, saying that it was a &quot;good origin story that explains Trunks&#x27; motivation for becoming a fighter.&quot; Similarly, Chris Shepard of Anime News Network also enjoyed the background story and felt that Trunks was an understandable character who &quot;I was really able to get into and sympathize for during his battles.&quot; In an IGN article on &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot;, Trunks&#x27; character design in GT was criticized as being &quot;goofy&quot;. Trunks&#x27; final fight against the villain Zamasu from &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; earned praise by Sam Leach from Anime News Network. However he also called it &quot;cheesy&quot; based on the way Trunks receives energy from all his allies in order to face his enemy. Shawn Saris from IGN shared similar comments, praising how he accidentally absorbs humanity&#x27;s powers into his sword to defeat Zamasu while at the same time embracing his humanity.

Trunks is a popular character in the series; his future incarnation placed third in both the 1993 and 1995 &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; character popularity polls voted on by &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; readers. In 2004, fans of the series voted him the fourth most popular character for a poll in the book &quot;Dragon Ball Forever&quot;. Trunks has appeared in various Anime Grand Prix polls, appearing fifth in the category &quot;best male character&quot; in the 1992 poll and fifth again in the 1993 poll and nineteenth in the 1994 poll. Jian DeLeon of &quot;Complex&quot; magazine named him thirteenth on a list of the 25 Most Stylish Anime Characters.

Trunks&#x27; Japanese voice actor, Takeshi Kusao, has cited Trunks as his favorite &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; character. He further stated in an interview that he was elated when he was cast to voice him. Kusao noted that Trunks&#x27; first appearance had an incredible impact and left a great impression on him, referring to his fight with Frieza in which he easily defeated the strongest being in the universe. Similarly, Funimation voice actor Christopher Sabat stated that apart from Vegeta, Trunks is his favorite character from the series. He liked how his character is the &quot;lone survivor of the apocalypse, son of the most angry and the most headstrong characters.&quot; He additionally liked Trunks&#x27; fights such as the one in which he easily killed Frieza.

In an interview, actor Masi Oka compared his &quot;Heroes&quot; character Hiro Nakamura to Trunks, as both are time travellers who carry swords. Manga creator Tite Kubo stated that to this day no fight scene has shocked him more than Trunks&#x27; first appearance.

<doc id="805975" wikidata="Q3045986" url="?curid=805975" title="Marco Fidel Suárez">
<text>Marco Fidel Suárez (April 23, 1855 – April 3, 1927) was a Colombian political figure. He served as president of Colombia from 1918 to 1921. He was born on April 23, 1855, in the town of Hatoviejo, Antioquia. His parents were Rosalía Suárez and José María Barrientos.

==Early life==

Suárez came from a very poor background, born in a two-room hut in Hatoviejo, today the town of Bello, Antioquia, adjacent to Medellín in the highland department of Antioquia. An illegitimate child at a time when official records always distinguished between &quot;natural children&quot; and &quot;legitimate children&quot; (and the former status was a disadvantage for life), his mother was a laundress; his wealthy father refused to recognize him or provide for him in any way. Since his mother was unable to pay for him to attend the local elementary public school, he stood at a window of the school in an effort to observe the lessons. After a time he began to yell out answers to the teacher&#x27;s questions when the other pupils couldn&#x27;t answer. Eventually, the teacher, suitably impressed, invited him to attend class without having to pay. Later on he joined a Catholic seminary but did not attain the priesthood as the seminary was closed.

Suárez studied his primary education in the public school of Hatoviejo. Later he studied in the seminary of the town of La Ceja, Antioquia. He then transferred to the Seminario Mayor de Medellín, where he studied philosophy, literature and theology for the priesthood. He stopped short of being ordained.

In the 1870s he participated in the civil conflict that took place in Antioquia, fighting on the side of Colonel Braulio Jaramillo, attaining a battlefield promotion to Lieutenant.

== Philosopher, poet and writer ==

Suárez became a very well known and distinguished philologist, philosopher, poet, writer and teacher. Marco Fidel, along with Rufino José Cuervo and Miguel Antonio Caro, is considered one of the most important and influential scholars of the Spanish grammar in Colombia. His best literary work was “los Sueños de Luciano Pulgar” (1926).

== Presidency ==

As president, Suárez implemented the &quot;North Star&quot; policy which linked the foreign policy of Colombia with that of the United States of America.

He was harassed by conservative opponents, mainly Laureano Gómez, who politicized his illegitimate birth, and attempted to depict him as corrupt politician. In his defense, the Secretary of State Antonio Gómez Restrepo proclaimed: “You will always be the legitimate President of Colombia”.

At his initiative, the income tax legislation was enacted into law in 1918. Later, in 1919, the nation was interconnected by an advance system of wireless telegraphy.

Suárez was very fond of aviation. In 1919 he sanctioned Law 126 by which commercial aviation was established and authorized, allowing for international travel and the operation of the postal service. A year later he brought to the country a French mission to establish and train the Colombian Air Force.

== Personal life ==

Suárez married Isabel Orrantia y Borda in August 1895. They had two children. His wife died six years later and his son died in New York in 1918. His mother Rosalía Suárez died in March 1918. Thus, the day of his inauguration as the 35th President of Colombia, on August 7, 1918, he had a profound pain and sorrow for the death of his beloved mother, wife and son. His son died while studying in Pittsburgh, and he was forbidden from repatriating the body using State funds.

== El Hijo de la Choza ==

The movie director and producer Enock Roldan, in 1959, produced a movie film about the life of Marco Fidel Suárez. The movie, called &quot;El Hijo de la Choza&quot; (&quot;The Son of the Hut&quot;), became a best seller of its time, surpassing in domestic sales that of &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;. The film covered the story from the romantic affair of his parents Rosalía Suárez and José María Barrientos, his birth out of wedlock, his struggles and hardships, his rejection by society and all the way until his inauguration as President of Colombia in 1918.

==Influence==

In 1881, Suárez won the award of best Colombian writer by the &quot;Academia Colombiana de la Lengua&quot;. His literary work had been to honor the centennial birth of Don Andrés Bello. In recognition to his work, the town of Hatoviejo changed its name to Bello, Antioquia.

The hut where he was born and lived as a child, is preserved as a museum in the town of Bello, Antioquia.

==Popular culture==
It is a point of pride for Colombians that, supposedly, &quot;more poets than soldiers have occupied the Presidency&quot;; as a man of letters, Suárez falls into the former category.

Various popular stories are told about Suárez. During a debate in Congress, an opponent referred to his illegitimate birth, and he responded: &quot;Sir: I am a child of love, it is true. You are a child of obligation.&quot;

Suárez is mentioned in Gabriel García Márquez&#x27;s novel, &quot;Love in the Time of Cholera&quot;.

<doc id="805988" wikidata="Q1624063" url="?curid=805988" title="Fuller (groove)">
<text>A fuller is a rounded or beveled longitudinal groove or slot along the flat side of a blade (e.g., a sword, knife, or bayonet) that serves to both lighten and stiffen the blade, when considering its reduced weight.

Cutting or grinding a fuller into an existing blade will decrease its absolute stiffness due to the removal of material, but much of the strength remains due to the geometry of its shape. When the groove is forged into the blade, it achieves a similar reduction in weight with a relatively small reduction in strength without the wasted material produced by grinding. When impressed during forging, it may be made using a blacksmithing tool that is also called a fuller, a form of spring swage.

When combined with optimal 2025 --&gt;}} distal tapers, heat treatment and blade tempering, a fullered blade can be 20% to 35% lighter than a non-fullered blade. The ridges and groove created by the fuller are comparable to an I-beam&#x27;s flanges and web; this shape aims to optimize the strength and stiffness for a given quantity of material, particularly in the cutting direction.

A fuller is often used to widen a blade during smithing or forging. Fullers are sometimes inaccurately called blood grooves or blood gutters. Channelling blood is not the purpose of a fuller.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;fuller&quot; is from the Middle English &quot;fuliere&quot;, meaning &#x27;one that fulls [pleats] cloth&#x27;. It is derived from the Latin word &quot;fullo&quot;. The first recorded use of the term in relation to metal working is 1587. The first recorded use of the term to describe a groove or channel in a blade is 1967.

==Tool==
As a blacksmithing tool, a fuller is a type of swage, a tool with a cylindrical or beveled face used to imprint grooves into metal. 

Fullers are typically three to six inches long. If a groove is to be applied to both sides of the steel, two fullers may be used at the same time, sandwiching the workpiece in the middle. Often, one fuller will have a peg that holds it securely in the anvil, while the other fuller will have a handle and a flat head, for striking with a hammer. A blade being fullered will generally be slowly pulled through the fullers as it is being hammered, displacing material to the side (rather than removing it) and thereby creating ridges on either side of a groove. These ridges may be hammered flat, widening the blade, or they are often shaped with other swages, increasing the strength of the blade both by creating thicker areas in its cross section and lateral ridges that resist lengthwise deflection.

In addition to being used to &quot;draw out&quot; steel, hammering a short block into a long bar, fullers are also used in the production of items such as hinges and latches, plow parts, and horseshoes.

==Japanese blades==
In Japanese swordsmithing, fullers have a rich tradition and terminology, enough that there are separate terminologies for the top (&quot;hi&quot;, usually pronounced as &quot;bi&quot; when used as the second member of a compound) and bottom (&quot;tome&quot;) ends of the feature.

*&quot;Bo-hi&quot; (): A continuous straight groove of notable width, known as &quot;katana-bi on tantō&quot;. With &quot;soe-bi&quot; (), a secondary narrow groove follows the inner straight length of the main one. With &quot;tsure-bi&quot; (), the secondary is similar but continues beyond the straight length.
:*&quot;Futasuji-hi&quot; (): Two parallel grooves.
:*&quot;Shobu-hi&quot; (): A groove shaped like the leaf of an iris plant.
:*&quot;Naginata-hi&quot; (): A miniature &quot;bo-hi&quot; whose top is oriented opposite from the blade&#x27;s, and usually accompanied by a &quot;soe-bi&quot;. Seen primarily on naginatas. 
:*&quot;Kuichigai-hi&quot; (): Two thin grooves that run the top half of the blade; the bottom half is denoted by the outer groove stopping halfway while the inner one expands to fill the width.
:*&quot;Koshi-bi&quot; (): A short rounded-top groove found near the bottom of a blade, near to the tang.
*&quot;Tome&quot;
:*&quot;Kaki-toshi&quot; (): The groove runs all the way down to the end of the tang.
:*&quot;Kaki-nagashi&quot; (): The groove tapers to a pointed end halfway down the tang.
:*&quot;Kaku-dome&quot; (): The groove stops as a square end within 3 cm of the tang&#x27;s upper end.
:*&quot;Maru-dome&quot; (): Similar to the &quot;kaku&quot;, except with a rounded-end.

==The kukri==
The Nepali kukri has a terminology of its own, including the &quot;aunlo bal&quot; (finger of strength/force/energy), a relatively deep and narrow fuller near the spine of the blade, which runs (at most) between the handle and the corner of the blade, and the &quot;chirra&quot;, which may refer either to shallow fullers in the belly of the blade or a hollow grind of the edge, and of which two or three may be used on each side of the blade.

<doc id="805994" wikidata="Q923673" url="?curid=805994" title="Subh-i-Azal">
<text>Subh-i-Azal (1831–1912, born Mīrzā Yahyā Nūrī) was an Iranian religious leader of Bābism, appointed as head of the movement by the Bāb just before the latter&#x27;s execution in 1850. He is known for his later conflict with his half-brother Baháʼu&#x27;lláh over leadership of the Bābī community, after which his followers became known as Azalis.

At the time of appointment he was just 19 years old. Two years later a pogrom began to exterminate the Bābīs in Iran, and Subh-i-Azal fled for Baghdad for 10 years before joining the group of Bābī exiles that were called to Istanbul. During the time in Baghdad tensions grew with Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, as Bābī pilgrims began to turn to the latter for leadership. The Ottoman government further exiled the group to Edirne, where Subh-i-Azal openly rejected Baháʼu&#x27;lláh&#x27;s claim of divine revelation and the community of Bābīs were divided by their allegiance to one or the other.

In 1868 the Ottoman government further exiled Subh-i-Azal and his followers to Cyprus, and Baháʼu&#x27;lláh and his followers to Acre in Palestine. When Cyprus was leased to Britain in 1878, he lived out the rest of his life in obscurity on a British pension.

By 1904, Azal&#x27;s followers had dwindled to a small minority, and Baháʼu&#x27;lláh was almost universally recognized as the spiritual successor of the Bāb. After Azal&#x27;s death in 1912, the Azali form of Bābism entered a stagnation and has not recovered as there is no acknowledged leader or central organization. Most Bābīs either accepted the claim of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh or the community gradually diminished as children and grandchildren turned back to Islam. A source in 2001 estimated no more than a few thousand, almost entirely in Iran. Another source in 2009 noted a very small number of followers remained in Uzbekistan.

==Name and title==
His given name was Yahyá, which is the Arabic form of the English name &quot;John&quot;. As the son of a nobleman in the county of Núr, he was known as Mīrzā Yahyā Nūrī (). His most widely known title, &quot;Subh-i-Azal&quot; (or &quot;Sobh-i-Ezel&quot;; , &quot;Morning of Eternity&quot;) is derived from an Islamic tradition called the Hadith-i-Kumayl, a tradition the Bāb quotes in his book Dalā&#x27;il-i-Sab&#x27;ih.

It was common practice for the Bāb to confer titles or new names for his followers. Mīrzā Yahyā Nūrī was granted such titles as al-Waḥīd, Ṭalʻat an-Nūr, and ath-Thamara, Everlasting Mirror (Mir&#x27;ātu&#x27;l-Azaliyya), Name of Eternity (Ismu&#x27;l-azal), and Fruit of the Bayan (Thamara-i-Bayan). Subh-i-Azal appears to have been a title adopted by Mīrzā Yahyā Nūrī himself.

==Background==
Subh-i-Azal was born in 1831 to Mīrzā Buzurg-i-Nūrī and his fourth wife Kuchak Khanum-i-Karmanshahi, in the province of Mazandaran. His father was a minister in the court of Fath-Ali Shah Qajar. His mother died while giving birth to him, and his father died in 1839 when he was eight years old, after which he was cared for by his stepmother Khadíjih Khánum, the mother of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh.

In 1845, at about the age of 14, Subh-i-Azal became a follower of the Bāb.

===Early activities in the Bābī community===
Subh-i-Azal met Tahirih, the 17th Letter of the Living who had, upon leaving the Conference of Badasht, traveled to Nur to propagate the faith. Shortly thereafter, she arrived at Barfurush and met Subh-i-Azal and became acquainted once again with Quddús who instructed her to take Subh-i-Azal with her to Nur. Subh-i-Azal remained in Nur for three days, during which he propagated the new faith.

During the Battle of Fort Tabarsi, Subh-i-Azal, along with Baháʼu&#x27;lláh and Mirza Zayn al-Abedin endeavoured to travel there to assist the Bābīs. However, they were arrested several kilometers from Amul. Their imprisonment was ordered by the governor, but Subh-i-Azal escaped the officials for a short while, after which he was discovered by a villager and then brought to Amul on foot with his hands tied. On the path to Amul he was subject to harassment, and people are reported to have spat at him. Upon arriving he was reunited with the other prisoners. The prisoners were ordered to be beaten, but when it came time that Subh-i-Azal should suffer the punishment, Baha&#x27;u&#x27;llah objected and offered to take the beating in his place. After some time, the governor wrote to Abbas Quli Khan who was commander of the government forces stationed near Fort Tabarsi. Khan replied back to the governor&#x27;s correspondence, saying that the prisoners were of distinguished families and should not be harassed. Thus, the prisoners were released and sent to Nur upon orders of the commander.

===Marriages and children===
According to Browne, Mirza Yahya had several wives, and at least nine sons and five daughters. His sons included: Nurullah, Hadi, Ahmad, Abdul Ali, Rizwan Ali (AKA Constantine the Persian), and four others. Rizwan Ali reports that he had eleven or twelve wives. Later research reports that he had up to seventeen wives including four in Iran and at least five in Baghdad. Smith reports that he had &quot;perhaps twenty-five children in all&quot;.

His granddaughter, Roshanak Nodust, was later known for starting Peyk-e Saadat Nesvan, the first woman&#x27;s rights magazine in Iran.

==Appointment==
Subh-i-Azal was appointed by the Bāb to &quot;preserve what hath been revealed in the &quot;Bayān&quot;&quot;, but the nature of his role has been the subject of debate due to conflicting sources. Shortly before the Bāb&#x27;s execution, the Bāb wrote letters and gave them to Mullā Abdu&#x27;l-Karīm to deliver to Subh-i-Azal and Baháʼu&#x27;lláh. These were later interpreted by both Azalīs and Bahāʼīs as proof of the Bāb&#x27;s delegation of leadership to the two brothers. Subh-i-Azal was 19 years old at the time.

In the period immediately following the Bāb&#x27;s execution (1850), there were many claims to authority and Bābīs did not initially unite around Subh-i-Azal&#x27;s leadership, but at some point Azal became the recognized leader, and remained so for about 13 years.

Warburg states that, &quot;It seems likely that Subh-i-Azal was designated to be the Bab&#x27;s successor&quot;, and MacEoin states that, the Bāb regarded him as &quot;his chief deputy&quot; and the &quot;future head of the movement.&quot; The nature of that appointment differs according to which sources are believed. The disagreement is over whether he was appointed a spiritual successor who could write divinely-revealed verses, or a nominal figurehead who would maintain the community until the appearance of a greater prophet. ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá states that the Bāb did this to divert attention from Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, and that it was suggested by the latter.

The conflicting accusations, claims, and counter-claims of Azalī and Bahāʼī sources make it difficult to reconstruct an objective narrative of the splitting of the Bābī community into these two groups, one of which came to dominate and expand, while the other became almost defunct. Academic reviews are generally critical of the official Bahāʼī positions on the split; for example Edward Granville Browne, Denis MacEoin, and A. L. M. Nicolas.

===Nuqtatu&#x27;l-Kaf===
Edward Granville Browne studied the Bābī movement in Iran and translated many primary sources from 1890 to 1920. One of these, &quot;Kitab-i-Nuqtatu&#x27;l-Kaf&quot; (or &quot;Noqtat al-Kāf&quot;), was of particular interest to the appointment of Subh-i-Azal. Its publication was encouraged by Muhammad Khan Qazvīnī, a Shi&#x27;ite scholar, and its authorship was attributed to Hājī Mīrzā Jānī, a Bābī who died in 1852. A similar manuscript attributed to Hājī Mīrzā Jānī and circulating among Bahāʼīs was &quot;Tarikh-i-Jadid&quot;, but the Bahāʼī version lacked extra text supportive of Subh-i-Azal&#x27;s authority. In his introduction to its publication, Browne attacked the Bahāʼīs for trying to rewrite history. Further scholarship showed that the &quot;Nuqtatu&#x27;l-Kaf&quot; was circulating among Bahāʼīs, it wasn&#x27;t being suppressed, and some material in it postdated the death of its assumed author.

Denis MacEoin made a detailed analysis of the question in his &quot;The Sources for Early Babi Doctrine and History&quot; (1992), summarized here by Margit Warburg:
Further investigation by McCants and Milani (2004) found another early copy of the manuscript and concluded that it was written in the early 1850s, though not by Hājī Mīrzā Jānī, and that it was &quot;not markedly different from Browne’s edition&quot;.

===Takur uprising===
The Bābī community was engaged in several pitched military confrontations with the government from 1848 to 1851. Subh-i-Azal allied himself with a faction led by Azīm, and in 1852 coordinated a new militant uprising in Takur, Iran. This new upheaval was apparently timed to coincide with an attempt to assassinate Naser al-Din Shah, which was organized by Azīm.

The uprising failed, and the botched assassination attempt resulted in the entire Bābī community being blamed and severely punished by the government. Many thousand Bābīs were killed. Subh-i-Azal took up a disguise to escape Iran and joined a cohort of exiles in Baghdad.

After Azīm&#x27;s death in 1852, Subh-i-Azal became the clear head of the remaining militant faction of the Bābīs, which remained wedded to a vision of radical political activism; representing what Amanat describes as a preoccupation with, &quot;the Shi&#x27;ite vision of a utopian political order under the aegis of the Imam of the age&quot;.

===Baghdad===
In Baghdad, Subh-i-Azal kept his whereabouts secret and lived secluded from the Bābī community, keeping in contact through 18 agents termed &quot;witnesses of the Bayan&quot;.

The Bābī community in Iran remained fragmented and broken after the pogrom of 1852–3, and new leadership claims developed. The most significant challenger to Subh-i-Azal was Mirza Asad Allah Khu&#x27;i, known by the title Dayyān, who made a claim to be He whom God shall make manifest. Azal wrote a lengthy refutation of Dayyān titled &quot;Mustayqiz&quot;. Dayyān was killed in Baghdad by Mirza Muhammad Mazandarani in 1856 at the order of Subh-i-Azal.

Subh-i-Azal&#x27;s leadership was controversial. He generally absented himself from the Bābī community, spending his time in Baghdad in hiding and disguise. Subh-i-Azal gradually alienated himself from a large proportion of the Bābīs who started to give their alliance to other claimants. Bahāʼī sources have attributed this to his incompetence and cowardice, but MacEoin also attributes the isolation to the Shi&#x27;a practice of &quot;Taqiyya&quot;.

During the Baghdad period of 1853–1863, tensions rose between Subh-i-Azal and Baháʼu&#x27;lláh. Bahāʼī sources describe Azal as increasing in jealousy during this time, and Baháʼu&#x27;lláh&#x27;s 2-year sojourn in Kurdistan as an attempt to avoid the growing disunity.

===Edirne===
In 1863 most of the Bābīs were called by the Ottoman authorities to Istanbul for four months, followed by an exile to Edirne that lasted from 12 December 1863 to 12 August 1868. The travel to Istanbul began with Baháʼu&#x27;lláh privately making his claim to be the messianic figure of the Bayan, which became a public proclamation in Edirne. This created a permanent schism between the two brothers. Subh-i-Azal responded to these claims by making his own claims and resisting the changes of doctrine which were introduced by Baháʼu&#x27;lláh. His attempts to keep the traditional Bābism were, however, mostly unpopular.

Subh-i-Azal was behind the poisoning of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh while in Edirne in 1865. An Azali source later re-applied these allegations to Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, even claiming that he poisoned himself while trying to poison Subh-i-Azal. The poisoning had adverse effects on Bahaʼu&#x27;lláh throughout the remainder of his life. A Bahāʼī, Salmānī, reported that Azal again attempted to have Baháʼu&#x27;lláh killed in the late winter of 1866. In March 1866, Baháʼu&#x27;lláh responded with a formal written declaration to Subh-i-Azal in the &quot;Sūri-yi Amr&quot; and referred to his own followers as Bahāʼīs.

This began an approximately year-long separation that ended with a definite schism. The two brothers separated households, and the Bābīs in Iraq and Iran split into three factions: Azalīs, Bahāʼīs, or undecided. In February–March 1867, all three factions gathered in Baghdad for debates, and soon the undecided mostly joined the Bahāʼīs, who were already in the majority. In Edirne, the group of about 100 Bābīs was still socially intermixed until the summer of 1867, when they lived separately based on their loyalties.

A crisis erupted in August/September 1867. Sayyid Muhammad Isfahānī, an Azalī, instigated a public debate between the two brothers to settle the disputed claims. On a Friday morning, Azal challenged Baháʼu&#x27;lláh to a debate in the Sultan Selim Mosque that afternoon. Cole describes the communication,
Baháʼu&#x27;lláh arrived at the mosque, with a crowd waiting, and sent a messenger to the home of Subh-i-Azal to remind him of the challenge, but Azal told the messenger that the confrontation would have to be postponed. That night, Baháʼu&#x27;lláh wrote to Azal, proposing that either Sunday or Monday they would complete the challenge, but Azal never responded to the request and never showed up on those days. The Bahā’īs interpreted Azal&#x27;s failure to appear at his own challenge as cowardice, and it caused the further deterioration of Subh-i-Azal&#x27;s credibility. The news quickly spread to Iran, where the majority of Bābīs still lived.

===Cyprus===

Subh-i-Azal, along with Sayyid Muhammad Isfanani made accusations against Baháʼu&#x27;lláh to the Ottoman authorities, which resulted in both factions being further exiled in 1868; Baháʼu&#x27;lláh to Acre and Azal to Famagusta in Cyprus.

The formal exile of Subh-i-Azal ended in 1881, when Cyprus was acquired by Britain in the aftermath of the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), but he remained on the island for the rest of his life until his death on 29 April 1912. He remained elusive and secretive, living off a British pension and being perceived as a Muslim holy man by the people of Cyprus, even receiving a Muslim burial. From Cyprus he seemed to have little contact with the Bābīs in Iran.

Harry Luke, an official of the British Colonial Office, commented in 1913 that after Subh-i-Azal&#x27;s arrival in Cyprus,
==Succession==
There are conflicting reports as to whom Subh-i-Azal appointed as his successor, and there was confusion after his death. Azal originally planned to appoint his eldest son Ahmad, but a dispute between them caused the appointment to be withdrawn and he instead appointed Hādī Dawlatābādī (d. 1908). After the latter&#x27;s death, Subh-i-Azal further appointed the man&#x27;s son, Yahyā Dawlatābādī (d. 1939), but he had little involvement in the religion and any chain of leadership appears to have gone defunct with his appointment.

Subh-i-Azal&#x27;s son, Rizwan ʻAli, wrote to C.D. Cobham on 11 July 1912, 
H.C. Lukach wrote to Browne on 5 September 1912,
Shoghi Effendi wrote in 1944 that Subh-i-Azal appointed Hādī Dawlatābādī as his successor, and that he later publicly recanted his faith in the Bāb and in Subh-i-Azal. Hādī was targeted for death by a local cleric, and despite the public recantation, he continued being a leader of the Azalis in secret.

Jalal Azal, a grandson of Subh-i-Azal who disputed the appointment of Hādī Dawlatābādī, later told William Miller between 1967 and 1971 that Azal did not appoint a successor.

===Aftermath===
Several Azalī Bābīs were influential in the Iranian Constitutional Revolution. For example, the writings of two sons-in-law of Subh-i-Azal, Mīrzā Āqā Khān Kirmānī (d. 1896) and Shaykh Ahmad Rūhī Kirmānī (d. 1896), both influenced the movement. Yahyā Dawlatābādī (d. 1939), the appointed successor of Subh-i-Azal, his younger brother `Alī-Muhammad, as well as Jamāl al-Dīn Esfahānī and Malik al-Motakallemīn were all associated with Azalī Bābism and influencing constitutional and secular reforms. However, Yahyā Dawlatābādī was stigmatized as a Bābī and, like his father, publicly distanced himself from association with the Azalīs while presenting himself as Muslim; he was nearly killed in 1908 and soon exiled from Iran as an anti-monarchist activist.

The 7 &quot;witnesses of the Bayan&quot; that remained loyal to him were Sayyid Muhammad Isfahani, Mulla Muhammad Ja&#x27;far Naraqi, Mulla Muhammad Taqi, Haji Sayyid Muhammad (Isfahani), Haji Sayyid Jawad (al-Karbala&#x27;i), Mirza Muhammad Husayn Mutawalli-bashi Qummi, and Mulla Rajab &#x27;Ali Qahir. The remaining 11 witnesses later became Bahāʼīs and abandoned Subh-i-Azal.

Ahmad Bahhaj (1853–1933), son of Subh-i-Azal and Fatima (sister of Baqir), later moved to Haifa and became a Bāha&#x27;ī. Jalal Azal (d. 1971), the son of `Abdu&#x27;l-`Ali and grandson of Subh-i-Azal, also became a Bāha&#x27;ī around 1920 and married a granddaughter of Bāha&#x27;u&#x27;llāh. However, Jalal Azal joined Mīrzā Muhammad ʻAlī&#x27;s opposition and turned against ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá.

By the time of Subh-i-Azal&#x27;s death 1912, the Azali form of Bābism entered a stagnation from which it never recovered, as it has not had an acknowledged leader or central organization.

There may have been between 500 and 5,000 Azalis in Iran in the 1970s. A source in 2001 estimated no more than a few thousand, almost entirely in Iran.

==Works==
Large collections of Subh-i-Azal&#x27;s works are found in the British Museum Library Oriental Collection, London; in the Browne Collection at Cambridge University; at the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris; and at Princeton University. In the English introduction to &quot;Personal Reminiscences of the Babi Insurrection at Zanjan in 1850,&quot; Browne lists thirty-eight titles as being among the works of Subh-i-Azal.

<text>Fenn O&#x27;Berg was an improvisational computer music trio made up of members Christian Fennesz, Peter Rehberg and Jim O&#x27;Rourke. Their existence began with a surprise appearance at the Nickelsdorf Festival in 1997. This was followed by extensive international touring in 1998–99, bringing a live stage setup consisting solely of portable computing devices to venues which would not usually have booked such shows at that time.

The cover art for their first two albums is provided by Chicks on Speed.

The song &quot;Floating My Boat&quot; features a sample from Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Expecting to Fly,&quot; which was orchestrated by famed producer Jack Nitzsche. Band member Jim O&#x27;Rourke has stated in interviews that he greatly enjoys Nitzsche&#x27;s production work.

<doc id="806010" wikidata="Q852277" url="?curid=806010" title="Landless Workers' Movement">
<text>The Landless Workers&#x27; Movement (, MST) is a social movement in Brazil aimed at land reform. Inspired by Marxism, it is the largest such movement in Latin America, with an estimated informal membership of 1.5 million across 23 of Brazil&#x27;s 26 states. 

MST defines its goals as access to the land for poor workers through land reform in Brazil, and activism around social issues that make land ownership more difficult to achieve, such as unequal income distribution, racism, sexism, and media monopolies. MST strives to achieve a self-sustainable way of life for the rural poor.

The MST differs from previous land reform movements in its single-issue focus; land reform for them is a self-justifying cause. The organization maintains that it is legally justified in occupying unproductive land, pointing to the most recent Constitution of Brazil (1988), which contains a passage saying that land must fulfill a social function (Article 5, XXIII). The MST also notes, based on 1996 census statistics, that a mere 3% of the population owns two-thirds of all arable land in Brazil.

In 1991, MST received the Right Livelihood Award &quot;for winning land for landless families, and helping them to farm it sustainably.&quot;

==Land reform before the 1988 Constitution==

Land reform has a long history in Brazil, and the concept predates the MST. In the mid-20th century, Brazilian leftists reached a consensus that the democratization and widespread actual exercise of political rights would require land reform. Brazilian political elites actively opposed land reform initiatives, which they felt threatened their social and political status. Political leaders of the rural poor then attempted to achieve land reform from below, through grassroots action. MST broke new ground by tackling land reform itself, by &quot;breaking...dependent relations with parties, governments, and other institutions,&quot; and framing the issue in purely political terms, rather than social, ethical, or religious ones.

The first statute to regulate land ownership in Brazil after its independence, Law 601 or &quot;Lei de Terras&quot; (Landed Property Act), took effect September 18, 1850. A colonial administration, based on Portuguese feudal law, had previously considered property ownership to stem from royal grants (&quot;sesmarias&quot;), and were passed through primogeniture (&quot;morgadio&quot;). In the independent Brazilian state, the default means of acquiring land was through purchase, from either the state or a previous private owner. This law strongly limited squatter&#x27;s rights, and favoured the historic concentration of land ownership, which became a hallmark of modern Brazilian social history. The &quot;Lei de Terras&quot; left in place the colonial practice of favoring of large landholdings created by mammoth land grants to well-placed people, which were usually worked by enslaved people.

Continuing the policy favored economies of scale, given the limited number of landowners, but simultaneously made it difficult for small planters and peasants to obtain the land needed to practice subsistence agriculture and small-scale farming.

The consolidation of land ownership into just a few hands had ties to the advent of capitalism in Brazil, and opposition and insurrection in the 19th and early 20th century (for example, the Canudos War in the 1890s, and the Contestado War in the 1910s) idealized older forms of property, and revitalized ideologies centered on a fabled millenarian return to an earlier, pre-bourgeois social order. Advocated by groups led by rogue messianic religious leaders outside the established Catholic hierarchy, these ideologies seemed heretical and revolutionary. Some leftist historians, following the tracks of the groundbreaking 1963 work by journalist (&quot;Cangaceiros e Fanáticos&quot;), tend to conflate early 20th-century banditry in northeastern Brazil (&quot;cangaço&quot;) with messianism as a kind of social banditry, a protest against such social inequalities as the uneven distribution of land assets. This theory developed independently in English-speaking academia around Eric Hobsbawn&#x27;s 1959 work &quot;Primitive Rebels&quot;. It was criticized for its unspecific definition of &quot;social movement,&quot; but also praised for melding political and religious movements, previously separately examined. This blend was later the basis for the MST&#x27;s emergence.

Both messianism and &quot;cangaço &quot;disappeared in the late 1930s, but in the 1940s and &#x27;50s, additional peasant resistance broke out to evictions and land grabbing by powerful ranchers:
*Teófilo Otoni, Minas Gerais, in 1948
*Porecatu, Paraná, in 1951
*Southwest Paraná, in 1957
*Trombas and Goiás, 1952–1958 
These local affairs, however, were repressed or settled locally, and did not give rise to an ideology. Policy makers and scholars across the political spectrum believed that it was an objective economic necessity to permit the end of Brazilian rural society through mechanized agrobusiness and forced urbanization. The left, in particular, felt that the technologically backward, feudal &quot;latifundia&quot; impeded both economic modernization and democratization.

During the 1960s, various groups attempted land reform through the legal system, beginning with the peasant leagues (&quot;Ligas Camponesas&quot;) in northeastern Brazil, which opposed the evictions of tenant farmers land, and the transformation of plantations into cattle ranches. These groups questioned the existing distribution of land ownership through a rational appeal to the social function of property.

Despite the efforts of these groups, land ownership continued to concentrate, and Brazil to this day has had a highly dynamic and robust agricultural business sector at the price of extensive dislocation of the rural poor. MST questioned the scope of the benefits from the alleged efficiency of the change, given that since 1850, Brazilian land development had been concerned with the interests of a single class — the rural bourgeoisie. While the MST frames its policies in socio-economic terms, it still points to Canudos and its alleged millenarism to legitimize its existence, and to develop a powerful mystique of its own.

A great deal of the early organizing in the MST came from Catholic communities. Much of MST ideology and practice come from a social doctrine of the Catholic Church: that private property should serve a social function. This principle developed during the 19th century, and became Catholic doctrine with Pope Leo XIII&#x27;s &quot;Rerum novarum&quot; encyclical, promulgated on the eve of the 1964 military coup (&quot;golpe militar&quot;). This doctrine was evoked by President João Goulart at a rally in Rio de Janeiro, at which he offered a blueprint for political and social reforms, and proposed expropriation of estates larger than 600 hectares in areas near federal facilities, such as roads, railroads, reservoirs, and sanitation works; these ideas triggered a strong conservative backlash, and led to Goulart&#x27;s loss of power. Nevertheless, the Brazilian Catholic hierarchy formally acknowledged the principle in 1980.

In Brazilian constitutional history, land reform — understood in terms of public management of natural resources — was first explicitly mentioned as a guiding principle of government in the 1967 constitution, which sought to institutionalize an authoritarian consensus after the 1964 coup. The military dictatorship intended to use land reform policy to develop a buffer of conservative small farmers between &quot;latifundia&quot; owners and the rural proletariat. In 1969, at the most repressive point of the dictatorship, the 1967 constitution was amended via a decree (&quot;ato institucional&quot;) by a junta that held interim power during the final illness of president Arthur da Costa e Silva, and authorized government compensation for property expropriated for land reform. This compensation would be made in government bonds rather than cash, previously the only legal practice (Art. 157, §1, as amended by Institutional Act No. 9, 1969).

==Land reform and the 1988 Constitution==
The Constitution passed in 1988 required that &quot;property shall serve its social function,&quot; and that the government should &quot;expropriate for the purpose of agrarian reform, rural property that is not performing its social function.&quot;

Under Article 186 of the Constitution, a social function is performed when rural property simultaneously meets the following requirements:
* Rational and adequate use.
* Adequate use of available natural resources, and preservation of the environment.
* Compliance with the provisions which regulate labor relations.
* Development uses which favor the well-being of owners and workers.

Since the criteria are vague and not objectively defined, the social interest principle was seen as a mixed blessing, but accepted in general. Landowners have lobbied against the principle since 1985 through the landowners&#x27; organization, União Democrática Ruralista (Democratic Union of Rural People, or UDR), whose rise and organization parallels that of the MST. Although it avowedly dissolved itself in the early 1990s, some believe it persists in informal regional ties between landowners. UDR lobbying over the constitutional text is believed to have watered down concrete enforcement of the &quot;social interest&quot; principle.

One Brazilian law handbook argues that land reform, as understood in the 1988 Constitution, is a concept made up of various &quot;compromises,&quot; on which constitutional law has consistently evaded taking a clear stance, and so one could argue either for or against the MST without leaving the framework of the Constitution. The lack of clear government commitment to land reform precludes the MST engaging in public-interest litigation, so concrete proceedings for land reform are left to the initiative of the groups concerned, through onerous and time-consuming legal proceedings. Given &quot;the highly problematic and ideologically driven nature of the Brazilian justice system,&quot; all parties have an incentive to resort to more informal methods: &quot;while the large landowners try to evacuate squatters from their land, squatters might use violence to force institutional intervention favoring them with the land expropriation afterwards [...] violence is mandatory for both sides to achieve their goals.&quot; These tactics raise controversy about the legality of the MST&#x27;s actions, since it tries to ensure social justice unilaterally.

The MST identifies rural land it believes to be unproductive and that does not meet its social function, then occupies the land, only afterwards moving to ascertain the legality of the occupation. The MST is represented in these activities by public interest legal counsel, including their own lawyers, sons and daughters of MST families, and organizations, such as &quot;Terra de Direitos&quot;, a human rights organization co-founded by Darci Frigo, the 2001 Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Human Rights Award Laureate. The courts might eventually issue a warrant for eviction, requiring the occupier families to leave, or they might deny the landowner&#x27;s petition, and allow the families to stay provisionally, and engage in subsistence farming until the federal agency responsible for agrarian reform, Brazil&#x27;s National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA), determines whether occupied property had indeed been unproductive. The MST&#x27;s legal activity bases itself on the idea that property rights are in a continuous process of social construction, so litigation and seeking to strike sympathy among the judiciary is essential to MST&#x27;s legitimacy.

Traditionally, Brazilian courts side with landowners, and file charges against MST members some call &quot;frivolous and bizarre.&quot; For instance, in a 2004 land occupation in Pernambuco, a judge issued arrest warrants for MST members, and described them as highly dangerous criminals. Nevertheless, many individual judges have shown themselves sympathetic. Brazilian higher courts have usually regarded the MST with reserve: in February 2009, for instance, the then-president of the Brazilian Supreme Court (STF), Gilmar Mendes, declared the MST engaged in &quot;illicit&quot; activities, opposed granting it public monies, and supported an &quot;adequate&quot; judicial response towards land occupation. The MST leadership has, in turn on various occasions, charged that the STF as a whole is consistently hostile to the movement. In late 2013, it described the court as &quot;lackeying to the ruling class,&quot; and &quot;working for years against the working class and social movements.&quot; This fraught relationship came to a head on February 12, 2014, when a court session was suspended after an attempted invasion of the court building in Brasília by MST activists, who were met by police firing rubber bullets and tear gas.

==History==
===Foundation===

The smashing of the peasant leagues following the 1964 coup opened the way for commercialized agriculture and concentration of land ownership throughout the period of the military dictatorship, and an absolute decline in the rural population during the 1970s. In the mid-1980s, out of 370 million hectares of total farm land, 285 million hectares (77%) were held by latifundia. The re-democratization process in the 1980s, however, allowed grassroots movements to pursue their own interests, rather than those of the state and the ruling classes. The emergence of the MST fits into this framework.

Between late 1980 and early 1981, over 6,000 landless families established an encampment on land located between three unproductive estates in Brazil&#x27;s southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul. These families included 600 households expropriated and dislocated in 1974 from nearby to make way for construction of a hydroelectric dam. This first group was later joined by an additional 300 (or, according to other sources, over 1,000) households evicted by FUNAI from the Kaingang Indian reservation in Nonoai, where they had been renting plots since 1968. Local mobilization of the Passo Real and Nonoai people had already achieved some land distribution on non-Indian land, followed by demobilization. Those who had not received land under these claims, joined by others, and led by leaders from the existing regional movement, MASTER (Rio Grande do Sul landless farmers&#x27; movement), made up the 1980/1981 encampment. The location became known as the Encruzilhada Natalino. With the support of civil society, including the progressive branch of the Catholic Church, the families resisted a blockade imposed by military force. Enforcement of the blockade was entrusted by the government to Army colonel , already notorious for his past counter-insurgency efforts against the Araguaia guerrillas.

Curió enforced the blockade ruthlessly; most of the landless refused his offer of resettlement on the Amazonian frontier, and eventually pressured the military government into expropriating nearby lands for agrarian reform. The Encruzilhada Natalino episode set a pattern. Most of subsequent early development of the MST concerned exactly the areas of southern Brazil where, in the absence of an open frontier, an ideological appeal at an alternate foundation for access to the land—other than formal private property—was developed in response to the growing difficulties agribusiness posed for family farming. The MST also developed what became its chief &quot;modus operandi&quot;: local organizing around the concrete struggles of a specific demographic group.

The MST was officially founded in January 1984, during a National Encounter of landless workers in Cascavel, Paraná, as Brazil&#x27;s military dictatorship drew to a close. Its founding was strongly connected to Catholic-based organizations, such as the Pastoral Land Commission, which provided support and infrastructure.

During much of the 1980s, the MST faced political competition from the National Confederacy of Agrarian Workers&#x27; (CONTAG), heir to the peasant leagues of the 1960s, who sought land reform strictly through legal means, by favoring trade unionism, and striving to wrestle concessions from bosses for rural workers. But the more aggressive tactics of the MST in striving for access to land gave a political legitimacy that soon outshone CONTAG, which limited itself to trade-unionism in the strictest sense, acting until today as a rural branch of the Central Única dos Trabalhadores (CUT). MST eventually all but monopolized political attention as a spokesman for rural workers.

From the 1980s on, the MST has not maintained a monopoly of land occupations, many of which are carried out by a host of grassroots organizations (dissidents from the MST, trade unions, informal coalitions of land workers). However, the MST is by far the most organized group dealing in occupations, and has enough political leverage to turn occupations into formal expropriations for public purposes. In 1995, only 89 of 198 occupations (45%) were organized by the MST, but these included 20,500 (65%) out of the grand total of 31,400 families involved.

=== 1995–2005 Cardoso government ===
Brazil has long history of violent land conflict. During the 1990s, the MST emerged as the most prominent land reform movement in Brazil, and in 1995–1999, led a first wave of occupations which resulted in violence. The MST, landowners, and the government accused each other of the killings, maimings, and property damage.

In the notorious Eldorado de Carajás massacre in 1996, nineteen MST members were gunned down, and another 69 were wounded by police as they blocked a state road in Pará. In 1997 alone, similar confrontations with police and landowners&#x27; security details accounted for two dozen internationally acknowledged deaths.

In 2002, the MST occupied the family farm of then-president Fernando Henrique Cardoso in Minas Gerais, a move publicly condemned by Lula, then-leader of the leftist opposition, and other prominent members of the PT. The farm was damaged and looted in the occupation, and a combine harvester, tractor, and several pieces of furniture were destroyed. MST members also drank all the alcohol at the farm. Later, 16 MST leaders were charged with theft, vandalism, trespassing, kidnapping, and resisting arrest.

In 2005, two undercover police officers investigating cargo truck robberies near an MST homestead in Pernambuco were attacked. One was shot dead, and the other tortured; MST was suspected to be involved.

Throughout the early 2000s, the MST occupied functioning facilities owned by large corporations, whose activities it considered at odds with the social function of property. On March 8, 2005, the MST invaded a nursery and a research center in Barra do Ribeiro, 56 km (34.8 mi) from Porto Alegre, both owned by Aracruz Celulose. The MST members held local guards captive while they ripped plants from the ground. MST president João Pedro Stédile commented that MST should oppose not only landowners, but also agrobusinesses that partook in &quot;the project of organization of agriculture by transnational capital allied to capitalist farming&quot;—a model he deemed socially backwards and environmentally harmful. In the words of an anonymous activist: &quot;our struggle is not only to win the land ... we are building a new way of life.&quot; The shift had been developing since the movement&#x27;s 2000 national congress, which focused mainly on the perceived threat of transnational corporations, whether Brazilian or foreign, to both small property in general, and to Brazilian national food sovereignty, especially in the area of intellectual property. In July 2000, this principle was the impetus for MST to mobilize and lead farmers in an attack against a ship loaded with GM maize from Argentina that was docked in Recife. Since 2000, much of the movement&#x27;s activism consisted in symbolic acts in opposition of multinational corporations, as &quot;a symbol of the intervention politics of the big monopolies operating in Brazil.&quot;

A possible reason contributing to the change in strategy might have been the perceived shift in government stances in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The Cardoso government declared that Brazil &quot;had no need&quot; for land reform, that small farms were not competitive, and were unlikely to increase personal incomes in rural areas. He believed that it would be better to create skilled jobs, which would cause the land reform issue to recede into the background. Cardoso denounced the MST&#x27;s actions as aiming for a return to an archaic, agrarian past, and therefore, in conflict with &quot;modernity&quot;—&quot;one of the enabling myths of the neoliberal discourse.&quot;

Cardoso offered lip service to agrarian reform in general, but also described the movement as &quot;a threat to democracy.&quot; He compared the MST&#x27;s demands for subsidized credit, which led to the 1998 occupation of various banks in Paraná, to bank robbery. In a memoir written after he left office, Cardoso expressed sympathy for land reform, stating, &quot;were I not President, I would probably be out marching with them,&quot; but also countering, &quot;the image of mobs taking over privately-owned farms would chase away investment, both local and foreign.&quot; Although Cardoso himself never branded the MST as terrorists, his Minister of Agricultural Development did, and even hypothesized that the MST invaded Argentina from the north in order to blackmail the Brazilian government into action. In July 1997, Senior General Alberto Cardoso, Cardoso&#x27;s Chief of Military Household (&quot;Chefe da Casa Militar&quot;, among other things, a general comptroller over all issues regarding the military and police forces as armed civil servants), expressed concern about participation of MST activists in the then-ongoing police officers&#x27; strikes, as a plot to &quot;destabilize&quot; the military.

In terms of concrete measures, Cardoso&#x27;s government&#x27;s approach to land reform was divided: while the administration simultaneously acquired land for settlement and increased taxes on unused land, it also forbade public inspection of invaded land—thereby precluding future expropriation, and the disbursement of public funds to people involved in such invasions. Cardoso&#x27;s main land reform project, supported by a World Bank US$90 million loan, was addressed to &quot;individuals&quot; who had experience in farming, and a yearly income of up to US$15,000; they were granted a loan of up to US$40,000 if they could associate with other rural producers in order to buy land from a willing landholder. Thus, this programme catered primarily to substantial small farmers, not to the MST&#x27;s traditional constituency—the rural poor. Cardoso&#x27;s project, &quot;Cédula da Terra&quot; (&quot;landcard&quot;), did offer previously landless people the opportunity to buy land from landowners, but in a negotiated process.

In the words of an American scholar, despite its efforts in resettlement, the Cardoso government did not confront the prevailing mode of agricultural production: concentrated, mechanized, latifundia-friendly commodity production—and the resulting injustices. In his own words, what Cardoso could not accept about the MST was what he saw not as a struggle for land reform, but a wider struggle against the capitalist system. Therefore, Cardoso&#x27;s administration tried to initiate tamer social movements for land reform on purely negotiated terms, such as the Movement of Landless Producers (&quot;Movimento dos Agricultores Sem Terra&quot;, or MAST), organized on a local basis in the São Paulo State, around the trade union central Syndical Social Democracy (SDS).

By contrast, MST leaders emphasized that their practical activity was a response to the poverty of so many people who had little prospects of productive, continuous work in conventional labor markets. This reality was admitted by President Cardoso in a 1996 interview: &quot;I&#x27;m not going to say that my government will be of the excluded, for that it cannot be ... I don&#x27;t know how many excluded there will be.&quot; In 2002, João Pedro Stedile admitted that in plotting the movement&#x27;s politics, one had to keep in mind &quot;that there are a great many lumpens in the country areas.&quot; In Stedile&#x27;s view, the existence of the large underclass should not be held against the working class character of the movement, because many rural working class had been &quot;absorbed&quot; into the periphery of the urban proletariat. Such a view is shared by some academic authors, who argue that, behind its avowedly &quot;peasant&quot; character, the MST, as far as class politics is concerned, is mostly a &quot;semi proletarian&quot; movement, consisting of congregations of people trying to eke out a living in the absence of formal wage employment, out of a range of activities across a whole section of the social divisions of labour.

MST somewhat filled the void left by the decline of the organized labor movement in the wake of Cardoso&#x27;s neoliberal policies. Therefore, the movement took steps to ally with urban struggles, especially those connected to housing. João Pedro Stedile stated that the struggle for land reform would unfold in the countryside, but would be decided in the city, where &quot;political power for structural change&quot; resided.

=== 2005–2010 Lula government and March for Agrarian Reform ===

The Lula government was seen by the MST as a leftist and therefore friendly government, so MST decided to shun occupations of public buildings in favor of actions against private landed states, in a second wave of occupations starting in 2003. However, the Lula government&#x27;s increasingly conservative positions, including its low profile on land reform, (actually somewhat less than achieved by Cardoso in his first term) impelled the movement to change its stance as early as early 2004, when it again began to occupy public buildings and Banco do Brasil agencies.

In June 2003, the MST occupied the R&amp;D farm of the Monsanto Company in the state of Goiás. On March 7, 2008, a similar action by women activists at another Monsanto facility in Santa Cruz das Palmeiras, São Paulo, destroyed a nursery and an experimental patch of genetically modified maize, slowing ongoing scientific research. MST said they destroyed the facility to protest government support for the extensive use of GMOs supplied by transnational corporations in agriculture. In 2003, Lula authorized the sale and use of GM soybeans, which led MST&#x27;s Stedile to call him a &quot;transgenic politician.&quot; The dominance of transnationals over Brazilian seed production was summed by the fact that the Brazilian hybrid seed industry in the early 2000s was already 82% Monsanto-owned, which the MST saw as detrimental to the development of organic agriculture in spite of the economic benefits, and enabling possible future health hazards similar to intensive use of pesticides. Stedile later called Monsanto one of the ten transnational companies that controlled virtually all international agrarian production and commodity trading. Similarly, in 2006, the MST occupied a research station in Paraná owned by Swiss corporation Syngenta, which had produced GMO contamination near the Iguaçu National Park. After a bitter confrontation over the existence of the station (which included easing of previous restrictions by the Lula government to allow Syngenta to continue GMO research), the premises were transferred to the Paraná state government, and converted into an agroecology research center.

After an exchange of barbs between Lula and Stedile over what Lula saw as an unnecessary radicalization of the movement&#x27;s demands, the MST decided to call a huge national demonstration. In May 2005, after a two-week, 200-odd kilometer march from the city of Goiânia, nearly 13,000 landless workers arrived in their nation&#x27;s capital, Brasília. The MST march targeted the U.S. embassy and Brazilian Finance Ministry, rather than President Lula. While thousands of landless carried banners and scythes through the streets, a delegation of 50 held a three-hour meeting with Lula, who donned an MST cap for the cameras. During this session, Lula recommitted to settling 430,000 families by the end of 2006, and to allocating the human and financial resources to accomplish this. He also committed to a range of related reforms, including an increase in the pool of land available for redistribution [Ramos, 2005]. Later, the Lula government would claim to have resettled 381,419 families between 2002 and 2006—a claim disputed by the MST. The movement argued the numbers had been doctored by the inclusion of people already living in areas (national forests and other managed areas of environmental protection, as well as other already existing settlements) where their presence had only been legally acknowledged by the government. The MST also criticised Lula&#x27;s administration to call mere land redistribution by means of handing out of small plots land as &quot;reform,&quot; when it was simply a form of welfarism (&quot;assistencialismo&quot;) that was unable to change the productive system.

The march was held to demand, among other things, that President Lula implement his own limited agrarian reform plan, rather than spend the project&#x27;s budget on servicing the national debt [Ramos, 2005]. Several MST leaders met with President Lula da Silva on May 18, 2005—a meeting that had been resisted by Lula since his taking of office. The leaders presented Lula with 16 demands, including economic reform, greater public spending, and public housing. In interviews with Reuters, many of the leaders said they still regarded Lula as an ally, but demanded that he accelerate his promised land reforms. However, in September of that year, João Pedro Stedile declared that, in terms of land reform, Lula&#x27;s government was &quot;finished.&quot; By the end of Lula&#x27;s first term, it was clear that the MST had decided to act again as a separate movement, irrespective of the government&#x27;s agenda. As far as the MST was concerned, the greatest gain it received from the Lula government was the &quot;non-criminalization&quot; of the movement itself; the tough, anti-occupation measures taken by the Cardoso government were left in abeyance, and not enforced. Attempts to officially define the MST as a &quot;terrorist organization&quot; were also opposed by Workers&#x27; Party congresspersons. Nevertheless, the Lula government never acted in tandem with the MST, according to a general pattern of keeping organized social movements outside the fostering of the government&#x27;s agenda.

However, as stated by a German author, the Lula government year after year proposed a blueprint for land reform that was regularly blocked by regional agrarian elites.

Lula&#x27;s election to the presidency raised the possibility of active government support for land reform, so conservative media increased their efforts to brand the MST&#x27;s actions as felonies. In May 2005, &quot;Veja&quot; accused the MST of helping the Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC), the most powerful prison-gang criminal organization in São Paulo. A police phone tap recording of a conversation between PCC leaders mentioned the MST; one of them said he had &quot;just talked with the leaders of the MST,&quot; who would &quot;give instructions&quot; to the gang about the best ways to stage what became the largest protest by prisoners&#x27; relatives in Brazilian history. On April 18, 2005, some 3,000 relatives protested prevailing conditions in São Paulo&#x27;s correctional facilities. The MST &quot;leaders&quot; were not named. No MST activist, real or alleged, took part in the taped conversations. The MST denied any link in a formal written statement, calling the supposed evidence hearsay, and an attempt to criminalize the movement. In the wake of 9/11, Brazilian media tended to describe the MST as &quot;terrorists,&quot; lumping it together loosely with various historical and mediatic happenings in keeping with an international post-9/11 trends of relegating any political movement against existing globalization to beyond the pale, and outside the boundaries of permissible political discourse.

The MST assumes its activities are continuously surveilled by military intelligence. Various intelligence organs, Brazilian and foreign, assume a relationship between the MST and various terrorist groups. The MST is regarded as a source of &quot;civil unrest.&quot;

In late 2005, a parliamentary inquiry commission, where landowner-friendly congressmen held a majority, classified the MST&#x27;s activities as terrorism, and the MST itself as a criminal organization. However, its report met no support from the PT members of the commission, and a senator ripped it up before TV cameras, saying that those who voted for it were &quot;accomplices of murder, people who use slave labor, [and] who embezzle land illegally.&quot; Nevertheless, based on this report, a bill presented to the Chamber of Deputies in 2006 by Congressman Abelardo Lupion (Democrats- Paraná), proposed making &quot;invading others&#x27; property with the end of pressuring the government&quot; a terrorist action, and therefore, a heinous crime. A &quot;heinous&quot; crime in Brazilian law is a felony, designated as such in a 1990 Brazilian law, and those accused of committing them are ineligible for pretrial release.

In April 2006, the MST took over the farm of Suzano Papel e Celulose, a large maker of paper products, in the state of Bahia, because it had more than six square kilometres devoted to eucalyptus growth. Eucalyptus, a non-native plant, has been blamed for environmental degradation in northeastern Brazil, as well as reducing the availability of land for small agricultural production, called by some as &quot;cornering&quot; producers (&quot;encurralados pelo eucalipto&quot;). In 2011, &quot;Veja&quot; described such activities as plain theft of eucalyptus wood, quoting an estimate from the state&#x27;s military police that 3,000 people earned a living in Southern Bahia from theft of wood.

In 2008, a group of public attorneys from Rio Grande do Sul who were working with the state&#x27;s military police issued a report, charging the MST with collusion with international terrorist groups. The report was used in state courts, according to Amnesty International, to justify eviction orders carried out by the police with &quot;excessive use of force.&quot; The group of attorneys made public a previously classified report by the Council of Public Attorneys of Rio Grande do Sul, and asked the state to ban the MST by declaring it an illegal organization.

The report declared further investigation pointless, &quot;as it was public knowledge that the movement and its leadership were guilty of engaging in organized criminality.&quot; The report also proposed that where MST activists could &quot;cause electoral disequilibrium,&quot; the activists&#x27; right to vote be withdrawn by striking them from the voter registry. Declarations issued at the same time by the State Association of Military Policy Commissioned Officers, in an open Red Scare vein, declared the MST &quot;an organized movement, striving at instituting a totalitarian state in our country.&quot;

Between September 27 and October 7, 2009, the MST occupied an orange plantation in Borebi, State of São Paulo, owned by orange juice multinational Cutrale. The corporation claimed to have lost R$1.2 million (roughly US$603,000) in damaged equipment, missing pesticide, destroyed crops, and trees cut by MST activists. In response, the MST declared the farm to be government property that was illegally embezzled by Cutrale, and that the occupation was intended to protest this, while the destruction was done by provocateurs. Such questioning of the legality of existing private property by denouncing landowners as holding land in adverse possession was one of the movement&#x27;s main political tools. The Cutrale plantation, Fazenda S. Henrique, was occupied by the MST four more times until 2013, and the multinational&#x27;s property rights over it are being contested in court by the Federal Government, who alleges that the farm lands were set aside as part of a 1910 settlement projects for foreign immigrants, rights over it going afterward astray during the following century.

During the same period, the MST also repeatedly blocked highways and railroads, to create calls for public attention to the plight of landless workers.

===2010–present===
The MST wholeheartedly declared support for Dilma Rousseff&#x27;s candidacy, and once elected, she offered the movement very qualified support. In a national broadcast in November 2010, she declared land reform a question &quot;of human rights,&quot; that is, a purely humanitarian one. As Lula&#x27;s chief of staff, she supported economic growth over ecological and land reform concerns. In a radio interview during the campaign, she repeated the old conservative trope that economic growth could make Brazilian land issues recede: &quot;What we are doing is doing away with the real basis for the instabilities of the landless. They are losing reasons to fight.&quot; Thus, one author described the MST&#x27;s endorsement of Rousseff as a choice of the &quot;lesser evil.&quot;

State agencies and private individuals continued to violently oppose the movement&#x27;s activities. On 16 February 2012, eighty families were evicted from an occupation in Alagoas of a farm rented to a sugar mill awash in unpaid debts. According to MST activist Janaina Stronzake, MST assumes that landowners have a hit list of MST leaders. Many have in fact been killed, although some murders were doctored to make them look like accidents. In April 2014, a Global Witness report called Brazil &quot;the most dangerous place to defend rights to land and the environment,&quot; with at least 448 people killed between 2002 and 2013 in disputes over environmental rights and access to land. A report for the Catholic Pastoral Land Commission, &quot;Land Conflicts in Brazil 2013&quot;, estimated that land struggles were involved in 34 murders in Brazil in 2013, and 36 in 2012.

On April 16, 2012, a group of MST activists occupied the headquarters of the Ministry of Agrarian Development in Brasília, as part of the movement&#x27;s regular &quot;Red April&quot; campaign, a yearly nationwide occupation initiative in honor of the April 1996 Eldorado dos Carajás massacre. Minister Pepe Vargas declared ongoing talks between the government and the MST suspended for the duration of the occupation.

Land activists were dissatisfied with the slowing pace of official land reform projects under the Rousseff government. Fewer families were officially settled in 2011 than in the previous 16 years. Government reaction to the occupation sparked widespread accusations from the PT base that Rousseff had sold out. In a 2012 interview, Stedile admitted that the movement had not benefited from the policies of the PT administrations, since the coalition governments of the PT could not act politically on behalf of land reform.

Both political pundits and activists thought Rousseff&#x27;s first term was a lean period for land reform, and mainstream media called the MST &quot;tamed&quot; by the two consecutive PT administrations, and drained of mass support by steady economic growth and expanding employment—denying the movement its chief &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot;. In 2013, MST attempted only 110 occupations. The same year saw another low, with only 159 families resettled. MST National Coordinator João Paulo Rodrigues said that the federal government&#x27;s reliance on agribusiness exports for procuring hard currency was the main reason the Rousseff administration did not advance land reform, and even went backwards in some cases. The only recent advances in land reform policies had come in programs, such as the National Program for School Meals (PNAE) and Food Catering Plan (PAA), which purchased food from land reform farmers for use at public schools and other government facilities. However, Rodrigues disputed that such programs were &quot;entirely disproportionate to what [was] being offered [in terms of public money, subsidized credits, etc.] to agribusiness.&quot; He concluded that the only chance for land reform in Brazil would be a kind of joint venture between small producers and urban working class consumers, as simple land redistribution would be fated to fail, as it had in Venezuela, &quot;where Hugo Chávez stockedpiled seven million hectares of nationalized land property which remained unused for want of proper peasants.&quot;

The PT government&#x27;s base generally felt that the vested interest of agribusiness in setting development policies during the Lula and Rousseff administrations hampered aggressive policies of expropriation and land reform.

In November 2014, amid the radicalization surrounding Rousseff&#x27;s reelection, an unannounced visit to Brazil by Venezuelan Minister for Communities and Social Movements Elias Jaua led to an information exchange agreement in agro-ecology between the MST and the Venezuelan government. The visit and agreement created tension among the conservatives in the Brazilian Congress; Senator and landowner Ronaldo Caiado described it as &quot;an arrangement between a high-placed representative of a foreign government and an unlawful entity, aimed at building a socialist society,&quot; and argued for a clearly more conservative stance on land reform, and therefore, less maneuvering room for the MST. The movement described Caiado&#x27;s reaction as evidence that &quot;conservative sectors are hostile to any form of grassroots participation [in the political process].&quot;

In an even clearer sign of limited room, Rousseff chose Kátia Abreu, the notorious female landowner, to be a member of her second-term cabinet. However, some have suggested that the ongoing tension between the MST and the PT, far from signaling an impending end, on the contrary, suggested a &quot;reconfiguration&quot; of the MST, from a single-issue movement to one with a wider focus on political and social emancipation. Since the 1990s, such a tendency has been expressed in the integration of MST with various other grassroots organizations in a network sponsored by progressive Catholics, the CMP (&quot;Central de Movimentos Populares&quot;, or Union of Popular Movements), through which the MST developed its collaboration with its urban &quot;sister&quot; organization, the MTST.

==Land ownership==
Consolidation of land ownership continued unabated. In 2006, according to the property census, the Gini index of land concentration stood at 0.854, while at the beginning of military regime in 1967, it was at 0.836. In other words, concentration of land ownership into just a few hands actually increased. As of 2009, Brazilian economic policy, especially in foreign exchange, relied upon trade surpluses generated by the agricultural exports, so &quot;the correlation of forces moves against agrarian reform.&quot; The resumption of sustained general economic growth in the Lula years might have greatly diminished social demand for land reform, especially among the informally and/or under-employed urban workers, who formed most of the movements&#x27; later membership. In a 2012 interview, a member of the MST national caucus, Joaquim Pinheiro, declared that the recent increase in welfare spending and employment levels had had a &quot;sobering&quot; influence on Brazilian agrarian activism, but he declared himself in favor of government spending on social programs, adding that the MST feared, however, that people would become &quot;hostages&quot; to such programs. But as of 2006, according to the MST, 150,000 families lived in its encampments, compared to 12,805 families in 1990.

==Organizational structure==
The MST is organized entirely, from the grassroots level up to the state and national coordinating bodies, into collective units that make decisions through discussion, reflection, and consensus. This non-hierarchical pattern of organization, reflecting liberation theology and Freirean pedagogy, also avoids distinct leadership that can be bought off or assassinated. The basic organizational unit, 10 to 15 families living in an MST encampment settlement, is known as a &quot;nucleo de base&quot;. A &quot;nucleo de base&quot; addresses the issues faced by member families, and members elect two representatives, one woman and one man, to represent them at settlement/encampment meetings. These representatives attend regional meetings, and elect regional representatives, who then elect the members of the state coordinating body of the MST, a total of 400 members of state bodies—around 20 per state—and 60 members of the national coordinating body, around 2 per state. Every MST family participates in a &quot;nucleo de base&quot;, roughly 475,000 families, or 1.5 million people. João Pedro Stédile, economist and author of texts on land reform in Brazil, is a member of the MST&#x27;s national coordinating body.

The MST is not a political party, and has no formal leadership, other than a dispersed group of some 15 leaders, whose public appearances are scarce. This secrecy minimizes the risk of arrest, and also preserves a grassroots, decentralized organizational model. This is regarded as an important strategy by the MST, in that it allows the movement to maintain an ongoing and direct flow of communication between member-families and their representatives. Coordinators are aware of the realities faced by member-families, and are encouraged to discuss important issues with said families. This organizational blueprint seeks, in a way, to empower people politically by having them acting &quot;in the way they see fit, true to local context.&quot; To assist with communication between Coordinators and member-families, and as an attempt to democratize the media, the MST produces the &quot;Jornal Sem Terra&quot; and the &quot;MST Informa&quot;.

The structure and goals of the MST has led some authors to consider it a large libertarian socialist, anarchist, or autonomist Marxist organization.

==Ideology==
The MST is an ideologically eclectic rural movement of hundreds of thousands of landless peasants (and some who live in small cities), striving for land reform in Brazil. Since its inception, the MST has been inspired by liberation theology, Marxism, the Cuban Revolution, and other leftist ideologies. The flexible mix of discourse that includes &quot;marxist concepts, popular religion, communal practices, citizenship principles, and radical democracy&quot; has increased the movement&#x27;s popular appeal. The radical democratic and anti-hierarchical structure and goals of the MST have led some authors to consider it a large libertarian socialist, anarchist, or autonomist Marxist organization.

The landless say they have found institutional support in the Catholic Church&#x27;s teachings of social justice and equality, as embodied in the activities of Catholic Base Committees (&quot;Comissões Eclesiais de Base&quot;, or CEBs), which generally advocate liberation theology and anti-hierarchical social relations. This theology, a radicalized re-reading of the existing social doctrine of the Church, became the basis of the MST&#x27;s ideology and organizational structure. The loss of influence of progressives in the later Catholic Church, however, has reduced the closeness of the relationship between the MST and the Church, as such.

MST&#x27;s anti-hierarchical stance stems from the influence of Paulo Freire. After working with poor communities in the rural Brazilian state of Pernambuco, Freire observed that aspects of traditional classrooms, such as teachers with more power than students, hindered the potential for success of adults in adult literacy programs. He determined that the students&#x27; individual abilities to learn and absorb information were severely impeded by their passive role in the classroom. His teachings encouraged activists to break their passive dependence on oppressive social conditions, and become engaged in active modes of behaving and living. In the mid-1980s, the MST created a new infrastructure for the movement, directly guided by liberation theology and Freirian pedagogy. They did not elect leaders, so as to not create hierarchies, and to prevent corrupt leadership from developing.

The MST has widened the scope of their movement. They have invaded the headquarters of public and multinational institutions, and begun to resist the appearance of fields of genetically modified crops, carrying out marches, hunger strikes, and other political actions. The MST cooperates with a number of urban and rural worker movements in other areas of Brazil. The MST also remains in touch with broader international organizations and movements that support and embrace the same cause. The MST includes not only landless workers &quot;stricto sensu&quot;, or rural workers recently evicted from the land, but also the urban jobless and homeless people who want to make a living by working on the land; thus, its affinity with housing reform and other urban movements. The squatters&#x27; movement MTST (&quot;Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem teto&quot; - Homeless Workers&#x27; Movement) is commonly seen as an offshoot of the MST.

=== Liberation Theology and &quot;Mística&quot; ===
As mentioned above, the MST draws ideological inspiration from many conceptual frameworks, both religious and political, with one aspect of this inspiration being the practice of &quot;mística.&quot; Mística refers to performance or dance conducted in ceremony-like conditions, often with nonverbal components, and carried out with the intention of affirming confidence in desired goals or action. With this in mind, mística can be considered a form of mysticism that exists within a distinctly Latin American context. With regards to the MST, this form of mística underwent a series of changes prior to becoming fully adopted by the organisation as part of its methods and practices. Christian mysticism is often an individual experience, rather than collective and communal, and consequently, the form of mística practiced by the MST differs chiefly in this regard. It is a communal experience (often linked keenly with the emergence of CEBs) that often sees participation from the assembled group, rather than an individual, and this change was brought about by the influence of liberation theology on the MST in the late sixties.

Additionally, as historian Daniela Issa notes, mística is a process by which communities associated with the MST can narrate their own history by reviving a collective memory of the oppressed, often in contexts where censorship and state violence are commonplace. The form of mística associated with the MST also draws on a variety of cultures and origins, with roots in Catholic ritualism, as well as Afro-Brazilian religious practices that had first been introduced after the migration of slavery into Brazil in the 16th century. Not only this, but some contemporary historians have also identified aspects of the MST mística as having originated from Indigenous practices and belief systems. One example of recent demonstrations of mística within the MST is found in the practices of the ceremony at the ten year anniversary of the Eldorado do Carajás massacre. Members engaging in mística carried effigies of the bodies, while singing and chanting, as they converged on a location that symbolised the site of the event.

The MST highly value education, and the organisation is committed to the teachings of Freirian pedagogy, which espouses the process of conscientisation. This commitment to community education forms another aspect of the group&#x27;s mixture of influences. Popular education and liberation theology are closely linked with the practice of mística within the MST, as CEB&#x27;s, and the sense of community generated by popular education often form the site of mística—with many members having overlapping interests and participation in each aspect. Such settlements and communities produced by the encampments of the MST actively encourage and sponsor the practice of mística within CEB&#x27;s present, as a method of reaffirming commitment and dedication to the goals of the group, these goals often being exclusively linked to the political ambitions and campaigns at the time of practice.

=== Ideological foundations of MST&#x27;s later activism===

The supposed opposition to capitalist modernity on the part of the movement has led authors to ascertain that the MST activities express, in a way, the &quot;decline&quot; of a traditional peasantry, and its desire of &quot;restoring&quot; traditional communal rights. This is what differentiates between the MST and a movement for the &quot;preservation&quot; of communal rights, such as the Zapatista Army of National Liberation.

However, there are others who assert that instead of expressing the &quot;decline&quot; of the peasantry, the MST, developing as it was in Brazil, a country where agriculture has been tied to commodity production since colonial times, expresses the &quot;absence&quot; of a proper peasantry, and has, as its social basis, a rural working class that strives to gain a foothold in the field of capitalist production. As remarked by non-specialist foreign onlookers, the MST&#x27;s tagging of the landless as &quot;rural workers&quot;—i.e. proletarians, in the Marxist sense—appears sometimes more as a purely ideological branding than anything else.

According even to a Leftist scholar like James Petras, the MST is undoubtedly a &quot;modernizing&quot; social movement, in that its main goal is to convert fallow states into viable units that are able to produce a marketable surplus—&quot;to occupy, resist, and &quot;produce,&quot;&quot; as the movement&#x27;s own motto goes. It is also not a movement with a clear-cut anti-capitalist stance, as what it seeks is to &quot;create a land reform based on small individual property-owners.&quot; As far as its steads are concerned, the movement has adopted a mostly private enterprise-friendly stance: with the monies it has procured, it has financed mechanization, processing enterprises, livestock breeding, as well as granting access to additional credit sources. Some even see the movement&#x27;s aims as &quot;quite limited,&quot; as in practice, it tends to merely provide a chance for some people &quot;to interact with the [ruling] capitalist economy&quot; by means of a kind of &quot;guerrilla capitalism,&quot; aimed at ensuring that smaller producers&#x27; associations carve a share of the market for agrarian produce against the competition of mammoth agribusiness trusts.

In the view of Marxist authors, like Petras and Veltmeyer, such a stance would reflect the incapacity of a heterogeneous coalition of rural people to engage in a broad, anti-systemic coalition, which would include the urban working classes. Shunning this Marxist paradigm, other authors see in the rhetoric of the MST the reflection of an ideological struggle, not for taking power, but for &quot;recognizance&quot;, for &quot;reconstituting the diversity of rural Brazil&quot;. This struggle for recognizance - despite its being couched in fiery radical rhetoric - is seen by some as &quot;indeed relevant for the democratization of &#x27;rural society&#x27;, but [it does] not entail political motivations destined to promote ruptures&quot;. In even more blunt terms, a recent academic paper asserts that the ideology of the MST, connected as it is in practice with the landlesss&#x27; concrete needs for making out a living in the countryside, is above all an &quot;edible&quot; ideology. A recent German handbook describes the MST as a mere &quot;pressure group&quot;, unable to exert actual political power. Other authors, however, maintain that the interest of the MST in maximize its members&#x27; everyday participation in the running of their own affairs is enough to describe the movement as &quot;socialist&quot; in a broad sense.

==Education==
According to the MST, it taught over 50,000 landless workers to read and write between 2002 and 2005. It also runs the Popular University of Social Movements (PUSM) at a campus in Guararema, São Paulo. Also called Florestan Fernandes School (FFS), after Marxist scholar Florestan Fernandes, the school offers secondary school classes in a variety of fields; its first graduating class (2005) of 53 students received degrees in Specialized Rural Education and Development. With the University of Brasília, the government of Venezuela and the NGO Via Campesina, as well as agreements with federal, state and community colleges, it offers classes in pedagogy, history, and agronomy, and technical subjects at different skill levels. The building was constructed with by brigades of volunteers using soil cement bricks made onsite at the school. The late Oscar Niemeyer designed an auditorium and further sustainable, low environmental impact expansion of the school complex is pending.

The MST formed its education sector in Rio Grande do Sul in 1986, a year after its first national convention. By 2001, about 150,000 children attended 1,200 primary and secondary schools in its settlements and camps. The schools employ 3,800 teachers, many of them MST-trained. The movement has trained 1,200 educators, who run classes for 25,000 young people and adults. It trains primary-school teachers in most states of Brazil, and partners with international agencies such as UNESCO, UNICEF and the Catholic Church. Seven institutions of higher education in different regions provide degree courses in education for MST teachers. Some call MST communal schools markedly better than their conventional counterparts in rural communities, in both quantitative and qualitative terms.

==Media coverage==
The role of the MST as a grassroots organization running charter schools activity has attracted considerable attention from the Brazilian press, much of it accusatory. &quot;Veja&quot;, Brazil&#x27;s largest magazine, known for unrestrained hostility to social movements in general published a profile of two MST schools in Rio Grande do Sul and said the MST was &quot;indoctrinating&quot; children between 7 and 14. Children were also shown what the article called propaganda films, which taught that genetically modified (GMO) products contain &quot;poison&quot;, and were advised not to eat margarine that might contain GMO soybean. The Brazilian authorities allegedly had no control over MST schools, and according to the profile they did not follow the mandatory national curriculum set out by the Ministry of Education, which calls for &quot;pluralism of ideas&quot; and &quot;tolerance&quot;. &quot;Preaching&quot; &quot;Marxism&quot; in MST schools was analogous to preaching radical Islam tenets in madrassas, the article said.

This was just one episode in a long history of mutual very bitter animosity between &quot;Veja&quot; and the MST. In 1993, the magazine described the MST as &quot;a peasant organization of Leninist character&quot; and charged its leaders and activists with pretending to be homeless. In February 2009 the magazine opposed public support for the &quot;criminal&quot; activities of the movement and the MST charged the magazine a year later with &quot;vandalizing&quot; both journalism and the truth itself. In 2011, a mention of the MST in &quot;Veja&quot; called it &quot;a criminal mob&quot;. In early 2014, after MST tried to invade the STF building, a &quot;Veja&quot; columnist described said it was &quot;playing leader to a non-existing cause&quot;. This journalistic mud-slinging has justified at least two academic monographs wholly dedicated to it alone.

Overall the relationship of the mainstream media with the MST has been ambiguous: in the 1990s they tended to support land reform as a goal in general, and presented MST in a sympathetic light. For example, between 1996 and 1997 TV Globo broadcast a &quot;telenovela&quot; &quot;O Rei do Gado&quot; (The Cattle Baron), in which a beautiful female &quot;sem terra&quot; played by actress Patricia Pillar falls in love with a male landowner. In the same &quot;telenovela&quot;, a wake for the fictitious Senator Caxias, killed while defending an MST occupation, offered the opportunity for two real-life senators from the PT, Eduardo Suplicy and Benedita da Silva, to make cameo appearances as themselves praising their fictive colleague&#x27;s agenda.

The media however tend to disavow what they see as violent methods, especially as the movement gathered strength. It does not outright disavow the movement&#x27;s struggle for land reform, but Brazilian media moralize: &quot;to deplore the invasion of productive land, the MST&#x27;s irrationality and lack of responsibility, the ill-using of distributed land parcels and to argue for the existence of alternate peaceful solutions&quot;.

==Sustainable agriculture==
The increased importance of the technicians and experts within the MST has led some sections of the movement to strive to develop and diffuse technology suitable for a model of sustainable agriculture on the land the families farm. Such self-developed technology is seen as a way to turn small producers from consumers into producers of technologies, - and therefore as a hedge against small producers&#x27; dependence on chemical inputs and single-crop price fluctuations and a way to preserving natural resources. These efforts are gaining in importance as more movement families gain access to the land. For example, the Chico Mendes Center for Agroecology, founded May 15, 2004 in Ponta Grossa, Paraná, Brazil on land formerly used by the Monsanto Company to grow genetically modified crops, intends to produce organic, native seed to distribute through MST. Various other experiments in reforestation, taming of native species and medicinal uses of plans have been carried out in MST settlements. The MST is the largest producer of organic rice in Latin America.

In 2005, the MST partnered with the federal government of Venezuela, and the state government of Paraná, the Federal University of Paraná (UFPR), and the International Via Campesina, an organization that brings together movements involved in the struggle for land from all over the world, to establish the Latin American School of Agroecology. The school, located in an MST agrarian reform project known as the Contestado settlement, signed a protocol of intentions in January during the fifth World Social Forum.

<text>The 10th World Championships in Athletics (, ), under the auspices of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), were held in the Olympic Stadium, Helsinki, Finland (6 August 2005 – 14 August 2005), the site of the first IAAF World Championships in 1983. One theme of the 2005 championships was paralympic events, some of which were included as exhibition events. Much of the event was played in extremely heavy rainfall.

==Background==

===Bidding===
The original winning bid for the competition was for London but the cost to build the required stadium at Picketts Lock and host the event was deemed too expensive by the government. UK Athletics suggested to move the host city to Sheffield (using Don Valley Stadium), but the IAAF stated that having London as the host city was central to their winning the bid. The championships bidding process was reopened as a result. The United Kingdom&#x27;s withdrawal as host was the first case for a major sporting event in a developed country since Denver&#x27;s withdrawal as host of the 1976 Winter Olympics.

Helsinki was considered by many to be the outsider in the race to host the games with rival bids being presented by Berlin in Germany; Brussels in Belgium, Budapest in Hungary, Moscow in Russia and Rome in Italy.

===Opening ceremony===
Apocalyptica and Nightwish performed at the opening ceremony of the event over a heavy rainfall. Geir Rönning, Finland&#x27;s Eurovision Song Contest 2005 entrant, sang &quot;Victory&quot; the official song of the 2005 IAAF World Championships.

===Events===
With the addition of the women&#x27;s 3000 metres steeplechase to the schedule, that year&#x27;s program of events was closer to parity for women and men. With the exception of the 50 km walk the women competed in practically the same events as the men. Two differences remaining from before, though, were the short hurdles race (100 metres for women vs. 110 metres for men), and the multi-event competition (heptathlon for women vs. decathlon for men).

Since the first World Championships in Helsinki 1983, seven new events have been added for women:

* 10000 metres, introduced in 1987
* 5000 metres, replaced 3000 metres in 1995
* triple jump, introduced in 1993
* 20 km walk introduced in 1999, replaced 10 km walk that first appeared in 1987
* pole vault, introduced in 1999
* hammer throw, introduced in 1999
* 3000 metres steeplechase, introduced in 2005

==Drug testing==
The IAAF conducted their largest ever anti-doping program at an athletics event for the championships, with 705 athletes subjected to a total 884 of tests. There were two athletes who failed drugs tests: Indian discus thrower Neelam Jaswant Singh tested positive for the stimulant pemoline, and Vladyslav Piskunov, a Ukrainian hammer thrower, tested positive for the steroid drostanolone. Singh received a two-year ineligibility ban, while Piskunov received a life ban from athletics as this was his second offence.

In March 2013, the IAAF announced that re-testing of samples taken during these championships revealed that five medal winners had proved positive for banned substances. The athletes involved were Belarusian Nadzeya Ostapchuk (shot put gold), Belarusian Ivan Tsikhan (hammer throw gold), Russian Olga Kuzenkova (hammer throw gold), Russian Tatyana Kotova (long jump silver) and Belarus&#x27;s Vadim Devyatovskiy (men&#x27;s hammer silver). Belarusian Andrei Mikhnevich (shot put 6th) had also tested positive and was disqualified.

<doc id="806018" wikidata="Q69770" url="?curid=806018" title="Daniel Ernst Jablonski">
<text>Daniel Ernst Jablonski (20 November 1660, Mokry Dwór (Nassenhuben), Royal Prussia, Crown of Poland25 May 1741, Berlin) was
a German theologian and reformer of Czech origin, known for his efforts to bring about a union between Lutheran and Calvinist Protestants.

==Life==
Jablonski was born in the village of Nassenhuben, near Danzig (Gdańsk). His father, Peter Figulus, was a minister of Unity of the Brethren (; – also known as &quot;Bohemian Brethren&quot;); the son preferred the Bohemian surname Jablonski (Jablonský) which was based on his father&#x27;s birthplace – Jablonné nad Orlicí. He was the younger brother of Johann Theodor Jablonski. His maternal grandfather, Johann Amos Comenius (d. 1670), was the last bishop of the Unity. Having studied at Frankfurt (Oder) and at Oxford, Jablonski entered upon his career as a preacher at Magdeburg in 1683, and then from 1686 to 1691 he was the head of the Brethren college at Polish Leszno (), a position which had been filled by his grandfather. Consecrated a bishop of the Unity for the churches in Poland, he was encouraged by the Elector Friedrich Wilhelm I of Brandenburg, King in Prussia, to secure the Apostolic Succession to the Renewed Unity of Brethren, the Moravian Church, and consecrated David Nitschmann bishop in Berlin in 1735.

Still retaining his connection with the Bohemians, he was appointed court preacher at Königsberg in 1691 by the elector of Brandenburg, Frederick III, and here, entering upon a career of great activity, he soon became a person of influence in court circles. In 1693 he was transferred to Berlin as court preacher, and in 1699 he was consecrated a bishop of the Unity of the Brethren.

At Berlin Jablonski worked hard to bring about a union between the followers of Luther and those of Calvin; the courts of Berlin, Hanover, Brunswick and Gotha were interested in his scheme, and his principal helper was the philosopher Gottfried Leibniz. His idea appears to have been to form a general union between the German, the English and the Swiss Protestants, and thus to establish &quot;una eademque sancta catholica et apostolica eademque evangelica et reformata ecclesia&quot; (&quot;the one and selfsame holy, catholic, and apostholic and selfsame evangelical and reformed Church&quot;). For some years negotiations were carried on with a view to attaining this end, but eventually it was found impossible to surmount the many difficulties in the way; Jablonski and Leibniz, however, did not cease to believe in the possibility of accomplishing their purpose. Jablonski&#x27;s next plan was to reform the Church of Prussia by introducing into it the episcopate, and also the liturgy of the Church of England, but here again he was unsuccessful.

==Academic achievements==
As a scholar, Jablonski brought out a Hebrew edition of the Old Testament, and translated Bentley&#x27;s &quot;A Confutation of Atheism&quot; into Latin (1696). He had some share in founding the &quot;Brandenburgische Societät der Wissenschaften&quot;. Between 1700 and 1731 he became secretary of the Academy and vice president in 1710, 1715, 1719, 1723, 1727, 1729, 1731 and 1733. Between 1710 and 1731 Jablonski was director of the Philology and Oriental Studies at the Academy. Between 1733 and 1741 was president of the Academy. He received a degree from the university of Oxford.

<text>Peter Kowald (21 April 1944 – 21 September 2002) was a German free jazz and free improvising double bassist and tubist.

==Career==
A member of the Globe Unity Orchestra, and a touring double-bass player, Kowald collaborated with many European free jazz and American free-jazz players during his career, including Peter Brötzmann, Irène Schweizer, Karl Berger, Fred Anderson, Hamid Drake, Karl E. H. Seigfried, Conny Bauer, Jeffrey Morgan, Wadada Leo Smith, Günter Sommer, William Parker, Barre Phillips, Joëlle Léandre, Alfred Harth, Lauren Newton and Evan Parker. He also recorded a number of solo double-bass albums, and was a member of the London Jazz Composer&#x27;s Orchestra until 1985. He also recorded a number of pioneering double bass duets with Maarten Altena, Barry Guy, Joëlle Léandre, Barre Phillips, William Parker, Damon Smith and Peter Jacquemyn.

In addition, Kowald collaborated extensively with poets and artists and with the dancers Gerlinde Lambeck, Anne Martin (formerly of Pina Bausch Ensemble), Tadashi Endo, Patricia Parker (founder of the Vision Festival), Maria Mitchell, Sally Silvers, Cheryl Banks (formerly of Sun Ra&#x27;s Arkestra), Arnette de Mille, Sayonara Pereira, and Kazuo Ohno. Specific works included &quot;Die Klage der Kaiserin&quot; (1989) with Pina Bausch, short pieces (since 1989) with Jean Sasportes, &quot;The spirit of adventure&quot; (1990) with Anastasia Lyra, &quot;Wasser in der Hand&quot; (1990/91) with Christine Brunel, and &quot;Futan no sentaku&quot;/&quot;The burden of choice&quot; (1990/91) with Min Tanaka and Butch Morris.

Besides his duo work with singers such as Jeanne Lee, Diamanda Galás, Anna Homler or Sainkho Namtchylak, Peter was especially interested in his international improvising ensemble Global Village with musicians from different cultural regions of the world: China, Japan, Near East, South Europe, North and South America.

He died of a heart attack in New York City in 2002.

<doc id="806023" wikidata="Q752118" url="?curid=806023" title="Sympathy">
<text>Sympathy is the perception of, understanding of, and reaction to the distress or need of another life form.

According to philosopher David Hume, this sympathetic concern is driven by a switch in viewpoint from a personal perspective to the perspective of another group or individual who is in need. Hume explained that this is the case because &quot;the minds of all men are similar in their feelings and operations&quot; and that &quot;the motion of one communicates itself to the rest&quot; so that as &quot;affections readily pass from one person to another… they beget correspondent movements.&quot;

Along with Hume, two other men, Adam Smith and Arthur Schopenhauer, worked to better define sympathy. Hume was mostly known for epistemology, Smith was known for his economic theory, and Schopenhauer for the philosophy of the will.

American professor Brené Brown views sympathy as a way to stay out of touch with one&#x27;s emotions. They attempt to make sense out of the situation and see it from the person receiving the sympathy&#x27;s perception.

==Etymology==
The roots of the word &quot;sympathy&quot; are the Greek words , which means &quot;together&quot;, and , which refers to feeling or emotion. See &quot;&quot; for more information.

==Distinctions between sympathy and related concepts==
The related word &quot;empathy&quot; is often used interchangeably with &quot;sympathy&quot;. Empathy more precisely means that one is able to feel another&#x27;s feelings. Compassion and pity are also related concepts.

==Causes==
Prerequisites for feeling sympathy include: attention to a subject, believing that a subject is in a state of need, and understanding the context of what is occurring in a subject&#x27;s life. To feel sympathy for a person or group, you must first pay attention to them. When one is distracted, this severely limits one&#x27;s ability to produce strong affective responses. When not distracted, people can attend to and respond to a variety of emotional subjects and experiences.

The perceived need of an individual/group elicits sympathy. Different states of need (such as perceived vulnerability or pain) call for different sorts of reactions, including those that range from attention to sympathy. For example, a person with cancer might draw a stronger feeling of sympathy than a person with a cold. Depending on the circumstance of the subject, the way that sympathy is expressed can vary because of the given situation. Gestures of sympathy may also be seen as a social response to a crisis.

Opinions about human deservingness, interdependence, and vulnerability motivate sympathy. A person who seems &quot;deserving&quot; of aid is more likely to be helped. A belief in human interdependence fuels sympathetic behavior.

Sympathy is also believed to be based on the principle of the powerful helping the vulnerable (young, elderly, sick). This desire to help the vulnerable has been suggested by the American Psychological Association, among others, to stem from paternalistic motives to protect and aid children and the weak. In this theory, people help other people in general by generalizing the maternal as well as the paternal instincts to care for their own children or family.

Moods, previous experiences, social connections, novelty, salience, and spatial proximity also influence the experience of sympathy. People experiencing positive mood states and people who have similar life experiences are more likely to express sympathy to those who are being sympathized with.

People in spatial or geographic proximity (such as neighbors and citizens of a given country) are more likely to experience sympathy towards each other. &quot;Social&quot; proximity follows the same pattern: Members of certain groups (e.g. racial groups) are more sympathetic to people who are also members of the group. Social proximity is linked with in-group/out-group status. People within the same group are interconnected and share successes and failures and therefore experience more sympathy towards each other than to out-group members, or social outsiders.

New and emotionally provoking situations also heighten empathic emotions, such as sympathy. People seem to habituate to events that are similar in content and type and strength of emotion. The first horrific event that is witnessed will elicit a greater sympathetic response compared to the subsequent experiences of the same horrific event.

==Evolutionary origins==
The evolution of sympathy is tied to the development of social intelligence: a broad range of behaviors and their associated cognitive skills, such as pair bonding, the creation of social hierarchies, and alliance formation. Researchers theorize that empathic emotions, or those relating to the emotions of others, arose due to reciprocal altruism, mother–child bonding, and the need to accurately estimate the future actions of conspecifics. Empathic emotions emerged from the need to create relationships that were mutually beneficial and to better understand the emotions of others that could avert danger or stimulate positive outcomes.

Small groups of socially dependent individuals may develop empathic concerns, and later sympathy, if certain prerequisites are met. The people in this community must have a long enough lifespan to encounter several opportunities to react with sympathy. Parental care relationships, alliances during conflicts, and the creation of social hierarchies are associated with the onset of sympathy in human interactions. Sympathetic behavior originally came about during dangerous situations, such as predator sightings, and moments when aid was needed for the sick and/or wounded. The evolution of sympathy as a social catalyst can be seen in both other primate species and in human development.

==Communication==
Verbal communication is one way individuals communicate feelings of sympathy. People can express sympathy by addressing the emotions being felt by themselves and others involved and by acknowledging the current environmental conditions for why sympathy is the appropriate reaction.

Nonverbal communication includes speech intonation, facial expression, body motions, person-to-person physical contact, nonverbal vocal behavior, how far people position themselves in relation to each other, posture, and appearance. Such forms of expression can convey messages related to emotion as well as opinions, physical states (e.g. fatigue), and understanding. People produce emotion-specific facial expressions that are often the same from culture to culture and are often reproduced by observers, which facilitates the observers&#x27; own understandings of the emotion and/or situation. There are six universal emotions: happiness, sadness, fear, surprise, disgust, and anger.

Nonverbal communication cues are often subconscious and difficult to control. Deliberate regulation of emotion and nonverbal expression is often imperfect. Nonverbal gestures and facial expressions are also generally better understood by observers than by the person experiencing them first-hand.

Communicating using physical touch has the unique ability to convey affective information upon contact. The interpretation of this information is context-sensitive. The touch of the hand on the shoulder during a funeral might be the fastest method of conveying sympathy. Patting a person on their back, arms, or head for a few seconds can effectively convey feelings of sympathy between people. Nonverbal communication seems to provide a more genuine communication of sympathy, because it is difficult to control nonverbal expressions and therefore difficult to be deliberately insincere in that medium. The combination of verbal and nonverbal communication facilitates the acknowledgment and comprehension of sympathy.

==Human behavior==
People make decisions by weighing costs against potential outcomes. Research on decision-making distinguishes two mechanisms, often labeled &quot;System 1&quot; (or &quot;gut&quot;) and &quot;System 2&quot; (or &quot;head&quot;). System 1 uses affective cues to dictate decisions, whereas System 2 is based in logic and reason. For example, deciding on where to live based on how the new home feels would be a System 1 decision, whereas deciding based on the property value and personal savings would be a System 2 decision.

Sympathy is a System 1 agent. It provides a means of understanding another person&#x27;s experience or situation, good or bad, with a focus on their well-being. It is often easier to make decisions based on emotional information, because all people have general understanding of emotions. It is this understanding of emotions that allows people to use sympathy to make their decisions.

Sympathy helps to motivate philanthropic, or aid-giving, behavior such as donations or community service. The choice to donate, and the subsequent decision of how much to give, can be separated into two emotion-driven decision-making processes: Mood management, or how people act to maintain their moods, influences the initial decision to donate because of selfish concerns (to avoid regret or feel better). However, how a person feels about the deservingness of the recipient determines &quot;how much&quot; to donate. Human sympathy in donation behavior can influence the amount of aid given to people and regions that are in need. Increasing how emotional a description is, presenting individual cases instead of large groups, and using less information and numerical data can positively influence giving behavior.

Sympathy also plays a role in maintaining social order. Judging people&#x27;s character helps to maintain social order, making sure that those who are in need receive the appropriate care. The notion of interdependence fuels sympathetic behavior; such behavior is self-satisfying because helping someone who is connected to you through some way (family, social capital) often results in a personal reward (social, monetary, etc.). Regardless of selflessness or selfishness, sympathy facilitates the cycle of give and take that is necessary for maintaining a functional society.

==Healthcare==
Sympathy impacts how doctors, nurses, and other members of society think about and treat people with different diseases and conditions. The level of sympathy exhibited by health care providers corresponds to patient characteristics and disease type. One factor that influences sympathy is controllability: the degree to which the afflicted individual could have avoided contracting the disease or medical condition. For example, people express less sympathy toward individuals who had control during the event when they acquired HIV. Homosexual men and prostitute women who have contracted HIV or AIDS are unlikely to receive as much sympathy as heterosexual men and women who contract HIV or AIDS.

Sympathy in health-related decision-making is heavily influenced by disease stigma. Disease stigma can lead to discrimination in the workplace and in insurance coverage. High levels of stigma are also associated with social hostility. Several factors contribute to the development of disease stigmas, including the disease&#x27;s time course, severity, and the dangers that the disease might pose to others. Sexual orientation of individual patients has also been shown to affect stigma levels in the case of HIV diagnoses. Sympathy is associated with low levels of disease stigma.

Sympathy for HIV patients increased levels of knowledge regarding HIV and a lower likelihood of avoiding individuals with HIV.

==Neuroscience perspectives==
Social and emotional stimuli that relate to the well-being of another person can be studied with technology that tracks brain activity (such as Electroencephalograms and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging). Amygdala and insula activation occur when a person experiences emotions, such as fear and disgust respectively. Primary motor regions also activate during sympathy. This could be caused by empathic motor reactions to emotional faces (reflecting the expressions on their own faces) which seem to help people better understand the other person&#x27;s emotion. Researchers also suggest that the neural mechanisms that are activated when personally experiencing emotions are also activated when viewing another person experiencing the same emotions (via mirror neurons). Pain seems to activate a region known as the cingulate cortex, in addition to the activation of the neural mechanisms mentioned earlier. The temporal parietal junction, orbitofrontal cortex, and ventral striatum are also thought to play a role in the production of emotion.

Generally, empathic emotions (including sympathy) require the activation of top-down and bottom-up activity. Top-down activity refers to cognitive processes that originate from the frontal lobe and require conscious thought whereas bottom-up activity begins from a sensation of stimuli in the environment. From that sensory level, people sense and experience the emotional cues of another. At the same time, top-down responses make sense of the emotional inputs streaming in and apply motive and environmental influence analyses to better understand the situation. Top-down processes include attention to emotion and emotion regulation.

==Child development==
Sympathy is a stage in social and moral development. It typically arises when a child is between two and three years old, although some instances of empathic emotion can be seen as early as 18 months. Basic sharing of emotions, a precursor for sympathy, can be seen in infants. For example, babies will often begin to cry when they hear another baby crying nearby. This suggests the infant can recognize emotional cues in its environment, even if it cannot fully comprehend the emotion. Another milestone in child development is the ability to mimic facial expressions. Both of these processes act on sensory and perceptual pathways; executive functioning for empathic emotions does not begin during these early stages. Because of this, children and young adults experience another person&#x27;s pain differently: Young children tend to be negatively aroused more often in comparison to the older subjects.

Sympathy can elicit prosocial and altruistic behaviour. Altruistic behaviour happens when people who experience emotional reactions consistent with the state of another person feel &quot;other-oriented&quot; (inclined to help other people in need or distressed).

People are more inclined to help those in need when they cannot easily escape the situation. If exit is easy, an individual may instead reduce their own distress (distress caused by sympathy: feeling bad for the other) by avoiding contact with the other(s) in need. However sympathy is still experienced when it is easy to escape the situation, suggesting that humans are &quot;other oriented&quot; and altruistic.

Sympathy can be used in altruistic situations. This can apply when the sympathy would benefit . This can be the case in parenting. Parenting styles (specifically, the level of affection) can influence the development of sympathy.

Prosocial and moral development extends into adolescence and early adulthood as humans learn to better assess and interpret the emotions of others. Prosocial behaviours have been observed in children between one and two years old. It is difficult to measure emotional responses in children that young by means of self-report methods as they are not as able to articulate such responses as well as adults can.

===Theory of mind===
The development of theory of mind—the ability to view the world from perspectives of other people—is correlated with the development of sympathy and other complex emotions. These emotions are called &quot;complex&quot; because they involve more than just one&#x27;s own emotional states; complex emotions involve the interplay of multiple people&#x27;s varying and fluctuating thoughts and emotions within given contexts. The ability to experience vicarious emotion, or to imagine how another person feels, is essential for empathic concern. Moral development is similarly tied to the understanding of outside perspectives and emotions. Moral reasoning has been divided into five categories, beginning with a hedonistic self-orientation and ending with an internalized sense of needs of others, including empathic emotions.

===Innate feature===
One study sought to determine whether sympathy demonstrated by children was solely for personal benefit, or if the emotion was an innate part of development. Parents, teachers, and 1,300 children (aged six and seven) were interviewed regarding each child&#x27;s behavior. Over the course of one year, questionnaires were filled out regarding the progress and behavior of each child. This was followed by an interview. The study concluded that children develop sympathy and empathy independently of parental guidance. The study also found that girls are more sympathetic, prosocial, and morally motivated than boys. Prosocial behavior has been noted in children as young as twelve months when showing and giving toys to their parents, without promoting or being reinforced by praise.

<text>Castlemilk () is a district of Glasgow, Scotland. It lies to the far south of the city centre, adjacent to the Croftfoot and Simshill residential areas within the city to the north-west, the town of Rutherglen - neighbourhoods of Spittal to the north-east and Fernhill to the east, Linn Park and its golf course to the west, and the separate village of Carmunnock further south across countryside.

The area was developed by the Glasgow Corporation as a peripheral housing scheme in the 1950s to accommodate 34,000 people from inner-city slum areas such as the Gorbals. The new residents were provided with open spaces, a clean environment and indoor toilets and bathrooms. The modern development grew around Castlemilk House, a stately old mansion built around Cassilton Tower, which was started in 1460 on the site of a 13th-century castle, and was demolished in 1972.

The population had dropped from 37,000 in 1971 to roughly half that number in 1991. However, despite the social problems associated with poverty and unemployment, the area has seen the benefits of a regeneration strategy implemented in the 1980s which has focused on improved housing and the development of local arts. Community groups and Cooperative housing associations have done a lot to regenerate the housing and improve the amenities for local people. A swimming pool, sports centre, shopping arcade and community centres have been developed.

==History==
===Early history===
According to &quot;The Incomplete History Of Castlemilk&quot;, by the Castlemilk History Group, Carmunnock did not escape the religious turbulence of the years following Mary Queen of Scots&#x27; flight to and later imprisonment in England. While Carmunnock church remained with the Established Church, several of its ministers fought for the National Covenant. The Rev James Mowbrae was dismissed in 1639; his successor Rev Matthew McKail was transferred to Bothwell in 1649, while Rev Andrew Morton was also dismissed for non-conformity in 1662. Rev Morton was to return in 1687 upon the decline of the rule of bishops. According to Mrs Herbert (Author of the History of Carmunnock), &#x27;The villagers, joyfully taking the opportunity, forcibly threw the unpopular Rev Mr Boyd out of the manse&#x27;.

Over this period the Stuarts added to their estate. Again confusion surrounds the date in history of the Stuart connection with Cassiltoun. According to some sources, the Stuarts sold their Dumfriesshire estate of Castlemilk to Lord Maxwell in 1579, and from that date the Lanarkshire property of Cassiltoun became known as Castlemilk. Other sources give the date of this development as 1759. Certainly in writing up his Statistical Account of the parish in 1796 the Rev Adam Forman seemed comfortable in his use of the term Castlemilk for the former estate of Cassiltoun.

This period saw further additions to the Stuart fortunes through their links with the parish of Torrance and the estate of Milton. Torrance House (in present-day Calderglen Park, East Kilbride) was built in 1605 and sold to the Stuarts of Castlemilk in 1650. It remained with the Stuarts until 1947, when it was acquired by the East Kilbride Development Corporation as their Headquarters. During the 18th Century, the valuable estate of Milton on the north side of Glasgow came by marriage into the possession of the family. It included a large area north of Cowcaddens and Parliamentary Road, Hyndland, Barmulloch and Balornock, besides the site of the present large housing scheme of Milton. In 1706 a deed of entail was obtained, obliging every future holder of the Milton estate to assume the name of Crawfurd.

This fact, coupled with inter-marriage with the Stirlings of Keir and the failure of the Stuart male line in 1797 explains the present family name of Crawfurd Stirling Stuart. This complex family history was explored by Andrew Stuart of Torrance and Castlemilk who published &quot;The History of the Genealogy of the Stewarts&quot; in 1798.

In 1991, in advance of the redevelopment of the site of Castlemilk House into an adventure playground, an archaeological dig was carried out by Archaeology Projects Glasgow in close collaboration with the now defunct Castlemilk Local History Group.
Two trial trenches to the west of the tower discovered a defensive ditch which had been filled with midden material such as pottery, bone, bottle glass and a clay pipe bowl that would date the deposit to the 18th century if not earlier.
The remains of a stone structure which could have been a possible bridge was also uncovered running across the line of the ditch. Other trial trenches produced very little of interest.

===Development of modern estate===
Castlemilk and the other peripheral housing schemes in Glasgow had their origins in the city&#x27;s housing crisis after the end of the Second World War. Many inner city areas such as Hutchesontown contained street after street of sub-standard tenement housing, and the city as a whole had a shortage of affordable good quality accommodation. The Castlemilk estate had already been acquired for building by the Glasgow Corporation under a compulsory purchase order in 1936, prior to the war.
In 1947, a delegation from Glasgow visited Marseille to see the new social housing designed by the Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier, who was a pioneer of modern urban planning. The group examined how his ideas could be applied to Glasgow with the proposed development of new “townships” on the outskirts of the city. Around the same time a second strategy was also formulated for the dispersal of the city&#x27;s population, this being new towns such as East Kilbride (which is only a few miles across countryside from Castlemilk). However, the city fathers were anxious to ensure that most people remained living within the Glasgow boundaries so they keenly pursued the townships project even with limited space available on which to build. The other areas identified for this were Pollok, Drumchapel and Easterhouse – collectively referred to along with Castlemilk as &quot;the big four&quot;.
In December 1952, Glasgow Corporation approved a sketch layout plan for the construction of a new township at Castlemilk with an estimated cost of £16,000,000. It was planned to ultimately comprise some 8,300 houses. In early 1953, more detailed plans for the development of Castlemilk were prepared by Archibald George Jury, who had been appointed as Glasgow’s first City Architect in 1951, a post he held until his retirement in 1972.
There was a very limited range of different house types planned for the initial Castlemilk scheme. Most of the accommodation was to be contained in three or four-storey tenement blocks. There were also to be three-storey terraced houses intended for larger families and a few other house types designed for the elderly and other groups such as the local fire service personnel. The original 1950s flats, entered from common closes, seem to have been designed as modern versions of the traditional Glasgow tenements. Unlike many of the Victorian tenement dwellings, however, these flats came with interior bathrooms and running hot and cold water. Many of the street names (Ardencraig, Ardmaleish, Birgidale, Dougrie, Dunagoil, Machrie) were derived from rural locations in the County of Bute.
The multi-storey blocks in Castlemilk did not arrive until the 1960s. Built after the added amenities that included: a swimming pool, the shopping arcade and the community centre. Archibald Jury was the architect responsible for the creation of the three 20-storey tower blocks in Dougrie Road, from the planning stage in 1960 to their completion in 1966 (these are still standing). The Mitchelhill high-rise blocks at Ardencraig Road, built on high and exposed ground at the edge of the Cathkin Braes and designed to be a prominent feature of the city skyline, were designed and built by George Wimpey Ltd, between 1963 and 1965 (they were demolished in 2005); Wimpey was also responsible for the construction of Bogany Flats in 1966 (demolished as early as 1993).
Public housing policy in Scotland was radically changed by the Tenants&#x27; Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980, which gave tenants the right to buy their council houses for the first time. Since then, renovation, demolition and refurbishment of Castlemilk’s existing housing stock has taken place, as well as the development of areas of new build houses for owner-occupation. Tenure has diversified with home ownership transferred from the City Council to local Housing Associations and owner-occupiers.

The township centre at Castlemilk Arcade / Dougrie Drive was developed by Ravenseft Properties Ltd between 1961 and 1963 on a site which was formerly the location of the large country houses at Castleton, west of Castlemilk House itself. The centre was designed to contain about sixty shops at an estimated cost of £3m to £4m. The shops are still standing, with an 80% occupancy rate. The north side of the arcade on Dougrie Drive contains Castlemilk&#x27;s only pub, the Oasis. After the shopping centre&#x27;s small Co-op Food supermarket confirmed it would closed its doors in 2016, residents launched a campaign for improved grocery shopping provision in the district, with local bodies failing to attract any suitable tenants for either the Braes Centre (described by campaigners as badly outdated) or at any new standalone sites.
The original neighbourhood shops were built at the ground floors of the tenement blocks, following the old Glasgow pattern. Ownership of these small shops has been transferred from the Council to the Glasgow Housing Association, who have let the surviving blocks of shops in Stravanan Road and Tormusk Road to various tenants.
Castlemilk House was demolished in 1972 after being used as a children&#x27;s home for several years and then falling derelict. The accompanying stables block (built 1794, designed by David Hamilton and Category B listed) survived and was restored; it now contains the local housing offices, community facilities and a nursery. The green areas between the clusters of housing, including the old features of the Castlemilk House estate, are managed as a Park and Woodlands, an award-winning project aimed to benefit the community.

Unlike some amenities, schools were in the Castlemilk plans from its conception. Eight primary schools served the area, with some of them closing and merging going into the 21st century – there are now four: Miller, Castleton, St Bartholomew&#x27;s RC and John Paul II RC, plus one special school, Kirkriggs.

Glenwood Secondary School was the first of the scheme&#x27;s three high schools to be constructed in 1958, followed by the (Catholic) St Margaret Mary&#x27;s Secondary School in 1962 and Grange Secondary School in 1968. Falling population numbers led to Glenwood closing its doors in 1990 (a business centre now occupies the site) and the pupils transferring to Grange, which was renamed Castlemilk High School. In 2001 that school was rebuilt on a smaller scale on the same site, with the playground and buildings swapping places; St Margaret Mary&#x27;s was reconstructed in 2002 using the same method. Some children living in the north-west of Castlemilk attend King&#x27;s Park Secondary School in the neighbouring Simshill district, whilst the village school in Carmunnock is affiliated to Castlemilk High.

In 2001, the Reverend John D. Miller, minister of Castlemilk East Parish Church (from 1971 until his retirement in 2007), was elected Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. Miller Primary School in Castlemilk was named after him and his wife. As part of the regeneration of Castlemilk in 1999, several public artworks were commissioned and placed at prominent entrances into the area; these included works by sculptors Kenny Hunter and Rick Kirby.

<text>The New Vogue dance style is an Australian form of sequence dancing that originated in the 1930s. Since then it has become an important part in the Australian and New Zealand ballroom scene, holding as much importance in social and competition dancing as Latin or International Standard dances.

== The Dances ==
There are a large number of New Vogue dances, although only a handful are common. All New Vogue dances are based on a sequence of dance steps which are continually repeated, usually until the music ends. These sequences are always either 16 or 32 bars long, and require music that is in turn &quot;sequenced&quot; (composed of verses that are either 16 or 32 bars long). Due to the nature of the dances they are much easier to pick up by beginners than, say, Latin dances (which have numerous types of steps that are combined into custom routines) and as such, beginner dancers are less likely to feel overwhelmed when learning them and can perform the dances to a respectable level within a short time of learning. New Vogue dances can be danced at different levels, with higher levels requiring more precise steps and the addition of arm and torso movement, known as &quot;styling&quot;. This in a nutshell makes the dances easy to pick up but hard to master. New Vogue Dances are based on one of several sub categories, including Viennese Waltz Rhythm, Slow Foxtrot Rhythm, March Rhythm and Tango Rhythm.

== Competition New Vogue ==
Out of the many New Vogue Dances, fifteen are recognised by &quot;Dancesport Australia&quot; for use in DanceSport competitions. These, and their rhythms, are listed below.

<text>Aušra or Auszra (literally: &quot;dawn&quot;) was the first national Lithuanian newspaper. The first issue was published in 1883, in Ragnit, East Prussia, Germany (newspaper credited it as ) East Prussia&#x27;s ethnolinguistic part - Lithuania Minor. Later it was published monthly in Tilsit (present-day Sovetsk). Even though only forty issues were published and the circulation did not exceed 1,000, it was a significant event as it marked the beginnings of the Lithuanian national rebirth that eventually resulted in an independent Lithuanian State (1918–1940). This period, between 1883 and 1904, when the Lithuanian press ban was enforced by Tsarist authorities, has been referred to as the &quot;Aušros gadynė&quot; (the Dawn Period). The printing ceased in 1886 as a result of financial issues.

==History==
After the Russian authorities denied permission to publish a Lithuanian newspaper in Vilnius, Jonas Šliūpas proposed to publish it in East Prussia, Germany. However, he was perceived as too radical, and Jurgis Mikšas, the printer, invited Jonas Basanavičius to become its first editor. During its three years of existence, &quot;Aušra&quot; had a total of five editors. After Mikšas had to resign for personal reasons, Šliūpas was entrusted to oversee future publications. However, he ran into conflicts with Basanavičius, who was living in Bulgaria. Šliūpas also had issues with the German authorities due to his involvement in nationalistic movements and had to leave Prussia in 1884. The other editors, Martynas Jankus and Jonas Andziulaitis, did not engage in polemic writing and the controversies calmed down. Soon Mikšas ran into debt and could no longer support the newspaper. The printing was discontinued.

After &quot;Aušra&quot; was discontinued, new Lithuanian-language periodicals appeared. &quot;Varpas&quot; (literally: &quot;The Bell&quot;) was a secular newspaper, while &quot;Šviesa&quot; was more conservative and was a religiously oriented publication.

The newspaper was published outside Lithuania proper because of the Lithuanian press ban that had been enforced by the authorities of the Russian Empire since the Uprising in 1863. It was prohibited to publish anything in the Lithuanian language using the Latin alphabet; the government wished to force the people to use Grazhdanka, a Cyrillic alphabet. Printing in the Latin alphabet was organized abroad, mostly in Lithuania Minor; knygnešiai (literally: &quot;book smugglers&quot;) would carry the printed materials across the German-Russian border. This was one of the ways &quot;Aušra&quot; would reach its readers. The other way was in sealed envelopes.

==Content==
More than 70 people contributed to &quot;Aušra&quot;. The writers, or &quot;Aušrininkai&quot;, came from families of well-to-do peasants that started to appear after serfdom was abolished in 1863. Most of the authors received education in the Russian universities and were fluent in Polish. Because of frequent changes in editorial staff, the newspaper did not have a clear and well-defined agenda. Basanavičius did not envision &quot;Aušra&quot; as a political publication; in the first issue he declared that the newspaper would deal only with cultural matters. However, &quot;Aušra&quot; soon took on a nationalistic agenda. &quot;Aušra&quot; helped to crystallize many ideas about the Lithuanian nation and the definition of a Lithuanian. It started to reject the ideas of resurrecting the old Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The authors started to think about an independent Lithuanian nation-state.

It published on many different subjects like agriculture or reports from Lithuanian communities in the United States, but history was the most popular. The foreword of the first issue began with a Latin proverb, &quot;Homines historiarum ignari semper sunt pueri&quot;, or &quot;People ignoring history remain children forever&quot;. They built upon the works of Simonas Daukantas, the first historian, who wrote history of Lithuania in Lithuanian and painted an idealized image of the mighty Grand Duchy of Lithuania. &quot;Aušra&quot; was critical regarding the forceful Polonisation executed by the Polish clergy and Tsarist Russification. One of the main aims of &quot;Aušra&quot; editors was to gain the usage rights to Lithuanian language and to revive its prestige.

The newspaper was directed at the intelligentsia and therefore limited its readership. The peasants did not appreciate that &quot;Aušra&quot; was secular and did not embrace Catholic traditions.

<text>The Dead C are a New Zealand–based music and art trio made up of members Bruce Russell, Michael Morley and Robbie Yeats. Russell plays electric guitar, Morley sings and plays electric guitar or laptop, and Yeats plays drums. They have been called one of the most interesting bands in the world by Thurston Moore, and have been cited as influences by Bardo Pond, Flying Saucer Attack, Labradford, and Pavement.

== Overview ==
Formed in Dunedin in 1987, the group is known for its lo-fi guitar soundscapes and improvisational take on rock music. Their first Auckland show was in 1989 at Russell Crowe&#x27;s Venue, by which point they had already released two albums on Flying Nun, who Russell had been doing copywriting work for. They became known internationally through their releases on the Philadelphia record label Siltbreeze, especially the 1992 double LP &quot;Harsh 70s Reality&quot;. Early, pre-Siltbreeze albums such as &quot;Eusa Kills&quot; and &quot;DR503&quot; found the group still drifting between song-based work and the experimental free rock found in later albums including &quot;The White House&quot; and &quot;Tusk&quot;. Recent albums have seen the group add electronics and samples, yet still maintaining their origins in trademark hazy guitar chaos. Their records are typically all improvised, and not recorded in a standard professional music studio.

The group performs infrequently outside of New Zealand, although they did travel to the US in March 2002 to perform at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival (curated by Sonic Youth), as well as a couple of gigs in Los Angeles and San Francisco. They also performed for the first time in Europe in May 2004 at Le Weekend, a new music festival in Stirling, Scotland and returned to the UK to play at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival again in December 2006. In 2008, they played a short tour in the United States, and returned to the UK to play All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties in December 2010. In September 2016, they played a few US dates including Cropped Out festival in Louisville, Kentucky

A compilation album covering their first 18 years entitled &quot;Vain Erudite and Stupid: Selected Works 1987-2005&quot; was released on the Ba Da Bing label in 2006.

<doc id="806047" wikidata="Q790027" url="?curid=806047" title="Aušrinė">
<text>Aušrinė (&quot;dawning&quot;, not to be confused with &quot;Aušra&quot;, &quot;dawn&quot;) is a feminine deity of the morning star (Venus) in the Lithuanian mythology. She is the to &quot;Vakarinė&quot;, the evening star.

Her cult possibly stems from that of the Indo-European dawn goddess Hausōs and is related to the Latvian Auseklis, Greek Eos, Roman Aurora and Vedic Ushas. Aušrinė is the goddess of beauty, love and youth, linked with health, re-birth and new beginnings. After the Christianization of Lithuania, the cult merged with Christian images and the symbolism of the Virgin Mary.

== Historical attestation ==
Aušrinė was first mentioned by 16th-century Polish historian Jan Łasicki as &quot;Ausca&quot;. He described a &quot;goddess of the rays of the sun that descend and rise above the horizon&quot;.

== Folkloric role ==
According to folklore, each morning Aušrinė and her servant Tarnaitis (possibly Mercury) prepare the way for Saulė (the Sun). In the evening, Vakarinė prepares the bed for Saulė. The relationship between Saulė and Aušrinė is complex. Sometimes Saulė is described as the mother of Aušrinė, Vakarinė and other planets – Indraja (Jupiter), Sėlija (Saturn), Žiezdrė (Mars), Vaivora (Mercury) and even Žemyna (Earth).

In some stories &quot;Karaliūnė&quot; and &quot;Dangaus Kariūnė&quot; (&quot;Queen of Heaven&quot;) are used to refer to Aušrinė.

In Latvian folk-riddles, her name is the answer to a riddle about dew. In this riddle, a girl loses her keys (or spreads her pearl necklace), the Moon sees them, but the Sun takes them.

=== Myth of the &quot;celestial wedding&quot; ===
A popular myth describes how Mėnulis (Moon) fell in love with beautiful Aušrinė, cheated on his wife Saulė, and received punishment from Perkūnas (thunder-god). Different myths also depict rivalry between Saulė and Aušrinė as Saulė is jealous of Aušrinė&#x27;s beauty and brightness (Venus is the third-brightest object in the sky after Sun and Moon). Despite the adultery or rivalry, Aušrinė remains loyal and continues to serve Saulė in the mornings.

=== Other roles ===
Another myth, &quot;Saulė Ir Vėjų Motina&quot; (&quot;The Sun and the Mother of Winds&quot;), analyzed by Algirdas Julien Greimas in detail, tells a story of Joseph, who becomes fascinated with Aušrinė appearing in the sky and goes on a quest to find the &quot;second sun&quot;. After much adventure, he learns that it was not the second sun, but a maiden who lives on an island in the sea and has the same hair as the Sun. With advice from the Northern Wind, Joseph reaches the island, avoids a guardian bull, and becomes the maiden&#x27;s servant caring for her cattle. In the tale, Aušrinė appeared in three forms: as a star in the sky, as a maiden on land and as a mare in the sea. After a few years, Joseph puts a single hair of the maiden into an empty nutshell and throws it into the sea. A ray from the sea becomes reflected into the sky as the biggest star. Greimas concludes that this tale is a double origin myth: the story describes the origin of Tarnaitis and the ascent of Aušrinė herself into the sky.

== In popular culture ==
According to Jonas Vaiškūnas, Aušrinė also gives its name to the morning star in Lithuanian folkly astronomy: Aušrinė žvaigždė, Aušros žvaigždė, Aušràžvaigždė, Aušrinukė.

<text>In the Bible, Meshech or Mosoch ( &quot;Mešeḵ&quot; &quot;price&quot; or &quot;precious&quot;) is named as a son of Japheth in Genesis 10:2 and 1 Chronicles 1:5.

Another Meshech is named as a son of Shem in 1 Chronicles 1:17 (corresponding to the form &quot;Mash&quot; in Genesis 10).

==Historical interpretations==

Meshech is mentioned along with Tubal (and Rosh, in certain translations) as principalities of &quot;Gog, prince of Magog&quot; in Ezekiel 38:2 and 39:1, and is considered a Japhetite tribe, identified by Flavius Josephus with the Cappadocian &quot;Mosocheni&quot; (Mushki, also associated with Phrygians or Bryges) and their capital Mazaca. In Hippolytus of Rome&#x27;s chronicle (234 AD), the &quot;Illyrians&quot; were identified as Meshech&#x27;s offspring. In addition, Georgians have traditions that they, and other Caucasus people such as Armenians, share descent from Meshech (Georgian: Meskheti), Tubal, and Togarmah.

In 1498, Annio da Viterbo published fragments known as &quot;Pseudo-Berossus&quot;, now considered a forgery, claiming that Babylonian records had shown a son of Japheth called Samothes had begun settling what later became Gaul in the 13th year of Nimrod. Later historians such as Raphael Holinshed (1577) identified Samothes as Meshech, and asserted that he first ruled also in Britain.

Beginning from the 16th century, some European scholars proposed the idea that the Muscovites had stemmed from Meshech. Sir Walter Raleigh (c. 1616) attributes this opinion to Philipp Melanchthon (1497–1560) and to Benito Arias Montano (1571), and it was also followed later by Jonathan Edwards (1703–1758).
Moreover, according to a legend first appearing in the &quot;Kievan Synopsis&quot; (1674), Moscow (&quot;Moskva&quot;) was founded by King Mosokh son of Japheth (i.e. Meshech), and was named for him and his wife, Kva. In this legend, they are also said to have had a son, Ya, and daughter, Vuza, who gave their names to the nearby Yauza River.

According to Archibald Sayce, Meshech can be identified with Muska, a name appearing in Assyrian inscriptions, and generally believed to refer to the Mushki.

Most reference books since Flavius Josephus generally identify Meshech in Ezekiel&#x27;s time as an area in modern Turkey.

<text>Hanze University of Applied Sciences (abbreviated as: &quot;Hanze UAS&quot;; ) is the largest University of Applied Sciences in northern Netherlands and located in Groningen.

Hanze UAS offers various Bachelor and Master programmes in Dutch, English, and German, and works closely with international partner institutes. The school counts approximately 28,000 students and 3,200 employees. About, 8,1% of students are international.

==History==
Hanze UAS was founded in 1986 as the merger of various local institutes for professional education, the oldest of which is the Academie Minerva, founded in 1798, which was the first multi-sectoral institute for practical higher education in the Netherlands. The mission of the Academy Minerva was “The improvement of Drawing, Construction and Nautical Sciences, together with the aligned Arts and Sciences, within all ranks of society, and in particular to improve the skills of the disadvantaged.&quot; Throughout the centuries that followed many more institutions, engaged in a wide range of different fields, were established.

In 1986, Groningen was the first city in the Netherlands where 16 of the 24 vocational schools merged into a larger institute, as recommended in the government paper “Expansion, Division of Tasks, and Concentration in the Higher Educational System”. Hence, Hanze became quickly one of the biggest Universities of Applied Sciences in the nation and data suggests it is growing every year. In 1989 the university joined the Erasmus Programme and in 2014 Hanze became holder of the Erasmus Charter of Higher Education 2014–2020.

The name of Hanze UAS is linked to the Hanseatic League (Dutch: &quot;Hanze&quot;). Groningen, the city hosting the majority of the university&#x27;s facilities, was member of the Hanseatic League between 1282 and 1669.

<doc id="806069" wikidata="Q13553848" url="?curid=806069" title="Professional employer organization">
<text>A professional employer organisation (PEO) is an outsourcing firm that provides services to small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). Typically, the PEO offering may include human resource consulting, safety and risk mitigation services, payroll processing, employer payroll tax filing, workers&#x27; compensation insurance, health benefits, employers&#x27; practice and liability insurance (EPLI), retirement vehicles (401(k)), regulatory compliance assistance, workforce management technology, and training and development. The PEO enters into a contractual co-employment agreement with its clientele. Through co-employment, the PEO becomes the [[Employer of Record]] (EoR) for tax purposes through filing payroll taxes under its own tax identification numbers. As the legal employer, the PEO is responsible for withholding proper taxes, paying unemployment insurance taxes and providing workers’ compensation coverage.

As of 2017, industry gross revenues in the United States were estimated to be over annually. In 2017, there were 907 PEOs operating in the United States alone, servicing 3.7 million worksite employees (WSEs), which were spread over approximately 175,000 PEO clients.

==Business model==
In co-employment, the PEO becomes the employer of record for tax purposes, filing paperwork under its own tax identification numbers. The client company continues to direct the employees&#x27; day-to-day activities. PEOs charge a service fee for taking over the human resources and payroll functions of the client company: typically, this is from 3 to 15% of total gross payroll. This fee is in addition to the normal employee overhead costs, such as the employer&#x27;s share of FICA, Medicare, and unemployment insurance withholding. This service fee is most commonly referred to as an &quot;administration fee.&quot;

One service provided by a PEO is to secure workers&#x27; compensation insurance coverage at a lower cost than client companies can obtain on an individual basis. Essentially, a PEO obtains workers&#x27; compensation coverage for its clients by negotiating insurance coverage that covers not just the PEO, but also the client companies. This is allowed because, legally, the PEO is the employer of the workers at the client companies. PEOs can also offer basic levels of background &amp; drug screening.

A professional employer organization (PEO) is not a staffing agency or human resources outsourcing company. A PEO works on behalf of small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) to manage HR management, employee benefits, compliance, payroll, retirement planning, and more. The client company may also be able to offer a better overall package of benefits, and thus attract more skilled employees. The PEO model is therefore attractive to small and mid-sized businesses and associations, and PEO marketing is typically directed toward this segment.

Several variations on the PEO model exist, differing in the nature of the relationship formed between PEO and client company.

*Administrative services organizations (ASO) are similar to PEOs, but do not create a co-employment relationship. Employees remain solely under the control of the client company. Tax and insurance filings are done by the ASO, but under the client company&#x27;s Employer Identification Number.
*Umbrella companies, found primarily in the UK, act as employer of record for independent contractors instead of permanent employees. The contractors become employees of the umbrella company, but do not also become employees of the client. The growth in umbrella companies in the UK is attributed to legislation targeting &quot;disguised income&quot; by contractors performing the same duties as employees but hired via intermediaries. The press release announcing the legislation, IR35, is often used to refer to the legislation itself.
*Pass-through agencies are staffing firms that act as the employer of record for independent contractors, but do not obtain work for them. Like umbrella companies in the UK, the contractors do not become employees of the client.
*Global PEO and International PEO services are now being offered by third-party HR intermediaries acting as an Employer of Record (EOR) to assist companies that hire globally in navigating rules and regulations in various countries where they want to hire. Companies that provide PEO/EOR services are able to do so in over 185 countries.
*Financial intermediaries, also called fiscal intermediaries, act as an employer of record for home healthcare workers who serve disabled persons. This streamlines the process of hiring such workers, because neither the household hiring them nor government units that provide funding need to take on the duties of an employer. They are part of the self-determination movement in disability care.

PEOs can benefit companies differently. For example, a blue collar organization may see more value in workers&#x27; compensation insurance and vice versa.

==Early history==
Employee leasing in the United States began in the late 1960s by three businessmen, Eugene Boffa, Louis Calmare, and Joseph Martinez. The concept was popularized by Marvin R. Selter, who leased the employees of a doctor&#x27;s office in Southern California. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) contained an exemption for &quot;multiple employer welfare arrangements&quot; (MEWA), which provided a loophole for employers with leased employees to claim they were exempt from the ERISA requirements. Passage of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) further encouraged employee leasing by providing a tax shelter for employers who contributed a minimum amount to employee plans. More stringent guidelines in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 later eliminated most of the TEFRA incentive, however.

By 1985, there were approximately 275 staff leasing companies in the United States.

==Abuses==
State Unemployment Tax (SUTA) arbitrage, commonly referred to as &quot;SUTA dumping,&quot; occurs when an employer with a high unemployment insurance rate transfers or &quot;dumps&quot; employees to purchased subsidiaries with lower unemployment insurance rates. In a PEO relationship, the client company takes the Professional Employer Organization&#x27;s SUTA rate by law, which often lowers their SUTA through SUTA Arbitrage. The only time this wouldn&#x27;t apply is in client reporting states.

Owners of professional employer organizations are in a position to commit fraud by keeping the funds deducted from employee paychecks instead of paying the insurance and government entities for whom the deductions were made. In a case in San Antonio, Texas four executives were convicted of siphoning $133 million from the three PEOs they owned and operated.

==Certified professional employer organizations==

In 2014, the United States Congress enacted sections 3511 and 7705 of the Internal Revenue Code, provisions that include special definitions and rules related to the Federal tax treatment of a &quot;certified professional employer organization.&quot;

==Regulation==
Each state in the U.S. has differing regulations for workers&#x27; compensation insurance and state unemployment insurance, so PEOs are typically regulated at the state level.

In 2004, President George W. Bush signed into law the SUTA Dumping Prevention Act of 2004, which requires that all 50 states enact anti-SUTA-dumping legislation by 2007. Most states have now done so; however, federal law does not prohibit companies from using a PEO to obtain more favorable SUTA rates.

The staff leasing industry itself has also taken steps to address abuses. It formed its first trade association, the National Staff Leasing Association, in 1985. The association changed its name to the National Association of Professional Employer Organizations in 1994 to reflect the term in current usage.

As part of the industry&#x27;s self-regulation efforts, an independent accreditation body, the Employer Services Assurance Corporation (ESAC), was formed in 1995. ESAC verifies accredited PEOs&#x27; compliance with important ethical, financial, and operational standards and provides financial assurance of the performance of key employer obligations by these PEOs. This financial assurance is backed by over $15 million in surety bonds and assures PEO clients, employees, insurers and government authorities that accredited PEOs are meeting their contractual and fiduciary responsibilities.

PEOs may also undergo a certification process conducted by the independent Certification Institute (CI) formed in 2002. This certification verifies that a PEO&#x27;s workers&#x27; compensation (WC) program is meeting proven insurance industry risk management best practices to reduce work-related accidents and health exposures and control WC insurance losses.

==Updated changes==

In 1985 there were approximately 275 staff leasing companies in operation. In 2012, according to National Association of Professional Employer Organizations (NAPEO), there are now approximately 700 PEOs operating in all 50 states. They were responsible for approximately $81 billion in gross revenue in 2010.

==NCCI impact on PEOs==

A recent change in 2013 regarding the way companies Experience Modifier is calculated has caused companies with previously good modifiers to get better, while companies whose modifiers had struggled previously have gotten worse. The Experience Rating Plan, as the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI) refers to it, will be undergoing a change that NCCI believes will more accurately reflect individual employers’ claims experience. NCCI, the National Council on Compensation Insurance, sees this as a &quot;Mod Neutral&quot; action since the median average does not change. While some companies get better, some get worse. Overall, however, the &quot;center&quot; stays in essentially the same spot. While this will assist the good companies to improve their position, this will cause the companies in dire straits to get worse. Many of these companies may be forced out of the &quot;standard&quot; market and into secondary markets such as PEO&#x27;s and other &quot;options of last resort&quot; such as state pools. This may lead to a further increase in the number of PEOs, or it may lead to an increase in state pools, or possibly both.

NCCI views this action as having two primary benefits. The first is that it &quot;tailors the cost prediction and final net premium cost to the individual insured&quot; making the calculation more accurate. The second benefit is that &quot;it provides added incentives for loss reduction.&quot;

<doc id="806075" wikidata="Q415885" url="?curid=806075" title="Γ-Linolenic acid">
<text>γ-Linolenic acid or GLA (INN: gamolenic acid) is an &quot;n&quot;−6, or omega-6, fatty acid found primarily in seed oils. When acting on GLA, arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase produces no leukotrienes and the conversion by the enzyme of arachidonic acid to leukotrienes is inhibited.

==Chemistry==
GLA is categorized as an &quot;n&quot;−6 (also called ω−6 or omega-6) fatty acid, meaning that the first double bond on the methyl end (designated with &quot;n&quot; or ω) is the sixth bond. In physiological literature, GLA is designated as 18:3 (&quot;n&quot;−6). GLA is a carboxylic acid with an 18-carbon chain and three &quot;cis&quot; double bonds. It is a regioisomer of α-linolenic acid, which is a polyunsaturated &quot;n&quot;−3 (omega-3) fatty acid, found in rapeseed canola oil, soybeans, walnuts, flax seed (linseed oil), perilla, chia, and hemp seed.

==History==
GLA was first isolated from the seed oil of evening primrose. This herbal plant was grown by Native Americans to treat swelling in the body.
In the 17th century, it was introduced to Europe and became a popular folk remedy, earning the name &quot;king&#x27;s cure-all.&quot;
In 1919, Heiduschka and Lüft extracted the oil from evening primrose seeds and described an unusual linolenic acid, which they name γ-.
Later, the exact chemical structure was characterized by Riley.

Although there are α- and γ- forms of linolenic acid, there is no β- form. One was once identified, but it turned out to be an artifact of the original analytical process.

==Dietary sources==
GLA is obtained from vegetable oils such as evening primrose (&quot;Oenothera biennis&quot;) oil (EPO), blackcurrant seed oil, borage seed oil, and hemp seed oil. GLA is also found in varying amounts in edible hemp seeds, oats, barley, and spirulina. Normal safflower (&quot;Carthamus tinctorius&quot;) oil does not contain GLA, but a genetically modified GLA safflower oil available in commercial quantities since 2011 contains 40% GLA. Borage oil contains 20% GLA, evening primrose oil ranges from 8% to 10% GLA, and black-currant oil contains 15–20%.

The human body produces GLA from linoleic acid (LA). This reaction is catalyzed by Δ6-desaturase (D6D), an enzyme that allows the creation of a double bond on the sixth carbon counting from the carboxyl terminus. LA is consumed sufficiently in most diets, from such abundant sources as cooking oils and meats. However, a lack of GLA can occur when there is a reduction of the efficiency of the D6D conversion (for instance, as people grow older or when there are specific dietary deficiencies) or in disease states wherein there is excessive consumption of GLA metabolites.

==Source of eicosanoids==

From GLA, the body forms dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA). This is one of the body&#x27;s three sources of eicosanoids (along with AA and EPA.) DGLA is the precursor of the prostaglandin PGH1, which in turn forms PGE1 and the thromboxane TXA1. Both PGE11 and TXA1 are anti-inflammatory; thromboxane TXA1, unlike its series-2 variant, induces vasodilation, and inhibits platelet consequently, TXA1 modulates (reduces) the pro-inflammatory properties of the thromboxane TXA2. PGE1 has a role in regulation of immune system function and is used as the medicine alprostadil.

Unlike AA and EPA, DGLA cannot yield leukotrienes. However, it can inhibit the formation of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes from AA.

Although GLA is an &quot;n&quot;−6 fatty acid, a type of acid that is, in general, pro-inflammatory, it has anti-inflammatory properties. &quot;(See discussion at Essential fatty acid interactions: The paradox of dietary GLA.)&quot;

==Topical use==

In 2002, the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency withdrew marketing authorisations for evening primrose oil as an eczema remedy.

<text>Aitvaras is a nature spirit in Lithuanian mythology. It is also known by other names, such as Atvaras, Damavykas, Pūkis, Sparyžius, Koklikas, Gausinėlis, Žaltvikšas, and Spirukas, and is identical to the Latvian Pūķis. An Aitvaras looks like a white or black rooster with a fiery tail like a meteor. An Aitvaras is said to hatch from an egg of a 9- to 15-year-old rooster. If an Aitvaras dies, it becomes a spark.

In many cases, this Lithuanian creature is described as a bird with the appearance of a dragon outdoors. An Aitvaras will lodge itself in a house and most often refuse to leave. It brings both good and bad luck to the inhabitants of the house, providing its adopted home with stolen gold and grain, often getting the household into trouble.

<text>Boys on the Side is a 1995 American comedy-drama film directed by Herbert Ross (in his final film as a director). It stars Whoopi Goldberg, Mary-Louise Parker and Drew Barrymore, as three friends on a cross-country road trip. The screenplay was written by Don Roos.

==Plot==
Jane, a musician who recently broke-up with her girlfriend and her band, decides to move from New York City to Los Angeles. She answers a newspaper ad for a co-driver to Los Angeles posted by Robin, a real estate agent who is also moving to California. Jane initially declines to join her on the road, but agrees after her car gets towed. Jane and Robin begin their journey and make a stop in Pittsburgh to see Jane&#x27;s friend, Holly.

Jane and Robin witness a fight between Holly and her abusive boyfriend Nick about missing drugs. The three fight Nick when he assaults Holly in an argument over drugs. Holly hits Nick in the head with a bat to stop him from attacking Jane and knocks him out. They tape Nick to a chair with duct tape and put four hours worth of loud music on his stereo to give themselves a head start. Holly snaps a Polaroid of herself with the tied and bound Nick before they leave.

Hours later, Nick frees himself but falls, hits his head and dies from his injuries. Robin sees a newspaper with the report of his death the next day. They debate what to do. When Holly confesses she’s also pregnant, and afraid of being arrested for murder, everyone decides to continue on to California together.

During a stop in Tucson, Arizona, Robin collapses at a local diner and is rushed to hospital for pneumonia. A doctor informs Jane and Holly that Robin has HIV as well as pneumonia. They decide to stay in Tucson and start new lives there.

Robin’s health improves, Jane gets a job singing in a bar and Holly falls in love with a local police officer named Abe Lincoln.

==Reception==
&quot;Boys on the Side&quot; received a positive response from critics. The film was entered into the 19th Moscow International Film Festival.

Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars, writing:The reviews for &quot;Boys on the Side&quot; will mention &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot; and &quot;Thelma and Louise&quot;, because it shares their assorted themes: female bonding, unexpressed love, women on the run. But this movie is not a collection of parts from other films. It&#x27;s an original, and what it does best is show how strangers can become friends, and friends can become like family.
To get to know someone is very difficult, but if you really do, they should be able to tell you almost anything, and ask you almost anything, and that is where &quot;Boys on the Side&quot; is leading us.

===Box office===
The film grossed $23.4 million in the United States and Canada for a total of $47.4 million worldwide.

<doc id="806083" wikidata="Q523141" url="?curid=806083" title="1999 Iranian student protests">
<text>The Iranian student protests of July 1999 (also known as 18th of [[Tir (month)|Tir]] and Kuye [[:wikt:دانشگاه|Daneshgah]] Disaster () in Iran) (7–13 July) were, before the 2009 Iranian election protests, the most widespread and violent public protests to occur in Iran since the early years of the Iranian Revolution.

The protests began on 8 July with peaceful demonstrations in Tehran against the closure of the reformist newspaper, &quot;Salam&quot;. Following the demonstrations, a student dormitory was raided by riot police that night during which a student was killed. The raid sparked six days of demonstrations and rioting throughout the country, during which at least three other people were killed and more than 200 injured.

In the aftermath of these incidents, more than seventy students disappeared. In addition to an estimated 1,200–1,400 detainees, the &quot;whereabouts and condition&quot; of five students named by Human Rights Watch who are believed to be detained by Iranian authorities remain unknown.

== Overview ==

The protests began on the eve of 9 July 1999 after a peaceful demonstration by a group of students of Tehran University against the closure of the reformist newspaper, &quot;Salam&quot;, by the press court. The &quot;Salam&quot; newspaper (Persian: روزنامه سلام) was operated by the Association of Combatant Clerics, the reformist political party to which the then president, Mohammad Khatami belonged. The student groups, which at the time were considered one of the major supporters of Khatami and his reform programs, were protesting in support of Khatami against the closure of the newspaper by the judiciary, which was controlled by the hardline opponents of President Khatami.

On the evening of the protests, &quot;about 400 plainclothes paramilitaries descended on a university dormitory, whispering into short-wave radios and wielding green sticks.&quot; The paramilitaries, thought to be Ansar-e-Hezbollah and Basij, began attacking students, kicking down doors and smashing through halls, grabbing female students by the hair and setting fire to rooms. Several students were thrown off of third story balconies &quot;onto pavement below, their bones crushed,&quot; and one student paralyzed. According to students&#x27; accounts, uniformed police stood by and did nothing. &quot;Witnesses reported that at least one student was killed, 300 wounded, and thousands detained in the days that followed.&quot;

The next day, unrest began in earnest, spreading through Tehran and to other cities and continuing for almost a week, with unemployed youths joining the students. The Basij are reported to have disguised themselves as students (wearing jeans, T-shirts, and shaving their faces) and thrown bricks into shop windows to discredit the student demonstrators. The five days of rioting &quot;turned Tehran into a battlefield,&quot; and was &quot;inarguably the worst mass disturbance&quot; the Islamic Republic had seen in its 20 years of existence. Running street battles left downtown Tehran &quot;gutted,&quot; with burned-out buses, and smashed storefronts.

There were many arrests and injuries, and at least one confirmed fatal shooting, namely that of Ezzat Ebrahim-Nejad. The death of Ebrahim-Nejad was the only one acknowledged by the state-controlled Iranian television, however, major student groups and the foreign media have claimed more than 17 dead during the week of violent protests. Another student Saeed Zeinali disappeared after his arrest by security forces.

Major Iranian cities such as Tabriz, Mashhad, Shiraz and Esfahan were scenes of violent and widespread demonstrations as well. The protests continued at Tabriz University on 11 July 1999 (20th of Tir) and police and hardliners responded similarly in Tabriz universities and schools, entering the universities and brutally attacked students. Four students died in the unrest and many were beaten while in custody.

According to &quot;The Economist&quot; magazine, the demonstrations &quot;took a more violent turn on 13 July, when some of the students, deeply dissatisfied with the official response, tried to storm the Ministry of the Interior, the perceived seat of their troubles.&quot; On July 13 President Khatami issued a statement &quot;disowning&quot; the demonstrators, stating that continued defiance of the ban on demonstrations was &quot;an attack on the foundations of the régime.&quot;

The next day, 14 July, &quot;Tens of thousands of supporters&quot; of Supreme Leader Khamenei rallied in Tehran in a demonstration called by the Organization for Islamic Propagation (Keesing&#x27;s July 1999). &quot;Reports characterize the demonstration as the régime&#x27;s counterattack, claiming that the demonstrators include tens of thousands government employees who have been brought to Tehran by bus.&quot;

=== Student Uprising: July 1999, &quot;18 Tir&quot; ===
The Iranian student protests of July 1999 is considered to be the first massive uprising initiated by the generation born under the Islamic Republic Regime. The protest grew out of response to the Islamic Republic&#x27;s violent attack on Tehran University&#x27;s student dormitory on July 9, 1999, in which numerous students were seriously injured and several killed. Over the next five days proceeding the attack, approximately 50,000 students protested in Tehran, in addition to thousands more in various universities across Iran, against both conservatives and reformists under the Islamic Republic Regime and The Supreme Leader Khamenei, in particular. Student protester&#x27;s main demand called for the replacement of the Islamic Republic with a government that upheld the ideals of secular democracy. The student protests of July 1999 is considered to be a foundation for the Green Movement of 2009.

=== Election of 1997 ===
The presidential election of Mohammad Khatami on 23 May 1997 is symbolic of Iran&#x27;s desire for reform. The elections resulted in higher voter turnout as a result of Khatami&#x27;s liberal views that attracted large number of youth and women specifically. In fact, &quot;Iran&#x27;s youth…reportedly made up a large part of the 20 million who gave Khatami his victory. They were joined by large numbers of women.&quot; The election of Khatami brought hope of economic, political and societal reform to Iranian citizens. One of the ways that Khatami appealed to women was by stating his belief that, &quot;women should be active in all social, political and economic activities, and said he would welcome qualified women in his cabinet if he should win the presidency. Efforts should be made to do away with male supremacy&quot;. By holding such liberal ideas, Khatami sets himself up for battle against conservative ideology within the judicial sector of the government. In addition, &quot;the Islamic Republic in 1997 was still an oligarchy, controlled by a network of Shi&#x27;ite clerics who were disciples of Ayatollah Khomeini&quot; and loyal followers of Islam. Therefore, the liberal views of Khatami did not coincide with those of the clerics. Still, it seems as if Khatami strategically attracts votes from youth and women through his liberalistic views. In fact he &quot;distanced himself from the faltering and unpopular campaign to &#x27;Islamize&#x27; the universities, a goal of the conservative faction&quot;. This quote indicates that Khatami noticed the dissatisfaction with the conservative&#x27;s agenda and consequently used this to his advantage. As a result, the election of Khatami publicized the Iranian citizens need for reform, especially in regards to freedom of the press.

=== Government and the press ===
The control of the press that the Iranian government had was a result of the &quot;dysfunctional dualism of political and ideological institutions&quot;. The struggle between conservative and moderate reform administration resulted in restriction of the press. During this time period, Iran experienced an apparent struggle of power between reformist president Muhammad Khatami and the conservative leader of the Islamic republic, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In efforts to decrease support for the president&#x27;s liberalization agenda, the judiciary closed down newspapers that expressed reformative views. The judiciary justified the closure of several publications on the basis of &quot;factional issues …The hardline judiciary close[d] reformist publications, while hardline ones that commit[ed] similar violations [were] rarely punished&quot;. The judiciary used press policies as a tool to promote conservative views. The judiciary was able to do this because press policies were vague and used to their benefit. Consequently, on 7 July 1999 the Salam daily was closed. The basis of the closure was because of a report revealing plans by the Ministry of Intelligence and Security to restrict the press. The editor of the newspaper faced &quot;charges of spreading fabrications, disturbing public opinion, and publishing classified documents&quot;. The judicial sector of the Iranian government had clear objectives to eradicate the spread of reformative views by closing down publications that spread truth to the public however the judiciary distorted the information to enable their control of the press.

The press in Iran, within the boundaries of the established order which consist of the president and the clerics has reflected throughout history intergovernmental debates. These debates are dictated by the structure of governance in the Islamic Republic and who holds power. The press under the Islamic Republic in Iran has never been free. The basis of the Islamic Republic ipso facto was established upon the forceful closure of nearly all the existing free press, in the mid-summer of 1980. The only period that the press was free was from February through July 1980. In addition, since the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the many publications have been connected ideologically to the political sectors that exist in the regime. Still publications that are considered to be pro-reform have endured consequence of closure. Although liberal publications face opposition by law, &quot;they have remained resilient beneath the political undercurrents of the society, as the advocates of freedom of the press, freedom of speech, etc&quot;. Nevertheless, liberal independent publications were under risk of extinction due to the marginalization inflicted by the Islamic Republic in Iran.

=== Press and the July 1999 protest ===
In Iran, there has been a history of ideological and governmental conflicts that are revealed in the sphere of politics. Since the election of Khatami, this issue where belief and government come into contact has become more and more apparent. The internal struggle and basic factional disputes within the state are reflected by the management of the press in general and the control of those publications that spoke on behalf of the controlled sects within the government.

The student protest of July 1999 occurred as a result of these restrictions of freedom of the press. Prior to the protest, the publisher of the Daily Saleem was &quot;arrested, put on trial, and convicted for printing&quot; false information. In the Daily Saleem, communication between Saeed Emami, former Deputy Minister of Intelligence of the Islamic Republic to his boss, Intelligence Ministry Chief Qorban-Ali Dorri-Najafabadi was revealed to the public. The Daily Saleem published information about governmental plans to further restrict and control freedom of the press.

In response to the closure of the newspaper, hundreds of students from Tehran University participated in a demonstration on 8 July. This demonstration has been deemed to be peaceful. The day following the demonstration, security forces, including the police and the Ansar-e-Hezbollah, invaded student dormitories and resulted in injuries, arrest and extensive damages to the student dormitories. On July 9, 1999, the students of Tabriz University protested, demanding more freedom and continuing the protests started at Tehran University. Following the invasion of student dormitories, intense pro-democracy demonstrations took place on 12 and 13 July. In response to the pro-democratic protest, Ali Khamenei and his conservative supporters organized a counter-demonstration rally which occurred on 14 July. Consequently, it is estimated that over 1,500 student protesters were arrested. Some scholars recognize the regime&#x27;s &quot;overreaction to both its own reform counterparts and the opposition forces reveal[s], how weak and insecure the ruling conservatives are&quot;. The reasoning behind this idea is that if the government was confident in its laws and policies, it would not demonstrate fear. In the &quot;Journal of Iranian Research and Analysis&quot;, Cyrus Bina indicates that fear is demonstrated when:

two dozen high-ranking Pasdar commanders present President Khatarni an official letter of ultimatum, telling him that they have no choice except to seize power if he fails to crush the student rebellion soon … commanders, who are under direct authority of Khamenei, threatened the President that their patience is running thin and that they can no longer stand on the sideline.

The fact that the clerics and judicial sector felt the urgency to immediately stop the student protests is an indication of the fear they had and the amount of influence the protestors could have on Iranian society if their voices were not silenced. Therefore, it is clear that the initial student protest was prompted by the closure of the daily Saleem which occurred on 7 July. The protesters expressed strong objection to the restriction on freedom of the press by the judicial sector. The protest reflects the collective resentment of the public against the suppression of the press and the restriction of basic freedoms and universal rights.
After the attack on the students of Tehran University by a hard-line vigilante group, Khatami delivered a speech three months later defending his reform program and insisting on the foundations of his government. He referred to the reformation of the system from within with holding two elements of Islamic and republic.

=== Student demands during protest ===

The end results that the students were expecting from the protest are reflected in the slogans that they chanted during the protest. After researching the popular slogans used during the protest, it is evident that the student had multitude of demands as a result of the six-day demonstrations in Tehran. Still, it is important that the slogans are analyzed in relation the objective of the overall protest. From all the slogans used throughout the protest there is one common theme that ties all of them together, opposition to Ali Khamenei, the &quot;Supreme Leader&quot; as referenced in the slogans, his Ansar-e Hezbollah, and the state-supported terrorism
In nearly one-third of the slogans used during the protest in 1999, students demonstrated opposition to Khamenei directly. For example, the slogan &quot;Khamenei! Shame on You, Leadership Is Not for You&quot; is one a very daring statement and is considered one of the &quot;boldest yet to be found in any demonstration in the last decade in Iran&quot;. These straight forward criticisms toward Khamenei, combined with slogans against the cleric rule and the &quot;20-year&quot; repression under the Islamic order, reflect the failed velayat-e faghih as a model of government in Iran.

In addition students involved in the protest revealed resentment toward the Ansar-e Hezbollah. This resentment deriving from violent intervention, disruption of political meetings, peaceful demonstrations and university lectures in support of the cleric and the supreme leader. According to Cyrus Bina, these type of &quot;pressure groups are kept on the government&#x27;s payroll and that their violence is often coordinated with the uniformed law enforcement forces against the public&quot;. Consequently, it is evident that during this time period conservatives constantly made efforts against liberals even through infliction of violence. The Iranian student demonstrations of July 1999 reveal the desperate need for reform. From research it is evident that the protest against the closure of the Daily Saleem resulted in a 6-day protest. That was motivated by a limited group. The demonstrations of July 1999 engaged students in politics, protesting against government corruption, political repression, the clerical rule and Khamenei. In the bigger picture, the students were protesting against the system of the Islamic Republic in Iran. In the end the protest was an act upon their needs for reform that was fueled during the election on May 23, 1997, in Iran.

=== Aftermath ===
A crackdown on reformists and reform policies followed the riots.
* A &quot;long-negotiated compromise&quot; that would have weakened the Council of Guardians to screening candidates for parliament and president was vetoed, giving the guardians &quot;absolute vetting power&quot;.
* A &quot;thought crime&quot; law was passed prohibiting &quot;any violent or peaceful act by a person or group against the regime&quot; including speech, and punishing such criticism with stiff sentences.
* Another law prohibited &quot;any contact or exchange of information, interviews or collusion with foreign embassies, organization, parties or media at whatever level which could be judged harmful to Iran&#x27;s independence, national unity or the interests of the Islamic republic.&quot;

As of 31 July 2006, several students involved in the demonstration such as Manouchehr Mohammadi, Ahmad Batebi, Farokh Shafiei, Hassan Zarezadeh Ardeshir, were still in jail. Of those students, Akbar Mohammadi died during a hunger strike while protesting against his prison sentence; Human Rights Watch called his death &quot;suspicious&quot; and demanded an investigation. Heshmat Tabarzadi, viewed by the Iranian government as one of the leaders of the protests, was arrested and spent nine years in Evin Prison, including two in solitary confinement. According to the Middle East Eye, a lecturer in the U.K argued that the impact of the 1999 student protests became apparent 10 years later during the 2009 Green Movement. 

== 2009 anniversary protests ==
On 9 July 2009, &quot;18 Tir&quot; anniversary protests were scheduled for many cities in Iran and other cities worldwide. &quot;Time&quot; reported that thousands marched through the central districts of Tehran to commemorate the July 1999 student protests, and to protest the June 2009 presidential election.

Early on during the protest, Amnesty International reported: &quot;At least 200 demonstrators are reported to have gathered along Enghlab Avenue, around the gates of Tehran University, only to be confronted by a large presence of anti-riot police and plain-clothed security officials, possibly including members of the notorious Basij militia, who used baton charges and tear gas to disperse them.&quot;

After dark, clashes continued and rubbish was set ablaze.

&quot;The demonstrators made a moral point. They told the government in no uncertain terms they are still there and not going away,&quot; said an Iranian analyst who witnessed the mayhem.

&quot;The Australian&quot; reported: &quot;The millions of Iranians who no longer dare to demonstrate have not gone away either. They are channelling their anger into a campaign of civil disobedience. Apart from shouting &#x27;God is great&#x27; from their rooftops every night, they have started writing Mr Mousavi&#x27;s name on banknotes, boycotting government banks and goods advertised on state television and turning on all their electrical appliances at the same time to try to overload the electricity grid.&quot;

<doc id="806084" wikidata="Q235605" url="?curid=806084" title="Jeanne Hébuterne">
<text>Jeanne Hébuterne (; 6 April 1898 – 26 January 1920) was a French painter and art model best known as the frequent subject and common-law wife of the artist Amedeo Modigliani. She died by suicide two days after Modigliani&#x27;s death, and is now buried beside him.

== Early life ==
Jeanne Hébuterne was born in Meaux, Seine-et-Marne, the second child to Achille Casimir Hébuterne (born 1857), who worked at Le Bon Marché, a department store, and Eudoxie Anaïs Tellier Hébuterne (born 1860). The family was Roman Catholic.

A beautiful girl, she was introduced to the artistic community in Montparnasse by her brother André Hébuterne, who wanted to become a painter. She met several of the then-starving artists and modeled for Tsuguharu Foujita.

Wanting to pursue a career in the arts, and with a talent for drawing, she chose to study at the Académie Colarossi, where in the spring of 1917 Hébuterne was introduced to Amedeo Modigliani by the sculptor Chana Orloff, who came with many other artists to take advantage of the academy&#x27;s live models.

Jeanne began an affair with the charismatic artist, and the two fell deeply in love. She soon moved in with him, despite strong objections from her parents.

== Life with Modigliani ==

Described by the writer (1883–1954) as gentle, shy, quiet, and delicate, Jeanne Hébuterne became a principal subject for Modigliani&#x27;s art.

In the spring of 1918, the couple moved to the warmer climate of Nice on the French Riviera where Modigliani&#x27;s agent hoped he might raise his profile by selling some of his works to the wealthy art connoisseurs who wintered there. While they were in Nice, their daughter, Jeanne Modigliani, was born on 29 November. Hébuterne faced abuse during her relationship with Modigliani, before becoming pregnant again she was suffering from depression.

The following spring, they returned to Paris and Jeanne became pregnant again. By this time, Modigliani was suffering from tuberculous meningitis and his health, made worse by complications brought on by substance abuse, was deteriorating badly.

== Death ==

On 24 January 1920, Modigliani died, when Jeanne was eight months pregnant with their second child. Hébuterne&#x27;s family brought her to their home, but she threw herself out of the fifth-floor apartment window two days after Modigliani&#x27;s death, killing herself and her unborn child, a son.

Her family, who blamed her demise on Modigliani, interred her in the Cimetière de Bagneux. Nearly ten years later, at the request of Modigliani&#x27;s brother, Emanuele, the Hébuterne family agreed to have her remains transferred to Père Lachaise Cemetery to rest beside Modigliani.

Her epitaph reads: &quot;Devoted companion to the extreme sacrifice.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Their orphaned daughter, Jeanne Modigliani (1918–1984), was adopted by her father&#x27;s sister in Florence, Italy. She grew up knowing virtually nothing of her parents and as an adult began researching their lives. In 1958, she wrote a biography of her father that was published in the English language in the United States as &quot;Modigliani: Man and Myth&quot;. 

It took more than thirty years before an art scholar persuaded the Hébuterne heirs to allow public access to Jeanne Hébuterne&#x27;s artwork. In October 2000, her works were featured at a major Modigliani exhibition in Venice, Italy by the Fondazione Giorgio Cini.

It was revealed in January 2010 that the works presented at the exhibition were forged. Christian Parisot, the curator of the exhibition, had been accused by Hébuterne&#x27;s grandnephew of faking 77 drawings. He was sentenced to a two-year suspended sentence and a €50,000 ($70,000) fine by a French court of appeals.

<doc id="806090" wikidata="Q324470" url="?curid=806090" title="Qara Qoyunlu">
<text>The Qara Qoyunlu or Kara Koyunlu (, ; ), also known as the Black Sheep Turkomans, were a culturally Persianate, Muslim Turkoman monarchy that ruled over the territory comprising present-day Azerbaijan, Armenia, northwestern Iran, eastern Turkey, and northeastern Iraq from about 1374 to 1468.

==History==
=== Etymology ===
The name Qara Qoyunlu literally means &quot;[those with] black sheep&quot;. It has been suggested that this name refers to old totemic symbols, but according to Rashid al-Din Hamadani, the Turks were forbidden to eat the flesh of their totem-animals, and so this is unlikely given the importance of mutton in the diet of pastoral nomads. Another hypothesis is that the name refers to the predominant color of their flocks.

===Origins===
The ruling family descended from the Yıwa tribe of the Oghuz Turks, specifically, the Baharlu, who by the fourteenth century possessed territories north of Lake Van and Mosul in Upper Mesopotamia. The tribes that comprised the Qara Qoyunlu besides Baharlu were the Saadlu in Nakhchevan, the Karamanlu in Ganja and Barda&#x27;a region, the Alpaut and the Agacheri in Mar&#x27;ash, the Dukharlu in the Erzurum-Bayburt region, the Jagirlu in Ardabil region, the Hajilu. According to Faruk Sümer, the Qara Qoyunlu tribe was undoubtedly a sub-tribe (&quot;oba&quot;) of the Oghuz, and Minorsky&#x27;s claim that this subtribe belonged to the Yiwa is probably true.

Duharlu Turkmens, a branch of Qara Qoyunlu first appeared in the &quot;Chronicle&quot; of Michael Panaretos. It is probable that the Duharlu tribe came to Anatolia from Central Asia during the Mongol invasions, as testified by the legendary tradition of Qara Qoyunlu.

===Rise===
The Qara Qoyunlu Turkomans were initially vassals of the Jalayirid Sultanate in Baghdad and Tabriz from about 1375, when the leader of their leading tribe ruled Mosul. However, they rebelled against the Jalayirids and secured their independence from the dynasty with the conquest of Tabriz by Qara Yusuf.

In 1400, the Timurid Empire under Timur defeated the Qara Qoyunlu, and Qara Yusuf fled to Egypt, seeking refuge with the Mamluk Sultanate. Qara Yusuf was welcomed by Sheikh Mahmud, the nāʾib of Damascus. Not long after, the Jalayirid sultan Ahmad Jalayir also came to Damascus. Not wanting to worsen relations with Timur, An-Nasir Faraj agreed to capture Qara Yusuf and Ahmad Jalayir and hand them over to him. Together in prison, the two leaders renewed their friendship, making an agreement that Ahmad Jalayir should keep Baghdad while Qara Yusuf would have Azerbaijan. Ahmad also adopted Qara Yusuf&#x27;s son Pirbudag. When Timur died in 1405, an-Nasir Faraj released them both. However, according to Faruk Sümer, they were released on the orders of rebellious wali of Damascus, Sheykh Mahmud.
Qara Yusuf, having returned from exile, forced Timur&#x27;s governor of Van, Izzaddin Shir, to submit, while capturing Altamış, another viceroy set up by Timur, and sending him to Barquq. He later moved on to the territories of Azerbaijan. He defeated the Timurid Abu Bakr at the Battle of Nakhchivan on 14 October 1406 and reoccupied Tabriz. Abu Bakr and his father Miran Shah tried to recapture Azerbaijan, but on 20 April 1408, Qara Yusuf inflicted a decisive defeat on them at the Battle of Sardrud in which Miran Shah was killed. In 1409 fall, Qara Yusuf entered Tabriz and sent a raiding party to Shirvan, especially Shaki, which was fruitless.

In 1410, the Qara Qoyunlu captured Baghdad. The installation of a subsidiary Qara Qoyunlu line there hastened the downfall of the Jalairids they had once served. Despite internal fighting among Qara Yusuf&#x27;s descendants after his death in 1420, The Qara Qoyunlu state collapsed after Qara Yusif. After the death of Qara Yusuf in December 1420, Shah Rukh tried to take Azerbaijan from Qara Yusuf&#x27;s son Iskander, using the fact that none of his sons was accompanying his father. Despite defeating Iskander, twice in 1420–21 and 1429, only in the third expedition of Shahrukh Mirza in 1434–35 did the Timurids succeed, when he entrusted the government to Iskander&#x27;s own brother, Jahan Shah (1436-1467) as his vassal. In 1436 he obtained the help of Shah Rukh to defeat Iskander and seize the throne for himself. He was also adopted by Gawhar Shad and crowned on 19 April 1438, taking the epithet &quot;Muzaffar al-Din&quot;.

Due to the mistakes of his predecessor, the Timurid Shah Rukh, was the first to convene a party in the palace. They brought the Timurids to the capital. But he went to war with his enemies, the Aq Qoyunlular. Jahanshah Haqiqi died in the battle of Mus. Qara Qoyunlu was almost destroyed. This time Hasanali Mirza came to power, but was killed by Uzun Hasan and the Qara Qoyunlu state collapsed.

===Decline===

In 1410, Armenia fell under the control of the Qara Qoyunlu. The principal Armenian sources available in this period come from the historian Tovma Metsopetsi and several colophons to contemporary manuscripts. According to Tovma, although the Qara Qoyunlu levied heavy taxes against the Armenians, the early years of their rule were relatively peaceful and some reconstruction of towns took place. This peaceful period was, however, shattered with the rise of Qara Iskander, who reportedly made Armenia a &quot;desert&quot; and subjected it to &quot;devastation and plunder, to slaughter, and captivity&quot;. Iskander&#x27;s wars with and eventual defeat by the Timurids invited further destruction in Armenia, as many Armenians were taken captive and sold into slavery and the land was subjected to outright pillaging, forcing many of them to leave the region. Iskander did attempt to reconcile with the Armenians by appointing an Armenian from a noble family, Rustum, as one of his advisers.

When the Timurids launched their final incursion into the region, they convinced Jihanshah, Iskander&#x27;s brother, to turn on his brother. Jihanshah pursued a policy of persecution against the Armenians in Syunik and colophons to Armenian manuscripts record the sacking of the Tatev monastery by his forces. But he, too, sought a &quot;rapprochement&quot; with the Armenians, allotting land to feudal lords, rebuilding churches, and approving the relocation of the seat of the Armenian Apostolic Church&#x27;s Catholicos to Etchmiadzin Cathedral in 1441. For all this, Jihanshah continued to attack Armenian towns and take Armenian captives as the country saw further devastation in the final years of Jihanshah&#x27;s failed struggles with the Aq Qoyunlu.

Jahan Shah made peace with the Timurid Shahrukh Mirza; however, this soon fell apart. When Shahrukh Mirza died in 1447, the Qara Qoyunlu Turkomans annexed portions of Iraq and the eastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula as well as Timurid-controlled western Iran. Though much territory was gained during his rule, Jahān Shāh&#x27;s reign was troubled by his rebellious sons and the almost autonomous rulers of Baghdad, whom he expelled in 1464. In 1466, Jahan Shah attempted to take Diyarbakır from the Aq Qoyunlu (&quot;White Sheep Turkomans&quot;), however, this was a catastrophic failure resulting in Jahān Shāh&#x27;s death and the collapse of the Qara Qoyunlu Turkomans&#x27; control in the Middle East. By 1468, at their height under Uzun Hasan (1452–1478), Aq Qoyunlu defeated the Qara Qoyunlu and conquered Iraq, Azerbaijan, and western Iran.

==Religion==



== Governance ==

The Qara Qoyunlu state organization was based mainly on of its predecessors, Jalayirids, and the Ilkhanids. Qara Qoyunlu rulers used the title sultan since the enthronement of Pirbudag by Qara Yusuf. Sometimes the title bahadur appeared on the coinage. They also used the titles khan, khagan and padishah.

Keeping with a Persianate culture, the Qara Qoyunlu used the Persian language for diplomacy, poetry, and as a court language. Diplomatic letters to the Timurids and Ottomans were written in Persian, while the correspondence with the Mamluk sultans were in Arabic. Official internal documents (farmān, suyūrghāl) were also written in Persian.

As for the provincial organization, the provinces were governed by şehzade and beys, who had smaller divans in each of the provinces. The governance by military governors (beys) generally passed on from father to son. In the cities there were officials called darugha, that looked after financial and administrative affairs, and also had political powers. The şehzades and beys had their own soldiers which were called nökers, who were trained and salaried.

==Culture==
Under Timur, the cultural entity of Iran was renewed by Persian literature, art and culture being patronized throughout the Timurid Empire. Consequently, Qara Qoyunlu art was notably influenced by the Timurids. Jahan Shah wrote his poetry in Azerbaijani and Persian, while the &quot;Kitab-i Diyarbakriyya&quot;, a history of the Qara Qoyunlu and Aq Qoyunlu, was written by Abu Bakr Tehrani in Persian.

<text>is a Japanese manga artist and animation character designer.

==Professional career==
Born in Kumamoto, Kumamoto Prefecture, Sonoda moved to Tokyo in 1984, at the age of 21, and began work at Artmic, an anime studio. During this time, he worked on &quot;Bubblegum Crisis&quot;, producing the original Knight Saber character designs. He also worked on &quot;Gall Force&quot;, for which he did the original character designs.

He worked at Artmic until 1991, when he began work on the manga series &quot;Gunsmith Cats&quot;. &quot;Gunsmith Cats&quot; is one of Sonoda&#x27;s best known works, being both a Harvey and Tezuka award nominee. Sonoda concluded &quot;Gunsmith Cats&quot; run in 1997, when he put the comic on hiatus, and began work on &quot;Cannon God Exaxxion&quot;. In 2004, after finishing &quot;Cannon God Exaxxion&quot;, he returned to work on &quot;Gunsmith Cats&quot;, with the follow-up sequel, &quot;Gunsmith Cats Burst&quot;.

He is currently the 19th head of the &quot;wagashi&quot; confectionery shop &quot;Sonoda-ya&quot; in Kumamoto, established in 1582. Sonoda created a new product, its first in 115 years, by adding lemon peels to his family&#x27;s existing &quot;chōsen-ame&quot; candies and providing his own &quot;bishōjo&quot; illustrations for the packaging.

<text>Ašvieniai are divine twins in the Lithuanian mythology, identical to Latvian Dieva dēli and the Baltic counterparts of Vedic Ashvins. Both names derive from the same Proto-Indo-European root for the horse – &quot;*ék̂wos&quot;: Old Lithuanian ašva and Sanskrit ashva mean &quot;horse&quot;. Like the Greek Dioscuri Castor and Pollux, they are reflexes of a common Indo-European mytheme, the Divine Twins.

Ašvieniai are represented as pulling a carriage of Saulė (the Sun) through the sky. Ašvieniai, depicted as &quot;žirgeliai&quot; or little horses, are common motifs on Lithuanian rooftops, placed for protection of the house. Similar motifs can also be found on beehives, harnesses, bed frames, and other household objects. Ašvieniai are related to Lithuanian Ūsinis and Latvian Ūsiņš (cf. Vedic Ushas), gods of horses. Usins, one of the Ašvieniai, is described as driving a solar chariot pulled across the sky by a pair of white horses.

<text>Léopold Zborowski (1889–1932) was a Polish poet, writer and art dealer. 

==Biography==
He was born in Zaleszczyki, in what was then Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria of Austria-Hungary (now a part of Ukraine), to a Jewish family.

Zborowski and his wife Anna (Hanka Zborowska) were contemporaries with Parisian artists such as Chaïm Soutine, André Derain and Amedeo Modigliani, who painted Zborowski&#x27;s portraits. Léopold Zborowski was Amedeo Modigliani&#x27;s primary art dealer and friend during the artist&#x27;s final years, organizing his expositions and letting the Leghorn (Livorno) artist use his house as an atelier. He also was the first art dealer of René Iché, Chaïm Soutine, Maurice Utrillo, Émile Savitry, Marc Chagall and André Derain. There are three portraits of him by Modigliani, such as a 17&quot; by 10&quot; artwork sold for $1,464,000 at Sotheby&#x27;s in 2003.

As Modigliani&#x27;s art dealer, Zborowski accumulated a small fortune, which he lost during the Great Depression of the 1930s, ultimately dying poor in Paris in 1932 of a heart attack. His widow was forced to sell his whole collection, which is now completely dispersed.

<text>Fuad Rouhani (23 October 1907 – 30 January 2004) () was an Iranian administrator and translator. He served as the first Secretary-General of OPEC between 21 January 1961 and 30 April 1964. He is the only Iranian to hold this office from OPEC&#x27;s establishment to date.

==Biography==
Fuad Rouhani was born in Tehran on 23 October 1907. Rouhani completed his early education in Tehran, and went to work in the oil industry, then under British control.

Rouhani, educated as a lawyer, was born in Iran and trained in London and Paris. Rouhani worked in a company which discovered first and produced oil in the country, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, which later became BP. He advised the Iranian government on its nationalization of the company in 1951, and later advised Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi on oil matters.

He earned two law degrees from the University of London in 1937. A quarter-century later, in the middle of a career in public service, he entered the University of Paris, receiving a doctorate in law in 1968.

He went on to advise the Shah from 1965 to 1968, he was secretary general of the Regional Cooperation for Development organization, which worked to foster economic integration among Iran, Pakistan and Turkey. In 1968 he entered the university of Paris where he was awarded a doctorate in law.

Rouhani, though not religious himself, found time to write &quot;A Guide to the Contents of the Koran,&quot; as well as other books on religion. He also translated into Persian works by Plato and C.G.Jung, among others.

==OPEC career==
When OPEC set up its office in Geneva in 1961 before moving to Vienna Rouhani was elected the organization&#x27;s first secretary general, an administrative post that also involved mediating between conflicting factions. He served for three years, the only Iranian to do so. Currently, Iran is demanding that an Iranian be chosen to fill the current opening.

OPEC&#x27;s success has long been a matter of debate, with many analysts saying that the marketplace and the willingness of one country, Saudi Arabia, to limit output have been the deciding factors in determining oil prices. The oil embargo of 1973 was initiated just by the Arab producers, not OPEC as a whole.

In 1964 Rouhani was succeeded by an Iraqi, Abd ar-Rahman al-Bazzaz, who encouraged talk of both radical politics and Islamic religion.

==Personal life==
Rouhani played the tar, a traditional Persian musical instrument, and was an accomplished pianist and co-founder of the Philharmonic Society of Tehran.

Rouhani was married for 76 years to Rohan, and together they had two daughters, Guitty Hosseinpour and Negar Diba. Negar Diba is married to Kamran Diba, the architect and first cousin to Empress Farah Pahlavi. Guitty Hosseinpour&#x27;s son, Amir Hosseinpour is an international opera director and choreographer of note. After the Iranian revolution of 1979, when Rouhani&#x27;s house and possessions were confiscated, he moved to Geneva, and later to London where he died aged 96.

<doc id="806114" wikidata="Q307459" url="?curid=806114" title="Abdul-Rahman al-Bazzaz">
<text>Abdul Rahman al-Bazzaz (Arabic: عبد الرحمن البزاز; 20 February 1913 – 28 June 1973) was an Iraqi politician, reformist and writer who served as prime minister of Iraq from 1965 to 1966 and as the interim president in 1966. 

A pan-Arab nationalist politician, Al-Bazzaz served as the Dean of Baghdad Law College prior to his appointment as prime minister. His main political project was the professionalization of the government through increasing access to civilian expertise. That civic agenda came at the expense of the military. Following the 1968 coup in Iraq, Al-Bazzaz was charged by the Ba&#x27;athist government for participating in dissident activities against the government, and he was tortured and imprisoned for fifteen months. Al-Bazzaz was released because of illness in 1970 and moved to London for treatment. He died in Baghdad on 28 June 1973.

==Early life and education==
Abd al-Rahman al-Bazzaz was born to a Sunni Muslim family in Baghdad. His brother was the plant ecologist, Fakhri A. Bazzaz.

He completed both elementary school and high school in Baghdad. Al-Bazzaz graduated from the Baghdad Law College in 1934. In 1938 Al-Bazzaz completed his law studies at King&#x27;s College London. During the 1930s, he became an affiliate of the Muthanna and Jawwal clubs, the academic focus of which was pan-Arabism and encouraging Arab nationalism. The Muthanna Club was established in Baghdad in 1935 and was an influential radical pan-Arab and pan-Islamist fascist society which collapsed with the Rashid Ali al-Gaylani rebellion. In 1941, al-Bazzaz supported the 1941 Iraqi coup d&#x27;état. After the coup failed, al-Bazzaz was incarcerated during the Second World War but he was released at the end of the war.

==Academic career==
After the war, al-Bazzaz was chosen as the dean of the Baghdad Law College. In 1956 he was forced out of this role by the government for protesting against the invasion of Egypt by France, Britain and Israel. He signed a petition that was very critical of the Iraqi government&#x27;s stand during the Suez crisis under the premiership of Nuri as-Said, a staunch opponent of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser. Al-Bazzaz returned to the Baghdad Law College as the dean after the revolution in 1958. Al-Bazzaz&#x27;s interest in the pan-Arab movement again put him into disagreement with the government, this time with the new government of Abd al-Karim Qasim (1958–1963), an Iraqi nationalist aligned with communist forces. In 1959 Colonel ‘Abd al-Wahhab al-Shawwaf, who was the Commander of the Mosul Garrison, instigated a rebellion. After four days of fighting, he was killed and the uprising was crushed. Following the collapse of the Shawwaf uprising, al-Bazzaz was arrested and tortured. After his release, al-Bazzaz went to Egypt, where he became the dean of the Institute of Arab Studies at the Arab League.

Al-Bazzaz was a prolific writer. He published more than twelve books about law, Iraq&#x27;s history, Arab nationalism and Islam. In his writings, he saw no obvious contradiction between Arab nationalism and Islam. Arab nationalism was not based on race or solidarity of blood. It was based on ties of language, history, spirituality and basic interests in life. In addition to being a religious belief, Islam was viewed as a social system, a philosophy of life, a system of economics and of government.

Al-Bazzaz strongly promoted the rule of law and wanted to see an end to military officers dominating Iraq&#x27;s politics as they had since the revolution in July 1958. 

==Political career==


Al-Bazzaz returned to Iraq after the military overthrew the Qasim administration in 1963. From 1963 to 1966, President Abd al-Salam Arif appointed al-Bazzaz to several government positions. He was selected as ambassador to the United Arab Republic and later he became the ambassador to England. In 1964 and 1965, he was the secretary-general of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. In September 1965, he was appointed as deputy prime minister. The then prime minister, Arif Abd ar-Razzaq, tried to start a revolt and seize power. However he was unsuccessful and President Arif invited al-Bazzaz to form a new government. Al-Bazzaz was the first civilian prime minister of Iraq.

During his time as prime minister, Al-Bazzaz&#x27;s government became increasingly controlled by civilian politicians. He replaced the Revolutionary Military Council with the National Defence Council and limited its functions to defence and internal security. The political system was open compared with previous regimes. As prime minister, Al-Bazzaz held numerous news conferences and appeared on radio and television. Constructive criticism was encouraged, and he promised to restore parliamentary life and hold elections as soon as possible.

Al-Bazzaz announced the First Five Year Plan which advocated prudent socialism and attempted to balance the public and private sectors. He advocated joint ventures between the public and private sectors as well as between foreign and domestic investors. He favoured a theory of prudent socialism which sought to increase production without abandoning equal distribution.

Another policy that al-Bazzaz tried to institute was the formal recognition of the Kurds. This was to be achieved through a twelve-point agreement whose purpose was to provide constitutional recognition to the Kurds and to recognize Kurdish as an official language of Iraq. The plan was to hold a parliamentary election within the period mandated in the provisional constitution of 1964. It provided for representation of the Kurds in all branches of the government. It gave the Kurds the right to organise their own political parties and publish their own newspapers. However, al-Bazzaz was forced to resign in August 1966 so the agreement was never signed.

President Arif died suddenly in April 1966 in a plane crash, and al-Bazzaz became acting president for three days. A power struggle for the presidency occurred. In the first meeting of the Defence Council and Cabinet to elect a president, Al-Bazzaz needed a two-thirds majority to win the presidency. Al-Bazzaz was unsuccessful in achieving this goal and Abd al-Rahman Arif was elected as president. He asked al-Bazzaz to form a new cabinet in April 1966. However, al-Bazzaz was then pressured to resign by various political groups, including the Ba&#x27;athists. The leaders of these groups were military officers who were against al-Bazzaz&#x27;s goal to reduce military salaries, privileges and power.

The Ba&#x27;athists and Nasserists accused al-Bazzaz of being an adversary of Arab socialism and being against the proposed union of Egypt and Iraq. In January 1969, he was charged by the Ba&#x27;athist government with participation in activities against the government. He was tortured and imprisoned for fifteen months. In 1970, he was released from jail because he became ill and he went to London for treatment. He later died in Baghdad on 28 June 1973.

<doc id="806118" wikidata="Q55930" url="?curid=806118" title="Hanna Suchocka">
<text>Hanna Stanisława Suchocka (; born 3 April 1946) is a Polish political figure, lawyer, professor at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań and Chair of the Constitutional Law Department, former First Vice-President and Honorary President of the Venice Commission.

She served as the Prime Minister of Poland between 8 July 1992 and 26 October 1993 under the presidency of Lech Wałęsa. She is the first woman to hold this post in Poland (preceding Ewa Kopacz and Beata Szydło who both held the post in the 2010s) and was the 14th woman to be appointed and serve as Prime Minister in the world.

==Early life==
Suchocka was born in Pleszew, Poland, in a Catholic family of chemists. Her grandfather was a university teacher and her grandmother Anna became a member of the first Polish parliament for Poznań after independence in 1918 when women got the right to vote. Suchocka went to law school and became a researcher at the University of Poznań (UAM), gaining a PhD in Constitutional Law. Later she worked as a reader in law at Lublin university and for most of her professional life at a facility of the Polish academy of sciences in Poznań until 2013. She gained a habilitation at UAM in 2015.

==Political career==
In 1969, she joined a small non-Marxist &#x27;satellite party&#x27;, the Democratic Party (SD), and was a member of parliament the Sejm of People&#x27;s Republic of Poland in 1980–1985. At the same time, she was a member and a legal advisor to &quot;Solidarity&quot;. She was one of only a few MPs who did not to vote in favour of martial law in 1981 and the criminalisation of &quot;Solidarity&quot; in 1984. The party suspended her (or she resigned), but with the support of &quot;Solidarity&quot;, she was re-elected to parliament in 1989. When Solidarity supporters split up into several political parties, Suchocka joined the centre-liberal Democratic Union (DU) and was re-elected to parliament in 1991.

==Prime Minister of Poland (1992-1993)==

She became Prime Minister in 1992. Governments at the time were based on various coalitions and changed constantly. Suchocka was chosen to the amazement of many male politicians but she was known for her low profile and willingness to make compromises and promote reconciliation. She could be accepted by people who had an antipathy towards more prominent leaders of DU. In addition, as a liberal, while being opposed to abortion as a Catholic, she could be accepted by both sides of the political spectrum and satisfy the interests of a majority in a parliament consisting of seven parties, including a Christian and a liberal party.

Hanna Suchocka declared that her government was for social reconciliation and would lead the country forward in the transformation from communism to capitalism. She was approved by 233 against 61 votes and 113 abstentions She quickly formed a cabinet, but it didn&#x27;t include any other female ministers, although she wanted them. None of the coalition partners was willing to accept another woman and she got two male deputy prime ministers. She stayed longer as prime minister than any of her four predecessors, but she did not stay long. There was a wave of strikes and Suchocka was a warm supporter of market reforms and followed a hard line against the strikers. When she wouldn&#x27;t give salary increases to teachers and health workers, parliament passed a vote of no-confidence by a majority of one vote. Wałęsa dissolved parliament and held new elections. Before the early 1993 parliamentary elections, Suchocka&#x27;s government signed a concordat with the Holy See, which was the object of charges of the successful Democratic Left Alliance, which criticized the fact that the concordat had signed a cabinet without a parliamentary mandate. Suchocka resigned as soon as the new parliament was in place.

==Later career==

In 1994, Hanna Suchocka was one of the founders of a liberal and social-democratic Liberty Union party, which became the country&#x27;s third-largest political force. From 1997 to 2000 she was the minister of justice in a coalition government. Suchocka&#x27;s candidacy stirred controversy amongst some of the activists who co-founded the Solidarity Electoral Action (AWS) and Centre Agreement (PC). In August 1997, former Interior Minister Zbigniew Siemiątkowski accused Suchocka&#x27;s government of allowing alleged surveillance of opposition political parties. On 8 June 2000, the entire Freedom Union (UW) left the coalition after weeks of negotiations failed to find an acceptable replacement for Jerzy Buzek (whom the Freedom Union accused of failing to push through economic reforms).

She is also a member of the Club of Madrid.

Hanna Suchocka is a member of the Council of Women World Leaders, an international network of current and former women presidents and prime ministers whose mission is to mobilize the highest-level women leaders globally for collective action on issues of critical importance to women and equitable development.

She served as Poland&#x27;s Ambassador to the Holy See from 2002 to 2013. She was also a member of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences in the Vatican (appointed by Pope John Paul II on 19 January 1994).

In April 2014 Suchocka was among the 8 initial appointees of Pope Francis to the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors.

<doc id="806123" wikidata="Q2084125" url="?curid=806123" title="Nursing diagnosis">
<text>A nursing diagnosis may be part of the nursing process and is a clinical judgment about individual, family, or community experiences/responses to actual or potential health problems/life processes. Nursing diagnoses foster the nurse&#x27;s independent practice (e.g., patient comfort or relief) compared to dependent interventions driven by physician&#x27;s orders (e.g., medication administration). Nursing diagnoses are developed based on data obtained during the nursing assessment. A problem-based nursing diagnosis presents a problem response present at time of assessment. Risk diagnoses represent vulnerabilities to potential problems, and health promotion diagnoses identify areas which can be enhanced to improve health. Whereas a medical diagnosis identifies a disorder, a nursing diagnosis identifies the unique ways in which individuals respond to health or life processes or crises. The nursing diagnostic process is unique among others. A nursing diagnosis integrates patient involvement, when possible, throughout the process. 
 NANDA International (NANDA-I) is body of professionals that develops, researches and refines an official taxonomy of nursing diagnosis.

All nurses must be familiar with the steps of the nursing process in order to gain the most efficiency from their positions. In order to correctly diagnose, the nurse must make quick and accurate inferences from patient data during assessment, based on knowledge of the nursing discipline and concepts of concern to nurses.

==NANDA International==
&quot;NANDA International, Inc.&quot;, formerly known as the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association, is the primary organization for defining, researching, revising, distributing and integrating standardized nursing diagnoses worldwide. NANDA-I has worked in this area for more than 45 years to ensure that diagnoses are developed through a peer-reviewed process requiring standardised levels of evidence, definitions, defining characteristics, related factors or risk factors that enable nurses to identify potential diagnoses in the course of a nursing assessment. NANDA-I believes that it is critical that nurses are required to utilise standardised languages that provide not just terms (diagnoses) but the embedded knowledge from clinical practice and research that provides diagnostic criteria (definitions, defining characteristics) and the related or etiologic factors upon which nurses intervene. NANDA-I terms are developed and refined for actual (current) health responses and for risk situations, as well as providing diagnoses to support health promotion. Diagnoses are applicable to individuals, families, groups and communities. The taxonomy is published in multiple countries and has been translated into 18 languages; it is in use worldwide. As research in the field of nursing continues to grow, NANDA-I continually develops and adds new diagnostic labels.

Nursing diagnoses are a critical part of ensuring that the knowledge and contribution of nursing practice to patient outcomes are found within the electronic health record and can be linked to nurse-sensitive patient outcomes.

==Global==
The ICNP (International Classification for Nursing Practice) published by the International Council of Nurses has been accepted by the World Health Organization family of classifications. ICNP is a nursing language which can be used by nurses to diagnose.

==Structure==
The NANDA-I system of nursing diagnosis provides for four categories and each has 3 parts: diagnostic label or the human response, related factors or the cause of the response, and defining characteristics found in the selected patient are the signs/symptoms present that are supporting the diagnosis.
#Problem-focused diagnosis
#:A clinical judgment about human experience/responses to health conditions/life processes that exist in an individual, family, or community. An example of an actual nursing diagnosis is: &quot;Sleep deprivation.&quot;
#Risk diagnosis
#:Describes human responses to health conditions/life processes that may develop in a vulnerable individual/family/community. It is supported by risk factors that contribute to increased vulnerability. An example of a risk diagnosis is: &quot;Risk for shock.&quot;
#Health promotion diagnosis
#:A clinical judgment about a person&#x27;s, family&#x27;s or community&#x27;s motivation and desire to increase wellbeing and actualise human health potential as expressed in the readiness to enhance specific health behaviours, and can be used in any health state. An example of a health promotion diagnosis is: &quot;Readiness for enhanced nutrition.&quot;
#Syndrome diagnosis
#:A clinical judgment describing a specific cluster of nursing diagnoses that occur together, and are best addressed together and through similar interventions. An example of a syndrome diagnosis is: &quot;Relocation stress syndrome.&quot;

==Process==

The diagnostic process requires a nurse to use critical thinking. In addition to knowing the nursing diagnoses and their definitions, the nurse becomes aware of defining characteristics and behaviors of the diagnoses, related factors to the diagnoses, and the interventions suited for treating the diagnoses.

#Assessment
#: The first step of the nursing process is assessment. During this phase, the nurse gathers information about a patient&#x27;s psychological, physiological, sociological, and spiritual status. This data can be collected in a variety of ways. Generally, nurses will conduct a patient interview. Physical examinations, referencing a patient&#x27;s health history, obtaining a patient&#x27;s family history, and general observation can also be used to gather assessment data. Patient interaction is generally the heaviest during this evaluative stage.
#Diagnosis
#: The diagnosing phase involves a nurse making an educated judgement about a potential or actual health problem with a patient. Multiple diagnoses are sometimes made for a single patient. These assessments not only include a description of the problem or illness (e.g. sleep deprivation) but also whether or not a patient is at risk of developing further problems. These diagnoses are also used to determine a patient&#x27;s readiness for health improvement and whether or not they may have developed a syndrome. The diagnoses phase is a critical step as it is used to determine the course of treatment.
#Planning
#: Once a patient and nurse agree of the diagnoses, a plan of action can be developed. If multiple diagnoses need to be addressed, the head nurse will prioritise each assessment and devote attention to severe symptoms and high risk patients. Each problem is assigned a clear, measurable goal for the expected beneficial outcome. For this phase, nurses generally refer to the evidence-based Nursing Outcome Classification, which is a set of standardised terms and measurements for tracking patient wellness. The Nursing Interventions Classification may also be used as a resource for planning.
#Implementation
#: The implementing phase is where the nurse follows through on the decided plan of action. This plan is specific to each patient and focuses on achievable outcomes. Actions involved in a nursing care plan include monitoring the patient for signs of change or improvement, directly caring for the patient or performing necessary medical tasks, educating and instructing the patient about further health management, and referring or contacting the patient for a follow-up. Implementation can take place over the course of hours, days, weeks, or even months.
#Evaluation
#: Once all nursing intervention actions have taken place, the nurse completes an evaluation to determine if the goals for patient wellness have been met. The possible patient outcomes are generally described under three terms: patient&#x27;s condition improved, patient&#x27;s condition stabilised, and patient&#x27;s condition deteriorated. In the event where the condition of the patient has shown no improvement, or if the wellness goals were not met, the nursing process begins again from the first step.

==Examples==

The following are nursing diagnoses arising from the nursing literature with varying degrees of authentication by ICNP or NANDA-I standards.

*Anxiety
*Constipation
*Pain
*Decreased Activity Tolerance
*Impaired Gas Exchange
*Excessive Fluid Volume
*Caregiver Role Strain
*Ineffective Coping
*Readiness for Enhanced Health Maintenance
*Readiness for enhanced spiritual well-being

<doc id="806128" wikidata="Q1288390" url="?curid=806128" title="Label Distribution Protocol">
<text>Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) is a protocol in which routers capable of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) exchange label mapping information. Two routers with an established session are called LDP peers and the exchange of information is bi-directional.
LDP is used to build and maintain label-switched path (LSP) databases that are used to forward traffic through MPLS networks.

LDP can be used to distribute the inner label (VC/VPN/service label) and outer label (path label) in MPLS. For inner label distribution, targeted LDP (tLDP) is used.

LDP and tLDP discovery runs on UDP port 646 and the session is built on TCP port 646. During the discovery phase hello packets are sent on UDP port 646 to the &#x27;all routers on this subnet&#x27; group multicast address (224.0.0.2). However, tLDP unicasts the hello packets to the targeted neighbor&#x27;s address. 

==LDP==
The Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) is a protocol defined by the IETF (RFC 5036) for the purpose 
of distributing labels in an MPLS environment. LDP relies on the underlying routing information provided by an IGP in order to forward label packets. The router forwarding information base, or FIB, is responsible for determining the 
hop-by-hop path through the network. 
Unlike traffic-engineered paths, which use constraints and explicit routes to establish end-to-end LSPs, LDP is used only for signaling best-effort LSPs.

===Authentication===

LDP sessions carried over TCP can be authenticated using the &quot;TCP MD5 Authentication Option&quot;. While the IETF considers the &quot;TCP MD5 Authentication Option&quot; deprecated in favor of the algorithm-independent &quot;TCP Authentication Option&quot;, in practice the &quot;TCP MD5 Authentication Option&quot; is much more widely available in commercial routers as of July 2023. Use of authenticated LDP-over-TCP helps provide strong integrity protection against misconfigured would-be LDP peers.

==T-LDP==

Targeted LDP sessions are different because during the discovery phase hellos are unicast to the LDP peer rather than using multicast. A consequence of this is that tLDP can be set up between non-directly connected peers whereas non-targeted LDP peers must be on the same subnet. tLDP may still be used between connected peers if desired.

On a router running TiMOS when an SDP (Service Distribution Path) is configured, automatic ingress and egress labeling (targeted LDP) is enabled by default and ingress and egress &quot;service&quot; labels are signaled over a TLDP connection. If signaling is turned off on an SDP, ingress and egress “service” labels must be manually configured when the SDP is bound to a service.

==RSVP-TE==

This method determines a path through the network based on the interior gateway protocol&#x27;s view of the network. If no constraints are applied to the LSP then the routers simply send the request for a path to the active next hop for that destination, without explicit routing. The IGP at each router is free to select active next hops based on the link state database.

<doc id="806129" wikidata="Q761156" url="?curid=806129" title="Honda XR series">
<text>The Honda XR series is a range of four-stroke off-road motorcycles that were designed in Japan but assembled all over the world.

Some of the XR series came in two versions: R and L. The R version bikes were enduro machines designed for off-road competitive riding. They were fitted with knobby off-road tires and were not always street legal. The L version models were dual-sport trailbikes, fitted with lights, indicators, horn, and street-legal tires.

== Small XR models ==

Small XR models include the XR50R, XR70R, XR75R, XR80R and XR100R. They are much smaller in size in comparison to the other bikes in the series, and are designed for children, smaller riders, as pit bikes, or for recreational fun.

The XR80R was used in the film Terminator 2: Judgment Day, ridden by a young John Connor ( Edward Furlong ). In some scenes the taller XR100R (VIN H2HE0309LK900900) is the motorcycle from those sequences. is used as Furlong&#x27;s stunt double was an adult man. The sound effects are that of a two-stroke engine for dramatic effect.

The XR50 is a small four-stroke child&#x27;s entry level motorcycle, introduced in 1969 and still in production as the CRF50 in 2021. Originally it was called the Z-50, then Trail-50, the XR 50, CRF 50, and the mini dirt bike.

== XR100R ==
The XR100R was first introduced with the R designation in 1985, four years after the XR100 was brought to market. A major difference between the two was a major rear suspension upgrade to a more race-like single coil-over design (monoshock) and a new swingarm over the traditional dual real coil-over systems on the XR100. This suspension system was known as the Pro-Link system on Hondas.

== XR 125L ==

In some markets, an XR125L was released in 2003. The engine generates at 4,500&amp;;rpm, Only the 2010 XR125L has a kick starter.
The XR 125L shares the same basic engine (JC30E) as the Honda CG125ES but with a few differences (the XR125L variant of the JC30E engine has larger diameter mounting holes in the engine casing, an engine mount on the cylinder head, and a longer counter shaft in the transmission to support wider rear wheels), and produces a maximum torque of 7 ft-lb, the top speed in real world conditions is between with a fuel consumption of about .

In Brazil, this model was named NXR 125 Bros.

== XR 150L ==

The XR 150L was released in 2014. The 150cc 4-stroke, single-cylinder, air-cooled, OHC engine generates at 7,750&amp;;rpm, Electric and kick starter.
The XR 150 produces maximum torque of 12.5Nm at 6000 rpm; the top speed in real world conditions is between with a fuel consumption of about . It has a 5-speed gearbox. It has front wheel and rear wheel. It has a 12-litre fuel tank and luggage rack as standard. In many countries it can be road-registered but not Australia. Curb weight is 130 kg. It has a front disc brake and rear drum brake. A more recent version is the 2023 XR150L released in early 2023 for $2971 new. It has a four stroke engine, long travel suspension, and an electric starter.

== XR 190L ==

The XR 190L was released in 2019. The engine 4-stroke, single-cylinder, air-cooled, OHC fuel-injected engine generates at 8,500rpm, Electric and kick starter.
The XR 190L produces Max torque of 15.6Nm @ 6000 RPM, the top speed in real world conditions is between with a fuel consumption of about . Other than the larger engine capacity over the XR150L, the XR190L has Fuel Injection. It has a 5 speed gearbox. It has 21 inch front wheel and 18 inch rear wheel. It has a 12-litre fuel tank and luggage rack as standard. In many countries it can be road registered including Australia. Kerb weight is 137 kg. It has a front disc brake and rear drum brake. In some international markets, there is an agricultural version of the XR19L, rebadged to be a XR190AG aimed at farmers for Australia and New Zealand with additional racks and lowered gearing. 

A derivative for South America, named XRE 190, has electric start only, and disc brakes featuring single-channel ABS on the front wheel.

== XR 200 ==

The XR200, a development of the XL185 trail bike, was produced from 1980 until 1984. The XR200 had a modestly enlarged ohc 2-valve 6-speed air-cooled engine with kick-start only. Suspension was conventional, like the XL185s, but with better quality components and more travel. Although the XR200 power output was modest, the bike was small and light and it suited less experienced riders. Due to its lightness, easy handling and good ground clearance, the XR200 was competitive as a clubman&#x27;s enduro machine. Drum brakes were fitted front and rear. Having neither battery nor electric start, the driving lights shone only when the engine was running. For the 1979 model year only, there was an XR185 sold in some markets.

== XR 200R ==

The Honda XR 200R had the same engine of its predecessor, the XR200. This oversquare two-valve engine had a 10:1 compression ratio. A major advance over the XR200, the XR200R had Pro-Link rear suspension, and heavier duty frame and forks, and was a tougher enduro machine.

For the 1984-85 model years, the XR200 had a smaller version of the same 4 valve RFVC engine as the other XRs in the line up. The 200cc RFVC engine shared many parts with the 250cc RFVC engine. For the 1986 model year, Honda reverted to the 2 valve engine that had powered the XR200R before 1984 and variations of the 2 valve engine continued to power the XR200R until the model was dropped altogether. The 1991 model was the best performance wise.

Brazilian versions of the XR 200R were introduced in 1992 and remained on production until 2001 for the domestic market and at least until 2015 for export, always fitted with the 2-valve engine, electric start and front disc brake. At least in Australia, the Brazilian-made model was rebadged CTX200 and fitted with a &quot;cheater sprocket&quot; to get an overall lower gear ratio more suitable to the needs of agricultural operators and was not roadworthy as supplied.

== XR 230/250R ==
The XR250R was introduced pre 1981 and was originally equipped with a variation of the engine that had powered the XL250S since 1978. For 1983 the model was dropped from Honda&#x27;s line-up, but came back in 1984 with a completely new engine dubbed the &quot;Radial Four Valve Chamber&quot; (RFVC) engine. The original RFVC engine had a bore and stroke of , but in 1986 this was changed to . 1986 also saw the adoption of a large, single carburetor rather than the dual progressively opening carburetors of the 84-85 models. In 1996 the engine of the XR 250R, the mainstay of the XR range, was updated and now produced at 8100 rpm. Changes included a new crankcase with better engine mounts (which incorporated the swingarm pivot) for a stiffer chassis, smaller exhaust valves to address a problem with cracking cylinder heads, and an improved automatic decompressor for easier starting. Although the XR250R was always quite heavy compared to its 2 stroke competition and both front and rear suspension were rather basic, it proved reliable and likable and was successful as an entry-level off-road machine. The XR250R was discontinued after 2004.

== US XR 250L ==
This street version of the XR250R was built to conform to USA Department of Transportation regulations for street legal motorcycles, but was sold worldwide. It had road legal lights and tires, a steel fuel tank, keyed ignition/steering lock, lower seat height and other minor changes. Some heavier, it had reduced off-road ability. It shared the XR250R&#x27;s RFVC engine, but with a different carburetor and smaller exhaust headers to meet emissions requirements. It was manufactured from 1991 to 2007.

There was a Brazilian equivalent named XR 250 Tornado made from 2001 to 2009 (until 2012 for export) for the local market and regional exports to other South American countries but also available in Mexico and Central America. Its engine was the same 4-valve DOHC air-cooled single fitted to the CBX 250 Twister/CBF 250, but the exhaust was dimensioned to improve low-end torque with the sacrifice of 1 hp resulting in a 23 hp rating.

== XR250 (MD30) / XR250L ==
An electric start street version of the XR250R was sold in Asia as the XR250 and Australia as the XR250L. The Honda model designator for it is MD30. It&#x27;s based on the 1996-2004 model XR250R but with different suspension, fuel tank, rear subframe, electrical system, carburettor, cam shaft and most significantly the addition of electric start. There were two variants of the bike a single headlight version that looks more like the standard XR250R and a dual headlight &quot;Baja&quot; version.

== XR 350R ==
The XR 350R was introduced for the 1983 model year and discontinued after the 1985 model year. The 1983 and 1984 models were wet sump engines with a bore and stroke of and a displacement of . The 1985 engine had a dry sump, a stroke of 63.8 mm and displacement of . The wrist pin diameter was reduced from 21 mm to 19 mm and the dual progressive carburetors of the 83-84 models were replaced by a single large carburetor.

== XR 400R ==

The XR 400R was introduced in 1996. Its frame, plastics and suspension components were similar to those of the XR250R, and it had a similar air-cooled engine with RFVC cylinder head technology. The XR400R had more suspension travel and a longer wheelbase than the XR250R of the same year. Many XR400Rs were heavily modified and raced. The 400 was perhaps the most versatile of the XR line-up; many were raced in amateur motocross and enduro events. Equipped with street-legal lighting it also worked reasonably well as a dual purpose bike. It was simple, reliable and long lasting. Hard to break and easy to fix. In 2004 Honda discontinued the XR400R.

== XR 400M ==
The XR 400M was introduced in 2005, and whilst having a similar engine to the XR 400R, the exhaust diameter is smaller and has a slightly lower power output. It was sold as a factory motard, with road wheels and tyres, electric start, and updated faux radiator fairings.

==XR 500 / XR 500R==

Introduced in 1979, the twin-shock Honda XR 500 was the first &quot;XR&quot; model. The engine was a four-stroke, four-valve OHC, &quot;Pentroof&quot; engine. The bike had a conventional 18&quot; rear wheel but an unusual 23&quot; front wheel which was supposed to be better for riding over potholes and ruts. The 23&quot; size proved unpopular and did not catch on as the wheel/tyre assembly was heavy, and there was little choice of replacement 23&quot; tyres.

In 1981 Honda introduced &#x27;Pro-Link’ models, with rising-rate single-shock rear suspension, a 17&quot; rear wheel and a 21&quot; front wheel. Unusual for a four-stroke with its typical intake and exhaust valves, the 1981 and 1982 XR-500 utilized a six-petal reed valve set-up between the carburetor and the intake valves. This was intended to provide better low-end performance while still allowing a large carburetor to be used. The 1982 XR 500RC was very similar to the 1981 RB apart from decal and trim changes.


The 1983 XR500R was thoroughly revised with a new dry-sump RFVC 5-speed engine which was lighter and more powerful than the older engine. Induction was by 2 carburetors, the first in use until 1/4 throttle, whereupon the second started to take effect. Power was 41 hp @6000 rpm, torque was 4.7 kg-m (34 lb-ft) at 5500 rpm, and dry weight was 266.7 lbs. The frame was entirely revised, and suspension was updated with 43mm air-adjustable forks with 11&quot; of suspension travel both front and rear. Wheels were 21&quot; front and 17&quot; rear. The fuel tank had a 12-litre capacity, the front brake was a single hydraulic disc, and the handlebars sported plastic ‘bark-buster’ hand protectors.

The 1984 XR500RE model was the last 500cc XR, being superseded in 1985 by the larger Honda XR 600RF.

==XR 600R==
The XR 600R was used in Baja races. It was introduced in 1985, and was updated in 1988 when the original dual progressively opening carburetors were replaced with a larger single carburetor and the rear brake was updated to a disc. The &quot;600&quot; was updated again in 1992. The XR won many desert races in the hands of Johnny Campbell and GNCC races in the hands of Scott Summers. Its engine was very similar to the XR 400 and XR 250 engines, (though larger and heavier). 600&#x27;s responded well to modification. A common modification was to bore the cylinder to 100mm thereby increasing displacement to 628cc. HRC produced a &quot;Power Up&quot; kit that included a billet 100mm piston, a revised primary gear ratio (identical to that used later in the XR650L) and a hotter camshaft. XR600R&#x27;s so modified were used by the Honda race team in Baja, as well as by many other desert racers.

==XR 650R==

Introduced in 2000, the XR 650R was not just an update to the XR 600—it was a totally new bike. An all-new , liquid-cooled, SOHC engine was mated to an aluminum box frame. At dry, it weighed more than the XR600R which it replaced, but was built very strong and the engine was immensely powerful. Honda was obviously aiming squarely at the long range desert racing market with this bike. Team Honda and the XR650R posted many definitive Baja 1000 wins during its production cycle, and many other desert race wins with Scott Summers and Johnny Campbell at the helm. Cancelled for the 2008 production year, the &#x27;Big Red Pig (BRP)&#x27; enjoys a loyal following among Honda fans today, and remains one of the most competitive, open class 4-stroke enduro motorcycles available.

== XR 650L ==
The Honda XR650L is a street/trail bike that is more similar to the XR 600R than to the XR 650R. It has a steel tube frame as opposed to an aluminum spar frame like in the XR 650R. It also has an air-cooled SOHC dry-sump single-cylinder four-stroke engine similar except for an increased displacement to the XR 600R, unlike the totally redesigned XR 650R that has a liquid-cooled SOHC dry-sump single-cylinder four-stroke engine.
The engine first appeared in the NX650 Dominator in 1988 which makes it the longest produced RFVC engine made by Honda. With a headlight, taillight, turn signals, mirrors, smog system, revised exhaust system and a 2.8 gallon gas tank with 0.6 gal reserve, the 650L has a wet weight.

The Honda XR650L is one of the longest running unchanged production models in the history of motorcycling and is still available today exactly as the 1992 model specifications.

==XRV650==

The Honda XRV650 (produced from 1988 to 1989) was the second twin cylinder production trail bike by Honda, the first one being the Honda XLV750R produced from 1983 to 1986. It was the first twin cylinder model in the XR series and as such started the XRV series, but it was soon replaced by the Honda XRV750 in 1990. The &quot;650cc&quot; model was built in Japan by Honda Racing Corporation and is arguably a better built bike than following versions of XRVs, which were standard production models. It came as both single and double headlight variations, and featured a slightly tuned 650cc engine similar to the Honda Transalp (XL600V and XL650V) and high specification chassis components, leading to its rather brief production run. With an aftermarket larger capacity tank and very few other modifications the bike was entered in the marathon class of the Paris Dakar Rally, revealing its surprisingly good off-road abilities - despite its 200 kg weight, hence it belongs firmly to the XR range. It is the most sought after model of the Africa Twin XRV range and is fast becoming a collector&#x27;s item, especially in Europe.

<doc id="806134" wikidata="Q674128" url="?curid=806134" title="Giovanni Lanza">
<text>Domenico Giovanni Giuseppe Maria Lanza (15 February 1810 9 March 1882) was an Italian politician and the eighth prime minister of Italy from 1869 to 1873.

==Biography==
Lanza was born in the Piedmontese city of Casale Monferrato. He studied medicine in Turin, the capital of the Kingdom of Sardinia, then returned to Casale where he divided his energies between practising medicine and developing his 33-hectare estate in nearby Roncaglia. He studied and wrote on agricultural developments in both the practical and social aspects. Lanza was among the first in Monferrato to introduce such modern equipment as iron ploughs and seed drills, and also involved himself in the agricultural education of poor children, hoping to achieve at once “the betterment of our agriculture and the moral and intellectual betterment of our agricultural workers.”

Lanza was also an active member of the Subalpine Agricultural Association of Turin and became its secretary. The association was concerned about reforming the political and economic spheres, as well as agriculture, and its identification with the cause of liberal nationalism—with the &quot;Risorgimento&quot;—was underlined at the September 1847 agrarian congress in Casale, when Lanza raised the cry of &quot;Viva l&#x27;Italia libera ed indipendente!&quot; Later he commented on that event: &quot;I did not join the association purely to improve the cultivation of cabbages&quot;., 

==Parliamentary collaboration with Cavour==

Lanza took an active part in the uprising of 1848 and was elected to the Piedmont Parliament that same year. He attached himself to the party of Cavour and devoted his attention chiefly to questions of the economy and finance. He became minister of education in 1855 in the Cavour cabinet, and in 1858 minister of finance. He was minister of the interior (1864–1865) in the La Marmora cabinet, and arranged the transfer of the capital to Florence. He maintained a resolute opposition to the financial policies of Menabrea, who resigned in 1869 when Lanza was elected for the second time as President of the Chamber.

==Prime Minister of Italy==

Lanza formed a new cabinet in which he appointed himself minister of the interior. With Quintino Sella as minister of finance, he sought to reorganize the Italian budget and resigned from office when Sella&#x27;s projects were rejected in 1873. 

===Legacy in the Unification of Italy===

His cabinet had seen the accomplishment of Italian unity and the installation of an Italian government in Rome after the defeat of the Papal States in late 1870.

<doc id="806135" wikidata="Q514410" url="?curid=806135" title="Stefano Jacini (politician, born 1826)">
<text>Count Stefano Jacini (Casalbuttano, 20 June 1826 – Milan, 15 March 1891) was an Italian statesman and economist.

Born at Casalbuttano, Jacini was descended from an old and wealthy Lombard family. He studied in Switzerland, at Milan, and in German universities. During the period of the Austrian restoration in Lombardy (1849–1859) he devoted himself to literary and economic studies. For his work on &quot;La Proprietà fondiaria in Lombardia&quot; (Milan, 1856) he received a prize from the Milanese &quot;Società d&#x27;incoraggiamento di scienze e lettere&quot; and was made a member of the Istituto Lombardo. In another work, &quot;Sulle condizioni economiche della Valtellina&quot; (Milan, 1858, translated into English by W. E. Gladstone), he exposed the evils of Austrian rule, and he drew up a report on the general conditions of Lombardy and Venetia for Cavour.

He was minister of Public Works under Cavour in 1860–1861, in 1864 under La Marmora, and down to 1867 under Bettino Ricasoli. In 1866 he presented a bill favoring Italy&#x27;s participation in the construction of the Gotthard Rail Tunnel. He was instrumental in bringing about the alliance with Prussia for the war of 1866 against Austria, and in the organization of the Italian railways. From 1881 to 1886 he was president of the commission to inquire into the agricultural conditions of Italy, and edited the voluminous report on the subject. He was created senator in 1870, and given the title of count in 1880. He died in 1891.

<text>Wilfrid Reid &quot;Wop&quot; May, (March 20, 1896 – June 21, 1952) was a Canadian flying ace in the First World War and a leading post-war aviator. He was the final Allied pilot to be pursued by Manfred von Richthofen before the German ace was shot down on the Western Front in 1918. After the war, May returned to Canada, pioneering the role of a bush pilot while working for Canadian Airways in Northern Alberta and the Northwest Territories.

==Early life==
May was born in Carberry, Manitoba, the son of a carriage maker. His family moved to Edmonton in 1902. On the way, they stayed with family and friends; his two-year-old cousin, Mary Lumsden, could not pronounce Wilfrid and called him &quot;Woppie&quot;. This gave him his nickname &quot;Wop&quot;. He attended the Edmonton High School (now Victoria School of Performing and Visual Arts) while in Edmonton.

==First World War==
May joined the Canadian Army in February 1916 during the First World War. He rose through the enlisted ranks to sergeant and spent most of 1916 as a gunnery instructor in Canada. In 1917, his battalion, the 202nd battalion C.E.F. (Edmonton Sportsmen), was shipped to England, where he and his friend Ray Ross applied to join the Royal Flying Corps. His first flight resulted in the accidental destruction of his own and another aircraft; nevertheless, the RFC accepted his application, and May resigned from the Canadian Army. After initial training in London in October, he was moved to a fighter training squadron and graduated in February 1918.

On April 9, 1918, Lieutenant May was transferred to No. 209 Squadron of the newly created Royal Air Force (the squadron being a unit of the Royal Naval Air Service until April 1, when the RAF was created). The squadron was commanded by another Canadian, May&#x27;s former school friend Roy Brown, who had never lost a subordinate pilot. May spent a few days getting used to his Sopwith Camel and was sent to France.

May fought his first aerial combat on April 20, 1918. The German Fokker Triplane he was duelling crashed of its own accord during the brief fight.

===Death of the Red Baron===

The following day, April 21, saw 209 Squadron again on patrol. Due to his inexperience, Brown gave May similar instructions as before – he was to stay out of the fights and simply keep an eye out. Around 10 a.m., the squadron attacked a group of German Triplanes. At first, during the dogfight, May circled above. But when he spotted a German plane doing the same thing, he decided to launch an attack.

May chased a German aircraft that fled into the middle of the dogfight, and fired on him. The German he was chasing was Wolfram von Richthofen, cousin of Manfred von Richthofen, the &quot;Red Baron&quot;. Wolfram had also been given orders to sit out above the fight and watch because he was a novice flyer too.

On seeing his cousin being attacked, Manfred, in a red Fokker Dr.I, flew to his rescue and fired on May, causing him to pull away and saving Wolfram&#x27;s life. Richthofen pursued May across the Somme.

May spoke about this incident years later, saying, &quot;the first thing I knew I was being fired on from the rear ... [and] all I could do was try to dodge my attacker. I noticed it was a red tri-plane, but if I realized it was Richthofen, I would have probably passed out on the spot. I kept on dodging and spinning, I imagine from about 12,000 feet until I ran out of sky and had to hedge hop over the ground. Richthofen was firing at me continually, [and] the only thing that saved me was my poor flying. I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing myself and I do not suppose that Richthofen could figure out what I was going to do&quot;.

Roy Brown, who was flying above, noticed the Red Baron chasing May, dove steeply at very high speed to intervene and then had to climb steeply to avoid hitting the ground. Richthofen turned to avoid this attack, and then resumed his pursuit of May. Richthofen was shot and killed at some point during this encounter, however, the identity of the person who shot down the Red Baron remains a subject of much dispute.

May continued flying with 209 Squadron until the end of the war and was credited with downing 15 enemy aircraft and probably five others. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross in 1918. He relinquished his RAF commission on May 8, 1919, with the rank of captain.

==Postwar career==
May returned to Edmonton after the war. He and his brother Elgin rented a Curtiss JN-4 &quot;Canuck&quot; and started May Airplanes Ltd., opening Canada&#x27;s first &quot;air harbour&quot; (or aeroport) in a rented pasture, known as May Field, and is near the Mayfield neighborhood. The aircraft is hanging in the lobby of the new Royal Alberta Museum which opened on October 3, 2018. They appeared at various functions during 1919, and are now considered one of the first barnstorming companies in the world.

In September 1919, May Aeroplanes was hired by Edmonton Police Chief Hill during their manhunt for John Larson, wanted on two counts of murder (including of a police officer) and a break-in. May flew Edmonton Police Detective James Campbell to the small town of Edson, and Larson was caught soon thereafter. This was the first time an aircraft was used in a manhunt.

They were soon joined by George Gorman to become May-Gorman Airplanes Ltd. – George Gorman delivered the &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot; newspaper to Wetaskiwin, south of Edmonton.

May and Gorman were hired by Imperial Oil Limited to fly two Junkers airplanes, equipped with skis, from New York to Edmonton in early 1921. Imperial Oil planned to use these planes in the Northwest Territories to service its proposed oil developments along the Mackenzie River at what would later become known as Norman Wells. In March, Gorman and Elmer Fullerton flew these two planes across the 60th parallel (the first ever flight into the Northwest Territories) into the Canadian subarctic, proving that aircraft could operate in sub-zero temperatures. This was the start of aerial exploration in the most distant parts of Canada. In 1924, the business failed.

In 1924, May married Violet &quot;Vi&quot; Bode in November. He decided to get a ground-based job, joining National Cash Register in Dayton, Ohio where he went for training. While working on a lathe, he was hit in one eye by a shard of steel, and from then until 1939, he began slowly going blind in that eye.

Convinced that flying really was his calling, he returned to Edmonton and formed the Edmonton and North Alberta Flying Club in 1927 and became a flight instructor.

===Race against death===
In December 1928, Bert Logan, an employee of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company was posted to Little Red River, Alberta, on arrival he was unpacking when he suddenly became very ill. His wife, a nurse, realized he had diphtheria, and a desperate effort started to get inoculations to the town before anyone else was seriously infected. Simply getting the word out that help was needed was an adventure in its own. At the time, there were no roads in the north, and the nearest telegraph station was miles away over a frozen landscape.

The message eventually reached Edmonton, and on January 1, May was asked if he could deliver the medicine. He left in an Avro Avian with another flying club member, Vic Horner, the next day around noon, and landed on Kimiwan Lake, McLennan for the night just before 4 p.m. when it was becoming dark. They refueled on the Peace River and continued their flight, arriving in Fort Vermilion at 3 p.m. A group had just arrived from Little Red River and the drugs were quickly distributed. They had to stop in Peace River on the return flight due to engine damage from the low quality fuel, and did not arrive back in Edmonton until January 7. By this point, his flight had become known across Canada as &quot;the race against death&quot;, and he and Horner arrived to find a media circus and a mob of thousands of Edmontonians waiting for them at the airport.

The news of this remarkable flight helped May establish a new company, Commercial Airways, to provide air service to northern Canada. The company won a government contract for air mail to the Northwest Territories, a service that had been pioneered by Punch Dickins&#x27; rival Western Canada Airways. Both companies would eventually become part of Canadian Pacific Air Lines.

===Hunt for the Mad Trapper===
In early 1932, May was involved in another manhunt, this time for Albert Johnson, soon known as the &quot;Mad Trapper of Rat River.&quot; While serving a search warrant for illegal trapping on the Rat River, Constable King of the RCMP was shot and wounded by Johnson, sparking off a long chase that became front-page news across the continent. Johnson killed Constable Edger Millen.

May was again hired to see if he could find Johnson, who had seemingly disappeared. On February 13, May solved the mystery when he noted a set of footprints leading off from caribou tracks in the middle of the frozen river. Johnson had been following their tracks to hide his own, but had to strike off the path to set up camp at night. Following the trail over the next few days, the RCMP rounded a bend on the river on February 17 to find Johnson in the middle of the trail again, unable to dodge for the bank without his snowshoes on. A firefight broke out during which one of the RCMP officers was seriously wounded and Johnson killed. May arrived just after the action ended. He landed beside the injured officer, flew him to a doctor and was credited with saving his life.

These actions were later heavily fictionalized in the 1981 Charles Bronson film &quot;Death Hunt&quot;. The film depicts May as the fictional RCAF &quot;Captain Tucker,&quot; who in the film fired wildly at everyone on the ground, including the posse, who fired back and caused him to crash into a mountain.

==Second World War==
With the start of the Second World War, it was decided that Canada would become the major trainer for RAF pilots from the British Commonwealth. The British Commonwealth Air Training Plan set up airfields across Canada, and May became the commander of the No.2 Air Observer School in Edmonton, as well as supervisor of all the western schools.

While this was going on, the United States was also ferrying huge numbers of aircraft to the Soviet Union, flying through Edmonton on their way. A number of these crashed due to mechanical problems, in which case there was no way for an injured pilot to get out of the &quot;back country&quot;. It was decided to form a team of parachute jumpers that could be dropped in on the crash sites to stabilize the injured pilots and start moving them out of the bush. May was involved in this effort.

Early efforts were comical but dangerous, but the US trained a number of jumpers at a smokejumper school in Montana, and it was not long before the Para-Rescue team was in service. Several additional Para-Rescue teams were set up during the war, and by the time the war ended, the value of these teams had been recognized. They were soon re-organized into their own command within the Canadian military, Search and Rescue. For his work in search and rescue, May was awarded the Medal of Freedom, with Bronze Palm in 1947 by the United States Army Air Forces.

==Death==
May was on vacation with his son Denny on June 21, 1952. He died from a stroke while hiking to Timpanogos Cave, near American Fork, Utah. He is buried in the Edmonton Municipal cemetery, Edmonton, Alberta.

==Legacy==
In addition to the Distinguished Flying Cross and the United States Medal of Freedom, Wop May was awarded the Trans-Canada (McKee) Trophy in 1929 and appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1935. In 1974, May was declared a National Historic Person, and a plaque to commemorate him was installed in Edmonton in 1978.

May is immortalized in songs by Stompin&#x27; Tom Connors (&quot;Wop May&quot;), The Gumboots (&quot;Wop May&quot;), and John Spearn (&quot;Roy Brown and Wop May&quot;). He was also the subject of a 1979 National Film Board of Canada vignette.

On October 6, 2004, NASA&#x27;s Mars Exploration Rover &quot;Opportunity&quot; located a rock on the south slope of the Endurance Crater on Mars. The 1 metre (3.3-foot) rock was given the name &quot;wopmay&quot; after the legendary Canadian bush pilot.

Canada has a geologic feature known as the Wopmay Fault Zone, lying to the west of Hudson Bay along the Wopmay River, where the earliest mountains in the world appeared during the Paleoproterozoic era, approximately two billion years ago.

The city of Edmonton, Alberta, named the neighbourhood of Mayfield in honour of Wop May.

In 2017 the airport at Fort Vermilion, Alberta was renamed Fort Vermilion (Wop May Memorial) Aerodrome in his honour.

<text>Quintino Sella (; 7 July 1827 – 14 March 1884) was an Italian politician, economist and mountaineer.

==Biography==
Sella was born at Sella di Mosso, in the Province of Biella.

After studying engineering at Turin, he was sent in 1843 to study mineralogy at the Parisian School of Mines (Mines ParisTech). In Paris he witnessed the revolution of 1848, and only returned to Turin in 1852, when he taught applied geometry at the technical institute. In 1853 he became professor of mathematics at the university, and in 1860 professor of mineralogy in the school of applied engineering.

In 1860 he was elected deputy for Cossato. Two years later he was selected to be secretary-general of public instruction and in 1862 received from Rattazzi the portfolio of finance. The Rattazzi cabinet fell before Sella could efficaciously provide for the deficit of 17,500,000 with which he was confronted; but in 1864 he returned to the ministry of finance in the La Marmora cabinet, and dealt energetically with the deficit of 8,000,000 then existing. Persuading the king to forgo 120,000 of his civil list, and his colleagues in the cabinet to relinquish part of their ministerial stipends, he effected savings amounting to 2,400,000, proposed new taxation to the extent of 1,600,000, and induced landowners to pay one year&#x27;s instalment of the land tax in advance.

A vote of the chamber compelled him to resign before his preparations for financial restoration were complete; but in 1869 he returned to the ministry of finance in a cabinet formed by himself, but of which he made over the premiership to Giovanni Lanza. By means of the grist tax (which he had proposed in 1865, but which the Menabrea cabinet had passed in 1868), and by other fiscal expedients necessitated by the almost desperate condition of the national exchequer, he succeeded, before his fall from power in 1873, in placing Italian finance upon a sound footing, in spite of fierce attacks and persistent misrepresentation.

In 1870 his great political influence turned the scale against interference in favour of France against Prussia, and in favour of an immediate occupation of Rome. From 1873 until his premature death, he acted as leader of the Right (&quot;Destra Storica&quot;) and was more than once prevented by an ephemeral coalition of personal opponents from returning to power as head of a Moderate Conservative cabinet. After the failure of an attempt to form a cabinet in May 1881, he practically retired from public life, devoting himself to his studies and his linen factory.

Quintino Sella died in 1884 and was buried at Oropa where a pyramid was erected by the engineer Carlo Maggia as his monument; the implied anti-clericalism of this choice of an ‘Egyptian’ style matched Sella&#x27;s rôle in the occupation of Rome.

A passionate alpinist, he had found time during his political career to found the Club Alpino Italiano and a number of its mountain huts are named in his honour. He was also involved in the competition for the first ascent of the Matterhorn and he was portrayed in several related films such as &quot;The Mountain Calls&quot; and &quot;The Challenge&quot;.

His &quot;Discorsi parlamentari&quot; was published (5 vols., 1887–1890) by order of the Chamber of Deputies. An account of his life and his scientific labours was given by A Cossa in the &quot;Proceedings of the Accademia dei Lincei&quot; (1884–1885).

The mineral sellaite was named in his honour in 1869.

<text>The land of Subartu (, Assyrian: &quot;mât Šubarri&quot;) or Subar (, ) is mentioned in Bronze Age literature. The name also appears as &quot;Subari&quot; in the Amarna letters, and, in the form &quot;Šbr&quot;, in Ugarit.

Subartu was apparently a kingdom in Upper Mesopotamia, at the upper Tigris and later it referred to a region of Mesopotamia. Most scholars suggest that &quot;Subartu&quot; is an early name for people of upper Mesopotamia proper on the Tigris and westward, although there are various other theories placing it sometimes a little farther to the east and/or north. Its precise location has not been identified. 
From the point of view of the Akkadian Empire, Subartu marked the northern geographical horizon, just as Amurru, Elam and Sumer marked &quot;west&quot;, &quot;east&quot; and &quot;south&quot;, respectively, functioning as a term to mean &#x27;north&#x27;.

== History ==

The Sumerian mythological epic &quot;Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta&quot; lists the countries where the &quot;languages are confused&quot; as Subartu, Hamazi, Sumer, Uri-ki (Akkad), and the Martu land (the Amorites). Similarly, the earliest references to the &quot;four-quarters&quot; by the kings of Akkad name Subartu as one of these quarters around Akkad, along with Martu, Elam, and Sumer. Subartu in the earliest texts seem to have been farming mountain dwellers, frequently raided for slaves.

Eannatum of Lagash was said to have smitten Subartu or Shubur, and it was listed as a province of the empire of Lugal-Anne-Mundu; in a later era Sargon of Akkad campaigned against Subar, and his grandson Naram-Sin listed Subar along with Armani, which has been identified with Aleppo, among the lands under his control. Ishbi-Erra of Isin and Hammurabi also claimed victories over Subar.

Three of the 14th-century BC Amarna letters – Akkadian cuneiform correspondence found in Egypt – mention &quot;Subari&quot; as a toponym. All are addressed to Akhenaten; in two (EA 108 and 109), Rib-Hadda, king of Byblos, complains that Abdi-Ashirta, ruler of Amurru, had sold captives to Subari, while another (EA 100), from the city of Irqata, also alludes to having transferred captured goods to Subari.

There is also a mention of &quot;Subartu&quot; in the 8th century BC &quot;Poem of Erra&quot; (IV, 132), along with other lands that have harassed Babylonia in Neo-Babylonian times (under Nabopolassar, Nebuchadnezzar II and Nabonidus).

Subartu may have been in the general sphere of influence of the Hurrians.

==Amarna letters corpus==
Subartu (&quot;Subaru&quot; of the letters) is a toponym mentioned in the Amarna letters (14th century BC); the letters were written in the short period approximately from 1350–1335 BC. It is commonly accepted that the region referenced was Subartu.

Subartu is only referenced in three of the Amarna letters: EA 100, 108, and EA 109. All three letters state that people, or &#x27;items&#x27; are needed to be sold in Subaru, for money.

===The letters referencing region &quot;Subartu&quot;===

&quot;Subaru&quot; of the letters is only referenced in three Amarna letters, and with no links to any rulers of Subaru.

The following are the letters referencing Subartu:
:EA 100—Title: &quot;The city of Irqata to the king&quot; -See Arqa, Amarna letters &quot;Irqata&quot;
:EA 108—Title: &quot;Unheard-of deeds&quot; -letter of Rib-Hadda
:EA 109—Title: &quot;Then and now&quot; -letter of Rib-Hadda

====EA 108, &quot;Unheard-of deeds&quot;====
:&quot;Rib-Hadda writes to his lord, king of all countries, Great King, King of Battle: May the Lady of Gubla grant power to the king, my lord. I fall at the feet of my lord, my Sun, 7 times and 7 times. Moreover, is it pleasing in the sight of the king, who is like Baal and Šamaš in the sky, that the sons of &#x27;Abdi-Aširta do as they please? They have taken the king&#x27;s horses and chariots, and they have sold &quot;into captivity, charioteers: ši-x-y(?)&quot; and soldiers to ((to))-(emphasis?) the land of &quot;Su(ba)ru&quot;. In whose lifetime has such a deed been done? False words are now being spoken in the presence of the king, the Sun. I am your loyal servant, and whatever I know or have heard I write to the king, my lord. Wh[o] are they, the dogs, that they could &quot;res[ist]&quot; the archers of the king, the Sun? I wrote t[o] ((to))-(emphasis?) your father-(i.e. Amenhotep III), and he he[eded] my wor[d]s, and he sent ar[ch]ers. Did he not take &#x27;Abdi-Aširta for &quot;h[imself]&quot;? Moreover, since the mayors have not oppo[sed] th[em], they are stron[g]. The army furnishes whatever they ne[ed], and so they are not afra[id] of the magnate. Because they have taken the hors[es], they are bold. Because we know that they are strong, we have &quot;to(ld)&quot; the king, &quot;They are strong,&quot; Truly, they will not prevail. When I sent 2 messengers to Sumur-(Zemar), I retained this man in order to report to the king. Moreover, why do you listen to other men? The king&#x27;s messengers must bring (news) by night and bring (it) back by night because of the dog. If the king, the Sun, desires, they will be taken in a day. Moreover, has he [n]o[t] &quot;plotted&quot; evils [&quot;upon evils a]gainst&quot; you, and &quot;rev[olted?&quot; A]nd as for the man of [&quot;my&quot;] &quot;god&quot;, &#x27;Apiru came from Sumur to take him prisoner, but I did not give him up. May the [k]ing he[ed] the words of his servant. Send me [2]0 men from Meluhha and 20 men from Egypt-(named &#x27;Mizri&#x27;-see Mizraim), to guard the city for the king, the Sun, my lord. (I am)-&quot;Your loyal se[rvan]t&quot;. -EA 108, lines 1-69 (complete)

<text>Thomas John Hicks (January 11, 1876 – January 28, 1952) was an American track and field athlete. He won the marathon at the 1904 Summer Olympics.

==Biography==
Hicks, a brass worker from Cambridge, Massachusetts, was born in England. He was the winner of a remarkable marathon race at the 1904 Summer Olympics, held as part of the World Fair in St. Louis, Missouri.

Conditions were bad, the course being a dirt track, with large clouds of dust produced by the accompanying vehicles. Hicks was not the first to cross the finish line, trailing Fred Lorz. However, Lorz had abandoned the race after . After covering much of the course by car, he re-entered the race before the finish. This was discovered by the officials, who disqualified Lorz, who claimed it had been a joke.

Had the race been run under current rules, Hicks would also have been disqualified for using strychnine: his assistants had given him a dose of of strychnine and some brandy because he was flagging badly during the race; the first dose did not revive him for long, so he was given another. As a result, he collapsed after crossing the finishing line. Another dose might have been fatal. Strychnine has been forbidden for athletes since the late 1960s when the International Olympic Committee started testing them for drugs, and the last known use of strychnine occurred at the 2016 Summer Olympics.

Hicks finished in sixth place at the Boston Marathon in both 1901 and 1902. In the Fall of the latter year he relocated to Minneapolis, Minnesota, for work, and while there became captain of the Minneapolis YMCA cross-country team that won the state championship. Hicks returned to Boston in the spring of 1904 and finished second in the Boston Marathon that year. He dropped out during the following year&#x27;s race; the year after, he began walking at Wellesley, and walked all the way to the finish. The 1905 Boston Marathon was legitimately won by Lorz. However, on June 30, 1906, Hicks finished three minutes ahead of Alexander Thibeau to win a marathon at an Amateur Athletic Union meet in Chicago (3:02). The next year he finished thirteenth at the Boston Marathon and sixth at the Chicago Marathon conducted by the Illinois Athletic Club. He finished sixteenth at the same race in the following year, by which time he had returned to Minneapolis. On January 16, 1909, he was leading a marathon at Chicago under terrible weather conditions for more than before being forced to retire with a stitch; the race was won by Sidney Hatch.

In later years, he worked on mining claims at Ingolf, Ontario, and lived at Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, where his two brothers had settled. He became a naturalized Canadian, and died at Winnipeg in 1952 at the age of seventy-six.

<text>Switzerland has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 64 times since its debut at the first contest in , missing only four contests because of being relegated due to poor results the previous year: , , , and . Switzerland hosted the inaugural contest in 1956 in Lugano, where it also won. The country claimed its second victory in , 32 years after the first, and its third in , 36 years after the second win. The Swiss participant broadcaster in the contest is the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation (SRG SSR).

&quot;&quot; performed by Lys Assia won the inaugural contest in 1956 for Switzerland; she returned to place second in with &quot;Giorgio&quot;. The country achieved second place with &quot; by Esther Ofarim () and &quot; by Daniela Simmons (), and third place with &quot; by Franca di Rienzo () and &quot; by Arlette Zola (). It won for the second time in 1988 with &quot; performed by Céline Dion. &quot; by Annie Cotton secured Switzerland&#x27;s 15th top-five finish by placing third in .

Since the introduction of the qualifying round in 1993, Switzerland has reached the top ten only four times. Since the semi-final round&#x27;s inception in 2004, the country has failed to reach the final in 11 of 19 contests, finishing last in the semi-final on four occasions. Switzerland returned to the top five after 26 years when &quot;She Got Me&quot; by Luca Hänni finished fourth in , achieving the country&#x27;s 16th top-five result. This was followed by &quot;&quot; by Gjon&#x27;s Tears placing third in , marking the 17th top-five finish. Switzerland won the contest for the third time in 2024, with &quot;The Code&quot; by Nemo. The country has also finished last in the semi-finals four times since 2004, with &quot;Celebrate&quot; by Piero and the MusicStars (), &quot;&quot; by Michael von der Heide (), &quot;Time to Shine&quot; by Mélanie René (), and &quot;The Last of Our Kind&quot; by Rykka ().

== Participation ==
The Swiss Broadcasting Corporation (SRG SSR) is a full member of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), thus eligible to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest. It has participated in the contest representing Switzerland since the in 1956.

Switzerland has four official languages, French, German, Italian, and Romansh. For intermittent periods prior to its abolition in 1999, the rules stated that the song had to be performed in an official language, which gave SRG SSR leeway as it could submit entries in any of the four languages. Out of its 64 appearances in the contest, it has sent 65 songs, 24 of which were in French, 12 in German, 18 in English, 10 in Italian, and one in Romansh. The first two of Switzerland&#x27;s winning songs were sung in French, with the third being sung in English.

=== Selection Methods ===
SRG SSR has used a mix of different selection processes to determine its entry in each year&#x27;s contest. Since 2019, it has used an internal selection process, although televised national finals were used in previous years, held under various names including &quot;Concours Eurovision&quot; from the 1950s to 2000s, and &quot;Die Grosse Entscheidungsshow&quot; between 2011 and 2018. Starting in 1986, the Swiss national finals tended to have ten participating songs each year: three in French, three in German, three in Italian, and one in Romansch.

<text>Philippe Sudre Dartiguenave (; 6 April 1863 – 26 July 1926) was a Haitian political figure. He served as president of Haiti from 12 August 1915 to 15 May 1922, during the U.S. military occupation that had begun on 27 July 1915.

U.S. Admiral William B. Caperton was the commander of the American occupation troops in Haiti after the assassination of President Jean Vilbrun Guillaume Sam. Civil order in Haiti had completely broken down and Caperton was ordered by Washington DC to find a suitable candidate for the presidency. Two names emerged, Rosalvo Bobo, who was the leader of an ongoing rebellion against the Guillaume Sam government, and Dartiguenave, then president of the Haitian Senate. After interviewing both men Caperton formed the opinion that Bobo was mentally unstable and unfit for any office. He informed Washington of this and was told by assistant secretary of the Navy, Franklin D Roosevelt that &quot;the election of Dartiguenave is preferred by the United States&quot;. Dartiguenave won the election in the Haitian Senate by a vote of 94 to 3 and was inaugurated on 12 August 1915.

==Biography==
Dartiguenave was a mulatto, born on 6 April 1863. Dartiguenave served as the President of the Senate of Haiti in 1910s. He served as President of Haïti from 12 August 1915 to 15 May 1922 in a government set up by the United States after its military occupation began on 27 July 1915 following an uprising which resulted in the death of President Vilbrun Guillaume Sam. He died on 26 July 1926.

<doc id="806164" wikidata="Q217505" url="?curid=806164" title="Bjørn Dæhlie">
<text>Bjørn Erlend Dæhlie (born 19 June 1967) is a Norwegian businessman and retired cross-country skier. From 1992 to 1999, Dæhlie won the Nordic World Cup six times, finishing second in 1994 and 1998. Dæhlie won a total of 29 medals in the Olympics and World Championships between 1991 and 1999, making him the most successful male cross-country skier in history.

During his career, Dæhlie measured a VO2 max of 96 ml/kg/min. Dæhlie&#x27;s result was achieved out of season, and physiologist Erlend Hem who was responsible for the testing stated that he would not discount the possibility of the skier passing 100 ml/kg/min at his absolute peak.

Since retiring, Dæhlie has become a successful businessman in real estate and fashion. His real estate investments have produced a fortune of more than half a billion kroner.

==Early life and career==
Born in Elverum, Norway, Dæhlie later moved to Nannestad, where he settled down. Dæhlie attributes much of his success in sports to his upbringing where he was active in hunting, fishing, hiking, kayaking, football and, of course, skiing from a very early age. For much of his childhood Dæhlie wanted to be a football player, but after being prompted by a coach, he tried Nordic skiing. Dæhlie did not have immediate success as a junior racer, but he consistently improved and eventually qualified for the FIS World Cup competitions.

In 2018 he claimed that his family comes from Alvdal; the claim was made while answering the public during a meeting prior to getting municipal recommendation in regard to building what media calls &quot;his Coop store&quot; - a store in the chain Coop.

==Athletic career==
Dæhlie was first on the Norwegian skiing team for the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada. However, he did not participate in any races and was there to learn from more senior skiers. He later claimed these Olympics were the turning point for Norwegian skiing before their following period of success. He made his debut in the World Cup in January 1989, finishing 11th on the 15 km freestyle in Kavgolovo. In December of the same year, he won his first World Cup race. He finished first on the 15 km freestyle, the first World Cup race of the season.

In the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1991 in Val di Fiemme, Dæhlie won his first World Championship gold medal. He beat skiing legend Gunde Svan on the 15 km freestyle. The medal was unexpected, since Dæhlie was young and still largely unknown. It was Norway&#x27;s first individual male gold medal in the World Championships since Oddvar Brå won gold in the same race in Oslo in 1982. Dæhlie also skied the last leg on the winning 4 × 10 km relay team.

In 1992, Dæhlie&#x27;s period of dominance started. He won the World Cup overall for the first time, a feat he would accomplish five more times in the next seven years. In Albertville, Dæhlie won his first Olympic medals. He won gold in 10/15 km freestyle pursuit, 50 km freestyle and was on the winning team for the 4 × 10 km relay. He won a silver in 30 km classical style. Dæhlie also finished fourth on the 10 km freestyle, where his teammate Vegard Ulvang won the gold. Dæhlie completed the fourth leg of the relay, and crossed the finishing line backwards, having won by a margin of over one and a half minutes. Dæhlie and Ulvang completed a clean sweep of the cross-country skiing gold medals, each winning three golds and a silver. Dæhlie was awarded Fearnley&#x27;s Olympic Prize for his performance, a prize given to the best performing Norwegian athlete in the Olympics.

In the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, Dæhlie won gold in the 10 km classical style and the 15 km freestyle pursuit. He won silver in the 30 km freestyle, where he was beaten by his compatriot Thomas Alsgaard. The 4 × 10 km relay was a very tight race between Norway and Italy. The Italians won the gold after Silvio Fauner beat Dæhlie on the sprint on the last leg. In later years, Thomas Alsgaard took over the fourth leg on the Norwegian relay team with Dæhlie skiing the third leg, since Alsgaard was the better sprinter.

The 1997 Skiing World Championships were Dæhlie&#x27;s most successful World Championships. In front of the home crowd in Trondheim, he won a medal in every race, taking gold in the 10 km classical race, the 10+15 km combined pursuit and the 4 × 10 km relay. In addition he won a silver in the 30 km freestyle and bronze in the 50 km classical. Dæhlie said the championships were like &quot;Lillehammer all over again&quot; and that &quot;For me, it&#x27;s very special to compete in Norway&quot;.

Dæhlie won three golds and one silver in his last Olympics in Nagano. He won the 10 km classical style, the 50 km freestyle and the 4 × 10 km skiing relay. In the 15 km freestyle pursuit, he got a silver medal having been beaten by Thomas Alsgaard on the sprint. Dæhlie won the 50 km freestyle ahead of Niklas Jonsson by only eight seconds. Both skiers collapsed on the finishing line, having given everything in pursuit of victory. Dæhlie described the race as his hardest ever. Dæhlie also formed a lasting friendship with Phillip Boit, the Kenyan skier. Dæhlie waited for Boit on the finish line for 20 minutes following the 10 km race, saying Boit deserved encouragement. Philip went on to name one of his children Dæhlie Boit.

Dæhlie was planning to compete in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, but he was prevented from participating by a career-ending roller skiing accident in August 1999. The resulting back injury prevented Dæhlie from adding more medals to his collection. He retired from the sport in March 2001, having tried extensive rehabilitation and surgery to come back. His decision to retire shocked the nation of Norway, where Dæhlie was idolized for his great winning record.

Dæhlie&#x27;s eight Olympic titles are a record for the Winter Olympics, as are his total of 12 Olympic medals (he also won four silver medals) which he amassed in three Olympics (Albertville, Lillehammer and Nagano). In addition to his achievements at the Olympics he had great success in the World Championships where he won 17 medals of which nine were gold medals. He was particularly successful in the Trondheim 1997 World Championships, where he earned medals in all five events. Despite his unanticipated early exit from the sport, Dæhlie is considered by many to be one of the greatest Winter Olympic athletes of all time. In his illustrious career, Dæhlie never won a race at the Holmenkollen ski festival, but he was still awarded the Holmenkollen medal in 1997 (shared with Bjarte Engen Vik and Stefania Belmondo).

He supports non-profit organisations that work for causes such as multiple sclerosis. In 2009 Dæhlie raced in the American Birkebeiner as a fundraiser for multiple sclerosis. Dæhlie competed in the classic race, which is 54 km long, finishing second in a photo finish.

In 2011, Dæhlie won the downhill event in the Kicksled World Championships in Hurdal.
Also in 2011, Dæhlie announced a comeback, stating his intention to participate in long-distance races like Marcialonga and Vasaloppet

Dæhlie also participated in long-distance running in his youth, representing Ullensaker/Kisa IL. He participated in the Nordic junior match versus Denmark/Iceland, Finland and Sweden in 1987.

<text>Otto Ernst Heinrich Hermann Suhr (17 August 1894 – 30 August 1957) was a German politician as a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). He served as the Governing Mayor of Berlin (i.e. West Berlin) from 1955 until his death.

==Life==
He was born 1894 in Oldenburg and went with his family to Osnabrück when he was nine years old; four years later the family went to Leipzig, where Suhr studied economics, history and publishing science at the university, interrupted by his service in the German Army in World War I.

Suhr joined the SPD in 1919 and from 1922 worked as a secretary at the Allgemeiner Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund trade unions&#x27; association in Kassel and was a member of the local SPD executive committee under Philipp Scheidemann. He received his doctorate in 1923 and from 1925 taught economics at the University of Jena. In 1926 he joined the board of the &quot;Allgemeiner freier Angestelltenbund&quot; (General Free Federation of Employees) in Berlin, which had to dissolve in the course of the Nazi seizure of power in 1933 and the succeeding &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; process. 

From 1935 on, Suhr worked as a journalist at the Frankfurter Zeitung and other newspapers. He remained in contact with Social Democratic members of the German resistance like Adolf Grimme and had to face several interrogations by the Gestapo.

After World War II he played a vital role in re-organizing the Berlin SPD chapter as chairman of the party&#x27;s state association. From 1946 Suhr was president of the Berlin &quot;Stadtverordnetenversammlung&quot; city assembly, and from 1951 until 1954 also of its successor, the Abgeordnetenhaus of Berlin. He had to cope with the forceful SED merger of Social Democrats and Communists in the Soviet occupation zone and East Berlin, the Berlin Blockade and the final division of the city, when the assembly was compelled to move into the Rathaus Schöneberg in the American sector.

In 1948/49 Suhr was a deputy at the Herrenchiemsee convention and the &quot;Parlamentarischer Rat&quot; (parliamentary council) to draft a new German constitution. After ratification of the Basic Law (&quot;Grundgesetz&quot;) in 1949 he was elected as a deputy to the Bundestag federal parliament of West Germany in Bonn, until he resigned his seat in 1952. Suhr lectured as an honorary professor at the Free University of Berlin (FU) and re-established the private &quot;Deutsche Hochschule für Politik&quot; academy, the biggest and one of the most important institute for political science in Germany, which he led from 1948 to 1955. In 1958 it was integrated into the FU and named &quot;Otto-Suhr-Institut&quot; in his honour.

In the West Berlin election of December 1954, the coalition government of Christian Democrats (CDU) and Free Democrats (FDP) under Governing Mayor Walther Schreiber lost its plurality, with the SPD reaching a one-seat absolute majority in the Abgeordnetenhaus assembly. Suhr nevertheless decided to form a coalition with the CDU and was elected &quot;Regierender Bürgermeister&quot; on 11 January 1955. His incumbency was driven by the efforts to rebuild the city, marked by the 1957 Interbau exhibition. On 19 July 1957 Suhr also asserted his regular appointment as President of the Bundesrat despite Allied reservations, however he did not step into office as he died from leukemia six weeks later and was succeeded by Willy Brandt.

==Honours==
Beside the &quot;Otto-Suhr-Institut&quot;, a street in his birthplace Oldenburg (in the district Eversten) and &quot;Otto-Suhr-Allee&quot; in the Berlin district of Charlottenburg are named after him.

<text>Enrico Cialdini, Duca di Gaeta (10 August 18118 September 1892) was an Italian soldier, politician and diplomat.

==Biography==
He was born in Castelvetro, in the province of Modena, Kingdom of Italy. He was the son of a civil engineer and attended and was expelled from a Jesuit school. In 1831 he took part in the insurrection in Modena, fleeing afterwards to Paris, whence he proceeded to Spain to fight against the Carlists. 
Returning to Italy in 1848, he commanded a regiment at the Battle of Novara. 
In 1859, he organized the Alpine Brigade, fought at the Battle of Palestro at the head of the 4th Division; in the following year invaded the Marche, won the Battle of Castelfidardo, took Ancona, and subsequently directed the Siege of Gaeta. 
For these services he was created &quot;Duke of Gaeta&quot; by the king, and was assigned a pension of 10,000 lire by the Italian Parliament. In 1861 his intervention envenomed the Cavour-Garibaldi dispute, royal mediation alone preventing a duel between him and Garibaldi. Placed in command of the troops sent to oppose the Garibaldian expedition of 1862, he defeated Garibaldi in the controversial Battle of Aspromonte. Between 1862 and 1866 he held the position of lieutenant-royal at Naples where he fought against the Brigandage in the Two Sicilies, and in 1864 was created senator.

On the outbreak of the Third Italian War of Independence he resumed command of an army corps, but dissensions between him and Alfonso La Marmora prejudiced the issue of the campaign and contributed to the defeat of Custoza. After the war he refused the command of the General Staff, which he wished to render independent of the war office. In 1867 he attempted unsuccessfully to form a cabinet sufficiently strong to prevent the threatened Garibaldian incursion into the Papal States, and two years later failed in a similar attempt, through disagreement with Giovanni Lanza concerning the army estimates.

On 3 August 1870 he pleaded in favour of Italian intervention in aid of France, a circumstance which enhanced his influence when in July 1876 he replaced Costantino Nigra as ambassador to the French Republic.
This position he held until 1882, when he resigned on account of the publication by Pasquale Stanislao Mancini of a despatch in which he had complained of arrogant treatment by William Henry Waddington.

He died at Livorno in 1892.

<text>DokuWiki is an open source wiki application licensed under GPLv2 and written in the PHP programming language. It works on plain text files and thus does not need a database. Its syntax is similar to the one used by MediaWiki. It is often recommended as a more lightweight, easier to customize alternative to MediaWiki. The &#x27;Doku&#x27; in DokuWiki is short for &quot;Dokumentation&quot; which in German means documentation.

Because DokuWiki does not require a database, it can be installed on local PCs, flash drives, and folders synced with file hosting services or file synchronization programs such as Dropbox or Syncthing.

== History ==
DokuWiki was created by Andreas Gohr in June 2004. In July the first official release was published on Freshmeat (now known as Freecode).

Originally DokuWiki used a simple list of regular expressions to transform wiki syntax into HTML. A big step forward in the development was the re-design of the parser and the renderer mechanisms based on contributions by Harry Fuecks in January 2005. The new design made use of the then-new object-oriented features of PHP4. The new parser and the introduction of a cache mechanism led to significant performance improvements, thus making DokuWiki usable for larger projects.

The new parser also prepared DokuWiki for the introduction of a generic plugin interface which simplified the development and maintenance of syntax-based plugins. Over the years additional plugin mechanisms followed which allowed 3rd-party developers to extend nearly all aspects of the wiki software.

The introduction of DokuWiki into the Debian and Gentoo Linux distributions in April and July 2005 respectively significantly increased the visibility of the software.

The DokuWiki logo is the result of a design contest. The winning logo, designed by Esther Brunner, represents editing pages (by pencils of different colors, i.e. different people) and linking them.

For many years, DokuWiki&#x27;s source code was managed through the Darcs distributed version control system. In 2010 a switch to Git was made, making use of GitHub for hosting.

Today, DokuWiki is one of the most popular wiki engines available and has achieved significant usage with stable interest over time.

=== Release history ===
Since 2011, releases are named after Discworld characters.

== Main features ==

; Installation and Requirements
: DokuWiki requires only a webserver and PHP; no database is needed. It can run on cheap web hosting servers and is usually installed by simply unpacking. Additional plugins may have additional requirements.
; Revision control
: DokuWiki stores all versions of each wiki page, allowing the user to compare the current version with any older version. The difference engine is the same as the one used in MediaWiki. Parallel editing of one page by multiple users is prevented by a locking mechanism.
; Access control: Access control can be handled by a user manager, which allows users and groups of users to be defined, and an access control list in which an administrator user can define permissions on page and namespace level, giving DokuWiki more fine-grained control than Mediawiki. Besides the built-in user management, DokuWiki also provides mechanisms for authentication against databases, LDAP Servers and Active Directory. Other authentication mechanisms are available as plugins.
; Plugins: DokuWiki has a generic plugin interface which simplifies the process of writing and maintaining plugins. There are ~1000 plugins available. These can be easily integrated and managed by an administrator user with the help of the plugin manager.
; Templates: The appearance of the wiki can be defined by a template. There are various templates provided by the development community.
; Internationalization and localization: DokuWiki supports Unicode (UTF-8) and properly handles right-to-left languages, so languages such as Chinese, Thai, and Hebrew can be displayed. DokuWiki can be configured in about 70 languages. Multilingual wikis can be configured through plugins. Users can contribute translations of the DokuWiki software and of plugins through a web interface.
; Caching: DokuWiki uses a two-level cache mechanism which stores the parsed wiki page in an intermediate serialized format which is then rendered to the desired output format, such as HTML5. This rendered format is cached again. The two levels of caching expire on different conditions. The caching helps to reduce server load and speeds up access to the information.
; Full text search: DokuWiki has an integrated indexed search with which a user can search for keywords and phrases on the wiki.
; Wiki markup: DokuWiki uses a simple markup language similar to that of MediaWiki. Like MediaWiki it makes use of free links, but CamelCase links can optionally be enabled. WYSIWYG editors are available as plugins.

== DokuWiki based software projects ==
Some independent software projects based on DokuWiki have been created. These projects usually bundle the DokuWiki software, select plugins, a customized design and sometimes pre-built content for specialized use cases.

* The EinsatzleiterWiki is a German project, bundling fire fighting knowledge in a package that can be installed in fire departments and then be customized to the needs of the specific department. The wiki is used by the professional fire services of Berlin, Kaiserslautern, Wuppertal and many voluntary fire services in Germany.
* open|SchulPortfolio is a German project aimed at the internal management of schools. It has been created with input from the ministry of education of the German state of Baden-Würtemberg.
* ICKEWiki is a redistribution of DokuWiki with a focus on the use in enterprises. It was originally developed in a research project focusing on adding structured data to wikis and making it more usable in industrial production companies.

As required by DokuWiki&#x27;s license these projects are all licensed under the GPL version 2.

<text>The Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe (), also known as the Holocaust Memorial (German: &quot;Holocaust-Mahnmal&quot;), is a memorial in Berlin to the Jewish victims of the Holocaust committed by Nazi Germany, designed by architect Peter Eisenman and Buro Happold. It consists of a site covered with 2,711 concrete slabs or &quot;stelae&quot;, arranged in a grid pattern on a sloping field. The original plan was to place nearly 4,000 slabs, but after the recalculation, the number of slabs that could legally fit into the designated areas was 2,711. The stelae are long, wide and vary in height from . They are organized in rows, 54 of them going north–south, and 87 heading east–west at right angles but set slightly askew. An attached underground &quot;Place of Information&quot; () holds the names of approximately 3 million Jewish Holocaust victims, obtained from the Israeli museum Yad Vashem.

Building began on 1 April 2003, and was finished on 15 December 2004. It was inaugurated on 10 May 2005, sixty years after the end of World War II in Europe, and opened to the public two days later. It is located one block south of the Brandenburg Gate, in the Mitte neighborhood. The cost of construction was approximately .

== Location ==
The memorial is located on Cora-Berliner-Straße 1, 10117 in Berlin, a city with one of the largest Jewish populations in Europe before the Second World War. Adjacent east to the Tiergarten, it is centrally located in Berlin&#x27;s historical Friedrichstadt district, close to the Reichstag building and the Brandenburg Gate. The monument is situated on the former location of the Berlin Wall, where the &quot;death strip&quot; once divided the city. During the Third Reich a part of this area was the location of Joseph Goebbels&#x27; urban villa, with the nearby Reich Chancellery and the Führerbunker in the south. The memorial is located near many of Berlin&#x27;s foreign embassies.

The monument is composed of 2,711 rectangular concrete blocks, laid out in a rectangular grid covering . This allows for long, straight, and narrow alleys between them, along which the ground undulates.

==History==

===Beginnings===
The debates over the existence and form of such a memorial extend back to the late 1980s, when a small group of private West German citizens, led by television journalist Lea Rosh and historian Eberhard Jäckel, first began pressing for West Germany to honor the six million Jews murdered in the Holocaust. Rosh soon emerged as the driving force behind the memorial. In 1989, she founded a group to support its construction and to collect donations. With growing support, the Bundestag (the German federal parliament) passed a resolution in favour of the project. On 25 June 1999, the Bundestag decided to build the memorial designed by Peter Eisenman. A federal foundation (Foundation for the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe () was consequently founded to run it.

===First competition===

In April 1994 a competition for the memorial&#x27;s design was announced in Germany&#x27;s major newspapers. Twelve artists were specifically invited to submit a design and given 50,000DM (€25,000) to do so. The winning proposal was to be selected by a jury consisting of representatives from the fields of art, architecture, urban design, history, politics and administration, including Frank Schirrmacher, co-editor of the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;. The deadline for the proposals was 28 October. On 11 May, an information colloquium took place in Berlin, where people interested in submitting a design could receive some more information about the nature of the memorial to be designed. Ignatz Bubis, the president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, and Wolfgang Nagel, the construction senator of Berlin, spoke at the event.

Before the deadline, the documents required to submit a proposal were requested over 2,600 times and 528 proposals were submitted. The jury met on 15 January 1995 to pick the best submission. First, Walter Jens, the president of the Akademie der Künste, was elected chairman of the jury. In the following days, all but 13 submissions were eliminated from the race in several rounds of looking through all works. As had already been arranged, the jury met again on 15 March. Eleven submissions were restored to the race, as requested by several jurors after they had had a chance to review the eliminated works in the months in between the meetings.

Two works were then recommended by the jury to the foundation to be checked as to whether they could be completed within the price range given. One of them was designed by a group around the architect Simon Ungers from Hamburg; it consisted of 85×85 meters square of steel girders on top of concrete blocks located on the corners. The names of several extermination camps would be perforated into the girders so that these would be projected onto objects or people in the area by sunlight. The other winner was a design by Christine Jackob-Marks. Her concept consisted of 100×100 meters large concrete plate, seven meters thick. It would be tilted, rising up to eleven meters and walkable on special paths. The names of the Jewish victims of the Holocaust would be engraved into the concrete, with spaces left empty for those victims whose names remain unknown. Large pieces of debris from Masada, a mountaintop-fortress in Israel, whose Jewish inhabitants killed themselves to avoid being captured or killed by the Roman soldiers rushing in, would be spread over the concrete plate. Other ideas involved a memorial not only to the Jews but to all the victims of Nazism.

Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who had taken a close personal interest in the project, expressed his dissatisfaction with the recommendations of the jury to implement the work of the Jackob-Marks team. A new, more limited competition was launched in 1996 with 25 architects and sculptors invited to submit proposals.

==Eisenman design==
The date for the inauguration was scrapped and in 1997 the first of three public discussions on the monument was held. The second competition in November 1997 produced four finalists, including a collaboration between architect Peter Eisenman and artist Richard Serra whose plan later emerged as the winner. Their design originally envisaged a huge labyrinth of 4,000 stone pillars of varying heights scattered over . Serra, however, quit the design team soon after, citing personal and professional reasons that &quot;had nothing to do with the merits of the project.&quot; Kohl still insisted on numerous changes, but Eisenman soon indicated he could accommodate them. Among other changes, the initial Eisenman-Serra project was soon scaled down to a monument of some 2,000 pillars.

By 1999, as other empty stretches of land nearby were filled with new buildings, the vacant lot began to resemble a hole in the city&#x27;s centre.

In a breakthrough mediated by W. Michael Blumenthal and negotiated between Eisenman and Michael Naumann in January 1999, the essence of the huge field of stone pillarsto which the incoming German government led by Gerhard Schröder had earlier objectedwas preserved. The number of pillars was reduced from about 2,800 to somewhere between 1,800 and 2,100, and a building to be called &quot;The House of Remembrance&quot;consisting of an atrium and three sandstone blockswas to be added. This buildingan archive, information centre and exhibition spacewas to be flanked by a thick, &quot;Wall of Books&quot; that would have housed a million books between an exterior made of patterned black steel and a glass interior side. The &quot;Wall of Books&quot;, containing works that scholars would have been able to consult, was intended to symbolize the concern of the Schröder government that the memorial not be merely backward-looking and symbolic but also educational and useful. Agreement was also reached that the memorial would be administered by the Jewish Museum.

On 25 June 1999, a large majority of the Bundestag314 to 209, with 14 abstentionsdecided in favor of Eisenman&#x27;s plan, which was eventually modified by attaching a museum, or &quot;place of information,&quot; designed by Berlin-based exhibition designer Dagmar von Wilcken. Across the street from the northern boundary of the memorial is the new Embassy of the United States in Berlin, which opened 4 July 2008. For a while, issues over setback for U.S. embassy construction impacted the memorial. It also emerged in late 1999 that a small corner of the site was still owned by a municipal housing company, and the status of that piece of land had to be resolved before any progress on the construction could be made.

In July 2001, the provocative slogan &quot;The Holocaust never happened&quot; appeared in newspaper advertisements and on billboards seeking donations of $2 million for the memorial. Under the slogan and a picture of a serene mountain lake and snow-capped mountain, a smaller type said: &quot;There are still many people who make this claim. In 20 years there could be even more.&quot;

==Construction==
On 27 January 2000 a celebration was held marking the symbolic beginning of construction on the memorial site. The first provisional stelae were erected in May 2001. An international symposium on the memorial and the information centre was held by the foundation in November 2001 together with historians, museum experts, art historians and experts on architectural theory. In the spring of 2003, work began on the construction of the memorial. At the same time, an information point was erected at the fence surrounding the construction site.

On 14 October 2003, the Swiss newspaper &quot;Tages-Anzeiger&quot; published articles noting that the Degussa company was involved in the construction of the memorial, producing the anti-graffiti substance Protectosil used to cover the stelae; the company had been involved in various ways in the Nazi persecution of the Jews. A subsidiary company of Degussa, Degesch, had even produced the Zyklon B gas used to poison people in the gas chambers. At first, these articles did not receive much attention, until the board of trustees managing the construction discussed this situation on 23 October and, after turbulent and controversial discussions, decided to stop construction immediately until a decision was made. Primarily it was representatives of the Jewish community who had called for an end to Degussa&#x27;s involvement, while the politicians on the board, including Wolfgang Thierse, did not want to stop construction and incur further expense. They also said it would be impossible to exclude all German companies involved in the Nazi crimes, becauseas Thierse put it&quot;the past intrudes into our society&quot;. Lea Rosh, who also advocated excluding Degussa, replied that &quot;Zyklon B is obviously the limit.&quot;

In the discussions that followed, several facts emerged. For one, it transpired that it was not by coincidence that the involvement of Degussa had been publicized in Switzerland, because another company that had bid to produce the anti-graffiti substance was located there. Further, the foundation managing the construction, as well as Lea Rosh, had known about Degussa&#x27;s involvement for at least a year but had not done anything to stop it. Rosh then claimed she had not known about the connections between Degussa and Degesch. It also transpired that another Degussa subsidiary, Woermann Bauchemie GmbH, had already poured the foundation for the stelae. A problem with excluding Degussa from the project was that many of the stelae had already been covered with Degussa&#x27;s product. These would have to be destroyed if another company were to be used instead. The resulting cost would be about €2.34 million. In the course of the discussions about what to do, which lasted until 13 November, most of the Jewish organizations including the Central Council of Jews in Germany spoke out against working with Degussa, while the architect Peter Eisenman, for one, supported it.

On 13 November, the decision was made to continue working with the company, and was subsequently heavily criticized. German-Jewish journalist, author, and television personality Henryk M. Broder said that &quot;the Jews don&#x27;t need this memorial, and they are not prepared to declare a pig sty kosher.&quot;

===Completion and opening===
On 15 December 2004, the memorial was finished. It was dedicated on 10 May 2005, as part of the celebration of the 60th anniversary of V-E Day and opened to the public two days later, along with the information centre. It was originally to be finished by 27 January 2004, the 59th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.

The inauguration ceremony, attended by all the senior members of Germany&#x27;s government, including Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, took place in a large white tent set up on the edge of the memorial field itself, only metres from the place where Hitler&#x27;s underground bunker was. Holocaust survivor Sabina Wolanski was chosen to speak on behalf of the six million dead. In her speech, she noted that although the Holocaust had taken everything she valued, it had also taught her that hatred and discrimination are doomed to fail. She also emphasized that the children of the perpetrators of the Holocaust are not responsible for the actions of their parents. The medley of Hebrew and Yiddish songs that followed the speeches was sung by Joseph Malovany, cantor of the Fifth Avenue Synagogue in New York, accompanied by the choir of the White Stork Synagogue in Wrocław, Poland, and by the Lower Silesian German-Polish Philharmonic Youth Orchestra.

In the first year after it opened in May 2005, the monument attracted over 3.5 million visitors. By the end of 2005 around 350,000 people had visited the information centre, and it is estimated that some 5 million visitors have visited the Information Centre by December 2015. Over those 10 years (2006–2015), an average of 460,000 people have visited, or over 1,000 per day. The foundation operating the memorial considered this a success; its head, Uwe Neumärker, called the memorial a &quot;tourist magnet&quot;.

===Construction defects===
Three years after the official opening of the memorial, half of the blocks made from compacting concrete started to crack. While some interpret this defect as an intentional symbolization of the immortality and durability of the Jewish community, the memorials&#x27; foundation deny this. Some analyze the lack of individual names on the monument as an illustration of the unimaginable number of murdered Jews in the Holocaust. In this way, the memorial illustrates that the number of Jews murdered in the Holocaust was so colossal that is impossible to physically visualize.

Initial concerns about the memorial&#x27;s construction focused on the possible effects of weathering, fading, and graffiti. Already by 2007, the memorial was said to be in urgent need of repair after hairline cracks were found in some 400 of its concrete slabs. Suggestions that the material used was mediocre have been repeatedly dismissed by Peter Eisenman. In 2012, German authorities started reinforcing hundreds of concrete blocks with steel collars concealed within the &quot;stelae&quot; after a study revealed they were at risk of crumbling under their own mass.

==Information Bureau==

The information centre is located at the site&#x27;s eastern edge, beneath the field of &quot;stelae&quot;. The visitor display begins with a timeline that lays out the history of the Final Solution, from when the National Socialists took power in 1933 through the murder of more than a million Soviet Jews in 1941. The rest of the exhibition is divided into four rooms dedicated to personal aspects of the tragedy, e.g. the individual families or the letters thrown from the trains that transported them to the death camps. The &quot;Room of Families&quot; focuses on the fates of 15 specific Jewish families. In the &quot;Room of Names&quot;, names of all known Jewish Holocaust victims obtained from the Yad Vashem memorial in Israel are read out loud. Each chamber contains visual reminders of the stelae above: rectangular benches, horizontal floor markers and vertical illuminations.

Critics have questioned the placement of the centre. It is discreetly placed on the eastern edge of the monument. Architecturally, the information centre&#x27;s most prominent feature lies in its coffered concrete ceilings. The undulating surfaces mirror the pattern of the pillars and pathways overhead, causing the visitor to feel like they have entered a collection of graves. &quot;Aesthetically, the Information Center runs against every intention of the open memorial. The aboveground pavilion of the subterranean documentation area mars the steady measure of the order of rectangles. Admittedly, all objections against this pedagogical extra fall silent when one has descended the stairs to the Information Center and entered the first four rooms&quot;.

The visitors centre contains and displays some of the most important moments and memories of the Holocaust, through carefully chosen examples in a concise and provocative display. The entrances cut through the network of paths defined by the stelae, and the exhibit area gives the memorial that which by its very conception it should not have: a defined attraction. &quot;The exhibitions are literal, a sharp contrast to the amorphous stelae that the memorial is composed of. &quot;It is as if they (exhibits) were directed at people who cannot find the capacity to believe that the Holocaust occurred&quot;.

==Interpretations ==

According to Eisenman&#x27;s project text, the stelae are designed to produce an uneasy, confusing atmosphere, and the whole sculpture aims to represent a supposedly ordered system that has lost touch with human reason. The Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe Foundation official English website states that the design represents a radical approach to the traditional concept of a memorial, partly because Eisenman said the number and design of the monument had no symbolic significance.

However, observers have noted the memorial&#x27;s resemblance to a cemetery. The abstract installation leaves room for interpretation, the most common being that of a graveyard. &quot;The memorial evokes a graveyard for those who were unburied or thrown into unmarked pits, and several uneasily tilting stelae suggest an old, untended, or even desecrated cemetery.&quot; Many visitors have claimed that from outside the memorial, the field of grey slabs resemble rows of coffins. While each stone slab is approximately the size and width of a coffin, Eisenman has denied any intention to resemble any form of a burial site. The memorial&#x27;s grid can be read as both an extension of the streets that surround the site and an unnerving evocation of the rigid discipline and bureaucratic order that kept the killing machine grinding along. Wolfgang Thierse, the president of Germany&#x27;s parliament the Bundestag, described the piece as a place where people can grasp &quot;what loneliness, powerlessness and despair mean&quot;. Thierse talked about the memorial as creating a type of mortal fear in the visitor. Visitors have described the monument as isolating, triggered by the massive blocks of concrete, barricading the visitor from street noise and sights of Berlin.

Some visitors and Berliners have also interpreted the contrast between the grey flat stones and the blue sky as a recognition of the &quot;dismal times&quot; of the Holocaust. As one slopes downwards into the memorial entrance, the grey pillars begin to grow taller until they completely consume the visitor. Eventually, the grey pillars become smaller again as visitors ascend towards the exit. Some have interpreted this as the rise and fall of the Third Reich or the Regime&#x27;s gradual momentum of power that allowed them to perpetrate such atrocities on the Jewish community. The space in between the concrete pillars offers a brief encounter with the sunlight. As visitors wander through the slabs the sun disappears and reappears. One is constantly tormented with the possibility of a warmer, brighter life. Some have interpreted this use of space as a symbolic remembrance of the volatile history of European Jews whose political and social rights constantly shifted. Many visitors have claimed walking through the memorial makes one feel trapped without any option other than to move forward. Some claim the downward slope that directs you away from the outside symbolically depicts the gradual escalation of the Third Reich&#x27;s persecution of the European Jewish community. First, they were forced into ghettos and removed from society and eventually they were removed from existence. The more a visitor descends into the memorial, they are without any visible contact of the outside world. They are completely ostracized and hidden from the world. It is common for groups of visitors to lose each other as they wander deeper into the memorial. This often reminds one of the separation and loss of family among the Jewish community during the Holocaust.

Some have interpreted the shape and colour of the grey slabs to represent the loss of identity during the Nazi regime. As one moves into the memorial, the space between the shapes widens. Identity in a regime is largely shaped by belongingness defined through &#x27;sameness&#x27; and the &quot;repetition of the same&quot;. Some blocks are spaced farther apart and are isolated from other blocks. This is often understood as a symbolic representation of the forced segregation and confinement of Jews during the Nazi regime. The continuation of &quot;sameness&quot; and unity in the Nazi regime depended on the act of exclusion. Architectural historian Andrew Benjamin has written that the spatial separation of certain blocks represents &quot;a particular [as] no longer an instance of the whole&quot;. The lack of unified shape within the group of blocks has also been understood as a symbolic representation of the &quot;task of remembering&quot;. Some of the blocks appear to be unfinished. Some see this unfinished appearance as asserting that the task of remembering the Holocaust is never over. Benjamin has said &quot;The monument works to maintain the incomplete&quot;. As the effects of the Holocaust are impossible to fully represent, the memorial&#x27;s structures have remained unfinished. The missing parts of the structure illustrate the missing members of the Jewish community that will never return. The destruction of the Holocaust has resulted in a missing epoch of Jewish heritage.

The memorial&#x27;s structures also deny any sense of collectivity. Some have interpreted this to reflect the lack of collective guilt amongst the German population. Others have interpreted the spatial positioning of the blocks to represent individual guilt for the Holocaust. Some Germans have viewed the memorial as targeting German society and claim the memorial is presented as &quot;an expression of ournon-Jewish Germans&#x27;responsibility for the past&quot;. The site is also enclosed by borders of trees and Berlin&#x27;s city centre. The enclosure from these borders has often evoked feelings of entrapment. This can be understood as a symbolic representation of the closure of European and American borders following the Évian Conference that forced Jews to stay in Germany.

Several have noted that the number of stelae is identical to the number of pages in the Babylonian Talmud.

==Public reception and criticism==
The monument has been criticized for only commemorating the Jewish victims of the Holocaust; however, other memorials have subsequently opened which commemorate other identifiable groups that were also victims of the Nazis, for example, the Memorial to Homosexuals Persecuted Under Nazism (in 2008) and the Memorial to the Sinti and Roma Victims of National Socialism (in 2012). Many critics argued that the design should include names of victims, as well as the numbers of people murdered and the places where the murders occurred. Meanwhile, architecture critic Nicolai Ouroussoff claimed the memorial &quot;is able to convey the scope of the Holocaust&#x27;s horrors without stooping to sentimentalityshowing how abstraction can be the most powerful tool for conveying the complexities of human emotion.&quot;

Some Germans have argued the memorial is only statuary and does little to honor those murdered during the Nazi Regime. Some claimed the erection of the memorial ignored Germany&#x27;s responsibility to engage in more active forms of remembrance. Others assert that the erection of the memorial ignored the SED&#x27;s totalitarianism. Certain German civilians were angered that no memorial had been erected remembering the flight and expulsion of Germans from Eastern territories. Some critics claimed there was no need for a memorial in Berlin as several concentration camps were memorialized, honoring the murdered Jews of Europe. Others have claimed the presence of a memorial in Berlin is essential to remember the once-thriving Jewish community in Berlin.

In early 1998, a group of leading German intellectuals, including writer Günter Grass, argued that the monument should be abandoned. Several months later, when accepting the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade, German novelist Martin Walser cited the Holocaust Memorial. Walser decried &quot;the exploitation of our disgrace for present purposes.&quot; He criticized the &quot;monumentalization&quot;, and &quot;ceaseless presentation of our shame.&quot; And said: &quot;Auschwitz is not suitable for becoming a routine-of-threat, an always available intimidation or a moral club [Moralkeule] or also just an obligation. What is produced by ritualisation, has the quality of a lip service&quot;.

Eberhard Diepgen, mayor of Berlin 1991–2001, had publicly opposed the memorial and did not attend the groundbreaking ceremony in 2000. Diepgen had previously argued that the memorial is too big and impossible to protect.

Reflecting the continuing disagreements, Paul Spiegel, then the president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany and a speaker at the opening ceremony in 2005, expressed reservations about the memorial, saying that it was &quot;an incomplete statement.&quot; He said that by not including non-Jewish victims, the memorial suggests that there was a &quot;hierarchy of suffering,&quot; when, he said, &quot;pain and mourning are great in all afflicted families.&quot; In addition, Spiegel criticized the memorial for providing no information on the Nazi perpetrators themselves and therefore blunting the visitors&#x27; &quot;confrontation with the crime.&quot;

In 2005, Lea Rosh proposed her plan to insert a victim&#x27;s tooth which she had found at the Bełżec extermination camp in the late 1980s into one of the concrete blocks at the memorial. In response, Berlin&#x27;s Jewish community threatened to boycott the memorial, forcing Rosh to withdraw her proposal. According to Jewish tradition, the bodies of Jews and any of their body parts can be buried only in a Jewish cemetery.

The memorial has also come under fire for perpetuating what some critics call an &quot;obsession with the Holocaust&quot;. Michal Bodemann, a professor of sociology at the University of Toronto, is critical of what he calls the &quot;permanent&quot; and &quot;brooding&quot; culture of Holocaust commemoration in Germany. He studies postwar German-Jewish relations and told &quot;Die Tageszeitung&quot; that Germany&#x27;s focus on the past overlooks the racist tendencies in society today and suggests a hopelessness toward the future. &quot;My impression is that you hide yourself away in history in order to keep the present from cutting too close&quot;.

Many critics found the &quot;vagueness&quot; of the stelae disturbing. The concrete blocks offer no detail or reference to the Holocaust. The title of the monument does not include the words &quot;Holocaust&quot; or &quot;Shoah&quot;. Critics have raised questions about the memorial&#x27;s lack of information. &quot;It doesn&#x27;t say anything about who did the murdering or whythere&#x27;s nothing along the lines of &#x27;by Germany under Hitler&#x27;s regime,&#x27; and the vagueness is disturbing&quot;. The question of the dedication of the memorial is even more powerful. &quot;In its radical refusal of the inherited iconography of remembrance, Berlin&#x27;s field of stones also forgoes any statement about its own reason for existence. The installation gives no indication who is to be remembered. There are no inscriptions. One seeks in vain for the names of the murdered, for Stars of David or other Jewish symbols&quot;. Many of the installation&#x27;s greatest critics fear that the memorial does not do enough to address a growing movement of Holocaust deniers. &quot;[T]he failure to mention it at the country&#x27;s main memorial for the Jews killed in the Holocaustseparates the victims from their killers and leaches the moral element from the historical event&quot;. Critics say that the memorial assumes that people are aware of the facts of the Holocaust. &quot;The reduction of responsibility to a tacit fact that &#x27;everybody knows&#x27; is the first step on the road to forgetting&quot;. Critics also feared the monument would become a place of pilgrimage for the neo-Nazi movement. With the rise of the alt-right movement in recent years, fears have once again arisen over the sanctity of the monument and its preservation against extremist groups.

===Vandalism and disrespectful behaviour===


There have been various incidents of vandalism. Despite Eisenman&#x27;s objections, for example, the pillars were protected by a graffiti-resistant coating because the government worried that neo-Nazis would try to spray paint them with swastikas. Indeed, swastikas were drawn on the stelae on five occasions in its first year. In 2009, swastikas and anti-Semitic slogans were found on 12 of the 2,700 gray stone slabs. In 2014, the German government promised to strengthen security at the memorial after a video published on the Internet showed a man urinating and people launching fireworks from its grey concrete structure on New Year&#x27;s Eve.

The monument is often used as a recreational space, inciting anger from those who see the playful use of the space as a desecration of the memorial. According to architecture critic Nicolai Ouroussoff, &quot;The day I visited the site, a 2-year-old boy was playing atop the pillarstrying to climb from one to the next as his mother calmly gripped his hand.&quot; A 2016 controversy occurred with the app &quot;Pokémon Go&quot;. &quot;The Foundation Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe told &quot;The Local&quot; that the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin has been reported as a site where people could find and catch Pokemon creatures through the augmented reality game&quot;. This caused anger among many people who felt that it was desecrating the site. &quot;This is a memorial space for the six million Jews who were murdered and it is inappropriate for this kind of game,&quot; said foundation spokeswoman Sarah Friedrich, adding that she hoped the company would remove the memorial as a possible location. In early 2017, an Israeli artist, Shahak Shapira, after noticing numerous instances on social media such as Facebook, Instagram, Tinder and Grindr of mostly young people posting smiling selfies with the memorial as a backdrop, or photos of themselves doing yoga or otherwise jumping or dancing on the memorial&#x27;s stone slabs, began an online art project juxtaposing those found images with archival pictures of Nazi death camps, to ironically point out the jarring disconnect of taking such inappropriately cheerful pictures in so somber a setting, calling it &quot;Yolocaust&quot;.

In January 2013, the blog &quot;Totem and Taboo&quot; posted a collection of profile pictures from the gay dating app Grindr, taken at the memorial. The emerging trend met with mixed responses: while Grindr&#x27;s then CEO Joel Simkhai, himself Jewish and gay, asserted that he was &quot;deeply moved&quot; that his app members &quot;take part in the memory of the holocaust&quot;, there was international criticism of use of the memorial as a backdrop for hookup profiles, which was held to be disrespectful.

On the 21 February 2025, a stabbing attack occurred at the Memorial, a 19-year-old Syrian refugee seriously wounded a 30-year-old Spanish man.

<doc id="806181" wikidata="Q4206984" url="?curid=806181" title="Methanol fuel">
<text>Methanol fuel is an alternative biofuel for internal combustion and other engines, either in combination with gasoline or independently. Methanol (CH3OH) is less expensive to sustainably produce than ethanol fuel, although it is more toxic than ethanol and has a lower energy density than gasoline. Methanol is safer for the environment than gasoline, is an anti-freeze agent, prevents dirt and grime buildup within the engine, has a higher ignition temperature and can withstand compression equivalent to that of super high-octane gasoline. It can readily be used in most modern engines. To prevent vapor lock due to being a simple, pure fuel, a small percentage of other fuel or certain additives can be included. Methanol may be made from fossil fuels or renewable resources, in particular natural gas and coal, or biomass respectively. In the case of the latter, it can be synthesized from CO (carbon dioxide) and hydrogen. The vast majority of methanol produced globally is currently made with gas and coal. However, projects, investments, and the production of green-methanol has risen steadily into 2023. Methanol fuel is currently used by racing cars in many countries and has seen increasing adoption by the maritime industry. 

In 2022, the worldwide biomethanol market was around 120 million USD. Most of it is currently made from biomass. Companies investing significantly in biomethanol production and research include Enerkem, Södra, Methanex, Alberta Pacific, and BASF. 

==History and production==
During the 1973 oil crisis, methanol produced from coal was suggested as a fuel to replace gasoline. In 2005, George A. Olah proposed a &quot;methanol economy&quot; based on energy storage in synthetically produced methanol.

In most countries, methanol is currently usually produced from syngas, obtained from steam reforming of methane (the chief constituent of natural gas). In China, which produced around 60% of the world&#x27;s methanol in 2014, it is made primarily from coal. However, to be viable as an environmentally friendly fuel, it will need to be produced from renewable feedstocks, the most significant of which is biomass. Methanol produced from biomass is sometimes called biomethanol. Biomethanol is primarily produced by gasification of biomass. Like traditional methanol production, this produces syngas. After removing hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide (sweetening), which form as side products during the gasification step, methanol can be made using conventional methods. This route can offer renewable methanol production from biomass at efficiencies up to 75%.

Production methods using carbon dioxide as a feedstock have also been proposed. This method involves reacting the carbon dioxide with hydrogen gas at high temperatures and pressures in the presence of a copper-based catalyst. The main drawback of this approach is the difficulty of isolating carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas in the required large volumes and high purity. A small amount of methanol is produced annually using carbon dioxide captured from industrial flue gas.

==Uses==

===Internal combustion engine fuel===
Because of methanol&#x27;s high octane rating of 114, it can achieve a higher thermal efficiency and power output compared to gasoline in engines developed for methanol use. However, it is also less volatile and burns at a lower temperature than gasoline, making it more difficult to start and warm up an engine in cold weather. In addition, its relatively low specific energy of around 17 MJ/kg (compared to 34 MJ/kg for gasoline) and air-to-fuel ratio of 6.4:1 mean that it suffers from higher fuel consumption than hydrocarbon fuels. Because it produces more water vapor when burned (similar to hydrogen combustion engines) and some acidic byproducts, increased wearing of engine components is likely. It may contain soluble contaminants like chloride ions, which makes it more corrosive. Insoluble contaminants, such as aluminum hydroxide, itself a product of corrosion by halide ions, clog the fuel system over time. Methanol is also hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs water vapor from the atmosphere. Because absorbed water dilutes the fuel value of the methanol (although it suppresses engine knock), and may cause phase separation of methanol-gasoline blends, containers of methanol fuels must be kept tightly sealed.

Compared to gasoline, methanol is more tolerant to exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), which improves fuel efficiency of the internal combustion engines utilizing Otto cycle and spark ignition.

An acid, albeit weak, methanol attacks the oxide coating that normally protects the aluminium from corrosion:

:6 CH3OH + Al2O3 → 2 Al(OCH3)3 + 3 H2O

The resulting methoxide salts are soluble in methanol, resulting in a clean aluminium surface, which is readily oxidized by dissolved oxygen. Also, the methanol can act as an oxidizer:

:6 CH3OH + 2 Al → 2 Al(OCH3)3 + 3 H2

This reciprocal process effectively fuels corrosion until either the metal is eaten away or the concentration of CH3OH is negligible. Methanol&#x27;s corrosivity has been addressed with methanol-compatible materials and fuel additives that serve as corrosion inhibitors.

Organic methanol, produced from wood or other organic materials (bioalcohol), has been suggested as a renewable alternative to petroleum-based hydrocarbons. Low levels of methanol can be used in existing vehicles with the addition of cosolvents and corrosion inhibitors.

===Racing===
High-octane fuel blends based on methanol were used extensively in European Grand Prix motor racing in the 1930s, and the most successful one with 86% methanol with acetone, nitrobenzene and ether additives was even commercially produced by the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey at the time.

Pure methanol is required by rule to be used in IndyCar, Monster Trucks, USAC sprint cars (as well as midgets, modifieds, &quot;etc.&quot;), and other dirt track series, such as World of Outlaws, and Motorcycle Speedway, mainly because, in the event of an accident, methanol does not produce an opaque cloud of smoke. Since the late 1940s, Methanol is also used as the primary fuel ingredient in the powerplants of radio control, control line and free flight model aircraft (see below), cars and trucks; such engines use a platinum filament glow plug that ignites the methanol vapor through a catalytic reaction. Drag racers, mud racers, and heavily modified tractor pullers also use methanol as the primary fuel source. Methanol is required with a supercharged engine in a Top Alcohol Dragster and, until the end of the 2006 season, all vehicles in the Indianapolis 500 had to run on methanol. As a fuel for mud racers, methanol mixed with gasoline and nitrous oxide produces more power than gasoline and nitrous oxide alone.

Beginning in 1965, pure methanol was used widespread in USAC Indy car competition, which at the time included the Indianapolis 500.

Safety was the predominant influence for the adoption of methanol fuel in the United States open-wheel racing categories. Unlike petroleum fires, methanol fires can be extinguished with plain water. A methanol-based fire burns invisibly, unlike gasoline, which burns with a visible flame. If a fire occurs on the track, there is no flame or smoke to obstruct the view of fast-approaching drivers, but this can also delay visual detection of the fire and the initiation of fire suppression. A seven-car crash on the second lap of the 1964 Indianapolis 500 resulted in USAC&#x27;s decision to encourage, and later mandate, the use of methanol. Eddie Sachs and Dave MacDonald died in the crash when their gasoline-fueled cars exploded. The gasoline-triggered fire created a dangerous cloud of thick black smoke that completely blocked the view of the track for oncoming cars. Johnny Rutherford, one of the other drivers involved, drove a methanol-fueled car, which also leaked following the crash. While this car burned from the impact of the first fireball, it formed a much smaller inferno than the gasoline cars and one that burned invisibly. That testimony, and pressure from &quot;The Indianapolis Star&quot; writer George Moore, led to the switch to alcohol fuel in 1965.

Methanol was used by the CART circuit during its entire campaign (1979–2007). It is also used by many short track organizations, especially midget, sprint cars, and speedway bikes. Pure methanol was used by the IRL from 1996 to 2006.

In 2006, in partnership with the ethanol industry, the IRL used a mixture of 10% ethanol and 90% methanol as its fuel. Starting in 2007, the IRL switched to &quot;pure&quot; ethanol, E100.

Methanol fuel is also used extensively in drag racing, primarily in the Top Alcohol category, while between 10% and 20% methanol may be used in Top Fuel classes in addition to Nitromethane.

Formula One racing continues to use gasoline as its fuel, but in prewar grand prix racing methanol was often used in the fuel.

=== Maritime transport ===

In 2020, the International Maritime Organization adopted MSC.1/Circular.1621 codifying the proper usage and provisions for methanol as a fuel, in response to its growing usage in the maritime and shipping industries. As of 2023, roughly 100 methanol-burning ships have been ordered by key players in the industry including Maersk, COSCO Shipping, and CMA CGM. The majority of these ships contain dual-fuel engines, meaning they are capable of burning both bunker fuel and methanol. 

Current challenges facing methanol as a fuel surround cost, availability, and emissions regulations. Retrofitting an oil barge to methanol can cost approximately $1.6M. Additionally, fossil-methanol increases the total GHG lifecycle and emissions through the production process. The vast majority of the global methanol output is fossil-based, which is produced using gas and coal. The availability of green-methanol (which is produced through zero or negative-carbon resources such as biomass) is currently limited and nearly twice the price of bunker fuel. However, accelerating the production of renewable methanol has been said not to be a significant global challenge, with many in the industry speculating that production could grow naturally as orders for methanol ships continue to be made. In 2023, the shipping-giant Maersk signed agreements with private green-methanol producers across various countries in order to fulfill the one million tons required to run its 19 ordered ships.

The United Arab Emirates is investing in refueling stations for green methanol in Egypt for the ships that use the Suez Canal.

===Fuel for model engines===

The earliest model engines for free-flight model aircraft flown before the end of World War II used a 3:1 mix of white gas and heavy viscosity motor oil for the two-stroke spark-ignition engines used for the hobby at that time. By 1948, the then-new innovation of glow plug-ignition model engines began to take over the market, requiring the use of methanol fuel to react in a catalytic reaction with the coiled platinum filament in a glow plug for the engine to run, usually using a castor oil-based lubricant contained in the fuel mix at about a 4:1 ratio. The glow-ignition variety of model engine, because it no longer required an onboard battery, ignition coil, ignition points and capacitor that a spark ignition model engine required, saved valuable weight and allowed model aircraft to have better flight performance. In their traditionally popular two-stroke and increasingly popular four-stroke forms, currently produced single-cylinder methanol-fueled glow engines are the usual choice for radio controlled aircraft for recreational use, for engine sizes that can range from 0.8 cm3 (0.049 cu.in.) to as large as 25 to 32 cm3 (1.5-2.0 cu.in) displacement, and significantly larger displacements for twin and multi-cylinder opposed-cylinder and radial configuration model aircraft engines, many of which are of four-stroke configuration. Most methanol-fueled model engines, especially those made outside North America, can easily be run on so-called &quot;FAI&quot;-specification methanol fuel. Such fuel mixtures can be required by the FAI for certain events in so-called FAI &quot;Class F&quot; international competition, that forbid the use of nitromethane as a glow engine fuel component. In contrast, firms in North America that make methanol-fueled model engines, or who are based outside that continent and have a major market in North America for such miniature powerplants, tend to produce engines that can and often do run best with a certain percentage of nitromethane in the fuel, which when used can be as little as 5% to 10% of volume, and can be as much as 25 to 30% of the total fuel volume.

===Cooking===
Methanol is used as a cooking fuel in China and its use in India is growing. Its stove and canister need no regulators or pipes.

=== Fuel cells ===
Methanol is used as fuel in fuel cells. Typically Reformed Methanol Fuel Cell (RMFC) or Direct Methanol Fuel Cell (DMFC) is used. Mobile and stationary applications are typical for methanol fuel cells such as backup power generation, power plant generation, emergency power supply, auxiliary power unit (APU) and battery range extension (electric vehicles, ships).

==Green methanol==
Green methanol is a liquid fuel that is produced from combining carbon dioxide and hydrogen () under pressure and heat with catalysts. It is a way to reuse carbon capture for recycling. Methanol can store hydrogen economically at standard outdoor temperatures and pressures, compared to liquid hydrogen and ammonia that need to use a lot of energy to stay cold in their liquid state. In 2023 the Laura Maersk was the first container ship to run on methanol fuel. Ethanol plants in the midwest are a good place for pure carbon capture to combine with hydrogen to make green methanol, with abundant wind and nuclear energy in Iowa, Minnesota, and Illinois. Mixing methanol with ethanol could make methanol a safer fuel to use because methanol doesn&#x27;t have a visible flame in the daylight and doesn&#x27;t emit smoke, and ethanol has a visible light yellow flame. Green hydrogen production of 70% efficiency and a 70% efficiency of methanol production from that would be a 49% energy conversion efficiency.

==Toxicity==

Methanol occurs naturally in the human body but is poisonous at high concentrations. The human body is capable of metabolizing and dealing with small amounts of methanol safely, such as from certain artificial sweeteners or fruit, temporarily resulting in toxic byproducts in the bloodstream like formic acid prior to excretion, whereas it is unable to safely metabolize more complex hydrocarbons like gasoline. Ingestion of 10 mL, however, can cause blindness and 60–100 mL can be fatal if the condition is untreated. Like many volatile chemicals, including ethanol and gasoline, methanol can damage skin, eyes, and lungs if exposed to substantial quantities. Those chronically exposed to such large quantities are at risk of developing long-term systemic health effects similar to low-grade methanol poisoning if left untreated.

US maximum allowed exposure in air (40 h/week) is 1900 mg/m3 for ethanol, 900 mg/m3 for gasoline, and 1260 mg/m3 for methanol. However, it is much less volatile than gasoline and therefore has lower evaporative emissions, producing a lower exposure risk for an equivalent spill. While methanol offers somewhat different toxicity exposure pathways, the effective toxicity is no worse than those of benzene or gasoline, and methanol poisoning is far easier to treat successfully. One substantial concern is that methanol poisoning generally must be treated while it is still asymptomatic for a full recovery.

Inhalation risk is mitigated by a characteristic pungent odor. At concentrations greater than 2,000 ppm (0.2%) it is generally quite noticeable, however, lower concentrations may remain undetected while still being potentially toxic over longer exposures, and may still present a fire/explosion hazard. Again, this is similar to gasoline and ethanol; standard safety protocols exist for methanol and are very similar to those for gasoline and ethanol.

The use of methanol fuel reduces the exhaust emissions of certain hydrocarbon-related toxins such as benzene and 1,3 butadiene and dramatically reduces long-term groundwater pollution caused by fuel spills. Unlike benzene-family fuels, methanol will rapidly and non-toxically biodegrade with no long-term harm to the environment as long as it is sufficiently diluted.

==Fire safety==
Methanol is far more difficult to ignite than gasoline and burns about 60% slower. A methanol fire releases energy at around 20% of the rate of a gasoline fire, resulting in a much cooler flame. This results in a much less dangerous fire that is easier to contain with proper protocols. Unlike gasoline fires, water is acceptable and even preferred as a fire suppressant for methanol fires, since this both cools the fire and rapidly dilutes the fuel below the concentration where it will maintain self-flammability. These facts mean that, as a vehicle fuel, methanol has great safety advantages over gasoline. Ethanol shares many of these same advantages.

Since methanol vapor is heavier than air, it will linger close to the ground or in a pit unless there is good ventilation, and if the concentration of methanol is above 6.7% in the air it can be lit by a spark and will explode above 54 F / 12 C. Once ablaze, an undiluted methanol fire gives off very little visible light, making it potentially very hard to see the fire or even estimate its size in bright daylight, although, in the vast majority of cases, existing pollutants or flammables in the fire (such as tires or asphalt) will color and enhance the visibility of the fire. Ethanol, natural gas, hydrogen, and other existing fuels offer similar fire-safety challenges, and standard safety and firefighting protocols exist for all such fuels.

Post-accident environmental damage mitigation is facilitated by the fact that low-concentration methanol is biodegradable, of low toxicity, and non-persistent in the environment. Post-fire cleanup often merely requires large additional amounts of water to dilute the spilled methanol followed by vacuuming or absorption recovery of the fluid. Any methanol that unavoidably escapes into the environment will have little long-term impact, and with sufficient dilution will rapidly biodegrade with little to no environmental damage due to toxicity. A methanol spill that combines with an existing gasoline spill can cause the mixed methanol/gasoline spill to persist about 30% to 35% longer than the gasoline alone would have done.

==Use==
In 2019, nearly 100 million tonnes of methanol were used, mainly for chemicals.

=== United States ===
The State of California ran an experimental program from 1980 to 1990 that allowed anyone to convert a gasoline vehicle to 85% methanol with 15% additives of choice. Over 500 vehicles were converted to high compression and dedicated use of the 85/15 methanol and ethanol.

In 1982 the big three were each given $5,000,000 for design and contracts for 5,000 vehicles to be bought by the State. It was an early use of low-compression flexible-fuel vehicles.

In 2005, California&#x27;s Governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, stopped the use of methanol to join the expanding use of ethanol driven by producers of corn. In 2007 ethanol was priced at 3 to 4 dollars per gallon (0.8 to 1.05 dollars per liter) at the pump, while methanol made from natural gas remains at 47 cents per gallon (12.5 cents per liter) in bulk, not at the pump.

Presently there are no operating gas stations in California supplying methanol in their pumps.
Rep. Eliot Engel [D-NY17] has introduced &quot;An Open Fuel Standard&quot; Act in Congress: &quot;To require automobile manufacturers to ensure that not less than 80 percent of the automobiles manufactured or sold in the United States by each such manufacturer to operate on fuel mixtures containing 85 percent ethanol, 85 percent methanol, or biodiesel.&quot;

===European Union===
The amended Fuel Quality Directive adopted in 2009 allows up to 3% v/v blend-in of methanol in petrol.

=== Brazil ===
A drive to add an appreciable percentage of methanol to gasoline got very close to implementation in Brazil, following a pilot test set up by a group of scientists involving blending gasoline with methanol between 1989 and 1992. The larger-scale pilot experiment that was to be conducted in São Paulo was vetoed at the last minute by the city&#x27;s mayor, out of concern for the health of gas station workers, who would not be expected to follow safety precautions. , the idea has not resurfaced. 

=== India ===
Niti Aayog, the central planning institute of India, announced on 3 August 2018 that if feasible, passenger vehicles will run on 15% Methanol blended petrol. At present, vehicles in India use up to 10% ethanol-blended fuel. If approved by the government it will cut monthly fuel costs by 10%. In 2021, ethanol costs Rs 60 a litre, while the price of methanol has been estimated at less than Rs 25 a litre.
