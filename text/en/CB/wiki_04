<text>Dragon is a New Zealand rock band which was formed in Auckland in January 1972, and, from 1975, based in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The band was originally fronted by singer Graeme Collins, but rose to fame with singer Marc Hunter and is currently led by his brother, bass player and co-founder Todd Hunter. The group performed, and released material, under the name Hunter in Europe and the United States during 1987.

Keyboard player Paul Hewson wrote or co-wrote most of the group&#x27;s 1970s hits: &quot;April Sun in Cuba&quot; peaked at No. 9 in New Zealand and No. 2 in Australia; &quot;Are You Old Enough?&quot; reached No. 6 in New Zealand and No. 1 in Australia in 1978; and &quot;Still in Love with You&quot; reached No. 35 and No. 27 in each country respectively that same year. Later hits, from when the band re-grouped in the 1980s, were written by other band members, often working with outside associates: The Hunter brothers, with Todd&#x27;s partner, Johanna Pigott, wrote &quot;Rain&quot;, a No. 2 hit in 1983, while other, more minor hits were written by the Hunters and/or Alan Mansfield, frequently in collaboration with any combination of Pigott, Mansfield&#x27;s partner Sharon O&#x27;Neill, Marc Hunter&#x27;s partner Wendy Hunter, or producers Todd Rundgren and David Hirschfelder.

The name &quot;Dragon&quot; came from a consultation of I Ching cards by founder vocalist Graeme Collins.

Dragon has endured tragedy, adversity and notoriety, and three band members have died from drug-related causes. Problems began soon after the band&#x27;s arrival in Sydney in late 1975, when all of their equipment was stolen. Several months later, in 1976, drummer Neil Storey died of a heroin overdose. The following decade, in 1985, Paul Hewson died from a drug overdose. Marc Hunter died from smoking-related throat cancer in 1998. Several members of the group including Hewson and Marc Hunter were heavy heroin users during the band&#x27;s heyday and the Stewart Royal Commission (1980–1983) which investigated the &quot;Mr. Asia&quot; drug syndicate obtained evidence that Dragon members were clients. Two members were involved in a serious car crash in 1977, when Paul Hewson&#x27;s neck was in a brace as well as having a broken arm and Robert Taylor needed plastic surgery, and Hewson also suffered from debilitating scoliosis and arthritis, the pain of which reportedly contributed to his heroin use. The band also undertook a famously disastrous 1978 tour of the US, supporting Johnny Winter, which ended when Marc Hunter abused a Texan audience as &quot;faggots&quot; and the band were pelted off stage, while Winter&#x27;s band were said to have taken bets about how long it would be before Hunter was shot. On 1 July 2008, the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) recognised the Auckland-formed band&#x27;s iconic status in its country by inducting Dragon into the ARIA Hall of Fame.

==History==
===1972–1975: Early years===
Dragon formed in Auckland in January 1972 with a line-up that featured Todd Hunter on bass guitar, guitarist Ray Goodwin, drummer Neil Reynolds and singer/pianist Graeme Collins. All had been in various short-lived bands in Auckland, and Collins is credited with using I Ching to provide the name Dragon. Their first major gig was an appearance at the Great Ngaruawahia Music Festival in early January 1973. By 1974 several personnel changes had occurred, with Todd Hunter&#x27;s younger brother, Marc Hunter, joining on vocals and Neil Storey on drums. The band recorded two progressive rock albums in Auckland, &quot;Universal Radio&quot; in June 1974 and &quot;Scented Gardens for the Blind&quot; in February 1975 both on Vertigo Records. Despite being one of Auckland&#x27;s top live attractions by late 1974, neither albums nor related singles had any local chart success, and they recruited Robert Taylor (ex-Mammal) on guitar as they searched for a raunchier pop sound. By early 1975, manager Graeme Nesbitt (ex-Mammal), who had obtained regular gigs and organised their first New Zealand tours, felt they should tackle the larger Australian market. Nesbitt was unable to travel with them to Australia as he had been arrested for selling drugs.

===1975–1979: Australasian stardom===
Dragon relocated to Sydney, Australia, in May 1975 and toured the country as support act to Status Quo in October. They recorded the single &quot;Starkissed&quot; for PolyGram, but it was not commercially successful. The band then sent for keyboard player Paul Hewson (not to be confused with Bono, frontman of Irish rock band U2) who had a reputation in New Zealand as a pop songwriter. Hewson had been scouted by Nesbitt when Dragon were still in New Zealand but had declined to join at that time. The group had originally intended to go to Canada, but opted to stay in Australia, settling in Bondi in late 1975, where they secured a residency at the Bondi Lifesaver club. On the recommendation of fellow New Zealand expatriate Mike Rudd, CBS house producer Peter Dawkins went to see the group at the Recovery Wine Bar in Camperdown, Sydney, in early 1976 and he was so impressed by their performance and Hewson&#x27;s material that he immediately signed them to a contract with CBS Records. Often courting or creating controversy, the band was rocked by the heroin overdose death of 22-year-old drummer Neil Storey in September 1976. By then, founding member Ray Goodwin had left the group and their single &quot;This Time&quot; had begun charting.

Dragon considered disbanding after Storey&#x27;s death, but Todd Hunter consulted with Nesbitt who advised him to continue and organised for Kerry Jacobson (ex-Mammal) to join on drums. Between 1977 and 1979 the Hunter brothers, Taylor, Hewson and Jacobson had a string of major hits on the Australian charts with singles &quot;April Sun in Cuba&quot;, &quot;Are You Old Enough?&quot; and &quot;Still in Love with You&quot; and albums &quot;Sunshine&quot; (February 1977), &quot;Running Free&quot; (November 1977) and &quot;O Zambezi&quot; (September 1978). These releases, and their dynamic concert performances, made them one of Australia&#x27;s most popular rock acts. They attempted a breakthrough into the American market with a tour supporting Johnny Winter, starting in November 1978, but this was foiled after a disastrous show in Dallas, Texas, at which Marc Hunter incited a crowd by suggesting all Texans were &quot;faggots&quot;: band members had to dodge flying beer bottles.

In 1994, Marc Hunter related his version of the Texas show to rock journalist Glenn A. Baker:
In their 1970s heyday Dragon were regulars on the teen-oriented national TV pop show &quot;Countdown&quot;, which greatly enhanced their sales and popularity, with Marc Hunter hosting the show on several occasions, but the band&#x27;s darker side, especially Marc&#x27;s unpredictable stage behaviour, were often in evidence at their live performances. Singer and actress Jane Clifton (who played Margo Gaffney in &quot;Prisoner&quot;) relates a time when she saw them live:
Soon after returning to Sydney from the US, Marc Hunter was sacked from Dragon in February 1979 due to his drug and alcohol use, which was seriously affecting both his vocal performances and his general health. According to Todd Hunter:
To replace Marc, the band recruited singer Billy Rogers, formerly of Perth group Last Chance Cafe, and violinist Richard Lee from Melbourne band Sidewinder. Dragon recorded the commercially unsuccessful &quot;Power Play&quot; (September 1979) album before breaking up in December 1979.

===1979–1982: First split===
Marc Hunter cleaned up in the post-Dragon years and released two successful solo singles, &quot;Island Nights&quot; (1979) from &quot;Fiji Bitter&quot; and &quot;Big City Talk&quot; (1981) from &quot;Big City Talk&quot;. &quot;Big City Talk&quot;&#x27;s video was filmed in the Broadway Tunnel, a long and dreary pedestrian walkway linking Sydney&#x27;s Central Station with Broadway. It captured the seedy and unsettling atmosphere of the tunnel, adding extra mood to the song&#x27;s words.

Todd Hunter had meanwhile teamed up with his domestic partner (and later second wife) Johanna Pigott, formerly of indie punk group XL Capris, who later fronted the alternative rock band, Scribble. Together they became a successful songwriting team, with credits including the John Farnham hit &quot;Age of Reason&quot;. XL Capris were not commercially successful, although their memorable re-working of crooner Tommy Leonetti&#x27;s &quot;My City Of Sydney&quot; became a minor cult classic. Todd Hunter produced both their albums &quot;Where&#x27;s Hank?&quot; (March 1981) and &quot;Weeds&quot; (October 1981), and was a member of the band for the second.

Paul Hewson moved back to Auckland and joined the Pink Flamingos, who became one of New Zealand&#x27;s top musical acts in the early 1980s. They were led by Dave McArtney formerly of Hello Sailor which had toured with Dragon but had also split.

===1982–1997: Reformation===
Dragon reformed in August 1982 to pay off outstanding debts, but Kerry Jacobson left the band soon after the reformation, for health reasons. He was replaced by noted British drummer Terry Chambers, formerly of XTC. Chambers, who quit XTC in 1983 after they were forced to stop touring (due to leader Andy Partridge&#x27;s debilitating stage fright), had married his Australian girlfriend and settled in Newcastle, New South Wales. Dragon decided to stay together when their second comeback single, &quot;Rain&quot;, proved to be a No. 2 hit in 1983, American keyboard player and Dragon&#x27;s producer Alan Mansfield also joined. Mansfield had worked for Robert Palmer (including guitar for the &quot;Johnny and Mary&quot; single from Palmer&#x27;s album &quot;Clues&quot;) and Bette Midler in the late 1970s, by 1982 Alan Mansfield was living in Sydney and produced tracks for Marc Hunter. Marc Hunter convinced Mansfield to also produce Dragon&#x27;s single &quot;Rain&quot;.

Dragon&#x27;s June 1984 album &quot;Body and the Beat&quot; became one of the biggest-selling albums in Australia and New Zealand and was certified gold in Australia in the week of release. Their public profile was further raised by Marc Hunter&#x27;s solo album, &quot;Communication&quot;. Its title track became a moderate hit in Australia and featured a loosely cabaret-oriented video-clip filmed in Amsterdam in which Marc – resplendent in a bright red cowboy hat – was flanked by two women who also danced away under red Stetsons. &quot;Body and the Beat&quot; yielded further successful Australasian singles, notably &quot;Magic&quot; and &quot;Cry&quot;, but the &#x27;new&#x27; Dragon and the ascendancy of the Hunter-Piggot team also marked the rapidly declining influence of the band&#x27;s former songwriting powerhouse, Paul Hewson, who only managed one co-writing credit on the album. Alan Mansfield and New Zealand-born singer-songwriter Sharon O&#x27;Neill met on Dragon&#x27;s Body and the Beat tour: they later became domestic and professional partners.

Paul Hewson left Dragon in late 1984 and returned to New Zealand where he died of an accidental drug overdose on 9 January 1985. During 1984 Hewson had shared an apartment in Elizabeth Bay, Sydney, with singer-songwriter Paul Kelly, who had recently arrived from Melbourne, and was trying to relaunch his career. He and Hewson became close friends. In May 1985, four months after Hewson&#x27;s death, Kelly released his breakthrough solo album &quot;Post&quot;, which dealt extensively with themes of addiction and was dedicated to Hewson&#x27;s memory. Terry Chambers and Robert Taylor left some time after. Dragon performed three songs for 13 July 1985 Oz for Africa concert (part of the global Live Aid program) – &quot;Speak No Evil&quot;, &quot;Rain&quot; and &quot;Are You Old Enough?&quot;; which was broadcast in Australia (on both Seven Network and Nine Network) and on MTV in the US. American drummer Doane Perry replaced Chambers, and Taylor was eventually succeeded by local Sydney guitar ace Tommy Emmanuel. This line-up went to America to record the Todd Rundgren-produced &quot;Dreams of Ordinary Men&quot; album in August 1986 and toured Europe with Tina Turner under the name Hunter in 1987. By this time Alan Mansfield was writing with Sharon O&#x27;Neill; they wrote &quot;Western Girls&quot; for &quot;Dreams of Ordinary Men&quot; and then three tracks for Sharon&#x27;s 1987 fifth solo album &quot;Danced in the Fire&quot;.

Dragon briefly split up in 1988 but the Hunter brothers and Alan Mansfield then regrouped with guitarist Randall Waller and drummer Barton Price (ex-Models) for the &quot;Bondi Road&quot; album released in April 1989 on RCA, it also featured Emmanuel&#x27;s guitar work. &quot;Bondi Road&quot; reached No. 18 on the Australian albums charts and the single &quot;Young Years&quot; written by Alan Mansfield and Sharon O&#x27;Neill also reached No. 18. The pair had written two other tracks: &quot;Ice in this Town&quot; and &quot;Good Time Girl&quot;. Dragon continued to record and tour with varying line-ups centred around the Hunter brothers and Mansfield. They also supported Elton John for his 1990 Australian tour. Todd Hunter worked on &quot;Heartbreak High&quot; (TV series) from 1994 for six years as Music Composer, he retired from Dragon in 1995 after the release of &quot;Incarnations&quot;.

Dragon continued on without Todd Hunter. Then, in November 1997, Marc Hunter was diagnosed with severe throat cancer and died on 17 July 1998. A memorial service for him was held at St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral in Sydney, followed by an all-star benefit concert to raise money to support Marc&#x27;s widow and child. A compilation CD, &quot;Forever Young&quot;, was released on Raven Records, highlighting his solo career.

===1997–2006: Second split===
Dragon broke up a second time after Marc Hunter&#x27;s illness had been diagnosed. Todd Hunter continued composing music for TV and film with &quot;Heartbreak High&quot; to 1999, &quot;Walk the Talk&quot; (2000 film), &quot;Out There&quot; (2003 TV series) and &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; (2008 BBC-TV series). Alan Mansfield and Sharon O&#x27;Neill continued songwriting including &quot;True Love&quot; co-written with Robert Palmer for his 1999 album &quot;Rhythm and Blues&quot;. They both performed with Leo Sayer during his tours in 2006 and 2007, Sharon O&#x27;Neill would sing &quot;Young Years&quot; in honour of Marc Hunter.

===2006–present: ARIA Hall of Fame and Mark Williams years===
Todd Hunter (bass) reformed Dragon in 2006 with a line-up of Mark Williams (vocals, guitar), Bruce Reid (guitar) and Pete Drummond (drums). The new line-up released &quot;Sunshine to Rain&quot; on the Liberation Blue label.

Dragon were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame by Richard Wilkins on 1 July 2008. The band was joined on-stage by James Reyne and Ian Moss to perform &quot;April Sun in Cuba&quot; and &quot;Rain&quot;:
In March 2009, Dragon released online albums of previously unreleased material, including live albums. In October 2009, they released &quot;Happy I Am&quot; on Ozmo Records, distributed internationally by MGM Records.

In September 2011, Dragon released an EP titled &quot;Chase The Sun&quot; and in November, &quot;The Great Divide&quot;. The band continues to tour, including the Rhythm and Vines Festival in New Zealand in 2011, The 40th anniversary Tour, The Long Way to the Top, The Red Hot Summer Tour with Jimmy Barnes across 2012/13. A 2-CD set compilation was released in 2012 titled &quot;The Dragon Years – 40th Anniversary Collection&quot; which peaked at number 21 in New Zealand.

In 2012, their single &quot;Are You Old Enough?&quot; was used in the opening credits of Australian television drama series &quot;Puberty Blues&quot;.

Alan Mansfield, the group&#x27;s keyboardist from 1983 to 1997, died on 16 October 2024 at the age of 72.

<doc id="795941" wikidata="Q5287398" url="?curid=795941" title="Doctor Syn on the High Seas">
<text>Doctor Syn on the High Seas is the second in the series of Doctor Syn novels by Russell Thorndike. Published in 1936, it is chronologically the first novel in the series, followed by &quot;Doctor Syn Returns&quot;, though it was the fourth in terms of publication. 

==Plot==
Set in 1754. A young clergyman, Christopher Syn, loses his wife to a seducer. He embarks on a quest of vengeance, taking on the identity of the pirate Captain Clegg to hunt them down over the course of many years.

The book ends with Syn returning to his home of Dymchurch in 1775, resuming his life as a vicar.

==Critical reception==
The novel was anticipated by Thorndike&#x27;s fans, according to &quot;The Liverpool Echo&quot;, which praised it as a &quot;salt breath of Channel air&quot;. &quot;Stirring stuff,&quot; said the &quot;Evening Express&quot; critic, who described the character as overstuffed but popular. The &quot;Kentish Express&quot; found it enjoyable but improbable.

==Publication==
Originally published by Rich &amp; Cowan in 1936, it has been reprinted many times in both hardcover and paperback editions, including by Cherry Tree Books (1938), Arrow Books (1959), Panther (1964), Jarrolds (1966), Ballantine Books (1973) and other more recent small presses. It is dedicate to John Buchan.

==In other media==
In 2006, an abridged version of the novel was broadcast on BBC Radio 4. Comprising half of a ten-part series titled &quot;Doctor Syn&quot;, it was read by Rufus Sewell.

Peter Cushing, in preparation for his role in the 1962 film &quot;Captain Clegg&quot;, read several Thorndike novels, including &quot;Doctor Syn on the High Seas&quot;. The novel&#x27;s description of Syn&#x27;s hair turning white inspired Cushing&#x27;s on-screen appearance.

<text>Mottershead is an English habitation name which has its common root in the township of Mottram St. Andrew in Cheshire, England where it was first recorded in the 13th century as &quot;Mottresheved&quot;, from the genitive case of the Old English byname &quot;Mōtere&quot; &#x27;Speaker&#x27; and Middle English head (land), hill. The motto of the family is the Latin &quot;Pro Amore Patriae&quot; (&quot;For the love of the homelands&quot;)

There are references to the place name &quot;Mottresheved&quot; in the Domesday Book. The name also may denote a building where village assemblies were held.

<doc id="795952" wikidata="Q654233" url="?curid=795952" title="Geography of the British Indian Ocean Territory">
<text>The British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) is an archipelago of 55 islands in the Indian Ocean, located south of India. It is situated approximately halfway between Africa and Indonesia. The islands form a semicircular group with an open sea towards the east. The largest, Diego Garcia, is located at the southern extreme end. It measures and accounts for almost three-quarters of the total land area of the territory. Diego Garcia is the only inhabited island and is home to the joint UK-US naval support facility. Other islands within the archipelago include Danger Island, Three Brothers Islands, Nelson Island, and Peros Banhos, as well as the island groups of the Egmont Islands, Eagle Islands, and the Salomon Islands.

==Physical geography==
BIOT is an archipelago of 55 islands. They were annexed by the UK in 1965 under the Treaty of Paris from a much larger archipelago which in 1804 consisted of 2,300 independent islands. BIOT is situated in the Indian Ocean near the Equator. It is roughly halfway between Africa and Indonesia, about southwest of India. It is situated approximately from South India and to the south of the Maldives With a coastline stretching , it is the southern extension of the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge. The Chagos Islands archipelago are northeast of Mauritius, while Agalega Islands are due north. The islands are characterised as coral atolls whose formation occurred at the summits of volcanic mountains these being submerged. The terrain is flat and low, with most areas not exceeding above sea level.

The climate is tropical marine; hot, humid, and moderated by trade winds. It is located outside the route of the cyclones.

===Marine reserve===
The lagoon that surrounds the atoll has an area of about . The maximum water depth in the lagoon is about . The width of the coral reef varies from with a shallow depth of about on the seaward side. The area covered by the fringing seaward reef shelf is about . The bed slope noted at the outer edge of the reef shelf is steep towards the deeper end; the depth drops to more than in some areas within distance from the shore.

In 2010, the whole territory, as well as of ocean around the islands, was declared a marine reserve. It is known formally as the Chagos Marine Protected Area, because it is a &quot;pristine ocean ecosystem now representing 16% of the world&#x27;s fully protected coral reef.&quot; Fishing is banned within the reserve area. Diego Garcia is a Ramsar site.

===Landforms===
Of the 55 islands of the Chagos Archipelago, Diego Garcia is the largest. Aside from this, the main islands are the Egmont Islands, Danger Island, Aigle (Eagle) Islands, Three Brothers, Nelson Island, Salomon Islands, and Peros Banhos at the northern end of the Chagos Archipelago.

===Diego Garcia===

The coral atoll of Diego Garcia is approximately east of the coast of Africa (at Tanzania), south-southwest of the southern tip of India (at Kanyakumari) and west-northwest of the west coast of Australia (at Cape Range National Park, Western Australia). Diego Garcia lies at the southernmost tip of the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge — a vast submarine range in the Indian Ocean. The total area encompassed by the atoll is . At the entrance to the lagoon, there are three small islands, and these are East Island (), Middle Island (), and West Island (). In some areas, the atoll has both marshes and wetlands. The ecosystem consists of undisturbed tropical forests.
===Peros Banhos Atoll===
The Peros Banhos Islands, which are the largest group on the Chagos Bank, consists of 27 islands scattered around the rim of an immense lagoon, which has a perimeter of and enclosed some 310 square km of water. They consist of several groups of islets and reefs; deep channels separate them. They had a population of some 400 islanders before the evacuation in 1965, the largest number living on Île du Coin in the southwest corner of the atoll (in the previous century, the dominant island was Île Diamant in the northwest corner of the atoll); in all, there were seven inhabited islands.

===Salomon Atoll===

Some 25 km east of Peros Banhos Atoll, the smaller Salomon group comprises eleven islands clustered around a lagoon measuring 8 km long and 5 km wide. Prior to the removal of its population, six of the islands were inhabited with a total of about 250 islanders. Île Boddam in the southwest was the principal settlement, while Île Takamaka in the east was the centre of boatbuilding for the archipelago.

===Nelson Island, Three Brother Islands and Eagle Islands===
Lying between Diego Garcia in the south, and the Peros Banhos and Salomon Atolls in the north, the remaining coralline islands are scattered over a wide area of the Great Chagos Bank, an area of atolls, reefs and shoals with an average depth of water of some 20 metres. Uninhabited Île Nelson lies 35 km south of Salomon Atoll. A hundred km to the southwest of Nelson are the 3 islands of Trois Frères, which were briefly inhabited in the 19th century. Further west lies the Île d&#x27;Aigle, which was inhabited until 1935. Île Vache Marine, the southernmost of the Eagle Islands, lies south.

===Danger Island===
Île Danger, 20 km south of Île d&#x27;Aigle, has never been inhabited; it is a long and flat island with a maximum width of . It is covered with tall coconut trees and shrubs.

===Six Îles, or Egmont Atoll===
Finally, Six Îles Atoll (also called Egmont), further south of Danger, was also occupied for short periods during the mid 19th century until 1935. Besides the six named islands, the atoll also includes a seventh unnamed island. The atoll, in the form of &quot;U&quot;, is a small strip of land with width varying from to a maximum of at its northern extremity. The total land area of the atoll is . A fringing reef circumscribes the atoll. There are two openings into the ocean. It almost encompasses a large lagoon. The lagoon itself is in length and is more than in width. Rounded pumice stones found on the eastern beach of the island by one of the explorers of the island have been inferred as debris from the Krakatoa volcanic eruption of 1883 The atoll is to the northwest of Diego Garcia, on the Great Chagos Bank. The islands are connected by reefs which are steep and there are no locations for anchorage on its shores.

==Human geography==
In the late 18th century, coconut palm plantations were established on the island to produce copra for which slave labourers were brought in from Africa. A small population lived in the archipelago, descendants of Mauritian laborers working the copra industry. After an agreement was signed in 1966 between Britain and the United States, the US built a military base and forcibly evacuated all indigenous people; 1,200 from Diego Garcia, Ile du Coin, and Île Boddam were relocated to Mauritius, while others went to the Seychelles. In 2000, the Chagos islanders won an appeal which restored their authority to live on the islands, and they received UK citizenship in the following year. A 2008 court decision blocked their return. Further complications arose after the 2010 establishment of the world&#x27;s largest marine reserve as the islanders&#x27; commercial fishing capabilities, if they returned to the archipelago, would be curtailed, thus hampering their traditional livelihood.

<doc id="795960" wikidata="Q1303633" url="?curid=795960" title="Eihei-ji">
<text>is one of two main temples of the Sōtō school of Zen Buddhism, the largest single religious denomination in Japan (by number of temples in a single legal entity). The other is Sōji-ji in Yokohama. Eihei-ji is located about east of Fukui in Fukui Prefecture, Japan. In English, its name means &quot;temple of eternal peace&quot; (in Japanese, &#x27;ei&#x27; means &quot;eternal&quot;, &#x27;hei&#x27; means &quot;peaceful&quot;, and &#x27;ji&#x27; means &quot;Buddhist temple&quot;).

Its founder was Eihei Dōgen, who brought Sōtō Zen from China to Japan during the 13th century. The ashes of Dōgen and a memorial to him are in the &quot;Jōyōden&quot; (the Founder&#x27;s Hall) at Eihei-ji. William Bodiford of UCLA writes that, &quot;The rural monastery Eiheiji in particular aggrandized Dōgen to bolster its own authority &quot;vis-à-vis&quot; its institutional rivals within the Sōtō denomination.&quot;

Eihei-ji is a training monastery with more than two hundred monks and nuns in residence. As of 2003, Eihei-ji had 800,000 visitors per year, less than half the number of tourists who came ten years before. Visitors with Zen experience may participate after making prior arrangements, and all visitors are treated as religious trainees.

In keeping with Zen&#x27;s Mahayana tradition, the iconography in various buildings is an array of potential confusion for newcomers: at the &quot;Sanmon&quot; are four kings standing guard named &quot;Shitenno&quot;; the Buddha hall&#x27;s main altar has three statues of Buddhas past, present and future; the &quot;Hatto&quot; displays &quot;Kannon&quot; the bodhisattva of compassion, and four white lions (called the &quot;a-un no shishi&quot;); the &quot;Yokushitsu&quot; has &quot;Baddabara&quot;; the &quot;Sanshokaku&quot; has a statue of &quot;Hotei&quot;; and the &quot;Tosu&quot; displays &quot;Ucchusma&quot;.

== History ==

Dōgen founded Eihei-ji in 1244 with the name &quot;Sanshoho Daibutsuji&quot; in the woods of rural Japan, quite far from the distractions of Kamakura period urban life. He appointed a successor, but sometime after his death the abbacy of Eihei-ji became hotly disputed, a schism now called the &quot;sandai sōron&quot;. Until 1468, Eihei-ji was not held by the current Keizan line of Sōtō, but by the line of Dōgen&#x27;s Chinese disciple Jakuen. After 1468, when the Keizan line took ownership of Eihei-ji in addition to its major temple Sōji-ji and others, Jakuen&#x27;s line and other alternate lines became less prominent.

As Eihei-ji and Sōji-ji became rivals over the centuries, Eihei-ji made claims based on the fact of Dōgen&#x27;s original residence there. William Bodiford of UCLA wrote:
The entire temple was destroyed by fire several times. During the late 16th century, disciples of Ikkō-shū attacked and burned the temple and surrounding buildings. Its oldest standing structure dates from 1794.

==Physical layout==

Today the temple grounds cover about . The &quot;Butsuden&quot; (Buddha hall) main altar carries statues of the Buddhas of the Three Times: right to left, Amida Butsu (past), Shakyamuni Butsu (present), and Miroku Bosatsu (future).

Among the temple&#x27;s 70 structures are the &quot;Sanmon&quot; (gate), &quot;Hatto&quot; (lecture hall), &quot;Sōdo&quot; (Priest&#x27;s or meditation hall), &quot;Daiku-in&quot; (kitchen, three stories and a basement), &quot;Yokushitsu&quot; (bath) and &quot;Tosu&quot; (toilet, Dōgen&#x27;s &quot;Shōbōgenzō&quot; includes a chapter on manners appropriate for the toilet. Most of his rules are still followed today). The &quot;Shōrō&quot; (belfry) holds the &quot;obon sho&quot;, the great brahman bell. The &quot;Shidoden&quot; (Memorial Hall) contains thousands of tablets for deceased laypersons. The &quot;Joyoden&quot; (Founders hall) contains the ashes of Dōgen and his successors. Here, images of the deceased are served food daily like they are living teachers. The &quot;Kichijokaku&quot; (visitor&#x27;s center) is a large four-story modern building for lay persons, with kitchen, bath, sleeping rooms and a hall for zazen.

The bronze temple bell dates to 1327 and is an Important Cultural Property. The Sanmon and Central Gate date from the 1794 rebuilding and are Prefectural Cultural Properties. A number of important manuscripts belong to the temple, including the National Treasure &quot;Universally Recommended Instructions for Zazen&quot;, by temple founder Dōgen (1233); teachings he brought back from Song China (1227); and a record of a subsidy for the earlier Sanmon in the hand of Emperor Go-En&#x27;yū (1372).

Spread over a hillside, the complex is surrounded by cedar trees, some tall and as old as the temple. It is surrounded by bright green moss-covered boulders, and Japanese maples that turn red and gold during autumn.

==Training==

Today, Eihei-ji is the main training temple of Sōtō Zen. The standard training for a priest in Eihei-ji is from three months to a two-year period of practice. It is in communion with all Japanese Soto Zen temples, and some temples in America, including the San Francisco Zen Center.

Fukuyama Taiho Zenji is the head priest or abbot, who oversees trainees at Eihei-ji, and also serves as the head priest of Sotoshu (the Sōtō school of Zen) for two years beginning late January 2012. Head priests at Eihei-ji and Sōji-ji alternate terms leading Sotoshu. Fukuyama Zenji is serving his second term (his first term was from January 2008 to January 2010).

About two hundred or two hundred fifty priests and nuns in training are in residence. A single tatami, a by mat laid in rows on a raised platform called a &quot;tan&quot; in a common room, is provided for each trainee to eat, sleep, and meditate on.

The monks start their day at 3:30 a.m., or one hour later during winter, when they do zazen and read and chant sutras. Breakfast is a bowl of rice gruel with pickles. Then they do chores: clean, weed and, if needed, shovel snow. The floors and corridors have been polished smooth by daily cleaning for hundreds of years. Then they read and chant again. Dinner at 5 p.m. is meagre and ritualized: the position of the bowl and utensils is observed. Zazen or a lecture follows before bed at 9 p.m. The trainees shave each other&#x27;s heads and take a bath every five days (every time the date contains a 4 or 9).
Eihei-ji has sought, since medieval times, a source of income by soliciting monks to purchase honorary titles. Monks may progress through four &quot;hōkai&quot; (dharma ranks) with some time requirements of months or years between ranks. The final step in becoming a priest is which means becoming (abbot for one night) at both head temples (Eihei-ji and Sōji-ji). &quot;Zuise&quot; entails paying each temple 50,000 yen (about 605 as of April 2012) for the ceremony (and about 50 to the official photographer). A monk receives an honorary meal and a bag of souvenirs at Eihei-ji and then, within one month, repeats the ceremony at Sōji-ji. The monk is then considered an &quot;oshō&quot; (priest and teacher).

==Tourism==

Visitors must dress modestly and keep silent. They may attend one to three day meditation retreats for a fee. Each visitor receives a list of rules, for example photography of the priests-in-training is prohibited. More than one million visitors used to pass through the gates of Eihei-ji, but as of 2003 only 800,000 came, a period in which the train service from Fukui to nearby Eiheijiguchi Station was temporarily halted.

A memorial service, a major source of revenue for Eihei-ji, has been held every fifty years since the 16th century on the anniversary of Dōgen &quot;Zenji&quot;&#x27;s entering nirvana. For example, in 1752 about 23,700 monks attended, which raised enough money to rebuild the main gate. Groups from all over the world including a group from San Francisco formed to make a pilgrimage to Eihei-ji for the 750th anniversary in 2002.

In 1905, Eihei-ji held its first conference called &quot;Genzō e&quot; on Dōgen Zenji&#x27;s &quot;Shōbōgenzō&quot;. It succeeded in attracting so many interested parties that it became an annual event. Monks and laypersons, along with academic and popular writers can attend workshops each year.

The Ichijōdani Asakura Family Historic Ruins and museum are about from Fukui and are reachable from the temple. Five generations of the Asakura &quot;daimyō&quot; clan lived there until 1573, when the town was razed by Oda Nobunaga loyalists.

==Denuclearization==
Following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, according to &quot;Religious Dispatches&quot; magazine, Eihei-ji &quot;mobilized clergy to accompany members of its volunteer organization Shanti International Association who will travel to northeastern Japan to aid in relief efforts&quot;.

Then in November 2011, priests at Eihei-ji held a symposium for 300 people called &quot;Cherish Our Lives: The Way of Living that We don&#x27;t Choose Nuclear Power Generation&quot; on the subject of denuclearization. Two reactors in Fukui Prefecture were given the names of bodhisattvas: Monju Nuclear Power Plant and Fugen Nuclear Power Plant. The chairman of the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation had apparently misunderstood upon visiting the temple. When he told the abbot the proposed names, the &quot;Zenji&quot; had replied, &quot;That&#x27;s nice.&quot; After the symposium, a priest explained, &quot;We have realized that the nuclear power generation goes against life on the earth.&quot;

<doc id="795963" wikidata="Q1072396" url="?curid=795963" title="Töregene Khatun">
<text>Töregene Khatun (also Turakina, , ) (d. 1246) was the Great Khatun and regent of the Mongol Empire from the death of her husband Ögedei Khan in 1241 until the election of her eldest son Güyük Khan in 1246.

==Background==

Töregene was born into the Naiman tribe. Her first husband was a member of the Merkit clan. Some sources state that his name was Qudu (d. 1217), son of Toqto&#x27;a Beki of the Merkits. However, Rashid-al-Din Hamadani named her first husband as Dayir Usun of the Merkits. When Genghis conquered the Merkits in 1204, he gave Töregene to Ögedei as his second wife. While Ögedei&#x27;s first wife Boraqchin had no sons, Töregene gave birth to five sons, Güyük, Kötän, Köchü, Qarachar, and Qashi (father of Kaidu).

She eclipsed all of Ögedei&#x27;s other wives and gradually increased her influence among the court officials. But Töregene still resented Ögedei&#x27;s officials and the policy of centralizing the administration and lowering tax burdens. Töregene sponsored the reprinting of the Taoist canon in North China. Through the influence of Töregene, Ögedei appointed Abd-ur-Rahman as tax farmer in China.

==Great Khatun of the Mongol Empire==

Soon after Ögedei died in 1241, at first power passed to the hands of Möge Khatun, one of Ögedei&#x27;s widows and formerly one of Genghis Khan&#x27;s wives. With the support of Chagatai and her sons, Töregene assumed complete power as regent in spring 1242 as Great Khatun and dismissed her late husband&#x27;s ministers and replaced them with her own, the most important being another woman, Fatima, a Tajik or Persian captive from the Middle Eastern campaign. She was a Shia Muslim who had been deported from the city of Meshed to Mongolia.

Töregene tried to arrest several of Ögedei&#x27;s main officials. Her husband&#x27;s chief secretary, Chinqai, and the administrator, Mahmud Yalavach, fled to her son Koden in North China while Turkestani administrator Masud Begh fled to Batu Khan in the Pontic Steppe. In Iran, Töregene ordered Korguz arrested and handed over to the widow of Chagatai, whom he had defied. The Chagatayid Khan Qara Hülëgü executed him. Töregene appointed Arghun Aqa of the Oirat as governor in Persia.

She put Abd-ur-Rahman in charge of general administration in North China, and Fatima became even more powerful at the Mongol court. These actions led the Mongol aristocrats into a frenzy of extortionate demands for revenue.

==Role in Mongol conquests==

Töregene had friendly relations with Ögedei&#x27;s commanders in China. The conflicts between the Mongols and the Song troops took place in the areas of Chengdu. Töregene sent her envoys to negotiate peace, but Song imprisoned them. The Mongols captured Hangzhou and invaded Sichuan in 1242. She ordered Zhang Rou and Chagaan (Tsagaan) to attack the Song dynasty. When they pillaged the Song territory, the Song court sent a delegation to seek a ceasefire. Chagaan and Zhang Rou returned north after the Mongols accepted the terms.

During the reign of Ögedei, the Seljuks of Rum offered friendship and a modest tribute to Chormaqan. Under Kaykhusraw II, however, the Mongols began to pressure the Sultan to go to Mongolia in person, give hostages, and accept a Mongol darughachi. Mongol raids began in 1240. The Seljuk Sultan Kaykhusraw assembled a large army to meet them. The king of Cilician Armenia was required to produce 1400 lances and the Greek Emperor of Nicaea 400 lances. Both rulers met the sultan in Kayseri to negotiate details. The Grand Komnenos of Trebizond contributed 200, while the young Ayyubid prince of Aleppo supplied 1000 horsemen. In addition to these, Kaykhusraw commanded the Seljuq army and irregular Turkmen cavalry, though both had been weakened by the Baba Ishak rebellion. However, Baiju and his Georgian auxiliaries crushed them at the battle of Köse Dağ in 1243. After that battle, the Sultanate of Rum, the Empire of Trebizond and the Lesser Armenia quickly declared their allegiance one by one to the Mongol Empire ruled by Töregene Khatun.

The Mongol troops under general Baiju probed the forces of Abbasid Iraq and Ayubid ruled Syria in 1244–46.

==Güyük&#x27;s reign==

She was an exercise of power in a society that was traditionally led only by men. She managed to balance the various competing powers within the empire, and even within the extended family of the descendants of Genghis Khan, over a 5-year period in which she not only ruled the empire, but set the stage for the ascension of her son Güyük as Great Khan. During Töregene&#x27;s reign, foreign dignitaries arrived from the distant corners of the empire to her capital at Karakorum or to her nomadic imperial camp. The Seljuk sultan came from Turkey—as did representatives of the Caliph of Abbasid in Baghdad. So did two claimants to the throne of Georgia: David Ulu, the illegitimate son of the late king—and David Narin, the legitimate son of the same king. The highest-ranking European delegate was Alexander Nevsky&#x27;s father, Grand Prince Yaroslav Vsevolodovich of Vladimir and Suzdal, who died suspiciously just after dining with Töregene Khatun.

The Mongols practiced polygamy. Ögedei Khan&#x27;s favorite son was Kochu, who was his through another wife, and he had nominated Kochu&#x27;s son Siremun to succeed him after his father suddenly died in China in 1237. But some sources mention that Khoch was a son of Töregene and she did not want little Shiremun to succeed. Töregene opposed the choice in favor of Güyük, but despite the enormous influence she had on him, was unable to persuade Ögedei to change his selection. She did, however, achieve her aims through cunning. When the lesser khans appointed her regent after her husband&#x27;s death, she appointed her favorites to high positions in the imperial household and initiated what was to be a successful scheme to elevate her son Güyük. When Temüge Otchigen, the youngest brother of Genghis, gathered his men and tried to unsuccessfully seize the throne, Güyük quickly came to meet him. Töregene managed to keep a Kurultai from being held until it was sure her son Güyük was favored by the majority. Töregene passed power to her son Güyük in 1246. She retired west to Ögedei&#x27;s appanage on the Emil.

Despite her role in ensuring Güyük&#x27;s election as Khagan, the relationship between Töregene and her son eventually collapsed. Güyük&#x27;s brother Koden accused Fatima of using witchcraft to damage his health; when Koden died a few months later, Güyük insisted that his mother hand Fatima over for execution. Töregene threatened her son Güyük that she would commit suicide to spite him. Güyük&#x27;s men seized Fatima and put her to death by sewing up all of her orifices and dumping her into water; Töregene&#x27;s supporters in the imperial household were simultaneously purged. Within 18 months of Fatima&#x27;s death, Töregene herself died under still unexplained circumstances. She was posthumously renamed Empress Zhaoci () by Kublai in 1265-1266.

<text>Burne Hogarth (born Spinoza Bernard Ginsburg, December 25, 1911 – January 28, 1996) was an American artist and educator, best known for his work on the &quot;Tarzan&quot; newspaper comic strip and his series of anatomy books for artists.

==Early life==

Hogarth was born in Chicago in 1911, the younger son of Pauline and carpenter Max. He displayed an early talent for drawing. His father saved these efforts and some years later presented them and the young Hogarth to the registrar at the Art Institute of Chicago. At age 12, Hogarth was admitted, embarking on a formal education that took him through such institutions as Chicago&#x27;s Crane College and Northwestern University, and New York City&#x27;s Columbia University in New York City – also studying arts and sciences.

Due to his father&#x27;s early death, Hogarth began work at age 15, when he became the assistant at the Associated Editors Syndicate and illustrated a series called &quot;Famous Churches of the World&quot;. He worked for several years as an editor and advertising artist. This work provided steady (and, by 1929, crucial) employment. In 1929, he drew his first comic strip, &quot;Ivy Hemmanhaw&quot;, for the Barnet Brown Company; in 1930 he drew &quot;Odd Occupations and Strange Accidents&quot; for Ledd Features Syndicate.

As the Great Depression worsened, Hogarth relocated to New York City at the urging of friends. He found employment with King Features Syndicate in 1934, drawing Charles Driscoll&#x27;s pirate adventure &quot;Pieces of Eight&quot; (1935). In 1936 came the assignment that catapulted Hogarth&#x27;s illustration career. With &quot;Tarzan&quot;, Hogarth brought together classicism, expressionism and narrative into a new form of dynamic, sequential art: the newspaper comic strip. Hogarth drew the &quot;Tarzan&quot; &quot;Sunday (newspaper comic strip) page&quot; for 12 years (1937–45; 1947–50). This work has been reprinted often, most recently by NBM Publishing.

==Art instruction==
Almost as long as he was a professional artist, Hogarth was a teacher. Over the years, he was an instructor of drawing to a variety of students at a number of institutions, and by 1944 Hogarth had in mind a school for returning World War II veterans. The Manhattan Academy of Newspaper Art was Hogarth&#x27;s first formal effort, and by 1947 he had transformed it into the Cartoonists and Illustrators School. This academy continued to grow, and in 1956 was again renamed, as the School of Visual Arts (SVA), now one of the world&#x27;s leading art schools. Hogarth designed the curriculum, served as an administrator and taught a full schedule that included drawing, writing and art history. Hogarth retired from the SVA in 1970 but continued to teach at the Parsons School of Design and, after a move to Los Angeles, the Otis School and Art Center College of Design in Pasadena.

==Books==

During his years teaching, Hogarth authored a number of anatomy and drawing books. &quot;Dynamic Anatomy&quot; (1958) and &quot;Drawing the Human Head&quot; (1965) were followed by further investigations of the human form. &quot;Dynamic Figure Drawing&quot; (1970) and &quot;Drawing Dynamic Hands&quot; (1977) completed the figure cycle. &quot;Dynamic Light and Shade&quot; (1981) and &quot;Dynamic Wrinkles and Drapery&quot; (1995) explored other aspects relative to rendering the figure.

==Graphic novels==
After more than 20 years away from strip work Hogarth returned to sequential art in 1972 with &quot;Tarzan of the Apes&quot;, a large-format hardbound graphic narrative published by Watson Guptill in 11 languages. He followed with &quot;Jungle Tales of Tarzan&quot; (1976), integrating previously unattempted techniques such as hidden, covert, and negative space imagery with inspired color themes into a harmonious visual description, a pinnacle of narrative art. These texts, in addition to Hogarth&#x27;s strip work, exert a pervasive and ongoing influence within the global arts community and among delighted readers everywhere.

His energetic speeches were known for addressing any topic that was thrown at him with a lengthy string of ideas that could cover the French Revolution and amusement parks by way of Postmodernism and graffiti art, meandering through economics and globalization, only to return to an enlightened answer to the original question. In his teaching he was known for a vigorous and surprising approach, which could include instructions such as: &quot;Paint me this sound: a spider walking on his web. What is the music of that sound?&quot;*

==Awards==
He received recognition for his work in the United States, including the National Cartoonist Society Advertising and Illustration Award for 1975, Magazine and Book Illustration Award for 1992, and Special Features Award for 1974, and dozens of awards internationally. He taught, wrote, created and theorized lucidly and passionately into his last days. For decades he was regularly invited to international events, frequently in a starring capacity.

He was inducted into the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 2010.

==Death==
During a stay in Paris, France, Hogarth suffered heart failure. He died on January 28, 1996 in the Hôpital Cochin. He had been visiting the city after attending the Angoulême International Comics Festival where he was a guest of honor.

Writings:
* &quot;Selecting the Right Art School: The Cartoonist&#x27;s and Illustrator&#x27;s Center&quot;, &quot;The Artist&#x27;s Monthly&quot;

Written by Burne Hogarth, this article details the pitfalls of traditional art school, and points out the benefits of The Cartoonist&#x27;s and Illustrator&#x27;s Center (the present-day School of Visual Arts), which he co-founded.

* &quot;A Clash of Two Cultures&quot;, &quot;American Cinematographer&quot;

This article details (among other things) the influence of Burne Hogarth&#x27;s artwork on Vittorio Storaro, ASC, AIC during the making of &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;. From the article: &quot;Storaro&#x27;s surrealistic treatment of the jungle scenes was partially inspired by the art of Burne Hogarth, whose bold use of color brought the Tarzan comic strip to vivid life during the late 1930s.&quot;

<doc id="795967" wikidata="Q5589387" url="?curid=795967" title="Government of the British Indian Ocean Territory">
<text>The [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] (abbreviated as BIOT) is an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. It is administered by a Commissioner, located at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London. There is no Governor appointed to represent the King in the territory as there are no permanent inhabitants (as is also the case in South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and the British Antarctic Territory).

==Constitution==
The laws of the territory are based on the constitution, currently set out in the British Indian Ocean Territory (Constitution) Order 2004. The Order allows for:
* the appointment of the Commissioner by the King (Article 4);
* appointments to other offices by the Commissioner (Article 7);
* no right of abode in the territory (Article 9);
* the Commissioner&#x27;s power to make laws for the territory&#x27;s peace, order and good government (Article 10);
* the disallowance of laws made by Commissioner by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Article 11);
* the Commissioner&#x27;s powers of pardon (Article 12); and
* the operation of the courts (Article 13).

If the Commissioner has not made a law on a particular topic then, in most circumstances, the laws that apply in the territory are the same as those that apply in England and Wales under the terms of the Courts Ordinance 1983. As almost all residents of the BIOT are members of the United States military, however, in practice crimes are more commonly charged under United States military law.

Legislation is formally published in the BIOT Gazette, but this is not widely distributed.

==Executive==
The territory was formally acquired by the United Kingdom under the Treaty of Paris in 1814 and subsequently formed part of the British colony of Mauritius until its detachment as a separate territory in 1965. The head of state is Charles III, King of the United Kingdom.

The Commissioner is currently Nishi Dholakia. She followed Ben Merrick, who was also Director of Overseas Territories in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Commissioner of the British Antarctic Territory; the Administrator is Bob Fairweather. The Commissioner&#x27;s Representative in the territory is the officer commanding the detachment of British forces (known locally as “BritRep”), currently Commander Roger Malone.

There is no legislature (or elections) in the territory as there are no permanent inhabitants.

==Judiciary==

BIOT has a full and independent administration of civil and criminal justice, with a Magistrates Court, Supreme Court and Court of Appeal. Further appeals can be heard by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, located in London. The following persons have served as the territory&#x27;s Chief Justice, overseeing a small legal system for the jurisdiction: Sir John Farley Spry (1981-1987); Sir John Fieldsend (1987–1998); Christopher Gardner ( 2007); Simon Bryan (since 2015); and James Lewis.

On 5 May 2023, the Supreme Court of the British Indian Ocean Territory ruled that there is a right in certain circumstances to legal aid for both civil and criminal matters on BIOT, based on a local adaption of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012.

Capital punishment is prohibited under the domestic law of the territory. While United States military law (which does provide for capital punishment) applies for most BIOT residents, the 1966 exchange of notes which initially established the governance of the territory states: &quot;A death sentence shall not be carried out in the Territory by the military authorities of the United States.&quot;

==US military presence==
Applicable treaties between the United Kingdom and the United States of America govern the use of the military base. The first exchange of notes, signed on 30 December 1966, constituted an agreement concerning the availability for defence purposes of the British Indian Ocean Territory. This was followed by agreements on the construction of a communications facility (1972), naval support facility (1976), construction contracts (1987), and monitoring facility (1999).

<doc id="795969" wikidata="Q7181569" url="?curid=795969" title="Phi Slama Jama">
<text>Phi Slama Jama was a name given to the men&#x27;s college basketball teams of the Houston Cougars from 1981 to 1984. Coined by former &quot;Houston Post&quot; sportswriter Thomas Bonk, the nickname was quickly adopted by the players and even appeared on team warmup suits by the middle of the 1982–83 season. The teams were coached by Guy Lewis and featured future Hall of Fame and NBA Top 50 players Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler. &quot;Texas&#x27; Tallest Fraternity&quot; was especially known for its slam dunking and explosive, fast-breaking style of play. The teams advanced to 3 consecutive NCAA Final Fours, 1982, 1983, and 1984. The 1983 NCAA semi-final of No. 1 Houston vs. No. 2 Louisville, &quot;The Doctors of Dunk&quot;, was recognized as one of the 100 greatest basketball moments at the end of the 20th century. The name is trademarked by the University of Houston.

== Philosophy ==

Phi Slama Jama played a frenetic, playground-influenced style of basketball that was in near diametric opposition to the fundamentally polished and methodical style espoused by basketball traditionalists like John Wooden, who disapproved of dunking. Guy Lewis not only condoned his players dunking, he &quot;insisted on it&quot;, with dunks being what he called &quot;high-percentage shots.&quot;

The young players who made up Phi Slama Jama had been influenced by the freewheeling style of play pioneered during the 1970s by the defunct ABA and its most famous player, Julius Erving. In this paradigm, athleticism took precedence over fundamental skills, fast breaks were preferred to set plays, and dunking trumped the jump shot. In an interview with Thomas Bonk, Clyde Drexler succinctly espoused the Phi Slama Jama philosophy, saying, &quot;Sure, 15-footers are fine, but I like to dunk.&quot; The Phi Slama Jama teams were notably poor at free-throw shooting, with some critics attributing their 1983 NCAA Final loss to this deficiency.

== On the court ==
The Phi Slama Jama Cougars advanced to the NCAA Final Four each year from 1982 to 1984. As underclassmen in 1981–82, a young Cougar team lost to the eventual champion North Carolina Tar Heels in the national semifinals.

The 1982–83 season marked the high point of Phi Slama Jama. The Cougars posted an Associated Press #1 ranking, a 31–2 record and a 26-game winning streak before losing in the national championship game of the 1983 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament. Considered one of the most unlikely upsets in NCAA tournament history, Phi Slama Jama lost a close game against the North Carolina State Wolfpack 54–52, with the final margin decided on a last-second dunk by Wolfpack forward Lorenzo Charles. The NC State surprise national championship win remains a legendary representation of March Madness. Following the season, the Houston Cougars team met with President Ronald Reagan. The president was inducted as an honorary member of the Phi Slama Jama fraternity during a visit to Houston on April 30, 1983.

Despite the early departure of Drexler after the 1982–83 season, Phi Slama Jama continued its success in 1984. Hakeem Olajuwon became the focal point of the team and was selected as a consensus first team All-American. Shooting guard Michael Young was also selected to the All-America team and led the Cougars in scoring for the second consecutive year. The Cougars returned to the Final Four once more, this time losing to the Patrick Ewing-led Georgetown Hoyas in the final. Olajuwon, with one year of eligibility remaining, declared for the NBA draft shortly after the loss in the title game. He was selected first overall by the Houston Rockets in a draft class that included Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, and John Stockton. Michael Young was also selected in the first round, chosen 24th by the Boston Celtics. The departures of Olajuwon and Young after the 1984 NCAA Final, in addition to the loss of Drexler and Larry Micheaux the previous year, brought the Phi Slama Jama era at Houston to a close.

== Notable team members ==
The team members during the Phi Slama Jama era are listed below, along with the nicknames for which some came to be known.
The team included:

*Rob Williams (1979–82)
*Larry &quot;Mr. Mean&quot; Micheaux (1979–83)
*Lynden Rose (1980–82)
*Clyde &quot;The Glide&quot; Drexler (1980–83)
*Dave Rose (1980–83)
*Michael &quot;The Silent Assassin&quot; Young (1980–84)
*Bryan Williams (1981–83)
*Hakeem &quot;The Dream&quot; Olajuwon (1981–84)
*Benny &quot;The Bomber from Bernice&quot; Anders (1981–84)
*Reid Gettys (1981–85)
*Gary Orsak (1981–85)
*Alvin Franklin (1982–86)
*Renaldo Thomas (1982–86)
*Gregory Wayne &quot;Cadillac&quot; Anderson (1983–87)
*Rickie Winslow (1983–87)

== Impact on the game ==
Dunking was banned in the NCAA 1967 to 1976. Many people have attributed this to the dominance of the then-college phenomenon Lew Alcindor (now known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar); the no-dunking rule is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Lew Alcindor rule.&quot; Many others have also attributed the ban as having racial motivations, as at the time most of the prominent dunkers in college basketball were African-American, and the ban took place less than a year after a Texas Western team with an all-black starting lineup beat an all-white Kentucky team to win the national championship. Under head coach Guy Lewis, Houston (with Elvin Hayes) made considerable use of the on their way to the Final Four An invention by Arthur Ehrat to create the breakaway rim with a spring on it led to the return of the dunk in college basketball.

Though it was pioneered largely in the ABA, Phi Slama Jama is widely credited with popularizing the athletic &quot;above the rim&quot; style of play that pervades college basketball to the present day. Phi Slama Jama achieved its greatest prominence at a time when the overall popularity of basketball was burgeoning. Their entertaining style of play appealed to a broad audience, and helped to bring many casual fans to the sport. Olajuwon&#x27;s international origin foreshadowed the worldwide explosion in the popularity of basketball in the 1980s and 1990s. In light of his unprecedented success, college basketball recruiters fanned out across the globe in search of the next undiscovered superstar. The legacy of Phi Slama Jama has remained at the fore of basketball discourse thanks in large part to the long and distinguished professional careers of Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler.

Having already helped to popularize college basketball with &quot;The Game of the Century&quot; in 1968, the Cougars&#x27; captivating 1983 postseason run again helped college basketball in its drive to join the first rank of major sports. The #1 vs. #2 clash of titans between Phi Slama Jama and Louisville&#x27;s &quot;Doctors of Dunk&quot; in the Final Four served as an enthralling preamble to the dramatic title game. Phi Slama Jama&#x27;s title game loss to North Carolina State is widely considered their most immediate contribution towards putting NCAA basketball on a par with college football in terms of television viewership and revenue. The Cougars&#x27; last-second loss in the final was an iconic moment in the history of &quot;March Madness&quot; that helped to establish the NCAA basketball tournament as a major television event. The CBS broadcast of the 1983 final between Houston and NC State drew 18.6 million households and the Houston-Louisville national semifinal attracted 14.8 million, both records at the time for national final and semifinal games.

== &quot;30 for 30&quot; ==
The Phi Slama Jama era at Houston was a focal point for an ESPN &quot;30 for 30&quot; documentary of the same name. Directed by Chip Rives, the film premiered on October 18, 2016, and featured several former members of the Houston basketball team from the Phi Slama Jama era. Included in the film were Clyde Drexler and Hakeem Olajuwon, who would go on to Hall of Fame careers in the NBA and win a championship together on the Houston Rockets in ; role players David Rose, Reid Gettys, Cadillac Anderson, and original Phi Slama Jama team captains Lynden Rose and Eric Davis. Media members who participated included original Phi Slama Jama coiner Thomas Bonk, Curry Kirkpatrick, and Brent Musburger. While exploring that larger narrative, Rives also focuses on the disappearance of enigmatic role player Benny Anders and the lasting brotherhood that compels teammates and 1981–82 co-captains Eric Davis and Lynden Rose to try and find him after more than two decades of mystery. UH alum Jim Nantz also appears in the film as he was a member of the student body at the time.

<text>Maximilian Lenz (born 4 March 1965), known by his stage name WestBam, is a German DJ and musician. He is the co-founder of the record label Low Spirit.

==Career==
Lenz started his musical career in 1978 in the punk scene of his birth town Münster under the moniker Frank Xerox. He then played bass, drums and synthesizer. Together with Andreas Bleckmann (alias Sally), he founded the band Anormal Null in 1979. Afterwards he founded Kriegsschauplatz, who were active until 1983.

The origin of his DJ moniker Westbam is a homage to Afrika Bambaataa, thus &quot;Westphalia Bambaataa&quot;. He started his career as a DJ in 1983 in the Odeon club in Münster. In 1984, he moved to his friend and mentor William Röttger in Berlin, where he released his first record called &quot;17 – This Is Not a Boris Becker Song&quot;, which was co-produced by Klaus Jankuhn. WestBam, his brother Fabian Lenz, William Röttger, Klaus Jankuhn and Sandra Molzahn later founded their own label Low Spirit.

In 1985 Westbam published his influential text &quot;What is Record-Art?&quot;, in which he described DJ techniques and characterized the DJ as a musician, that composes tracks with records. In 1988, the Goethe-Institut sent Westbam as part of the German art show Kunstdisco to the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.

He played at the first Love Parade rave party in 1989 at Kurfürstendamm, Berlin, and also wrote the Love Parade Anthems from 1997–2008. He was the only DJ, who played at all Love Parades from 1989 to 2008 and planned to perform for a last time at the Loveparade 2010, but cancelled his performance in response to the Love Parade disaster. He later heavily criticized the decision to continue the event despite the death of 21 visitors.

In 1991, he organised the first Mayday rave in Berlin. With over 5000 people, it was the biggest techno party in Germany at the time. Since then, Mayday has been vital to the German techno scene. Westbam was involved in the planning of the events, and also produced the annual Mayday anthems together with Klaus Jankuhn, in the project Members of Mayday until 2013. In February 2014, Westbam announced that he will not perform any longer at Mayday and the Members of Mayday project will disband.

After several single records he released his first album named &quot;The Cabinet&quot;. In 1993, he played a number of rave events in the United Kingdom including Obsession Passion at the Sanctuary in Milton Keynes. In 1997, he released his first book, titled &quot;Mixes, Cuts &amp; Scratches&quot;. It dealt with the art, the work and the life of a DJ.

In 2005, he released an album &quot;Do You Believe in the Westworld&quot;, with the first single being &quot;Bang The Loop&quot;. Westbam presented this album live with a band, which consisted of a drummer, a bass player, Klaus Jankuhn on keyboards and a laptop for programming and Westbam performing as MC.

Westbam released his triple album &quot;A Love Story 89-10&quot; in 2010 on Bass Planet / Kontor Records.

2013 saw the release of his double album &quot;Götterstraße&quot;, on which Westbam collaborated with artists such as Richard Butler, Lil Wayne, Rockell, Iggy Pop, Bernard Sumner, Inga Humpe, Brian Molko, Kanye West, Afrika Baby Bam and Hugh Cornwell.

==Personal life ==
Westbam has three siblings. His brother is Fabian Lenz, also known as DJ Dick. His sister Seraphina Lenz is an artist.

He is father of two sons and lives in Berlin-Prenzlauer Berg.

==In popular culture==
Scooter mentions WestBam in their 1994 song Hyper Hyper, during which lead singer H.P. Baxxter reads out the name of numerous DJs.

<doc id="795976" wikidata="Q1533433" url="?curid=795976" title="Goanna (band)">
<text>Goanna is an Australian rock band which formed in 1977 in Geelong as The Goanna Band with mainstay Shane Howard as singer-songwriter and guitarist. The group integrated social protest with popular music and reached the Top 20 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart with &quot;Solid Rock&quot; (1982) and &quot;Let the Franklin Flow&quot; (released under the name Gordon Franklin &amp; the Wilderness Ensemble in 1983). Their debut album, &quot;Spirit of Place&quot;, peaked at No. 2 on the related albums chart. They disbanded in 1987 and briefly reformed in 1998.

==History==
=== 1977–1987 ===

Goanna was formed as an Australian folk-rock group by singer-songwriter and guitarist Shane Howard in Geelong in 1977. Alongside Howard, the original line-up was Mike Biscan (guitar), Richard Griffiths (bass guitar) and Rod Hoe (drums). During their early years the line-up changed numerous times, with only Howard as the mainstay. In 1979, the group consisted of Howard, keyboardist and vocalist Rose Bygrave, lead guitarist and vocalist Warwick Harwood, bass guitarist Carl Smith, drummer Gary Crothall and vocalist and harmonica player Ian Morrison. They recorded an independent 12&quot; EP, &quot;The Goanna Band&quot;. The four-track EP was produced by Broderick Smith (ex-The Dingoes) and released on EMI Music. By 1981 the band were now Shane Howard, Rose Bygrave, Warrick Harwood, Peter Coughlan on bass guitar, Marcia Howard (vocalist and synthesisers), Graham Davidge (electric guitar) and Robbie Ross on drums. They had shortened the name to Goanna, and with their increasing popularity they attracted the interest of major record companies.

They supported James Taylor on the Australian leg of his 1981 tour. In February 1982, they signed to WEA Australia, and Shane Howard established a music publishing company, Uluru Music, headed by Helene Jedwab. The band released its single &quot;Solid Rock&quot; in September.

According to Howard, the inspiration came on a ten-day camping trip to Uluru during 1980, where he had a &quot;spiritual awakening&quot; which brought &quot;the fire in the belly&quot; to the surface over injustices to Australia&#x27;s Indigenous peoples.

WEA were at first reluctant to issue it as a single, and even Howard initially had a few doubts about whether commercial radio was ready for such a weighty political subject; however, Howard insisted on its release to make a statement on the British invasion of Australia. &quot;Solid Rock&quot; peaked at No. #2 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart, remaining in the Top 50 for 26 weeks. It also reached No. #31 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Chart and appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In November 2013, &quot;Solid Rock&quot; was voted No. 20 in the Triple M Melbourne/Herald Sun Australian Top-40 chart of the last 40 years. Goanna released their debut album, &quot;Spirit of Place&quot;, in December. It was produced by Trevor Lucas, a member of UK folk-rock group Fairport Convention, who had returned to Australia in 1979. &quot;Spirit of Place&quot; reached No. 2 on the Kent Music Report Albums Chart, within two weeks of its release and remained there for 10 weeks, alternating with Midnight Oil&#x27;s &quot;10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1&quot; for the No. 1 &amp; No. 2 spot. It also reached No. 179 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. For the album, Goanna were Rose Bygrave on keyboards, Peter Coughlan on bass guitar, Graham Davidge (ex-Little River Band) on guitar, Warrick Harwood, Shane Howard, his sister Marcia Howard on backing vocals, Mick O&#x27;Connor on keyboards and Robbie Ross on drums. An ever-changing line-up saw Harwood reluctantly leave the band. The follow-up single &quot;Razors Edge&quot; released in March 1983 reached No. 36 on the national charts.

On 13 February 1983, Gordon Franklin &amp; the Wilderness Ensemble performed &quot;Let the Franklin Flow&quot; at the Stop The Drop nuclear disarmament concert at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl. The ensemble included members of Goanna and fellow folk rock group Redgum and Lucas. In April, &quot;Let the Franklin Flow&quot; was issued as a single with Lucas and Jeff Campbell as producer. Howard, the song&#x27;s writer, was credited as F. River. The single reached No. 12 nationally. Proceeds supported the Tasmanian Wilderness Society&#x27;s campaign against the proposed damming of Tasmania&#x27;s Gordon and Franklin rivers for a hydroelectricity project. Howard physically supported the protests by joining the picket lines. The B-side of the single, &quot;Franklin River – World Heritage&quot;, was written and recorded by the society&#x27;s director, Bob Brown, who later became a senator and the leader of Australian Greens.

On 19 April 1983, Goanna won three &quot;Countdown&quot; Music and Video Awards for their work in 1982: &quot;Spirit of Place&quot; won Best Debut Album, &quot;Solid Rock&quot; won Best Debut Single and the band itself won the Best New Talent (Johnny O&#x27;Keefe Memorial Award). &quot;Solid Rock&quot; is the first charting rock record to feature extensive use of the didgeridoo, one of the world&#x27;s oldest wood instruments, played by Billy Inda (No Fixed Address) and Bobby Djabanunga.

By late 1983, Goanna included new guitarists Ross Hannaford (Daddy Cool, Mighty Kong) and Russell Smith (Company Caine, Mighty Kong) with Robert Ross replaced by Geoff Bridgford (Bee Gees),(Jim Keays Band) on drums. In October they released a third single, &quot;That Day (Is Coming Sooner)&quot;, which peaked at No. 67. Surprisingly WEA dropped the band from the label. Howard then travelled around the world looking for other record companies to pick them up. During this time he visited Ireland, the home of his ancestors and experienced another cultural awakening. The band were just on the verge of signing a worldwide deal with CBS, when Warners in Australia contacted them and re-signed the band, who then spent much of 1984 recording a new album at John French&#x27;s Fast Forward studio in Melbourne, the Music Farm Studio in Byron Bay, and also in Los Angeles at George Massenburg&#x27;s The Complex studio, with Little Feat&#x27;s keyboard player Billy Payne. The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Oceania&quot;, produced by Billy Payne, was released in April 1985 and reached No. 29. The first single from this album, &quot;Common Ground&quot;, had been released in December 1984 and peaked at No. 42. The second single, &quot;Dangerous Dancing&quot;, released in May 1985 only reached No. 91. Throughout 1985, the band toured relentlessly in support of the album, with a constantly revolving line-up of members, including at one stage ex-Little River Band drummer Derek Pellicci. The band then released a non-album single, &quot;Song for Africa&quot;, dedicated to famine relief, in September but it failed to chart. WEA dropped Goanna from their roster again.

On 13 July 1985, Goanna performed three songs for the Oz for Africa concert (part of the global Live Aid program) – &quot;Common Ground&quot;, &quot;Song for Africa&quot;, &quot;Solid Rock&quot;. It was broadcast in Australia (on both Seven Network and Nine Network) and on MTV in the US. In September, still promoting &quot;Oceania&quot; and the newly released &quot;Song for Africa&quot;, Howard went &quot;walkabout&quot;, and the band was forced to cancel $20,000 worth of bookings. Eventually a disillusioned Howard had travelled to South Australia to perform with Aboriginal musician and didgeridoo player Bart Willoughby (No Fixed Address). With Howard no longer involved, Goanna effectively disbanded but reformed, self-managed, for one final farewell tour of Victoria, NSW, and Tasmania with aboriginal band Coloured Stone in October 1986. The final gig of the tour was on 25 October 1986 for the Baha&#x27;i Concert For Peace at the Geelong Performing Arts Centre. The live version of &quot;Solid Rock&quot; featured on the re-mastered release of &quot;Spirit of place&quot; comes from this performance. 

The final line-up consisted of Shane &amp; Marcia Howard, Rose Bygrave; Dave Stewart drums; Jo Imbrol bass; Simon Curphey and Selwyn Burns guitars; Bunna Lawrie, Bart Willoughby, Tony Lovett and Nicky Moffatt on Didgeridoo &amp; percussion: Bill Dart F.O.H sound and recording engineer for db Concert Sound. On 24 &amp; 25 January 1987 yet another final fling occurred when much the same ensemble played at the Tamworth Country Music Festival sponsored by Yamaha Music Australia.

=== 1988–present: After Goanna ===

Shane Howard returned to a solo career, releasing &quot;Back to the Track&quot; (1988), &quot;River&quot; (1990), &quot;Time Will Tell&quot; (1993), &quot;Live in Ireland&quot; (1994), &quot;Clan&quot; (1996), &quot;Beyond Hope&#x27;s Bridge&quot; (2000), &quot;Another Country&quot; (2004), &quot;Retrospect&quot; (2004), &quot;Songs of Love &amp; Resistance&quot; (2006), &quot;Tarerer&quot; (compilation, 2006), &quot;Two Songmen&quot; with Neil Murray (2007), &quot;Goanna Dreaming&quot; (2010), &quot;Driftwood&quot; (2010), &quot;Other Side of the Rock&quot; (2012) and &quot;Deeper South&quot; (2015). Howard also appears on numerable compilation recordings. He wrote and recorded the song &quot;Palya Wiru Uluru&quot; with senior Anangu songwriter Trevor Adamson. They at performed live at the Close of the Climb at Uluru, 26 October 2019.

In 2000, Howard formed his own recording label, Goanna Arts. He was a founding member and musical director for the Black Arm Band productions &quot;Murundak&quot; (2006) &quot;Hidden Republic&quot; (2008) and repertoire consultant for &quot;Dirt Songs&quot; (2009), as well as a performing artist with the ensemble. He was creative director and producer for the stage concerts, CD and DVD of &quot;Exile: Songs &amp; Stories of Irish Australia&quot; (2016).

Howard also produced albums for the Wirrinyga Band (&quot;Dreamtime Wisdom, Modertime Vision&quot;, 1995, the Pigram Brothers (&quot;Saltwater Country&quot;, 1995, Jimmy Chi (&quot;Corrugation Road&quot;, 1996), Andy Alberts (&quot;Gunditjmara Land&quot;, 1996 and &quot;Close To Home&quot;, 2001) with Pete Bird, Joe Geia (&quot;Old Friends&quot;, 2000), Tonchi McIntosh (&quot;Bridges&quot;, 2001, Mossie Scanlon (&quot;Tanam Ort&quot;, 2001), Patricia Clarke (&quot;Keep The Fires Burning&quot;, 2001), Oriel Glennon (&quot;Two Pink Turtles&quot;, 2000), Dead Reckoning&quot; (2016) with Pete Bird (2015) and Archie Roach (&quot;Journey&quot;, 2006) with Nash Chambers.

In 1986, Rose Bygrave toured briefly playing reggae with Australian singer Wendy Saddington. Bygrave, issued a solo single, &quot;Maybe Midnight&quot;, in June 1989 and started working on a solo album which was not released at the time. Bygrave&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;White Bird&quot;, finally appeared in 1999 and was followed by &quot;Walking Home&quot; (2001), &quot;North&quot; (2009) and &quot;The Yabby Catcher&quot; (2019).

Marcia Howard released the solo albums &quot;Butterfly&quot; (2000), &quot;Burning in the Rain&quot; (2004), &quot;Nashville Sessions&quot; EP (2015) and &quot;Everything Reminds Me&quot; (2017). Her song, a musical rendering of the William Blake poem &quot;Poison Tree&quot; (recorded with Mary Black), was released on the compilation CD &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Heart-a Decade on&quot; (2003). In 2016, she appeared on &quot;The Voice&quot;. She was named Artist of the Year at the Port Fairy Folk Festival (2017).

Marcia Howard and Rose Bygrave released an album, &quot;Pearl&quot; (2011).

In October 1998, Shane Howard, Marcia Howard, and Bygrave re-formed Goanna and recorded a third album, &quot;Spirit Returns&quot;, released in November. Joining the line-up was Kerryn Tolhurst (the Dingoes), with other guest musicians on the album including Steve Cooney, Liam O&#x27;Maonlai, Bill Jacobi (bass guitar) and Greg Sheehan (drums). The tracks ranged from the bluesy &quot;What Else is a Life&quot; (which was released as the first single), the country-inflected &quot;This Old Town&quot;, to the politicised &quot;Song for East Timor&quot;, as well as a cover of the Tolhurst-penned Dingoes&#x27; track &quot;Your Song&quot;. Marcia Howard&#x27;s &quot;Sorry&quot; was influenced by the documentary &quot;Lousy Little Sixpence&quot;, based on Margaret Tuckers&#x27; story, &quot;If Everyone Cared&quot;, which chronicled her story of the &quot;stolen generation&quot; of Indigenous people. Shane Howard recorded in Ireland with Stephen Cooney and Liam O&#x27;Maonlai (Hot House Flowers), while Tolhurst added the final touches in New York. Goanna performed the song at the first National Sorry Day at Parliament House in Canberra in 1998, the same morning the &quot;Bringing Them Home&quot; report was released. &quot;Sorry&quot; was released by Goanna both on CD and as a resource book and video as a Sorry Day resource by Fraynework Media.

In August and September 2006, Shane Howard performed &quot;Solid Rock&quot; as part of the Countdown Spectacular tour and was joined at the Melbourne concerts by his sister, Marcia, and Bygrave. In October, a number of Goanna&#x27;s tracks featured in the Triple M Essential 2006 Countdown of songs (which was voted and chosen by the listeners) including:
* &quot;Solid Rock&quot; (ranked 427 out of 2006 songs)
* &quot;Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot; (ranked 1232 out of 2006 songs)

Two of the Goanna Band&#x27;s guitarists, Mike Biscan and Warrick Harwood, died in April 2020.

Starting in June 2022, the band returned to tour around Australia to celebrate the 40th anniversary of &quot;Spirit of Place&quot;, with band members Shane Howard, Rose Bygrave, Marcia Howard and Graham Davidge playing, amongst others.

In September 2022, Goanna performed &quot;Solid Rock&quot; at the 2022 AFL Grand Final. In December 2022, Goanna re-released the song with Emma Donovan and William Barton.

In June 2023, Goanna released &quot;Takayna&quot;, their first new music in 25 years. Shane Howard described the song as &quot;A hymn to the natural world, to takayna/Tarkine and the palawa peoples long custodianship of that country&quot;

<doc id="795977" wikidata="Q4866460" url="?curid=795977" title="1948 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting">
<text>Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 1948 followed the same procedures as 1947.
The Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from players retired less than 25 years, with provision for a runoff in case of no winner. It elected two people on the first ballot, Herb Pennock and Pie Traynor. Meanwhile, the Old Timers Committee, with jurisdiction over earlier players, met on no schedule and not this year. Criticism continued that earlier players, as well as managers and other non-playing candidates, were being overlooked.

While an induction ceremony had initially been planned for 1948, it was postponed, although the annual Hall of Fame Game was still played on July 12, 1948. Pennock and Traynor were subsequently inducted with the 1949 Hall of Fame selections in Cooperstown, New York, on June 13, 1949. Traynor attended the ceremony; Pennock had died in January 1948, several weeks before the baseball writers elected him.

==BBWAA election==
The 10-year members of the BBWAA had the authority to select any players active in 1923 or later, provided they had been retired since 1946. Voters were instructed to cast votes for 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. If no candidate received votes on 75% of the ballots, the top 20 candidates would advance to a runoff election, with the vote totals from the first ballot not being revealed until the runoff was over.

A total of 121 ballots were cast - the lowest total for any BBWAA election - with 1,036 individual votes for 106 specific candidates, an average of 8.56 per ballot; 91 votes were required for election. The results were announced on February 27, 1948. The election was a success for the second year in a row following the most recent format change, with two more inductees to the Hall being selected; again, no runoff was necessary. Herb Pennock, who received the most votes and was elected, had died suddenly of a cerebral hemorrhage just weeks earlier on January 30; however, he had done increasingly well in previous elections, and many ballots had already been cast, making it unlikely that his election was primarily due to sentiment.

The number of players receiving votes (106) was a significant increase over the previous year&#x27;s total of 39, and the highest number since the 1939 election. After the 1947 election in which voters had just a few weeks to select candidates following the disqualification of players retired over 25 years, voters in 1948 had a full year in which to look for candidates who had retired between 1923 and 1946, and a wide variety of new candidates drew votes. 80 of those named received votes on less than 5% of the ballots, with 36 receiving only a single vote; 45 players were named for the first time, although all had been eligible at some point in the past - for some, the 1936 election in which active players were eligible. All but 3 of the eligible candidates who received &quot;any&quot; votes in the 1947 election were again named in the voting.

As had been the case in 1947, the focus was now on the most recent players; those who retired in the 1920s generally saw their vote totals decrease from the previous year, while more recent players advanced even further in the voting. Due to the scarcity of precise historical records, some voters may have refrained from voting for players of the 1920s due to uncertainty as to their eligibility. Only 5 of the top 30 candidates, and none of the top 14, had retired before 1931. Of the 106 players named, 29 retired before 1930; they received only 12% of the vote. These totals include eight ineligible players who retired before 1923 - including Johnny Kling, retired since 1913 - who nevertheless received 2 votes; this may have been due to uncertainty as to their retirement date, or perhaps as a voter response to the lack of any selections by the Old-Timers Committee the previous year. Votes for notable managers such as Miller Huggins increased, perhaps also in response to the lack of 1947 honors in that area.

Chief Bender, who last played regularly in 1917, received 5 votes; he was technically eligible due to a single inning pitched in 1925, but the drop from his 1947 total of 72 votes suggests either that most voters were unaware of that fact or that they viewed it as irrelevant regarding the spirit of the rules. Dizzy Dean, who finished 8th in the 1947 balloting with 88 votes, had come out of retirement to start one game in 1947; nevertheless, 40 votes were cast for him by those who felt that this single appearance should not affect his retired status and eligibility. Four other players who made their last major league appearances in 1947, including Red Ruffing and Stan Hack, got a handful of votes; Joe Medwick, still active, received one vote.

The induction ceremony in Cooperstown was not held until the following year, on July 12, 1949, with inductee Pie Traynor present.

The two candidates who received at least 75% of the vote and were elected are indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been selected in subsequent elections are indicated in &quot;italics&quot;:

&quot;A likable rascal with much courage and a pretty wit,&quot; according to the &quot;Western Mail&quot;, &quot;his escapades make enthralling reading.&quot; Although another critic found the adventures &quot;naive&quot;, &quot;The Observer&quot; embraced the fantastical plot as deeply enjoyable. The novel was compared favorably to the previous novel in the series and was well received by critics, noting its evocative period setting and its more episodic structure. &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; called the escape from Dover Castle &quot;ingenious&quot;.

==Publication==
Originally published by Rich &amp; Cowan, it has been reprinted many times in both hardcover and paperback editions, including by Arrow Books (1959), Jarrolds (1966) and other recent small presses.

==Adaptation==
The novel inspired the William Buchanan novel &quot;Christopher Syn&quot;, upon which the Disney film &quot;The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh&quot; is based, hence the similarities between the plots.

In 2007, an abridged version of the novel was broadcast on BBC Radio 4. Comprising half of a ten-part series titled &quot;The Further Adventures of Doctor Syn&quot;, it was read by Rufus Sewell.

<text>Hawthorne Army Depot (HWAD) is a U.S. Army Joint Munitions Command ammunition storage depot located near the town of Hawthorne in western Nevada in the United States. It is directly south of Walker Lake. The depot covers or and has storage space in 2,427 bunkers. HWAD is the &quot;World&#x27;s Largest Depot&quot;. It is divided into three ammunition storage and production areas, plus an industrial area housing command headquarters, facilities, engineering shops, etc.

The depot was established as Naval Ammunition Depot Hawthorne in September 1930. It was redesignated as the Hawthorne Army Ammunition Plant in 1977 when it was transferred from United States Navy to United States Army control as part of the United States Department of Defense&#x27;s Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition. In 1994, it ended the production of ammunition and became Hawthorne Army Depot.

==Description==
Hawthorne Army Depot stores reserve ammunitions to be used after the first 30 days of a major conflict. It is only partially staffed during peacetime, but provision has been made to rapidly expand staffing as necessary. An independent contractor runs the depot under an agreement with the United States Government.

The center&#x27;s capabilities include demilitarization, desert training for military units, ammunition renovation, quality assurance, ISO intermodal container maintenance and repair, and range scrap processing.

==History==
A major disaster occurred at the United States Navy&#x27;s Lake Denmark Naval Ammunition Depot in New Jersey in 1926. The accident virtually destroyed the depot, causing heavy damage to the adjacent Picatinny Arsenal and the surrounding communities, killing 21 people and seriously injuring 53 others. The monetary loss to the Navy alone was US$84 million, the equivalent of just over US$1 billion in 2007, mostly in due to the loss of explosives consumed in the disaster. As a result of a full-scale United States Congressional investigation, the 70th United States Congress in 1928 directed that a Board of Officers be established to provide oversight of the storage conditions of explosives. A court of inquiry investigating the explosion recommended that a depot be established in a remote area within of the United States West Coast to serve the Pacific area.

In accordance with the court of inquiry&#x27;s recommendation, construction of the Hawthorne Naval Ammunition Depot (NAD) began in July 1928 in a area of Nevada under U.S. Navy jurisdiction. The Hawthorne NAD opened in September 1930 and received its first shipment of high explosives on 19 October 1930. When the United States entered World War II in December 1941, the depot became the staging area for bombs, rockets, and ammunition for almost the entire war effort. Employment was at its highest at 5,625 in 1945. By 1948, the Hawhorne NAD occupied about of the area. Subsequently, excess U.S. Navy lands were turned over to the United States Department of the Interior&#x27;s Bureau of Land Management.

The mission and functions at the Hawthorne NAD remained the same throughout the facility&#x27;s history. The mission, as stated in a 1962 Navy Command History, was to &quot;receive, renovate, maintain, store and issue ammunition, explosives, expendable ordnance items and/or weapons and technical ordnance material and perform additional tasks as directed by the Bureau of Naval Weapons.&quot; It also served as an important ammunition center during the Korean War (June 1950–July 1953) and the Vietnam War (1964–1973), with several thousand structures on of land. Stored ammunition that had been examined and repacked was given the code &quot;HAW&quot; followed by the last two digits of the year (e.g., &quot;HAW 50&quot; in 1950).

The United States Marine Corps provided security for the 3,000 bunkers at Hawthorne NAD. In September 1930 and during World War II (December 1941–August 1945) 600 Marines were assigned to the facility. By 1977, that number had dropped to 117.

In 1977, NAD was transferred to the United States Army and renamed the Hawthorne Army Ammunition Plant (HWAAP). In 1980, the HWAAP was redesignated as a United States Government-owned contractor-operated facility. Day &amp; Zimmermann Hawthorne Corporation (DZHC) is the current operating contractor, having won the contract over three other bidders, namely Aerojet Services, Mason &amp; Knight, and the British-owned ICI America, by proposing the lowest price for the plant&#x27;s operation.;the award was announced on 5 August 1980). In 1994, the facility was renamed the Hawthorne Army Depot (HWAD). Security is contracted to a private company.

In 1998–1999, the facility was used to destroy the U.S. stockpile of M687 chemical artillery shells and separate their of binary precursor chemicals from them.

In May 2005, the facility was included on the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) list, with closure being recommended. However, the depot was subsequently dropped from the BRAC list, primarily due to the base&#x27;s capability to support pre-deployment training for Operation Enduring Freedom-bound U.S. Marine Corps units (by the Mountain Warfare Training Center) as well as Navy and Army special operations forces.

On 18 March 2013, seven U.S. Marines were killed and at least eight were wounded when a mortar exploded during a live-fire training exercise at the Hawthorne Army Depot. Because of the accident, the Pentagon suspended use of the M224 mortar round pending an investigation. As a result of the investigation, the explosion was deemed to have been as a result of human error and the suspension was lifted.

Currently, United States Marine Corps Reserve personnel from the 4th Marine Logistics Group conduct annual training exercises at the Hawthorne Army Depot as well as in its surrounding desert areas.

== Local community ==
Hawthorne Army Depot surrounds the small town of Hawthorne, Nevada, where most of its employees reside. Before the facility became contractor-operated, it was staffed primarily by United States federal civil service workers and military personnel who were housed on government-owned property neighboring Hawthorne, including the now-abandoned town of Babbitt and military housing known as Schweer Drive. During the peak of operations in World War II, additional housing was provided in a former Civilian Conservation Corps camp christened &quot;Camp Jumbo,&quot; and in a large adjoining construction camp. The local Sixth Street School (whose building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places) was expanded to serve the growing population.

The housing in Babbitt was made up of large buildings designed as duplexes. The system of trusses in the buildings allowed all interior walls to be removed without compromising their structure. Since the disposal of Babbitt many of these &quot;Babbitt Houses&quot; have been moved to rural areas in many parts of Nevada for use in various ways.

<text>Richard Dorian Goodman (April 19, 1934 – November 6, 1989), was an American music and record producer. He is best known for inventing and using the technique of the &quot;break-in&quot;, an early precursor to sampling, that used brief clips of popular records and songs to &quot;answer&quot; comedic questions posed by voice actors on his novelty records. He also wrote and produced some original material, most often heard on the B-sides of his break-in records.

==Career==
Goodman&#x27;s first known release came in 1952, when he was just 18 years old. Under the name &quot;Dick Good&quot;, Chess Records released his version of Johnny Standley&#x27;s comic monologue &quot;It&#x27;s in the Book&quot;. In June 1956, in partnership with Bill Buchanan, he made his first hit record, &quot;The Flying Saucer Parts 1 &amp; 2&quot;, a take-off of Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;. This recording was the subject of a copyright infringement case against Goodman. The court ruled that his sampled mix was a parody and thus an entirely new work. The single peaked at No. 3 on &quot;Billboard&quot; and was Goodman&#x27;s highest-charting single. Two months later, it was re-released as &quot;Back To Earth&quot;. 

Buchanan and Goodman followed up with other records. &quot;Buchanan and Goodman on Trial&quot;, originally entitled &quot;Public Opinion&quot;, reached #80 in 1956. &quot;Banana Boat Story&quot; featured the duo using a song, the Tarriers&#x27; &quot;Banana Boat Song&quot;, as a break-in spoof of broadcast commercials. &quot;Flying Saucer the 2nd&quot; reached #18 in 1957, &quot;Santa and the Satellite (Parts I &amp; II)&quot; reached #32 in 1957, and &quot;Frankenstein Of `59&quot; / &quot;Frankenstein Returns&quot; was released in February 1959. The two men ended their partnership in 1959.

There were some lawsuits filed against Buchanan and Goodman for the use of unlicensed materials. They had operated their business from a telephone booth at a pharmacy. Although they got richer, the court cases ate up the profits.

In 1959, collaborating with Mickey Shorr under the names Spencer and Spencer, Goodman recorded two singles which relied much less on sampling and more on sketch comedy. &quot;Russian Bandstand&quot; was a re-imagining of the TV series &quot;American Bandstand&quot; set in the Soviet Union. &quot;Stagger Lawrence&quot; imposed Lloyd Price&#x27;s recording of &quot;Stagger Lee&quot; onto a spoof of &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot;, borrowing heavily from an earlier Welk parody done by Stan Freberg. Neither recording was as popular as the recordings Goodman made with Buchanan.

Starting in 1961 as a solo artist, Goodman scored three &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hits based on the hit TV series &quot;The Untouchables&quot;: &quot;The Touchables&quot; (#60), &quot;The Touchables in Brooklyn&quot; (#42), and &quot;Santa and the Touchables&quot; (#99). He also performed several of his own Halloween-themed songs with Rori; eventually these were released as an album, the most successful track being &quot;Horror Movies&quot;, about favorite pop culture movie monsters. The song has recently been revived as background music in several films and venues, including Adam Sandler&#x27;s &quot;Hubie Halloween&quot; on Netflix, Amazon Prime series &quot;The Lake&quot;, Disney/HULU series &quot;Extraordinary&quot; and Universal Orlando&#x27;s Halloween Nights.

In 1962, Goodman spoofed &quot;Ben Casey&quot; with &quot;Ben Crazy&quot; (#44 on &quot;Billboard&quot;). In 1966, his spoof of &quot;Batman&quot; resulted in &quot;Batman &amp; His Grandmother&quot; (#70). He also released a full album, &quot;The Many Heads Of Dickie Goodman&quot;, which included most of his break-ins to date.

In 1963 while working at 20th Century Fox Records, Goodman recorded (&quot;John F Kennedy The Presidential Years&quot;), a tribute composed of Kennedy&#x27;s famous speeches. It was named number eight of &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Albums of the Year.&quot; and has been archived by The Henry Ford Museum.

In 1964, Goodman switched from break-in records to parodies and recorded an album called &quot;My Son the Joke&quot;. The title was a take-off of Allan Sherman popular comedy records. Goodman&#x27;s material was more risque than Sherman&#x27;s, with such songs as &quot;Harry&#x27;s Jockstrap&quot;, featuring his wife Susan, to the tune of &quot;Frère Jacques&quot;). The album failed to chart.

In the late 1960s, Goodman recorded a mostly musical album featuring his wife, entitled &quot;Dickie Goodman and His Wife Susan&quot;. Goodman sang on one track on the record, &quot;Never Play Poker with a Man Named Doc (or Eat at a Place Called Mom&#x27;s)&quot;, paraphrasing Nelson Algren&#x27;s novel &quot;A Walk on the Wild Side&quot;). He produced two break-in style pieces and his wife sang the rest of the songs.

In 1969, Goodman parodied the political unrest on college campuses with &quot;On Campus&quot; (#45 on &quot;Billboard&quot;) and the first Moon landing with &quot;Luna Trip&quot; (#95). Vik Venus&#x27;s &quot;Moonflight&quot;, which imitated Goodman&#x27;s break-in style, reached #38 on 9 August 1969, much higher than &quot;On Campus&quot; one week after the latter peaked. Goodman&#x27;s records also inspired KQV morning disc jockey Bob DeCarlo&#x27;s top 10 hit &quot;Convention &#x27;72&quot; under the name the Delegates. Goodman himself spoofed political issues such as the Watergate scandal with &quot;Watergrate&quot; (#42 in 1973), the energy crisis with &quot;Energy Crisis &#x27;74&quot; (#33 in 1974), and Richard Nixon with &quot;Mr. President&quot; (#73 in 1974). Goodman released a different version of &quot;Mr. President&quot; in 1981 after Ronald Reagan became president, but this recording did not chart.

Goodman also produced recordings for other acts. John &amp; Ernest&#x27;s &quot;Superfly Meets Shaft&quot; (#31 in 1973), while made for a black audience, retained Goodman&#x27;s &quot;break-in&quot; format. He created the Glass Bottle, a pop band, primarily as an advertising ploy to promote glass bottles, which soda companies were replacing with plastic bottles. The Glass Bottle recorded two singles, both straight pop songs; one of them, &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Got Time Anymore&quot;, hit #36 in 1971. In 1974, Goodman anonymously released &quot;Screwy T.V.&quot;, an album of risque parodies of then-popular TV shows. This album proved less popular than &quot;My Son the Joke&quot;, as many record shops kept it &quot;under the counter&quot; because its cover showed two nude models (reportedly Susan and Dickie Goodman themselves) seen from the rear.

In 1975, Goodman parodied the film &quot;Jaws&quot; with &quot;Mr. Jaws&quot; (#4 on &quot;Billboard&quot;). It was his biggest-selling record, earning a R.I.A.A. gold record in September 1975. The record shot to No. 1 on 11 October 1975 on Chicago&#x27;s WLS, who played a customized version featuring &quot;This is Dickie Goodman at WLS ...&quot; at the beginning. &quot;Mr. Jaws&quot; also charted in the Top Ten in Great Britain and won a Juno Award in Canada.

Goodman&#x27;s final chart record was &quot;Kong&quot; (#48 on &quot;Billboard&quot; in 1977), a spoof of the 1976 remake of &quot;King Kong&quot;. It was followed by others that failed to make the Top 100. &quot;Hey ET&quot;, based on Spielberg&#x27;s movie E.T. the Extraterrestrial, was Dickie Goodman&#x27;s last release to reach Billboard&#x27;s Bubbling Under chart (Top 200). Altogether, Goodman charted seventeen hits, with five of them reaching the top 40. Joel Whitburn&#x27;s &quot;Top Pop Singles&quot; listed Dickie Goodman&#x27;s &quot;Billboard&quot; ranking at #1 (17 in the Top 100) for Comedy, and &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; certified him for the most charted comedy hits (seventeen) on &quot;Billboard&quot;. Goodman produced several other break-in records which garnered airplay and charted only in a few regions, including Los Angeles and New York City.

Luniverse, Goodman&#x27;s record label, also featured works by other artists, including the Del-Vikings. Among his other labels were Eldorado (mostly used for singers like Joann Campbell), All Star (also used for singers and bands), Novelty, Comic, Cash, Rainy Wednesday, Oron, Ramgo (created with his new partner, Bill Ramal), M.D., JMD, Shark, Wacko, Extran and Goodname.

Goodman&#x27;s break-in records were themselves spoofed by Albert Brooks in a comedy bit called &quot;Party from Outer Space.&quot;

==Death==
Goodman died in North Carolina from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He is survived by his two sons, Jon and Jed, and his daughter Janie. In 2000, Jon released &quot;The King of Novelty&quot;, a biography of Dickie&#x27;s life and work, along with autobiographical material. The book also contains the most comprehensive chronology of Dickie Goodman&#x27;s records, including CD re-releases. The entire repertoire is now available from Jon Goodman Publishing on all of the major music download and streaming sites.

<text>Double Star was a joint satellite based space mission by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and the European Space Agency (ESA). It was the first space mission launched by China to investigate Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere. It consisted of two satellites: an Equatorial satellite (TC-1) and Polar satellite (TC-2). Double Star followed in the footsteps of ESA&#x27;s Cluster mission by studying the effects of the Sun on the Earth&#x27;s environment. After a nominal mission of one year (from the launch of TC-2 in July 2004), the Double Star mission was extended twice by both agencies until the end of September 2007.

==Overview==
The Double Star mission used two satellites in Earth orbit - each designed, developed, launched, and operated by the China National Space Administration. ESA has agreed to contribute 8 million Euros to the Double Star programme. This funding was used for refurbishment and pre-integration of the European instruments, acquisition of data for four hours per day and co-ordination of scientific operations. This schedule enabled Double Star to operate simultaneously with ESA&#x27;s Cluster mission.

The first equatorial spacecraft (Double Star 1, also known as DoubleStar1, Tan Ce 1, Chinese for Explorer 1, TC-1) was launched by a Long March 2C launch vehicle on December 29, 2003, at 19:06 UTC. Its purpose was to investigate Earth&#x27;s huge &#x27;magnetotail&#x27;, the region where particles are accelerated towards the planet&#x27;s magnetic poles by a process known as &#x27;reconnection&#x27;.

The second polar spacecraft (Double Star 2, also known as DoubleStar2, Explorer 2, Tan Ce 2, TC-2) was launched July 25, 2004 at 07:05 UTC, also by a Long March 2C. It focuses on physical processes taking place over the magnetic poles and the development of aurorae.

The mission formally ended on October 14, 2007, when the TC-1 spacecraft re-entered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere after being decommissioned (an unavoidable consequence of its equatorial orbit). The TC-2 spacecraft and payload continued to operate until late 2008, when contact was lost.

==Launch and orbits==
TC-1 was launched into an equatorial elliptical orbit of 570 x 78 970 km with inclination 28.5° to the equator from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center. This apogee of this mission was the deepest into space China had ever sent a spacecraft at that time.

The TC-2 spacecraft was launched into a polar elliptical orbit of 700 x 39 000 km, inclination 90° to the equator from Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center.

<doc id="796009" wikidata="Q329989" url="?curid=796009" title="Demons (Dostoevsky novel)">
<text>Demons (pre-reform Russian: ; post-reform ; sometimes also called The Possessed or The Devils) is a novel by Fyodor Dostoevsky, first published in the journal &quot;The Russian Messenger&quot; in 1871–72. It is considered one of the four masterworks written by Dostoevsky after his return from Siberian exile, along with &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; (1866), &quot;The Idiot&quot; (1869), and &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; (1880). &quot;Demons&quot; is a social and political satire, a psychological drama, and large-scale tragedy. Joyce Carol Oates has described it as &quot;Dostoevsky&#x27;s most confused and violent novel, and his most satisfactorily &#x27;tragic&#x27; work.&quot; According to Ronald Hingley, it is Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;greatest onslaught on Nihilism&quot;, and &quot;one of humanity&#x27;s most impressive achievements—perhaps even its supreme achievement—in the art of prose fiction.&quot;

&quot;Demons&quot; is an allegory of the potentially catastrophic consequences of the political and moral nihilism that were becoming prevalent in Russia in the 1860s. A fictional town descends into chaos as it becomes the focal point of an attempted revolution, orchestrated by master conspirator Pyotr Verkhovensky. The mysterious aristocratic figure of Nikolai Stavrogin—Verkhovensky&#x27;s counterpart in the moral sphere—dominates the book, exercising an extraordinary influence over the hearts and minds of almost all the other characters. The idealistic, Western-influenced intellectuals of the 1840s, epitomized in the character of Stepan Verkhovensky (who is both Pyotr Verkhovensky&#x27;s father and Nikolai Stavrogin&#x27;s childhood teacher), are presented as the unconscious progenitors and helpless accomplices of the &quot;demonic&quot; forces that take possession of the town.

==Title==
The original Russian title is &quot;Bésy&quot; (, singular Бес, &quot;bés&quot;), which means &quot;demons&quot;. There are three English translations of the title: &quot;The Possessed&quot;, &quot;The Devils&quot;, and &quot;Demons&quot;. Constance Garnett&#x27;s 1916 translation popularized the novel and gained it notoriety as &quot;The Possessed&quot;, but this title has been disputed by later translators. They argue that &quot;&quot;The Possessed&quot; points in the wrong direction because &quot;Bésy&quot; refers to active subjects rather than passive objects—&quot;possessors&quot; rather than &quot;the possessed&quot;.&quot; &quot;Demons&quot; in this sense refer not so much to &quot;individuals&quot; as to the &quot;ideas&quot; that possess them. For Dostoevsky, &#x27;ideas&#x27; are living cultural forces that have the capacity to seduce and subordinate the individual consciousness, and the individual who has become alienated from his own concrete national traditions is particularly susceptible. According to translator Richard Pevear, the demons are &quot;that legion of isms that came to Russia from the West: idealism, rationalism, empiricism, materialism, utilitarianism, positivism, socialism, anarchism, nihilism, and, underlying them all, atheism.&quot; The counter-ideal (expressed in the novel through the character of Ivan Shatov) is that of an authentically Russian culture growing out of the people&#x27;s inherent spirituality and faith, but even this—as mere idealization and an attempt to reassert something that has been lost—is another idea and lacks real force.

In a letter to his friend Apollon Maykov, Dostoevsky alludes to the episode of the Exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac in the Gospel of Luke as the inspiration for the title: &quot;Exactly the same thing happened in our country: the devils went out of the Russian man and entered into a herd of swine... These are drowned or will be drowned, and the healed man, from whom the devils have departed, sits at the feet of Jesus.&quot; Part of the passage is used as an epigraph, and Dostoevsky&#x27;s thoughts on its relevance to Russia are given voice by Stepan Verkhovensky on his deathbed near the end of the novel.

==Background==
In late 1860s Russia there was an unusual level of political unrest caused by student groups influenced by liberal, socialist, and revolutionary ideas. In 1869, Dostoevsky conceived the idea of a &#x27;pamphlet novel&#x27; directed against the radicals. He focused on the group organized by young agitator Sergey Nechayev, particularly —at the Petrovskaya Agricultural Academy in Moscow. Dostoevsky had first heard of Ivanov from his brother-in-law, who was a student at the academy, and had been much interested in his rejection of radicalism and exhortation of the Russian Orthodox Church and the House of Romanov as the true custodians of Russia&#x27;s destiny. He was horrified to hear of Ivanov&#x27;s murder by the Nechayevists, and vowed to write a political novel about what he called &quot;the most important problem of our time.&quot; Prior to this Dostoevsky had been working on a philosophical novel (entitled &#x27;The Life of a Great Sinner&#x27;) examining the psychological and moral implications of atheism. The political polemic and parts of the philosophical novel were merged into a single larger scale project, which became &quot;Demons&quot;. As work progressed, the liberal and nihilistic characters began to take on a secondary role as Dostoevsky focused more on the amoralism of a charismatic aristocratic figure—Nikolai Stavrogin.

Although a merciless satirical attack on various forms of radical thought and action, &quot;Demons&quot; does not bear much resemblance to the typical anti-nihilist novels of the era (as found in the work of Nikolai Leskov for example), which tended to present the nihilists as deceitful and utterly selfish villains in an essentially black and white moral world. Dostoevsky&#x27;s nihilists are portrayed in their ordinary human weakness, drawn into the world of destructive ideas through vanity, naïveté, idealism, and the susceptibility of youth. In re-imagining Nechayev&#x27;s orchestration of the murder, Dostoevsky was attempting to &quot;depict those diverse and multifarious motives by which even the purest of hearts and the most innocent of people can be drawn in to committing such a monstrous offence.&quot; In &quot;A Writer&#x27;s Diary&quot;, he discusses the relationship of the ideas of his own generation to those of the current generation, and suggests that in his youth he too could have become a follower of someone like Nechayev. As a young man Dostoevsky himself was a member of a radical organisation (the Petrashevsky Circle), for which he was arrested and exiled to a Siberian prison camp. Dostoevsky was an active participant in a secret revolutionary society formed from among the members of the Petrashevsky Circle. The cell&#x27;s founder and leader, the aristocrat Nikolay Speshnev, is thought by many commentators to be the principal inspiration for the character of Stavrogin.

==Narration==
The first person narrator is a minor character, Anton Lavrentyevich G—v, who is a close friend and confidant of Stepan Verkhovensky. Young, educated, upright, and sensible, Anton Lavrentyevich is a local civil servant who has decided to write a chronicle of the strange events that have recently occurred in his town. Despite being a secondary character, he has a surprisingly intimate knowledge of all the characters and events, such that the narrative often seems to metamorphose into that of the omniscient third person. According to Joseph Frank, this unusual narrative point-of-view enables Dostoevsky &quot;to portray his main figures against a background of rumor, opinion and scandal-mongering that serves somewhat the function of a Greek chorus in relation to the central action.&quot;

The narrator&#x27;s voice is intelligent, frequently ironic and psychologically perceptive, but it is only periodically the dominant voice, and often seems to disappear altogether. Much of the narrative unfolds dialogically, implied and explicated through the interactions of the characters, the internal dialogue of a single character, or through a combination of the two, rather than through the narrator&#x27;s story-telling or description. In &quot;Problems of Dostoevsky&#x27;s Poetics&quot; the Russian philosopher and literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin describes Dostoevsky&#x27;s literary style as polyphonic, with the cast of individual characters being a multiplicity of &quot;voice-ideas&quot;, restlessly asserting and defining themselves in relation to each other. The narrator in this sense is present merely as an agent for recording the synchronisation of multiple autonomous narratives, with his own voice weaving in and out of the contrapuntal texture.

==Characters==

===Major characters===
* Stepan Trofimovich Verkhovensky is a refined and high-minded intellectual who unintentionally contributes to the development of nihilistic forces, centering on his son Pyotr Stepanovich and former pupil Nikolai Stavrogin, that ultimately bring local society to the brink of collapse. The character is Dostoevsky&#x27;s rendering of an archetypal liberal idealist of the 1840s Russian intelligentsia, and is based partly on Timofey Granovsky and Alexander Herzen.
:The novel begins with the narrator&#x27;s affectionate but ironic description of Stepan Trofimovich&#x27;s character and early career. He had the beginnings of a career as a lecturer at the University, and for a short time was a prominent figure among the exponents of the &#x27;new ideas&#x27; that were beginning to influence Russian cultural life. He claims that government officials viewed him as a dangerous thinker, forcing him out of academia and into exile in the provinces, but in reality, it was more likely that no one of note in the government even knew who he was. In any case, his anxiety prompted him to accept Varvara Stavrogina&#x27;s proposal that he take upon himself &quot;the education and the entire intellectual development of her only son in the capacity of a superior pedagogue and friend, not to mention a generous remuneration.&quot; 
:A chaste, idealistic but fraught relationship between Stepan Trofimovich and Varvara Stavrogina continues long after the tuition has ceased. In a cynical but not entirely inaccurate critique of his father, Pyotr Stepanovich describes their mutual dependence thus: &quot;she provided the capital, and you were her sentimental buffoon.&quot; Though very conscious of his own erudition, higher ideals and superior aesthetic sensibilities, Stepan Trofimovich doesn&#x27;t actually seem to do anything at all in the scholarly sense. He is utterly dependent on Varvara Petrovna financially and she frequently rescues him from the consequences of his irresponsibility. When he perceives that he has been unjust or irresponsible in relation to her, he is overcome with shame to the point of physical illness. 
* Varvara Petrovna Stavrogina is a wealthy and influential landowner, residing on the magnificent estate of Skvoreshniki where much of the action of the novel takes place. 
:She supports Stepan Trofimovich financially and emotionally, protects him, fusses over him, and in the process acquires for herself an idealized romantic poet, modelled somewhat on the writer Nestor Kukolnik. She promotes his reputation as the town&#x27;s preeminent intellectual, a reputation he happily indulges at regular meetings, often enhanced with champagne, of the local &quot;free-thinkers&quot;. 
:Generous, noble-minded and strong willed, Varvara Petrovna prides herself on her patronage of artistic and charitable causes. She is &quot;a classic kind of woman, a female Maecenas, who acted strictly out of the highest considerations&quot;. But she is also extremely demanding and unforgiving, and is almost terrifying to Stepan Trofimovich when he inadvertently fails her or humiliates her in some way. Pyotr Stepanovich, on his arrival in the town, is quick to take advantage of her resentment towards his father.
:Varvara Petrovna almost worships her son Nikolai Vsevolodovich, but there are indications that she is aware that there is something deeply wrong. She tries to ignore this however, and Pyotr Stepanovich is able to further ingratiate himself by subtly presenting her son&#x27;s inexplicable behaviour in a favourable light.

* Nikolai Vsevolodovich Stavrogin is the central character of the novel. He is handsome, strong, fearless, intelligent and refined, but at the same time, according to the narrator, there is something repellent about him. Socially he is self-assured and courteous, but his general demeanour is described as &quot;stern, pensive and apparently distracted.&quot; Other characters are fascinated by Stavrogin, especially the younger Verkhovensky, who envisions him as the figurehead of the revolution he is attempting to spark. Shatov, on the other hand, once looked up to him as a potentially great leader who could inspire Russia to a Christian regeneration. Disillusioned, he now sees him as &quot;an idle, footloose son of a landowner&quot;, a man who has lost the distinction between good and evil. According to Shatov, Stavrogin is driven by &quot;a passion for inflicting torment&quot;, not merely for the pleasure of harming others, but to torment his own conscience and wallow in the sensation of &quot;moral carnality&quot;. In an originally censored chapter (included as &quot;At Tikhon&#x27;s&quot; in modern editions), Stavrogin himself defines the rule of his life thus: &quot;that I neither know nor feel good and evil and that I have not only lost any sense of it, but that there is neither good nor evil... and that it is just a prejudice&quot;. In a written confession given to the monk Tikhon he tells of a number of crimes, including raping and driving to suicide a girl of only 11 years. He describes in detail the profound inner pleasure he experiences when he becomes conscious of himself in shameful situations, particularly in moments of committing a crime.
:When in Petersburg Stavrogin had secretly married the mentally and physically disabled Marya Lebyadkina. He shows signs of caring for her, but ultimately becomes complicit in her murder. The extent to which he himself is responsible for the murder is unclear, but he is aware that it is being plotted and does nothing to prevent it. In a letter to Darya Pavlovna near the end of the novel, he affirms that he is guilty in his own conscience for the death of his wife.

* Pyotr Stepanovich Verkhovensky is the son of Stepan Trofimovich and the principal driving force of the mayhem that ultimately engulfs the town. The father and son are a representation of the aetiological connection Dostoevsky perceived between the liberal idealists of the 1840s and the nihilistic revolutionaries of the 1860s. The character of Pyotr Stepanovich was inspired by the revolutionary Sergey Nechayev, in particular the methods described in his manifesto &quot;Catechism of a Revolutionary&quot;. In the &quot;Catechism&quot; revolutionaries are encouraged to &quot;aid the growth of calamity and every evil, which must at last exhaust the patience of the people and force them into a general uprising.&quot; Verkhovensky&#x27;s murder of Shatov in the novel was based on the Nechayevites&#x27; murder of Ivanov.
:Pyotr Stepanovich claims to be connected to the central committee of a vast, organized conspiracy to overthrow the government and establish socialism. He manages to convince his small group of co-conspirators that they are just one revolutionary cell among many, and that their part in the scheme will help set off a nationwide revolt. Pyotr Stepanovich is enamored of Stavrogin, and he tries desperately, through a combination of ensnarement and persuasion, to recruit him to the cause. The revolution he envisages will ultimately require a despotic leader, and he thinks that Stavrogin&#x27;s strong will, personal charisma and &quot;unusual aptitude for crime&quot; are the necessary qualities for such a leader.
:Pyotr Verkhovensky, according to Stavrogin, is &quot;an enthusiast&quot;. At every opportunity he uses his prodigious verbal abilities to sow discord and manipulate people for his own political ends. His greatest success is with the Governor&#x27;s wife, and he manages to gain an extraordinary influence over her and her social circle. This influence, in conjunction with constant undermining of authority figures like his father and the Governor, is ruthlessly exploited to bring about a breakdown of standards in society.

* Ivan Pavlovich Shatov is the son of Varvara Stavrogina&#x27;s deceased valet. When he was a child she took him and his sister Darya Pavlovna under her protection, and they received tutoring from Stepan Trofimovich. At university Shatov had socialist convictions and was expelled following an incident. He travelled abroad as a tutor with a merchant&#x27;s family, but the employment came to an end when he married the family&#x27;s governess who had been dismissed for &#x27;freethinking&#x27;. Having no money and not recognizing the ties of marriage, they parted almost immediately. He wandered Europe alone before eventually returning to Russia.
:By the time of the events in the novel Shatov has completely rejected his former convictions and become a passionate defender of Russia&#x27;s Christian heritage. Shatov&#x27;s reformed ideas resemble those of the contemporary philosophy &quot;Pochvennichestvo&quot; (roughly: &quot;return to the soil&quot;), with which Dostoevsky was sympathetic. Like the broader Slavophile movement, &quot;Pochvennichestvo&quot; asserted the paramount importance of Slavic traditions in Russia, as opposed to cultural influences originating in Western Europe, and particularly emphasized the unique mission of the Russian Orthodox Church. Shatov goes further by describing that mission as universal rather than merely Russian. Generally awkward, gloomy and taciturn, Shatov becomes emotional and loquacious when aroused by an affront to his convictions. In the chapter &#x27;Night&#x27; he engages in a heated discussion with Stavrogin about God, Russia and morality. As a younger man Shatov had idolized Stavrogin, but having seen through him and guessed the secret of his marriage, he seeks to tear down the idol in a withering critique. Stavrogin, though affected, is certainly not withered, and answers by drawing attention to the inadequacy of Shatov&#x27;s own faith, something Shatov himself recognizes.
:Shatov&#x27;s relationship with Pyotr Verkhovensky is one of mutual hatred. Verkhovensky conceives the idea of having the group murder him as a traitor to the cause, thereby binding them closer together by the blood they have shed.

* Alexei Nilych Kirillov is an engineer who lives in the same house as Shatov. He also has a connection to Verkhovensky&#x27;s revolutionary society, but of a very unusual kind: he is determined to kill himself and has agreed to do it at a time when it can be of use to the society&#x27;s aims.
:Like Shatov, Kirillov has been deeply influenced by Stavrogin, but in a diametrically opposed way. While inspiring Shatov with the ecstatic image of the Russian Christ, Stavrogin was simultaneously encouraging Kirillov toward the logical extremes of atheism - the absolute supremacy of the human will. &quot;If God does not exist&quot; according to Kirillov, &quot;then all will is mine, and I am obliged to proclaim self-will.&quot; This proclamation must take the form of the act of killing himself, with the sole motive being annihilation of mankind&#x27;s fear of death, a fear implicit in their belief in God. He believes that this purposeful act, by demonstrating the transcendence of this fear, will initiate the new era of the Man-God, when there is no God other than the human will.
:Despite the apparent grandiosity of the idea, Kirillov is a reclusive, deeply humble, almost selfless person who has become obsessed with making himself a sacrifice for the greater good of humanity. Pyotr Stepanovich tells him: &quot;You haven&#x27;t consumed the idea but you... have been consumed by the idea, and so you won&#x27;t be able to relinquish it.&quot; The motives are of no interest to Pyotr Stepanovich, but he recognizes the sincerity of Kirillov&#x27;s intention and incorporates it into his plans as a means of deflecting attention from the conspiracy.

===Other characters===
* Lizaveta Nikolaevna Tushina (Liza) is a lively, beautiful, intelligent and wealthy young woman. She is the daughter of Varvara Petrovna&#x27;s friend Praskovya, and is another former pupil of Stepan Trofimovich. She has become ambiguously involved with Stavrogin after their encounter in Switzerland and seems to oscillate between deep love and profound hatred for him. She is resentful and suspicious of Dasha&#x27;s strange intimacy with him, and is extremely anxious to understand the nature of his connection to Marya Lebyadkina during the time when the marriage is still a secret. Liza becomes engaged to her cousin Mavriky Nikolaevich, but remains fixated on Stavrogin even after he openly acknowledges his marriage.
* Darya Pavlovna (Dasha) is Shatov&#x27;s sister, the protégé of Varvara Petrovna, and for a short time the fiancée of Stepan Trofimovich. She is the reluctant confidant and &quot;nurse&quot; of Stavrogin.
* Marya Timofeevna Lebyadkina is married to Nikolai Stavrogin. Though childlike, mentally unstable and confused, she frequently demonstrates a deeper insight into what is going on, and has many of the attributes of a &quot;holy fool&quot;. According to Frank, Marya represents &quot;Dostoevsky&#x27;s vision of the primitive religious sensibility of the Russian people&quot;, and the false marriage, her rejection of Stavrogin, and her eventual murder, point to the impossibility of a true union between the Christian Russian people and godless Russian Europeanism.
* Captain Lebyadkin is Marya&#x27;s brother. He receives payments for her care from Stavrogin, but he mistreats her and squanders the money on himself. He is loud, indiscreet, and almost always drunk. He considers himself a poet and frequently quotes his own verses. Although in awe of Stavrogin, he is a constant threat to maintaining the secrecy of the marriage. He is unwillingly involved in Pyotr Stepanovich&#x27;s plans, and his inept attempts to extract himself via approaches to the authorities are another cause of his eventual murder.
* Fed&#x27;ka the Convict is an escaped convict who is suspected of several thefts and murders in the town. He was originally a serf belonging to Stepan Trofimovich, but was sold into the army to help pay his master&#x27;s gambling debts. It is Fed&#x27;ka who murders Stavrogin&#x27;s wife and her brother, at the instigation of Pyotr Stepanovich. Stavrogin himself initially opposes the murder, but his later actions suggest a kind of passive consent.
* Andrey Antonovich von Lembke is the Governor of the province and one of the principal targets of Pyotr Stepanovich in his quest for societal breakdown. Although a good and conscientious man he is completely incapable of responding effectively to Pyotr Stepanovich&#x27;s machinations. Estranged from his wife, who has unwittingly become a pawn in the conspirators&#x27; game, he descends into a mental breakdown as events get increasingly out of control.
* Julia Mikhaylovna von Lembke is the Governor&#x27;s wife. Her vanity and liberal ambition are exploited by Pyotr Stepanovich for his revolutionary aims. The conspirators succeed in transforming her Literary Fête for the benefit of poor governesses into a scandalous farce. Dostoevsky&#x27;s depiction of the relationship between Pyotr Stepanovich and Julia Mikhaylovna had its origins in a passage from Nechayev&#x27;s &quot;Catechism&quot; where revolutionaries are instructed to consort with liberals &quot;on the basis of their own program, pretending to follow them blindly&quot; but with the purpose of compromising them so that they can be &quot;used to provoke disturbances.&quot;
* Semyon Yegorovich Karmazinov is Dostoevsky&#x27;s literary caricature of his contemporary Ivan Turgenev, author of the proto-nihilist novel &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot; (1862). Of the same generation as Stepan Trofimovich, Karmazinov is a vain and pretentious literary has-been who shamelessly seeks to ingratiate himself with Pyotr Stepanovich and does much to promote the nihilists&#x27; legitimacy among the liberal establishment.
* Shigalyev is a historian and social theorist, the intellectual of Verkhovensky&#x27;s revolutionary group, who has devised a system for the post-revolution organization of mankind. &quot;My conclusion&quot; he says, &quot;stands in direct contradiction to the idea from which I started. Proceeding from unlimited freedom, I end with unlimited despotism.&quot; Ninety percent of society is to be enslaved to the remaining ten percent. Equality of the herd is to be enforced by police state tactics, state terrorism, and destruction of intellectual, artistic, and cultural life. It is estimated that about a hundred million people will need to be killed on the way to the goal.
* Bishop Tikhon is a monk and spiritual adviser recommended to Stavrogin by Shatov. He only appears in the censored chapter, but he has importance as the person to whom Stavrogin makes his most detailed and candid confession. He is perhaps the only character to truly understand Stavrogin&#x27;s spiritual and psychological state. He describes the confession as coming from &quot;the need of a heart that has been mortally wounded&quot; and advises Stavrogin to submit his life to an Elder. Dostoevsky&#x27;s model for the character of Bishop Tikhon was the 18th century monk and writer Tikhon of Zadonsk.

==Plot summary==
The novel is in three parts. There are two epigraphs, the first from Pushkin&#x27;s poem &quot;Demons&quot; and the second from Luke 8:32–36.

===Part I===

After an almost illustrious but prematurely curtailed academic career Stepan Trofimovich Verkhovensky is residing with the wealthy landowner Varvara Petrovna Stavrogina at her estate, Skvoreshniki, in a provincial Russian town. Originally employed as a tutor to Stavrogina&#x27;s son Nikolai Vsevolodovich, Stepan Trofimovich has been there for almost twenty years in an intimate but platonic relationship with his noble patroness. Stepan Trofimovich also has a son from a previous marriage but he has grown up elsewhere without his father&#x27;s involvement.

A troubled Varvara Petrovna has just returned from Switzerland where she has been visiting Nikolai Vsevolodovich. She berates Stepan Trofimovich for his financial irresponsibility, but her main preoccupation is an &quot;intrigue&quot; she encountered in Switzerland concerning her son and his relations with Liza Tushina—the beautiful daughter of her friend Praskovya. Praskovya and Liza arrive at the town, without Nikolai Vsevolodovich who has gone to Petersburg. According to Praskovya, Varvara Petrovna&#x27;s young protégée Darya Pavlovna (Dasha), has also somehow become involved with Nikolai Vsevolodovich, but the details are ambiguous. Varvara Petrovna suddenly conceives the idea of forming an engagement between Stepan Trofimovich and Dasha. Though dismayed, Stepan Trofimovich accedes to her proposal, which happens to resolve a delicate financial issue for him. Influenced by gossip, he begins to suspect that he is being married off to cover up &quot;another man&#x27;s sins&quot; and writes &quot;noble&quot; letters to his fiancée and Nikolai Vsevolodovich. Matters are further complicated by the arrival of a mysterious &quot;crippled woman&quot;, Marya Lebyadkina, to whom Nikolai Vsevolodovich is also rumoured to be connected, although no one seems to know exactly how. A hint is given when Varvara Petrovna asks the mentally disturbed Marya, who has approached her outside church, if she is Lebyadkina and she replies that she is not.

Varvara Petrovna takes Marya (and Liza who has insisted on coming with them) back to Skvoreshniki. Already present are Dasha, her older brother Ivan Shatov, and a nervous Stepan Trofimovich. Praskovya arrives, accompanied by her nephew Mavriky Nikolaevich, demanding to know why her daughter has been dragged in to Varvara Petrovna&#x27;s &quot;scandal&quot;. Varvara Petrovna questions Dasha about a large sum of money that Nikolai Vsevolodovich supposedly sent through her to Marya&#x27;s brother, but in spite of her straightforward answers matters don&#x27;t become any clearer. Marya&#x27;s brother, the drunkard Captain Lebyadkin, comes looking for his sister and confuses Varvara Petrovna even further with semi-deranged rantings about some sort of dishonour that must remain unspoken. At this point the butler announces that Nikolai Vsevolodovich has arrived. To everyone&#x27;s surprise, however, a complete stranger walks in and immediately begins to dominate the conversation. It turns out to be Pyotr Stepanovich Verkhovensky, Stepan Trofimovich&#x27;s son. As he is talking, Nikolai Stavrogin quietly enters. Varvara Petrovna stops him imperiously and, indicating Marya, demands to know if she is his lawful wife. He looks at his mother impassively, says nothing, kisses her hand, and unhurriedly approaches Marya. In soothing tones he explains to Marya that he is her devoted friend, not her husband or fiancé, that she should not be here, and that he will escort her home. She agrees and they leave. In the din that breaks out after their departure, the strongest voice is that of Pyotr Stepanovich, and he manages to persuade Varvara Petrovna to listen to his explanation for what has occurred. According to him, Nikolai Vsevolodovich became acquainted with the Lebyadkins when he was living a life of &quot;mockery&quot; in Petersburg five years earlier. The downtrodden, crippled and half mad Marya had fallen hopelessly in love with him and he had responded by treating her &quot;like a marquise&quot;. She began to think of him as her fiancé, and when he left he made arrangements for her support, including a substantial allowance, which her brother proceeded to appropriate as though he had some sort of right to it. Varvara Petrovna is elated and almost triumphant to hear that her son&#x27;s actions had a noble foundation rather than a shameful one. Under interrogation from Pyotr Stepanovich, Captain Lebyadkin reluctantly confirms the truth of the whole story. He departs in disgrace as Nikolai Vsevolodovich returns from escorting Marya home. Nikolai Vsevolodovich addresses himself to Dasha with congratulations on her impending marriage, of which, he says, he was expressly informed. As if on cue, Pyotr Stepanovich says that he too has received a long letter from his father about an impending marriage, but that one cannot make sense of it—something about having to get married because of &quot;another man&#x27;s sins&quot;, and pleading to be &quot;saved&quot;. An enraged Varvara Petrovna tells Stepan Trofimovich to leave her house and never come back. In the uproar that follows no-one notices Shatov, who has not said a word the entire time, walking across the room to stand directly in front of Nikolai Vsevolodovich. He looks him in the eye for a long time without saying anything, then suddenly hits him in the face with all his might. Stavrogin staggers, recovers himself, and seizes Shatov; but he immediately takes his hands away, and stands motionless, calmly returning Shatov&#x27;s gaze. It is Shatov who lowers his eyes, and leaves, apparently crushed. Liza screams and collapses on the floor in a faint.

===Part II===

News of the events at Skvoreshniki spreads through society surprisingly rapidly. The main participants seclude themselves, with the exception of Pyotr Stepanovich who actively insinuates himself into the social life of the town. After eight days, he calls on Stavrogin and the true nature of their relations begins to become apparent. There was not, as some suspect, an explicit understanding between them. Rather Pyotr Stepanovich is trying to involve Stavrogin in some radical political plans of his own, and is avidly seeking to be of use to him. Stavrogin, while he seems to accept Pyotr Stepanovich acting on his behalf, is largely unresponsive to these overtures and continues to pursue his own agenda.

That night Stavrogin leaves Skvoreshniki in secret and makes his way on foot to Fillipov&#x27;s house, where Shatov lives. The primary object of his visit is to consult his friend Kirillov, who also lives at the house. Stavrogin has received an extraordinarily insulting letter from Artemy Gaganov, the son of a respected landowner—Pavel Gaganov—whose nose he pulled as a joke some years earlier, and has been left with no choice but to challenge him to a duel. He asks Kirillov to be his second and to make the arrangements. They then discuss philosophical issues arising out of Kirillov&#x27;s firm intention to commit suicide in the near future. Stavrogin proceeds to Shatov, and once again the background to the events at Skvoreshniki begins to reveal itself. Shatov had guessed the secret behind Stavrogin&#x27;s connection to Marya (they are in fact married) and had struck him out of anger at his &quot;fall&quot;. In the past Stavrogin had inspired Shatov with exhortations of the Russian Christ, but this marriage and other actions have provoked a complete disillusionment, which Shatov now angrily expresses. Stavrogin defends himself calmly and rationally, but not entirely convincingly. He also warns Shatov, who is a former member but now bitter enemy of Pyotr Verkhovensky&#x27;s revolutionary society, that Verkhovensky might be planning to murder him. Stavrogin continues on foot to a distant part of town where he intends to call at the new residence of the Lebyadkins. On the way he encounters Fedka, an escaped convict, who has been waiting for him at the bridge. Pyotr Stepanovich has informed Fedka that Stavrogin may have need of his services in relation to the Lebyadkins, but Stavrogin emphatically rejects this. He tells Fedka that he won&#x27;t give him a penny and that if he meets him again he will tie him up and take him to the police. At the Lebyadkins&#x27; he informs the Captain, to the Captain&#x27;s horror, that in the near future he will be making a public announcement of the marriage and that there will be no more money. He goes in to Marya, but something about him frightens her and she becomes mistrustful. His proposal that she come to live with him in Switzerland is met with scorn. She accuses him of being an imposter who has come to kill her with his knife, and demands to know what he has done with her &quot;Prince&quot;. Stavrogin becomes angry, pushes her violently, and leaves, to Marya&#x27;s frenzied curse. In a fury, he barely notices when Fedka pops up again, reiterating his requests for assistance. Stavrogin seizes him, slams him against a wall and begins to tie him up. However, he stops almost immediately and continues on his way, with Fedka following. Eventually Stavrogin bursts into laughter: he empties the contents of his wallet in Fedka&#x27;s face, and walks off.

The duel takes place the following afternoon, but no-one is killed. To Gaganov&#x27;s intense anger, Stavrogin appears to deliberately miss, as if to trivialize the duel and insult his opponent, although he says it is because he doesn&#x27;t want to kill anyone any more. He returns to Skvoreshniki where he encounters Dasha who, as now becomes apparent, is in the role of a confidant and &quot;nurse&quot; in relation to him. He tells her about the duel and the encounter with Fedka, admitting to giving Fedka money that could be interpreted as a down payment to kill his wife. He asks her, in an ironic tone, whether she will still come to him even if he chooses to take Fedka up on his offer. Horrified, Dasha does not answer.

Pyotr Stepanovich meanwhile is very active in society, forming relationships and cultivating conditions that he thinks will help his political aims. He is particularly focused on Julia Mikhaylovna Von Lembke, the Governor&#x27;s wife. By flattery, surrounding her with a retinue and encouraging her exaggerated liberal ambition, he acquires a power over her and over the tone of her salon. He and his group of co-conspirators exploit their new-found legitimacy to generate an atmosphere of frivolity and cynicism in society. They indulge in tasteless escapades, clandestinely distribute revolutionary propaganda, and agitate workers at the local Spigulin factory. They are particularly active in promoting Julia Mikhaylovna&#x27;s &#x27;Literary Gala&#x27; to raise money for poor governesses, and it becomes a much anticipated event for the whole town. The Governor, Andrey Antonovich, is deeply troubled by Pyotr Stepanovich&#x27;s success with his wife and casual disregard for his authority, but is painfully incapable of doing anything about it. Unable to cope with the strange events and mounting pressures, he begins to show signs of acute mental disturbance. Pyotr Stepanovich adopts a similarly destabilizing approach toward his father, driving Stepan Trofimovich into a frenzy by relentlessly ridiculing him and further undermining his disintegrating relationship with Varvara Petrovna.

Pyotr Stepanovich visits Kirillov to remind him of an &quot;agreement&quot; he made to commit suicide at a time convenient to the revolutionary society. He invites Kirillov, and subsequently Shatov, to a meeting of the local branch of the society to be held later that day. He then calls on Stavrogin, arriving just as Mavriky Nikolaevich, Liza&#x27;s new fiancé, is angrily departing. Stavrogin, however, seems to be in a good mood and he willingly accompanies Pyotr Stepanovich to the meeting. Present are a wide variety of idealists, disaffected types and pseudo-intellectuals, most notably the philosopher Shigalyev who attempts to expound his theory on the historically necessary totalitarian social organization of the future. The conversation is inane and directionless until Pyotr Stepanovich takes control and seeks to establish whether there is a real commitment to the cause of violent revolution. He claims that this matter can be resolved by asking a simple question of each individual: in the knowledge of a planned political murder, would you inform the police? As everyone else is hurrying to assert that they would of course not inform, Shatov gets up and leaves, followed by Stavrogin and Kirillov. Uproar ensues. Pyotr Stepanovich abandons the meeting and rushes after Stavrogin. Meeting them at Kirillov&#x27;s place, where Fedka is also present, Verkhovensky demands to know whether Stavrogin will be providing the funds to deal with the Lebyadkins. He has acquired proof, in the form of a letter sent to Von Lembke, that the Captain is contemplating betraying them all. Stavrogin refuses, tells him he won&#x27;t give him Shatov either, and departs. Verkhovensky tries to stop him, but Stavrogin throws him to the ground and continues on his way. Verkhovensky rushes after him again and, to Stavrogin&#x27;s astonishment, suddenly transforms into a raving madman. He launches into an incoherent monologue, alternately passionately persuasive and grovelingly submissive, desperately pleading with Stavrogin to join his cause. The speech amounts to a declaration of love, reaching a climax with the exclamation &quot;Stavrogin, you&#x27;re beautiful!&quot; and an attempt to kiss his hand. Verkhovensky&#x27;s cause, it turns out, has nothing to do with socialism, but is purely about destroying the old order and seizing power, with Stavrogin, the iron-willed leader, at the helm. Stavrogin remains cold, but does not actually say no, and Pyotr Stepanovich persists with his schemes.

Social disquiet escalates as the day of the literary gala approaches. The Governor&#x27;s assistant, under the false impression that Stepan Trofimovich is the source of the problem, orders a raid on his residence. Deeply shocked, Stepan Trofimovich goes to the Governor to complain. He arrives as a large group of workers from the Spigulin factory are staging a protest about work and pay conditions. Already in a precarious state of mind, Andrey Antonovich responds to both problems in a somewhat demented authoritarian fashion. Julia Mikhaylovna and her retinue, among whom are Varvara Petrovna and Liza, return from a visit to Skvoreshniki and the Governor is further humiliated by a public snubbing from his wife. As Julia Mikhaylovna engages charmingly with Stepan Trofimovich and the &#x27;great writer&#x27; Karmazinov, who are to read at the Gala tomorrow, Pyotr Stepanovich enters. Seeing him, Andrey Antonovich begins to show signs of derangement. But attention is immediately diverted to a new drama: Stavrogin has entered the room, and he is accosted by Liza. In a loud voice she complains of harassment from a certain Captain Lebyadkin, who describes himself as Stavrogin&#x27;s relation, the brother of his wife. Stavrogin calmly replies that Marya (née Lebyadkina) is indeed his wife, and that he will make sure the Captain causes her no further trouble. Varvara Petrovna is horrified, but Stavrogin simply smiles and walks out. Liza follows him.

===Part III===

The much vaunted literary matinée and ball takes place the next day. Most of the town has subscribed and all the influential people are present for the reading, with the exception of the Stavrogins. Julia Mikhaylovna, who has somehow managed to reconcile Andrey Antonovich, is at the summit of her ambition. But things go wrong from the beginning. Pyotr Stepanovich&#x27;s associates Lyamshin and Liputin take advantage of their role as stewards to alter proceedings in a provocative way, and allow a lot of low types in without paying. The reading starts with the unscheduled appearance on stage of a hopelessly drunk Captain Lebyadkin, apparently for the purpose of reading some of his poetry. Realizing the Captain is too drunk, Liputin takes it upon himself to read the poem, which is a witless and insulting piece about the hard lot of governesses. He is quickly followed by the literary genius Karmazinov who is reading a farewell to his public entitled &quot;Merci&quot;. For over an hour the great writer plods through an aimless stream of self-absorbed fantasy, sending the audience into a state of complete stupefaction. The torture only comes to an end when an exhausted listener inadvertently cries out &quot;Lord, what rubbish!&quot; and Karmazinov, after exchanging insults with the audience, finally closes with an ironic &quot;&quot;Merci, merci, merci&quot;.&quot; In this hostile atmosphere Stepan Trofimovich takes the stage. He plunges headlong into a passionate exhortation of his own aesthetic ideals, becoming increasingly shrill as he reacts to the derision emanating from the audience. He ends by cursing them and storming off. Pandemonium breaks out as an unexpected third reader, a &#x27;professor&#x27; from Petersburg, immediately takes the stage in his place. Apparently delighted by the disorder, the new orator launches into a frenzied tirade against Russia, shouting with all his might and gesticulating with his fist. He is eventually dragged off stage by six officials, but he somehow manages to escape and returns to briefly continue his harangue before being dragged off again. Supporters in the audience rush to his aid as a schoolgirl takes the stage seeking to rouse oppressed students everywhere to protest.

In the aftermath, Pyotr Stepanovich (who was mysteriously absent from the reading) seeks to persuade a traumatized Julia Mikhaylovna that it wasn&#x27;t as bad as she thinks and that it is essential for her to attend the ball. He also lets her know that the town is ringing with the news of another scandal: Lizaveta Nikolaevna has left her home and fiancé and gone off to Skvoreshniki with Stavrogin.

Despite the disaster of the reading, the ball goes ahead that evening, with Julia Mikhaylovna and Andrey Antonovich in attendance. Many of the respectable public have chosen not to attend but there is an increased number of dubious types, who make straight for the drinking area. Hardly anyone is dancing, most are standing around waiting for something to happen and casting curious glances at the Von Lembkes. A &#x27;literary quadrille&#x27; has been especially choreographed for the occasion, but it is vulgar and stupid and merely bemuses the onlookers. Shocked by some of the antics in the quadrille and the degenerating atmosphere in the hall, Andrey Antonovich lapses back into his authoritarian persona and a frightened Julia Mikhaylovna is forced to apologise for him. Someone shouts &quot;Fire!&quot; and the news quickly spreads that a large fire is raging in part of the town. There is a stampede for the exits, but Andrey Antonovich screams that all must be searched, and when his distressed wife calls out his name he orders her arrest. Julia Mikhaylovna faints. She is carried to safety, but Andrey Antonovich insists on going to the fire. At the fire he is knocked unconscious by a falling beam, and although he later recovers consciousness, he does not recover his sanity, and his career as governor comes to an end. The fire rages all night, but by morning it has dwindled and rain is falling. News begins to spread of a strange and terrible murder: a certain Captain, his sister and their serving maid have been found stabbed to death in their partially burned down house on the edge of town.

Stavrogin and Liza have spent the night together and they wake to the dying glow of the fire. Liza is ready to leave him, convinced that her life is over. Pyotr Stepanovich arrives to impart the news of the Lebyadkins&#x27; murder. He says the murderer was Fedka the Convict, denies any involvement himself, and assures Stavrogin that legally (and of course morally) he too is in the clear. When Liza demands the truth from Stavrogin, he replies that he was against the murder but knew it was going to happen and didn&#x27;t stop the murderers. Liza rushes off in a frenzy, determined to get to the place of the murders to see the bodies. Stavrogin tells Pyotr Stepanovich to stop her, but Pyotr Stepanovich demands an answer. Stavrogin replies that it might be possible to say yes to him if only he were not such a buffoon, and tells him to come back tomorrow. Appeased, Pyotr Stepanovich pursues Liza, but the attempt to stop her is abandoned when Mavriky Nikolaevich, who has been waiting for her outside all night, rushes to her aid. He and Liza proceed to the town together in the pouring rain. At the scene of the murders an unruly crowd has gathered. By this time it is known that it is Stavrogin&#x27;s wife who has been murdered, and Liza is recognized as &#x27;Stavrogin&#x27;s woman&#x27;. She and Mavriky Nikolaevich are attacked by drunk and belligerent individuals in the crowd. Liza is struck several times on the head and is killed.

Most of society&#x27;s anger for the night&#x27;s events is directed toward Julia Mikhaylovna. Pyotr Stepanovich is not suspected, and news spreads that Stavrogin has left on the train for Petersburg. The revolutionary crew, however, are alarmed. They are on the point of mutiny until Pyotr Stepanovich shows them Lebyadkin&#x27;s letter to Von Lembke. He points to their own undeniable involvement and tells them that Shatov is also determined to denounce them. They agree that Shatov will have to be killed and a plan is made to lure him to the isolated location where he has buried the society&#x27;s printing press. Pyotr Stepanovich explains that Kirillov has agreed to write a note taking responsibility for their crimes before he commits suicide. Shatov himself is preoccupied with the unexpected return of his ex-wife Marie, who has turned up on his doorstep, alone, ill and poverty-stricken. He is overjoyed to see her, and when it turns out that she is going into labour with Stavrogin&#x27;s child he frantically sets about helping her. The child is born and, reconciled with Marie, he is happy that he is going to be the father. That night the emissary from the revolutionary group—Erkel—arrives to escort Shatov to the isolated part of Skvoreshniki where the printing press is buried. Thinking this will be his final interaction with the society, Shatov agrees to come. As he shows Erkel the spot, the other members of the group jump out and grab him. Pyotr Verkhovensky puts a gun to Shatov&#x27;s forehead and fires, killing him. As they clumsily weight the body and dump it in the pond, one of the participants in the crime—Lyamshin—completely loses his head and starts shrieking like an animal. He is restrained and eventually quietened, and they go their separate ways. Early the following morning Pyotr Stepanovich proceeds to Kirillov&#x27;s place. Kirillov has been forewarned and is eagerly awaiting him. However, his aversion to Pyotr Stepanovich and the news of Shatov&#x27;s death arouse a reluctance to comply, and for some time they parley, both with guns in hand. Eventually Kirillov seems to be overcome by the power of his desire to kill himself and despite his misgivings he hurriedly writes and signs the suicide note taking responsibility for the crimes, and runs into the next room. But there is no shot, and Pyotr Stepanovich cautiously follows him into the darkened room. A strange and harrowing confrontation ends with Pyotr Stepanovich fleeing in a panic. A shot rings out and he returns to find that Kirillov has shot himself through the head.

Meanwhile, Stepan Trofimovich, oblivious to the unfolding horrors, has left town on foot, determined to take the high road to an uncertain future. Wandering along with no real purpose or destination, he is offered a lift by some peasants. They take him to their village where he meets Sofya Matveyevna, a travelling gospel seller, and he firmly attaches himself to her. They set off together but Stepan Trofimovich becomes ill and they are forced to take a room at a large cottage. He tells Sofya Matveyevna a somewhat embellished version of his life story and pleads with her not to leave him. To his horror, Varvara Petrovna suddenly turns up at the cottage. She has been looking for him since his disappearance, and her ferocity greatly frightens both Stepan Trofimovich and Sofya Matveyevna. When she realizes that he is extremely ill and that Sofya Matveyevna has been looking after him, her attitude softens and she sends for her doctor. A difficult reconciliation between the two friends, during which some painful events from the past are recalled, is effected. It becomes apparent that Stepan Trofimovich is dying and a priest is summoned. In his final conscious hours he recognizes the deceit of his life, forgives others, and makes an ecstatic speech expressing his re-kindled love of God.

When Shatov fails to return, Marie, still exhausted from the birth, seeks out Kirillov. Encountering the terrible scene of the suicide, she grabs her newborn baby and rushes outside into the cold, desperately seeking help. Eventually the authorities are called to the scene. They read Kirillov&#x27;s note and a short time later Shatov&#x27;s body is discovered at Skvoreshniki. Marie and the baby become ill, and die a few days later. The crime scene at Skvoreshniki reveals that Kirillov must have been acting with others and the story emerges that there is an organized group of revolutionary conspirators behind all the crimes and disorders. Paranoia grips the town, but all is revealed when Lyamshin, unable to bear it, makes a groveling confession to the authorities. He tells the story of the conspiracy in great detail, and the rest of the crew, with the exception of Pyotr Stepanovich who left for Petersburg after Kirillov&#x27;s suicide, are arrested.

Varvara Petrovna, returning to her town house after Stepan Trofimovich&#x27;s death, is greatly shaken by all the terrible news. Darya Pavlovna receives a disturbing letter from Nikolai Vsevolodovich, which she shows to Varvara Petrovna. News arrives from Skvoreshniki that Nikolai Vsevolodovich is there and has locked himself away without saying a word to anyone. They hurry over, and find that Nikolai Vsevolodovich has hanged himself.

===Censored chapter===
The editor of &quot;The Russian Messenger&quot;, Mikhail Katkov, refused to publish the chapter &quot;At Tikhon&#x27;s&quot;. The chapter concerns Stavrogin&#x27;s visit to the monk Tikhon at the local monastery, during which he confesses, in the form of a lengthy and detailed written document, to taking sexual advantage of a downtrodden and vulnerable 11-year-old girl—Matryosha—and then waiting and listening as she goes through the process of hanging herself. He describes his marriage to Marya Lebyadkina as a deliberate attempt to cripple his own life, largely as a consequence of his inability to forget this episode and the fear he experienced in its aftermath. Dostoevsky considered the chapter to be essential to an understanding of the psychology of Stavrogin, and he tried desperately but unsuccessfully to save it through revisions and concessions to Katkov. He was eventually forced to drop it and rewrite parts of the novel that dealt with its subject matter. He never included the chapter in subsequent publications of the novel, but it is generally included in modern editions as an appendix. It has also been published separately, translated from Russian to English by S.S. Koteliansky and Virginia Woolf, with an essay on Dostoevsky by Sigmund Freud.

==Themes==
===Atheism and belief===
Dostoevsky wrote to Maykov that the chief theme of his novel was &quot;the very one over which, consciously and unconsciously, I have been tormented all my life: it is the existence of God.&quot; Much of the plot develops out of the tension between belief and non-belief, and the words and actions of most of the characters seem to be intimately bound to the position they take up within this struggle.

Dostoevsky saw atheism as the root cause of Russia&#x27;s deepening social problems. He further wrote to Maykov on October 9, 1870: &quot;a man who loses his people and his national roots also loses the faith of his fathers and his God.&quot; It is in this letter that he speaks, referring primarily to Stavrogin and secondarily to Stepan Verkhovensky, of the &#x27;Russian Man&#x27; as comparable to the man possessed by demons who is healed by Jesus in the parable of the swine. In &quot;Demons&quot; the Russian man has lost his true national identity (inextricably linked, for Dostoevsky, with the Orthodox Christian faith) and tries to fill the void with ideas derived from Western modes of thought—Catholicism, atheism, scientism, socialism, idealism, etc. As teachers and strong personalities, Stavrogin and Stepan Trofimovich influence those around them, and thus the demons enter the swine. Only at the end, after a heartfelt acknowledgment of their fault, are they given the possibility of redemption—Stavrogin when Tikhon offers him life as a Christian renunciate (an offer that Stavrogin refuses) and Stepan Trofimovich as he approaches death.

Instead of belief in God, Stavrogin has rationality, intellect, self-reliance, and egoism, but the spiritual longing and sensual ardour of his childhood, over-stimulated by his teacher Stepan Trofimovich, has never left him. Unfettered by fear or morality, his life has become a self-centred experiment and a heartless quest to overcome the torment of his growing ennui. The most striking manifestation of his dilemma is in the dialogue with Tikhon, where we find him, perhaps for the only time, truthfully communicating his inner state. In this dialogue there is an alternation in his speech between the stern, worldly voice of rational self-possession and the vulnerable, confessional voice of the lost and suffering soul.

Many of the other characters are deeply affected by one or other of the two aspects of Stavrogin&#x27;s psyche. The nihilist Pyotr Verkhovensky is in love with the cynical, amoral, power-seeking side, while Shatov is affected by the ardour of the feeling, spiritually-bereft side. Shatov &quot;rose from the dead&quot; after hearing Stavrogin&#x27;s uncompromising exhortation of Christ as the supreme ideal (an assertion made in a futile effort to convince himself: he succeeds in convincing Shatov but not himself). Conversely, Kirillov was convinced by Stavrogin&#x27;s exhortation of atheism—the supremacy of Man&#x27;s will, not God&#x27;s—and forges a plan to sacrifice himself to free humanity from its bondage to mystical fear. But Stavrogin himself does not even believe in his own atheism, and as Shatov and Tikhon recognize, drives himself further into evil out of a desire to torture himself and avoid the truth. Kirillov sums up Stavrogin&#x27;s dilemma thus: &quot;If Stavrogin believes, then he doesn&#x27;t believe that he believes. But if he doesn&#x27;t believe, then he doesn&#x27;t believe that he doesn&#x27;t believe.&quot;

===Suicide===
Dostoevsky saw Russia&#x27;s growing suicide rate as a symptom of the decline of religious faith and the concomitant disintegration of social institutions like the family. Self-destruction as a result of atheism or loss of faith is a major theme in &quot;Demons&quot; and further recalls the metaphor of the demon-possessed swine in the epigraph.

In addition to a number of extended dialogues on the subject, mostly involving Kirillov, there are four actual suicides described in the novel. The first is in anecdotal form, told by the narrator after the pranksters associated with Julia Mikaylovna pay a visit to the scene of a suicide. Entrusted with a large sum of money by his family, a hitherto quiet and responsible young man deliberately squanders it all on riotous living over a period of several days. Returning to his hotel, he calmly and politely orders a meal and some wine, writes a short note, and shoots himself through the heart.

The first plot-related suicide is that of Kirillov. Kirillov is a kind of philosopher of suicide and, under questioning from several interlocutors (the narrator, Stavrogin, Pyotr Verkhovensky), expounds his ideas on the subject, mostly as it relates to him personally but also as a general phenomenon. According to him there are two types of people who commit suicide: those who do it suddenly upon being overwhelmed by an unbearable emotion, and those who do it after much thought for good reason. He thinks that everyone could fall into the latter category if it were not for two prejudices: fear of pain, and fear of the next world. &quot;God&quot; he says, &quot;is the pain of the fear of death. Whoever conquers pain and fear will himself become God.&quot; In his mind he is the man who, by his own intentional death, will demonstrate to humanity the transcendence of pain and fear and free them of the need to invent God.

Stavrogin&#x27;s suicide at the end of the novel is only fully understood with reference to the censored chapter. The enormity of his crimes, the desolation of his inner being, the madness born of his &quot;sacrilegious, proto-Nietzschean attempt to transcend the boundaries of good and evil&quot;, are hidden realities that only become visible in the confession and dialogue with Tikhon. Despite this &#x27;madness&#x27;, it is &#x27;rationality&#x27; that is emphasized in the narrator&#x27;s description of the suicide itself. The efficiency of the procedure, the brief, precise note, and the subsequent medical opinion of his mental state emphatically ruling out madness, all point to his &#x27;reasonable&#x27; state of mind at the time of the act.

The final suicide is that of the little girl Matryosha, described by Stavrogin in his confessional letter. After her encounter with Stavrogin, she tells her mother that she has &quot;killed God&quot;. When she hangs herself Stavrogin is present in the next room and aware of what she is doing.

==Commentary==
===&quot;Demons&quot; as satire===
A common criticism of &quot;Demons&quot;, particularly from Dostoevsky&#x27;s liberal and radical contemporaries, is that it is exaggerated and unrealistic, a result of the author&#x27;s over-active imagination and excessive interest in the psycho-pathological. However, despite giving freedom to his imagination, Dostoevsky took great pains to derive the novel&#x27;s characters and story from real people and real ideas of the time. According to Frank, &quot;the book is almost a compressed encyclopedia of the Russian culture of the period it covers, filtered through a witheringly derisive and often grotesquely funny perspective, and it creates a remarkable &#x27;myth&#x27; of the main conflicts of this culture reconstructed on a firm basis of historical personages and events.&quot;

Almost all of the principal characters, or at least their individual guiding ideas, had actually existing contemporary prototypes. Stavrogin was partly based on Dostoevsky&#x27;s comrade from the Petrashevsky Circle, Nikolay Speshnev, and represented an imagined extreme in practice of an amoral, atheistic philosophy like that of Max Stirner. The darkness of Stavrogin is confronted by the radiance of Bishop Tikhon, a character inspired by Tikhon of Zadonsk.

Of Pyotr Verkhovensky, Dostoevsky said that the character is not a portrait of Nechayev but that &quot;my aroused mind has created by imagination the person, the type, that corresponds to the crime... To my own surprise he half turns out to be a comic figure.&quot; Most of the nihilist characters associated with Pyotr Verkhovensky were based on individuals who appeared in the transcripts of the trial of the Nechayevists, which were publicly available and studied by Dostoevsky. The character of Shatov represents a Russian nationalist response to socialist ideas, and was initially based on Nechayev&#x27;s victim Ivanov, but later on the contemporary slavophile ideas of Danilevsky and to some extent on Dostoevsky&#x27;s own reformed ideas about Russia.

Stepan Verkhovensky began as a caricature of Granovsky, and retained the latter&#x27;s neurotic susceptibilities, academic interests, and penchant for writing long confessional letters, but the character was grounded in the idealistic tendencies of many others from the generation of the 1840s, including Herzen, Belinsky, Chaadaev, Turgenev, and Dostoevsky himself. Liberal figures like Stepan Trofimovich, Varvara Petrovna, Liputin, Karmazinov, and the Von Lembkes, and minor authority figures like the old Governor Osip Osipovich and the over-zealous policeman Flibusterov, are parodies of a variety of establishment types that Dostoevsky held partially responsible for the excesses of the radical generation. Karmazinov was an openly hostile parody of Turgenev—his personality and mannerisms, his perceived complicity with nihilism, and, in the Gala reading scene, the style of some of his later literary works.

Even the most extreme and unlikely characters, such as Kirillov and Shigalev, were grounded in real people or ideas of the time. Kirillov was initially inspired by a Nechayev associate who spoke openly at the trial of his plan to commit suicide, but the apocalyptic philosophy the character builds around his obsession is grounded in an interpretation of the anthropotheistic ideas of Feuerbach. Shigalev was initially based on the radical critic V.A. Zaitsev who advocated a form of Social Darwinism that included, for example, an argument that without the protection of slavery the black race would become extinct due to its inherent inferiority. Shigalev&#x27;s notion of human equality, the &quot;earthly paradise&quot; in which nine tenths of humanity are to be deprived of their will and turned into a slave-herd by means of a program of inter-generational &#x27;re-education&#x27;, had a contemporary prototype in the ideas of Petr Tkachev. Tkachev argued that the only biologically possible &#x27;equality&#x27; for human beings was &quot;an organic, physiological equality conditioned by the same education and common living conditions&quot; and he saw this as the supreme goal of all historical and social progress.

===As prophecy===
Kjetsaa claims that Dostoevsky did not regard &quot;Revelation&quot; as &quot;merely a consolatory epistle to first century Christians during the persecution they suffered&quot;, but as a &quot;prophecy being fulfilled in his own time&quot;. Dostoevsky wrote that &quot;Communism will conquer one day, irrespective of whether the Communists are right or wrong. But this triumph will stand very far from the Kingdom of Heaven. All the same, we must accept that this triumph will come one day, even though none of those who at present steer the world&#x27;s fate have any idea about it at all.&quot;

Since the Russian Revolution, many commentators have remarked on the prophetic nature of &quot;Demons&quot;. André Gide, writing in the early 1920s, suggested that &quot;the whole of (the novel) prophesies the revolution of which Russia is presently in the throes&quot;. In Soviet Russia, a number of dissident authors found a prototype for the Soviet police state in the system expounded by Shigalev at the meeting of Pyotr Verkhovensky&#x27;s revolutionary society. Boris Pasternak, Igor Shafarevich, and Alexander Solzhenitsyn, have called Dostoevsky&#x27;s description of Shigalevism prophetic, anticipating the systematic politicide which followed the October Revolution. Pasternak often used the term &quot;Shigalevism&quot; (&quot;shigalevshchina&quot;) to refer to Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge. According to Richard Pevear, Dostoevsky even presaged the appearance of Lenin himself with his description of the final reader at the ill-fated literary gala: &quot;a man of about forty, bald front and back, with a grayish little beard, who...keeps raising his fist over his head and bringing it down as if crushing some adversary to dust.&quot;

Dostoevsky biographer Ronald Hingley described the novel as &quot;an awesome, prophetic warning which humanity, no less possessed of collective and individual devilry in the 1970s than in the 1870s, shows alarmingly few signs of heeding.&quot; Robert L. Belknap notes its relevance to the twentieth century in general, &quot;when a few Stavrogins empowered thousands of Pyotr Stepanovichs to drive herds of &#x27;capital&#x27;, to use Nechayev&#x27;s term, to slaughter about a hundred million people, the very number Shigalyev and Pyotr hit upon.&quot; In his book &quot;Dostoyevsky in Manhattan&quot; French philosopher André Glucksmann argued that &#x27;nihilism&#x27;, as depicted in &quot;Demons&quot;, is the underlying idea or &#x27;characteristic form&#x27; of modern terrorism.

<text>John Stanley Plaskett (November 17, 1865 – October 17, 1941) was a Canadian astronomer.

== Career ==
He worked as a machinist, and was offered a job as a mechanician at the Department of Physics at the University of Toronto, constructing apparatus and assisting with demonstrations during lectures. He found this so interesting that at the age of 30 he enrolled as an undergraduate in mathematics and physics. He stayed at the university until 1903, doing research on color photography.

His formal astronomical career did not start until 1903, when he was appointed to the staff at Dominion Observatory in Ottawa, Ontario. He measured radial velocities and studied spectroscopic binaries, and performed the first detailed analysis of galactic structure. His mechanical background was very useful for constructing various instruments. He became first director of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria, British Columbia in 1917 (not to be confused with the old Dominion Observatory in Ottawa).
== Family and legacy ==
His son, Harry Hemley Plaskett, also pursued a very successful career in astronomy, winning the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1963, thereby making the Plasketts one of the very few families to boast more than one Medal winner.
An authoritative biography of JS Plaskett was published in 2018, coinciding with the centennial of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory.

<doc id="796013" wikidata="Q632376" url="?curid=796013" title="Archaic period (North America)">
<text>In the classification of the archaeological cultures of North America, the Archaic period in North America, taken to last from around 8000 to 1000 BC in the sequence of North American pre-Columbian cultural stages, is a period defined by the &quot;archaic stage&quot; of cultural development. The Archaic stage is characterized by subsistence economies supported through the exploitation of nuts, seeds, and shellfish. As its ending is defined by the adoption of sedentary farming, this date can vary significantly across the Americas.

The rest of the Americas also have an Archaic Period.

==Classifications==
This classification system was first proposed by Gordon Willey and Philip Phillips in the widely accepted 1958 book &quot;Method and Theory in American Archaeology&quot;.

In the organization of the system, the Archaic period followed the Lithic stage and is superseded by the Formative stage.
# The Lithic stage
# The Archaic stage
# The Formative stage
# The Classic stage
# The Post-Classic stage

Numerous local variations have been identified within the cultural rankings. The period has been subdivided by region and then time. For instance, the Archaic Southwest tradition is subdivided into the San Dieguito–Pinto, Oshara, Cochise and Chihuahua cultures.

==Archaic stage in North America==
Since the 1990s, secure dating of multiple Middle Archaic sites in northern Louisiana, Mississippi and Florida has challenged traditional models of development. In these areas, hunter-gatherer societies in the Lower Mississippi Valley organized to build monumental earthwork mound complexes as early as 3500 BC (confirmed at Watson Brake), with building continuing over a period of 500 years. Early mound sites such as Frenchman&#x27;s Bend and Hedgepeth were of this time period; all were constructed by localized societies. Watson Brake is now considered to be the oldest mound complex in the Americas. It precedes that built at Poverty Point by nearly 2,000 years (both are in northern Louisiana). More than 100 sites have been identified as associated with the regional Poverty Point culture of the Late Archaic period, and it was part of a regional trading network across the Southeast.

Across the Southeastern Woodlands, starting around 4000 BC, people exploited wetland resources, creating large shell middens. Middens developed where the people lived along rivers, but there is limited evidence of Archaic peoples along the coastlines prior to 3000 BC. Archaic sites on the coast may have been inundated by rising sea levels (one site in 15 to 20 feet of water off St. Lucie County, Florida, has been dated to 2800 BC). Starting around 3000 BC, evidence of large-scale exploitation of oysters appears. During the period 3000 BC to 1000 BC, shell rings, large shell middens that more or less surround open centers, were developed along the coast. These shell rings are numerous in South Carolina and Georgia but are also found scattered around the Florida Peninsula and along the Gulf of Mexico coast as far west as the Pearl River. In some places, such as Horr&#x27;s Island in Southwest Florida, resources were rich enough to support sizable mound-building communities year-round. Four shell or sand mounds on Horr&#x27;s Island have been dated to between 2900 and 2300 BC.

==Timeline==

* 1000 BC: Pottery making widespread in the Eastern woodlands.

==Shield Archaic==
The Shield Archaic was a distinct regional tradition which existed during the climatic optimum, starting around 6,500 years ago. During this warm period, forests advanced northward and temperatures were warmer than they were in the late 20th century. It is associated with the northern frontier and transition area between boreal forest and tundra in what is now northern Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories, near Lake Athabasca. However, the Late Shield Archaic phase (3,500–4,450 BP) has sites as far as Manitoba, and archaeologists have investigated suspected Shield Archaic sites as far away as Killarney Provincial Park near Georgian Bay in Ontario.

The prominent Canadian archaeologist J. V. Wright argued in 1976 that the Shield Archaic had emerged from the Northern Plano tradition, but this was questioned by Bryan C. Gordon in a 1996 publication. Shield Archaic tools differed in design between &quot;forest&quot; and &quot;tundra&quot; sites. Pushplanes have been found, which would have been used for planing wood, bone, or antler. Shield Archaic people hunted caribou, with a focus on water crossings as hunting places.

<doc id="796015" wikidata="Q7867002" url="?curid=796015" title="USS Achernar">
<text>USS &quot;Achernar&quot; (AKA-53) was an attack cargo ship (a cargo ship designed to support amphibious warfare operations) of the United States Navy during World War II and after.

For the invasion of Normandy it was the command post of General Omar Bradley, commander of the US First Army.

She served as a commissioned ship for 19 years and 5 months.

==Construction==
She was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract on 6 September 1943 at Kearney, New Jersey by Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Co., launched on 3 December 1943, named after the star Achernar, sponsored by Mrs. Adela Rogers St. Johns, acquired by the Navy on 29 January 1944, and commissioned on 31 January 1944.

==World War II service==
Following conversion and fitting out at the New York Navy Yard, &quot;Achernar&quot; held shakedown in the Chesapeake Bay. On 13 March, she arrived at Staten Island, New York – where she loaded cargo and embarked United States Army personnel for transportation to Britain travelling with Convoy CU-18. She arrived at Swansea, Wales on 30 March and spent the next two months transporting cargo and personnel between various ports in the United Kingdom in preparation for the Normandy invasion.

On 1 June 1944, she was designated as First Army&#x27;s headquarters ship. On 6 June, she steamed from Plymouth across the English Channel and anchored in her preassigned position in Baie de la Seine, France. For the next few days, she acted as a nerve center for troops fighting for a foothold in France. On 11 June, the First Army&#x27;s headquarters disembarked, and &quot;Achernar&quot; returned to England. After a three-day respite in Plymouth, the ship moved to Rosneath, Scotland to take on the cargo and personnel of two construction battalions. On 19 June, she returned to Plymouth to load materials to repair damaged assault craft and, on 22 June, got underway for the assault area in France. While on station, she underwent several enemy air attacks. &quot;Achernar&quot; left France on 29 June to return to England and arrived in Plymouth on 1 July. On 5 July, the ship was ordered to sail as a part of Task Group 120.6, which was bound for the Mediterranean Sea to support the invasion of southern France. It arrived at Oran, Algeria on 10 July; then six days later sailed to Naples. After loading cargo there, she moved to an anchorage at Castellammare, Italy on 2 August. Here, she embarked personnel of the 36th Infantry Division and proceeded to sea on 13 August for the landings in southern France. On the morning of 15 August, her crew commenced discharging her cargo and sending it to the beaches. The next day, after finishing the delivery of cargo, she received casualties on board and embarked 13 German prisoners of war before getting underway to return to Naples.

For the next two months, &quot;Achernar&quot; continued making trips from Naples and Oran to points along the southern coast of France. On 25 October, she sailed from Oran westward through the Strait of Gibraltar towards the United States. She arrived at Hampton Roads on 8 November and underwent repairs and overhaul at the Norfolk Navy Yard. On 7 December, &quot;Achernar&quot; got underway for a brief period of trials and exercises in Chesapeake Bay. The ship returned to Norfolk on 11 December, took on cargo, and got underway on 18 December. She transited the Panama Canal on Christmas Day 1944 and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 10 January 1945.

Following tactical maneuvers off Oahu from 17 to 19 January, the cargo ship began loading cargo on 12 February and put to sea on 18 February. &quot;Achernar&quot; stopped at Eniwetok on 26 February, Kossol Roads on 4 March, and anchored in San Pedro Bay, Philippine Islands, from 15 to 20 March, before arriving off Okinawa on 1 April to support the seizure of that key island. At 0043 the next day, a Japanese suicide plane hit the starboard side; and, almost simultaneously, a bomb exploded on her port side. Fires broke out, and the ship began listing slightly to port. &quot;Achernar&quot; lost five crew members killed and 41 injured.

By 0100, the fires were out and the list had been corrected. At 1525, &quot;Achernar&quot; transferred her casualties to and proceeded to anchor off Hagushi beach, where temporary repairs began. On the morning of 3 April, &quot;Achernar&quot; moved to Kerama Retto to begin unloading her cargo. She remained at Okinawa until 19 April, when she sailed for the United States via Ulithi and Pearl Harbor. The vessel arrived at San Francisco on 13 May and began offloading ammunition and fuel. Two days later, she entered drydock for repairs and overhaul. She got underway again on 10 July for shakedown along the California coast. On 4 August, &quot;Achernar&quot; left San Francisco to return to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived a week later and immediately began discharging her cargo. She was still in Hawaii when hostilities ended on 15 August. &quot;Achernar&quot; then shuttled personnel and equipment between Japan, various other Pacific islands, and took part in &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; operations, returning veterans to the United States.

On 28 November, &quot;Achernar&quot; arrived in Seattle, Washington. One week later, SS &quot;H. H. Raymond&quot; collided with her during a storm. As a result of the damage she sustained in the accident, &quot;Achernar&quot; entered dry dock on 22 December for repairs. &quot;Achernar&quot; got underway again on 16 January 1946 and resumed operations between the west coast and various ports in the Far East and the Pacific. AKA 53 made two trips to the Pribiloff Islands bringing back to Seattle fur seal pelts and products for a Fouck Fur Company of Saint Louis. In 1947 she made a trip to the Philippines, Japan and China. Subic Bay, Yokuska, Shanghai, Tsingtao were visited but a scheduled visit to Tiensen was curtailed because of fighting between the Nationals and the Communists in 1947.

==Korean War service==
When the Military Sea Transportation Service was formed on 1 October 1949, she was one of a group of attack cargo ships selected for service in the new organization. At the outbreak of the Korean War, &quot;Achernar&quot; was completing overhaul at the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard. She got underway on 7 July 1950 and soon began onloading troops and cargo for transportation to the war zone. On 14 July, the ship joined TG 53.7 and sailed for Japan. She unloaded her cargo at Kobe, Sasebo, and Yokosuka. On 22 September, she left Japan and proceeded to Inchon, Korea, to support nearby ground operations.

After American forces had liberated the territory near Inchon and Seoul, elements of the 1st Marine Division and their equipment were loaded on board &quot;Achernar&quot; for landing on the east coast of Korea at Wonsan. She sailed as part of TG 90.2 and arrived in Wonsan on 25 October. She unloaded her passengers and proceeded to Moji, Japan, arriving there on 31 October. There, she took on men of the 2nd Infantry Division for transportation to Wonsan. Following this mission, she returned to Yokosuka on 20 November.

The attack cargo ship was then ordered to report back to the United States. She left Japan on 27 November accompanying the destroyers and – both of which had been damaged by naval mines – ready to assist them, if necessary. They made brief stops at Midway and Pearl Harbor before reaching San Francisco on 17 December.

Following a short availability period, &quot;Achernar&quot; went to Port Hueneme, California on 18 January 1951 to onload cargo and personnel for transportation to the Aleutians. After unloading at Amchitka, she visited Adak, Whittier, Alaska, and Kodiak Island to pick up cargo to be returned to Seattle. On 17 March, &quot;Achernar&quot; set course for Norfolk. She transited the Panama Canal on 26 March; paused at Morehead City, North Carolina on 1 April; and finally arrived at Norfolk on 3 April. The ship was assigned to the Amphibious Force, Atlantic Fleet, and took part in various fleet exercises and cargo runs in the Caribbean and along the east coast. On 18 February 1956, &quot;Achernar&quot; was decommissioned, placed in reserve, and berthed at Orange, Texas.

==Later service and decommissioning==
&quot;Achernar&quot; was placed back in commission at New Orleans on 1 September 1961. She arrived at Norfolk on 1 December 1961 and became a unit of Amphibious Squadron 6, Atlantic Fleet. &quot;Achernar&quot; held shakedown in the Caribbean and spent the remainder of her career conducting various training exercises in the Virginia capes operating area.

&quot;Achernar&quot; was again placed out of commission on 1 July 1963 and transferred to the Maritime Administration. She was reacquired by the Navy on 29 January 1964 but saw no active service before she was transferred to the government of Spain on 2 February 1965. She served the Spanish Navy as &quot;Castilla&quot; (TA-21) until scrapped in 1982.

&quot;Achernar&quot; received three battle stars for World War II service and three battle stars for Korean War service.

<text>Mehboob Khan Ramzan Khan (9 September 1907 – 28 May 1964) was a prominent Indian film director and producer. He is best known for directing the social epic &quot;Mother India&quot; (1957), which won the Filmfare Awards for Best Film and Best Director, two National Film Awards, and was a nominee for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. He set up his production company – Mehboob Productions, and later a film studio – Mehboob Studios in Bandra, Mumbai in 1954. He also created the dacoit film genre with &quot;Aurat&quot; (1940) and &quot;Mother India&quot;, and is also known for other blockbusters including the romantic drama (1949), the swashbuckling musical &quot;Aan&quot; (1951), and the melodrama &quot;Amar&quot; (1954).

== Early life ==
Khan was born Mehboob Khan Ramzan Khan in Bilimora in Gandevi Taluka of Surat State (now Gujarat) on 9 September 1907.

== Career ==
He was brought to Bombay from his home town in Gujarat by Noor Muhammad Ali Muhammed Shipra Baddhiyawala (producer and horse supplier in Indian cinema) to work as a horseshoe repairer in a stable (owned by Noor Muhammad Ali Muhammed Shipra Baddhiyawala). One day at the shooting of South Indian director Chandrashekhar, Mehboob showed interest in working with Chandrashekhar. After seeing his great interest and skills, Chandrashekhar asked Noor Muhammad Ali Muhammed Shipra Baddhiyawala to allow him to take Mehboob with him to work at small jobs in the film studios of Bombay. He started as an assistant director in the Silent Film era and as an extra in the studios of the Imperial Film Company of Ardeshir Irani, before directing his first film &quot;Al Hilal&quot; a.k.a. &quot;Judgement of Allah&quot; (1935), when he started directing films for the &quot;Sagar Film Company&quot;. Notable films he directed for Sagar Movietone and National Studios included &quot;Deccan Queen&quot; (1936), &quot;Ek Hi Raasta&quot; (1939), &quot;Alibaba&quot; (1940), &quot;Aurat&quot; (1940) and &quot;Bahen&quot; (1941).

In 1945, Khan set up his own production house – Mehboob Productions. In 1946, he directed the musical hit , which featured singing stars Surendra, Noor Jehan and Suraiya in leading roles. Khan went on to produce and direct many blockbuster films, the most notable being the romantic drama (1949), the swashbuckling musical &quot;Aan&quot; (1951), the melodrama &quot;Amar&quot; (1954), and the social epic &quot;Mother India&quot; (1957). The latter was a remake of his 1940 film &quot;Aurat&quot; and was nominated for an Academy Award in 1957. His earlier works were in Urdu, but his later material, including &quot;Mother India&quot;, were in Hindustani, a friendlier and softer spoken version of Hindi and Urdu. Several of his films, especially his earlier work on &quot;Humayun&quot; (1945), the story of a Mogul emperor who ruled India, (1946), and &quot;Taqdeer&quot; (in which he introduced Nargis, who later married Sunil Dutt), were written by Aghajani Kashmeri. Kashmeri was responsible for picking and training Nargis in Hindustani and Urdu dialogue delivery. His last film as a director was 1962&#x27;s &quot;Son of India&quot;.
He died of a heart attack in 1964 at the age of 56 and was buried at Badakabarastan in Marine Lines, Mumbai. His death occurred the day after the death of Jawaharlal Nehru, the Prime Minister of India.

== Industry influence ==
Khan introduced and helped establish the careers of many actors and actresses who went on to become big stars in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s such as Surendra, Arun Kumar Ahuja, Dilip Kumar, Raj Kapoor, Sunil Dutt, Rajendra Kumar, Raaj Kumar, Nargis, Nimmi and Nadira. In 1961, he was a member of the jury at the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival. He remained the president of the Film Federation of India.

Mehboob Khan was known for having been influenced by Hollywood, and his films often featured lavish sets in the style of the Hollywood at that time. The oppression of the poor, class warfare and rural life are recurring themes in his work.

Mehboob Khan was awarded the title of &quot;Hidayat Kar-e-Azam&quot; by the Indian government.

== Personal life ==
Mehboob Khan married twice. With his first wife Fatima, he had three sons: Ayub, Iqbal and Shaukat. After separation from his first wife, he married the famous Indian film actress Sardar Akhtar (1915–1986) in 1942. He adopted Sajid Khan (born 28 December 1951), who has starred in Indian and foreign English films.

==Death and legacy ==
Mehboob Khan died of a heart attack on 28 May 1964.
As a part of his birth centenary celebrations, the Indian postal department released a commemorative stamp of Mehboob Khan at a function held at the Mehboob Studios in September 2007.

<text>William Howard Shuster Jr. (1893–1969) was an American painter, sculptor and teacher. 

== Youth ==

Shuster was born November 26, 1893, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as the second of three children. 

He served in the U.S. Army during World War I in France, where he developed tuberculosis after being gassed. He would receive a disability pension thereafter.

== New Mexico ==

In 1920, Shuster moved to New Mexico to improve his health and became friends with the small but growing arts community. Shuster made money doing ironwork and painting to supplement the pension. In 1921, he became a member of Los Cinco Pintores (&quot;the five painters&quot;), and showed throughout Santa Fe and the rest of the country with the group.

== Oeuvre ==

His artwork is in the permanent collections of the Stark Museum of Art, Brooklyn Museum, Delaware Art Museum, Newark Museum, and New Mexico Museum of Art.

<text>Otto Hermann Leopold Heckmann (June 23, 1901 – May 13, 1983) was a German mathematician and astronomer, director of the Hamburg Observatory from 1941 to 1962, after which he became the first director of the European Southern Observatory. He actively contributed to the creation of the third issue of the &quot;Astronomische Gesellschaft Katalog&quot;. He also contributed to cosmology based on the fundamentals of general relativity, and in 1942 wrote the book &quot;Theorien der Kosmologie&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Otto Heckmann was born to Agnes Heckmann, née Grüter and Max Heckmann,a notary, a Catholic family in Opladen in 1901. He studied mathematics, physics, and astronomy at the University of Bonn. He wrote a thesis in astrometry under Karl Friedrich Küstner about a star cluster in Praesepe and received a doctorate in 1925. He married in 1925 and worked for two years in the Bonn Observatory with Küstner, who was involved in the planning of star catalog Astronomische Gesellschaft Katalog 2 of the Northern Hemisphere.

==Career==
In 1927 Heckmann was appointed to the faculty of the University of Göttingen and worked in the Göttingen Observatory under Hans Kienle. In 1929, Heckmann obtained his habilitation of astrometry in the star group Coma Berenices. 

===1933–1945 ===
After Adolf Hitler had come to power in 1933, at least 48 colleagues in the science faculty at Göttingen were driven into exile because of their religious, or more rarely political beliefs (Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums, 7 April 1933), amongst them Max Born. Heckmann was tasked to continue Born s lectures in optics and asked Born to give him his lecture notes, which Born refused.
Heckmann initially thought that he could survive the system by retreating into science alone.
In September 1933, the local NSDAP judged Heckmann as &quot;long time member of the leftist wing of the Catholic Zentrumspartei, unreliable and pro-Jewish (judenfreundlich)&quot;. In 1934, 3 professors from Frankfurt tried to recruit him, but were thwarted by the denuciation of Karl Boda, a competitor. Likewise, in 1934 Walther Gerlach (1889-1979) suggested he come to München, but a Nazi official (Gaudozentenbundsführer Wilhelm Führer) and a member of the Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund turned him down. Heckman probably would not have had any opportunities in academia if he had not taken steps to change the assessment of the local Nazi representatives. And due to his high specialization, Heckmann found himself without professional alternatives, such as industry. In 1934, Heckmann joined the NS-Fliegerkorps, attended Wehrsportlager in Borna near Leipzig, the Dozentenakademie in Kiel-Buchenhagen. He signed the &quot;Vow of allegiance of the Professors of the German Universities and High-Schools to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialistic State&quot;. On July 10, 1934, he joined the Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt. Starting 1935, the Nazi representatives evaluated him as more adapted and conforming to the system. In December 1936, he was urged to apply for the position vacated by Erwin Finlay Freundlich at the University of Istanbul, a highly political position serving military interests (observation of the sun’s surface for solar flares resulting in interference with radio communications on Earth), but eventually Hans Oswald Rosenberg was chosen.

Until 1935, Heckmann measured star colors in the red and blue spectrum with photometry with a telescope costing &quot;two years of painstaking adjustment until it began working properly&quot;. In 1935, he received the honorary title of professor. After 1937 they used a Schmidt telescope with an aperture of about 38 centimeters.

In the fall of 1937 the Hamburg University faculty finally called on Heckmann, after having been obstructed for years by the Government of the Reich, and by various agencies within the Nazi Party. On May 1st, 1937 Heckmann joined the Nazi Party, encouraged by Werner Heisenberg in order to thwart members of Deutsche Physik to occupy teaching positions. However in 1938, the leader of the Reichsdozentenbund (an association of government lecturers dominated by the Nazis), refused to permit Heckmann to occupy the position arguing most of his publications were co-authored and his solo-authored publications on relativity theory represented a Jewish world view. In 1938, Heckmann participated in ideological instruction at the &quot;Reichslager für Beamte&quot; in Bad Tölz. The appointment to Hamburg was delayed until April 1941. Finally, in 1941, Heckmann left Göttingen to direct the Hamburg Observatory, Bergedorf.
After 14 years of being an extraordinary professor (assistant), he finally became officially appointed a full professor and civil servant in January 1942.

===1945–1969===
After WWII, Heckmann worked on the establishment of a joint European Southern Observatory (ESO) in South Africa. In the 1950s he supervised the thesis of Jürgen Stock (astronomer), who eventually went on to search for and established an observatory site for the University of Chicago in Chile, after which the ESO founded their centre in Chile as well. Heckmann retired from the directorship of Hamburg Observatory in 1962. 

From 1962 to 1969 he served as the first director general of the European Southern Observatory.

==Later life==
After mandatory retirement from the University in 1969, he served as President of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) from 1967-1970. Charles Fehrenbach (astronomer) called him the work horse of the IAU.

Following a Polish request and under the impression of German acts in Poland during World War II, he made the controversial decision to hold an Extraordinary IAU General Assembly in February 1973 in Warsaw, Poland, to commemorate the 500th anniversary of Nicolaus Copernicus, shortly after the regular 1973 GA had been held in Australia.

==Personal life==
He married Johanna Topfmeier in 1925 and they had three children together: Klaus, Hildegard and Ulrike. 
He died 3 May 1983 in a Göttingen retirement home.

==Legacy==
The asteroid 1650 Heckmann is named after him.

<text>U.S. Postal Service Pro Cycling Team was a United States–based professional road bicycle racing team. On June 15, 2004, the Discovery Channel signed a deal to become sponsor of the team for the 2004–2007 seasons and its name changed to Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team (). From 2005 until 2007, the team was one of the 20 teams that competed in the new UCI ProTour. As part of the sponsorship deal, Lance Armstrong, the team&#x27;s undisputed leader, provided on-air appearances for the Discovery Networks TV channels. The deal did not affect the rights of secondary sponsor OLN, later known as NBCSN in the US, to air major cycling events such as the Tour de France, although the two channels are competitors.

The team was directed by Belgian Johan Bruyneel, who also managed U.S. Postal. The chief mechanic was Julien DeVries. The team was co-owned by Tailwind Sports Corp. of San Francisco and Capital Sports &amp; Entertainment of Austin, Texas. On February 10, 2007, Discovery Channel announced that it would not renew its sponsorship of the team at the end of the 2007 season. On August 10, 2007, the cycling team announced that it would not search for a new sponsor, but cease operations and disband at the end of the 2007 season.

In October 2012 USADA released a report saying that the team had run &quot;the most sophisticated, professionalised and successful doping programme the sport has ever seen&quot;. The report contained affidavits from eleven riders on the team including Frankie Andreu, Tyler Hamilton, George Hincapie, Floyd Landis, Levi Leipheimer, and others, describing their own usage of erythropoietin (EPO), blood transfusion, testosterone, and other banned practices during the Tour de France and other races. They also implicated seven-time Tour winner, Lance Armstrong. On October 22, 2012, the UCI upheld the USADA&#x27;s recommendation to strip Armstrong of all results since August 1, 1998, and ban him from cycling for life. In February 2013, the US government joined Landis&#x27; False Claims Act lawsuit against Armstrong, alleging that Armstrong had defrauded the US Postal Service of sponsorship funds by violating cycling rules by using performance-enhancing drugs while riding for the team.

==Team rosters==

===Final season===
On August 10, 2007, Tailwind Sports announced the end of the Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team. Tailwind officials stopped their search for a new title sponsor for the Discovery team, citing the current tumultuous conditions within the sport of cycling.
 Team operations continued until the end of the 2007 season.

After the 2007 season Johan Bruyneel went to rebuild Team Astana for the 2008 season. He brought with him much of Discovery&#x27;s personnel, such as riders Alberto Contador, Levi Leipheimer, Yaroslav Popovych, Tomas Vaitkus, and coach Sean Yates.

The 2007 U.S. national road champion George Hincapie signed a contract for the 2008 season Team High Road, later known as Team HTC–Columbia, run by the American Bob Stapleton.

== U.S. Postal Service Pro Cycling Team history ==

The US Postal Service Pro Cycling Team and later named the US Postal Service Pro Cycling Team presented by Berry Floor operated from 1996 through 2004. The United States Postal Service was the title (primary) sponsor from 1996 through 2004 and the team was nicknamed the &quot;Blue Train&quot;. Berry Floor, a Belgian flooring company, was the secondary sponsor, also known as a Presenting Sponsor. Domestically the USPS Pro Cycling Team was presented by Alloc, the American subsidiary of Berry Floor.

Lance Armstrong won six Tours de France (1999–2004) (that were later stripped) with US Postal, and in 2003 Roberto Heras—at that time a US Postal rider—won the Vuelta a España. Armstrong went on to win a seventh Tour de France in 2005 (that was later also stripped), after the USPS contract and sponsorship ended.

The US Postal Service announced that it would cease sponsorship at the end of the 2004 racing season when its eight-year contract expired. It had previously been under fire for the expenditure from organizations such as Postal Watch, a website critical of the United States Postal Service. Legitimate problems of mismanagement and sloppy accounting were pointed out by the Postal Service itself, via the USPS Office of the Inspector General. Before the expiration of the USPS contract, Armstrong insisted that he would only continue to ride with the USPS team structure. This demand was met on June 15, 2004, when Discovery Networks stepped in and agreed to sponsor the team for the next three years as the Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team.

=== 1996 results ===
With the help of Thomas Weisel and Eddie Borysewicz, the United States Postal Service begins its reign as title sponsor to what has become the most successful cycling team from the United States. Borysewicz served as the team&#x27;s directeur sportif and the team raced mainly in domestic events in the United States.

=== 1997 results ===
Thomas Weisel brought in Mark Gorski, the 1984 Olympic Gold Medalist in the Men&#x27;s 1000 m Sprint (Scratch) event, as team manager. Due in large part to Russian Viatcheslav Ekimov and his key stage wins at Paris–Nice and the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré, the USPS squad got its first invitation to ride in the Tour de France.

=== 1998 results ===

Lance Armstrong joined the US Postal team in late 1997, when returning to professional cycling following his cancer treatments.

=== 1999 results ===
=== 2000 results ===
=== 2001 results ===
In 2001, the U.S. Postal Service Pro Cycling Team was named the USOC Team of the Year. Also, Armstrong was named USOC SportsMan of the Year, which he also won in 1999.

<text>The Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany (),
more commonly referred to as the Two Plus Four Agreement (),
is an international agreement that allowed the reunification of Germany in October 1990. It was negotiated in 1990 between the &#x27;two&#x27;, the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, in addition to the Four Powers which had occupied Germany at the end of World War II in Europe: France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The treaty supplanted the 1945 Potsdam Agreement: in it, the Four Powers renounced all rights they had held with regard to Germany, allowing for its reunification as a fully sovereign state the following year. Additionally, the two German states agreed to reconfirm the existing border with Poland in the German–Polish Border Treaty, accepting that German territory post-reunification would consist only of what was presently administered by West and East Germany—renouncing explicitly any possible claims to the former eastern territories of Germany including East Prussia, most of Silesia, as well as the eastern parts of Brandenburg and Pomerania.

== Background ==

On 1 August 1945, the Potsdam Agreement, promulgated in the Potsdam Conference, among other things agreed on the initial terms under which the Allies of World War II would govern Germany. A provisional German–Polish border known as the Oder–Neisse line awarded, in theory within the context of that &quot;provisional border&quot;, most of Germany&#x27;s former eastern provinces to Poland and the Soviet Union. The German populations of these areas either fled or were expelled. Although the German Democratic Republic formally accepted the border in the 1950 Treaty of Zgorzelec with Poland, West Germany initially entirely rejected it, declaring the treaty &quot;null and void&quot; in line with the Hallstein Doctrine, and later reluctantly recognised the border in the 1970 Treaty of Warsaw as provisional only, to be finalised by &quot;a peace settlement for Germany to be accepted by the Government of Germany when a government adequate for the purpose is established&quot; (Potsdam Agreement 1.3.1). The overall &quot;German Question&quot; became one of the salient and crucial issues of the long-running Cold War, and until it ended in the late 1980s, little progress had been made in the establishment of a single government of Germany adequate for the purpose of agreeing to a final settlement. This meant that in some respects (largely, but not entirely, technical), Germany did not have full national sovereignty.

Several developments in 1989 and 1990, collectively termed and the Peaceful Revolution, led to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the SED party in East Germany (GDR). 
In a 9 February 1990 conversation with Mikhail Gorbachev held in Moscow, US Secretary of State James Baker argued in favor of holding the Two-Plus-Four talks. According to Moscow as well as Baker&#x27;s notes, the famous &quot;not one inch eastward&quot; promise about NATO&#x27;s eastward expansion was made during this conversation.
The concession essentially meant that the western half of the unified Germany would be part of NATO but the eastern half would not. The US National Security Council pointed out that it would be unworkable, and the concession was later amended to state that NATO troops would not be stationed in East Germany.

On 18 March 1990, a national election was held in the GDR, leading to an alliance of parties that favored German reunification winning a plurality. To achieve unity and full sovereignty, both German states were willing to accept the terms of the Potsdam Agreement that affected Germany. On 31 August 1990, the FRG and GDR signed the Unification Treaty, which describes the manner and specifics of the GDR&#x27;s accession to the Federal Republic. It was then possible for all international parties to negotiate a final settlement.

== Treaty ==
The Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany was signed in Moscow on 12 September 1990, and paved the way for German reunification on 3 October 1990. Under the terms of the treaty, the Four Powers renounced all rights they formerly held in Germany, including those regarding the city of Berlin. Upon deposit of the last instrument of ratification, united Germany became fully sovereign on 15 March 1991.

=== Alliances ===
The treaty allows Germany to make and belong to alliances, without any foreign influence in its politics. However, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who became chancellor of the reunified Germany, made no secret that the enlarged Federal Republic would inherit the West German seats in NATO and the European Communities.

=== Military forces and nuclear weapons ===
All Soviet forces in Germany were to leave the country by the end of 1994. Before the Soviets withdrew, Germany would only deploy territorial defense units not integrated into the alliance structures. German forces in the rest of Germany were assigned to areas where Soviet troops were stationed. After the Soviets withdrew, the Germans could freely deploy troops in those areas, with the exception of nuclear weapons. For the duration of the Soviet presence, Allied troops would remain stationed in Berlin upon Germany&#x27;s request.

Germany undertook efforts to reduce its armed forces to no more than 370,000 personnel, no more than 345,000 of whom were to be in the Army and the Air Force. These limits would commence at the time that the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe would enter into force, and the treaty also took note that it was expected that the other participants in the negotiations would &quot;render their contribution to enhancing security and stability in Europe, including measures to limit personnel strengths&quot;. Germany also reaffirmed its renunciation of the manufacture, possession of, and control over nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, and in particular, that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty would continue to apply in full to the unified Germany (the Federal Republic of Germany). No foreign armed forces, nuclear weapons, or the carriers for nuclear weapons would be stationed or deployed in six states (the area of Berlin and the former East Germany), making them a permanent Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone. The German Army could deploy conventional weapons systems with nonconventional capabilities, provided that they were equipped and designed for a purely conventional role. Germany also agreed to use military force only in accordance with the United Nations Charter.

=== Future territorial claims ===
Another of the treaty&#x27;s important provisions was Germany&#x27;s confirmation of the by now internationally recognised border with Poland, and other territorial changes in Germany that had taken place since 1945, preventing any future claims to lost territory east of the Oder–Neisse line (see former eastern territories of Germany). The treaty defined the territory of a &#x27;united Germany&#x27; as being the territory of East Germany, West Germany, and Berlin, prohibiting Germany from making any future territorial claims. Germany also agreed to sign a separate treaty with Poland reaffirming the present common border, binding under international law, effectively relinquishing these territories to Poland. This was done on 14 November 1990, with the signing of the German–Polish Border Treaty. Furthermore, the Federal Republic was required by the treaty to amend its Basic Law so as to be constitutionally prohibited from accepting any application for incorporation into Germany from territories outside of East Germany, West Germany, and Berlin.

Although the treaty was signed by West and East Germany as separate sovereign states, it was subsequently ratified by the united Federal Republic of Germany.

== Implementation ==

===Russian withdrawal from Germany===
After the Soviet Union dissolved itself in December 1991, the command unit of the Soviet Group of Soviet Forces in Germany devolved to the Russian Federation. The German government subsequently recognized the Russian Federation&#x27;s claim to be the successor state of the Soviet Union, including the right to maintain troops in Germany until the end of 1994. However, with post-Soviet Russia facing severe economic hardship, President Boris Yeltsin ordered Russian troop deployment in Germany to be reduced to levels significantly below those permitted in the Treaty. The last Russian troops left Germany at the end of August 1994, four months before the treaty deadline.

===Bundeswehr after the treaty===
In the first decade of the 21st century, the Bundeswehr underwent a gradual transformation to a fully professional force. By 1 July 2011, the date on which Germany voluntarily suspended conscription, the Bundeswehr retained fewer than 250,000 active duty personnel – barely two thirds of the country&#x27;s treaty limit. The defence minister at the time, Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, said that a cut to 185,000 persons was on the horizon.

Russia and the Western countries signed in 1990 the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe and in 1991 the Energy Charter Treaty, establishing a multilateral framework for cross-border cooperation in the energy industry, principally the fossil fuel industry; Russia postponed ratification of the latter treaty, linking it to the adoption of the Energy Charter Treaty Transit Protocol. In 1994, the Budapest Memorandum was signed where Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States made security assurances to Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine, in return for handing over by these three countries of their post-Soviet nuclear arsenal. In 1997, NATO and Russia signed the Russia–NATO Founding Act, which stated that each country had a sovereign right to seek alliances. NATO ended up expanding to sixteen Eastern countries (apart from the GDR in 1990): Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland in 1999; Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia in 2004; Albania and Croatia in 2009; Montenegro in 2017; North Macedonia in 2020; Finland in 2023; and Sweden in 2024, five of them on the border with Russia.

Russia–NATO relations started to deteriorate rapidly following the Ukrainian Orange Revolution in 2004–2005. In December 2006, Russia indicated that the ratification of the Energy Charter Treaty was unlikely due to the provisions requiring third-party access to Russia&#x27;s pipelines. In 2007 Russia suspended its participation in the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. In 2008, the relations deteriorated further and became almost openly hostile, following the 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence from Russia&#x27;s ally Serbia and its partial recognition by the West, to which Russia responded in August 2008 with launching the Russo-Georgian War. On 20 August 2009, Russia officially informed the depository of the Energy Charter Treaty (the Government of Portugal) that it did not intend to become a contracting party to the treaty. On 1 April 2014, NATO unanimously decided to suspend all practical co-operation with the Russian Federation in response to the annexation of Crimea, but the NATO-Russia Council (NRC) was not suspended. In 2015, Russia entirely terminated its participation in the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. On 18 February 2017, Russia&#x27;s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov, said he supported the resumption of military cooperation with the NATO alliance. In late March 2017, the Council met in advance of a NATO Foreign Ministers conference in Brussels, Belgium. 

After the subsequent 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Founding Act has been considered by the NATO member states as definitively abrogated in its entirety by Russia, while the latter has been declared at the 2022 NATO Madrid summit &quot;a direct threat&quot; to Euro-Atlantic security. In the same year, Russia withdrew from the European Convention on Human Rights and was expelled from the Council of Europe.

=== Russian claims of unwritten assurances ===
The treaty does not mention NATO membership prospects of any other countries, as none of them has been a party to the treaty, while only four out of the fifteen NATO member states at the time have been parties to it. Some commentators, such as Stephen F. Cohen, as well as Mikhail Gorbachev in 2008, have advanced in later years the interpretation of a comment allegedly made by US Secretary of State, James Baker, to the effect that NATO would expand &quot;not one inch eastward&quot; in a unified Germany, as applying instead to Eastern Europe; neither has such a provision been included in the treaty, nor any of the parties has proposed or demanded its inclusion, and neither a recording nor written minutes of Baker&#x27;s comment exist. In 2014, Gorbachev said that the assurance only pertained to East Germany, and that the resulting agreement was upheld by NATO. His main aide in these negotiations, Eduard Shevardnadze, likewise agreed that NATO never made any such commitment regarding other countries in Eastern Europe, and that &quot;the question never came up&quot; in the talks on German reunification. That is presumably because all of the countries in question were still in the Warsaw Pact at the time and hosted large Soviet garrisons. Gorbachev and his successor, Boris Yeltsin, felt that NATO&#x27;s later acceptance of countries like Poland violated the spirit of the earlier agreements.

In December 2017, researchers Tom Blanton and Svetlana Savranskaya argued that declassified documents challenged this narrative. They commented:

They further said that,
In 2018, Hannes Adomeit disputed the conclusions by Blanton and Savranskaya, saying that those documents were already known, and that, 
Additionally, he stated that,

An analysis by Marc Trachtenberg in 2021 concluded that &quot;the Russian allegations are by no means baseless ... But the Soviets were not deliberately misled.&quot; In her 2021 book &quot;Not One Inch: America, Russia, and the Making of the Cold War Stalemate&quot;, Mary Elise Sarotte balanced out these different interpretations, concluding that Russian claims of betrayal are in fact untrue in law but have psychological truth.

On 18 February 2022, German magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; published an investigation of the British National Archives in which Joshua Shifrinson (Boston University) discovered a memo classified as &quot;secret&quot; dated 6 March 1991 (approximately five months after the 2+4 negotiations). The memo is about a meeting of the directors of the US, UK, French and West German foreign ministries in Bonn. According to the memo, Jürgen Chrobog, the Western German representative, stated that &quot;during the 2+4 negotiations we made it clear that we [Germany] would not expand NATO beyond the Elbe . We cannot therefore offer Poland and the others NATO membership.&quot; Klaus Wiegrefe says that Chrobog may have confused the Elbe for the Oder, to which NATO was supposed to extend upon German unification, that Bonn had never made it clear that NATO would not expand beyond the Elbe. According to , a German foreign minister at the time would never make a binding statement on behalf of NATO.

Russian claims of the alleged 1990 assurances on a non-expansion of NATO to Gorbachev were again raised on the occasions of the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation in 2014 and the 2021–2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis, during which the Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded a legal ban on Ukraine joining NATO, which both Ukraine and NATO refused, and the subsequent invasion of Ukraine by Russia. The invocation of this alleged non-expansion pledge was used by Russia to justify its open breach of the Budapest Memorandum but has been rebuffed by NATO.

Like the Midland Highway, it connects the major cities of Hobart and Launceston – however it takes a different route, via the north-eastern and eastern coasts of the state. The Highway also acts as a major commuter road to Hobart residents living on the eastern side of the Derwent River. The designation &quot;Tasman Highway&quot; arises from its location facing the Tasman Sea – named, like the state itself, after Abel Tasman. The highway is one of the longest in Tasmania – , with an average travelling time of 4 hours.

==Eastern Outlet==

The Eastern Outlet is a section of the Tasman Highway between Hobart and Sorell. As one of the city&#x27;s 3 major radial highways, the outlet connects traffic from the Hobart city centre with Hobart Airport and commuters on the eastern shore of the River Derwent as well as intrastate traffic on the east coast and Tasman Peninsula. With recorded Annual average daily traffic of 67,000, the Tasman Bridge is the busiest portion of the Eastern Outlet and the Tasman Highway as a whole.

===History===
In 1964, a comprehensive transport study of Hobart was undertaken, calling for the construction of a freeway to serve Hobart&#x27;s growing eastern suburbs. Prior to opening of the Tasman Bridge in 1964 traffic travelling between Hobart and the airport had to make use of the Hobart Bridge as well as Rosny Hill Road and Cambridge Road. Passing through the Meehan Range, this route was windy and entirely two-lane featuring at-grade intersections. The first section of the new Highway between Rosny Hill Road and Mornington opened in 1974 as it exists today and continued to the airport as three lanes in its current alignment. During the 1990s, the section of highway between Mornington and the airport was fully duplicated with funds from the federal government. In 2002, the Pitt Water bridge was replaced with a new bridge built beside the existing structure with the causeway widened. In 2012, Department of Infrastructure, Energy and Resources progressively installed variable speed limit signage between the airport and Hobart, citing the increased crashed rate on the road due to traffic and weather on the Meehan Range.

In 2022 the roundabout at Hobart Airport was replaced by a 5-way peanut-roundabout diamond intersection, allowing traffic on the Tasman Highway to flow over the intersection. The first stage of the Sorell Bypass was opened the same year, allowing traffic using the Arthur Highway to directly bypass Sorell instead of using Tasman Highway or Parsonage Place (to which was applied a 5-tonne limit, but the junction was earlier made into a roundabout). There is a reserve for Tasman Highway to bypass Sorell, going directly north at the current bypass towards William Street, but currently the traffic must use the old Arthur Highway intersection to exit Sorell.

===Future===

The Department of Infrastructure, Energy and Resources has outlined several concepts for the upgrading of the Eastern Outlet portion of the Tasman Highway – Both short and long term. These include;
*An upgrade of the highway at Montagu Bay, involving the addition of extra lanes and On/Off ramps between the East Derwent Highway and Rosny Hill Road, to provide safer passage of traffic travelling between these two Roads
*The upgrading of the Holyman Avenue Roundabout into the airport at Cambridge.
*The addition of On/Off Ramps at Gordons Hill Road at Rosny. 
*The State government recently purchased land at Cambridge on the northern boundary of Hobart Airport to facilitate the future duplication of the Tasman Highway to Sorell. Possible second bypass of Sorell.

Additionally, independent bodies and proponents of the Highway have also made proposals of their own, including:
*Building the Highway to limited access, dual carriageway standard between the Airport and Sorell.
*Capacity upgrades between the Hobart city centre and the Mornington interchange.

===Route===
The southern section of the Highway commences on the fringe of the Hobart Central Business District at the intersection with the Brooker Highway and the Davey/Macquarie couplet. Featuring between four and five lanes of traffic and utilizing a lane management system for peak hour traffic, the highway travels north along the western shore of the Derwent River, intersecting with the Domain Highway before preceding over the Tasman Bridge. On the eastern side of the Bridge there are two interchanges in close proximity; the East Derwent Highway intersects the highway immediately after the bridge via the Lindisfarne Interchange and within 500 metres there is an interchange connecting Rosny Hill Road. From Rosny Hill Road the Tasman Highway continues east as a fully grade separated, Limited access highway intersecting with the South Arm Highway at Mornington and concluding after the airport diamond interchange (formerly a complete roundabout). For the remaining from the Airport the highway features 2 lanes of traffic, and travels over Mcgees Bridge and the Sorell Causeway to Sorell.

==Sorell to St Helens==
The road to Orford remains at the national standard as a two-lane highway, albeit with only a few overtaking lanes along its distance. The remainder of the road to St Helens is two lane, with even fewer overtaking opportunities.
In places, the eastern coastal portion of the highway runs just metres from the Tasman Sea, making it the easternmost A road in Tasmania.

The Tasman Highway is marketed as &quot;East Coast Escape&quot; between St Helens and Orford, to fit in with Tasmania&#x27;s scheme of introducing tourist trails, a way of simplifying navigation of key tourist locations in Tasmania.

Prior to 1990, there was no coastal route between Falmouth and the Chain of Lagoons – one had to travel into and out of St Marys, both roads being steep grades. The bypass was officially opened on 2 December 1991, though motorists had been using the partially constructed road before its opening. Great care was taken during the construction to protect Aboriginal middens and the general environment.

==St Helens to Launceston==

At the Launceston end, the highway is a main road with traffic lights. Out of the city, it becomes an ordinary two-lane road through the mountains. It passes waterfalls and through timber and rainforest country.

The portion between Launceston and Scottsdale runs through the Sideling Range. There is a lookout which offers views of Scottsdale and its surrounds.

The highway also passes through several former mining towns.

<text>Prince Ivan Andreyevich Khovansky () was a Russian boyar who led the Streltsy during the Moscow Uprising of 1682, alternatively known as the Khovanshchina. His life was dramatized by Modest Mussorgsky in the opera called after the name of the uprising. Khovansky&#x27;s moniker, Tararui, derives from the old Russian word for &quot;chatterbox&quot;.

Khovansky came from the Lithuanian Gediminid dynasty, whose ancestors moved from Podolia to Moscow in 1408. He started his employment under Mikhail I as a stolnik. In 1650 he was sent to Tula to counter the raids of Crimean Tatars. In 1651–1654 he was governor in Vyazma, and in 1656 he was governor of Mogilev.

During the Russian-Polish-Swedish war he served as a voivod. In 1657 he blitzed a number of Swedes under Gdov. During the Russo-Polish War (1654–1667), he won the battle of Myadel on 8 February 1659. He was promoted to boyar on March 27, 1659. In January 1660 he attacked Brest and set it on fire. During the Copper Riot in Moscow on 25 July 1662 he dealt with insurgents and then led an investigation committee based in Kolomenskoe. In 1663 he was proclaimed a judge of the Yamskoi Prikaz. Between 1669–1678 he governed Pskov, Smolensk, and Novgorod. He was reputed as a dour and masterful manager who did not look kindly on local licentiousness and manners.

Upon Feodor III&#x27;s death in April 1682, taking advantage of his popularity among the Streltsy, Khovansky helped to dismiss the Miloslavsky family from power. He engineered the great Streltsy uprising (May 15 to May 17, 1682), during which their old and unpopular leader, Prince Mikhail Dolgorukov, was murdered and Khovansky named his successor. Thus, he became de facto Minister of War of Muscovite Russia. Wishing to secure the allegiance of the Streltsy, he announced total forgiveness to those who took part in the uprising.

Through the support of the Streltsy he established a dual-reign regime, the joint rule of Ivan V and Peter I, under the regency of their sister Sophia Alekseyevna. As he supported the Old Believers he organized in 1682 a schismatic demonstration and forced Patriarch Joachim to agree to a public debate with one of the Old Believer leaders, Nikita Pustosvyat. The patriarch refuted Pustosvyat&#x27;s arguments and the next day Sophia had Pustosvyat executed.

Relying on the Streltsy, Khovansky wielded enormous political influence and often interfered in the government affairs. In June 1682 he was appointed to lead the Prikaz of Judges. His uncommon arrogance and vanity alienated Sophia and her Miloslavsky relatives, while inducing jealousy on the part of other boyars.

Eventually, the rumours about Khovansky&#x27;s intention to assassinate the Tsar&#x27;s family and to usurp the throne prompted Sophia to evacuate Ivan V and Peter I from Moscow to Kolomenskoe and then to the St Savva monastery in Zvenigorod. In September a royal ukase declared Khovansky the mutineer and the patron of heretics, while the Boyar Duma had him sentenced to death. He was captured in Pushkino near Moscow and taken to Vozdvizhenskoe where he was beheaded together with his son.

When the news of Khovansky&#x27;s execution reached the Streltsy stationed in Moscow, they started a riot and seized the Kremlin, but the regent soon quelled the mutinous army and appointed Fyodor Shaklovity as their new leader.

<text>Jo Davidson (March 30, 1883 – January 2, 1952) was an American sculptor. Although he specialized in realistic, intense portrait busts, Davidson did not require his subjects to formally pose for him; rather, he observed and spoke with them. He worked primarily with clay, while the final products were typically cast in terra-cotta or bronze, or carved from marble.

==Background==

Davidson was born in New York City, where he was educated before going to work in the atelier of American sculptor Hermon Atkins MacNeil. He subsequently moved to Paris in 1907 to study sculpture at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts.
==Career==

===Art===
After returning to the United States, he was befriended by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, who purchased some of his work.

In 1911 Davidson secured his first solo gallery shows. In 1927 he was one of a dozen sculptors invited by the oilman E. W. Marland to compete for a commission for a &quot;Pioneer Woman&quot; statue in Ponca City. Each was paid a commission to produce a small model, and the dozen works were exhibited in major cities in the US. Davidson did not win the commission.

In 1934 Davidson won the National Academy of Design&#x27;s Maynard Prize. In 1944, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician. In 1947 the American Academy of Arts and Letters hosted a retrospective featuring nearly 200 of his works. In the summer of 1949, Davidson was one of 250 sculptors who exhibited in the 3rd Sculpture International held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

Among Davidson&#x27;s commissions are a design for a United States War Industries badge, a collection of pieces for the Government of France to commemorate the first victory of the &quot;Troupes de Marine,&quot; and bronze busts of the leaders of the First World War Allies. His portraits of world leaders and celebrated figures gained him international acclaim. He created statues of oilman and future governor E. W. Marland and his two adoptive grown children.

=== Politics ===

Davidson served as chairman of the Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions (ICCASP), a leftist-liberal group that supported the policies of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his re-election. In 1946 this group merged with the National Citizens Political Action Committee (NCPAC) to become the Progressive Citizens of America (PCA); Davidson became co-chairman (the other chairman being Dr. Frank Kingdon).

PCA struggled during tensions of the Cold War, with its members under suspicion by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) for leftist leanings. It worked for racial equality, economic justice and civil liberties. Important segments of the PCA became the base for Henry A. Wallace&#x27;s candidacy for U.S. President in 1948 on the Progressive Party ticket.

<text>was a Japanese astronomer noted for his contributions to celestial mechanics.

== Life and work ==

Hagihara graduated from Tokyo Imperial University with a degree in astronomy in 1921 and became an assistant professor of astronomy there two years later. In 1923 the Japanese government sent him abroad as a traveling scholar. Hagihara went to Cambridge University in England to study differential equations under the mathematician Henry Frederick Baker and relativity alongside Paul Dirac under the astrophysicist Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington. He was a visiting scholar in France, Germany, and the United States.

He returned to Japan in 1925 but left for the United States three years later to study the topology of dynamical systems at Harvard University under George David Birkhoff on a Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship.

Hagihara finished his studies at Harvard in 1929 and returned again to the University of Tokyo, where, in 1930, he completed a D.Sc. dissertation on the stability of satellite systems. In 1935, he published a paper showing that the trajectory of a test particle in the Schwarzschild metric can be expressed in terms of elliptic functions. For more than a decade after 1937, he investigated the distribution of electron velocities in planetary nebulae.

He was promoted to full professor at the University of Tokyo in 1935. From 1945 to 1957 he was the director of the Tokyo Astronomical Observatory and subsequently was a professor at Tohoku University (1957–1960) and president of Utsunomiya University (1961–1967). In 1961 he was elected vice-president of the International Astronomical Union and president of the IAU&#x27;s commission on celestial mechanics.

He retired from all of his official duties, except for the Japan Academy, in 1967 and devoted himself to writing his comprehensive five volume work, &quot;Celestial Mechanics&quot;, which was based on his lecture notes.

Hagihara was regarded as a quiet and cultured gentleman, an excellent teacher and a capable administrator.

He has pointed out the importance of the post-Newton models for celestial mechanics, namely that developed by Georgi Manev.

== Honors ==

<text>USS &quot;Achigan&quot; (YT/YTB-218) was a &quot;Cahto&quot;-class large harbor tug in the service of the United States Navy. A French-Canadian rendering of the word ashigan which, in Chippewa and Algonquian dialects, is the name of the smallmouth bass.

==Construction==
&quot;Achigan&quot; (YT-218) was laid down on 23 July 1943, at Ipswich, Massachusetts, by W. A. Robinson, Inc.; reclassified a large harbor tug YTB-218 on 15 May 1944; launched on 4 October 1944; and placed in service on 9 January 1945.

==Service history==
Assigned to the 4th Naval District, &quot;Achigan&quot; spent most of her naval career at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. On the afternoon of 8 January 1946, she sank at Philadelphia, as a result of a collision with . Later salvaged, the tug returned to service at Philadelphia, in mid-1947. &quot;Achigan&quot; served there until the summer of 1956, when she was transferred to the 6th Naval District. The meager record of her service indicates that the tug served in the 6th Naval District into 1957, and was disposed of later that year.

<doc id="796054" wikidata="Q1204253" url="?curid=796054" title="Yoyogi Park">
<text>is a park in Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan. It is located adjacent to Harajuku Station and Meiji Shrine in Yoyogikamizonochō. The park is a popular Tokyo destination, especially on Sundays when it is used as a gathering place for Japanese rock music fans, jugglers, comedians, martial arts clubs, cosplayers and other subculture and hobby groups. In spring, thousands of people visit the park to enjoy the cherry blossom during &quot;hanami&quot;. The landscaped park has picnic areas, bike paths, cycle rentals, public sport courts, and a dog run.

== History ==
Yoyogi Park stands on the site from where the first successful powered aircraft flight in Japan took place by Captain Yoshitoshi Tokugawa on 19 December 1910. The area later became an army parade ground. From September 1945, the site became a U.S. officers housing area known as Washington Heights during the Allied occupation of Japan.

The area was used for the 1964 Summer Olympics housing the main Olympic village and the Yoyogi National Gymnasium. The distinctive building, which was designed by Kenzo Tange, hosted swimming and diving, with an annex for basketball.

In 1967 most of the area north of the gymnasium complex and south of Meiji Shrine was absorbed by Yoyogi Park.

Tokyo&#x27;s failed bid to host the 2016 Summer Olympics included a proposal to redevelop Yoyogi Park. A new volleyball arena was to be built west of the Yoyogi National Gymnasium. It would have replaced a small stadium with a football and athletics arena. Yoyogi National Gymnasium later served as the venue for handball events during the 2020 Summer Olympics.

===2014 dengue fever cases===
In 2014, Tokyo experienced one of its worst dengue fever outbreaks in 100 years and the first recorded cases in 70 years, with nearly 200 confirmed cases. The first case was reported on August 27, 2014. Using gene sequencing techniques, scientists determined that the outbreak originated in Yoyogi Park. Dozens of visitors to the area contracted the disease, leading to the park&#x27;s closure on September 4. No further cases were discovered after September 18, and the park re-opened to the public on October 31.

<text>The National Library of Australia (NLA), formerly the Commonwealth National Library and Commonwealth Parliament Library, is the largest reference library in Australia, responsible under the terms of the &quot;National Library Act 1960&quot; for &quot;maintaining and developing a national collection of library material, including a comprehensive collection of library material relating to Australia and the Australian people&quot;, thus functioning as a national library. It is located in Parkes, Canberra, ACT.

Created in 1960 by the &quot;National Library Act&quot;, by the end of June 2019 its collection contained 7,717,579 items, with its manuscript material occupying of shelf space. The NLA also hosts and manages the Trove cultural heritage discovery service, which includes access to the Australian Web Archive and National edeposit (NED), a large collection of digitised newspapers, official documents, manuscripts and images, as well as born-digital material.

==History and foundation==
In 1901 the Commonwealth Parliament Library was established to serve the newly formed Federal Parliament of Australia. From its inception the Commonwealth Parliamentary Library was driven to development of a truly national collection. In 1907 the Joint Parliamentary Library Committee under the Chairmanship of the Speaker, Sir Frederick William Holder defined the objective of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Library in the following words:

The Library Committee is keeping before it the ideal of building up, for the time when Parliament shall be established in the Federal Capital, a great Public Library on the lines of the world-famed Library of Congress at Washington; such a library, indeed, as shall be worthy of the Australian Nation; the home of the literature, not of a State, or of a period, but of the world, and of all time.
From 1923, two forms of name were used concurrently: Commonwealth National Library and Commonwealth Parliament Library, to designate the national and parliamentary collections respectively.

In 1957 the Paton Committee recommended a National Library as an independent statutory body.

In 1960 the National Library of Australia was created by the &quot;National Library Act 1960&quot;, and each library became a separate entity.

==Building==

The original National Library building on Kings Avenue, Canberra was designed by Edwin Hubert Henderson (1885–1939), who was Chief Architect of the Commonwealth of Australia from 1929 to 1939, and built in 1934. Originally intended to be several wings, only one wing was completed, partly because of the advent of World War II. The 1957 Paton Committee reported that the accommodation was inadequate for a National Library. The building was used for the headquarters of the Canberra Public Library Service until its demolition in 1968, when it became the site of the Edmund Barton Building.

In 1963, prime minister Robert Menzies announced the near-completion of working plans for a new National Library building. The present library building was opened on 15 August 1968 by Prime Minister John Gorton. The building, situated in Parkes, was designed by the architectural firm of Bunning and Madden in the Late Twentieth Century Stripped Classical style. The foyer is decorated in marble, with stained-glass windows by Leonard French and three tapestries by Mathieu Matégot. A Tom Bass sculpture called &quot;Lintel Sculpture&quot; is installed over the entrance to the library.

The building was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004.

In 2004 the book &quot;A different view : the National Library of Australia and its building art&quot; was published which talked about the NLA building.

===Reading rooms===
The large National Library building is home to various reading rooms and collections. Usage of the reading rooms include speaking to expert staff, browsing the library&#x27;s reference collection and electronic journals, ebooks, indexes, and databases. The reading rooms also provide free internet and computer use, scanning, photocopying and printing, and the request and access of collection items. On the ground floor is the Main Reading Room — this is where the bulk of the Library&#x27;s Internet access terminals are located, and where wireless internet access is available. Services are also delivered on-site from the Newspaper &amp; Family History zone on the ground floor, the Special Collections Reading Room and the Petherick Reading Room on the 1st floor, and Asian Collections on level 3.

==Collections==

===Australian &amp; General Collection===
The library collects material produced by Australians, for Australians or about the Australian experience in all formats—not just printed works—books, serials, newspapers, maps, posters, music and printed ephemera—but also online publications and unpublished material such as manuscripts, pictures and oral histories. Hazel de Berg began recording Australian writers, artists, musicians and others in the Arts community in 1957. She conducted nearly 1300 interviews. Together with the library, she was a pioneer in the field in Australia, working together for twenty-seven years.

A core Australiana collection is that of John A. Ferguson. The library&#x27;s Australiana collections are the nation&#x27;s most important resource of materials recording Australia&#x27;s cultural heritage. The library has particular collection strengths in the performing arts, including dance.

The library contains a considerable collection of general overseas and rare book materials, as well as world-class Asian and Pacific collections which augment the Australiana collections. The print collections are further supported by extensive microform holdings.

The library also maintains the National Reserve Braille Collection.

As a national library, the NLA is required by legal deposit provisions enshrined in the &quot;Copyright Act 1968&quot; to collect a copy of every Australian publication in the country, which publishers must submit upon publication of the material.

At the end of the Australian financial year of 2018–19, the National Library collection comprised 7,717,579 items, and an additional of manuscript material. The library&#x27;s collections of Australiana have developed into the nation&#x27;s single most important resource of materials recording the Australian cultural heritage. Australian writers, editors and illustrators are actively sought and well represented, whether published in Australia or overseas.

The library&#x27;s collection includes all formats of material, from books, journals, websites and manuscripts to pictures, photographs, maps, music, oral history recordings, manuscript papers and ephemera. With the assistance and support of library staff from London, New York City, and Jakarta, building various collections have been possible.

Approximately 94.1% of the library&#x27;s collection had been catalogued by July 2019, a total of 5,453,888 items and these are discoverable through the online catalogue.

====Digital collections====
The library is a world leader in digital preservation techniques, and has maintained an Internet-accessible archive of selected Australian websites called the Pandora Archive since 1996. The Australian Web Archive, released in March 2019, combines records from PANDORA, the Australian Government Web Archive (AGWA), and other websites published in Australia. In the 2019 federal budget, the government allocated million to the library, intended to be spread over four years to set up a digitisation fund.

, the library had digitised a total of 5,508,008 images. Where possible, these are delivered directly across the Internet.

Since a 2016 amendment to the &quot;Copyright Act&quot;, all born-digital content must also be deposited in the library (with varying provisions for state libraries as well). The NLA has since May 2019 hosted and managed the National edeposit (NED) service. Libraries ACT, Libraries Tasmania, Northern Territory Library, State Library of New South Wales, State Library of Queensland, State Library of South Australia, State Library Victoria and the State Library of Western Australia are the member organisations of the collaboration.

===Asian collections===
The library houses the largest and most actively developing research resource on Asia in Australia, and the largest Asian language collections in the Southern hemisphere, with over half a million volumes in the collection, as well as extensive online and electronic resources. The library collects resources about all Asian countries in Western languages extensively, and resources in the following Asian languages: Burmese, Chinese, Persian, Indonesian, Japanese, Khmer, Korean, Lao, Manchu, Mongolian, Thai, Timorese, and Vietnamese.

The library has acquired a number of important Western and Asian language scholarly collections from researchers and bibliophiles. These collections include:
* Australian Buddhist Library Collection
* Braga Collection (Portuguese in Asia)
* Claasz Collection (Sri Lanka)
* Coedes Collection (Indo-China)
* London Missionary Society Collection (China)
* Luce Collection (Burma)
* McLaren-Human Collection (Korea)
* Otley Beyer Collection (Philippines)
* Sakakibara Collection (Japan)
* Sang Ye Collection (China)
* Simon Collection (East Asia)
* Harold S. Williams Collection (Japan)
The Asian Collections are searchable via the National library&#x27;s catalogue.

===Pictures and manuscripts===

The National Library holds an extensive collection of pictures and manuscripts. The manuscript collection contains about 26 million separate items, covering in excess of 10,492 metres of shelf space (ACA Australian Archival Statistics, 1998). The collection relates predominantly to Australia, but there are also important holdings relating to Papua New Guinea, New Zealand and the Pacific. The collection also holds a number of European and Asian manuscript collections or single items have been received as part of formed book collections.

The Australian manuscript collections date from the period of maritime exploration and settlement in the 18th century until the present, with the greatest area of strength dating from the 1890s onwards. The collection includes a large number of outstanding single items, such as the 14th century Chertsey Cartulary, the journal of James Cook on HM Bark Endeavour, inscribed on the Memory of the World Register in 2001, the diaries of Robert O&#x27;Hara Burke and William John Wills from the Burke and Wills expedition, and Charles Kingsford Smith&#x27;s and Charles Ulm&#x27;s log of the Southern Cross.

A wide range of individuals and families are represented in the collection, with special strength in the fields of politics, public administration, diplomacy, theatre, art, literature, the pastoral industry and religion. Examples are the papers of Alfred Deakin, Sir John Latham, Sir Keith Murdoch, Sir Hans Heysen, Sir John Monash, Vance Palmer and Nettie Palmer, A.D. Hope, Manning Clark, David Williamson, W.M. Hughes, Sir Robert Menzies, Sir William McMahon, Lord Casey, Geoffrey Dutton, Peter Sculthorpe, Daisy Bates, Jessie Street, and Eddie Mabo and James Cook both of whose papers were inscribed on UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World Programme Register in 2001.

The library has also acquired the records of many national non-governmental organisations. They include the records of the Federal Secretariats of the Liberal party, the A.L.P, the Democrats, the R.S.L., the Australian Inland Mission, the Australian Union of Students, The Australian Ballet, the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust, the Australian Institute of Urban Studies, Australian Industries Protection League, the Australian Conservation Foundation, and the Australian Council of National Trusts. Finally, the library holds about 37,000 reels of microfilm of manuscripts and archival records, mostly acquired overseas and predominantly of Australian and Pacific interest.

The National Library&#x27;s Pictures collection focuses on Australian people, places and events, from European exploration of the South Pacific to contemporary events. Art works and photographs are acquired primarily for their informational value, and for their importance as historical documents.

Media represented in the collection include photographs, drawings, watercolours, oils, lithographs, engravings, etchings and sculpture/busts.

===Ephemera===

The library contains a large amount of printed ephemera, collected since the early 1960s and also including older materials. These include minor publications, pamphlets, leaflets, invitations, cards, menus, junk mail, as well as larger publications, such as theatre programmes or retail trade catalogues. They are selected based on certain key criteria, such as information content, design elements, period representation, and portraiture. They are divided into various types or topics.

This group includes the Performing arts ephemera collection (PROMPT). Within the PROMPT collection, there are further divisions by person or topic, for instance the J.C. Williamson collection of theatre ephemera, and performers such as Dame Nellie Melba and Kylie Minogue. Since around 2017, a team of volunteers has been using the PROMPT collection to add content to the AusStage database. The J.C. Williamson Distributed Collection is held across six organisations: the NLA; Australian Performing Arts Collection in Melbourne; Mitchell Library in Sydney; Queensland Performing Arts Centre Museum; Scenic Studios Australia Pty Ltd; and Seaborn, Broughton &amp; Walford Foundation Archives and Library collection. Both AusStage and the J.C. Williamson Distributed Collection were added to the UNESCO Australian Memory of the World Register in 2021.

==Services==
The National Library of Australia provides a national leadership role in developing and managing collaborative online services with the Australian library community, making it easier for users to find and access information resources at the national level. It provides services to libraries and publishers and the general public, with membership available to residents of Australia providing access to additional services.

Some of the components of the services are:
*For publishers:
**Prepublication Data Service, ISSNs and ISMNs for Australian publishers.
**National edeposit (NED), to fulfill legal deposit obligations. NLA hosts and manages the service, whereby all born-digital content published in Australia, as required by legal deposit legislation under the &quot;Copyright Act 1968&quot;, is deposited remotely by the publisher, stored and made accessible to member libraries and the public.
*For librarians:
**The Australian National Bibliographic Database (ANBD) and offers free access through the Libraries Australia subscription-based service. It is used for reference, collection development, cataloguing and interlibrary lending.
**National Libraries Gateway.
*Online, for the general public:
**The Australian Web Archive, which now incorporates PANDORA (established 1996), the Australian Government Web Archive (AWA) and the &quot;.au&quot; domain archive. 
** National Library of Australia Catalogue, a catalogue of resources in NLA which are available to the general public.
** Ask a Librarian for users in need of research assistance or general information about the National Library of Australia.

===Trove===
The online services mentioned above, and more, are accessible via the Trove service, which was launched in 2009. Trove is an online library database aggregator, a centralised national service built with the collaboration of major libraries of Australia. Trove&#x27;s most well known feature is the digitised collection of Australian newspapers. Most NLA resource discovery services are now fully integrated with Trove. The service is able to locate resources about Australia and Australians, which reaches many locations otherwise unavailable to external search engines.

=== Publishing ===
The library produces non-fiction and children&#x27;s books which explore the collections. These cover subjects including History, Natural History and Art. NLA Publishing has been a recipient of several Eve Pownall Award for Information Books.

===Membership===
Free registration with the library is allowed for all Australian residents, with cards sent to a physical address before use is allowed. Membership confers some extra benefits for users of the library, such as requesting items for use onsite in the reading rooms, and access to a select range of licensed electronic resources from offsite, such as the full text of &quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica&quot;. Electronic copies of some items are able to be ordered, and for members who can visit the library in person, inter-library loans may be obtained to use in the reading rooms.

==Directors-General==

The following individuals have been appointed as Director-General or any precedent titles:
==Funding problems==
In 2016, with threatened funding cuts to Trove, a public campaign led to a government commitment of million in December 2016, spread over four years.

By early 2020, with the surge in demand for all types of digital services, the National Library was having to cope with increasingly dwindling staff resources to develop services on Trove and National edeposit, and undertook a restructure of its staffing and operations.

<text>Sky City 1000 is a proposed skyscraper for the Tokyo metropolitan area. It was announced in 1989 at the height of the Japanese asset price bubble. 

The proposal consists of a building tall and wide at the base, with a total floor area of . The design, proposed in 1989 by the Takenaka Corporation, would have housed between 35,000 and 36,000 full-time residents as well as 100,000 workers. It comprised 14 concave dish-shaped &quot;Space Plateaus&quot; stacked one upon the other. The interior of the plateaus would have contained greenspace, and the edges of the building would have contained apartments. The building would have also housed offices, commercial facilities, schools, theatres, and other modern amenities.

The Sky City was featured on Discovery Channel&#x27;s &quot;Extreme Engineering&quot; in 2003. 

Land prices in Japan were the highest in the world at the time, but Kisho Kurokawa, one of Japan&#x27;s most famous architects, has said that staggeringly ambitious buildings employing highly sophisticated engineering are still cheap, because companies pay 90 percent of the cost for the land and only 10 percent for the building. Tokyo&#x27;s only fire helicopter has even been used in simulation tests to see what the danger would be if a fire were to break out in the building. To mitigate this, triple-decker high speed elevators were proposed and prototyped in labs outside Tokyo.

Although the Sky City gained more serious attention than many of its alternatives, it was never carried out, similarly to projects such as X-Seed 4000 and to ultra-high density, mixed use concepts such as Paolo Soleri&#x27;s Arcology and Le Corbusier&#x27;s Ville Radieuse.

If completed, Sky City 1000 would be the tallest man-made structure in the world surpassing the Burj Khalifa.

<doc id="796064" wikidata="Q842119" url="?curid=796064" title="Haro (character)">
<text>is the mechanical mascot of the &quot;Gundam&quot; science fiction anime franchise, and is the only character that appears in more than one timeline. Haro has since become a mascot for the Sunrise studio as a whole, often appearing in their recent idents.

==Universal Century==
The original Haro is a little robot companion built by the main character Amuro Ray. It is a cute testament to Amuro&#x27;s exceptional talent for machines. Haro&#x27;s features include a limited range of speech, and the ability to hover (in environments with atmosphere and low gravity) by flapping its ear-like appendage coverings. Haro can usually be found rolling behind Amuro&#x27;s next door neighbor Fraw Bow. The ability to detect brain waves is also one of Haro&#x27;s functions; in one of the episodes, Haro actually claimed that the brain wave of Amuro was lowered/different.
In &quot;Zeta Gundam&quot;, a mass-produced Mk-II version of Haro ends up in the hands of that series&#x27; main protagonist Kamille Bidan, who initially suspects it to be the original. He repairs the robot, only to have it constantly address him as Amuro.

During the events of &quot;Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot;, Amuro gives a &quot;third-generation&quot; Haro to Hathaway, the son of his captain Bright Noa.

In &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn&quot;, the main character Banagher Links owns a replica of the original Haro, which was given to him by his father when he was young. Banagher has added unique improvements to his Haro.

In the manga &quot;Crossbone Gundam&quot;, conceptualised by &quot;Gundam&quot; creator Yoshiyuki Tomino, Berah Ronah has a robotic parrot named Haro, which refers to her as &quot;Matilda-san&quot;. This seems to imply that her Haro is (or was made from the remains of) Amuro Ray&#x27;s Haro, since it mistakes Berah for the redheaded Lieutenant Matilda Adjan, who appears in the original series, and in addition makes constant references to prior events and phrases in the UC timeline.

In &quot;Victory Gundam&quot;, the main character, Uso Ewin, has a Haro replica that he received from his father. Uso&#x27;s Haro possesses a remarkably advanced artificial intelligence, and is even capable of controlling mobile suits, mimicking machine gun sounds, and projecting holographic images to intimidate the adversary.

==Cosmic Era==

Haro continues to permeate the &quot;Gundam&quot; franchise, having appeared in &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; as Lacus Clyne&#x27;s multi-colored horde of simple-speech robot pets, built for her by Athrun Zala. These Haros are roughly 1/4 the size of their Universal Century counterparts and are similar in function, however a few possess certain abilities such as unlocking doors. Lacus&#x27; favorite Haro is a pink machine that she refers to as &quot;Pink-Chan&quot; (often translated as &quot;Mr. Pink&quot; or &quot;Pinky&quot;). Another notable Haro in Lacus&#x27;s collection is &quot;Navy-Chan&quot;, a navy blue robot on which she paints a mustache bearing a distinct resemblance the facial ornament of the &quot;∀ Gundam&quot; of the CC (正歴 &quot;Seireki&quot;) calendar system. The rest of Lacus&#x27; Haros have been seen in yellow, orange, blue, green, and black. The parody comic &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Club Yonkoma&quot; states that Athrun has built a total of 35 Haros for Lacus.

In this continuity, Pink-chan often adds &quot;omae moda&quot; or &quot;you too&quot; to its sentences, depending on the language he is in (you too for the English translation, and vice versa), and often reasonlessly interjects with &quot;Haro!&quot; Pink-chan also often uses &quot;Teyandei&quot; (meaning &quot;don&#x27;t say a silly thing&quot;, a common reply in Manzai comedy) at seemingly random and nonsensical times. Pink-chan has also once said &quot;damnit!&quot; when he, along with Lacus, was returned to Athrun by Kira early in Gundam Seed.
In &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot;, Lacus impersonator Meer Campbell is often seen with her own red Haro. Unlike other Haros, which speak Japanese, &quot;Mister Red&quot; speaks in English. However, in the English dub, (where Pink-chan and the rest of Lacus&#x27; Haros speak English), Mister Red speaks English with a Japanese accent.

==Anno Domini==

In &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam 00&quot;, Celestial Being had produced unknown numbers of Haros as an assistant of daily maintenance works. At least six unique Haros have appeared in the animation production. The Haros in the series took much more maintenance and combat role than any other series&#x27; counterpart, usually seeing them operating with various machines, including mobile weapons.

The Haro which appears most is the Orange Haro, kept by the Gundam Meister Lockon Stratos, which accompanies him in the Gundam Dynames&#x27;s cockpit, usually performing radar-like duties by detecting and warning Lockon of any incoming enemy units or attacks. In the event of close combat, Lockon&#x27;s Haro is able to pilot his Gundam for him while he uses his sniper rifle, and control the additional shields that Dynames receives in episode 6. The Haro is returned to the Ptolemaios in Episode 24 after the destruction of Gundam Dynames. The Haro is later used in Cherudim Gundam&#x27;s cockpit in season 2.

In episode 9, the four Haros address the orange Haro as &quot;big brother&quot;; their colors are blue, purple, red-violet, and dark green respectively. In episode 17, the orange Haro in turn addresses Nena Trinity&#x27;s purple Haro, which was found in a wreck 80 years ago as &quot;big brother&quot;. It might be suggested it is the prototype of the other Haros from the Celestial Being; that Haro is named &quot;HARO&quot; in official data, which named in English but not Japanese.

In episode 2 of the second season, a red-pink Haro is assigned to accompany with Saji Crossroad, who is initially detained by Celestial Being on Ptolemaios 2, and later used in 0-Raiser&#x27;s cockpit to assist Saji, who has no experience using mobile weapons. It is unknown that if it was the same red-violet Haro appeared in first season, due to lighting issue.

From Fereshte, Hanayo, a manmade AI that is of the same model as Lockon&#x27;s Haro that is yellow in colour appears to resemble a cat, since it has a tail and cat-like ears which are always flapping. A character that bears resemblance to Gundam Meister 874 is shown to be released from the inside of Hanayo as shown in the Gundam 00F manga.

The Haros that appear in &quot;Gundam 00&quot; are 25 cm in diameter and are larger than Lacus Clyne&#x27;s and Meer Campbell&#x27;s Haros (about 10 cm in diameter), but smaller than Amuro Ray&#x27;s.

==Advanced Generation==
The Haro in &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam AGE&quot; is created by main character Flit Asuno, later entrusted by him to his son Asemu, and inherited by his grandson Kio. Despite being similar to the UC Haros in color and size, this Haro appear to be extremely elastic, and has the ability to bounce as high as a mobile suit&#x27;s cockpit. It can also be used as a portable computer/terminal when it opens itself, displaying a keyboard and screen.

==Reguild Century==
&quot;Gundam Reconguista in G&quot; has a Haro-like diagnostics robot named Nobell. It is named after the main character Bellri and his friend Noredo. It is referred to as a HAROBE-type robot.

==Size==
The Haros seen in the original Universal Century and the Advanced Generation timelines are roughly the size of a basketball, with the Anno Domini timeline&#x27;s variations being slightly smaller. The Cosmic Era Haros are slightly smaller than a softball but larger than a baseball.

==Human form==
In &quot;Superior Defender Gundam Force&quot;, &quot;Chief Haro&quot; is the leader of the SDG, who wears a Haro helmet to mask his real identity. Though he cannot &quot;fly&quot; like his toy counterpart, his &quot;wings&quot; do flip up his cap at times.

==Video games==

In the game, &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Never Ending Tomorrow&quot; and the remaster Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Never Ending Tomorrow R, there is a special mode called &quot;Haro Madness&quot; where the player fights gigantic versions of &quot;Pink-Chan&quot;, &quot;Navy-Chan&quot;, and a green Haro. They have their own signature traits, and this mode is said to be one of the hardest in the entire game.

In the &quot;SD Gundam: G Generation&quot; series of tactical role-playing games, Haros frequently appear as secret units, generally ones of overwhelming power, such as the giant &quot;Psycho Haro&quot; of &quot;SD Gundam: G Generation Zero&quot;, which is easily capable of destroying an enemy fleet in a single turn. Another mission on G Generation Seed which the player had to defeat the Pink Haro.

In arcade fighting game Mobile Suit Gundam: EX Revue, when any player gets dizzy, Instead of stars there is Haro.

In the &quot;Super Robot Wars&quot; series of video games, Haros are rare equippable items, usually providing a large bonus to the equipping unit&#x27;s stats or simply a sub-pilot of Usso Erwin (&quot;Mobile Suit V Gundam&quot;) or Lockon Stratos (&quot;Mobile Suit Gundam 00&quot;). Additionally, in the early Super Famicom installments, the various forms of AI that controlled many common enemy units were represented by portraits of Haro. Using Spirit Command Daunt (脱力) in other games than Original Generations will shown a green Haro (or Pink Haro in &quot;Super Robot Wars J&quot;) will spin around the target, causing the target to lose 10 Will Points (or some battle events will cause lose more than 10 Will Points without using Daunt). In the very early series (before 4), the AI units head icons are Haros, rather than computer chips.

In Harobots series developed by Sunrise Interactive, Haro is portrayed as trainer&#x27;s pet.

In the &quot;Dynasty Warriors: Gundam&quot; series, enemies will occasionally drop power-ups resembling Haro with open wing flaps, which refills the player&#x27;s health and special power bars to maximum. Also in &quot;Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 2&quot;, new objectives are signalled by a &quot;Haro, haro&quot; sound (the voice differs depending on region), and the Pink-chan Haro appears on the Game Over screen saying &quot;Focus&quot; (in the English version). One of the random Submissions that appears during the game&#x27;s regular missions is Lacus asking the player to find and rescue Haro for her, Haro never speaks directly but if the mission is completed he asks Lacus to join the players side.

==Toys and merchandise==

In real life, Bandai released a series of Haro Capsule toys (called Haro Cap, different from the Gundam Haro Capsule sold by Broccoli USA) with different colours and painting, mostly showing a reference to icons of the &quot;Gundam&quot; universes. For example, one having the V-shaped antenna painted on the forehead(?) referencing RX-78-2 Gundam and one painted red with an antenna on the forehead as the MS-06S Zaku II, Char Aznable Custom.

Haro has been immortalized in a series of robotic toys called &quot;1/4 scale Digital Hobby Series Mascot Robo&quot;. It was initially available in green. The &quot;Haro Color&quot; series was released later on, adding yellow, orange, navy blue and sky blue to the roster. These Haros are basically glorified alarm clocks that react to any nearby sound by rocking sideways, lighting up red eyes, creating robotic sounds, spewing Japanese phrases and/or flipping their &quot;ears&quot;. If an alarm is set and time approaches, the Green Haro plays a tune (not the actual song) of Mobile Suit Gundam&#x27;s OP theme, &quot;Tobe! Gundam&quot;.

Years later, at the height of &quot;Gundam SEED&quot;&#x27;s popularity, a 1/1 scale (the same size as the 1/4 scale) Pink Haro called &quot;Haro 2&quot; was released to coincide with popular character Lacus Clyne. The Pink Haro is more sensitive to sound than its predecessors, along with a light-detection sensor. When the ambiance changes from bright to dark (usually by casting a shadow over it by waving your hand), the Pink Haro will react in the same manner like the previous Haros, only noisier. If an alarm is set and the time approaches, it will keep saying Japanese phrases while flipping its ears and blinking its eyes. Pink Haro&#x27;s voice in this toy was provided by the actor who dubbed its voice in the anime, Kotono Mitsuishi.

In February 2008, a &quot;Gundam 00 Style Digital Hobby Series Mascot Robo&quot; Haro, who represents Lockon Stratos&#x27; Orange Haro will be released as announced in the Plamo Radicon Show 2007. Pictures on the internet give the impression that the new Haro will be another 1/4 scale (making it the same size as the previous Haros). Unlike its Orange Haro ancestor of the &quot;Haro Color&quot; series released years ago, this Haro&#x27;s reported features include two modes of play and an internal motion sensor to which it will react in the manner as its predecessors. It is yet unclear if previous features such as the alarm clock and the photo-sensitivity (that the Pink Haro had) would be included or if the actor Arisa Ogasawara (who dubs Haro&#x27;s voice in &quot;Gundam 00&quot;) will provide the toy&#x27;s speaking voice.

Through the years, Japanese videogame publisher and toy maker Banpresto as well as other companies have released countless Haro products due to the character&#x27;s immense popularity as a Gundam &quot;mascot&quot;. The merchandise includes T-shirts, wristbands, towels, circular or Haro-shaped calculators, room lights (including Planetarium-like lights and bath lights where you submerge Haro in water, activate him and he&#x27;ll glow underwater), bath toys (a haro-shaped rubber duck that propels itself in water when activated), microphones and earphones, speakers, Haro-shaped CD players and cases, cell phone accessories, plush toys, cushions, and the short-lived &quot;Haromatherapy&quot; room freshener (pressing it makes Haro pop its ears and release scents to stimulate the olfactory senses).

The biggest and most expensive Haro product created was the infamous Haro desktop PC case. It weighs a heavy 5 kg and around 40 cm in diameter. It wasn&#x27;t big enough to support all PCs: It was reported to carry relatively small computers like the Mac Mini. Only 1000 units were manufactured and it retailed for 99,800 yen. A very expensive piece, it was shunned and labelled as &quot;a novelty product for Gundam fans only&quot;. The Haro PC case was controllable by remote but, unlike the 1/4 and 1/1 scale Haro toys, it cannot move sideways. Instead, it opens its &quot;ears&quot;, takes out its hands and moves them back and forth while blinking its yellow eyes (instead of the conventional red) and speaking in an extremely loud voice.

==Haro cameos==
After the original &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; series was canceled, Tomino included a number of Haro cameos in his next series, &quot;Space Runaway Ideon&quot;:
*Episode 2 - a Haro appears in an exploding Solo colonist fighter (as a side note, this same footage is used in episode 18, but the Haro has been painted over).
*Episode 9 - a Haro can be seen as some dinosaurs explode.
*Episodes 7, 13 and 19 - a Haro can be seen rolling around on a table as the ship shakes.
*Episode 18 - a poster of Char Aznable is seen on a bedroom wall, a few seconds later as the room explodes a pair of Haro can be seen flying around the room.

In the animated movie &quot;Crusher Joe&quot;, Haro appears during several explosions near the end of the movie.

<doc id="796076" wikidata="Q743162" url="?curid=796076" title="Tucker Carlson">
<text>Tucker Swanson McNear Carlson (born May 16, 1969) is an American conservative political commentator and conspiracy theorist who hosted the nightly political talk show &quot;Tucker Carlson Tonight&quot; on Fox News from 2016 to 2023. Since his contract with Fox News was terminated, he has hosted &quot;Tucker on X&quot; and &quot;The Tucker Carlson Show.&quot; An advocate of President Donald Trump, Carlson has been described as &quot;perhaps the highest-profile proponent of Trumpism&quot;, &quot;the most influential voice in right-wing media, without a close second,&quot; and a leading voice of white grievance politics.

Carlson began his media career in the 1990s, writing for &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; and other publications. He was a CNN commentator from 2000 to 2005 and a co-host of &quot;Crossfire&quot;, the network&#x27;s prime-time news debate program, from 2001 to 2005. From 2005 to 2008, he hosted the nightly program &quot;Tucker&quot; on MSNBC. In 2009, he became a political analyst for Fox News, appearing on various programs before launching his own show. In 2010, Carlson co-founded and served as the initial editor-in-chief of the right-wing news and opinion website &quot;The Daily Caller&quot;, until selling his ownership stake and leaving in 2020. He has written three books: &quot;Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites&quot; (2003), &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; (2018), and &quot;The Long Slide&quot; (2021).

Carlson is known for circulating far-right ideas into mainstream politics and discourse. He has promoted conspiracy theories on topics such as demographic replacement, COVID-19, the January 6 United States Capitol attack, and Ukrainian bioweapons; and has been noted for false and misleading statements about these and other topics. Carlson&#x27;s remarks on race, immigration, and womenincluding slurs he said on air between 2006 and 2011have been described by some as racist and sexist, and provoked advertiser boycotts of &quot;Tucker Carlson Tonight&quot;.

In April 2023, Fox News dismissed Carlson and canceled his show without any explanation. It was Lachlan Murdoch who made the decision to fire him. &quot;Tucker Carlson Tonight&quot; had at that point been one of the most-watched cable news shows in the country. Carlson was among the hosts named in the &quot;Dominion Voting Systems v. Fox News Network&quot; defamation lawsuit for broadcasting false statements about the plaintiff company&#x27;s voting machines that Fox News settled for $787.5 million and required Fox News to acknowledge that the broadcast statements were false.

Carlson is a critic of immigration. Formerly an economic libertarian, he now supports protectionism. In 2004, he renounced his initial support for the Iraq War, and has since been skeptical of U.S. foreign interventions. He was said to have influenced some of Trump&#x27;s decisions as president, including the cancellation of a military strike against Iran in 2019, the dismissal of John Bolton as National Security Advisor the same year, and the commutation of Roger Stone&#x27;s prison sentence in 2020, and would criticize Trump when he believed he was straying from &quot;Trumpism&quot;. Carlson has often defended the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin. In February 2024, he became the first Western journalist to interview Putin since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

==Early life and education==

Carlson was born Tucker McNear Carlson at the Children&#x27;s Hospital in San Francisco, California, on May 16, 1969. He is the elder son of Lisa McNear (; 19452011), an artist from San Francisco,&lt;ref name=&quot;mercurynews/tucker-rejection-by-mom&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and Dick Carlson (1941), a former &quot;gonzo reporter&quot; who became the director of Voice of America, president of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the U.S. ambassador to the Seychelles, and more recently a director at the lobbying firm Policy Impact Strategic Communications. Carlson&#x27;s brother, Buckley Peck Carlson, later Buckley Swanson Peck Carlson, is nearly two years younger and has worked as a communications manager and a Republican Party political operative.

Carlson&#x27;s paternal grandparents were Richard Boynton and Dorothy Anderson, who were teenagers when they placed his father at The Home for Little Wanderers orphanage, where he was fostered by Carl Moberger of Malden, near Boston, a tannery worker of Swedish descent, and his wife Florence Moberger. Carlson&#x27;s father was adopted at the age of two by upper-middle-class New Englanders, the Carlsons, an executive at the Winslow Brothers &amp; Smith Tannery of Norwood (the oldest tannery in America) and his wife.
Carlson&#x27;s maternal great-great-great-grandfather was Henry Miller, the &quot;Cattle King&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfstandard/carlsons-sf-mother&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson&#x27;s maternal great-great-grandfather Cesar Lombardi immigrated to New York from Switzerland in 1860. Carlson is also a distant relative of Massachusetts politicians Ebenezer R. Hoar and George M. Brooks. Carlson himself was named after his great-great-great-grandfather J. C. Tucker and his great-great-grandfather George W. McNear.&lt;ref name=&quot;maritimeheritage/George-McNear&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson is of one thirty-second Italian-Swiss ancestry.

In 1976, Carlson&#x27;s parents divorced after the nine-year marriage reportedly &quot;turned sour&quot;. Carlson&#x27;s father was granted custody of Tucker and his brother. Carlson&#x27;s mother left the family when he was six and moved to France. The boys never saw her again.

When Carlson was in first grade, his father moved Tucker and his brother to the La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego, California, and raised them there. Carlson attended La Jolla Country Day School and grew up in a home overlooking the La Jolla Beach and Tennis Club. His father owned property in Nevada and Vermont, and islands in Maine and Nova Scotia. In 1984, his father unsuccessfully challenged the incumbent Republican Party mayor Roger Hedgecock in the San Diego mayoral race.

In 1979, Carlson&#x27;s father married Patricia Caroline Swanson, an heiress to Swanson Enterprises, daughter of Gilbert Carl Swanson and niece of Senator J. William Fulbright. Though Patricia remained a beneficiary of the family fortune, the Swansons had sold the brand to the Campbell Soup Company in 1955 and did not own it by the time of Carlson&#x27;s father&#x27;s marriage. This was the third marriage for Swanson, who legally adopted Tucker Carlson and his brother.

Carlson was briefly enrolled at Collège du Léman, a boarding school in the Canton of Geneva in French-speaking Switzerland, but said he was &quot;kicked out&quot;. He attained his secondary education at St. George&#x27;s School, a boarding school in Middletown, Rhode Island, where he started dating his future wife, Susan Andrews, the headmaster&#x27;s daughter. He then spent four years attending Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut and graduated in 1991 with a B.A. in history. Carlson&#x27;s Trinity yearbook describes him as a member of the &quot;Dan White Society&quot;, an apparent reference to the American political assassin who murdered San Francisco mayor George Moscone and supervisor Harvey Milk. After college, Carlson tried to join the Central Intelligence Agency, but his application was denied, after which he decided to pursue a career in journalism with the encouragement of his father, who advised him that &quot;they&#x27;ll take anybody&quot;.

==Career==
Carlson began his career in journalism as a fact-checker for &quot;Policy Review&quot;, a national conservative journal then published by the Heritage Foundation and later acquired by the Hoover Institution. He then worked as an opinion writer at the &quot;Arkansas Democrat-Gazette&quot; newspaper in Little Rock, Arkansas, before joining &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; news magazine in 1995. Writer Andrew Ferguson, who served as senior editor of &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;, said that Carlson &quot;had as much talent as anybody who ever came through the door.&quot; Carlson sought a role with the publication after hearing of its founding, fearing he would be &quot;written off as a wing nut&quot; if he instead joined &quot;The American Spectator&quot;.

In 1999, Carlson interviewed then-Governor George W. Bush for &quot;Talk&quot; magazine. He quoted Bush mocking Karla Faye Tucker, who was executed in Bush&#x27;s state of Texas, and frequently using the word &quot;fuck&quot;. The piece led to bad publicity for Bush&#x27;s 2000 presidential campaign. Bush claimed that &quot;Mr. Carlson misread, mischaracterized me. He&#x27;s a good reporter, he just misunderstood about how serious that was. I take the death penalty very seriously.&quot; Among liberals, Carlson&#x27;s piece received praise, with Democratic consultant Bob Shrum calling it &quot;vivid&quot;. Carlson said of the interview, &quot;I thought I&#x27;d be ragged for writing a puffy piece. My wife said people are going to think you&#x27;re hunting for a job in the Bush campaign.&quot;

Further into his career in print, Carlson worked as a columnist for &quot;New York&quot; magazine and &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;; writing for &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Slate&quot;, &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. John F. Harris of &quot;Politico&quot; would later remark on how Carlson was &quot;viewed... as an important voice of the intelligentsia&quot; during this period. While working on a story for &quot;New York&quot; covering the Taliban, Carlson, alongside his father, was involved in a plane crash as it made its landing on a runway in Dubai on October 17, 2001. Carlson&#x27;s 2003 &quot;Esquire&quot; profile on his journey to Liberia alongside Reverend Al Sharpton and other civil and political rights activists would garner a nomination at the National Magazine Awards.

In his early television career, Carlson wore bow ties, a habit from boarding school he continued on air until 2006.

On June 21, 2021, &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter Ben Smith reported that Carlson was a media source for several journalists and authors, including Michael Isikoff, Michael Wolff, Brian Stelter, and others who wrote critically of Donald Trump.

===CNN (2000–2005)===
In 2000, Carlson co-hosted the short-lived show &quot;The Spin Room&quot; on CNN. In 2001, he was appointed co-host of &quot;Crossfire&quot;, in which Carlson and Robert Novak represented the political right (alternating on different nights), while James Carville and Paul Begala, also alternating as hosts, represented the left.

Carlson&#x27;s 2003 interview with Britney Spears, wherein he asked if she opposed the ongoing Iraq War and she responded, &quot;[W]e should just trust our president in every decision he makes&quot;, was featured in the 2004 film &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;, for which she won a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress at the 25th Golden Raspberry Awards.

==== Jon Stewart debate ====

In October 2004, comedian and &quot;The Daily Show&quot; host Jon Stewart appeared on &quot;Crossfire&quot;, ostensibly to promote &quot;America (The Book)&quot;, but he instead launched into a critique of &quot;Crossfire&quot;, saying the show was harmful to political discourse in the U.S. Carlson was singled out by Stewart for criticism, with Carlson in turn criticizing Stewart for being biased toward the left. Carlson and Begala later recalled that Stewart and one of the book&#x27;s co-authors, Ben Karlin, stayed at CNN for more than an hour after the show to discuss the issues he had raised on the air, with Carlson saying, &quot;It was heartfelt. [Stewart] needed to do this.&quot; In 2017, &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to Stewart&#x27;s &quot;on-air dressing-down&quot; of Carlson as an &quot;ignominious career [moment]&quot; for Carlson, leading to the show&#x27;s cancellation. &quot;The Atlantic&quot; suggested that Stewart&#x27;s appearance was a turning point leading to how Carlson remade himself.

On January 5, 2005, CNN chief Jonathan Klein told Carlson the network had decided not to renew his contract. CNN announced that it was ending its relationship with Carlson and would soon cancel &quot;Crossfire&quot;. Carlson later said: &quot;I resigned from &quot;Crossfire&quot; in April [2004], many months before Jon Stewart came on our show, because I didn&#x27;t like the partisanship, and I thought in some ways it was kind of a pointless conversation.&quot;

=== PBS (2004–2005) ===
Carlson was hired to helm a new program for PBS in November 2003, &quot;Tucker Carlson: Unfiltered&quot;, which ran concurrently with Carlson&#x27;s &quot;Crossfire&quot; gig on CNN. The show launched on June 18, 2004, and was, according to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;part of a broader effort to push PBS further to the right ideologically&quot;.

Carlson announced he was leaving the show roughly a year after it started on June 12, 2005, despite the Corporation for Public Broadcasting allocating money for another show season. Carlson wanted to focus on his new MSNBC show &quot;Tucker&quot; and said that although PBS was one of the &quot;least bad&quot; instances of government spending he disagreed with, it was still &quot;problematic&quot;.

=== MSNBC (2005–2008) ===

Carlson&#x27;s early evening show &quot;Tucker&quot;, originally titled &quot;The Situation With Tucker Carlson&quot;, premiered on June 13, 2005, on MSNBC. Rachel Maddow and Jay Severin featured as guests on a rotating panel. He also hosted a late-afternoon weekday wrap-up for the network during the 2006 Winter Olympics. He reported the aftermath of the Virginia Tech shooting and Johnson Space Center shooting in 2007.

&quot;Tucker&quot; was canceled by the network on March 10, 2008, owing to low ratings; the final episode aired on March 14, 2008. He remained with the network as a senior campaign correspondent for the 2008 election. Brian Stelter, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, reported that, &quot;during Mr. Carlson&#x27;s tenure, MSNBC&#x27;s evening programming moved gradually to the left. His former time slots, 6:00p.m. and 9:00p.m., were subsequently occupied by two liberals, Ed Schultz and Rachel Maddow.&quot; Carlson said the network had changed a lot and &quot;they didn&#x27;t have a role for me&quot;. Carlson described being fired by MSNBC as leading to a professional &quot;meltdown&quot;. In discussing the termination, he described himself as &quot;hav[ing] a lot of problems with authority and being told what to do. I don&#x27;t react well to it. I become really aggressive[.]&quot;

=== Media outside journalism (2006–2008) ===
Carlson was a contestant on season 3 of the reality show &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, which aired in 2006; he was paired with professional dancer Elena Grinenko. Carlson took four-hour-a-day ballroom dance classes to prepare. In an interview a month before the show began, he lamented that he would miss classes during a two-week-long MSNBC assignment in Lebanon, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s hard for me to remember the moves.&quot; Carlson said he accepted ABC&#x27;s invitation to perform because &quot;I don&#x27;t do things that I&#x27;m not good at very often. I&#x27;m psyched to get to do that.&quot; Carlson was the first contestant eliminated, on September 13, 2006.

Carlson had cameo appearances as himself in the Season1 episode &quot;Hard Ball&quot; of &quot;30 Rock&quot; and in a Season9 episode of &quot;The King of Queens&quot;. He had a cameo appearance in the 2008 film &quot;Swing Vote&quot;, again playing himself.

=== &quot;The Daily Caller&quot; (2010–2020) ===

On January 11, 2010, Carlson and Neil Patel (a former aide to Dick Cheney, and former college roommate of Carlson) launched a political news website titled &quot;The Daily Caller&quot;. Carlson served as editor-in-chief, and occasionally wrote opinion pieces with Patel. The website was funded by the conservative activist Foster Friess. By February 2010, &quot;The Daily Caller&quot; was part of the White House rotating press pool. Carlson reportedly offered his employees free junk food, an unmonitored keg, provided them with a ping pong table, and allowed them to sleep under their desks.

In interviews, Carlson said &quot;The Daily Caller&quot; would not be tied to ideology but rather &quot;breaking stories of importance&quot;, and &quot;We&#x27;re not enforcing any kind of ideological orthodoxy on anyone.&quot; Columnist Mickey Kaus quit after Carlson refused to run a column critical of Fox News&#x27;s coverage of the immigration policy debate due to his contractual obligations to Fox News.

In June 2010, &quot;The Daily Caller&quot; published excerpts from e-mails sent between members of JournoList, an invitation-only liberal forum, consisting of &quot;several hundred journalists, academics and policy experts&quot; launched in 2007 by Ezra Klein. The forum barred media reporters and conservatives. Carlson had earlier attempted to join the forum on May 25, 2010, but was denied by Klein. Klein offered to form a bipartisan forum with Carlson, but Carlson declined. &quot;Daily Caller&quot; employees later impersonated an editor of the &quot;Arkansas Times&quot; to gain entry into JournoList. The e-mails leaked by &quot;The Daily Caller&quot;, which detailed efforts to, according to Carlson, &quot;formulate the most effective talking points in order to defeat Palin and McCain and help elect Barack Obama president&quot;, also contained statements by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Dave Weigel &quot;wishing for the death of Rush Limbaugh&quot; among other controversial remarks that &quot;The Washington Post&quot; considered &quot;untenable&quot;, leading to his resignation.

In February 2012, &quot;The Daily Caller&quot; published an &quot;investigative series&quot; of articles co-authored by Carlson, purporting to be an insiders&#x27; exposé of Media Matters for America, the liberal watchdog group that monitors and scrutinizes conservative media outlets, and its founder David Brock. Reuters media critic and libertarian Jack Shafer, while commenting &quot;I&#x27;ve never thought much of Media Matters&#x27; style of watchdogging or Brock&#x27;s journalism&quot;, nevertheless sharply criticized &quot;The Daily Caller&quot; piece for relying on conjecture, absence of evidence, and inclusion of &quot;anonymously sourced crap&quot;, adding that &quot;&quot;Daily Caller&quot; is attacking Media Matters with bad journalism and lame propaganda.&quot;

In June 2017, the Center for Media and Democracy, a liberal watchdog organization, said &quot;The Daily Caller&quot; was paid $150,000 by Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign for its list of subscribers, whom the Trump campaign then emailed at least 25 times. The watchdog said Carlson had a conflict of interest and had violated journalistic standards.

In June 2020, Carlson sold his one-third stake in &quot;The Daily Caller&quot; to Patel for an undisclosed amount and said &quot;Neil [Patel] runs it. I wasn&#x27;t adding anything. So we made it official&quot;.

===Fox News Channel (2009–2023)===
In May 2009, Fox News announced that Carlson was being hired as a Fox News contributor. He was a frequent guest panelist on Fox&#x27;s late-night satire show &quot;Red Eye w/Greg Gutfeld&quot;, made frequent appearances on the All-Star Panel segment of &quot;Special Report with Bret Baier&quot;, was a substitute host of &quot;Hannity&quot; in Sean Hannity&#x27;s absence, and produced and hosted a special entitled &quot;Fighting for Our Children&#x27;s Minds&quot; in September 2010.

On the eve of then-President Barack Obama&#x27;s first debate with Mitt Romney in October 2012, Carlson publicized a 2007 video recording of then-Senator Obama criticizing the federal government&#x27;s response to Hurricane Katrina and complimenting his pastor at the time, Reverend Jeremiah Wright. Wright&#x27;s sermons had been a controversy in Obama&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign. Portions of the video had been available online since 2007. An anonymous user going by the name &quot;Sore Throwt&quot; (a pun on famous Watergate informant Deep Throat) had been looking for a buyer of the tape for a week before Carlson distributed it.

In April 2013, Carlson replaced Dave Briggs as a co-host of &quot;Fox &amp; Friends Weekend&quot;, joining Alisyn Camerota and Clayton Morris on Saturday and Sunday mornings.

==== &quot;Tucker Carlson Tonight&quot; (2016–2023) ====
On November 14, 2016, Carlson began hosting &quot;Tucker Carlson Tonight&quot; on Fox News. The premiere episode of the show, which replaced &quot;On the Record&quot;, was the network&#x27;s most watched telecast of the year in the time slot, with 3.7 million viewers.

&quot;Tucker Carlson Tonight&quot; aired at 7:00p.m. each weeknight until January 9, 2017, when Carlson&#x27;s show replaced Megyn Kelly at the 9:00p.m. time slot after she left Fox News. In January 2017, &quot;Forbes&quot; reported that the show had &quot;scored consistently high ratings, averaging 2.8 million viewers per night and ranking as the number two cable news program behind &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; in December&quot;. In March 2017, &quot;Tucker Carlson Tonight&quot; was the most watched cable program in the 9:00p.m. time slot.

On April 19, 2017, Fox News announced that &quot;Tucker Carlson Tonight&quot; would air at 8:00p.m. following the cancellation of &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;. &quot;Tucker Carlson Tonight&quot; was the third-highest-rated cable news show as of March 2018.

In October 2018, &quot;Tucker Carlson Tonight&quot; was the second-highest rated cable news show in prime time, after &quot;The Sean Hannity Show&quot; with Sean Hannity, with 3.2 million nightly viewers. By the end of 2018, the show had begun to be boycotted by at least 20 advertisers after Carlson said immigration makes the country &quot;poorer, dirtier and more divided&quot;. According to Fox News, the advertisers only moved their ad buys to other programs.

In November 2018, a &quot;Smash Racism D.C.&quot; activist group associated with antifa protested outside Carlson&#x27;s home in Washington, D.C. Carlson&#x27;s driveway was vandalized with a spray-painted anarchist symbol. Carlson alleged &quot;someone started throwing himself against the front door and actually cracked the front door,&quot; though police observed no damage to the door, nor did &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist Erik Wemple when he visited the Carlson home the next day. Carlson was not home at the time of the incident.

By January 2019, Carlson&#x27;s show dropped to third with 2.8 million nightly viewers, down six percent from the previous year. The show also lost at least 26 advertisers.

In March 2019, there were calls to fire Carlson from Fox News after Media Matters resurfaced remarks he had made over several years to the radio show &quot;Bubba the Love Sponge&quot; concerning women, calling them &quot;like dogs&quot; and &quot;extremely primitive&quot;, and statutory rape, Iraqis, and immigrants. His ratings rose eight percent that week despite the boycotts.

By August 2019, Media Matters calculated that some companies had fulfilled their media buy contracts and advertising inventory for the time slot and had now begun their purchases for other time slots on Fox News. At the close of 2019, Carlson&#x27;s Nielsen ratings among all viewers 25–54 placed him second only to Fox&#x27;s &quot;The Sean Hannity Show&quot; among cable news shows.

In December 2019, &quot;Playboy&quot; model Karen McDougal sued Fox News after Carlson, in a 2018 episode of his show, accused her of extorting Donald Trump. In September 2020, federal judge Mary Kay Vyskocil dismissed the lawsuit, citing Fox News&#x27; defense that Carlson&#x27;s extortion claims were opinion based and not &quot;statements of fact&quot;. The judge also agreed with Fox News&#x27; defense that reasonable viewers would have &quot;skepticism&quot; over statements Carlson makes on its show, as he often engages in &quot;exaggeration&quot; and &quot;non-literal commentary&quot;, and that Carlson is not &quot;stating actual facts&quot; on its show.

Beginning the week of June 8–14, 2020, &quot;Tucker Carlson Tonight&quot; became the highest-rated cable news show in the U.S., with an average of four million viewers, beating out the shows hosted by fellow Fox News pundits Hannity and Laura Ingraham. This came in the wake of Carlson&#x27;s remarks criticizing the Black Lives Matter movement, which had caused some companies to pull their advertising from the show, including The Walt Disney Company, , and Papa John&#x27;s.

In July 2020, Carlson&#x27;s head writer Blake Neff resigned after CNN Business reported that he had been using a pseudonym to post remarks that were widely described as racist, sexist, and homophobic on AutoAdmit, a message board known for its lack of moderation of offensive and defamatory content. The incident drew renewed scrutiny to Carlson&#x27;s program, already under pressure from sponsors because of Carlson&#x27;s remarks about Black Lives Matter. Neff had also previously been a writer on &quot;The Daily Caller&quot;. Carlson condemned Neff&#x27;s posts on the second episode of &quot;Tucker Carlson Tonight&quot; that aired after the posts were initially reported.

By October 2020, &quot;Tucker Carlson Tonight&quot; averaged 5.3 million viewers, with the show&#x27;s monthly average becoming the highest of any cable news program in history at that point. In the 25–54 demographic, the show maintained an average viewership of just over a million, with 670,000 being between 18 and 49. Carlson&#x27;s program saw a dip in viewership following the aftermath of the 2020 election, losing out to &quot;Anderson Cooper 360°&quot; in the 25–54 demographic, which Carlson had maintained a hold of the prior month. In 2020, &quot;Tucker Carlson Tonight&quot; and &quot;The Sean Hannity Show&quot; became the first cable news programs to finish a full year with viewership in excess of four million.

In the week following the inauguration of Joe Biden as president, &quot;Tucker Carlson Tonight&quot; remained the only cable news program not to see a drop in viewership, slightly increasing from where it stood one week prior and reclaiming its lead among the 25–54 demographic. It remained the most-watched news-related cable show as of mid-2021. Through May 2022 it was a close second to &quot;The Five&quot;, while leading in the 25–54 demographic.

==== &quot;Tucker Carlson Today&quot; ====
In February 2021, Carlson announced a multiyear deal with Fox News to host a new weekly podcast and series of monthly specials dubbed &quot;Tucker Carlson Originals&quot; on sister streaming service Fox Nation, which released on March 29. In spring of 2021, he began hosting a show on Fox Nation called &quot;Tucker Carlson Today&quot;.

==== Departure from Fox News ====
On the morning of Monday, April 24, 2023, Fox News dismissed Carlson and the executive producer of his evening show. It does not appear that Carlson received advance notice of his dismissal, given that on Friday, April 21, in what became his final show&#x27;s sign-off, he told his viewers that he would &quot;be back on Monday&quot;. As of October 2023, a rotation of guest hosts fill Carlson&#x27;s old slot until a permanent replacement is found. On April 26, Carlson responded to his departure by tweeting a video that was watched millions of times.&lt;ref name=&quot;newrepublic/172274&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Fox did not provide a reason for Carlson&#x27;s termination. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that Chairman of Fox Corporation Rupert Murdoch was responsible for the firing, and that a pending lawsuit from former Fox producer Abby Grossberg and Carlson&#x27;s coverage of the January 6 U.S. Capitol insurrection both influenced the decision. The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote that Carlson was dismissed due to private messages in which he criticized Fox&#x27;s management, using vulgar and offensive language. In May, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that in one such message Carlson expressed racist views by criticizing three Trump supporters who were beating one antifa activist: &quot;It&#x27;s not how white men fight.&quot; Less than a week before his ouster Fox retained law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz to investigate Tucker over this and potentially other messages due to liability concerns. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the decision to oust Carlson was made by Murdoch&#x27;s son, Lachlan, and Fox CEO Suzanne Scott. Fox was reported to have a &quot;stockpile&quot; of damaging information that they would be ready to release in case of any retaliation made by Carlson; the network denied this, however.

===&quot;Tucker on Twitter&quot; / &quot;Tucker on X&quot; (since 2023)===
In a video on his Twitter feed on May 9, 2023, Carlson said he would relaunch his show on Twitter. Just before making the announcement, Carlson&#x27;s attorneys sent a letter to Fox executives, alleging that Rupert Murdoch and other senior executives &quot;intentionally&quot; broke their promises to him, an alleged breach of contract that he says ought to free him from his non-compete clause. Fox News reportedly sent him a cease and desist after the first episode aired.

The first episode of the show, called &quot;Tucker on Twitter&quot;, was released on June 6, 2023 and lasted just over 10 minutes. During the episode, Carlson claimed that the US had recovered an extraterrestrial starship and its pilot; that Volodymyr Zelensky is &quot;sweaty and rat-like&quot;, and was persecuting Christians; that the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam was done by Ukrainian forces; that the Black Lives Matter riots were organized by an unknown entity; and that the truth behind the September 11 attacks was still classified.

In June 2023, he was reportedly seeking funds to start a new media company with Neil Patel.

On August 23, 2023, Carlson hosted Donald Trump on &quot;Tucker on X&quot;, the re-branded name of Twitter, deliberately to conflict with the first 2024 Republican debate. On September 6, 2023, Carlson interviewed Larry Sinclair, who had a criminal record, largely for crimes of deceit and who claimed that he had &quot;had a night of crack cocaine-fueled sex with Barack Obama&quot; 24 years before. The interview was criticized by many, including Elon Musk, owner of X.

He launched the streaming service Tucker Carlson Network in December, with both ad-supported and subscription-based content. Initially planned for Twitter/X, Musk&#x27;s company was unable to deliver the needed technology. Justin Wells, a former executive producer at Fox for Carlson, will oversee programming.

====Vladimir Putin interview====
Carlson traveled to Russia in February 2024 to interview President Vladimir Putin, whom he &quot;has been an outspoken defender of&quot;. It was Putin&#x27;s first one-on-one interview with a Western journalist since he launched the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Carlson said that while Ukraine&#x27;s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy had been given a platform, &quot;not a single Western journalist has bothered to interview the president of the other country involved in this conflict, Vladimir Putin&quot;. This sparked backlash from American and European journalists, who pointed out that they had repeatedly been denied interviews with Putin, and that some had been expelled. The Kremlin Press Secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said Carlson had been allowed an interview because &quot;his position is different&quot;, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s not pro-Russian, not pro-Ukrainian, it&#x27;s pro-American. It starkly contrasts with the stance of traditional Anglo-Saxon media&quot;.

Some independent Russian journalists were angered by Carlson&#x27;s words, noting that at least 1,000 independent journalists had fled Russia due to new censorship laws that ban criticism of the war. They also highlighted that two American journalists were currently imprisoned by Russia: Evan Gershkovich of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and Alsu Kurmasheva of Radio Free Europe.

After the death of prominent Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny in a Russian prison days after the interview, Carlson faced fresh criticism for holding the interview with Putin and saying that &quot;leadership requires killing people&quot;. Carlson called Navalny&#x27;s death &quot;barbaric and awful&quot; in a statement to &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

=== &quot;The Tucker Carlson Show&quot; (since 2024) ===

In May 2024, Carlson launched the weekly commentary podcast &quot;The Tucker Carlson Show&quot;. At its launch, &quot;Slate&quot; wrote that Carlson had diminished popularity. Quickly, though, Carlson regained his popularity, and &quot;The Tucker Carlson Show&quot; soon became one of the highest-rating political podcasts; it was the #1 most popular on Spotify in July 2024.

On September 2, 2024, Carlson hosted podcaster and amateur historian Darryl Cooper on &quot;Tucker on X&quot;. Without correction or contradiction from Carlson, Cooper endorsed Holocaust denial and otherwise departed from the historical consensus regarding World War II, causing controversy. Cooper called Winston Churchill &quot;the chief villain&quot; of World War II and claimed that the Nazis did not intentionally perpetrate the Holocaust.

Three days after the interview, White House senior deputy press secretary Andrew Bates condemned Carlson for &quot;giving a microphone to a Holocaust denier who spreads Nazi propaganda&quot;. On September 9, all 24 Democratic Jewish members of Congress issued a joint statement saying that they were &quot;appalled that Tucker Carlson hosted and promoted Nazi apologist and Holocaust denier Darryl Cooper on his podcast&quot;. Republican congressman Mike Lawler (who is not Jewish) said in his own condemnation of Carlson that &quot;platforming known Holocaust revisionists is deeply disturbing.&quot;

== Writing ==
Carlson authored the memoir &quot;Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News&quot;, published by Warner Books in September 2003, about his television news experiences. It received favorable reviews from &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; and the &quot;Washingtonian&quot;, who both complimented the book for its humor.

In May 2017, Carlson, represented by the literary and creative agency Javelin, signed an eight-figure, two-book deal with Simon &amp; Schuster&#x27;s conservative imprint, Threshold Editions. His first book in the series, &quot;Ship of Fools: How a Selfish Ruling Class is Bringing America to the Brink of Revolution&quot;, was released in October 2018, and debuted at No.1 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. His second book, &quot;The Long Slide: Thirty Years in American Journalism&quot;, was released in August 2021.

In 2023, a biography of Carlson titled &quot;Tucker&quot; was released. The book was written by Chadwick Moore with the help of Carlson, who had given the author more than 100 hours of interviews. Moore had stated that the book was intended to tell the story of Carlson&#x27;s exit from Fox News from the former host&#x27;s perspective. The book performed poorly, with just over 3,000 copies sold during the first week after its release.

==Political views==

Carlson has been described in the media as a conservative, paleoconservative, right-wing extremist, and far-right. In 2021, &quot;Time&quot; magazine said Carlson &quot;may be the most powerful conservative in America&quot;. Writing for &quot;New York&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Intelligencer&quot; in 2019, Park MacDougald called Carlson a &quot;Middle American radical&quot;, which he described as someone who holds populist economic beliefs; hostility to corporatocracy; fervent positions on nationalism, race, and immigration; and a preference for a strong U.S. president. MacDougald identified this form of radicalism as the ideological core of Trumpism. Carlson is noted for circulating white nationalist views and terminology into mainstream political discourse, in particular, repackaging the fringe racist &quot;replacement&quot; conspiracy theory into a version that accuses Democrats and &quot;elites&quot; of forcing demographic change. More virulent versions of the conspiracy theory have been cited by gunmen in several mass shootings targeting minorities; Carlson has denounced the attacks.

Carlson is a Republican. He was previously registered as a Democrat in Washington, D.C., from 2006 to 2020. In 2017, Carlson said his registration as a Democrat was to gain the right to vote in the primaries for mayoral elections in the district, and that he nevertheless &quot;sincerely despise[s]&quot; the Democratic Party and &quot;always vote[d] for the more corrupt candidate over the idealist&quot; in order to favor the status quo and stem progressivism. Carlson campaigned for Republicans and Republican-affiliated causes during his time as a Democrat.

===Parties and candidates===
In public correspondence in &quot;Slate&quot; with &quot;Texas Monthly&quot;″s Evan Smith on November 29, 1999, Carlson agreed with Smith&#x27;s low opinion of Donald Trump, who was then running for president with the Reform Party. Carlson wrote that Trump was &quot;the single most repulsive person on the planet&quot; and that the Reform Party consisted of &quot;a bunch of wackos&quot;. Separately, he criticized the party&#x27;s eventual nominee, Pat Buchanan. In his 2018 book, &quot;Ship of Fools&quot;, Carlson wrote that he had adopted some of Buchanan&#x27;s views.

Carlson voted for George W. Bush in the 2000 election. Carlson told &quot;Salon&quot; in 2003 that some Washington conservatives suspected he was &quot;secretly liberal&quot; because he liked John McCain. Carlson said in an interview, &quot;by my criteria, Bush isn&#x27;t much of a conservative&quot;. Carlson did not vote in the 2004 election, citing his souring on the Iraq War, his disillusionment with the once small-government Republican Party, and his disappointment with Bush and like-minded conservatives.

Carlson was reportedly floated as a potential candidate for the Libertarian nomination in the 2008 presidential election. He was included in polling at the 2008 Libertarian National Convention, with unconfirmed speculation arising that he was personally funding the effort. Carlson spoke at Ron Paul&#x27;s independent Rally for the Republic convention, opposite the official 2008 Republican National Convention, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, which served as a &quot;message of revolt to the Republican Party&quot; and a general celebration of Paul&#x27;s policy proposals.

He expressed his disappointment with the Republican nominee for the 2012 election, Mitt Romney, and the health care reform he signed in 2006 as governor of Massachusetts, which contained an individual mandate, saying, &quot;out of 315 million Americans, the Republican Party managed to find the one guy who couldn&#x27;t run on Obamacare.&quot;

Writing for &quot;Politico&quot; in January 2016, Carlson expressed his support for Donald Trump&#x27;s candidacy and his positions, such as his proposed &quot;Muslim ban&quot;, and criticized the other Republican candidates for not similarly making immigration a core issue. During the Trump presidency, Carlson was described in &quot;Politico&quot; as &quot;perhaps the highest-profile proponent of &#x27;Trumpism&#x27;a blend of anti-immigrant nationalism, economic populism and America First isolationism&quot;. Carlson&#x27;s commentaries did not uniformly praise Trump, but he had frequent scorn for Trump&#x27;s critics; some commentators called Carlson an exemplar of &quot;anti-anti-Trump&quot; arguments. In March 2023, Carlson defended Trump after he was indicted in New York, calling the indictment &quot;election interference&quot;. Despite his praise for Trump, he has at times been critical. Carlson criticized the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, ordered by Trump in January 2020 and said in June 2020 that Trump had let Black Lives Matter protests go too far. In private correspondence, he referred to Trump as a &quot;demonic force&quot; and wrote, &quot;I hate him passionately&quot;.

Following the 2020 election, Carlson reportedly told people he had voted for independent candidate Kanye West, though &quot;Politico&quot; points out that it was unclear whether Carlson &quot;was serious or merely joking&quot;. In July 2021, Carlson told &quot;Time&quot; magazine that the Republican Party is &quot;inept and bad at governing&quot; and &quot;much more effective as an oppositional force than it is as a governing party&quot;.

Carlson supported J. D. Vance in the 2022 Republican U.S. Senate primary in Ohio and privately persuaded Trump to endorse him despite Vance&#x27;s past anti-Trump comments. Former Hawaii congresswoman and Democratic presidential primary contender Tulsi Gabbard was a substitute host on &quot;Tucker Carlson Tonight&quot; in 2022; she appeared on the show the night she left the Democratic Party in October 2022, to Carlson&#x27;s praise.

=== Abortion ===
Carlson opposes abortion and has said it is the only political issue he considers non-negotiable. Carlson has described &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; as &quot;the most embarrassing court decision handed down in the last century&quot;.

In 2024, Carlson dismissed the link between climate change and the increased frequency and intensity of hurricanes, attributing it instead to abortion.

=== Death penalty ===
Carlson wrote in 2000 that capital punishment &quot;deserves more vigorous debate&quot;, and in 2003 told &quot;Salon&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m opposed to the death penalty as I am adamantly opposed to abortion&quot;. After saying on Fox News in 2010 that Michael Vick &quot;should have been executed&quot; for dog fighting, Carlson stated that he is &quot;not comfortable with the death penalty under any circumstances&quot;.

=== Guns ===
Carlson supports the right to keep and bear arms. He has opposed gun control and the assault weapons ban. He has debated several Democrats on gun control. In 2015, he said Australian gun laws were &quot;insane&quot; and &quot;childish&quot;. In March 2018, he criticized Donald Trump for comments supporting gun control after the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. In a 2019 interview, Carlson said he owns an AR-15 style rifle and said &quot;all my guns are working-class guns&quot;. He has a concealed carry permit in the District of Columbia.

Carlson aired segments defending Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old who shot three protesters, killing two, in August 2020 in confrontations during unrest after a police shooting in Kenosha, Wisconsin. At trial, Rittenhouse was found not guilty on all charges.

===Economics===
Early in his career, Carlson supported libertarian economics. He supported Ron Paul&#x27;s 1988 presidential candidacy, when Paul ran as the candidate for the Libertarian Party, along with his 2008 presidential candidacy, when Paul ran as a Republican. Carlson said in 2004, &quot;I hate all nanny-state regulations, such as seat belt laws and smoking bans.&quot; From 2009 through 2015, Carlson was a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.

Since 2018, he has promoted more populist economics, attacking libertarianism, saying &quot;market capitalism is not a religion&quot; and portraying some Republicans as &quot;controlled by the banks&quot;. In an interview, he said that economic and technological change that occurs too quickly can cause widespread social and political upheaval, and praised President Theodore Roosevelt, saying his intervention in the economy in the early 1900s may have prevented a communist revolution in the United States. In 2019 on &quot;Tucker Carlson Tonight&quot;, Carlson said America&#x27;s &quot;ruling class&quot; are, in effect, the &quot;mercenaries&quot; behind the decline of the American middle class, and &quot;any economic system that weakens and destroys families is not worth having. A system like that is the enemy of a healthy society.&quot; He cited parallels between the problems of inner cities and rural areas as evidence that the &quot;culture of poverty&quot; cited by conservatives as the cause of urban decline &quot;wasn&#x27;t the whole story&quot;, and that &quot;Certain economic systems allow families to thrive. Thriving families make market economies possible.&quot; In January 2019, Carlson used a &quot;Washington Post&quot; op-ed by Romney to criticize what he described as the &quot;mainstream Republican&quot; worldview, consisting of &quot;unwavering support for a finance-based economy.

Carlson has criticized hedge funds (singling out the Republican donor Paul Singer in 2019) and private equity (in criticizing Mitt Romney, former CEO of Bain Capital). He described the business model of firms like Bain as: &quot;Take over an existing company for a short period of time, cut costs by firing employees, run up the debt, extract the wealth and move on, sometimes leaving retirees without their earned pensions. ... Meanwhile, a remarkable number of the companies are now bankrupt or extinct.&quot; He attacked payday lenders, saying they &quot;loan people money they can&#x27;t possibly repay&quot; and &quot;charge them interest that impoverishes them&quot; He praised Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren&#x27;s economic plan and called her book &quot;The Two Income Trap&quot; &quot;one of the best books I&#x27;ve ever read on economics&quot;.

=== Environment ===
On his show, Carlson frequently hosts guests who downplay the scientific consensus on climate change, and disagreed with Bill Nye on the subject. Carlson has also said that he does not consider climate change a threat. Carlson argues that global warming will have many positive effects on Earth, namely &quot;more arable land in places like Canada and northern Europe&quot;.

In 2023, Carlson, Clean Ocean Action, and multiple Republicans criticized New Jersey and New York&#x27;s use of wind power, falsely claiming that it has been contributing to the deaths of whales.

===Foreign policy===
Carlson is skeptical of foreign intervention, has expressed regret for his public support of the U.S. invading Iraq in 2003, and has said &quot;the U.S. ought to hesitate before intervening abroad&quot;. Carlson is known for some defenses of authoritarian foreign leaders, including President Vladimir Putin of Russia, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, and Prime minister Viktor Orbán of Hungary. Carlson was noted for defending Putin in the lead-up to Russia&#x27;s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Carlson&#x27;s praise for Orbán included a visit and his online film &quot;Hungary vs. Soros&quot;.

====Russia====
Carlson is sympathetic to Russian president Vladimir Putin, has defended Putin&#x27;s Russia, and has promoted pro-Russian disinformation and propaganda.

Carlson said he does not consider Russia a serious threat to the United States, and called for the United States to work with Russia in the Syrian Civil War against a common enemy like the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). He asserts that Putin does not hate the United States as much as American liberals do, and suggested there is no reason to dislike Putin, asking his viewers to consider whether Putin has ever called them racist or threatened to get them fired for disagreeing with him. Carlson said it is &quot;not treason, it is not un-American&quot; to support Putin.

In 2019, while discussing U.S. military aid to Ukraine during the Donbas War, Carlson said on his show: &quot;Why shouldn&#x27;t I root for Russia? Which I &quot;am&quot;&quot;. At the end of the show, he claimed to have been joking. Afterwards, he explained: &quot;I think we should probably take the side of Russia if we have to choose between Russia and Ukraine&quot;.

In early 2022, Carlson downplayed Russia&#x27;s military buildup on Ukraine&#x27;s borders as a &quot;border dispute&quot;. Although Carlson called the Russian invasion of Ukraine &quot;awful&quot; and acknowledged Putin&#x27;s responsibility, he has promoted pro-Russian disinformation since then, such as a Russian conspiracy theory that the U.S. and Kyiv were developing biological weapons in Ukraine. Many of Carlson&#x27;s broadcasts have been used by Russian state media to support their messaging, and &quot;Mother Jones&quot; reported that the Kremlin sent a memo to state media outlets saying it was &quot;essential&quot; to use video clips of Carlson &quot;as much as possible&quot;. &quot;Mother Jones&quot; further observed Carlson was the only Western media pundit that the Kremlin adopted in this way.

Carlson&#x27;s views of Putin&#x27;s Russia have changed markedly since the 2000s. Back then, he agreed that Russia was becoming a &quot;police state&quot; where &quot;freedom of the press is disappearing&quot;, and said that Putin was &quot;in league with our enemies&quot;.

Peter Beinart of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; said Carlson has been an &quot;apologist for Donald Trump on the Russia scandal&quot;. Carlson described the controversy over revelations that Donald Trump Jr. was willing to accept opposition research about Hillary Clinton from a Russian government official as a &quot;new level of hysteria&quot; and said that Trump Jr. had only been &quot;gossiping with foreigners&quot;.

After the death of prominent Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny in a Russian prison days after the interview, Carlson faced fresh criticism for holding the interview with Putin and saying that &quot;leadership requires killing people&quot;. Carlson called Navalny&#x27;s death &quot;barbaric and awful&quot; in a statement to &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

==== Iraq ====
Carlson initially supported the Iraq War. A year after the invasion of Iraq, he began criticizing the war, telling &quot;The New York Observer&quot;: &quot;I think it&#x27;s a total nightmare and disaster, and I&#x27;m ashamed that I went against my own instincts in supporting it.&quot; In 2004, Carlson wrote a commentary in &quot;Esquire&quot; accusing Bush of weakness after the September 11 attacks and in the invasion of Iraq. Carlson said &quot;Iraq is a crappy place filled with a bunch of, you know, semi-literate primitive monkeys, that’s why it wasn’t worth invading.&quot;.

==== Iran ====
In July 2017, Carlson said that &quot;we actually don&#x27;t face any domestic threat from Iran&quot;. He asked Max Boot to &quot;tell me how many Americans in the United States have been murdered by terrorists backed by Iran since 9/11?&quot; According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Carlson played an influential role in dissuading Trump from launching military strikes against Iran in response to the shooting down of an American drone in June 2019. Carlson reportedly told Trump that if he listened to his hawkish advisors and went ahead with the strikes, he would not win re-election. In 2019, Carlson lobbied Donald Trump to fire his national security advisor, John Bolton. Carlson said Bolton was &quot;demented&quot; for seeking a military strike against Iran and accused him of undermining Trump by disagreeing publicly with Trump&#x27;s decisions. Trump fired Bolton on September 10, 2019. Carlson called the 2020 assassination of Qasem Soleimani a &quot;quagmire&quot;. He criticized the &quot;chest-beaters&quot; who promote foreign interventions, particularly Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE), and asked, &quot;By the way, if we&#x27;re still in Afghanistan, 19 years, sad years, later, what makes us think there&#x27;s a quick way out of Iran?&quot;

==== Syria ====
Carlson opposes overthrowing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and has downplayed some of the Assad regime&#x27;s human rights violations in the Syrian Civil War. In April 2018, Carlson questioned whether Assad was responsible for the Douma chemical attack that had occurred a few days earlier and killed dozens. In November 2019, Carlson repeated this claim and queried whether the attack had happened at all. Carlson suggested that a similar attack that occurred the year before (the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack), which was attributed to Assad&#x27;s forces and which the OPCW JIM indicated was carried out with sarin that bore the regime&#x27;s signature, was a false flag attack perpetrated to falsely implicate the Assad government. Carlson compared Assad&#x27;s war crimes during the Syrian Civil War to Saudi Arabia&#x27;s war crimes in Yemen.

==== Israel ====
In 2006, Carlson appeared live from Israel during the 2006 Lebanon War between Israel and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. Early on in the conflict, Carlson proposed that Lebanon fight and push out Hezbollah instead of going to war with Israel. During the conflict, he criticized Syria&#x27;s involvement in the conflict in supporting Hezbollah and later expressed some support for the Israel Defense Forces. However, he also criticized the tactics used by the Israel Defense Forces in fighting Hezbollah.

During the Israel–Hamas war, Carlson criticized both President Joe Biden and Republican House speaker Mike Johnson for their support for military aid to Israel and called for American neutrality during the conflict. He declared Israel guilty of war crimes. Commentators have described him as part of a growing faction within the Republican Party that is either indifferent, or directly opposed, to Zionism.

====Hungary====

In August 2021, Carlson traveled to Hungary, broadcasting from Budapest. He praised the country and its prime minister, Viktor Orbán, for rejecting asylum seekers on its border, and ridiculed the idea that Orbán was authoritarian. He spoke at a conference sponsored by the Mathias Corvinus Collegium. In January 2022, Carlson released the film &quot;Hungary vs. Soros&quot; on Fox Nation. According to &quot;Vox&quot;, it promoted conspiracy theories about Soros and suggested that criticism of the Hungarian government was a function of jealousy from the political left. The Open Society Foundations, a group founded by Soros, called the film &quot;anti-American propaganda&quot;, and its Vice President Laura Silber stated that &quot;Carlson appears to prefer authoritarian rule, state capture of media and the courts, crony corruption and rigged elections.&quot;

==== Mexico ====
Carlson supported Trump&#x27;s expansion of the Mexico–United States border wall, saying a wall was needed to &quot;restore sovereignty&quot; to the border.

In a July 2018 interview about Russian involvement in U.S. elections, Carlson claimed that Mexico had interfered in U.S. elections &quot;more successfully&quot; than Russia by &quot;packing our electorate&quot; through mass immigration. This assertion was disputed by journalist Philip Bump, who wrote that the number of Mexicans in the U.S. had decreased since 2009 and asked rhetorically: &quot;What good has it done Mexico to have a number of its citizens move to the United States and gain the right to vote?&quot;

In May 2019, Carlson defended Trump&#x27;s decision to place tariffs on Mexico unless Mexico stopped illegal immigration to the United States. Carlson said, &quot;When the United States is attacked by a hostile foreign power it must strike back, and make no mistake Mexico is a hostile foreign power.&quot;

==== El Salvador ====
Carlson has visited El Salvador on three occasions, twice under Nayib Bukele&#x27;s administration, and routinely defended his strongman policies to reduce crime and combat the MS-13 gangs.

==== North Korea ====
In June 2019, when President Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong-un at the Korean Demilitarized Zone, Carlson, who was touring with Trump, defended Trump&#x27;s friendship with Kim. Carlson told &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; that the North Korean regime was &quot;monstrous&quot; and North Korea was a &quot;disgusting place&quot; but &quot;On the other hand, you&#x27;ve got to be honest about what it means to lead a country. It means killing people&quot;. Carlson went on to argue that &quot;a lot of countries commit atrocities including a number that we&#x27;re closely allied with&quot;.

==== China ====
Carlson has said normalization of relations with China following President Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1972 visit led to unforeseen consequences, and that America became progressively worse off for it. He criticized LeBron James for speaking out against Daryl Morey, the latter having tweeted in support of the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, and referred to the former CEO of The Walt Disney Company, Bob Iger, as a &quot;propagandist&quot; for the Chinese Communist Party.

On November 20, 2020, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Steve Bannon and Chinese businessman Guo Wengui had brought Li-Meng Yan to America to promote the COVID-19 lab leak theory, a theory that states COVID-19 was made in a Chinese laboratory and then escaped from the lab. Bannon and Guo set up appearances for Yan on Carlson&#x27;s show to promote the theory. Carlson would later say that he did not endorse her theories. Nonetheless, Carlson still hosted her on his show for a second appearance.

==== Colonialism ====
In March 2021, Carlson stated that issues like the Latin American immigration crisis should be blamed on &quot;other colonial powers centuries ago&quot; instead of the United States, and suggested that the Spanish government, having a &quot;legacy responsibility for what is happening in Latin America&quot;, should start by &quot;sending back the gold now sitting in its central bank.&quot; Carlson&#x27;s statements on Spain were criticized by Hermann Tertsch and Mamela Fiallo for supporting the Spanish Black Legend, though Fiallo&#x27;s rebuttal article in &quot;La Gaceta&quot; was retracted in November 2023 after Carlson appeared with Santiago Abascal in support of the 2023 Spanish protests.

After the death of Queen Elizabeth II in September 2022, Carlson opined that the British Empire, although &quot;not perfect&quot;, had brought civilization to regions it occupied with &quot;decency unmatched by any empire in human history&quot;. He was criticized in India by figures including the politician and historian Shashi Tharoor, who had written a book detailing atrocities by the British Raj.

===Immigration and race===
Carlson is a frequent critic of immigration, and has been described by multiple writers as demonizing both documented and undocumented immigrants. White grievance politics is a persistent theme in Carlson&#x27;s commentary. Sources such as CNN and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; have said Carlson promotes racism, a charge he denies, saying in 2018, &quot;I&#x27;m not a racist. I hate racism.&quot; Carlson has repeatedly promoted a conspiracy theory that Democrats are seeking &quot;demographic replacement&quot; to increase their voter base, and in 2021 he described this as &quot;the Great Replacement&quot;, using white nationalist terminology. Carlson has described white supremacy as &quot;not a real problem in America&quot;. Heidi Beirich of the Southern Poverty Law Center has said that &quot;Carlson probably has been the No.1 commentator mainstreaming bedrock principles of white nationalism in [the U.S.].&quot; Terry Smith, a law professor at St. Thomas University, has called Carlson&#x27;s rhetoric an example of white identity politics. University of Michigan professor Alexandra Stern has written that Carlson propagates demographic fear. Neoconservative pundit Bill Kristol described Carlson&#x27;s commentaries in 2018 as &quot;close now to racism&quot; and &quot;ethno-nationalism of some kind, let&#x27;s call it&quot;.

==== Racism and white supremacy ====
Carlson has compared the Obama administration&#x27;s stance on anti-police protests to Nazism for &quot;[categorizing] people by race&quot;, and he has alleged that the George Floyd protests were about &quot;ideological domination&quot; rather than police brutality. The latter comment prompted several advertisers to boycott his program. Carlson has falsely claimed that Floyd was not killed by officer Derek Chauvin and that Chauvin was only found guilty because the jurors felt threatened by rioters.

When Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee for president, denounced Trump in March 2016, saying Trump made a &quot;disqualifying and disgusting response&quot; by evading questions about former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke&#x27;s support, Carlson criticized Romney and dismissed his speech by suggesting &quot;Obama could have written this.&quot;

==== Criticisms of racism ====
After Neff, his head writer, was fired for hateful blog posts in 2020, Carlson said of the posts, &quot;They have no connection to the show. It is wrong to attack people for qualities they cannot control.&quot; Separately, Carlson said in 2017 that he does not approve of white supremacy. In 2018, he criticized China&#x27;s treatment of Muslims.

In 2022, in response to &quot;The New York Times&quot; publishing a report criticizing Carlson and his show, Carlson said that his show did not have a controversial opinion on race, saying &quot;Our view of race is really simple. We believe Martin Luther King Jr. We don&#x27;t think your skin color is the most important thing about you. We think all people were created by God and should therefore be judged by what they do, not by how they look.&quot; Carlson has also offered praise for Malcolm X, saying that unlike other civil rights leaders, Malcolm X &quot;didn&#x27;t talk like a sharecropper. He spoke dignified standard English. He wasn&#x27;t running a shakedown racket to fleece guilty white liberals.&quot;

==== Views on Islam ====
Carlson is critical of Islam and has hosted guests on his program that criticize Islam. He has described the existence of an &quot;Islamic cult&quot; and an &quot;Islamic problem&quot;, describing it as a threat to the United States. He was critical of the Obama administration&#x27;s terrorism policy, arguing that it should have considered Islam as a cause of terrorism. In 2019, advocacy group Media Matters for America released recordings of racist comments that Carlson made in 2006 including that Iraq was not worth invading because he believed it to be a country made up of &quot;semi-literate primitive monkeys&quot; and &quot;lunatic Muslims who are behaving like animals&quot;.

==== Immigrants and the Great Replacement conspiracy theory ====
In 2018, Carlson described the effects of mass immigration on the United States using the terms &quot;dirtier&quot;, &quot;poorer&quot;, and &quot;more divided&quot; and said it &quot;has badly hurt this country&#x27;s natural landscape&quot;. On another 2018 episode, Carlson criticized multiculturalism in the United States, skeptically asking &quot;how, precisely, is diversity our strength?&quot; and whether any other institutions benefitted from a lack of commonalities. Talking about Hazleton, Pennsylvania, where Hispanics had quickly become a majority of the population, Carlson said it was &quot;more change than human beings are designed to digest&quot;. In May 2019 he said, &quot;The flood of illegal workers into the United States has damaged our communities, ruined our schools, burdened our healthcare system and fractured our national unity.&quot; In December 2019, he falsely claimed that immigrants were responsible for making the Potomac River &quot;dirtier and dirtier&quot;.

Carlson has accused Democrats of supporting increased immigration to change the racial demographics of the United States to increase the Democratic voter base. Commentators and organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) have described these views as endorsement of the Great Replacement conspiracy theory. Carlson has also accused President Joe Biden of engaging in eugenics and &quot;Great Replacement&quot; through a policy of increased immigration. Despite this, Carlson has challenged accusations that he believes the Great Replacement conspiracy theory, describing it as a &quot;voting rights question&quot;. He has also questioned the popularity of the conspiracy theory after it was invoked by multiple white supremacist mass shooters, including the 2019 El Paso shooting and the 2022 Buffalo shooting, contradicting his previous endorsement of the conspiracy theory and calling its existence a &quot;hoax&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCarthy_5/19/2022&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== South Africa ====
In August 2018, Carlson alleged that the South African government was targeting white farmers because &quot;they are the wrong skin color&quot; and falsely said the country&#x27;s president had changed the constitution to allow land thefts from whites during ongoing land reform efforts. CBS News, Associated Press, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; described Carlson&#x27;s segment (with guest Marian Tupy of the Cato Institute) as false or misleading, because violence against farmers had reached an all-time low and the reforms had yet to pass and were primarily aimed at land that had fallen into disuse.

Following the Carlson segment, President Trump tweeted that he had instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to &quot;closely study the South Africa land and farm seizure and large scale killing of farmers&quot;. The South African government responded that Trump&#x27;s tweet was &quot;misinformed&quot; and said it would address the matter through diplomatic channels. AfriForum, a South African non-governmental organization focused mainly on the interests of Afrikaners, took credit for Carlson&#x27;s and Trump&#x27;s statements, saying it believed that its campaign to influence American politics had succeeded.

The evening after the segment, Carlson acknowledged that the proposed amendment was still being debated and added that no farms had yet been expropriated, though he did not admit to having made errors. Carlson later said in an interview that his South Africa segment made &quot;an argument against tribalism&quot;.

==== Ilhan Omar ====
Carlson concluded &quot;Tucker Carlson Tonight&quot; on July 9, 2019, with a three-minute monologue about Representative Ilhan Omar (D-MN), who was born in Somalia and immigrated to the United States as a refugee as an adolescent. Carlson accused Omar of being ungrateful to the United States, and called her &quot;living proof that the way we practice immigration has become dangerous to this country&quot;. His monologue was described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;racially loaded&quot; and &quot;full of anti-immigrant rhetoric&quot;. Omar responded on Twitter, saying that &quot;advertisers should not be underwriting this kind of dangerous, hateful rhetoric&quot;. &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; commented that Carlson had devoted numerous segments to criticizing Omar, and that largely due to &quot;right-wing attacks that have then been amplified by members of Congress and the president&quot;, Omar had been receiving death threats since her election to Congress.

====Kanye West interview====
On the October 6 and 7, 2022 episodes of &quot;Tucker Carlson Tonight&quot;, Carlson aired an edited version of an interview with rapper and fashion designer Ye, also known by his birth name Kanye West. West and conservative commentator Candace Owens had recently been photographed at Paris Fashion Week wearing matching shirts that read &quot;White Lives Matter&quot;, a phrase often associated with white supremacist groups. In his interview with Carlson, West said he had worn the shirt because he found it &quot;funny&quot; and agreed with the message. When Carlson asked West about a badge West was wearing on a lanyard around his neck, West stated that it was an image from an obstetric ultrasound, and added, &quot;It just represents life. I&#x27;m pro-life&quot;; he claimed without evidence &quot;that there are more Black babies being aborted than born in New York City at this point.&quot;

On October 11, 2022, the &quot;Vice&quot; website &quot;Motherboard&quot; published leaked unaired footage from the interview. In the unaired footage, West expressed Black Hebrew Israelite views, stated he had received a COVID-19 vaccine, and claimed that paid child actors had been &quot;placed into [his] house to sexualize [his] kids&quot;; in one instance, referring to a Kwanzaa celebration at his children&#x27;s school, West said, &quot;I prefer my kids knew Hanukkah than Kwanzaa [sic]. At least it will come with some financial engineering.&quot; The leaked footage was heavily scrutinized in light of other antisemitic statements West had made on social media in the days after the &quot;Tucker Carlson Tonight&quot; interview aired, including an October 8 tweet in which he threatened to go &quot;death con 3 [sic]&quot; on Jewish people. Philip Bump of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that Carlson had presented &quot;a very specific version&quot; of West&#x27;s remarks that &quot;mirrored Carlson&#x27;s rhetoric on race and politics&quot;. Ben Samuels of &quot;Haaretz&quot; wrote that the episode &quot;brings Carlson&#x27;s history of providing a platform for antisemitism further into focus&quot;.

=== Gender and sexuality ===
Carlson is an opponent of feminism. In a December 2021 segment despairing the falling labor participation rate of U.S. men, Carlson said, &quot;Men and women are very different, extremely different. Society is built on their differences.&quot; He has alleged that feminists want girls to make gains at the expense of boys. He was rebuked by the U.S. military in March 2021 after he ridiculed maternity flight suits for U.S. women soldiers and described a decision by the Chinese military to build ships as &quot;more masculine&quot;. He used the words &quot;pig&quot; and &quot;cunt&quot; to describe several individual women in remarks from 2006 to 2011 on the radio show &quot;Bubba the Love Sponge&quot;. In 2022, Carlson released &quot;The End of Men&quot;, a &quot;Tucker Carlson Original&quot; alleging a decline in American masculinity. The episode featured Raw Egg Nationalist, a pseudonymous author affiliated with Neo-Nazi publishing house Antelope Hill. Carlson is critical of the use of SSRIs because of their impact on sexual drive.

Carlson has highlighted what he considers excesses of LGBT people on the political left. Some of his comments on air have been described as homophobic, including a 2006 radio conversation in which he and Bubba the Love Sponge used the word &quot;faggot&quot; to describe their affection for each other, and his 2007 description of an incident during high school of beating up a gay man who had made an advance on him in a public bathroom. In the same year, he called Democratic primary contenders cowards for not pledging to legalize same sex marriage and stated that he would support that. In 2021, Carlson belittled the paternity leave taken by U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, a gay man, joking that Buttigieg could be &quot;trying to figure out how to breastfeed&quot;. Carlson&#x27;s promotion of inflammatory rhetoric about LGBTQ controversies was scrutinized after the Colorado Springs nightclub mass shooting in November 2022. Carlson has strongly criticized the transgender rights movement, including saying hospitals that provide gender-affirming healthcare to minors are criminals who harm children, and that they should not be surprised to receive threatening phone calls.

In September 2023, Tucker Carlson interviewed a man who claimed to have had sex with Barack Obama.

=== COVID-19 pandemic and vaccines ===
Carlson differed with Trump and some of his colleagues at Fox News in early 2020 by saying COVID-19 should be taken more seriously in the U.S, and he reportedly influenced then-President Trump to take the virus more seriously. Carlson blamed China for causing the pandemic. By May 2020, Carlson began to publicly question the severity of the virus. Carlson criticized stay-at-home orders brought on by the pandemic and defended protests against lockdowns in rural areas. In February 2022, he supported the Canada convoy protest against COVID-19 restrictions and called it &quot;the single most successful human rights protest in a generation&quot;. He also claimed that some U.S. officials were overstating the deadliness of the virusa claim that PolitiFact called mostly false. Carlson mentioned the anti-parasite medication ivermectin as a possible COVID-19 treatment, though the FDA warned against its use.

Carlson has repeatedly misrepresented the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and asserted that U.S. officials were &quot;lying&quot; about them. He has falsely suggested that COVID-19 vaccines suppress the immune system, and he has misrepresented federal data to claim that 30 Americans died after receiving the vaccine each day, misleading his audience by citing the unverified VAERS database that included deaths from unrelated causes. He has likened vaccine passports to segregationist Jim Crow laws, and he claimed that a vaccine mandate in the U.S. Armed Forces was designed to oust &quot;the sincere Christians in the ranks, the free thinkers, the men with high testosterone levels, and anyone else who doesn&#x27;t love Joe Biden&quot;. He has also falsely claimed that the government was attempting to &quot;force people to take medicine they don&#x27;t want or need&quot; through door-to-door vaccines. Carlson says he has not been vaccinated against COVID-19.

Carlson routinely criticized National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci during Fauci&#x27;s tenure. This criticism included repeated false allegations that Fauci was responsible for the creation of COVID-19, with Carlson also falsely claiming that Fauci lied about the origin of COVID-19 to sell vaccines. According to Jon Cohen in &quot;Science&quot;, &quot;Carlson took facts out of context and cited long-debunked studies or reports to attack Fauci&quot;. Fauci responded to Carlson&#x27;s remarks by calling them a &quot;crazy conspiracy theory&quot;.

Carlson was a vocal critic of the use of face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic, calling people wearing masks outdoors &quot;zealots and neurotics&quot;. He received significant public backlash for his claim that having children wear face masks was tantamount to child abuse and that it warranted a response &quot;no different from your response to seeing someone beat a kid in Walmart&quot;. Carlson has pointed to the use of masks as evidence that vaccines do not work, falsely claiming that there would be no benefits to mask use with an effective vaccine.

=== 2020 election aftermath ===
Ahead of the 2020 election, in September, Carlson told viewers that Democrats were promoting mail-in voting to create &quot;uncertainty over the outcome of the election, so they can manipulate the results&quot;. After Joe Biden won the election in November, Carlson raised false allegations of fraud in the election. On his show, he mentioned the names of purportedly dead individuals who voted in Georgia; investigative reporting subsequently found that some of the individuals whom he claimed to be dead were in fact alive. Carlson apologized on his show for the error. Carlson distanced himself from Trump&#x27;s post-election legal fights, in which Carlson said the election was &quot;not fair&quot; but acknowledged that it still would not produce a Trump victory.

Later that month, Carlson cast doubt on unfounded conspiratorial claims made by former federal prosecutor Sidney Powell, who alleged that Venezuela, Cuba and unidentified communist interests had used a secret algorithm to hack into voting machines and commit widespread electoral fraud. Carlson said &quot;what Powell was describing would amount to the single greatest crime in American history&quot;, but that Powell became &quot;angry and told us to stop contacting her&quot; when he asked for evidence of widespread voter fraud. Prominent defenders of Trump criticized Carlson for his skepticism, though Powell was dropped from Trump&#x27;s legal team shortly afterward. Carlson later brought on Mike Lindell on January 26, 2021, whose company My Pillow was the largest advertiser on &quot;Tucker Carlson Tonight&quot;, to criticize Dominion Voting Systems and claim it had &quot;hired hit groups and bots and trolls&quot; to target him following his Twitter account&#x27;s permanent suspension for promoting unfounded fraud claims.

In July 2021, Carlson suggested that &quot;there actually was meaningful voter fraud in Fulton County, Georgia, last November&quot; despite the state&#x27;s election results being validated via both hand and machine recounts. PolitiFact found that none of the evidence provided by Carlson substantiated his conclusion. For example, because Trump and Biden ballots were sorted into separate piles during the hand recount, tally sheets with votes exclusively for either candidate are not indicative of fraud.

In August 2022, Carlson was deposed as part of a lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News over false claims of voter fraud made about the company. The following February, Dominion&#x27;s legal team released texts and other products of discovery against Fox, revealing that Carlson privately doubted the false claims that the 2020 election was stolen and mocked Trump advisors, including Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell. Carlson texted to Laura Ingraham, &quot;Sidney Powell is lying by the way. I caught her. It&#x27;s insane&quot; and &quot;Our viewers are good people and they believe it.&quot; Carlson also texted Sean Hannity, saying Fox News White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich should be fired for tweeting a fact-check of false claims Carlson and Trump circulated about Dominion. He wrote &quot;Please get her fired. Seriously ... What the fuck? I&#x27;m actually shocked ... It needs to stop immediately, like tonight. It&#x27;s measurably hurting the company. The stock price is down. Not a joke.&quot;, and said he &quot;just went crazy on&quot; a Fox executive over Heinrich&#x27;s reporting. Heinrich&#x27;s tweet was deleted by the next morning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stahl_2/17/2023&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Also published were texts of Carlson regarding Donald Trump, with Carlson stating: &quot;I hate him passionately&quot;. About Trump&#x27;s presidency, he texted: &quot;We&#x27;re all pretending we&#x27;ve got a lot to show for it, because admitting what a disaster it&#x27;s been is too tough to digest. But come on. There really isn&#x27;t an upside to Trump.&quot; In March 2023, Carlson said in an interview that he was &quot;enraged that my private texts were pulled&quot; for the court case, and asserted: &quot;I love Trump … I think Trump is funny and insightful.&quot;

==== 2021 U.S. Capitol attack ====
In February 2021, after attorney general nominee Merrick Garland pledged at his confirmation hearing to supervise the prosecution of &quot;white supremacists and others&quot; involved in the January 6 United States Capitol attack, Carlson alleged, &quot;There&#x27;s no evidence that white supremacists were responsible for what happened on January 6. That&#x27;s a lie.&quot; PolitiFact rated Carlson&#x27;s claim false, because several rioters had known ties to white supremacist groups, according to court records and congressional testimony by law enforcement leaders, and video and photos from the incident showed white supremacist symbols prominently displayed. Philip Bump of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote in an analysis that Carlson was blurring the lines between &quot;being involved&quot; and &quot;being responsible for&quot; to create a strawman in an effort to &quot;undercut the public understanding of what happened and, by extension, to soften the implications for Trump and his supporters&quot;. Carlson has also inaccurately stated that &quot;[n]ot a single person in the crowd on January 6 was found to be carrying a firearm.&quot;

In June 2021, Carlson promoted a conspiracy theory alleging that the Capitol storming was a &quot;false flag&quot; FBI operation intended to &quot;suppress political dissent&quot;. He alleged that unindicted co-conspirators in rioters&#x27; indictments were government agents, saying, &quot;FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on January 6, according to government documents&quot;. Legal experts said Carlson&#x27;s claim was unfounded because prosecutors cannot describe an undercover agent as an unindicted co-conspirator. One of the unindicted co-conspirators was readily identifiable as Stewart Rhodes, founder and leader of Oath Keepers, a far-right anti-government militia; another unindicted co-conspirator was likely the wife of an indicted alleged conspirator. Carlson&#x27;s guest, Darren Beattie of Revolver News, whose writing the segment was primarily based on, had been fired as a Trump speechwriter in 2018 after CNN asked the White House about his attendance at a gathering of white nationalists. Carlson also said Russian president Vladimir Putin raised &quot;fair questions&quot; when Putin mentioned the fatal police shooting of a rioter inside the Capitol while denying involvement in the poisoning of a Russian politician. Republican House members Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene quickly embraced Carlson&#x27;s story about FBI involvement in the Capitol attack, and Republican congressman Paul Gosar entered the Revolver News story into the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; during a House Oversight Committee hearing.

In response to Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley&#x27;s defense of studying critical race theory &quot;to understand white rage&quot; as it concerns the storming, Carlson said, &quot;Hard to believe that man wears a uniform. ... He&#x27;s not just a pig, he&#x27;s stupid!&quot;

After Carlson criticized Senator Ted Cruz for calling the Capitol storming a &quot;terrorist attack&quot;, Cruz appeared on Carlson&#x27;s show on January 6, 2022, the anniversary of the event, and apologized for his words.

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in early 2023 gave Carlson exclusive access to 44,000 hours of security surveillance video from the day of the Capitol attack. Carlson subsequently aired portions of it on his show to illustrate his own narrative concerning the event, painting it as &quot;peaceful chaos&quot; and condemning other media outlets as untruthful when portraying the attack as violent. The family of Brian Sicknick, a United States Capitol Police officer who died the day following the Capitol attack, and Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger condemned the segment, which also received reproach from Democratic and Republican politicians, including from the Republican leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell. Carlson&#x27;s presentation included video of Jacob Chansley — the &quot;QAnon Shaman&quot; — walking the halls of Congress, depicting him as a peaceful demonstrator being escorted by police who was unjustly prosecuted and incarcerated. Days after the presentation, Justice Department prosecutors stated in a court filing that the four minutes of video showed only a brief part of Chansley&#x27;s activity and omitted his earlier incriminating behavior, concluding, &quot;Chansley was not some passive, chaperoned observer of events for the roughly hour that he was unlawfully inside the Capitol.&quot;

Carlson repeatedly promoted a conspiracy theory that pro-Trump protestor Ray Epps was actually a federal agent engaged in a false flag operation to instigate the January 6 attack. Epps said he and his wife were subjected to threats and harassment, leading them to sell their home and business to go into hiding in another state. An attorney for Epps wrote Carlson in March 2023 demanding a public retraction of &quot;false and defamatory statements.&quot;

====Patriot Purge program====
In late October 2021, &quot;Patriot Purge&quot;, a three-part series produced by Carlson, was released on the Fox Nation streaming service. Carlson broadcast a trailer that suggested the January 6 attack was a government false flag operation to implicate the right wing, with one speaker asserting that &quot;the left is hunting the right&quot;. Carlson stated on-air that the government had &quot;launched a new war&quot; on American citizens and characterized his series as &quot;rock-solid factually&quot;. Fact-checkers found the series contained numerous falsehoods and conspiracy theories. Michael Jensen, a senior researcher at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, called it &quot;political propaganda that is meant to rally a support base that has shown a willingness to mobilize on the basis of disinformation and lies. That&#x27;s how we got Jan. 6 in the first place.&quot; Conservative writers Jonah Goldberg and Steve Hayes responded to the series by severing their ties to Fox News, declaring that the series was &quot;a collection of incoherent conspiracy-mongering, riddled with factual inaccuracies, half-truths, deceptive imagery, and damning omissions&quot;. Bret Baier and Chris Wallace, prominent anchors in the network&#x27;s news division, raised objections to the series to top executives of the Fox organization.

=== Alleged surveillance ===
In October 2020, Carlson alleged on his show that someone was reading his text messages, after documents he claimed had compromising information on Joe Biden&#x27;s son, Hunter, were lost by the United Parcel Service and then quickly located. Carlson did not say what these documents contained. In November 2021, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; published emails from a laptop owned by Hunter Biden, which appear to demonstrate a friendship between himself and Carlson.

On June 28, 2021, Carlson said on his program that &quot;a whistleblower within the U.S. government&quot; informed him that the National Security Agency (NSA) was &quot;monitoring our electronic communications and is planning to leak them in an attempt to take this show off the air&quot;, adding, &quot;The Biden administration is spying on us. We have confirmed that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beech_6/30/2021&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; That same day, a producer for Carlson filed an unusually broad Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with the NSA, seeking records, including &quot;any communication between NSA officials regarding journalist Tucker Carlson&quot;, dating back to January 2019, before Biden became president. On June 29, the NSA tweeted a rare statement of denial, stating that Carlson has never been a target of its surveillance and it never had any intent to have his program taken off the air. Carlson responded on-air that the NSA did not deny reading his emails. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy asked House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes to investigate.

&quot;Axios&quot; reported on July 7 that, shortly before Carlson made his allegation, he had been in contact with U.S.-based Kremlin intermediaries to arrange an interview with Vladimir Putin. The reporter of the &quot;Axios&quot; exclusive story, Jonathan Swan, later confirmed he had contacted Carlson seeking pre-publication comment, but said he had not told Carlson that anyone had shared the email contents with him. On that night&#x27;s program, Carlson said that he had contacted people about interviewing Putin, but did not mention it to anyone because he did not want to &quot;rattle the Russians, and make the interview less likely to happen&quot;. He said that the NSA had unmasked his identity and that &quot;the contents of my emails left that building at the NSA and wound up with a news organization&quot;. On July 23, cybersecurity news website The Record wrote that Carlson had not been targeted by the NSA but had been unmasked after he was mentioned by third parties who were under surveillance, citing two anonymous sources. Fox News called the reported act &quot;unacceptable&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed there was a distinction between Carlson&#x27;s communications being intercepted by the NSA and intercepts of foreigners who were discussing Carlson. The NSA inspector general&#x27;s office announced in August 2021 that it was examining Carlson&#x27;s allegation.

== Rhetorical style ==
Carlson&#x27;s rhetorical style and debating tactics have drawn close attention from writers and other public figures.

In arguments, Carlson can quickly shift between personas as a devil&#x27;s advocate and a moralizing truth teller, and simultaneously appear outraged and blasé a use of contradiction that Lili Loofbourow, writing for &quot;Slate&quot;, referred to as a &quot;joking/not-joking loophole&quot; historically used by radio shock jocks. James Carville, a Democratic strategist and friend of Carlson who has appeared on his shows, called Carlson &quot;one of the world&#x27;s great contrarians&quot;. Touching upon this, Kelefa Sanneh, writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; said that one of Carlson&#x27;s gifts is to make any position he takes on an issue &quot;seem like a brave rebellion against someone else&#x27;s way of thinking.&quot;

Carlson has said he especially targets the &quot;moral preening&quot; of people he sees as having a sensibility of &quot;I&#x27;m a really good person, and you&#x27;re not.&quot; According to Philip Bump of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Carlson presents his perceived opponents &quot;as endlessly cynical and duplicitous&quot;, and agitates his audience against them by cherry-picking and misinterpreting information. Charlotte Alter of &quot;Time&quot; wrote that Carlson &quot;sanitizes and legitimizes right-wing conspiratorial thinking, dodges when you try to nail him down on the specifics, then wraps it all in an argument about censorship and free speech&quot;. Elaina Plott in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; summed up Carlson&#x27;s style as &quot;a gleeful &quot;fuck you&quot;&quot; to his opponents.

During remote interviews, Carlson&#x27;s producers will keep his face close-up onscreen so viewers can watch him react, often in disbelief. His trademark scowl lets viewers &quot;share his disdain&quot; toward opposing views, foreshadowing a &quot;scathing rebuttal&quot;. Carlson is known to interrupt guests repeatedly with direct demands to answer questions he poses, sometimes focusing on an embarrassing episode or statement from a guest&#x27;s past. Jack Shafer wrote in &quot;Politico&quot; that &quot;When the host barks questions in your earpiece, you can&#x27;t help but jolt to life like a puppet on a string&quot;, suggesting that successful guests on Carlson&#x27;s show must match his quick-wittedness and unflappability. Lyz Lenz of the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; wrote that this debate maneuver mirrors Jon Stewart&#x27;s confrontation of Carlson on &quot;Crossfire&quot; in 2004, describing Stewart then and Carlson now as both &quot;com[ing] out of the gate with an impossible line of questioning and a disingenuous defense&quot;.

Charlotte Alter of &quot;Time&quot; wrote in July 2021 that Carlson sometimes tells &quot;outright falsehoods&quot;, but generally &quot;avoids assertions that are factually disprovable, instead sticking to innuendo&quot;. As an example, Alter wrote that Carlson did not endorse Sidney Powell&#x27;s specific claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election, but he did say, &quot;The people now telling us to stop asking questions about voting machines are the same ones who claim that our phones weren&#x27;t listening to us&quot;. In September 2020, on &quot;The Rubin Report&quot;, Carlson said that, unlike TV newscasters who he said &quot;systematically lie&quot;, he will only lie &quot;if I&#x27;m really cornered or something&quot;, saying, &quot;I lie. I really try not to. I try never to lie on TV. ... I don&#x27;t like lying. I certainly do it, you know, out of weakness or whatever.&quot; Bump argued in 2022 that compared with other television anchors, Carlson is loath to acknowledge factual errors in his commentary.

Carlson&#x27;s use of hyperbole as a rhetorical device was cited by Fox News in its successful defense in 2020 of a slander lawsuit by Karen McDougal, after Carlson incorrectly argued in 2018 that Donald Trump had been a victim of extortion by McDougal.

Carlson describes George Orwell as his favorite writer and cites Strunk and White&#x27;s &quot;The&quot; &quot;Elements of Style&quot; as having an influence on his writing.

== Reception ==
According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, Carlson has been &quot;recognized for his success in helping to bring far-right viewpoints and vocabulary into the mainstream of American politics&quot; through his promotion of &quot;extreme positions on a range of political and social issues, for his embrace of white nationalism, for his support of authoritarian leaders of other countries, and for his regular reliance on arguably false or misleading claims, including baseless conspiracy theories&quot; and for &quot;exert[ing] an unusual influence on Republican president Donald Trump, who was a regular viewer of Carlson&#x27;s show.&quot; In 2021, &quot;Time&quot; said that Carlson could be the most powerful conservative in America, with Republican strategist Jeff Roe adding, &quot;He doesn&#x27;t react to the agenda, he drives the agenda.&quot; &quot;Mediaite&quot; named Carlson the most influential person in news media in 2021.

Tina Brown, the former editor of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and a former colleague of Carlson, said: &quot;Tucker is a tremendously good writer and I always thought it was a real shame that he kind of got sucked into this TV mania thing.&quot;

On February 23, 2017, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; wrote that &quot;Carlson&#x27;s true talent is not for political philosophizing, it&#x27;s for televised partisan combat. His go-to weapons—the smirky sarcasm, the barbed comebacks, the vicious politeness—seem uniquely designed to drive his sparring partners nuts, frequently making for terrific television&quot;.

On September 19, 2017, journalist Stephen Rodrick wrote in a &quot;GQ&quot; profile of Carlson: &quot;On his show, Carlson mocks and verbally body-slams those who disagree with him, a passel of easy marks such as Democratic politicians, well-meaning liberal activists, and young reporters. He shares with Donald Trump a deep reluctance to apologize for his mistakes, and he lobs insults that seem suspiciously like subconscious self-assessments: He loves to accuse his guests of &#x27;preening&#x27;, and he derides &#x27;pomposity, smugness, and groupthink&#x27;.&quot;

In an interview for a 2021 &quot;Time&quot; profile of Carlson, a former NewsCorp executive, Alex Azam, described Carlson as having some impunity within Fox News, &quot;because of the signal that touching him would send to the viewers that Fox never wants to lose&quot;. In 2021, he was included in the &quot;Time&quot; 100, &quot;Time&quot;″s annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world.

In April 2022, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a three-part 20,000-word investigative series on Carlson called &quot;American Nationalist&quot;. The investigative series documents Carlson&#x27;s rise to prominence and his rhetoric on immigration, race relations and the COVID-19 pandemic, describing Tucker Carlson Tonight as &quot;what may be the most racist show in the history of cable news — and also, by some measures, the most successful.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Confessore1_4/30/2022&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Confessore2_4/30/2022&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Confessore3_4/30/2022&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson responded by saying that he has not read &quot;American Nationalist&quot; and does not plan to. He also denied allegations from the &quot;Times&quot; about obsessing over ratings, saying that &quot;I&#x27;ve never read the ratings a single day in my life. I don&#x27;t even know how. Ask anyone at Fox.&quot; He also claimed to have taken positions unpopular with his audience, saying, &quot;Most of the big positions I&#x27;ve taken in the past five years — against the neocons, the vax and the war [in Ukraine] — have been very unpopular with our audience at first.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Carlson is married to Susan Thomson Carlson (). They met at St. George&#x27;s School, where she was the daughter of the school&#x27;s headmaster and priest. They were married on August 10, 1991, in the school chapel. They have four children. His son Buckley is Deputy Press Secretary to Vice President JD Vance.

Carlson was baptized as an Episcopalian but has said he grew up with secular beliefs; he credits his wife for his religious faith. In 2013, Carlson said, &quot;We still go to the Episcopal Church for all kinds of complicated reasons, but I truly despise the Episcopal Church in a lot of ways,&quot; citing his opposition to the church&#x27;s support for same-sex marriage and abortion rights. He has said he stays in the Church because he &quot;loves the liturgy&quot; and &quot;likes the people&quot;.

Carlson quit drinking alcohol in 2002. A few years earlier, he quit smoking cigarettes (a habit begun in eighth grade) and took up nicotine gum, which he &quot;chews constantly&quot;, and nicotine pouches. Carlson is dyslexic. He is a Deadhead (a fan of the rock band Grateful Dead) and has attended more than fifty Dead concerts, and the title of his 2018 book &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; was inspired by the Grateful Dead song of the same name.

In 2011, a group of protesters gathered outside his house in Kent, Washington, D.C., to protest Carlson. In 2017, Carlson sold his home and purchased another nearby.&lt;ref name=&quot;bizjournals/2017/carlson-sells-home-buys&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2018, protestors gathered in front of their home. In 2020, Carlson sold his home in Kent and bought a house on Gasparilla Island, on Florida&#x27;s Gulf Coast, and in the summer of 2022, a second home next door.&lt;ref name=&quot;dirt/1203329303/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;miamiherald/274778061&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dirt/1203631481&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

They now also live part of the year in Maine near his &quot;favorite place in the world&quot;, Bryant Pond, Woodstock, Maine.&lt;ref name=&quot;sunjournal/carlson-more-maine&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2022, Carlson spoke at the funeral of Hells Angels president Sonny Barger. Carlson said that he had been a fan of Barger since his college years, quoted Barger as saying &quot;stay loyal, remain free, and always value honor&quot;, and added &quot;I want to pay tribute to the man who spoke those words&quot;.

In 2024, Carlson shared with a documentary producer that he believes that he was mauled by a demon while he was in bed. The attack left him bleeding.

<text>Ugly Casanova was an American indie rock band signed to Sub Pop Records. The band has released one album, &quot;Sharpen Your Teeth&quot;.

==Career==
According to the Ugly Casanova website, in 1998 a man named Edgar E. Graham, a.k.a. &quot;Ugly Casanova&quot;, impressed himself upon the band Modest Mouse while backstage at a concert in Denver, Colorado. After some prodding, he shared his work with the band and began performing it early before shows while some people were milling around. Upon completing these performances, he retreated quickly with a look of anger and shame. After a time, a few small recordings were created, after which Edgar vanished. Isaac Brock of Modest Mouse later recorded his songs in hopes that Graham would resurface in the music scene.

Brock has since revealed that Edgar Graham was &quot;a fiction thing that [Brock] started awhile back to eliminate [himself] from the band,&quot; to escape having to do interviews. Two pieces of evidence exist that suggest that the story was fiction: Modest Mouse&#x27;s 1997 EP &quot;The Fruit That Ate Itself&quot; was credited to having been under the production company Ugly Casanova, which suggested it was a name Brock made up to retain creative control and publishing rights to his music while under a major label. Secondly, &quot;Ugly Casanova&quot; was the title of a song Brock wrote around 1993. 

The band lineup as of the &quot;180° South: Conquerors of the Useless&quot; soundtrack consists of Brock, Eric Judy, Tom Peloso, and Joe Plummer of Modest Mouse, as well as Clay Jones, who worked as an engineer on Modest Mouse&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;We Were Dead Before The Ship Even Sank&quot;. The band&#x27;s lineup for &quot;Sharpen Your Teeth&quot; consisted of Brock, Tyler Reilly (In the Drink), Tim Rutili (Califone, Red Red Meat), Pall Jenkins (The Black Heart Procession), John Orth (Holopaw), and Brian Deck (Red Red Meat).

Compared with Modest Mouse&#x27;s music, Ugly Casanova&#x27;s music is distinguished by its more stripped-down sound. The lack of overdubbed vocals on some of the tracks is particularly significant: Brock is known for having a slight lisp which he is very uncomfortable with and has often covered up on Modest Mouse recordings via double tracking and distortion. Ugly Casanova mixes indie rock with hints of country and folk, ranging from acoustic ballads (&quot;Hotcha Girls&quot;) to more bizarre with piercing vocals (&quot;Diamonds on the Face of Evil&quot;).

Two tracks released by Ugly Casanova, &quot;Baby&#x27;s Clean Conscience&quot; and &quot;Parasites&quot;, appear earlier as unreleased demos of Modest Mouse in the &quot;Paracite Sessions&quot; purportedly recorded in 1993 at Calvin Johnson&#x27;s Dub Narcotic Studio. In 1997 the fourth Magic Eye Single (each one named after its color of vinyl) included &quot;To Roads To Go&quot; on the apparently now defunct Magic Eye Records, however, this was an entirely different incarnation of Ugly Casanova consisting of Brock, Steve Dukage, and John Atkins of 764-Hero.

Rumors of new Ugly Casanova material came and went, but no substantial news regarding the band surfaced until it was announced that Ugly Casanova would contribute to the soundtrack for the 2010 documentary &quot;180 Degrees South: Conquerors of the Useless&quot;. The soundtrack featured eight new Ugly Casanova songs as well as a redone version of &quot;Hotcha Girls&quot; from &quot;Sharpen Your Teeth&quot;.

<text>Live at Benaroya Hall is a two-disc live album by the American alternative rock band Pearl Jam, recorded on October 22, 2003 at Benaroya Hall, Seattle, Washington and released on July 27, 2004 through BMG.

==Overview==
The concert—which took place on October 22, 2003 at Benaroya Hall in Seattle, Washington—is acoustic, and was performed and released as a benefit for YouthCare, a non-profit charity in Seattle. The album was also released as a limited edition quadruple vinyl through Ten Club, Pearl Jam&#x27;s fan club. Only 2,000 were pressed—each individually numbered by hand—and sold out within minutes of being on sale.

&quot;Live at Benaroya Hall&quot; was released through a one-album deal with BMG, and the band used the experiment to later sign with BMG subsidiary J Records to produce the album &quot;Pearl Jam (Avocado)&quot;. It debuted at number 18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and sold approximately 52,000 copies in its first week. As of April 2006, &quot;Live at Benaroya Hall&quot; has sold 168,000 copies in the United States according to Nielsen SoundScan.

==Reception==
AllMusic staff writer Jason Birchmeier gave the album two and a half out of five stars, writing, &quot;Of the many, many live albums Pearl Jam publicly released, their October 23, 2003, show at Benaroya Hall is one of the more novel ones... Such novelty, of course, doesn&#x27;t make &quot;Benaroya Hall&quot; an especially excellent set (in fact, it feels a little one-dimensional and subdued because of the acoustic instrumentation), though it is one of the more unique and interesting of the many, many shows Pearl Jam released publicly over the years.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; staff writer Christian Hoard gave the album three out of five stars, writing that the &quot; album&#x27;s warm, wizened feel and unusual set list are appropriate for souvenir-collecting obsessives and lapsed fans looking for a new take on Pearl Jam&#x27;s substantial catalog.&quot;

<doc id="796109" wikidata="Q928925" url="?curid=796109" title="Cherry eye">
<text>Cherry eye is a disorder of the nictitating membrane (NM), also called the third eyelid, present in the eyes of dogs and cats. Cherry eye is most often seen in young dogs under the age of two. Common misnomers include adenitis, hyperplasia, adenoma of the gland of the third eyelid; however, cherry eye is not caused by hyperplasia, neoplasia, or primary inflammation. In many species, the third eyelid plays an essential role in vision by supplying oxygen and nutrients to the eye via tear production. Normally, the gland can turn inside-out without detachment. Cherry eye results from a defect in the retinaculum which is responsible for anchoring the gland to the periorbita. This defect causes the gland to prolapse and protrude from the eye as a red fleshy mass. Problems arise as sensitive tissue dries out and is subjected to external trauma Exposure of the tissue often results in secondary inflammation, swelling, or infection. If left untreated, this condition can lead to dry eye syndrome and other complications.

==Description==

Cherry eye is most common in young dogs, especially breeds such as Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, English Bulldog, Lhasa Apso, Shih Tzu, West Highland White Terrier, Pug, Bloodhound, American Cocker Spaniel, and Boston Terrier. Cherry eye is rare in felines, but can occur. This defect is most common in the Burmese breed of felines. A similar condition exists in dwarf lop-eared rabbits, which occurs in the harderian gland. Similar surgical treatment is necessary.

There is likely a complicated and multigenic component involving genetic risk factors. Some breeds are considered to be more susceptible to its development than others, including the Bulldog, Boston Terrier, Bull Terrier, Lhasa Apso, Cocker Spaniel, St. Bernard, Shar-pei, Shih Tzu and Poodle The NM contains many glands which merge and appear as a single gland. Typically, glands secrete tears for lubrication of the cornea. Lack of anchoring allows the gland to flip up, causing the gland to prolapse. Symptoms include a visible fleshy mass, abnormal tear production, and a discharge or drainage from the eye. Cherry eye is typically diagnosed by examination of the conjunctiva and nictitating membrane. The most obvious symptom of cherry eye is a round fleshy mass in the medial canthus of the eye, similar in appearance to the fruit it is named for. This mass may be unilateral or ‘’bilateral’’. Both eyes may develop cherry eye at different times in the animal&#x27;s life. Other symptoms of cherry eye include drainage from the eye and abnormal tear production. Initially, cherry eye results in overproduction of tears, but eventually changes to unsubstantial tear production.

==Treatment==

===Non-surgical===
Cherry eye, if caught early, can be resolved with a downward diagonal-toward-snout closed-eye massage of the affected eye or occasionally self-corrects alone or with antibiotics and steroids. Sometimes the prolapse will correct itself with no interference, or with slight physical manual massage manipulation as often as necessary coupled with medication.

===Surgical===
Surgery is the most common means of repairing a cherry eye. Surgery involves gland replacement, not excision, by anchoring the membrane to the orbital rim or using a pocket technique. In severely infected cases, preoperative antibiotics may be necessary by means of antibiotic eye ointment. Removal of the gland was once an acceptable treatment, and made the eye appear completely normal. Despite cosmetic appeal, removal of the gland reduces tear production by 30 percent. Tear production is essential in maintaining and protecting the eye from the external environment. Reduced tear production is especially problematic in breeds of animals predisposed to Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), also known as dry eye syndrome. With surgeries performed in this manner, KCS often results later in life.

KCS is not common in dogs, affecting one per cent of the dog population. KCS is a chronic degenerative conjunctivitis that can lead to impaired vision and blindness. KCS has a wide array of causes including drug toxicity, cherry eye, previous surgery, trauma, and irradiation. KCS can be treated, but treatment often spans the entirety of the animal&#x27;s life.

In contrast to this, several replacement surgical procedures exist to remedy cherry eye. Replacement of the gland results in lower instances of dry eye later in life. Surgery types are broken into two groups: anchoring procedures and pocket/envelope procedures. At least 8 surgical techniques currently exist. In anchoring procedures, the prolapsed gland must be sutured to the periorbital fascia, the sclera, or the base of the third eyelid. In contrast, pocket procedures involve suturing healthy tissue around the prolapsed to enclose and secure it. Each of these techniques may be performed with an anterior or superior approach, depending on which direction of suturing will cause the least complications to the eye.

====Anchoring method====
Originally, the anchoring method involved suturing the gland to the globe. This method was superseded over time due to the risky and difficult nature of the surgery, along with a high rate of recurrence. Anchoring approaches from posterior may disrupt normal fluid excretion. Subsequently, an anterior approach was introduced. Disadvantages of anchoring techniques include restricted mobility of third eyelid, which is essential in the functions of fluid distribution and self-cleaning. New procedures are currently being explored to allow tacking of the NM without restricting movement of the third eyelid. Few studies compare results of surgeries, therefore choosing a procedure is a matter of preference.

====Envelope/pocket method====
The envelope method, often called the pocket technique, requires suturing of tissue around the prolapse, encasing it in a layer of conjunctiva. Pocket techniques are easiest for doctors to learn. Pocket methods also have anterior and posterior versions. Posterior suturing techniques are the most commonly used because they cause the least complications, with no alterations in tear production. Surgery should only be attempted by experienced surgeons. Inappropriate surgical techniques can result in many complications including cysts on the eye.

==Prognosis==

===Without treatment===
Previously, treatment was thought optional until the role of NM was fully understood. The NM gland is responsible for 40–50% of tear production. If exposed for extended periods of time, the gland is at risk for trauma, secondary infection, and reduced tear production. Many complications can arise if left untreated: early closed-eye massage manipulation is recommended to prevent inflammation .

===Post treatment===
Postoperative treatment includes antibiotic eye ointment three times daily for two weeks. It is possible to have a relapse of the gland after surgery and require multiple surgeries. With treatment, it is possible for animals to live a normal life.

<doc id="796118" wikidata="Q7127679" url="?curid=796118" title="Pallbearer">
<text>A pallbearer is one of several participants who help carry the casket at a funeral. They may wear white gloves in order to prevent damaging the casket and to show respect to the deceased person.

Some traditions distinguish between the roles of pallbearers and casket bearer. The former is a ceremonial position, carrying a tip of the pall or a cord attached to it. The latter do the actual heavy lifting and carrying. There may otherwise be pallbearers only in the symbolic sense if the casket is on an animal or vehicle.

In Western cultures, the pallbearers are usually male family members, close friends, or colleagues of the deceased. A notable exception was the funeral of Lee Harvey Oswald, in which reporters, pressed into service to carry the coffin, outnumbered the mourners. In some African cultures, pallbearers are not family members but are staffs of professional funeral agencies who are paid for their services. The first duty of a pallbearer is to appear at least thirty minutes before the funeral begins as the funeral director can then provide directions. Secondly, they will also be notified on where they are able to sit during the funeral service and during then the casket would be carried. Thirdly, pallbearers are carrying the casket to one&#x27;s final resting area after the funeral. Depending on the tradition, pallbearers would either carry the coffin on their shoulders or by their waist.

At times additional pallbearers, known as honorary pallbearers, walk either behind or directly in front of the casket in a showcase of supplemental distinction towards the deceased. This type of pallbearer is most often a gentleman in the profession of the deceased who has achieved significant merit within their position.

==Etymology==

A pall is a heavy cloth that is draped over a coffin. Thus the term &quot;pallbearer&quot; is used to signify someone who &quot;bears&quot; the coffin which the pall covers. In Roman times, a soldier wore a cape or cloak called the pallium. In medieval times the term pallium was shortened to pall. Christians would use a pall to cover their loved ones when burying them.

==Buddhist culture==
In Ancient Indian Buddhist cultural traditions of grieving, often requires pallbearers to consume a vegetarian diet which excludes garlic, onions, leek and chives. They tend to also abstain from alcohol for at least 49 days after passing. This is thought to be the maximum duration likely between death and rebirth. Hence, acts might be performed frequently during this duration in order to produce merit for the dead. Thus, this leads up to the ‘ending’ ritual on the last day. In every tradition of Buddhism, there seem to be spiritualist who communicates with the dead at the request of the pallbearer. Usually, the primary reason is to make sure that there has been sufficient merit produced by the deceased&#x27;s family to prevent an unwanted rebirth.

==British culture==
The arrangement for Princess Louisa&#x27;s funeral during 1768, held the first announcement that women were to be utilised as contributors of the pall at the funeral. Garter King of Arms then promptly notified the Lord Chamberlain that ladies had only gone into a funeral process by mourning or attendants under the chief mourners. To hold the ends of the pall draped over casket or to transport the coffin was a tremendous honour. The ability of pallbearers to come towards royalty which only few were allowed to, be it whether the King is alive or dead.

==Method of carrying==
Pallbearers in the US and Canada most commonly carry a casket by the handles, and at around waist height. In the United Kingdom, Australia, Ireland, and most countries in Asia, the coffin is often carried on the shoulders. There are typically 6 to 8 pallbearers depending on the size and weight of the coffin. 

In Scandinavia, the casket is carried by three straps, which go under the casket; the pallbearers on each side take their side of the strap over their shoulders and the casket itself is suspended by the straps on knee height. The advantage of this method is that the weight of the casket is distributed on the shoulders of the pallbearers, and the casket can be lowered immediately to the grave, as the pallbearers will simply walk lengthwise on each side of the grave. Once the casket has been lowered, the pallbearers on the right side of the casket (the heart of the deceased) then pull the straps off.

==British countryside and carriages==
Further, chief mourners and attendants such as pallbearers and canopy usually wore mourning gowns with hoods. The act of putting on of particular mourning clothing, along with offering food, and burial banquet were ancient practices preserved by European Renaissance burial traditions that lasted till the 19th century. Another way to indulge in funeral ceremonies included objects such as golden palls, royal horses, and expensive wax tapers. The funeral van with the coffin-bearers holding the corners of the pall follows, with the pallbearers beneath the pall actually supporting the casket. In the 19th century, white was worn in the British countryside for mourning. For example, the village of Piddington had a set of similar white gowns for pallbearers which remained in the church. If a funeral occurs, pallbearers could come from the fields and swap them with their work clothes. Carriages were built specially made for pallbearers so that 6 people can proceed comfortably or two closed carriages would be used. The 2 leading pallbearers, funeral director and clergyman, would be in the first carriage. The rest of the pallbearers would take the second carriage. Honorary pallbearers are arranged in a similar manner following the active pallbearers. Pallbearers’ carriages would leave a specific place at a certain time in case those who wish to ride to the church or house could meet at that area.

==Death in a fraternity or other societies==
If the dead was a member of a fraternity or other societies, the family could likely select that entire group. At Masonic funerals, pallbearers are usually selected from that order. If there are more than one organisation, it is possible that some would be chosen from each of these societies. The leaders of each society should be informed of the plan, in order to properly appoint their members. There is a tradition in a couple of places where trained pallbearers were chosen by funeral directors. When this happens, pallbearers acknowledge their duties and position, and are not required to go into details on the subject during that time. If the church path is narrow and the turns are sharp which may be hard to go past with pallbearers, a coffin carriage might be used. Otherwise the coffin can be lifted to the altar and placed down by the pallbearers. Unless the state of the street is that the coffin cannot be removed from the hearse standing near the curbing, it would not be backed up at either the church or house. Allocated seating for the pallbearers is usually at the left front pews, once the coffin is placed then pallbearers may sit, and funeral director sits directly behind the coffin. Thus, this shows how societies are impacted by a death of a member and how pallbearers function in short turns.

<doc id="796121" wikidata="Q706258" url="?curid=796121" title="Yasuo Tanaka (politician)">
<text>is a Japanese novelist and politician. He served as the governor of Nagano Prefecture from 2000 to 2006, became president of New Party Nippon, and has been elected to Japan&#x27;s legislatures.

== Early life ==
Tanaka was born in Musashino, Tokyo, and moved to Nagano at the age of 8 when his father became a professor at Shinshu University. He initially failed the university entrance exams in 1975 and spent the next year studying in Tokyo to retake them. In 1976 he entered the Faculty of Law at Hitotsubashi University. He received the Bungei Prize in 1980 for his first novel, &quot;Nantonaku, Kurisutaru&quot;, while still a student. He graduated in the same year and briefly worked for the Mobil Oil Corporation for three months before leaving to continue his career as a writer. Tanaka married after graduating from university but divorced 11 months later.

== Political career ==

In 2000, Tanaka was elected governor of Nagano Prefecture, a rural prefecture in Japan, standing as an independent without the support of any major Japanese political party. Soon after, Tanaka became a focus of public attention in Japan for policies that represented a radical departure from the priorities of the Japan&#x27;s bureaucratic establishment. These included his policy of halting dam building, campaigning for environmental issues and abolishing the Nagano Press Club.

These policies were designed to address ruinous public development projects that had left Nagano and many other prefectures burdened by debts. Japan is one of the most heavily dammed countries in the world with more than 3,000 dams and virtually no unobstructed rivers.

In 2002, conservative assemblymen who were upset by Tanaka&#x27;s challenge to decades of pork-barrel politics forced him from office by passing a vote of no-confidence. But in the ensuing election, Tanaka made a successful comeback, thanks to overwhelming popular vote.

In August 2005, Tanaka formed the New Party Nippon with a handful of reform-minded members of the House of Representatives.

He lost his governor&#x27;s post in the August 2006 election to Liberal Democratic Party opponent Jin Murai. He regained political office in the July 2007 election for the House of Councillors of the national Diet, the only successful New Party Nippon candidate in the election. In August 2009 he relinquished his seat in the House of Councillors in order to contest the Hyogo 8th district in the House of Representatives general election, in which he defeated Tetsuzo Fuyushiba, who had held the seat for 23 years. He was replaced in the House of Councillors by Makoto Hirayama, who had placed third on the party&#x27;s ballot in the 2007 election.

As president of New Party Nippon, he served in the House of Representatives of Japan in the Democratic Party and People&#x27;s New Party parliamentary groups before becoming an independent (in terms of parliamentary group) in 2012. In the 2012 House of Representatives election, he lost his seat representing Hyōgo&#x27;s 8th district to Kōmeitō newcomer Hiromasa Nakano – before 2009, the seat had been held by Kōmeitō&#x27;s former secretary-general, Tetsuzō Fuyushiba.

<doc id="796125" wikidata="Q2418031" url="?curid=796125" title="Mary Edwards Walker">
<text>Mary Edwards Walker (November 26, 1832 – February 21, 1919), commonly referred to as Dr. Mary Walker, was an American abolitionist, prohibitionist, prisoner of war in the American Civil War, and surgeon. She is the only woman to receive the Medal of Honor.

In 1855, she earned her medical degree at Syracuse Medical College in New York, married and started a medical practice. She attempted to join the Union Army at the outbreak of the Civil War, but was turned away. She served as a surgeon at a temporary hospital in Washington, D.C. before being hired by Union Forces and assigned to Army of the Cumberland and later the 52nd Ohio Infantry, becoming the first female surgeon in the US Army. She was captured by Confederate forces after crossing enemy lines to treat wounded civilians and arrested as a spy. She was sent as a prisoner of war to Richmond, Virginia until released in a prisoner exchange.

After the war, she was approved for the Medal of Honor, for her efforts to treat the wounded in battle and across enemy lines during the Civil War. Notably, the award was not expressly given for gallantry in action at that time, and in fact was the only military decoration during the Civil War. Walker is the only woman to receive the medal and one of only eight civilians to receive it. Her name was deleted from the Army Medal of Honor Roll in 1917 (along with over 900 other recipients); however, it was restored in 1977. 

After the war, she was a writer and lecturer supporting the women&#x27;s suffrage movement until her death in 1919.

==Early life and education==
Mary Edwards Walker was born in the Town of Oswego, New York, on November 26, 1832, the daughter of Alvah (father) and Vesta (mother) Walker. She was the youngest of seven children: she had five sisters and one brother. Alvah and Vesta raised both their son and their daughters in a progressive manner that was revolutionary for the time. Their nontraditional parenting nurtured Mary&#x27;s spirit of independence and sense of justice that she actively demonstrated throughout her life. While they were devoted Christians, the Walkers were Freethinkers who raised their children to question the regulations and restrictions of various denominations. The Walker parents also demonstrated non-traditional gender roles to their children regarding sharing work around the farm: Vesta often participated in heavy labor while Alvah took part in general household chores. Walker worked on her family farm as a child. She did not wear women&#x27;s clothing during farm labor because she considered it too restricting. Her mother reinforced her views that corsets and tight lacings were unhealthy.

Her elementary education consisted of attendance at the local school that her parents had started. The Walkers were determined that their daughters be as well-educated as their son, so they founded the first free schoolhouse in Oswego in the late 1830s. After finishing primary school, Mary and two of her older sisters attended Falley Seminary in Fulton, New York. Falley was not only an institution of higher learning, but a place that emphasized modern social reform in gender roles, education, and hygiene. Its ideologies and practices further cemented Mary&#x27;s determination to defy traditional feminine standards on a principle of injustice. In her free time, Mary would pore over her father&#x27;s medical texts on anatomy and physiology; her interest in medicine is attributable to her exposure to medical literature at an early age. As a young woman, she taught at a school in Minetto, New York, eventually earning enough money to pay her way through Syracuse Medical College, where she graduated with honors as a medical doctor in 1855, the only woman in her class.

She married a fellow medical school student, Albert Miller, on November 16, 1855, shortly before she turned 23. Walker wore a short skirt with trousers underneath, refused to include &quot;obey&quot; in her vows, and retained her last name, all characteristic of her obstinate nonconformity. They set up a joint practice in Rome, New York. The practice did not flourish, as female physicians were generally not trusted or respected at that time. They later divorced, on account of Miller&#x27;s infidelity.

Walker briefly attended Bowen Collegiate Institute (later named Lenox College) in Hopkinton, Iowa, in 1860, until she was suspended for refusing to resign from the school&#x27;s debating society, which until she joined had been all male.

==American Civil War==

Walker volunteered at the outbreak of the American Civil War as a surgeon – first for the Army, but was rejected because she was a woman (despite having kept a private practice for many years). She was offered the role of a nurse but declined and chose to volunteer as a surgeon for the Union Army as a civilian. The U.S. Army had no female surgeons, and at first, she was allowed to practice only as a nurse. During this period, she served at the First Battle of Bull Run, July 21, 1861, and at the Patent Office Hospital in Washington, D.C. She worked as an unpaid field surgeon near the Union front lines, including at the Battle of Fredericksburg and in Chattanooga after the Battle of Chickamauga. As a suffragist, she was happy to see women serving as soldiers, and alerted the press to the case of Frances Hook, in Ward 2 of the Chattanooga hospital, a woman who served in the Union forces disguised as a man. Walker was the first female surgeon of the Union army. She wore men&#x27;s clothing during her work, claiming it to be easier for high demands of her work.

In September 1862, Walker wrote to the War Department requesting employment as a spy, but her proposal was declined. In September 1863, she was employed as a &quot;Contract Acting Assistant Surgeon (civilian)&quot; by the Army of the Cumberland, becoming the first female surgeon employed by the U.S. Army Surgeon. Walker was later appointed assistant surgeon of the 52nd Ohio Infantry. During her service, she frequently crossed battle lines and treated civilians.

On April 10, 1864, she was captured by Confederate troops, and arrested as a spy, just after she finished helping a Confederate doctor perform an amputation. She was sent to Castle Thunder in Richmond, Virginia, and remained there until August 12, 1864, when she was released as part of a prisoner exchange. While she was imprisoned, she refused to wear the clothes provided her, said to be more &quot;becoming of her sex&quot;. Walker was exchanged for a Confederate surgeon from Tennessee on August 12, 1864.

She went on to serve as supervisor of a female prison in Louisville, Kentucky, and as the head of an orphanage in Tennessee.

==Later career==
After the war, Walker was awarded a disability pension for partial muscular atrophy suffered while she was imprisoned by the enemy. She was given $8.50 a month, beginning June 13, 1865, but in 1899 that amount was raised to $20 per month.

She became a writer and lecturer, supporting such issues as health care, temperance, women&#x27;s rights, and dress reform for women. She was frequently arrested for wearing men&#x27;s clothing, and insisted on her right to wear clothing that she thought appropriate. She wrote two books that discussed women&#x27;s rights and dress. She replied to criticism of her attire: &quot;I don&#x27;t wear men&#x27;s clothes, I wear my own clothes.&quot;

Walker was a member of the Central Woman&#x27;s Suffrage Bureau in Washington, DC and solicited funds to endow a chair for a female professor at Howard University medical school. She attempted to register to vote in 1871, but was turned away. The initial stance of the movement, following her lead, was to claim that women already had the right to vote, and Congress needed only to enact enabling legislation. After a number of fruitless years advocating this position, the movement promoted the adoption of a constitutional amendment. This was diametrically opposed to her position, and she fell out of favor with the movement. She continued to attend suffrage conventions and distribute her own literature, but was virtually ignored by the rest of the movement. Her penchant for wearing masculine clothing, including a top hat, only exacerbated the situation. She received a more favorable reception in England than in the United States.

In 1907, Walker published &quot;Crowning Constitutional Argument&quot;, in which she argued that some states, as well as the federal Constitution, had already granted women the right to vote. She testified on women&#x27;s suffrage before committees of the U.S. House of Representatives in 1912 and 1914.

After a long illness, Walker died at home on February 21, 1919, at the age of eighty-six. She was buried at Rural Cemetery in Oswego, New York, in a plain funeral, with an American flag draped over her casket, and wearing a black suit instead of a dress. Her death in 1919 came one year before the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guaranteed women the right to vote.

==Dress reform==
Inspired by her parents&#x27; novel standard of dressing for health purposes, Walker was infamous for contesting traditional female wardrobe, a campaign then known as rational dress. In 1871, she wrote, &quot;The greatest sorrows from which women suffer to-day are those physical, moral, and mental ones, that are caused by their unhygienic manner of dressing!&quot; She strongly opposed women&#x27;s long skirts with numerous petticoats, not only for their discomfort and their inhibition to the wearer&#x27;s mobility but for their collection and spread of dust and dirt. As a young woman, she began experimenting with various skirt-lengths and layers, all with men&#x27;s trousers underneath. By 1861, her typical ensemble included trousers with suspenders under a knee-length dress with a tight waist and full skirt.

While encouraged by her family, Walker&#x27;s wardrobe choices were often met with criticism. Once, while a schoolteacher, she was assaulted on her way home by a neighboring farmer and a group of boys, who chased her and attacked her with eggs and other projectiles. Female colleagues in medical school criticized her choices, and patients often gawked at her and teased her. She nevertheless persisted in her mission to reform women&#x27;s dress. Her view that women&#x27;s dress should &quot;protect the person, and allow freedom of motion and circulation, and not make the wearer a slave to it&quot; made her commitment to dress reform as great as her zeal for abolitionism. She famously wrote to the women&#x27;s journal, &quot;The Sibyl: A Review of the Tastes, Errors, and Fashions of Society&quot;, about her campaign against women&#x27;s fashion, among other things, for its injuries to health, its expense, and its contribution to the dissolution of marriages. Her literature contributed to the spread of her ideas and made her a popular figure among other feminists and female physicians.

In 1870, Walker was arrested in New Orleans and mocked by men because she was dressed as a man. The arresting officer twisted her arm and asked her if she had ever been in a relationship with a man. Walker was released from custody when she was recognized at Police Court.

==Honors and awards==
===Medal of Honor===

After the war, Walker sought a retroactive brevet or commission to validate her service. President Andrew Johnson directed Secretary of War Edwin Stanton to study the legality of the issue, and he solicited an opinion from the Army&#x27;s Judge Advocate General, who determined that there was no precedent for commissioning a female, but that a &quot;commendatory acknowledgment&quot; could be issued in lieu of the commission. This led Johnson to personally award the Medal of Honor as an alternative. Thus, Walker was not formally recommended for the Medal of Honor, and this unusual process may also explain why authorities overlooked her ineligibility, ironically on the grounds of lacking a commission.

In 1916, the U.S. Congress created a pension act for Medal of Honor recipients, and in doing so created separate Army and Navy Medal of Honor Rolls. The Army was directed to review eligibility of prior recipients in a separate bill not related to the pension rolls, but which had been requested by the Army in order to retroactively police undesirable awards. The undesirable awards resulted from the lack of regulations on the medal. 

The Army had published no regulations until 1897, and the law had very few requirements, meaning that recipients could earn a medal for virtually any reason, resulting in nearly 900 awards for non-combat enlistment extensions. 

The Army&#x27;s Medal of Honor Board deliberated from 1916 to 1917, and struck 911 names from the Army Medal of Honor Roll, including those of Dr. Mary Edwards Walker and William F. &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; Cody. Both were considered ineligible for the Army Medal of Honor because 1862, 1863, and 1904 laws strictly required recipients to be officers or enlisted service members. In Walker&#x27;s case, she was a civilian contract surgeon, not a commissioned officer. 

Nevertheless, the Medal of Honor Board perhaps discriminated against Walker because it declined to revoke the Medal of at least two other contract surgeons who were likewise ineligible. One of these, Major General Leonard Wood, was a former Army Chief of Staff who was a civilian contract surgeon of the same status as Walker when he was recommended for the award. All of this was known to the Medal of Honor Board, as board president General Nelson Miles had twice recommended Wood for the medal, and knew that he was ineligible. 

The dis-enrolled recipients were not ordered to return their medals per a recommendation from the Army Judge Advocate General, who noted that Congress did not grant the Army the jurisdiction to enforce this provision of the statute, rendering both the repossession and criminal penalties inoperative.

Although several sources attribute President Jimmy Carter with restoring Walker&#x27;s medal posthumously in 1977, this is probably incorrect. The action was taken well below the Secretary of the Army, at the level of the Army&#x27;s Assistant Secretary for Manpower and Reserve Affairs, which was acting on a recommendation from the Board for Correction of Military Records. In fact, both the Ford and Carter Administrations opposed the restoration; the Carter White House reacted with confusion to the announcement of the Board&#x27;s decision. 

A recent historical work documented that the Board for Correction probably exceeded its authority in making a unilateral restoration of the medal, since the Board is merely a delegation arm of the authority of the Secretary of the Army, and thus cannot contradict a standing law. Therefore, the Board&#x27;s decision was controversial because its mandate was to only correct errors or injustices within its authority, not act against the authority of public law. 

This very point was illustrated by the awarding of Garlin Conner&#x27;s Medal of Honor in early 2018, which also originated from the Board for Correction, but instead went through the President and required a statutory waiver from Congress—seen to be a requirement because the Board lacked the authority to contravene a public law and the associated statutes of limitations.

Walker felt that she had been awarded the Medal of Honor because she had gone into enemy territory to care for the suffering inhabitants, when no man had the courage to do so, for fear of being imprisoned.

<text>, also called or J-drama, are television programs that are a staple of Japanese television and are broadcast daily. 

==Format==
All major TV networks in Japan produce a variety of drama series including romance, comedy, detective stories, horror, jidaigeki, thriller, BL, and many others. Single episode, or &quot;tanpatsu&quot; dramas that are usually two hours in length are also broadcast. For special occasions, there may be a one or two-episode drama with a specific theme, such as one produced in 2015 for the 70-year anniversary of the end of World War II.

Japanese drama series are broadcast in three-month seasons: winter (January–March), spring (April–June), summer (July–September), and autumn or fall (October–December). Some series may start in another month though it may still be counted as a series of a specific season. Most of the dramas air on weekday evenings between 9pm and 11pm. Daytime dramas are typically broadcast daily, and episodes of the same drama can be aired daily for several months, such as NHK&#x27;s &quot;asadora&quot;, which usually span six months each. Evening dramas air weekly and are usually ten to fourteen hour-long episodes.

In many cases, instead of being episodic, drama series are serial, with one story running throughout the episodes. Since they are of a fixed length, dramas have a definite ending, and since they are relatively long, they can explore character, situation, and interesting dialog in a way that is less possible in most movies. Structurally, Japanese dramas can be compared to American or British miniseries. Dramas are rarely canceled mid-season, but they usually do not continue into the next season, even if extremely popular. Popular dramas do, however, often give rise to &quot;specials&quot; that are made after the final episode if the show has been a huge success. Some genres such as jidaigeki, police procedurals, or family dramas, however, feature series that are episodic or that sometimes continue for years on end, with &quot;Mito Kōmon&quot;, &quot;Taiyō ni Hoero!&quot;, or &quot;Wataru Seken wa Oni Bakari&quot; being famous examples.

A characteristic of Japanese drama that differentiates it is that each episode is usually shot only a few (two to three) weeks before it is aired. Many fans have even been able to visit their idols while shooting scenes as the show is airing.

==History==
;1940s &quot;The Beginning&quot;
In 1940, NHK conducted experimental broadcasts and aired a 12-minute television drama titled &quot;Yuugemae&quot; (夕餉前). This is considered the first television drama in Japan.

;1950s–1960s &quot;The Early Years&quot;
During the 1950s, private television stations such as Nippon Television, TBS, TV Asahi, and Fuji Television were launched, and each began producing television dramas. At the time, however, television dramas were regarded as inferior to movies and theater, and top actors hesitated to appear in them. Amid this trend, NHK established the &quot;Taiga drama&quot; slot and successfully cast Keiji Sada, a major movie star, paving the way for other movie stars to transition to television.

;1970s–1990s &quot;The Golden Age&quot;
By the time of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, television ownership in Japan had surpassed 90%. As movies declined, television dramas entered their golden age. The 1970s saw the emergence of talented scriptwriters such as Kuniko Mukoda, Taichi Yamada, So Kuramoto, and Shinichi Ichikawa. In the 1980s, NHK&#x27;s &quot;Asadora&quot; &quot;Oshin&quot; (1983) recorded a peak rating of 62.9%, while the &quot;Taiga drama&quot; &quot;Dokuganryu Masamune&quot; (1987) achieved an average rating of 39.7%. In commercial broadcasting, series with flashy action, such as &quot;Taiyō ni Hoero!&quot; (1972), &quot;Tokusō Saizensen&quot; (1977) and &quot;Seibu Keisatsu&quot; (1979), became popular. From the late 1980s to the 1990s, &quot;trendy dramas&quot; gained widespread popularity. This period also saw the emergence of talented screenwriters like Yuji Sakamoto, Eriko Kitagawa, Shinji Nojima, Koki Mitani and Yoshikazu Okada, as well as new stars such as Yuji Oda, Yosuke Eguchi, and Takuya Kimura.

;2000s &quot;A Turning Point&quot;
Japanese television dramas continued to enjoy success in the 2000s. The Fuji TV series &quot;Hero&quot; (2001) achieved an average viewership rating of 34.3%, reaffirming Takuya Kimura&#x27;s immense popularity. However, during this period, the internet began to spread widely and emerged as a potential rival to television.

;2010s &quot;The Rise of Streaming&quot;
The rise of streaming platforms, led by American companies like Netflix, became increasingly evident, while traditional Japanese television dramas experienced declining viewership ratings. This created a vicious cycle of shrinking production budgets. Amid this downturn, TBS delivered a series of hits such as &quot;Naoki Hanzawa&quot; (2013), solidifying the &quot;Sunday Theater&quot; (日曜劇場) slot as the pinnacle of commercial TV dramas.

;2020s &quot;The Streaming Era&quot;
Streaming dramas, backed by generous budgets from foreign companies, came to be seen as far more lavish than traditional Japanese dramas. &quot;Alice in Borderland&quot; (2020), &quot;Sanctuary&quot; (2023), and &quot;Tokyo Swindlers&quot; (2024) are emblematic examples of this trend. TBS&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Theater,&quot; renowned for its success with &quot;Naoki Hanzawa&quot; (2013), sought to counter this trend by producing &quot;Vivant&quot; (2023) with an unprecedented budget. However, reports indicate that the show failed to break even, ultimately running at a loss.

==Trendy dramas==
Most people associate today&#x27;s Japanese dramas with the modern style of screenwriting which has coined the term &quot;trendy dramas&quot;. The ultimate inspirations for many Japanese dramas are &quot;The Big Chill&quot; (1983) and &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot; (1985). The &quot;trendy&quot; formula was invented in the late 1980s when screenwriters decided to reach the television audience with themes that covered real-life Japan, at a time when the Japanese were experiencing a bubble economy. The &quot;trendy&quot; formula was improved in the early 1990s, when the story lines changed with the times. By gambling on harder issues, including teenage violence, child abuse, and modern family life, the trendy drama formula is tweaked to fit the television viewers&#x27; changing taste. Even today, the success of Japanese dramas is a result of sticking with the trendy drama formula. Many of these shows employ young actors who use them as springboards to bigger projects.

Although some people consider Super Sentai and tokusatsu type shows as dramas, they do not fit the &quot;trendy&quot; definition. Generally, most evening dramas aired nowadays are &quot;trendy dramas&quot;, and the term does not apply to other types of dramas such as &quot;asadora&quot;.

==Difference in focus between networks==
Dramas that are broadcast on Fuji Television (Fuji TV), NTV, and TBS are generally the most popular in any given season.

Fuji TV is widely known as the inventor of the drama formula. During the 1980s and 1990s, Fuji TV popularized trendy dramas with their use of young and popular actors/actresses. The network&#x27;s 9:00 p.m. dramas shown on Monday nights are commonly called &quot;Getsuku&quot; (a shortened phrase meaning Monday at 9), which historically have revolved around love stories. Although a popular time slot in the past in which dramas generally brought in high ratings during the season, the popularity of &quot;Getsuku&quot; dramas appears to have declined in recent years, with most dramas not crossing the 20% mark for average rating. Most modern &quot;Getsuku&quot; dramas have also abandoned the traditional love story format.

Other Japan television networks have their own focuses. TV Asahi, for example, focuses heavily on jidaigeki and crime stories (famous examples of the latter are the long-running series &quot;&quot;, now on its 21st season. Kasouken no Onna, now on its 21st season). NHK puts more effort into programming that reaches an older demographic, focusing mostly on epic period shows of historical significance, often with all-star casts, called &quot;taiga&quot; dramas, as well as inspiring dramas that focus on a young, strong-willed hero or heroine.

==Theme music and background music==
Theme music and background music set the overall tone of Japanese drama series. Most dramas will start off with one or two minutes of theme music during the opening credits. Other dramas will have, at the very least, a catchy melody in the beginning, displaying the show&#x27;s name for a few seconds, and then one to two minutes of ending theme music during the closing credits. Background music is placed and used at strategic points of the episode to set the mood.

There is a sub-genre of Japanese drama fans that are also huge fans of the drama&#x27;s original soundtrack. Most television networks work with music companies to produce original soundtracks. Most opening and closing theme music is written especially for the drama series, while other theme music is licensed from other sources. Once the library is put together, the television network will release the original soundtrack compact disc, usually a few weeks after the start of the drama. Closing themes are often sung by a popular J-pop singer or band.

NHK produces its own theme music and is one of the only Japanese television networks that has its own orchestra. Most of the theme music heard in their taiga and asadora dramas were written and produced in-house.

In recent years, many theme songs have been licensed from sources outside Japan. In some instances, theme songs have been licensed from some of the biggest names in the Western recording industry. This practice has disadvantages. When the Japanese drama is licensed outside Japan, theme music licensing becomes very costly. For example, in the Fuji TV drama &quot;Densha Otoko&quot;, the opening song and some of the background music had to be replaced in the release that aired on Hawaii&#x27;s Nippon Golden Network because they couldn&#x27;t get the rights to them.

==Importance of ratings==

As in many other countries, Japanese television is arguably the most important media type. A survey completed in 2000 by NHK, Japan&#x27;s public broadcasting network, showed that 95% of Japanese people watch television every day. Eighty-six percent said they consider television an indispensable medium, and 68% said the same of newspapers. There are other forms of media that can be used to promote products and services, such as the Internet. Most of television network, such as Fuji TV (CX) where operates Fuji Network System, also have online streaming website for service. However, Shinji Takada, a television executive at Nippon Television (NTV), believes that although the Internet is popular among drama fans, &quot;We don&#x27;t regard broadband as mainstream media. It will never happen. Broadband is a complementary medium.&quot;

Television ratings are calculated by several researching firms. Video Research Ltd. is one of the more reliable firms. More television networks, advertisers, and Japanese drama fans use the numbers from this firm than any other. The ratings focus on the Kanto (Tokyo) and the Kansai (Osaka) areas, which are believed to be a good representation of what most of Japan watches. The ratings become available for the general public every Wednesday.

===Rating system===
The rating system is very simple. All the major Japanese television networks make up the television market, so a research firm must determine the size of an average audience. The audience size is determined using two factors: the amount of content that is transmitted and the amount that is received, as market size varies from firm to firm. The viewer count of a given episode is calculated using a variety of polling methods. Ratings are calculated using a percentage or point system. This is based on the episode&#x27;s viewership numbers divided by the market size. Finally, the numbers are published on the research firm&#x27;s website. A hard copy is also produced.

There is no solid science on how to interpret these rating percentages. For fans, simply the drama with the highest percentage is the &quot;winner&quot; for the week. The fans use these numbers to decide which dramas they should watch during the remainder of the season. Despite this simple interpretation, there are one or more factors that may come into play that explain why some dramas receive higher percentage points than others. For example, evening dramas draw better ratings than those that air in the mornings and afternoons. Although the transmission size is virtually the same in the mornings, afternoons and evenings, the evenings draw higher numbers because most evening viewers work during the day, and fewer people are at home watching television. There are, however, some exceptions: For example, the NHK Asadora drama &quot;Oshin&quot; drew an average rating percentage of 52.6%, a number that would be extremely good for an evening drama but even more extraordinary for a drama that airs in the mornings and six days a week.

Finally, rating percentage plays a heavy role in the success of a drama artist. The numbers of an artist&#x27;s previous work are used by TV producers to determine whether or not the artist is a marketing success. If the ratings drawn by the artist&#x27;s previous work are good, they would be able to receive offers to star in dramas that are better written and produced. Likewise if the ratings drawn by the artist&#x27;s previous work are good, some artist could build their career as acting singer.

===Formula for good ratings===
In evening dramas, cast members are carefully selected and tend to be famous actors that audiences are very fond of. The choice of cast members frequently affects the drama&#x27;s audience rating, and pairing the right male and female artists is especially important in a renzoku ren&#x27;ai (romantic or love) drama. Cast members of morning and afternoon dramas are not as popular as those of evening dramas, as reflected by ratings, but with time good actors can gain popularity.

==Use of the term &quot;dorama&quot;==
 is a general term used in Japan to refer to drama series and soap operas, regardless of the country where they were filmed or produced. In the Western world, the word dorama was initially used to refer exclusively to Japanese television dramas, however in recent years it has become a general term used to refer to all Asian television dramas due to the international rise of Korean and Chinese dramas.

<text>Keeling House is a 16-storey block of flats located on Claredale Street in Bethnal Green, London, England. It was designed by Denys Lasdun and completed in 1957 as a cluster of four blocks of maisonettes arranged around a central service tower. A radical renovation in 2001 added a penthouse storey and concierge service.

==History==

Keeling House was originally part of a larger public housing scheme that also contained a low-rise council block called Bradley House. The building was erected following the completion of Lasdun&#x27;s two smaller buildings on Usk Street, Bethnal Green, with which it shares its &#x27;cluster&#x27; design. These were all council homes.

Lasdun was concerned that earlier modernist designs did not take sufficient account of what made neighbourhoods work. He sought to give residents a sense of place and belonging, replicating the good relations between neighbours which he noticed in traditional Victorian terraced streets. Each dwelling was a maisonette rather than a flat, similar inside to an East End house. Unlike a flat slab or tower block, he designed Keeling House with four wings that each look onto another, encouraging contact between neighbours. Between the central lift tower and the front doors of the apartments, tenants had to pass communal &#x27;drying areas&#x27; for laundry and storage, where he hoped that social interchange would be as natural as in the streets below. However, he also designed the homes for privacy; the balconies face outward and do not look onto one another.

Keeling House was initially popular with residents. However, it later suffered from the social problems that affected many council estates in the 1970s and 1980s. Tower Hamlets Council closed the block in 1992, due to fears over the original construction quality. 

In 1993, the building was designated a Grade II* listed building. This was the second example of post-war council housing being granted a listing, closely after Neave Brown&#x27;s Alexandra road estate. Tower Hamlets could not afford to renovate it and in 1999 sold it to a private developer. It was converted into luxury apartments between 1999 and 2001. Key features of the renovation include a striking glass foyer with external water feature designed by local architects Munkenbeck and Marshall, and eight penthouses on what had previously been the service roof of a 15-storey building. Lasdun, who died in 2001, visited the project and supported the plans including the addition of penthouse flats, but regretted that the building would no longer house the poor. The redevelopment won an RIBA Award in 2002 and a Civic Trust commendation.

Bradley House, however, was demolished in 2005. Its site was redeveloped by Tower Hamlets Community Homes, a housing association, and Hill Partnerships as part of a mixed-tenure development opened in 2009.

<doc id="796133" wikidata="Q10386604" url="?curid=796133" title="USS Achilles (ARL-41)">
<text>USS &quot;LST-455&quot; was a United States Navy used in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater during World War II. She was converted at Sydney, Australia, into an , shortly after commissioning, and used in the repairing of landing craft. Named after the Greek hero Achilles, she was the only US Naval vessel to bear the name.

==Construction and career==
&quot;LST-455&quot; was laid down on 3 August 1942, under Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull 975, by Kaiser Shipyards, Vancouver, Washington; launched on 17 October 1942; and commissioned on 30 January 1943.

=== Service in the United States Navy ===
==== World War II ====
Adjudged ready for service, &quot;LST-455&quot; sailed from San Diego on 20 February, for San Francisco and shifted thence to Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, and, later, to the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, where she completed fitting out and manning. She cleared the Golden Gate on 8 March, bound for the South Pacific and, a month and a day later, arrived in Samoan waters, en route to Australia. She ultimately reached Sydney, New South Wales, via Wellington, New Zealand, on 2 May 1943. However, while she had been en route, plans were made that would significantly change her operations in the years that lay ahead.

====Conversion to repair ship====
Amphibious assaults on Japanese-held islands in the South and Southwest Pacific Theater had involved virtually hundreds of landing craft of all types and sizes, ranging from small craft to infantry landing craft (LCIs) and tank landing craft (LCTs). Since these specialized assault craft, of comparatively light construction, could not be repaired with the few facilities and men available to them alone, orders went out that several tank landing ships (LSTs) would be converted to special landing craft repair ships (later classified as ARL). However, modifying existing LSTs in stateside yards required time, a critical commodity in the fairly steady pace of the amphibious island-hopping campaigns, that the forces fighting at the front did not have. At this point, &quot;LST-455&quot;, then in Australian waters, came under the gaze of these amphibious planners. In one month, lathes, welding machines, as well as cutting outfits and repair tools for the necessary types of craft, were installed on board. Departmental shops of many kinds: ranging from machine shops to motor repair work, to shipfitting, to metalsmith, to electric, and radio repair, took shape in what had once been the cavernous tank deck. Experienced personnel, trained in ship repair work, were assigned to the ship and almost doubled the size of her complement. Experienced personnel, trained in ship repair work, were assigned to the ship and almost doubled the size of her complement. Ready for service by the latter part of May 1943, the former tank landing ship departed Australian waters, bound for New Guinea, and arrived at Naval Base Milne Bay in Milne Bay on 2 June 1943. She immediately commenced the work for which she had been converted, repairing LCIs under the guidance of the repair officer of .

====Occupation of Lae====

On 4 September 1943, Vice Admiral Daniel E. Barbey&#x27;s 7th Fleet Amphibious Forces put Australian troops ashore on the Huon Peninsula, near Lae, New Guinea. &quot;LST-455&quot; moved up to support these operations from Morobe Bay and lay anchored there among the Allied ships, presenting a tempting target by virtue of the nest of LCIs alongside. Nine Japanese dive bombers, escorted by nine &quot;Zero&quot; fighters, attacked the shipping in Morobe Bay and singled out &quot;LST-455&quot; for attention, scoring a direct hit aft. A large bomb hit the stern, passed through the galley, and exploded in the crew&#x27;s quarters, aft, starting fires and trapping men in the after steering room. Determined sailors battled the blaze and cut through bulkheads to rescue the trapped men. The damage control measures were directed by the ship&#x27;s commanding officer, Lieutenant William E. Peterson, Jr., USNR, who had relieved Lieutenant Cisin in August, and won him a Navy Cross for personal heroism. Although she had been heavily hit, &quot;LST-455&quot; shot down two of the attackers. By nightfall, her men had extinguished the blaze and commenced initial repairs. She had suffered the loss of 18 men killed; 11 were wounded; and six men were missing. then towed &quot;LST-455&quot; to Milne Bay where the repair ship was berthed alongside &quot;Rigel&quot;. However, the need for &quot;LST-455&quot;″s services was so urgent that she was soon back to work repairing LCIs even though her own severe damage had not yet been fully corrected.

====Western New Guinea====

In March 1944, LST-455 received orders to proceed to Buna, New Guinea, to ready landing craft for the impending invasion of western New Guinea. In May, she shifted to Alexishafen, New Guinea, and over the ensuing weeks tended her charges there, and at Sek Harbor and Bqstran Bay. For her work on two flotillas of LCI&#x27;s, the ship received commendation from Vice Admiral Barbey, commanding the Seventh Fleet&#x27;s Amphibious Forces.

====Invasion of the Philippines====
On 21 August 1944, the ship was named &quot;Achilles&quot; and reclassified officially as a landing craft repair ship, ARL-41. Soon thereafter, she proceeded north to participate in the reconquest of the Philippine Islands. As the invasion proceeded, all Service Force ships were shifted to anchorages off Samar, in San Pedro Bay. There &quot;Achilles&quot; saw daily evidence of a new weapon unveiled by the Japanese in their relentless attempt to disrupt the American offensive: the kamikaze (&quot;Divine Wind&quot;), planes flown by Japanese pilots on one-way missions of destruction.

During the first four days of November, the weather provided a respite from the kamikaze, although it came in the form of a typhoon which buffeted the ship. When the clouds finally cleared, the kamikaze returned. Around 13:00 on 12 November 1944, after sporadic alerts during the morning, &quot;Achilles&quot; received a warning that bogeys were in the vicinity. The ship immediately went to general quarters to watch and wait as before. Lookouts soon pinpointed three &quot;Zeros&quot; heading on a course that would take them across &quot;Achilles&quot;″ bow. As the landing craft repair ship&#x27;s forward guns commenced firing, one plane passed ahead; the second, however, turned tightly and commenced a dive straight at &quot;Achilles&quot; as she and the four LCIs moored to her lay immobile. The repair ship&#x27;s gunners scored hits on the diving aircraft, but could not stop it. The aircraft crashed into the ship forward, its motor tearing through the main deck. The aircraft itself hit the forward deckhouse in the carpenter shop, where number one repair party had gathered at its battle station. After the deafening explosion that wiped out the repair party, orange-red flames (caused by gasoline from the burning aircraft) swept across the weather deck, while parts of the &quot;Zero&quot; tumbled through the air, some landing astern. Fires immediately spread, their progress unchecked due to the disruption of the forward fire mains upon impact of the aircraft. The kamikaze crash had killed 19 men and wounded an additional 28; 14 men were unaccounted for, many of these literally blown to bits in the explosion that followed the suicider&#x27;s impacting the ship. Yet, as the ship&#x27;s chronicler wrote later: &quot;The bravery and coolness of the men battling the fires and helping the wounded makes one proud of the &quot;Achilles&quot;″ crew . . .&quot;

Exemplifying this bravery was Ray Dunwoody, a civilian technician, whose conduct had earned him the recommendation for a Navy Cross. Although regulations did not permit the award of such a decoration to a civilian, Dunwoody did, in fact, later receive a commendation letter in which his heroism was recognized fully.

====Borneo operations====

In the latter half of February 1945, and early March, &quot;Achilles&quot; returned via Biak to Leyte, but quickly proceeded to Subic Bay and Mindoro, spending a week in each place, tending LSMs and carrying out her vital support work. During the latter part of April, &quot;Achilles&quot; moved down to Morotai, in the Netherlands East Indies, for further tender duty, readying landing craft for the impending invasion of Borneo. Participating in the initial landings at Brunei Bay, Borneo, &quot;Achilles&quot; again came under air attack, when a &quot;Dinah&quot; loosed two bombs that landed off her starboard beam. This attack, on 10 June 1945, caused no damage to the ship, although shrapnel wounded two men in &quot;Achilles&quot;` crew. The repair ship remained at Borneo until she returned to the Philippines late in July to join the forces marshalling there for the projected invasion of the Japanese homeland. However, the capitulation of Japan in mid-August obviated &quot;Operation Olympic&quot; (the assault against the home islands of Japan) but did not end operations for &quot;Achilles&quot;. She repaired landing craft into the fall of 1945, relieved on station by . Proceeding to Hawaii, &quot;Achilles&quot;, in company with , reached Pearl Harbor on the last day of October.

====Reposition to New Orleans====
After five days at that Pacific base, which had provided &quot;the first glimpse of civilization in over two years&quot; to veteran sailors of Achilles, the repair ship departed Hawaiian waters, bound for California, and passed through the Golden Gate on 28 November 1945. Anchoring in San Francisco Bay and disembarking 165 passengers brought from Pearl Harbor, &quot;Achilles&quot; proceeded thence to Stockton, California, for repairs to her generators and heating system. She remained there until getting away for the Gulf of Mexico on 4 January 1946.

Transiting the Panama Canal on 20 January, and lingering for a day at Colón, Panama, on the Atlantic side of the isthmus, the repair ship reached New Orleans before the end of January and soon commenced work preparing LSMs and LCSs for inactivation, a task she performed into the summer. Decommissioned on 19 July 1946, &quot;Achilles&quot; was stricken from the Navy Register on 28 August 1946.

===Service in the Republic of China Navy===
On 14 March 1947, the Navy decided to transfer &quot;Achilles&quot; to China under lend-lease; and, on 8 September 1947, the repair ship was delivered to representatives of the Chinese Navy at New Orleans. Commissioned as ROCS &quot;Hsing An&quot; (), on 5 November 1947, she sailed for China two days later.

On 23 April 1949, after the Communist Chinese seized the control of the harbor of Nanking, the commander of the Second Fleet of Chinese Navy, Major General Lin Zun(林遵) surrendered the fleet to the Communists. Eighteen of twenty-three ships disobeyed the order to surrender and decided to break through. This event is known as the breakthrough in the Yangtze River (), Or the Yangtze Fleet Uprising. The Yangtze 2nd Fleet was ordered to retreat. The local flotilla commander Lin Zu decided to switch sides and join the PLA, actually allowing commanding officers to vote their intention. Some warships complied with the Orders and attempted to escape, directed by the Admirable-class minesweeper ROCS Yong Jia. Commander Lin Zu’s flagship was escort ship Hui An (ex-Japanese vessel Shisaka) but he decided to avoid opening gunfire against the departing warships but attempted to call them back. Four ships returned including the riverine gunboat Chu Tung. While some sources indicate that there had been naval gunfire, this is denied by PLAN account and it seems the warships only received fire from ground artillery of the PLA. This ship failed to escape, along with other six ships, and was run aground by the mutiny fleet and her position was shelled by artillery. The ship was then captured by the Communist forces.

=== Service in the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy ===
The communists salvaged her, refitted her, and renamed her Dagu Shan (U891) and commissioned into the East Sea Fleet once it was established and Equipment and Technology Department.

The ship was then renamed &quot;Haixiu 891&quot; (U891) which was a subordinate to the East China Fleet Equipment and Technology Department.

<text>At least two United States Navy ships have borne the name Achilles, in honor of the Greek hero Achilles:

* The first was the name briefly given to the monitor on 15 June 1869.
* The second was an tank landing ship converted into an repair ship. Initially commissioned on 30 January 1943 and decommissioned on 19 July 1946, she was sold to the Chinese.

<text>The following is the 1966–67 network television schedule for the three major English language commercial broadcast networks in the United States. The schedule covers primetime hours from September 1966 through August 1967. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series cancelled after the 1965–66 season.

New fall series are highlighted in bold.

Each of the 30 highest-rated shows is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.

: Yellow indicates the programs in the top 10 for the season.
: Cyan indicates the programs in the top 20 for the season.
: Magenta indicates the programs in the top 30 for the season.

&quot;Note: This is the first full season in which practically all prime time programs were broadcast in color.&quot;

NET or National Educational Television, was in operation, but the schedule was set by each affiliated station.

<text>Allotransplant (&quot;allo-&quot; meaning &quot;other&quot; in Greek) is the transplantation of cells, tissues, or organs to a recipient from a genetically non-identical donor of the same species. The transplant is called an allograft, allogeneic transplant, or homograft. Most human tissue and organ transplants are allografts.

It is contrasted with autotransplantation (from one part of the body to another in the same person), syngenic transplantation of isografts (grafts transplanted between two genetically identical individuals) and xenotransplantation (from other species).

Allografts can be referred to as &quot;homostatic&quot; if they are biologically inert when transplanted, such as bone and cartilage.

An immune response against an allograft or xenograft is termed rejection. An allogenic bone marrow transplant can result in an immune attack on the recipient, called graft-versus-host disease.

Material is obtained from a donor who is a living person, or a deceased person&#x27;s body receiving mechanical support or ventilation, or a deceased person&#x27;s body whose heart stopped beating. Screening for pathology and risk factors for communicable diseases such as HIV and Hepatitis B and C is then conducted.

In the US, donor tissue must be recovered and processed adhering to the Current Good Tissue Practices rule. In most cases, it is sent to tissue banks for processing and distribution. Each year, Food and Drug Administration regulated and American Association of Tissue Banks-accredited tissue banks distribute 1.5 million bone and tissue allografts.

==Transplantable organs and tissues==

A variety of organs and tissues can be used for allografts, including:
* Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) repair
* Joint reconstruction in the knee and ankle
* Meniscal replacement
* Reconstruction due to cancer or trauma
* Ridge augmentation in dental procedures
* Shoulder repair
* Spinal fusion
* Urological procedures
* Skin transplants
* Corneal transplants
* Heart transplants
* Heart valves
* Lung transplantation
* Intestinal transplantation (isolated small bowel, intestine &amp; liver, multivisceral)
* Liver transplants
* Kidney transplants
* Pancreas transplantation
* Islet cell transplantation
* Bone marrow transplants
* Bone allograft
* Ligament or tendon allograft

==Laws and regulations==

=== United States ===
In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has regulated human tissue intended for transplants since 1993. In order to ensure the quality of donor tissue and reduce contamination and disease transmission risks, three regulations addressing manufacturing activities associated with human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps) were promulgated in May 2005:
* companies producing and distributing HCT/Ps must register with the FDA.
* &quot;Donor Eligibility&quot; rule: prescribes criteria for donor eligibility.
* &quot;Current Good Tissue Practices&quot; rule: oversees overall processing and distribution practices of each company.

==Other transplant options==
* Autograft, tissue transplanted from one site to another on the same patient. An autograft reduces the risk of rejection but requires a second surgery site, adding pain, risk and possible longer aftercare.
* Xenograft, a transplant from another species
* Isograft, a transplant from a genetically identical donor, such as an identical twin.
* Synthetic and metal implants. Unlike allografts, such grafts do not corporate into the body.

==Risks==
As with many operations, allotransplantation risks some side effects. A limiting factor in tissue allotransplantation for reconstructive surgery deals with the side effects of immunosuppression (metabolic disorders, malignancies, opportunistic infections) which is a predominant issue. The risk of transmitting infection is high.

<text>2 Willow Road is part of a terrace of three houses in Hampstead, London designed by architect Ernő Goldfinger and completed in 1939. It has been managed by the National Trust since 1995 and is open to the public. It was one of the first Modernist buildings acquired by the Trust, giving rise to some controversy. Goldfinger lived there with his wife Ursula and their children until his death in 1987.

==History==
Initially, Goldfinger planned to build a block of studio flats, believing that flat living was a more socially conscious choice for modern architects. This idea was rejected by the London County Council in 1936. He then revised his designs to include a block of three houses, retaining the concrete frame integral to Goldfinger&#x27;s Modernist philosophy. He submitted these revised plans at the end of 1937. The construction of 2 Willow Road, was completed in the summer of 1939 constructed from concrete and a facing of red brick. 

A number of cottages were demolished to allow for the construction, which was strongly opposed by a number of local residents including novelist Ian Fleming and the future Conservative Home Secretary Henry Brooke. This incident led Fleming to name his villain Auric Goldfinger by way of revenge. No. 2, which Goldfinger designed specifically as his own family home, is the largest of the three houses and features a spiral staircase designed by engineer Ove Arup at its core. The building is supported by a concrete frame, part of which is external, leaving room for a spacious uncluttered interior, perhaps inspired by the &quot;Raumplan&quot; ideas of modernist architect Adolf Loos.

==Today==
Goldfinger himself designed much of the furniture in No. 2, and the house also contains a significant collection of 20th-century art by Bridget Riley, Prunella Clough, Marcel Duchamp, Eduardo Paolozzi, Henry Moore and Max Ernst.

Nos. 1 and 3 remain private homes.

<text>A Combat Support Hospital (CSH, pronounced &quot;cash&quot;) is a type of modern United States Army field hospital. The CSH is transportable by aircraft and trucks and is normally delivered to the Corps Support Area in standard military-owned demountable containers (MILVAN) cargo containers. Once transported, it is assembled by the staff into a tent hospital to treat patients. Depending upon the operational environment (e.g., battlefield), a CSH might also treat civilians and wounded enemy soldiers. The CSH is the successor to the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH).

From November 2017, the United States Army and United States Army Reserve began reorganizing combat support hospitals into smaller, modular units called &quot;field hospitals&quot;.

==Facility==
The size of a combat support hospital is not limited, since tents can be chained together; it will typically deploy with between 44 and 248 hospital beds, with 44 beds being most common. For patient care the CSH is climate-controlled, and has pharmacy, laboratory, X-Ray (often including a CT Scanner) and dental capabilities (ATP 4-02.5 Casualty Care, May 2013). It provides its own power from generators.

The great operational advantage of the Deployable Medical Systems (DEPMEDS) facility is the use of single or double expanding ISO containers or units to create hard-sided, air conditioned, sterile operating rooms and intensive care facilities, which can produce surgical outcomes similar to that seen in fixed facility hospitals and do so in an austere environment.

==Function==

Because they are large and relatively difficult to move, combat support hospitals are not the front line of battlefield medicine. Battalion aid stations, the medical companies of Brigade Support Battalions and Forward Surgical Teams are usually the first point of contact medical care for wounded soldiers. The CSH receives most patients via helicopter air ambulance, and stabilizes these patients for further treatment at fixed facility hospitals. Ideally, the CSH is located as the bridge between incoming helicopter ambulances and outgoing air force aircraft.

The CSH is capable of providing definitive care for many cases. Current medical doctrine does not encourage wounded soldiers, if they are not expected to quickly return to operational status, to stay in the combat zone. This is a pragmatic decision as the resources are usually available to bring them home quickly. Military aircraft constantly fly into a theater of operations loaded with equipment and supplies, but often lack a back cargo. Given that adequate &quot;airlift&quot; is usually present, it is easy to evacuate wounded promptly. For this reason, the CSH bed capacity is not as heavily used as in past conflicts.

The CSH will generally have a ground ambulance company attached. This company consists of approximately four platoons of ground ambulances commanded by a Medical Service Corps officer. The ground ambulance company in cooperation with available air ambulances Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC) is responsible for the movement of sick and wounded from the battalion aid station and other forward-deployed locations to the CSH, as well as evacuation through an established medical treatment chain leading ultimately, for those seriously sick or wounded, to hospitals in the Continental United States in cooperation with resources in the U.S. Air Force.

The CSH is larger than its predecessor, the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital. It is commanded by a colonel, rather than a lieutenant colonel.

A fully staffed CSH has over 600 people when fully staffed and 248 beds. The modular nature of the organization allows for partial deployments, and the full unit is not often deployed (ATP 4.02-5 Casualty Care, May 2013).

==History and past configurations==
In 1973 and 1974, the 28th Surgical Hospital (Mobile) (Army) (MASH) helped phase-in new designs for operating rooms and patient facilities from the previous canvas tents. Since then, all other configurations of army deployable hospitals have been inactivated or reconfigured to the CSH configuration. The last to convert was the 212th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital.

In the mid-1970s the Medical Unit, Self-contained, Transportable (MUST) designation was applied. During the Cold War, with conflict possible against the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact, active duty MUST units were staffed by all the basic personnel necessary (e.g., medics, X-ray techs, pharmacists, cooks, clerks). Doctors, nurses and specialists would be mobilized and mate up with the unit in the field. The unit would be flown to West Germany, withdraw pre-positioned complete hospital MUST equipment and military vehicles from warehouses and then deploy. It contained all necessary functions to provide care for 200 beds, including two intensive care units, eight medical wards, an emergency room, four operating rooms, an orthopedic room, a laboratory, an X-ray, a pharmacy and the unit&#x27;s transport vehicles. It consisted of hard containers, which would be transported to the designated site, then the wheels would be removed and then expanded. They housed the operating rooms, laboratory, X-ray, and pharmacy. Inflatable shelters were used to provide double wall insulated areas for the patient care areas of the hospital. These &quot;inflatables&quot; required a power system called a &quot;utility pack&quot; (also known as a &quot;U-pack&quot; or &quot;power station&quot;) to provide utility services, heat, cooling, inflation, hot water, and filtered air from chemical, biological, and radiological contaminants. The utility pack was powered by a centrifugal flow gas turbine engine (Libby Welding Co. Model LPU-71, Airesearch Model PPU85-5, AmerTech Co. Model APP-1, or Hollingsworth Model JHTWX10/96). It provided electricity at 60 Hz AC, 400 Hz AC, and 24 VDC. At 250 beds, the hospital required eight U-packs. Each consumed of jet fuel per hour. After several years of using inflatables they were abandoned in the mid-1980s, largely due to the weight of the inflatables, and the amount of fuel required just to keep the tents from collapsing.

Under the 1980s &quot;Army of Excellence&quot; Table of Organization and Equipment, the MASHs had the task of providing enough emergency, life-saving surgery so that patients could live to be evacuated to hospitals further to the rear from the fighting line. The Combat Support Hospitals were 200+ bed hospitals that, after the MASHs, were next closest to the front line. The CSHs &quot;specialize[d] in performing surgery on patients whose condition [was] not life-threatening.&quot; Behind the CSHs, but still within the Corps rear area, were the 400-bed evacuation hospitals, which provided resuscitative and restorative care. The basis of allocation for planning purposes was one MASH, one CSH, and two EVAC hospitals per Division supported, for a total of 1,060 beds per Division. General Hospitals in the Communications Zone (if one were established) or in the Continental United States would provide definitive care. Actual bed requirements would be driven by combat intensity and the theater evacuation policy.

<text>USS &quot;Achomawi&quot; (AT-148/ATF-148) was an &quot;Abnaki&quot;-class fleet ocean tug in the service of the United States Navy, and was named for the Achomawi tribe of Native Americans.

&quot;Achomawi&quot; was laid down as AT-148 on 15 January 1944 at Charleston, South Carolina by Charleston Shipbuilding and Drydock, redesignated ATF-148 on 15 May 1944, and launched on 14 June 1944, sponsored by Mrs. J. F. Veronee. The ship was commissioned on 11 November 1944 at Charleston Navy Yard.

==Service history==
The tug departed Charleston on 28 November bound for the Chesapeake Bay for shakedown training. She then entered the Norfolk Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Virginia, for post-shakedown availability. Late in December, &quot;Achomawi&quot; arrived back at Charleston but soon sailed for Wilmington, North Carolina to pick up &quot;ARDC-J&quot; for towing to the west coast. The tug transited the Panama Canal late in January 1945 and continued on to San Pedro, California where she arrived on 17 February. &quot;Achomawi&quot; operated along the west coast through 3 March. On that day, she got underway from San Francisco bound for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii with two pontoon barges in tow. Upon her arrival in Hawaiian waters on 16 March, the tug commenced target towing and mooring duties in the Pearl Harbor area and remained at the task until 22 May, when she shaped a course to Okinawa with three barges in tow. She made stops at Eniwetok and Guam before reaching Okinawa on 1 July. The vessel then assisted in moving Service Division 104 from Kerama Retto to Buckner Bay, Okinawa. She set sail on 12 July with a convoy bound for Guam.

&quot;Achomawi&quot; reached Guam on 17 July and, five days later, got underway for Eniwetok. At that atoll, she assumed duty with Service Division 102 and operated there through the end of World War II in mid-August. On 15 October, she shaped a course for Tokyo, Japan. The tug arrived there 10 days later and departed Japanese waters on 9 November, bound for Ulithi. At that atoll, the tug took oil tanker in tow and got underway for the Philippine Islands. She reached Manila on 19 November and operated in the Luzon area through 6 December. Later that month, &quot;Achomawi&quot; attempted to tow three barges from Samar, Philippine Islands, to Okinawa. En route, two broke loose due to heavy seas and were lost. The third capsized due to shifting cargo and had to be destroyed. The tug finally arrived at Okinawa on 29 December. On 12 January 1946, &quot;Achomawi&quot; got underway for the west coast of the United States. She made port calls at Eniwetok, Kwajalein, Johnston Island, and Pearl Harbor. The tug finally made San Francisco on 3 March.

&quot;Achomawi&quot; departed California in early April to return to the western Pacific to support Operation &quot;Crossroads,&quot; which involved atomic testing at Bikini Atoll. Following the &quot;Able&quot; test on 1 July, the tug attempted to take the heavily damaged Japanese light cruiser &quot;Sakawa&quot; in tow, in an effort to beach the vessel. A tow line was connected, but as &quot;Achomawi&quot; prepared to get underway the cruiser began to sink. The &quot;Sakawa&quot; threatened to pull the tug under with her own tow wire, but quick-acting sailors were able to sever the wire with an acetylene torch before damage resulted. The cruiser went to the bottom with a portion of &quot;Achomawi&quot;&#x27;s tow wire still attached. Throughout the remainder of the operation the tug carried out various towing assignments between Pearl Harbor, Bikini, Eniwetok, and Kwajalein, and was released in August. &quot;Achomawi&quot; left Hawaii on 14 September, and arrived in San Francisco Bay on 2 October, where it underwent radiological decontamination.

Early in December, &quot;Achomawi&quot; received orders to proceed to the Panama Canal Zone. She touched at Balboa, Panama, on 29 December and picked up &quot;ARD-6&quot; for towing to Jacksonville, Florida. The tug then transited the canal and reached Jacksonville on 4 January 1947. After delivering her tow, she set a course for New Orleans, Louisiana. Upon her arrival on 9 January, the ship entered preinactivation availability. &quot;Achomawi&quot; completed this in early March and got underway on 9 March for Orange, Texas. She was decommissioned there on 10 June 1947 and was laid up at Orange. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 September 1962. The vessel was then transferred to the Maritime Administration and was laid up at Mobile, Alabama.

&quot;Achomawi&quot; was removed from the reserve fleet in June of 1987, and towed to Bethlehem Shipyard for repairs. She returned from the shipyard the following month. In 1991, the ship was sold to the government of Taiwan, where she entered service with the Republic of China Navy as ROCS &quot;Da Gang&quot; (ATF-554). The vessel is in active service as of 2013.

<text>Crystal Lake, the largest lake of this name in Michigan, is located near Lake Michigan in Benzie County about southwest of Traverse City and about northeast of Frankfort at . It measures approximately , and has a maximum depth of . At , it is Michigan&#x27;s ninth largest inland lake. Up to and through the American Civil War years Crystal Lake was known as &quot;Cap Lake&quot; due to the frequent whitecaps visible on its surface. Crystal Lake is adjacent to the southern reaches of the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore.

In 1873, an effort was made to connect Crystal Lake with Lake Michigan via a channel. The lake level of Crystal Lake was higher than that of Lake Michigan and when the channel was opened, the water level in Crystal Lake dropped about . Although the project was a failure, the lowering of the lake level uncovered sandy beaches, including the current public beach at Beulah.

The watershed that feeds Crystal Lake is very small, and fertilizer and sewage outflows are minimal, leading to the exceptionally clear water that gives it its current name. The surface area of the lake is 35% of the total area of the drainage basin (land and water combined).

<text>NEdit, the Nirvana editor, is a text editor and source code editor for the X Window System. It has an interface similar to text editors on Microsoft Windows and Macintosh, rather than to older UNIX editors like Emacs. It was initially developed by Mark Edel for Fermilab and released under a very restrictive licence, but today it is distributed under the less restrictive GPL-2.0-or-later (plus Motif clause) and is developed as an independent open-source project by a team of developers. Nedit was also distributed with the IRIX operating system.

NEdit is extensible through a C-like macro language, and it features automatic indentation and syntax highlighting for a wide variety of computer languages. NEdit can also process tags files generated using the Unix ctags command or the Exuberant Ctags program.

Its user interface is built using the Motif toolkit, which made it an immediate success with a wide range of Unix platforms whose user interfaces use that toolkit. For a fully open source version, the alternative LessTif library could be used instead, but more recently the main Motif toolkit was made open source as well.

Major development on SourceForge stopped in 2010, with minor updates being made as recently as February 2017. According to the project&#x27;s news page the source repository has been converted from CVS to Git in September 2014.

Version 5.6 was released in December 2014, after more than ten years since the release of the previous version, reflecting changes made during the time. This code is based on what was in the Debian NEdit package for some time.

== XNEdit - Unicode support ==
From 2018, development continued on GitHub in the form of XNEdit, a fork of NEdit version 5.7. Version 1.4 offers full Unicode support, antialiased text rendering, modern Open/Save dialog and Drag&amp;Drop of tabs.

<text>Dialogues with Madwomen is a 1993 documentary by Allie Light focusing on mental illness in women. It was later aired on television on the PBS series &quot;POV&quot;.

==Synopsis==
In &quot;Dialogues with Madwomen&quot;, filmmakers Allie Light and Irving Saraf have seven &quot;madwomen&quot; — including Light herself — into telling their stories. Using a mixture of home movies, archival footage of psychiatric wards, re-enactments, and interviews with their subjects, Light and Saraf have created a complex, moving portrait of women in whom depression, schizophrenia, and multiple personalities coexist with powerful, sometimes inspired levels of creativity. Several of the women talk about traumatic experiences like childhood abuse, rape, homelessness and racism. In their stories of therapy, they mention therapist approaches like “One weekend he told me I could go home if I promised to bake a turkey. The next weekend I could go home if I promised to mop all the floors.” Throughout their stories, the participants find different ways to return to everyday life. The movie ends with the information that participant Karen Wong was murdered shortly after the interviews were finished.

The film does not openly criticise circumstances that led to mental health issues, or the ways the women were treated. Their statements stand alone, for the viewer to form their own impression and opinion. No shocking videos or photos are used, the intensity of the stories remains in the words of the participants.

<text>Opera Mail (formerly known as M2) is the email and news client developed by Opera Software. It was an integrated component within the Opera web browser from version 2 through 12. With the release of Opera 15 in 2013, Opera Mail became a separate product and is no longer bundled with Opera. Opera Mail version 1.0 is available for OS X and Windows. It features rich text support and inline spell checking, spam filtering (both automated and Bayesian), a contact manager, and supports POP3 and IMAP, newsgroups, and Atom and RSS feeds.

Opera Mail uses one database that keeps an index of all mail and sorts the messages automatically into several &quot;views&quot; or access points. Messages are automatically sorted by types, such as mailing lists, and mail with attachments. This approach to indexing allows for quicker access to messages. For instance, a message sent to a mailing list with a word document attached will appear in both the &quot;Documents&quot; attachment view and in the &quot;Mailing lists&quot; view. Opera Mail can also use Bayesian filtering to automatically sort messages into other views. All messages in the database are accessed by opening the &quot;Received&quot; view.

The integrated mail component included a simple IRC client, but this is no longer present in the standalone program. The IRC client supported multiple servers, file transfers, and interface customization through CSS.

Opera Mail can display text and HTML emails and uses the Presto layout engine to display HTML.

Opera Mail is at the end-of-life stage of its product lifecycle; this means neither technical support nor product and security updates will be provided. The product is no longer available for download. Users of Opera Mail who have large amounts of email and would like to utilize 64-bit performance can use the 64-bit build of the Opera Web Browser, which is the same code contained in the standalone email client. 

In November 2020, Vivaldi has launched a Technical Preview of its email client, Vivaldi Mail which many users have considered it to be a spiritual successor to Opera M2.

<text>The City of Sydney is the local government area covering the Sydney central business district and surrounding inner city suburbs of the Greater Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Established by Act of Parliament in 1842, the City of Sydney is the oldest, and the oldest-surviving, local government authority in New South Wales, and the second-oldest in Australia, with only the City of Adelaide being older by two years.

Given its prominent position, historically, geographically, economically and socially, the City of Sydney has long been a source of political interest and intrigue. As a result of this, the boundaries, constitution and legal basis of the council have changed many times throughout its history, often to suit the governing party of the State of New South Wales. The City of Sydney is currently governed under the City of Sydney Act, 1988, which defines and limits the powers, election method, constitution and boundaries of the council area. On 6 February 2004, the former local government area of the City of South Sydney, which itself had been created in 1989 from areas formerly part of the City of Sydney (including Alexandria, Darlington, Erskineville, Newtown and Redfern), was formally merged into the City of Sydney and the current city boundaries date from this merger.

The leader of the City of Sydney is known as the Lord Mayor of Sydney, currently held since 27 March 2004 by Clover Moore, who also served concurrently as the state Member of Parliament for Sydney and Bligh from 1988 to 2012.

==History==


The name &quot;Sydney&quot; comes from &quot;Sydney Cove&quot; which is where the English Governor (later Admiral) Arthur Phillip established the first settlement, after arriving with the First Fleet. On 26 January 1788, he named it after Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney, who was the Home Secretary at the time, and the man responsible for the plan for the convict colony in Australia.

The &quot;City of Sydney&quot; was established on 20 July 1842 by the Corporation Act which encompasses present-day Woolloomooloo, Surry Hills, Chippendale and Pyrmont, an area of 11.65 km2. There were six wards established by boundary posts. These wards were: Gipps, Brisbane, Macquarie, Bourke, Cook and Phillip. A boundary post still exists in front of Sydney Square.

The boundaries of the City of Sydney have changed fairly regularly since 1900. The bankrupt Municipality of Camperdown was merged with the city in 1909. As a result of the Local Government (Areas) Act 1948, the municipalities of Alexandria, Darlington, Erskineville, Newtown, Redfern, The Glebe, Waterloo, and Paddington were added to the city. In 1968 the boundaries were changed and many of these suburbs moved to be part of a new municipality of South Sydney. South Sydney was brought back into the city in 1982, but became separate again under the City of Sydney Act of 1988 and then became smaller than its original size at 6.19 km2. It grew again in February 2004 with the merger of the two council areas, and now has a population of approximately 170,000 people.

These changes in boundaries have often resulted in control of the council by the governing party in the Parliament of New South Wales at the time; the Labor Party often sought to have traditional working-class suburbs like Redfern, Erskineville, Alexandria and Waterloo included in the council area, and the Liberal Party and its predecessors often desired a smaller council area focused on inner-Sydney or a limited/broader voting franchise. A 1987 re-organisation initiated by a Labor state government and completed in 1989 under a Liberal Coalition government saw the City of Sydney split again, with southern suburbs forming the City of South Sydney, a moved that advantaged the government of the day, as the southern suburbs now in South Sydney Council had traditionally voted Labor.

On 8 May 2003 the Labor state Government partially undid this change, when approximately 40% of the South Sydney City Council area was merged back into the City of Sydney including Camperdown, Chippendale, Darlington, East Sydney, Kings Cross and Woolloomooloo. Glebe was also transferred back from Leichhardt Council to the City of Sydney. On 6 February 2004, the remaining parts of the South Sydney City Council were merged into the City of Sydney. Critics claimed that this was performed with the intention of creating a &quot;super-council&quot; which would be under the control of Labor, which also controlled the NSW Government. Subsequent to this merger, an election took place on 27 March 2004 which resulted in the independent candidate Clover Moore defeating the high-profile Labor candidate, former federal minister Michael Lee and winning the position of Lord Mayor.

=== Boundary ===
The current City of Sydney Local Government Area (LGA) covers about .

City of Sydney provides an official map of the LGA. Alternatively the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales provides an interactive map of the Sydney LGA.

==== Historical boundaries ====
The City of Sydney is traditionally the governing authority for Sydney&#x27;s city centre. However, the boundaries of the City of Sydney have always been larger than the city centre or CBD. For example, Pyrmont has been in the City of Sydney since 1842 but is usually considered to be an inner western suburb, not a part of the Sydney city centre or CBD.
The postcode zone 2000 is also roughly correlative with the city centre.

==Council==


===Current composition and election method ===
Sydney City Council is composed of ten Councillors, including the Lord Mayor, for a fixed four-year term of office. The Lord Mayor is directly elected while the nine other Councillors are elected proportionally. The Deputy Lord Mayor is elected annually by the councillors.

The most recent election was held on 14 September 2024, and the makeup of the council, including the Lord Mayor, is as follows:

The current Council, elected in 2024, in order of election, is:

===Business vote===
Unlike all other local government area in NSW (which are governed under the &quot;Local Government Act, 1993&quot;), the City of Sydney is governed under the &quot;City of Sydney Act, 1988&quot;. On 25 September 2014, the NSW Liberal/National Coalition Government of Mike Baird, in conjunction with the Shooters and Fishers Party in the Legislative Council, passed the &quot;City of Sydney Amendment (Elections) Act, 2014&quot;, which allowed businesses to have two votes each in City of Sydney elections via a compulsory non-resident register that is maintained at the expense of the City Council.

Implemented for the 2016 election and maintained by Council at an annual cost of $1.7 million, the additional business roll was widely criticised as being an infringement on the democratic process and an attempt to gerrymander election results by the Liberal/National Coalition. At the time of the bill ABC election analyst, Antony Green, noted: &quot;For eight decades both sides of NSW politics have viewed Sydney&#x27;s Lord Mayoralty as a bauble to be delivered as soon as possible to someone that the new government thinks is right and proper to hold the position [...] Given the history ... it is a little difficult to view the proposed changes as anything other than being a state government trying again to get its way on who should be Lord Mayor of Sydney.&quot;

The Lord Mayor Clover Moore also expressed her opposition, seeing it as another attempt to attack her administration and that the new compulsory business register &quot;placed an unworkable and costly burden on the council [...] One of the great flaws of the legislation was that it gives businesses two votes and residents just one, completely reversing one of the founding principles of Australia’s democracy: one vote, one value. [It] was not about business voting at all – it was about manipulating democracy.&quot; Moore&#x27;s position has been supported by several community groups and also Labor Councillor and President of Local Government NSW, Linda Scott, who expressed her view that the business vote is &quot;complex, costly and has no clear public benefit.&quot; However, one supporter of the business vote was former councillor Angela Vithoulkas: &quot;Businesses and property owners pay over 72% of the rates [in the City of Sydney], they deserve to have a voice and exercise their democratic right.&quot; Following the 2021 council elections, the NSW Electoral Commission issued 18,501 failure to vote notices and fines to non-residential electors in the City of Sydney, representing 39% of all non-residential electors for the area.

On 13 September 2023, Ron Hoenig, the Minister for Local Government in the new Labor state government of Chris Minns, announced that the government had introduced the &quot;City of Sydney Amendment Bill 2023&quot; and planned to be implemented at the next elections scheduled for September 2024, that would reverse the 2014 amendment act and remove the compulsory double business voting roll, and return to the system of optional single business voting. On this announcement Hoenig commented: &quot;The amendments were made by the Liberals in a brazen attempt to oust Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore from office and give the party an electoral advantage in controlling the Sydney Town Hall. As expected, the amendments have clearly missed their target with thousands of non-resident ratepayers being slugged with fines for not voting instead. For nearly a decade, City of Sydney ratepayers have also been forced to foot an annual bill of approximately $1 million to maintain the non-residential electoral roll. Nowhere else in this state do we see one group of voters favoured in this way. It erodes the democratic process and undermines the vital importance of giving residents and ratepayers a balanced voice in local council elections.&quot; The &quot;City of Sydney Amendment Act 2023&quot; passed the Parliament on 21 September, and received royal assent from the Governor on 27 September 2023, returning to the optional single business vote in city elections.

==Policies, services and initiatives==
===Environment===
The City of Sydney has adopted various policies to reduce the council&#x27;s climate impact, including strategies implemented since the 2000s to reduce car pollution by investing in mass and public transit and introducing a fleet of 10 new Nissan Leaf electric cars, the largest order of the vehicle in Australia. The council has also invested in bicycle infrastructure, and cycling trips have increased by 113% across Sydney&#x27;s inner-city since March 2010, with approximately 2,000 bikes passing through top peak-hour intersections on an average weekday.

The City of Sydney became the first council in Australia to achieve formal certification as carbon-neutral in 2008. The city has reduced its 2007 carbon emissions by 6% and since 2006 has reduced carbon emissions from city buildings by up to 20%. In 2008, the council adopted the &quot;Sustainable Sydney 2030&quot; program, which outlined various energy targets, such as a comprehensive plan to reduce energy in homes and offices within Sydney by 30%. In the commercial space, reductions in energy consumption have decreased energy bills by $30 million a year in more than half of office spaces, and solar panels] have been installed on many CBD buildings in an effort to minimise carbon pollution by around 3,000 tonnes a year. Sydney has become a leader in the development of green office buildings and enforcing the requirement of all building proposals to be energy-efficient.

The One Central Park development, completed in 2013, is an example of this implementation and design. Proposals to make all of Sydney&#x27;s future buildings sustainable and environmentally friendly by using recycled water, rooftop gardens, efficient and renewable energy.

<text>Siula Grande is a mountain in the Huayhuash mountain range in the Peruvian Andes. It is high and has a subpeak, Siula Chico, high.

==&quot;Touching the Void&quot; ascent==
In 1985, Siula Grande was climbed by Joe Simpson and Simon Yates. Although they ascended the West face, and thereby became the first to reach the summit by that route, they chose to descend the North Ridge, the route of the first ascent and descent in 1936. This was made almost impossible by severe weather which caused Simpson to fall and severely break his leg. All subsequent west face climbers have avoided the ridge and rappelled down the face.

Simpson and Yates&#x27;s ascent was described in Simpson&#x27;s book &quot;Touching the Void&quot;. The book was made into a film of the same title in 2003 and a play in 2018.

==First ascents list==
This is a partial list of first ascents by new routes made.
* 28 July 1936 &quot;North Ridge&quot; by and from Austria.
* 21 June 1966 fourth ascent, by Obster, Schulz and Manfred Sturm via the North ridge en route to Siula Chico
* 1983 West Face to North ridge, after retreating from the direct West face due to rockfall hazard. 2 bivies. David Fish Fulton and Scott Flavelle
* 1985 &quot;West Face&quot; by Joe Simpson and Simon Yates
* 16 June 1999 &quot;Avoiding the Touch&quot; by Mark Price and Carlos Buhler. Their route followed the Yates/Simpson ascent until approximately the middle of the face, at which point they climbed a narrow, technical gully above the initial ice face and then surmounted a short wall up and left into the ice gully that led directly to the main summit (total of 24 pitches).
* 13 July 2001 &quot;Southern Discomfort&quot;, south face by Michel van der Spek, Jay Burbee, and Jeremy Frimer
* 17 July 2001 &quot;Noches de &quot;Juerga&quot;&quot;, west face
* 3 July 2002 &quot;Northeast Face, Los Rapidos&quot; by Slovenes Marjan Kovač and Pavle Kozjek

==Siula Chico==
Siula Chico is a subpeak about high separated from Siula Grande by an approximately col. Mountaineers considered that the easiest route to its summit was via Siula Grande&#x27;s summit and it was so climbed by Manfred Sturm&#x27;s 1966 expedition. Spanish alpinists Jordi Corominas and Oriol Baro made the first ascent of Chico&#x27;s west face, and second ascent of the peak, in May 2007.

According to some researchers the glaciers between Siula Grande and Yerupaja show a broad increase in the number, size and frequency of crevasses, and bergschrunds. As a result, climbing routes used in the 1970s are today considered impracticable.

<text>In a cellular automaton, a finite pattern is called a spaceship if it reappears after a certain number of generations in the same orientation but in a different position. The smallest such number of generations is called the period of the spaceship.

==Description==
The speed of a spaceship is often expressed in terms of &quot;c&quot;, the metaphorical speed of light (one cell per generation) which in many cellular automata is the fastest that an effect can spread. For example, a glider in Conway&#x27;s Game of Life is said to have a speed of formula_1, as it takes four generations for a given state to be translated by one cell. Similarly, the &quot;lightweight spaceship&quot; is said to have a speed of formula_2, as it takes four generations for a given state to be translated by two cells. More generally, if a spaceship in a 2D automaton with the Moore neighborhood is translated by formula_3 after formula_4 generations, then the speed formula_5 is defined as:

This notation can be readily generalised to cellular automata with dimensionality other than two.

A pullalong is a pattern that is not a spaceship in itself but that can be attached to the back of a spaceship to form a larger spaceship. Similarly, a pushalong is placed at the front. The term tagalong can refer to either of these patterns or a pattern that can be placed at the side of a spaceship to form a larger spaceship.

A pattern that, when a spaceship is input, outputs a copy of the spaceship travelling in a different direction is called a reflector. If the output is instead a different spaceship, the pattern is known as a converter.

Spaceships are important because they can sometimes be modified to produce puffers. Spaceships can also be used to transmit information. For example, in Conway&#x27;s Game of Life, the ability of the glider (Life&#x27;s simplest spaceship) to transmit information is part of a proof that Life is Turing-complete.

In March 2016, the unexpected discovery of a small but high-period spaceship enthused the Game of Life community. It was named &quot;copperhead&quot;. A similar example, called &quot;loafer&quot;, was found a few years earlier.

In March 2018, the first elementary spaceship with displacement (2,1) (knightwise) was discovered and named Sir Robin.

<doc id="796235" wikidata="Q4573011" url="?curid=796235" title="1967–68 United States network television schedule">
<text>The following is the 1967–68 network television schedule for the three major English language commercial broadcast networks in the United States. The schedule covers primetime hours from September 1967 through August 1968. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series cancelled after the 1966–67 season.

New fall series are highlighted in bold.

Each of the 30 highest-rated shows is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.

National Educational Television (NET), the network predecessor to PBS, introduced its first live, in-pattern weekly series in November, 1967, &quot;PBL&quot; (an acronym for &quot;Public Broadcast Laboratory&quot;), which was cleared in a simultaneous 8:30pm ET/5:30pm PT Sunday time-slot on the majority of NET stations. In the first season the series offered usually two-hour episodes, in the second season (1968–69) episodes usually ran for 90 minutes, after a 150-minute premiere on November 5, 1967. The series was a mix of filmed segments and live interviews, discussion panels and other performance.

: Yellow indicates the programs in the top 10 for the season.
: Cyan indicates the programs in the top 20 for the season.
: Magenta indicates the programs in the top 30 for the season.

== Sunday ==

NOTE: On NBC, &quot;Animal Kingdom&quot; — renamed &quot;Animal World&quot; beginning with its August 11, 1968, broadcast — aired from 6:30 to 7:00 p.m. from June 16, 1968, to September 1968.

== Monday ==

NOTE: On CBS, &quot;Premiere&quot; was an anthology series composed of unsold television pilots.

== Tuesday ==
== Wednesday ==
Note: CBS decided in September to replace &quot;Dundee and the Culhane&quot; in December with &quot;The Jonathan Winters Show&quot;. &quot;The Avengers&quot; replaced &quot;Custer&quot; in January 1968.

== Thursday ==
Note: &quot;Good Company&quot;, an interview show hosted by F. Lee Bailey, did so poorly in the Nielsen ratings that ABC decided not to bother replacing it, temporarily returning its time period to their affiliates.

== Friday ==
== Saturday ==

<doc id="796237" wikidata="Q1778561" url="?curid=796237" title="Mamiya">
<text>is a Japanese company that manufactures high-end cameras and other related photographic and optical equipment. With headquarters in Tokyo, it has two manufacturing plants and a workforce of over 200 people. The company was founded in May 1940 by camera designer Seiichi Mamiya () and financial backer Tsunejiro Sugawara.

==History==

Mamiya originally achieved fame for its professional medium-format rangefinder film cameras such as the Mamiya Six (1940) and the Mamiya Press (1962) series. It later developed medium-format industry workhorse single lens reflex cameras: RB67 (1970), RZ67 (1982), and 645 (1975); and twin-lens reflex C series, all of which were used by advanced amateur and professional photographers.

Many Mamiya models over the past six decades have become collectors&#x27; items. The earliest Mamiya Six medium-format folding camera, the 35 mm Mamiya-Sekor 1000DTL, the lightweight 35 mm Mamiya NC1000, the 6×6 cm medium-format C series of interchangeable-lens twin-lens reflex (TLR) cameras, and the press cameras of the Super/Universal series are highly valued. Mamiya also manufactured the last models in the Omega Rapid series of medium format press cameras.

Mamiya has entered other business markets over time by purchasing other companies. Until 2000, it made fishing equipment such as fishing rods and fishing reels. In 2006, the Mamiya Op Co., Ltd., Inc. transferred the camera and optical business to Mamiya Digital Imaging Co., Ltd. The original company, doing business as Mamiya-OP, continues to exist and makes a variety of industrial and electronics products. It also makes golf clubs, golf club shafts and grips, and golf balls through its subsidiaries Kasco and USTMamiya.

===Phase One acquisition===
In 2009, Phase One, a medium format digital camera back manufacturer from Denmark, purchased a major stake in Mamiya. In 2012, Phase One combined Mamiya and another subsidiary, Leaf Imaging, created a new, worldwide Mamiya Leaf brand to integrate both companies’ product lines into one complete medium-format digital camera system offering. The re-branding offers a streamlined product development and establishment of a more efficient customer sales and support base.

In 2015 Phase One purchased Mamiya and began using Mamiya&#x27;s Saku factory as the new Japan headquarters.

===135 film===
Mamiya started manufacturing 135 film cameras in 1949, with point-and-shoot compact cameras being introduced later. The excellent Mamiya-35 series of rangefinder cameras was followed by the Mamiya Prismat SLR in 1961 and the Mamiya TL/DTL in the mid-to-late 1960s. The SX, XTL and NC1000 were other 135 film SLR camera models introduced by Mamiya. One of Mamiya&#x27;s last 135 film SLR designs was the Z-series. The original entry-level ZE model was an aperture-priority-only SLR; the ZE-2 added manual exposure; the ZE-X added shutter priority and full program automated mode, and (with a dedicated flash and an EF-series lens) focus-priority flash exposure). In these models the aperture ring had no direct connection to the diaphragm, allowing the camera body to override the set aperture, and the lenses could communicate a considerable amount of information to the camera body via electrical contacts on the mount.

The Mamiya ZM, introduced in 1982, was essentially an advanced version of the ZE-2, with some of the features of the ZE-X. It was the last Mamiya 135 film camera produced. It had an aperture-priority automatic time control, based on center-weighted TTL readings, an automatic shutter-speed range from 4 seconds to 1/1000, and a manual range from 2 seconds to 1/1000. Visual and audio signals indicated over- or under-exposure, pending battery failure, or excessive camera shake. Metering modes, shutter release, self-timer, manual time settings and the ergonomics of the camera body were also improved.

In 1984 Osawa, one of Mamiya&#x27;s major distributors, filed for the Japanese equivalent of bankruptcy and, soon after, Mamiya discontinued 135-film camera production to focus on the medium-format professional market.

===Medium format===
Common medium format frame sizes on 120 film include 645, 6×6, and 6×7, named for the nominal frame dimensions, in centimeters. These were derived from fractional imperial units, so the actual frame size is slightly different from the nominal dimensions:
* 645 = 
* 6×6 = 
* 6×7 = 

Mamiya made a series of square format (6×6) twin lens reflex (TLR) cameras throughout the middle of the twentieth century. These were developed into the C cameras (C2, C3 through to C330s) which have interchangeable lenses as well as bellows focus.

In 1970, Mamiya introduced the RB67, a 6×7 cm (nominal) professional single lens reflex (SLR). The RB67, a large, heavy, medium-format camera with built-in closeup bellows was innovative and successful. Previous medium-format professional SLR cameras used the square 6×6 cm format which did not require the camera to be rotated for photographs in portrait orientation, problematical with large and heavy cameras when tripod-mounted. Like the Linhof Technika the RB67 had a rotating back which enabled photographs to be taken in either landscape or portrait orientation without rotating the camera, at the expense of additional weight and bulk. The RB67 soon became widely used by professional studio photographers. The 6×7 frame had been introduced and patented by Linhof (56 × 72mm) and was described as being ideal, as the negatives required very little cropping to fit on standard 10&quot; × 8&quot; paper. Mamiya actually used a frame size of 56 × 67mm.

When comparing the RB67 to full frame 135 cameras there is a so-called &quot;crop factor&quot; of ×. That means the standard 35mm frame (36×24 mm) dimension, across the diagonal, is approximately half the corresponding diagonal dimension on the 67 (56×67 mm; note the aspect ratio is different. The total area of the 35mm frame is of the 6×7 frame. This affects the focal length of lenses so that to get an equivalent field of view on a 35mm camera you need half the focal length of a 6×7 lens. There is a similar effect on the depth of field of a particular aperture, so a 90mm lens on the RB67 is equivalent to using a 45mm on 35mm full frame.

In 1975 Mamiya started to offer the M645, the first SLR medium format camera to use the 645 format exclusively. The 645 format was introduced originally in the 1930s. The Mamiya 645 cameras could take 15 shots on a standard 120 roll film.
The RB67 was followed by the more advanced RZ67 6x7cm frame format camera in 1982. These cameras established Mamiya as a major medium-format professional camera manufacturer, together with Hasselblad, Rollei, Bronica and Pentax.

In 1989, Mamiya introduced the Mamiya 6 (6x6cm) rangefinder camera. In 1995, this was followed by the Mamiya 7 (6x7cm). The Mamiya 6 was discontinued around 1999; the Mamiya 7 was produced for 18 years, with production ending around 2013. The Mamiya 6 is more portable due to a collapsible lens mount, while the Mamiya 7 offers a wider variety of lens options. Both the Mamiya 6 and 7 are compact and quiet cameras which are reputed for the extremely high optical quality of their lenses.

In 1999, Mamiya presented the Mamiya 645AF, a 6X4.5 frame SLR camera with interchangeable lenses and film backs, auto focus and an integrated prism visor that would be the base platform for the Mamiya 645AFD film and digital back cameras.

===Digital products===
Mamiya introduced the Mamiya ZD, which was a compact medium-format camera, in 2004. Rather than taking the form of a digital back solution, it was all built into one unit, much like a 35mm camera. This camera utilized the Mamiya 645AF lenses and had a resolution of 22mp. The solution had technical difficulties and became delayed. At the same time, Mamiya also announced a ZD back which had the same specification but was intended to be used with the Mamiya 645AFDII / AFDIII. The ZD back was even more delayed and, once it was introduced, it was already outdated.

In 2009, the Mamiya M Series digital backs were released (M18, M22 and M31) all featuring high pixel counts with large CCDs and compatibility with the Mamiya 645AFD range and RZ/ RB series (via specially manufactured adapters). All the backs are compatible with 4x5 inch view cameras.
In the final quarter of 2009, Mamiya released its Mamiya 645DF camera, the latest and digital-only version of the famed 6x4.5 format AF camera series. The Mamiya 645DF has many improved features including mirror-up delay, lack of shutter lag, AF preference with priority on speed or precision, and compatibility with the new leaf shutter lens range (Mamiya Sekor AF 80mm, 55mm and 110mm D lenses with in-built leaf shutters). With these lenses attached, flash synchronizations speeds of up to 1/1,600 of a second are achievable, although the camera can also be programmed to use the focal plane shutter even if a leaf shutter lens is attached. 2010 saw the release of 3 Mamiya DM Systems (Mamiya DM33 System, consisting of a 645DF camera body and 33MP digital back, the Mamiya DM28 System, consisting of a 645 AF III camera body and 28MP digital back, and the Mamiya DM22 System, consisting of a 645 AF III camera body and 22MP digital back. A new logo and webpage were also launched.

==Mamiya America Corporation==

In the United States, the trademark for &quot;Mamiya&quot; was not owned by the original company in Japan but rather by a wholly separate entity called Mamiya America Corporation (&quot;M.A.C.&quot;). As such, all products that bear the name &quot;Mamiya&quot; were controlled by M.A.C. and resulted in considerably higher retail prices compared to outside the United States. 

As of 2014 MAC group no longer manages the Mamiya brand in America, all sales, service and support was transferred to Phase One who already owned a large portion of Mamiya.
