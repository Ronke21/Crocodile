<text>All the Way... A Decade of Song is the first English-language greatest hits album by Canadian singer Celine Dion. Released by Sony Music on 12 November 1999, it features nine previously released songs on most editions and seven new recordings on all editions. Dion worked on new tracks mainly with David Foster. Other producers include Max Martin, Kristian Lundin, Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange, James Horner, and Matt Serletic. It is the best-selling greatest hits album in the US during the Nielsen SoundScan era. &quot;All the Way... A Decade of Song&quot; has sold over 22 million copies worldwide, including over nine million in the United States, five million in Europe, two million in Japan and one million units in Canada.

&quot;All the Way... A Decade of Song&quot; garnered mostly positive reviews from music critics. Out of all of the new recordings, they especially praised the first uptempo single &quot;That&#x27;s the Way It Is&quot; and a ballad &quot;If Walls Could Talk&quot;. The album became a commercial success throughout the world and peaked at number one in every major music market around the globe. It placed at No. 7 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Year-End Chart in the year 2000 and placed at No. 26 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Decade-End chart.

==Background==
After ten years of standing in the spotlight, Celine Dion decided to go on vacation. &quot;I&#x27;m looking forward to having no schedule, no pressure, to not caring about whether it&#x27;s raining or not, just visiting with family and friends, cooking at home, trying to seriously have a child. I want no pressure for a while,&quot; she said. Before Dion embarked on her two-year respite from the music industry beginning 1 January 2000, she prepared &quot;All the Way... A Decade of Song&quot; to cap a ten-year period in which she had sold over 100 million records worldwide. In the 1990s, Dion transformed herself from a regional Canadian success into one of the world&#x27;s most successful pop artists. In that time, she released six English-language albums, from 1990&#x27;s &quot;Unison&quot; to &quot;All the Way... A Decade of Song&quot;, and six newly recorded French albums, picking up numerous awards, including five Grammys.

The process of putting together &quot;All the Way... A Decade of Song&quot; was laborious for all involved, from balancing the number of hits and new songs to ensuring that each of the latest tracks showed a new side of Dion. &quot;We had hourly conversations, back and forth, about what the combination should be,&quot; said John Doelp, the album&#x27;s co-executive producer. He added, &quot;We wanted to make sure we had some new sounds and that we were able to go to new places&quot;. Co-executive producer Vito Luprano added: &quot;The first idea was to record three new songs, then Dion said, &#x27;Let&#x27;s go for five,&#x27; her lucky number. But we had so many great songs coming in that we ended up recording nine. Out of that, we decided to go with seven&quot;.

===Album===
&quot;All the Way... A Decade of Song&quot; contains nine greatest hits (ten on the Japanese version) with seven new songs in one single-disc package. Collaborators include Max Martin; Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange; James Horner and Will Jennings, who wrote &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;; French songwriter/producer Luc Plamondon; Diane Warren; and David Foster. The Jennings/Horner track &quot;Then You Look at Me&quot; was also placed in December 1999 on the film soundtrack &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot;, starring Robin Williams; and Plamondon&#x27;s &quot;Live (for the One I Love)&quot;, which has been translated from its original French version &quot;Vivre&quot;, appeared in February 2000 on the French stage-show album &quot;Notre-Dame de Paris&quot;.

The first single, &quot;That&#x27;s the Way It Is&quot; is an optimistic uptempo song, co-written and co-produced by Max Martin, best known for his work with young pop artists. Other highlights on &quot;All the Way... A Decade of Song&quot; include a remake of Roberta Flack&#x27;s &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot;, which Dion performed acoustically in her Let&#x27;s Talk About Love World Tour; the Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange ballad &quot;If Walls Could Talk&quot;, with Shania Twain on background vocals; the power ballad &quot;I Want You to Need Me&quot; from Diane Warren; another, orchestrated power ballad &quot;Then You Look at Me;&quot; and a song Dion and René Angélil were married to, &quot;All the Way&quot;, here in a virtual duet with Frank Sinatra.

Sony Music Entertainment released eight different versions of her greatest hits, tailored to Dion&#x27;s individual successes in North America, Europe, France, Australia/New Zealand, Asia, Japan, Latin America and Brazil.

A Decade of Song&quot; singles: &quot;That&#x27;s the Way It Is&quot;, &quot;Live (for the One I Love)&quot; and &quot;I Want You to Need Me&quot; .The DVD also includes previous hits, some of them in live versions from the &quot;Live in Memphis&quot; concert.

==Promotion==
On 7 October 1999, Celine Dion taped her second CBS television special at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City. She performed: &quot;Love Can Move Mountains&quot;, &quot;To Love You More&quot; (with Taro Hakase on violin), &quot;That&#x27;s the Way It Is&quot; (with &#x27;N Sync), &quot;All the Way&quot; (virtual duet with Frank Sinatra), &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; and a medley of &quot;Here We Are/Because You Loved Me/Conga&quot; in duet with Gloria Estefan. The television special aired on 22 November 1999 and was the second-most-watched program in its time slot, with an 8.3 rating and a 14 share. Dion also performed &quot;That&#x27;s the Way It Is&quot; in various television and award shows in late 1999, before taking a two-year break from the music industry. On 31 December 1999, she performed her last concert at Montréal&#x27;s Molson Centre, with guest Bryan Adams and a host of French-Canadian singers.

==Singles==
&quot;That&#x27;s the Way It Is&quot; was released as the first single from the album in November 1999. It reached number six on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and became a top-ten hit around the world. In February 2000, &quot;Live (for the One I Love)&quot; was released as the second single in selected European countries and in March 2000, &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; was issued as the next single in the United Kingdom, peaking at number nineteen. The second North American single, &quot;I Want You to Need Me&quot;, was released in April 2000 and reached number-one on the Canadian Singles Chart.

==Critical reception==

&quot;All the Way... A Decade of Song&quot; garnered generally positive reviews from music critics. Michael Paoletta from &quot;Billboard&quot; gave it a very positive review, calling the album a reminder of why the decade has been Dion&#x27;s signature era – and why the future looks bright for her. According to him, regarding seven new songs, &quot;All the Way... A Decade of Song&quot; is Dion&#x27;s most focused album yet, drawing on a team of collaborators that understands this artists&#x27;s strengths. Among the highlights Paoletta mentioned: the first single &quot;That&#x27;s the Way It Is&quot;, a welcome up-tempo number; &quot;I Want You to Need Me&quot;, a consummate love song ripe for a second single; &quot;If Walls Could Talk;&quot; &quot;Then You Look at Me&quot;, a characteristically &quot;roof-raising, fan-stoking&quot; Dion anthem; her &quot;beyond-the-pale&quot; duet with Frank Sinatra on &quot;All the Way&quot;; and &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot;, a remake that &quot;affirms Dion&#x27;s ability to lay low and still scintillate&quot;.

Chuck Taylor from &quot;Billboard&quot; also praised &quot;That&#x27;s the Way It Is&quot;. He wrote that Dion at last &quot;ups the tempo with the irresistible&quot; first single. According to Taylor, this new track, a joyful ode to holding the faith but allowing love to take its course when it&#x27;s ready, matches Dion with a new team of collaborators, consistent hitmakers: Max Martin, Kristian Lundin and Andreas Carlsson. &quot;Replete with a festive mandolin and a midtempo beat to bring new heights to her as-ever splendid vocal,&quot; this song is &quot;destined to enrapture&quot; top forty and AC the first time through, at last stripping away mainstream radio&#x27;s gripe that Dion is &quot;too adult&quot;. He said that, youthful and yet elegant, and glowing brightly with warmth, the song also represents a bold step forward for Martin, who is best known for his work with chart-topping youth acts. All in all, &quot;That&#x27;s the Way It Is&quot; is &quot;one of the most compelling radio releases yet&quot; from &quot;one of the core voices of the decade&quot;.

Chuck Taylor also reviewed &quot;I Want You to Need Me&quot; and wrote that linking Dion and Diane Warren has always been about &quot;as fine a fit as a trusty pair of Thom McAn&#x27;s&quot;. Between Warren&#x27;s &quot;heart-drenched&quot; words and dramatic melody writing and Dion&#x27;s &quot;potent vocals straight from soulside, divadom has never sounded so mighty&quot;. According to him, for fans of Dion&#x27;s &quot;high-caliber&quot; power ballads, this is truly among the best ever and a highlight on &quot;All the Way... A Decade of Song&quot;. Longing for romantic attention, Dion sings, &quot;I want you to need me, like the air you breathe/I want you to feel me, in everything/I want you to see me, in your every dream/The way that I taste you, feel you, breathe you, need you&quot;. Taylor stated that Warren&#x27;s trusty melody is wholly natural and free-flowing, while production from the usually rock-oriented Matt Serletic is &quot;sheer perfection&quot;. It all peaks from the glorious midsection through to the end, where Dion delivers exactly what we&#x27;ve come to expect: a crescendo as &quot;spine-tingling&quot; as those first few times we heard &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;.

Although Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album four out of five stars, he criticized it for including seven new songs and just nine hits. According to him, if it had been a straight hits collection, with &quot;That&#x27;s the Way It Is&quot; and &quot;If Walls Could Talk&quot; added to the end, it would have been fine, but padding it with nearly a full album worth of new material hurts it. He also noticed that Dion&#x27;s first American hit, &quot;Where Does My Heart Beat Now&quot;, isn&#x27;t here, nor is her duet with Barbra Streisand, &quot;Tell Him&quot;. Erlewine stated that the best of the hits, like the Meat Loaf-ian epic &quot;It&#x27;s All Coming Back to Me Now&quot; and &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;, are certainly among the best adult contemporary songs of the decade. In comparison to the new material, he felt that the danceable &quot;That&#x27;s the Way It Is&quot; and the &quot;pretty&quot; ballad &quot;If Walls Could Talk&quot; work, but he did not like &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; and &quot;All the Way&quot;. According to him, the remaining three new songs &quot;aren&#x27;t bad&quot;, but they&#x27;re not particularly memorable, especially compared to the hits.

<text>An ignition interlock device or breath alcohol ignition interlock device (IID or BAIID) is a breathalyzer for an individual&#x27;s vehicle. It requires the driver to blow into a mouthpiece on the device before starting or continuing to operate the vehicle. If the resultant breath-alcohol concentration analyzed result is greater than the programmed blood alcohol concentration (which varies between countries), the device prevents the engine from being started. The interlock device is located inside the vehicle, near the driver’s seat, and is directly connected to the engine’s ignition system. It is a form of electronic monitoring.

An ignition interlock interrupts the signal from the ignition to the starter until a valid breath sample is provided that meets maximal alcohol guidelines in that jurisdiction. At that point, the vehicle can be started as normal. A breath sample is not required to start the vehicle if the engine has been running within a time-out period, to allow quick re-starts in case the vehicle stalls. At random times after the engine has been started, the IID will require another breath sample, referred to as a rolling retest. The purpose of the rolling retest is to prevent someone other than the driver from providing a breath sample. If the breath sample isn&#x27;t provided, or the sample exceeds the ignition interlock&#x27;s preset blood alcohol level, the device will log the event, warn the driver, and then start up an alarm in accordance to state regulations (e.g., lights flashing, horn honking) until the ignition is turned off, or a clean breath sample has been provided. A common misconception is that interlock devices will simply turn off the engine if alcohol is detected; this would, however, create an unsafe driving situation and expose interlock manufacturers to considerable liability, which is why ignition interlock devices do not have an automatic engine shut off feature.

==History==

The first performance based interlocks were developed by Borg-Warner Corp. (now BorgWarner, Inc.), in 1969. In 1981, Jeffrey Feit, a student in New Jersey, placed in a statewide innovation contest with a primitive schematic of a breathalyzer based interlock device. In 1983, Hans Doran, a student in Limerick, presented a working prototype at the Young Scientist competition in Dublin. Alcohol-sensing devices became the standard through the 1980s. They employed semiconductor (nonspecific) alcohol sensors. Semiconductor-type (Taguchi) interlocks were sturdy and got the field moving, but did not hold calibration very well, were sensitive to altitude variation, and reacted positively to non-alcohol sources. Commercialization and more widespread adoption of the device was delayed pending improvement of systems for preventing circumvention.

By the early 1990s, the industry began to produce &quot;second generation&quot; interlocks with reliable and accurate fuel cell sensors. In the US ignition interlocks are required to meet National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) standards.

==Design==
Modern ignition interlock devices use an alcohol-specific fuel cell for a sensor. A fuel cell sensor is an electrochemical device in which alcohol undergoes a chemical oxidation reaction at a catalytic electrode surface (platinum) to generate an electric current. This current is then measured and converted to an alcohol equivalent reading. Although fuel cell technology is not as accurate or reliable as infrared spectroscopy technology used in evidentiary breathalyzers, they are cheaper and tend to be more specific for alcohol. Alcohol, as defined here, includes isopropanol, sorbitol, menthol, methanol, and a host of other types of alcohols, in addition to ethanol, the consumed liquor.

The devices keep a record of the activity on the device and the interlocked vehicle&#x27;s electrical system. This record, or log, is printed out or downloaded each time the device&#x27;s sensors are calibrated, commonly at 30-, 60-, or 90-day intervals. Authorities may require periodic review of the log. If violations are detected, then additional sanctions can be implemented.

Periodic calibration is performed using either a pressurized alcohol–gas mixture at a known alcohol concentration, or with an alcohol wet bath arrangement that contains a known alcohol solution.

Some IIDs are equipped with cameras, which may be required by the jurisdiction or voluntarily used. The purpose of the camera is to identify &quot;fail&quot; results with the driver, which conveniently makes it easier to &quot;clear&quot; test failure reports when the &quot;fail&quot; result was triggered by a third party.

==Costs==
The costs of installation, maintenance, and calibration are generally paid by the offender. Costs vary considerably around the world:
As of 2015 in the US, on average, ignition interlock devices cost about $70–150 to install and about $60–90 per month for monitoring and calibration.

==Adoption==
Many countries are requiring the ignition interlock as a condition for drivers convicted of drunk driving, especially repeat offenders. Most US states now permit judges to order the installation of an IID as a condition of probation; for repeat offenders, and for first offenders in some states, installation may be mandated by law.

Some commercial and public organizations have also voluntarily adopted ignition interlock devices for their vehicle fleet, to reduce the risk of monetary and reputational damages from accidents caused by a drunk driving employee.

=== Asia===
====Australia ====
Interlock devices are used in the states of Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania, New South Wales, and Queensland. The Northern Territory and the ACT are also looking into their use.
====New Zealand====
Alcohol interlock devices became a sentencing option in New Zealand in August 2012. In December 2012, it was reported that the first device had been installed.

=== Europe===
====Austria ====
For a pilot project trialling interlocks from 2012-2013 driving licence administration authorities and a coordinating institution “ABS Institution” were created. Offenders could volunteer only if they met criteria such as &quot;no alcohol addiction&quot;, a suspension of the drivers licence for at least four months where at least half of the suspension period had passed etc. The driver had to meet a mentor every two months with examination of data readout for violations and Discussion of the participant‘s experience with the device and
of the driving behaviour in reference to the data readout and driver‘s logbook and development of strategies for a successful continuation
of the programme, but no mandatory medical or psychological examination. Costs were 2,500 euros/year for the device, 300 euros to install and remove it and 600 euros minimum for the mentoring programme.
Interlock systems were introduced in 2017 and consolidated into federal law (Driving License Act - Alternative Probation System Ordinance. As of 2020 there was no official evaluation and no published participation rate.

====Belgium====
Laws permitting judges to impose the use of interlock devices on convicted drunk drivers permitted their use from 2010, however by 2016 it had only been used in 55 cases. The cost, €3,500 to be paid by the driver, is a deterrent to its use. From 2017 the device may be paid from the fines imposed on the driver and in addition it may become compulsory for repeat offenders.

====Denmark====
The Danish Road Safety Traffic Authority trialed the lock in 2015 in a voluntary program, which could replace a licence suspension of maximum two years. As there was a very poor uptake of only 24 drivers, they changed it in 2017 to a three-year programme which resulted in an improved participation rate of 450 drivers as of 2020.

====Finland====
In Finland, the Finnish Transport and Communications Agency (Traficom) first trialled interlocks in 2005. It was put into legal effect in 2008 with a requirement to meet a health care professional for rehabilitation. Installation cost around €2400 for one year, €1920 per year for two years, or €1440 per year for three years. Only 5.7% of the drivers re-offended instead of 30% without the program. As of 2020, there were about 1,000 drivers participating in the Ignition Interlock Device program.

====France====
In France, the interlock programme has included a mandatory addiction consultation (without any ongoing monitoring during the program and no data analysis). In 2018, an alcohol interlock in repeat offences became compulsory and a trial was extended to the entire country. 1,500 ignition interlock devices were installed from 2018-2020 of a total of 8,104 prefectoral decrees restricting driving. Purchase costs were 1,300 euros or rental at 100 euros/month plus installation fees. The French Prefectures publish a Map of approved alcohol interlocks installers by department and region.

====Italy====
In 2024, Italy implemented mandatory ignition interlock devices (alcolock) as part of its revised Codice della Strada. This regulation requires individuals with prior convictions for driving under the influence to install the device in their vehicles. The measure aligns with EU safety goals and ensures that repeat offenders cannot operate their vehicles while impaired. The costs of installation and maintenance are borne by the offenders themselves, emphasizing accountability. Additionally, there is growing attention to extending the requirement to new vehicles to enhance road safety, aligning with broader European directives, though specific mandates for all new cars are still under discussion.

====Lithuania====
As of 2020, since 2016, more than 80 new school buses equipped with interlock devices had been handed over to municipalities, and 400 drivers had participated in an interlock programme.The Ministry of Health intended to create a new rehabilitation programme for drunk drivers.

====Netherlands====
From December 2011 the Netherlands started to use an interlock device for offenders who were caught with a blood alcohol level over a certain limit. The process which had over 5,000 participants was cancelled in 2015 due to legal and technical problems.

====Poland====
In Poland, since 2015 offenders driving with a BAC above 0.5 g/l may ask the court for their driving ban to be replaced with an alcohol interlock after at least half of the driving ban period has passed. Offenders with a lifetime driving ban can apply for an alcohol interlock after a minimum of 10 years. Interlocks are not part of a rehabilitation programme. The actual number of installed alcohol
interlocks is unknown; the number of court orders were 609 in 2017, 2,180 in 2018, and 840 in the 1st half of 2019.

====Sweden====
The Swedish Transport Agency trialed it in 1999 and offered a programme of alcohol interlock device with medical certificates for drivers convicted with a BAC level between 0.2 and 0.9 g/l and a 2 year programme for convicted repeat offenders (within a five-year period), and offenders with a BAC level of at least 1.0 g/. As of 2020, about 3,000 people were driving with an alcohol interlock.
Alcohol interlock devices are used in buses at least in Stockholm.

===Americas===
====Canada====
Some provinces, such as Ontario, Quebec, and Manitoba require any person convicted of drunk driving or refusing to provide a breath sample, to install an ignition interlock device into any vehicle he or she owns or operates, for a specified period of time (or for life), depending on the number of prior drunk driving offenses.

After so many drunk driving convictions, some provinces, such as Nova Scotia, will impose a lifetime driving ban, with no possibility of license reinstatement. Ontario courts, however, have the power to enact lifetime driving bans, with no possibility of reinstatement, after so many Criminal Code driving convictions. Under such circumstances, ignition interlock conditions are not put in place on the person&#x27;s license.
====United States====
As of 2012, all 50 states have laws permitting the imposition of ignition-interlock devices as sentencing alternatives for drunk drivers. It is estimated that the United States could be saving 800 lives per year if all convicted drunk drivers were prevented from being involved in a fatal crash. The standard device in the US consists of a mouthpiece mounted on a handheld unit and a cord that attaches to the vehicle’s ignition system and runs on the battery. The driver is required to blow into the mouthpiece to test his or her alcohol level before starting the car. Devices are required to be installed at a certified service center. Devices are shipped directly to the qualifying service center and are never handled by the customer. The largest ignition interlock device providers are made by Draeger, Smart Start, Guardian, Intoxalock, based in Des Moines, Iowa and LifeSafer.

Most states impose the installation of ignition interlock devices (IID), with varying thresholds for installation requirements. Criminal process thresholds for installation requirements vary between minimum BAC levels (e.g., 0.20%, or 0.15%) or repeat offense, with about half of the states requiring installation on first offense.

These ignition interlock sanctions are meant as punishment, but also as a deterrence. When required under a high BAC level or multiple offense threshold, ignition interlock requirements address a strong tendency of repeat offense by drivers with alcoholic use disorder (AUD or alcoholism).

Ignition interlock requirements are also imposed in some instances after positive chemical blood alcohol tests, as a physical deterrent for drivers with alcoholic use disorder, or as a pseudo-civil punishment. Ignition interlock requirements are also imposed in some instances after an implied consent refusal under similar forensic procedures.

In most US implementations, IIDs are set to a &quot;zero tolerance&quot; level (set to either levels consistent with culinary alcohol or measurement errors).

In operation, the driver blows into IIDs to enable the car&#x27;s starter. After a variable time period of approximately 20–40 minutes, the driver is required to re-certify (blow again) within a time period consistent with safely pulling off the roadway. If the driver fails to re-certify within the time period, the car will alarm in a manner similar to setting off the car&#x27;s immobilizer, but mechanically independent of it. The installation company may provide regular reports to the Department of Motor Vehicles of a driver&#x27;s home state regarding its usage.

Various US states have different penalties for disabling IIDs. In some cases, the driver may be penalized if a family member or mechanic disables the IID when not in use by the sanctioned individual, or temporarily for servicing the vehicle. In some implementations, disabling by mechanics and others is either permitted or authorisation easily obtained, but some jurisdictions restrict or deny authorisation. (Such restrictions on mechanics can be problematic, for example, if limited to designated &quot;licensed mechanics&quot; or as applied to routine repair procedures requiring operation of the ignition and starter systems.) Some jurisdictions criminalize such temporary bypass of IIDs.

Violations can occur from a driver not having reached the &quot;zero tolerance&quot; level, but can also occur from use by other drivers within legal limits, or from test anomalies. In some states, anomalies are routinely discounted, for example as not consistent with patterns of BAC levels or at levels incompatible with life (e.g., significant mouth alcohol - if read as BAC would mean the patient is dead). In some states, &quot;fail&quot; readings inconsistent with actual alcohol use can be cleared by a routine process, but other states automatically deem these &quot;fail&quot; readings as violations.

;Alaska

&quot;DUI Offenders may be required to obtain an Ignition Interlock Device (IID).&quot;

;Arizona
Arizona offers what is called a Special Ignition Interlock Restricted Driver&#x27;s License In Lieu of mandatory license suspension. It is a type of restricted driver&#x27;s license that is used to facilitate the Ignition Interlock Requirement in a Vehicle. The time that the SIIRDL is required varies by offense, with an average length of 12 months. All IIDs must be installed by an approved company, and must be equipped with a camera, GPS and real-time reporting capabilities.

;California
As of July 1, 2010, California implemented a pilot project for DUI sentencing, as a pilot program involving four counties under AB 91: Alameda, Los Angeles, Sacramento, and Tulare. Under the pilot project, if driving on a suspended license due to a DUI conviction, legally the court must impose an ignition interlock device requirement for up to a maximum of three years from the date of conviction. As of July 1, 2010, interlocks are required upon a DUI conviction in the four counties.

In the four counties under the AB 91 pilot program, all drivers convicted of a DUI offense are required to install IIDs in their vehicles as a condition to receive restricted driving privileges. First offenders convicted of drunk driving are required to install an ignition interlock device in their car for a period of five months and second offenders for a period of one year. Previously, this requirement was only required for third offenders and permitted for second offenders, and then for a three-year period. The California DMV has written guidelines to clear up some ambiguities in the law. Costs associated with ignition interlock devices include $70 – $150 for installation and fees in the range of $60 - $80 per month thereafter.

SB 598 shortens the amount of time certain repeat DUI offenders will have to wait before becoming eligible to apply for restricted California driving privileges. To receive the restricted license, though, these drivers will be required to meet certain criteria, such as the installation of an IID in their vehicles.

;Georgia
First-time DUI convictions result in one year of a mandatory ignition interlock device.[42] A second conviction requires the IID be installed for at least five years, and on a third offense or greater, the requirement becomes at least ten years. Some convictions of negligent driving or reckless driving can require the convicted person to use an IID for a period of six months or longer.

;Massachusetts

Starting January 1, 2006, drivers that had a second or subsequent operating under the influence offense and are eligible for a hardship license or for license reinstatement, are required to have an ignition interlock device attached to their motor vehicle, at their own expense.

;New Jersey
Senate bill S824 decreases the length of driver’s license suspensions for drunk driving and refusing to submit to a breathalyzer test, but increases ignition interlock device requirements for these offenses. All first-time DWI offenders in the state of New Jersey are required to install an ignition interlock device on their vehicle. Also, if your license has been revoked for failure to submit to an alcohol test, you can regain your driving privileges if you install an ignition interlock.

;New Mexico

Ignition interlocks are required for at least one year for all first-time DWI offenders; subsequent offenses require longer periods of installation. Also, if your license has been revoked for failure to submit to an alcohol test, you can regain your driving privileges if you install an ignition interlock.

;New York

Don Prudente from DriveSafe Ignition Interlock of New York, Inc. states that as of August 15, 2010, New York state requires a person sentenced for Driving While Intoxicated have an ignition interlock device installed for at least 6 months on any vehicle they own or operate, and the driver have an &quot;ignition interlock&quot; restriction added to their driver license. This was mandated in honor of Leandra Rosado who died riding in a vehicle driven by a drunk driver.

;North Carolina

A conviction of Driving While Impaired with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.15 or more or another conviction within the past seven years will require an ignition interlock device to be installed on the vehicle.

;Rhode Island
As of 2015, Rhode Island courts have had the power to grant a hardship license to DUI offenders following the installation of an ignition interlock device. First-time DUI offenders can be required to use the IID for three months to one year. A second conviction can require IID usage for six months to two years. A third conviction can require IID usage for one to four years, while a third conviction within five years can require IID usage for two to 10 years.

;Texas

As of Sept 1, 2015, anyone arrested for driving over the legal limit of .08% can opt for an IID restriction rather than wait for their driver&#x27;s license suspension period to be up. For BAC levels .15% and over, Texas courts require IIDs, even for first time offenders.

;Utah

Effective July 2, 2009, anyone convicted of a DUI, whether it be a first offense or a subsequent offense, will be required to have an ignition interlock device placed on their car — for 18 months for first time offense.

;Virginia

Effective July 1, 2012, anyone who is convicted of DUI may drive only with an ignition interlock after the first offense, as a condition of a restricted license and is required to have an ignition interlock installed in each vehicle owned by or registered to him after a second offense for a period of six months. The bill also provides that the court may authorize a restricted license for travel to and from the interlock installer and a person can pre-qualify for an ignition interlock prior to conviction.

;Washington

First-time DUI convictions result in one year of a mandatory ignition interlock device. A second conviction requires the IID be installed for at least five years, and on a third offense or greater, the requirement becomes at least ten years. Some convictions of negligent driving or reckless driving can require the convicted person to use an IID for a period of six months or longer.

==Countries who trialed, but have not adopted==
In 2018, 53 systems were trialed on a fleet of buses in Italy. No rehabilitation programmes for offenders are in place nor any legislation on Alcohol Interlock programmes have been adopted.

The UK trialed the device in 2006 and decided not to proceed with wider use.
==Universal IID installation==
Proposals have been made to install IIDs on all new vehicles, set to the legal limit for the driver. Some politicians in Sweden, Japan, Canada, the US, and other countries have called for such devices to be installed as standard equipment in all motor vehicles sold.
Issues to be solved, besides consumer and voter acceptance, include difficulty in obtaining accurate measurements without inconvenience, and a need to achieve high reliability, in order not to interfere with vehicle usability.

<doc id="827482" wikidata="Q1643870" url="?curid=827482" title="Weekly Torah portion">
<text>It is a custom among religious Jewish communities for a weekly Torah portion to be read during Jewish prayer services on Monday, Thursday, and Saturday. The full name, &quot;Parashat HaShavua&quot; (), is popularly abbreviated to parashah (also &quot;parshah&quot; or parsha), and is also known as a [[Seder (Bible)|Sidra]] or Sedra .

The &quot;parashah&quot; is a section of the Torah (Five Books of Moses) used in Jewish liturgy during a particular week. There are 54 parshas, or &quot;parashiyot&quot; in Hebrew, and the full cycle is read over the course of one Biblical year.

==Content and number==
Each Torah portion consists of two to six chapters to be read during the week. There are 54 weekly portions or &quot;parashot&quot;. Torah reading mostly follows an annual cycle beginning and ending on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, with the divisions corresponding to the lunisolar Hebrew calendar, which contains up to 55 weeks, the exact number varying between leap years and regular years.

There are some deviations to the cyclic regularity noted above, all related to the week of Passover and the week of Sukkot. For both holidays, the first day of the holiday may fall on a Sabbath, in which case the Torah reading consists of a special portion relevant to the holiday rather than a portion in the normal cyclical sequence. When either holiday does &quot;not&quot; begin on a Sabbath, yet a different &#x27;out of cycle&#x27; portion is read on the Sabbath within the holiday week. 

Immediately following Sukkot is the holiday of Shemini Atzeret. In Israel, this holiday coincides with Simchat Torah; in the Jewish Diaspora, Simchat Torah is celebrated on the day following Shemini Atzeret. If Shemini Atzeret falls on a Sabbath, in the Diaspora a special &#x27;out of cycle&#x27; Torah reading is inserted for that day. The final &quot;parashah&quot;, &quot;V&#x27;Zot HaBerachah&quot;, is always read on Simchat Torah.

Apart from this &quot;immovable&quot; final portion, there can be up to 53 weeks available for the other 53 portions. In years with fewer than 53 available weeks, some readings are combined to fit into the needed number of weekly readings.

The annual completion of the Torah readings on Simchat Torah, translating to &quot;Rejoicing of the Torah&quot;, is marked by Jewish communities around the world.

==Name==
Each weekly Torah portion takes its name from the first distinctive word or two in the Hebrew text of the portion in question, often from the first verse.
==Practice: who, when, what==
The appropriate &quot;parashah&quot; is chanted publicly. In most communities, it is read by a designated reader (&quot;ba&#x27;al koreh&quot;) in Jewish prayer services, starting with a partial reading on the afternoon of Shabbat, the Jewish Sabbath, i.e. Saturday afternoon, again during the Monday and Thursday morning services, and ending with a full reading during the following Shabbat morning services (Saturday morning). The weekly reading is pre-empted by a special reading on major religious holidays. Each Saturday morning and holiday reading is followed by an often similarly themed reading (&quot;Haftarah&quot;) from the Book of Prophets (&quot;Nevi&#x27;im&quot;).

==Origin==
The custom of dividing the Torah readings dates to the time of the Babylonian captivity (6th century BCE). The origin of the first public Torah readings is found in the Book of Nehemiah, where Ezra the scribe writes about wanting to find a way to ensure the Israelites would not go astray again. This led to the creation of a weekly system to read the portions of the Torah at synagogues.

===Alternative triennial cycle===
In ancient times some Jewish communities practiced a triennial cycle of readings. In the 19th and 20th centuries, many congregations in the Reform and Conservative Jewish movements implemented an alternative triennial cycle in which only one-third of each weekly &quot;parashah&quot; was read in a given year; and this pattern continues. The &quot;parashot&quot; read are still consistent with the annual cycle, but the entire Torah is completed over three years. Orthodox Judaism does not follow this practice.

===Differences between Israel and the diaspora===
Due to different lengths of holidays in Israel and the Diaspora, the portion that is read on a particular week will sometimes not be the same inside and outside Israel. This only occurs when a Diaspora holiday—which are one day longer than those in Israel—extends into Shabbat.

==Differences between communities==
While the &quot;Parshyot&quot; divisions are fairly standardized, there are various communities with differing &quot;parsha&quot; divisions. For example, many Yemenites combine &quot;Korach&quot; with the first half of &quot;Chukat&quot; and the second half of &quot;Chukat&quot; (&quot;Vayis&#x27;u mi-kadesh&quot;) with &quot;Balak&quot; instead of combining &quot;Matot&quot; and &quot;Masei&quot;, and some Syrian communities combine &quot;Korach&quot; and &quot;Chukat&quot; instead of &quot;Matot&quot; and &quot;Masei&quot;. In Provence and Tunisia, &quot;Mishpatim&quot; and &quot;Im Kesef Talveh&quot; were occasionally divided so that &quot;Matot&quot; and &quot;Masei&quot; would always be read together.

==Base for division into portions==
The division of &quot;parashiot&quot; found in the modern-day Torah scrolls of all Ashkenazic, Sephardic, and Yemenite communities is based upon the systematic list provided by Maimonides in &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;, &quot;Laws of Tefillin, Mezuzah and Torah Scrolls&quot;, Chapter 8. Maimonides based his division of the &quot;parashot&quot; for the Torah on the Masoretic text of the Aleppo Codex.

==Table of weekly readings==
In the table, a portion that may be combined with the following portion to compensate for the changing number of weeks in the lunisolar year, is marked with an asterisk. The following chart will show the weekly readings.

<text>Leander Club, founded in 1818, is one of the oldest rowing clubs in the world, and the oldest non-academic club. It is based in Remenham in Berkshire, England and adjoins Henley-on-Thames. Only three other surviving clubs were founded prior to Leander: Brasenose College Boat Club and Jesus College Boat Club (the two competing in a Head race in 1815) and Westminster School Boat Club, founded in 1813.

==History==

Leander was founded on the Tideway in 1818 or 1819 by members of the old &quot;Star&quot; and &quot;Arrow&quot; Clubs and membership was at first limited to sixteen. &quot;The Star&quot; and &quot;the Arrow&quot; clubs died out sometime in the 1820s and Leander itself was in full swing by 1825. By 1830 it was looked upon as a well-known and established boat club.

In its early days, Leander was as much a social association as a competitive club and it was steered by a waterman. It was the first club to support young watermen and instituted a coat and badge for scullers.
In 1831, Leander defeated Oxford University in a race rowed from Hambleden Lock to Henley Bridge, but when it lost the match with Cambridge six years later, Lord Esher noted at a dinner that Leander was:

However, Lord Esher also noted that they were &quot;verging on being middle-aged men.&quot;
Until 1856, the number of members was limited to twenty-five men. After this date membership was increased to thirty-five and the limit finally abolished in 1862. In 1858 Leander began to recruit members from both Oxford University and Cambridge University.

Its first home is assumed to have been Searle&#x27;s yard, Stangate – on the south bank of the River Thames (on land currently occupied by St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital). In 1860 the membership moved the club to Putney where a small piece of land was rented on which a tent was erected for housing boats. This land was bought by London Rowing Club in 1864 and is the site of LRC&#x27;s current clubhouse.
Leander was able to lease a piece of land adjoining and in 1866 started to construct a boathouse. Thirty years later, in 1897, the club purchased land in Henley-on-Thames and built its current clubhouse. The club&#x27;s centre of gravity moved rapidly to Henley, although the Putney boathouse was retained until 1961.

Leander entered a crew at Henley Royal Regatta for the first time in 1840, the year following the regatta&#x27;s foundation. Their crew which won the Grand Challenge Cup included Thomas Lowther Jenkins in the 5 seat. Jenkins&#x27; winner&#x27;s medal was discovered in a Belfast junk shop more than 130 years later by a member who donated it to the club, where it sits in one of the trophy cabinets.

For the first 179 years of its existence, Leander was a male-only club but has accepted women members since 1998. On 1 January 2013 Debbie Flood was elected as the club&#x27;s first female captain, and was re-elected the following year.

Leander was one of five clubs which retained the right until 2012 to appoint representatives to the Council of British Rowing. The others were London Rowing Club, Thames Rowing Club, Oxford University Boat Club and Cambridge University Boat Club.

Leander members contributed 23 of the 45 British rowers selected for the 2020 Summer Olympics.

In Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s novel &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;, the character Cousin Jasper (who &quot;had come within appreciable distance of getting his rowing blue&quot;) wears a Leander Club tie when he first calls upon the protagonist Charles Ryder to offer advice on being a student at Oxford.:24,25 In the 1981 television adaptation, Cousin Jasper (played by Stephen Moore) is depicted wearing the Leander&#x27;s &quot;city&quot; tie (dark blue with small pink hippopotamus motifs). In the novel &quot;Growing Up&quot; by Angela Thirkell, the Rev. Tommy Needham &quot;thought how well his college and Leander oars, never to be used again, would look upon the wall...&quot; The Leander Club figures heavily in Deborah Crombie&#x27;s detective novel, &quot;No Mark Upon Her&quot;.

<doc id="827490" wikidata="Q1782772" url="?curid=827490" title="Tilefish">
<text>Tilefishes are mostly small perciform marine fish comprising the family Malacanthidae. They are usually found in sandy areas, especially near coral reefs. They have a long life span, up to 46 years (females) and 39 years (males). 

Commercial fisheries exist for the largest species, making them important food fish. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warns pregnant or breastfeeding women against eating tilefish and some other fish due to mercury contamination.
 Exceptionally colorful smaller species of tilefish are favored for aquariums.

== Taxonomic issues ==
The family is further divided into two subfamilies: Latilinae, sometimes called the Branchiosteginae, and Malacanthinae. Some authors regard these subfamilies as two evolutionarily distinct families.

The placement of this family within the Eupercaria is still uncertain. The 5th edition of &quot;Fishes of the World&quot; classifies them within the Perciformes but in a grouping of seven families that may have a relationship to Acanthuroidei, Monodactylidae, and Priacanthidae, while other authorities place it outside the Perciformes, at an order level but with its true relationships being &quot;incertae sedis&quot;.

==Subfamilies and genera==
The following two subfamilies and five genera are classified within the family Malacanthidae, in total it contains 45 species.

* subfamily Latilinae 
** genus &quot;Branchiostegus&quot; 
** genus &quot;Caulolatilus&quot; 
** genus &quot;Lopholatilus&quot; Goode &amp; Bean, 1879
* subfamily Malacanthinae 
** genus &quot;Hoplolatilus&quot; 
** genus &quot;Malacanthus&quot; 

==Description==

The two subfamilies appear to be morphologically different, with members of the Latilinae having deeper bodies bearing predorsal ridge and heads rounded to squarish in profile. In contrast, members of the Malacanthinae are more slender with elongated bodies lacking predorsal ridge and rounded head. They also differ ecologically, with latilines typically occurring below 50 m and malacanthines shallower than 50 m depth.

Tilefish range in size from (yellow tilefish, &quot;Hoplolatilus luteus&quot;) to (great northern tilefish, &quot;Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps&quot;) and a weight of .

Both subfamilies have long dorsal and anal fins, the latter having one or two spines. The gill covers (opercula) have one spine which may be sharp or blunt; some species also have a cutaneous ridge atop the head. The tail fin may range in shape from truncated to forked. Most species are fairly low-key in colour, commonly shades of yellow, brown, and gray. Notable exceptions include three small, vibrant &quot;Hoplolatilus&quot; species: the purple sand tilefish (&quot;H. purpureus&quot;), Starck&#x27;s tilefish (&quot;H. starcki&quot;), and the redback sand tilefish (&quot;H. marcosi&quot;).

Tilefish larvae are notable for their elaborate spines. The family name Malacanthidae, is based on the type genus &quot;Malacanthus&quot; which is a compound of the Greek words &quot;malakos&quot; meaning &quot;soft&quot; and &quot;akanthos&quot; meaning &quot;thorn&quot;, possibly derived from the slender, flexible spines in the dorsal fin of &quot;Malacanthus plumieri&quot;.

== Habitat and diet ==
Generally shallow-water fish, tilefish are usually found at depths of 50–200 m in both temperate and tropical waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. All species seek shelter in self-made burrows, caves at the bases of reefs, or piles of rock, often in canyons or at the edges of steep slopes. Either gravelly or sandy substrate may be preferred, depending on the species.

Most species are strictly marine; an exception is found in the blue blanquillo (&quot;Malacanthus latovittatus&quot;) which is known to enter the brackish waters of Papua New Guinea&#x27;s Goldie River.

Tilefish feed primarily on small benthic invertebrates, especially crustaceans such as crab and shrimp. Mollusks, worms, sea urchins, and small fish are also taken.

After the 1882 mass die-off, great northern tilefish were thought to be extinct until a large number were caught in 1910 near New Bedford, Massachusetts.

== Behaviour and reproduction ==

Active fish, tilefish keep to themselves and generally stay at or near the bottom. They rely heavily on their keen eyesight to catch their prey. If approached, the fish quickly dive into their constructed retreats, often head-first. The chameleon sand tilefish (&quot;Hoplolatilus chlupatyi&quot;) relies on its remarkable ability to rapidly change colour (with a wide range) to evade predators.

Many species form monogamous pairs, while some are solitary in nature (e.g., ocean whitefish, &quot;Caulolatilus princeps&quot;), and others colonial. Some species, such as the rare pastel tilefish (&quot;Hoplolatilus fronticinctus&quot;) of the Indo-Pacific, actively builds large rubble mounds above which they school and in which they live. These mounds serve as both refuge and as a microecosystem for other reef species.

The reproductive habits of tilefish are not well studied. Spawning occurs throughout the spring and summer; all species are presumed not to guard their broods. Eggs are small and made buoyant by oil. The larvae are pelagic and drift until the fish have reached the juvenile stage.

== Health effects ==

Tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico have been shown to have high levels of mercury, and the FDA has recommended against their consumption by pregnant women. Atlantic Ocean tilefish may have lower levels of mercury and may be safer to consume.

<text>Sabdapalon was a priest and adviser to Brawijaya V, the last ruler of the Hindu-Buddhist empire Majapahit in Java. He was mentioned in Darmagandhul, a Javanese spiritual story. He was also said to have cursed his king upon the latter&#x27;s conversion to Islam in 1478. Sabdapalon then promised to return, after 500 years and at a time of widespread political corruption and natural disasters, to sweep Islam from the island and restore Hindu-Buddha Javanese religion, known as &quot;Buda&quot;, and his civilization.

Some of the first new Hindu temples built in Java were indeed completed around 1978, for example Pura Blambangan in the Banyuwangi Regency. As the prophesies foretold, Mt. Semeru erupted around the same time. All this is taken as evidence of the accuracy of Sabdapalon&#x27;s predictions.

<text>Jayabhaya or Jayabaya (Javanese spelled: Ratu Jayabaya), was the Javanese king of the Kediri Kingdom in East Java, Indonesia, who ruled from around 1135 to 1159 CE. With the title of &quot;abhiseka&quot; used is Sri Maharaja Sang Mapanji Jayabhaya Sri Warmeswara Madhusudana Awataranindita Suhtrisingha Parakrama Uttunggadewa. The reign of King Jayabhaya is considered the zenith of the Kediri Kingdom.
King Jayabaya is credited with the reunification of the Kediri Kingdom following a division caused by the death of his predecessor, Airlangga. Known for his just and prosperous rule, King Jayabaya was reputed to be an incarnation of the Hindu deity Vishnu. He epitomized the archetypal &quot;Ratu Adil&quot;, the just king who is reborn during a &quot;Jaman Edan&quot; (Era of Madness)—a dark age of suffering—to restore &quot;Jaman Raharja&quot;: a time of social justice, order, and harmony. The Javanese believed in a cyclical history, where epochs of prosperity (&quot;Jaman Raharja&quot;) are followed by eras of suffering (&quot;Jaman Edan&quot;), eventually returning to prosperity again.

Jayabaya named his kingdom Widarba, meaning &quot;a thousand cities,&quot; centered in Pamenang, modern-day Kediri Regency. Records, blending fact and myth, indicate that his father, Gendrayana the Revolutionary, claimed descent from the Pandavas. He was said to be the son of Yudayana, son of Parikshit, son of Abhimanyu, son of Arjuna, from the Pandava lineage.

From Jayabaya&#x27;s queen consort, Dewi Sara, he had four daughters: Jaya Amijaya, Dewi Pramesti, Dewi Pramuni, and Dewi Sasanti. Jaya Amijaya married King Astradarma Pramesti Yawastina, with whom she bore Malawapati, the King of Anglingdarma.

In his old age, Jayabaya abdicated and chose a life of meditation as a Hindu recluse, seeking &quot;moksha&quot; (spiritual liberation) and embracing his role as an incarnation of Vishnu. He retreated to the village of Menang, in the Pagu sub-district of Kediri Regency, which remains a revered pilgrimage site according to the Kejawen belief system. In later history, both Sukarno and Suharto meditated extensively in Menang to seek an aura of kingly legitimacy, supernatural abilities, and Jayabaya&#x27;s blessings or powers.

==Prophecies==

Ratu Jayabaya is most famous for the oracles or prophecies attributed to him, including the &quot;Serat Jayabaya Musarar&quot;, &quot;Serat Pranitiwakya&quot;, and some others that remain debated. The &quot;mangala&quot; (prologue) of the renowned &quot;Kakawin Bhāratayuddha&quot; names King Jayabaya as the patron of the two poets, Mpu Sedah and Mpu Panuluh, who authored the work. Jayabaya is also credited as the author of the &quot;Prelambang Jayabaya&quot;, a prophetic book that played an influential role during the Japanese occupation. 

According to a selectively abridged set of stanzas within a Jayabaya prophecy (as all are extremely long epic poems): 

The Javanese would be ruled by whites for 3 centuries and by yellow dwarfs for the life span of a maize plant prior to the return of the Ratu Adil: whose name must contain at least one syllable of the Javanese Nata Nagara.
When Japan occupied the Netherlands East Indies in the early weeks of 1942, many Indonesians celebrated, seeing the Japanese army as the fulfillment of a prophecy attributed to Jayabaya. He had foretold a time when white men would establish their rule over Java and oppress the people for many years, only to be driven out by &quot;yellow men from the north.&quot; According to Jayabaya, these &quot;yellow dwarves&quot; would remain for one crop cycle (interpreted as 3 1/2 years, corresponding to the duration of Japanese occupation), after which Java would be free from foreign domination. To most Javanese, Japan was seen as a liberator, as the prophecy appeared to be fulfilled.

The Japanese freed Indonesian nationalists from Dutch prisons and employed them as civil servants and administrators. By late 1944, however, it became clear that Japan could not win the war. On 9 August 1945, Japan officially transferred its authority to Indonesia to prepare for independence, and the commander of Japan&#x27;s Southeast Asian forces appointed future President Sukarno as chairman of the preparatory committee for Indonesian independence. As one account of Indonesian history notes, “With the minor exception that three crops had been harvested, Jayabaya’s prophecy had been realized.”

Many believe that the time for the arrival of a new &quot;Ratu Adil&quot; is near, as the prophecies foretell: “when iron wagons drive without horses and ships sail through the sky.” This figure is expected to rescue and reunite Indonesia after a period of acute crisis, ushering in a new golden age.

Anthropologist Martin Ramstedt speculates that the popularity of the millenarian prophecy concerning the return of Jayabaya as a &quot;Ratu Adil&quot; contributed to General Suharto&#x27;s decision to suppress &quot;kebatinan&quot; movements as part of his persecution of alleged PKI members, leading to the mass-killing of 1965–66. Ramstedt provides several reasons for this conclusion. The prophecy of the return of a &quot;Ratu Adil&quot; was widely popular among followers of &quot;kebatinan&quot; groups, many of whom were also supporters of the PKI. Although Suharto himself showed some affinity for &quot;kebatinan&quot; practices, he deeply distrusted their loyalty to him. Additionally, Suharto was aware that his predecessor Sukarno was identified as a &quot;Ratu Adil&quot;, while Suharto himself was not, making this prophecy a potential threat to his legitimacy.

<text>Sanjay Gandhi National Park is an protected area in Mumbai, Maharashtra. It was established in 1969 with its headquarters situated at Borivali.

The 2400-year-old Kanheri caves, sculpted by monks out of the rocky basaltic cliffs, lie within the park. The rich flora and fauna of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park attract more than 2 million visitors every year.

==History==

The Kanheri caves, located centrally in the park, were important Buddhist learning centres and pilgrimage sites sculpted by Buddhist monks between the 9th and the 1st centuries BCE. They were chiselled out of a massive basaltic rock outcropping.
In 1996, the park was renamed to Sanjay Gandhi National Park, after Sanjay Gandhi. The same year, some forests from the Thane division were merged into the park, further expanding its total area to .

==Geography==
The park occupies most of the northern suburbs of Mumbai. To the west lie the suburbs of Goregaon, Malad, Kandivali, Borivali and Dahisar. To the east lie the suburbs of Bhandup and Mulund. To the south lies the Aarey Milk Colony and the university campus of IIT Bombay. The northern reaches of this forest lie in Thane city. The park and the areas surrounding it, except Thane city, are all part of Mumbai. It is the only protected forest located within the limits of a city.

The region is hilly with elevations between . Vihar Lake and Tulsi Lake in the park meet a part of the city&#x27;s water requirements. The park is said to be the lungs of the city as it purifies much of the air pollution in the city.

==Wildlife==

This park is home to a number of endangered species of flora and fauna. The forest area of the park houses over 1,000 plant species, 251 species of migratory, land, and water birds, 5,000 species of insects, and 40 species of mammals. In addition, the park also provides shelter to 38 species of reptiles, 9 species of amphibians, 150 species of butterflies, and a large variety of fish.

===Flora===

In the state of Maharashtra, the mass flowering of &quot;karvi&quot; has been observed to occur in Mumbai in the same year as in the hill station of Khandala and one year earlier in Bhimashankar and Malshej Ghat, beyond Kalyan.

=== Fauna ===

The forest cover in the park helps provide the ideal habitat for many wild animals. Chital, rhesus macaque and bonnet macaque are some of the wild mammals often spotted inside the park. Other large mammals found in the park include black-naped or Indian hare, muntjac (barking deer), porcupine, Asian palm civet, Small Indian civet, chevrotain, grey langur, Indian flying fox, sambar deer and leopard.

Reptiles living here include crocodiles in the Tulsi Lake, pythons, cobras, Checkered keelback, Common krait, monitor lizards, Russell&#x27;s vipers, bamboo pit viper and Indian cat snakes.

In 2003, pugmarks and droppings of a Bengal tiger were found in the park. Although the tiger was never widely sighted, it did bring some excitement to city folks as records of tiger being found here are quite old and forgotten now with the last tiger being shot down 80 years earlier in the region. Conservation was also proposed for the interlinked habitat corridors and nearby forest areas in the state along with upgrading their status as tiger habitat.

A total 172 species of butterflies have been reported here, of which the spectacular ones are blue Mormon, the phenomenal artist of camouflage, blue oak leaf, bright Jezebel and large yellow and white orange tip, tiger butterfly, eggflies and sailers. There are a number of moths too. The largest moth is the size of a sparrow (30 cm).

Some of the birds in the park are jungle owlets, golden orioles, racket-tailed drongos, minivets, magpies, robins, hornbills, bulbuls, sunbirds, peacock, and woodpeckers. Migratory and local birds such as the paradise flycatcher and various species of kingfishers, mynas, drongos, swifts, gulls, egrets, and herons have also been spotted.

==Threats==
The park has faced a number of problems similar to those faced by national parks elsewhere in the world, involving conflicts between natural and human interests.

In June 2004, leopards were responsible for the deaths of 20 humans within the span of a week. This was not the first attack: for the past 10 years, there have been attacks attributed to leopards stalking children and adults outside the park fringes. After an outcry was raised and the situation reached alarming proportions, eight leopards were caught and relocated.

The leopard threat still continues in and around the Thane district today, with repeated sightings as well as attacks on pets and humans. On 16 July 2012, a seven-year-old girl was killed in Mulund right outside her home by a leopard. A year later, a 40-year-old woman was attacked and killed by a leopard in Bhiwandi, Thane City, in 2013. Five days later, a 14-year-old shepherd survived a leopard attack in the same region. In 2014, a two-year-old child went missing from Ghoong village in Wada. August 2015 saw four leopard attacks in Thane city. In one incident, a leopard and her cub dragged a one-year-old Rottweiler off.

<doc id="827514" wikidata="Q450492" url="?curid=827514" title="Revolt of the Admirals">
<text>The &quot;Revolt of the Admirals&quot; was a policy and funding dispute within the United States government during the Cold War in 1949, involving a number of retired and active duty United States Navy admirals. These included serving officers Admiral Louis E. Denfeld, Chief of Naval Operations, and Vice Admiral Gerald F. Bogan, as well as Fleet Admirals Chester Nimitz and William Halsey, senior officers during World War II.

The episode occurred at a time when President Harry S. Truman and Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson were seeking to reduce military expenditures. This policy involved deep cuts in the Navy, while making the United States Air Force and strategic nuclear bombing the primary means of defending American interests. The Navy sought to carve out a role for itself in strategic bombing, which the Air Force saw as one of its primary roles.

Partly driven by interservice rivalry, the debate escalated from differences over strategy to the question of civilian control over the military. The cancellation of the aircraft carrier and accusations of impropriety by Johnson in regard to the purchase of the Convair B-36 Peacemaker bomber led to an investigation by the House Committee on Armed Services chaired by Carl Vinson.

While the dispute was settled in favor of the Truman administration, the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 demonstrated the shortcomings of a defense policy primarily reliant on nuclear weapons, and many of the proposed cuts to conventional forces were ultimately reversed.

==Background==
===Armed forces unification===
During World War II, the War Powers Act of 1941 allowed the president broad power to reorganize the armed forces, but this authority was to expire six months after the end of the war. In April 1944, the United States Congress began considering legislation for post-war organization. In response, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), the wartime body consisting of the most senior uniformed leaders prepared to make its own recommendations, as the organization of the JCS and its various advisory committees were themselves &quot;ad hoc&quot; wartime creations. On 9 May 1944, the JCS appointed a Special Committee for Reorganization of National Defense under the chairmanship of Admiral James O. Richardson, a former Commander in Chief, United States Fleet, consisting of Major General William F. Tompkins from the War Department General Staff, Major General Harold L. George from the USAAF, Rear Admiral Malcolm F. Schoeffel and Colonel F. Trubee Davison, a former Assistant Secretary of War for Air.
The committee reported to the JCS on 11 April 1945. It endorsed the unification of the War and Navy Departments into a single department of armed forces headed by a civilian secretary, with three equal services through the creation of an independent air force. During the war, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) had achieved a degree of &quot;de facto&quot; independence from the United States Army and was eager to become a fully-fledged armed service on an equal footing with the Army and the United States Navy. Richardson dissented, favoring the &quot;status quo&quot; over the creation of a new department, but he accepted the proposal to perpetuate the organization of the JCS by statute.

Senior Navy officers including Fleet Admirals William D. Leahy (the Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief), Ernest J. King (the Commander in Chief, United States Fleet) and Chester W. Nimitz (the Commander in Chief, US Pacific Fleet) regarded the committee&#x27;s recommendations as radical. They opposed the idea of a single secretary of National Defense, which they felt was too much responsibility for one man, and it interposed a civilian head between the JCS and the President of the United States, which might diminish the Navy&#x27;s power and influence. They also feared the possible loss of the Navy&#x27;s air arm, as had happened to the Royal Navy when the Royal Naval Air Service was absorbed into the Royal Air Force upon the creation of the latter in 1918.

The Senate Committee on Military Affairs formed a subcommittee to draft legislation, with Major General Lauris Norstad, the Assistant Chief of the Air Staff for Plans, and Rear Admiral Arthur W. Radford, the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (DCNO) for Air, as its advisors. Radford was considered a hard liner in his opposition to unification even within the Navy, and in July 1946, James Forrestal, the Secretary of the Navy and Nimitz, now the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), replaced him with the DCNO for Operations, Rear Admiral Forrest Sherman. Although also a naval aviator, Sherman did not oppose unification. He and Norstad drew up an agreement that was endorsed by the JCS and forwarded to President Harry S. Truman, for approval on 12 December 1946.

This became the basis for the National Security Act of 1947, which created the National Security Council (NSC), Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), an independent United States Air Force (USAF), three civilian military department heads and the National Military Establishment, a unified command with a cabinet-level Secretary of Defense to oversee the service departments and the JCS. The Act left the Navy with the autonomy it sought, and control of its own Naval and Marine Corps Aviation, effectively legitimizing four military air forces. The act appeared to end the debate, although none of the services was completely happy with it.

Forrestal, a former naval aviator who had led the fight against unification, was appointed the first Secretary of Defense; John L. Sullivan, formerly the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (AIR) succeeded him as Secretary of the Navy; Kenneth C. Royall, the Under Secretary of War, became the Secretary of the Army; and Stuart Symington, who had been the Assistant Secretary of War for Air, became the first Secretary of the Air Force. As the Navy had wanted, the Secretary of Defense had a coordination role and lacked the authority and resources to exercise effective control over service departments and their chiefs. Forrestal hoped that with unification accomplished, the services would set aside their parochial differences.

===Budgets and strategy===

Following the end of World War II, the United States Government was concerned about the large deficit spending that had been necessary for the war effort, which reached 119 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 1946. Deficit spending had lifted the United States out of the Great Depression, but now Truman and his economic advisors were concerned about the prospect of inflation, which rose to 14.4 percent in 1947 after wartime price controls were removed, and embraced austerity. To reduce expenditures, the armed services had to quickly demobilize and return to a peacetime military. Defense budgets declined from $81 billion in fiscal year 1945 (equivalent to $ billion in ) to $9 billion in fiscal year 1948 (equivalent to $ billion in ), representing a decline from 37.5 percent of GDP to 3.5 percent. The services were reduced from 89 Army and Marine divisions to 12; from 213 Air Force air groups to 63 (only 11 of which were operational, with some existing only on paper); and from 1,166 Navy warships to 343. Meanwhile, $13 billion went into the Marshall Plan, from 1948 to 1952.

US war plans were drafted for a potential conflict with the Soviet Union. It was considered unlikely that the Soviet Union wanted to start a war, but the plans were prepared for the possibility that one might break out as a result of a miscalculation. The Soviet Union had fifty divisions in Germany and Austria to the U.S. Army&#x27;s one, enough to quickly overrun Europe east of the Rhine. This was a major barrier, but it was not considered that it could be held for long, forcing a retreat to the Pyrenees. In view of the Soviet Union&#x27;s overwhelming superiority in conventional forces, the planners felt that the United States had no alternative means of striking back other than a strategic air offensive employing both conventional and nuclear weapons.

Admiral Louis E. Denfeld, who had succeeded Nimitz as CNO on 15 December 1947, was critical of the war plan, which he regarded as deeply flawed. He noted that abandoning Western Europe without a struggle ran counter to the US Government policy of building up the democracies there, and it meant accepting the loss of the Mediterranean Sea as well. The plan called for using the Karachi area as a base for the strategic air campaign, but this would involve an enormous logistical effort to sustain, and it would not support other elements of the war plan. Moreover, there was no fallback in case the strategic bombing campaign failed. He was willing to sign off on the plan only as a temporary one for short-range planning and advocated a more aggressive strategy in which the Rhine and Middle East were held. None of the three services had the resources to implement the short-term war plan, much less the more ambitious one.

===Strategic bombing===
In the years leading up to World War II, the United States Army Air Corps had developed a doctrine of strategic bombing, which was promulgated by the Air Corps Tactical School. The experience of strategic bombing during World War II revealed major flaws in the Air Corps&#x27;, later Army Air Forces&#x27;, precision bombing doctrine. Unescorted bombers were found to be highly vulnerable to enemy fighter aircraft and took high losses. Improvements in anti-aircraft guns drove the bombers to higher altitudes, from which accurate bombing was difficult. None of the principal targets of the bombing offensive in Europe was destroyed or even suffered severe disruption and only the oil campaign was ultimately regarded as successful. Air raids on Japan encountered weather and flying conditions that made daylight precision bombing from high altitude even more difficult than in Europe, resulting in a switch of tactics to low-level area bombing of cities with incendiaries. The wartime Chief of the USAAF, General of the Army Henry H. Arnold, contended that the conventional bombing had destroyed Japan&#x27;s ability to wage war, and the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki had given the Emperor of Japan an excuse to end the war.
The advent of nuclear weapons gave the strategic bombardment theorists encouragement that the factors that had limited the effectiveness of strategic bombing during the war could be overcome. Colonel Dale O. Smith, USAF, wrote that:

The bombing campaign called for in the war plans was both nuclear and conventional. By June 1948, components for about fifty Fat Man and two Little Boy bombs were on hand. These had to be assembled by specially trained Armed Forces Special Weapons Project assembly teams. Only Silverplate Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers were capable of delivering nuclear weapons, and of the 65 that had been made, only 32 were operational at the start of 1948, all of which were assigned to the 509th Bombardment Group, which was based at Walker Air Force Base, formerly Roswell Army Airfield, in New Mexico. Trained crews were also in short supply; at the beginning of 1948 only six crews were qualified to fly atomic bombing missions, although enough personnel had been trained to assemble an additional fourteen in an emergency. But up to 20 percent of the target cities in the war plan were beyond the range of the B-29, requiring a one-way mission, which would expend the crew, bomb and aircraft. There were also doubts about the ability of the B-29 to penetrate Soviet air space; as a propeller-driven bomber, it was highly vulnerable to the new Soviet jet fighters, even at night.
The B-29 was the mainstay of the bomber fleet in 1948, but that year the Convair B-36 Peacemaker was introduced into service. During World War II, early German victories had led to apprehension that the United Kingdom might be overrun. The Air Corps therefore invited design proposals for an intercontinental bomber that could reach Germany from bases in the United States. These proposals resulted in the B-36 aircraft, which pushed the state of the art, but soon ran into development and schedule problems, and lost priority to the B-29. It was not canceled, and in 1943 when it looked like bases in China—the only ones in Allied hands at the time within B-29 range of Japan—might be overrun, an order was placed for 100 B-36s. Most aircraft orders were cut back or canceled in 1945, but the B-36 order was left untouched.

Many Air Force officers were skeptical of the value of the B-36, but in tests conducted between April and June 1948, the B-36 outperformed the Boeing B-50 Superfortress, the improved model of the B-29, in long-range cruising speed, load capacity and combat radius. The commencement of the Berlin Blockade in June 1948 led to increased concerns about the aggressive stance taken by the Soviet Union, and demands for an intercontinental bomber. The B-36 was not yet atomic capable; deliveries of atomic-capable B-36s commenced in 1949. In service, it suffered from a host of problems, as was usual for new aircraft. An intrinsic one was that it was a piston-engine aircraft in the era of jets. It was therefore accepted as an interim aircraft, pending the introduction of the jet Boeing B-52 Stratofortress, but this was not expected to occur before 1952.

The 80th Congress adjourned in August 1948 without passing a bill authorizing a 70-group peacetime air force, but the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Hoyt Vandenberg, took the provision of a first increment of funds for the purpose as a mandate and commenced the acquisition process for the 2,201 aircraft required with the funds on hand. This included the remaining 95 B-36s from the original contract, along with 10 of the new Boeing B-47 Stratojet bombers, 132 B-50s, 1,457 jet fighters and 147 transport planes. In 1948, the services began preparing their budget submissions for fiscal year 1950. The Air Staff requested $8 billion, which would cover the 70-group program. But after word got around that budgets would be cut proportionately, Symington arbitrarily increased the submission to $11 billion. The resulting service requests, when tallied in July, came to $29 billion.
There was no reason to believe that this would be available. The Bureau of the Budget had originally forecast a $5 billion surplus in fiscal year 1950, but the recession of 1949, resulted in a drop in revenue and a revised forecast of a $2 billion deficit. Forrestal cut the defense request to $23.6 billion in October 1948, but the Bureau of the Budget convinced Truman to set a $14.4 billion ceiling on defense expenditure in fiscal year 1950. The Joint Chiefs estimated that in the event of a war, this would reduce the United States reaction to a strategic bombing offensive from the United Kingdom. The Joint Chiefs of Staff divided the $14.4 billion between the three services, giving $4.834 billion to the Army, $4.624 billion to the Navy, and $5.025 billion to the Air Force.

This meant that the Air Force would have to cut back to just 48 groups. Vandenberg convened a senior officers&#x27; board chaired by General Joseph T. McNarney to determine an appropriate structure. It decided to reduce the Strategic Air Command to 14 bombardment groups. Its commander Lieutenant General Curtis LeMay, stated that the atomic mission required four groups of bombers, which he said should be equipped with B-36s. The B-36 could cover 97 percent of targets in the Soviet Union from bases in North America, and in the conventional role it could carry of bombs over medium distances. He endorsed a proposal to improve the performance of the B-36 by adding twin jet pods (B-47 jet engines). Of the remaining ten bombardment groups, five would be equipped with B-50s, two with the new B-47s, and three with B-29s. The B-36 program actually benefited from the cutbacks, because $269,761,000 was recouped from the cancellation of orders for other aircraft. LeMay also recommended that the Boeing B-54, an improved version of the B-50, be canceled and the funds used to purchase 36 more B-36s and five more B-47s. Forrestal signed off on this recertification of funds in March 1949. That month the board also recommended that B-36 acquisition be limited to what was required for four groups, after which production would be switched over to the B-52.

===Aircraft carriers===
The Navy had no theoretical framework with which to develop a post-war strategy. Between 1890 and 1945 its doctrine had been based on the teachings of Alfred Thayer Mahan, who stressed the importance of control of the sea in securing the lines of communication through which maritime commerce traveled and argued that the main objective of a Navy was the destruction of the enemy&#x27;s battle fleet. But the Soviet Union had only a small navy, and as a Eurasian power, it was not dependent on maritime trade, and thus was immune to the effects of a naval blockade. Being in third place for funding behind the Army and Air Force represented a major loss of status for the Navy, which had traditionally seen itself as the nation&#x27;s first line of defense. The Navy&#x27;s budget had exceeded the Army&#x27;s for every year but one between 1922 and 1939. It enjoyed the support of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and had its own secretary who reported directly to him. The Navy had cultivated political patronage in Congress by dispersing construction and maintenance of its vessels around the nation, and the House Committee on Naval Affairs and the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs had supported the acquisition of expensive capital ships and the development of naval aviation.
The Navy had acquired its first aircraft carriers in 1922, when it commissioned a converted collier as the . Carriers accompanied the fleet, and the aircraft had the roles of scouting, observation and attacking enemy vessels. Between 1910 and 1930, around twenty percent of all naval officers went into naval aviation. These included Forrest Sherman, Arthur Radford, Gerald F. Bogan and Daniel V. Gallery, all of whom rose to flag rank in the wartime Navy. Crucially, and in contrast to the Army, where corps loyalty was paramount, the Navy inculcated the attitude that every officer was a naval officer first and a specialist second. This was bolstered by a long-standing ethos of creating a &quot;balanced fleet&quot;, in which all specialists played a part. While some naval aviators became zealous advocates of naval air power, they expressed no desire to separate from the Navy.

To operate from carriers, aircraft needed tailhooks and strengthened undercarriages, which made them heavier and less maneuverable than similar land-based aircraft, but fears that they could not compete against land-based fighters proved ultimately groundless; between 1 September 1944 and 15 August 1945, US Navy Grumman F6F Hellcat and Vought F4U Corsair fighters downed 2,948 Japanese fighters against a loss of 191 of their own. However, like strategic bombing, the record of aircraft carriers was not as clear cut as the enthusiasts suggested. Only two battleships were sunk by US carrier aircraft alone: the giant and . US carrier aircraft accounted for 4 of the 18 Japanese heavy cruisers that were sunk, 6 of the 25 light cruisers and 27 of the 127 destroyers. What they were particularly lethal against was other aircraft carriers, sinking 11 of the 19 Japanese carriers sunk in the war. In the post-war drawdown, the aircraft carrier fleet was reduced to the three and eight .

One role the Navy could play in a conflict with the Soviet Union was participation in strategic bombing. In December 1947, Gallery wrote a top secret memorandum on the subject. The idea was that instead of building a bomber with a range of , Gallery argued that it was a better idea to build one with lesser range that could be launched from an aircraft carrier. Radford noted that any target in the world was within of the sea. A carrier could be deployed quickly in a crisis, and did not require the establishment of expensive overseas bases. Gallery even went further than most Navy officers in arguing that strategic bombing with nuclear weapons should be the &quot;primary&quot; mission of the Navy. In forwarding the memo to Sullivan, Denfeld wrote: &quot;I not only consider Rear Admiral Gallery&#x27;s initiative in preparing the paper was commendable and proper, but that the paper itself demonstrates the type of constructive thinking that the Navy tries at all times to encourage.&quot; The memo was leaked to a syndicated newspaper columnist, Drew Pearson, who published it in &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; and the &quot;Philadelphia Bulletin&quot;. Denfeld gave Gallery a private reprimand for making &quot;an extensive and somewhat uncontrolled distribution of a classified document.&quot;
This concept had severe practical limitations in 1948. The characteristics of nuclear weapons were not widely known at the time, but the Navy did have some expertise in officers who had served with the wartime Manhattan Project, principally Deak Parsons, John T. &quot;Chick&quot; Hayward and Frederick L. Ashworth. Twelve Lockheed P2V Neptunes were configured for the atomic mission, and a squadron of them, VC-5, was formed under Hayward&#x27;s command. A Fat Man atomic bomb was wide and weighed , and there was no aircraft in the Navy&#x27;s inventory that could carry a bomb that wide, but the P2V could carry the slimmer Little Boy bomb, (although they were in limited supply, with most US nuclear production being of the Fat Man). It was demonstrated that the P2V could take off from the three large &quot;Midway&quot;-class aircraft carriers with the aid of jet-assisted take-off JATO rockets. The ability to land on one was less certain and never attempted. This meant a one-way mission expending bomb, aircraft and crew (like the 1918 Tondern raid). On 7 March 1949, Hayward flew a simulated atomic bombing mission against California in a P2V launched from the carrier off the East Coast. He dropped a pumpkin bomb on the Salton Sea test site near El Centro, California, and then flew back across the country to land at NAS Patuxent River in Maryland. A more suitable aircraft, the North American AJ Savage, was under development.

Forrestal considered the notion of a single service having a monopoly on nuclear weapons to be misguided. He convened a conference at Key West from 11 to 14 March 1948 that was attended by the JCS and one deputy each to discuss the roles of the different services. The resulting Key West Agreement assigned primary responsibility for strategic bombing to the Air Force, but the Navy was not prohibited from participating. Forrestal laid down that the Navy would be utilised when it had &quot;capacities for delivery&quot;. Navy leadership doubted that wars could be won by strategic bombing alone, and some naval officers had a moral objection to relying upon the widespread use of nuclear weapons to destroy the major population centers. Most felt that atomic bombs were best used against targets like submarine pens and logistical hubs rather than cities and industrial facilities. The Gallery memorandum led some senior leaders in the Air Force to fear that the Navy wanted to take over the strategic bombing mission, but the real agenda for naval aviators was to justify their own existence.

==Cancellation of USS &quot;United States&quot;==
Since 1945, the Navy had been working on the design of a new class of aircraft carrier. Its principal proponent was Admiral Marc Mitscher, Radford&#x27;s predecessor as the DCNO for Air and the skipper of the during the 1942 Doolittle Raid, when USAAF North American B-25 Mitchell bombers were launched from that aircraft carrier. Mitscher proposed the construction of an aircraft carrier that would have been ideal for that mission. He wanted a flush deck so that it could operate 16 to 24 large bombers weighing up to , and carry enough fuel and bombs for 100 sorties to be flown without rearming or refueling. Another advantage of the flush deck was highlighted by the 1946 Operation Crossroads nuclear tests: it was less susceptible to the shock waves produced by a nearby nuclear explosion.
The flush deck carrier was given the designation SCB Project 6A. Since the bombers would be too large to fit in a hangar, Mitscher suggested that it be dispensed with, but the designers added a high one so it could also carry 80 McDonnell F2H Banshee jet fighters. They calculated that 24 Douglas A3D Skywarrior bombers would require a flight deck long and wide; this was reduced to so it would fit into the Navy&#x27;s largest dry docks. It was estimated that a carrier of this size would have a full load displacement of up to . Although the proposed 6A carrier was only longer than the &quot;Midway&quot;s, its size and radical appearance led the media to refer to it as a &quot;supercarrier&quot;. The plan was that the Navy&#x27;s aircraft carriers would operate in four carrier strike groups, each with a 6A, a &quot;Midway&quot;-class and two &quot;Essex&quot;-class aircraft carriers (since there were only three &quot;Midway&quot;s, one group would have a third &quot;Essex&quot; in lieu). Four 6A carriers were therefore slated to be built, with one laid down each year from 1949 to 1952, with all four operational by 1955. The ship&#x27;s characteristics were approved by Nimitz as CNO on 2 September 1947, and by the acting Secretary of the Navy, W. John Kenney, the following day.

The first 6A represented a $189 million line item (equivalent to $ in ) in a $14 billion defense budget (equivalent to $ in ), and that was inevitably going to attract the attention of the Bureau of the Budget. On 16 December 1947, its director, James E. Webb, stated that he was opposed to the 1949 shipbuilding program due to its cost. Sullivan offered to cancel the battleship and Large Cruiser to assure funds for the 6A carrier, and Webb informed Sullivan that he and Truman had accepted the shipbuilding program on that basis on 19 December. The Joint Chiefs&#x27; approval was not sought in 1947, because the new unification law had not yet been enacted. In testimony before Congress in May 1948, Sullivan and Denfeld said that the 6A carrier had the approval of the Joint Chiefs, the Secretary of Defense and the President. General Carl Spaatz, the retired Chief of Staff of the Air Force, objected; the Joint Chiefs had never approved it. Forrestal then submitted it to the Joint Chiefs for their approval on 26 May 1948. Leahy, Denfeld and the Chief of Staff of the Army, General Omar N. Bradley, approved it; Vandenberg refused to do so. Congress funded the 6A carrier as part of the shipbuilding program on 24 June 1948, and Forrestal gave his approval on 22 July, giving the first 6A carrier the designation CVA-58, and Truman authorized the shipbuilding program the following day. The keel of the ship, which was named the , was laid at Newport News, Virginia, on 23 April 1949.

Forrestal did not support Truman&#x27;s 1948 Presidential campaign; instead, he met with Truman&#x27;s opponent, Thomas E. Dewey, with whom he discussed the possibility of remaining in cabinet in a Republican administration. Truman was angered by this, and on 2 March 1949, after he won the election, he announced that Forrestal was being replaced by Louis A. Johnson, who had raised $1.5 million for Truman&#x27;s re-election campaign. On 22 May, Forrestal committed suicide by self-defenestration. Johnson had no qualms over supporting Truman&#x27;s military budget reductions and fiscally preferred the Air Force&#x27;s argument. His idea of an executive was someone who gave orders, and those orders were to be carried out immediately and without question. When the naval officers questioned his decisions on weapons and strategy (such as the cancellation of the &quot;United States&quot;), he took that as a sign of insubordination. When attacks appeared against his character, he wanted those responsible severely punished.
Johnson sought the opinions of General of the Army Dwight Eisenhower, the three service secretaries and the Joint Chiefs on the advisability of continuing the construction of the &quot;United States&quot;. Bradley and Vandenberg urged its cancellation, although Bradley had been in favor of the carrier the previous year. On 23 April 1949 Johnson canceled the &quot;United States&quot;; Truman concurred with the decision. This vessel was the symbol and hope for the Navy&#x27;s future, and its cancellation greatly demoralized the service. Sullivan met with Truman on 25 April and submitted his resignation to Johnson the following day. Johnson did not seem disturbed. His decision to cancel &quot;United States&quot; provided him with economy in the military budget needed to meet his budgetary goals, while demonstrating that he was in firm control of the military and able to make difficult decisions.

To replace Sullivan, Johnson recommended Francis P. Matthews for the position of Secretary of the Navy. A lawyer from Omaha, Nebraska, he had served as a director of the United Service Organizations (USO), a service organization that entertained the troops. He came to the attention of Johnson by assisting him with political fund raising for the 1948 Truman campaign. Matthews admitted the nearest he had come to naval experience was rowing a boat on a lake. He was sworn in on 25 May 1949. Another change that month was the departure of Radford, who became Commander in Chief Pacific (CINCPAC), and was replaced as VCNO by Vice Admiral John D. Price. On 10 August, Truman signed amendments to the National Security Act, which created the new position of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and he appointed Bradley to the position.

A research group, OP-23, a naval intelligence unit formed in December 1948 by Denfeld to advise him on unification and later headed by Captain Arleigh Burke, had been gathering information to help defend the Navy&#x27;s position, including material critical of the B-36&#x27;s performance and capabilities. In April 1949 what became known as the Anonymous Document appeared. It pointed out that prior to his posting as Secretary of Defense Johnson had been on the board of directors of Convair, the manufacturer of the B-36 bomber, and was the head of Convair&#x27;s law firm. The document highlighted his apparent conflict of interest in representing the government with this manufacturer. It went on to claim that the B-36 was a &quot;billion-dollar blunder&quot; and alleged &quot;fraud&quot; on the part of B-36 contractors regarding costs, capabilities and test results. The document was sent to Glenn L. Martin, the chairman of the Glenn L. Martin Company, and several members of Congress.

==Congressional hearings==

At first there was little sign that Congress would conduct an investigation of the Anonymous Document. Senator Millard Tydings, the Chairman of the Senate Armed Service Committee, was a close friend of Martin&#x27;s, but was wary of the contents of the Anonymous Document. Carl Vinson, the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee had concerns about the ongoing publicity campaigns of the Navy and Air Force, particularly the leaking of classified information. This included the publication by a United Press reporter, Charles W. Corddry, that the United States was targeting 70 Soviet cities for strategic bombardment. With the influential Tydings unwilling to act, Congressman James Van Zandt introduced a resolution in the House of Representatives on 25 May 1949 calling for an investigation of contract awards and cancellations. Vinson saw this as a challenge to his authority, and on 1 June submitted his own resolution that the House Armed Services Committee be authorized to conduct an investigation into the procurement of the B-36. The House adopted Vinson&#x27;s resolution on 8 June.

The first phase of the House Armed Services Committee hearing and investigation on &quot;Unification and Strategy&quot; was held from 9 to 25 August 1949. The focus was on the allegations of fraud and corruption emanating from the Anonymous Document. The author of the &quot;anonymous document&quot; was determined to be Cedric R. Worth, a former Navy commander serving as a civilian assistant to Under Secretary of the Navy Dan A. Kimball. Worth was called as a witness and testified before the House Investigating Committee. The committee found no substance to charges of improper interest in aircraft procurement on the part of Johnson or Symington. The Air Force was exonerated of all charges of wrongdoing. At the conclusion, the committee recommended that Worth be fired. Following a naval court of inquiry, Worth was dismissed. The apparent vindication of Secretary Johnson and inappropriate work by Worth was an embarrassment to the Navy.

On hearing word of proposed cuts to the Navy budget, a naval aviator serving on the Joint Staff, Captain John G. Crommelin, called an impromptu press conference in which he claimed that unification had been a mistake, and that Johnson was out to destroy the Navy. Denfeld did not respond directly to Crommelin&#x27;s remarks, taking the position that naval officers were free to express their personal opinions. Matthews felt differently; he issued a statement to the effect that Crommelin&#x27;s actions rendered him unfit to continue serving on the Joint Staff. Accordingly, he was transferred to a billet on Denfeld&#x27;s staff normally held by a rear admiral. Matthews was furious, and Denfeld quickly moved Crommelin to a more junior post. Matthews and Denfeld then issued a guidance memorandum that stated that speeches and articles for public release had to be cleared through the Office of the Secretary of the Navy.

Matthews had requested advice from senior personnel on issues facing the Navy that might come up in hearings, so Bogan, now the Commander of the First Task Fleet in the Pacific, wrote to Matthews on 20 September to inform him of the state of morale in the Navy, which he described as &quot;lower today than at any time since I entered the commissioned ranks in 1916&quot;, and he expressed support for Crommelin&#x27;s views. The letter was confidential, but Radford, as CINCPAC, and Denfeld, as CNO, reviewed the letter as it was routed through official channels to Matthews&#x27;s office. In his endorsement, Denfeld concurred with the sentiments that Bogan expressed.

A second hearing convened in October focused upon the proposed reduction in the Navy and the cancellation of the &quot;United States&quot; and the soundness of the proposed expansion of the strategic bomber forces. They were given added urgency by Truman&#x27;s announcement on 23 September that the Soviet Union had tested its first nuclear device. Matthews announced that no Navy man would be censored or penalized for the testimony he offered at the hearing. This should have been unnecessary, since it was illegal to threaten witnesses testifying before Congress or to take action against them afterwards. Nonetheless, when Vinson opened the hearings on 6 October he declared: 
The naval officers called to testify were expected to support Secretary Matthews, but instead officer after officer arose to testify that the Air Force reliance on the B-36 was inadequate, and that the entire strategy of atomic bombing was immoral and misguided. Among the officers testifying from 6 to 17 October, were the naval leaders of World War II: Fleet Admirals Ernest King, Chester Nimitz and William Halsey, Admirals Raymond Spruance and Thomas Kinkaid, and General Alexander Vandegrift, the former Commandant of the Marine Corps. Burke had run tests which showed the Navy was already in possession of a fighter aircraft, the F2H Banshee, that could reach high enough altitudes to intercept bombers like the B-36, and he knew it would be unreasonable to assume that an opposing major world power would not also have developed such an aircraft. In that case, the B-36 would need to be accompanied with long-range fighter escorts with the requisite range and ceiling to complete its mission, and the Air Force had no such fighter available in their inventory. In his testimony, Denfeld broadly supported the Navy officers who had testified before him.

Symington and Vandenberg rebutted the admirals&#x27; testimony, point by point, on 18 and 19 October. Regarding the &quot;United States&quot;, Vandenberg commented: &quot;I accept the military capability of this ship as stated by the Chief of Naval Operations. My opposition to building it comes from the fact that I can see no necessity for a ship with those capabilities in any strategic plan against the one possible enemy.&quot; Symington denied that the Air Force favored the bombing of civilians or that it believed that an atomic blitz offered a &quot;quick, easy and painless war&quot;. Vandenberg testified that &quot;Veterans of the Eighth, the Fifteenth, the Twentieth and other historic Air Forces know very well that there are no cheap and easy ways to win great wars.&quot; He said that during World War II bombers had always managed to get through to their targets, and that technological improvements since then made it still more likely. He was optimistic in his testimony, although he had reason for concern, having received a memo from Major General Gordon P. Saville that only one B-36 had so far attempted a radar-controlled bombing run from .

The remainder of the testimony before the House Armed Services Committee was from former President Herbert Hoover, Johnson, and Generals of the Army George C. Marshall, Dwight Eisenhower and Omar Bradley on the merits of unification. Bradley noted that he had participated in the two largest amphibious operations in history, namely the invasions of Sicily and Normandy, and confidently predicted that &quot;large-scale amphibious operations, such as those in Sicily and Normandy, will never occur again&quot;. Bradley made no attempt to hide his contempt for the Navy&#x27;s methods during the case, and he accused senior naval officers of poor leadership and disloyalty: 
The House Armed Services Committee found a number of actions taken by the administration and by the services involved to be overstepping. It held that evaluation of the B-36&#x27;s worth was the responsibility of the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group, and that the services jointly should not pass judgment on weapons proposed by one service. On cancellation of the supercarrier, the committee questioned the qualifications of the Army and Air Force chiefs of staff, who had testified in support of Johnson&#x27;s decision, to determine vessels appropriate for the Navy. In disapproving of Johnson&#x27;s &quot;summary manner&quot; of terminating the carrier and his failure to consult congressional committees before acting, the committee stated that &quot;national defense is not strictly an executive department undertaking; it involves not only the Congress but the American people as a whole speaking through their Congress. The committee can in no way condone this manner of deciding public questions.&quot; The committee expressed solid support for effective unification, but stated that, &quot;there is such a thing as seeking too much unification too fast...&quot; and observed that &quot;...there has been a Navy reluctance in the inter-service marriage, an over-ardent Army, a somewhat exuberant Air Force ... It may well be stated that the committee finds no unification Puritans in [ the Pentagon ].&quot;

During the hearings public opinion shifted strongly against the Navy. &quot;Time&quot; magazine noted: &quot;Even so staunch a friend of the Navy as the &quot;New York Times&quot; Annapolis-trained military analyst Hanson Baldwin wrote that he himself did not consider the cutbacks in the Navy program disastrous. Baldwin added dryly: &#x27;Some of the Navy&#x27;s interest in morality as applied to strategic bombing seems new-found.&quot; The whole episode became known as the &quot;Revolt of the Admirals&quot;.

==Outcome==

===Command changes===
After the hearings, Secretary Matthews set about punishing those officers who had testified and were still actively serving in the Navy, in defiance of his own public promise not to do so. Denfeld was first to go; he was summarily relieved by Truman on what had been Navy Day, 27 October 1949. Matthews explained that he and Denfeld disagreed widely on strategic policy and unification. Denfeld retained his rank, and was offered the post of Commander in Chief of the Naval Forces in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, but he declined and elected to retire instead. Matthews selected Sherman as his new CNO. Bogan was given command of Fleet Air at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, a billet normally filled by a rear admiral. He too elected to retire rather than face assignment to a position of lesser authority. Crommelin continued to openly speak out and was forced into retirement by Sherman.
One of Sherman&#x27;s first actions as CNO was to disband OP-23, but not before the Naval Inspector General&#x27;s office seized all documents in search of evidence tying it to Crommelin&#x27;s disclosures or breaches of security. Matthews and Johnson attempted to block the promotion of Burke by crossing out his name on the promotion list, but this was seen and reversed by Truman. The House Armed Services Committee condemned Denfeld&#x27;s dismissal, concluding that:

The Truman administration won the conflict with the Navy, and civilian control over the military was reaffirmed. Military budgets following the hearings prioritized the development of Air Force heavy bomber designs. These were deployed across the country and at dozens of overseas bases. Frank Pace, who as Director of the Bureau of the Budget had been a driving force behind defense cuts, was appointed Secretary of the Army, and Leon Keyserling, a Keynesian economist, replaced Edwin Nourse as the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers when the latter quit over the administration&#x27;s failure to cut spending. 

Johnson authorized the modernisation of two &quot;Essex&quot;-class aircraft carriers, increasing the Navy&#x27;s projected aircraft carrier strength in fiscal year 1951 to seven, but a committee he established to look for further economies suggested another $929 million in cuts to the fiscal year 1950 budget, mainly at the expense of the Army and Navy budgets, which were cut by another $357 million and $376 million respectively. While most of Johnson&#x27;s cuts came at the expense of the Navy, it was the Army that was affected the most. After a year with Johnson at the helm, the Army had lost 100,000 men and only one of its ten divisions was at full strength. Truman still talked about cutting the defense budget to $9 billion. Unwilling to support further cuts, Symington submitted his resignation in April 1950.
===Korean War===

On 25 June 1950, the Korean War broke out and the administration was forced to confront the crisis with the forces it had on hand. The Truman administration immediately decided not to use the nuclear arsenal, and sought to check the North Korean advance with conventional forces. The war discredited the proponents of austerity and vindicated the hawks that had called for increased defense spending. As an initial response, Truman called for a naval blockade of North Korea, and was shocked to learn that such a blockade could only be imposed &quot;on paper&quot; since, as a result of the budget and force structure cuts he imposed on the Navy via Johnson and Matthews, the Navy no longer had the warships with which to carry out his request.

Faced with public criticism of his handling of the Korean War, which opened with a series of setbacks and defeats, and wishing to deflect blame from the peacetime defense economy measures he had espoused, Truman decided to ask for Johnson&#x27;s resignation on 19 September 1950. Truman decided he needed a Secretary of Defense that had the confidence of all three services, preferably one with significant military experience, and nominated George Marshall. Matthews resigned on 31 July 1951, and became the United States Ambassador to Ireland.

The Korean War compelled a reluctant Truman to loosen the purse strings. The administration did not decide between military and civilian spending; it found that it could afford both. No solution for interservice rivalry or any process for the resolution of competing budgetary claims emerged. Rivalry between the services was not ended; what ended was competition over a zero-sum budget. Defense outlays quadrupled between 1950 and 1953. In fiscal year 1951, the Army had double the manpower called for in Johnson&#x27;s budget; the Navy increased its carrier force from 15 to 27; and Air Force grew from 48 wings to 87. Fears of inflation proved unfounded; although it increased to 7.9 percent in 1951, it dropped back to below 1 percent the following year. Between 1954 and 2002, annual defense outlays averaged $317.7 billion in 2002 dollars, about 1.5 times the average between 1947 and 1950. Between 1948 and 1986, the Air Force&#x27;s share of the defense budget was 35 percent, the Navy&#x27;s 31 percent, and the Army&#x27;s 28 percent.

The Navy did get a supercarrier; Johnson approved its construction on 22 June 1950. Launched in October 1955, the , at was 1.5 times the size of the &quot;Midway&quot;-class aircraft carriers. She featured an armoured flight deck just large enough and sturdy enough to land a heavy bomber carrying a small nuclear bomb. The ship was also equipped with steam catapults to assist the heavier nuclear bombers in getting airborne. The flight deck was angled, allowing the new carrier to launch and recover aircraft at the same time, and obviating the need for a flush deck. The AJ Savages were mostly based ashore as its successor, the carrier-based all-jet A3D Skywarrior came on line. With the development of smaller and lighter nuclear weapons in the late 1950s, it also became possible for them to be carried by other standard Navy attack planes such as the A4D Skyhawk.

<doc id="827528" wikidata="Q568469" url="?curid=827528" title="Energy carrier">
<text>An energy carrier is a substance (fuel) or sometimes a phenomenon (energy system) that contains energy that can be later converted to other forms such as mechanical work or heat or to operate chemical or physical processes.

Such carriers include springs, electrical batteries, capacitors, pressurized air, dammed water, hydrogen, petroleum, coal, wood, and natural gas. An energy carrier does not produce energy; it simply contains energy imbued by another system.

==Definition according to ISO 13600==
According to ISO 13600, an energy carrier is either a substance or a phenomenon that can be used to produce mechanical work or heat or to operate chemical or physical processes. It is any system or substance that contains energy for conversion as usable energy later or somewhere else. This could be converted for use in, for example, an appliance or vehicle. Such carriers include springs, electrical batteries, capacitors, pressurized air, dammed water, hydrogen, petroleum, coal, wood, and natural gas.

ISO 13600 series (ISO 13600, ISO 13601, and ISO 13602) are intended to be used as tools to define, describe, analyse and compare technical energy systems (TES) at micro and macro levels:

*ISO 13600 (&quot;Technical energy systems — Basic concepts&quot;) covers basic definitions and terms needed to define and describe TESs in general and TESs of energyware supply and demand sectors in particular.
*ISO 13601 (&quot;Technical energy systems — Structure for analysis — Energyware supply and demand sectors&quot;) covers structures that shall be used to describe and analyse sub-sectors at the macro level of energyware supply and demand
*ISO 13602 (all parts) facilitates the description and analysis of any technical energy systems.

==Definition within the field of energetics==

In the field of energetics, an energy carrier is produced by human technology from a primary energy source. Only the energy sector uses primary energy sources. Other sectors of society use an energy carrier to perform useful activities (end-uses). The distinction between &quot;Energy Carriers&quot; (EC) and &quot;Primary Energy Sources&quot; (PES) is extremely important. An energy carrier can be more valuable (have a higher quality) than a primary energy source. For example 1 megajoule (MJ) of electricity produced by a hydroelectric plant is equivalent to 3 MJ of oil. Sunlight is a main source of primary energy, which can be transformed into plants and then into coal, oil and gas. Solar power and wind power are other derivatives of sunlight. Note that although coal, oil and natural gas are derived from sunlight, they are considered primary energy sources which are extracted from the earth (fossil fuels). Natural uranium is also a primary energy source extracted from the earth but does not come from the decomposition of organisms (mineral fuel).

<text>Chhattisgarh Mukti Morcha (lit. Chhattisgarh Liberation Front) is a political party in the Indian state of Chhattisgarh.

On 3 March 1977, the Chhattisgarh Mines Shramik Sangh (Chhattisgarh Mines Workers&#x27; Union) was founded by Shankar Guha Niyogi. In 1982, CMSS formed CMM as their political front. CMM was formed to fight for the cultural identity of the region and for the upliftment of the workers and peasants. CMM organized social campaigns, such as against alcohol abuse and instituted social projects, such as a workers&#x27; financed hospital.

Niyogi was murdered in Bhilai, in 1991. In the 1993 Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly election, CMM won 1 seat (Dondi Lohara).

In the legislative assembly elections in Chhattisgarh 2003 CMM had put up eight candidates, whom together mustered 37,335 votes.

<text>Alexander Mair Courage Jr. (December 10, 1919May 15, 2008) familiarly known as &quot;Sandy&quot; Courage, was an American orchestrator, arranger, and composer of music, primarily for television and film. He is best known as the composer of the theme music for the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series.

==Early life==
The son of a Scottish father and a French-American mother, Alexander &quot;Sandy&quot; Mair Courage was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His father Alexander Sr. immigrated to the United States in 1913 and obtained work in a munitions factory supplying France during World War I, where he met his future wife. They married in 1917.

While still a young child, his father joined the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company as a salesman and moved the family to New Jersey. The family relocated regularly as his father earned promotions, requiring Sandy to switch schools.

His gift for music was noticed and encouraged at an early age. Courage’s father arranged for young Sandy to learn the bugle as his own father had been in a band and he himself was an enthusiastic parlor singer. When Courage wanted to learn the cornet, his father got him one.

Courage developed an uncanny ear for accompaniment. His tendency to play by ear what he wanted rather than play the music as written was a source of frustration, as he recalled, for his piano instructors: “I wanted to play Sousa marches and things like that. My uncle had a boys’ camp [in] Pennsylvania… When I was twelve, a new camper came in named Bobby Brecker. He had been to New York with his parents and seen a show there called The Band Wagon with Fred Astaire and his sister Adele, and he knew all the songs... I learned how to pick out the tunes with one finger and play what then used to be called a graveyard bass, which had no chords, just a sort of “thump” with the fist in rhythm with whatever the tune was [in] your right hand... That’s really where I got my start as a show pianist and little did I know, that I would one day be writing arrangements for Fred Astaire in a movie called The Band Wagon. It’s really, really, really spooky in my life, how things like that have happened.”

==School==
Courage later learned to play the trumpet and the French horn as these instruments were available to him in school. In high school, Courage auditioned for and was chosen as the first solo player of the New Jersey All State High School Orchestra. Also in the orchestra was a violist for whom Courage was inspired to write a symphony, leading him to pursue music as a career.

Taking some preparatory theory lessons, Courage was admitted to the Eastman School of Music in 1937. He intended to study composition. Having never attempted it in a formal way before, Courage found the study challenging and failed his introductory composition course twice before passing the course in his senior year. While at Eastman, he switched majors multiple times and found the academic coursework ill-suited to his improvisational nature.

In early 1940, Serge Koussevitzky auditioned Eastman students to join the Tanglewood Music Festival that summer. Courage succeed in earning a spot at Tanglewood where he met Richard Bales, Lenny Bernstein, and Thor Johnson.

In 1941, Courage graduated Eastman with a degree in piano performance.

==Military Service==
Upon graduation, Courage moved to California to join a close friend Doris Atkinson who had graduated from Eastman a year earlier. He served in the United States Army Air Forces at March Field as a horn player, composer, arranger, and band leader. There, Courage launched and led a monthly radio program featuring band arrangements he wrote.

==Career==
Once out of the army, Courage lived with his parents while looking for work. Through the wife of an army buddy, Courage met Bill Hatch, who hired Courage to work for CBS Radio. Around the same time, Atkinson introduced Courage to Herb Spencer, who introduced him to Ed Powell, who was looking for an orchestrator to recommend to Adolph Deutsch. Through these connections, Courage wrote and arranged music for several radio shows before following Deutsch to MGM.

Courage began as an orchestrator and arranger, working on such films as the 1951 &quot;Show Boat&quot; (&quot;Life Upon the Wicked Stage&quot; number); &quot;Hot Rod Rumble&quot; (1957 film); &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; (&quot;I Guess I&#x27;ll Have to Change My Plan&quot;); &quot;Gigi&quot; (the can-can for the entrance of patrons at Maxim&#x27;s); and the barn raising dance from &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot;.

He frequently served as an orchestrator on films scored by André Previn (&quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, &quot;The Circus is a Wacky World&quot;, and &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Hear from Me&quot; production numbers for &quot;Inside Daisy Clover&quot;), Adolph Deutsch (&quot;Funny Face&quot;, &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;), John Williams (&quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, and the Academy Award-nominated musical films &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; and &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;), and Jerry Goldsmith (&quot;Rudy&quot;, &quot;Mulan&quot;, &quot;The Mummy&quot;, et al.). He also arranged the Leslie Bricusse score (along with Lionel Newman) for &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot; (1967).

Apart from his work as a respected orchestrator, Courage also contributed original dramatic scores to films, including two westerns: Arthur Penn&#x27;s &quot;The Left Handed Gun&quot; (1958) and André de Toth&#x27;s &quot;Day of the Outlaw&quot; (1959), and the Connie Francis comedy &quot;Follow the Boys&quot; (1963). He continued writing music for movies throughout the 1980s and 1990s, including the score for &quot;Superman IV: The Quest for Peace&quot; (1987), which incorporated three new musical themes by John Williams in addition to Courage&#x27;s adapted and original cues for the film. Courage&#x27;s score for &quot;Superman IV: The Quest for Peace&quot; was released on CD in early 2008 by the Film Music Monthly company as part of its boxed set &quot;Superman - The Music&quot;, while La-La Land Records released a fully expanded restoration of the score on May 8, 2018, as part of Superman&#x27;s 80th anniversary.

Courage also worked as a composer on such television shows as &quot;Daniel Boone&quot;, &quot;The Brothers Brannagan&quot;, &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, &quot;Eight Is Enough&quot;, &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;, and &quot;Judd, for the Defense&quot;, &quot;Young Dr. Kildare&quot; and &quot;The Brothers Brannagan&quot; were the only television series besides &quot;Star Trek&quot; for which he composed the main theme.

The composer Jerry Goldsmith and Courage teamed on the long-running television show &quot;The Waltons&quot; in which Goldsmith composed the theme and Courage the Aaron Copland-influenced incidental music. In 1988, Courage won an Emmy Award for his music direction on the special &quot;Julie Andrews: The Sound of Christmas&quot;. In the 1990s, Courage succeeded Arthur Morton as Goldsmith&#x27;s primary orchestrator.

Courage and Goldsmith collaborated again on orchestrations for Goldsmith&#x27;s score for the 1997 film &quot;The Edge.&quot;

Courage frequently collaborated with John Williams during the latter&#x27;s tenure with the Boston Pops Orchestra.

== Family ==
At the age of 35, Courage married Mareile Beate Odlum on October 6, 1955.

Mareile, born in Germany, was the daughter of Rudolf Wolff and Elisabeth Loechelt. After Wolff&#x27;s suicide Elisabeth married Carl Wilhelm Richard Hülsenbeck, renowned for his involvement in the Dada movement in Europe. Hülsenbeck brought his wife (Elisabeth), son (Tom) and step-daughter (Mareile) to the United States in 1938 to avoid the political situation rapidly developing in Europe. After arriving in the US he changed his last name to Hulbeck.

Mareile&#x27;s marriage to Courage was her third. Her second marriage was to Bruce Odlum (son of financier Floyd Odlum) in 1944. That union produced two sons, Christopher (1947) and Brian (1949). When Courage married Mareile he accepted the responsibility of acting stepfather to them. The family originally lived together on Erskine Drive in Pacific Palisades, but later moved to a mountainside home on Beverly Crest Drive in Beverly Hills.

Aside from his musical abilities Courage was also an avid and accomplished photographer. He took many dramatic photos of bullfights and auto racing. He was a racing enthusiast, and his interest in that sport and photography brought him into contact with many racing personalities of the era, notably Phil Hill and Stirling Moss, both of whom he considered friends. Moss paid at least one social visit to the Erskine residence.

Though a dedicated stepfather to Christopher and Brian, Courage&#x27;s musical career took precedence over his familial responsibilities. He sought to interest his step-children in music, and was responsible for arranging Brian&#x27;s first musical lessons, on alto saxophone. Later in life Brian became a composer of serious electronic music, though the vocation was not apparent during his childhood, as he was a poor saxophone student.

Alexander and Mareile were divorced April 1, 1963. Courage subsequently married Kristin M. Zethren on July 14, 1967. That marriage also ended in divorce in 1972.

==Star Trek theme ==
Courage is best known for writing the theme music for the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, and other music for that series. Courage was hired by &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry to score the original series at Jerry Goldsmith&#x27;s suggestion, after Goldsmith turned down the job. 

Courage went on to score incidental music for episodes &quot;The Man Trap&quot; and &quot;The Naked Time&quot; and some cues for &quot;Mudd&#x27;s Women.&quot;
Courage reportedly became alienated from Roddenberry when Roddenberry claimed half of the theme music royalties. Roddenberry wrote words for Courage&#x27;s theme, not because he expected the lyrics to be sung on television, but so that he (Roddenberry) could receive half of the royalties from the song by claiming credit as the composition&#x27;s co-writer. Courage was replaced by composer Fred Steiner who was then hired to write the musical scores for the remainder of the first season. 

After sound editors had difficulty finding the right effect, Courage himself made the &quot;whoosh&quot; sound heard while the Enterprise flies across the screen.

He returned to &quot;Star Trek&quot; to score two more episodes for the show&#x27;s third and final season, episodes &quot;The Enterprise Incident&quot; and &quot;Plato&#x27;s Stepchildren,&quot; allegedly as a courtesy to Producer Robert Justman.

Notably, after later serving as Goldsmith&#x27;s orchestrator, when Goldsmith composed the music for &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, Courage orchestrated Goldsmith&#x27;s adaptation of his original &quot;Star Trek&quot; theme.

Following &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, Courage&#x27;s iconic opening fanfare to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; theme became one of the franchise&#x27;s most famous and memorable musical cues. The fanfare has been used in multiple motion pictures and television series, notably &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; and the four feature films based upon that series, three of which were scored by Goldsmith.

==Death==
Courage had been in declining health for several years before he died on May 15, 2008, at the Sunrise assisted-living facility in Pacific Palisades, California. He had suffered a series of strokes prior to his death. His mausoleum is in Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery.

<doc id="827535" wikidata="Q29085" url="?curid=827535" title="Hayam Wuruk">
<text>Hayam Vuruk (Indonesian: &quot;Hayam Wuruk&quot;, Sanskrit: हयम् वुरुक्, Kawi: ꦲꦪꦩ꧀ꦮꦸꦫꦸꦏ꧀) (1334–1389), also called Rajasanagara, Pa-ta-na-pa-na-wu, or Bhatara Prabhu after 1350, was a Javanese Hindu emperor from the Rajasa dynasty and the 4th emperor of the Majapahit Empire. Together with his prime minister Gajah Mada, he reigned the empire at the time of its greatest power. During his reign, the Hindu epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, became ingrained in the culture and worldview of the Javanese through the &quot;wayang kulit&quot; (leather puppets). He was preceded by Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi, and succeeded by his son-in-law Wikramawardhana.

Most of the accounts of his life were taken from the &quot;Nagarakretagama&quot;, a eulogy to Hayam Wuruk, and the &quot;Pararaton&quot; (&quot;Book of Kings&quot;), a Javanese historical chronicle.

==Early life==

According to the &quot;Nagarakretagama&quot;, Canto 1, Stanzas 4 and 5, Hayam Wuruk was born in 1256 Saka year, corresponding to 1334 CE, the same year that Mount Kelud erupted. Mpu Prapanca, author of the &quot;Nagarakretagama&quot;, argued that this was the divine sign that &quot;Batara Girinata&quot; (the Javanese name for Shiva Mahadewa) had manifested himself on earth, reincarnated as the Javanese king.

Hayam Wuruk&#x27;s name can be translated as &quot;scholar rooster&quot;. He was the only son of Empress Tribhuwana Tunggadewi and Prince Kertawardhana (or Cakradhara). His mother was the daughter of Emperor Kertarajasa Jayawardhana, founder of Majapahit, while his father was the Duke of Tumapel &quot;&quot;Bhre&quot; Tumapel&quot;, a lesser king of Singhasari. During Queen Tribhuwana&#x27;s reigned, he was also called Kumararaja Jiwana which means Viceroy of Jiwana or Kahuripan. He had a younger sister, Princess Iswari, Duchess of Pajang. The Duchess of Pajang was mentioned as a daughter of Kertawardhana in Nagarakretagama, thus make it obvious that she was Hayam Wuruk&#x27;s biological sister. However, Nagarakretagama also mentioned another name as the younger sister of Hayam Wuruk even earlier than Iswari, she was Princess Indudevi, Duchess of Lasem and a daughter of Wijayarajasa. From this evidence, we can guess that Nagarakretagama&#x27;s writer means that Princess Indudevi was Hayam Wuruk&#x27;s younger cousin. In contrast, Pararaton said that Rajadevi and Wijayarajasa&#x27;s marriage didn&#x27;t produce any children.

Both the &quot;Pararaton&quot; and the &quot;Nagarakretagama&quot; praised Hayam Wuruk as a handsome, bright, talented, and exceptional student in the courtly martial arts of archery and fencing, who also mastered politics, scriptures, arts, and music. He was known as an accomplished ceremonial dancer in the court, and some accounts tell of his performances in the traditional ceremonial Javanese mask dance. His mother, Queen Tribhuwana, educated and groomed him to become the next monarch of Majapahit.

==Reign==

In 1350, Queen Dowager Gayatri died in her retirement at a Buddhist monastery. She was the primary consort of King Kertarajasa Jayawardhana, the first king of Majapahit, and also the grandmother of Hayam Wuruk. Queen Tribhuwana had to abdicate because she ruled Majapahit under Gayatri&#x27;s auspices, and was obliged to relinquish the throne to her son.

Prince Hayam Wuruk inherited the throne in 1350 at the age of 16 under his new regnal name Sri Rajasanagara Jayawishnuwardhana. At that time, &quot;mahapatih&quot; (prime minister) Gajah Mada was at the height of his career. Under his rule, Majapahit extended its power throughout the Indonesian archipelago of Nusantara.
In 1365 (1287 Saka year), Mpu Prapanca wrote the &quot;kakawin&quot; of Nagarakretagama, the old Javanese eulogy for King Hayam Wuruk. The manuscript described Hayam Wuruk&#x27;s royal excursion around the Majapahit realm to visit villages, holy shrines, vassal kingdoms, and territory in East Java. He sent ambassadors to China from 1370 to 1381.

According to the &quot;Pararaton&quot; and &quot;Kidung Sunda&quot;, in 1357, King Hayam Wuruk was expected to marry Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi, a daughter of King Linggabuana of the united Sunda Kingdom and Galuh Kingdom. She was described as a princess with extraordinary beauty, but the reason for this royal engagement was probably political, to foster the alliance between the Majapahit and the Sundanese Kingdoms. However, in the Bubat incident, the Sunda royal family and their guards were involved in a skirmish with Majapahit troops. The planned royal wedding ended in disaster with the death of the princess and the whole Sunda royal party. Pitaloka committed suicide at about 17 years old. The court officials blamed Gajah Mada, since he intended to demand submission from the Sunda Kingdom which ended in bloodshed.

After all, Hayam Wuruk married his relative, Paduka Sori. She was a daughter of Wijayarajasa by a concubine, making her a stepdaughter of Hayam Wuruk&#x27;s maternal aunt. Although all the king&#x27;s daughters and concubines were beautiful, Queen Sori was a beautiful one. She was linked as Susumna.

They had a daughter, Princess Kusumawardhani, who bestowed the title Princess of Kabalan. King Rajasanagara arranged for her to marry her cousin, Wikramawardhana, Prince of Mataram when he was no older than 12 and she was no older than 7 at that time. His mother was Hayam Wuruk&#x27;s sister, Princess Iswari. She was described as a perfect princess with beautiful eyes and slender arches, as well as praised because of her beauty. Upon Wikramawardhana&#x27;s reigned, she was mentioned as &quot;Bhre&quot; Lasem &quot;Sang Ahayu&quot; &quot;the Fair Princess of Lasem&quot; in Pararaton.

However, from a concubine, Hayam Wuruk had a son, the 2nd Prince of Wirabhumi (his birth name was unknown), granted the title from his marriage to his cousin, Nagarawardhani, 1st Princess of Wirabhumi (then she bore the title 2nd Princess of Lasem), also known as &quot;Bhre Lasem Sang Alemu&quot; &quot;The Fat Princess of Lasem&quot;.

After Hayam Wuruk died in 1389, and the empire fell into chaos and decline during the contest over succession between Wikramawardhana and Wirabhumi. The dispute ended in Wirabhumi&#x27;s defeat in the Regreg war. Wikramawardhana succeeded Hayam Wuruk as the King of Majapahit. 

==Legacy==

His reign, as part of Indosphere culturally, helped further Indianisation of Javanese culture through the spread of Hinduism and Sanskritization.

<text>Otto Neumann Knoph Sverdrup (31 October 1854, in Bindal Municipality in Helgeland – 26 November 1930) was a Norwegian sailor and Arctic explorer.

==Early and personal life==
He was born in Bindal Municipality as a son of farmer Ulrik Frederik Suhm Sverdrup (1833–1914) and his wife Petra Neumann Knoph (1831–1885). He was a great-grandnephew of Georg Sverdrup and Jacob Liv Borch Sverdrup, first cousin twice removed of Harald Ulrik and Johan Sverdrup, second cousin once removed of Jakob, Georg and Edvard Sverdrup, third cousin of Georg Johan, Jakob, Mimi, Leif and Harald Ulrik Sverdrup. He was a brother-in-law of Johan Vaaler, and Otto himself married his own first cousin, Gretha Andrea Engelschiøn (1866–1937), in October 1891 in Kristiania. Their daughter Audhild Sverdrup (1893–1932) married Carl Johan Sverdrup Marstrander.

His father was born on Buøy in Kolvereid Municipality. As oldest son Otto was heir to the Sverdrup properties at Buøy. However, he left it all to his younger brothers and went to Åbygda in Bindal, to the farm named Hårstad, where Otto Sverdrup was born. In 1872, at the age of 17, Otto Sverdrup returned to Nærøy Municipality, to Ottersøy where his uncle Søren worked in transportation with his own vessels. Here Sverdrup started his career as a seaman and after a while he was sailing abroad. In 1875, he passed his mate&#x27;s examination, and some years later the shipmaster&#x27;s examination.

In 1877 Sverdrup&#x27;s parents moved from Bindal to the farm Trana outside the town of Steinkjer. At this time O. T. Olsen, a teacher and employee in the bank at Kolvereid and a relative of his mother, had purchased the steamboat &quot;TRIO&quot;. Sverdrup was employed as captain. Around this time Sverdrup also met the lawyer Alexander Nansen who lived in the town of Namsos. He was the brother of Fridtjof Nansen and through him Sverdrup and Fridtjof Nansen learned to know each other.

==Career and expeditions==
Sverdrup joined Fridtjof Nansen&#x27;s expedition of 1888 across Greenland. In 1892 he was an advisor to Fridtjof Nansen when the ship &quot;Fram&quot; was built. In 1893 Sverdrup was given command of the ship, and in 1895 he was left in charge of it while Nansen attempted to reach the North Pole. Sverdrup managed to free the ship from the ice near Svalbard in August 1896 and sailed to Skjervøy, arriving just 4 days after Nansen had reached Norway.

In the summer of 1897 Sverdrup worked as the shipmaster of &quot;Lofoten&quot;, a passenger ship to and from Svalbard. In 1898 he embarked on another expedition with &quot;Fram&quot;. Sverdrup attempted to circumnavigate Greenland via Baffin Bay but failed to make it through the Nares Strait. Forced to overwinter on Ellesmere Island, he and his crew explored and named many uncharted fjords and peninsulas on the western shores of the island, explaining the Norwegian names, such as Hoved Island (&quot;main island&quot;) and Prince Gustav Adolf Sea (after the Swedish king Gustav VI Adolf) in the Canadian Arctic.

Between 1899 and 1902, he overwintered three more times on Ellesmere Island in the Canadian Arctic with the &quot;Fram&quot;, continuing to explore and map, culminating in the discovery of the islands to the west of Ellesmere Island, namely Axel Heiberg, Amund Ringnes and Ellef Ringnes, collectively known as the Sverdrup Islands. In adopting Inuit methods, Sverdrup and his crew were able to chart a total of 260,000 square kilometers - more than any other polar exploration. The area was famously mapped by his topographer, Gunnar Isachsen, and 35 academic publications were penned as a result of the expedition. Upon Sverdrup&#x27;s return in Norway, he was treated as a national hero. However, he remains relatively unknown in North America, and relatively unknown for his Canadian exploration in Norway.
Sverdrup officially claimed all three islands he discovered for Norway in 1902, setting off a sovereignty dispute with Canada, which claimed sovereignty over all land, discovered or undiscovered in what is now the Canadian Arctic. The dispute was not settled until 1930 when Norway ceded the islands to Canada. In that year Sverdrup signed a deal with the Canadian Government, who would buy the records of Sverdrup&#x27;s expeditions for $67,000 Canadian dollars. Sverdrup died just two weeks after the deal was signed, but the money secured the future of his family. The records were archived in the National Archives of Canada, but were later returned to the National Library of Norway.

One of Sverdrup&#x27;s lesser known exploits was a search-and-rescue expedition aboard ship &quot;Eklips&quot; in the Kara Sea in 1914–1915. His aim was to search for two missing Arctic expeditions, that of Captain Georgy Brusilov on the &quot;St. Anna&quot; and that of Vladimir Rusanov on the Gerkules. Sverdrup&#x27;s fourth and last expedition in Arctic Siberian waters was in 1921, when, from the bridge of the Soviet Icebreaker Lenin, he commanded a convoy of five cargo ships on an experimental run through the Kara Sea to the mouths of the Ob and Yenisei. The ships reached their destinations and returned safely. This was considered an important step in the development of the Kara Sea sector of the Northern Sea Route. Sverdrup also has an unsuccessful business venture in Cuba, a plantation project in the Oriente Province in 1904.

==Later life and legacy==

The last years of his life he lived in Sandvika, at the property Homewood on a hill overlooking the town. He died in November 1930. A statue of Sverdrup was erected in Steinkjer in 1957, and in 1999 a statue of Sverdrup was erected in Sandvika, in the square named after him, &quot;Otto Sverdrups plass&quot;. In 2008, the Royal Norwegian Navy commissioned the HNoMS Otto Sverdrup, a Nansen class frigate, in honor of the mariner and explorer.

He was made a Commander 1st Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1896, and promoted to Grand Cross in 1902. In addition, he was awarded gold medals from the Norwegian Geographical Society in 1889 and the Royal Geographical Society in 1903, and received an honorary degree at the University of St Andrews.

Sverdrup had also been made a Knight 1st Class of the Prussian Order of the Crown in 1902, but in an open letter to the German legation in Oslo on 25 October 1917 declared that he was returning the order in protest against the unrestricted warfare then being waged by the German U-boats in the First World War, causing the deaths of hundreds of Norwegian sailors. The day before Sverdrup&#x27;s return of his order, fellow explorer Roald Amundsen had also returned his German awards.

<doc id="827552" wikidata="Q3629946" url="?curid=827552" title="Austin Community College District">
<text>The Austin Community College District (ACC) is a public community college system serving the Austin, Texas, metropolitan area and surrounding Central Texas communities. The college maintains numerous campuses, centers, and distance learning options to serve about 100,000 students in academic, continuing education and adult education programs.

ACC offers associate degrees and career/technical certificate programs in more than 100 areas of study as well as four bachelor degree programs. Most courses taken within the district are meant to apply for associate degrees, which help students qualify for jobs or can be transferred to four-year institutions. ACC is the sixth largest community college system in the United States, and the fourth largest college in Texas.

==History==
In the 1960s, Austin residents and leaders discussed the possibility of establishing a community college for their growing city. The question was put to a vote repeatedly, but voters rejected the proposed taxpayer-supported college system in 1963, 1965 and 1968. In 1972, however, an alternative proposal that would allow the new college to be operated (and funded) by Austin Independent School District won a majority of voters&#x27; support. This plan meant that (at least initially) ACC would not levy any taxes on local residents to fund its operation, relying instead on state bodies such as the Texas College System Coordinating Board and the Texas Education Agency (as well as tuition and fees from students).

ACC received its accreditation from SACS in 1978. As the system&#x27;s student population grew, it quickly came to need more funding than its operation as a branch of AISD could provide. In 1981, the school administration petitioned voters in Travis County to make ACC a county-wide public college with its own taxing authority and to permit it to issue bonds to fund facility expansions and renovations. The initiative was initially rejected at the polls, but a similar measure was enacted in 1986, separating ACC from AISD and establishing its governing board and taxing authority.

===District and service area===

The system&#x27;s service area has grown steadily across its history as surrounding regions have agreed to be annexed into the tax district in return for in-district tuition for their residents. The ACC District now spans all or most of seven counties in Central Texas and parts of four more. As defined by the Texas Legislature, the official service area of ACC currently includes:
*Hays, Caldwell, and Blanco counties;
*Travis County, excepting the territory within the Marble Falls Independent School District;
*Williamson County, excepting the territory within the Florence, Granger, Hutto, Lexington, Taylor, and Thrall independent school districts;
*Bastrop County, excepting the territory within the Lexington Independent School District;
*the part of the San Marcos Consolidated Independent School District located in Guadalupe County;
*the part of the Elgin Independent School District located in Lee County; and
*the part of the Smithville Independent School District located in Fayette County.

==Campuses==
In the fall of 1973, the college held its first classes in the former Anderson High School building in east Austin, which ACC named its Ridgeview Campus. Evening classes were also held at several Austin public high schools. The Rio Grande Campus, the system&#x27;s second, was opened downtown in 1975 in the building recently vacated by Austin High School.

Over succeeding decades, the college added the Riverside Campus in the East Riverside neighborhood of southeast Austin, on the former site of the Austin Country Club (1984); the Northridge Campus on the northern edge of Travis County (1989); the Pinnacle Campus in Oak Hill in southwest Austin (1990); the Cypress Creek Campus in Cedar Park (1991); the Eastview Campus in east Austin (1999); the South Austin Campus (2006); the Round Rock Campus (2010); the Elgin Campus (2013); the Highland Campus, on the site of the closing Highland Mall in north Austin (2013); the Hays Campus in Kyle (2014); and the San Gabriel Campus in Leander (2018). The Ridgeview Campus closed in 1989, and Pinnacle closed in 2019. ACC&#x27;s administrative offices are located in north-central Austin.
==Administration==
ACC has a nine-member board of trustees whose members are elected by residents of the taxation district. Each member is elected at-large by the entire district and serves for a six-year term with no term limits. In addition to developing policies for the organization as a whole, the board is responsible for appointing the college chancellor, who then selects the rest of ACC&#x27;s administrative staff and directs the day-to-day operation of the college as its chief executive officer.

==Academics==
ACC offers associate degrees and certificates in more than 100 fields, as well as offering career and technical training programs, adult education/GED programs, and continuing education programs. The school also facilitates transfer of core curriculum credits to bachelor&#x27;s degree programs at four-year institutions; tuition costs for two years of study at ACC are significantly lower than those at major Texas public universities, leading many students complete basic course work at ACC before transferring as a way of reducing college costs. The college system and its degrees are accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. ACC also has an honors program which is intended to &quot;develop the ability and potential of highly motivated students.&quot;

In fall 2018, the college began offering registered nurses with the option to earn a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) from its RN-to-BSN Program. As of fall 2023, the college has added three more bachelor&#x27;s degrees in software development, manufacturing engineering technology and cybersecurity.

==Notable alumni==
*Brene Brown, author and therapist
*Alex Jones, radio host and conspiracy theorist
*Richard Linklater, film director
*Justin Tucker, professional football player

==Austin Community College television channel==

<doc id="827556" wikidata="Q2797513" url="?curid=827556" title="Sanam (dance)">
<text>Sanam, or senem, also written as sainaimu () in Chinese, is an ethnic music and dance widespread among the Uyghur people in the Chinese autonomous region of Xinjiang. It is commonly performed during weddings, festive occasions, and parties. The music normally starts slowly and gradually becomes faster, at which point the dances also become more vivid, especially at the end. 

==Sanam music==
Sanam music is a suite that ranged from six to thirteen songs played usually for dancing. It however may also be played as purely instrumental version by naghra-sunay bands. The songs start with a moderate four-beat dance rhythm and move gradually towards a faster four-beat. 

There are various types of sanam music, and the major oasis towns have their own distinctive vocal style and suite of songs. Often the name of the place is mentioned before the word &quot;sanam&quot; in local variations. 

==Sanam dance==
Dancers&#x27; movements include characteristic neck movements, and movements of elbows, eyes and fingers. The dancers may also improvise, following the tempo of the music. Each region may have its own distinctive dance.

Dancers and singers are separated.

<doc id="827557" wikidata="Q357435" url="?curid=827557" title="Sverker the Elder">
<text>Sverker the Elder (Old Swedish: &quot;Swærkir konongær gambli&quot;; c. 1100 - 25 December 1156), also known as Sverker I, was King of Sweden from about 1132 until his murder. Of non-royal descent, he founded the House of Sverker, the rulers of which alternated with the rival House of Erik over the next century.

==Origins==

Sverker was a wealthy landowner from Östergötland. According to the Västgöta Law (c. 1240), his father&#x27;s name was &quot;Cornube&quot;, but according to the Icelandic &quot;Skáldatal&quot;, his father&#x27;s name was &quot;Kol&quot;. A later pedigree has the filiation Kettil – Kol – Kornike (Cornube) – Sverker. He rose to power after the extinction of the House of Stenkil in the 1120s. The Danish prince Magnus Nielsen was acknowledged as king in Götaland for a while, although the extent of his actual power is not clear. However, Magnus&#x27;s involvement in the civil strife in his homeland gave opportunities for Sverker to act. According to the partial account of Saxo Grammaticus, &quot;the Swedes, when they heard that Magnus was busy with war in Denmark, took one of their fellow countrymen, a man of modest ancestry by the name of Sverker, as their king; not because they appreciated him in particular, but since they would not stand under the rule of a foreigner.&quot; From the order of events in Saxo&#x27;s chronicle, this took place in c. 1132.

==Consolidation of power==

It appears that Sverker was only slowly recognized by the various provinces of the kingdom. Norwegian sources speak of several separate actions taken by the elite of Västergötland in the 1130s, indicating a high degree of separatism. The jarl of Västergötland, Karl of Edsvära, settled the Norwegian-Geatish border with King Harald Gille in 1135 and is even termed &quot;king&quot; in a source. The same goes for the provinces around Lake Mälaren where Magnus still had adherents. Bishop Henrik of Sigtuna was expelled from Sweden and fell at the side of Magnus in the Battle of Fotevik in 1134. Sverker was acknowledged in the Mälaren provinces by 1135, when he received the Danish pretender Oluf Haraldsen, whom he supported in his quest for power in Skåne. At least by the 1140s the authority of Sverker was generally acknowledged in the loosely structured kingdom. The basis of his power was the central plain of Östergötland with the church of Kaga, Alvastra Abbey and Vreta Abbey as religious supporting sites.

Sverker took care to anchor his legitimacy through his marriage policy. According to the hostile account of Saxo Grammaticus, &quot;Niels [of Denmark] married Ulvhild from Norway ... Sverker sent envoys to her and asked for her love. Shortly afterwards, he clandestinely brought her from her husband and made her marry him&quot;. The outrageous behaviour of Sverker may be explained by the background of Ulvhild; she had previously been married to Inge II of Sweden, the last of the House of Stenkil, and therefore represented the influence and properties of the extinct dynasty. After the death of Ulvhild he married the widow of his old enemy Magnus the Strong, the Polish princess Richeza, presumably in an effort to bring over the last adherents of Magnus to his side. The marriage gave him control over Richeza&#x27;s daughter Sophia of Minsk, who was engaged with the future king Valdemar the Great of Denmark in 1154, and married him after Sverker&#x27;s death.

==Clerical policy==

Sverker based much of his royal authority on his patronage of the Church. The Cistercians were called in on the initiative of Queen Ulvhild and founded a number of abbeys: Alvastra in Östergötland, Varnhem in Västergötland, and Nydala in Småland. The king also strove to achieve Swedish ecclesiastic autonomy. The papal delegate Nicholas Breakspear toured Scandinavia in 1152 and was received by Sverker with great honours. During a meeting in Linköping, the installation of Peter&#x27;s pence (papal tax) for Sweden was probably decided. However, the plans of installing a Swedish archbishopric were stalled, according to Saxo since &quot;the Swedes and Geats could not agree what town and person was worthy of the dignity&quot;. Therefore, Nicholas Breakspear &quot;refused the quarreling parts this honour and did not endow these still religiously ignorant barbarians the highest clerical dignity&quot;. When he later on visited Denmark, Breakspear promised the archbishop of Lund the primacy over any future Swedish archbishop. This was later confirmed when Breakspear became pope under the name Hadrianus IV. An archbishopric was only installed in 1164 in the reign of Sverker&#x27;s son Karl Sverkersson.

==Foreign policy==

Swedish relations with the Russian principalities had been good for the past century or more, but in the reign of Sverker there was a turn towards enmity. According to a Russian chronicle, the newly founded Republic of Novgorod had its first confrontation with Sweden at this time, breaking a century-long peace that had been guaranteed by marriages between the ruling families. The Swedish &quot;knyaz&quot; (Russian for ruling prince) and bishop arrived in the Finnish Gulf with 60 boats in 1142, and made an abortive attack on a fleet of traders. The further circumstances of the expedition are entirely lacking; it may have aimed to subdue non-Christian peoples east of the Baltic Sea.

A more serious confrontation took place in another direction in the 1150s. Sverker received his stepson, the Danish co-ruler Canute V when the latter was in trouble at home. This support was a threat to Canute&#x27;s rival, Sweyn III of Denmark. Moreover, Sverker&#x27;s son Johan abducted two noblewomen in Halland in Denmark &quot;in order to satisfy his lust&quot;, although his father and the people forced him to eventually return the ladies. Nicholas Breakspear tried in vain to dissuade King Sweyn from invading Sweden, since &quot;the land was difficult for waging warfare and the people were poor, so there was no advantage to seek there.&quot; However, Sweyn believed it was the right moment to strike, since Prince John had been slain by the peasantry at a Thing and, as a result, a conflict arose between them and Sverker. Moreover, Sverker was by now an old man with little taste for war.

King Sweyn proceeded to lead an expedition into the forested province Småland in southern Sweden in 1153, with the professed aim to subjugate Sweden. Sverker kept passive and did not meet the invaders in open battle, but the local populations resisted furiously and ambushed the Danes where they could. The war was fought in the cold of the winter; a large part of the horses of the invaders died from exhaustion and lack of fodder. Although the inhabitants of Värend submitted, Sweyn was forced to sneak back to Denmark in early 1154. Part of the army returned via Finnveden whose peasantry invited the soldiers to a feast, then assaulted and massacred them. The incident might have inspired the 17th-century local legend of Blenda.

The war thus abruptly came to an end, and did not stop Sverker&#x27;s association with Canute V. Sweyn III had hitherto been closely allied with the other Danish pretender Valdemar, the future King Valdemar the Great, but the latter was now drawn to Canute&#x27;s side. Realizing the adverse attitude of Sweyn, Canute and Valdemar visited Sverker in 1154 with an eye to a marriage alliance. According to the probably exaggerated account of Saxo, &quot;Sverker received them so friendly, that he, hoping for a future son-in-law, offered to make them his heirs while passing over his own children, either because of the incompetence of his sons or the high birth of the distinguished wooer.&quot; Thus Canute V was betrothed to his host&#x27;s daughter Helena. It also appears that Canute as well as Valdemar owned landed property in Sweden at the time. With the alliance with Sverker in their back, the two pretenders were able to attack Sweyn III successfully in the same year.

==The assassination of Sverker==

The short chronicle of the Västgöta Law says that Sverker was murdered in his own coach at the Alebäck bridge near Alvastra priory, going to the early religious service on Christmas Day, 1156. The assassin was his trusted servant, a detail that is confirmed by a papal letter. This was considered a shocking crime, even by medieval standards. According to Saxo, the pretender Magnus Henriksen, a Danish prince, &quot;made the servant commit this murder out of clandestine desire to become king&quot;. Sverker was succeeded in parts of Sweden by a pretender from another family, Eric the Saint, under very obscure circumstances. However, Sverker&#x27;s son Karl Sverkersson emerged as king in Östergötland by c. 1158.

&quot;Skáldatal&quot; reports the names of two of Sverker&#x27;s skalds: Einarr Skúlason and Halldórr skvaldri.

==Family==
By first wife Queen Ulvhild Håkansdotter, widow of Inge the Younger, and who escaped from her second husband, King Niels of Denmark: 
* Son Johan or Jon Jarl, slain by enraged peasants during a meeting of the Thing in the early 1150s, possibly father of Cecilia

* Daughter Helena of Sweden (uncertain name), married to Canute V of Denmark, son of King Magnus Nielsen
By second wife Queen Richeza (after Ulvhild&#x27;s death), previously married to Magnus Nielsen and to Volodar of Minsk. Attested son of this marriage was:
* Son Boleslaw, possibly identical with Burislev.
By one of these queens or an unknown woman:
* Allegedly a son Sune, thought to have been born about 1154.

<doc id="827559" wikidata="Q2528846" url="?curid=827559" title="Sturm Brightblade">
<text>Sturm Brightblade is a fictional character from the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; series of role playing games and novels, based on the &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; franchise. The character was created by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman and is published by Wizards of the Coast.

The knight Sturm Brightblade is one of the six Heroes of the Lance. Sturm appeared in the first novel of the Chronicles Trilogy, &quot;Dragons of Autumn Twilight&quot; (1984). As with the other main characters of the trilogy, Sturm&#x27;s proper creation was during a role-playing game session where Tracy Hickman, Laura Hickman, Margaret Weis, and Terry Phillips, between others, developed the guidelines and main story for the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; setting.

==Appearances==
Although Sturm Brightblade is introduced by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman in &quot;Dragons of Autumn Twilight&quot; (1984), this and the other core Dragonlance novels do not cover his childhood. However, in 1987, the year of Love and War&#x27;s first publication, Tonya R. Carter and Paul B. Thompson finally cover his childhood in a short story.

We see Sturm again as an adult in &quot;Dragons of Autumn Twilight&quot; (1984) by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman as a typical paladin of the D&amp;D type. Sturm soon meets Caramon Majere, Tanis Half-Elven and Raistlin Majere, revealing to them that his ancient suit of armor (later receives his blade as well) is all he has from his father, thus the greatest pride of his life.

In the second novel of the &quot;Chronicles&quot; series, &quot;Dragons of Winter Night&quot; (1985), written by the same authors, Sturm Brightblade becomes a more active member of the Companions, as he helps recover a Dragon Orb, an ancient magical artifact able to control dragons. At the end of the novel he sacrifices himself to allow the defeat of the enemy army, ending his participation in the series.

Paul B. Thompson and Tonya C. Cook&#x27;s novel, &quot;Darkness and Light&quot; (1989) featured Sturm Brightblade and Kitiara uth Matar, working together to reach Solamnia, as Sturm travels to seek news about his father; the pair eventually admit that they are attracted to one another. This travel would be used as a background for Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman&#x27;s short story &quot;Kitiara&#x27;s son&quot;, published in &quot;The Second Generation&quot; (1995), with an already dead Sturm, in which the authors reveal that Kitiara had in fact seduced Sturm during their travels together, seeking to corrupt him after Sturm had repeatedly berated her for her unscrupulous ways. Unknown to Sturm, Kitiara later bore him a son named Steel Brightblade.

Michael Williams&#x27;s novel &quot;The Oath and the Measure&quot; (1992), fourth in The Meetings Sextet series, gives more information about Sturm&#x27;s father during Sturm&#x27;s quest to meet &quot;Lord Wilderness&quot;, Lord Vertumnus, the only person who informs the true story about the Brightblade castle&#x27;s fall and his father&#x27;s death.
At the end of the novel, Sturm is formally accepted as a Squire of the Knights of Solamnia.

Several books mention Sturm&#x27;s mother, Anna Brightblade. Margaret Weis in the novel &quot;The Soulforge&quot; (1998), reveals how she died when a plague struck Solace, while feeding the poor and tending the sick as written by the Oath and the Measure, the code of conduct every knight must fulfill.
This marks a turning event in Sturm&#x27;s life as, not bound by an earlier promise to protect his mother anymore, he decides to travel to Solamnia to discover his father&#x27;s whereabouts.

==Importance in &quot;Dragonlance&quot;==
Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman had decided, since the conception of the &quot;Chronicles Trilogy&quot;, that Sturm&#x27;s appearances would end before any of the other characters, as explained by the authors:
According to the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; timeline defined by the authors, the Knights of Solamnia were an association of honorable knights fell in disgrace
as the regular citizens of the fictional world of Krynn blamed them for not being able to stop the Cataclysm,
the event in which the Krynnish gods threw a fiery meteor against the world to punish its inhabitants for their pride.
The authors determined that Sturm Brightblade, technically a Squire, a knighthood member who is learning the codes and skills needed to be knighted, would restore the honor of the Knights of Solamnia by sacrificing himself during a battle against the Dragonarmies of Ansalon, armies supporting Takhisis, the goddess of darkness.

The decision is hinted during the first book of the trilogy, &quot;Dragons of Autumn Twilight&quot; (1984), when the group of friends meet the &quot;Forestmaster&quot;, the unicorn protecting the mysterious Darken Woods, with the paragraph:
Weis and Hickman had explained, throughout the first two books of the &quot;Chronicles&quot; series, that a number of factions divided the Knights of Solamnia, making them unable to take decisions to prevent the spread of the invasion by the Dragonarmies of Ansalon, successfully describing a world where hope was almost nonexistent. However, by using his sacrifice, they were able to put an end to the internal quarrels of the association, turning it into the only armed organization able to stop the forces of evil. Sturm is killed by Kitiara while defending Solamnia.

In &quot;The Annotated Chronicles&quot; (1999), Hickman reveals that, while working with the story, he came across a Norse legend in which a king, while standing in the battlements of his fortress, saw an arrow coming his way. A vision flashed in the king&#x27;s mind, informing the arrow would kill him but, because of it, his warriors would fight courageously until winning the battle. This story was used as inspiration for Sturm&#x27;s final battle.

Although the authors &quot;had foreshadowed his death through two books,&quot;
the character&#x27;s end caused an uproar between fans which surprised the authors, Weis explains in the &quot;Annotated Chronicles,&quot; to the point of being accused of &quot;not caring&quot; about Sturm. In this book, however, both state they cried while writing the scene.

Books refer to Sturm Brightblade as a major hero of the Knights of Solamnia, at the same level of Vinas Solamnus, founder of the knighthood, and Huma Dragonbane, who defeated Takhisis in the final battle at the end of the Age of Dreams. In &quot;Dragons of a Lost Star&quot; (2002), the second book of the War of Souls trilogy, Weis and Hickman write that Laurana Kanan, Queen Mother of the Qualinesti elves, prayed to Sturm moments before confronting Beryllinthranox, the green dragon overlord,
while in Jeff Crook&#x27;s &quot;The Rose and the Skull&quot; (1999), Crysania of Tarinius, head of Paladine&#x27;s church, name him along with the two previously mentioned heroes.

The character has a major role in the development of another &quot;Dragonlance&quot; character, Steel Brightblade, as described by Weis and Hickman in &quot;The Second Generation&quot;
and &quot;Dragons of Summer Flame&quot; (1995).

==Characteristics==
The type of weapon Sturm carries is a two-handed sword, although much of the artwork depicting Sturm, as well as the figurine released by Ral Partha in the &quot;Heroes of the Lance&quot; miniatures box set, show him carrying a one handed sword. And in &quot;Dragons of Autumn Twilight&quot; it is described as a &quot;...splendid, if old-fashioned, two-handed sword&quot;. Later &quot;Dragonlance&quot; supplements name the weapon as the &quot;Brightblade&quot;. It is inscribed with runes of friendship that give the sword&#x27;s wielder a bonus to charisma checks. It is also said that the sword will not break unless its owner breaks first, strongly implying that as long as the wielder remains strong in the face of adversity, staying resolute and not breaking either in fear or principle, the weapon will never break. Later Steel Brightblade, a Knight of Takhisis, uses his father&#x27;s sword, the Brightblade, in the Chaos War.

Sturm&#x27;s long, thick mustaches, the age-old symbols of the Solamnic Knights, are a source of pride. His armor is old, dating &quot;almost back to the Cataclysm&quot;, and all that is left of his inheritance. Raistlin revealed to Steel that he could not stand Sturm, who was always preaching, always telling the &#x27;correct&#x27; course of action. Raistlin told the young man, however, that he liked Sturm better after he discovered the man was only made a knight shortly before his death, that Sturm had all his life been living by a code to which he was not bound—a code that many so-called true Solamnic Knights were only playing lip service to. In Raistlin&#x27;s opinion, Sturm had been a true knight his entire life.

==Reception==
Lauren Davis of io9 called Sturm a &quot;would-be knight who masks his insecurities behind a strict code of honor&quot;, and commented that his flaws make him human and let readers recognize who he is: &quot;an ordinary man who just means to do the right thing&quot;.

Jeff Gerke called Sturm a great example of &quot;The Principled Hero&quot;. Describing Sturm&#x27;s actions as &quot;maddening&quot; to his compatriots, Gerke went on to write, &quot;while people might object to Sturm&#x27;s internal code of conduct, it was impossible not to like the man.&quot; Gerke argued that Sturm&#x27;s strong code of ethics makes him a character with whom the reader can connect, whether or not the reader agrees with his decisions. Montse Sant in her work &quot;The Book of the Dragon&quot; called Sturm &quot;the brave noble&quot;.

In the &quot;Io9&quot; series revisiting older &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; novels, Rob Bricken commented that &quot;A Knight of Solamnia, much like Huma, except the Knights are now despised because they couldn&#x27;t stop the Cataclysm from happening, which seems rather unfair. This might be why Sturm is frequently depressed, sometimes to the point he&#x27;s nearly catatonic. Been there, Sturm!&quot; Bricken commented that in &quot;Dragons of Winter Night&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s [...] satisfying for Sturm to have things to do in addition to brooding, such as when he&#x27;s unwillingly caught in the political machinations of the Knights and forced to watch Derek lead most of them away in a failed suicide charge against the armies of Takhisis. Then he has to lead his few remaining soldiers to hold a tower against three blue dragons and a High Lord.&quot;

==Other media==

===Video games===
Sturm appears as one of the player characters in &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Heroes of the Lance&quot;.

===Miniature figures===
Sturm was included in Ral Partha&#x27;s &quot;Dragonlance Heroes&quot; boxed figures set of lead miniatures. A reviewer for &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine felt that Ral Partha successfully matched their figures to the descriptions of the characters in the novels, and described his figure: &quot;Sturm is a typical example of a knight or high-level fighter. He is dressed from neck to boots in a chain-mail shirt and leggings. The boots are heavy leather with plates protecting the front of the ankles and shins. Plate also protects his thighs and shoulders, with an ornate breastplate and groin protector. He is wearing an engraved horned helmet, and he has a stern look that is backed up by his raised runesword. Leather gauntlets protect both hands, and a plain shield is on his left arm. This shield has no engraving on it to match the illustration on the box. I recommend that you get a magnifying glass and carefully trace out a design on another sheet of paper before attempting the shield freehand.&quot;

===&quot;Dragonlance&quot; movie===
Sturm featured in the direct-to-video movie &quot;&quot;. He was voiced by Marc Worden. Worden said he enjoyed the experience of playing Sturm, calling him &quot;a tragic hero, a committed, and valiant knight&quot;.

<text>Tasslehoff Burrfoot (often called Tas) is a fictional character of the kender race from the Dragonlance series of novels, written by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. He was born in Kendermore. His parents are unknown and he has few known relatives. He has a sister, and also claims (like many other kender) to have an Uncle Trapspringer. He has three uncles, by the names of Remo Lockpick, Bertie, and Wilfre. He also has a cousin, Latchlifter Furrfoot.

==Publication history==
&quot;Dragon&quot; magazine published a series of stories introducing members of the Heroes of the Lance, to preview Dragonlance; &quot;A Stone&#x27;s Throw Away&quot; in &quot;Dragon&quot; #85 (May 1984) was the second of these, and is a story about Tasslehoff.

In the novel &quot;Kendermore&quot;, Tasslehoff is &quot;collared by a lady bounty hunter and charged with violating the kender laws of prearranged marriage. To ensure his return, Kendermore&#x27;s council has his Uncle Trapspringer in prison. Tas meets the last woolly mammoth and an alchemist who wants to pickle one of everything, including one kender. What no one knows is that the Dark Queen is inciting the riots in Kendermore as part of her plan for the battle of good versus evil.&quot;

==Early life==
Tasslehoff developed a passion for maps early on. He collected them and posted them all over the walls of his room. However, when he drew maps, his short patience led him to draw them inaccurately and make up names for certain places on Ansalon. While he often stole things, he always claimed he wasn&#x27;t a thief, often saying he was just borrowing the objects in question. This is a behaviour typical to kender, who as a species steadfastly, and with some indignation, maintain they do not steal, but &quot;find&quot; things that &quot;just happen&quot; to have been left out, or fallen into their pouches.

He traveled to Solace and found a ring dropped by a thief, which he dubbed &quot;Tas&#x27;s Ring of Teleportation&quot;. With this ring, he traveled all across Krynn, ending up at Magus&#x27;s Tower where he aided Demogorgon in an attempt to stop Magus from using demons. When he departed, he left Magus in the care of the Prince of Demons.

During Tas&#x27;s travels outside of Solace, he encountered Tanis Half-Elven and Flint Fireforge. He asked to be their friends; they declined. Tas, upon leaving Solace, acquired a bracelet that Flint made for Selena Sonluanaau. This bracelet saved Tas from a spider, and a merchant as well. When Tanis and Flint came to collect the bracelet Tas no longer had it. Selena arrived and charged them with finding the bracelet. They set off immediately, but were waylaid by satyrs, who made them stop, dance, and drink while the satyrs played music for a whole day. Upon arriving in Tantallon, Flint and Tanis were captured by the local Lord. Selena and Tas took a polymorph potion that turned them into birds to get into the castle, then they became mice to retrieve the bracelet. They freed Tanis and Flint, the bracelet was returned to Selena, and Tas left with Flint and Tanis.

Tasslehoff then joined the remaining Companions and they began adventuring. Flint nearly drowned at one point, and Tas helped to get him ashore. When Tas was on a quest for a special herb that Raistlin needed, along with Sturm and Caramon, he was captured by minotaurs.

Tasslehoff also appeared in the &quot;Legends Trilogy&quot; as a character to retrieve Caramon from his drunken stupor.

==Back to Kendermore==
When the companions separated, Tas had no intention of leaving his friends but a bounty hunter (who was a beautiful dwarven woman, and was later killed by the half-orc Denzil) came to arrest him and bring him back to Kendermore. She did this because he had to marry a kender named Damaris Metwinger (who was the mayor&#x27;s daughter). His journey to Kendermore was forced upon him, by saying that his Uncle Trapspringer was arrested until Tas will come and marry. On the way Tas was kidnapped by two Gnomes, whose Life-Quest was to stuff one of every creature alive. He was rescued by a Woolly Mammoth he released (this later prompted endless stories he told to the other Heroes of the Lance, whether they wanted to hear them or not). He was then kidnapped by a half-orc named Denzil, who needed a map of Tas&#x27; to find a treasure located in The Ruins. The Ruins were the remnants of a city lost during the time of the Cataclysm, located just outside the kender city, Kendermore. When Tas reached The Ruins, he was captured by a friendly ogre. The ogre&#x27;s lair was underneath one of the abandoned Towers of High Sorcery. In the Tower of High Sorcery he entered a dimension. The dimension where his Uncle Trapspringer and Damaris were on that anything and everything was edible. They escaped, along with the other kender caught there. Takhisis, finding an open portal, tried to enter the world, but they closed the portal before she could enter. In revenge, she asked her son, Nuitari, the god of dark magic, to cause natural disasters on Kendermore. When Tas and the rest of the kenders saved from the alternate dimension arrived in Kendermore, it was burning. However, thanks to Tas&#x27; leadership, they extinguished the fire. At the end Damaris decided to marry Trapspringer, thus freeing Tas from his obligation.

==War of the Lance==
Tasslehoff helps his companions on many occasions during the war, mainly through his fearlessness and curiosity. While normally a nuisance, these qualities often help the Companions as well. Tasslehoff takes his part in the war by riding a dragon with Flint during one of the final battles. He is delighted at the chance of flying dragons and get excited easily, even in dangerous and deadly situations. During the War of the Lance, Tasslehoff has numerous near-death experiences. In a draconian army encampment, he nearly dies in a burning wicker dragon. In the city of Tarsis the Beautiful, he nearly dies when a burning building falls on him. In the Temple of the Dark Queen in Neraka, Tasslehoff is poisoned by a trap sprung by a picked lock. He is later healed by Raistlin Majere.

Paladine, leader of the white pantheon of gods in Dragonlance and brother to Takhisis, becomes mortal and takes the form of a wizard named Fizban, who is very fond of kenders in general and Tasslehoff in particular, with the two developing a father and son relationship.

==After the war==
After the war Tasslehoff splits up with the other Companions of the Lance, with the intention of going back to Kendermore. He went on to tell them the tale of how the kender killed a Dragon Highlord named Fewmaster Toede. Before leaving he told the companions that kenders would go down in Krynnish lore. The companions had to refrain from telling Tas that Fewmaster Toede was a hobgoblin with little more intelligence than a Gully Dwarf.

==Legends==
Tasslehoff was sent by Tika Majere to help Caramon escort a cleric of Paladine, Crysania to the tower of High Sorcery. Anxious to keep his promise to protect Caramon and not miss out on any adventures, Tasslehoff, having been transformed into a mouse, manages to sneak into the laboratory of the great Par Salian, leader of the white robed magicians of Good, as he is casting the time traveling spell. Tasslehoff runs into the middle of the spell and gets transported back in time with Caramon. Since the creation of Kender was accidental, Kender possessed the ability to alter the flow of time. Through Tasslehoff&#x27;s interference, Raistlin (as Fistandantilus) is able to change the past and successfully enter the Abyss to challenge Takhisis along with the Paladine cleric Crysania. Caramon and Tas, traveling back in time, end up in 358 instead of 356, discovering an alternate time line in which Raistlin has become a god, and the world is going to end. Armed with this knowledge, they go back in time again to 356, planning to stop Raistlin. Caramon orders Tas to save Tanis. Tas, knowing that Caramon will die if he tries to enters the Shoikan Grove, saves Tanis, and with his help, Tas saves Caramon. He then helps them when they capture the Flying Citadel, and controls it until the end of the war, when he gives it to Rounce. After hearing Crysania&#x27;s eulogy for Elistan, he leaves to Tanis&#x27; castle with Tanis and Caramon.

==Chaos War==
In order to force Chaos to part or remain on Krynn, the gods needed Chaos&#x27; blood, and so, at the end of the Chaos War Tasslehoff insulted Chaos, making the deity careless. Tasslehoff then ran up and stabbed Chaos in his big toe with a magical knife Caramon Majere had dubbed &quot;Rabbitslayer&quot;. The resulting spurt of blood was enough of Chaos&#x27; essence to be used to force the deity into a choice—stay in the world and be forced to continually control himself (which Chaos had little patience for), or leave. Chaos decided to leave, but while he was leaving, he stomped on Tasslehoff, seemingly killing him, but leaving his items.

==War of Souls==
Before Tasslehoff was killed by Chaos, he used the magical time traveling device to go forward in time to speak at Caramon&#x27;s funeral. The first time he attempted to attend the funeral, he arrived too late. On another attempt at arriving at the correct time, he managed to speak briefly. After this event, Tasslehoff went back, unintentionally, to a different time and participated in the War of Souls. There he met the knight Gerard, and the two embarked on a journey to Qualinesti to find the mage Palin Majere before separating. The third timeline he ever entered was the only one in which the Great Dragons reached Ansalon. By simply existing in this timeline that wasn&#x27;t his own he was a danger to Takhisis. He was proof that her power wasn&#x27;t absolute and inspired some individuals. Moreover, if he was slain in a time not his own, the result would be oblivion. Thus, he was unsuccessfully hunted by the Dark Knight, Mina. He was trapped for a time in the tower of high sorcery with the mages Palin and Dalamar, both of which wanted to send him back to die by using the Device of Time Journeying. However, the device had been broken earlier. Since he did not want to die, he fled with the device, which was later fixed by the gnome Conundrum. He traveled through several various times throughout history before he returned to the war of souls. Shortly after, he helped Gerard, Odila, and Mirror to free the metallic dragons from their prison. After this he agreed to go back in time and get stepped on by Chaos, as he was supposed to, thus returning to his normal time-stream. As he was leaving, he reminded Gerard that the lock on his tomb (which he had picklocked), was broken and needed repair.

Coincidentally, many kender claim to have an &quot;Uncle Tas&quot; during the Fifth Age.

==Personality==
Tas, like all kender of the Dragonlance series, could be compared to a 5-year-old child; he is utterly irresponsible in any task that is not of the utmost importance, and often takes things that do not belong to him, which to a kender is &quot;borrowing&quot; and not stealing. Kender do not consider themselves to be thieves, and can become quite indignant when accused of stealing. They believe in sharing all that they have, and a common custom between two kender is to dump the entire contents of their pouches and exchange things. To kender, a family heirloom is something that has been in their possession for more than three weeks.

Kender also have a trait called &quot;Taunting&quot;, by insulting their opponents to the point of enraging them to killing intent, and thus lowering their accuracy in attacking but increasing their strength as a result. This is especially shown during Chronicles Book 2: &quot;Dragons of Winter Night&quot; when the companions were tied up and escorted to the mayor and while walking the street under the jeering of the crowd, Tas, as the master of taunting, managed to enrage the crowd into a riot and managed to be saved by the knights on covert mission in the chaos.

Like all kender, Tas hated being bored, and on the occasion that he was, he was known to begin talking about meaningless things to anyone who would listen.

Like all kender, Tas is completely without fear for himself. However, Tas is different from other kender in that he does know fear, not for himself, but for the people that he cares about. He is even immune to dragonfear, except that caused by the great dragons of the fourth age, but the Shoikan Grove&#x27;s piercing aura of fear managed to break through and affect him, though he did not recognize the feeling. The Death Knight, Lord Soth, gave him the same feeling. He is also fiercely loyal to his friends, has enough sense (largely thanks to lecturing from Tanis Half-Elven) to avoid overly dangerous situations, and above all, has a conscience in the form of Flint Fireforge&#x27;s voice.

Displays of this fear can be found in the books:
&lt;BR&gt;Chronicles Trilogy&lt;BR&gt;
&quot;Dragons of Autumn Twilight&quot;&lt;BR&gt;
&quot;Dragons of Winter Night&quot;&lt;BR&gt;
&quot;Dragons of Spring Dawning&quot;&lt;BR&gt;
&quot;Dragons of Summer Flame&quot;

&lt;BR&gt;War of Souls Trilogy&lt;BR&gt;
&quot;Dragons of a Fallen Sun&quot;&lt;BR&gt;
&quot;Dragons of a Lost Star&quot;&lt;BR&gt;
&quot;Dragons of a Vanished Moon&quot;

==Appearance==
Tasslehoff is often described as resembling a twelve-year-old child; he is of that general height and build. His face has many wrinkles that appear whenever he smiles, which is often. His clothes are always described as colorful, comfortable, and utterly unmatching. His most famous article of clothing was his fur-lined vest, worn through much of the War of Lance. Like all of his race, he carries a good number of pouches, which he never takes off, except just prior to his death at the hands of Chaos, so that he could run faster. See Chaos War. Also like all of his race, he has a ludicrously large topknot, which is to a kender what a beard is to a dwarf. His hair is brown as are his eyes. He also embodies the statement in many of the novels, the two most dangerous things in all of Krynn is to hear a Kender say &quot;oops&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m bored.&quot;.

==Other media==
===Video games===
Tasslehoff appears as one of the player characters in &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Heroes of the Lance&quot;.

Tasslehoff also appears as a player character in &quot;Dragons of Flame&quot;, where one reviewer describes him as &quot;a rather fat mamma with ginormous ears&quot;.

===Miniature figures===
Tasslehoff was included in Ral Partha&#x27;s &quot;Dragonlance Heroes&quot; boxed figures set of lead miniatures. A reviewer for &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine felt that Ral Partha successfully matched their figures to the descriptions of the characters in the novels, and described his figure: &quot;Tasslehoff stands at the ready, with a sling in his left hand and a rock in his right. He is clothed in simple pants and buckle boots, and is wearing a sleeveless fur coat. His face has a look of foreboding. His hair is pulled back into a topknot that flows down his back. He is also carrying water containers and provisions on his belt.&quot;

===&quot;Dragonlance&quot; movie===
Jason Marsden voiced Tasslehoff in the animated movie &quot;&quot;. The 2002 winner of the American Library Association&#x27;s Alex Award Mel Odom reviewed the film and described Tasslehoff as &quot;a kleptomaniac&quot;.

==Reception==
Jason Heller, of The A.V. Club, notes that Tasslehoff, &quot;the group&#x27;s token member of the hobbit-like kender race, winds up being a source of real pathos after a rocky start as a kleptomaniac punchline.&quot;

Lauren Davis of io9 describes Tasslehoff as &quot;endlessly resourceful and his tendency to steal any small object in sight proves more useful than annoying. Plus, his cheerful demeanor is often a welcome ray of light in the books&#x27; darker moments, though his gradual journey to maturity is one of the series&#x27; most satisfying arcs—and the reason he becomes such a heroic figure in later volumes.&quot;

In the &quot;Io9&quot; series revisiting older &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; novels, Rob Bricken commented that &quot;A kender, a race particular to the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; setting that are hobbit-sized but not interested in creature comforts and Elevensies. Instead, they&#x27;re innately curious, playful to the occasional point of meanness, and generally so happy-go-lucky they genuinely don&#x27;t feel fear. They&#x27;re also uniformly kleptomaniacs.&quot;

<doc id="827571" wikidata="Q81737" url="?curid=827571" title="Millennium Development Goals">
<text>In the United Nations, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were eight international development goals for the year 2015 created following the Millennium Summit, following the adoption of the United Nations Millennium Declaration. These were based on the OECD DAC International Development Goals agreed by Development Ministers in the &quot;Shaping the 21st Century Strategy&quot;. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) succeeded the MDGs in 2016.

All 191 United Nations member states, and at least 22 international organizations, committed to help achieve the following Millennium Development Goals by 2015:

# To eradicate extreme poverty and hunger
# To achieve universal primary education
# To promote gender equality and empower women
# To reduce child mortality
# To improve maternal health
# To combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases
# To ensure environmental sustainability
# To develop a global partnership for development

Each goal had specific targets, and dates for achieving those targets. The eight goals were measured by 21 targets. To accelerate progress, the G8 finance ministers agreed in June 2005 to provide enough funds to the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the African Development Bank (AfDB) to cancel $40 to $55 billion in debt owed by members of the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) to allow them to redirect resources to programs for improving health and education and for alleviating poverty.

Critics of the MDGs complained of a lack of analysis and justification behind the chosen objectives, and the difficulty or lack of measurements for some goals and uneven progress, among others. Although developed countries&#x27; aid for achieving the MDGs rose during the challenge period, more than half went for debt relief and much of the remainder going towards natural disaster relief and military aid, rather than further development.

As of 2013, progress towards the goals was uneven. Some countries achieved many goals, while others were not on track to realize any. A UN conference in September 2010 reviewed progress to date and adopted a global plan to achieve the eight goals by their target date. New commitments targeted women&#x27;s and children&#x27;s health, and new initiatives in the worldwide battle against poverty, hunger and disease.

== Background ==
=== Origins ===
Following the end of the Cold War, a series of UN‑led conferences in the 1990s had focused on issues such as children, nutrition, human rights and women, producing commitments for combined international action on those matters. The 1995 World Summit on Social Development produced a &quot;Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development&quot; with a long and complex list of commitments by global leaders, including many adapted from the outcomes of previous conferences. But international aid levels were falling and, in that same year, the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD set up a reflection process to review the future of development aid. The resulting 1996 report, &quot;Shaping the 21st Century&quot;, turned some of the Copenhagen commitments into six monitorable &quot;International Development Goals&quot;, which had similar content and form to the eventual MDGs: halving poverty by 2015; universal primary education by 2015; eliminating gender disparity in schools by 2005; reductions in infant, child and maternal mortality by 2015, universal access to reproductive health services by 2015 and adequate national strategies for sustainable development in place everywhere by 2015.

In late 1997, the UN General Assembly envisaged a special Millennium Assembly and forum as a focus for efforts to reform the UN system. A year later, it specifically resolved to hold not only the Millennium Assembly but also a Millennium Summit, and mandated the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, to come up with proposals for &quot;a number of forward-looking and widely relevant topics&quot;, thus opening the possibility of going beyond the institutional questions of UN reform. Annan&#x27;s report, when published in April 2000 under the title &quot;We the Peoples: The Role of the United Nations in the 21st Century&quot;, framed the questions of UN reform within the larger challenges facing the world, the chief of which was identified as &quot;to ensure that globalization becomes a positive force for all the world&#x27;s people, instead of leaving billions of them behind in squalor&quot;. In the report Annan urged the forthcoming Millennium Summit to adopt certain key goals and objectives on many of the issues raised in the Copenhagen summit, other conferences of the 1990s, and the recently published Brahimi Report on international peace and security.

The Millennium Summit and the General Assembly in September 2000 issued a Millennium Declaration echoing the agenda that Annan had set out. This declaration did not specifically mention &quot;Millennium Development Goals&quot;, but it does contain the substance – and much of the same wording – as the eventual goals. A process of selecting and refining the Goals from the content of the Declaration continued for some time. A crucial moment here was unification between discussions under the auspices of the United Nations and approaches being followed by the OECD based on &quot;Shaping the 21st Century&quot;; this unification was agreed at a meeting convened by the World Bank in March 2001. In September 2001, Annan presented to the General Assembly a &quot;Road map towards the implementation of the United Nations Millennium Declaration&quot; which did contain a section specifically about &quot;the Millennium Development Goals&quot;, enunciating some of them in their eventual wording, and indicating the remaining issues in formulating a definitive set.

===Human capital, infrastructure and human rights===
The MDGs emphasized three areas: human capital, infrastructure and human rights (social, economic and political), with the intent of increasing living standards. Human capital objectives include nutrition, healthcare (including child mortality, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, and reproductive health) and education. Infrastructure objectives include access to safe drinking water, energy and modern information/communication technology; increased farm outputs using sustainable practices; transportation; and environment. Human rights objectives include empowering women, reducing violence, increasing political voice, ensuring equal access to public services and increasing security of property rights. The goals were intended to increase an individual&#x27;s human capabilities and &quot;advance the means to a productive life&quot;. The MDGs emphasize that each nation&#x27;s policies should be tailored to that country&#x27;s needs; therefore most policy suggestions are general.

==Goals==
The MDGs were developed out of several commitments set forth in the Millennium Declaration, signed in September 2000. There are eight goals with 21 targets, and a series of measurable health indicators and economic indicators for each target.

===Goal 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger===
* Target 1A: Halve, between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of people living on less than $1.25 a day
* Target 1B: Achieve Decent Employment for Women, Men, and Young People
* Target 1C: Halve, between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of people who suffer from hunger

===Goal 2: Achieve universal primary education===
* Target 2A: By 2015, all children can complete a full course of Primary education/primary schooling, girls and boys
MDG 2 focused on primary education and emphasizes enrollment and completion. In some countries, primary enrollment increased at the expense of achievement levels. In some cases, the emphasis on primary education has negatively affected secondary and post-secondary education.

===Goal 3: Promote gender equality and empower women===
* Target 3A: Eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education preferably by 2005, and at all levels by 2015

===Goal 4: Reduce child mortality rates===
* Target 4A: Reduce by two-thirds, between 1990 and 2015, the under-five mortality rate 
Achieving the MDGs does not depend on economic growth alone. In the case of MDG 4, developing countries such as Bangladesh have shown that it is possible to reduce child mortality with only modest growth with inexpensive yet effective interventions, such as measles immunization. Still, government expenditure in many countries is not enough to meet the agreed spending targets. 

===Goal 5: Improve maternal health===
* Target 5A: Reduce by three-quarters, between 1990 and 2015, the maternal mortality ratio
* Target 5B: Achieve, by 2015, universal access to reproductive health

===Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases===
* Target 6A: Have halted by 2015 and begun to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS
* Target 6B: Achieve, by 2010, universal access to treatment for HIV/AIDS for all those who need it
* Target 6C: Have halted by 2015 and begun to reverse the incidence of malaria and other major diseases
Research on health systems suggests that a &quot;one size fits all&quot; model will not sufficiently respond to the individual healthcare profiles of developing countries; however, a study found a common set of constraints in scaling up international health, including the lack of absorptive capacity, weak health systems, human resource limitations, and high costs. The study argued that the emphasis on coverage obscures the measures required for expanding health care. These measures include political, organizational, and functional dimensions of scaling up, and the need to nurture local organizations.

===Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability===
* Target 7A: Integrate the principles of sustainable development into country policies and programs; reverse loss of environmental resources
* Target 7B: Reduce biodiversity loss, achieving, by 2010, a significant reduction in the rate of loss
* Target 7C: Halve, by 2015, the proportion of the population without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation
* Target 7D: By 2020, to have achieved a significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum-dwellers

===Goal 8: Develop a global partnership for development===
* Target 8A: Develop further an open, rule-based, predictable, non-discriminatory trading and financial system
* Target 8B: Address the Special Needs of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs)
* Target 8C: Address the special needs of landlocked developing countries and small island developing States
* Target 8D: Deal comprehensively with the debt problems of developing countries through national and international measures in order to make debt sustainable in the long term
* Target 8E: In co-operation with pharmaceutical companies, provide access to affordable, essential drugs in developing countries
* Target 8F: In co-operation with the private sector, make available the benefits of new technologies, especially information and communications
MDG 8 uniquely focused on donor achievements, rather than development successes. The &quot;Commitment to Development Index&quot;, published annually by the Center for Global Development in Washington, D.C., is considered the best numerical indicator for MDG 8. It is a more comprehensive measure of donor progress than official development assistance, as it takes into account policies on a number of indicators that affect developing countries such as trade, migration and investment.

==Progress==
A major conference was held at UN headquarters in New York on 20–22 September 2010 to review progress. The conference concluded with the adoption of a global action plan to accelerate progress towards the eight anti-poverty goals. Major new commitments on women&#x27;s and children&#x27;s health, poverty, hunger and disease ensued.

Between 1990 and 2010 the population living on less than $1.25 a day in developing countries halved to 21%, or 1.2 billion people, achieving MDG 1A before the target date, although the biggest decline was in China, which took no notice of the goal. However, the child mortality and maternal mortality are down by less than half. Sanitation (MDG 7) and education (MDG 2) targets will also be missed.

Fundamental issues such as gender, the divide between the humanitarian and development agendas and economic growth will determine whether or not the MDGs are achieved, according to researchers at the Overseas Development Institute (ODI).

Progress towards reaching the goals has been uneven across countries. Brazil achieved many of the goals, while others, such as Benin, are not on track to realize any. The major successful countries include China (whose poverty population declined from 452 million to 278 million) and India. The World Bank estimated that MDG 1A (halving the proportion of people living on less than $1 a day) was achieved in 2008 mainly due to the results from these two countries and East Asia.

In the early 1990s Nepal was one of the world&#x27;s poorest countries and remains South Asia&#x27;s poorest country. Doubling health spending and concentrating on its poorest areas halved maternal mortality between 1998 and 2006. Its Multidimensional Poverty Index has seen the largest decreases of any tracked country. Bangladesh has made some of the greatest improvements in infant and maternal mortality ever seen, despite modest income growth.

=== Success factors ===
Scholars identified six factors that have &quot;enabled or hindered MDG implementation&quot; for particular countries: These include &quot;path dependencies&quot; (&quot;whether the MDGs are in line with the historical political orientation and tradition of a country&quot;), government ownership of the MDGs, pressure from NGOs, availability of financial resources, &quot;administrative capacity and level of economic development&quot;, and &quot;support from international or bilateral donors&quot;. The researchers found China successful in achieving the MDGs due to its strong administration, economic growth, and effective national strategies, which were well aligned with the MDGs.

===Multilateral debt reduction===
G‑8 Finance Ministers met in London in June 2005 in preparation for the Gleneagles Summit in July and agreed to provide enough funds to the World Bank, IMF and the African Development Bank (AfDB) to cancel the remaining HIPC multilateral debt ($40 to $55 billion). Recipients would theoretically re-channel debt payments to health and education.

The Gleaneagles plan became the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). Countries became eligible once their lending agency confirmed that the countries had continued to maintain the reforms they had implemented.

While the World Bank and AfDB limited MDRI to countries that complete the HIPC program, the IMF&#x27;s eligibility criteria were slightly less restrictive so as to comply with the IMF&#x27;s unique &quot;uniform treatment&quot; requirement. Instead of limiting eligibility to HIPC countries, any country with per capita income of $380 or less qualified for debt cancellation. The IMF adopted the $380 threshold because it closely approximated the HIPC threshold.

=== Millennium Development Goal 3 (gender equality) ===

Increased focus on gender issues could accelerate MDG progress, e.g. empowering women through access to paid work could help reduce child mortality. In South Asian countries babies often suffered from low birth weight and high mortality due to limited access to healthcare and maternal malnutrition. Paid work could increase women&#x27;s access to health care and better nutrition, reducing child mortality. Increasing female education and workforce participation increased these effects. Improved economic opportunities for women also decreased participation in the sex market, which decreased the spread of AIDS, MDG 6A.

Although the resources, technology and knowledge exist to decrease poverty through improving gender equality, the political will is often missing. If donor and developing countries focused on seven &quot;priority areas&quot;, great progress could be made towards the MDG. These seven priority areas include: increasing girls&#x27; completion of secondary school, guaranteeing sexual and reproductive health rights, improving infrastructure to ease women&#x27;s and girl&#x27;s time burdens, guaranteeing women&#x27;s property rights, reducing gender inequalities in employment, increasing seats held by women in government, and combating violence against women.

It is thought by some women&#x27;s rights&#x27; advocatess that the current MDGs targets do not place enough emphasis on tracking gender inequalities in poverty reduction and employment as there are only gender goals relating to health, education, and political representation. Feminist writers such as Naila Kabeer have argued that in order to encourage women&#x27;s empowerment and progress towards the MDGs, increased emphasis should be placed on gender mainstreaming development policies and collecting data based on gender.

According to MDG Monitor, the target under MDG 3 &quot;To eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education by 2005, and in all levels of education by 2015&quot; was met.

However MDG monitor points out that while parity has been achieved across the developing world, there are regional and national differences favouring girls in some cases and boys in others. In secondary education in &quot;Western Asia, Oceania, and sub-Saharan Africa, girls are still at a disadvantage, while the opposite is true in Latin America and the Caribbean – boys are at a disadvantage.&quot; Similarly in tertiary education there are disparities &quot;at the expense of men in Northern Africa, Eastern Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean&quot; while conversely they are &quot;at the expense of women in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.&quot;

== Funding commitment ==
Over the past 35 years, UN members have repeatedly &quot;commit[ted] 0.7% of rich-countries&#x27; gross national income (GNI) to Official Development Assistance&quot;. The commitment was first made in 1970 by the UN General Assembly.

The text of the commitment was: &quot;Each economically advanced country will progressively increase its official development assistance to the developing countries and will exert its best efforts to reach a minimum net amount of 0.7 percent of its gross national product at market prices by the middle of the decade.&quot;

The attention to well-being other than income helps bring funding to achieving MDGs. Further MDGs prioritize interventions, establish obtainable objectives with useful measurements of progress despite measurement issues and increased the developed world&#x27;s involvement in worldwide poverty reduction. MDGs include gender and reproductive rights, environmental sustainability, and spread of technology. Prioritizing interventions helps developing countries with limited resources make decisions about allocating their resources. MDGs also strengthen the commitment of developed countries and encourage aid and information sharing. The global commitment to the goals likely increases the likelihood of their success. They note that MDGs are the most broadly supported poverty reduction targets in world history.

The International Health Partnership (IHP+) aimed to accelerate MDG progress by applying international principles for effective aid and development in the health sector. In developing countries, significant funding for health came from external sources requiring governments to coordinate with international development partners. As partner numbers increased variations in funding streams and bureaucratic demands followed. By encouraging support for a single national health strategy, a single monitoring and evaluation framework, and mutual accountability, IHP+ attempted to build confidence between government, civil society, development partners and other health stakeholders.

=== European Union ===
In 2005 the European Union reaffirmed its commitment to the 0.7% aid targets, noting that &quot;four out of the five countries, which exceed the UN target for ODA of 0.7%, of GNI are member states of the European Union&quot;. Further, the UN &quot;believe[s] that donors should commit to reaching the long-standing target of 0.7 percent of GNI by 2015&quot;.

=== United States ===
However, the United States as well as other nations disputed the Monterrey Consensus that urged &quot;developed countries that have not done so to make concrete efforts towards the target of 0.7% of gross national product (GNP) as ODA to developing countries&quot;.

The US consistently opposed setting specific foreign-aid targets since the UN General Assembly first endorsed the 0.7% goal in 1970.

=== OECD ===
Many Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations, did not donate 0.7% of their GNI. Some nations&#x27; contributions fell far short of 0.7%.

The Australian government committed to providing 0.5% of GNI in International Development Assistance by 2015–2016.

==Criticism==
===General===
General criticisms included a perceived lack of analytical power and justification behind the chosen objectives. Some of the indicator definitions, baselines and targets were changed after their first adoption, to suggest that progress had been better than was really the case.

Further criticism included their &quot;money-metric and donor-centric view&quot;, their &quot;unidirectional dimension and narrow focus on developing countries, with industrialized countries being deployed almost as their tutors&quot;, the &quot;lack of stakeholder engagement in formulating the MDGs&quot; and the &quot;weak review mechanisms to measure performance&quot;.

David Hulme and James Scott noted that the process of creating the MDGs was diffuse, having no single architect and &quot;no clear start or end&quot;. They also commented that the process was driven by rich states rather than the countries that would be more the subject of MDG interventions. The entire MDG process has been accused of lacking legitimacy as a result of failure to include, often, the voices of the very participants that the MDGs seek to assist. 

The MDGs lacked strong objectives and indicators for within-country equality, despite significant disparities in many developing nations.

The MDGs were attacked for insufficient emphasis on environmental sustainability. Thus, they did not capture all elements needed to achieve the ideals set out in the Millennium Declaration.

===Human rights===
The MDGs may under-emphasize local participation and empowerment (other than women&#x27;s empowerment). FIAN International, a human rights organization focusing on the right to adequate food, contributed to the Post 2015 process by pointing out a lack of: &quot;primacy of human rights; qualifying policy coherence; and of human rights based monitoring and accountability. Without such accountability, no substantial change in national and international policies can be expected.&quot;

===Measurement difficulties===
A publication from 2005 argued that goals related to maternal mortality, malaria and tuberculosis are impossible to measure and that current UN estimates lack scientific validity or are missing. Household surveys are the primary measure for the health MDGs but may be poor and duplicative measurements that consume limited resources. Furthermore, countries with the highest levels of these conditions typically have the least reliable data collection. The study also argued that without accurate measures, it is impossible to determine the amount of progress, leaving MDGs as little more than a rhetorical call to arms.

MDG proponents such as McArthur and Sachs countered that setting goals is still valid despite measurement difficulties, as they provide a political and operational framework to efforts. With an increase in the quantity and quality of healthcare systems in developing countries, more data could be collected. They asserted that non-health related MDGs were often well measured, and that not all MDGs were made moot by lack of data.

===Equity===
Further developments in rethinking strategies and approaches to achieving the MDGs include research by the Overseas Development Institute into the role of equity. Researchers at the ODI argued that progress could be accelerated due to recent breakthroughs in the role equity plays in creating a virtuous circle where rising equity ensures the poor participate in their country&#x27;s development and creates reductions in poverty and financial stability. Yet equity should not be understood purely as economic, but also as political. Examples abound, including Brazil&#x27;s cash transfers, Uganda&#x27;s eliminations of user fees and the subsequent huge increase in visits from the very poorest or else Mauritius&#x27;s dual-track approach to liberalization (inclusive growth and inclusive development) aiding it on its road into the World Trade Organization. Researchers at the ODI thus propose equity be measured in league tables in order to provide a clearer insight into how MDGs can be achieved more quickly; the ODI is working with partners to put forward league tables at the 2010 MDG review meeting.

== Examples ==

===Sub-Saharan Africa===
One success was to strengthen rice production in Sub-Saharan Africa. By the mid‑1990s, rice imports reached nearly $1 billion annually. Farmers had not found suitable rice varieties that produce high yields. New Rice for Africa (NERICA), a high-yielding and well adapted strain, was developed and introduced in areas including Congo Brazzaville, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, Togo and Uganda. Some 18 varieties of this strain became available, enabling African farmers to produce enough rice to feed their families and have extra to sell.

The region also showed progress towards MDG 2. School fees that included Parent-Teacher Association and community contributions, textbook fees, compulsory uniforms and other charges took up nearly a quarter of a poor family&#x27;s income and led countries including Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Uganda to eliminate such fees, increasing enrollment. For instance, in Ghana, public school enrollment in the most deprived districts rose from 4.2 million to 5.4 million between 2004 and 2005. In Kenya, primary school enrollment added 1.2 million in 2003 and by 2004, the number had climbed to 7.2 million.

=== Millennium Villages Project ===
Following the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), in 2000, Jeffrey Sachs of The Earth Institute at Columbia University was among the leading academic scholars and practitioners on the MDGs. He chaired the WHO Commission on Macroeconomics and Health (2000–01), which played a pivotal role in scaling up the financing of health care and disease control in the low-income countries to support MDGs 4, 5, and 6. He worked with UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan in 2000–2001 to design and launch The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. He also worked with senior officials of the George W. Bush administration to develop the PEPFAR program to fight HIV/AIDS, and the PMI to fight malaria. On behalf of Annan, from 2002 to 2006 he chaired the UN Millennium Project, which was tasked with developing a concrete action plan to achieve the MDGs. The UN General Assembly adopted the key recommendations of the UN Millennium Project at a special session in September 2005. 

The Millennium Villages Project, which Sachs directed, operated in more than a dozen African countries and covered more than 500,000 people. The MVP has engendered considerable controversy associated as critics have questioned both the design of the project and claims made for its success. In 2012 &quot;The Economist&quot; reviewed the project and concluded &quot;the evidence does not yet support the claim that the millennium villages project is making a decisive impact.&quot; Critics have pointed to the failure to include suitable controls that would allow an accurate determination of whether the Projects methods were responsible for any observed gains in economic development. A 2012 &quot;Lancet&quot; paper claiming a 3-fold increase in the rate of decline in childhood mortality was criticized for flawed methodology, and the authors later admitted that the claim was &quot;unwarranted and misleading&quot;.

=== Activities and organizations ===
* The United Nations Millennium Campaign was launched to increase support for the Millennium Development Goals. The Millennium Campaign targets intergovernmental, government, civil society organizations and media at global and regional levels.
* The Millennium Promise Alliance, Inc. (or simply the &quot;Millennium Promise&quot;) is a U.S.-based non-profit organization founded in 2005 by Jeffrey Sachs and Ray Chambers. Millennium Promise coordinated the Millennium Villages Project in partnership with Columbia&#x27;s Earth Institute and UNDP; it aimed to demonstrate MDG feasibility through an integrated, community-led approach. The project ran from 2005 to 2015, operating in 15 sites across 11 countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
* The Youth in Action EU Programme &quot;Cartoons in Action&quot; project created animated videos about MDGs, and videos about MDG targets using Arcade C64 videogames.

==Next set of goals (SDGs)==

Although there have been major advancements and improvements achieving some of the MDGs even before the deadline of 2015, the progress has been uneven between the countries. In 2012 the UN Secretary-General established the &quot;UN System Task Team on the Post-2015 UN Development Agenda&quot;, bringing together more than 60 UN agencies and international organizations to focus and work on sustainable development.

At the MDG Summit, UN Member States discussed the Post-2015 Development Agenda and initiated a process of consultations. Civil society organizations also engaged in the post-2015 process, along with academia and other research institutions, including think tanks.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the goals and targets relating to future sustainable development for 2030 once the MDGs expired at the end of 2015.

On 31 July 2012, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed 26 public and private leaders to advise him on the post-MDG agenda.

In 2014, the UN&#x27;s Commission on the Status of Women agreed on a document that called for the acceleration of progress towards achieving the millennium development goals, and confirmed the need for a stand-alone goal on gender equality and women&#x27;s empowerment in post-2015 goals, and for gender equality to underpin all of the post-2015 goals.

<text>Dominic Paul DiMaggio (February 12, 1917 – May 8, 2009), nicknamed &quot;the Little Professor&quot;, was an American Major League Baseball center fielder. He played his entire 11-year baseball career for the Boston Red Sox (1940–1953). DiMaggio was the youngest of three brothers who each became major league center fielders, the others being Joe and Vince.

==Biography==
An effective leadoff hitter, DiMaggio batted .300 four times and led the American League in runs twice and in triples and stolen bases once each. He also led AL center fielders in assists three times and in putouts and double plays twice each; he tied a league record by recording 400 putouts four times, and his 1948 totals of 503 putouts and 526 total chances stood as AL records for nearly 30 years. DiMaggio&#x27;s 1,338 games in center field ranked eighth in AL history at his retirement. His 34-game hitting streak in 1949 remains a record for the major-league Red Sox.
DiMaggio was the youngest of three brothers who grew up in North Beach, San Francisco and who had each become major league center fielders. Joe was a star with the rival New York Yankees, and Vince played for five National League teams. The youngest of nine children born to Sicilian immigrants, Dom&#x27;s small stature (5&#x27;9&quot;) and eyeglasses earned him the nickname &quot;The Little Professor.&quot;

DiMaggio broke into the minor leagues in 1937 with the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League. For the 1939 season, DiMaggio recorded a .360 batting average. Following this season, the Boston Red Sox purchased DiMaggio&#x27;s contract for $75,000. In his rookie season, he hit .301, becoming part of a .300-hitting outfield with Ted Williams and Doc Cramer. In both 1941 and 1942 he scored over 100 runs to finish third in the AL, and was among the league&#x27;s top ten players in doubles and steals; he was named an All-Star both years.

After missing three years serving in the Navy in World War II, DiMaggio returned in with his best season yet, batting .316 to place fifth in the league, and coming in ninth in the MVP voting as Boston won its first pennant in 28 years. Batting third, he hit only .259 in the 1946 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, but was almost a Series hero for Boston. With two out in the eighth inning of Game 7, he doubled to drive in two runs, tying the score 3-3; but he pulled his hamstring coming into second base, and had to be removed for a pinch runner. The result was costly, as Harry Walker doubled to center field in the bottom of the inning, with Enos Slaughter scoring from first base in his famed &quot;Mad Dash&quot; to win the game and Series for St. Louis; had DiMaggio remained in the game, Walker&#x27;s hit might have been catchable, or the outfielder&#x27;s strong arm might have held Slaughter to third base. &quot;If they hadn&#x27;t taken DiMaggio out of the game&quot;, Slaughter later said of his daring sprint, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t have tried it.&quot;

After a disappointing offensive year in 1947, DiMaggio rebounded in 1948 to score 127 runs (second in the AL) with career highs in doubles (40), runs batted in (87) and walks (101). His 503 putouts broke Baby Doll Jacobson&#x27;s AL record of 484, set with the St. Louis Browns; his 526 total chances surpassed the league mark of 498 shared by Sam Rice of the Washington Senators and Jacobson. At the time, the marks ranked behind only Taylor Douthit&#x27;s totals of 547 and 566 with the Cardinals in major league history; both records stood until , when Chet Lemon of the Chicago White Sox recorded 512 putouts and 536 total chances. In 1949 DiMaggio batted .307 with 126 runs, and had his team-record 34-game hitting streak; ironically, the streak was ended on August 9 by an outstanding catch made by his brother Joe and also ironically, Vic Raschi book-ended the streak as Dom went hitless against Raschi the game before his 34-game hitting streak.. That year he made 400 putouts for the fourth time, tying the AL record held by Sam West of the Senators and Browns; the mark was later tied by two other players before being broken by Lemon in .
In , DiMaggio led the AL in runs (131), triples (11) and stolen bases (15) while hitting a career-high .328. On June 30, he and Joe hit home runs while playing against one another, becoming the fourth pair of brothers to homer in the same game. Dom&#x27;s stolen base total of 15 is the lowest stolen base total to lead either of the Major Leagues in a single season. In August of that year, he had 53 base hits, tying a club record with teammate Johnny Pesky.

DiMaggio again led the league in runs (113) in , when he had a 27-game hitting streak from May 12 to June 7. He retired in May , after appearing in only three games that year as a pinch hitter, with a .298 batting average, 1680 hits, 308 doubles, 57 triples, 87 home runs, 1046 runs and 618 RBI in 1399 games. DiMaggio was selected an All-Star seven times (1941–42, 1946, 1949–52). His career average of 2.9 chances per game remains the record for AL outfielders.

DiMaggio enjoyed a close friendship with teammates Ted Williams, Bobby Doerr, and Johnny Pesky, which was chronicled in David Halberstam&#x27;s book &quot;The Teammates&quot;. The four were later honored with &quot;The Teammates&quot; statue outside Fenway Park.

After retiring, he became a plastics manufacturer in New England. He and his wife Emily, whom he married in 1948, had two sons, Paul and Peter; a daughter, Emily, and several grandchildren.

Writer David Halberstam described Dom as &quot;probably the most underrated player of his day.&quot;

=== Life after baseball ===
After his retirement from professional baseball in 1953, DiMaggio formed the American Latex Fiber Corporation, which produced padding for items such as automobile seats and furniture. DiMaggio would eventually purchase an automotive supply firm and would merge it with American Latex Fiber Corporation to form the Delaware Valley Corporation.

In 1959, DiMaggio joined forces with nine other New Englanders, led by Billy Sullivan, to found and capitalize a Boston American football team that debuted in 1960 as the AFL&#x27;s Boston Patriots. DiMaggio&#x27;s tenure as an owner of the Patriots was not an easy one, his disputes with Sullivan would lead him to once attempt to oust him as president. Eventually, DiMaggio would sell his stock in the Boston Patriots in August 1966 for $500,000, earning DiMaggio a profit of $400,000 from his initial investment of $100,000.

After the death of Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey in July 1976, DiMaggio was a part of a group which included his brother Joe, Red Sox General Manager Dick O&#x27;Connell, San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto, and insurance magnate Bernard Baldwin, which sought to obtain ownership of the Red Sox. The attempt fell through after Tom Yawkey&#x27;s widow, Jean Yawkey, chose to retain ownership.

In 1979, DiMaggio was named a member of the board of trustees at Saint Anselm College in Goffstown, New Hampshire. He served under college president Fr. Jonathan DeFelice and helped lead the college through four decades of expansion. DiMaggio was awarded an honorary degree by the college in 1981, and his wife Emily received one in 1999.

DiMaggio was inducted into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 1995.

===Military service===
After the 1942 season, DiMaggio enlisted in the United States Navy with initial service at Naval Station Treasure Island in San Francisco, California. He deployed to Australia and the Philippines during World War II. While stationed in Australia, he and Phil Rizzuto flew to Honolulu to play in the 1944 
Army–Navy World Series. He also played for the Norfolk Naval Training Station team. He was discharged in 1945 as a chief petty officer.

==Death==

DiMaggio died on May 8, 2009, at his home in Marion, Massachusetts. He was 92 years old and had been suffering from pneumonia. His requiem mass was celebrated by his friend Fr. Jonathan DeFelice at St. Paul&#x27;s Catholic Church in Wellesley, Massachusetts.

<doc id="827595" wikidata="Q1312952" url="?curid=827595" title="Eisenhower dollar">
<text>The Eisenhower dollar is a one-dollar coin issued by the United States Mint from 1971 to 1978; it was the first coin of that denomination issued by the Mint since the Peace dollar series ended in 1935. The coin depicts President Dwight D. Eisenhower on the obverse, and a stylized image honoring the 1969 Apollo 11 Moon mission on the reverse. Both sides were designed by Frank Gasparro, with the reverse based on the mission patch designed by astronaut Michael Collins. It is the only large-size U.S. dollar coin whose circulation strikes contained no silver.

In 1965, because of rises in bullion prices, the Mint began to strike copper-nickel clad coins instead of silver. No dollar coins had been issued for thirty years, but, beginning in 1969, legislators sought to reintroduce a dollar coin into commerce. After Eisenhower died that March, there were a number of proposals to honor him with the new coin. While these bills generally commanded wide support, enactment was delayed by a dispute over whether the new dollar coin should be in base metal or 40% silver. In 1970, a compromise was reached to strike the Eisenhower dollar in base metal for circulation, and in 40% silver as a collectible. On December 31, 1970, President Richard Nixon, who had served as vice president under Eisenhower, signed legislation authorizing mintage of the new coin.

Although the 40% silver collector&#x27;s pieces sold well, the new base-metal dollars failed to circulate to any significant degree, except in and around Nevada casinos, where they were preferred over privately issued tokens. There are no dollar coins dated 1975; coins struck that year and from 1976 bear the double date 1776–1976, and a special reverse by Dennis R. Williams in honor of the bicentennial of American independence. Beginning in 1977, the Mint sought to replace the cumbersome Eisenhower dollar with a smaller-sized coin. Congress authorized the Susan B. Anthony dollar, struck beginning in 1979, but that coin also failed to circulate. Given their modest cost and the short length of the series, complete sets of Eisenhower dollars are inexpensive to assemble and are gaining popularity with coin collectors.

==Background==

The silver dollar had never been a popular coin, circulating little except in the West; it served as a means of monetizing metal and generally sat in bank vaults once struck. The Peace dollar, the last circulating dollar made of silver, was not struck after 1935, and in most years in the quarter century after that, the bullion value of a silver dollar did not exceed 70 cents. In the early 1960s, though, silver prices rose, and the huge stocks of silver dollars in the hands of banks and the government were obtained by the public through the redemption of silver certificates. This caused shortages of silver dollars in the western states where the pieces circulated, and interests there sought the issuance of more dollars.

On August 3, 1964, Congress passed legislation providing for the striking of 45 million silver dollars. This legislation was enacted when coins vanished from circulation (under Gresham&#x27;s law) as the price of silver rose past $1.29 per ounce, making silver dollars worth more as bullion than as currency. The new pieces were intended to be used at Nevada casinos and elsewhere in the West where &quot;hard money&quot; was popular. Numismatic periodicals complained that striking the dollars was a waste of resources. The law had been passed at the urging of the Senate Majority Leader, Mike Mansfield (Democrat–Montana), who represented a state that heavily used silver dollars. Despite the efforts of Mint Director Eva Adams and her staff to persuade him, Senator Mansfield refused to consider any cancellation or delay, and on May 12, 1965, the Denver Mint began striking 1964-D Peace dollars—the Mint had obtained congressional authorization to continue striking 1964-dated coins into 1965.

A public announcement of the new pieces was made on May 15, 1965, only to be met with a storm of objections. Both the public and many congressmen saw the issue as a poor use of Mint resources at a time of severe coin shortages, which would only benefit coin dealers. On May 24, one day before a hastily called congressional hearing, Adams announced that the pieces were deemed trial strikes, never intended for circulation. The Mint later stated that 316,076 pieces had been struck; all were reported melted amid heavy security. To ensure that there would be no repetition, Congress inserted a provision in the Coinage Act of 1965 forbidding the coinage of silver dollars for five years. That act also removed silver from the dime and quarter, and reduced the silver content of the half dollar to 40%.

==Inception==

In 1969, Nixon administration Mint Director Mary Brooks sought the reissuance of the dollar coin. By this time, rising bullion prices threatened the continued use of silver in the Kennedy half dollar, but Brooks hoped to maintain the dollar as a silver coin. Brooks&#x27;s proposal for a new silver dollar was opposed by the chairman of the House Banking Committee, Wright Patman, who had been persuaded, against his better judgment, by Nixon&#x27;s predecessor, Lyndon Johnson, to support the continued use of silver in the half dollar.

On March 28, 1969, former president and World War II general Dwight D. Eisenhower died. Soon after, New Jersey Representative Florence Dwyer, like Eisenhower, a Republican, suggested that the proposed dollar coin bear his likeness. She spoke to Democratic Missouri Representative Leonor Sullivan, who agreed that the dollar should bear a portrait of Eisenhower as &quot;equal time&quot; to the half dollar, which bore the likeness of Democratic president John F. Kennedy. A bill was filed by Connecticut Congressman Robert N. Giaimo to authorize an Eisenhower dollar, to be struck without silver content. The Joint Commission on the Coinage, drawing members from the administration and from Congress, including Giaimo, recommended the dollar in spring 1969. It also called for the elimination of silver from the half dollar, and for the transfer from the Treasury to the General Services Administration (GSA) of quantities of rare silver dollars, so they could be sold. Giaimo noted that the coin would be useful in casinos, which were striking their own tokens in the absence of circulating dollar coins, and in the vending industry, which was starting to sell higher-priced items.

On October 3, 1969, the House Banking Committee passed legislation for a base-metal Eisenhower dollar, with Patman stating that he hoped to have it approved by the full House in time for the late president&#x27;s birthday on October 14. On October 6, the bill&#x27;s sponsors lost a procedural vote which would have allowed for no amendments. While some representatives spoke against the manner in which the legislation was to be considered, Iowa Congressman H. R. Gross objected to the base-metal composition of the proposed coin: &quot;You would be doing the memory of President Eisenhower no favor to mint a dollar made perhaps of scrap metal.&quot; Both houses voted on October 14, Eisenhower&#x27;s birthday. Although the House passed the administration-backed bill for a base metal dollar, the Senate passed the bill as amended by Colorado Senator Peter Dominick, calling for the piece to be minted in 40% silver. Instrumental in the passage of the Senate amendment was a letter from Mamie Eisenhower, recalling that her husband had liked to give silver dollars as mementoes, and had gone to some effort to obtain coins struck in the year of his birth, 1890. Idaho Senator James McClure stated, &quot;It is somehow beneath the dignity of a great president like General Eisenhower to withhold silver from the coin.&quot; On October 29, 1969, Texas Representative Robert R. Casey introduced legislation to honor both Eisenhower and the recent Apollo 11 Moon landing. These provisions would become part of the enacted bill authorizing the Eisenhower dollar. Casey originally wanted the mission theme of Apollo 11, &quot;We came in peace for all mankind,&quot; to appear on the coin; when the Mint informed him that there was not room for that inscription, he settled for requiring that the reverse design be emblematic of that theme.

In March 1970, the two houses reached a compromise whereby 150 million dollars would be struck in the 40% silver alloy for collectors and others. The circulating dollar, though, would have no silver and would be struck in larger quantities. The 47.4 million troy ounces of silver needed to strike the collectors&#x27; pieces would come from bullion already held by the government. The compromise was worked out by McClure and other congressional Republicans, with the aid of Brooks, an Idahoan. McClure described the deal as &quot;a lot less than the country deserves, but a lot more than it appeared we would get.&quot; The reason for having a collector&#x27;s edition with silver was to avoid the hoarding which had driven the Kennedy half dollar from circulation.

Although the compromise passed the Senate in March 1970, it was blocked in the House by Representative Patman, who was determined to end silver in the coinage. The Senate passed the bill again in September, this time attaching it as a rider to a bank holding company bill sought by Patman. The bill, which also included provisions to eliminate silver from the half dollar and to transfer the rare silver dollars to the GSA, was approved by a conference committee and passed both houses. Nixon had intended to let the bill pass into law without his signature. When aides realized that as Congress had adjourned, not signing the bill would pocket veto it, on December 31, 1970, Nixon hastily signed it only minutes before the midnight deadline.

==Design==

For Mint Chief Engraver Frank Gasparro, the opportunity to put Eisenhower on a coin was the fulfillment of a longtime dream. On June 19, 1945, Gasparro had been one of more than 4 million people who gathered in New York to watch a parade celebrating the Allied victory in Europe. Although Gasparro, then an assistant engraver at the Mint, only saw a glimpse of General Eisenhower, he stepped back from the crowd and drew the general&#x27;s features. That sketch served as the basis of his design for the obverse. Gasparro consulted with the late president&#x27;s widow, Mamie Eisenhower, as to the designs of both sides of the coin; the former First Lady was presented with a galvano (a metallic model used in the coin design process) by Brooks and Gasparro on January 1, 1971. Gasparro wrote in 1991 that he had six weeks to complete the work beginning in mid-November 1970, that his extensive research into eagles over the years was a great help in creating the reverse, and that his sketches were adopted without change. The chief engraver was not given full freedom of design; he was instructed to have the basic layout of the obverse resemble that of the Washington quarter.

Before the legislation passed, Gasparro had prepared two reverses, the one actually used, and a reverse with a more formal heraldic eagle, which numismatic historian and coin dealer Q. David Bowers finds reminiscent of pattern coins prepared in the 1870s. At Congress&#x27;s insistence, the chief engraver created a design in commemoration of the Apollo 11 lunar landing, based on the mission patch conceived by astronaut Michael Collins and others. Bowers deems the choice of the lunar landing &quot;a stroke of genius,&quot; allowing the dollar, which would be little-used in commerce, to be a commemorative both of Eisenhower and of the Moon mission. The reverse depicts an eagle (representing the Lunar Module &quot;Eagle&quot;) swooping low over the Moon&#x27;s surface, holding an olive branch, token of peace, in its claws.

The use of Collins&#x27;s mission patch design had initially been opposed by some government officials because of the fierce expression of the eagle; Gasparro&#x27;s initial concept met similar objections. The Mint Director recalled that Gasparro had gone to the Philadelphia Zoo to look at eagles, and on his return had prepared a design which she felt emphasized the eagle&#x27;s predatory nature. Brooks informed Gasparro that the eagle was &quot;too fierce, too warlike, a little too aggressive&quot; and asked that the expression be made friendlier. Gasparro, who reportedly was unhappy at having to change the eagle, described the final version as &quot;pleasant looking.&quot; The State Department also feared that the eagle&#x27;s expression might offend, and sought a neutral visage. The distant Earth may be seen above the bird, and there are 13 stars in honor of the original states.

Bowers deems the bust of Eisenhower &quot;well modeled&quot; by Gasparro, and notes that the fact that the eagle on the reverse holds only an olive branch, rather than arrows as well (token of war), &quot;meant that the public would like the design.&quot; Nevertheless, he notes that Eisenhower&#x27;s stern expression was widely criticized as not typical of a man noted for geniality. Numismatic author David Lange opines that &quot;the Eisenhower dollar is one of the poorest products to emanate from the U.S. Mint.&quot; Lange writes that, although Gasparro had designed only one side of the coin for the Kennedy half dollar and Lincoln Memorial reverse for the cent, &quot;the Eisenhower dollar was his design alone and should have served as a showcase for his talent. Sadly, it is a mediocre design that reveals his typically unnatural treatment of Ike&#x27;s hair and the eagle&#x27;s feathers.&quot; Some collectors complained after the release that the Earth was not fully shown, not realizing that Gasparro had carefully followed the mission badge. The chief engraver responded by clarifying the design.

==Release==

Two prototype dollars were struck at the Philadelphia Mint on January 25, 1971; they were subsequently destroyed. However, collectors have found at least two 1971-S coins that have been certified as prototypes. Striking such large pieces of tough copper-nickel proved destructive to the Mint&#x27;s dies, and Gasparro repeatedly used the Janvier reducing lathe to lower the relief to be used on the circulation strikes and the uncirculated silver clad coins. The chief engraver altered the resulting master die directly to restore at least some of the detail which was lost as the relief was lowered. The proof coins struck at San Francisco, nevertheless, remained in high relief. This meant that in 1971 and for much of 1972 (until better-quality steel was used in the dies), the uncirculated strikes had a lower relief, less detailed surface, compared with the proof coins. Proof coins are struck slowly, and generally multiple times, to bring out the full detail. Striking of Eisenhower dollars for circulation began at Denver on February 3, apparently without any ceremony; minting at Philadelphia also began early in the year, although Bowers, in his comprehensive encyclopedia of silver and clad dollar coins, does not record a specific date. The first Eisenhower dollars in 40% silver, with an uncirculated finish, were struck at the San Francisco Assay Office (today the San Francisco Mint) on March 31, 1971; Brooks ceremoniously operated the presses. The first coin struck was for presentation to Mamie Eisenhower; the second to David Eisenhower (grandson of Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower) and the third to David Eisenhower&#x27;s father-in-law, President Nixon.
On January 29, 1971, the Mint announced the prices for the 40% silver pieces which would be struck at San Francisco: $3 for uncirculated specimens and $10 for mirror-surfaced proof pieces, with orders to be taken by mail beginning on July 1, with a limit of five of each per customer. Order forms for the public were shipped to 44,000 post offices and 33,000 banks, with instructions not to hand them out until June 18. The Mint returned some orders for being sent in too early. Mint sets of the circulating coinage for 1971 did not include the Eisenhower dollar.

The first proof strikes, at San Francisco, took place in July. The proof pieces were sold in a plastic holder inside a brown box with a gold eagle seal; the uncirculated silver pieces were encased in pliofilm inside a blue envelope. These were dubbed &quot;brown Ikes&quot; and &quot;blue Ikes&quot; and are still known by those terms. On July 27, 1971, President Nixon presented the first piece to be struck to Mamie Eisenhower at a White House ceremony. Sales of the 40% silver pieces were ended on October 8; the first proof coins were mailed to collectors on October 14, President Eisenhower&#x27;s birthday.

The clad circulation strikes of the Eisenhower dollar, the largest clad coin ever issued by the US Mint, were available to the general public through banks beginning on November 1, 1971. Many were hoarded by collectors; there was initially sufficient demand for the coins that many banks imposed a limit of one coin per customer. The clad pieces were struck from coinage strip purchased by the Mint from contractors. Many were not well-struck, causing collectors to purchase rolls in search of better specimens. An oily film was found on a large number of the coins; these coins were cleaned by collectors.

Though there was initially strong
public interest in the new dollar, from the very start the coin still failed to circulate. In 1976, a Treasury study done in conjunction with a private-sector firm found that the Eisenhower dollar had a near-100 percent attrition rate, that is, almost always, a coin was used in only one transaction, and then stopped circulating (by comparison, the attrition rate of the quarter was close to zero). This was because of the coin&#x27;s bulky size and weight, and the lack of potential uses for it. Even so, it was successful in quickly replacing private-issue tokens in Nevada casinos. According to numismatist Randy Camper, over 70% of &quot;circulating&quot; Eisenhower dollars were used in casinos. Although the vending machine industry lobbied for the Eisenhower dollar, few machines were modified to accept the coins. Lange recalled, &quot;The fact is that these coins never circulated outside of casinos and nearby areas, and I don&#x27;t recall ever seeing a vending machine that accepted them.&quot;

==Production==
===Early years (1971–1974)===

The Mint struck over 125 million of the Eisenhower dollars in 1971, more than doubling its largest annual production for a dollar coin. Despite an increased mintage in 1972 to over 170 million, and despite what &quot;COINage&quot; magazine termed &quot;near-heroic measures on the part of the Mint&quot;, the piece did not circulate. In a 1974 article for &quot;COINage&quot;, numismatist Clement F. Bailey noted, &quot;the circulation value of the coin has been nil&quot;. Many Eisenhower dollars were put aside as souvenirs by non-collectors. Nevertheless, the silver coins sold so well that in October 1971, Mint Director Brooks warned that orders for 1971-S proof dollars would not all be filled until well into 1972. She ascribed the delay to the large public demand and to production difficulties which she indicated had been corrected. More than 11 million of the 1971-S silver pieces were sold, in proof and uncirculated, with over 4 million in proof. In May 1972, Treasury Secretary John Connally, testifying before a Senate committee, described the profits the Mint had made on the silver version of the Eisenhower dollar as &quot;just unconscionable&quot;, with the average profit on a silver coin at $3.89, and expected to increase as production became more efficient. Mint officials felt that reducing the price would anger those who had already purchased the pieces.

The 1972 silver pieces were again struck at San Francisco. Sales dropped considerably, to just under 2.2 million specimens in uncirculated and 1.8 million in proof. The part-silver 1972-S Eisenhower dollars were available for sale by mail order, with the ordering period from May 1 to July 15 for the proof coins and August 1 to October 16 for the uncirculated version.

With ample supplies of Eisenhower dollars, the Federal Reserve had no need to order any in 1973, and none were struck for circulation. The 1973 and 1973-D were the first Eisenhower dollars struck for inclusion in mint sets, and were, in theory, only available that way. Over the years, many 1973 and 1973-D dollar coins have been found in circulation, leading to speculation that the 230,798 pieces which were reported melted, after the Mint failed to sell as many mint sets as anticipated, were released into circulation. John Wexler, Bill Crawford, and Kevin Flynn, in their volume on Eisenhower dollars, deny this, citing a 1974 letter from Assistant Director of the Mint for Public Services Roy C. Cahoon, which stated that all 1973 Eisenhower dollars from unsold mint sets were melted. The 1973-S was struck for inclusion in base-metal proof sets, as well as for the regular &quot;blue Ikes&quot; and &quot;brown Ikes&quot;. Sales of the part-silver pieces dipped to a total of just under 2.9 million. The coin was struck again for circulation in 1974, was included in mint sets and proof sets, and was available in proof and uncirculated silver clad from San Francisco. Congress ordered that some of the money from the sale of 1974-S silver pieces be used to support Eisenhower College in Seneca Falls, New York. Coin collectors felt that this set a bad precedent, but about $9 million was paid to the college between 1974 and 1978; yet, despite the infusion of money, the college closed its doors in 1982.

===Bicentennial issue (1975–1976)===
The United States had issued commemorative coins between 1892 and 1954, as a means for fundraising for organizations deemed worthy of federal support. A sponsoring organization would be designated in the authorizing legislation, and was permitted to buy up the issue at face value, selling it to the public at a premium, and pocketing the difference. Various problems with the issues, including mishandling of distributions and complaints that public coins should not be used for private profit, resulted in firm Treasury Department opposition to such issues, and none were struck after 1954.

The American Revolutionary Bicentennial Commission (ARBC) was established by Congress in 1966 as an oversight body for the 1976 two-hundredth anniversary of American independence (the &quot;Bicentennial&quot;). In 1970, its coins and medals advisory committee recommended the issuance of a special half dollar, and subsequently the committee sought the temporary redesign of circulating American coins. Brooks and the Mint initially opposed legislation to effect these proposals, but eventually Brooks supported legislation to redesign the reverses of the quarter, half dollar and dollar coins, and to issue special collector&#x27;s sets in silver clad. Legislation to authorize this was signed by President Nixon on October 18, 1973. By the terms of this legislation, coins of these denomination minted for delivery after July 4, 1975, and before December 31, 1976, would bear special reverses, and also be dated 1776–1976. A total of 15 million sets (45 million) coins in all would be struck in silver clad for sale to the public at a premium.

The reverse designs for the three Bicentennial coins were determined by a design competition open to the public. This competition closed in January 1974, and in March, a design submitted by 22-year-old art student Dennis R. Williams was selected for the dollar. Williams, the youngest person to that point to design a U.S. coin, had submitted a design depicting the Liberty Bell superimposed against the Moon. Gasparro slightly modified the design, simplifying the features visible on the lunar surface, and altering the lettering and the bell. Williams and the designers of the other denominations operated the presses to strike the first coins on August 12, 1974; a set of these prototypes was later given to the new president, Gerald Ford. Williams&#x27;s design was liked by the public but attracted criticism from some numismatists as the Liberty Bell had been previously used on coinage (for example, on the Franklin half dollar). Fearing that a low-mintage 1975 piece would be hoarded, the Mint obtained legislation in December 1974 allowing it to continue coining 1974-dated pieces until it began coinage of Bicentennial pieces.

The Bicentennial dollars were the first of the three denominations to be struck for distribution to the public; these were coined beginning in February 1975. The silver pieces were struck at San Francisco beginning on April 23, 1975. The Mint found that the copper nickel dollar was striking indistinctly, a problem not seen with the silver pieces. Brooks called a halt in production to allow Gasparro to modify the dies; the most noticeable change is that the revised issue, or Type II as it came to be known, have narrower, sharper lettering on the reverse. All silver pieces (struck only at San Francisco) are Type I; all three mints struck both Type I and Type II copper nickel pieces. All dollars included in 1975 proof sets are Type I; all those included in 1976 proof sets are Type II. The first Bicentennial dollars were released into circulation on October 13, 1975. Over 220 million were struck. The Bicentennial design was not used after 1976; sets of silver clad Bicentennial coins were sold by the Mint until sales were finally closed at the end of 1986.

One proof Bicentennial coin in silver clad and lacking a mint mark, similar to the dollar in the prototype set given to President Ford, is known. This piece supposedly came from a cash register drawer at the Woodward &amp; Lothrop department store in Washington, D.C. Thomas K. DeLorey, who was then a reporter for &quot;Coin World&quot;, spoke to the discoverer and was suspicious of the story, thinking it more likely the coin was surreptitiously obtained from the government. He declined to question the origin then, fearing it might be seized and, therefore, not available to numismatists. The piece brought almost $30,000 by private sale in 1987.

===Final years and replacement (1977–1978)===
By 1975, the Treasury was concerned about the drain on resources from striking the dollar, which did not circulate. It engaged a private firm to study the six current denominations of U.S. coinage, and make recommendations. The firm concluded in its report that the Eisenhower dollar was too large and heavy to circulate effectively, but if the diameter was reduced by about a third, and the weight by two-thirds, it might be used. That report found that &quot;the Eisenhower dollar has not been widely accepted by the public because of its large size and weight&quot;. In January 1977, just prior to leaving office, Ford&#x27;s Treasury Secretary, William E. Simon, proposed the elimination of the cent and half dollar, and a reduction in size of the dollar. According to Bowers, the Treasury had come to believe that a coin as large as the Eisenhower dollar simply would not circulate in the United States.

The Mint struck pattern pieces of the smaller size, with various shapes and compositions. An 11-sided coin was considered, which would have differentiated it from the quarter, but the patterns would not work in vending machines. Such exotic metals as titanium were considered before the Mint decided on the standard clad composition. Gasparro prepared, for the circulating pieces, a design showing Liberty with flowing hair, similar to early American coins.

As the Eisenhower dollar awaited its demise, approximately 50 million per year were struck, using the eagle design for the reverse. In both years, the majority coined were at Denver. No silver collector&#x27;s edition was issued; the blue and brown Ikes ended with 1974.

The new Treasury Secretary, Michael Blumenthal, supported Gasparro&#x27;s design in testimony before Congress; Wisconsin Senator William Proxmire dubbed Blumenthal&#x27;s position a &quot;cop-out&quot;. Proxmire refused to introduce the bill, which would have left the choice of design up to Blumenthal or his successor, instead introducing his own legislation to commemorate early women&#x27;s rights leader Susan B. Anthony. Many in the new Congress and in the Carter Administration were social progressives, and supported women&#x27;s lib. Ohio Representative Mary Rose Oakar also introduced legislation for a Susan B. Anthony dollar in October 1978; it proceeded rapidly through Congress and was signed by President Jimmy Carter. Gasparro was given photographs of Anthony and told to reproduce her appearance exactly on the coin. Anthony&#x27;s stern expression caused some to dub it the &quot;Susan B. Agony&quot; dollar. The Eisenhower dollar&#x27;s reverse was used for the Anthony dollar. Convinced that the public would hoard the new pieces, the Mint Bureau produced half a billion before its official release to the public on July 2, 1979. It need not have worried; the public quickly rejected the new coin as too close in size and weight to the quarter dollar, and production for circulation ceased after 1980. Mint Director Stella Hackel Sims stated, &quot;people are accustomed to the Eisenhower dollar, but in time, they&#x27;ll become accustomed to the Susan&quot;. Attempts were made to give the new smaller dollars out as change in postal transactions, and to force their use by U.S. military personnel in Europe; both failed.

The Eisenhower dollar is the final regular-issue dollar coin to have been minted in silver (collectors and proof issues were minted with a purity of 40% Ag), the final dollar coin to be minted in the original large size, and the only circulating &quot;large dollar&quot; (that is, of the same 38mm diameter as earlier 90 percent dollar coins) to have been minted in cupronickel.

==Collecting==

Collected by date and mint mark, no Eisenhower dollar is rare; as a result, the coins are relatively inexpensive and a complete set may be acquired without difficulty. However, many were badly struck, without full detail, especially in 1971 and 1972, and most pieces acquired nicks, scratches or &quot;bag marks&quot; from contact with each other soon after striking. Although lower-grade silver coins can be melted, this is not practical for Eisenhower dollars due to the lack of precious metal content, and dealers often try to get any premium they can on face value. Completing a set of highest-grade specimens may be difficult and expensive, especially for the 1971 and 1972 from Philadelphia or Denver, which were not sold in mint sets, and thus only came to collectors through banks. A 1973-D piece, tied with ten other specimens for the finest known of that date and mint mark in near-pristine MS-67 condition sold in June 2013 for $12,925. According to numismatic writer Steve Reach, &quot;as more people submit modern-era coins like Eisenhower dollars for third-party certification, the true rarity of many issues in top-grades is becoming clear.&quot;

Some of the 1971-D pieces exhibit a variety in which (among several differences) the eagle lacks brow lines, these have been dubbed by Eisenhower dollar specialists the &quot;Friendly Eagle Pattern&quot;. The 1972 dollar struck at Philadelphia is broken down into three varieties, which were made as Gasparro adjusted the design to take advantage of better steel being used in the Mint&#x27;s dies. A midyear change in the design was announced by Brooks at the American Numismatic Association&#x27;s 1972 convention in New Orleans, although she did not state exactly what was being changed. The three varieties may be differentiated by examining the depiction of the Earth on the reverse. Type I dollars show the Earth somewhat flattened, Florida pointing to the southeast, with the islands mostly to the southeast of the tip of the peninsula. The Earth is round and Florida points to the south on the Type II, with a single, large island to the southeast. The Type III is similar to the Type II, except that there are two islands directly to the south of the peninsula. The Type II is from a single reverse die, used in March 1972, and erroneously placed in service at Philadelphia—it is identical to and should have been used for the silver proof strikes at San Francisco. The Type III was placed in service, replacing the Type I, in September 1972. The Type I is most common; the Type III design was used in 1973 and after. The 1972 Type II is expensive in top grades, as is the 1776–1976 Type I from Philadelphia, which was only available in mint sets.

Some 1971-S proof pieces (and a few uncirculated 1971-S) have the serifs at the foot of the &quot;R&quot; in &quot;LIBERTY&quot; missing; this is dubbed the &quot;peg leg&quot; variety. The serifs are missing on all 1972-S, both uncirculated and proof. After the Mint obtained better steel for dies, the serifs returned for all of the remaining non-Bicentennial coinage, from all mints, though the leg of the R was shortened, and also for the Type II Bicentennial (the Type I lacks serifs on the R). Gasparro was often trying to improve the detail of Eisenhower&#x27;s head during the coin&#x27;s tenure, and as the R is the letter closest to it, these changes were most likely made in an effort to improve the flow of metal as the coins were struck.

In 1974 and again in 1977, the Denver Mint struck a small number of pieces on silver-clad planchets, or blanks. Both times, these came from planchets which had been shipped from the San Francisco Assay Office to Denver. The first ones in 1974 were found independently by two Las Vegas blackjack dealers. The 1974 planchets were initially intended to be used for &quot;brown Ike&quot; proof strikings; Mint policy then was that rejected silver proof planchets were to be used for uncirculated &quot;blue Ikes&quot;, but these were placed in the bin for rejected copper-nickel proof planchets, intended to be shipped to be coined for circulation at Denver. The 1977 pieces resulted from pieces rejected for Bicentennial silver proof use, which were again placed in the wrong bin (they should have been melted, as the Mint was no longer striking silver uncirculated Eisenhower dollars). Between 10 and 20 of each date are known. Wexler, Crawford, and Flynn report an even rarer 1776–1976-D dollar in silver, but state that none have been offered at auction or submitted to the major coin grading services.

Bowers notes that the Morgan dollar (struck between 1878 and 1921) was not widely collected at the time, only to become very popular later, and suggests that one day, the turn of the Eisenhower dollar will come. Numismatist Charles Morgan said of the Eisenhower dollar in 2012,

<doc id="827596" wikidata="Q5566466" url="?curid=827596" title="Gladys Staines">
<text>Gladys Staines (born c. 1951) is the widow of Australian missionary Graham Staines. Graham Staines was burnt alive along with their two sons Philip (aged 10) and Timothy (aged 7) by a mob led by the Bajrang Dal activist Dara Singh in Odisha, India on 22 January 1999.

Shortly after the sentencing of the killers, Staines issued a statement saying that she had forgiven the killers and had no bitterness towards them. Rather than return to Australia, Staines &quot;decided to stay in India where she and her husband had served lepers for 15 years&quot;, keeping her daughter Esther, with her, stating: &quot;I cannot just leave those people who love and trust us. I have high regard for the people of India and their tolerance.&quot;

In 2004, &quot;Christianity Today&quot; described this woman as &quot;the best-known Christian in India after Mother Teresa.&quot; In 2005, she was awarded the Padma Shri, a civilian award from the Government of India. As a result of the contributions earned from receiving that award, Staines transformed the leper house she served at into a full hospital. The hospital is named Graham Staines Memorial Hospital, established in 2004. In November 2015, Staines was awarded the Mother Teresa Memorial Award for Social Justice and after receiving the award, she stated &quot;I thank God for his help in enabling me to carry out the work in caring for people with leprosy, even after my husband was killed.&quot;

<doc id="827599" wikidata="Q6254423" url="?curid=827599" title="John Redcliffe-Maud, Baron Redcliffe-Maud">
<text>John Primatt Redcliffe Redcliffe-Maud, Baron Redcliffe-Maud, (3 February 1906 – 20 November 1982), was a British civil servant and diplomat.

==Early life==
Born in Bristol, Maud was educated at Eton College and New College, Oxford. He gained a Second in Classical Moderations in 1928 and a First in Literae Humaniores (&#x27;Greats&#x27;) in 1928. At Oxford he was a member of the Oxford University Dramatic Society (OUDS). In 1928, he gained the one-year Henry P. Davison scholarship to Harvard University where he was awarded an A.B. in 1929. From 1929 to 1932 he was a Junior Research Fellow University College, Oxford and from 1932 to 1939 Fellow (Praelector in Politics) and Dean of the college. He was awarded a Rhodes Travelling Scholarship to Africa in 1932 and held a University Lectureship in Politics at Oxford University, 1938–9.

==Civil service==
During World War II, he was Master of Birkbeck College (1939–1943) and was also based at Reading Gaol, working for the Ministry of Food. He became a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1942, and after the war, he worked at the Ministry of Education (1945–1952), rising to Permanent Secretary and then the Ministry of Fuel and Power until 1958. He became a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1946, and was raised to a Knight Grand Cross in 1955. &quot;Inter alia&quot;, Maud appeared on the BBC programme &quot;The Brains Trust&quot; in 1958. He was High Commissioner to the Union of South Africa from 1959 to 1961, and Ambassador from 1961, when the country became a republic and left the Commonwealth. In 1963, he became Master of University College, Oxford, where he had been a Fellow before the Second World War.

==The Maud Committee==
In March 1964, Maud was appointed by Sir Keith Joseph, at the request of local council associations, to head a departmental committee looking into the management of local government. The Maud Committee reported three years later. During the course of the inquiry, Maud was chosen to head a Royal Commission on the reform of all local government in England. He was awarded a life peerage, hyphenating his surname to become Baron Redcliffe-Maud, of the City and County of Bristol in 1967.


The Report of the Royal Commission on Local Government in England, popularly known as the Redcliffe-Maud Report, was published in 1969. It advocated the wholesale reform of local council boundaries and the institution of large unitary councils based on the principle of mixing rural and urban areas. Accepted by the Labour government of Harold Wilson with minor changes, the opposition from rural areas convinced the Conservative opposition to oppose it and no further action was taken after the Conservatives won the 1970 general election.

==Retirement==
He retired as Master of University College in 1976, to be succeeded by the leading lawyer Lord Goodman. His 1973 portrait by Ruskin Spear can be seen in the National Portrait Gallery, London. Another portrait hangs in the Hall at University College in Oxford.

==Family==
Redcliffe-Maud was married to Jean Hamilton, who was educated at Somerville College, Oxford. His son, Humphrey Maud, was one of Benjamin Britten&#x27;s favourite boys while he was at Eton. Sir John intervened to curtail Humphrey&#x27;s frequent visits to stay with Britten on his own. The incident is described in John Bridcut&#x27;s &quot;Britten&#x27;s Children&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
John Redcliffe-Maud is buried in Holywell Cemetery, Oxford. His archive is held by the London School of Economics Library. Redcliffe-Maud House at the University College Annexe known as &quot;Stavertonia&quot; in North Oxford is named in honour of him.

<text>Michel Richard Delalande [de Lalande] (; 15 December 1657 – 18 June 1726) was a French Baroque composer and organist who was in the service of King Louis XIV. He was one of the most important composers of grands motets. He also wrote orchestral suites known as &quot;Simphonies pour les Soupers du Roy&quot; and ballets.

==Biography==
Born in Paris, he was a contemporary of Jean-Baptiste Lully and François Couperin. Delalande taught music to the daughters of Louis XIV, and was director of the French chapel royal from 1714 until his death at Versailles in 1726.

Delalande was arguably the greatest composer of French &quot;grands motets&quot;, a type of sacred work that was more pleasing to Louis XIV because of its pomp and grandeur, written for soloists, choir and comparatively large orchestra. According to tradition, Louis XIV organized a contest between composers, giving them the same sacred text and time to compose the musical setting. He alone was the judge. Delalande was one of four winners assigned to compose sacred music for each quarter of the year (the other composers being Coupillet, Collasse and Minoret). Delalande&#x27;s was the most important quarter of the year because of the Christmas holiday. Later he had full responsibility for the church music for the complete year. At his death, since he left no mass of his own, the 1656 requiem of the Dukes of Lorraine by Charles d&#x27;Helfer was sung.

==Works==
Delalande left many versions of his works. His earlier versions show adherence to French Baroque style, but the later revisions incorporate more Italian melismatic lines and greater attention to polyphonic counterpoint.

Also, at least four collections of his works exist, each displaying different looks at composer&#x27;s work as viewed by the people who assembled each collection.

Scholarship of Delalande&#x27;s work was for many years hindered because of inconsistencies in the spelling of his last name: de Lalande, Lalande, la Lande, de la Lande, and others. The family wrote the name as &#x27;Delalande&#x27;. Finally, in 2006 the definitive &quot;Thematic Catalogue of the Works of Michel-Richard de Lalande (1657-1726)&quot; by noted British musicologist Lionel Sawkins came out which runs to 752 pages containing over 3,000 music examples and details of performing requirements and of all source materials, as well as with comprehensive indexes and thematic locators.

Vocal
* grands motets - Latin settings of psalms including Delalande&#x27;s &quot;Te Deum&quot; (1684).
* petits motets - shorter Latin settings for a few vocal and instrumental soloists and continuo, including &quot;élévations&quot; on an eucharistic text sung at the elevation of the communion wafers.

Instrumental
Delalande was an expert organist and harpsichordist, and yet has left not a single note of keyboard music.
* ritournelles - twelve substantial ritournelles for François Fossard and André Danican Philidor&#x27;s book of &quot;Airs italiens&quot; (1695). For example, Delalande supplies a 31-bar-long ritournelle for two violins and continuo composed before ‘Giurai di non amar’ an aria from Domenico Freschi&#x27;s &quot;Olimpia vendicata&quot; of 1681.

<doc id="827611" wikidata="Q304419" url="?curid=827611" title="Castle Bravo">
<text>Castle Bravo was the first in a series of high-yield thermonuclear weapon design tests conducted by the United States at Bikini Atoll, Marshall Islands, as part of &quot;Operation Castle&quot;. Detonated on 1 March 1954, the device remains the most powerful nuclear device ever detonated by the United States and the first lithium deuteride-fueled thermonuclear weapon tested using the Teller-Ulam design. Castle Bravo&#x27;s yield was , 2.5 times the predicted , due to unforeseen additional reactions involving lithium-7, which led to radioactive contamination in the surrounding area.

Radioactive nuclear fallout, the heaviest of which was in the form of pulverized surface coral from the detonation, fell on residents of Rongelap and Utirik atolls, while the more particulate and gaseous fallout spread around the world. The inhabitants of the islands were evacuated three days later and suffered radiation sickness. Twenty-three crew members of the Japanese fishing vessel &quot;Daigo Fukuryū Maru&quot; (&quot;Lucky Dragon No. 5&quot;) were also contaminated by the heavy fallout, experiencing acute radiation syndrome, including the death six months later of Kuboyama Aikichi, the boat&#x27;s chief radioman. The blast incited a strong international reaction over atmospheric thermonuclear testing.

The Bravo Crater is located at . The remains of the Castle Bravo causeway are at .

== Bomb design ==
=== Primary system ===
The &quot;Castle Bravo&quot; device was housed in a cylinder that weighed and measured in length and in diameter.

The primary device was a &quot;COBRA&quot; deuterium-tritium gas-boosted atomic bomb made by Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, a very compact MK 7 device. This boosted fission device had been tested in the &quot;Upshot-Knothole&quot; &quot;Climax&quot; event and yielded (out of 50–70 kt expected yield range). It was considered successful enough that the planned operation series &quot;Domino&quot;, designed to explore the same question about a suitable primary for thermonuclear bombs, could be canceled. The implosion system was quite lightweight at , because it eliminated the aluminum pusher shell around the tamper and used the more compact ring lenses, a design feature shared with the Mark 5, 12, 13 and 18 designs. The explosive material of the inner charges in the MK 7 was changed to the more powerful Cyclotol 75/25, instead of the Composition B used in most stockpiled bombs at that time, as Cyclotol 75/25 was denser than Composition B and thus could generate the same amount of explosive force in a smaller volume (it provided 13 percent more compressive energy than Comp B). The composite uranium-plutonium &quot;COBRA&quot; core was levitated in a type-D pit. &quot;COBRA&quot; was Los Alamos&#x27; most recent product of design work on the &quot;new principles&quot; of the hollow core. A copper pit liner encased within the weapon-grade plutonium inner capsule prevented DT gas diffusion into the plutonium, a technique first tested in &quot;Greenhouse Item&quot;. The assembled module weighed , measuring across. It was located at the end of the device, which, as seen in the declassified film, shows a small cone projecting from the ballistic case. This cone is the part of the paraboloid that was used to focus the radiation emanating from the primary into the secondary.

=== Deuterium and lithium ===
The device was called SHRIMP, and had the same basic configuration (radiation implosion) as the &quot;Ivy Mike&quot; wet device, except with a different type of fusion fuel. &quot;SHRIMP&quot; used lithium deuteride (LiD), which is solid at room temperature; &quot;Ivy Mike&quot; used cryogenic liquid deuterium (D2), which required elaborate cooling equipment. &quot;Castle Bravo&quot; was the first test by the United States of a practical deliverable fusion bomb, even though the TX-21 as proof-tested in the Bravo event was not weaponized. The successful test rendered obsolete the cryogenic design used by &quot;Ivy Mike&quot; and its weaponized derivative, the &quot;JUGHEAD&quot;, which was slated to be tested as the initial &quot;Castle Yankee&quot;. It also used a 7075 aluminum ballistic case. Aluminum was used to drastically reduce the bomb&#x27;s weight and simultaneously provided sufficient radiation confinement time to raise yield, a departure from the heavy stainless steel casing (304L or MIM 316L) employed by other weapon-projects at the time.

The &quot;SHRIMP&quot; was at least in theory and in many critical aspects identical in geometry to the &quot;RUNT&quot; and &quot;RUNT II&quot; devices later proof-fired in &quot;Castle Romeo&quot; and &quot;Castle Yankee&quot; respectively. On paper it was a scaled-down version of these devices, and its origins can be traced back to 1953. The United States Air Force indicated the importance of lighter thermonuclear weapons for delivery by the B-47 Stratojet and B-58 Hustler. Los Alamos National Laboratory responded to this indication with a follow-up enriched version of the &quot;RUNT&quot; scaled down to a 3/4 scale radiation-implosion system called the &quot;SHRIMP&quot;. The proposed weight reduction (from TX-17&#x27;s to TX-21&#x27;s ) would provide the Air Force with a much more versatile deliverable gravity bomb. The final version tested in &quot;Castle&quot; used partially enriched lithium as its fusion fuel. Natural lithium is a mixture of lithium-6 and lithium-7 isotopes (with 7.5% of the former). The enriched lithium used in &quot;Bravo&quot; was nominally 40% lithium-6 (the remainder was the much more common lithium-7, which was incorrectly assumed to be inert). The fuel slugs varied in enrichment from 37 to 40% in Li, and the slugs with lower enrichment were positioned at the end of the fusion-fuel chamber, away from the primary. The lower levels of lithium enrichment in the fuel slugs, compared with the &quot;ALARM CLOCK&quot; and many later hydrogen weapons, were due to shortages in enriched lithium at that time, as the first of the &quot;Alloy Development Plants&quot; (ADP) started production in late 1953. The volume of LiD fuel used was approximately 60% the volume of the fusion fuel filling used in the wet &quot;SAUSAGE&quot; and dry &quot;RUNT I&quot; and &quot;II&quot; devices, or about , corresponding to about 390 kg of lithium deuteride (as LiD has a density of 0.78201 g/cm3). The mixture cost about 4.54 USD/g at that time. The fusion burn efficiency was close to 25.1%, the highest attained efficiency of the first thermonuclear weapon generation. This efficiency is well within the figures given in a November 1956 statement, when a DOD official disclosed that thermonuclear devices with efficiencies ranging from 15% to up about 40% had been tested. Hans Bethe reportedly stated independently that the first generation of thermonuclear weapons had (fusion) efficiencies varying from as low as 15% to up about 25%.

The thermonuclear burn would produce (like the fission fuel in the primary) pulsations (generations) of high-energy neutrons with an average temperature of 14 MeV through Jetter&#x27;s cycle.

==== Jetter&#x27;s cycle ====

The Jetter cycle is a combination of reactions involving lithium, deuterium, and tritium. It consumes lithium-6 and deuterium, and in two reactions (with energies of 17.6 MeV and 4.8 MeV, mediated by a neutron and tritium) it produces two alpha particles.

The reaction would produce high-energy neutrons with 14 MeV, and its neutronicity was estimated at ≈0.885 (for a Lawson criterion of ≈1.5).

==== Possible additional tritium for high-yield ====
As &quot;SHRIMP&quot;, along with the &quot;RUNT I&quot; and &quot;ALARM CLOCK&quot;, were to be high-yield shots required to assure the thermonuclear &quot;emergency capability,&quot; their fusion fuel may have been spiked with additional tritium, in the form of LiT. All of the high-energy 14 MeV neutrons would cause fission in the uranium fusion tamper wrapped around the secondary and the spark plug&#x27;s plutonium rod. The ratio of deuterium (and tritium) atoms burned by 14 MeV neutrons spawned by the burning was expected to vary from 5:1 to 3:1, a standardization derived from &quot;Mike&quot;, while for these estimations, the ratio of 3:1 was predominantly used in ISRINEX. The neutronicity of the fusion reactions harnessed by the fusion tamper would dramatically increase the yield of the device.

=== &quot;SHRIMP&quot;″s indirect drive ===

Attached to the cylindrical ballistic case was a natural-uranium liner, the radiation case, that was about 2.5 cm thick. Its internal surface was lined with copper that was about 240 μm thick, and made from 0.08-μm thick copper foil, to increase the overall albedo of the hohlraum. Copper possesses excellent reflecting properties, and its low cost, compared to other reflecting materials like gold, made it useful for mass-produced hydrogen weapons. Hohlraum albedo is a very important design parameter for any inertial-confinement configuration. A relatively high albedo permits higher interstage coupling due to the more favorable azimuthal and latitudinal angles of reflected radiation. The limiting value of the albedo for high-&quot;Z&quot; materials is reached when the thickness is 5–10 g/cm, or 0.5–1.0 free paths. Thus, a hohlraum made of uranium much thicker than a free path of uranium would be needlessly heavy and costly. At the same time, the angular anisotropy increases as the atomic number of the scatterer material is reduced. Therefore, hohlraum liners require the use of copper (or, as in other devices, gold or aluminium), as the absorption probability increases with the value of &quot;Z&quot; of the scatterer. There are two sources of X-rays in the hohlraum: the primary&#x27;s irradiance, which is dominant at the beginning and during the pulse rise; and the wall, which is important during the required radiation temperature&#x27;s (&quot;T&quot;) plateau. The primary emits radiation in a manner similar to a flash bulb, and the secondary needs constant &quot;T&quot; to properly implode. This constant wall temperature is dictated by the ablation pressure requirements to drive compression, which lie on average at about 0.4 keV (out of a range of 0.2 to 2 keV), corresponding to several million kelvins. Wall temperature depended on the temperature of the primary&#x27;s core which peaked at about 5.4 keV during boosted-fission. The final wall-temperature, which corresponds to energy of the wall-reradiated X-rays to the secondary&#x27;s pusher, also drops due to losses from the hohlraum material itself. Natural uranium nails, lined to the top of their head with copper, attached the radiation case to the ballistic case. The nails were bolted in vertical arrays in a double-shear configuration to better distribute the shear loads. This method of attaching the radiation case to the ballistic case was first used successfully in the &quot;Ivy&quot; &quot;Mike&quot; device. The radiation case had a parabolic end, which housed the &quot;COBRA&quot; primary that was employed to create the conditions needed to start the fusion reaction, and its other end was a cylinder, as also seen in Bravo&#x27;s declassified film.

The space between the uranium &quot;fusion tamper&quot;, and the case formed a radiation channel to conduct X-rays from the primary to the secondary assembly; the interstage. It is one of the most closely guarded secrets of a multistage thermonuclear weapon. Implosion of the secondary assembly is indirectly driven, and the techniques used in the interstage to smooth the spatial profile (i.e. reduce coherence and nonuniformities) of the primary&#x27;s irradiance are of utmost importance. This was done with the introduction of the &quot;channel filler&quot;—an optical element used as a refractive medium, also encountered as &quot;random-phase plate&quot; in the ICF laser assemblies. This medium was a polystyrene plastic foam filling, extruded or impregnated with a low-molecular-weight hydrocarbon (possibly methane gas), which turned to a low-&quot;Z&quot; plasma from the X-rays, and along with channeling radiation it modulated the ablation front on the high-Z surfaces; it &quot;tamped&quot; the sputtering effect that would otherwise &quot;choke&quot; radiation from compressing the secondary. The reemitted X-rays from the radiation case must be deposited uniformly on the outer walls of the secondary&#x27;s tamper and ablate it externally, driving the thermonuclear fuel capsule (increasing the density and temperature of the fusion fuel) to the point needed to sustain a thermonuclear reaction. (see Nuclear weapon design). This point is above the threshold where the fusion fuel would turn opaque to its emitting radiation, as determined from its Rosseland opacity, meaning that the generated energy balances the energy lost to fuel&#x27;s vicinity (as radiation, particle losses). After all, for any hydrogen weapon system to work, this energy equilibrium must be maintained through the compression equilibrium between the fusion tamper and the spark plug (see below), hence their name &quot;equilibrium supers&quot;.
Since the ablative process takes place on both walls of the radiation channel, a numerical estimate made with ISRINEX (a thermonuclear explosion simulation program) suggested that the uranium tamper also had a thickness of 2.5 cm, so that an equal pressure would be applied to both walls of the hohlraum. The rocket effect on the surface of tamper&#x27;s wall created by the ablation of its several superficial layers would force an equal mass of uranium that rested in the remainder of the tamper to speed inwards, thus imploding the thermonuclear core. At the same time, the rocket effect on the surface of the hohlraum would force the radiation case to speed outwards. The ballistic case would confine the exploding radiation case for as long as necessary. The fact that the tamper material was uranium enriched in U is primarily based on the final fission reaction fragments detected in the radiochemical analysis, which conclusively showed the presence of U, found by the Japanese in the shot debris. The first-generation thermonuclear weapons (MK-14, 16, 17, 21, 22 and 24) all used uranium tampers enriched to 37.5% U. The exception to this was the MK-15 &quot;ZOMBIE&quot; that used a 93.5% enriched fission jacket.

=== The secondary assembly ===

The secondary assembly was the actual &quot;SHRIMP&quot; component of the weapon. The weapon, like most contemporary thermonuclear weapons at that time, bore the same codename as the secondary component. The secondary was situated in the cylindrical end of the device, where its end was locked to the radiation case by a type of mortise and tenon joint. The hohlraum at its cylindrical end had an internal projection, which nested the secondary and had better structural strength to support the secondary&#x27;s assembly, which had most of the device&#x27;s mass. A visualization to this is that the joint looked much like a cap (the secondary) fitted in a cone (the projection of the radiation case). Any other major supporting structure would interfere to radiation transfer from the primary to the secondary and complex vibrational behavior. With this form of joint bearing most of the structural loads of the secondary, the latter and the hohlraum-ballistic case ensemble behaved as a single mass sharing common eigenmodes. To reduce excessive loading of the joint, especially during deployment of the weapon, the forward section of the secondary (i.e. the thermal blast/heat shield) was anchored to the radiation case by a set of thin wires, which also aligned the center line of the secondary with the primary, as they diminished bending and torsional loads on the secondary, another technique adopted from the &quot;SAUSAGE&quot;. The secondary assembly was an elongated truncated cone. From its front part (excluding the blast-heat shield) to its aft section it was steeply tapered. Tapering was used for two reasons. First, radiation drops by the square of the distance, hence radiation coupling is relatively poor in the aftermost sections of the secondary. This made the use of a higher mass of the then scarce fusion fuel in the rear end of the secondary assembly ineffective and the overall design wasteful. This was also the reason why the lower-enriched slugs of fusion fuel were placed far aft of the fuel capsule. Second, as the primary could not illuminate the whole surface of the hohlraum, in part due to the large axial length of the secondary, relatively small solid angles would be effective to compress the secondary, leading to poor radiation focusing. By tapering the secondary, the hohlraum could be shaped as a cylinder in its aft section obviating the need to machine the radiation case to a parabola at both ends. This optimized radiation focusing and enabled a streamlined production line, as it was cheaper, faster and easier to manufacture a radiation case with only one parabolic end. The tapering in this design was much steeper than its cousins, the &quot;RUNT&quot;, and the &quot;ALARM CLOCK&quot; devices. &quot;SHRIMP&#x27;s&quot; tapering and its mounting to the hohlraum apparently made the whole secondary assembly resemble the body of a shrimp. The secondary&#x27;s length is defined by the two pairs of dark-colored diagnostic &quot;hot spot&quot; pipes attached to the middle and left section of the device. These pipe sections were in diameter and long and were butt-welded end-to-end to the ballistic case leading out to the top of the shot cab. They would carry the initial reaction&#x27;s light up to the array of 12 mirror towers built in an arc on the artificial shot island created for the event. From those pipes, mirrors would reflect early bomb light from the bomb casing to a series of remote high-speed cameras, and so that Los Alamos could determine both the simultaneity of the design (i.e. the time interval between primary&#x27;s firing and secondary&#x27;s ignition) and the thermonuclear burn rate in these two crucial areas of the secondary device.

This secondary assembly device contained the lithium deuteride fusion fuel in a stainless-steel canister. Running down to the center of the secondary was a 1.3 cm thick hollow cylindrical rod of plutonium, nested in the steel canister. This was the &quot;spark plug&quot;, a tritium-boosted fission device. It was assembled by plutonium rings and had a hollow volume inside that measured about 0.5 cm in diameter. This central volume was lined with copper, which like the liner in the primary&#x27;s fissile core prevented DT gas diffusion in plutonium. The spark plug&#x27;s boosting charge contained about 4 grams of tritium and, imploding together with the secondary&#x27;s compression, was timed to detonate by the first generations of neutrons that arrived from the primary. Timing was defined by the geometric characteristics of the sparkplug (its uncompressed annular radius), which detonated when its criticality, or &quot;k&quot;, transcended 1. Its purpose was to compress the fusion material around it from its inside, equally applying pressure with the tamper. The compression factor of the fusion fuel and its adiabatic compression energy determined the minimal energy required for the spark plug to counteract the compression of the fusion fuel and the tamper&#x27;s momentum. The spark plug weighed about 18 kg, and its initial firing yielded . Then it would be completely fissioned by the fusion neutrons, contributing about to the total yield. The energy required by the spark plug to counteract the compression of the fusion fuel was lower than the primary&#x27;s yield because coupling of the primary&#x27;s energy in the hohlraum is accompanied by losses due to the difference between the X-ray fireball and the hohlraum temperatures. The neutrons entered the assembly by a small hole through the ≈28 cm thick U blast-heat shield. It was positioned in front of the secondary assembly facing the primary. Similar to the tamper-fusion capsule assembly, the shield was shaped as a circular frustum, with its small diameter facing the primary&#x27;s side, and with its large diameter locked by a type of mortise and tenon joint to the rest of the secondary assembly. The shield-tamper ensemble can be visualized as a circular bifrustum. All parts of the tamper were similarly locked together to provide structural support and rigidity to the secondary assembly. Surrounding the fusion-fuel–spark-plug assembly was the uranium tamper with a standoff air-gap about 0.9 cm wide that was to increase the tamper&#x27;s momentum, a levitation technique used as early as &quot;Operation Sandstone&quot; and described by physicist Ted Taylor as &quot;hammer-on-the-nail-impact&quot;. Since there were also technical concerns that high-&quot;Z&quot; tamper material would mix rapidly with the relatively low-density fusion fuel—leading to unacceptably large radiation losses—the stand-off gap also acted as a buffer to mitigate the unavoidable and undesirable &quot;Taylor mixing&quot;.

=== Use of boron ===
Boron was used at many locations in this dry system; it has a high cross-section for the absorption of slow neutrons, which fission U and Pu, but a low cross-section for the absorption of fast neutrons, which fission U. Because of this characteristic, B deposited onto the surface of the secondary stage would prevent pre-detonation of the &quot;spark plug&quot; by stray neutrons from the primary without interfering with the subsequent fissioning of the U of the fusion tamper wrapping the secondary. Boron also played a role in increasing the compressive plasma pressure around the secondary by blocking the sputtering effect, leading to higher thermonuclear efficiency. Because the structural foam holding the secondary in place within the casing was doped with B, the secondary was compressed more highly, at a cost of some radiated neutrons. (The &quot;Castle Koon&quot; &quot;MORGENSTERN&quot; device did not use B in its design; as a result, the intense neutron flux from its &quot;RACER IV&quot; primary predetonated the spherical fission spark plug, which in turn &quot;cooked&quot; the fusion fuel, leading to an overall poor compression.) The plastic&#x27;s low molecular weight is unable to implode the secondary&#x27;s mass. Its plasma-pressure is confined in the boiled-off sections of the tamper and the radiation case so that material from neither of these two &quot;walls&quot; can enter the radiation channel that has to be open for the radiation transit.

== Detonation ==

The device was mounted in a &quot;shot cab&quot; on an artificial island built on a reef off Namu Island, in Bikini Atoll. A sizable array of diagnostic instruments were trained on it, including high-speed cameras trained through an arc of mirror towers around the shot cab.

The detonation took place at 06:45 on 1 March 1954, local time (18:45 on 28 February GMT).

When Bravo was detonated, within one second it formed a fireball almost across. This fireball was visible on Kwajalein Atoll over away. The explosion left a crater in diameter and in depth. The mushroom cloud reached a height of and a diameter of in about a minute, a height of and in diameter in less than 10 minutes and was expanding at more than . As a result of the blast, the cloud contaminated more than of the surrounding Pacific Ocean, including some of the surrounding small islands like Rongerik, Rongelap, and Utirik.
In terms of energy released (usually measured in TNT equivalence), &quot;Castle Bravo&quot; was about 1,000 times more powerful than the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima during World War II. &quot;Castle Bravo&quot; is the sixth largest nuclear explosion in history, exceeded by the Soviet tests of &quot;Tsar Bomba&quot; at approximately 50 Mt, &quot;Test 219&quot; at 24.2 Mt, and three other (&quot;Test 147&quot;, &quot;Test 173&quot; and &quot;Test 174&quot;) ≈20 Mt Soviet tests in 1962 at Novaya Zemlya.

=== High yield ===

The yield of 15 (± 5) Mt was triple that of the 5 Mt predicted by its designers. The cause of the higher yield was an error made by designers of the device at Los Alamos National Laboratory. They considered only the lithium-6 isotope in the lithium deuteride secondary to be reactive; the lithium-7 isotope, accounting for 60% of the lithium content, was assumed to be inert. It was expected that the lithium-6 isotope would absorb a neutron from the fissioning plutonium and emit an alpha particle and tritium in the process, of which the latter would then fuse with the deuterium and increase the yield in a predicted manner. Lithium-6 indeed reacted in this manner.

It was assumed that the lithium-7 would absorb one neutron, producing lithium-8, which decays (through beta decay into beryllium-8) to a pair of alpha particles on a timescale of nearly a second, vastly longer than the timescale of nuclear detonation. However, when lithium-7 is bombarded with energetic neutrons with an energy greater than 2.47 MeV, rather than simply absorbing a neutron, it undergoes nuclear fission into an alpha particle, a tritium nucleus, and another neutron. As a result, much more tritium was produced than expected, the extra tritium fusing with deuterium and producing an extra neutron. The extra neutron produced by fusion and the extra neutron released directly by lithium-7 decay produced a much larger neutron flux. The result was greatly increased fissioning of the uranium tamper and increased yield.

Summarizing, the reactions involving lithium-6 result in some combination of the two following net reactions:
:n + Li → H + He + 4.783 MeV
:Li + H → 2 He + 22.373 MeV
But when lithium-7 is present, one also has some amounts of the following two net reactions:
:Li + n → H + He + n
:Li + H → 2 He + n + 15.123 MeV

This resultant extra fuel (both lithium-6 and lithium-7) contributed greatly to the fusion reactions and neutron production and in this manner greatly increased the device&#x27;s explosive output. The test used lithium with a high percentage of lithium-7 only because lithium-6 was then scarce and expensive; the later &quot;Castle Union&quot; test used almost pure lithium-6. Had sufficient lithium-6 been available, the usability of the common lithium-7 might not have been discovered.

The unexpectedly high yield of the device severely damaged many of the permanent buildings on the control site island on the far side of the atoll. Little of the desired diagnostic data on the shot was collected; many instruments designed to transmit their data back before being destroyed by the blast were instead vaporized instantly, while most of the instruments that were expected to be recovered for data retrieval were destroyed by the blast.

In an additional unexpected event, albeit one of far less consequence, X-rays traveling through line-of-sight (LOS) pipes caused a small second fireball at Station 1200 with a yield of .

== High levels of fallout ==
The fission reactions of the natural uranium tamper were quite dirty, producing a large amount of fallout. That, combined with the larger than expected yield and a major wind shift, produced some very serious consequences for those in the fallout range. In the declassified film &quot;Operation Castle&quot;, the task force commander Major General Percy Clarkson pointed to a diagram indicating that the wind shift was still in the range of &quot;acceptable fallout&quot;, although just barely.

The decision to carry out the Bravo test under the prevailing winds was made by Dr. Alvin C. Graves, the Scientific Director of Operation Castle. Graves had total authority over detonating the weapon, above that of the military commander of Operation Castle. Graves appears in the widely available film of the earlier 1952 test &quot;Ivy Mike&quot;, which examines the last-minute fallout decisions. The narrator, the western actor Reed Hadley, is filmed aboard the control ship in that film, showing the final conference. Hadley points out that 20,000 people live in the potential area of the fallout. He asks the control panel scientist if the test can be aborted and is told &quot;yes&quot;, but it would ruin all their preparations in setting up timed measuring instruments. In Mike, the fallout correctly landed north of the inhabited area but, in the 1954 Bravo test, there was a large amount of wind shear, and the wind that was blowing north the day before the test steadily veered towards the east.

=== Inhabited islands affected ===

Radioactive fallout was spread eastward onto the inhabited Rongelap and Rongerik atolls, which were evacuated 48 hours after the detonation. In 1957, the Atomic Energy Commission deemed Rongelap safe to return, and allowed 82 inhabitants to move back to the island. Upon their return, they discovered that their previous staple foods, including arrowroot, makmok, and fish, had either disappeared or gave residents various illnesses, and they were again removed. Ultimately, 15 islands and atolls were contaminated, and by 1963 Marshall Islands natives began to suffer from thyroid tumors, including 20 of 29 Rongelap children at the time of Bravo, and many birth defects were reported. The islanders received compensation from the U.S. government, relative to how much contamination they received, beginning in 1956; by 1995 the Nuclear Claims Tribunal reported that it had awarded $43.2 million, nearly its entire fund, to 1,196 claimants for 1,311 illnesses. A medical study, named Project 4.1, studied the effects of the fallout on the islanders.

Although the atmospheric fallout plume drifted eastward, once fallout landed in the water it was carried in several directions by ocean currents, including northwest and southwest.

=== Fishing boats ===

A Japanese fishing boat, (Lucky Dragon No. 5), came in direct contact with the fallout, which caused many of the crew to grow ill due to radiation sickness. One member died of a secondary infection six months later after acute radiation exposure, and another had a child that was stillborn and deformed. This resulted in an international incident and reignited Japanese concerns about radiation, especially as Japanese citizens were once more adversely affected by US nuclear weapons. The official US position had been that the growth in the strength of atomic bombs was not accompanied by an equivalent growth in radioactivity released, and they denied that the crew was affected by radioactive fallout, despite data from the Japanese fishing vessel and other international sources showing the contrary.

Sir Joseph Rotblat, working at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital, London, demonstrated that the contamination caused by the fallout from the test was far greater than that stated officially. Rotblat deduced that the bomb had three stages and showed that the fission phase at the end of the explosion increased the amount of radioactivity a thousand-fold. Rotblat&#x27;s paper was taken up by the media, and the outcry in Japan reached such a level that diplomatic relations became strained and the incident was even dubbed by some as a &quot;second Hiroshima&quot;. Nevertheless, the Japanese and US governments quickly reached a political settlement, with the transfer to Japan of $15.3 million as compensation, with the surviving victims receiving about  million each ($5,550 in 1954, or about $ in 2025). It was also agreed that the victims would not be given Hibakusha status.

In 2016, 45 Japanese fishermen from other ships sued their government for not disclosing records about their exposure to Operation Castle fallout. Records released in 2014 acknowledge that the crews of 10 ships were exposed but under health-damaging levels. In 2018 the suit was rejected by the Kochi District Court, who acknowledged the fishermen&#x27;s radiation exposure but could not &quot;conclude that the state persistently gave up providing support and conducting health surveys to hide the radiation exposure&quot;.
=== Bomb test personnel take shelter ===

Unanticipated fallout and the radiation emitted by it also affected many of the vessels and personnel involved in the test, in some cases forcing them into bunkers for several hours. In contrast to the crew of the &quot;&quot;, who did not anticipate the hazard and therefore did not take shelter in the hold of their ship, or refrain from inhaling the fallout dust, the firing crew that triggered the explosion safely sheltered in their firing station when they noticed the wind was carrying the fallout in the unanticipated direction towards the island of Enyu on the Bikini Atoll where they were located, with the fire crew sheltering in place (&quot;buttoning up&quot;) for several hours until outside radiation decayed to safer levels. &quot;25 roentgens per hour&quot; was recorded above the bunker.

=== US Navy ships affected ===

The US Navy tanker was at Enewetak Atoll in late February 1954. &quot;Patapsco&quot; lacked a decontamination washdown system, and was therefore ordered on 27 February, to return to Pearl Harbor at the highest possible speed. A breakdown in her engine systems, namely a cracked cylinder liner, slowed &quot;Patapsco&quot; to one-third of her full speed, and when the Castle Bravo detonation took place, she was still about 180 to 195 nautical miles east of Bikini. &quot;Patapsco&quot; was in the range of nuclear fallout, which began landing on the ship in the mid-afternoon of 2 March. By this time &quot;Patapsco&quot; was 565 to 586 nautical miles from ground zero. The fallout was at first thought to be harmless and there were no radiation detectors aboard, so no decontamination measures were taken. Measurements taken after &quot;Patapsco&quot; had returned to Pearl Harbor suggested an exposure range of 0.18 to 0.62 R/hr. Total exposure estimates range from 3.3 R to 18 R of whole-body radiation, taking into account the effects of natural washdown from rain, and variations between above- and below-deck exposure.

=== International incident ===

The fallout spread traces of radioactive material as far as Australia, India and Japan, and even the United States and parts of Europe. Though organized as a secret test, Castle Bravo quickly became an international incident, prompting calls for a ban on the atmospheric testing of thermonuclear devices.

A worldwide network of gummed film stations was established to monitor fallout following Operation Castle. Although meteorological data was poor, a general connection of tropospheric flow patterns with observed fallout was evident. There was a tendency for fallout/debris to remain in tropical latitudes, with incursions into the temperate regions associated with meteorological disturbances of the predominantly zonal flow. Outside of the tropics, the Southwestern United States received the greatest total fallout, about five times that received in Japan.

Stratospheric fallout particles of strontium-90 from the test were later captured with balloon-borne air filters used to sample the air at stratospheric altitudes; the research (Project Ashcan) was conducted to better understand the stratosphere and fallout times, and arrive at more accurate meteorological models after hindcasting.

The fallout from &quot;Castle Bravo&quot; and other testing on the atoll also affected islanders who had previously inhabited the atoll, and who returned there some time after the tests. This was due to the presence of radioactive caesium-137 in locally grown coconut milk. Plants and trees absorb potassium as part of the normal biological process, but will also readily absorb caesium if present, being of the same group on the periodic table, and therefore very similar chemically. Islanders consuming contaminated coconut milk were found to have abnormally high concentrations of caesium in their bodies and so had to be evacuated from the atoll a second time.

The American magazine &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; warned of the contamination of milk with strontium-90.

== Impact on US policy ==
The test caused a reassessment of US policies towards nuclear weapons and energy in order to contend with massive international backlash that declared the disaster &quot;intolerable&quot;. The following year&#x27;s Russell–Einstein Manifesto explicitly focused on the hydrogen bomb&#x27;s threat to human existence demonstrated by the test:

In May 1954 National Security Council meeting, President Dwight D. Eisenhower said &quot;everybody seems to think that we are skunks, saber-rattlers, and warmongers.&quot; Secretary of State John Foster Dulles said &quot;comparisons are now being made between ours and Hitler&#x27;s military machine.&quot;

Attempts to repair this image included the yield and fallout limiting of all future tests, and an emphasis on peaceful nuclear energy production, from both nascent fission reactor plants and speculative fusion implosion facilities.

=== Nuclear testing policies ===

==== Total yield and fission yield energy budgets ====
Following the disaster and higher-than-expected yields throughout Operation Castle (48.2 Mt total yield to the expected 23 Mt), US policy on thermonuclear testing in the Pacific changed. In 1956, Operation Redwing was conducted on an &quot;energy budget&quot;, limiting the total testing yield to 20 Mt, and specifically limiting the fission yield, contentiously divided between Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory and University of California Radiation Laboratory at Livermore. While some very &quot;dirty&quot; fission weapons were tested, this also began the usage of the &quot;materials substitution method&quot;, where the fission product fallout-producing uranium-238 tamper was replaced with a &quot;clean&quot; lead tamper, at the cost of halving the yield. 

==== 15 megaton yield standard ====
In 1958, during preparation for Operation Hardtack I, the second round of thermonuclear testing since Castle, President Eisenhower established an unwritten rule that no single American test could exceed the 15 Mt yield of Castle Bravo. His successor, president John F. Kennedy adhered to this standard, even following the 50 Mt Soviet Tsar Bomba test in 1961 and pressure from the Department of Defense, Atomic Energy Commission, and the Livermore laboratory. Following the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty against non-underground tests, American testing continued underground, with the largest yield in the 1971 Grommet Cannikin test at 5 Mt.

=== Impact on scientific direction ===

==== Fission energy ====

The US government&#x27;s attempts at public relations damage control focused around the existing language of the Atoms for Peace initiative launched four months prior, expanding to the concept of the &quot;peaceful thermonuclear atom&quot;. Speaking at a conference six months later, Lewis Strauss, the chair of the Atomic Energy Commission and a primary influence in the crash program of hydrogen bomb development, famously promised a peaceful era of nuclear energy:

The Soviet Union had already announced electrical grid connection of the Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant on 27 June. The United States would achieve this briefly with the BORAX-III reactor in 1955 and permanently with the Shippingport Atomic Power Station in 1957.

==== Fusion energy ====

===== Energy from conventional yields =====

In 1957, hydrogen bomb architect Edward Teller and other Livermore weapons scientists proposed a gigawatt-level electrical plant, based on steam generation from 1 megaton bombs dropped every 12 hours into a 1,000 ft cavity. American research on such plants continued throughout the Cold War.

===== Energy from minimal yields =====

Livermore scientist John Nuckolls began a &quot;hectoton group&quot; (100 tons) at the laboratory, investigating ways to remove the fission primary and inventing the concept of low-yield implosions of deuterium-tritium pellets i.e. inertial confinement fusion.

== Weapon history ==

The Soviet Union had previously used lithium deuteride in its Sloika design (known as the &quot;Joe-4&quot; in the U.S.), in 1953. It was not a true hydrogen bomb; fusion provided only 15–20% of its yield, most coming from boosted fission reactions. Its yield was 400 kilotons, and it could not be infinitely scaled, as with a true thermonuclear device.

The Teller–Ulam-based &quot;Ivy Mike&quot; device had a much greater yield of 10.4 Mt, but most of this also came from fission: 77% of the total came from fast fission of its natural-uranium tamper.

Castle Bravo had the greatest yield of any U.S. nuclear test, 15 Mt, though again, a substantial fraction came from fission. In the Teller–Ulam design, the fission and fusion stages were kept physically separate in a reflective cavity. The radiation from the exploding fission primary brought the fuel in the fusion secondary to critical density and pressure, setting off thermonuclear (fusion) chain reactions, which in turn set off a tertiary fissioning of the bomb&#x27;s U fusion tamper and casing. Consequently, this type of bomb is also known as a &quot;fission-fusion-fission&quot; device. The Soviet researchers, led by Andrei Sakharov, developed and tested their first Teller–Ulam device in 1955.

The publication of the Bravo fallout analysis was a militarily sensitive issue, with Joseph Rotblat possibly deducing the staging nature of the Castle Bravo device by studying the ratio and presence of tell-tale isotopes, namely uranium-237, present in the fallout. This information could potentially reveal the means by which megaton-yield nuclear devices achieve their yield. Soviet scientist Andrei Sakharov hit upon what the Soviet Union regarded as &quot;Sakharov&#x27;s third idea&quot; during the month after the Castle Bravo test, the final piece of the puzzle being the idea that the compression of the secondary can be accomplished by the primary&#x27;s X-rays before fusion began.

The Shrimp device design later evolved into the Mark 21 nuclear bomb, of which 275 units were produced, weighing and measuring long and in diameter. This 18-megaton bomb was produced until July 1956. In 1957, it was converted into the Mark 36 nuclear bomb and entered into production again.
== Health impacts ==

Following the test, the United States Department of Energy estimated that 253 inhabitants of the Marshall Islands were impacted by the radioactive fallout. This single test exposed the surrounding populations to varying levels of radiation. The fallout levels attributed to the Castle Bravo test are the highest in history. Populations neighboring the test site were exposed to high levels of radiation resulting in mild radiation sickness of many (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The unexpected strength of the detonation, combined with shifting wind patterns, sent some of the radioactive fallout over the inhabited atolls of Rongelap and Utrik. Within 52 hours, the 86 people on Rongelap and 167 on Utrik were evacuated to Kwajalein for medical care. Several weeks later, many people began suffering from alopecia (hair loss) and skin lesions.

The exposure to fallout has been linked to increase the likelihood of several types of cancer such as leukemia and thyroid cancer. The relationship between iodine-131 levels and thyroid cancer is still being researched. There are also correlations between fallout exposure levels and diseases such as thyroid disease like hypothyroidism. Populations of the Marshall Islands that received significant exposure to radionuclides have a much greater risk of developing cancer.

There is a presumed association between radiation levels and functioning of the female reproductive system.

== In popular culture ==

The Castle Bravo detonation and the subsequent poisoning of the crew aboard &quot;Daigo Fukuryū Maru&quot; led to an increase in antinuclear protests in Japan. It was compared to the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the Castle Bravo test was frequently part of the plots of numerous Japanese media, especially in relation to Japan&#x27;s most widely recognized media icon, Godzilla. In the 2019 film &quot;&quot;, Castle Bravo becomes the call sign for Monarch Outpost 54 located in the Atlantic Ocean, near Bermuda.

The Donald Fagen song &quot;Memorabilia&quot; from his 2012 album &quot;Sunken Condos&quot; mentions both the Castle Bravo and Ivy King nuclear tests.

In 2013, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency published &quot;Castle Bravo: Fifty Years of Legend and Lore&quot;. The report is a guide to off-site radiation exposures, a narrative history, and a guide to primary historical references concerning the Castle Bravo test. The report focuses on the circumstances that resulted in radioactive exposure of the uninhabited atolls, and makes no attempt to address in detail the effects on or around Bikini Atoll.

<text>The Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) is a public graduate school operated by the United States Navy and located in Monterey, California.

It offers master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees in more than 70 fields of study to the U.S. Armed Forces, Department of Defense civilians and international partners. Established in 1909, the school also offers research fellowship opportunities at the postdoctoral level through the National Academies&#x27; National Research Council research associateship program.

== History ==

On 9 June 1909, Secretary of the Navy George von L. Meyer signed General Order No. 27, establishing a school of marine engineering at Annapolis, Maryland.

On 31 October 1912, Meyer signed Navy General Order No. 233, which renamed the school the Postgraduate Department of the United States Naval Academy. The order established courses of study in ordnance and gunnery, electrical engineering, radio telegraphy, naval construction, and civil engineering and continued the program in marine engineering.

During World War II, Fleet Admiral Ernest King, Chief of Naval Operations and Commander-in-Chief United States Fleet, established a commission to review the role of graduate education in the Navy. In 1945, Congress passed legislation to make the school a fully accredited, degree-granting graduate institution. Two years later, Congress adopted legislation authorizing the purchase of an independent campus for the school.

A postwar review team, which had examined 25 sites nationwide, had recommended the old Hotel Del Monte in Monterey, California as a new home for the Postgraduate School. During World War II, the Navy had leased the facilities, first for a pre-flight training school, then for part of the Electronics Training Program. Negotiations with the Del Monte Properties Company led to the purchase of the hotel and of surrounding land for $2.13 million.

The Naval Postgraduate School moved to Monterey in December 1951. Today, the school has over 40 programs of study including highly regarded M.S. and PhD programs in management, national security affairs, electrical and computer engineering, mechanical and astronautical engineering, systems engineering, space systems and satellite engineering, physics, oceanography meteorology, and other disciplines, all with an emphasis on military applications.

Former Guantanamo Bay Naval Base commander and World War II and Korean War veteran, RADM Edward J. O&#x27;Donnell, assumed the role as superintendent of the school in 1965. He himself graduated from the school in the 1930s with a degree in ordnance engineering. He would leave the role of superintendent in 1967 after retiring from the Navy.

The Naval Postgraduate School has graduated more than 40 astronauts, greater than any other graduate school in the country. The school is home to the Center for Information Systems Security Studies and Research (CISR) and the Center for Homeland Defense and Security (CHDS). CISR is America&#x27;s foremost center for defense-related research and education in Information Assurance (IA), Inherently Trustworthy Systems (ITC), and defensive information warfare; and CHDS provides the first homeland security master&#x27;s degree in the United States.

On 27 November 2012, Vice Admiral Daniel T. Oliver (retired) and Provost Dr. Leonard Ferrari were relieved of duty by Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus. A Navy press release cited findings from a Naval Inspector General investigation which included Oliver&#x27;s misuse of standard contracting procedures to circumvent federal hiring and compensation authorities. The investigation also found that both Oliver and Ferrari &quot;inappropriately accepted gifts from an independent private foundation organized to support the school.&quot;

In October 2013, retired Vice Adm. Ronald A. Route became the second civilian president of the Naval Postgraduate School. Vice Adm. Ann E. Rondeau relieved Route to become the 49th president of the university in January 2019.

In 2019, NPS renamed its business school, the Graduate School of Business and Public Policy, to the Graduate School of Defense Management (GSDM) in an effort to better signal its unique defense-focused identity and mission to strategic stakeholders and its academic peers. GSDM offers degree programs in nine different fields, ranging from logistics to information technology management to manpower, as well as three, unique distance learning programs.

In December 2020, NPS leadership officially commissioned the Wayne P. Hughes Jr. Naval Warfare Studies Institute (NWSI) NWSI&#x27;s mission is to expedite the DON&#x27;s access to the university&#x27;s intellect and resources for solving warfighting issues. NWSI consists of NPS&#x27; Senior Service Representatives and Warfare Chairs, as well as the Military Associate Deans of all four NPS graduate schools (international studies, operational and information sciences, engineering and applied sciences, and defense management). NWSI provides operational and functional expertise as well as access to all areas of study and research, every faculty member and the entire student body. NWSI also partners with outside entities, including the Naval War College, that complement their educational and research activities.

In 2021, NPS refurbished a county wastewater treatment plant into an all-domain defense technology lab, The Sea Land Air Military Research (SLAMR) lab. Situated just across the street from NPS&#x27;s main campus, the SLAMR facility houses a series of open-air water treatment tanks that were recently renovated and now serve as SLAMR&#x27;s aquatic environment laboratory. SLAMR uses the existing infrastructure, such as multiple 450,000 gallon water tanks that have been recently cleaned and renovated, as an affordable and sustainable location for research projects focusing on national defense applications in robotics, autonomous systems, cybersecurity and maritime related 5G telecommunications.

The SLAMR lab site will see moderate day-to-day activity with a handful of researchers on site, and with its water-based capabilities, it will also be a key venue for NPS&#x27; quarterly Joint Interagency Field Experimentation (JIFX) event that hosts research collaborators from around the country. The location also provides a great site for youth STEM activities and the SLAMR lab has already hosted a regional high school underwater robotics competition.

Emergency responders including local, tribal, state, and federal can enroll in a variety of programs including online distributed learning program, executive education programs, and most prominently a Master of Arts program.

Masters of Arts Program
The M.A. program is offered at no cost to eligible local, tribal, state, and federal officials. To accommodate participants&#x27; time constraints, NPS requires students to be in residence only two weeks every quarter (for a total of twelve weeks for the whole program). Students complete the remainder of their coursework online.

===Students===
NPS students are mostly active-duty officers from all branches of the U.S. military, although U.S. government civilians and officers from approximately 30 partner countries can also matriculate under a variety of programs. Most of the faculty are civilians.

<text>Friendship is a neighborhood of large Victorian houses in the East End of the City of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, about four miles (6 km) east of Pittsburgh&#x27;s Golden Triangle. Friendship is bordered on the north by Garfield (at Penn Avenue), on the east by East Liberty (at Negley Avenue), on the south by Shadyside (at Centre Avenue), and on the west by Bloomfield (at Graham Street, according to the City of Pittsburgh). It is divided into three Pittsburgh City Council districts (7, 8, and 9).

== History ==

The City of Pittsburgh annexed the East End in 1868. What is now Bloomfield was developed first and was divided into narrow plots and used for rowhouses. The Roup holdings—today&#x27;s Friendship—began to be developed later, when trolleys running along Baum Boulevard extended beyond Bloomfield in the 1890s.

Friendship was therefore built as a streetcar suburb, and its houses are large, square homes with elaborate architectural embellishments designed for professional-class families in the Victorian period. As a streetcar suburb, Friendship lacks its own business district, but its residents have access to shopping on Penn Avenue in nearby Garfield and East Liberty, on Liberty Avenue in Bloomfield, and on Walnut Street in Shadyside.

From the 1890s through the 1950s, Friendship was inhabited by prosperous families. Beginning around 1960, many of these families moved to the suburbs: they were attracted by perceived opportunities outside the city, and repulsed by the construction of massive housing projects in nearby Garfield, and by a misguided urban renewal project&#x27;s wholesale demolition of East Liberty. After a zoning change in the 1950s, landlords broke the massive old Victorian houses up into multi-unit apartments, and ripped out or painted over many of their amenities in the process. By the 1980s, over 70% of the housing stock in Friendship was owned by landlords, many absentee.

Friendship experienced something of a second birth in the late 1980s. Urban homesteaders began to move into Friendship, looking past the blight to see an opportunity to buy large homes with features—high ceilings, plaster walls, stained-glass windows, and ornate woodwork—that were not available in newer suburban homes.

Because these new residents were focused on the housing stock, they saw Friendship as a unique neighborhood in its own right, with homes distinct from those in any of the bordering neighborhoods. By the early 1990s, the newcomers had succeeded in getting the neighborhood known as &quot;Friendship,&quot; and had organized a Friendship Preservation Group to advocate for the area, and a subsidiary, the Friendship Development Associates, to buy and rehabilitate the most dilapidated properties. By 2004, a number of artists and architects had gravitated to the neighborhood, and its future seemed bright.

== Name and identity ==

Friendship takes its name from Friendship Avenue, an east-west thoroughfare that runs from Bloomfield to East Liberty. Some residents claim that Friendship Avenue is named after an alleged friendship between Joseph Conrad Winebiddle and William Penn. But this is a myth: the men were not contemporaries, and William Penn never visited Western Pennsylvania. Friendship Avenue in fact takes its name from a local farm that stood at the corner of Friendship and Roup and was named &quot;Friendship&quot; by its owner, one of Penn&#x27;s descendants, who like Penn was a member of the religious Society of Friends.

As a wholly residential neighborhood, Friendship lacked an initial identity: early residents considered themselves to be living, not in Friendship, but in the nearest neighborhood with a business district. Since the 1990s newer residents, who are focused on the housing stock that makes Friendship distinct from its neighbors, and are often involved in organizations like the Friendship Preservation Group, have successfully encouraged the wider Pittsburgh community to call the area &quot;Friendship&quot; and to consider it as a unique neighborhood.

== Border Dispute ==

Because &quot;Friendship&quot; is a new name for an old neighborhood, Friendship&#x27;s western border with Bloomfield is to some extent a disputed one. The City of Pittsburgh defines neighborhoods to be contiguous with federal census tracts, and as a result considers Friendship to abut Bloomfield at South Graham Street, at the western edge of census tract 807. However, the Friendship Community Group considers the border between Bloomfield and Friendship to lie at Gross Street. This western boundary includes census tract 806 and parts of tract 809, and corresponds to City of Pittsburgh zoning maps from the 1920s, but were defined by neighborhood surveys between 1990 and 1994, in which residents of Friendship, Garfield, Bloomfield, and Lawrenceville were asked to identify their own neighborhood.

== Work ==

Friendship is a strictly residential neighborhood, but many residents are employed by nearby hospitals and universities, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University. Friendship is within easy walking distance of UPMC – Shadyside, West Penn Hospital, and the new Children&#x27;s Hospital on Penn Avenue and is about a half-hour on foot from the hospitals and universities in Oakland.

<text>Nelson Kiyoshi Doi (, January 1, 1922 – May 16, 2015), was the sixth lieutenant governor of Hawaii from 1974 to 1978 in the first elected administration of Governor George Ariyoshi. Doi was a member of the Hawaii Democratic Party.

==Early and legislative years==
Doi grew up in Hilo and Kawaihae on the island of Hawai&#x27;i and attended Honoka&#x27;a High School. He went on to attend the University of Hawaii, where he was president of the Associated Students of the University of Hawaii from December 1944 to June 1945.

Doi began his political career at the 1950 Hawaii State Constitutional Convention that drafted the first state laws for Hawaii that went into effect in 1959. During that Convention, Doi noted &quot;a frustration that began to ferment&quot; amongst the delegates. In the 1954 election, that frustration led to a huge victory for the Democrats, who seized control of what had been a territory dominated by Republicans. Doi, representing Hawaii Island, was one of the victorious Democrats. Other Democrats first elected in 1954 included the late U.S. Senator Dan Inouye, former Governor George Ariyoshi, the late U.S. Senator Spark Matsunaga.

After that victory in 1954, Doi then served in the Hawaii Territorial Senate in 1955–1959 and then in the Hawaii State Senate from 1959 to 1969, including as Senate President from 1963 to 1964. During his tenure in the Senate, Doi was frequently at odds with Governor John A. Burns and Senate Democratic leaders.

In 1968, Doi was one of 82 delegates to the Hawaii Constitutional Convention held at McKinley High School. Among the issues addressed at the Convention were reapportioning legislative districts, mandating an annual 60-day legislative session, lengthening the terms of judges, authorizing collective bargaining for public employees, strengthening privacy rights for individuals, enhancing county home rule, and creating the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. Other prominent political figures who were among the delegates were George Ariyoshi, Frank Fasi, and Patricia Saiki.

==Judiciary and lieutenant governor==
In 1970, Doi left the Hawaii State Legislature, after being appointed to the Hawaii State Judiciary as a circuit court judge where he served for five years. Also in 1970, Doi entered the race for Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii, at first aligning himself with fellow Democrat and gubernatorial candidate Thomas Gill. After disagreements with Gill on commitments on political appointments, Doi decided to run independently. Ultimately, both Gill and Doi were defeated by John A. Burns and George Ariyoshi, respectively.

In 1974, Doi was chosen as the running mate for George Ariyoshi. Fourteen months earlier, Ariyoshi, the previous Lieutenant Governor, became Acting Governor upon the incapacitating illness of longtime Governor John A. Burns. Ariyoshi and Doi emerged victorious, becoming the first-ever Japanese Americans to hold simultaneously the Governor and Lieutenant Governor posts of any state in the U.S. Doi was the second Japanese American to hold the position of state Lieutenant Governor.

==Later years==
After his service as Lieutenant Governor, Doi ran for Mayor of Honolulu and was defeated by Frank Fasi. Doi also ran in the 1977 Honolulu Marathon, finishing in 4 hours, 30 minutes, and &quot;besting his wife by just one minute&quot;. In 1977, he also was appointed to then-territorial High Court of the Marshall Islands. Doi was appointed as Chief Justice of the court in 1985. Upon his retirement from that court, Doi taught at various schools in Japan. Doi returned to Waimea on the Big Island of Hawaii where he helped build the North Hawaii Community Hospital.

<doc id="827632" wikidata="Q4958844" url="?curid=827632" title="Jean King">
<text>Jean Sadako King (née McKillop; born December 6, 1925 – November 24, 2013) was the seventh lieutenant governor of Hawaii, the state&#x27;s first woman to be elected as such, from 1978 to 1982 in the administration of Governor George Ariyoshi.

== Family ==
Jean Sadako King was the daughter of William Donald McKillop and Chiyo Murakami McKillop. They married in the early 1920s. Her father, William Donald McKillop, was a postmaster of Scottish descent, whereas her mother, Chiyo Murakami Mckillop, was Japanese. Chiyo came from a family of coffee farmers in Kona. King&#x27;s parents&#x27; interracial relationship was not common during that era. The couple settled in an area near Piikoi and Beretania in Honolulu, where King was born and raised. Later, King married James A. King and had a son and a daughter.

==Education==

King moved around throughout her years in primary school, having attended Likelike School, Aliiolani School, and the English Standard School. During her years in high school, she graduated as valedictorian at the Sacred Hearts Academy. King participated in various after-school activities while attending the Sacred Hearts Academy and was involved in Japanese dancing, tap, hula, and typing and shorthand lessons.

For her years in college, King was enrolled in the University of Hawaii, graduating with a B.A. in English by 1948. As an undergraduate student, she worked as a class assistant in a psychology lab, tutored English for a sports team, and served as a class officer. She was the co-editor for &quot;Ka Leo&quot;, which was the school newspaper in the University of Hawaii. Aside from King&#x27;s academic strides, she won two pageants, taking the crown for Ka Palalpala Cosmopolitan Beauty Queen and Relay Rainbow Queen. After obtaining her B.A. from the University of Hawaii, King went for an M.A. in history at New York University. Then years later, King went back to the University of Hawaii for another master&#x27;s. By 1968, King obtained her M.F.A. in theatre and drama. Her second master&#x27;s thesis was putting together a production for a play, and she chose to base it on a play by Miyamato Ken about the Japanese anti-war.

==Political career==
=== Hawaii State Legislature ===
Before King served in the Hawaii House of Representatives from 1972 to 1974 and the Hawaii Senate from 1974 to 1978, she was a candidate in the Hawai&#x27;i Constitutional Convention of 1950. King&#x27;s parents supported the Republican Party, but King wanted to push for more people to join the Democratic Party. She felt that the philosophy of the Democratic Party would be of more interest in Hawaii&#x27;s population of diverse ethnic backgrounds. While strongly encouraging the public to be more involved with the politics, King was able to make laws pass that allowed the public to attend the meetings of government officials.

=== Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii (1978–1982) ===
In 1978, King pursued the position of Lieutenant Governor of Hawai&#x27;i after Nelson Doi left the office to run for Mayor of Honolulu. King won the election and served with Governor George Ariyoshi in his second term from 1978 to 1982.

=== 1982 Hawaii gubernatorial campaign ===

After one term as Lieutenant Governor, King challenged Ariyoshi in the 1982 Democratic primary election for Governor. She lost with 105,969 votes to 127,906 votes for Ariyoshi, or 44.6 percent to 53.3 percent. After the election, King chose to retire from electoral politics.

==Death and legacy==
According to her granddaughter, King died at age 87 from pancreatic cancer on November 24, 2013. With the effort and strides that King made, she had been an influence for more women to run for political positions in Hawaii. Senator Mazie Hirono was one of the women who admired King and remembered her with &quot;As the first person elected to the office of lieutenant governor, Jean helped paved the way for women, such as myself.&quot; Colleen Hanabusa recognized King as a female role model.
In March 2016, &quot;Hawaiʻi Magazine&quot; ranked King in a list of the most influential women in Hawaiian history.

<text>In computer science, learning vector quantization (LVQ) is a prototype-based supervised classification algorithm. LVQ is the supervised counterpart of vector quantization systems.

== Overview ==
LVQ can be understood as a special case of an artificial neural network, more precisely, it applies a winner-take-all Hebbian learning-based approach. It is a precursor to self-organizing maps (SOM) and related to neural gas and the k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN). LVQ was invented by Teuvo Kohonen.

An LVQ system is represented by prototypes formula_1 which are defined in the feature space of observed data. In winner-take-all training algorithms one determines, for each data point, the prototype which is closest to the input according to a given distance measure. The position of this so-called winner prototype is then adapted, i.e. the winner is moved closer if it correctly classifies the data point or moved away if it classifies the data point incorrectly.

An advantage of LVQ is that it creates prototypes that are easy to interpret for experts in the respective application domain.
LVQ systems can be applied to multi-class classification problems in a natural way. 

A key issue in LVQ is the choice of an appropriate measure of distance or similarity for training and classification. Recently, techniques have been developed which adapt a parameterized distance measure in the course of training the system, see e.g. (Schneider, Biehl, and Hammer, 2009) and references therein.

LVQ can be a source of great help in classifying text documents.

==Algorithm==
Below follows an informal description.&lt;br&gt;
The algorithm consists of three basic steps. The algorithm&#x27;s input is:
* how many neurons the system will have formula_2 (in the simplest case it is equal to the number of classes)
* what weight each neuron has formula_3 for formula_4
* the corresponding label formula_5 to each neuron formula_6
* how fast the neurons are learning formula_7
* and an input list formula_8 containing all the vectors of which the labels are known already (training set).

The algorithm&#x27;s flow is:
# For next input formula_9 (with label formula_10) in formula_8 find the closest neuron formula_12, &lt;br&gt;i.e. formula_13, where formula_14 is the metric used ( Euclidean, etc. )

<doc id="827638" wikidata="Q1754722" url="?curid=827638" title="Mock execution">
<text>A mock execution is a stratagem in which a victim is deliberately but falsely made to feel that their execution or that of another person is imminent or is taking place. This might involve blindfolding the subjects, telling them they are about to die, making them recount last wishes, making them dig their own grave, holding an unloaded gun to their head and pulling the trigger, shooting near (but not at) the victim, or firing blanks. Mock execution is categorized as psychological torture. There is a sense of fear induced when a person is made to feel that they are about to be executed or witness someone being executed. The psychological trauma can lead to depression, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and other mental disorders.

== Historical instances ==
* In 1849, members of Russian political discussion group the Petrashevsky Circle, including writer Fyodor Dostoevsky, were convicted for high treason and sentenced to execution by firing squad. The sentences were commuted to hard labour secretly and the prisoners were told only after all the preparations for execution had been carried out. Dostoevsky described the experience in his novel &quot;The Idiot&quot;. 
* In 1968, Commander Lloyd M. Bucher, Commander of the &quot;USS Pueblo&quot;, was tortured and put through a mock firing squad by North Korean interrogators in an effort to make him confess.
* The American hostages held by Iran in 1979 were subjected to a mock execution by their detainers.
* Reports of mock executions carried out by the US Marines on detainees in Iraq surfaced in December 2004, as the American Civil Liberties Union published internal documents of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. The documents were written seven weeks after the publication of the photographs which triggered the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal.
*In 2000, British military hostages in Sierra Leone were subject to mock executions by the West Side Boys to get information from them.
* In April 2003, U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Allen West had Iraqi police officer Yehiya Kadoori Hamoodi seized and brought in for questioning based on allegations he was planning an imminent attack on West&#x27;s unit. After Hamoodi was allegedly beaten by an interpreter and several U.S. troops, West took Hamoodi out of the interrogation room and showed him six U.S. troops with weapons in hand. West told Hamoodi, &quot;If you don&#x27;t talk, they will kill you.&quot; West then placed Hamoodi&#x27;s head in a sand-filled barrel used for clearing weapons, placed his gun into the barrel and discharged the weapon near Hamoodi&#x27;s head. Hamoodi then provided West with names, location and methods of the alleged ambush, which never happened, and no evidence of any plans of attack was found. Hamoodi was released without charges; West was charged with violations of two statutes of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, but charges were dropped after West was fined $5,000 for the incident and allowed to resign his position with the U.S. Army without court martial.
* In 2014 journalist James Foley was subjected to mock executions by ISIL militants before he was beheaded. Mock executions are reported to be a common torture tactic used by ISIL.

<doc id="827639" wikidata="Q5904371" url="?curid=827639" title="James Kealoha">
<text>James Kimo Kealoha (April 29, 1908 – August 24, 1983) was an American politician who served as the first lieutenant governor of Hawaii in the administration of Governor of Hawaii William F. Quinn. Prior to his election as Lieutenant Governor, Kealoha served a number of years as a legislator on Hawaii island (the &quot;Big Island&quot;), distinguishing himself as a respected leader.

==Early years==
James Kealoha was born on April 29, 1908, in Pahoa on Hawaii island to Lee Chau and Alice Makanui Kealoha. His father was a Cantonese immigrant who had come to Hawaii as a plantation laborer. While growing up James was raised by his grandparents, whose name he assumed. Later he decided to add Kimo as his middle name. In the Chinese community in Hawaii, he was commonly known as Lee Yat Wo.

He graduated from Hilo High School in 1926 and started working as a clerk for Kwong See Wo, a grocery store in Hilo. In 1929 he married Muilan Young, and together they had two daughters, Leihulu Emma and Leiohu Lillie. In the next year he opened his own grocery, which he operated until 1948.

==Legislative career==
In 1934, Kealoha was elected to the Territorial House of Representatives, serving as speaker pro tem. He was elected for a second term two years later. In 1938, he successfully ran as a Democrat for a seat in the Territorial Senate, where he served as president pro tem. That same year, he switched to the Republican Party, expressing his unhappiness with the in-fighting amongst island Democrats. People often referred to Kealoha as the &quot;Wonder Boy of Hawaiian politics&quot; because he consistently won elections by sizable margins.

In 1940 Kealoha was elected to the Hawaii County Board of Supervisors, where he won re-election for three successive terms. In 1946, he suffered his first-ever defeat in his political career, losing in a bid for Hawaii County Chairman. In 1948, he ran again, winning the first of six consecutive terms as Hawaii County Chairman.

==Lieutenant governor==
Kealoha served for years as Hawaii County Chairman, because of his popularity and leadership, was selected in 1959 by the Republican Party as its candidate for lieutenant governor in the state of Hawaii&#x27;s first gubernatorial election, running alongside William F. Quinn, the party&#x27;s candidate for governor. The pairing worked well, as Quinn and Kealoha defeated their Democratic opponents John A. Burns and Mitsuyuki Kido. Kealoha was the first Chinese American and Native Hawaiian to be elected as a lieutenant governor in the United States.

Kealoha&#x27;s term as lieutenant governor was described as &quot;unpleasant&quot; for him. Governor Quinn was not confident in allowing a Native Hawaiian, even a friend like Kealoha, to make important decisions on his behalf. Kealoha found himself relegated to presiding at ceremonial functions. He also had disagreements with Governor Quinn about the issue of political patronage.

Kealoha gained national attention during the close 1960 United States presidential election, in which John F. Kennedy defeated Richard Nixon both nationally and in Hawaii. Errors in the official tabulation resulted in Nixon being declared the winner of Hawaii&#x27;s electoral votes by 141 votes, despite inconsistencies in the tabulation sheets. After ordering two audits of the tabulation sheets (but being unable to inspect the actual ballots cast), Kealoha certified the vote total in favor of his fellow Republican Nixon, resulting in the call of national Democrats for a recount. The recount extended past the Constitutionally-required December 19 date for casting electoral votes; as a result, both &quot;unofficial&quot; Democratic and &quot;official&quot; Republican electoral slates met at the Iolani Palace and submitted competing certificates of ascertainment for Hawaii&#x27;s three electoral votes. The result was finally resolved on the floor of the United States Senate during the electoral college certification process.

==1962 election for Governor==
After growing tensions between Kealoha and Quinn, especially on the role of the Lieutenant Governor, Kealoha challenged Quinn in the Republican gubernatorial primary in 1962, characterizing himself as a &quot;native son&quot; and a &quot;local boy&quot; in what was described as &quot;a bitter contest&quot;. Quinn prevailed, garnering 44,095 votes to 33,277 for Kealoha (Boylan). Quinn, in a quest for reconciliation, appointed Kealoha as the executive officer for the Hawaii exhibit at the New York World&#x27;s Fair.

Later in the general election of that year, Quinn was soundly defeated by his Democratic opponent, John A. Burns. Some analysts have said that the decision by Kealoha to challenge Governor Quinn in the primary cost the Republicans the election. For many voters the primary was another triumph of the &quot;Haole&quot; over the Hawaiian, a recurring theme with the Republican Party, causing voters to defect to the Democrats or refused to vote.

==Comeback attempts==
After losing in 1962, Kealoha still had political aspirations but failed to win an election again. In 1966 he ran for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives against incumbent Democrat Spark Matsunaga and was defeated. Of note in that campaign was Kealoha&#x27;s vocal opposition to the war in Vietnam which shocked fellow Republicans and enthused Democrats in their election efforts (Harada). In 1968 he unsuccessfully ran for Mayor of Hawaii County, losing to Shunichi Kimura.

==Business difficulties and later years==
In addition to his defeats at the polls, Kealoha endured two business setbacks. In 1967, he filed bankruptcy in connection with his involvement in a restaurant and show concession at the Montreal Expo in Canada (Cavaliero and Sherman). In 1977, he and his wife were victimized in a hotel and condominium scam that also resulted in bankruptcy. In his later years Kealoha grew papayas in Hawaii and owned a farm in Salem, Oregon. He died on August 24, 1983, in Honolulu with interment at Homelani Cemetery in Hilo.

==James Kealoha Park==

In 1963, James Kealoha Beach Park on Hawaii Island was named in his honor. Also known to residents as &quot;4-Miles,&quot; the park is located four miles from the Hilo Post Office, which has been historically considered the starting point for all mileage markers originating from Hilo (Clark 25). James Kealoha Beach Park is featured in a song on the 1979 album &quot;Na Pana Kaulana o Keaukaha&quot; by Edith Kanakaʻole.

<doc id="827645" wikidata="Q3084419" url="?curid=827645" title="Joyce (singer)">
<text>Joyce Moreno (born 31 January 1948), commonly known as Joyce (), is a Brazilian singer-songwriter and guitarist.

The first record of her work as a singer dates back to 1964, when she participated in a vocal quartet in a studio recording of the album &quot;Sambacana&quot;, by Pacífico Mascarenhas. Four years later, she released her first solo album, &quot;Joyce&quot;, on the Philips label, signing alone the authorship of five of the ten songs on the album, in addition to a partnership with musician Jards Macalé.[2] [3] She has since produced 45 more discs and two DVDs, has written nearly 400 songs, and also has four nominations for the Latin Grammy Awards (2000, 2004, 2005 and 2010). Since the beginning of her career, her trademarks have been a feminine language in the first person and her guitar skills. [3][4][5]
As a composer, Joyce Moreno has songs recorded by nearly all the greatest names in Música popular brasileira—including Elis Regina, Maria Bethânia, Gal Costa, Milton Nascimento, Edu Lobo and Elizeth Cardoso—and by such foreign artists as Annie Lennox, Omara Portuondo, Claus Ogerman, the Black Eyed Peas, Gerry Mulligan, and Wallace Roney.[6] Her creations are also featured in two film soundtracks: Robert Altman&#x27;s 1992 &quot;The Player&quot; and Robert Luketic&#x27;s &quot;Legally Blonde&quot;.[7]She participated on the soundtrack of Japanese anime series &quot;Wolf&#x27;s Rain&quot;, for which her work was included as part of the official soundtrack.

==Early childhood==
Moreno&#x27;s paternal grandfather was a Swede, from Karlskrona, who moved to Copenhagen and married a Danish woman. Their son, Joyce&#x27;s father, moved from Denmark to Brazil and married a Brazilian woman, Joyce&#x27;s mother.

==Career in Brazil==
In Brazil, she has become initially known in 1967, a year before releasing her first album, when she performed her song &quot;Me Disseram&quot; at the II International Song Festival (RJ), but the peak of her popularity happened in the early 1980s, when she presented &quot;Clareana&quot;, a song she wrote dedicated to her two infant daughters, at TV Globo&#x27;s Brazilian Popular Music Festival. The song was a huge hit across the country and appeared on her 1980 album Feminina, which also included other hits like the title tune (&quot;Feminina&quot;), &quot;Mistérios&quot;, &quot;Da Cor Brasileira&quot; and &quot;Essa Mulher&quot;. From then on, she has released a series of albums with her own original compositions, recorded in Brazil and abroad; albums dedicated to the works of Vinicius de Moraes, her artistic godfather, Tom Jobim, Elis Regina and Dorival Caymmi, to name a few; and many recordings in partnership with other musicians.

==International career==
Still in the 1980s, she had a first presence on the international circuit, when, replacing guitarist Toquinho, she performed with the poet Vinicius de Moraes on tours throughout Latin America and Europe.[9] It was a period in which she recorded albums in Italy and the United States, during a season of concerts in New York, in 1977. In 1985, she was invited to participate in the Youth Festival, in Moscow, and the Yamaha Festival, in Japan, starting a solid career abroad that involves annual tours in several countries in Europe, Japan, the United States and Canada - a schedule that reconciles with performances in Brazil.[1] 

In 2004, she was awarded in the United States with the Lifetime Achievement International Press Award, given by the press to personalities who disseminate a positive image of their countries abroad. Three years earlier, for the same reason, she had received the key to the city of Johnstown, Pennsylvania (USA). In 2015 she entered the list of honored artists by the Berklee College of Music, Boston, USA, having her work arranged and performed by graduates and presented in a large concert at the university&#x27;s theater. At the time, she received honors from the Boston City Council and the Massachusetts State Assembly for her contribution to Brazilian culture and for promoting this culture internationally.[10] Joyce is also an educator, conducting workshops and master classes about her music and MPB at universities in several countries.[1]

In the early 1990s, her work became increasingly popular among London DJs, which led to new audiences around the world in the acid jazz scene.

It was in the debut edition of the Latin Grammy, in 2000, that Joyce Moreno received her first award nomination, in the category Best Brazilian Music CD, with the album &quot;&quot;, a tribute to Elis Regina recorded in 1998, in New York. Four years later, it was the turn of the samba &quot;A Banda Maluca&quot; to appear among the candidates for the award for Best Song in the Portuguese Language. In 2005, the CD &quot;Banda Maluca&quot; was nominated in the Best Brazilian Popular Music Album category. The fourth nomination for the Latin Grammy, also for best Brazilian music CD, occurred in 2010, with her album &quot;Slow Music&quot;.

==As a writer and TV personality==
As a journalist who graduated in the late &#x27;60s, in 1997 Moreno published the book &quot;Fotografei Você na Minha Rolleiflex&quot;, which brought together stories experienced by the artist behind the scenes of Brazilian popular music. Due to the repercussion of this work, between 1998 and 2000, she started to sign a weekly chronicle in the Rio newspaper &quot;O Dia&quot;. In addition, for ten years (2006-2016) she wrote about life experience, travel and music in her blog Other Bossas.

Soon after publishing her book, she started to create and present television programs for MultiRio, the public TV channel of the City of Rio de Janeiro. In 1999, she released &quot;Cantos do Rio&quot; (&quot;Rio Corners&quot;), a series in which she mapped the city and its music, interviewing composers and performers in their neighborhoods of reference and musical inspiration. In 2010 it was the turn of the series &quot;No Compasso da História&quot; (“In The Beat of History”): 15 documentaries in which the History of Brazil is told through MPB songs. Two years later, the project &quot;Pequenos Notáveis &quot;(“Remarkable Kids”) was presented, in which he addressed the childhood of some of the greatest composers of Brazilian music.[13]

==Second book and later works==
In November 2020, Joyce published &quot;Aquelas Coisas Todas&quot;, her second book of memoirs, edited in two parts. Part One is the updated version of &quot;Fotografei Você na Minha Rolleiflex&quot;, while in Part Two, &quot;Tudo é uma Canção&quot;, the artist presents new stories based on the idea that MPB &quot;has an answer for everything&quot;. In a report about the release, the Estado de Minas newspaper highlighted: &quot;Manifestations against the dictatorship, travels, festivals, growing musical movements, such as bossa nova and Tropicália, misunderstandings and confusions between artists that would eventually go down in history. When something like this happened, Joyce Moreno was there.&quot; [14] [15]

The book had great repercussion in the national press and was the basis of a four-chapter miniseries presented on SESC 24 de Maio&#x27;s YouTube channel, in which the artist approaches texts from the book with complementary accounts and interpretations of songs related to the stories. [16]

In parallel, the record company Pau Brasil released in digital format the album &quot;Fiz uma Viagem - Songs of Dorival Caymmi&quot;, recorded in 2016 in Norway and released in Japan the following year. In this work, Moreno interprets the songs of the composer from Bahia accompanied by bassist Rodolfo Stroeter, also producer of the album, by the pianist Hélio Alves and by Tutty Moreno, who played drums and percussion.

Joyce was married in the early &#x27;70s to musician and composer Nelson Angelo, with whom she has two daughters who are also singers, Clara Moreno and Ana Martins. Since 1977, she has been married to drummer Tutty Moreno, father of her daughter Mina Mae (originally named as Mariana). Tutty has since then been a steady presence in Joyce&#x27;s life as a stage and recording partner.[18]

<text>Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan (; born 16 February 1969) is one of the six main characters from the American television sitcom, &quot;Friends&quot;. She was created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman and portrayed by actress Lisa Kudrow.

In the series&#x27; universe, Phoebe was born on February 16 and is the daughter of Frank and Lily Buffay. Her biological mother&#x27;s name was Phoebe Abbott, whom she was named after. Phoebe has a twin sister, Ursula, a waitress who is also portrayed by Kudrow. Phoebe can speak several languages, including French and Italian. She appeared in all of the show&#x27;s 236 episodes during its decade-long run, from its premiere on September 22, 1994, to its finale on May 6, 2004. She is a masseuse and musician, notable for her offbeat and often unusual behavior. She was Monica Geller&#x27;s roommate before Rachel Green, which is how she was introduced to the group. Phoebe is best friends with Monica and Rachel, along with their neighbors, Chandler Bing and Joey Tribbiani, and also Monica&#x27;s brother Ross Geller. She plays acoustic guitar and sings simple, awkward songs at Central Perk, occasionally busking also. During the show&#x27;s ninth season, Phoebe is set up on a blind date with Mike Hannigan (played by actor Paul Rudd) and they marry in the final season.

Critical reception towards Phoebe remained consistently positive throughout &quot;Friends&quot;&#x27; decade-long run. Kudrow received critical acclaim for playing her character, including a Primetime Emmy Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a Satellite Award, an American Comedy Award and a &quot;TV Guide&quot; Award, as well as a Golden Globe Award nomination.

==Role==
In the pilot episode, Phoebe is introduced as one of the six original friends, including her Greenwich Village Manhattan neighbors Joey (Matt LeBlanc) and Chandler (Matthew Perry), former roommate Monica (Courteney Cox), Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston), and Monica&#x27;s brother, Ross (David Schwimmer). She is a masseuse and part-time, aspiring folk-type musician, who plays a dreadnought style acoustic guitars and sings very awkward or absurd, self-composed songs. She has been shown busking in the subway, outside of the gang&#x27;s usual &quot;hang out&quot; place, Central Perk, as well as at a public library, and has been seen frequently playing live sets inside the coffee shop. She had moved in with her maternal grandmother (Audra Lindley), upon moving out of Monica&#x27;s apartment, approximately one year before the pilot episode, due to Monica&#x27;s obsessive compulsive nature and anal-retentive cleaning habits. During the first season, she has myriad boyfriends, including Tony, a physicist named David, played by Hank Azaria, and a psychologist named Roger, played by Fisher Stevens. Phoebe works as a temporary secretary for Chandler for a brief period in &quot;The One with the Big Ick Factor&quot;.

Phoebe&#x27;s crass, identical twin sister, Ursula Buffay (also portrayed by Kudrow), a character originally created for and appearing in the American sitcom &quot;Mad About You&quot; as a waitress, is also introduced in the first season, in &quot;The One with Two Parts&quot;. Phoebe is shown to have a very strained relationship with Ursula, who is one minute older than her and seems to care little about family affairs or Phoebe, Phoebe nearly always goes home empty-handed and none the wiser. When it is revealed Ursula performs in porn under Phoebe&#x27;s name, Phoebe eventually finds some redemption by cashing in Ursula&#x27;s pay slips. Phoebe&#x27;s father, Frank Buffay, abandoned the family when Phoebe was a child, and the woman Phoebe believed was her mother, Lily Buffay, committed suicide when Phoebe was about 14, by means of carbon monoxide poisoning. However, Phoebe discovers she has a paternal half-brother Frank, Jr., and later meets her real mother Phoebe Abbott (Teri Garr), who had given her up for adoption when she was born.

In the second season episode, &quot;The One with Phoebe&#x27;s Husband&quot;, it is revealed that Phoebe was legally married to a &quot;hoping to be gay&quot; Canadian ice dancer, Duncan (Steve Zahn), for six years, to help him acquire his green card. The two divorce when he realizes that he is, in fact, heterosexual, and going to marry another woman. In &quot;The One with the Baby on the Bus&quot;, Phoebe is temporarily replaced as the primary singer for Central Perk by a professional singer named Stephanie Schiffer, played by singer Chrissie Hynde. Phoebe&#x27;s song &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; is introduced in the same episode. In &quot;The One Where Eddie Moves In&quot;, a record company produces a full budget music video for the song, in which her voice is overdubbed by a much better singer; she turns down her record deal when she discovers the depth of the deception.

Although the facets of Phoebe&#x27;s character are manifold and extremely complex, Phoebe can generally be classified as kind-hearted, but ditzy and whimsical. Due in no small part to her extremely traumatic childhood, Phoebe has developed a child-like naïveté in an attempt to shield herself from the world&#x27;s evils. In addition to being a vegetarian and an avid tree hugger, she also displays a remarkable lack of experience with the &quot;darker sides&quot; of life. In &quot;The One Where Old Yeller Dies&quot;, it is shown that her deceased mother Lily would turn off films before a tragic ending, including the death of Old Yeller or Bambi&#x27;s mother being shot. It is also revealed that she was never told the truth about Santa Claus. This is made all the more prominent as one of the running jokes of the show is Phoebe&#x27;s seemingly infinite criminal record. She repeatedly makes reference to her underworld connections and crimes committed while living &quot;on the streets&quot;.

Much to the dismay of her friends (especially paleontologist Ross), Phoebe dabbles in trendy New Age ideas and superstitions throughout the series. She is convinced she can feel the presence of her dead grandmother in her old apartment, she senses the spirit of her mother in a lost cat, reads tea leaves, and dismisses Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution as &quot;too easy&quot; in &quot;The One Where Heckles Dies&quot;. Very in tune with her emotions and those of others, Phoebe sometimes serves as a rock to her friends. She especially shows a great deal of maternal instinct towards her younger brother Frank, despite the latter&#x27;s lack of intelligence.

Similar to the short-lived Monica/Chandler/Richard love triangle, Phoebe had two serious romantic interests that overlapped with each other at one point during the series. Physicist David (Hank Azaria), has a romance with Phoebe in the first season of the series, but breaks her heart when he decides to leave for Minsk on a three-year research trip. He makes a few more appearances throughout the series, most notably shortly before her engagement to Mike (Paul Rudd). Mike was introduced early in the ninth season of the show, during a double blind date with Joey, who finds Mike randomly at Central Perk. After a whirlwind romance, Phoebe and Mike break up after he says he never wants to marry again, and she briefly reunites with David. While on a trip to Barbados, both men propose to her, but she rejects David, realizing she is in love with Mike. She temporarily rejects Mike&#x27;s proposal also, merely wanting an indication that their relationship is progressing. She ends up marrying Mike.

==Jokes and sarcasm==

===&quot;Smelly Cat&quot;===
One of the show&#x27;s running gags are Phoebe&#x27;s absurd, folksy songs with awkward titles like &quot;Pervert Parade&quot;, &quot;Ode to A Pubic Hair&quot;, &quot;You Suck&quot;, &quot;Shut Up &amp; Go Home&quot;, &quot;Ballad of the Circumcised Man&quot;, &quot;The Food Here Will Kill You&quot;, however Phoebe&#x27;s magnum opus is undoubtedly &quot;Smelly Cat&quot;, which she debuts in season one at Central Perk. The song is about a cat who is shunned by society because of its foul stench as a result of flatulence (&quot;What are they feeding you?&quot;). However, Phoebe empathizes with it, because she can relate to being outcast. The verses consist of Phoebe rattling off a list of ways in which the cat is disliked (&quot;They won&#x27;t take you to the vet&quot;, &quot;you&#x27;re obviously not their favorite pet&quot;, etc.) while the chorus ends with the uplifting message to anyone who is different or unique that it is &quot;not your fault&quot;. In the episode, &quot;The One Where Eddie Moves In,&quot; Phoebe is discovered by a record producer who wants to make a music video for &quot;Smelly Cat&quot;. Phoebe is delighted with the result, at first naively failing to recognize that the voice in the video belongs to a far more talented singer. Ultimately, she philosophizes that the unrecognized singer &quot;is&quot;, metaphorically, Smelly Cat, denied deserving adoration for having the wrong &quot;look&quot;. In the episode, &quot;The One With Phoebe&#x27;s Ex-Partner,&quot; Phoebe&#x27;s former singing partner, Leslie, portrayed by E.G. Daily, wants to get back together. The partnership fails again when Leslie sells &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; to a commercial agency against Phoebe&#x27;s wishes. Phoebe teaches the song to Chrissie Hynde, who releases it in a 1999 album. The credited songwriters include Adam Chase, Betsy Borns, Kudrow and Hynde. On August 26, 2015, Kudrow performed the song as a duet with Taylor Swift during Swift&#x27;s concert in Los Angeles as a part of her 1989 World Tour.

===Age===
Her age seemed to have differed throughout the series. In &quot;The One with the Mugging&quot;, it is implied that Phoebe is older than Ross, seeing as she was fourteen when he was 12. This episode made her possibly the oldest in the group. In &quot;The One with the Jellyfish&quot; (Season 4), Phoebe states that she is twenty-nine, placing her birth in approximately 1968. However, in &quot;The One Where They&#x27;re Going to Party&quot; (Season 4), Ross states he is also 29, which does not work with the previously mentioned two-year age gap. According to &quot;The One with Frank Jr.&quot;, Phoebe was born on February 16; however, in Season 9 (&quot;The One with Phoebe&#x27;s Birthday Dinner&quot;) Phoebe&#x27;s birthday is sometime in early November, since they could not make the reservations and the dinner had to be moved back to October 31. In &quot;The One Where They All Turn Thirty&quot; (Season 7), it is revealed that Phoebe was born a year earlier than she thought, believing she was 30 but was truly 31, which further adds to the inconsistency of her age throughout the show&#x27;s run. Phoebe also tries on at least one occasion to manipulate the other friends into celebrating her birthday again within months of a previous birthday party.

===&quot;Regina Phalange&quot;===
Phoebe occasionally uses the alter ego Regina Phalange. The first reference to Regina Phalange is during season 5 following Ross saying &quot;Rachel&quot; instead of &quot;Emily&quot; at his wedding. She pretends to be &quot;Doctor Phalange&quot;, Ross&#x27;s brain doctor, claiming that names are interchangeable in his mind. When the friends go to Vegas, Phoebe introduces herself to the blackjack dealer as Regina Phalange. When Phoebe, Rachel, and Melissa go out to lunch (The One with Rachel&#x27;s Big Kiss), and Melissa asks if she was in a sorority, she pretends to be a member of &quot;Thigh Mega Tampon&quot;, a fictional sorority that was allegedly shut down when Regina Phalange died of alcohol poisoning. She also used her fake name to show Chandler and Monica how easily people lie about their names and to help Chandler with his interviewing skills in season 8 episode 4, when Joey says, &quot;Hi, I&#x27;m Ken Adams&quot; she replies, &quot;Regina Phalange&quot;. In the season 10 episode &quot;The One Where Joey Speaks French&quot;, Phoebe attempts to spare Joey from humiliation by introducing herself as &quot;Régine Philange&quot; and stating that Joey is speaking an obscure regional dialect from her &quot;hometown&quot; of &quot;Estée Lauder&quot;. She immediately switches to French and claims that Joey is her younger brother who is &quot;un peu retardé&quot; (a little slow), and requesting that the casting director humor Joey&#x27;s French-speaking abilities. The last reference is in the series finale when Phoebe successfully stalls Rachel&#x27;s plane to Paris by saying there is a problem with the &quot;left phalange&quot;, causing everyone on the plane to evacuate. The passengers are eventually convinced to return to the plane. When a woman skeptically asks an airport employee if &quot;the phalange&quot; was fixed, he replies, &quot;Yes, the phalange is fixed! As a matter of fact, we put a whole lot of extra phalanges onboard, just in case!&quot;

==Production==
Phoebe&#x27;s pregnancy during Season 4 was to account for Lisa Kudrow&#x27;s actual pregnancy.

===Casting===
Ellen DeGeneres, Kathy Griffin, Jane Lynch, and Megan Mullally all auditioned for the role of Phoebe. Lisa Kudrow won the role because the producers liked her recurring role as Ursula, the waitress in &quot;Mad About You&quot;. The characters were connected to make them twin sisters. The producers said they liked the elements of Lisa in Ursula, but they needed Phoebe to be a lot more humorous.

==Reception==

Kudrow received critical acclaim for playing her character, including a Primetime Emmy Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a Satellite Award, and an American Comedy Award, as well as a Golden Globe Award nomination.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; voted Phoebe Buffay on &quot;Friends&quot; as Lisa Kudrow&#x27;s best performance.

<doc id="827650" wikidata="Q125841" url="?curid=827650" title="Tappan Zee Bridge (1955–2017)">
<text>The Governor Malcolm Wilson Tappan Zee Bridge, commonly known as the Tappan Zee Bridge, was a cantilever bridge in the U.S. state of New York. It was built from 1952 to 1955 to cross the Hudson River at one of its widest points, north of Midtown Manhattan, from South Nyack to Tarrytown. As an integral conduit within the New York Metropolitan Area, the bridge connected South Nyack in Rockland County with Tarrytown in Westchester County in the Lower Hudson Valley.

Opened on December 15, 1955, the Tappan Zee Bridge was one of the primary crossings of the Hudson River north of New York City; it carried much of the traffic between southern New England and points west of the Hudson. The bridge was the longest in New York State, a title retained by its replacement. The total length of the bridge approached . The cantilever span was , which provided a maximum clearance of over the water. The bridge was officially named after former governor Malcolm Wilson in 1994, though the original name continued to be used.

The Tappan Zee Bridge was part of the New York State Thruway mainline and carried the highway concurrency of Interstate 87 and Interstate 287. The span carried seven lanes of motor traffic. The center lane was able to be switched between eastbound and westbound traffic depending on the prevalent commuter direction; on weekdays the center lane was eastbound in the morning and westbound in the evening. The switch was accomplished via a movable center barrier which was moved by a pair of barrier transfer machines. Even with the switchable lane, traffic was frequently very slow.

In 2013, federal and state authorities started constructing a replacement bridge at a cost of at least $4 billion. All traffic was shifted to the new bridge on October 6, 2017, and demolition of the old bridge began soon afterward. The eastern half of the bridge was demolished in a controlled demolition on January 15, 2019, while the western half was lowered onto a barge and hauled away in May 2019. The Tappan Zee is named for an American Indian tribe from the area called &quot;Tappan&quot;; and &quot;zee&quot; being the Dutch word for &quot;sea&quot;.

== History ==

With the increasing demands for commuter travel taxing the existing bridges and tunnels, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey had plans in 1950 to construct a bridge across the Hudson near Dobbs Ferry, New York. The proposal was overridden by New York State Governor Thomas E. Dewey, who wanted to construct a bridge to connect the New York State Thruway across Westchester to the New England Thruway. The Port Authority promised its bondholders that it would not allow any other entity to construct a river crossing within its jurisdiction, which reached to a point one mile (1.6 km) south of Nyack on the western shore of the Hudson River and across to Tarrytown on the eastern shore.

A May 10, 1950, editorial in &quot;The New York Times&quot; suggested that a site in southern Dobbs Ferry or northern Hastings-on-Hudson, where the Hudson narrowed considerably from its three-mile (5 km) width at Tappan Zee, would be a more appropriate site, and suggested that Governor Dewey work with his counterpart, Governor of New Jersey Alfred E. Driscoll, to craft a compromise that would offer Thruway customers a discounted bridge fare at a more southerly crossing. Two days later, Governor Dewey announced that the Port Authority had dropped its plans to construct a bridge of its own, and that the bridge&#x27;s location would be close to the Tarrytown-Nyack line, just outside the Port Authority&#x27;s jurisdiction. Dewey stated that World War II military technology would be used in the bridge&#x27;s construction.

The site of the bridge, at the Hudson River&#x27;s second-widest point, added to construction costs. The site was chosen to be as close as possible to New York City, while staying out of the range of the Port Authority&#x27;s influence, thus ensuring that revenue from collected tolls would go to the newly created New York State Thruway Authority, and not the Port Authority. A unique aspect of the design of the bridge was that the main span was supported by eight hollow concrete caissons. Their buoyancy supported some of the loads and helped reduce costs.

The bridge was designed by Emil Praeger of the Madigan-Hyland engineering firm. Captain Praeger helped develop floating caissons during World War II when the Allied forces needed to create and protect portable harbors for the 1944 invasion of Normandy. Black architect and engineer Donald F. White had also worked on the bridge design.

Construction started in March 1952 and the bridge opened to traffic on December 15, 1955, along with a long section of the New York State Thruway from Suffern to Yonkers. The bridge was built on a very tight budget of $81 million (1950 dollars), or $1.08 billion in 2024 dollars.

New York State Governor W. Averell Harriman signed a bill on February 28, 1956, to officially name the structure the Tappan Zee Bridge.

In 1960, the bridge was redecked, additionally, it was given a new metallic safety barrier.

Originally, tolls were collected in both directions. In August 1970, the toll was abolished for westbound drivers, and at the same time, eastbound drivers saw their tolls doubled. The tolls of eleven other New York–New Jersey and Hudson River crossings along a stretch, from the Outerbridge Crossing in the south to the Rip Van Winkle Bridge in the north, were also changed to eastbound-only at that time.

In an effort to reduce congestion, the median was replaced by a seventh travel lane in 1987, this meant making the other six lanes narrower.

A zipper barrier was installed in 1992.

In 1994, the name of Malcolm Wilson was added to the bridge&#x27;s name upon the 20th anniversary of his leaving the governor&#x27;s office in December 1974. However, it was almost never used when the bridge was spoken about colloquially.

The bridge was refurbished in 2008.

It was redecked in 2010.
== Replacement bridge ==

===Planning and construction===
Since the end of the 20th century, calls to replace the aging Tappan Zee Bridge had gone unanswered. The deteriorating structure bore an average of 138,000 vehicles per day by the end of its life, substantially more traffic than its designed capacity. Unlike other major bridges in metropolitan New York, the Tappan Zee was designed to last only 50 years due to material shortages during the Korean War at the time of its construction. In total, the bridge was open for 61 years, 9 months, and 21 days. The new bridge is intended to last at least 100 years without any major repairs.

The collapse of Minnesota&#x27;s I-35W Mississippi River bridge in 2007 raised worries about the Tappan Zee&#x27;s structural integrity. These concerns, together with traffic overcapacity and increased maintenance costs, escalated the serious discussions already ongoing about replacing the Tappan Zee with a tunnel or a new bridge. Six options were identified and submitted for project study and environmental review.

In 2009, the Tappan Zee Bridge was featured on The History Channel &quot;The Crumbling of America&quot; showing the infrastructure crisis in the United States. Many factors contribute to the precarious infrastructure of the bridge, which has been called &quot;one of the most decrepit and potentially dangerous bridges&quot; in the U.S. Engineering assessments have determined that &quot;everything from steel corrosion to earthquakes to maritime accidents could cause major, perhaps catastrophic, damage to the span,&quot; prompting one of the top aides in the New York state governor&#x27;s office to refer to the Tappan Zee as the “hold-your-breath bridge.” A 2009 state report noted that the bridge was not built with a plan that was &quot;conducive to long-term durability” and that the Tappan Zee’s engineers designed it to be “nonredundant,” meaning that one &quot;critical fracture could make the bridge fail completely because its supports couldn’t transfer the structure’s load to other supports.&quot;

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) studied the feasibility of either including a rail line across the new bridge or building the new bridge so a new rail line can be installed at a future date. Commuter rail service west of the bridge in Rockland County is limited, and the MTA studied expansion possibilities in Rockland County that would use the new bridge to connect with Metro-North&#x27;s Hudson Line on the east side of the bridge along the Hudson River for direct service into Manhattan. On September 26, 2008, New York state officials announced their plan to replace the Tappan Zee Bridge with a new bridge that included high-speed bus lanes and space for future commuter-train tracks. The bridge was estimated to cost $6.4 billion, while adding bus lanes from Suffern to Port Chester was estimated to cost an additional $2.9 billion. Adding a rail line from the Suffern Metro-North station and across the bridge, connecting with Metro-North’s Hudson Line south of Tarrytown, would have added another $6.7 billion. The plan was reviewed for its environmental impacts.

In 2013, the New York State Thruway Authority began building the new Tappan Zee Bridge, a double-span bridge (four lanes per span in opposite directions) with designated bus lanes, to the north of the old bridge. Construction began as scheduled during 2013, with completion projected for 2017.

===Closure and demolition of old span===

The new northbound/westbound span opened on August 25, 2017. The zipper barrier was then removed, and southbound/eastbound traffic remained on the old span until October 7, 2017, when it was temporarily shifted to the newer northbound/westbound span. The old bridge was subsequently decommissioned. The replacement bridge project was expected to be completed by June 15, 2018 at a cost of $3.98 billion. After some delays, it was announced that the new southbound/eastbound span would open to traffic on September 8, 2018. However, the opening of the new eastbound span was delayed when a piece of the old bridge came loose on September 7 while being demolished. The eastbound span, which was away from the old bridge, remained closed until the old bridge could be stabilized.

The old bridge was then demolished in piecemeal fashion in order to minimize impacts on the Hudson River&#x27;s wildlife and marine traffic. 135 deck panels that were assembled onto the old bridge recently as part of emergency repairs would be sold to local governments for a dollar each so that local governments can build new bridges. Other parts of the old bridge would be sunk off the Atlantic Ocean coast as part of New York State&#x27;s artificial reef program. In May 2018, the state government began sinking parts of the old bridge to make 12 artificial reefs.

On January 2, 2019, it was announced that the eastern approach to the old bridge would be demolished with explosives on January 12. However, it was postponed due to high winds. It was demolished on January 15, 2019. The western approach was lowered onto a barge and hauled away beginning on May 12, 2019 and lasting several days.

== Suicide prevention ==

From 1998 to 2008, more than 25 people committed suicide on the Tappan Zee Bridge, according to the New York State Thruway Authority.

On August 31, 2007, NYSTA officials added four phones – two each on the Rockland and Westchester sides – that connect callers via the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline crisis hotline to counselors at LifeNet or Covenant House. Signs reading &quot;Life is Worth Living&quot; and &quot;When it seems like there is no hope, there is help&quot; were placed on the bridge. Suicide fencing and traffic cameras were also installed along the bridge, and bridge staff were trained in suicide prevention. On October 14, 2012, &quot;Newsday&quot; reported that the Tappan Zee Bridge was called the Golden Gate Bridge of the East and that the &quot;new Tappan Zee, which is in the works, will include fencing designed to thwart jumpers.&quot;

Suicides on the Tappan Zee Bridge included those of Scott Douglas on January 6th, 1994 – after murdering his wife, newspaper heiress Anne Scripps – and of Douglas&#x27;s stepdaughter Anne Morrell Petrillo, who jumped to her death on September 24, 2009. A US military employee jumped from the bridge to her death in 2010.

<text>Garrett John Hedlund (born September 3, 1984) is an American actor and musician. His films include &quot;Troy&quot; (2004), &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot; (2004), &quot;Four Brothers&quot; (2005), &quot;Eragon&quot; (2006), &quot;Death Sentence&quot; (2007), &quot;&quot; (2010), &quot;Country Strong&quot; (2010), &quot;On the Road&quot; (2012), &quot;Inside Llewyn Davis&quot; (2013), &quot;Unbroken&quot; (2014), &quot;Pan&quot; (2015), &quot;Mudbound&quot; (2017), &quot;Triple Frontier&quot; (2019), and &quot;The Marsh King&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (2023).

==Early life==
Garrett John Hedlund was born on September 3, 1984, in Roseau, Minnesota, to Kristine Anne (&quot;née&quot; Yanish) and Robert Martin Hedlund. His father is of Swedish descent and his mother is of Norwegian and German descent. He is the youngest of three children, with a brother, Nathaniel, and a sister, Amanda.

Hedlund was raised on a remote beef cattle farm near the small town of Wannaska, Minnesota, in the Scandinavian diaspora.

In the 9th grade, he moved to live with his mother in Arizona. From an early age, he has had a great fondness for reading. During his school years he participated in ice hockey, track and field, wrestling, and American football. In Arizona he saved his tips from working as a waiter to pay for lessons with acting coach Jean Fowler, with whom he worked on speeches and script material.

Six months after graduating from Horizon High School, he moved to Los Angeles.

==Career==
===2003–2009: Early work and breakthrough===
In 2003, Hedlund moved to Los Angeles to pursue his acting career. As a teenager, Hedlund modeled for L.L. Bean and &quot;Teen&quot; magazine.

At the age of nineteen, Hedlund made his debut in his first feature film playing Patroclus, younger cousin of Achilles played by Brad Pitt in the mythological epic adventure war drama &quot;Troy&quot;, directed by Wolfgang Petersen. The film was released on May 14, 2004.

That same year, he also co-starred with Billy Bob Thornton, Amber Heard and Tim McGraw as Don Billingsley in the 2004 sports drama &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot;, where McGraw played his abusive father. In 2005, he co-starred with Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson and André Benjamin in the crime drama &quot;Four Brothers&quot; as Jack Mercer.

He co-starred with Ed Speleers, Jeremy Irons, Djimon Hounsou and John Malkovich in the fantasy / adventure film &quot;Eragon&quot; as Murtagh Morzansson. This 20th Century Fox film is an international co-production between United States, United Kingdom and Hungary. In October 2006, it was announced that the actors from the Eragon film would lend their voices to the game adaptation. Hedlund lends his image and voice to his character Murtagh in the video game &quot;Eragon&quot;.

In 2007, he co-starred with Lindsay Lohan, Jane Fonda and Cary Elwes in the comedy &quot;Georgia Rule&quot;, directed by Garry Marshall. That same year, he co-starred with Kevin Bacon in the crime thriller &quot;Death Sentence&quot;, directed by James Wan. In this film Hedlund plays the main villain Billy Darley.

===2010–2012: &quot;Tron: Legacy&quot; and worldwide recognition===
In 2010, Hedlund played Sam Flynn, the main protagonist in the science fiction / action film &quot;&quot;, acting alongside Jeff Bridges and Olivia Wilde. Hedlund won a &quot;Darwinian casting process&quot; which tested hundreds of actors, being chosen for having the &quot;unique combination of intelligence, wit, humor, look and physicality&quot; that the producers were looking for in Flynn&#x27;s son. Hedlund trained hard to do his own stunts, which included jumping over cars and copious wire and harness work. The film was released on December 17, 2010, and directed by Joseph Kosinski. It is a sequel to the 1982 film &quot;Tron&quot;, whose director Steven Lisberger returned to produce. Like its predecessor, &quot;Tron: Legacy&quot; has also been described as a cult film. Hedlund was also considered by Disney to play Captain America / Steve Rogers in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but had to abandon the project because his film schedule got in the way of &quot;Tron: Legacy&quot;.

Hedlund co-starred with Gwyneth Paltrow, Leighton Meester and his &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot; co-star, country musician Tim McGraw in the musical drama &quot;Country Strong&quot;, which was released on December 22, 2010. He recorded a number of songs for the film including &quot;Chances Are&quot; which appeared on &quot;Country Strong: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot;. His performance was well received by critics. Noting voice similarities between Hedlund and Charlie Robison, &quot;Roughstock&quot; said &quot;the best song on this album belongs to him&quot; and &quot;Country Weekly&quot; wrote that of all the songs performed by actors in this film, his was &quot;the most convincing&quot;. Six other songs, including a duet with Meester, were featured on a second soundtrack titled &quot;Country Strong: More Music from the Motion Picture&quot;.

On June 7, 2011, Hedlund was named &quot;Man of the Year&quot; at the Glamour Awards.

He also co-starred with Kristen Stewart, Sam Riley, Kirsten Dunst and Viggo Mortensen as Dean Moriarty in the 2012 adventure drama &quot;On the Road&quot;, produced by Francis Ford Coppola. The film was directed by Walter Salles and based on Jack Kerouac&#x27;s novel of same name. Hedlund&#x27;s performance in this film was praised by critics. In &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, veteran reviewer Todd McCarthy writing &quot;Although the story is Sal / Kerouac&#x27;s, the star part is Dean, and Hedlund has the allure for it; among the men here, he&#x27;s the one you always watch, and the actor effectively catches the character’s impulsive, thrill-seeking, risk-taking, responsibility-avoiding personality.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; magazine&#x27;s Owen Gleiberman wrote, &quot;The best thing in the movie is Garrett Hedlund&#x27;s performance as Dean Moriarty, whose hunger for life – avid, erotic, insatiable, destructive – kindles a fire that will light the way to a new era. Hedlund is as hunky as the young Brad Pitt, and like Pitt, he&#x27;s a wily, change-up actor&quot;.

That same year, he was an advertising and catwalk model for the Italian fashion firm Prada.

Hedlund was cast as Kaneda Shotaro in the live-action version of &quot;Akira&quot; but production of the film was cancelled. Hedlund reportedly turned down the roles of Christian Grey in the film adaptation of E. L. James&#x27; best-selling novel &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; and Finnick Odair in the sequel to the dystopian science fiction / adventure film &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; titled &quot;The Hunger Games: Catching Fire&quot;.

===2013–2022: Established actor===
In 2013, Hedlund co-starred with Oscar Isaac, Justin Timberlake and Adam Driver in the French-American black comedy-drama film &quot;Inside Llewyn Davis&quot;, directed by Joel and Ethan Coen. Hedlund pays homage to a fallen cowboy whose name is Lane Frost in the music video of the song Beautiful War by American rock band Kings of Leon. Also in 2013, he was the image of Yves Saint Laurent Beauté&#x27;s French men&#x27;s fragrance &quot;La Nuit de l&#x27;Homme&quot;.

<text>Kenmore station is an underground light rail station on the MBTA Green Line, located under Kenmore Square in the Fenway/Kenmore neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, United States. It is served by the B, C, and D branches of the Green Line. The station has two island platforms, one for each direction. Kenmore is the primary station for Fenway Park, which is to the south. The station opened on October 23, 1932 as a one-station extension of the Boylston Street subway to relieve congestion in the square. It was renovated for accessibility in 2005–2010.

==Station layout==

Kenmore station has four tracks serving two island platforms; the northern platform serves outbound passengers on all lines, while the southern platform serves all inbound trains. The B branch uses the inner tracks, while the C and D branches use the outer tracks. West of the station, the B branch crosses the C/D branches at a flying junction. The C and D branches split at a flat junction (Beacon Junction) further to the southwest. The Kenmore Loop connects the outer tracks, allowing inbound C and D trains to reverse direction without entering the main subway. Not normally used for revenue service, the loop is used occasionally during service disruptions.

The fare mezzanine is located over the middle of the platforms, with stairs and escalators from the platforms. Passageways lead to the exits on the north and south sides of Kenmore Square. An escalator and stairs lead to the busway, which is in the middle of the square. One elevator connects the south sidewalk to the fare mezzanine level, another connects the fare lobby to the outbound platform, and a third connects the busway to the inbound platform via the fare lobby.

As the last station in the subway before it splits into surface lines, Kenmore is the terminal for MBTA bus routes . During track work and service disruptions on the three branch lines, substitute bus service is often provided from Kenmore.
==History==

On January 2, 1923, some off-peak trips of the –Pleasant Street shuttle were extended through the Boylston Street Subway to the surface station at Kenmore; all-day service began on October 10. Most trips were extended along the Beacon Street line to on December 14, 1929. The Washington Street service was cut back to Kenmore in June 1930 but resumed that September. On February 7, 1931, Commonwealth Avenue and Beacon Street service was extended from Park Street to Lechmere, and the existing shuttle services to Lechmere were replaced with Kenmore–Park Street shuttles.

The subway station opened on October 23, 1932, replacing the former Kenmore Incline – whose portal archway can still be seen east of Kenmore Square – and the surface station. The Commonwealth Avenue and Beacon Street services – now the B and C branches – were routed through the station from its opening day. The Kenmore cutback was replaced with a pocket track at .

The Commonwealth Avenue line was planned to be eventually converted to use high-platform metro stock (like the other subway lines), and was to move into a tunnel under Commonwealth Avenue, while the Beacon Street line was to use the short turn loop rather than continuing into the Boylston Street subway. Streetcar passengers would make a cross-platform transfer to subway trains, similar to the then-recently-opened Ashmont station. The streetcar tracks were placed on a wooden structure in the station and at the surface incline pending the future tunnel extension. Over the years, it became clear that the Commonwealth Avenue line was unlikely to be converted to heavy rail service. In the 1980s, the wooden structure was removed and the cavity was filled with dirt and concrete.

Bus service to Kenmore began in 1933 as replacement for the Ipswich Street line. Buses originally stopped at the curb, which required them to cut across multiple lanes of traffic to loop from inbound to outbound. In early 1939, the Chamber of Commerce proposed a busway in the center of the square, with direct access to the station mezzanine below. Mayor Maurice J. Tobin initially supported the plan, but soon refused to allow the city to pay for it. The proposal was raised again in 1943, and Tobin awarded a $24,063 contract on June 28. The busway, which had a concrete platform and a wooden shelter, opened along with a direct stairway to the mezzanine on November 4, 1943.

===MBTA era===

Service on the Highland branch (now the D branch) began on July 4, 1959. Until its shutdown in 1969, the A branch to Watertown Yard shared the B-branch tracks, running along Commonwealth Avenue to Packard&#x27;s Corner, where it branched off onto Brighton Avenue. A $314,300 reconstruction of the busway and $342,000 in station modernization work began in 1967. The new busway shelter had red brick walls with a fluted concrete-and-plastic canopy; an escalator from mezzanine to busway was added. The busway work was finished in April 1968, with the modernization completed in 1970. The work included the addition of abstract murals depicting neighborhood scenes on the station signs.

The station was closed for two months in 1996, after the Muddy River overflowed its banks, completely submerging the platform and some of the mezzanine. During the closure, substitute service was provided by commuter rail trains between Riverside and South Station. A similar flood previously occurred on October 6, 1962, requiring closure of the station for five days. In 2019, the MBTA installed steel doors at the Fenway portal to prevent future flooding.
===Renovation===
The MBTA began its Light Rail Accessibility Program in 1996. Design for renovations to make Kenmore accessible began in May 1996, with construction then expected to last from 2002 to 2004. Preliminary designs for a conical glass-covered busway shelter to replace the old rectangular shelter were released in 2001. Separately, the south entrance to the station was moved inside the Boston University-funded Hotel Commonwealth during its 2002-03 construction. A $22.7 million construction contract was ultimately issued on November 10, 2004, with construction starting in January 2005. Temporary bus stops on Beacon Street were used during construction.

Work included construction of the busway shelter, raising the platforms, and addition of three elevators and three escalators. The project also involved streetscape improvements with trees and brick sidewalks, intended to make Kenmore Square resemble Beacon Hill and the Back Bay as a break from its rough reputation.

The work was originally to be completed in early 2007, but delays mounted. A lawsuit settled by the MBTA in 2006 required changes to how accessibility renovations were designed. Previously undocumented utilities delayed excavation, and keeping the station open during construction presented difficulties. Two sets of stairs had to be kept open during the baseball season, which was prolonged when the Red Sox went to the playoffs in 2005, 2006, 2008, and 2009. The metal frame of the shelter was erected in 2006, but the fasteners for the glass had to be redesigned, delaying progress by several months. By November 2007, the project was projected to be completed in late 2008 – almost two years late – with the cost increased to $32 million.

The station ultimately became accessible in January 2010. The total cost was $50.6 million; the original base contract had increased from $22.7 million to $40.7 million, almost entirely because of change orders for which the MBTA was at fault. Art panels featuring Red Sox players on station signs were unveiled at a ribbon-cutting ceremony on April 22, 2010.

<text>Ernest Kaʻai (1881–1962) was considered by many to have been the foremost ukulele authority of his time and is noted by some as being &quot;Hawaii&#x27;s Greatest Ukulele Player&quot;. Kaʻai, who was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, was said to have been the first musician to play a complete melody with chords. He was the son of Simon Kaloa Kaʻai, a prominent politician during the Kingdom of Hawaii.

==Career==
A musical director at many Honolulu hotels, Kaʻai hired Johnny Noble in 1917. 

He was a multi-talented empresario who was also a live performer and teacher, as well as a talent organizer and booking agent, composer and music publisher, and author of instructional manuals. He was the first Hawaiian to copyright his music. At one point Ka&#x27;ai had as many as 12 different bands performing on the islands. He even toured as far as New Zealand, where a 1911 performance in Dunedin attracted a large &quot;most enthusiatic&quot; and &quot;animated&quot; Māori audience. 

From 1927 to 1937, Ka&#x27;ia toured extensively through Asia introducing his teaching methods and making recordings while in Japan.

Kaʻai ran the Kaʻai Ukulele Manufacturing Company, which he sold in 1917 and bought shares in the Aloha Ukulele Manufacturing Co.

In 1923, Kaʻai toured the Far East and Australia, moving to Sri Lanka. He planned to open a &quot;Hawaiian Village&quot; in Shanghai, China, but the Second Sino-Japanese War changed his plans and he returned to Hawaii in 1937.

By 1941, Kaʻai was living in Miami, Florida where he opened a music store, taught and performed occasionally. The National Guitar Convention in Cleveland, Ohio on August 13–15, 1944, was entertained with a benefit concert by a Miami girl quartet with Kaʻai as the quartet&#x27;s director. Kaʻai opened the Kaʻai Music Studios, which in 1946 provided a string ensemble for a December 27–28 Orange Bowl Celebration. The &quot;Miami News&quot; of May 29, 1949, reported Kaʻai would be accompanying vocalist Lucile Keyes for her June 4 performance at a fashion show during Fiesta. June 1950 found Kaʻai one among 200 volunteers in rehearsals for the 10 Youth Roundup Goodwill Units.

==Death==

Ernest Kaleihoku Kaʻai died in Miami on September 26, 1962.

<doc id="827657" wikidata="Q5153276" url="?curid=827657" title="Common Alerting Protocol">
<text>The Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) is an XML-based data format for exchanging public warnings and emergencies between alerting technologies. CAP allows a warning message to be consistently disseminated simultaneously over many warning systems to many applications, such as Google Public Alerts and Cell Broadcast. CAP increases warning effectiveness and simplifies the task of activating a warning for responsible officials.

Standardized alerts can be received from many sources and configure their applications to process and respond to the alerts as desired. Alerts from the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of the Interior&#x27;s United States Geological Survey, and the United States Department of Commerce&#x27;s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and state and local government agencies can all be received in the same format by the same application. That application can, for example, sound different alarms, based on the information received.

By normalizing alert data across threats, jurisdictions, and warning systems, CAP also can be used to detect trends and patterns in warning activity, such as trends that might indicate an undetected hazard or hostile act. From a procedural perspective, CAP reinforces a research-based template for effective warning message content and structure.

The CAP data structure is backward-compatible with existing alert formats including the Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME) used in NOAA Weather Radio and the broadcast Emergency Alert System as well as new technology such as the Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA), while adding capabilities such as the following:
*Flexible geographic targeting by using latitude/longitude “boxes” and other geospatial representations in three dimensions
*Multilingual and multi-audience messaging
*Phased and delayed effective times and expirations
*Enhanced message update and cancellation features
*Template support for framing complete and effective warning messages
*Digital encryption and signature capability
*Facility for digital images, audio, and video.

==Background==
The US National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) November 2000 report on &quot;Effective Disaster Warnings&quot; recommended that &quot;standard method should be developed to collect and relay instantaneously and automatically all types of hazard warnings and reports locally, regionally and nationally for input into a wide variety of dissemination systems.&quot;

In 2001, an international independent group of over 120 emergency managers that was convened online by California emergency telecommunications expert Art Botterell began specifying and prototyping the Common Alerting Protocol data structure based on the recommendations of the NSTC report. The project was embraced by the non-profit Partnership for Public Warning and a number of international warning system vendors. A series of field trials and long-term demonstration projects during 2002-03 led to the submission of a draft CAP specification to the OASIS standards process for formalization.

The CAP 1.0 specification was approved by OASIS in April 2004. Based on experience with CAP 1.0, the OASIS Emergency Management Technical Committee adopted an updated CAP 1.1 specification in October 2005. At a meeting in Geneva in October 2006 the CAP 1.1 specification was taken under consideration by the International Telecommunication Union&#x27;s Standardization Sector for adoption as an ITU-T recommendation. CAP was subsequently adopted as Recommendation X.1303.

CAP specification version 1.2 has been available since July 2010 at the OASIS website.

==Implementation==
===Worldwide===
In 2007, the International Telecommunication Union, Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) adopted the Common Alerting Protocol as Recommendation X.1303. The recommendation annex contains an authoritative ASN.1 module translation of the CAP XML schema that may be useful for some implementations. Rec. X.1303 is within the remit of ITU‑T Study Group 17 (Security), Rapporteur Group on Cybersecurity (Q.4/17) for purposes of further evolution of the standard.

===Australia===
The Australian Government Standard for Common Alerting Protocol (CAP-AU-STD, 2012) was developed by a CAP-AU-STD stakeholder group comprising federal agencies Emergency Management Australia, the Bureau of Meteorology, GeoScience Australia, Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the Department of Health as well as a number of State Government authorities and emergency services agencies. The project was co-ordinated by the Australian Government Attorney-General&#x27;s Department (Australian Emergency Management).

===Canada===
In Canada, a working group composed of public alerting practitioners and government agencies has developed a CAP Canadian Profile (CAP-CP) based on CAP but specialized to address the needs of Canadian public alerting stakeholders, such as bilingualism, geocoding for Canada, managed lists of locations and events, etc. The Canadian government has adopted CAP-CP for its National Public Alerting System (NPAS) project. The CAP‑CP working group, along with stakeholders and projects such as the Canadian Public Safety Operations Organization (CanOps) and Netalerts&#x27; Sarnia Lambton trial, are now working with and refining CAP‑CP for national application in Canada.

CAP has been implemented for a small-scale, grassroots hazard information system in Sri Lanka following the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. This implementation was part of the &quot;HazInfo Project&quot;, funded by Canada&#x27;s International Development Research Centre.

The province of Alberta adopted CAP as part of its Alberta Emergency Alert system. In March 2015, Alert Ready, a national public warning system based upon CAP-CP, was officially launched. Participation in the system by all broadcasters and television providers is mandated by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission.

===Germany===
The Federal Office for Citizen Protection and Disaster Support (&quot;Bundesamt für Bevölkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilf&quot;e, BBK) is working on an implementation based on CAP 1.2, which will allow for Internet-based access to data provided by the nation&#x27;s modular warning system MoWaS. The development of MoWaS is based on the satellite-based warning system SatWaS from 2001, which only provides information to less than 150 state and media entities. In case no broadcast receiver, like a radio or television, is running nearby, the resulting warning effect of SatWaS would be severely limited, because many state-run emergency sirens have been left unmaintained or were dismantled altogether. The use of CAP support in MoWaS should alleviate this problem.

===Italy===
The Department of Firefighters, Public Rescue and Civil Defence (Dipartimento dei Vigili del Fuoco, del Soccorso Pubblico e della Difesa Civile ) of the Italian Ministry of the Interior adopted the CAP protocol with two Ministerial Decrees in 2008 and 2011. Since then, its 100 provincial control rooms, 18 regional control rooms and the national control centre exchange a daily average of 25,000 CAP private messages concerning rescue operations in real time. As per the decrees, any emergency stakeholder in Italy which wants to exchange or share data with the Fire Corps in the course of large scale emergency or rescue operations has to adopt the CAP protocol.

The first use of CAP protocol in a civil protection activity in Italy was recorded in 2009, in the aftermath of the Central Italy Earthquake, when the Fire Corps exchanged data with the Ministry for Cultural Heritage to coordinate their efforts in designing and implementing provisional measures for monuments and historical buildings. 

On April 5, 2017, an agreement between the &quot;Corpo Nazionale dei Vigili del Fuoco&quot; and the &quot;Arma dei Carabinieri&quot; has been signed to improve the forest fire fighting activities. The interoperability of data exchange that the agreement allows is based on the use of the CAP protocol.

===United States===
On September 30, 2010, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) officially adopted CAP as the protocol for its new Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS), which is designed to disseminate emergency messages via various platforms, including broadcast media (Emergency Alert System), wireless devices (Wireless Emergency Alerts), and other platforms.

<text>In mathematics, a bundle is a generalization of a fiber bundle dropping the condition of a local product structure. The requirement of a local product structure rests on the bundle having a topology. Without this requirement, more general objects can be considered bundles. For example, one can consider a bundle π: &quot;E&quot; → &quot;B&quot; with &quot;E&quot; and &quot;B&quot; sets. It is no longer true that the preimages formula_1 must all look alike, unlike fiber bundles, where the fibers must all be isomorphic (in the case of vector bundles) and homeomorphic.

== Definition ==
A bundle is a triple where are sets and is a map.
* is called the total space
* is the base space of the bundle
* is the projection

This definition of a bundle is quite unrestrictive. For instance, the empty function defines a bundle. Nonetheless it serves well to introduce the basic terminology, and every type of bundle has the basic ingredients of above with restrictions on and usually there is additional structure.

For each is the fibre or fiber of the bundle over .

A bundle is a subbundle of if and .

A cross section is a map such that for each , that is, .

== Examples ==
*If and are smooth manifolds and is smooth, surjective and in addition a submersion, then the bundle is a fibered manifold. Here and in the following examples, the smoothness condition may be weakened to continuous or sharpened to analytic, or it could be anything reasonable, like continuously differentiable (), in between.
*If for each two points and in the base, the corresponding fibers and are homotopy equivalent, then the bundle is a fibration.
*If for each two points and in the base, the corresponding fibers and are homeomorphic, and in addition the bundle satisfies certain conditions of &quot;local triviality&quot; outlined in the pertaining linked articles, then the bundle is a fiber bundle. Usually there is additional structure, e.g. a group structure or a vector space structure, on the fibers besides a topology. Then is required that the homeomorphism is an isomorphism with respect to that structure, and the conditions of local triviality are sharpened accordingly.
*A principal bundle is a fiber bundle endowed with a right group action with certain properties. One example of a principal bundle is the frame bundle.
*If for each two points and in the base, the corresponding fibers and are vector spaces of the same dimension, then the bundle is a vector bundle if the appropriate conditions of local triviality are satisfied. The tangent bundle is an example of a vector bundle.

==Bundle objects==
More generally, bundles or bundle objects can be defined in any category: in a category C, a bundle is simply an epimorphism π: &quot;E&quot; → &quot;B&quot;. If the category is not concrete, then the notion of a preimage of the map is not necessarily available. Therefore these bundles may have no fibers at all, although for sufficiently well behaved categories they do; for instance, for a category with pullbacks and a terminal object 1 the points of &quot;B&quot; can be identified with morphisms &quot;p&quot;:1→&quot;B&quot; and the fiber of &quot;p&quot; is obtained as the pullback of &quot;p&quot; and π. The category of bundles over &quot;B&quot; is a subcategory of the slice category (C↓&quot;B&quot;) of objects over &quot;B&quot;, while the category of bundles without fixed base object is a subcategory of the comma category (&quot;C&quot;↓&quot;C&quot;) which is also the functor category C², the category of morphisms in C.

The category of smooth vector bundles is a bundle object over the category of smooth manifolds in Cat, the category of small categories. The functor taking each manifold to its tangent bundle is an example of a section of this bundle object.

<text>Graham Stuart Staines (18 January 1941 – 23 January 1999) was an Australian Christian missionary, who along with his two sons, Philip (aged 10) and Timothy (aged 6), was burnt to death in India by members of the Hindu nationalist group, Bajrang Dal. In 2003, Bajrang Dal activist Dara Singh was convicted of leading the murderers and was sentenced to life in prison.

Staines had been working in Odisha since 1965 as part of an evangelical missionary organisation named &quot;Mayurbhanj Leprosy Home&quot; caring for people who had leprosy and looking after the tribal people in the area who lived in abject poverty. However, some Hindu groups argue that during this time he had tricked, lured or forcibly coerced many Hindus into believing in the Christian faith. The Wadhwa Commission claims that although some tribals had been baptised at the camps, there was no evidence of forced conversions. Staines&#x27;s widow Gladys has also denied forced conversions ever happened.

Gladys continued to live and work in India caring for those who were poor and were affected by leprosy until she returned home to Australia in 2004. In 2005, she was awarded the fourth highest civilian honour of India, the Padma Shree, in recognition for her work in Odisha. In 2016, she received the Mother Teresa Memorial International Award for Social Justice.

==Early life and early career==
Graham Staines was born in the Sunshine Coast suburb of Palmwoods in the Australian state of Queensland. He visited India for the first time in 1965 by joining the Evangelical Missionary Society of Mayurbhanj (EMSM), and work in the remote tribal area of Odisha state, which had a long history of active Christian missionary style work. He took over the management of the Mission at Baripada in 1983 after helping to establish the Mayurbhanj Leprosy Home as a registered society in 1982.

== Personal life ==
Staines met Gladys in June 1981, while they worked together taking care of leprosy patients on the mission field. Not too long after that they decided to get married, in 1983; they worked together until his death. Together they had three children: a daughter, Esther, and two sons, Philip and Timothy. During the course of his work Staines had managed to assist in the translation of part of the Holy Christian Bible into the language of the Ho people of India, which included his crosschecking the work with the entire manuscript of the New Testament, though it is largely believed his main focus was on his ministry to the lepers. It was reported that he could speak the Odia language fluently, and was popular among the patients whom he had managed to cure. In addition to this it was also reported that he used to teach people how to make mats and baskets out of rope, sabai grass (Eulaliopsis binata) and tree leaves.

==Death and reaction==
On 22 January 1999, Staines attended a jungle camp in Manoharpur, which was an annual gathering for Christians in the area to congregate for a conference and discuss their beliefs in a social setting. The camp was on the border between the tribal villages of Mayurbhanj and Keonjhar, which is located within the district of Odisha. He was travelling to the village of Kendujhar with his sons, who were on a break from their schooling in the hill city of Ooty in southern India, when they decided to take a break from the journey towards the jungle camp, and elected to spend the night in Manoharpur, sleeping in the vehicle due to the severe cold at the time. His wife and daughter did not accompany them on the journey, having decided to remain behind in the town and municipality of Baripada.

A mob of about fifty people, armed with axes and other implements, attacked the vehicle while Staines and his sons were fast asleep, and set the station wagon alight, trapping them inside and burning them to death. Current BJP MP Pratap Chandra Sarangi was also believed to be a part of this murder as he was Odisha State Unit Chief of the Bajrang Dal during this planned murder.

Staines and his sons had awakened and apparently tried to escape but were prevented from doing so by the angry mob of vigilantes.

The murders were widely condemned by religious and civic leaders of the time, along with politicians and journalists. The US-based Human Rights Watch group accused the Indian government of failing to prevent violence against Christians, and for exploiting the sectarian tensions that existed at the time for their own political gain. Then-prime minister of India, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, a leader of the BJP, condemned the &quot;ghastly attack,&quot; and called for swift action in catching the killers. Published reports stated that the church leaders alleged the attacks were carried out at the behest of hard-line Hindu organizations seeking revenge for what they perceived to be forced conversions of the tribal poor into Christianity. Dara Singh, who was convicted of the murders, was treated as a hero by the hard-line Hindus and reportedly protected by some villagers. In an interview with the &quot;Hindustan Times&quot;, one of the accused killers, Mahendra Hembram, stated that the killers &quot;were provoked by the &#x27;corruption of tribal culture&#x27; by the missionaries, who they claimed fed villagers beef, and gave the women brassieres and sanitary towels.&quot;

In her affidavit before the commission on the death of her husband and both sons, Gladys Staines stated:The Lord God is always with me to guide me and to help me try to accomplish the work of Graham, but I sometimes wonder why Graham was killed, and what also made his assassins behave in such a brutal manner on the night of the 22nd/23rd of January 1999. ... It is far from my mind to punish the persons who were responsible for the death of my husband Graham and my two children. But it is my desire and hope that they would repent and be reformed.
== In popular culture ==
&quot;The Least of These: The Graham Staines Story&quot;, a film that is based on his killing, was released in 2019.

==Supreme Court of India judgement==
A trial (sessions) court in Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha (then named Orissa), sentenced the convicted ringleader of the mob, Dara Singh, to death by hanging for killing Staines and his two sons. In 2005, the Orissa High Court commuted the sentence to life imprisonment. The Supreme Court upheld the High Court decision on 21 January 2011.

&quot;In the case on hand, though Graham Staines and his two minor sons were burnt to death while they were sleeping inside a station wagon at Manoharpur, the intention was to teach a lesson to Graham Staines about his religious activities, namely, converting poor tribals to Christianity. All these aspects have been correctly appreciated by the High Court and modified the sentence of death into life imprisonment with which we concur.&quot; the court declared. The Court stated, &quot;Our concept of secularism is that the State will have no religion. The State shall treat all religions and religious groups equally and with equal respect without in any manner interfering with their individual right of religion, faith and worship.&quot; The Court also said, &quot;It is undisputed that there is no justification for interfering in someone&#x27;s belief by way of &#x27;use of force&#x27;, provocation, conversion, incitement or upon a flawed premise that one religion is better than the other&quot;.

Dismissing the Central Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s plea for sentencing Singh to death, a Bench of Justice P. Sathasivam and Justice B. S. Chauhan endorsed the Orissa High Court&#x27;s finding that his crime did not fall under the rarest of rare category. In its 76-page judgment, the court came out strongly against the practice of conversion. However, four days later, on 25 January 2011, the Supreme Court of India, in a rare move, expunged its own comments with regards to conversions from its verdict. This was perhaps done due to severe criticism from the media. Leading editors, media groups, and civil society members from across the country signed a statement taking strong exception to the Supreme Court&#x27;s observation that the killing of Graham Staines and his two minor children was intended to teach the Australian missionary a lesson for preaching and practising conversion.

<text>William Harold Terry (October 30, 1898 – January 9, 1989) was an American professional baseball first baseman and manager. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Giants from 1923 to 1936 and managed the Giants from 1932 to 1941. Terry was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1954. In 1999, he ranked number 59 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. The Giants retired Terry&#x27;s uniform number 3 in 1984; it is posted on the facade of the upper deck in the left field corner of Oracle Park. Nicknamed &quot;Memphis Bill&quot;, he is most remembered for being the last National League player to hit .400, a feat he accomplished by batting .401 in 1930.

==Playing career==
===Early years===
Born in Atlanta, Terry made his professional baseball debut in 1915 at the age of 16. He began his career as a pitcher, playing for two separate minor league teams, the Newnan Cowetas of the Georgia–Alabama League and the Dothan, Alabama based Dothan club of the FLAG League. With Newnan, he had a win–loss record of 7–1, with an 0.60 earned run average in eight games.

After starting 1916 with Newnan, by the end of the year he had moved up to the class-B Shreveport Gassers of the Texas League. He again compiled impressive statistics for his new team, putting up a record of 6–2 with a 1.07 earned run average in 11 games with Shreveport. Terry spent all of 1917 with Shreveport, with a record of 14–11 and an earned run average of 3.00. By this time, he was also beginning to play more in the field, pitching in 40 games and appearing in 55 other games.

After spending several years playing semi-professionally, Terry was picked up by the Toledo Mud Hens of the American Association in 1922. He was now playing in double-A, the highest minor league level at that time. While he was still pitching, putting up a 9–9 record in 26 games, his hitting was also starting to pick up. In 88 games with Toledo, Terry batted .336 with 14 home runs.

In 1923, Terry had been converted into a full-time first baseman. In 109 games with Toledo that year, Terry batted .377 with 15 home runs. This gained the notice of the major league New York Giants, and on September 18 they purchased his contract from the Mud Hens. In an interesting coincidence, Freddie Lindstrom, another future Hall of Fame player, was also purchased by the Giants from the Mud Hens on the same day.

===Starting out in the majors===
Terry made his major league debut with the Giants on September 24, 1923 in a game against the Cincinnati Reds. In that game, he pinch-hit for Giants pitcher Rosy Ryan, going 0-for-1. Terry did not play again until September 30, when he made his first appearance in the starting lineup against the Boston Braves. Terry got his first major league hit in that game, going 1-for-3 and scoring his first major league run. Terry finished the season with one hit in seven at bats in three games.

Terry played all of 1924 with the Giants, backing up fellow future Hall of Famer George Kelly at first base for the pennant-winning team. Terry played in 77 games, 35 at first base and the rest as a pinch-hitter. He batted .239 with 5 home runs and 24 runs batted in. In the World Series against the Washington Senators, he batted .429, including a Game 1 home run off Walter Johnson.

===Into and out of the starting lineup===
In 1925, Giants starting third baseman Heinie Groh suffered an injury early in the season, forcing the team to juggle its lineup a bit. Starting second baseman Frankie Frisch was tried at third but wound up spending most of the season shifting around the infield when Lindstrom was made the starter. Kelly was moved from first base to second, and Terry was installed as the starting first baseman. He hit .319 in 133 games, with 11 homers and 70 runs batted in.

In 1926, with Lindstrom established as the starter at third, Frisch was reinstated at second and Kelly moved back to first, sending Terry back into a reserve role. In addition to backing up Kelly, Terry played in 14 games in the outfield. This was the only season in which he played more than one game at a position other than first base. Overall, Terry played 98 games, batting .289 with 5 home runs and 43 runs batted in.

===1927: Breakout year===

During the following offseason, the Giants made some major changes to their starting lineup. On December 20, 1926, they traded Frisch and pitcher Jimmy Ring to the St. Louis Cardinals for Rogers Hornsby. Then, on February 9, they traded Kelly to the Reds for outfielder Edd Roush, opening a spot once more for Terry in the starting lineup. Terry batted .326 in 1927, with 20 home runs and 121 runs batted in. He finished 13th in the voting for the Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award, and his days of being a backup were behind him for good.

===History in the making===
Over the next two seasons, Terry continued to produce for the Giants, batting .326 again in 1928 with 101 runs batted in, and then .372 in 1929 with 117 runs batted in. In both years, he finished in the top ten in the National League in a number of statistical categories and in 1929 he finished third in the Most Valuable Player Award voting. This led to what is generally considered Terry&#x27;s best season ever, 1930.

In 1930, Terry had an historic season. He finished first in the National League with a .401 batting average, the first player to hit over .400 since Rogers Hornsby in 1925. It is also the last time to date that anyone in the National League has hit .400. Only Ted Williams of the American League&#x27;s Boston Red Sox in 1941 has hit .400 since. Terry also led the league with 254 hits, which is tied for the most in NL history with the Phillies&#x27; Lefty O&#x27;Doul&#x27;s 254 in 1929. He also finished 5th in the league in on-base percentage (.452), 7th in slugging percentage (.619), 6th in runs scored with 139 runs, and led the league in putouts and assists by a first baseman. While there was no official league most valuable player award in 1930, Terry won &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Most Valuable Player Award.

===Player-manager===

While Terry never again reached the lofty heights of 1930, he had another excellent season in 1931. He led the league in runs scored with 121 and in triples with 20 while batting .349 with 112 runs batted in, and he finished third in the new Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America National League Most Valuable Player Award voting. He became the only Giants player (as of 2014) to hit two doubles and two triples in a game when he did so against the Cincinnati Reds on September 13, 1931. In 1932, Terry set his career high in home runs with 28, batting .350 with 117 runs batted in. He was also named the team&#x27;s manager in early June, replacing the legendary John McGraw. He hit three home runs in a game in a losing effort against the Brooklyn Dodgers. The team finished in sixth place, going 55–59 under Terry.

=== 1933: World Series championship ===
In 1933, Terry&#x27;s first full season as manager, the team won the National League pennant and the World Series. Although, as a player, Terry missed a month early in the season with an injury, he still hit .322. It was also the first season of the All-Star Game, for which Terry was chosen as a starter and in which he got two hits. The Giants once again faced the Senators in the 1933 World Series, which they won four games to one. Terry went 6-for-22, hitting a home run in Game 4 off Monte Weaver. Despite an off-year, Terry still finished fourth in the MVP voting, perhaps gaining votes for managing the team to the championship, the Giants&#x27; first since 1922, the year before Terry&#x27;s MLB debut.

===Career winding down===
In 1934 Terry came back to put up big numbers once more, finishing second in the NL in batting at .354 and in hits with 213 while finishing seventh in the Most Valuable Player Award voting. Terry managed the team to a seven-game lead in the National League on September 6, but the Giants lost 13 of their final 21 games and fell to second place at season&#x27;s end, just two games behind the pennant-winning St. Louis Cardinals &quot;Gashouse Gang&quot;. In 1935, Terry again got over 200 hits with 203, and batted .341 while finishing sixth in the Most Valuable Player Award voting, and managed the team to a third-place finish. In both years he was again selected to start in the All-Star game. As manager, Terry became an advocate of platooning, as Hank Leiber and Jimmy Ripple split playing time in center field.

1936 was Terry&#x27;s last year as a player. Before the season started, the team had purchased Sam Leslie from the Brooklyn Dodgers. Terry split time at first base with Leslie, with the newcomer getting the lion&#x27;s share. It worked out well for the team, as they again won the pennant, beating the Cardinals by five games. In the World Series, Terry started all six games, but batted just .240 with no extra base hits. He had five runs batted in, but that was not enough, as the Giants lost to the New York Yankees, four games to two.

==Remaining managerial career==
Terry retired as a player after the 1936 season, but continued to manage the Giants until . He also held the title of general manager of the Giants from September 7, 1937, through the end of the 1942 season. The Giants won another pennant in 1937, but they lost another World Series to the New York Yankees, four games to one. The team finished third in 1938, but never again finished in the first division under Terry, finishing fifth, sixth, and fifth in his last three years as manager. Terry resigned as manager after the 1941 season and named Mel Ott, his teammate since 1926, as his successor.

===Managerial record===
==Ownership career==
After retiring from playing and managing, Terry settled in Jacksonville, Florida, where he owned a successful Buick automobile dealership and purchased the Jacksonville Braves double-A team in 1958.

==Career summary==

Over his 14-year career, Terry posted seven seasons with 100 or more runs, six seasons with 100 or more runs batted in, six seasons with at least 200 hits, and nine consecutive seasons batting .320 or higher, from 1927 through 1935; additionally he posted three seasons with at least 20 home runs, including a career high of 28 in 1932. Terry retired with 1120 runs scored, 154 home runs, 1078 runs batted in and a .341 batting average. He also currently holds the record for the highest career batting average for a left-handed hitter in the National League at .341. Terry was also one of the best fielding first baseman of his era, compiling a career .992 fielding percentage.

Terry accumulated 7 five-hit games and 40 four-hit games in his MLB career.

As a manager, he led the Giants to three National League pennants and a world championship. In nine full seasons as a manager, he only had a losing season twice while finishing in the top three of the League six times. No Giants manager would lead them to three league pennants until Bruce Bochy did so nearly seventy years later.

==Baseball honors==

Terry was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1954. In 1999, he ranked number 59 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. The Giants retired Terry&#x27;s uniform no. 3 in 1984; it is posted on the facade of the upper deck in the left field corner of Oracle Park.

<text>Cần Thơ, anglicized as Can Tho or Cantho, is the fourth-largest city in Vietnam, and the largest city along the Mekong Delta region in Vietnam. It is noted for its floating markets, rice paper-making village, and picturesque rural canals. It has a population of around 1,507,187 as of 2024, and is located on the south bank of the Hậu River, a distributary of the Mekong River.

In 2007, about 50 people died when the Cần Thơ Bridge collapsed, causing Vietnam&#x27;s worst engineering disaster. In 2011, Cần Thơ International Airport opened. The city is nicknamed the &quot;Western Metropolis&quot; (), and is located from Hồ Chí Minh City.

== History ==
During the Vietnam War, Cần Thơ was the home of the ARVN IV Corps capital. The ARVN 21st division was dedicated to protect the city of Cần Thơ, including the provinces of Chương Thiện (now in Hậu Giang), Bạc Liêu, An Xuyen (Cà Mau), Ba Xuyen (Soc Trang), and Kiên Giang. Before 1975, Cần Thơ was part of Phong Dinh province. On November 1, 1955, the third Light Division changed into the thirteenth Light Division, and the fifteenth, twelfth, and 106th regiments transformed into the 37th, 38th, and 39th regiments. The 37th and 38th Regiments consisted of battalions that originated in the present MR 3. The 39th regiment consisted of battalions from My Tho and Sa Dec in the Delta. The 39th Regiment participated in the successful campaigns against dissidents in Hua Hau in 1955–1956.

==Administrative system==
The city is an independent municipality at the same level as the other provinces of Vietnam. It was created in the beginning of 2004 by a split of the former Cần Thơ Province into two new administrative units: Cần Thơ City and Hậu Giang Province.

Cần Thơ is subdivided into nine district-level sub-divisions:
* 5 urban districts:
** Bình Thủy
** Cái Răng
** Ninh Kiều
** Ô Môn
** Thốt Nốt
* 4 rural districts:
** Cờ Đỏ
** Phong Điền
** Thới Lai
** Vĩnh Thạnh
They are further subdivided into five commune-level towns (or townlets), 36 communes, and 44 wards.

Ninh Kiều, which has the well-known Ninh Kiều port, is the central district and also the most populated and wealthiest of these districts.

The city borders the provinces of An Giang, Hậu Giang, Kiên Giang, Vĩnh Long and Đồng Tháp.

==Transportation==
Before 1975, National Highway 4 (now National Route 1) bypassed the ferry from Binh Minh, VL to Cần Thơ where the ARVN 21st division patrolled heavily the ferry transportation to protect the civilians and ship merchants. South of the National Highway 4 from Cần Thơ to Ba Xuyen province (Soc Trang) were mainly heavily patrolled by ARVN soldiers to prevent route disruption.

Today, Cần Thơ is connected to the rest of the country by National Route 1A and Cần Thơ International Airport. The city&#x27;s bridge, which is now completed, is the longest cable-stayed bridge in Southeast Asia. The six-lane Saigon–Cần Thơ Expressway is being built in parts from Hồ Chí Minh City to Mỹ Tho. Hydrofoil express boats link this city with Hồ Chí Minh City. From Phú Quốc island, tourists can use the ferry, passenger bus or taxi to transfer to Cần Thơ. There are many vehicles such as taxis, Grab motorbikes, buses, vans and coaches.

==Tourism==

<doc id="827691" wikidata="Q6386822" url="?curid=827691" title="Kemal Bokhary">
<text>Syed Kemal Shah Bokhary (, ; born 25 October 1947) is a judge in Hong Kong. He was one of three Permanent Judges of Hong Kong&#x27;s Court of Final Appeal from its inception in 1997 until he reached the mandatory retirement age of 65 in October 2012; afterwards, he remained on the bench as a non-permanent judge.

==Early life and family==
Bokhary&#x27;s father is Daoud Bokhary, a native of the North-West Frontier Province in the British India (now Pakistan) who came to Hong Kong with the British Indian Army after the Japanese occupation. His mother&#x27;s family had been in Hong Kong since the 19th century. Bokhary himself was born in Kowloon, Hong Kong in 1947. He received his early education in the King George V School, Hong Kong and his legal education in London. Bokhary is married to former High Court judge Verina Saeeda Bokhary, with whom he has three daughters.

==Career==
Bokhary was called to the English Bar in 1970 and to the Hong Kong Bar the following year. He went on to establish a successful legal practice in Hong Kong and was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1983. The following year, he also became a Justice of the Peace. In 1989, he was appointed a Judge of the High Court. He came to wide public attention in early 1993 for presiding over an inquest into the New Year&#x27;s Eve stampede at Lan Kwai Fong, in which 21 people were killed. He was promoted to the Court of Appeal later that year. In 1997, upon the handover of Hong Kong from Britain to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Bokhary was appointed a Permanent Judge of the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong. He was known for his sense of humour and his talkativeness in court. In 2001, Bokhary was elected a bencher of London&#x27;s Middle Temple.

Out of the permanent judges of the Court of Final Appeal, Bokhary holds the record for the number of dissenting opinions he has written. He is also described as the &quot;most hard-working&quot; judge; during his thirteen years of tenure, he heard 95% (299) of the 313 cases which came before the Court of Final Appeal, a higher proportion than his colleagues. His frequent dissents were thought by some to be &quot;intellectually superior&quot; to opinions written by other members of the bench, and he was nicknamed the &quot;conscience of the court&quot; due to his tendency to rule in accordance with his sense of justice rather than established principles; he has also been described as the &quot;Lord Denning of Hong Kong&quot; by Martin Lee SC.

Bokhary retired from his position as Permanent Judge on 24 October 2012 upon reaching the retirement age of 65. In remarks upon the occasion, he warned of &quot;a storm of unprecedented ferocity&quot; which threatened the judicial autonomy of Hong Kong. Commenting on the decision not to extend his retirement age, Bokhary suggested that, &quot;If you were asking if I believe that the reason why [my retirement age was not] extended is because of my liberal judgements, then I would tell you that I do believe that.&quot; Nevertheless, reflecting on his time on the bench, Bokhary stated that, although opinions between the justices differed on occasion, he never encountered anything less than a highly-cooperative attitude, both at the hearing and judgment-writing stages. He also insisted that Hong Kong judges would always independently apply the law, Beijing&#x27;s power to interpret the Basic Law notwithstanding: “The very fact that there’s an interpretation [from Beijing] shows you that the court is independent. Because if the courts are not independent, then they could just be told quietly behind the scenes what to do, and they would do it. But everybody knows that’s not how it works in Hong Kong.”

In March 2012, Robert Tang was named as his successor. Bokhary has continued to sit as a Non-Permanent Judge, hearing occasional cases.

Since retirement as a Permanent Judge, Bokhary has published &quot;Recollections&quot;, a memoir, and the &quot;Crocky&quot; series, a series of cartoons, reflecting upon his career in the law. 

==Quotes==
*&quot;Humanity is the application.&quot; (&quot;Lau Kong Yung v. Director of Immigration&quot;)
*&#x27;Human rights are aptly named, being basic to and inherent in humankind. ...&quot;have always existed with the human being ... independently of, and before, the State.&quot;&#x27; (&quot;Secretary for Justice v. Yau Yuk Lung Zigo&quot;, citing &quot;Ethiopia v South Africa; Liberia v South Africa&quot;)
*&quot;Of the many and varied purposes for which law is made, none is more important than that of declaring, protecting and realising the full potential of human rights.&quot; (&quot;Secretary for Justice v. Yau Yuk Lung Zigo&quot;)
*&quot;And then I conclude by paying another tribute. It is to the dignity in adversity displayed by all the abode-seekers, including and especially the woman who made every effort to remain composed before ultimately breaking down in tears at the final hearing of this long and sad case. My saying that may only be cold comfort to them. But I consider it right to say it nevertheless.&quot; ()
*&quot;What is the true scope of the protection conferred by the presumption of innocence? [...] Just because the presumption of innocence is a key component of our criminal justice system, it does not follow that the protection which it confers is strictly confined to criminal proceedings. Such protection obviously extends at least to include civil matters connected with such proceedings. [...] The law moves forward, especially to provide better protection and enforcement of fundamental rights and freedoms. [...] Indifference to a fundamental right or freedom is more insidious – and in that sense can be even more dangerous – than any open derogation from that right or freedom. [...] Threats to fundamental rights and freedoms can come in unpredictable shapes and sizes. A constitution&#x27;s protection potential must not be cramped.

<text>A transmission tower (also electricity pylon, hydro tower, or pylon) is a tall structure, usually a lattice tower made of steel that is used to support an overhead power line. In electrical grids, transmission towers carry high-voltage transmission lines that transport bulk electric power from generating stations to electrical substations, from which electricity is delivered to end consumers; moreover, utility poles are used to support lower-voltage sub-transmission and distribution lines that transport electricity from substations to electricity customers.

There are four categories of transmission towers: (i) the suspension tower, (ii) the dead-end terminal tower, (iii) the tension tower, and (iv) the transposition tower.
The heights of transmission towers typically range from , although when longer spans are needed, such as for crossing water, taller towers are sometimes used. More transmission towers are needed to mitigate climate change, and as a result, transmission towers became politically important in the 2020s.

== Terminology ==
&quot;Transmission tower&quot; is the name for the structure used in the industry in the United States and some other English-speaking countries. In Europe and the U.K., the terms &quot;electricity pylon&quot; and &quot;pylon&quot; derive from the basic shape of the structure, an obelisk with a tapered top. In Canada, the term &quot;hydrotower&quot; is used, because hydroelectricity is the principal source of electricity for the country.

== High voltage AC transmission towers ==

Three-phase electric power systems are used for high voltage (66- or 69-kV and above) and extra-high voltage (110- or 115-kV and above; most often 138- or 230-kV and above in contemporary systems) AC transmission lines. In some European countries, e.g. Germany, Spain or Czech Republic, smaller lattice towers are used for medium voltage (above 10 kV) transmission lines too. The towers must be designed to carry three (or multiples of three) conductors. The towers are usually steel lattices or trusses (wooden structures are used in Australia, Canada, Germany, and Scandinavia in some cases) and the insulators are either glass or porcelain discs or composite insulators using silicone rubber or EPDM rubber material assembled in strings or long rods whose lengths are dependent on the line voltage and environmental conditions.

Typically, one or two ground wires, also called &quot;guard&quot; wires, are placed on top to intercept lightning and harmlessly divert it to ground.

Towers for high- and extra-high voltage are usually designed to carry two or more electric circuits.
If a line is constructed using towers designed to carry several circuits, it is not necessary to install all the circuits at the time of construction. Indeed, for economic reasons, some transmission lines are designed for three (or four) circuits, but only two (or three) circuits are initially installed.

Some high voltage circuits are often erected on the same tower as 110 kV lines. Paralleling circuits of 380 kV, 220 kV and 110 kV-lines on the same towers is common. Sometimes, especially with 110 kV circuits, a parallel circuit carries traction lines for railway electrification.

== High voltage DC transmission towers ==

High-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission lines are either monopolar or bipolar systems. With bipolar systems, a conductor arrangement with one conductor on each side of the tower is used. On some schemes, the ground conductor is used as electrode line or ground return. In this case, it had to be installed with insulators equipped with surge arrestors on the pylons in order to prevent electrochemical corrosion of the pylons. For single-pole HVDC transmission with ground return, towers with only one conductor can be used. In many cases, however, the towers are designed for later conversion to a two-pole system. In these cases, often conductors on both sides of the tower are installed for mechanical reasons. Until the second pole is needed, it is either used as electrode line or joined in parallel with the pole in use. In the latter case, the line from the converter station to the earthing (grounding) electrode is built as underground cable, as overhead line on a separate right of way or by using the ground conductors.

Electrode line towers are used in some HVDC schemes to carry the power line from the converter station to the grounding electrode. They are similar to structures used for lines with voltages of 10–30 kV, but normally carry only one or two conductors.

AC transmission towers may be converted to full or mixed HVDC use, to increase power transmission levels at a lower cost than building a new transmission line.

== Railway traction line towers ==

Towers used for single-phase AC railway traction lines are similar in construction to those towers used for 110 kV three-phase lines. Steel tube or concrete poles are also often used for these lines. However, railway traction current systems are two-pole AC systems, so traction lines are designed for two conductors (or multiples of two, usually four, eight, or twelve). These are usually arranged on one level, whereby each circuit occupies one half of the cross arm. For four traction circuits, the arrangement of the conductors is in two levels and for six electric circuits, the arrangement of the conductors is in three levels.

== Tower designs ==

Transmission towers must withstand various external forces, including wind, ice, and seismic activity, while supporting the weight of heavy conductors.

=== Shape ===
Different shapes of transmission towers are typical for different countries. The shape also depends on voltage and number of circuits.

==== One circuit ====

Delta pylons are the most common design for single circuit lines, because of their stability. They have a V-shaped body with a horizontal arm on the top, which forms an inverted delta. Larger Delta towers usually use two guard cables.

Portal pylons are widely used in the USA, Ireland, Scandinavia and Canada. They stand on two legs with one cross arm, which gives them a H-shape. Up to 110 kV they often were made from wood, but higher voltage lines use steel pylons.

Smaller single circuit pylons may have two small cross arms on one side and one on the other.

==== Two circuits ====
One level pylons only have one cross arm carrying 3 cables on each side. Sometimes they have an additional cross arm for the protection cables. They are frequently used close to airports due to their reduced height.

Danube pylons or &quot;Donaumasten&quot; got their name from a line built in 1927 next to the Danube river. They are the most common design in central European countries like Germany or Poland. They have two cross arms, the upper arm carries one and the lower arm carries two cables on each side. Sometimes they have an additional cross arm for the protection cables.

Ton shaped towers are the most common design, they have 3 horizontal levels with one cable very close to the pylon on each side. In the United Kingdom the second level is often (but not always) wider than the other ones while in the United States all cross arms have the same width.

=====T-pylons=====
In 2021 the first T-pylon, a new tubular T-shaped design, was installed in United Kingdom for a new power line to Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, carrying two high voltage 400 kV power lines. The design features electricity cables strung below a cross-arm atop a single pole which reduces the visual impact on the environment compared to lattice pylons. These 36 T-pylons were the first major UK redesign since 1927, designed by Danish company Bystrup, winner of a 2011 competition from more than 250 entries held by the Royal Institute of British Architects and Her Majesty&#x27;s Government.
=====Y-pylons=====
Y-pylons are a newer concept for electrical transmission towers. They usually have a guy-wire or support beam to help support the &quot;Y&quot; shape in the tower.

==== Four circuits ====
Christmas-tree-shaped towers for 4 or even 6 circuits are common in Germany and have 3 cross arms where the highest arm has each one cable, the second has two cables and the third has three cables on each side. The cables on the third arm usually carry circuits for lower high voltage.

====Branch pylons====
Special designed pylons are necessary to introduce branching lines, e.g. to connect nearby substations.

=== Support structures ===
Towers may be self-supporting and capable of resisting all forces due to conductor loads, unbalanced conductors, wind and ice in any direction. Such towers often have approximately square bases and usually four points of contact with the ground.

A semi-flexible tower is designed so that it can use overhead grounding wires to transfer mechanical load to adjacent structures, if a phase conductor breaks and the structure is subject to unbalanced loads. This type is useful at extra-high voltages, where phase conductors are bundled (two or more wires per phase). It is unlikely for all of them to break at once, barring a catastrophic crash or storm.

A guyed mast has a very small footprint and relies on guy wires in tension to support the structure and any unbalanced tension load from the conductors. A guyed tower can be made in a V shape, which saves weight and cost.

=== Materials ===
==== Tubular steel ====
Poles made of tubular steel generally are assembled at the factory and placed on the right-of-way afterward. Because of its durability and ease of manufacturing and installation, many utilities in recent years prefer the use of monopolar steel or concrete towers over lattice steel for new power lines and tower replacements.
In Germany steel tube pylons are also established predominantly for medium voltage lines, in addition, for high voltage transmission lines or two electric circuits for operating voltages by up to 110 kV. Steel tube pylons are also frequently used for 380 kV lines in France, and for 500 kV lines in the United States.

==== Lattice ====
A lattice tower is a framework construction made of steel or aluminium sections. Lattice towers are used for power lines of all voltages, and are the most common type for high-voltage transmission lines. Lattice towers are usually made of galvanized steel. Aluminium is used for reduced weight, such as in mountainous areas where structures are placed by helicopter. Aluminium is also used in environments that would be corrosive to steel. The extra material cost of aluminium towers will be offset by lower installation cost. Design of aluminium lattice towers is similar to that for steel, but must take into account aluminium&#x27;s lower Young&#x27;s modulus.

A lattice tower is usually assembled at the location where it is to be erected. This makes very tall towers possible, up to (and in special cases even higher, as in the Elbe crossing 1 and Elbe crossing 2). Assembly of lattice steel towers can be done using a crane. Lattice steel towers are generally made of angle-profiled steel beams (L-beam or T-beams). For very tall towers, trusses are often used.
==== Wood ====

Wood is a material which is limited in use in high-voltage transmission. Because of the limited height of available trees, the maximum height of wooden pylons is limited to approximately . Wood is rarely used for lattice framework. Instead, they are used to build multi-pole structures, such as H-frame and K-frame structures. The voltages they carry are also limited, such as in other regions, where wood structures only carry voltages up to approximately 30 kV.

In countries such as Canada or the United States, wooden towers carry voltages up to 345 kV; these can be less costly than steel structures and take advantage of the surge voltage insulating properties of wood. , 345 kV lines on wood towers are still in use in the US and some are still being constructed on this technology. Wood can also be used for temporary structures while constructing a permanent replacement.
==== Concrete ====

Concrete pylons are used in Germany normally only for lines with operating voltages below 30 kV. In exceptional cases, concrete pylons are used also for 110 kV lines, as well as for the public grid or for the railway traction current grid. Concrete poles for medium-voltage are also used in Canada and the United States. 

In Switzerland, concrete pylons with heights of up to 59.5 metres (world&#x27;s tallest pylon of prefabricated concrete at Littau) are used for 380 kV overhead lines. In Argentina and some other South American countries, many overhead power lines, except the ultra-high voltage grid, were placed on tubular concrete pylons. Also in former soviet countries, concrete pylons are common, though with crossarms made of steel.

Concrete pylons, which are not prefabricated, are also used for constructions taller than 60 metres. One example is a tall pylon of a 380 kV powerline near Reuter West Power Plant in Berlin. In China some pylons for lines crossing rivers were built of concrete. The tallest of these pylons belong to the Yangtze Powerline crossing at Nanjing with a height of .

=== Special designs ===
Sometimes (in particular on steel lattice towers for the highest voltage levels) transmitting plants are installed, and antennas mounted on the top above or below the overhead ground wire. Usually these installations are for mobile phone services or the operating radio of the power supply firm, but occasionally also for other radio services, like directional radio. Thus transmitting antennas for low-power FM radio and television transmitters were already installed on pylons. On the Elbe Crossing 1 tower, there is a radar facility belonging to the Hamburg water and navigation office.

For crossing broad valleys, a large distance between the conductors must be maintained to avoid short-circuits caused by conductor cables colliding during storms. To achieve this, sometimes a separate mast or tower is used for each conductor. For crossing wide rivers and straits with flat coastlines, very tall towers must be built due to the necessity of a large height clearance for navigation. Such towers and the conductors they carry must be equipped with flight safety lamps and reflectors.

Two well-known wide river crossings are the Elbe Crossing 1 and Elbe Crossing 2. The latter has the tallest overhead line masts in Europe, at tall. In Spain, the overhead line crossing pylons in the Spanish bay of Cádiz have a particularly interesting construction. The main crossing towers are tall with one crossarm atop a frustum framework construction. The longest overhead line spans are the crossing of the Norwegian Sognefjord Span ( between two masts) and the Ameralik Span in Greenland (). In Germany, the overhead line of the EnBW AG crossing of the Eyachtal has the longest span in the country at .

In order to drop overhead lines into steep, deep valleys, inclined towers are occasionally used. These are utilized at the Hoover Dam, located in the United States, to descend the cliff walls of the Black Canyon of the Colorado. In Switzerland, a pylon inclined around 20 degrees to the vertical is located near Sargans, St. Gallens. Highly sloping masts are used on two 380 kV pylons in Switzerland, the top 32 meters of one of them being bent by 18 degrees to the vertical.

Power station chimneys are sometimes equipped with crossbars for fixing conductors of the outgoing lines. Because of possible problems with corrosion by flue gases, such constructions are very rare.

There exist also a variety of pylons and powerline poles mounted on buildings. The most common forms are small rooftop poles used in some countries like Germany for the realization of overhead 400/230 volt grids for the power supply of homes .

However, there are also roof-mounted support structures for high-voltage. Some thermal power plants in Poland like Połaniec Power Station and in the former Soviet Union like Lukoml Power Station use portal pylons on the roof of the power station building for the high voltage line from the machine transformer to the switchyard. Also other industrial buildings may have a rooftop powerline support structure. One can find such a device at a steel work in Dnipro, Ukraine at 48°28&#x27;57&quot;N 34°58&#x27;43&quot;E and at a steel work in Freital, Germany at 50°59&#x27;53&quot;N 13°38&#x27;26&quot;E.
In the United States such device may be more common as in other countries , 
There are also real rooftop high voltage towers on industry buildings as at a steel plant in Piombino, Italy and on a roof on an industrial building at Cherepovets, Russia at 59°8&#x27;52&quot;N 37°51&#x27;55&quot;E.&lt;br&gt;
Until 2015, on a residential highrise building in Dazhou, China at 31°11&#x27;28&quot;N 107°30&#x27;43&quot;E a powerline tower stood. 

Beside this, it is also possible that the lower parts of an electricity pylon stand in a building. Such a structure a person, who cannot have a view of the interior of the building, cannot distinguish from a real rooftop pylon. A structure of this type is Tower 9108 of a 110 kV high-voltage traction power line in Fulda , :File:Mast9108-Fundament.jpg.

An other unconventional way of installing powerlines are catenaries spun across a valley. Two such structures are used at the Kemano-Kitimat Powerline, another one can be found near Cape Town at 34.149954 S 18.926239 E.

A new type of pylon, called Wintrack pylons, will be used in the Netherlands starting in 2010. The pylons were designed as a minimalist structure by Dutch architects Zwarts and Jansma. The use of physical laws for the design made a reduction of the magnetic field possible. Also, the visual impact on the surrounding landscape is reduced.

Two clown-shaped pylons appear in Hungary, on both sides of the M5 motorway, near Újhartyán.

The Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, U.S., and American Electric Power paired to conceive, design, and install goal post-shaped towers located on both sides of Interstate 77 near the hall as part of a power infrastructure upgrade.

The Mickey pylon is a Mickey Mouse shaped transmission tower on the side of Interstate 4, near Walt Disney World in Orlando, FL. Bog Fox is a design pylon in Estonia south of Risti at 58° 59′ 33.44″ N, 24° 3′ 33.19″ E.

In Russia several pylons designed as artwork were built 

== Assembly ==

Before transmission towers are even erected, prototype towers are tested at tower testing stations. There are a variety of ways they can then be assembled and erected:

* They can be assembled horizontally on the ground and erected by push-pull cable. This method is rarely used because of the large assembly area needed.
* They can be assembled vertically (in their final upright position). Very tall towers, such as the Yangtze River Crossing, were assembled in this way.
* A jin-pole crane can be used to assemble lattice towers. This is also used for utility poles.
* Helicopters can serve as aerial cranes for their assembly in areas with limited accessibility. Towers can also be assembled elsewhere and flown to their place on the transmission right-of-way. Helicopters may also be used for transporting disassembled towers for scrapping.
== Markers ==
The International Civil Aviation Organization issues recommendations on markers for towers and the conductors suspended between them. Certain jurisdictions will make these recommendations mandatory, for example that certain power lines must have overhead wire markers placed at intervals, and that warning lights be placed on any sufficiently high towers, this is particularly true of transmission towers which are in close vicinity to airports.

Electricity pylons often have an identification tag marked with the name of the line (either the terminal points of the line or the internal designation of the power company) and the tower number. This makes identifying the location of a fault to the power company that owns the tower easier.

Transmission towers, much like other steel lattice towers including broadcasting or cellphone towers, are marked with signs which discourage public access due to the danger of the high voltage. Often this is accomplished with a sign warning of the high voltage. At other times, the entire access point to the transmission corridor is marked with a sign. Sign warning of the high voltage may also state the name of the company who built the structures, and acquired and designated lands where the transmission structures stand and line segments or right of way.

== Tower functions ==

Tower structures can be classified by the way in which they support the line conductors. Suspension structures support the conductor vertically using suspension insulators. Strain structures resist net tension in the conductors and the conductors attach to the structure through strain insulators. Dead-end structures support the full weight of the conductor and also all the tension in it, and also use strain insulators.

Structures are classified as tangent suspension, angle suspension, tangent strain, angle strain, tangent dead-end and angle dead-end. Where the conductors are in a straight line, a tangent tower is used. Angle towers are used where a line must change direction.

=== Cross arms and conductor arrangement ===
Generally three conductors are required per AC 3-phase circuit, although single-phase and DC circuits are also carried on towers. Conductors may be arranged in one plane, or by use of several cross-arms may be arranged in a roughly symmetrical, triangulated pattern to balance the impedances of all three phases. If more than one circuit is required to be carried and the width of the line right-of-way does not permit multiple towers to be used, two or three circuits can be carried on the same tower using several levels of cross-arms. Often multiple circuits are the same voltage, but mixed voltages can be found on some structures.

== Other features ==
=== Insulators ===

Insulators electrically isolate the live side of the transmission cables from the tower structure and earth. They are either glass or porcelain discs or composite insulators using silicone rubber or EPDM rubber material. They are assembled in strings or long rods whose lengths are dependent on the line voltage and environmental conditions. By using disks the shortest surface electrical path between the ends is maximised which reduces the chance of a leakage in moist conditions.
=== Stockbridge dampers ===
Stockbridge dampers are added to the transmission lines a meter or two from the tower. They consist of a short length of cable clamped in place parallel to the line itself and weighted at each end. The size and dimensions are carefully designed to damp any buildup of mechanical oscillation of the lines that could be induced by mechanical vibrations most likely caused by wind. Without them it&#x27;s possible for a standing wave to become established that grows in magnitude and destroys the line or the tower.

=== Arcing horns ===

Arcing horns are sometimes added to the ends of the insulators in areas where voltage surges may occur. These may be caused by either lightning strikes or in switching operations. They protect power line insulators from damage due to arcing. They can be seen as rounded metal pipework at either end of the insulator and provide a path to earth in extreme circumstances without damaging the insulator.

=== Physical security ===
Towers will have a level of physical security to prevent members of the public or climbing animals from ascending them. This may take the form of a security fence or climbing baffles added to the supporting legs. Some countries require that lattice steel towers be equipped with a barbed wire barrier approximately above ground in order to deter unauthorized climbing. Such barriers can often be found on towers close to roads or other areas with easy public access, even where there is not a legal requirement. In the United Kingdom, all such towers are fitted with barbed wire.

=== Other features ===
Some electricity pylons, especially for voltages above 100 kV, carry transmission antennas. In most cases these are cellphone antennas and antennas for radio relay links adjoined with them, but it is also possible that antennas of radio relay systems of power companies or antenna for small broadcasting transmitters in the VHF-/UHF-range are installed. The northern tower of Elbekreuzung 1 carries in a height of 30 metres a radar station for monitoring ship traffic on Elbe river on its structure. The Tower 93 of Facility 4101, a strainer at Hürth south of Cologne, Germany carried from 1977 to 2010 a public observation deck, which was accessible by a staircase.

== Notable electricity transmission towers ==
The following electricity transmission towers are notable due to their enormous height, unusual design, unusual construction site or their use in artworks. Bold type denotes structure which was at one time the tallest transmission tower(s) in the world.

<text>Julius Blüthner Pianofortefabrik [[GmbH]] is a piano-manufacturing company in Leipzig, Germany. Composers who used Blüthner include Brahms, Debussy, Wagner, Strauss, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, and the Beatles among others.

== History ==
After a long and difficult campaign to gain Leipzig citizenship, Julius Blüthner established his workshop in Leipzig, Saxony in 1853. In the beginning he employed three other craftsmen.

By 1900 Blüthner had become the largest piano maker in Germany, producing some 5,000 instruments annually. Innovations such as the aliquot string (an additional string on high treble notes that improves their tone by vibrating sympathetically), as well as a cylindrical soundboard and angle cut hammers, created a unique voice for the Blüthner instrument.

The owners in 1917 (Adolf Max Blüthner, Dr. Paul Robert and Willy Bruno Heinrich) were awarded an imperial and royal warrant of appointment to the court of Austria-Hungary.

In 1936, Blüthner was selected to build the piano for the airship Hindenburg.

In 1943, during World War II, an air raid destroyed the Blüthner factory.

After the war, Dr. Rudolf Blüthner-Haessler rebuilt the company; production of pianos resumed in 1948.

In 1972, the company was nationalized by the East German government, with Ingbert Blüthner-Haessler remaining as managing director.

With the Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and German reunification in 1990, the Blüthner family regained control of the company. Ingbert Blüthner-Haessler reorganized the company, increasing the production capacity and modernizing the manufacturing process.

Between 1994 and 1997 a new factory was built in Störmthal near Leipzig.

Beginning in 1995, Ingbert Blüthner-Haessler shared the management of the company with his two sons, Christian Blüthner-Haessler and Knut Blüthner-Haessler.

In 2009, the Karl Rönisch piano company merged with Blüthner, and Karl Rönisch production was moved to Blüthner&#x27;s factory in Leipzig.

The age of any particular Blüthner piano can be determined by matching its serial number to the age table freely available on the Blüthner website.

The one-of-a-kind Blüthner piano of particular interest was a special lightweight instrument, made for use on the Zeppelin &quot;LZ 129 Hindenburg&quot;. The piano had its harp plate made of aluminum, that saved about 100 kg of weight versus a regular cast iron plate of the same size piano. This was the first piano used in flight, and it was used in an &quot;air-concert&quot; radio broadcast. It was removed in 1937 to save weight so it survived the &quot;Hindenburg&quot;&#x27;s infamous crash, only to be destroyed by bombing during WWII. A replica of this piano was featured in the 1975 film &quot;The Hindenburg&quot; where Reed Channing (Peter Donat) sings. Since the film is set during the airship&#x27;s final flight, during which the piano was not on the ship, the piano&#x27;s presence is a historical error.

Blüthner makes a few specialized pianos including some with the design reversed so that a left-handed person can play the tenor with his left hand and the bass with his right hand. In 2008 they designed and built a special keyboard for a customer in Spain which had the Jankó keyboard design.

== Brands ==
In addition to the &quot;Blüthner&quot; brand, Blüthner manufactures two other brands: &quot;Haessler&quot; for the mid-level market and &quot;Irmler&quot; for the entry-level market.

=== Haessler ===
Made for the mid-level piano market, Haessler pianos are designed and built in the same factory as Bluthner pianos.

=== Irmler ===
Made for the entry-level piano market, Irmler pianos are designed by Blüthner and manufactured in different countries. The Studio Edition pianos are manufactured in China and shipped to Germany were they receive Abel hammers. Professional Edition pianos use structural and acoustical elements from the Samick factory in Indonesia and cabinets from Poland and then are assembled in Germany.

== Notable Blüthner artists ==

Numerous royals, composers, conductors, artists, authors and performers have owned Blüthner pianos. They include Willhelm II, Emperor Franz Joseph I, Johannes Brahms, Gustav Mahler, Liberace, Béla Bartók, Claude Debussy, George Formby, Dodie Smith, Max Reger, Richard Wagner, Johann Strauss, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Dmitri Shostakovich, Petronel Malan. 
Sergei Rachmaninoff commented that &quot;There are only two things which I took with me on my way to America...my wife and my precious Blüthner&quot;.

Blüthners have been used in popular music, as well. One Blüthner piano owned by the Abbey Road Studios in London was used on some tracks of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Let It Be&quot; (1970) album, most notably, in the hits &quot;Let It Be&quot; and &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;. Blüthners were also used in the films &quot;Gaslight&quot; (1944) and &quot;The Sting&quot; (1973), and one was played by Hannibal Lecter in the movie &quot;Hannibal&quot;. Another, a stunt piano, was destroyed in &quot;Iron Man&quot; (2008). A Blüthner piano also appears in the 2004 Cole Porter biopic &quot;De-Lovely&quot; in the Venice apartment scenes.

<doc id="827701" wikidata="Q1739288" url="?curid=827701" title="Kerma (physics)">
<text>In radiation physics, kerma is an acronym for &quot;kinetic energy released per unit mass&quot; (alternately, &quot;kinetic energy released in matter&quot;, &quot;kinetic energy released in material&quot;, or &quot;kinetic energy released in materials&quot;), defined as the sum of the initial kinetic energies of all the charged particles liberated by uncharged ionizing radiation (i.e., indirectly ionizing radiation such as photons and neutrons) in a sample of matter, divided by the mass of the sample. It is defined by the quotient
formula_1.

==Units==
The SI unit of kerma is the gray (Gy) (or joule per kilogram), the same as the unit of absorbed dose. However, kerma can be different from absorbed dose, depending on the energies involved. This is because ionization energy is not accounted for. While kerma approximately equals absorbed dose at low energies, kerma is much higher than absorbed dose at higher energies, because some energy escapes from the absorbing volume in the form of bremsstrahlung (X-rays) or fast-moving electrons, and is not counted as absorbed dose.

==Process of energy transfer==
Photon energy is transferred to matter in a two-step process. First, energy is transferred to charged particles in the medium through various photon interactions (e.g. photoelectric effect, Compton scattering, pair production, and photodisintegration). Next, these secondary charged particles transfer their energy to the medium through atomic excitation and ionizations.

For low-energy photons, kerma is numerically approximately the same as absorbed dose. For higher-energy photons, kerma is larger than absorbed dose because some highly energetic secondary electrons and X-rays escape the region of interest before depositing their energy. The escaping energy is counted in kerma, but not in absorbed dose. For low-energy X-rays, this is usually a negligible distinction. This can be understood when one looks at the components of kerma.

There are two independent contributions to the total kerma, collision kerma formula_2 and radiative kerma formula_3 – thus, formula_4. Collision kerma results in the production of electrons that dissipate their energy as ionization and excitation due to the interaction between the charged particle and the atomic electrons. Radiative kerma results in the production of radiative photons due to the interaction between the charged particle and atomic nuclei (mostly via Bremsstrahlung radiation), but can also include photons produced by annihilation of positrons in flight.

Frequently, the quantity formula_2 is of interest, and is usually expressed as
:formula_6
where &quot;g&quot; is the average fraction of energy transferred to electrons that is lost through bremsstrahlung.

==Calibration of radiation protection instruments==
Air kerma is of importance in the practical calibration of instruments for photon measurement, where it is used for the traceable calibration of gamma instrument metrology facilities using a &quot;free air&quot; ion chamber to measure air kerma.

IAEA safety report 16 states &quot;The quantity &quot;air kerma&quot; should be used for calibrating the reference photon radiation fields and reference instruments. Radiation protection monitoring instruments should be calibrated in terms of dose equivalent quantities. Area dosimeters or dose ratemeters should be calibrated in terms of the ambient dose equivalent, H*(10), or the directional dose equivalent, H′(0.07),without any phantom present, i.e. free in air.&quot;

Conversion coefficients from air kerma in Gy to equivalent dose in Sv are published in the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) report 74 (1996). For instance, air kerma rate is converted to tissue equivalent dose using a factor of Sv/Gy (air) = 1.21 for Cs 137 at 0.662 MeV.

<doc id="827703" wikidata="Q1856887" url="?curid=827703" title="Santa Fe Trail">
<text>The Santa Fe Trail was a 19th-century route through central North America that connected Franklin, Missouri, with Santa Fe, New Mexico. Pioneered in 1821 by William Becknell, who departed from the Boonslick region along the Missouri River, the trail served as a vital commercial highway until 1880, when the railroad arrived in Santa Fe. Santa Fe was near the end of El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro which carried trade from Mexico City. The trail was later incorporated into parts of the National Old Trails Road and U.S. Route 66.

The route skirted the northern edge and crossed the north-western corner of Comancheria, the territory of the Comanche. Realizing the value, they demanded compensation for granting passage to the trail. American traders envisioned them as another market. Comanche raiding farther south in Mexico isolated New Mexico, making it more dependent on the American trade. They raided to gain a steady supply of horses to sell. By the 1840s, trail traffic through the Arkansas Valley was so numerous that bison herds were cut off from important seasonal grazing land. This habitat disruption, on top of overhunting, contributed to the collapse of the species. Comanche power declined in the region when they lost their most important game.

In 1846, during the Mexican–American War, the United States Army used the Santa Fe Trail to invade New Mexico.

After the U.S. acquisition of the Southwest that ended the war, the trail was integral to the U.S. opening the region to economic development and settlement. It played a vital role in the westward expansion of the U.S. into these new lands. The road route is commemorated today by the National Park Service as the Santa Fe National Historic Trail. A highway route that roughly follows the trail&#x27;s path, through the entire length of Kansas, the southeast corner of Colorado and northern New Mexico, has been designated as the Santa Fe Trail National Scenic Byway.

==History==


The Santa Fe Trail was one of many transportation routes opened by the Indigenous people of North America as well as European trappers and traders in the second half of the 18th century. It was later used extensively by people from the United States in the 19th century after the Louisiana Purchase. Traders and settlers crossed the southwest of North America by the route connecting Independence, Missouri, with Santa Fe, New Mexico. Its major market in Missouri was St. Louis, with its port on the Mississippi River.

In 1719, the French officer Claude Charles Du Tisne was tasked by French authorities to establish a route to trade with the Spanish colony of Santa Fe in New Mexico. This first expedition, which started in Kaskaskia, Illinois, failed, as it was stopped by Indian tribes in Kansas. Then, at the time of the Louisiana regime, under French and then Spanish sovereignty, the French traders Pierre Antoine and Paul Mallet made a first trip in 1739 and 1740, starting also from Kaskaskia, Illinois, reaching Santa Fe and returning. They made other expeditions in 1741 and 1750, which faced various challenges from Indians and Spaniards. Then, the French explorer Pierre Vial made another pioneering trip on the route in 1792, and French traders and trappers from St. Louis gained progressively a fur trading dominance from the Spanish in Santa Fe as well as with the Indian tribes living in this vast region. Other French traders and trappers made trips on the trail from St. Louis, such as Auguste Pierre Chouteau and Jules de Mun in 1815, who were arrested by Spanish authorities in Santa Fe.

After Louisiana was sold to the United States in 1803 (Louisiana Purchase), Americans improved and publicized the Santa Fe Trail beginning in 1822, in order to take advantage of new trade opportunities with Mexico which had just won independence from Spain in the Mexican War of Independence. Manufactured goods were hauled from Missouri to Santa Fe, which was then in the northern Mexican state of &quot;Nuevo Mexico&quot;.

Settlers seeking the opportunity to hold free land used wagon trains to follow various emigrant trails that branched off to points west. The political philosophy of manifest destiny, the idea that the U.S. should extend from one coast to another, dominated national political discussions. The trail connected interior port cities along the Mississippi and Missouri and their wagon train outfitters to western destinations. The trail was used to carry products from the central plains to the trail head towns St. Joseph and Independence, Missouri.

In the 1820s–1830s, it was also sporadically important in the reverse trade, used by traders to transport foods and supplies to the fur trappers and mountain men opening the remote Northwest, especially in the interior Northwest: Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, and Montana. A mule trail (trapper&#x27;s trails) led to points north to supply the lucrative overland fur trade in ports on the Pacific Coast.

===North–South trade===
Santa Fe was near the northern terminus of El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro, which led overland between Mexico City to San Juan Pueblo, New Mexico.

Cargo mule trains were run from Fort Bernard in Wyoming to the Santa Fe Trail at Fort Bent in Colorado .

===Importance of Santa Fe===
In 1825, the merchant Manuel Escudero of Chihuahua was commissioned by New Mexico governor Bartolome Baca to negotiate in Washington, D.C., for opening U.S. borders to traders from Mexico. Beginning in 1826, prominent aristocratic families of New Mexicans, such as the Chávezes, Armijos, Pereas, and Oteros, entered into the commerce along the trail. By 1843, traders from New Mexico and Chihuahua had become the majority of traders involved in the traffic of goods over the Santa Fe Trail.

In 1835, Mexico City had sent Albino Pérez to govern the department of New Mexico as &quot;Jefe Politico&quot; (political chief or governor) and as commanding military officer. In 1837, the forces of &quot;Rio Arriba&quot; (the upper Rio Grande, i.e., northern New Mexico) rebelled against Pérez&#x27;s enforcement of the recent Mexican constitution, new revenue laws taxing Santa Fe commerce and entertainment, and the large grants of New Mexico land to wealthy Mexicans. New Mexicans appreciated the relative freedoms of a frontier, remote from Mexico City. The rebels defeated and executed governor Albino Perez, but were later ousted by the forces of &quot;Rio Abajo&quot; (the lower Rio Grande, or southern New Mexico) led by Manuel Armijo.

===Conflict between Texas and Mexico===

The Republic of Texas competed with Mexico in claiming Santa Fe, as part of the territory north and east of the Rio Grande which both nations claimed following Texas&#x27;s secession from Mexico in 1836.

In 1841, a small military and trading expedition departed from Austin, Texas, for Santa Fe. They represented the Republic of Texas and its president Mirabeau B. Lamar. Their intention was to persuade the people of Santa Fe and New Mexico to relinquish control over the territory under dispute with Mexico, and over associated Santa Fe Trail commerce. Knowing about recent political disturbances there, they hoped for a welcome by the rebellious faction in New Mexico. What was known as the Texan Santa Fe Expedition encountered many difficulties. The party was captured by governor Armijo&#x27;s Mexican army under less than honest negotiations. They were subjected to harsh and austere treatment during a tortuous forced march to Mexico City, where they were tried, convicted and imprisoned for their insurgent activities.

In 1842, Colonel William A. Christy wrote Sam Houston, president of Texas, requesting support for an overthrow scheme by Charles Warfield dependent on armed forces. He proposed deposing the governments in the Mexican provinces of New Mexico and Chihuahua and returning half of the spoils to the Republic of Texas. Houston agreed, provided the operation be conducted under the strictest secrecy.

He commissioned Warfield as a colonel, who attempted to raise volunteers in Texas, St. Louis, Missouri; and the southern Rockies for a Warfield Expedition. He recruited John McDaniel and a small band of men in the proximate vicinity of St. Louis, giving McDaniel the rank of a Texas captain. After Warfield headed toward the Rockies with a companion, McDaniel led a robbery in April 1843 (in present-day Rice County, Kansas) of a lightly defended Santa Fe Trail trading caravan. This resulted in the murder of its leader Antonio José Chávez, the son of a former governor of New Mexico, Francisco Xavier Chávez.

Warfield was reportedly unaware of the crime. McDaniel and one accomplice were tried, convicted and executed. Other participating suspects arrested by the U.S. were convicted and imprisoned. The newspapers reported that Americans and Mexicans were outraged by the crime. Local merchants and citizens at the U.S. end of the Santa Fe Trail demanded justice and a return to the stable commerce which their economy depended on.

After the murder of Chávez, Warfield began limited military hostilities in the region using recruits from the southern Rockies. He made an unprovoked attack on Mexican troops outside Mora, New Mexico, leaving five dead. Warfield lost his horses after an encounter in Wagon Mound, where the Mexican forces had made chase. After Warfield&#x27;s men reached Bent&#x27;s Fort on foot, they disbanded.

In February 1843, Colonel Jacob Snively had received a commission to intercept Mexican caravans along the Santa Fe Trail, similar to that received by Warfield the year prior. After disbanding the volunteers under his command, Warfield located and joined the 190-man, Texas &quot;Battalion of Invincibles&quot;, under the command of Snively. New Mexico Governor Manuel Armijo led Mexican troops out of Santa Fe to protect incoming caravans. But, after the Invincibles destroyed much of an advance party led by Captain Ventura Lovato, the governor retreated. Following this battle, many Americans resigned and Snively&#x27;s force was reduced to little over 100 men. Snively planned to plunder Mexican merchant caravans on territory claimed by Texas, in retaliation for recent Texian executions and Mexican invasions, but his battalion was quickly arrested and disarmed by the US troops escorting the caravans. After disarming these men, Captain Philip St. George Cooke allowed them to return to Texas.

==Mother of the railroad==

In 1863, while railroad legislation underwent continual revisions, entrepreneurs grew more interested in the American Southwest, leading to the construction of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. As the name suggests, the intended eastern terminus was to be Atchison, Kansas.

In Kansas, the AT&amp;SF roadbed roughly paralleled the Santa Fe Trail west of Topeka as it expanded between 1868 and 1874. When a railroad bridge was built across the Missouri River to connect eastern markets to the Dodge City cattle trail and Colorado coal mines, the railroad spurred the growth of Kansas City, Missouri. Building the railway westwards beyond the New Mexico border was delayed and placed the railroad under financial pressure. In response, they offered packaged &quot;Shopping Excursion deals&quot; to potential real estate buyers. The railroad began to discount such trips to visit its land offices and gave back the ticket price as part of the purchase price if a sale was concluded.

The railroad&#x27;s sale of its land granted by congress fostered growth of new towns and businesses along its route, which generated railway traffic and revenues. With this financial base, the railway extended west, gradually adding new connections through rougher west country along the western Trail. With the development of rail transport, traffic on the Trail soon dropped to merely local trade. After World War I the trail gradually became a paved automobile road.

==Route==

The eastern end of the trail was in the central Missouri town of Franklin on the north bank of the Missouri River. The route across Missouri first used by Becknell followed portions of the existing Osage Trace and the Medicine Trails. West of Franklin, the trail crossed the Missouri near Arrow Rock, after which it followed roughly the route of present-day U.S. Route 24. It passed north of Marshall, through Lexington to Fort Osage, then to Independence. Independence was also one of the historic &quot;jumping off points&quot; for the Oregon and California Trails.

West of Independence, it roughly followed the route of U.S. Route 56 from near the town of Olathe to the western border of Kansas. It enters Colorado, cutting across the southeast corner of the state before entering New Mexico. The section of the trail between Independence and Olathe was also used by immigrants on the California and Oregon Trails, which branched off to the northwest near Gardner, Kansas.

From Olathe, the trail passed through the towns of Baldwin City, Burlingame, and Council Grove, then swung west of McPherson to the town of Lyons. West of Lyons the trail followed nearly the route of present-day Highway 56 to Great Bend. Ruts in the earth made from the trail are still visible in several locations (Ralph&#x27;s Ruts are visible in aerial photos at (). At Great Bend, the trail encountered the Arkansas River. Branches of the trail followed both sides of the river upstream to Dodge City and Garden City.

West of Garden City in southwestern Kansas the trail splits into two branches. One of the branches, called the Mountain Route or the Upper Crossing continues up the Arkansas River to the confluence with the Purgatoire River near La Junta continuing along the Purgatoire River to Trinidad, then south through the Raton Pass into New Mexico.

The other main branch, called the Cimarron Cutoff or Cimarron Crossing or Middle Crossing cut southwest across the Cimarron Desert (also known as the Waterscrape or &quot;La Jornada&quot;) to the valley of the Cimarron River near the town of Ulysses and Elkhart then continued toward Boise City, Oklahoma, to Clayton, New Mexico, joining up with northern branch at Fort Union. This route was generally very hazardous because it had very little water. In fact, the Cimarron River was one of the only sources of water along this branch of the trail.

From Watrous, the reunited branches continued southward to Santa Fe. Part of this route has been designated a National Scenic Byway.

==Challenges==

Travelers faced many hardships along the Santa Fe Trail. The trail was a challenging of dangerous plains, hot deserts, and steep and rocky mountains. The natural weather was and is continental: very hot and dry summers, coupled with long and bitterly cold winters. Fresh water was scarce, and the high steppe-like plains are nearly treeless. Water flows in the Pecos, Arkansas, Cimarron, and Canadian rivers that drain the region vary by 90 or more percent in their flows during an average year. Also on this trail, unlike the Oregon Trail, there was a serious danger of Indian attacks, for neither the Comanche nor the Apache of the southern high plains tolerated trespassers. In 1825, Congress voted for federal protection for the Santa Fe Trail, even though much of it lay in the Mexican territory. Lack of food and water also made the trail very risky. Weather conditions, like huge lightning storms, gave the travelers even more difficulty. If a storm developed, there was often no place to take shelter and the livestock could get spooked. Rattlesnakes often posed a threat, and many people died due to snakebites. The caravan size increased later on to prevent Indian raids. The travelers also harnessed more oxen instead of mules—primarily for the greater hauling power of oxen but also because they were less valued by Indians and thus less risk of being raided.

==Historic preservation==
Segments of this trail in Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In Missouri, this includes the 85th and Manchester &quot;Three Trails&quot; Trail Segment, Arrow Rock Ferry Landing, Santa Fe Trail – Grand Pass Trail Segments, and Santa Fe Trail – Saline County Trail Segments. The longest clearly identifiable section of the trail, Santa Fe Trail Remains, near Dodge City, Kansas, is listed as a National Historic Landmark. In Colorado, Santa Fe Trail Mountain Route – Bent&#x27;s New Fort is included on the National Register.

<text>Racionais MC&#x27;s is a Brazilian hip hop group based in São Paulo. The original lineup formed in 1988 consisted of Mano Brown, Ice Blue, Edi Rock, and DJ KL Jay. Each member hails from the ring of &quot;favelas&quot; around São Paulo. Their lyrics combine themes of social justice with gangster imagery, a far cry from the idyllic breeziness typically associated with Brazilian rap music, Racionais MC&#x27;s is often considered the most important Brazilian rap group.

==History==

===The Zimbabwe Years (1988–1995)===
Racionais MC&#x27;s first appeared on the Zimbabwe Records label compilation &quot;Consciência Black&quot; (Black Conscience) in 1988. Their songs &quot;Pânico na Zona Sul&quot; (&quot;Panic on the Southside&quot;) and &quot;Tempos Difíceis&quot; (&quot;Hard Times&quot;) offer a snapshot of &quot;favela&quot; life with lyrics vividly depicting rampant police brutality, racism, poverty, and crime. The group released their first album, &quot;Holocausto Urbano&quot; (Urban Holocaust) in 1990. The EP included the two songs from &quot;Consciência Black&quot; along with three new tracks dealing with themes of loose women and institutionalized racism. The group played several shows around the city and state of São Paulo over the next two years, including two shows at the FEBEM (&quot;Fundação Estadual do Bem-Estar do Menor&quot;) juvenile detention center and a special show with Public Enemy at the Ginásio do Ibirapuera.

Racionais MC&#x27;s gained national attention with their participation in the Ministry of Education&#x27;s &quot;RAPensando a Educação&quot; (a word play, roughly translated as &quot;Rap-Thinking Education&quot;) program in 1992. The program included lectures and discussions in schools on a variety of issues affecting &quot;favela&quot; inhabitants, including drugs, police violence, poverty, and racism. These forums had the dual effect of expanding awareness of Racionas MC&#x27;s agenda along with their fan base, as residents the &quot;favelas&quot; in cities across Brazil could relate to the &quot;Paulista&quot; rap group&#x27;s experience. That year the group released their second album, &quot;Escolha o Seu Caminho&quot; (Choose Your Path), with the notable tracks &quot;Voz Ativa&quot; (&quot;Active Voice&quot;) and &quot;Negro Limitado&quot; (&quot;Limited Black Man&quot;). Following its release the group headlined the Rap no Vale show at Vale do Anhangabaú in São Paulo.

In 1993 the group saw their notoriety continue to increase. They participated in the National Theatre&#x27;s &quot;Música Negra em Ação&quot; (Black Music in Action) project alongside Thaíde e DJ Hum, another prominent São Paulo Hip Hop act. Their philanthropic activities continued as they played several benefit shows for health clinics, youth sports programs, and samba schools. The year also saw the release of their first full-length LP &quot;Raio X Brasil&quot; (X-Ray Brazil). The album includes several standout tracks including &quot;Fim de Semana no Parque&quot; (&quot;Weekend in the Park&quot;), a lyrical sketch of lowlifes in São Paulo; &quot;Mano na Porta do Bar&quot; (&quot;Man at the Bar Door&quot;), a skillful remix of Curtis Mayfield&#x27;s &quot;Freddie&#x27;s Dead&quot;; and the unexpected harmonica and piano jam &quot;Fio da Navalha&quot; (&quot;Razor Edge&quot;). Mano Brown won the Prêmio Sharp award for &quot;O Homem na Estrada&quot; (&quot;The Man on the Road&quot;), one of the album&#x27;s other notable tracks. A 1994 show at the Vale do Anhangabaú in support of the album ended in a riot when police raided the show and arrested the group. The group was charged with inciting violence.

===Cosa Nostra (1995–present)===
The presentations continued and increasing impact of Racionais MC&#x27;s beginning to extrapolate the boundaries of São Paulo. In 1997, a sort of &#x27;DIY&#x27; (do it yourself) rap group inaugurates its own label Cosa Nostra Phonographic with the release of the album &quot;Sobrevivendo no Inferno&quot; (&quot;Surviving in Hell&quot;), selling over 1.5 million copies independently including the tracks&#x27; &quot;Diário de um Detento&quot; (Diary of a Prisoner), &quot;Fórmula Mágica da Paz&quot; (&#x27;Magic Formula for Peace&#x27;), &quot;Capítulo 4, Versículo 3&quot; (&#x27;Chapter 4, Verse 3&#x27;) and &quot;Mágico de Oz&quot; (&#x27;Wizard of Oz&#x27;). Stamp still throw discs Sabotage, RZO and Revelation 16, and Rosana Bronks define a well peculiar group work with his musical career. Brown, KL Jay, Blue and Edi Rock has, to date, control of its entire production, from composing and recording his own albums in a studio, to distribution. Among 12 songs of &quot;Sobrevivendo no Inferno&quot; took one previously unknown proportions. Composed in partnership with ex-con Jocenir, the track &quot;Diário de um Detento&quot; (&#x27;Diary of a Detainee&#x27;) bursted on the radio in the country, portraying the tension that preceded the rebellion of 1992 in Carandiru Penitentiary in São Paulo, where 111 prisoners were killed by Military Police of São Paulo State&#x27;s Special Troops.

With the launching of a scathing clip for the new hit, the Racionais MC&#x27;s went to VMB and won the prize &#x27;Audience Choice&#x27; - equivalent to the current &#x27;Artist of the Year&#x27;. On the occasion, the group made a memorable presentation and just cheered by the audience. Their popularity reached even further with the release of the Album &quot;Nada como um dia após o outro&quot; that were widely acclaimed by the critics that made many hits as &quot;Vida Loka I&quot;, &quot;Vida Loka II&quot;, &quot;Negro Drama&quot;, &quot;Jesus Chorou&quot; e &quot;Estilo Cachorro&quot;.

Some of its tracks, such as &#x27;Vida Loka&#x27; I and II, &#x27;Negro Drama&#x27; and &#x27;Jesus Chorou&#x27; are still some of the most performed at concerts. But despite the success, the album would mark the beginning of an 11-year hiatus without any album releases. Released in 2006 the first DVD of the group, &#x27;1000 Trutas, 1000 Tretas&#x27;, a record of 15 songs recorded during concerts held since 2002. The only new song from the compilation is the track &#x27;Abenção Mamãe, Abenção Papai&#x27;, which includes a cameo by Jorge Ben Jor. In the year following the release of the DVD, reliving the episode of 1994, the Police intervened in the Racionais MC&#x27;s presentation during the &quot;Virada Cultural&quot;. The confusion would have started after the police repress some people from the audience who tried to climb a newsstand to watch the show.

Some songs came to publicised on the web, but no official release has been made, In 2012 the group released the video clip of the song &quot;Mil faces de um homem leal&quot; (Thousand faces a loyal man) which portrays the life of Bahia, communist militant, enemy number 1 of the Military Dictatorship in Brazil, Carlos Marighella, the video that was recorded in the &#x27;Occupation Maua&#x27; - housing considered the &#x27;New Pinheirinho&#x27; for housing more than 200 families in the city center of São Paulo - refers to armed struggle against the military dictatorship in Brazil, interspersing historical images of protests, with scenes of Mano Brown, Ice Blue, KL Jay, Edi Rock and Dexter invited back to 1969 with the occupation of Radio National, with Carlos Marighella sending a message and calling on the people to resist and fight oppression. On a memorable night, the video won the award for best video of the year at VMB 2012. The group&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Cores e Valores, &quot; was released in 2014.

<doc id="827709" wikidata="Q7349256" url="?curid=827709" title="Roberto Ribeiro (judge)">
<text>Roberto Alexandre Vieira Ribeiro (, born 20 March 1949) is a Hong Kong judge and honorary lecturer in law at the University of Hong Kong. He is currently one of the three permanent judges for the Court of Final Appeal in Hong Kong, and is the longest serving judge in that court.

==Early life and education==
Born Roberto Alexandre Vieira Ribeiro, into a Portuguese-descent family in Hong Kong, he received his elementary and secondary education in Hong Kong. He studied in La Salle College.

Upon graduating with honours from the London School of Economics (LL.B. 1971, LL.M. 1972), Ribeiro returned to Hong Kong, and joined the faculty of law of the University of Hong Kong as a lecturer in 1972.
He initially taught in the fields of criminal law and jurisprudence, but later extended his teaching to labour law and civil procedure.

==Legal career==
After seven years of academic life, Ribeiro entered into private practice in 1979, and quickly established himself as an expert in admiralty and maritime law. He was a member of Temple Chambers during his time in private practice. He was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1990, and is a patron of the &quot;Oxford University Commonwealth Law Journal&quot;. He acted for the British government in the Spycatcher case, and for the Airport Authority during the enquiry into the botched opening of Chek Lap Kok airport in 1998.

===Judicial career===
In 1997, Ribeiro was appointed as a Recorder (part-time judge) of the High Court.

Ribeiro quickly rose through the ranks, and was appointed Judge of the High Court in 1999, promoted to the Court of Appeal (High Court) as a Justice of Appeal in 2000, and a Permanent Judge of the Court of Final Appeal the same year.

As the longest-serving judge of the court, Ribeiro has been involved in numerous important cases, particularly in the area of constitutional law. These include cases concerning the Right of Abode, sovereign immunity, freedom of speech, and the election process, but also extend to other areas such as maintenance and champerty, the internet, LGBT rights, civil partnerships, employment, medical negligence, and divorce.

In May 2023, the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) of the United States Congress suggested the United States government imposing sanctions on Ribeiro to counter the erosion of democratic freedoms in Hong Kong over his handling of Jimmy Lai&#x27;s national security law case.

==Personal==
Ribeiro was for many years President of Alliance Française in Hong Kong, and has been a member of the boards of the Hong Kong Arts Festival and the Hong Kong International Film Festival. He has been made an officer of the Légion d&#x27;Honneur in France. He is an Honorary Bencher of the Inner Temple in London, and an Honorary Fellow of both the London School of Economics and St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford. He received an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Hong Kong in 2019.

<doc id="827711" wikidata="Q1320754" url="?curid=827711" title="Johnny Pesky">
<text>John Michael Pesky (born John Michael Paveskovich; February 27, 1919 – August 13, 2012), nicknamed &quot;the Needle&quot; and &quot;Mr. Red Sox&quot;, was an American professional baseball player, manager and coach. He was a shortstop and third baseman during a ten-year major league playing career, appearing in 1,270 games played in 1942 and from 1946 to 1954 for three teams. He missed the 1943–45 seasons while serving in World War II. Pesky was associated with the Boston Red Sox for 61 of his 73 years in baseball—from 1940 through June 3, 1952, 1961 through 1964, and from 1969 until his death. Pesky also managed the Red Sox from 1963 to 1964, and in September 1980.

A left-handed hitter who threw right-handed, Pesky was a tough man for pitchers to strike out. He was the first American League (AL) player to score 6 runs in a 9 inning game. As a hitter, he specialized in getting on base, leading the AL in base hits three times—his first three seasons in the majors, in which he collected over 200 hits each year—and was among the top ten in on-base percentage six times while batting .307 in 4,745 at bats as a major leaguer. He was also an excellent bunter who led the league in sacrifice hits in 1942. He was a teammate and close friend of Ted Williams, Bobby Doerr and Dom DiMaggio and the four were later honored with &quot;The Teammates&quot; statue outside Fenway Park.

==Early life==
Pesky was born February 27, 1919, in Portland, Oregon, the son of Croat immigrants Jakov and Marija (Bajama) Paveskovich. (Major League Baseball has his date of birth as September 27, 1919, an adjustment made by Pesky in 1939 to meet baseball minimum scouting age for tryouts.)

==Playing career==

===Amateur and minor leagues===
Pesky played for Lincoln High School, and attended a baseball school run by former major league pitcher Carl Mays. He spent several years playing for local amateur teams, such as the Portland Babes, Bend Elks and Silverton Red Sox. The third of these teams was associated with the Silver Falls Timber Company, which was owned by Tom Yawkey, who also owned the major league Red Sox. A skilled ice hockey player, he once worked out with the Boston Bruins. 

His name was shortened to &quot;Pesky&quot; early in his playing career. According to one story, Portland sportswriters would abbreviate his name to &quot;Pesky&quot; because it fit better in a box score. Another version has it that an Oregonian sports editor asked about a certain pesky hitter he&#x27;d watched play, seemingly unaware of the similarity to the player&#x27;s actual surname. Whatever the case, the young ballplayer changed his name legally from Paveskovich to Pesky in 1947.

Pesky was signed as an amateur free agent by the Red Sox before the 1940 season and spent the next two seasons in the minor leagues. In 1940, he played for the Rocky Mount Red Sox of the Piedmont League, where he was a teammate of future Hall of Famer Heinie Manush, who was the team&#x27;s player-manager. After hitting .325 with Rocky Mount, he moved up to the double-A Louisville Colonels, where he also batted .325. The next year, he was in the major leagues.

===Major leagues===
During his rookie year in 1942, Pesky led the AL in hits with 205—at the time a Red Sox record for a rookie—as well as sacrifice hits with 22. He was second only to teammate Ted Williams in average at .331, and finished third in Most Valuable Player voting behind MVP Joe Gordon and Williams.

After missing three seasons due to World War II, Pesky came back in 1946, leading the league in hits once again, batting .335, third in the league, and finishing fourth in the MVP voting while also making his first and only All-Star team. His 53 hits in August set a team record for hits in a month, a record later tied by Dom DiMaggio. In 1947, Pesky batted .324 while leading the league in hits for the third consecutive year with 207. It was also Pesky&#x27;s third consecutive year having 200 or more hits each season from the start of his career which matched that of the Pittsburgh Pirates&#x27; Lloyd Waner occurring during the 1927–29 seasons.

In the 1947–48 offseason, the Red Sox acquired shortstop Vern Stephens, a three-time All-Star, and asked Pesky to move to third base. The switch took a toll on Pesky, who had his worst season to date as a hitter, as his average dropped to .281. He bounced back to hit over .300 each year from 1949 to 1951, and in 1951 he and Stephens swapped positions, with Pesky returning to shortstop and Stephens moving to third base.
Pesky began the 1952 season slowly, and by mid-June he had played in just 25 games, batting .149. He was traded to the Detroit Tigers in a nine-player deal, in which the Red Sox also traded Walt Dropo, Fred Hatfield, Don Lenhardt, and Bill Wight and acquired Hoot Evers, George Kell, Johnny Lipon, and Dizzy Trout. Tigers&#x27; manager Fred Hutchinson had Pesky mentor Al Kaline. On the field, Pesky split time at shortstop with Neil Berry, batting .254 in 69 games with the Tigers. In 1953, the Tigers moved Pesky to second base, and his batting average rebounded somewhat to .292. However, in 1954, the Tigers installed rookie Frank Bolling at second base, and Pesky was demoted to the bench. He was traded in mid-season to the Washington Senators for Mel Hoderlein. After finishing the season batting just .246 overall, he was released.

===Back to the minor leagues===
Pesky was signed by the Baltimore Orioles on December 16, 1954, but was released four months later on April 10, 1955. He signed with the New York Yankees, where he was assigned to their top farm club, the Denver Bears as a player-coach. He played 17 games in the Carolina League with the Durham Bulls franchise in 1956.

===&quot;Pesky&#x27;s Pole&quot;===
In honor of Pesky, the right field foul pole at Fenway Park, home of the Red Sox, is known as Pesky&#x27;s Pole, or the Pesky Pole. Former teammate and Sox broadcaster Mel Parnell named the pole after Pesky. The story goes that Pesky won a game for Parnell in 1948 with a home run down the short () right field line, just around the pole. Being that Pesky was a contact hitter who hit only 17 home runs—six of them at Fenway Park—in 4,745 at bats in the major leagues, it&#x27;s quite possible that the home runs he hit there landed in close proximity to the pole. Research, however, shows that Pesky hit just one home run in a game pitched by Parnell, a two-run shot in the first inning of a game against Detroit played on June 11, 1950. The game was eventually won by the visiting Tigers in the 14th inning on a three-run shot by Tigers right fielder Vic Wertz and Parnell earned a no-decision that day.

==Minor and Major League manager==
Pesky began his coaching career in the New York Yankees organization with the 1955 Denver Bears of the Triple-A American Association working under manager Ralph Houk. From 1956 through 1960, Pesky was a manager in the Detroit farm system, reaching the Double-A level with the Birmingham Barons and the Victoria Rosebuds. He also managed a team in the Nicaraguan Professional Baseball League during the 1959–60 season.

He then rejoined the Red Sox in 1961 as manager of their Triple-A farm club, the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League.
===Two-year term as Red Sox manager===
Pesky enjoyed two winning seasons in Seattle. At the close of the 1962 campaign, Boston owner Tom Yawkey elevated manager Pinky Higgins to the club&#x27;s vacant post of general manager and personally appointed Pesky as Higgins&#x27;s replacement. Although the selection of Pesky was a popular choice, the Red Sox were a second division team and notorious as a &quot;country club&quot;—a group of unmotivated players who did what they wanted, when they wanted. In addition, Higgins and Pesky were not particularly close, and the general manager would be accused of undermining Yawkey&#x27;s hand-picked skipper.

A major off-season trade added slugging first baseman Dick Stuart to Pesky&#x27;s maiden roster, and while Stuart would lead the American League with 118 runs batted in during 1963, he was an atrocious fielder (nicknamed &quot;Dr. Strangeglove&quot; and &quot;Stonefingers&quot;) who would constantly defy Pesky&#x27;s authority and make it difficult for him to control his players. Pesky&#x27;s 1963 club started quickly. It won 40 of its first 70 games and on June 28 stood only games behind the league-leading Yankees. The team&#x27;s standout performer, relief pitcher Dick Radatz (converted to the bullpen by Pesky at Seattle in 1961), had saved 12 games and won seven others with a 1.16 earned run average to keep the Red Sox in contention to that point.

But the team buckled from poor defense and, apart from Radatz and 20-game-winning starter Bill Monbouquette, lack of pitching depth; it went only 36–55 for the rest of the campaign to finish 76–85 and in seventh place in the ten-team American League. The following year, despite another strong contribution from Radatz and the debut of star 19-year-old rookie outfielder Tony Conigliaro, the 1964 Sox continued to languish in the second division, winning only 70 of the 160 games Pesky managed. With two games left in the season, he was replaced as manager by Billy Herman, the club&#x27;s third-base coach and a friend of Higgins.

===Four years with Pittsburgh Pirates===
Pesky then left the Red Sox for four seasons, and joined the Pittsburgh Pirates organization. From 1965 through 1967, he served as first-base coach for Pirate manager Harry Walker, who had hit the double that scored Enos Slaughter with the winning run in the eighth inning of Game 7 of the 1946 World Series—the play on which Pesky was rather dubiously accused of &quot;holding the ball&quot; on a relay from the outfield, allegedly hesitating as Slaughter made his &quot;mad dash&quot; for home from first base. After Walker&#x27;s firing in 1967, Pesky managed the Bucs&#x27; Triple-A farm club, the Columbus Jets of the International League, to a second-place finish in 1968.

==Return to the Red Sox==
After the 1968 season, Pesky returned to the Red Sox organization as a color commentator on the Sox&#x27; radio and television announcing crew. A few days after he took on the job, his old friend Ted Williams, newly named manager of the Washington Senators, asked Pesky to be his bench coach and top aide. Although tempted by Williams&#x27; offer, Pesky decided to remain in Boston. He worked with Ken Coleman and Ned Martin on Boston&#x27;s WHDH Radio and TV from 1969 to 1971, then strictly on television with Coleman on WBZ-TV from 1972 to 1974. He later served as analyst for selected games on radio with Joe Castiglione calling play-by-play.

In 1975, Pesky finally returned to uniform as a full-time coach under manager Darrell Johnson. As in Pittsburgh, he worked at first base and, in his first season back on the field, the Bosox won the 1975 American League East title, swept the three-time world champion Oakland Athletics in the 1975 American League Championship Series, and battled the Cincinnati Reds in a thrilling, seven-game World Series. Pesky remained first-base coach under Johnson and his successor, Don Zimmer, before moving to a bench and batting coach role for Zimmer in 1980. The Red Sox had been contenders for most of the late 1970s, but in 1980 they stumbled to fourth place in the AL East, resulting in Zimmer&#x27;s dismissal with five games left in the season. Pesky took command as interim pilot, and Boston lost four of five, to finish Pesky&#x27;s career managing record at 147–179 (.451).

The following season, another old friend, Ralph Houk, became Boston&#x27;s manager, and Pesky resumed his role as the club&#x27;s batting and bench coach. He was especially valued by Sox slugger Jim Rice, with whom Pesky worked tirelessly. Pesky missed the entire 1983 season with a serious food allergy that caused severe weight loss, but once the source of the illness was discovered, he was able to return for a final season as a full-time coach in 1984. From 1985 until his death, he served as a special instructor and assistant to the general manager, often suiting up before games to work with players. In 1990, at age 71, he also spent almost 2½ months as interim manager of Boston&#x27;s top farm club, the Pawtucket Red Sox, when the team&#x27;s skipper, Ed Nottle, was fired in June.

==Managerial record==
==Later years==

Intermittently, Pesky was allowed to sit on the Red Sox bench during games, but three times was prevented from the task—once by his own general manager, Dan Duquette, a second time when the Baltimore Orioles complained to MLB, and a third time in March 2007, when Major League Baseball announced it would enforce limitations that only six coaches could be in uniform during a game. As an instructor, Pesky was ineligible. On April 3, 2007, the North Shore Spirit, a now-defunct team in the Independent Can-Am League, in Lynn, Massachusetts, invited Pesky to sit in their dugout—and serve as an honorary coach—anytime he wanted.

When the Red Sox returned to the World Series in 2004 to face the Cardinals for a third time, Pesky was officially a Special Assignment Instructor and watched the final out of Game 4, where the Red Sox sealed a sweep and their first World Series win in 86 years, from the visiting clubhouse at Busch Stadium. In the celebration that immediately followed, he was embraced by members of the Curse-breaking, title-winning Sox such as Tim Wakefield, Curt Schilling and Kevin Millar as a living representative of past Red Sox stars whose teams had fallen short of winning the Fall Classic, at times literally at the final hurdle. As John Powers wrote for the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, &quot;Pesky was the stand-in for all of the Towne Teamers who&#x27;d gotten to the World Series and fell short. For teammate Ted Williams, who wept in the clubhouse after batting .200 in 1946. For Jim Lonborg, who won two games with brilliant pitching in 1967 but was battered on two days&#x27; rest in the finale. For Carl Yastrzemski, who played on two teams that lost the Series in the seventh game. And for Bill Buckner, who had the grounder go between his legs in 1986.&quot;

He played a poignant and prominent role in the ceremony in which the World Series Championship Rings were handed out (April 11, 2005, before the Red Sox home season opener against the Yankees) – and he himself was awarded the World Series ring that had eluded him as a player and manager. Bill Simmons, who was present that day, wrote for ESPN in a column that was republished in &quot;Now I Can Die In Peace&quot; that Pesky received the biggest cheer as a living &quot;reminder of everything that had happened since 1918.&quot; (As others had pointed out, not only had Pesky been the shortstop during Slaughter&#x27;s Mad Dash, but he had been born within six months of the 1918 World Series, and his wife&#x27;s given name was Ruth.) With the help of Carl Yastrzemski, Pesky raised the 2004 World Series Championship banner up the Fenway Park center field flagpole. After the Red Sox swept the Colorado Rockies in the 2007 World Series, Pesky once again received a ring and was given the honor of raising the newest Red Sox championship banner on April 8, 2008.

On his 87th birthday, September 27, 2006, the Red Sox honored Pesky by officially naming the right-field foul pole &quot;Pesky&#x27;s Pole&quot;, although it had already been unofficially known as such. On September 23, 2008, the Red Sox announced that they would retire the number 6 Pesky wore as a player to mark his 89th birthday and his long years of service to the club. (Pesky wore #22 as the team&#x27;s manager in the 1960s, and #35 as a coach from 1975 to 1980. Although he reclaimed #6 and wore it from 1981 to 1984, between 1985 and its retirement the number also was assigned to players such as Bill Buckner, Rick Cerone, Damon Berryhill and Tony Peña.)

Pesky&#x27;s was the sixth number retired by the Red Sox; his number retired was the first to break the club&#x27;s code to have a number retired: being in the Baseball Hall of Fame and having spent at least ten years with the Red Sox (Pesky has not been selected for the Hall of Fame).

Pesky was a longtime resident of Boston&#x27;s North Shore, living in Lynn and then Swampscott, Massachusetts. He was a visible member of the community, making personal appearances for the Red Sox. For years, he was a commercial spokesman on television and radio for a local supplier of doors and windows, JB Sash and Door Company. The commercials were deliberately and humorously corny, with Pesky and the company&#x27;s owner calling themselves &quot;the Window Boys.&quot;

On May 16, 2009, Pesky was given an honorary degree during Salem State College&#x27;s 199th commencement ceremony. On April 20, 2012, Boston Red Sox fans celebrated the 100th birthday of Fenway Park, and Johnny Pesky was a participant. He was brought out to second base in a wheelchair, aside Bobby Doerr, to join over 200 past Red Sox players and coaches through the decades.

==Death==
Pesky died on August 13, 2012, at the Kaplan Family Hospice House in Danvers, Massachusetts, at the age of 93; he was buried next to his wife Ruth, who died in 2005. Many in Boston and in Red Sox Nation mourned his passing, and John Dennis began the first edition of the Dennis &amp; Callahan Show on WEEI-FM in Boston after his death by saying that it had felt like every New Englander&#x27;s grandfather had died.

<text>Bjärred (, ) is a coastal locality situated in Lomma Municipality, Skåne County, Sweden. It is situated about 20 km north of Malmö, 10 km west of Lund and 5 km north of Lomma village.
With 9,874 inhabitants in 2016, it is the second largest locality in Lomma Municipality and accounts for around 41% of its inhabitants. Bjärred largely serves as a suburb of Malmö and Lund.

Among the sights in the town is the open-air swimming-baths, situated 500 meters out on the jetty &quot;Långa bryggan&quot;.

==History==
The name Bjärred is thought to come from the Danish word &quot;bjerg&quot;, which means height or hill, and may refer to the height at which the settlement appears when viewed from the sea.

The town grew up as a seaside resort for the nearby city of Lund during the 1800s. The construction of an 11-km long railway between Lund and Bjärred began in 1899, and the railway opened for traffic on July 27, 1901. The railway was electrified in 1916, however, it did not prove commercially successful and closed on June 15, 1939, with the rails being removed in 1940.

The population of Bjärred has grown strongly since the mid-1900s, from 864 residents in 1960 to 9,874 residents in 2010.

==Geography==
The settlement can be divided into four areas: Löddesnäs in the north-west, Borgeby in the north, Centrum in the central part of the town and Gamla Bjärred and Haboljung in the south. A large yard named Bjerehof within the settlement has given its name to the eponymous dwelling area in central Bjärred, along with a school and sports hall. What is now the central part of Bjärred was formally Högsäters orchard, founded by Eric Jungquist in the beginning of the 1920s.

Along the beach in Löddesnäs in north Bjärred there is a nature reserve whose main feature is the 10–15 m high wall, Littorinavallen, which runs parallel to the beach. Above the wall in an meadow named Gyllins meadow, after the owner of a large part of Bjärred in the 1900s. The river Lödde å runs into the Öresund north of Bjärred, where there is also a bird-watching tower.

The village has a shallow beach on the Öresund, with bathing jetty which, at 524 m, is one of the longest in Sweden. During 2004 an outdoor baths opened at the end of the jetty, which also houses a restaurant.


== Sports ==
The handball club HK Ankaret is located within Bjärred, and is one of the most successful youth handball clubs in Sweden. As of the 2016-2017 season the team plays in Division 1.
