<text>Failover is switching to a redundant or standby computer server, system, hardware component or network upon the failure or abnormal termination of the previously active application, server, system, hardware component, or network in a computer network. Failover and switchover are essentially the same operation, except that failover is automatic and usually operates without warning, while switchover requires human intervention. 
Systems designers usually provide failover capability in servers, systems or networks requiring near-continuous availability and a high degree of reliability.

At the server level, failover automation usually uses a &quot;heartbeat&quot; system that connects two servers, either through using a separate cable (for example, RS-232 serial ports/cable) or a network connection. In the most common design, as long as a regular &quot;pulse&quot; or &quot;heartbeat&quot; continues between the main server and the second server, the second server will not bring its systems online; however a few systems actively use all servers and can failover their work to remaining servers after a failure. There may also be a third &quot;spare parts&quot; server that has running spare components for &quot;hot&quot; switching to prevent downtime. The second server takes over the work of the first as soon as it detects an alteration in the &quot;heartbeat&quot; of the first machine. Some systems have the ability to send a notification of failover.

Certain systems, intentionally, do not failover entirely automatically, but require human intervention. This &quot;automated with manual approval&quot; configuration runs automatically once a human has approved the failover.

Failback is the process of restoring a system, component, or service previously in a state of failure back to its original, working state, and having the standby system go from functioning back to standby.

The use of virtualization software has allowed failover practices to become less reliant on physical hardware through the process referred to as migration in which a running virtual machine is moved from one physical host to another, with little or no disruption in service.

Failover and Failback technology are also regularly used in the Microsoft SQL Server database, in which SQL Server Failover Cluster Instance (FCI) is installed/configured on top of the Windows Server failover Cluster (WSFC). The SQL Server groups and resources running on WSFC can manually be failover to the second node for any planned maintenance on the first node OR automatically failover to the second node in case of any issues on the first node. In the same way, a failback operation can be performed to the first node once the issue is resolved or maintenance is done on it.

== History ==

The term &quot;failover&quot;, although probably in use by engineers much earlier, can be found in a 1962 declassified NASA report. The term &quot;switchover&quot; can be found in the 1950s when describing &#x27;&quot;Hot&quot; and &quot;Cold&quot; Standby Systems&#x27;, with the current meaning of immediate switchover to a running system (hot) and delayed switchover to a system that needs starting (cold). A conference proceedings from 1957 describes computer systems with both Emergency Switchover (i.e. failover) and Scheduled Failover (for maintenance).

<doc id="796241" wikidata="Q33845" url="?curid=796241" title="Neapolitan language">
<text>Neapolitan (autonym: ; ) is a Romance language of the Italo-Romance group spoken in most of continental Southern Italy. It is named after the Kingdom of Naples, which once covered most of the area, and the city of Naples was its capital. On 14 October 2008, a law by the Region of Campania stated that Neapolitan was to be protected.

While the language group is native to much of continental Southern Italy or the former Kingdom of Naples, the terms &quot;Neapolitan&quot;, &quot;napulitano&quot; or &quot;napoletano&quot; may also instead refer more narrowly to the specific variety spoken natively in the city of Naples and the immediately surrounding Naples metropolitan area and Campania region. The present article mostly deals with this variety, which enjoys a certain degree of prestige and has historically wide written attestations.

== Distribution ==
Largely due to massive Southern Italian migration in the late 19th century and 20th century, there are also a number of Neapolitan speakers in Italian diaspora communities in the United States, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Mexico, and Venezuela. However, in the United States, traditional Neapolitan has had considerable contact with English and the Sicilian languages spoken by Sicilian and Calabrian immigrants living alongside Neapolitan-speaking immigrants and so the Neapolitan in the US is now significantly different from the contemporary Neapolitan spoken in Naples. English words are often used in place of Neapolitan words, especially among second-generation speakers. On the other hand, the effect of Standard Italian on Neapolitan in Italy has been similar because of the increasing displacement of Neapolitan by Standard Italian in daily speech.

== Classification ==

Neapolitan is a Romance language and is considered as part of Southern Italo-Romance. There are notable differences among the various dialects, but they are all generally mutually intelligible.

Italian and Neapolitan are of variable mutual comprehensibility, depending on affective and linguistic factors. There are notable grammatical differences, such as Neapolitan having nouns in the neuter form and a unique plural formation, as well as historical phonological developments, which often obscure the cognacy of lexical items.

Its evolution has been similar to that of Italian and other Romance languages from their roots in Vulgar Latin. It may reflect a pre-Latin Oscan substratum, as in the pronunciation of the &quot;d&quot; sound as an &quot;r&quot; sound (rhotacism) at the beginning of a word or between two vowels: e.g. &quot;doje&quot; (feminine) or &quot;duje&quot; (masculine), meaning &quot;two&quot;, is pronounced, and often spelled, as &quot;roje&quot;/&quot;ruje&quot;; &quot;vedé&quot; (&quot;to see&quot;) as &quot;veré&quot;, and often spelled so; also &quot;cadé&quot;/&quot;caré&quot; (&quot;to fall&quot;) and &quot;Madonna&quot;/&quot;Maronna&quot;. Another purported Oscan influence is the historical assimilation of the consonant cluster as , pronounced (this is generally reflected in spelling more consistently: vs Italian &quot;world&quot;; vs 
Italian &quot;when&quot;), along with the development of as ~ ( vs Italian &quot;drum&quot;), also consistently reflected in spelling. Other effects of the Oscan substratum are postulated, but substratum claims are highly controversial. As in many other languages in the Italian Peninsula, Neapolitan has an adstratum greatly influenced by other Romance languages (Catalan, Spanish and Franco-Provençal above all), Germanic languages and Greek (both ancient and modern). The language had never been standardised, and the word for &quot;tree&quot; has three different spellings: , and .

Neapolitan has enjoyed a rich literary, musical and theatrical history (notably Giambattista Basile, Eduardo Scarpetta, his son Eduardo De Filippo, Salvatore Di Giacomo and Totò). Thanks to this heritage and the musical work of Renato Carosone in the 1950s, Neapolitan is still in use in popular music, even gaining national popularity in the songs of Pino Daniele and the Nuova Compagnia di Canto Popolare.

The language has no official status within Italy and is not taught in schools. The University of Naples Federico II offers (from 2003) courses in Campanian Dialectology at the faculty of Sociology, whose actual aim is not to teach students to speak the language but to study its history, usage, literature and social role. There are also ongoing legislative attempts at the national level to have it recognized as an official minority language of Italy. It is a recognized ISO 639 Joint Advisory Committee language with the ISO 639-3 language code of &quot;nap&quot;.

Here is the IPA pronunciation of the Neapolitan spoken in the city of Naples:

== Alphabet and pronunciation ==
Neapolitan orthography consists of 22 Latin letters. Much like Italian orthography, it does not contain &quot;k,&quot; &quot;w,&quot; &quot;x,&quot; or &quot;y&quot; even though these letters might be found in some foreign words; unlike Italian, it does contain the letter &quot;j&quot;. The following English pronunciation guidelines are based on General American pronunciation, and the values used may not apply to other dialects. (See also: International Phonetic Alphabet chart for English dialects.)

All Romance languages are closely related. Although Neapolitan shares a high degree of its vocabulary with Italian, the official language of Italy, differences in pronunciation often make the connection unrecognizable to those without knowledge of Neapolitan. The most striking phonological difference is the Neapolitan weakening of unstressed vowels into schwa (&quot;schwa&quot; is pronounced like the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;about&quot; or the &quot;u&quot; in &quot;upon&quot;). However, it is also possible (and quite common for some Neapolitans) to speak standard Italian with a &quot;Neapolitan accent&quot;; that is, by pronouncing un-stressed vowels as schwa or by pronouncing the letter s as (like the &quot;sh&quot; in &quot;ship&quot;) instead of (like the &quot;s&quot; in &quot;sea&quot; or the &quot;ss&quot; in &quot;pass&quot;) when the letter is in initial position followed by a consonant, but not when it is followed by a dental occlusive or (at least in the purest form of the language) but by otherwise using only entirely standard words and grammatical forms. This is not Neapolitan properly, but rather a mere difference in Italian pronunciation.

Therefore, while pronunciation presents the strongest barrier to comprehension, the grammar of Neapolitan is what sets it apart from Italian. In Neapolitan, for example, the gender and number of a word is expressed by a change in the accented vowel because it no longer distinguishes final unstressed , and (e.g. &quot;luongo&quot; , &quot;longa&quot; ; Italian &quot;lungo, &quot;lunga; masc. &quot;long&quot;, fem. &quot;long&quot;), whereas in Italian it is expressed by a change in the final vowel. These and other morpho-syntactic differences distinguish the Neapolitan language from the Italian language and the Neapolitan accent.

Neapolitan has had a significant influence on the intonation of Rioplatense Spanish spoken in Buenos Aires and the surrounding region of Argentina and in the entire country of Uruguay.

=== Vowels ===
While there are only five graphic vowels in Neapolitan, phonemically, there are eight. Stressed vowels and can be either &quot;closed&quot; or &quot;open&quot; and the pronunciation is different for the two. The grave accent (, , ) is used to denote open vowels, and the acute accent (, , , ) is used to denote closed vowels, with alternative and . However, accent marks are not commonly used in the actual spelling of words except when they occur on the final syllable of a word, such as , , or , and when they appear here in other positions, it is only to demonstrate where the stress, or accent, falls in some words. Also, the circumflex is used to mark a long vowel where it would not normally occur (e.g. &quot;you are&quot;).


=== Consonants ===


=== Digraphs and trigraphs ===
The following clusters are always geminated if vowel-following.
== Grammar ==
=== Definite articles ===
The Neapolitan classical definite articles (corresponding to the English word &quot;the&quot;) are (feminine singular), (masculine singular) and (plural for both).

Before a word beginning with a consonant:

&quot;C:&quot; = the initial consonant of the following word is geminated if followed by a vowel.

These definite articles are always pronounced distinctly.

Before a word beginning with a vowel, or are used 
for both masculine and feminine, singular and plural. Although both forms can be found, the form is by far the most common.

In Neapolitan, the gender of a noun is not easily determined by the article, so other means must be used. In the case of , which can be either masculine singular or neuter singular (there is no neuter plural in Neapolitan), the initial consonant of the noun is doubled when it is neuter. For example, the name of a language in Neapolitan is always neuter, so if we see we know it refers to the Neapolitan language, whereas would refer to a Neapolitan man.

Likewise, since can be either masculine or feminine plural, when it is feminine plural, the initial consonant of the noun is doubled. For example, consider , which in Neapolitan is feminine singular, meaning &quot;the list&quot;. In the plural, it becomes .

There can also be problems with nouns whose singular form ends in . Since plural nouns usually end in whether masculine or feminine, the masculine plural is often signaled orthographically, that is, by altering the spelling. As an example, consider the word , which means &quot;boy&quot; or (in the feminine form) &quot;girl&quot;:

More will be said about these orthographically changing nouns in the section on Neapolitan nouns.

A couple of notes about consonant doubling:

*Doubling is a function of the article (and certain other words), and these same words may be seen in other contexts without the consonant doubled. More will be said about this in the section on consonant doubling.
*Doubling only occurs when a vowel follows the consonant. No doubling occurs if it is followed by another consonant, such as in the word &quot;spagnuolo (Spanish)&quot;.

=== Indefinite articles ===
The Neapolitan indefinite articles, corresponding to the English &quot;a&quot; or &quot;an&quot;, are presented in the following table:

=== Verbal conjugation ===
In Neapolitan there are four finite moods: indicative, subjunctive, conditional and imperative, and three non-finite modes: infinitive, gerund and participle. Each mood has an active and a passive form. The only auxiliary verbs used in the active form is (Eng. &quot;to have&quot;, It. ), which contrasts with Italian, in which the intransitive and reflexive verbs take for their auxiliary. For example, we have:

;Neapolitan
;Italian
=== Doubled initial consonants ===
In Neapolitan, many times the initial consonant of a word is doubled. This is called &quot;raddoppiamento sintattico&quot; in Italian as it also applies to the Italian phonology.
* All feminine plural nouns, preceded by the feminine plural definite article, , or any feminine plural adjective, have their initial consonant doubled.
* All neuter singular nouns, when preceded by the neuter singular definite article, , or by a neuter singular adjective, have their initial consonant doubled.
* In addition, other words also trigger this doubling. Below is a list of words that trigger the doubling of the initial consonant of the following word.
However, when there is a pause after the &quot;trigger&quot; word, the phonological doubling does not occur (e.g. , &quot;You are a boy&quot;, where is a &quot;trigger&quot; word causing doubling of the initial consonant in , but in the phrase &quot;Where are you from, boy?&quot;, no doubling occurs. Neither does doubling occur when the initial consonant is followed by another consonant (other than or ), e.g. &quot;the Italian language&quot;, but &quot;the Spanish language&quot;, where is the neuter definite article).
This doubling phenomenon happens phonologically (in pronunciation), and the doubling is not required in spelling. The same thing happens in Italian, where multiple words trigger first-consonant doubling, e.g. but , , etc.

==== Words that trigger doubling in pronunciation ====
* The conjunctions &#x27; and &#x27; but not (e.g. ; ; but )
* The prepositions &#x27;, &#x27;, (e.g. ; ; )
* The negation , short for (e.g. )
* The indefinites &#x27;, &#x27; (e.g. ; )
* Interrogative &#x27; and relative &#x27; but not (e.g. )
* (e.g. )
* From the verb &quot;&quot;, &#x27;; &#x27;; &#x27; but not &#x27; (e.g. ; ; ; but )
* (e.g. )
* The number (e.g. )
* The neuter definite article (e.g. , but )
* The neuter pronoun (e.g. )
* Demonstrative adjectives &#x27; and &#x27; which refer to neuter nouns in indefinite quantities (e.g. ; ) but not in definite quantities (e.g. ; )
* The feminine plural definite article (e.g. ; )
* The plural feminine pronoun , e.g., 
* The plural masculine pronoun &#x27; preceding a verb, but not when &#x27; is an article; in , the first is an article, so it does not trigger doubling; the second does trigger doubling because it is a masculine plural pronoun.
* The locative (e.g. )
* From the verb : (e.g. )
* From the verb : &#x27;; &#x27; (e.g. )
* Special case

<text>William Boyd McKechnie (August 7, 1886 – October 29, 1965) was an American professional baseball player, manager and coach. He played in Major League Baseball as a third baseman during the dead-ball era. McKechnie was the first manager to win World Series titles with two teams (1925 Pittsburgh Pirates and 1940 Cincinnati Reds), and remains one of only three managers to win pennants with three teams, also capturing the National League title in 1928 with the St. Louis Cardinals. His 1,892 career victories ranked fourth in major league history when he ended his managing career in 1946, and trailed only John McGraw&#x27;s NL total of 2,669 in league history. He was nicknamed &quot;Deacon&quot; because he sang in his church choir and generally lived a quiet life.

==Early life==
McKechnie was born on August 7, 1886, to Archibald and Mary McKechnie, two Scottish immigrants who had settled in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, shortly before Bill was born.

==Playing career==

McKechnie made his major league debut in 1907 with the Pittsburgh Pirates, appearing in three games, before reemerging with the team in 1910 in a more substantial role. A utility infielder for the first half of his career before playing more substantially at third base later on, McKechnie played with the Pirates (1907, 1910–1912, 1918, 1920), Boston Braves (1913), New York Yankees (1913), Indianapolis Hoosiers/Newark Peppers (1914–15), New York Giants (1916) and Cincinnati Reds (1916–17). His best offensive season came in 1914 with the Hoosiers, when he scored 107 runs, batted .304 and stole 47 bases.

In 846 games over 11 major league seasons, McKechnie posted a .251 batting average (713-for-2843) with 319 runs, 8 home runs, 240 RBI, 127 stolen bases and 190 bases on balls. Defensively, he recorded an overall .954 fielding percentage playing at third, second, first base and shortstop.

==Managing career==
===Newark Peppers===
In 1913, McKechnie had his worst season as a full-time player, batting only .134. However, Yankees manager Frank Chance thought McKechnie had a keen baseball mind, and had him sit next to him on the bench during games. Two years later, McKechnie got his first taste of managerial duties, when he served as player-manager of the Newark Peppers of the Federal League, leading the team to a 54–45 record.

===Post–playing career===
After he retired as a player, he managed for a year in the minors before assuming the helm of the Pirates in 1922. He managed the Pirates from 1922 to 1926, St. Louis Cardinals in 1928, St. Louis Cardinals again after they rehired him in 1929, Boston Braves from 1930 to 1937, and Cincinnati Reds from 1938 to 1946. He compiled 1,896 wins and 1,723 losses for a .524 winning percentage over his managerial career. His teams won four National League pennants (1925, 1928, 1939 and 1940) and two World Series championships (1925 and 1940), and he remains the only manager to win National League pennants with three teams (Pittsburgh, St. Louis and Cincinnati).

===Pittsburgh Pirates===

He took over the Pirates in the middle of the 1922 season, as George Gibson was fired after going 32-33. McKechnie led the Pirates to 53 wins in 90 games to maneuver them into a third place finish in the National League. Third place awaited the Pirates for the next two years, but the 1925 season proved a breakthrough as the Pirates went 95-58 and won the pennant, which was the first pennant for the club in sixteen years, led by future Hall of Famers such as Max Carey, Kiki Cuyler, and Pie Traynor. Pittsburgh faced off against the Washington Senators, who had won the World Series the previous year while brought on fellow Hall of Famers in manager Bucky Harris, Stan Coveleski, Goose Goslin, Sam Rice, and Walter Johnson. The Pirates won just one of the first four games, needing to win to drive the Series back to Pittsburgh. They held the Senators (who had scored fourteen runs in the past four games to seven for Pittsburgh) to five total runs in the next two games to force a Game 7 with Johnson on the mound against Ray Kremer. Amid rain and fog in Forbes Field, the Senators built an early lead with four runs in the first inning. However, the Pirates responded each time Washington would score, and this included a 7-6 game going into the bottom of the eighth inning. Two outs were followed by three hits, a fielder&#x27;s choice, and a walk; Cuyler hit a two-run double off Johnson for the go-ahead runs as Red Oldham got the save to clinch Pittsburgh&#x27;s title. It would be the last World Series title for the Pirates for 35 years.

McKechnie&#x27;s tenure in Pittsburgh unraveled the following year when several of his players thought part-owner, vice president and de facto bench coach Fred Clarke was undermining him. Several of them thought Clarke was trying to regain the job he&#x27;d held from 1900 to 1915. Three veteran players—Max Carey, Carson Bigbee and Babe Adams—demanded Clarke&#x27;s removal from the bench. McKechnie, who by inclination was a player&#x27;s manager, initially appeared to support them. However, fearing that he&#x27;d be seen as opposing the ownership, he was forced to denounce his own players. Ownership struck fast and hard, releasing Bigbee and Adams and waiving Carey. The dispute cut the legs out from under the Pirates, who fell to third with a 84–69 (with four ties) record. McKechnie was fired after the season. He was replaced by Donie Bush, who had short-term success with the Pirates, including winning the pennant in his first season with the club, although his squabbles with Cuyler lead to a subsequent trade and Bush&#x27;s resignation two years later.

===St. Louis Cardinals===

McKechnie was brought in as a coach for the 1927 season for the St. Louis Cardinals. After the year ended, he replaced player-manager Bob O&#x27;Farrell, who was given a $5,000 raise to step down for McKechnie. The Cardinals finished the 1928 season in first place with a record 95 wins and 59 losses. They were swept in the World Series by the New York Yankees. McKechnie left the club after the World Series. Billy Southworth started the 1929 season with 43 wins and 45 losses. Gabby Street managed for a game before McKechnie returned as manager. He finished the 1929 season with a record of 34 wins and 29 losses.

===Boston Braves===

McKechnie was hired to manage the Boston Braves in 1930, replacing Emil Fuchs, who had added manager to his title of owner when he had to trade Rogers Hornsby to try and stay solvent. Financial troubles would plague the Braves alongside other teams in the Great Depression era. His first Braves team finished 70-84 for a sixth place finish in the NL, which was actually an improvement from their record of 56–98 the previous year. McKechnie was not nearly as successful in Boston as he was at his other managerial stops, but he managed to finish &quot;fourth or fifth with teams that should have been eighth,&quot; according to baseball historian Lee Allen. In eight years, he had a winning record four times while finishing in the first division (top four) twice.

In 1933, they finished 83-71 to have their first winning season in twelve years, doing so while finishing fourth, nine games behind New York. They finished 78-73 the next year and finished 16 games behind St. Louis for another fourth place finish. The bottom fell out in 1935, a season in which Babe Ruth returned to play in the city of Boston for the first time in 16 years, with Fuchs also giving him duties of vice president and assistant manager, although these were more ceremonial than anything. According to Allen, McKechnie claimed that Ruth&#x27;s presence made it nearly impossible to enforce discipline. Ruth drew a huge salary, and lived apart from the team on the road. Additionally, years of high living had rendered him a shadow of his former self. Ruth&#x27;s running problems and errors proved such a problem that three pitchers threatened to go on strike if he was in the lineup. Ruth lasted only about a month before retiring, and hit .181. Despite fielding essentially the same team that finished fourth a year earlier, the Braves crumbled to a record of 38–115, the worst record in modern National League history and the second worst in modern major league history. The team improved in the next two years, going 71-83 (with three ties) and 79-73 before McKechnie was hired to manage the Cincinnati Reds in 1938.

===Cincinnati Reds and later career===
According to one baseball reference work, McKechnie had a poor sense of direction, which did not improve when, as the Reds&#x27; manager, he began traveling by plane. He arrived in an airport when the Reds were to play the Pirates at Forbes Field. He hailed a taxi and asked the driver to take him to the Schenley Hotel. &quot;I never heard of it&quot;, said the driver. McKechnie gave him the names of the nearby streets. &quot;Never heard of them either&quot;, the cabbie said. &quot;How long have you been driving a cab here? the manager asked. &quot;Twenty-five years and then some&quot;, said the driver, &quot;But so help me I never heard of the Schenley Hotel! You must be in the wrong town! Where do you think you are?&quot; &quot;Pittsburgh&quot;, McKechnie said. &quot;Pittsburgh, hell!&quot; retorted the driver. &quot;You&#x27;re really lost. This is Detroit!&quot;

McKechnie was an unusual kind of manager for his era. A very religious man, he did not smoke, drink alcohol or use profanity. When he had a problem player who was likely to go out carousing, McKechnie&#x27;s simple solution was to room with him.
In his first season with the Reds, he led them to an 82–68–1 record, finishing 4th in the NL behind the Chicago Cubs. In his second year, he led them to a 97–57–2 record, finishing 1st by games over the St. Louis Cardinals. This was McKechnie&#x27;s third pennant, with each occurring with a different team. In the World Series that year, they were swept by the New York Yankees. In the following year, the Reds managed to improve, winning 100 games (a team first) while winning the NL once again, this time by 12 games over the Brooklyn Dodgers. In the World Series that year, they beat the Detroit Tigers in seven games. The Reds didn&#x27;t win more than 90 games in the rest of McKechnie&#x27;s tenure, but they did manage to finish with a winning record in four of his six final years, including a 2nd place in 1943. 1946 was his final year with the team, managing them to a 64–86 record (with 2 ties), with Hank Gowdy managing the final four games. His last game managed was on September 25 at St. Louis, winning 6–0.
He was hired as a coach to be the right-hand man of young Cleveland Indians manager Lou Boudreau the following year. Once, when Larry Doby (the first African American player in the American League was playing for the Indians, McKechnie prevented him from going up a barrier to confront a racist heckler, saying that it would &quot;ruin you, not him&quot;.

The Boudreau–McKechnie Indians won a World Series in 1948. McKechnie coached with Boudreau for five seasons, with the Indians (1947–49) and Boston Red Sox (1952–53).

McKechnie was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962 and into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1967.

===Managerial record===

==Personal life==

McKechnie died at age 79 in Bradenton, Florida.

The Pirates&#x27; spring training home, McKechnie Field in Bradenton, was named after him until the name changed to LECOM Park in 2017.

McKechnie&#x27;s son Bill Jr. was the farm system director of the Cincinnati Redlegs in the mid-1950s and later served as president of the Florida State League (1961–1962) and Pacific Coast League (1969–1973). He was also the father of former Syracuse radio station WNDR sportscaster Jim McKechnie. Bill McKechnie Jr.&#x27;s son Bill III was born April 20, 1940, and died of cancer in Florida on June 17, 2006.

<text>SimTower: The Vertical Empire (originally published in Japan as ) is a construction and management simulation video game developed by OPeNBooK and released in 1994 for Microsoft Windows and Macintosh System 7. Outside Japan, the game was published by Maxis and branded as part of their Sim series. Ports for Sega Saturn and 3DO were released in 1996. A sequel titled &quot;The Tower II&quot; was released in 1998 and called &quot;Yoot Tower&quot; outside Japan.

The game allows players to build and manage a tower and decide what facilities to place in it, in order to ultimately build a five-star tower. Random events take place during play, such as terrorist acts that the player must respond to immediately.

Critical reception towards the game was generally positive. Reviews praised the game&#x27;s formula, including its open-ended nature and its ability to immerse the player into the game. Criticism targeted the game&#x27;s lack of documentation, which some reviewers found made it harder to learn how to play the game. The in-game speed was also criticized for being too slow, which was a crucial issue in the game because time must pass for the player to earn income to purchase new facilities.

==Gameplay==
&quot;SimTower&quot; allows the player to build and manage the operations of a modern, multi-use skyscraper. They must plan where to place facilities in the tower that include restaurants, condominiums, offices, hotel rooms, retail stores and elevators. To prevent tenants from vacating their properties, the player must keep their stress low by fulfilling their demands for medical centers, parking lots, recycling facilities, clean hotel rooms staffed with housekeepers, and an efficient transportation system, which involves managing elevator traffic. &quot;SimTower&quot;, which was built around an elevator simulation program, places a strong emphasis on good elevator management.

The game begins with a one-star tower with limited building options. To increase the tower&#x27;s star rating, it must attract more tenants by providing more living space (or office space, and later in the game, hotel and various types of commercial space). New facilities are made available while the tower progresses from a one-star rating to a five-star rating. The highest achievable rating is the designation of &quot;Tower&quot; which can only be awarded by building a cathedral at the very top of a five-star building with all possible tower levels above ground developed. The tower is limited to a maximum of 100 floors above ground and nine stories below ground. Standard elevators, which can span a maximum of 30 floors, and express elevators, which can span the entire height of the building, must be used efficiently to decrease tenant stress.

Certain events can take place in the course of managing the tower. For example, terrorists may phone the player to let them know that they have hidden a bomb in the building, and that they demand a ransom. If the ransom is not paid, then security services must find the bomb before it detonates, or else the tower will incur significant damages. If the player builds facilities underground, the game may notify them that their workers have discovered gold treasure, which gives the player a significant amount of funds. At random intervals during the game, there are notifications that state that a VIP will be visiting the tower soon, so the player must prepare for their visit. If the VIP enjoys their visit because of variables such as a comfortable hotel suite and efficient navigation, the VIP will give the tower a favorable rating. A favorable rating would then allow the tower to advance to the next star level, assuming the other qualifications are met. Although it does not have any impact on the tower, at the end of the fourth quarter every year in the game, Santa Claus and his reindeer fly across the tower.

==Development==
Developed by Yoot Saito of OPeNBooK, &quot;SimTower&quot; was originally titled &quot;The Tower&quot;. It works on computers running the Microsoft Windows or Macintosh System 7 operating systems; the game will operate on 68k-based Macs at a minimum. It requires 8-bit colors and four megabytes of random-access memory. Graphics and sounds used in &quot;SimTower&quot; are similar to those of previous &quot;Sim&quot; games, and high-resolution graphics are also used. The sound effects are kept to a minimum; noises that are played in the background include office &quot;buzz&quot; and elevator bells.

While attending Waseda University, Saito played &quot;SimCity&quot; on the Macintosh, which prompted him to pursue video game creation after graduating. His first game was a simulation title that was part of a future media project for a publishing house. When Saito asked to develop a second, the business refused because it was not a video game company. He left the company to personally produce the second game, which built on ideas he conceived while working on his first: elevators and towers. Saito teamed up with freelance programmer Takumi Abe to complete the project. To research the gameplay, Saito contacted an elevator company to learn about elevator scheduling and management. However, the company declined to provide the information. Saito handled the graphic design, starting with a monochromatic scaled tower created in HyperCard. The designer added color to differentiate between office- and hotel-type buildings. As development neared completion, Saito noticed that the Mac&#x27;s performance had improved and decided to increase the color palette size from 16 to 256 colors. Saito enlisted a second designer to produce animation for the graphics and improve the details for the color increase.

==Release and reception==

&quot;SimTower&quot; was successful in Japan, earning the developers a profit. The &quot;Nihon Keizai Shimbun&quot; awarded Saito the &quot;Best Young Manager/Venture of the Year&quot; for his work on the game. After the initial Japanese release, Maxis president Jeff Braun contacted Saito regarding a worldwide release; &quot;SimCity&quot; creator Will Wright had informed Braun of the game. The company localized the game for sale in the United States, and changed the name to capitalize on the popularity of the &quot;Sim&quot; franchise and increase sales figures. Maxis published &quot;SimTower&quot; for the Windows and Macintosh System 7 operating systems in November 1994 in the United States. In 1996, it was ported to the Sega Saturn and 3DO Interactive Multiplayer in Japan.

The &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; praised the game&#x27;s formula, noting that it followed in the footsteps of previous open-ended Maxis games. Comparing &quot;SimTower&quot; to &quot;SimCity 2000&quot;, the review remarked that it was more interesting to watch people live out their lives in a tower rather than to observe cars moving around. They also appreciated the &quot;homely&quot; feeling of &quot;SimTower&quot;, in contrast with other &quot;Sim&quot; games such as &quot;SimEarth&quot; and &quot;SimLife&quot;, which they felt were too universal to take on a personal identity. Benjamin Svetkey of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised the game and commented that it is &quot;more fun than [the concept] sounds&quot;. However, he stated that the gameplay may be too much for fans of the series. A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; panned the game, saying it lacks the bustling interactivity of previous games in the Sim franchise: &quot;There are bug infestations and the occasional fire with which to deal, but most of the time, &quot;SimTower&quot; sees you standing around waiting for cash reserves to grow in order to add more floors. Not much fun at all.&quot; Australia&#x27;s &quot;The Age&quot; found &quot;SimTower&quot; a pleasing return to form for Maxis, after the release of the disappointing &quot;SimFarm&quot;. Lisa Karen Savignano of Allgame stated that the game had decent graphics and sound. However, she also felt that &quot;SimTower&quot; had good replay value due to the non-linear gameplay, giving the game four stars out of five.

The game was criticized by the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; for lacking documentation, making it more difficult to learn how to play the game. They also predicted that players would be unhappy with the game&#x27;s speed, as time plays an important role in earning money from tenants. Before the player can purchase new facilities, a long period of time must pass before income is earned from tenants. The newspaper was also unhappy with complaints from tenants; specific reasons for their dissatisfaction are never given. &quot;The Age&quot; was disappointed by the lack of pre-built towers and scenarios, suggesting that one along the lines of &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;″s plot could have been included. &quot;Game Informer&quot; referred to &quot;SimTower&quot; as a &quot;lesser-known&quot; simulation game, and described it as &quot;fun and addictive&quot;. Writing for the &quot;San Diego Union-Tribune&quot;, Matt Miller felt that, when compared to &quot;SimCity 2000&quot; (1993), gameplay in &quot;SimTower&quot; moved slowly. He also disliked the moments when he had to wait several minutes to pass by before he could make enough money to purchase new additions for his building. &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine&#x27;s reviewers Jay and Dee praised the visuals and gameplay. However, the two commented that the game can feel slow because it lacks gameplay elements and options present in other strategy games. In 1995, the Software and Information Industry Association listed &quot;SimTower&quot; as the &quot;Best Simulation Program&quot; in the Consumer software category of their annual Codie awards.

The game was followed by &quot;Yoot Tower&quot; (called &quot;The Tower II&quot; in Japan), also designed by Yoot Saito, which was initially released on November 24, 1998, for the Macintosh. It was later made available for the Windows operating systems in January 1999. &quot;Yoot Tower&quot;″s gameplay is similar to that of &quot;SimTower&quot;—players build hotels, resorts, and office buildings, and work towards building a five-star tower. Vivarium launched a version of &quot;SimTower&quot; for the Game Boy Advance, called &quot;The Tower SP&quot;, published by Nintendo in Japan on April 28, 2005, and by Sega in the United States on March 15, 2006. A version of &quot;SimTower&quot; called &quot;The Tower DS&quot; was published by DigiToys in Japan on June 26, 2008. &quot;Yoot Tower&quot; was also released for iPad devices via the online iOS App Store.

<doc id="796253" wikidata="Q38025" url="?curid=796253" title="Kerry Blue Terrier">
<text>The Kerry Blue Terrier (also known as the Irish Blue Terrier) () is a breed of dog. Originally bred to control vermin including rats, rabbits, badgers, ferrets, foxes, otters, hares, deer, and even wolves, over time the Kerry became a general working dog used for a variety of jobs including herding cattle and sheep. Despite a Kerry Blue winning Crufts (the most prestigious UK dog show) in 2000, it remains an &quot;unfashionable&quot; breed, and is distinctly uncommon; however, it is not as threatened as some of the other terrier breeds such as the Skye Terrier, Sealyham Terrier, and Dandie Dinmont Terrier.

==Description==

===Appearance===

Some characteristics of the Kerry Blue Terrier include a long head, flat skull, deep chest, and a soft wavy-to-curly coat that comes in several shades of &quot;blue&quot;, the general term outside this breed being progressive grey. Puppies are born black; the blue appears gradually as the puppy grows older, usually up to 2 years of age. The male Kerry Blue is usually tall at the withers and weighs , while the female is usually and .

===Coat===
The coat is the key feature of the Kerry. It is soft and wavy with no undercoat. The texture feels like a combination of fine human hair and wool. It does not shed but continues to grow throughout the year. This means the Kerry Blue requires very regular grooming (at least once per week) and clipping an average of every 6 weeks.

===Temperament===
Kerry Blue Terriers are strong-minded and highly spirited. They have always been loyal and affectionate towards their owners and very gentle towards children but were often considered hostile toward other animals, including other dogs. If they are socialised with other dogs this is no longer the case. In the early days of competitive dog showing, the Irish Kennel Club required Kerries had to pass a &quot;gameness&quot; test, known as Teastas Mor certification, before they were deemed worthy of being judged. These tests included catching rabbits and bringing a badger to bay in its set. They are fast, strong, and intelligent, and they do well in obedience, dog agility, sheep herding, and tracking. They have been used as police dogs in Ireland. Modern breeders have attempted to retain high spirits whilst breeding out aggression.

==Health==

Spiculosis is a painful condition that causes follicular hyperkeratosis. This condition is only found in the Kerry Blue Terrier. The breed is predisposed to footpad keratosis and hair follicle tumors.

A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 12.4 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

==History==
The first literary reference to probably the Kerry Blue dates to 1847, when the author describes a dog that is bluish slate in colour, marked with darker blotches and patches, and often with black about the legs and muzzle. The Kerry Blue Terrier was first observed in the mountains of Kerry in Ireland, hence the name of the breed.

There is a romantic story of a blue dog swimming ashore from a shipwreck: the coat of this dog was so lovely that it was mated with all the female Wheaten Terriers in Kerry (or in all Ireland, according to some), producing the Kerry Blue. Perhaps this story is not entirely myth, as the Portuguese Water Dog is often suggested as part of the Kerry&#x27;s makeup. Others suggest the Kerry was produced by the Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier crossed with the Bedlington Terrier with (or without) some Irish Wolfhound or Irish Terrier blood. The extinct Gadhar herding dog is also mentioned as another possible branch of the Kerry&#x27;s family tree. The breed became very popular as an all-around farm dog in rural Ireland.

=== National Dog of Ireland ===
With the development of dog shows in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the breed became standardised and &quot;tidied up&quot; for the show ring. The Irish nationalist leader Michael Collins owned a famous Kerry Blue named Convict 224. Collins even made an attempt to have the Kerry Blue adopted as the national dog of Ireland.

The first show of the Dublin Irish Blue Terrier Club took place outside official curfew hours and was entered both by those fighting for and against an Irish republic. The Dublin Irish Blue Terrier Club was so successful it led directly to the foundation of the Irish Kennel Club, and a Kerry Blue was the first dog that club registered.

<doc id="796255" wikidata="Q591677" url="?curid=796255" title="Aus-Rotten">
<text>Aus-Rotten was an American crust punk band formed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Active from 1991 to 2001, its members practiced and promoted a philosophy of anarchist politics. The band included lead vocalist Dave Trenga, vocalist/guitarist Eric Good, bassist Corey Lyons, and drummer Matt Garabedian. Spitboy singer Adrienne Droogas would often join the band in their later material. The band&#x27;s name comes from the German verb &quot;ausrotten&quot;, which translates to &quot;exterminate&quot; or &quot;eradicate&quot;.

==Music==

===Musical style===
According to their Myspace site, Aus-Rotten is influenced by Black Flag, Conflict, Crass, and Subhumans. The band has covered songs by Chumbawamba, Flux of Pink Indians, The Pist, Conflict, Crucifix and Upright Citizens.

Aus-Rotten went through roughly two stylistic periods during its existence; they originated as a bass-heavy hardcore punk band with low-fidelity production, before taking a hiatus and returning with a thicker sound and a second vocalist (Adrienne Droogas, formerly of Spitboy).

===Lyrical themes===
Dave Trenga penned most of the band&#x27;s lyrics. Most of their songs espoused an anarchist worldview, touching upon consumerism, LGBT rights, the Christian right, direct action, feminism, AIDS, immigration, and animal rights.

The band is perhaps most famous for its radical, quotable lyrics (e.g. &quot;People are not expendable, government is&quot;, &quot;As long as flags fly above us, no one&#x27;s really free&quot;), as well as for their strong anti-fascist stance which, according to the interview on the ABC No Rio documentary, got them threatened at least once.

==Post-breakup==
Aus-Rotten went on a hiatus in the mid-&#x27;90s and during that time Dave formed Human Investment with Andy of Anti-Flag and Corey and Eric formed Doomsday Parade. Aus-Rotten broke up for good in early 2001 and members have gone on to form Caustic Christ and Behind Enemy Lines.

&quot;Pittsburgh City Paper&quot; has described Aus-Rotten as &quot;arguably the most important band of the &#x27;90s anarcho-punk renaissance.&quot; The band&#x27;s 1994 &quot;Fuck Nazi Sympathy&quot; 7&quot; sold 25,000 copies, making it Havoc Records&#x27; best-selling release. &quot;Fuck Nazi Sympathy&quot; topped a list of bestselling D.I.Y. Punk record label releases compiled in 2008, outselling anything released on Ebullition, Three One G, Profane Existence, Gravity Records, Lengua Armada, and various other labels. They toured Japan briefly in 1998.

On August 18, 2019 Aus-Rotten performed a few songs at Skull Fest 11 in Pittsburgh.

<text>Henryk Władysław Magnuski (January 30, 1909 – May 4, 1978) was a Polish telecommunications engineer who worked for Motorola in Chicago. He was a primary contributor in the development of one of the first Walkie-Talkie radios, the Motorola SCR-300, and influenced the company&#x27;s success in the field of radio communication.

==Early years==
Magnuski was born on January 30, 1909, in Warsaw. Having lost both parents at a relatively early age, he supported himself and his sister, Janina, by fixing and installing radios for the Polish military. He received his degree from Warsaw University of Technology in 1934 and started working for the &quot;State Tele- and Radiotechnical Works&quot; (&quot;Państwowe Zakłady Tele i Radiotechniczne&quot;) in Warsaw.

In June 1939 he was sent by his company to New York in order to study the latest American projects of radio transmitters. Soon after his arrival to the United States, Poland was invaded by Germany and World War II broke out. His return home became impossible.

==Motorola==
In 1940 he started working for the Galvin Manufacturing Corporation in Chicago (the company changed the name in 1947 to Motorola) and assigned to a team that developed the SCR-300, the first radio used by American forces in Europe to be called a &quot;Walkie-Talkie&quot;. As principal RF engineer on the project and named on three patents for the device, Magnuski is sometimes credited as having &quot;invented the Walkie-Talkie in America&quot;. He later received a U. S. Navy Certificate of Commendation for Outstanding Service for development of the AN/CPN-6 Radar Beacon, a microwave device which aided carrier pilots to find their ship during low visibility conditions.

After the war he did not return to the communist People&#x27;s Republic of Poland and stayed in the USA. He helped in the development of VHF cavity resonators that allowed adjacent channel operation, was a key designer for the Motorola Sensicon receiver which used a selective filter in front of the IF amplifier and created microwave relay equipment for use in transmitting multi-channel telephone, data and TV. In Motorola&#x27;s Government Electronics Division he developed the SSB Radio Central Concept AN/USC-3, Motorola’s RADEM system (RADAS), the Deltaplex I digital troposcatter system and lightweight tropo equipment AN/TRC-105.

==Retirement==
At retirement after 30 years of cooperation with the company, he was the Associate Director of Research for Motorola&#x27;s Government Electronics Division, had 30 patents related to VHF and microwave communications, was an IEEE Fellow and author of numerous technical papers and a chapter in the &quot;Communication System Engineering Handbook&quot;.

He succumbed to cancer at his home in Glenview, Illinois on May 4, 1978.

The Henry Magnuski Electrical and Computer Engineering professorship at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is named in his honor.

On October 6, 2006, Henryk Magnuski was one of the first five inductees into the Illinois Engineering Hall of Fame.

Polish TVP aired a documentary on the life of Henryk Magnuski on January 27, 2021. It was the first in a series of documentaries on famous Polish scientists and inventors.

==Personal life==
Magnuski&#x27;s son is Hank Magnuski, pioneer of PC-to-fax technology.

<doc id="796260" wikidata="Q3296317" url="?curid=796260" title="Isokon Flats">
<text>Isokon Flats, also known as Lawn Road Flats and the Isokon building, on Lawn Road, Belsize Park in the London Borough of Camden, is a reinforced-concrete block of 36 flats (originally 32), designed by Canadian engineer Wells Coates for Molly and Jack Pritchard.

== Pre-war years ==
Designs for the flats were developed between 1929–1932 and the complex opened on 9 July 1934 as an experiment in minimalist urban living. All of the &quot;Existenzminimum&quot; flats had very small kitchens as there was a communal kitchen for the preparation of meals, connected to the residential floors via a dumb waiter. Services, including laundry and shoe-polishing, were provided on site.

The building originally included 24 studio flats, eight one-bedroom flats, staff quarters, a kitchen and a large garage. The Pritchards lived in a one-bedroom penthouse flat at the top with their two sons Jeremy and Jonathan next door in a studio flat. Plywood was used extensively in the fittings of the apartments; Jack Pritchard was marketing manager for the Estonian plywood company Venesta between 1926 and 1936, while he also operated the Isokon Furniture Company, originally in partnership with Wells Coates.

Celebrated residents included: Bauhaus émigrés Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer, and László Moholy-Nagy; architects Egon Riss and Arthur Korn; writer Agatha Christie (between 1941 and 1947) and her husband Max Mallowan, art historian Adrian Stokes, the author Nicholas Monsarrat, the archaeologist V. Gordon Childe, modernist architect Jacques Groag and his wife, textile designer Jacqueline Groag. The communal kitchen was converted into the Isobar restaurant in 1937, to a design by Marcel Breuer and F. R. S. Yorke. The flats and particularly the Isobar became renowned as a centre for socialist intellectual and artistic life in Hampstead. Regular visitors to the Isobar included nearby residents Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth and Ben Nicholson.

==Espionage==
A number of Isokon residents were later identified as Soviet agents and the building was subject to surveillance by the British security services in the 1930s and during the Cold War period. In the mid-1930s Flat 7 was occupied by Dr Arnold Deutsch, the NKVD agent who recruited the Cambridge Five. Soviet spy Jürgen Kuczynski lived at Isokon while teaching economics at the University of London.

==Post-war years==
The Isokon furniture company ceased trading at the outbreak of World War II but was restarted in 1963. The British architect Sir James Frazer Stirling was a resident during the early 1960s. In 1969 the building was sold to the &quot;New Statesman&quot; magazine and the Isobar was converted into flats. In 1972 the building was sold to Camden London Borough Council and gradually deteriorated until the 1990s when it was abandoned and lay derelict for several years.

==Rescue and refurbishment==
In 2003 the building was sympathetically refurbished by Avanti Architects, a practice which specialises in the renovation of modernist buildings, for the Notting Hill Housing Association which purchased it from Camden London Borough Council. Notting Hill Housing Association remains the freeholder. During the comprehensive restoration, the services were completely renewed, heating and insulation discreetly upgraded and the later overcoat of render removed from the exterior. The building now has a smooth external finish and is the palest tint of pink in colour, as it was originally—not pure white as has been assumed from black and white historical photos. The building is now partly occupied by key workers under a shared-ownership scheme whilst the larger flats have been sold outright.

==Isokon Gallery== 
As part of the refurbishment, an exhibition gallery was created in the former garage, run since 2014 wholly by volunteers as a non-profit micro-museum to tell the story of the building, the social and artistic life of its residents and the Isokon furniture company. The gallery is open weekends only, 11.00 a.m. to 4.00 p.m. from the beginning of March until the end of November. Flats in the Isokon building are private and cannot be visited, except during Open House in September each year.

==Designation==
The building was designated a Grade I listed structure in 1999, placing it amongst the most significant historic buildings in England. An English Heritage blue plaque was fixed in 2018 to commemorate the residence of the Bauhaus masters Gropius, Breuer and Moholy-Nagy.

<doc id="796291" wikidata="Q2894715" url="?curid=796291" title="Timescape">
<text>Timescape is a 1980 science fiction novel by American writer Gregory Benford (with unbilled co-author Hilary Foister, Benford&#x27;s sister-in-law, who is credited as having &quot;contributed significantly to the manuscript&quot;). It won the 1981 Nebula and 1980 British Science Fiction Award, and the 1981 John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel. It won the 1981 Ditmar Award for Best International Fiction. The novel was widely hailed by both critics of science fiction and mainstream literature for its fusion of detailed character development and interpersonal drama with more standard science fiction fare such as time travel and ecological issues.

Pocket Books used the title of this book for their science fiction imprint.

==Plot summary==

The story is written from two viewpoints, equidistant from the novel&#x27;s publication in 1980. The first thread is set in a 1998 ravaged by ecological disasters such as algal blooms and diebacks on the brink of large scale extinctions. Various other events are mentioned in passing, such as student riots and an event of nuclear terrorism against New York City that took place before the events of the novel. This thread follows a group of scientists in the United Kingdom connected with the University of Cambridge and their attempts to warn the past of the impending disaster by sending tachyon-induced messages to the astronomical position the Earth occupied in 1962–1963. Given the faster-than-light nature of the tachyon, these messages will effectively reach the past. These efforts are led by John Renfrew, an Englishman, and Gregory Markham, an American most likely modeled on Benford himself.

The second thread is set at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), in La Jolla, California in 1962, where a young scientist, Gordon Bernstein, discovers anomalous noise in a physics experiment relating to spontaneous resonance and indium antimonide. He and his student assistant, Albert Cooper (also likely based on the author and his experiences at UCSD), discover that the noise is coming in bursts timed to form Morse code.

The resulting message is made of staccato sentence fragments and jumbled letters, due to the 1998 team&#x27;s efforts to avoid a grandfather paradox. Their aim is to give the past researchers enough information to start efforts on solving the pending ecological crisis, but not enough that the crisis will be entirely solved (thus making a signal to the past unnecessary and creating a paradox).
Due to the biological nature of the message, Professor Bernstein shares the message with a professor of biology, Michael Ramsey. Since the message also gives astronomical coordinates, he also shares it with Saul Shriffer, a fictional scientist who is said to have worked with Frank Drake on Project Ozma. Initially, these characters fail to understand the true meaning of the message. Ramsey believes it to be an intercepted military dispatch hinting at Soviet bioterrorism, while Shriffer thinks the message is of extraterrestrial origin. Shriffer goes public with this theory, mentioning Bernstein in his findings. However, Bernstein&#x27;s overseer, Isaac Lakin, is skeptical of the messages and wants Bernstein to keep working on his original project and ignore the signal. As a result of this interruption in their experimentation, Bernstein is denied a promotion and Cooper fails a candidacy examination. The signal also exacerbates difficulties in Bernstein&#x27;s relationship with his girlfriend, Penny.

In 1998, Ian Peterson recovers a safe deposit box in La Jolla containing a piece of paper indicating that the messages were received. Meanwhile, it is clear that the viral nature of the algal bloom is spreading it faster and through more media than originally expected. Strange yellow clouds that have been appearing are said to be a result of the viral material being absorbed through the water cycle, and it soon affects the planet&#x27;s agriculture as well, resulting in widespread cases of food poisoning. Flying to the United States, Markham is killed in a plane crash when the pilots fly too close to one of the clouds and experience seizures.

In the past storyline, now advanced into 1963, Bernstein refuses to give up on the signals. He is rewarded when the signal noise is also observed in a laboratory at Columbia University (a nod towards the inventor of the tachyon concept, Gerald Feinberg of Columbia). Using hints in the message, Ramsey replicates the conditions of the bloom in a controlled experiment and realizes the danger it represents. Bernstein finds out that the astronomical coordinates given in the message represent where the Earth will be in 1998 due to the solar apex. He also receives a more coherent, despairing message from the future. Having built a solid case, Bernstein goes public and publishes his results.

This decision has monumental consequences. On November 22, a high school student in Dallas is sent by his physics teacher to the Texas School Book Depository to get a copy of Bernstein&#x27;s findings. There he interrupts Lee Harvey Oswald&#x27;s assassination attempt on President John F. Kennedy, attacking the shooter and sending the would-be fatal third shot awry. Though seriously injured, Kennedy survives. This paradox creates an alternate universe and forever ends the contact with the original 1998.

The concluding chapters portray the 1998 of the original timeline as a bleak, failing world, the intensified ecological disaster taking a noticeable toll on the human way of life. Peterson retreats to a fortified country farmhouse which he has obviously prepared well in advance. Renfrew continues to send out signals (including the more coherent one that Gordon receives) until the building&#x27;s generator gives out. Before it does, however, he receives a signal purportedly from the year 2349.

In the final chapter, set in the alternate 1974, an awards ceremony is held for achievement in science. In light of Kennedy&#x27;s survival, the United States President giving out the awards is William Scranton, who is said to have defeated Bobby Kennedy due to a telephone tapping scandal. The scientists whose work stemmed from the signal are honored, including Bernstein, who receives the Enrico Fermi Prize for his discovery of the tachyon.

<text>Wells Wintemute Coates (December 17, 1895 – June 17, 1958) was an architect, designer and writer. He was, for most of his life, an expatriate Canadian who is best known for his work in England, the most notable of which is the Modernist block of flats known as the Isokon building in Hampstead, London.

==Early years==
The oldest of six children, Wells Coates was born in Tokyo, Japan, on December 17, 1895, to Methodist missionaries Sarah Agnes Wintemute Coates (1864–1945) and Harper Havelock Coates (1865–1934).

The young man&#x27;s desire to be an architect was inspired by his mother, who had herself studied architecture under Louis Sullivan and planned one of the first missionary schools in Japan.

Coates spent his youth in the Far East, and voyaged around the world with his father in 1913. He served in World War I, first as a gunner and later as a pilot with the Royal Air Force. He attended the University of British Columbia where he obtained a BA degree in May 1920 and a BSc degree in May 1922, and in October 1922 he registered at East London College where he studied engineering (obtaining a PhD in 1924). Among his first jobs in England was as a journalist and then with the design firm of Adams and Thompson in 1924. He established his own firm in 1928.

His childhood experiences in Japan would play an important role in his aesthetic sensibility that he brought to his architectural work, and this sensibility found a fitting outlet in the Modernist Movement, then current in Europe. He attended the 1933 Congrès International d&#x27;Architecture Moderne (CIAM), which produced the famous Athens Charter, and was one of the founders, with Maxwell Fry, of the Modern Architectural Research Group (MARS), the British wing of CIAM.

Between 1932 and 1936 Coates was in partnership with an English architect David Pleydell-Bouverie and designed together the Sunspan House for the 1934 &quot;Daily Mail&quot; Ideal Home Exhibition held at Olympia, London.

==Role as a Modernist==
Wells embraced Le Corbusier&#x27;s architectural mantra that buildings should be &#x27;machines for living&#x27; (&quot;machine à habiter&quot;). This ideal was best-reflected in his Isokon building (also known as Lawn Road Flats), completed in 1934. Indeed, the architectural critic J.M. Richards suggested that he improved on Corbusier, coming &quot;nearer to the &quot;machine à habiter&quot; than anything Corbusier ever designed&quot;. The building was compared to the exterior of an ocean liner by the novelist Agatha Christie, who lived there for a time, so clean and striking was the design.

The apartment building was the brainchild of Jack and Molly Pritchard, who in 1931 established a design firm featuring Modernist architecture and furniture. With simple living spaces strongly influenced by Coates&#x27; Japanese experience, and including built-in Isokon furniture, Isokon was &quot;an experiment in collective housing designed for left-wing intellectuals&quot;. It became a haven for Germans and Hungarians escaping Nazi persecution and hosted many famous personages including Agatha Christie, Walter Gropius, László Moholy-Nagy, and Marcel Breuer.

Isokon was ahead of its time: it won second place in &quot;Horizon Magazine&#x27;s&quot; &#x27;Ugliest Building Competition&#x27; in 1946, and would not be recognized as one of England&#x27;s most important Modernist buildings for another decade. The building fell into disrepair by the 1990s but it changed ownership in 2001 and was fully restored by 2004.

==Later achievements==
An inventive genius, Coates revelled in introducing new ideas in his work. Among his innovations was the &#x27;3-2&#x27; architectural plan, where two living rooms on one side of the building are equivalent in height to three rooms on the other side, making two units vertically on three floors. in 1928, he designed the &quot;D-handle&quot;, an elegantly simple door handle design commonly employed, for example, in Scandinavian furniture. In 1930 he also designed a studio for the British Broadcasting Corporation, and among his technical designs was a microphone stand featuring an overhead counterbalanced arm that enabled the microphone to be moved to any part of the studio while remaining perfectly balanced. The design became a standard piece of equipment at the BBC. Coates also designed the distinctive and influential round bakelite cabinets used by EKCO for some of its radios during the 1930s. Featured in the V&amp;A permanent collection, the Museum notes of the design of Model AD-65: &quot;the severe geometric shape defined the visual vocabulary of radio design for many years&quot;.

The thirties were his most prolific era. The Isokon was immediately followed by Embassy Court in Brighton (1935) and 10 Palace Gate, Kensington (1939). These were the only apartment buildings he would design. He also had several private home commissions.

During World War II, he again served with the RAF, this time working on fighter aircraft development, for which he was later awarded an OBE. Following the war, he, like some other well known architects including Gropius and Breuer (by then working in America), contributed to the British post-War housing effort by introducing an early scheme for modular housing he called Room Unit Production.

In 1949-50, he designed the building of the Telekinema for the Festival of Britain&#x27;s South Bank Exhibition. This 400-seat, state-of-the-art cinema, specially designed to screen both film (including the first 3-dimensional films) and large-screen television, proved one of the most popular attractions of the South Bank Exhibition in the summer of 1951. Operated and programmed by the British Film Institute, it re-opened as the National Film Theatre in October 1952, until its demolition in 1957 as the NFT was relocated a stone&#x27;s throw away from its original site, under Waterloo Bridge.
He also designed a remarkable boat, called the Wingsail. It had a rigid sail design mounted on a catamaran hull. Though he formed a company to market the design, it was not a success, as both the sail and the catamaran were ahead of their time.

He is less well known for his planning work. In 1937, he undertook planning for a slum clearance in Britain (not implemented). In Canada (1952–54) he prepared plans for Iroquois New Town on the St. Lawrence River in eastern Ontario which were also not implemented (the design was awarded to others). He also prepared plans for a Toronto Island Redevelopment Project, and was a participant in the &quot;Project 58&quot; urban redevelopment scheme for Vancouver.

==Final years in Canada==
Coates began coming back to Canada in the early 1950s, about the time of the Iroquois project, finally settling there in 1957. In 1955 and 1956, he taught at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard with Walter Gropius but he was not happy there. He returned to Vancouver after two years, where he worked on Project 58. His last assignment was to design a monorail rapid transit system for Vancouver, dubbed the Monospan Twin-Ride System (MTRS). Once again, he was ahead of his time. The project was abandoned, but would be rejuvenated years later in another form known as SkyTrain.

Wells Coates died of a heart attack in Vancouver on June 17, 1958, at the age of 62. Coates was married to Marion Grove in 1927. They had one child, Laura, and separated in 1937. Coates&#x27; grandson is Matt Black of the electronic music duo Coldcut.

<doc id="796318" wikidata="Q1654666" url="?curid=796318" title="Cobb County International Airport">
<text>Cobb County International Airport - McCollum Field is a public airport located northwest of the central business district of Atlanta, immediately south of the city of Kennesaw in Cobb County, Georgia, United States. It operates 24 hours per day, although it is not controlled between the hours of midnight and 6:00 a.m. (EST/EDT). It is also designated as a weather station.

The airport is located on of land, has one runway which is long, and is east–west oriented, with headings of 089 and 269. Cobb Place is at the east end, with Cobb Parkway (U.S. 41) and old 41 intersecting McCollum Parkway on the west end. The airfield sits at above mean sea level somewhat above average terrain for the area. The airport has a control tower. The airport also has a restaurant built directly beside the runway called Elevation Chophouse &amp; Skybar; patrons can watch aircraft take off and land from their tables.

The airport has approximately 321 aircraft based there at the end of December 2021: 212 single engine, 35 multi-engine, 61 jet aircraft, 11 helicopters, and 2 glider. 82 percent of operations are general aviation, 16 percent is air taxi, and 2 percent is military. No major commercial airlines service Cobb County Airport, but there are two charter companies and two major fixed-base operators. Aerial tours are very popular at the airport, largely because the scenic Appalachian Mountains are less than a 30-minute flight away.

McCollum Field is owned by Cobb County, operated by the County Department of Transportation, characterizing it as a municipal airport. It is managed by a full-time, professional airport manager. The airport employs almost 185 people, and had an annual economic impact of more than US$47 million to the local economy in 2002.

== History ==
McCollum Field opened in 1960 with a single runway. There was a stub taxiway connecting the runway with the ramp area, of aprons, and a single administration building. The airport steadily grew over the next 30 years with the greatest developments occurring in the early 1990s.

In 1991, the airport layout plan was first revised. The first full service fixed-base operator opened in 1992. A second full service fixed-base operator opened a year later. That same year, the Georgia State Patrol Hangar was constructed. The Air Traffic Control Tower was opened in 1995, followed by an Instrument Landing System glide slope the next year. Over the course of the decade, there were four major purchases of new land at a total cost of US$3.8 million in grants and an unspecified amount in local funds. In addition, 6 new hangars were built.

McCollum Field was first designed as a small field for general aviation. It is designated as a reliever airport for Hartsfield-Jackson Airport and DeKalb-Peachtree Airport. Cobb County is also the primary general aviation airport for the Atlanta suburban population. As of 2006, it is the third most trafficked airport in Georgia with an average of 475 takeoffs and landings each day.

===2008 runway===
On December 4, 2008, the new wide concrete runway was opened at 13:00 local time. The runway took 23 days to complete. During the runway construction of RWY &quot;9-27&quot; taxiway &quot;A&quot; was made temporary runway &quot;8-26&quot;.

<doc id="796333" wikidata="Q5623667" url="?curid=796333" title="Gwinnett County Airport">
<text>Gwinnett County Airport at Briscoe Field is a municipal airport located about two miles (3 km) northeast of Lawrenceville, Georgia and about 30 miles northeast of Downtown Atlanta. It is owned and operated by the Gwinnett County, in northeastern metro Atlanta.

It has a runway, and is above mean sea level (AMSL). Student training is conducted at the airport by several different flight schools, including ATP Flight School. Two fixed-base operators (FBOs), Landmark (north ramp) and Aircraft Specialists (south ramp), serve the field with facilities, passenger lounges, and fuel. Georgia Jet operates the largest air charter fleet in the Atlanta area from Briscoe Field, transporting passengers nationally and internationally, more than 10 million passenger miles per year. ImagineAir, an air taxi company, is based at the airport. Medway Air Ambulance and Care Medflight operate medical transport services. Its Airport Minimum Standards for Operation were rewritten in 2006.

== Facilities and aircraft ==
Gwinnett County–Briscoe Field covers an area of which contains one asphalt-paved runway designated 7/25 which measures .

For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2018, the airport had 82,895 aircraft operations, an average of 227 per day: 98% general aviation and 1% military. There were 80 aircraft based at the time at this airport: 58 single-engine, 11 multi-engine, 7 jet and 4 helicopter. There is currently no commercial service out of LZU. The closest airport offering passenger flights would be ATL located 42 miles to the southwest of LZU.

==Privatization==
In May 2010 the FAA gave preliminary approval to a plan to privatize the airport. This allowed Gwinnett County to further study plans on a possible sale of the airport to private investors. New York-based Propeller Investments offered to buy Briscoe Field and upgrade it with a ten-gate terminal to attract more scheduled airline services and build a runway capable of accommodating planes as large as 737s. Atlanta&#x27;s dominant airline, Delta, lobbied against the proposal due to its reluctance to split operations between Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport and Briscoe Field, even though two US carriers, Allegiant and Sun Country Airlines, do not yet offer service to Atlanta.

In June 2012, the county&#x27;s Board of Commissioners canceled the privatization plan, amid local opposition to initiating commercial passenger service from the airport. The Board claims that it would not have been a suitable location for an airport due to the already widespread development around Briscoe, which would also have limited future expansion plans. They also raised the issue of distance, claiming that it was &quot;too far away from metro Atlanta’s main population base&quot;, citing industry experts who said &quot;most travelers would continue to utilize Hartsfield-Jackson over Briscoe because it would offer more flights, more destinations, and better ticket pricing&quot;. They also characterized Propeller Investments as a startup company without airport operations experience.

<text>Canada Now (more formally CBC News: Canada Now) was the early-evening national news program on CBC Television, the main English television network of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, between 2000 and 2007. For most of its run, it was structured as a hybrid national-regional newscast, with each portion being 30 minutes in length.

==History==
The program was created to replace the regular supper-hour newscasts on the CBC&#x27;s owned-and-operated local television stations in 2000, as a result of cuts to the CBC&#x27;s budget. While initially thought to be a national newscast with limited local inserts, it was later revealed that the program would cover both local and national news as an hour-long newscast divided into two thirty-minute sub-programs. One was national in scope, anchored by Ian Hanomansing at the network&#x27;s Vancouver studio; the other was regional, varying from station to station, and presented by the stations&#x27; local anchors as with the previous local newscasts. Some of the regional portions were also seen on the CBC&#x27;s digital specialty channel Country Canada.

The national half of &quot;Canada Now&quot; was also broadcast on CBC Newsworld, and was paired with a half-hour current affairs program (which shared the &quot;Canada Now&quot; title) hosted by Kathleen Petty in Calgary; the Calgary-produced segment was canceled after Petty left for CBC Ottawa. Due to the unique circumstances of the Canadian territories, CBC North did not broadcast the national portion, and continued its own separate newscast, &quot;CBC News: Northbeat&quot;. CBC&#x27;s privately owned affiliates were not affected by the budget cut, and continued producing their own local newscasts; most of the privately owned affiliates did not broadcast &quot;Canada Now&quot;.

By 2005, the corporation began taking tentative steps towards expanding local news programming, with CBNT in St. John&#x27;s reinstating a full-hour newscast in November under its pre-2000 title, &quot;Here and Now.&quot; CBC made further changes to the early evening news slot in early 2006, with the return of separate local 30-minute newscasts (titled &quot;CBC News at Six (province or city name)&quot;) in most markets; &quot;Canada Now&quot; was reformatted as a half-hour program focussed on national and international news shown at 6:30pm. (The original &quot;Canada Now&quot; format and name continued to be used for the integrated local/national newscast aired on CBUT in Vancouver.)

On November 30, 2006, CBC Television announced that it would cancel &quot;Canada Now&quot; and expand the local &quot;CBC News at Six&quot; broadcasts to a full hour in the coming year, thereby reverting to the pre-2000 early-evening news model. &quot;Canada Now&quot; was last broadcast on February 16, 2007, replaced by the newly expanded &quot;CBC News at Six&quot; broadcasts on February 19. Ian Hanomansing was reassigned to co-host the new Vancouver local news program on CBUT, which briefly retained the &quot;Canada Now&quot; title before it was renamed &quot;CBC News: Vancouver&quot; in July 2007.

<doc id="796350" wikidata="Q1170049" url="?curid=796350" title="Chasing Vermeer">
<text>Chasing Vermeer is a 2004 children&#x27;s art mystery novel written by Blue Balliett and illustrated by Brett Helquist. Set in Hyde Park, Chicago near the University of Chicago, the novel follows two children, Calder Pillay and Petra Andalee. After a famous Johannes Vermeer painting, &quot;A Lady Writing&quot;, is stolen &quot;en route&quot; to the Art Institute of Chicago, Calder and Petra work together to try to recover it. The thief publishes many advertisements in the newspaper, explaining that he will give the painting back if the community can discover which paintings under Vermeer&#x27;s name were really painted by him. This causes Petra, Calder, and the rest of Hyde Park to examine art more closely. Themes of art, chance, coincidence, deception, and problem-solving are apparent.

The novel was written for Balliett&#x27;s classroom intended to deal with real-world issues. Balliett values children&#x27;s ideas and wrote the book specifically to highlight that. &quot;Chasing Vermeer&quot; has won several awards, including the Edgar and the Agatha. In 2006, the sequel entitled &quot;The Wright 3&quot; was published, followed by &quot;The Calder Game&quot; in 2008.

==Inspiration and origin==
&quot;Chasing Vermeer&quot; is Blue Balliett&#x27;s first published book. Its original purpose was a book to read to her class for fun. She realized that a mystery about &quot;real&quot; art issues had not been written since E.L. Konigsburg&#x27;s 1967 novel &quot;From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler&quot;, and desired to write what she wished to read. &quot;Chasing Vermeer&quot; took about five years to write, as Balliett was also a teacher and parent. She compared writing the book to weaving, as she first wrote mainly about art, but then incorporated the pentominoes and classroom scenes, creating many different levels to read on. She admits that it ended up more complex than she had thought it would be.

Balliett used art and blank plates as inspiration for the characters&#x27; names. Calder Pillay is derived from the artist Alexander Calder and Petra Andalee was inspired by the architecture in Petra, Jordan. The names were meant to be different, which Balliett considered &quot;fun for a child.&quot; Balliett felt that she could capture the attention of reluctant readers if they related to characters who enjoyed writing and math. Calder and Petra&#x27;s teacher, Ms. Hussey, was inspired by an old name on Nantucket Island and the old-fashioned word . Balliett compares herself to Ms. Hussey, stating that &quot;[we] think a lot alike.&quot; Some of Ms. Hussey&#x27;s assignments and dialogue even came from Balliett&#x27;s classroom. She chose the setting of Hyde Park, Chicago, where she currently lives, because she considered it full of secrets that children could discover.

==Plot summary==
The story begins with three residents of Hyde Park receiving anonymous letters. The letters ask for the recipients&#x27; help in solving a centuries-old art mystery. In the days that follow, Petra and Calder&#x27;s teacher, Ms. Isabel Hussey, gives several assignments related to unique letters and letters found in works of art.

One day after school, Calder follows Petra to Powell&#x27;s Bookstore, and the pair run into each other, beginning their unusual friendship. Calder is obsessed with pentominoes that he keeps in his pocket and uses to send and receive coded messages, while Petra is an adventurer.

Ms. Hussey&#x27;s next assignment requires the children to present their interpretation of art. Calder chooses a geographer&#x27;s box with a painting on it. Petra chooses &quot;Lo!&quot; by Charles Fort, a strange book in which Fort posits that life is not a series of coincidences but is an interconnecting web of patterns.

Calder and Petra learn that &quot;Lo!&quot; used to belong to Mrs. Louise Coffin Sharpe. Calder visits Mrs. Sharpe and notices she has a copy of the picture from his geography box, &quot;The Geographer&quot; by Johannes Vermeer. Meanwhile, Petra has a vision of a lady in an antiquated dress with pearl earrings. For Halloween, she dresses as the lady, and Calder recognizes her as the woman in Vermeer&#x27;s painting, &quot;A Lady Writing&quot;.

&quot;A Lady Writing&quot; is on its way from the National Gallery to an exhibit in Chicago. Before the painting arrives, it is stolen. The thief sends a letter to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; stating that he has stolen the painting to raise awareness that someone else painted some of Vermeer&#x27;s paintings. The thief claims that once the art world has repudiated the authenticity of the paintings, he will return &quot;A Lady Writing&quot;.

The children learn that Ms. Hussey received one of the letters and begin to suspect that the painting is somewhere on school grounds. Calder has an epiphany, connecting himself and Petra with the number 12. This clue leads them to the painting. On exiting the school, the thief begins chasing them, and Calder stays behind, urging Petra to run on with the painting. Petra and a policeman return to the playground where she last saw Calder. While they are searching, the thief takes the painting out of the patrol car.

Back home, Petra finds Calder unconscious with the painting under his arm in her neighbor&#x27;s treehouse. Calder had hit his head in the altercation. He pretended to be unconscious, then followed the thief to the treehouse, where he found the painting and succumbed to his concussion.

Amid these events, Calder&#x27;s friend, Tommy Segovia, writes that his stepfather has abandoned the family in New York, where they recently moved. The thief, later found dead of a heart attack, was Xavier Glitts. Glitts had married Tommy&#x27;s mother, using the pseudonym of Old Fred, to infiltrate the community. This allowed him to case the university and identify local Vermeer enthusiasts, whom he could later implicate.

==Genre==
&quot;Chasing Vermeer&quot; is classified in the mystery genre, although it was described by Liz Szabla of Scholastic as &quot;a puzzle, wrapped in a mystery, disguised as an adventure, and delivered as a work of art.&quot; Scholastic&#x27;s teaching website additionally added suspense due to the surprise ending.

==Themes==
Some of Balliett&#x27;s &quot;real-world ideas&quot; in &quot;Chasing Vermeer&quot; were &quot;Do coincidences mean anything?&quot; and &quot;What is art and what makes it valuable?&quot; Balliett says her &quot;central message&quot; is &quot;kids are powerful thinkers, and their ideas are valuable, and that adults don&#x27;t have all the answers.&quot;

A book by Rita Soltan entitled &quot;Reading Raps: A Book Club Guide for Librarians, Kids, and Families&quot; analyzed &quot;Chasing Vermeer&quot;&#x27;s themes as follows:
Deception and problem-solving are central themes in this novel as both the thief and the central adult players use a variety of ways to hide the truth while the children employ a series of mathematical and problem-solving concepts to piece together the clues to the puzzle. In addition, Calder and Petra develop a special friendship and certain respect for the value of art.

As the thief gains publicity by challenging the community to figure out which paintings claimed to be Vermeer&#x27;s were indeed painted by him, everyone starts to look at the depth in art. Sondra Eklund, who writes a book review blog, noted that the reader was left with the impression to study Vermeer&#x27;s paintings and art more closely. In the book, Ms. Hussey challenges her class to the question, &quot;What is art?&quot;

Other themes include chance and coincidence. During &quot;Chasing Vermeer&quot;, Charles Fort&#x27;s book, &quot;Lo!&quot;, inspires the children to list and pay attention to coincidences as they realize that they are more than what they seem and explore the concept that they make up one unexplained pattern. Balliett stated that she wanted to convey how coincidences were noticeable and felt meaningful, and how they could matter even if they were unexplainable.

==Audiobook==
The audiobook for &quot;Chasing Vermeer&quot;, read by Ellen Reilly, was released on November 27, 2007 from Listening Library. It runs about 4 hours and 47 minutes. &quot;AudioFile&quot; magazine praised Reilly&#x27;s voices and pace, but noted that, &quot;Once the mystery is solved, however, the ending seems tacked on, falling flat.&quot;

==Critical reception==
&quot;Chasing Vermeer&quot; received generally positive reviews. &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the description and mystery. It was also listed as one of their &quot;Notable Books of 2004&quot;. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; awarded it a starred review with the consensus that &quot;Art, intrigue, and plenty of twists and turns make this art mystery a great read.&quot; &quot;Children&#x27;s Literature&quot; reviewer Claudia Mills gave generally positive comments, calling the novel &quot;engrossing and engaging&quot;. The website Kidsreads well-loved children&#x27;s books. It&#x27;s that good.&quot; A reviewer of &quot;The Trades&quot; website called it &quot;an entertaining read that manages to serve several purposes in one concise novel&quot; and found the characters &quot;unusual yet likable&quot;, but felt that &quot;the disappointing bit of this novel is that the solutions always arrive through a series of disconnected events that just lead the kids to think in certain ways.&quot; Kadon Enterprises, a game puzzle company, reviewed the book, praising the writing style and puzzles.

===Awards===
==Film==
Warner Brothers bought the rights to a film of &quot;Chasing Vermeer&quot; in June 2004 and Brad Pitt&#x27;s production company Plan B Entertainment planned to produce it. P.J. Hogan was slated as director and the novel was adapted by Matt Nix. However, when asked about the film in August 2010, Balliett answered,
&quot;It’s been fascinating, watching this whole process, because Plan B did a wonderful job. They went through two screenwriters, and they’ve gone through two directors. It’s sort of like a house of cards. I have rights again. If they get it all together again, they’ll jump on it. But they don’t have exclusive rights anymore.&quot;

<text>The Simplon Pass (; ; ; ; ; ) is a high mountain pass between the Pennine Alps and the Lepontine Alps in Switzerland. It connects Brig in the canton of Valais with Domodossola in Piedmont (Italy). The pass itself and the villages on each side of it, such as Gondo, are in Switzerland. The Simplon Tunnel was built beneath the vicinity of the pass in the early 20th century to carry rail traffic between the two countries.

The lowest point of the col, and the lowest point on the watershed between the basins of the Rhone and the Po in Switzerland lies in marshland about west of the Simplon Pass settlement at an altitude of .

Rotelsee is a lake located near the pass at an elevation of .

There are several high peaks around that can be climbed directly from the pass. These include Wasenhorn, Hubschhorn, Breithorn (Simplon), and Monte Leone.

==History==
There had been a locally used passage through the mountains here for several centuries, but the pass acquired international significance during the Napoleonic occupation. Between 1801 and 1805 the Simplon Road was constructed by the engineer Nicolas Céard at the direction of the emperor in order to transport artillery pieces through the pass between the Rhône valley and Italy. Since then, the pass has been usable by road vehicles: first post carriages, replaced early in the twentieth century by post buses.

The road was periodically improved and in 1950 the cantonal authorities created a plan whereby the pass could be kept open all through the year, and not closed to traffic between October and late April, like most Alpine passes at this altitude. The improvements included several lengthy avalanche shelters along the more exposed stretches of road and the expansion of certain road tunnels to accommodate full size tourist coaches which were significantly taller than the post buses used for local passengers. In October 1970, a party of journalists was invited to inspect the improvements and it was announced that the necessary improvements had been implemented on of the between Brig in Valais and the Italian frontier at Gondo, that 110 of the 180 million Swiss francs budgeted to the project had been spent and that, while a further five years would be needed to complete all the projected improvements, the Simplon Pass could now be used safely all through the year. The former Simplon département (the Swiss canton Valais) was named after the pass.

The Simplon Pass was also outfitted with rails for train service. The -long Simplon Tunnel was opened in 1906. The historic Orient Express used the Simplon route intermittently during the twentieth century, as it carried passengers between Istanbul and Paris.

The &quot;Hospice du Simplon&quot;, at the top of the pass, is owned by the Congregation of Canons Regular at Grand-Saint-Bernard.

==Monuments==

During the Second World War, officers of the 11th Alpine Brigade of the Swiss Army, based in Zwischbergen, proposed the construction of the stone monument depicting an eagle, the symbol of the brigade. The Bernese architect Erwin Friedrich Baumann designed the monument based on the use of granite blocks from the old fortification of Gondo (a town near the pass) to build a statue about nine meters high. The monument was inaugurated in September 1944.

In 2005, a memorial was built representing the 200th anniversary of the construction of the &quot;Napoleon Road&quot;.

<doc id="796355" wikidata="Q1516834" url="?curid=796355" title="Smith &amp; Wesson Model 29">
<text>The Smith &amp; Wesson Model 29 is a six-shot, double-action revolver chambered for the .44 Magnum cartridge and manufactured by the United States company Smith &amp; Wesson.

The Model 29 was offered with barrels as standard models. Other barrel lengths were available either by special order from Smith &amp; Wesson&#x27;s Custom Shop or custom built by gunsmiths. The barreled variant had a full-length underlug. Finish options available included a highly polished blued or nickel-plated surface.

At the time of its introduction, the Model 29 was the most powerful production handgun, although it was later overtaken by handguns chambered for the even larger .454 Casull, .50 Action Express, and .500 S&amp;W Magnum cartridges. It was made famous worldwide by association with the fictional character &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; Callahan.

== Design ==
The Model 29 will chamber and fire .44 Special and .44 Russian cartridges, as the .44 Magnum was developed from the .44 Special and the .44 Special was developed from the .44 Russian. The Magnum case is slightly longer to prevent magnum rounds from being chambered and fired in handguns chambered for the .44 Special.

== History ==
Elmer Keith&#x27;s achievements in maximizing the power and performance of the .44 Special was the inspiration and driving force behind the introduction of the .44 Magnum by Smith &amp; Wesson. His intention for the new round was for it to be used in sidearms for hunters of large, dangerous game, rather than for self-defense, though with today&#x27;s specialty cartridges, it can be a good defensive round.

S&amp;W&#x27;s production of a large N-frame revolver in .44 Magnum began in 1955; the Model 29 designation was applied in 1957. At the time of its introduction, the Model 29 was the most powerful production handgun. There were a number of custom calibers that were more powerful, as in the old Howdah pistols of the 19th century.

It remained primarily the province of some handgun enthusiasts, law enforcement personnel, and hunters until 1971, when Clint Eastwood made it famous as &quot;the most powerful handgun in the world&quot; in the movie &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;. After the release of the movie and its sequels, retailers had difficulty keeping the Model 29 in stock.

In the late 1990s, Smith &amp; Wesson discontinued production of many models of revolvers, including the &quot;basic&quot; Model 29; since then, at various times, the model, in limited or &quot;custom&quot; configurations, has been manufactured in as many as 10 evolutions.

== Variants ==
The original Model 29 was superseded by the Model 29–1 in 1960, with modifications made to the ejector-rod screw. The Model 29-2 replaced it the following year, with one screw that had secured the cylinder-stop spring being deleted. The barrel length was shortened from in 1979. These two versions are known as &quot;pinned and recessed&quot;. &quot;Pinned&quot; means that the barrels are screwed in and secured by a pin driven through the frame and a notch in the barrel. &quot;Recessed&quot; denotes the rear of the bored cylinder holes being countersunk, so that, when loaded, the cartridge rims are fully enclosed by the cylinder. In 1982, the cost-cutting Model 29-3 dropped recessed cylinders and pinned barrels for crush-fit barrels.

The -4 and -5, produced from 1988 and 1990, respectively had changes to improve durability for heavy use. In 1994, the 29-6 began production, now fitted as standard with rubber Monogrips from Hogue to replace the previous wooden items, standard tapped holes also being provided for attaching scope mounts. The 29-7 started production in 1998 with changes to the locking mechanism, the firing pin&#x27;s attachment, and a hammer and trigger produced with a metal injection molding process.

=== Model 629 ===
Introduced in 1978, the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 629 is a stainless steel version of the Model 29. The 629 model designation derives from Smith &amp; Wesson&#x27;s practice of denoting a stainless steel version of one of their already existing designs by placing a 6 in front of the model number of the original weapon. The 629 Classic variant features a full-length barrel underlug, other variants include the 629 Stealth Hunter.

=== Quiet Special Purpose Revolver ===
Some S&amp;W model 29s were rebuilt by the AAI Corporation to make the Quiet Special Purpose Revolvers (QSPR). These had a new, short, smoothbore barrel length of , with an overall length of , and a bore, in addition to having the cylinder chambers reamed to accept the special QSPR ammunition which externally resembled metal-cased .410-bore shotgun shells, but internally worked as a piston to trap the gases.

This pistol was developed from 1967 to 1972 to be used by tunnel rats in the Vietnam War. The QSPR was tested on the battlefield in 1969, and an improvement and testing program ran from 1969 to 1972. It never officially entered service. The US withdrawal from Vietnam reduced interest in the QSPR weapon, and the program ended in 1972 although unsubstantiated rumors claim the QSPR may have been used by CIA assassins during the Cold War and continues to be used by so-called &quot;Black Book teams&quot;.

A Russian handgun introduced in 2002, the OTs-38 Stechkin silent revolver, is described as using a system virtually identical to the QSPR.

=== Mountain Gun Variation ===
The Mountain Gun was introduced in 1989 as a lightweight version of the Model 29 designed to be &quot;carried often and shot little&quot;. The barrel profile is a reprise of the original design. Early version 29-4 backpacker with 2.5&quot; barrel (very rare).

A Smith &amp; Wesson Model 629 with a 3&quot; barrel called the &quot;Trail Boss&quot; was produced for the distributor, RSR.

=== Other variants ===
* In 1985, Smith and Wesson issued the Model 29-3 Elmer Keith Commemorative Edition in 2,500 units. In 1986, it issued 100 deluxe versions of the commemorative, with an acid-etched portrait of Keith and his signature in gold. 
* On January 26, 2006, Smith &amp; Wesson announced the 50th Anniversary Model 29. Identical to the previous models except for the gold inlaid trademark on the side cover, the new internal lock mechanism, and a non-fluted cylinder.
* On January 1, 2007, Smith &amp; Wesson announced the reissue of the Model 29 as an engraved model in S&amp;W&#x27;s Classics line.
* The Smith &amp; Wesson Model 629 Stealth Hunter has a ported barrel with a full-length under lug for increased stability and recoil reduction. The barrel-cylinder gap is , with a ball-detent lockup between the frame and cylinder crane that provides increased strength. The entire revolver is made of a stainless steel, with a glare-reducing matte black finish. It comes with slip-resistant synthetic grips.
* The 329NG is a scandium-framed revolver with PVD-coated cylinder and tritium sights. It is part of the NightGuard line.

<doc id="796361" wikidata="Q351346" url="?curid=796361" title="Chief warrant officer">
<text>Chief Warrant officer is a senior warrant officer rank, used in many countries.

== Canadian Armed Forces ==
In the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF), a chief warrant officer or CWO is the most senior non-commissioned member (NCM) rank for army and air force personnel. Its equivalent rank for navy personnel is chief petty officer 1st class (CPO1). The French language form of chief warrant officer is .

A CWO is senior to the rank of master warrant officer (MWO) and its navy equivalent of chief petty officer 2nd class (CPO2).
===Insignia===
The rank insignia of the CWO is a simplified version of the 1957 coat of arms of Canada, worn on both forearms of the service dress tunic; in gold metal and green enamel miniature pins on the collar of the service dress shirt and outerwear coats (army only); on CADPAT ranks worn in the middle of the chest, embroidered in tan (army) or blue (air force) thread; and in pearl-grey thread on blue slip-ons on both shoulders of other uniforms (air force only).

The insignia lacks the annulus, from 1985 changes, behind the shield bearing the motto of the Order of Canada. It also differs from both the 1957 and 1985 versions through a lack of compartment and mantling.

===Forms of address===
CWOs are generally initially addressed as &quot;Chief Warrant Officer&quot;, and thereafter as &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Ma&#x27;am&quot; by subordinates; and as Mr. or Ms. by commissioned officers. If they hold the appointment of regimental sergeant major, they may also be addressed as &quot;RSM&quot; by the commanding officer, other officers, or when referred to in conversation. CWOs are never addressed as &quot;Chief&quot;, this being a form of address reserved for chief petty officers. Civilians can address them as &quot;Chief Warrant Officer&quot;, &quot;CWO&quot;, or &quot;Mr/Mrs/Miss/Ms&quot; (followed by surname).

===Key positions===
CWO/CPO1 may fulfill roles in a number of key positions. These positions require the incumbent to act in an advisory or liaison role to a non-command position such as assistant Assistant Judge Advocate General Liaison Chief Petty Officer, Corps Sergeant-Major, or Defence Ethics Program Chief Warrant Officer, for example.

===Appointments===
CWOs may hold a number of appointments, some of which are:
* Regimental sergeant major (RSM) the most senior NCO in a battalion-sized army unit, including armoured, combat engineer, and signal regiments.
* Squadron warrant officer (SWO) the most senior NCO in a squadron-sized air force units and army signal units
* School chief warrant officers/chief petty officers (SCWO/SCPO) the most senior NCO in air force, navy and some army schools of battalion or squadron size.
* Base or wing chief warrant officer/chief petty officer the most senior NCO on a Canadian Forces base or wing establishment
* Fleet chief petty officer the most senior NCO in either Atlantic Fleet, Pacific Fleet, or Naval Reserve
* Ship&#x27;s coxswain the most senior NCO on a Royal Canadian Navy ship (fulfilled by a chief petty officer 2nd class or petty officer 1st class for smaller vessels)

Due to the unified nature of the Canadian Armed Forces, it is not unheard-of for air force CWOs or even navy CPO1s especially those of the so-called &quot;purple trades&quot;, such as logistics or military police to find themselves filling the appointment of RSM in what are otherwise considered Canadian Army units (such as service battalions or communication regiments). Conversely, it is not impossible for an army CWO or navy CPO1 to be the squadron CWO of a Royal Canadian Air Force squadron.

===Senior appointments===
Senior appointments for chief warrant officers and chief petty officers 1st class entitle the incumbents to wear a modified rank badge or an addition to the rank badge. They are as follows:

====Formation chief warrant officer====
The coat of arms over the central insignia of the badge of the Canadian Armed Forces (crossed swords, an anchor and an eagle in flight). This appointment is given to CWO assigned to commanders at the base, brigade, wing, and division levels. Specific examples include base chief warrant officer, brigade sergeants-major, wing chief warrant officers, the division chief warrant officer (DCWO) of 1 Canadian Air Division and the division sergeant-major (Div SM) of 3rd Canadian Division (3 Cdn Div). A formation chief warrant officer would typically be seen with a colonel or brigadier-general, but may occasionally be seen with a lieutenant-colonel or major-general.
====Command chief warrant officer/chief petty officer (CCWO/CCPO)====
The coat of arms with a wreath of laurel wrapped around the base. This appointment is given to CWO/CPO1 assigned to commanders of commands including to the commander Canadian Special Operations Forces Command, commander Canadian Forces Intelligence Command and commander Canadian Joint Operations Command. The command chief warrant officer appointed to the commander Canadian Army is called the Canadian Army sergeant-major, while the command chief warrant officer appointed to commander RCAF is known as Chief Warrant Officer of the Air Force. The command chief warrant officer of the RCN is known as the RCN Command Chief Petty Officer. A command chief warrant officer/chief petty officer would be seen with a major-general/rear-admiral or lieutenant-general/vice-admiral.
====Canadian Forces chief warrant officer (CFCWO)====
===Messes and quarters===
CWOs generally mess and billet with other warrant officers and with sergeants, and their navy equivalents, chief petty officers and petty officers. Their mess on military bases or installations are generally named the &quot;Warrant Officers and Sergeants Mess&quot;.

===Uniforms===
Although NCMs, CWOs generally wear the uniform accoutrements of commissioned officers; for example, officer cap badge, waistcoat instead of cummerbund with mess dress, etc.

== South African Armed Forces ==
In 2008 the Warrant Officer ranks of the South African National Defence Force were expanded and the rank of Chief Warrant Officer was created.
In the South African Navy a Chief Warrant Officer is the senior NCO in Fleet Command. In the South African Army the equivalent is the senior NCO in an Army Formation, such as Armour, Infantry etc.

==United States Armed Forces==


Chief warrant officer in the United States Armed Forces refers to any warrant officer in pay grades CW2 and above. All warrant officers (WO1 to CWO5) are officers and rate a salute by all enlisted NATO other ranks personnel. The U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps use WO1/WO through CW5/CWO5 as designators and the U.S. Navy uses WO1 for one specialty (cyber warfare); all other branches of the U.S. Armed Forces use CWO2 through CWO5. The U.S. Air Force, although authorized to appoint warrant officers, does not utilize those grades in any capacity. All warrant officers dine in the officers&#x27; mess but rate just below O-1 (NATO rank code OF-1).

On 4 June 2018, the Chief of Naval Operations announced the reestablishment of the rank of warrant officer one (pay grade W-1), for cyber warrant officers, and solicited applications for the rank/grade. These warrant officers will receive their appointment via warrant and not via commission. They will incur a six-year service obligation once promoted to W-1. A minimum of three-years in grade with a total service time of 12 years must be achieved before appointment and commission to chief warrant officer (W-2). However, the President also may grant appointments of warrant officers in the grade of W-1 via commission at any time as well as the Secretary of the Navy may also appoint warrant officers in that grade via commission, through additional regulations. In mid-December 2018, the Navy announced that six selectees had been named. They will wear a distinctive cap badge with two crossed anchors.

Warrant officer rank insignia is the only officers&#x27; insignia that is not the same for all branches of the U.S. military, with one exception. The rank insignia for a CW5 became the only universal insignia within the warrant officer ranks when the U.S. Navy promoted its first CWO5 in 2002 and the Army adopted the emblem in 2004.

Warrant officers in the United States are classified as officers and are in the &quot;W&quot; category (NATO &quot;WO&quot;); they are technical leaders and specialists. Chief warrant officers are commissioned by the president of the United States and take the same oath as regular commissioned officers do. They may be technical experts with a long service as enlisted personnel or direct entrants, most notably as U.S. Army helicopter pilots.

<doc id="796363" wikidata="Q3492335" url="?curid=796363" title="Southfields">
<text>Southfields is a district of inner London located within the London Borough of Wandsworth, England, 5.6 miles (9 km) south-west of Charing Cross. Southfields is mainly residential, historically a part of Wandsworth itself, and is divided between the SW18 and SW19 postcode areas.

==History==

Until the late 19th century Southfields was still fields, situated between the more developed villages of Wimbledon and Putney. Several of the former pathways through the fields form the routes of parts of today&#x27;s road system, in particular Wimbledon Park Road and its continuation through Southfields Passage, which was the field path from Wimbledon to Wandsworth, Kimber Road and The Baulk, both of which were field paths and can be seen on old maps of the area.
When the District &amp; London &amp; South Western Railway from Wimbledon to Putney Bridge opened in June 1889, the area started to take off, with the first school opening a year later on Merton Road, another of the main thoroughfares that were formerly paths through fields.

The area, like others around it, has undergone significant change in the last few decades, with house prices rising accordingly. The history of Southfields has been researched and documented in Neil Robson&#x27;s 1999 book &quot;Roomy Villas&quot;.

The main residential areas of Southfields are the &quot;Southfields Triangle&quot; and &quot;The Grid&quot;.

The &quot;Southfields Triangle&quot; is a series of roads and streets that (somewhat) resemble a triangle. It covers the area from Standen Road in the south (bordering on the historic Coronation Gardens) up to Granville Road in the north, and Pulborough Road in the west across to Merton Road in the east. The &quot;Southfields Triangle&quot; consists almost entirely of Victorian and Edwardian houses. In 1904, the Frame Foods babyfood company opened its factory in Standen Road. The building is in a distinctive Art Nouveau style, with green ceramic tiles and the slogan &#x27;Nourish and Flourish&#x27; on the exterior. The building is Grade II listed and has been converted into luxury flats. Standen Road was also the home of the Ault &amp; Wiborg printing ink factory, and is the only street in the area where the some homes with south-facing gardens border Coronation Gardens, giving them a calm, rural feel.

&quot;The Grid&quot; is a series of parallel roads that are crossed at right angles by a series of parallel streets – so named because of the grid layout of the streets. The roads run from Replingham Road, in the north to Revelstoke Road, in the south, and the streets run from Elsenham Street, in the west, to Astonville Street (although Merton Road to the east of Astonville is the border of &quot;The Grid&quot;). &quot;The Grid&quot; consists mostly of Edwardian terrace houses and purpose built maisonettes. Some houses have been converted into flats in the past, although conversions are no longer permitted on The Grid owing to a change in policy by Wandsworth Borough Council. These Victorian terraced houses were built at the same time as the bordering terraced housing Wimbledon Park and the avenues to the south of The Grid originally had the same names as the streets in Southfields that led to them. A restrictive covenant or covenants at one time prevented any pubs from being built in the Southfields &quot;Grid&quot; area. However, in the 1990s, the covenants were apparently judged either to be ineffective or non-existent and two pubs were opened in adjoining premises on the south side of Replingham Road (one since closed, in late 2011).

The building on the corner of Kimber Road and Merton Road once housed the OK Sauce factory, until its takeover by Reckitt and Colman court.

===Toponymy===

Southfields takes its name from the old manorial system, where it was known as the South Field of the manor of Dunsford. The earlier name for the area dates back at least to the year 1247.
The equivalent North Field lay between West Hill and the River Thames and survives in the short road named Northfields which runs to the east of Wandsworth Park.

==Governance==

Southfields is one of the 20 wards that make up the London Borough of Wandsworth, and it supplies three of the Borough Council&#x27;s 60 councillors – the Conservative Party&#x27;s Kim Caddy, Guy Humphries &amp; Terry Walsh. It is part of the Merton and Wandsworth constituency for the London Assembly.

Southfields falls within the parliamentary constituency of Putney. The current Member of Parliament for the constituency is the Labour Party&#x27;s Fleur Anderson, who was elected in 2019 with a majority of 4,774.

==Geography==

Southfield&#x27;s postcodes are split across the London Boroughs of Wandsworth and Merton. Of the two main parks, the above applies to Wimbledon Park whilst the second, King George&#x27;s Park is situated wholly within the boundaries of Wandsworth. Tennis being a part of the fabric of Southfields life, both parks are home to a large number of public tennis courts. Wimbledon Park has an athletic track and a landscaped lake that is home to a number of water sports. The smaller but historic Coronation Gardens bordering the southern edge of the Southfields triangle commemorates the coronation of King Edward VII in August 1902.

==Demography==

According to the 2011 census the ward of Southfields had a population of 17,962. The population of the area is largely white in its ethnic origins, at 75.6%.

The area is also home to a significant white South African community. 

==Transport==
The A3 trunk road runs south west towards Portsmouth and north east into central London along Southfields&#x27; northern edge; the district is bounded by the A218 (Merton Road) to the east and the A219 (Parkside Avenue) to the west.

Southfields is served by bus routes 39 (Clapham Junction to Putney Bridge, operated by London General), 493 (Tooting, St George’s Hospital to Richmond, operated by London General) and 156 (Vauxhall to Wimbledon, operated by Transport UK London Bus).

Southfields tube station is in Travelcard Zone 3 of the London Underground network, situated between East Putney and Wimbledon Park on the Wimbledon branch of the District line. Southfields is the main London Underground station for the Wimbledon Tennis Championships. A five-minute walk takes spectators from Southfields Tube down Wimbledon Park Road to the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club.

Southfields is not served by the National Rail network; the nearest National Rail stations are Earlsfield, Wimbledon and Putney.

==Popular culture==

Part of the video for Shampoo&#x27;s 1994 hit single &#x27;Trouble&#x27; was filmed in Southfields.

The former cinema premises on Wimbledon Park Road, most recently used as a snooker club were demolished following a successful planning application from the owners of the site, despite a three-year campaign by a local group to convert the building back to a local cinema, which would have been named The Southfields Plaza.

In 1926, Southfields became home to London&#x27;s first mosque. The Fazl Mosque, also known as the &quot;London Mosque&quot;, was built by the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community and served as the international headquarters of the community until 2019, when the headquarters moved to Farnham.

The band Lawson&#x27;s debut album was named after Chapman Square SW19.

<text>Pyotr Fyodorovich Anjou (; 15 February 1796 – 12 October 1869) was an Arctic explorer and an admiral of the Imperial Russian Navy.

==Background==
Anjou&#x27;s grandfather was a French Huguenot who entered the service of Russia in the middle of the 18th century. His father became a Russian citizen and worked as a doctor. Anjou was born in Vyshny Volochyok, near Tver. He graduated from the Marine Cadet Corps.

As a lieutenant, Anjou was given a task to describe the northern coast of Siberia in 1820. He and his assistants (P.Ilyin, I. Berezhnykh, and A. Figurin) described the coastline and the islands between the rivers Olenyok and Indigirka and made a map of the New Siberian Islands.

In 1825–1826, Anjou participated in describing the northeastern coast of the Caspian Sea and the western coast of the Aral Sea. He distinguished himself in the Battle of Navarino as a lieutenant of the line of battle ship &quot;Gangut&quot;.

Later on, he held a few commanding posts and also served in administrative and scientific establishments of the Russian Admiralty. One of the groups of the New Siberian Islands bears Anjou&#x27;s name (the Anjou Islands).

<text>East Jersey State Prison (&quot;formerly &quot;Rahway State Prison&quot;&quot;) is a maximum security prison operated by the New Jersey Department of Corrections in Avenel, Woodbridge Township, New Jersey. It was established in 1896 as Rahway State Prison, and was the first reformatory in New Jersey, officially opening in 1901. It housed 1,227 inmates .

== General information ==

=== Buildings and Grounds ===
* The prison&#x27;s mailing address is in Rahway, NJ, but the prison is located outside of Rahway, in nearby Avenel, New Jersey.
* The prison&#x27;s large dome is a well known, local landmark visible from nearby US Route 1–9 and New Jersey Transit&#x27;s North Jersey Coast Line routes.
* The prison features a large walled compound in size, which contains the administration building, cell houses, classrooms, a chapel, shops, and other buildings.
* The prison was originally surrounded by hundreds of acres of farmland where inmates worked.
* Located just South of the prison is the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center (A.D.T.C.), New Jersey&#x27;s facility for incarcerated sex offenders. Officers assigned to A.D.T.C. also operate the Special Treatment Unit (S.T.U.), which is the state&#x27;s location for those civilly committed sexually violent predators. These inmates are typically ones who completed serving their time, but are not psychologically deemed safe to reintegrate into society and are extremely likely to re-offend.

=== Operational Information ===
* Originally, inmates were categorized on a conduct-based &quot;grading&quot; system, in which inmates at different grade levels were granted varying privileges. Each inmate received a book of rules and regulations detailing expected appropriate behavior and the consequences of violating the rules. All inmates entered the system at the &quot;second grade&quot; level with the opportunity to advance or to be demoted.
*In the first years of operation, inmates woke at 5:45 a.m. with lights out at 9 p.m. Their typical day consisted primarily of school and/or work. Students went to classes for half the day and worked the other half. The prison offered vocational training and jobs, including tailoring, cooking, shoe-making, printing, electrical work, farming/gardening, plumbing, and painting.
* The Education Department of &quot;East Jersey State Prison&quot; offers a variety of programs to the inmates. Vocational training courses include auto-body, auto mechanics, culinary arts, painting and decorating, and horticulture. The prison offers primary education (A.B.E. Course) and secondary education (GED) courses to the inmates. Inmates who are high school or GED graduates can take college classes offered through Union County College&#x27;s &quot;Project Inside&quot; program.

==History==
=== New Jersey Reformatory ===

* In 1895, the New Jersey Legislature voted to establish the state&#x27;s first reformatory, named the &quot;New Jersey Reformatory.&quot;
* The &quot;New Jersey Reformatory&quot; opened in 1901, housing 193 men between the ages of 16 and 30. 
* In 1912, the number of inmates had increased to 525. 
* In 1928, enrollment increased to 745. Of the 514 prisoners admitted during 1928, 304 (59%) were under twenty years of age, 164 (32%) were twenty to twenty-four, and 46 (9%) were from twenty-five to twenty-nine years old, with a racial breakdown of 406 (79%) White and 108 (21%) African-American.
* The first superintendent, J. E. Heg, served only for a year. He was succeeded by Joseph W. Martin, who led the institution until his death in 1909. Martin was succeeded by Dr. Frank Moore, who retired in 1929.

=== Construction and Building Upgrades ===
* Architect John Rochester Thomas (1848 - 1901), designed the original prison in 1895 and construction began on state-owned property, known as Edgar Farm in 1896.
* By 1908, there were two four-tiered cell houses. One cell house contained 256 cells measuring 9&#x27;x5&#x27;x8.6&#x27;H, while the other had 384 cells that were only 7.1&#x27;x5&#x27;x8&#x27;H. A 1928 inspection reported that the cells were equipped &quot;&quot;with a fair quality of toilet and lavatory&quot;.&quot;
* In 1929, with the opening of nearby reformatories at Annandale (1928) and Bordentown (1937), Rahway State Prison changed from a reformatory to a prison for adult males.
* In 1930, construction began on additions to the institution. Between 1931 and 1932, industrial and laundry buildings were added.
* in 1932, the dormitory, &quot;Two Wing&quot;, was built, housing 300 men, increasing the prison&#x27;s capacity to 900 inmates. 
* In 1951, Rahway&#x27;s capacity was furthered increased to 1,000, when the last wing, &quot;Three Wing&quot;, was constructed. As years passed, renovation on the institution continued.
* In 1967, one of the old buildings was improved and made into &quot;Five Wing&quot;.
* From 1985 to 1988, trailers were erected and old buildings renovated (textile and laundry) for housing and dining facilities. These new additions became &quot;Six, Seven, and Eight Wings&quot;.
* Around 2008, the yellow paint was removed from the brick of wings 1–4, restoring the brick aesthetics of the original1896 building.

=== Riots and escapes ===

* From April 17–22, 1952, prisoners took officers hostage during a riot after officers beat inmates with nightsticks. The riot ended when the inmates were gassed.
* In 1971, on Thanksgiving Day, 500 inmates held 6 hostages, including the warden, for 24 hours. Six officers were injured, three with stab wounds in the early hours of the riot. The inmates demanded a more sufficient diet, regulation of commissary prices, improvement of the educational system and vocation training, better discipline of officers, and additional medicine supplies including aspirin. Ultimately, the prison was retaken with no loss of life and the captives were set free without the use of firearms.
* On August 11, 1972, three convicted murderers escaped by sawing through the bars of a third-floor window. Three officers were held responsible for the escape and suspended. 
* In August 1980, in an effort to reduce the numbers of escapes, the prison issued gray prison uniforms to the prisoners.

=== Name change ===
On November 30, 1988, &quot;Rahway State Prison&quot; was renamed &quot;East Jersey State Prison&quot;. The change was lobbied by Rahway citizens, who claimed the name stigmatized the city and affected property values. Nevertheless, the prison is still commonly referred to by its former name.

== In popular culture ==
Besides becoming notorious as a tough place to be imprisoned, East Jersey State Prison has established a reputation in popular culture. With its longevity and high profile inmates, the prison has become notorious nationally. The prison has been a common setting for many documentaries, fictional movies, TV programs, and music videos. It also has been referenced in multiple books, news programs and songs.

=== Boxing ===

=== Rubin &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter ===
Rubin Carter was a former middleweight fighter who was convicted and sentenced to two life terms for murder and spent over 18 years at Rahway (1967–1985). While imprisoned, Carter wrote an autobiography called &quot;The Sixteenth Round: From Number One Contender to Number 45472,&quot; which was published in 1975. The book became instrumental in having his convictions overturned. The book made Carter&#x27;s struggle become a cause célèbre, motivating legendary boxer Muhammad Ali to lead a march of 1600 people to the New Jersey state capital building in Trenton on his behalf on October 17, 1975.
=== Chuck &quot;Bayonne Bleeder&quot; Wepner ===
Chuck Wepner was a heavyweight boxer in the 1960s-70s whose notable loss to Muhammad Ali in 1975 became the inspiration for Sylvester Stallone&#x27;s Oscar winning movie Rocky. Stallone named the main character for his 1989 film &quot;Lock Up&quot; after Wepner. Stallone met with Wepner during filming at the prison, when he was an inmate. Wepner was also the inspiration for the major motion pictures, &quot;Chuck (2016)&quot; and &quot;The Brawler (2019)&quot;.

Other High-profile professional boxers who were incarcerated at the prison: 
* Dwight Muhammad Qawi (Dwight Braxton), Inmate sentenced to 5 years for armed robbery in 1973 who became a two-time world champion after his release in 1978.
* James Scott, a title contender, who had many bouts inside the prison itself, including a fight against Dwight Muhammad Qawi.

=== Music ===
* Tommy DeVito spent time in Rahway among other jails as a juvenile offender before eventually going straight as a guitarist for The Four Seasons in adulthood.
* The Escorts, a R&amp;B vocal group, was discovered by record producer, George Kerr during an inmate variety show that Kerr attended with Linda Jones. Kerr relentlessly and successfully petitioned the federal government to record an album with the group of inmates incarcerated at Rahway in 1972. A mobile recording unit was brought to the prison where the group recorded their first hit album, &quot;All We Need Is Another Chance&quot; in just nine hours. The album would go on to reach #41 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot Soul Singles after its release in 1973. Later in the same year, the group recorded a second album, &quot;3 Down 4 to Go&quot;. 
* Bob Dylan recorded the song, &quot;Hurricane&quot; in 1975 based on Carter&#x27;s story. Dylan also held a concert, called &quot;Night of the Hurricane&quot;, playing for 20,000 people in December, 1975, just 3 months before Carter&#x27;s first conviction was overturned. Also on the bill were Stevie Wonder, Isaac Hayes, Dr. John, Shawn Phillips, Ringo Starr, Stephen Stills, Richie Havens, and Carlos Santana.
* Lifers Group, a hip hop group, grew out of the Lifers Group Juvenile Awareness Program portrayed in &quot;Scared Straight!&quot;. In 1991, the group released an album and an EP, titled &quot;#66064&quot;, featuring songs, &quot;The Real Deal&quot; and &quot;Belly of the Beast&quot;. A 30-minute documentary, directed by Penelope Spheeris, focusing on the group&#x27;s songs and depicting life in East Jersey State, was released in 1992, and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video

<doc id="796369" wikidata="Q695820" url="?curid=796369" title="M'era Luna Festival">
<text>The M&#x27;era Luna is a gothic festival that encompasses a number of different styles such as metal, future pop, aggrotech, synthpop, gothic rock, dark wave, and EBM. It is held annually on the second weekend of every August, in Hildesheim, Germany at Flugplatz Hildesheim-Drispenstedt, a former British Army airbase.

M&#x27;era Luna includes camping facilities and has two stages: a large rock festival-style structure, erected for the show each year, and a former aircraft hangar.

With its 20,000–25,000 regular attendants (21,000 in 2005, 23,000 in 2009, 24,000 in 2010) (many flying in via the Hanover airport, with others traveling via road and railway), the M&#x27;era Luna is one of the biggest dark music events in Germany.

The festival&#x27;s logo is based on the image of the moon from the 1902 film &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; by the French director Georges Méliès. An altered version of the logo was introduced for the 2019 festival.

<text>Hangmen Also Die! is a 1943 war film directed by the Austrian director Fritz Lang and written by John Wexley from a story by Bertolt Brecht (credited as Bert Brecht) and Lang. The film stars Brian Donlevy, with Walter Brennan, Anna Lee, and Gene Lockhart, and Dennis O&#x27;Keefe in support. Alexander Granach has a showy role as a Gestapo detective, and Hans Heinrich von Twardowski has a cameo as Reinhard Heydrich. Hanns Eisler composed the Academy Award nominated score, and James Wong Howe was cinematographer.

The film is loosely based on the 1942 assassination of Heydrich, the Nazi Reich Protector of German-occupied Bohemia and Moravia during World War II. The number-two man in the SS, and a chief mastermind of the Holocaust, Heydrich earned the epithet of &quot;The Hangman of Europe.&quot; Though the real Heydrich was assassinated by Czechoslovak soldiers parachuted from a British plane in Operation Anthropoid, this was not known at the time of filming. Instead, Heydrich&#x27;s killer is depicted as a member of the Czech resistance with ties to the Communist Party.

==Plot==

In Prague, during the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia, surgeon Dr. František Svoboda, a member of the Czech resistance, assassinates the brutal &quot;Hangman of Europe&quot;, &quot;Reichsprotektor&quot; Reinhard Heydrich. Before he can escape the scene his getaway car is discovered, forcing his planned safe house to reject him. When a stranger, Mascha, deliberately misdirects nearby German soldiers searching for him, he seeks out her home as a sanctuary, under an alias. Her father is Stephen Novotny, a respected history professor whom the Nazis have banned from teaching. He realizes Svododa must be the assassin, but is willing to risk everything to hide him.

Because the assassin now cannot be found, the Nazi leaders take hostages and threaten to execute them, all 400, forty at a time, until the killer turns himself in or is betrayed by his own people; it doesn&#x27;t matter if they are sympathetic to the Reich, fearful for the life of loved ones slated to die, or imagine doing so will limit the bloodshed, the result will be the same.

Emil Czaka, a wealthy local brewer, is part of the resistance and attends its meetings and knows its leaders. In reality, he is a German and fifth-columnist. When resistance members trick him into revealing he is a collaborator he initially weathers the upheaval. Meanwhile, the executions continue, then at a faster pace.

Determined to exact revenge, the resistance manages to frame Czaka for the murder. Even though the Nazi hierarchy knows he is not guilty, they publicly accept the resolution as if it were true to save face.

==Cast==
==Production==
A number of working titles have been reported for &quot;Hangmen Also Die&quot;: &quot;Never Surrender&quot;, &quot;No Surrender&quot;, &quot;Unconquered&quot;, &quot;We Killed Hitler&#x27;s Hangman&quot; and &quot;Trust the People&quot;. It has also been known as &quot;Lest We Forget&quot;. It has been claimed that when a book with a similar title to &quot;Never Surrender&quot; or &quot;No Surrender&quot; was published while the film was in production, the producers held a contest for the cast and crew to suggest a new title. The contest was won by a production secretary who received the $100 prize.

Teresa Wright, John Beal and Ray Middleton were also considered at one point to appear in the film, which went into production in late October 1942 and wrapped in mid-December of that year.

Director Fritz Lang had considered beginning the film with Edna St. Vincent Millay&#x27;s poem &quot;The Murder of Lidice&quot;. He decided against it, but the poem does appear in MGM&#x27;s film about Heydrich, &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Madman&quot; (1943).

&quot;Hangmen&quot; was Brecht&#x27;s only American film credit, although he supposedly worked on other scripts during his time in Hollywood, without receiving any. It is claimed that the money he earned from the project enabled him to write &quot;The Visions of Simone Machard&quot;, &quot;Schweik in the Second World War&quot; and an adaptation of Webster&#x27;s &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot;. He left the United States shortly after testifying before the House Un-American Activities Committee. John Wexley received sole credit for writing the screenplay after giving evidence to the Writers Guild that Brecht and Lang had only worked on the story. However, it seems that there is more Brecht in the script than is commonly accepted: the academic Gerd Gemünden writes that he spoke to Maurice Rapf, the judge on the case, who told him &quot;it was obvious to the jury that Brecht and not Wexley was the main author, and that Wexley furthermore had a reputation as a credit stealer. It was only because of the fact that only written evidence was admissible, and since only Wexley&#x27;s name appeared on all drafts, the jury had to rule in his favor.&quot; Wexley himself was blacklisted after he was named a communist in HUAC hearings.

&quot;Hangmen Also Die&quot; had a world premiere in Prague, Oklahoma on 27 March, an event which featured Adolf Hitler, Hirohito and Mussolini being hanged in effigy on Main Street. The mayors of Washington, Kansas, and London and Moscow, Texas attended. The film opened nationwide in the first days of April, beginning with 20 key cities.

==Music==
The music for &quot;Hangmen Also Die&quot; was composed by Hanns Eisler, Brecht&#x27;s collaborator on a number of plays with music, and earned a nomination for a Best Score Academy Award. Eisler only worked on a small number of American films, the most notable of which are &quot;Deadline at Dawn&quot; (1946) and &quot;None But the Lonely Heart&quot; (1944), for which he was also nominated for an Academy Award.

The song &quot;No Surrender&quot; in &quot;Hangmen&quot; was written by Eisler with lyrics by Sam Coslow.

==Awards==
&quot;Hangmen Also Die&quot; was nominated for two Academy Awards, for Hanns Eisler for &quot;Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture&quot;, and for Jack Whitney of Sound Services Inc. for &quot;Best Sound, Recording&quot;. The movie is rated at 88% on Rotten Tomatoes.

<doc id="796376" wikidata="Q1347313" url="?curid=796376" title="Constitution of the Year VIII">
<text>The Constitution of the Year VIII ( or ) was a national constitution of France, adopted on 24 December 1799 (during Year VIII of the French Republican calendar), which established the form of government known as the Consulate. The coup of 18 Brumaire (9 November 1799) had effectively given all power to Napoleon Bonaparte, and in the eyes of some, ended the French Revolution.

After the coup, Napoleon and his allies legitimized his position by crafting a Constitution that would be, in the words of Napoleon, &quot;short and obscure&quot;. The constitution tailor-made the position of First Consul to give Napoleon most of the powers of a dictator. It was the first constitution since the 1789 Revolution without a Declaration of Rights.

The document vested executive power in three Consuls, but all actual power was held by the First Consul, Bonaparte. This differed from Robespierre&#x27;s republic of 1792 to 1795 (which was more radical), and from the oligarchic liberal republic of the Directory (1795–1799). More than anything, the Consulat resembled the autocratic Roman Republic of Caesar Augustus, a conservative republic-in-name, which reminded the French of stability, order, and peace. It has been called a regime of &quot;modern Caesarism&quot;. To emphasize this, the authors of the constitutional document used classical Roman terms, such as &quot;Consul&quot;, &quot;Senator&quot; and &quot;Tribune&quot;.

The Constitution of Year VIII established a legislature of three houses, which was composed of a Conservative Senate of 80 men over the age of 40, a Tribunate of 100 men over the age of 25, and a Legislative Body (Corps législatif) of 300 men over 30 years old.

The Constitution also used the term &quot;notables&quot;. The word &quot;notables&quot; had been in common usage under the monarchy. It referred to prominent, &quot;distinguished&quot; men — landholders, merchants, scholars, professionals, clergymen and officials. The people in each district chose a slate of &quot;notables&quot; by popular vote. The First Consul, the Tribunate, and the &quot;Corps Législatif&quot; each nominated one Senatorial candidate to the rest of the Senate, which chose one candidate from among the three. Once all of its members were picked, it would then appoint the Tribunate, the &quot;Corps Législatif&quot;, the judges of cassation, and the commissioners of accounts from the National List of notables.

Napoleon held a plebiscite on the Constitution on 7 February 1800. The vote was not binding, but it allowed Napoleon to maintain a veneer of democracy. Lucien Bonaparte announced results of 3,011,007 in favor and 1,562 against the new dispensation. The true result was probably around 1.55 million for it, with several thousand against it.

This Constitution was amended, firstly, by the Constitution of the Year X, which made Napoleon First Consul for Life. A more extensive alteration, the Constitution of the Year XII, established the Bonaparte dynasty with Napoleon as a hereditary Emperor. The first, brief Bourbon Restoration of 1814 abolished the Napoleonic constitutional system, but the Emperor revived it and at once virtually replaced it with the so-called &quot;Additional Act&quot; of April 1815, promulgated on his return to power. The return of Louis XVIII in July 1815 (following the Hundred Days) saw the definitive abolition of Napoleon&#x27;s constitutional arrangements. The Napoleonic constitutions were completely replaced by the Bourbon Charter of 1814.

== Background and Adoption ==

Following the refusal of the Council of Five Hundred to revise the Constitution of the Year III, Napoleon Bonaparte conducted a coup d&#x27;État on the 18th Brumaire of year VIII (9 November 1799) and took control of the government alongside the Abbot Sieyès and Roger Ducos, establishing a provisional consulate.

Napoléon proceeded to compose, alongside Sieyès, a new constitution aiming to assure a strong executive power, concentrated in Napoleon&#x27;s hands. The assemblies designated a commission each for the preparation of a new constitution. Multiple sessions took place before Napoleon interfered to accelerate the process.

The Constitution of the Year VIII was composed in 11 days, principally by Pierre Claude François Daunou, who belonged to the Society of Ideologues (liberal republicans hostile to Jacobinism) and had had a significant role in writing the Constitution of the Year III. It was adopted on 13 December 1799, under pretext of emergency, before being ratified by a plebiscite which took place for 15 days, the official results of which were made public 7 February 1800.

Officially, the Constitution was approved by 3,011,107 citizens against 1,562 opposants, from a base of around 6 million voters registered in electoral lists. French historian Claude Langlois demonstrated in 1972 that the results of this plebiscite had been massively falsified by Napoleon&#x27;s brother Lucien Bonaparte.

== New Constitutional Order ==
The Constitution of the Year VIII marks a break with the preceding constitutions- it allows Napoleon to exercise a personal power all the while maintaining an illusion of democracy. The text is very technical, and defines mainly the powers of the First Consul.

Unlike the preceding Republican Constitutions, the Constitution of the Year VIII does not feature a declaration of rights and freedoms. However, some rights are affirmed in general terms, such as the inviolability of the home, personal safety, and the right to petition.

The Constitution establishes universal masculine suffrage, but the electoral system does not allow a real expression of the citizens; in effect, elections are removed, with citizen unable to elect representants but limited to create &quot;Lists of Confidence (or notability)&quot;. These were lists of candidates from which membres of the Assemblies, consuls, and functionaries are names or elected by the government or the Senate.

This universal suffrage is indirect, and proceeds in three stages:

# The voters of each canton designate a tenth of them to constitute the district list. This list makes it possible to choose the public servants of the arrondissement. These members designate another tenth of them to constitute the departmental list.
# This departmental list makes it possible to choose the officials of the department. These members designate another tenth of them to constitute the national list.
# The national list makes it possible to choose national civil servants including members of the Legislative Body and the Tribunate.

In addition, the length of stay required of a foreigner to claim French citizenship increases: it is no longer seven years but ten years, or twice as long as the period provided for by the Legislative Assembly in 1791.

The Constitution appears &quot;tailored&quot; to Napoleon, to the point that he is designated explicitly and by name as the First Consul, highly unusual for a constitutional text, which is by definition destined to be permanently applicable. The designation by name of five citizens (Napoleon, Cambacérès, Lebrun, Sieyès, and Ducos) limits the applicability of the text to the lifetimes of the Consuls.

The Consulate is composed of three Consuls, but contrary to the Directory, the Second and Third Consuls only had a consultative power.

The powers of the First Consul are considerable. He names the main civil servants and has the right of initiative. Additionally, he is given significant powers in diplomacy and military affairs.

== Organs of Executive Power ==

=== Consulate ===

The executive power, weakened during the Revolution, now holds the real political power, aided by the advisory role of the then newly-established Conseil d&#x27;État (Council of State). Executive power is wielded by the Consulate. Three Consuls are named for ten years and indefinitely re-electable by the Senate. The Second and Third Consul only being able to make their opinion known, executive power now effectively belongs to the First Consul, who also has a large amount of legislative power. He proposes and promulgates laws, names and revokes ministers and civil servants, and has no political responsibility.

The first three consuls designated by the Constitution of Year VIII are Napoléon Bonaparte, Jean-Jacques-Régis de Cambacérès, and Charles-François Lebrun.

The legislature is now weakened by its division in three assemblies: the Conservative Senate, the Tribunate, and the Legislative Body.

=== Council of State ===
The Council of State (French: Conseil d&#x27;État) was established by the article 52 of the Constitution of the Year VIII. This council was designed as an instrument at the service of the executive, given various functions for this end: from the drafting of laws to the control of the administration, consisting of resolving disputes that arise in administrative matters, particularly between citizens and the State.

It consisted of between 30 and 50 members, appointed by the First Consul.

== Organs of Legislative Power ==
In an effort to weaken the legislative power, it was divided into three organs: two assemblies, the Tribunate (French: &quot;Tribunat&quot;) and the Legislative Body (&quot;Corps législatif&quot;); and the Conservative Senate (&quot;Sénat conservateur)&quot;.

=== Tribunate ===
Composed of 100 men over the age of 25 selected by the Senate from the lists of Notability, the Tribunate had the role of discussing laws proposed by the Government. The Tribunate could express its opinion on laws made or to be made, on possible corrections, or improvements to be made in all areas of public administration. The Tribunate then designated three speakers who would defend its position before the Legislative Body.

=== Legislative Body ===
The Legislative Body was composed of 300 members over the age of 30, selected likewise by the Senate from national lists of notability. It was tasked with voting on the laws discussed by the Tribunate, without being able to modify or discuss them. For this reason, it was sometimes facetiously called the &quot;mute assembly&quot;. The Legislative Body then voted for or against the Tribunate&#x27;s proposal. If adopted, the bill became a &quot;decretal&quot; (French: Décret) of the Legislative Body, able to be promulgated as law.

=== Conservative Senate ===
The &quot;Sénat conservateur&quot; comprised 80 members made over the age of 40. This figure of 80 members was to be reached gradually; 60 members were appointed in the Year VIII, to which were to be added two additional members each year, for ten years. The Constitution of the Year VIII explicitly named Sieyès and Roger-Ducos, outgoing Second and Third Consuls, as ex officio members of the Senate. They were tasked with appointing the majority of the Senate, in consultation with Cambacérès and Lebrun, the new Second and Third Consuls.

Unlike the Tribunate and the Legislative Body, had no role in the legislative process. However, it had significant power over the two assemblies, in elective and constitutional matters.

The Senate, presided by Napoleon himself, names the members of the two assemblies. Its other mission was to ensure the constitutionality of laws; as the &quot;conservator of the Constitution&quot; (from which it gets its name), it could block the promulgation of a text voted by the Legislative Body.

<doc id="796383" wikidata="Q5325649" url="?curid=796383" title="Earache My Eye">
<text>&quot;Earache My Eye&quot; is a comedy routine and song by Cheech and Chong from their 1974 album &quot;Cheech &amp; Chong&#x27;s Wedding Album&quot;. The skit is about a teenager (played by Tommy Chong) who wakes up and listens to a song by &quot;Alice Bowie&quot; (Cheech Marin), while his father (also played by Marin) yells at him to get ready for school.

The song, unnamed in the skit, was released as a single under the name &quot;Earache My Eye&quot; and gained surprising popularity, reaching the top 10 on the charts in the United States and Canada. It has since been covered by many artists most notably Widespread Panic, Korn, and Soundgarden. The song had its music written by Gaye Delorme and was performed by session musicians including Delorme on guitar and Airto Moreira on drums. It is best known for its guitar riff.

==History==
The routine first appeared on &quot;Cheech &amp; Chong&#x27;s Wedding Album&quot; (1974). It was later included on the greatest hits collections &quot;Cheech &amp; Chong&#x27;s Greatest Hit&quot; (1981) and &quot;Where There&#x27;s Smoke There&#x27;s Cheech &amp; Chong&quot;, the latter a double-CD anthology from 2002.

Cheech and Chong lip sync to the recording (with Chong behind the drum kit) in their first movie &quot;Up in Smoke&quot; (1978). The song has been featured repeatedly on the Dr. Demento radio show, and it is included on the &quot;Dr. Demento 20th Anniversary Collection&quot;. According to Tommy Chong&#x27;s autobiography, the famous guitar riff is played by Gaye Delorme, who also composed the music for the song. Additionally, Chong states that drums on the song are played by famed international percussionist Airto Moreira.

The song was released as a single in 1974 and reached #9 on the Billboard charts and #4 in Canada. In Chicago, it topped the charts at the powerful and influential Top 40 radio station WLS (AM), holding the #1 position for one week in September 1974, in the middle of an eleven-week run on the station&#x27;s top 40 airplay charts. The song also reached the top spot for one week on the West Coast&#x27;s biggest Top 40 radio station, Los Angeles&#x27; KHJ-AM. The B-side, &quot;Turn That Thing Down&quot;, features the remainder of the musical track from the point of Marin&#x27;s monologue about his wealth, without the actual dialogue, complete to its conclusion. It is possible to assemble the full-length version of the song by editing the two sections together. An edited version that fades out before the skit appears on the soundtrack for &quot;Up in Smoke&quot; and the &quot;Greatest Hit&quot; compilation.

Once the song hit its peak on the charts, radio station managers and owners, especially the AM stations, pulled the song off the air following multiple complaints. Phone calls and angry letters came from parents, teachers, psychologists, clergy, principals, school administrators, and counselors. Complaints stated that this song mostly appealed to junkies, dropouts, drug addicts, and drunkards as well as students playing hooky from class, giving them a bad model for their behavior. Those who opposed the track threatened to boycott the stations unless the song was permanently withdrawn. &quot;Oldies&quot; station AM 1110 KRLA banned the track, and some radio managers threatened to fire any disc jockey who played it. Sponsors threatened to pull their advertisements unless the song was completely removed from playlists. The AM stations threatened to fire any radio station employees who accepted requests or discussed the track on the air.

==Content==
&quot;Earache My Eye&quot; consists of a song followed by a comedy skit.

In the skit, Chong plays a rebellious teen. At the beginning of the piece we hear snoring, followed by an alarm clock, and then the boy wakes up noisily. He starts up a glam rock record, with Cheech Marin singing the lyrics as glam rock star character Alice Bowie who, as the name implies, is supposed to be a combination of Alice Cooper and Ziggy Stardust-era David Bowie (at one point in his tune, &quot;Alice Bowie&quot; even mentions having orange hair, which the real David Bowie had sported at that time). The song itself is about a teenager fantasizing about becoming a world-famous rock star, becoming very wealthy and not having to listen to authority as a result, including being disowned for wearing his sister&#x27;s pantyhose. The teenager states that he did not care if the world came to an end and that he was kicked off the basketball team by the coach for &quot;wearing high-heeled sneakers and acting like a queen.&quot;

As the song continues into an electric guitar-heavy bridge, the teen&#x27;s father (Marin) barges into the room and yells, &quot;I said turn that thing down and get ready for school!&quot;, and scratches the record, which annoys the boy. The father then tells his son to get his &quot;fanny perpendicular&quot; and get ready for school. The son then complains about an earache, prompting the dad to exclaim, &quot;Earache my eye, how would you like a butt-ache?&quot; The boy then gets even snottier, provoking his father to swat him with a belt. When he ridicules the spanking as painless, the father then whips him into sniveling, outward compliance, which lasts until his father leaves the room, after which the teen puts the record back on.

During the latter part of the record (&quot;Turn That Thing Down&quot;) – essentially, an extended, electric rock guitar-driven coda, beginning from Alice Bowie&#x27;s rant about being wealthy (albeit without the lyrics) – the father can be heard knocking on the door several times demanding that his son &quot;turn that thing down and get ready for school&quot;.

==Charts ==
==Influence==
The musical portion of &quot;Earache My Eye&quot; was written originally by Canadian artist Gaye Delorme, a resident of Edmonton, AB. The song has been covered by many bands, ranging in styles from heavy metal to hip hop. The comedy-metal group Scatterbrain covered the song on their album &quot;Here Comes Trouble&quot;. 

Korn released the song as a hidden track at the end of &quot;My Gift to You&quot; from their 1998 album &quot;Follow the Leader&quot;, with Cheech Marin appearing as a guest vocalist. The recording was reissued on the compilations &quot;Live and Rare&quot; and &quot;&quot;, separated from &quot;My Gift to You&quot;.

Rollins Band and Soundgarden both covered the song, and the hip-hop group 2 Live Crew used a sample from the song on their 1989 album &quot;As Nasty As They Wanna Be&quot; for the song &quot;Dirty Nursery Rhymes&quot;. The Canadian power trio Rush have used the song&#x27;s signature riff live, to end &quot;The Big Money&quot;, (whose album version ends with a fade) on the live album &quot;A Show of Hands&quot; and the final riff of the same show as depicted in the video of the same name. It was also used to end Tom Sawyer on the band&#x27;s Snakes &amp; Arrows World Tour and can be heard on the subsequent live album.

Electric Magma used the song&#x27;s main riff in a song titled &quot;The Chong Song&quot; which appears on the 2007 release, &quot;Coconut Bangers Ball&quot;.

Gov&#x27;t Mule covered the song at the Vic Theatre in Chicago, Illinois on April 15, 2000, with Brodie Hutchinson, soundman, performing the spoken word portion and this is available as a Classic Muletracks.

The Kottonmouth Kings also sampled this classic on the song &quot;Loadies&quot; from their album &quot;Cloud Nine&quot;.

Raging Slab also covered the song on their 1991 release, &quot;Slabbage / True Death&quot;.

A sample of the song was heard in the 1995 film &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Senior Trip&quot;.

Widespread Panic covered it on Halloween 2014 in Broomfield, Colorado.

Eminem sampled the song on his track &quot;Untouchable&quot;, from his album &quot;Revival&quot;.

<text>The Constitution of the Year X () was a national constitution of France adopted during the Year X (10) on 16 Thermidor (4 August) of the French Revolutionary Calendar (1802 in the Gregorian calendar). It amended the Constitution of the Year VIII, revising the Consulate to augment Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s authority by making him First Consul for Life.

Both the Constitution of the Year X and the Constitution of the Year VIII were further amended by the Constitution of the Year XII, which established the First French Empire with Napoleon as Emperor.

<text>The Constitution of the Year XII (), also called the Organic [[Sénatus-consulte]] of 28 [[Floréal]], year XII (), was a national constitution of the First French Republic adopted during the Year XII of the French Revolutionary Calendar (1804 in the Gregorian calendar).

It amended the earlier Constitution of the Year VIII and Constitution of the Year X, establishing the First French Empire with Napoleon Bonaparte — previously First Consul for Life, with wide-ranging powers — as Napoleon I, Emperor of the French. The Constitution established the House of Bonaparte as France&#x27;s imperial dynasty, making the throne hereditary in Napoleon&#x27;s family. The Constitution of the Year XII was later itself extensively amended by the Additional Act and definitively abolished with the final return of the Bourbons in 1815.

<text>Rhiwbina (; , also &quot;Rhiwbina&quot;) is a suburb and community in the north of Cardiff, the capital of Wales. Formerly a small hamlet within the parish of Whitchurch, Rhiwbina was developed throughout the twentieth century, and is now a separate ward. It retains aspects of its former character, however, and is given a Welsh village appearance by Beulah United Reformed Church (originally Capel Beulah) at the village crossroads.

Modern Rhiwbina, which includes Rhiwbina Garden Village, Wenallt Hill, Rhiwbina Hill, Rhydwaedlyd and the Llanishen Fach and Pantmawr developments, is bordered by the suburbs of Whitchurch (Yr Eglwys Newydd) to the west, Llanishen to the east, and Birchgrove (Llwynbedw) to the south. To the north is the border with Caerphilly. The area is served by Rhiwbina railway station on the Coryton Line.

== Etymology and pronunciation ==
The earliest records of a settlement in the area are found in the 12th century Book of Llandaff. This records that Rhiwallon, son of Rhan, gave up his &quot;Rhiwbrien&quot; property and that it be transferred to the Bishop in 1040. A papal bull of Honorius II, also records that &quot;Rhiwbrien&quot; was part of the Bishop&#x27;s holdings in 1129. The modern name, Rhiwbina is first documented in a 1630 survey of the Cantref of Senghenydd; it states that the ground on which the ruins of Castell Coch stood belonged to &quot;Henry Morgan of &quot;Rhiwbyna&quot;&quot;. The name also appears in a Will of 1708 as &quot;Rhiwhina&quot; and in 1777 as &quot;Rhubina&quot;.

Although the first element is unanimously agreed to derive from (meaning a slope or ascent, matching Rhiwbina&#x27;s topography), there is no agreed etymology for the second. The suggestions for &quot;pina&quot;, from the local Welsh dialect form of (pine-trees) and for &quot;pannier&quot; (referring to the panniers of the mules carrying iron through the village from Caerphilly to Cardiff) have both been rejected as the name appears to predate both ironworking in Caerphilly and the introduction of pine trees to the area. A popular folk etymology states that the name derives from (with Beuno likely referring to St Beuno).

Archive recordings of Welsh speakers from the area all pronounce the penultimate vowel as (&quot;Rhiw-BE-na&quot;). However, as the village developed throughout the 20th century, the number of people with Welsh as their first language continued to decline. This demographic shift saw the name often mispronounced by those unfamiliar with Welsh orthography, and pronouncing the name with a penultimate diphthong, (&quot;Rhiw-BYE-na&quot;) instead.

To better reflect the original and new pronunciations, the village is one of only eight settlements in Wales to have two standardised Welsh spellings, &quot;Rhiwbina&quot; and &quot;Rhiwbeina&quot;.

== History ==
Near the summit of the Wenallt, to the north of Rhiwbina, are the remains of an oval encampment probably dating from the Iron Age, the earliest evidence of settlement in the area. At the base of the hill is a medieval motte called the Twmpath Castle, which is a scheduled monument.

The last native Welsh Prince of Morgannwg (Glamorgan), Iestyn ap Gwrgant, may have been killed in a battle north of Rhiwbina towards the end of the 11th century, near the present-day Butchers Arms public house. The stream nearby is still called Rhyd Waedlyd, which means &#x27;Bloody Ford&#x27;. Rhydwaedlyd was the title given to housing developments to Rhiwbina&#x27;s east in the latter half of the 20th century. This area has since come to be considered part of Rhiwbina itself and the name &#x27;Rhydwaedlyd&#x27; has fallen out of use entirely.
Until the 20th century the area remained rural, with few houses. The railway station opened in 1911, and the following year development began of Rhiwbina Garden Village, a new garden suburb based on a masterplan by Sir Raymond Unwin, one of the leading architects of the Garden city movement. The first 34 houses were built in 1913 and more were built from 1919 to 1923, occupying an area between Pen-y-dre and Lon Isa which became known as Rhiwbina Garden Village. It was designated as a Conservation Area in 1976.

A focal point in Rhiwbina in the early 20th century was the &quot;Rhiwbina Tea Gardens&quot;. Owned by the Smart family, it later became &quot;Rhiwbina Motor Garages&quot; in response to the rise of the motor car and subsequently the area&#x27;s first video rental outlet in the early 1980s. The business was closed on the retirement of Cliff Smart in 1989 and the site is now occupied by the development of Clos Yr Ardd. This translates as Garden Close, in memory of the Tea Gardens, but there is little greenery left.

Rhiwbina village centre is small compared to nearby Whitchurch and Birchgrove, but has in recent years undergone a revival, and is now a popular shopping destination for gifts and art.

==Amenities==
There are three schools within the ward – Rhiwbeina Primary School, Llanishen Fach Primary School and Greenhill School. Llanishen Fach is the only school in Cardiff which sends its Year 6 pupils to two main secondary schools, Whitchurch High, and Llanishen High. Rhiwbina currently has no Welsh-medium school. As a result, some local children travel to the nearby Ysgol y Wern and Ysgol Melin Griffith to receive their education.
The area has a large number of churches and chapels including All Saints (Church in Wales), Beulah (URC), Bethesda (Independent), Rhiwbina Baptist Church, Bethany (Baptist), Bethel (Methodist) and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

To the north of Rhiwbina is a parade of shops on Heol Llanishen Fach, built in the 1960s to serve an extensive area of new housing. Also to the north of Rhiwbina village is the Deri Stores, a family run shop on the corner of Wenallt Road and Rhiwbina Hill which used to be a post office, and before that a cafe. Another parade of shops was built further north at Pantmawr, but has since been demolished and replaced by houses.

Rhiwbina has been the home of many noted Welsh artists including the authors Jack Jones and Kate Roberts, musician Howard Jones, dramatist Tom Richards and the actress Rachel Thomas, who worked together.

Since 1997 the &#x27;Deri&#x27; community quarterly newsletter has been published by the Rhiwbina Civic Society. Rhiwbina also has a quarterly magazine launched on 15 November 2007, called &quot;Rhiwbina Living&quot;. A similar publication, &quot;Wenallt&quot;, was published between 1972 and 1980 but failed due to a lack of local advertising. A hyperlocal news and information website Rhiwbina Info has operated since 2013.

==The Welsh language==
The number of Rhiwbina residents over the age of three who speak Welsh increased slightly from 1,409 (12.8%) in the 2001 UK Census to 1,433 (12.9%) in the 2011 UK Census.

Beulah United Reformed Church was originally a Welsh-speaking congregationalist chapel, but the services turned to English in 1898. Bethel Methodist Church continues to hold Welsh-language services.

Rhiwbina has been the home of many notable figures in Welsh-language culture, including W. J. Gruffydd, R. T. Jenkins, Iorwerth Peate and Kate Roberts.

==Governance==

The electoral ward of Rhiwbina falls within the parliamentary constituency of Cardiff North. It is bounded by the wards of Lisvane and Llanishen to the east; Heath to the southeast; and Whitchurch &amp; Tongwynlais to the west.

*Cardiff Council: The ward returns three councillors to Cardiff Council. Rhiwbina is represented by Jayne Cowan (Conservative), Adrian Robson (Conservative) and Oliver Owen (Conservative). 
*Senedd Cymru: Part of the Cardiff North constituency within the Senedd, it is represented by Julie Morgan MS (Welsh Labour). 
*Westminster: Part of the Cardiff North constituency within the Parliament, it is represented by Anna McMorrin MP Welsh Labour, who has held the seat since 2017, taking it from the former Welsh Conservative Party MP Craig Williams.

==Transport==

There are three railway stations located within Rhiwbina. The principal station is Rhiwbina railway station, located behind the library in the heart of the village. The other two stations are Birchgrove railway station, located in the east of the ward, and Whitchurch railway station, Cardiff in the west. These two stations were built (as their names suggest) to service other adjacent areas, but the expansion of Rhiwbina and its clear demarcation from Whitchurch has meant that all three stations are now located within the boundaries of the ward. All of the stations are on the Cardiff Central to Coryton Line, and were built by the Cardiff Railway Company. Presently, services continue through west Cardiff via the City Line to Radyr.

Cardiff Bus services 21 (Central Station - Gabalfa - Birchgrove - Whitchurch - Coryton - Rhiwbina) and 23 (Central Station - Gabalfa - Birchgrove - Rhiwbina - Coryton - Whitchurch) frequently run through the area. Crossgates Coaches also ran service 22 (Heath Hospital – Rhiwbina) but this route ceased running in 2013.

Heol-y-Deri is the main road leading through the district. Rhiwbina is situated between the A470 (Cardiff City Centre to M4 J32) and A469 (Cardiff city centre to Caerphilly).

==Sport and leisure==
Rhiwbina Recreation Club is a centre of activities within the community, and is home to tennis, rugby, squash, bowls and table tennis clubs.

Rhiwbina RFC, the local rugby union club operates sides from Under 7 to Under 16, plus a youth and three senior teams. The First XV was promoted to Division 4 East after an unbeaten League run in Season 2006–07. The club operates from the Rhiwbina Recreational Club.

Rhiwbina Squash Club has men&#x27;s teams playing in the Premier, South Wales and South Glamorgan Leagues. The club also has a Junior and Ladies section. Rhiwbina Squash Club were the 2011 South Wales Premier League Champions.

He is a local hero, despite being only semi-literate, and having no formal higher education. His inventions tend to be practical devices, inspired by needs he perceives in his daily life. His first, made when he was seventeen, was a radio powered by the wearer&#x27;s bodily electricity. 

His single-minded attention to coming up with his inventions has led to him being called mad by many in his community. &quot;Even if major companies have got there first, Ghulam still pushes ahead although he struggles to make a living.&quot; He has devoted himself to inventing full-time, being supported financially by his four sons.

== List of some inventions ==

* automatic cradle rocker
* solar-powered water pump
* solar-powered car
* electric teakettle with an automatic safety shutoff
* burglar alarm that photographs the intruder
* automatic hand-washing system
* flood warning system

<text>To the Teeth is singer-songwriter Ani DiFranco&#x27;s 10th studio album (excluding EPs, live albums and her collaborations with Utah Phillips), released in November 1999.

&quot;To the Teeth&quot; has a more political and self-questioning edge than many of her earlier works. It is also considerably more experimental, with &quot;Freakshow&quot;, &quot;Swing&quot;, &quot;Carry You Around&quot; and &quot;The Arrivals Gate&quot; branching out into genres such as blues, jazz and funk. She was also supported by Prince on the track &quot;Providence&quot;.

It opens with the title track, an indictment of America&#x27;s gun culture, and a response to the Columbine High School massacre. It also contains &quot;Soft Shoulder&quot;, about two lovers missing their opportunity, and &quot;Hello Birmingham&quot;, a sad, angry response to both the shooting murder of abortion doctor Barnett Slepian and the bombing of a Birmingham, Alabama, abortion clinic.

&quot;To the Teeth&quot; reached No. 76 on the Billboard Music Chart Top 200, and No. 9 on their Top Internet Albums chart.

<doc id="796411" wikidata="Q1169332" url="?curid=796411" title="Landing craft tank">
<text>The Landing Craft, Tank (LCT) (or tank landing craft, TLC) was an amphibious assault craft for landing tanks on beachheads. They were initially developed by the Royal Navy and later by the United States Navy during World War II in a series of versions. Initially known as the &quot;tank landing craft&quot; (TLC) by the British, they later adopted the U.S. nomenclature &quot;landing craft, tank&quot; (LCT). The United States continued to build LCTs post-war, and used them under different designations in the Korean and Vietnam Wars.

==Development==
In 1926, the first motor landing craft (MLC1) was built by the Royal Navy. It weighed 16 tons, with a draught of , and was capable of about . It was later developed into the landing craft mechanised.

It was at the insistence of the British prime minister Winston Churchill in mid-1940 that the LCT was created. Its speed was on engines delivering about . Designated the LCT Mark 1, 20 were ordered in July 1940 and a further 10 in October 1940.)

===Mark 1===

The first LCT Mark 1 was launched by Hawthorn Leslie, Hebburn on Tyne, in November 1940. It was designed to land three of the heaviest tanks (40t) then envisaged for the British Army in 2 ft 6ins of water on a 1:35 gradient beach. The load capacity was three 40-ton tanks, six 25-ton tanks or six 16-ton tanks. The forward draught was 3 feet forward and 5 feet 9 inches aft. They were designed on the same principle as a floating dock, with watertight side pontoons on each side joined by a tank deck set below the waterline. The tank deck swept up above the waterline near the bow before falling away again to the ramp. Engines were two Hall Scott Defender petrol engines of 500 hp each. The craft were arranged in four sections so they could be shipped to the Eastern Mediterranean as deck cargo on merchant ships. Thirty of these craft were ordered. 
===Mark 2===

The LCT Mark 2 was longer and wider than the Mark 1, with three Napier Lion petrol engines replacing the Hall-Scotts as these were required for Coastal Forces craft. At , it had three times the range of its predecessor. Seventy-three Mk.2s were built.
Increasing the beam of the Mk2 by allowed a much greater cargo capacity of lighter vehicles, where the Mk1 could only carry three Valentine tanks the Mark 2 could carry 7. The first craft were ordered in December 1940 and completed in March 1941. The craft was a little faster but three sets of running gear strained the supply position so later Mk2 had two Paxman diesel engines of 500 hp each. It was apparent now that LCTs would be required in huge numbers and ship builders would not have the capacity so structural steelwork firms were added to the program to prefabricate the structure and former shipyards reopened to assemble the craft. Like the Mark 1 the Mark 2 was assembled in four sections to facilitate shipping to Eastern Mediterranean.
===Mark 3===

At the Mark 3 was longer than the Mark 2. Although this meant extra weight, the vessel was slightly faster than the Mark 1. Two hundred and thirty-five Mk. 3s were built.
The 32 ft section was added in May 1941 to the Mark 2 as a fifth building section, parallel sided. This meant the capacity went to 11 Valentines or 11 M4 Sherman medium tanks or 5 Churchill infantry tanks. 166 craft were built using two Paxman diesels, 71 were built in the winter of 1943-1944 to a slightly revised pattern using two Sterling Admiral petrol engines. These are usually referred to as Mark 3* or 7000 series as they had pennant numbers from 7000 upwards. LCT7074, currently preserved in Portsmouth, UK, is of this type. 
===Mark 4===

The Mark 4 had a much wider beam - - than the Mark 3. Built for use in the English Channel, it had a displacement of 586 tons and was powered by two 460 hp Paxman diesels. With a capacity of 350 tons, it could carry nine M4 Sherman or six Churchill tanks. Eight hundred and sixty-five Mk.4s were built, the largest LCT production in British yards.
In addition to the increased beam, the Mark IV had a draught reduced to 3 ft 8in forward and 4 ft aft, allowing assault operations of much flatter beaches. The tank deck was brought above the waterline. Construction was somewhat flimsy and a number of these vessels broke their backs on uneven beaches or in heavy seas; nevertheless, the type gave excellent service. Later versions were stiffened and some made voyages to India. All of these vessels were built from prefabricated kits assembled in riverside yards, no ship builders were used in their construction.

===Mark 5===
After World War II, eleven were used in 1950-1960 by the Polish Navy amphibious forces, with BDS, later ODS prefixes.

===Mark 7===
The Mark 7 was an even larger LCT that could carry troops. In 1944, when the Mk.7 design reached a length of 203 feet, its designation was changed to landing ship medium (LSM). The new variant could attain speeds of up to 12 knots and saw usage in the Pacific. 558 were built.
===Mark 8===
The 225-foot LCT Mark 8, intended for service in the Pacific, was developed by the British in 1944. One hundred and eighty-six Mk.8s were ordered; however, when the war ended, most were cancelled and scrapped, or sold directly into civilian service. Only 31 entered service with the Royal Navy. Twelve were later transferred to the British Army; these were initially operated by the Royal Army Service Corps, then by the Royal Corps of Transport. Between 1958 and 1966, the other 19 ships were transferred to foreign navies or civilian companies, converted for other uses, or otherwise disposed of.
===Mark 9===
An even larger LCT Mark 9 was considered in 1944, but the design was never finalised and none were built.

==Armament==
The LCTs had a variety of weapons, with the British (40mm) QF 2-pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot; mounts being gradually replaced by the faster firing 20 mm Oerlikon cannon. The Bofors 40 mm was also widely used, and proved that the LCT was an excellent gunfire support vessel. Various machines guns were often mounted for self-defence from aircraft and small boats, often two to four in the .30-calibre (7.62 mm) and .50-calibre (12.7 mm), range depending on the operating country. Some models were fitted with a pair of &#x27;Fast Aerial Mine&#x27; launchers near the bow.

==Conversions and modifications==

Several special purpose versions were created for use during the Normandy landings. The British created the Landing Craft Tank (Rocket) (LCT(R)) modified to fire salvoes of three-inch RP-3 rockets, while the Landing Craft Guns (Large) (LCG(L)) was armed with two QF 4.7 inch guns, eight Oerlikon 20 mm AA guns and two 2-pounder pom-poms. These ships did not beach; their mission was close-in gunfire support.

The Landing Craft Tank (Armoured) (LCT(A)) was designed for use by the first wave and was equipped with additional armour protection for the crew stations and on the bows, while a heavy wooden ramp allowed the two forward tanks to fire forward. These were all U.S-built LCT Mk.5s, which had been provided under Lend-Lease to the British for Mediterranean operations, then &quot;reverse lend-leased&quot; back to the U.S. for the invasion.

The Landing Craft Tank (self-propelled) (LCT(SP)) carried self-propelled guns for fire support; in U.S. vessels these were 155 mm, while the British used M7 105 mm self-propelled guns and called them &quot;Landing Craft Tank (High Explosive)&quot; (LCT(HE)). A related variant was the British Landing Craft Tank (Concrete Buster) (LCT(CB)), which carried three British Sherman Firefly tanks fitted with the 17-pounder high velocity gun, specifically deployed to attack fortifications. Other variants included the Landing Craft Tank (Hospital) (LCT(H)) for casualty evacuation, and one LCT served as a floating bakery at Normandy.

Some LCTs with specialised weaponry were used as floating anti-aircraft batteries. These were often manned by mixed army and navy crews. Others were modified after the war for uses such as dredging.

==Post-war==
Unlike most wartime landing craft, the LCT remained in active duty with the U.S. Navy after the war, and many LCTs were also loaned or given to the post-war navies of Allied countries. In early 1949, their designation was changed to landing ship utility (LSU), and changed again in late 1949 to landing craft utility (LCU). New landing craft (the LCU 1466-, 1610-, 1627-, and 1646-classes) were also built to a modified Mark 5 design. Some were later reclassified during the Vietnam War as harbor utility craft (YFU) as they no longer served in an amphibious assault role, but were used in harbor support roles such as transporting goods from supply ships; however, the YFU-71-class were 11 &quot;Skilak&quot; lighters purchased as &#x27;commercial off-the-shelf&#x27;, and so were not originally LCUs.

In 1964, NASA converted an LCT Mk.5 for astronaut recovery training as &quot;MV Retriever&quot;.

Currently, tanks are mostly transported via Airlift or National Defense Reserve Fleet freighters (as during the Persian Gulf War) over long distances, but can be delivered by Landing Craft Air Cushion.

==Survivors==
As of August 2007, at least one wartime LCT is still in use, the Mark 5 &quot;LCT-203&quot;, now renamed &quot;Outer Island&quot;, and operating on Lake Superior as a dredge and construction barge.

As of August 2016, the Mark 6 &quot;LCT-1433&quot; was also in use as a fishing/merchant vessel in Kodiak, Alaska, having been renamed &quot;Cape Douglas&quot;.

The British Mark 2, converted to LCT rocket &quot;LCT(2)(R) 147&quot; served in the North Africa landings, then as a clandestine immigration ship post-war to Mandatory Palestine. She is now at the Clandestine Immigration and Naval Museum in Haifa, Israel.

The British Mark 3 &quot;LCT 7074&quot; served in Normandy and was decommissioned in 1948 and presented to the Master Mariners&#x27; Club of Liverpool to be used as their club ship and renamed &quot;Landfall&quot;. Later converted to a floating nightclub, in the late 1990s the vessel was acquired by the Warship Preservation Trust and was moored at Birkenhead. In January 2006, the Trust went into liquidation and the ship was left to rot, and by April 2010 had sunk at her berth. The craft was refloated in East Float on 16 October 2014 and moved to Portsmouth for renovation. LCT 7074&#x27;s renovation was completed in summer 2020 and she was moved to her new home at The D-Day Story museum in Southsea on 24 August 2020.

=== Wrecks ===
A D-Day veteran and the last known Mark 4, &quot;LCT 728&quot;, was rediscovered rotting at the Port of Poole alongside another unknown Mark 3, possibly &quot;LCT(4) 510&quot;. They were used as barges in the 1950s.

In 2020, the wreck of an LCT was discovered off Bardsey Island, Wales at a depth of . The vessel is thought to be LCT &quot;326&quot;, which disappeared on 31 January 1943 in heavy weather with the loss of all 14 crew. The wreck is in two parts, separated by . This suggests the vessel was broken in two by the weather and the two halves remained afloat long enough to allow them to drift slightly apart.

A Mark 1 Landing Craft, A6, has been visible a few meters from the shore of the archaeological site of Phalasarna, West Crete, since it was sunk in 1941 during the Battle of Crete. The history of the vessel, partly based on interviews of the captain, John Sutton, was investigated by Michael Bendon.

==Cultural references==
===Literature===

Hammond Innes&#x27; 1946 adventure novel Dead and Alive describes the recovery of an LCT that had been washed up and wrecked on a Cornish coastal inlet. This is probably meant to be a Mark 3 because it is said to have had a pair of Paxman engines with two shafts and had previously been fitted with Pom-poms. Once recovered, the craft is used to trade between the UK and Italy; useful because of its ability to load and unload lorries on beaches rather than in the many Italian harbours destroyed in WW2.

Hammond Innes&#x27; 1962 adventure novel &quot;Atlantic Fury&quot; describes the hasty late-season evacuation, on LCTs, of equipment and personnel from a military radar station on an island called Laerg (based on Hirta, in the St. Kilda Archipelago, about 40 miles west of Scotland&#x27;s Outer Hebrides), while a severe storm bears down. The author details the vulnerabilities of the LCTs in heavy seas and shifting winds, and the difficulties of landing and disembarking on the small rugged island.

<text>Experimental evolution is the use of laboratory experiments or controlled field manipulations to explore evolutionary dynamics. Evolution may be observed in the laboratory as individuals/populations adapt to new environmental conditions by natural selection. 

There are two different ways in which adaptation can arise in experimental evolution. One is via an individual organism gaining a novel beneficial mutation. The other is from allele frequency change in standing genetic variation already present in a population of organisms. Other evolutionary forces outside of mutation and natural selection can also play a role or be incorporated into experimental evolution studies, such as genetic drift and gene flow.

The organism used is decided by the experimenter, based on the hypothesis to be tested. Many generations are required for adaptive mutation to occur, and experimental evolution via mutation is carried out in viruses or unicellular organisms with rapid generation times, such as bacteria and asexual clonal yeast. Polymorphic populations of asexual or sexual yeast, and multicellular eukaryotes like Drosophila, can adapt to new environments through allele frequency change in standing genetic variation. Organisms with longer generations times, although costly, can be used in experimental evolution. Laboratory studies with foxes and with rodents (see below) have shown that notable adaptations can occur within as few as 10–20 generations and experiments with wild guppies have observed adaptations within comparable numbers of generations.

More recently, experimentally evolved individuals or populations are often analyzed using whole genome sequencing, an approach known as Evolve and Resequence (E&amp;R). E&amp;R can identify mutations that lead to adaptation in clonal individuals or identify alleles that changed in frequency in polymorphic populations, by comparing the sequences of individuals/populations before and after adaptation. The sequence data makes it possible to pinpoint the site in a DNA sequence that a mutation/allele frequency change occurred to bring about adaptation. The nature of the adaptation and functional follow up studies can shed insight into what effect the mutation/allele has on phenotype.

== History ==

=== Domestication and breeding ===

Unwittingly, humans have carried out evolution experiments for as long as they have been domesticating plants and animals. Selective breeding of plants and animals has led to varieties that differ dramatically from their original wild-type ancestors. Examples are the cabbage varieties, maize, or the large number of different dog breeds. The power of human breeding to create varieties with extreme differences from a single species was already recognized by Charles Darwin. In fact, he started out his book &quot;The Origin of Species&quot; with a chapter on variation in domestic animals. In this chapter, Darwin discussed in particular the pigeon.
=== Early ===

One of the first to carry out a controlled evolution experiment was William Dallinger. In the late 19th century, he cultivated small unicellular organisms in a custom-built incubator over a time period of seven years (1880–1886). Dallinger slowly increased the temperature of the incubator from an initial 60 °F up to 158 °F. The early cultures had shown clear signs of distress at a temperature of 73 °F, and were certainly not capable of surviving at 158 °F. The organisms Dallinger had in his incubator at the end of the experiment, on the other hand, were perfectly fine at 158 °F. However, these organisms would no longer grow at the initial 60 °F. Dallinger concluded that he had found evidence for Darwinian adaptation in his incubator, and that the organisms had adapted to live in a high-temperature environment. Dallinger&#x27;s incubator was accidentally destroyed in 1886, and Dallinger could not continue this line of research.

From the 1880s to 1980, experimental evolution was intermittently practiced by a variety of evolutionary biologists, including the highly influential Theodosius Dobzhansky. Like other experimental research in evolutionary biology during this period, much of this work lacked extensive replication and was carried out only for relatively short periods of evolutionary time.

== Modern ==

Experimental evolution has been used in various formats to understand underlying evolutionary processes in a controlled system. Experimental evolution has been performed on multicellular and unicellular eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and viruses. Similar works have also been performed by directed evolution of individual enzyme, ribozyme and replicator genes.

===Aphids===

In the 1950s, the Soviet biologist Georgy Shaposhnikov conducted experiments on aphids of the genus. By transferring them to plants normally nearly or completely unsuitable for them, he had forced populations of parthenogenetic descendants to adapt to the new food source to the point of reproductive isolation from the regular populations of the same species.

=== Fruit flies ===
One of the first of a new wave of experiments using this strategy was the laboratory &quot;evolutionary radiation&quot; of &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; populations that Michael R. Rose started in February, 1980. This system started with ten populations, five cultured at later ages, and five cultured at early ages. Since then more than 200 different populations have been created in this laboratory radiation, with selection targeting multiple characters. Some of these highly differentiated populations have also been selected &quot;backward&quot; or &quot;in reverse,&quot; by returning experimental populations to their ancestral culture regime. Hundreds of people have worked with these populations over the better part of three decades. Much of this work is summarized in the papers collected in the book &quot;Methuselah Flies&quot;.

The early experiments in flies were limited to studying phenotypes but the molecular mechanisms, i.e., changes in DNA that facilitated such changes, could not be identified. This changed with genomics technology. Subsequently, Thomas Turner coined the term Evolve and Resequence (E&amp;R) and several studies used E&amp;R approach with mixed success. One of the more interesting experimental evolution studies was conducted by Gabriel Haddad&#x27;s group at UC San Diego, where Haddad and colleagues evolved flies to adapt to low oxygen environments, also known as hypoxia. After 200 generations, they used E&amp;R approach to identify genomic regions that were selected by natural selection in the hypoxia adapted flies. More recent experiments are following up E&amp;R predictions with RNAseq and genetic crosses. Such efforts in combining E&amp;R with experimental validations should be powerful in identifying genes that regulate adaptation in flies. 

Much recently the experimental evolution in flies have taken the course to address the molecular mechanisms and in doing so it might pave way to understand physiology of an organism better and thus redefine disease therapeutics.

=== Microbes ===

Many microbial species have short generation times, easily sequenced genomes, and well-understood biology. They are therefore commonly used for experimental evolution studies. The bacterial species most commonly used for experimental evolution include &quot;P. fluorescens&quot;, &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;, &quot;Enterococcus faecalis&quot; and &quot;E. coli&quot; (see below), while the Yeast &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; has been used as a model for the study of eukaryotic evolution.

==== Lenski&#x27;s &quot;E. coli&quot; experiment ====

One of the most widely known examples of laboratory bacterial evolution is the long-term &quot;E.coli&quot; experiment of Richard Lenski. On February 24, 1988, Lenski started growing twelve lineages of &quot;E. coli&quot; under identical growth conditions. When one of the populations evolved the ability to aerobically metabolize citrate from the growth medium and showed greatly increased growth, this provided a dramatic observation of evolution in action. The experiment continues to this day, and is now the longest-running (in terms of generations) controlled evolution experiment ever undertaken. Since the inception of the experiment, the bacteria have grown for more than 60,000 generations. Lenski and colleagues regularly publish updates on the status of the experiments.

=== &quot;Leishmania donovani&quot; ===
Bussotti and collaborators isolated amastigotes from &quot;Leishmania donovani&quot; and cultured them in vitro for 3800 generations (36 weeks). The culture of these parasites showed how they adapted to in vitro conditions by compensating for the loss of a NIMA-related kinase, important for the correct progression of mitosis, by increasing the expression of another orthologous kinase as the culture generations progressed. Furthermore, it was observed how &quot;L. donovani&quot; has been adapted to in vitro culture by reducing the expression of 23 transcripts related to flagellar biogenesis and increasing the expression of ribosomal protein clusters and non-coding RNAs such as nucleolar small RNAs. Flagella are considered less necessary by the parasite in in vitro culture and therefore the progression of generations leads to their elimination, causing an energy saving due to lower motility so that proliferation and growth rate in culture is higher. The amplified snoRNAs also lead to increased ribosomal biosynthesis, increased protein biosynthesis and thus increased growth rate of the culture. These adaptations observed over generations of parasites are governed by copy number variations (CNV) and epistatic interactions between affected genes, and allow us to justify &quot;Leishmania&quot; genomic instability through its post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.

=== High Runner laboratory house mice ===
In 1993, Theodore Garland, Jr. and colleagues started a long-term experiment that involves selective breeding of mice for high voluntary activity levels on running wheels. This experiment also continues to this day (&gt; 105 generations). Mice from the four replicate &quot;High Runner&quot; lines evolved to run almost three times as many running-wheel revolutions per day compared with the four unselected control lines of mice, mainly by running faster than the control mice rather than running for more minutes/day. However, the High Runner lines have evolved in somewhat different ways, with some emphasizing running speed versus duration or vice versa, thus demonstrating &quot;multiple solutions&quot; 

that seem to be based partly in evolved muscle characteristics.

The HR mice have an elevated endurance running ability
and maximal aerobic capacity 
 when tested on a motorized treadmill. They also exhibit alterations in motivation and the reward system of the brain. Pharmacological studies point to alterations in dopamine function and the endocannabinoid system. The High Runner lines have been proposed as a model to study human attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and administration of Ritalin reduces their wheel running approximately to the levels of control mice.

=== Multidirectional selection on bank voles ===
In 2005 Paweł Koteja with Edyta Sadowska and colleagues from the Jagiellonian University (Poland) started a multidirectional selection on a non-laboratory rodent, the bank vole &quot;Myodes (= Clethrionomys) glareolus&quot;. The voles are selected for three distinct traits, which played important roles in the adaptive radiation of terrestrial vertebrates: high maximum rate of aerobic metabolism, predatory propensity, and herbivorous capability. Aerobic lines are selected for the maximum rate of oxygen consumption achieved during swimming at 38°C; Predatory lines – for a short time to catch live crickets; Herbivorous lines – for capability to maintain body mass when fed a low-quality diet “diluted” with dried, powdered grass. Four replicate lines are maintained for each of the three selection directions and another four as unselected Controls.

After approximately 20 generations of selective breeding, voles from the Aerobic lines evolved a 60% higher swim-induced metabolic rate than voles from the unselected Control lines. Although the selection protocol does not impose a thermoregulatory burden, both the basal metabolic rate and thermogenic capacity increased in the Aerobic lines. Thus, the results have provided some support for the “aerobic capacity model” for the evolution of endothermy in mammals.

More than 85% of the Predatory voles capture the crickets, compared to only about 15% of unselected Control voles, and they catch the crickets faster. The increased predatory behavior is associated with a more proactive coping style (“personality”).

During the test with low-quality diet, the Herbivorous voles lose approximately 2 grams less mass (approximately 10% of the original body mass) than the Control ones. The Herbivorous voles have an altered composition of the bacterial microbiome in their caecum. Thus, the selection has resulted in evolution of the entire holobiome, and the experiment may offer a laboratory model of hologenome evolution.

=== Synthetic biology ===
Synthetic biology offers unique opportunities for experimental evolution, facilitating the interpretation of evolutionary changes by inserting genetic modules into host genomes and applying selection specifically targeting such modules. Synthetic biological circuits inserted into the genome of Escherichia coli or the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae degrade (lose function) during laboratory evolution. With appropriate selection, mechanisms underlying the evolutionary regain of lost biological function can be studied. Experimental evolution of mammalian cells harboring synthetic gene circuits reveals the role of cellular heterogeneity in the evolution of drug resistance, with implications for chemotherapy resistance of cancer cells.

=== Other examples ===
Stickleback fish have both marine and freshwater species, the freshwater species evolving since the last ice age. Freshwater species can survive colder temperatures. Scientists tested to see if they could reproduce this evolution of cold-tolerance by keeping marine sticklebacks in cold freshwater. It took the marine sticklebacks only three generations to evolve to match the 2.5 degree Celsius improvement in cold-tolerance found in wild freshwater sticklebacks. 

Microbial cells and recently mammalian cells are evolved under nutrient limiting conditions to study their metabolic response and engineer cells for useful characteristics.

== For teaching ==
Because of their rapid generation times microbes offer an opportunity to study microevolution in the classroom. A number of exercises involving bacteria and yeast teach concepts ranging from the evolution of resistance to the evolution of multicellularity. With the advent of next-generation sequencing technology it has become possible for students to conduct an evolutionary experiment, sequence the evolved genomes, and to analyze and interpret the results.

<text>Madoc ab Owain Gwynedd (also spelled Madog) was, according to folklore, a Welsh prince who sailed to the Americas in 1170, over 300 years before Christopher Columbus&#x27;s voyage in 1492.

According to the story, Madoc was a son of Owain Gwynedd who went to sea to flee internecine violence at home. The &quot;Madoc story&quot; evolved from a medieval tradition about a Welsh hero&#x27;s sea voyage, to which only allusions survive. The story reached its greatest prominence during the Elizabethan era when English and Welsh writers wrote of the claim Madoc had gone to the Americas as an assertion of prior discovery, and hence legal possession, of North America by the Kingdom of England.

The Madoc story remained popular in later centuries, and a later development said Madoc&#x27;s voyagers had intermarried with local Native Americans, and that their Welsh-speaking descendants still live in the United States. These &quot;Welsh Indians&quot; were credited with the construction of landmarks in the Midwestern United States, and a number of white travellers were inspired to search for them. The Madoc story has been the subject of much fantasy in the context of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact theories. No archaeological, linguistic, or other evidence of Madoc or his voyages has been found in the New or Old World but legends connect him with certain sites, such as Devil&#x27;s Backbone on the Ohio River near Louisville, Kentucky.

==Family story==

Owain Gwynedd, who according to the legend was Madoc&#x27;s father, was a real 12th-century king of Gwynedd and is considered one of the greatest Welsh rulers of the Middle Ages. Owain&#x27;s reign was fraught with battles with other Welsh princes and with Henry II of England. At his death in 1170, a bloody dispute broke out between Owain&#x27;s heir Hywel the Poet-Prince, and Owain&#x27;s younger sons Maelgwn and Rhodri—children of the Princess-Dowager Cristen ferch Gronwy—and was led by Dafydd, the child of Gwladus ferch Llywarch. Owain had at least 13 children from his two wives and several more children were born out of wedlock but legally acknowledged under Welsh tradition. According to the legend, Madoc and his brother Rhirid or Rhiryd were among them, though no contemporary record attests to this.

===The name Madog===
The poet Llywarch ap Llywelyn of the 12th and 13th centuries did mention someone of this name as someone who fought in Conwy, North Wales, and in another poem reports one Madog to have been murdered.

==Voyages attestation==
===Mediaeval texts===

The earliest certain reference to a seafaring man named Madoc or Madog occurs in a by the Welsh poet Maredudd ap Rhys (fl. 1450–1483) of Powys that mentions a Madog who was a descendant of Owain Gwynedd and who voyaged to the sea. The poem is addressed to a local squire, thanking him on a patron&#x27;s behalf for a fishing net. Madog is referred to as &quot;Splendid Madog ... / Of Owain Gwynedd&#x27;s line, / He desired not land ... / Or worldly wealth but the sea&quot;.

In around 1250 to 1255, a Flemish writer called Willem identifies himself in his poem &quot;Van den Vos Reinaerde&quot; as &quot;Willem die Madoc maecte&quot; (Willem, the author of Madoc, known as &quot;Willem the Minstrel&quot;). Though no copies of Willem&#x27;s &quot;Madoc&quot; survive, according to Gwyn Williams: &quot;In the seventeenth century a fragment of a reputed copy of the work is said to have been found in Poitiers&quot;. The text provides no topographical details about North America but says Madoc, who is not related to Owain in the fragment, discovered an island paradise, where he intended &quot;to launch a new kingdom of love and music&quot;. There are also claims the Welsh poet and genealogist Gutun Owain wrote about Madoc before 1492. Gwyn Williams in &quot;Madoc, the Making of a Myth&quot; said Madoc is not mentioned in any of Gutun Owain&#x27;s surviving manuscripts.

===Elizabethan and Stuart claims to the New World===
The Madoc legend reached its greatest prominence during the Elizabethan era, when Welsh and English writers used it to bolster British claims in the New World against those of Spain. The earliest-surviving full account of Madoc&#x27;s voyage, the first to make the claim Madoc visited America before Columbus, appears in Humphrey Llwyd&#x27;s &quot;Cronica Walliae&quot; (published in 1559), an English adaptation of the &quot;Brut y Tywysogion&quot;.

John Dee used Llwyd&#x27;s manuscript when he submitted the treatise &quot;Title Royal&quot; to Queen Elizabeth I in 1580, which stated: &quot;The Lord Madoc, sonne to Owen Gwynned, Prince of Gwynedd, led a Colonie and inhabited in Terra Florida or thereabouts&quot; in 1170. The story was first published by George Peckham as &quot;A True Report of the late Discoveries of the Newfound Landes&quot; (1583) and, like Dee, it was used to support English claims to the Americas. The story was picked up in David Powel&#x27;s &quot;Historie of Cambria&quot; (1584), and Richard Hakluyt&#x27;s &quot;The Principall Navigations, Voiages and Discoveries of the English Nation&quot; (1589). According to Dee, not only Madoc, but also Brutus of Troy and King Arthur, had conquered lands in the Americas and therefore their heir Elizabeth I had a priority claim there.

According to the 1584 &quot;Historie of Cambria&quot; by David Powel, Madoc was disheartened by this family fighting, and he and Rhirid set sail from Llandrillo (Rhos-on-Sea) in the cantref of Rhos to explore the western ocean. In 1170, they purportedly discovered a distant, abundant land where about 100 men, women and children disembarked to form a colony. According to &quot;Cronica Walliae&quot; and many works derived from it, Madoc and some others returned to Wales to recruit additional settlers. After gathering eleven ships and 120 men, women and children, Madoc and his recruiters sailed west a second time to &quot;that Westerne countrie&quot;, and ported in &quot;Mexico&quot;, a claim Reuben T. Durrett cited in his work &quot;Traditions of the earliest visits of foreigners to north America&quot;, and stated Madoc never returned again to Wales.

In 1624, John Smith, a historian of Virginia, used the &quot;Chronicles of Wales&quot; to report that Madoc went to the New World in 1170, over 300 years before Columbus, with some men and women. Smith says the &quot;Chronicles&quot; say Madoc returned to Wales to get more people and traveled back to the New World. In the late 1600s, Thomas Herbert popularised the stories told by Dee and Powel, adding more detail from unknown sources, suggesting Madoc may have landed in Canada, Florida, or Mexico, and reporting Mexican sources stated they used currachs.

===&quot;Welsh Indians&quot; as potential descendants===
As immigrants came into contact with more groups of Native Americans in the United States, at least thirteen real tribes, five unidentified tribes, and three unnamed tribes have been suggested as &quot;Welsh Indians&quot;. Eventually, the legend settled on identifying the Welsh Indians with the Mandan people, who were said to differ from their neighbours in culture, language, and appearance. Nevertheless, historians of early America, notably including Samuel Eliot Morison agree that the voyage story is fictional. 

On 26 November 1608, Peter Wynne, a member of Captain Christopher Newport&#x27;s exploration party to the villages of the Monacan people—Virginia Siouan speakers above the falls of the James River in Virginia—wrote a letter to John Egerton informing him some members of Newport&#x27;s party believed the pronunciation of the Monacans&#x27; language resembled &quot;Welch&quot;, which Wynne spoke, and asked Wynne to act as an interpreter. The Monacan were among those non-Algonquian tribes the Algonquians collectively referred to as &quot;Mandoag&quot;. The Monacan tribe spoke to Wynne about the lore of the Moon-eyed people who were short bearded men with blue eyes and pale skin, they were sensitive to light and only emerged at night. The story has been associated with the legend of the Welsh settlement of Madog in the Great Smoky Mountains within the Appalachian Mountains. 

The Reverend Morgan Jones told Thomas Lloyd, William Penn&#x27;s deputy, he had been captured in 1669 in North Carolina by members of a tribe identified as the Doeg, who were said to be a part of the Tuscarora. There is no evidence the Doeg proper were part of the Tuscarora.) According to Jones, the chief spared his life when he heard Jones speak Welsh, which he understood. Jones&#x27; report says he lived for several months with the Doeg, preaching the Gospel in Welsh, and then returned to the British Colonies, where he recorded his adventure in 1686. Jones&#x27;s text was printed by &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, launching a slew of publications on the subject. The historian Gwyn A. Williams commented: &quot;This is a complete and may have been intended as a hoax&quot;. 

Thomas Jefferson had heard of Welsh-speaking Indian tribes. In a letter written to Meriwether Lewis on 22 January 1804, Jefferson wrote of searching for the Welsh Indians who were &quot;said to be up the Missouri&quot;. The historian Stephen E. Ambrose wrote in his history book &quot;Undaunted Courage&quot; Jefferson believed the &quot;Madoc story&quot; to be true, and instructed the Lewis and Clark Expedition to find the descendants of the Madoc Welsh Indians. Neither they nor John Evans found any.

In 1810, John Sevier, the first Governor of Tennessee, wrote to his friend Major Amos Stoddard about a conversation he had in 1782 with the Cherokee chief Oconostota concerning ancient fortifications along the Alabama River. According to Sevier, the chief said the forts were built by a white people called &quot;Welsh&quot; as protection against the ancestors of the Cherokee, who eventually drove them from the region. In 1799, Sevier had written of the discovery of six skeletons in brass armour bearing the coat of arms of Wales, and that Madoc and the Welsh were first in Alabama.

In 1824, Thomas S. Hinde wrote a letter to John S. Williams, editor of &quot;The American Pioneer&quot;, regarding the Madoc tradition. In the letter, Hinde claimed to have gathered testimony from sources that stated Welsh people under Owen Ap Zuinch had travelled to America in the twelfth century, over 300 years before Christopher Columbus. According to Hinde, in 1799 near Jeffersonville, Indiana on the Ohio River, six soldiers were exhumed with breastplates that bore Welsh coats of arms.

At least thirteen real tribes, five unidentified tribes, and three unnamed tribes have been suggested as &quot;Welsh Indians&quot;. The legend eventually settled on identifying the Welsh Indians with the Mandan people, who were said to differ from their neighbours in culture, language, and appearance. According to the painter George Catlin in &quot;North American Indians&quot; (1841), the Mandans were descendants of Madoc and his fellow voyagers; Catlin found the round Mandan Bull Boat similar to the Welsh coracle, and he thought the advanced architecture of Mandan villages must have been learnt from Europeans; advanced North American societies such as the Mississippian and Hopewell traditions were not well known in Catlin&#x27;s time. Supporters of this claim have drawn links between Madoc and the Mandan mythological figure &quot;Lone Man&quot; who, according to one tale, protected some villagers from a flooding river with a wooden corral.

The Welsh Indian legend was revived in the 1840s and 1850s; this time, George Ruxton (Hopis, 1846), P. G. S. Ten Broeck (Zunis, 1854), and Abbé Emmanuel Domenach (Zunis, 1860), among others, claimed the Zunis, Hopis, and Navajo were of Welsh descent. Brigham Young became interested in the supposed Hopi-Welsh connection; in 1858, Young sent a Welshman with Jacob Hamblin to the Hopi mesas to check for Welsh-speakers there. None were found but in 1863, Hamblin took three Hopi men to Salt Lake City, where they were &quot;besieged by Welshmen wanting them to utter Celtic words&quot;, to no avail. Llewelyn Harris, a Welsh-American Mormon missionary who visited the Zuni in 1878, wrote they had many Welsh words in their language, and that they claimed their descent from the &quot;Cambaraga&quot;—white men who had arrived by sea 300 years before the Spanish. Harris&#x27;s claims have never been independently verified.

===Modern developments===

According to Fritze (1993), Madoc&#x27;s landing place has been suggested to be &quot;Mobile, Alabama; Florida; Newfoundland; Newport, Rhode Island; Yarmouth, Nova Scotia; Virginia; points in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean including the mouth of the Mississippi River; the Yucatan; the isthmus of Tehuantepec, Panama; the Caribbean coast of South America; various islands in the West Indies and the Bahamas along with Bermuda; and the mouth of the Amazon River&quot;. Madoc&#x27;s people are reported to be the founders of various civilisations such as the Aztec, the Maya, and the Inca.

====American settlement myths====
The tradition of Madoc&#x27;s purported voyage was he left Wales in 1170 to land in Mobile Bay in Alabama, USA and then travelled up the Coosa River which connects several southern counties of Alabama, Tennessee and Georgia. A legend passed down through generations of American Indians was of &#x27;yellow-haired giants&#x27; who had briefly settled in Tennessee, then moved to Kentucky and then Southern Indiana, also involving the area of Southern Ohio, all of which became known as &quot;The Dark and Forbidden Land&quot;, specifically the area of &quot;Devil&#x27;s Backbone&quot; on the Ohio River. The story was passed on from the native American Chief Tobacco of the Piankeshaw tribe to George Rogers Clark who settled the city Clarksville, Indiana around the 1800s. The Chief spoke of a great battle between White and Red Indians, where the White Indians were slain. Supposedly, a graveyard of thousands of skeletons was found by Maj. John Harrison, but later washed away in a flood. Clark and the early settlers of his county had found European armor-clad skeletons thought to be ancient Welshmen, as well as ancient coins. According to local Cherokee tradition, the medieval settlers intermarried with the natives in Chattanooga, Tennessee and built stone forts there. It was said the modern 19th century settlers found Natives throughout the area who could converse in the Welsh language. Details of the discoveries are as follows:

*According to a folk tradition, a site called &quot;Devil&#x27;s Backbone&quot; at Rose Island, about upstream from Louisville, Kentucky, was once home to a colony of Welsh-speaking Indians. The eighteenth-century Missouri River explorer John Evans of Waunfawr in Wales took up his journey in part to find the Welsh-descended &quot;Padoucas&quot; or &quot;Madogwys&quot; tribes.

*In north-west Georgia, legends of the Welsh have become part of a myth surrounding the unknown origin of a rock formation on Fort Mountain. According to the historian Gwyn A. Williams, author of &quot;Madoc: The Making of a Myth&quot;, a Cherokee tradition concerning that ruin may have been influenced by contemporaneous European-American legends of &quot;Welsh Indians&quot;. The Georgia-based journalist Walter Putnam mentioned the Madoc legend in 2008. The story of Welsh explorers is one of several legends about that site.

*In north-eastern Alabama, there is a story the Welsh Caves in DeSoto State Park were built by Madoc&#x27;s party; local native tribes were not known to have practices such stonework or excavation that was found on the site.

==Legacy==
Modern commemorations in honour of Madog ap Owain Gwynedd:

*In the United Kingdom during the early 1800s, a Member of Parliament for Boston, Lincolnshire and industrialist, William Alexander Madocks developed the area called Traeth Mawr into the towns of &quot;Madock&#x27;s Port&quot; and &quot;Madock&#x27;s Town&quot; in the Welsh county of Gwynedd. But in recent years, the towns assumed the Welsh naming of Porthmadog (port) and Tremadog (town) in honour of . The association with Prince Madoc and the towns is that he supposedly returned to Wales and was buried in the area that is now known as the town of Porthmadog.

*The township of Madoc, Ontario, and the nearby village of Madoc in Canada (North America) are both named in the prince&#x27;s memory. As are several local guest houses and pubs throughout North America and the United Kingdom.
*In Rhos-on-Sea, Wales (UK), a boat-themed bench, sculpture and plaque introduced in 2023 commemorates the location where Prince Madog sailed from on his voyage. The plaque reads:

*The research vessel RV &quot;Prince Madog&quot;, which is owned by Bangor University and P&amp;O Maritime, entered service in 2001, replacing an earlier research vessel of the same name that first entered service in 1968.

*In 1953, the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) erected a plaque at Fort Morgan on the shore of Mobile Bay, Alabama, reading: &quot;In memory of Prince Madoc a Welsh explorer who landed on the shores of Mobile Bay in 1170 and left behind with the Indians the Welsh language&quot;. Alabama Parks Service removed the plaque in 2008, either because of a hurricane or because the site focuses on the period 1800 to 1945, and put in storage. It is now on display at the DAR headquarters in Mobile, Alabama.

*The plaque cites Sevier&#x27;s claims about the &quot;people called Welsh&quot;. A similar plaque was placed in Fort Mountain State Park, Georgia, at the supposed site of one of Madoc&#x27;s three stone fortresses. This plaque was removed in 2015 and the replacement does not mention Madoc.

====Poetry====
Madoc&#x27;s legend has been a notable subject for poets, however. The most famous account in English is Robert Southey&#x27;s long 1805 poem &quot;Madoc&quot;, which uses the story to explore the poet&#x27;s freethinking and egalitarian ideals. He had heard his story from Dr. W O Pughe. Southey wrote &quot;Madoc&quot; to help finance a trip of his own to America, where he and Samuel Taylor Coleridge hoped to establish a Utopian state they called a &quot;Pantisocracy&quot;. Southey&#x27;s poem in turn inspired the twentieth-century poet Paul Muldoon to write &quot;Madoc: A Mystery&quot;, which won the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize in 1992. It explores what might have happened if Southey and Coleridge had succeeded in coming to America to found their &quot;ideal state&quot;.

In Russian, the noted poet Alexander S. Pushkin composed a short poem &quot;Madoc in Wales&quot; (Медок в Уаллах, 1829) on the topic.

<text>Brad McQuaid (April 25, 1969 – November 18, 2019) was an American video game designer who was the key designer of &quot;EverQuest&quot;, a highly successful massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) released in 1999. He later co-founded Sigil Games Online where he was CEO and executive producer of &quot;&quot; until Sony Online Entertainment&#x27;s acquisition of Sigil Games Online in May 2007. On July 6, 2012, SOE announced the re-hiring of McQuaid to continue his work on Vanguard. On January 13, 2014, McQuaid announced his role of Chief Creative Officer at Visionary Realms, Inc. for the PC MMORPG, &quot;&quot;.

==Biography==

===EverQuest===
Brad McQuaid&#x27;s start in the video game industry came in 1989 when he co-founded MicroGenesis with Steve Clover. In their free time they created &quot;WarWizard&quot;, a shareware role-playing video game that they released in 1993. McQuaid and Clover then developed a &quot;WarWizard 2&quot; demo in 1995, which caught the attention of John Smedley of Sony Interactive Studios America. Smedley hired McQuaid and Clover in 1996 to work on an online role-playing game, later named &quot;EverQuest&quot;.

McQuaid started as the project&#x27;s lead programmer but was made the producer and one of the lead designers. While &quot;EverQuest&quot; was being developed, Origin Systems launched &quot;Ultima Online&quot; in 1997 which became the top MMORPG. &quot;EverQuest&quot; became a huge hit and within months of its March 1999 launch it topped the subscription numbers held by &quot;Ultima Online&quot;. &quot;PC Gamer&quot; called McQuaid one of the &quot;Next Game Gods&quot; in its November 2000 issue, believing that he would eventually become one of the industry&#x27;s most influential game developers. After Sony Online Entertainment acquired Verant Interactive, Brad McQuaid was promoted to Vice President of Premium Games and Chief Creative Officer.

===Vanguard: Saga of Heroes===
He left Sony to create Sigil Games with fellow game designer and EverQuest development team member Jeff Butler in January 2002. Several years later, McQuaid announced that Sigil would release a new &quot;next generation&quot; MMORPG. This game was given the name &quot;&quot;.

The game was released to the public in January 2007, five years after Sigil was founded. Brad McQuaid admitted that the game was not ready in January but was released early due to &quot;financial resources&quot;.Full quote

On May 15, 2007, Sony Online Entertainment officially announced that it had purchased the key assets of Sigil Games Online. Brad McQuaid resigned from his position of leadership within Sigil and was given a role of creative consultant.

===Later years===
On July 6, 2012, Sony Online Entertainment announced the re-hiring of McQuaid to continue work on &quot;Vanguard&quot; including its free-to-play transition.

On March 6, 2013, McQuaid announced that he had returned to working on EverQuest.

On September 9, 2013, McQuaid released a statement saying that he had left SOE, but would continue to work with them. This news, coupled with a string of hints dropped throughout Twitter and various message board posts, led the community to believe that McQuaid intended to work on a true spiritual successor to EverQuest and Vanguard independently. On January 13, 2014, the game was announced as Visionary Realms&#x27; &quot;&quot; alongside a Kickstarter campaign, with McQuaid as chief creative officer.

McQuaid died at his home on November 18, 2019, aged 50. No public information about his cause of death has been released.

<doc id="796432" wikidata="Q119942" url="?curid=796432" title="X-Seed 4000">
<text>The X-Seed 4000 was a concept for a megatall skyscraper. Its proposed height, sea-base, and 800-floor capacity could accommodate 500,000-1,000,000 inhabitants. This structure would have been composed of over of steel.

It was designed for Tokyo, Japan, by the Taisei Corporation in 1995 as a futuristic environment combining ultra-modern and technological living and interaction with wildlife and nature. Methods of transportation within the X-seed would most likely include Maglev trains.

Georges Binder, managing director of Buildings &amp; Data, a firm which compiles data banks on buildings worldwide, said the X-Seed 4000 &quot;is never meant to be built[...] the purpose of the plan was to earn some recognition for the firm, and it worked.&quot;

Unlike conventional skyscrapers, to remain habitable the X-Seed 4000 would have been forced to actively protect its occupants from considerable internal air pressure and external air pressure gradations and weather fluctuations that its massive elevation would cause. Its design called for the use of solar power to maintain internal environmental conditions. As the proposed site for the structure is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, the most active volcano range in the world, the X-Seed 4000 would have been vulnerable to earthquakes and tsunamis.

A sea-based location and a Mount Fuji shape were some of this building&#x27;s other major design features—Mount Fuji itself is high, making it shorter than the X-Seed 4000.

The X-Seed 4000 was projected to be twice the height of the Shimizu Mega-City Pyramid at . 
The Shimizu Mega-City Pyramid (also planned for Tokyo, Japan) faces most of the same problems as the X-Seed. Other projects that, if built, could be in the top five human-made structures are the Ultima Tower of in San Francisco, Dubai City Tower of and the Bionic Tower of in either Hong Kong or Shanghai.

<text>WUML (91.5 FM) is a non-commercial college radio station licensed to Lowell, Massachusetts, United States. The station is owned by the University of Massachusetts Lowell. The transmitter is atop Fox Hall on Pawtucket Street in Lowell.

==History==

WUML was started in 1952 by Ed Bonacci, a student attending what was then called the Lowell Technological Institute. After accidentally building a transmitter in his dorm room, a studio was built in Kitson Hall, with a 5-10 watt transmitter located in the basement of the old library. At exactly 7:00 pm on January 15, 1953, the newly christened WLTI began broadcasting on carrier current over electrical power wires specifically to Eames and Smith Hall, as well as Alumni Library on the University&#x27;s North Campus.

During the summer of 1953, permanent station consoles were built and readied for the moving of the studio from Kitson Hall to the basement of Eames Hall, which at that time was being used as a trunk room.

On November 26, 1967, WLTI became a Federal Communications Commission (FCC)-licensed and regulated educational FM station broadcasting on air at its current frequency of 91.5 FM, using 10-watt transmitter and antenna capable of reaching Cumnock, Southwick, Leitch, and Bourgeois Halls.

Construction on new facilities in the basement of Lydon Library began in 1969 and were completed in 1971, before being renovated in 2005. Currently located in Lydon, the station contains two studios (one responsible for broadcasting) as well as the Fallout Shelter, a live studio for acts to perform on air. Credited to Chris Porter and Bob Weston, the creation of the Fallout Shelter brought acts such as Pixies, Frank Zappa, Cheech &amp; Chong, Jorge Santana, and Jethro Tull as well as many others through the years, and it continues to operate during Live from the Fallout Shelter on Monday nights.

WLTI changed its call sign to WJUL on November 1, 1976, after the Lowell Technological Institute merged with Lowell State College in 1975 to form the University of Lowell. The station changed its call sign once again on October 15, 2003, to its current WUML in order to display the UML title the school received after joining the University of Massachusetts system in 1991.

In the mid-2000s, a morning show, Lowell Sunrise, was added to the schedule. It was produced by paid professional staff and managed by the university itself, rather than the undergraduate student organization. The show itself was meant to have a format somewhere between that of National Public Radio and AM commercial morning drive-time talk shows. However, following the failure of talent brought in from &quot;The Sun&quot;, which worked on the show to try and generate interest from local listeners, the university administration took over programming of Lowell Sunrise. Soon afterwards, the broadcast window was cut even further due to personnel/budgeting constraints, and UMass Lowell cancelled the show altogether, returning all broadcast hours, budget dollars and station management to the students.

A secondary plan to boost community interest was launched by the university in May 2005. Professional radio host Christopher Lydon was hired to create a new show called Open Source to air on WUML and be syndicated to some 700 radio stations through Public Radio International. Once again, there was no student input on the addition of Lydon or the new programming. Failure of the show to capture an audience with the proper size and demographics necessary for it to be considered successful resulted in control once again being handed back to the students.

==Programming==

WUML aims to showcase underground artists of all genres and to provide a voice for the Lowell community. The broadcast week includes programming produced by UMass Lowell students and by community hosts who represent the ethnically and linguistically diverse community of Lowell; among the languages that can be heard are Hindi, Khmer, Spanish, Portuguese, Laotian, and French.

Student programming is broadcast during the week and includes musical genres such as rock, folk, jazz, Latin, electronic, blues, and metal. Community programming is broadcast on the weekends. The station also broadcasts the Morning Drive-By, a variety music and news show aimed towards commuters, and Thinking Out Loud, a daytime show focusing on current local and world issues.

The members of WUML produce new shows every semester; some of the longer-running shows include Gunjan Radio (on-air since 1983), the Stress Factor, Live from the Fallout Shelter, and Blues Deluxe. WUML programming is also available online via streaming audio through links provided on its website. The streaming audio is available at various bit rates (for slow and high speed connections) in MP3 and Ogg formats.

WUML is involved in UMass Lowell athletics; the station features live broadcasts of the UMass Lowell River Hawks men&#x27;s ice hockey games, including Hockey East championship games at TD Garden in Boston, as well as shows dedicated to the discussion of current campus sports.

The station also hosts Rock for Tots, a live music event designed to raise money for local charities. Past headliners include Sidney Gish, Horse Jumper of Love, The World Is a Beautiful Place &amp; I Am No Longer Afraid to Die, A Great Big Pile of Leaves, A Wilhelm Scream, Titus Andronicus, Apollo Sunshine, and Ted Leo.

<text>The Conspiracy of the Equals () of May 1796 was a failed coup d&#x27;etat during the French Revolution. It was led by François-Noël Babeuf, who wanted to overthrow the Directory and replace it with an egalitarian and proto-socialist republic, inspired by Jacobin ideals.

== Background ==
It was the attempts of the Directory to deal with the economic crisis that gave Babeuf his historical importance. The new government was pledged to abolish the system by which Paris was fed at the expense of all France, and the cessation of the distribution of bread and meat at nominal prices was fixed for 20 February 1796. The announcement caused the most widespread consternation. Not only were the workmen and the large class of proletarians attracted to Paris by the system, but &quot;rentiers&quot; and government officials, whose incomes were paid in &quot;assignats&quot; on a scale arbitrarily fixed by the government, saw themselves threatened with starvation. The government yielded to the outcry; but the expedients by which it sought to mitigate the evil, notably the division of those entitled to relief into classes, only increased the alarm and discontent.

The universal misery gave point to virulent attacks by Babeuf on the existing order, and gained him a hearing. He gathered around him a small circle of followers known as the &quot;Societé des égaux&quot;, soon merged with the rump of the Jacobin Club, who met at the Panthéon; and in November 1795 he was reported by the police to be openly preaching &quot;insurrection, revolt, and the constitution of 1793&quot;. 

Seven men joined Babeuf to direct the conspiracy: Philippe Buonarroti, Augustin Alexandre Darthé, Sylvain Maréchal - who was in charge of writing the manifesto - Félix Lepeletier, Pierre-Antoine Antonelle, Debon, and Georges Grisel. A network of military agents was created by Jean Antoine Rossignol, who placed revolutionary agents in every district of Paris. 

Philippe Buonarroti’s works and both demonstrate why he can be considered &quot;the major theoretician and ideologue of the Equals movement&quot;. Buonarroti believed that taking any political stance implied even taking action. He was one of the major exponents of Leftism at the end of the 18th Century, in France. Babeuf and he were both inside Plessis Jail in 1797. Buonarroti shared Babeuf’s principles about private property and advocated for an equally distributed and collaborative social scheme in France. He also believed that Italy was not ready yet for such a social reform.
== Ideas of the Conspiracy ==

The ultimate goal of François-Noël Babeuf and his comrades was absolute equality. The purpose of the Conspiracy was to continue revolution and to lead it to the collectivisation of lands and the means of production to ‘put an end to civil dissension and public poverty.’ They furthermore demanded the application of the Constitution of Year 1 (dating from 1793, the first constitution of the Republic, which was never applied). 

The ideas of the Conspiracy were particularly set forth in the Manifesto of Equals of 1796, which was written by Babeuf’s top aide Sylvain Maréchal. The manifesto advocated a radical reform of France which went further than the French Revolution&#x27;s Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen to enforce the practice of absolute equality across all aspects of society. Maréchal rejected the notion that equality before the law itself was sufficient to define societal equality, and thus placed a strong emphasis on the abolition of private property and equal access to food. The manifesto further denounced the privileged bourgeoisie who benefited from the Revolution such as the wealthy landowners who continued to profit off the ‘common good’ of land. Although the Conspiracy acknowledged the ‘selfish’ would oppose their aims to preserve their unjust privileges, their sacrifice of power was deemed necessary to enact real equality. 

The Manifesto additionally reads: ‘We aspire to live and die equal, the way we were born: we want real equality or death; this is what we need. And we’ll have this real equality, at whatever the cost.’ However, the Conspiracy failed to include colonial slaves into their manifesto’s thinking, and only championed equality for those they considered the ‘People of France’.

The Manifesto was not met with unanimous support from the directors of the revolt. Maréchal’s point ‘Let the arts perish, if need be, as long as real equality remains’ was especially contested.

== Growth ==

For a time the government, while keeping itself informed of his activities, left him alone. It suited the Directory to let the socialist agitation continue, in order to deter the people from joining in any royalist movement for the overthrow of the existing régime. Moreover the mass of the &quot;ouvriers&quot;, even of extreme views, were repelled by Babeuf&#x27;s bloodthirstiness; and the police agents reported that his agitation was making many converts - for the government. The Jacobin Club refused to admit Babeuf and René-François Lebois, on the ground that they were &quot;égorgeurs&quot; (&quot;throat-cutters&quot;).

With the development of the economic crisis, however, Babeuf&#x27;s influence increased. After the club of the Panthéon was closed by Napoleon Bonaparte on 27 February 1796, his aggressive activity redoubled. In Ventôse and Germinal (roughly late winter and early spring) he published, under the pen name of &quot;Lalande, soldat de la patrie&quot;, a new paper, the &quot;Eclaireur du Peuple, ou le Défenseur de Vingt-Cinq Millions d&#x27;Opprimés&quot;, which was hawked clandestinely from group to group in the streets of Paris.

At the same time Issue 40 of the &quot;Tribun&quot; excited an immense sensation. In this Babeuf praised the authors of the September Massacres as &quot;deserving well of their country&quot;, and declared that a more complete &quot;2 September&quot; was needed to annihilate the actual government, which consisted of &quot;starvers, bloodsuckers, tyrants, hangmen, rogues and mountebanks&quot;.

The distress among all classes continued; and in March the attempt of the Directory to replace the &quot;assignats&quot; by a new issue of &quot;mandats&quot; created fresh dissatisfaction after the breakdown of the hopes first raised. A cry went up that national bankruptcy had been declared, and thousands of the lower class of &quot;ouvriers&quot; began to rally to Babeuf&#x27;s flag. On 4 April 1796, the government received a report that 500,000 people in Paris were in need of relief. From 11 April, Paris was placarded with posters headed &quot;Analyse de la Doctrine de Baboeuf&quot; &quot;, Tribun du Peuple&quot;, of which the opening sentence ran: &quot;Nature has given to every man the right to the enjoyment of an equal share in all property&quot;, and which ended with a call to restore the Constitution of 1793.

The Arrondissements of Paris were thoroughly agitated by the propaganda of Equals, and Babeuf&#x27;s comrades no longer bothered to conceal their &quot;seditious activity&quot; in the eyes of the police. Babeuf&#x27;s song &quot;Mourant de faim, mourant de froid&quot; (&quot;Dying of Hunger, Dying of Cold&quot;), set to a popular tune, began to be sung in the &quot;cafés&quot;, with immense applause; and reports circulated that the disaffected troops of the French Revolutionary Army in the camp of Grenelle were ready to join an insurrection against the government. 

Philippe Buonarroti publicly read a draft decree proclaiming an egalitarian republic. The first words that were written declared: &quot;The people advanced, tyranny is no more. You are free&quot;. This project predicted that &quot;a large national community will be established in the republic&quot;. &quot;Intestacy and inheritance will be abolished: all property currently owned by private individuals will, upon their death, fall to the national community. &quot;The goods of the national community will be exploited collectively, by all its valid members. The national community will provide each of its members with decent accommodation, clothing, adequate food, and &quot;relief in the art of healing.&quot; Finally, &quot;the republic will no longer make money&quot;.

== Fall of the conspiracy ==

The conspiracy was denounced to the police for a fee, by one of its own leaders: Georges Grisel. Faced with the repression that then fell upon the democratic circles of Paris, several attempted to provoke an uprising, first within the police legion. The Directory considered that the Babouviste propaganda had dangerously agitated public opinion and, on May 2, 1796, it ordered the dismissal and disarmament of a police legion because: &quot;seduced by the Babouviste faction they became more undisciplined every day.&quot; After its dissolution, the Babouvistes turned to the soldiers of the &quot;21st Regiment of dragons&quot;, who were camped at Grenelle. 
The Directory thought it time to react; the &quot;bureau central&quot; had accumulated through its agents, notably the ex-captain Georges Grisel, who had been initiated into Babeuf’s society, complete evidence of a conspiracy for an armed rising fixed for Floréal 22, year IV (11 May 1796), in which Jacobins and socialists were combined. On 10 May Babeuf, who had taken the pseudonym &quot;Tissot&quot;, was arrested; many of his associates were gathered by the police on order from Lazare Carnot: among them were Augustin Alexandre Darthé and Philippe Buonarroti, the ex-members of the National Convention, Robert Lindet, Jean-Pierre-André Amar, Marc-Guillaume Alexis Vadier and Jean-Baptiste Drouet, famous as the postmaster of Sainte-Menehould who had arrested Louis XVI during the latter&#x27;s &quot;Flight to Varennes&quot;, and now a member of the Directory&#x27;s Council of Five Hundred. 245 arrest warrants were issued by Carnot, who intended to stop demands for equality.

The government crackdown was extremely successful. The last number of the &quot;Tribun&quot; appeared on 24 April, although René-François Lebois, in the &quot;Ami du peuple,&quot; tried to incite soldiers to revolt. For a while there were rumours of a military rising.

The trial of Babeuf and his accomplices was fixed to take place before the newly constituted high court of justice at Vendôme. On Fructidor 10 and 11 (27 August and 28 August 1796), when the prisoners were removed from Paris, there were tentative efforts at a riot with a view to rescue, but these were easily suppressed. The attempt of five or six hundred Jacobins (7 September 1796) to rouse the soldiers at Grenelle met with no better success. A shootout greeted them, leaving about 20 dead, 132 captured and many others wounded.

The trial of Babeuf and the others, begun at Vendôme on 20 February 1797, lasted two months. The government, for reasons of its own, depicted the socialist Babeuf as the leader of the conspiracy, even though people more important than himself were implicated. His own vanity played admirably into their hands. And Darthé, who remained in utter silence during the debates, was accused of writing an order for the execution of the Directors. On Prairial 7 (26 May 1797) Babeuf and Darthé were condemned to death. On hearing his death sentence, Babeuf struck himself in the courtroom with several blows, and was carried dying the next day to the scaffold. Darthé, who had also tried to commit suicide, was guillotined alongside him on at Vendôme, Prairial 8 (27 May 1797), without appeal. Some of the prisoners, including Buonarroti and Germain, were deported; the rest, including Vadier and his fellow former-Montagnards, were acquitted. Drouet escaped, according to Paul Barras, with the connivance of the Directory.

== Legacy ==
The Conspiracy of Equals would probably have disappeared in the flood of great events of the Revolution, but the publication in 1828 of Buonarroti&#x27;s book, &quot;Conspiracy of Equals&quot;, kept it in the history books. Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx recognized in the Conspiracy of Equals &quot;the first appearance of a truly active Communist party&quot;. Leon Trotsky would echo these sentiments, stating that the foundation of the Communist International marked a ‘carrying on in direct succession the heroic endeavours and martyrdom of a long line of revolutionary generations from Babeuf’.

The Conspiracy of Equals can be seen as the first example of a form of French leftism distinct from that of the Jacobins, more focused upon real equality as opposed to abstract equality in the eyes of the law. Whereas the French Revolutionaries actively sought to guarantee property rights, a guarantee enshrined in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, Babeuf and his followers desired instead the abolition of property entirely (‘We lean towards something more sublime and more just: the common good or the community of property! No more individual property in land: the land belongs to no one. We demand, we want, the common enjoyment of the fruits of the land: the fruits belong to all.’ This criticism of private property put forward by Babeuf and his fellow conspirators would go on to echo through later currents of French leftism: perhaps most pertinently in the thinking of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who famously declared ‘Property is theft!’.

Although the words &quot;anarchist&quot; and &quot;communist&quot; did not exist at the time of the conspiracy, they have both been used to describe its ideas by later scholars. The English word &quot;communism&quot; was coined by Goodwyn Barmby in a conversation with those he described as the &quot;disciples of Babeuf&quot;.

<doc id="796442" wikidata="Q1357381" url="?curid=796442" title="Logic bomb">
<text>A logic bomb is a piece of code intentionally inserted into a software system that will set off a malicious function when specified conditions are met. For example, a programmer may hide a piece of code that starts deleting files (such as a salary database trigger), should they ever be terminated from the company.

Software that is inherently malicious, such as viruses and worms, often contain logic bombs that execute a certain payload at a pre-defined time or when some other condition is met. This technique can be used by a virus or worm to gain momentum and spread before being noticed. Some viruses attack their host systems on specific dates, such as Friday the 13th or April Fools&#x27; Day. Trojans and other computer viruses that activate on certain dates are often called &quot;time bombs&quot;.

To be considered a logic bomb, the payload should be unwanted and unknown to the user of the software. As an example, trial programs with code that disables certain functionality after a set time are not normally regarded as logic bombs.

== Successful ==
*In June 2006 Roger Duronio, a system administrator for UBS, was charged with using a logic bomb to damage the company&#x27;s computer network, and with securities fraud for his failed plan to drive down the company&#x27;s stock with activation of the logic bomb. Duronio was later convicted and sentenced to 8 years and 1 month in prison, as well as a $3.1 million restitution to UBS.
*On 20 March 2013, in an attack launched against South Korea, a logic bomb struck machines and &quot;wiped the hard drives and master boot records of at least three banks and two media companies simultaneously.&quot; Symantec reported that the malware also contained a component that was capable of wiping Linux machines.
*On 19 July 2019, David Tinley, a contract employee, pleaded guilty for programming logic bombs within the software he created for Siemens Corporation. The software was intentionally made to malfunction after a certain amount of time, requiring the company to hire him to fix it for a fee. The logic bombs went undetected for two years, but were then discovered while he was out of town and had to hand over the administrative password to his software.
*In 2023, researchers discovered that some Newag trains were secretly programmed to deliberately break down after a certain distance, or during maintenance windows, or when onboard GPS confirmed they were located in rivals&#x27; workshops for repair.

== Attempted ==
*In February 2000, Tony Xiaotong Yu, indicted before a grand jury, was accused of planting a logic bomb during his employment as a programmer and securities trader at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. The bomb, planted in 1996, had a trigger date of 20 July 2000, but was discovered by other programmers in the company. Removing and cleaning up after the bomb allegedly took several months.
*On 2 October 2003 Yung-Hsun Lin, also known as Andy Lin, changed code on a server at Medco Health Solutions Inc.&#x27;s Fair Lawn, New Jersey headquarters, where he was employed as a Unix administrator, creating a logic bomb set to go off on his birthday in 2004. It failed to work due to a programming error, so Lin corrected the error and reset it to go off on his next birthday, but it was discovered and disabled by a Medco computer systems administrator a few months before the trigger date. Lin pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 30 months in jail in a federal prison in addition to $81,200 in restitution. The charges held a maximum sentence of 10 years and a fine of US$250,000.
*On 29 October 2008 a logic bomb was discovered at American mortgage giant Fannie Mae. The bomb was planted by Rajendrasinh Babubhai Makwana, an IT contractor who worked at Fannie Mae&#x27;s Urbana, Maryland facility. The bomb was set to activate on 31 January 2009 and could have wiped all of Fannie Mae&#x27;s 4000 servers. Makwana had been terminated around 1:00p.m. on 24 October 2008 and managed to plant the bomb before his network access was revoked. Makwana was indicted in a Maryland court on 27 January 2009 for unauthorized computer access, convicted on 4 October 2010, and sentenced to 41 months in prison on 17 December 2010.
*In October 2009, Douglas Duchak was terminated from his job as data analyst at the Colorado Springs Operations Center (CSOC) of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration. Surveillance cameras captured images of Duchak entering the facility after hours and loading a logic bomb onto a CSOC server that stored data from the U.S. Marshals. In January 2011, Duchak was sentenced to two years in prison, $60,587 in fines, and three years on probation. At his sentencing, Duchak tearfully apologized as his lawyer noted that at the time of the incident, Duchak&#x27;s wife was pregnant with their second child. The judge at the sentencing mentioned that this logic bomb planting &quot;incident was an anomaly in an otherwise untarnished work history.&quot;

== Alleged ==
Thomas C. Reed wrote in his 2004 book &quot;At the Abyss: An Insider&#x27;s History of the Cold War&quot; that in 1982, a sabotage occurred on the Trans-Siberian Pipeline because of a logic bomb. According to Reed, a KGB operative stole the plans for a sophisticated control system and its software from a Canadian firm, for use on its Siberian pipeline. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was tipped off by documents in the Farewell Dossier, and had the company insert a logic bomb in the program for sabotage purposes. Critics have contested the authenticity of this account, and it was reported that the story may be a hoax.

<text>Yancheng (), formerly known as Yandu, is a prefecture-level city in the eastern coastal Jiangsu province, People&#x27;s Republic of China. As the city with the largest jurisdictional area in Jiangsu, Yancheng borders Lianyungang to the north, Huai&#x27;an to the west, Yangzhou and Taizhou to the southwest, Nantong to the south, and the Yellow Sea to the east. Formerly a county, the current Yancheng city was founded on January 18, 1983.

Yancheng, literally &quot;Salt City&quot;, is named after the salt harvest fields surrounding the city. According to historical records, collection and production of sea salt in the region began as early as 119 BC, during the Western Han dynasty, when the settlement on the current location of Yancheng was named Yandu County (). According to the 2020 census, Yancheng had a registered population of 6,709,629, with 1,733,591 inhabitants in its built up area comprising the districts of Tinghu and Yandu.

It was named for the salt reserves in rivers around the area, its name literally meaning &quot;Salt City&quot;. In later years, the city was the home of Fan Zhongyan, the 12th century statesman and Shi Nai&#x27;an, the reputed author of famous novels.

Yancheng was in the limelight during the Chinese Civil War from the 1930s to 1940s. The New Fourth Army led by the Chinese Communist Party was reestablished in Yancheng after being ambushed and battered by the enemy. After the revival, the Army played a very important role in the war and finally the foundation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

<text>The Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire (), a hoop crown (Bügelkrone) with a characteristic octagonal shape, was the coronation crown of the Holy Roman Emperor, probably from the late 10th century until the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806. The crown was used in the coronation of the King of the Romans, the title assumed by the Emperor-elect immediately after his election. It is now kept in the Imperial Treasury (&quot;Kaiserliche Schatzkammer&quot;) at the Hofburg in Vienna, Austria.

==History==

The crown of eight hinged golden plates was probably made in Western Germany for the Imperial coronation of Otto I in 962, with what must be later additions which may have been made for Conrad II (since the arch is inscribed with the name &quot;CHVONRADUS&quot;). However, some medieval historians argue that the crown may have been commissioned at a later date. Whilst acknowledging that the crown is &quot;dated most frequently as a work of the second half of the tenth century&quot;, John B. Freed states that &quot;the inscriptions on the plaques have been dated for paleographical reasons as no earlier than the second half of the eleventh century&quot;, while the biblical verses that appear on three of the four plaques &quot;were first cited in royal charters only in the late eleventh and twelfth centuries&quot;, and proposes that the crown was instead made in preparation for the imperial coronation of Conrad III in Rome (although Conrad was ultimately never crowned as emperor). Freed also cites as evidence the title that appears on the crown, which is identical to how Conrad was styled in a &quot;letter he sent in 1142 to the Byzantine emperor&quot; John II Komnenos, and claims that &quot;the selection of the otherwise odd text from Isaiah 38:5 on the Hezekiah plaque makes the most sense if Conrad commissioned the crown&quot;, since he had become &quot;seriously ill during the Second Crusade&quot; and was suffering from tertian malaria, which &quot;hindered him [...] from carrying out his responsibilities from the end of August 1149 until April 1150.&quot; On the other hand, Reinhard Staats has &quot;interpreted the Isaiah text as a reminder to every monarch that his days were numbered&quot;, while Denise A. Kaiser has &quot;argued that Otto II commissioned the crown and that the Hezekiah plaque refers to Otto I&#x27;s recovery from a serious illness.&quot; The first preserved mention of the crown is from the 12th century, assuming (as is probable) that it is the same crown.

Most Kings of the Romans were crowned with it until the end of the Holy Roman Empire. The crown was the most important item of the Imperial Regalia (), which also included the Imperial Cross (), the Imperial Sword (), and the Holy Lance (). During the coronation, it was given to the new king along with the sceptre () and the Imperial Orb ().

===Heraldic crown of the German Empire===

The Imperial Crown was the inspiration for the German State Crown designed in 1871 for the arms of the German Empire and its Emperor. The latter, however, had four half-arches supporting a small orb and cross, rather than the single arch and front cross of the original.

The changes were made to differentiate the Wilhelmine crown from the one kept in Vienna (outside the German Empire), while simultaneously invoking the powerful legacy of the Holy Roman Empire. A now-lost wooden model was made, but no actual crown was produced until the Empire&#x27;s demise in 1918.

As a result it remained a heraldic crown only, even though it was also represented as if a real crown existed on that model, e.g. at the Niederwalddenkmal (1871-1883), in Hermann Wislicenus&#x27;s &quot;Apotheose of Empire&quot; painting at the Imperial Palace of Goslar (), or on the Weidendammer Bridge in Berlin (1896).

===Preservation===
The Crown was held in various locations during the first few centuries after its creation, including Limburg Abbey, Harzburg Castle, the Imperial Palace of Goslar, Trifels Castle, the , Waldburg Castle, Krautheim Castle, Kyburg Castle, Rheinfelden Castle, and the Alter Hof in Munich.

In 1349, Charles IV took the Imperial Regalia to the Karlstein Castle near Prague, which he had just built for that purpose. in 1424, with Bohemia suffering the troubles of the Hussite Wars, Sigismund had them relocated to Visegrád and then to Nuremberg, where they were permanently kept in the &quot;Heilig-Geist-Spital&quot; except for the time of coronations (in Aachen until 1531, then in Frankfurt from 1562).

In 1796, as the war with revolutionary France was threatening the entire fabric of the Empire, the Regalia were brought for safety to Saint Emmeram&#x27;s Abbey in Regensburg, and from there in 1800 to the Imperial capital in Vienna, where the Empire was abolished on 6 August 1806.

The crown and other Regalia remained in Vienna until the &quot;Anschluss&quot; of March 1938, when they were brought back to Nuremberg (this time in the &quot;Katharinenkirche&quot;) by Nazi Germany in line with their promotion of the city as repository of mythicized ancient German traditions. During World War II the crown was placed in the Historischer Kunstbunker, an underground vault of Nuremberg Castle.

Led by art historian Lt. Walter Horn, who joined the US military after becoming a naturalized citizen, American soldiers recovered the treasures in August 1945. They were returned to the Oesterreichische Nationalbank in allied-occupied Austria in January 1946. They have been kept permanently in Vienna since that date. The Crown and Regalia were again on display at the Hofburg in 1954. The current display dates from a comprehensive refurbishment of the Hofburg&#x27;s Treasury Vault in 1983-1987.

==Design==


The crown does not have a round shape but an octagonal one, a possible reference to the shape of crowns of Byzantine emperors and/or of Charlemagne&#x27;s Palatine Chapel in Aachen. Its eight hinged plates are arched at the top. Two strips of iron of unidentified date, riveted with golden rivets to the plates, hold the crown together. Before the addition of the rings the plates were held together by long golden pins, which made it possible to separate the plates and the arch for easier transport.

Each plate of the crown is made out of a high carat gold, around 22 carats, which gives the crown a &quot;buttery&quot; colour, and is studded with pearls and precious stones. The stones are not cut into facets (a technique still unknown when the crown was made), but polished into rounded shapes and fixed &quot;en cabochon&quot;, i.e. put into openings that were cut into the metal, and fastened with thin wires. The effect is that when light shines in, the stones look as if they would shine from within.

The crown is decorated with 144 precious stones including sapphires, emeralds and amethysts (blue, green and purple precious stones being proper to emperors in Byzantine imperial protocol), and about the same number of pearls. Similar gem-studded decoration was used for other precious objects of the early and high Middle Ages, e.g. reliquaries, processional or altar crosses (&quot;crux gemmata&quot;), or precious book covers such as those of the Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram and Codex Aureus of Echternach.

The smaller four plaques, or &#x27;picture-plates&#x27; (&quot;Bildplatten&quot;), bear pictorial representations of figures and scenes from the Bible and inscriptions in cloisonné enamel in Byzantine &quot;sunk&quot; (&quot;Senkschmelz&quot;) style. Each of these enamelled plates is surrounded by blue sapphires and pearls in raised filigree settings. 
* The Front Right Plate shows Christ in Majesty between two cherubim beneath the inscription in red enamel &quot;By me kings reign&quot; (&quot;P[er] ME REGES REGNANT&quot;; Proverbs 8:15). 
* The Back Right Plate shows the Prophet Isaiah standing and speaking to King Hezekiah, who is shown sitting on his bed. Isaiah holds a scroll with the words, &quot;Behold, I will add fifteen years to your life&quot; (II Kings 20:6). Above both Isaiah and Hezekiah are their names in red enamel (&quot;ISAIAS P[ro]PHETA · EZECHIAS REX&quot;). 
* The Front Left Plate shows King Solomon holding a scroll with the words, &quot;Fear the Lord and flee from evil&quot; (Proverbs 3:7), with his name above in red enamel &quot;King Solomon&quot; (&quot;REX SALOMON&quot;). 
* The Back Left Plate shows King David holding a scroll with the words, &quot;The renowned king delights in doing justice&quot; (Psalm 99:4), beneath the inscription naming him in red enamel (&quot;REX DAVID&quot;).

The other four plates, or &#x27;stone-plates&#x27; (&quot;Steinplatten&quot;), are of various sizes and decorated solely with precious stone and pearls in raised filigree settings. The twelve stones on the front and back plates are probably a direct reference to the twelve stones of the Jewish high priest&#x27;s breastplate or &quot;hoshen&quot; (Exodus 39:9-14) and to the twelve foundation stones of the New Jerusalem in the Revelation to John (Revelation 21: 19-21).

The top central stone of the front plate is a triangular sapphire which replaces a famous stone, now lost, which was known as the &quot;Waise&quot; (i.e., the &#x27;Orphan&#x27;, because of its uniqueness), probably a large white opal with a wine-red fire or possibly a singularly brilliant garnet or red zircon and the subject of medieval lore. The medieval theologian and philosopher Albert the Great wrote about it in 1250:
The Orphan is a jewel in the crown of the Roman emperor. Because the like of it has never been seen elsewhere, it is called the &quot;Orphan&quot;. It has the color of wine, of delicate red wine and it is as if the dazzling, white of snow penetrates the bright wine red and yet it remains dormant in this redness. The gem shines powerfully and it is said that it once even shone at night, but not in our time, but it is said to preserve the honour of the empire. 
When and why it was removed from the Imperial Crown is not known. The last mention of it is in an inventory ordered by Charles IV in 1350.

The crown has a single arch (or hoop) from the front to the back plate with the name and imperial style which may have belonged to Conrad II (&quot;the first German monarch to call himself &#x27;king of the Romans&#x27; (&quot;Rex Romanorum&quot;)&quot;), in seed pearls. On the left side of this arch these seed pearls spell out the words &quot;Conrad, by the Grace of God&quot; (&quot;CHVONRADUS DEI GRATIA&quot;), while on the right side they read &quot;Emperor of the Romans, Augustus&quot; (&quot;ROMANORU[M] IMPERATOR AUG[USTUS]&quot;). Above the front plate and in front of the arch is a jeweled cross with an engraving of the crucified Christ on its reverse side, originally a pectoral cross said to have belonged to Henry II and only later attached to the Imperial Crown. It is probable that both the arch and cross were added during Conrad II&#x27;s reign.

There are three small holes on each of the two side stone-plates from which probably hung chains with pendant jewels, known as &quot;pendilia&quot;. These were a feature of the now-lost crown of Byzantine emperors, as in the mosaic portrait of Justinian I in the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna. Pendilia are still extant on the Holy Crown of Hungary, or the Crown of Constance of Aragon held in Palermo Cathedral.

The present red velvet cap on the inside of the crown dates from the 17th century. Before this the imperial crown was worn over a mitre; assuming this had the form of the Byzantine &quot;camelaucum&quot;, the arch would have caused it to bulge up on both sides, much as the embroidered ribbon from front to back on the eleventh century bishops&#x27; mitres caused their linen fabric to bulge up. Thus the Imperial Crown appears to be the earliest form of mitre crowns worn by the Holy Roman Emperors as a sign of their imperial office, the form of which was perpetuated in the crown created for Rudolf II and now known as the Imperial Crown of Austria.

==Commemoration==

An identical copy was made in 1915 by order of Wilhelm II for display in Aachen, where it is still kept in the &quot;Krönungssaal&quot; of Aachen Town Hall, built in the 14th century on the remains of Charlemagne&#x27;s palace.

There are also copies of the crown and regalia in the Historical Museum of Frankfurt; in the fortress of Trifels in the former Electorate of the Palatinate; and in the Czech castle of Karlštejn, along with a copy of the Crown of Saint Wenceslas.

The Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire was selected as the main motif for a high value commemorative coin, the €100 Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire commemorative coin, minted in 2008. The obverse shows the Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire. The reverse shows the Emperor Otto I with the Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome in the background, where his coronation took place.

<text>The following is a list of engagements that took place in 1862 during the American Civil War. During the summer and early spring of the year, Union forces gained several successes over the Confederacy, seizing control of Missouri, northern Arkansas, Kentucky, and western Tennessee, along with several coastal areas. Confederate forces defended the capital of Richmond, Virginia, from Union assaults, and then launched counter–offensives into Kentucky and Maryland, both of which end in Union victories.

==History==
In the Eastern Theater, the Union Army of the Potomac, commanded by Major General George B. McClellan, was transported to Fort Monroe in April to begin an offensive against Richmond, Virginia. Convinced that he was outnumbered by the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, commanded by General Joseph E. Johnston, McClellan advanced cautiously, taking nearly a month to capture the Confederate defensive works near Yorktown and an additional month to march westward and arrive just outside Richmond. Here on May 31, Johnston attacked an isolated portion of the Union army in the Battle of Seven Pines; Johnston&#x27;s plan failed, due to uncoordinated attacks and to Confederate columns which failed to arrive at their assigned positions, and Johnston was wounded during the battle. To replace Johnston, Confederate President Jefferson Davis choose General Robert E. Lee, who launched the Seven Days Battles in late June. While the Confederate attacks were often disjointed and several commands failed to arrive at their assigned destinations on time, Lee was still able to drive the Union army back to Harrison&#x27;s Landing, forcing McClellan to give up his attempt to capture Richmond. Although he had driven the Union army away from the Confederate capital, Lee was disappointed that he had failed to destroy the Union army.

Lee then turned northward to deal with the Union Army of Virginia, commanded by Major General John Pope, planning to defeat Pope&#x27;s army before it could unite with McClellan&#x27;s army, which was arriving in northern Virginia from the Peninsula. During the Second Battle of Bull Run, Lee routed Pope&#x27;s army and then invaded Maryland, hoping to seize supplies from Union territory and also hoping that a major Confederate victory in Northern territory would secure foreign recognition for the Confederacy. However, McClellan attacked Lee through the passes of South Mountain and forced Lee to call off his planned invasion of Pennsylvania, instead concentrating his army behind Antietam Creek. Neither army gained a victory at the Battle of Antietam on September 17, but Lee&#x27;s retreat back to Virginia gave the Union a strategic victory in the campaign. During October and November, Union President Abraham Lincoln pressured McClellan to launch an aggressive campaign against Lee but McClellan refused, instead moving slowly and demanding supplies. Lincoln replaced McClellan on November 7 with Major General Ambrose Burnside, who hoped to cross the Rappahannock River near Fredericksburg, Virginia in order to get between Lee and Richmond. However, delays in obtaining a pontoon bridge prevented Burnside from crossing the river until December 11, by which time Lee was able to concentrate his entire army along a series of ridges near Fredericksburg. On December 13, Burnside attacked the Confederate positions and lost heavily; two days later he retreated back across the river and went into winter quarters.
In the Western Theater, the Confederate forces, commanded by General Albert S. Johnston, were forced to abandon Kentucky and much of central and western Tennessee following the loss of Fort Donelson and Fort Henry in February. The capture of the two forts turned the Union commander in the battles, Major General Ulysses S. Grant, into a national hero. Johnston, following a plan proposed by his second-in-command General P. G. T. Beauregard, concentrated as many forces as he could near Corinth, Mississippi and attacked Grant&#x27;s Army of the Tennessee near Shiloh Church. Although successful in driving the Union army almost into the Tennessee River on April 6, Johnston was mortally wounded during the battle, while Grant was reinforced during the night by the Army of the Ohio, commanded by Major General Don Carlos Buell. Grant then led a counterattack the following morning and drove the Confederates from the field, who then retreated back to their base at Corinth. Major General Henry W. Halleck took command of the Union forces operating in western Tennessee and advanced to Corinth, where both armies settled in for a month-long siege. Fearing that a full scale Union assault on the Confederate defenses was imminent, Beauregard evacuated Corinth during the night of May 29–30 without Halleck&#x27;s forces finding out until the following morning.

Beauregard was relieved of command shortly afterwards, due to his health; Jefferson Davis replaced him with General Braxton Bragg. Following the Union victory at Corinth, Halleck dispersed his army across northern Mississippi, western Tennessee, and northern Alabama to protect the railroads, while sending Buell&#x27;s Army of the Ohio eastward to capture Chattanogga, but problems with the Union supply lines prevented Buell from capturing the city. Bragg, pondering how to counteract the Union threat, received a message from Lieutenant General Edmund Kirby Smith, commander of the Confederate Department of East Tennessee, suggesting that the two combine forces to defeat Buell and retake Kentucky. Moving his troops by rail starting the end of June, Bragg arrived at Chattanooga near the end of July; from there he advanced into Kentucky towards the Ohio River. Buell moved north as well, managing to reach Louisville before Bragg did; from there he moved south towards Bragg. The two armies met in battle near Perryville, Kentucky on October 8; Bragg&#x27;s forces attacked Buell&#x27;s left wing but without success. Bragg retreated that night and united with Smith, intending to remain in Kentucky, but when Buell threatened his line of retreat, Bragg move south for Tennessee.

The Union navy, in concert with the army, captured several more coastal areas along the Atlantic seaboard and Gulf coast. Following the Union victory at Hatteras Inlet the previous year, other parts of the North Carolina coast, including New Berne, were captured; in April, Union forces attacked and captured Fort Pulaski in Georgia following a thirty hour bombardment, cutting off Savannah from blockade runners. This victory left Wilmington, North Carolina as the only major Atlantic port to remain in Confederate hands. Several ports in Florida and along the Gulf coast were captured as well, including Apalachicola and St. Augustine in Florida and Biloxi, Mississippi. In April, a Union squadron commanded by Commodore David Farragut ran past Forts Jackson and St. Philip near the mouth of the Mississippi River and forced the surrender of New Orleans, the largest Confederate port city in both population and in trade volume.

In the Trans-Mississippi Theater, the Confederates launched several offensive campaigns, all of which failed. In late January, Union Major General Samuel R. Curtis maneuvered the Missouri State Guard out of the state and into northwestern Arkansas; due to a shortage of supplies, Curtis had to halt his advance in the area of Pea Ridge. In response to the Union advance, Confederate President Jefferson Davis sent Major General Earl Van Dorn to Arkansas to take command of the Confederate forces in the state. After he arrived in early March, Van Dorn launched an offensive of his own, which resulted in the two-day Battle of Pea Ridge, a Confederate defeat. After the battle, he was ordered to take his army east of the Mississippi River and join the Confederate army at Corinth, Mississippi, but he arrived too late to fight in the Battle of Shiloh.
In Texas, Brigadier General Henry Sibley raised a brigade of cavalry and led it into the New Mexico Territory, intending to drive the remaining Union forces from it and advance into Colorado, capturing the gold and silver mines located in the territory. He fought the main Union force in the territory, commanded by Colonel Edward R.S. Canby, at the Battle of Valverde on February 17; although the battle was a Confederate victory, Sibley failed to force Canby to surrender. Instead, Sibley continued northward, leaving Canby in his rear. Continuing northward along the Rio Grande and the Santa Fe Tail, his brigade met a Union force, which included the 1st Colorado Infantry, at Glorieta Pass on March 28. The Confederates again drove the Union force from the field, but during the battle a Union detachment burned most of the Confederate supply train, along with most of their supplies. This meant that the Confederates had to retreat back to Texas, reaching it by mid-April, losing over 1,500 men out of an original force of 3,700 men.

<doc id="796463" wikidata="Q2717882" url="?curid=796463" title="Holiday Inn">
<text>Holiday Inn is a chain of hotels based in Atlanta, Georgia and a brand of IHG Hotels &amp; Resorts. The chain was founded in 1952 by Kemmons Wilson (1913–2003), who opened the first location in Memphis, Tennessee. The chain was a division of Bass Brewery from 1988 to 2000, Six Continents from 2000 to 2003, and IHG Hotels &amp; Resorts since 2003. It operates hotels under the names Holiday Inn, Holiday Inn Express, Holiday Inn Club Vacations, and Holiday Inn Resorts. As of 2018, Holiday Inn has hotels at over 1,100 locations.

==History==
===1950s–1970s ===
Kemmons Wilson, a resident of Memphis, Tennessee, was inspired to build a motel after being disappointed by the poor quality of roadside accommodations during a family road trip to Washington, D.C. During the construction, the name &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; was coined by Wilson&#x27;s architect Eddie Bluestein as a joking reference to the 1942 musical film &quot;Holiday Inn&quot;. Their first hotel/motel opened in August 1952 as &quot;Holiday Inn Hotel Courts&quot; at 4941 Summer Avenue in Memphis, then the main highway (U.S. Hwy. 64/70/79) to Nashville. It was demolished in 1994.

Wilson partnered with Wallace E. Johnson to build additional motels on the roads entering Memphis. In 1953, three more Holiday Inns were built on U.S. 51 South, Highway 51 North, and U.S. 61.

By 1957 there were 30 Holiday Inns, and Wilson began marketing the chain as &quot;Holiday Inn of America&quot;. There were 50 locations across the US by 1958, 100 by 1959, 500 by 1964, and 1000 in 1968. A number of early locations were franchised, some by the Albert Pick corporation of Chicago. Because a number of Albert Pick franchisees were recommending customers to other Albert Pick hotels instead of to Holiday Inn, the Holiday Inn corporation enacted a rule that franchisees could not own locations of another hotel as well as a Holiday Inn. This led to the Albert Pick-franchised locations exiting the brand by the end of the 1950s. The rule on franchising remained until 1973, when a franchisee was denied the rights to build a location in Newark, New Jersey because of this rule; the United States District Court thus declared the rule a violation of a United States anti-monopoly law.

In 1965, the chain launched Holidex, a centralized reservation system where a visitor to any Holiday Inn could obtain reservations, by teleprinter, for any other Holiday Inn location. Promoting itself as &quot;your host from coast to coast&quot;, Holiday Inn added a call center after AT&amp;T&#x27;s introduction of 800 toll-free telephone number service in 1967. Holiday Inn opened their first campground, Trav-L-Park, in Angola, Indiana, in 1970.
Branded as &quot;The Nation&#x27;s Innkeeper&quot;, the chain put considerable financial pressure on traditional motels and hotels, setting the standard for competitors like Ramada Inn, Quality Inn, Howard Johnson&#x27;s, and Best Western. By June 1972, with over 1,400 Holiday Inns worldwide, Wilson was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine and the franchise&#x27;s motto became &quot;The World&#x27;s Innkeeper&quot;.

In 1963, Holiday Inn signed a long-term deal with Gulf Oil where it agreed to accept Gulf credit cards to charge food and lodging at all of its American and Canadian hotels, in return for Gulf building service stations on many Holiday Inn properties, particularly near major U.S. and Interstate highways. The arrangement was copied by competing lodging chains and major oil companies during the mid-to-late 1960s, but fell out of favor following the 1973 oil crisis. The Gulf/Holiday Inn arrangement ended around 1982.

In 1971, the company constructed the Holiday Inn University and Conference Center, a teaching hotel for training new employees, in Olive Branch, Mississippi. In 1973, the company built the Olive Branch Airport north of the university as a home base for its corporate aircraft.

The company later branched into other enterprises, including Medi-Center nursing homes, Continental Trailways, Delta Queen, and Show-Biz, Inc., a television production company that specialized in syndicated country music shows. Wilson also developed the Orange Lake Resort and Country Club near Orlando and a chain called Wilson World Hotels. The company sold Trailways in 1979. As of 2014, Wilson&#x27;s family still operates hotels as part of the Kemmons Wilson Companies of Memphis.

===The Great Sign===

The &quot;Great Sign&quot; was the roadside sign used by Holiday Inn during its original era of expansion from the 1950s to 1970s. It was perhaps the company&#x27;s most successful form of advertising. It was extremely large and eye-catching, but was expensive to construct and maintain. The manufacturer of the sign was Balton &amp; Sons Sign Company, and it was originally designed by sketch artists Gene Barber and Roland Alexander. Wilson wanted a prominent sign, at least 50 feet (15 m) high and visible from both directions. He also wanted a changeable marquee to welcome different groups. The original sign cost $13,000. It is said that the sign&#x27;s colors were selected because they were favorites of Wilson&#x27;s mother.

In 1982, following Wilson&#x27;s departure, the Holiday Inn board of directors phased out the &quot;Great Sign&quot; in favor of a cheaper back-lit sign; Wilson considered it &quot;the worst mistake they ever made&quot;. He loved the &quot;Great Sign&quot; so much that it was engraved on his tombstone, with the marquee reading &quot;FOUNDER&quot; and the arrow aimed at his name. The majority of the signs were scrapped but working examples are owned by the American Sign Museum in Cincinnati, Ohio, The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, and a private collector in Park Hills, Kentucky.

===1980s–1990s===
Although still a healthy company, changing business conditions and demographics saw Holiday Inn lose its market dominance in the 1980s. Holiday Inns, Inc. was renamed &quot;Holiday Corporation&quot; in 1985 to reflect the growth of the company&#x27;s brands, including Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment, Embassy Suites Hotels, Crowne Plaza, Homewood Suites, and Hampton Inn. In 1988, Holiday Corporation was purchased by UK-based Bass PLC (then owners of the Bass beer brand), followed by the remaining domestic Holiday Inn hotels in 1990, when founder Wilson sold his interest, after which the hotel group was known as Holiday Inn Worldwide. The remainder of Holiday Corporation (including the Embassy Suites Hotels, Homewood Suites, and Hampton Inn brands) was spun off to shareholders as Promus Companies Incorporated. In 1990, Bass launched Holiday Inn Express, a complementary brand in the limited service segment.

In 1997, Bass created and launched a new hotel brand, Staybridge Suites by Holiday Inn, entering the North American upscale extended stay market. In March 1998, Bass acquired the InterContinental brand, expanding into the luxury hotel market. In 2000 Bass sold its brewing assets (and the rights to the Bass name) and changed its name to Six Continents PLC. InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) was created in 2003 after Six Continents split into two daughter companies: Mitchells &amp; Butlers PLC to handle restaurant assets, and IHG to focus on soft drinks and hotels, including the Holiday Inn brand.

The brand name Holiday Inn is now owned by IHG, which in turn licenses the name to franchisees and third parties who operate hotels under management agreements. In 1999, the hotel that changed into the Nickelodeon Suites Resort Orlando in 2005, opened, called &quot;Holiday Inn&quot;.

===Development since 2000===
&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported in 2002 that the company, led by Ravi Saligram, was producing a new 130-room &quot;Next Generation&quot; prototype hotel to rebuild the brand. It would include a bistro-like restaurant and an indoor pool. The first of these prototype hotels, the Holiday Inn Gwinnett Center, was built in Duluth, Georgia, in 2003.

In 2008, Mitchells and Butlers sold off 21 Holiday Inn hotels in exchange for 44 standalone pubs to Whitbread. In September 2008, IHG announced the creation of a new timeshare brand, Holiday Inn Club Vacations, a strategic alliance with The Family of Orange Lake Resorts.

On October 24, 2007, IHG announced a worldwide relaunch of the Holiday Inn brand, which spelled trouble for the remaining motels. The relaunch was &quot;focused on delivering consistently best in class service and physical quality levels, including a redesigned welcome experience [and] signature bedding and bathroom products&quot;. The first relaunched Holiday Inn opened in the U.S. in spring 2008. Currently there are more than 2,500 relaunched Holiday Inn brand hotels around the world, and the Holiday Inn global brand relaunch process was completed by the end of 2010. By then, the majority of the HI motels were removed from the chain, with a few exceptions. (In the 1980s and 1990s, HI hotels were built alongside the motel properties [i.e. Baton Rouge, Louisiana] in order to provide more amenities and newer rooms.) When the relaunch occurred, these motels were either demolished or closed off, even if a full-service hotel was already on site. Today, fewer than 10 original Holiday Inn motels still operate, others having been replaced by newer Holiday Inn Express locations or having switched to other chains.

In August 2012, the chain celebrated its 60th anniversary.

In 2024, IHG announced a vast expansion of the Holiday Inn and Holiday Inn Express brands in Germany as part of a franchise and cooperation agreement with German hotel operator Novum Hospitality which in turn will rebrand the majority of their currently over 100 properties into Holiday Inn, including a newly created sub-brand named &quot;Holiday Inn - the niu&quot;.

==Brands==

===Current properties===
Holiday Inn currently operates hotels and resorts using the following brands:

* Holiday InnThis is the most recognizable tier of service. There are two distinct types: high-rise, full-service plaza hotels and low-rise, full-service hotels. The former also included many high-rises with round, central-core construction, instantly recognizable from the 1970s. Both offer a restaurant, pools at most locations, room service, an exercise room, and functional but comfortable rooms.
*Holiday Inn Hotel &amp; SuitesThe properties offer all the amenities and services of a regular Holiday Inn but consist of rooms mixed with suites.
* Holiday Inn Resort (called &quot;Holiday Inn Sunspree Resort&quot; from 1991 to 2007)The properties also offer all the amenities and services of a full-service Holiday Inn; resorts are considered more of an advertising branding than a completely different brand. Most Holiday Inn Resorts are located in high-leisure-tourism markets.
* Holiday Inn SelectThese upper-range full-service hotels cater to business travelers, and are often located next to international airports. In 2006 it was announced that Holiday Inn Select hotels would be discontinued. Existing hotels may continue to operate under the Holiday Inn Select flag until their existing license expires, however many are converting to Crowne Plaza or regular Holiday Inn hotels, with no further marketing or advertising based around the &quot;Select&quot; moniker. Several Select hotels remained as of 2014.
* Holiday Inn Club VacationsThese are resorts aimed at families and are only based in the U.S. The accommodations are mostly villas and suites. Membership operates similar to a flexible timeshare basis.
* Holiday Inn Garden CourtThe properties exist only in Europe and South Africa and are designed to reflect the national culture.
* Holiday Inn ExpressThese properties originally focused on economy and limited service, very similar to competitors like Comfort Inn/Comfort Suites, Fairfield Inn &amp; Suites by Marriott and Hampton by Hilton, providing only continental breakfast and an exercise room. However newer Holiday Inn Express feature most amenities from the higher-end Holiday Inn brand, such as a restaurant and bar, conference rooms and a fitness center with a swimming pool. A major differentiation is location, with Express properties typically situated in suburbs and along freeways, while Holiday Inn is situated in urban areas (including downtowns) and often near tourist attractions. Most Holiday Inn Express locations now offer a hot breakfast option.

===Former properties===
*Holiday Inn Jr. was a motel brand during the 1960s and 1970s with just 44 to 48 guest rooms and limited amenities. The first such location opened in Camden, Arkansas in 1964. The last hotel to operate under the Holiday Inn Jr. name was in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, which remained in operation until it burned down in 1979.
*Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza was separated from Holiday Inn in 1994 to form a distinctive brand, Crowne Plaza. Nonetheless, Holiday Inn brochures still continued to list the locations of Crowne Plaza alongside other Holiday Inn properties.

==Trademark conflicts==
For two decades a hotel called Holiday Inn located in Niagara Falls, Ontario prevented the Holiday Inn Corporation from operating one of its own hotels in that city since the name was already in use. The hotel used a logo similar to the old Holiday Inn logo from the 1970s. The Holiday Inn Corporation directory referred to the hotel as &quot;not part of this Holiday Inn system&quot;. The hotel also owned the holidayinn.com domain, which forced the much larger corporation to use holiday-inn.com. In 2006, an agreement between IHG and the Niagara Falls, Ontario hotel owners was reached that allowed both the Hotel and Holidayinn.com to be incorporated into the IHG system.

During the 1960s and early 1970s, Holiday Inn hotels located in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina were simply called &quot;Holiday&quot; because a local motel already had the &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; name. The Myrtle Beach motel started as Ocean Front Lodge in 1948 but changed the name to Holiday Inn in 1949 (three years before the founding of the chain), and put up a sign in 1955 with similar lettering to that of the chain, which registered its sign in 1954. The chain first franchised motels in the area in 1956. The Myrtle Beach hotel put up a sign resembling the &quot;Great Sign&quot; in 1968, and used &quot;®&quot; with its name, though many of its items came from suppliers which assumed they were selling to the chain. The Myrtle Beach hotel &quot;began a concurrent use proceeding in the Patent and Trademark Office&quot; in 1970, which was suspended when the name was contested before the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina (Florence division) in 1973. The court said the Myrtle Beach hotel had plenty of repeat business and was not negatively impacted by the chain&#x27;s motels in the area. The 1973 injunction meant the Myrtle Beach hotel was granted the right to use the name but with a different style of lettering. The concurrent use proceeding resumed for the Myrtle Beach hotel, which continued to operate as &quot;Holiday Inn&quot;, although it was required to use a distinctly different font. A 1976 ruling granted the Myrtle Beach Hotel the right to a service mark. A 1979 order denied a motion to modify the 1973 injunction, though it was believed the hotel had followed all restrictions. A 1981 decision by the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the 1979 action.

<doc id="796474" wikidata="Q915802" url="?curid=796474" title="Modulor">
<text>The Modulor is an anthropometric scale of proportions devised by the Swiss-born French architect Le Corbusier (1887–1965).

It was developed as a visual bridge between two incompatible scales, the Imperial and the metric systems. It is based on the height of a man with his arm raised. The Modulor considered the standard human height as 1.83 m, excluding feminine measures. The dimensions were refined with overall height of raised arm set at 2.26 m.

It was used as a system to set out a number of Le Corbusier&#x27;s buildings and was later codified into two books.

==History==
Le Corbusier developed the Modulor in the long tradition of Vitruvius, Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s Vitruvian Man, the work of Leon Battista Alberti, and other attempts to discover mathematical proportions in the human body and then to use that knowledge to improve both the appearance and function of architecture. The system is inspired by but does not exactly correspond to human measurements, and it also draws inspiration from the double unit, the Fibonacci numbers, and the golden ratio. Le Corbusier described it as a &quot;range of harmonious measurements to suit the human scale, universally applicable to architecture and to mechanical things&quot;.

With the Modulor, Le Corbusier sought to introduce a scale of visual measures that would unite two virtually incompatible systems: the Anglo-Saxon foot and inch and the international metric system. Whilst he was intrigued by ancient civilisations who used measuring systems linked to the human body: elbow (cubit), finger (digit), thumb (inch) etc., he was troubled by the metre as a measure that was a forty-millionth part of the meridian of the earth.

In 1943, in response to the French National Organisation for Standardisation&#x27;s (AFNOR) requirement for standardising all the objects involved in the construction process, Le Corbusier asked an apprentice to consider a scale based upon a man with his arm raised to 2.20 m in height. The result, in August 1943 was the first graphical representation of the derivation of the scale. This was refined after a visit to the Dean of the Faculty of Sciences in Sorbonne on 7 February 1945 which resulted in the inclusion of a golden section into the representation.

Whilst initially the Modulor Man&#x27;s height was based on a French man&#x27;s height of it was changed to 1.83 m in 1946 because &quot;in English detective novels, the good-looking men, such as policemen, are always six feet tall!&quot;. The dimensions were refined to give round numbers and the overall height of the raised arm was set at 2.262 m.

Of the works leading to the creation of the Modulor, Robin Evans notes that the female body &quot;was only belatedly considered and rejected as a source of proportional harmony&quot;.

==Promotion==
On 10 January 1946 during a visit to New York, Le Corbusier met with Henry J. Kaiser, an American industrialist whose Kaiser Shipyard had built Liberty ships during World War II. Kaiser&#x27;s project was to build ten thousand new houses a day, but he had changed his mind and decided to build cars instead. During the interview, Le Corbusier sympathised with Kaiser&#x27;s problems of coordinating the adoption of equipment between the American and British armies because of the differences in units of length; and promoted his own &quot;harmonious scale&quot;.

On the same trip he met with David E. Lilienthal of the Tennessee Valley Authority to promote the use of his &quot;harmonious scale&quot; on further civil engineering projects.

He also applied the principle of the Modulor to the efficient design of distribution crates in post war France.

==Graphic representation==

The graphic representation of the Modulor, a stylised human figure with one arm raised, stands next to two vertical measurements, a red series based on the figure&#x27;s navel height (1.08 m in the original version, 1.13 m in the revised version) and segmented according to Phi and a blue series based on the figure&#x27;s entire height, double the navel height (2.16 m in the original version, 2.26 m in the revised), segmented similarly. A spiral, graphically developed between the red and blue segments, seems to mimic the volume of the human figure.

The Modulor 2 was drawn by André Maissonier and Justino Serralta.

==Practical application==
Le Corbusier used his Modulor scale in the design of many buildings, including:

===Unité d&#x27;Habitation à Marseille===

In his first book on the subject &quot;The Modulor&quot;, Le Corbusier has a chapter on the use of the modular in the Unité d&#x27;Habitation. The modular governs: the plan, section and elevations; the brise-soleil; the roof; the supporting columns and the plan and section of the apartments. It was also used for the dimensions of the commemorative stone laid on 14 October 1947. A version of the Modulor Man was cast in concrete near the entrance.

===Church of Sainte Marie de La Tourette===

In the Church of Sainte Marie de La Tourette Le Corbusier floors the majority of the church in pale concrete panels set to Modulor dimensions. Also, the engineer Iannis Xenakis applied the Modulor system to the design of the exterior vertical ventilators or &quot;ondulatoires&quot;.

===Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts===

In the Carpenter Center the Modulor system was used for the brise-soleil distances, the floor to floor heights, the bay distances and the column thicknesses. Le Corbusier conceived that the dimensioning of the entrance ramp would be &quot;visible essay on the mathematics of the human body&quot;.

# The patterns of paint on the side of the balconies is explained by diagonal line.
# Brie Soleil is sized by the height of the Modulor man.
# The room height is calculated by the Modulor.

==Publication==
Le Corbusier published &quot;Le Modulor&quot; in 1948, followed by &quot;Modulor 2&quot; in 1955. These works were first published in English as &quot;The Modulor&quot; in 1954 and &quot;Modulor 2 (Let the User Speak Next)&quot; in 1958.

The 2004 reprinted box set including both books was printed in a square format using the Modulor with the series twenty seven to one hundred and forty reduced in size to one tenth.

<doc id="796478" wikidata="Q2490697" url="?curid=796478" title="1980 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1980 Atlantic hurricane season featured nine hurricanes, the most since 1969. This hurricane season was fairly active, with sixteen tropical cyclones forming, eleven of which strengthened into named tropical storms. The season officially began on June 1, 1980, and lasted until November 30, 1980. It was the first time since the 1971 season that there were no active tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin during the month of June. The season occurred during an ENSO-neutral phase, having neither an El Niño nor a La Niña.

The three most notable storms of the season were Hurricane Allen, Tropical Storm Hermine, and Hurricane Jeanne. Allen was the then-earliest Category 5 hurricane in the calendar year on record, reaching that intensity on August 5. The storm devastated portions of the Caribbean, Mexico, and the United States. Overall, Allen caused about $1.57 billion and at least 269 deaths. Hermine caused significant flooding in southern Mexico, which resulted in at least 38 fatalities. Jeanne was one of only a few tropical cyclones to enter the Gulf of Mexico at hurricane intensity and not make landfall.

== Seasonal summary ==
The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, though the first tropical depression did not develop until July 17. During the season, 16 tropical depressions formed. Eleven of the depressions attained tropical storm status, and nine of these attained hurricane status. Two of the hurricanes further strengthened to become major hurricanes. Only Allen made landfall at hurricane strength during the season, although Hurricane Charley and tropical storms Danielle and Hermine also caused damage and fatalities. The last storm of the season, Hurricane Karl, merged with an extratropical cyclone on November 27, three days before the official end date of November 30. Overall, the cyclones of the 1980 Atlantic hurricane season collectively caused 317 deaths and more than $1.596 billion (1980 USD) in damage.

The 1980 Atlantic hurricane season had a rather slow beginning, with only one tropical depression developing prior to the month of August. In contrast, August was an active month, with five tropical cyclones forming, three of which became hurricanes. During that month, Hurricane Allen became the earliest known Category 5 hurricane on August 5, a record later broken by only Hurricane Emily on July 16, 2005. September also had five tropical cyclones, all of which became named storms. In a 48-hour period between September 4–6, four storms (Georges, Danielle, Earl, and Frances) were named. This tied the record set in 1893 for the fastest time four storms were named within the Atlantic basin; the record was broken in 2023. Tropical cyclogenesis abruptly halted in October, with only Hurricane Ivan and a tropical depression developing in that month. However, the month of November was considered to be very active, with three storms forming during that month.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 149, which is classified as &quot;above normal&quot;. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. Its only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph (63 km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity.

== Systems ==

=== Tropical Depression One ===

A decaying cold front entered into Gulf of Mexico, and developed a low-pressure area of July 17. Later that day, the low-pressure area developed into Tropical Depression One almost halfway between Louisiana and the Yucatán Peninsula. The depression moved northwestward, and minimal intensification occurred, as it approached the Gulf Coast of the United States. The depression made landfall in Texas near the Galveston area, and dissipated by July 21. Minimal impact was recorded from the depression, and light rainfall was reported in Texas and western Louisiana, peaking at in Refugio, Texas.
=== Hurricane Allen ===
A tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa on July 30 and quickly developed into Tropical Depression Two about two days later. By August 2, the depression had strengthened and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Allen. The storm steadily intensified and became a hurricane on August 3. Thereafter, Allen rapidly deepened, and was a major hurricane only 24 hours later. As Allen passed through the Windward Islands, it strengthened into a Category 4. Upon entering the Caribbean Sea, Allen continued to strengthen and became a Category 5 hurricane on August 5, while about halfway between Puerto Rico and Venezuela. Allen briefly curved northwestward and approached the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti. Shortly thereafter, Allen weakened significantly on August 6, but was still a Category 4 when it bypassed Jamaica. While paralleling the south coast of Cuba, Allen re-strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane. Later that day, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 190 mph (305 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . Immediately following peak intensity, Allen entered the Gulf of Mexico and weakened back to a Category 4 hurricane on August 8. On the day next, Allen re-intensified into a Category 5 hurricane while approaching Texas. However, just offshore, Allen abruptly weakened to a low-end Category 3 hurricane prior to landfall near Brownsville, Texas, on August 10. The storm quickly weakened inland and dissipated about 36 hours after striking land.

Although 500 houses were either damaged or destroyed on Barbados, losses totaled to only $1.5 million. Having passed only south of St. Lucia, Allen produced sustained winds as high as on the island. The storm caused 27 fatalities and $88 million in damage on that island. In addition, one death was reported in Guadeloupe. High winds and flooding in Haiti left 836,200 people homeless. In addition, 220 deaths were reported and damage exceeded $400 million. To the east in Dominican Republic, effects were less severe, though seven deaths were reported and damage was estimated at $47 million. On the island of Cuba, three fatalities occurred and losses were unknown. In northeastern Mexico, heavy rainfall occurred, though damage was minimal and no fatalities were reported. Damage was most significant in the United States, especially in the state of Texas. In Corpus Christi, gravel blew off the roofs, which broke windows throughout the city. Several tornadoes were spawned in Texas, one of which caused at least $50 million in damage in Austin. Rainfall in the state of Texas exceeded in some locations. A total of 24 fatalities occurred in the United States – seven in Texas and seventeen in Louisiana – most resulting from the crash of a helicopter evacuating workers from an offshore platform. Damage in United States totaled to $860 million. Overall, Hurricane Allen caused $1.57 billion in losses and caused 290 deaths.
=== Tropical Depression Four ===

The third tropical depression of the season developed east of Cape Verde on August 13. However, the National Hurricane Center did not initiate advisories until August 16. As a result, the system was classified as Tropical Depression Four. After forming on August 13, the depression crossed through the Cape Verde Islands. The depression tracked northwestward and strengthened minimally, with winds never exceeding 35 mph (55 km/h). Thereafter, the depression curved and approached the eastern portion of the Azores. Tropical Depression Four moved through the islands shortly later. By early on August 17, the depression dissipated near Santa Maria Island in the Azores.
=== Hurricane Bonnie ===

Starting on August 13, a tropical wave in the vicinity of the Cape Verde began organizing into a tropical cyclone. Early on the following day, the system had developed into Tropical Depression Three while nearly halfway between the west coast of Africa and the Windward Islands. However, in post-analysis, it was revealed that the previous tropical depression had actually developed before Bonnie. Thus, those two depressions were operationally numbered incorrectly. Two reports of gale-force winds were received from ships later that day. As a result, the depression was re-classified as Tropical Storm Bonnie about twelve hours after developing. Bonnie turned in a general northward direction, possibly due to interaction with nearby Tropical Depression Four.

Based on satellite estimates, Bonnie strengthened into a hurricane at 00:00 UTC on August 16. The storm strengthened slightly further and attained its peak intensity with winds of 100 mph (155 km/h) and a minimum pressure of . After attaining peak intensity on August 16, Bonnie slowly weakened as it continued in an unusual northward direction. On the following day, Bonnie weakened slightly to a minimal Category 1 hurricane. The storm remained at that intensity for 72 hours as it accelerated northward across the open Atlantic. By 18:00 UTC on August 19, Bonnie transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while almost halfway between the southern tip of Greenland and the Azores.
=== Hurricane Charley ===

An extratropical low pressure system was centered over the Mid-Atlantic United States, though it tracked southeastward and emerged into the Atlantic on August 20. Later that day, satellite imagery indicated that a well-defined low-level circulation. As a result, it was determine that the system developed into a subtropical depression at 12:00 UTC, while located about east-northeast of Hatteras, North Carolina. Initially, the depression tracked east-southeastward, though it curved east-northeastward by August 21. Shortly thereafter, the depression strengthened into a subtropical storm. By early on August 23, the storm had intensified and acquired enough tropical characteristics to be re-classified as Hurricane Charley.

At 12:00 UTC on August 23, Charley attained its peak intensity with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) and a minimum pressure of . Following peak intensity, Charley completed a cyclonic loop and began weakening as it headed almost due-east. Charley was downgraded to a tropical storm early on August 24. The storm continued eastward and by August 26, Charley became unidentifiable as it merged with an intense extratropical cyclone, while located about southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland. While a tropical cyclone, Charley produced rip currents along the Outer Banks of North Carolina, which drowned seven people.
=== Tropical Depression Six ===

A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean on August 22. The system developed into Tropical Depression Six, while centered to the west of Cape Verde at 00:00 UTC on August 25. The depression tracked westward with minimal intensification. By 18:00 UTC on August 26, the depression reached 35 mph (55 km/h) and did not strengthen further. On the following day, the depression curved northwestward and slowly began to weaken. The depression degenerated into a tropical wave while well northeast of Puerto Rico on August 29. The remnants of Tropical Depression Six continued westward and interacted with a low-pressure system over Florida. Eventually, the system developed into Tropical Depression Eight on September 4, which later became Tropical Storm Danielle.
=== Hurricane Georges ===

On August 28, a tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic off the west coast of Africa. At 00:00 UTC on September 1, the system developed into Tropical Depression Seven, while centered roughly midway between the Lesser Antilles and the west coast of Africa. Sixteen hours later, the National Hurricane Center initiated advisories on the depression. The depression tracked westward in the trade winds during the following three days, without any intensification. After curving northwestward an Air Force reconnaissance flight found little evidence of a closed circulation, while satellite imagery also showed a disorganized and elongated cloud pattern on September 4. As a result, it was determined that the depression degenerated into a tropical disturbance at 06:00 UTC on that day. However, the National Hurricane Center did not discontinue advisories until 22:00 UTC.

On September 5, satellite imagery suggested a surface circulation had developed, possibly due to interaction with a cold low. As a result, the system regenerated into a subtropical depression at 12:00 UTC on that day, while centered about southwest of Bermuda. Ten hours later, the National Hurricane Center resumed advisories on the subtropical depression. While the subtropical depression was curved northeastward, it strengthened and acquired tropical characteristics. At 00:00 UTC on September 7, the subtropical depression became Tropical Storm Georges. The storm continued to intensify while tracking northeastward and was upgraded to a hurricane about 24 hours after becoming a tropical storm. Simultaneously, Georges attained its peak intensity with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) and a minimum pressure of . However, later on September 8, Georges transitioned into an extratropical cyclone near Cape Race, Newfoundland. While bypassing Newfoundland, Georges dropped light rainfall, with amounts under of precipitation.
=== Tropical Storm Danielle ===
A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on August 22. The system developed into Tropical Depression Six on August 25. However, the depression did not strengthen further, and about four days later, it degenerated back into a tropical wave. Tracking westward, the system crossed Florida and entered into the Gulf of Mexico on September 2. Two days later, the system developed into Tropical Depression Eight while offshore of Louisiana. The depression gradually strengthened and became Tropical Storm Danielle late on September 5. After peaking with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h), further intensification was halted, as Danielle soon made landfall in eastern Texas. Danielle steadily weakened inland and dissipated two days later.

A barge in the Gulf of Mexico capsized due to rough seas, sending 11 of the crewmen overboard; one person drowned as a result. Danielle produced widespread rainfall in Louisiana, though few areas reported more than 5 in (130 mm) of precipitation. Damage in that state was minimal. Rainfall was heavier in Texas, peaking at 18.29 in (465 mm). Much of the damage caused by the storm was as a result of flooding. In Port Arthur, twelve homes were damaged, while Interstate 10 was inundated by flood waters. One fatality occurred in Texas due to an automobile accident in Beaumont. Danielle also spawned five tornadoes in Texas, three of which collectively caused $277,500 in damage. Overall, Danielle caused two fatalities and at least $25 million in damage in Teas. Elsewhere, the storm dropped light rainfall in Oklahoma and Mississippi.
=== Hurricane Earl ===

Between September 2 and September 3, a tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa and entered the Atlantic Ocean. Satellite imagery indicated that the system had rapidly organized and was classified as a tropical depression on September 4. The depression quickly strengthened and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Earl later that day. Because convection associated with the storm waxed and waned significantly, Earl was operationally considered a tropical depression until September 6. On the following day, Earl curved north-northwestward and accelerated due to an upper-level low pressure trough in the central Atlantic Ocean. 

After evidence of an eye feature appeared, Earl was upgraded to a hurricane on September 8. Six hours later, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) and a minimum pressure of . Under the influence of an upper cold low, Earl began re-curving and accelerated to the northeast. By 12:00 UTC on September 10, Earl weakened to a tropical storm. Six hours later, Earl transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, while centered about halfway between the Azores and Greenland.
=== Hurricane Frances ===

A strong low pressure system moved off the African coast on September 5. By the following day, it developed into Tropical Depression Ten while a short distance off the west coast of Africa. About 18 hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Frances. The National Hurricane Center did not issue advisories until 16:00 UTC on September 7, at which time the system was already a tropical storm. By early on September 8, Frances had reached hurricane status, though it was not operationally upgraded until about 16 hours later. After becoming a hurricane, Frances began to rapidly strengthen, and became a Category 2 hurricane later that day. Early on September 9, the storm further intensified to a Category 3 hurricane. At 06:00 UTC on that day, Frances attained its peak intensity with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) and a minimum pressure of .

After peak intensity, Frances began to weaken and was downgraded to a Category 2 hurricane later on September 9. Following day, the storm fluctuated between Category 2 and Category 1 hurricane strengthen. While curving northwestward on September 13, Frances remained steady in intensity as a Category 2 hurricane. Eventually, Frances re-curved northward, thereby avoiding any land. After minimal change in intensity, Frances weakened to a Category 1 hurricane while tracking northeastward on September 17. After briefly heading northward, the storm re-curved back to the northeast. Early on September 20, Frances weakened to a tropical storm, before merging with a frontal low while centered about halfway between Greenland and Iceland. Several ships reported tropical storm-force winds, but no impacts occurred on land except for minor squalls in Cape Verde.
=== Tropical Storm Hermine ===
A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa on September 11 and tracked westward with minimal development until reaching the Caribbean Sea. By September 20, a low-level circulation had developed and the system was then classified as Tropical Depression Eleven, while located almost midway between Panama and Jamaica. While heading almost due westward, the depression steadily intensified, becoming Tropical Storm Hermine on September 21, 18 hours after forming. Later on September 21, the storm passed only offshore of Honduras. Hermine curved west-northwestward and nearly strengthened into a hurricane before landfall in northern British Honduras (present-day Belize) on September 22. After crossing the Yucatán Peninsula, Hermine emerged into the Bay of Campeche on the following day.

Once again, the storm intensified to near hurricane strength, though Hermine made landfall in Mexico near Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, on September 24. After moving inland, the storm steadily weakened while tracking south-southwestward toward the Pacific Ocean. However, by early on September 26, Hermine dissipated near the southwestern coast of Mexico. In Mexico, many areas reported at least of precipitation, while a few locations experienced more than of rain. As a result of torrential rainfall, at least 30 fatalities occurred, with dozens more missing, and leaving 25,000 homeless. Additionally, landslides triggered by Hermine in Guatemala killed at least eight people.
=== Hurricane Ivan ===

In late September, a cold-core low persisted off the coast of Portugal, moving southwestward. The system gradually developed tropical characteristics as it turned northwestward and executed a loop near the Azores. Eventually, the system organized enough to be designated as a tropical depression on October 4, while just east of the Azores. Shortly thereafter, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Ivan. However, the National Hurricane Center did not initiate advisories on Ivan until late on October 5. Ivan moved largely in tandem with the upper-level low above it, while its southwest movement was caused by a building ridge to its north. Late on October 5, an eye developed, and Ivan was upgraded to a hurricane on the following day.

It de-accelerated as the ridge to its north weakened, and 18 hours after becoming a hurricane, Ivan peaked with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). Between October 6 and October 7, Ivan executed a tight loop, followed by a motion to the west-northwest. Ultimately, the intensity did not change for about 90 hours. During that time, the eye fluctuated occasionally as the convection waxed and waned. On October 9, Ivan turned to the north in advance of an approaching cold front and extratropical storm, while slowly weakening as it accelerated over cooler waters of the far northern Atlantic Ocean. By October 12, the cold front absorbed Ivan, which was about 665 mi (1,070 km) west of Ireland.
===Unnumbered tropical depression===

Early on October 16, a tropical depression developed over the northwestern Caribbean about northeast of Limón, Honduras. The depression moved westward and remained just offshore. By 00:00 UTC on October 18, the depression dissipated approximately east of Placencia, Belize.
=== Hurricane Jeanne ===
An area of disturbed weather organized into a tropical depression late on November 8. The depression slowly intensified as it tracked north-northwestward into the northwestern Caribbean Sea. Shortly before entering the Yucatán Channel, the depression had strengthened enough to be upgraded to Tropical Storm Jeanne on November 9. Further intensification was still gradual in the Gulf of Mexico, though the rate of deepening accelerated as the storm began to curve westward. By November 11, Jeanne was upgraded to a hurricane while paralleling the northern coast of the Yucatán Peninsula. Early on the following day, Jeanne peaked as a 100 mph (155 km/h) Category 2 hurricane. Thereafter, Jeanne began to weaken due to dry air and was downgraded to a tropical storm 24 hours after peak intensity. The storm briefly tracked west-northwestward and then westward, before becoming nearly stationary in the western Gulf of Mexico.

Moving slowly and erratically, Jeanne weakened further and was downgraded to a tropical depression on November 15. The storm curved southward and completed a cyclonic loop, before being absorbed by a cold front on November 16. Fringe effects of Jeanne triggered a record-breaking 23.28 in (591 mm) of rain at Key West, Florida, within a 24-hour period. As a result of heavy precipitation, schools and numerous businesses closed, flights at Key West International Airport were grounded, and power outages and disruptions in telephone service occurred in Key West. Damage totaled about $1 million and one indirct death occurred due to a heart attack. In Texas, high tides caused flooding along much of the coast of the state, especially in Galveston. Offshore, several ships were caught off guard by the late season storm.
=== Tropical Depression Fourteen ===

Tropical Depression Fourteen developed north of Panama on November 12. Steered northward by deep southerly flow southeast of Jeanne, the depression oscillated in organization while tracking west-northwestward. The cloud pattern between Jeanne and the depression briefly merged, with a line of thunderstorms moving across the Florida peninsula between the two systems. Westerly vertical wind shear increased on the depression in the process. By November 15, the depression reorganized its convective organization while making landfall in western Cuba early on November 16. Once again, vertical wind shear increased, causing convection to detach from the center of the depression.

Late on November 17, the depression was absorbed by an intense &quot;winter type storm&quot; that was moving across the Southeastern United States. Shortly thereafter, the remnants of the depression crossed Central and North Florida. While crossing Cuba, the depression dumped heavy rainfall. No other impact is known to have occurred on the island. The depression impact from both while tropical and a remnant system. In Key West, sustained winds of 30 mph (45 km/h) and gusts to 40 mph (65 km/h) were reported. Across much of Florida, light rainfall was reported, peaking at in Brooksville.
=== Hurricane Karl ===

On November 21, a low-pressure area formed along a frontal boundary near the southeastern United States. The system slowly strengthened and developed into a separate cyclone, aided by light wind shear. Following the development of circular convective mass close to the center of the low, it became a subtropical storm early on November 25 while centered about southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Shortly thereafter, the storm executed a tight counterclockwise loop as it rotated within a larger, extratropical cyclone. Around 18:00 UTC, the subtropical storm intensified and acquired enough tropical characteristics to be designated as Hurricane Karl. The NHC noted that at the time, Karl was the easternmost hurricane during the last 10 days of the month of November.

The hurricane tracked eastward due to a strong trough moving eastward over the Atlantic and gradually strengthened, eventually attaining its peak intensity with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 985 mbar (hPa; 29.09 inHg). Thereafter, Karl curved northeastward because of the aforementioned trough and weakened slightly on November 27, with the eye becoming ragged and showing signs of deterioration while passing within 230 mi (370 km) of the Azores. Later that day, Karl turned north-northeastward around the periphery of the trough and merged with an approaching extratropical cyclone roughly halfway between Cape Race, Newfoundland and Spain.
== Storm names ==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 1980. Most names were used for the first (and only in the case of &quot;Allen&quot;) time, except for &quot;Frances&quot;, which was previously used under the old naming convention.

=== Retirement ===

In the spring of 1981, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name &quot;Allen&quot; from its rotating name lists due to its destructive impacts, and it will not be used again for another Atlantic hurricane. It was replaced with &quot;Andrew&quot; for the 1986 season.

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1980 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1980 USD.

<doc id="796483" wikidata="Q2995198" url="?curid=796483" title="List of constitutions of Mexico">
<text>Since declaring independence in 1821, Mexico has adopted a number of constitutions or other documents of basic law with constitutional effects. Not all these can be considered constitutions, and not all of them enjoyed universal application. Those enacted in 1824, 1857, and 1917 are generally considered full-fledged, operational constitutions. The Constitution of 1824 established the framework of a federated republic, following the short-lived monarchy of Agustín de Iturbide (in 1821–22). The Constitution of 1857 was the framework set by Mexican liberals that incorporated particular laws into the constitution. The Constitution of 1917 was drafted by the faction that won the Mexican Revolution, known as the Constitutionalists for their adherence to the Constitution of 1857. It strengthened the anticlerical framework of the 1857 constitution, empowered the state to expropriate private property, and set protections for organized labor. The 1917 Constitution was significantly revised in 1992 under Carlos Salinas de Gortari, eliminating anticlerical restrictions and strengthening private property rights against the State.

<doc id="796492" wikidata="Q6786568" url="?curid=796492" title="Material witness">
<text>In American criminal law, a material witness is a person with information alleged to be material concerning a criminal proceeding. The authority to detain material witnesses dates to the First Judiciary Act of 1789, but the Bail Reform Act of 1984 most recently amended the text of the statute, and it is now codified at . The most recent version allows material witnesses to be held to ensure the giving of their testimony in criminal proceedings or to a grand jury.

Since September 11, 2001, the U.S. has used the material witness statute to detain suspects without charge for indefinite periods of time, often under the rubric of securing grand-jury testimony. This use of the statute is controversial and is currently under judicial review. In &quot;Ashcroft v. al-Kidd&quot; (2011), the detainee was never charged or called as a witness, and sued John Ashcroft, then the U.S. attorney general. The Supreme Court overturned a ruling by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and held that Ashcroft qualified for immunity because of his official position.

==Text of the statute==
, commonly referred to as the &quot;material witness statute,&quot; provides as follows:

If it appears from an affidavit filed by a party that the testimony of a person is material in a criminal proceeding, and if it is shown that it may become impracticable to secure the presence of the person by subpoena, a judicial officer may order the arrest of the person and treat the person in accordance with the provisions of section of this title. No material witness may be detained because of inability to comply with any condition of release if the testimony of such witness can adequately be secured by deposition, and if further detention is not necessary to prevent a failure of justice. Release of a material witness may be delayed for a reasonable period of time until the deposition of the witness can be taken pursuant to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

==Introduction==
A &quot;material witness&quot; is an individual who contains information &quot;material&quot; to a criminal proceeding. With the authority of , the United States government can seek a warrant from a judicial officer in order to arrest a material witness. To do so, a United States official must file an affidavit with the judicial officer alleging that (1) the individual has material information to the criminal proceeding &quot;and&quot; (2) it would be &quot;impracticable to secure the presence of the person by subpoena.&quot;

Although there has been much legal debate about the scope of the material witness statute, it has been clear since the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in &quot;Bacon v. United States&quot;, 449 F.2d 933 (9th Cir. 1971), that the phrase &quot;a criminal proceeding&quot; from the material witness statute includes both trials (uncontroversially) and grand jury investigations. Thus, the ability to arrest material witnesses under the statute extends to the ability to arrest those with information material to a grand jury investigation (assuming the showing of impracticability is also made). The Supreme Court has not had a chance to rule on this statutory issue.

==Detentions of material witnesses after September 11==
After the attacks of September 11, 2001, the United States government announced a campaign of aggressive detention, by whatever means possible, of those potentially involved in attacks on the United States. The means included using the material witness statute to detain even suspects (as opposed to witnesses). Many of those detained as material witnesses were detained as witnesses to grand jury proceedings, which only investigate and are not criminal trials.

This caused controversy for several reasons. Primarily, critics believed that the government&#x27;s use of the material witness statute to detain suspects was an evasion of the Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution, which provides some protections to criminal suspects that were apparently ignored in the arrests of the material witness detainees post-September 11. Secondarily, legal critics took issue with the application of the material witness statute to grand jury proceedings.

Statistics on federal material witness warrant hearings showed a steady decline from 2000 to 2002, from 3603 material witness hearings in FY2000, to 3344 in FY2001 and 2961 in FY2002. During and after that period, the overwhelming majority of material witness warrant hearings took place in judicial districts bordering Mexico and involved illegal alien traffic.

===Attempting to amend the material witness statute===
In 2005, with the intent of alleviating concerns over such use of the material witness statute, Democratic Party Senator Patrick Leahy proposed A Bill to Amend the Material Witness Statute to Strengthen Procedural Safeguards, and for Other Purposes, § 1.
The legislation failed to move forwards, however, after being sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
A 2006 ruling found that material witness law could only be used when an individual is genuinely sought as a witness and there was a ; it is not to be used as a preventive action.

===&quot;Ashcroft v. al-Kidd&quot;===
In 2009 the Ninth Circuit of Appeals in San Francisco, California found in &quot;Ashcroft v. al-Kidd&quot; that former Attorney General John Ashcroft could be sued personally for wrongful detention by Abdullah al-Kidd, an American citizen who was arrested in 2003 and held for 16 days in maximum security prisons to be used as a material witness in the trial of Sami Omar Al-Hussayen. Al-Kidd was never charged or called as a witness. (Al-Hussayen was acquitted in 2004 of all charges of supporting terrorism.)

The circuit court&#x27;s decision was unanimously reversed in &quot;Ashcroft v. al-Kidd&quot; (2011) by the United States Supreme Court on May 31, 2011, affirming the immunity of government officials operating in their official positions.

<text>Greta Scacchi, OMRI (; born 18 February 1960) is an actress known for her roles in the films &quot;White Mischief&quot; (1987), &quot;Presumed Innocent&quot; (1990), &quot;The Player&quot; (1992), &quot;Emma&quot; (1996) and &quot;Looking for Alibrandi&quot; (2000).

Scacchi had her first leading role in the romantic drama film &quot;Heat and Dust&quot; (1983), for which she received a BAFTA Award nomination. For her portrayal of Alexandra of Hesse in the biographical television film &quot;&quot; (1996), she earned a Primetime Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award nomination. Scacchi received another Primetime Emmy Award nomination for her performance in the Western television film &quot;Broken Trail&quot; (2006).

==Early life==
Scacchi was born on 18 February 1960 in Milan, Italy, the daughter of Luca Scacchi, an Italian art dealer and painter, and Pamela Risbey, an English dancer and antiques dealer. Scacchi&#x27;s parents divorced when she was four, and her mother returned to her native United Kingdom with Greta and her two older brothers, first to London, then to Haywards Heath, West Sussex. 

In 1975, after Scacchi&#x27;s mother&#x27;s remarriage, the family moved to Perth, Western Australia, where her stepfather was a visiting professor at the University of Western Australia (UWA). While in Perth, Scacchi attended Hollywood Senior High School and joined UWA&#x27;s University Dramatic Society, where she made her theatrical debut at the New Dolphin Theatre in Edward Bond&#x27;s play &quot;Early Morning&quot; under director Arne Neeme. In 1977, Scacchi returned to the United Kingdom to study at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, where her contemporaries included Miranda Richardson and Amanda Redman.

==Career==
Scacchi&#x27;s first on-screen role was in the first season finale of &quot;Bergerac&quot; in 1981, when she played a model who was the girlfriend of an international criminal being pursued by the eponymous detective. The following year, she made her film debut in the German film &quot;&quot;. 

Scacchi&#x27;s first leading role was in the British film &quot;Heat and Dust&quot; (1983), opposite Shashi Kapoor and Julie Christie; her performance earned a BAFTA nomination for Best Newcomer to Film. She went on to give performances in films such as &quot;The Ebony Tower&quot; (1984), &quot;The Coca-Cola Kid&quot; (1985), &quot;White Mischief&quot; (1987), &quot;Presumed Innocent&quot; (1990), &quot;The Player&quot; (1992) and &quot;Country Life&quot; (1994). She turned down the role of Catherine Trammell in &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; (1992). She later reflected on her early career: &quot;It was very clear to me even then that I was always being invited to play a male fantasy. I had to work very hard to punch some integrity into the idea of being a woman when I was placed inside that male gaze.&quot;

In 1996, Scacchi won an Emmy Award for her portrayal of Alexandra of Hesse in the television film &quot;&quot;, and was nominated for a Golden Globe and numerous other awards. In 1999, she had a role as an Italian-Australian single mother in the Australian film &quot;Looking for Alibrandi&quot;, a performance for which she won the 2000 AFI award for Best Supporting Actress.

In 2007, Scacchi received an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie for &quot;Broken Trail&quot;.

Scacchi is fluent in English, French, German, and Italian, which has made her a popular choice for European casting directors.

Scacchi has performed in a wide range of parts in theatre. She appeared &quot;In Times Like These&quot; (Bristol Old Vic) and &quot;Cider with Rosie&quot; (Phoenix Arts Theatre, Leicester) as her film career was taking off. After making four films in 15 months, in 1985 she appeared with Mark Rylance and Kevin McNally in &quot;Airbase&quot; (Oxford Playhouse and Arts Theatre). In &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; at the Vaudeville Theatre, London, in 1987, she played opposite Michael Gambon and Jonathan Pryce. In 1991, she played Nora in Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; in the Festival of Perth. A year later, she played the lead role in Strindberg&#x27;s &quot;Miss Julie&quot; for the Sydney Theatre Company. She returned to Sydney in 1996 to play Cecilia in Sam Shepard&#x27;s &quot;Simpatico&quot;. In 1999, she took the lead in &quot;Easy Virtue&quot; in Chichester, directed by actress Maria Aitken.

In 2001, Scacchi returned to Sydney for Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;Old Times&quot;, directed by Aarne Neeme, playing Kate. In 2004, she toured Italy with an Italian production &quot;Vecchi Tempi&quot; of the same play, but this time playing Anne. In 2005, she performed at the Theatre Royal, Bath, in Thea Sharrock&#x27;s production of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Private Lives&quot;. Back in Australia in 2008, she was nominated for a Sydney Theatre Best Actress Award for playing Queen Elizabeth in Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Mary Stuart&quot; in Sydney. In that year, Scacchi also performed in Terence Rattigan&#x27;s &quot;The Deep Blue Sea&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Bath, on tour and then in the West End back at the Vaudeville Theatre. 
In 2010, Scacchi replaced an injured Kristin Scott Thomas in the Chatelet Theatre, Paris in the French premiere (37 years after it was written) of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;A Little Night Music&quot;. As Desiree she sang &quot;Send In The Clowns&quot;. 
In May 2011, Scacchi appeared alongside Anita Dobson in the play &quot;Bette and Joan&quot; at London&#x27;s Arts Theatre, written by Anton Burge and directed by Bill Alexander, about the personal and professional relationship between Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. At the end of that year she appeared at the Ensemble Theatre, Sydney in David Williamson&#x27;s new play, &quot;Nothing Personal&quot;.

In September 2013, Jonathan Miller directed a gala performance of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot; at The Old Vic in London. Scacchi played Regan.

In 2014, Scacchi played Arkadina in Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Seagull&quot; in Perth. In 2015, she joined the Headlong theatre company to star on a UK tour in Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; as Amanda. 
Between 20 August and 12 November 2016, Scacchi played Phoebe Rice opposite Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s Archie Rice in a revival of John Osborne&#x27;s &quot;The Entertainer&quot; at the Garrick Theatre in London&#x27;s West End. The play received mixed reviews but hers were uniformly positive.

In June 2024, Scacchi returned to the role of Joan in &quot;Darby and Joan&quot; after the show was renewed for a second series.

==Personal life==
Scacchi is an Italian citizen by birth. She applied for British citizenship after turning 18, but was refused and refused again on appeal; she later applied again due to Brexit. She is a citizen of Italy, Australia and the United Kingdom.

From 1983 to 1989, Scacchi was in a relationship with New Zealand musician Tim Finn. She had a four-year relationship with American actor Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio, with whom she has a daughter, actress Leila George. She was previously the mother-in-law of actor Sean Penn, who was married to George from 2020 to 2022.

In 1997, Scacchi began a relationship with her first cousin, Carlo Mantegazza. They have a son.

Scacchi is an active supporter of campaigns and organisations that promote environmental causes. She has supported Greenpeace and Christian Aid&#x27;s climate change campaign. In 2009, she posed nude with a codfish to promote the documentary &quot;The End of the Line&quot;, a film exposing the effects of overfishing. She continues to lead the linked Fishlove campaign, which has seen a host of well known actors pose for photographs with a variety of fish.

In October 2013, Scacchi was awarded the Cavaliere Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana (Knight in the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic) for her services to the arts.

<doc id="796500" wikidata="Q7886774" url="?curid=796500" title="Union security agreement">
<text>A union security agreement is a contractual agreement, usually part of a union collective bargaining agreement, in which an employer and a trade or labor union agree on the extent to which the union may compel employees to join the union, and/or whether the employer will collect dues, fees, and assessments on behalf of the union.

==Rationale==
The free-rider problem is often cited as the rationale for union security agreements. A classic study of the free rider problem is presented in Mancur Olson&#x27;s 1965 work, &quot;The Logic of Collective Action.&quot; In labor relations, the free rider problem exists because the costs of organizing a union and negotiating a contract with the employer can be very high, and because employers will find it too cumbersome to adopt multiple wage and benefit scales, some or all non-union members may find that the contract benefits them as well.

Thus, the incentive is for some individual workers to &quot;ride for free&quot; by not paying the costs, which can lead to the collapse of the union and no collective bargaining agreement. If the union collapses, each worker may be worse off than if the union had negotiated the agreement. Union security agreements are one way of ensuring that all (or nearly all) workers pay their fair share of the costs of collective bargaining (e.g., join the union and pay dues).

One solution is for the state to provide rights (such as the right to administer welfare or pension funds, or to participate in a works council) or benefits (such as unemployment insurance) only to unions or their members. Another solution is for unions to engage in members-only collective bargaining, which restricts the benefits of the contract to union members.

==Legal status==
The International Labour Organization&#x27;s Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention can &quot;in no way be interpreted as authorising or prohibiting union security arrangements, such questions being matters for regulation in accordance with national practice.&quot;

Union security agreements are explicitly mentioned in the labor laws of many countries. They are highly regulated by law and court rulings in the United States and to a lesser degree in the United Kingdom. In Canada, the legal status of the union security agreement varies from province to province and at the federal level, with a few provinces permitting but not requiring it but the majority of provinces (and the federal government) requiring it if the union requests it.

In most Western European countries, the closed shop (one form of the union security agreement) is typically banned, while other forms typically go unregulated in labor law. This is not universal; for example, in Germany both the right to join a union and the right &quot;not&quot; to join a union are equally protected by law and the courts, and all forms of union security agreements are banned. The law in Belgium has similar provisions. Still, since participation in the unemployment insurance system is compulsory and only unions have the right to administer this system, union membership in Belgium remains high.

Outside North America and Western Europe, the legal status of union security agreements varies even more widely. In New Zealand, as of 1988, the closed shop was compulsory where a union organized the workplace. In the Philippines, various types of union security agreements are permitted under labor law. In Mexico, the closed shop was mandatory until the early 1990s, when a change in federal law permitted the union shop, agency shop, or no agreement at all. But because of the political ties between unions and the governing party in Mexico and other ways in which Mexican law favors established unions, the closed shop is essentially still the norm.

Many countries, however, have not addressed the issue of union security agreements. Neither Indonesian nor Thai labor law addresses the issue, and in both countries collective bargaining, union administrative procedures, and dues collection are so weak that the union security issues rarely arise. In Australia, the legal status of union security agreements has varied widely across each state and the national government and over time. Australian labor law does not explicitly regulate union security agreements. However, various forms of the union security agreement have been favored at one time or another by each state, territory, or the national government, effectively regulating the favored type of union security agreement and disadvantaging its other forms.

==Types==
Various types of union security agreements exist. Among the more common are:
*Closed shop—The employer agrees to hire only union members. An employee who resigns from the union must be dismissed.
*Union shop—The employer may hire anyone regardless of their union membership status, but the employee must join the union within a set time period (such as 30 days). An employee who resigns from the union must be dismissed.
*Agency shop—The employer may hire anyone regardless of their union membership status, and the employee need not join the union. However, all non-union employees must pay a fee (known as the &quot;agency fee&quot;) to the union to cover the costs of collective bargaining (and, in some countries, other fees as well). An employee who resigns from the union may not be dismissed but must pay the agency fee.
*Fair share provision—The employer may hire anyone regardless of their union membership status, and the employee need not join the union. However, all non-union employees must pay a fee (known as the &quot;fair share fee&quot;) to the union to cover the costs of collective bargaining. An employee who resigns from the union may not be dismissed but must pay the fair share fee. In public sector collective bargaining, where the agency shop is often outlawed, the fair share provision (almost identical to the agency fee) may be negotiated instead.
*Dues checkoff—A contract between the employer and union where the employer agrees to collect the dues, fees, assessments, and other monies from union members and/or non-members directly from each worker&#x27;s paycheck and transmit those funds to the union on a regular basis.

&quot;Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Council 31&quot;, _ US _ (2018) is a US labor law case, concerning whether governments violate the First Amendment when they require their employees to pay fees to a union as a condition of employment.

In February 2015, Illinois Republican Governor Bruce Rauner filed suit, claiming that fair-share agreements are unconstitutional and a violation of the First Amendment right to free speech.

In March 2015, three government workers from Illinois represented by attorneys from the Illinois-based Liberty Justice Center and Virginia-based National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation took legal action to intervene in the case. In May 2015, Rauner was dropped from the case, after a federal judge ruled that the governor did not have standing to bring such a suit, but the case proceeded under a new name, &quot;Janus v. AFSCME.&quot; The case is named after Mark Janus, an Illinois child support specialist covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

Janus claimed that he should not need to pay fees to the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees because doing so constitutes paying for political speech with which Janus disagrees. This became permissible after a 1977 decision by the US Supreme Court in &quot;Abood v. Detroit Board of Education&quot;.

In June 2018, the US Supreme Court ruled in favor of Janus, in a 5–4 decision, and stated that &quot;States and public-sector unions may no longer extract agency fees from nonconsenting employees&quot;.

<text>is an anime television series produced by Sunrise. It was originally aired across the Japanese Wowow television network from April 7 to June 30, 1999. It is a spin-off of the manga &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; by Takehiko Itō.

==Premise==
The story follows the 16-year-old protagonist, Meifon Li, who becomes the head of a corporation dedicated to saving transportation companies in outer space from pirates for free, as per her grandfather&#x27;s dying wish. As the series progresses, she learns a terrifying secret about her grandfather and the reason for his wish.
==History==
A series of light novels titled , written and illustrated by Ibuki Hideaki, began publication prior to the anime series. The anime was released in the U.S. by Bandai. The characters Duuz and Valeria are from an episode of &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; titled &quot;Law and Lawlessness&quot;, and work for Meifon, although there are difference in their personalities between the two shows.

==Characters==

:The protagonist. Here is leader of the pirate-fighting service known as Angel Links. She is an excited and romantic teenager who takes her job seriously, but shows a relaxed side when she&#x27;s not on duty. Meifon&#x27;s most noteworthy trait is her large bust, and is often the subject of fanservice because of it. Her partner in battle is Taffei, who hides in her cleavage until Meifon calls for his help (Taffei transforms into a unique blade that has the visual qualities of angelic and demonic).Meifon excels at both martial arts and swordsmanship. She has a hotblooded side, and like Duuz she enjoys a good fight. Meifon is plagued with a strange past that unveils itself as the anime moves forward.

Meifon is voiced by Ryoka Yuzuki in Japanese and Mariette Sluyter in English.

:Meifon&#x27;s left-hand man and the one in charge of various departments such as the payroll for the company. On ship, he usually takes a passive role as Meifon&#x27;s advisor. He also prepares tea occasionally during a relatively minor battle. Kosei originally served Meifon&#x27;s grandfather Chenho Li, which explains his willingness to always assist Meifon. Generally a well-mannered young man who is popular with women because of his attractive appearance, Kosei strives to do everything in a just and timely method. When it comes to battle, Kosei does not show much participation, but has some skill with a number of firearms.

:Kosei is voiced by Hikaru Midorikawa in Japanese and Tommy Campbell in English.

:Originally appeared in &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; as a member of a pirate-fighting group called Angel Links, Valeria Vertone is the ship&#x27;s tactician. Most of the time, when the enemies are nothing too serious for the crew, Valeria is calmly relaxing in her seat, painting or filing her fingernails. She used to be a tactician for the Einhorn Empire and was their top strategist despite being so young at the time, but was put on trial for disobeying orders and getting most of her fleet killed during one mission. She also had a lover named Lawrence during her time in Einhorn, but had to drop the relationship when she was exiled. When Meifon is not present on the ship, Valeria assumes role as commander.

:Valeria wields a tonfa as well as kickboxing (in which she also trains when she is off duty). In contrast to her &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; appearance, the major differences are her hair (which is far more wild-looking, including a more defined red streak which can only be seen in her final scene in &quot;Law and Lawlessness&quot; and on the opposite side) and her personality (which is more relaxed in comparison to being so &quot;by-the-book&quot; in &quot;Outlaw Star&quot;). She is also the only character among the crew who could be considered Duuz&#x27;s friend, out of respect for one another&#x27;s battle talents and perhaps because they are closer in age than the other crew members, who are teenagers to young adults.

:Valeria is voiced by Atsuko Tanaka in Japanese and Elizabeth Stepkowski in English.

:Originally appeared in &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; as a stubborn, hotheaded officer of a pirate-fighting group called Angel Links. He is much more relaxed than his Outlaw Star incarnation and tends to view humans as &quot;very&quot; inferior to his people. Duuz is the ship&#x27;s Platoon Commander.

:Known for being the most powerful among his people (called Dragonites in &quot;Angel Links&quot; rather than Saurians), he is unmatched in swordsmanship and barehanded combat. Highly powerful and deadly, Duuz fights battles alone (though he is assisted by Meifon, Kosei and Valeria occasionally) and never seems to suffer any kind of damage. He is so skilled that he can deflect bullets with his sword. Incidentally, like Valeria, he is often the most calm member of the entire crew, silently polishing his cherished sword on the ship or doing crossword puzzles. He is also wise and contemplative, and is able to read the enemies&#x27; moves with little trouble as well as give advice like a &quot;wise dragon&quot; would. Duuz is a vegetarian, and does not like seafood.

:Duuz is voiced by Kenji Utsumi in Japanese and Dave Kelly in English.

==Media==

===Publications===
&quot;Angel Links&quot; was first drafted as a light novel series titled &quot;Hoshi Hou Yuugeki Tai Angel Links&quot;, penned by Ibuki Hideaki and published under the Fujimi Shobo &quot;Dragon Magazine&quot; label. A total of four novels were produced and published between April 1998 and August 1999.

A single-volume manga based on the &quot;Angel Links&quot; anime series was published by Kadokawa Shoten on January 12, 1999. An art book titled was published by Gakken in Japan on July 27, 1999. Another artbook covering illustrations by character designer Asako Nishida features the artist&#x27;s contributions to the &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; and &quot;Angel Links&quot; series.

===Anime===

The 13 episodes that comprise the &quot;Angel Links&quot; anime series originally aired on Japan&#x27;s Wowow television network from April 7 to June 30, 1999.

Yet another box set titled &quot;Emotion the Best: Seihō Tenshi Angel Links&quot; was released in Japan on September 24, 2010. The anime was later licensed for English language distribution in North America by Bandai Entertainment. It was initially released in this region on DVD in four separate volumes and was later compiled into a &quot;Complete Collection&quot; box set on July 1, 2003. Finally, the series was re-released in a box set as part of Bandai&#x27;s &quot;Anime Legends&quot; label on April 25, 2006.

<doc id="796511" wikidata="Q670323" url="?curid=796511" title="Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center">
<text>The Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center is a concert hall located in the Arts District of downtown Dallas, Texas, US. Ranked one of the world&#x27;s greatest orchestra halls, it was designed by architect I. M. Pei and acoustician Russell Johnson&#x27;s Artec Consultants. The structural engineers for this project was Leslie E. Robertson Associates, and it opened in September 1989.

The center is named for Morton Meyerson, former president of Electronic Data Systems and former chairman and CEO of Perot Systems, who led the 10-year effort by the Dallas Symphony Association to create a home for the Dallas Symphony Orchestra. The new concert center was named in his honor in 1986 at the request of Ross Perot, who made a $10 million contribution to the building fund for the naming rights. It is the permanent home of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and the Dallas Symphony Chorus, as well as the primary performing venue of the Dallas Wind Symphony and several other Dallas-based musical organizations. The Meyerson Symphony Center is owned by the City of Dallas and operated by the Dallas Symphony Association.

There are four private suites, for small concerts, meetings and events designed by Booziotis &amp; Company Architects of Dallas.

== Design ==
The exterior of the large pavilion and lobby is circular and constructed of glass and metal supports to contrast with the solid geometric lines of the actual hall. Architect I. M. Pei, and structural engineer Leslie E. Robertson Associates has described the structure of the hall&#x27;s interior as &quot;very conservative&quot;. &quot;It is conservative for reasons I no longer accept&quot;, he said in 2000. &quot;I feel that the hall doesn&#x27;t fully represent what I would have liked to do. It was my first one.&quot; Because the music performed in the hall was likely to be from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Pei was unwilling to impose modern styles of architecture on the interior.

The trustees and acoustic team had decided on the shoebox style before Pei was hired, and he sought to sculpt the exteriors with more innovative designs. &quot;I felt the need to be free&quot;, he said. &quot;Therefore, to wrap another form around the shoebox, I started to use curvilinear forms... It does have some spatial excitement in that space for that reason.&quot;

===Organ===
The Meyerson Symphony Center also is home to the 4,535 pipe C. B. Fisk Op. 100 organ, known as the Lay Family Concert Organ. Although it had been Charles Fisk&#x27;s dream to build a monumental concert organ (the firm unsuccessfully bid on the contract for San Francisco&#x27;s Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall), and despite years of planning and design, he never lived to see it built, dying in 1983. The resulting instrument, built in 1991 and nearly unanimously hailed as a musical triumph, whilst it built on some of his ideas, was quite different from his original designs. The première performance was given in September 1992 by organists Michael Murray and David Higgs.

=== Acoustics ===

The Eugene McDermott Concert Hall was designed by Artec Consultants (also responsible for the Pikes Peak Center&#x27;s El Pomar Great Hall). Artec&#x27;s Nicholas Edwards built upon ideas of Russell Johnson, the firm&#x27;s founder, combining them with his own research and those of the German group in Göttingen. Systematically working through each area of the hall on each level, he generated sketches that indicated the best placement for walls in order to optimize the all-important lateral reflections. As his ideas crystallized, he began calling the evolving room shape the ‘reverse fan’. This was the eventual shape of both the Dallas concert hall and its younger sibling, Symphony Hall in Birmingham, England. Both these halls have strong ‘shoebox’ shaping, with the ‘reverse fan’ at the back of the room. 74 thick concrete chamber doors around the top of the hall weighing 2.5 tons each can be opened and closed to increase or reduce reverberance, 56 acoustical curtains help diminish sound vibrations and a system of canopies weighing more than 42 tons is suspended above the stage and can be raised, lowered, or tilted to reflect the sound throughout the audience chamber. The shoebox design was intended to achieve acoustical performance comparable to that of the Vienna Musikverein and the Amsterdam Concertgebouw. Russell Johnson, who died in August 2007, requested in his will that he be buried in the Meyerson, but logistical complications prevented the request from being granted.

=== Statistics ===
The Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center has:
* above ground space

<text>К-3 was a project 627 &quot;Кит&quot; (&quot;kit&quot;, meaning &quot;whale&quot;; NATO reporting name &quot;&quot;) submarine of the Soviet Navy&#x27;s Northern Fleet, the first nuclear submarine of the Soviet Union. The vessel was prototyped in wood, with each of five segments scattered between five different locations about Leningrad, including the Astoria Hotel. She was built in Molotovsk, launched on 9 August 1957, commissioned in July 1958, and homeported at Zapadnaya Litsa on the Kola Peninsula. K-3 was designed by Vladimir Peregoudov. Her initial captain was Leonid Osipenko, and the executive officer was Lev Zhiltsov, who had the important task of assembling the first crew.

==Arctic voyage==
On 17 June 1962, by this time under the command of Zhiltsov, К-3 reached the North Pole underwater, the first among Soviet submarines (a feat performed nearly four years earlier by ). The submarine also surfaced on the Pole (a feat performed three years before by ). For this voyage, she was awarded the name &quot;Leninsky Komsomol&quot; (&quot;Ленинский Комсомол&quot;) on 9 October 1962, and her crew, rather than training in military operations, began taking part in many congresses and conferences. This idle life continued until Summer 1967 when a boat that had been scheduled for patrol in the Mediterranean Sea was unavailable. &quot;Leninsky Komsomol&quot; was tasked with that patrol. She was assigned a new commander, Captain Second Rank Stepanov, and her executive officer arrived aboard only two hours before she put to sea. Whatever the initial material condition of the boat, the crew was not ready for sea. By the time they reached the Mediterranean, the air regeneration system had failed and the temperature on board was .

Once in the Mediterranean, &quot;Leninsky Komsomol&quot; was given the mission of following an American ballistic missile submarine.

==1967 accident==
On 8 September 1967, while transiting the Norwegian Sea, a fire broke out in the submarine&#x27;s hydraulic system, and crew members in the compartment when the fire broke out had to evacuate the compartment. The flames spread to other parts of the submarine. The automatic extinguishers were based on carbon dioxide gas, which killed the crew members who were in the first and second compartments in the submarine. When the dividing door in the bulkhead from the third compartment was opened to see what had happened to the people in the second compartment, the gas spread, and more people lost consciousness. The forward compartments were then completely sealed off, and the submarine surfaced. Four days later, &quot;Leninsky Komsomol&quot; returned to base. 39 crew members died in the fire.

The subsequent investigation determined that the most probable cause of the fire was ignition of an explosive concentration of hydraulic oil, and that the reactions of the crew were prompt and correct. Numerous awards were recommended for the crew, including seven nominations for Hero of Soviet Union—four of them posthumous. A later commission from Moscow, however, found a cigarette lighter in the torpedo compartment and found the position of a sailor&#x27;s body suspicious. They ruled that the sailor&#x27;s smoking had caused the fire and prohibited any award.

In 1991 a memorial was erected in Zapadnaya Litsa to the men lost aboard К-3. In 2007 the Russian Awards Committee (Российский наградной комитет) issued the medal &quot;For 50 Years Of The Submarine &quot;Leninskiy Komsomol&quot;&quot;.

== Retirement ==
The submarine was decommissioned in 1988. Since its retirement the K-3 has been docked at the Nerpa Shipyard, Murmansk The K-3 is set to become part of The Museum of Naval Glory in Kronstadt and is expected to be open for visitors by early 2023.

<doc id="796543" wikidata="Q3809150" url="?curid=796543" title="John Chaney (basketball, born 1932)">
<text>John Chaney (January 21, 1932 – January 29, 2021) was an American college basketball coach, best known for his success at Temple University from 1982 through 2006. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2001 and the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006.

==Early life and playing career==
Chaney was born in Jacksonville, Florida, but grew up in Philadelphia. He began his career after graduating from Bethune–Cookman College and spending some time in the Eastern Professional Basketball League, first with the Sunbury Mercuries from 1955 to 1963 and Williamsport Billies from 1963 to 1966.

==Coaching career==
Chaney first became a basketball coach in 1963 at William L. Sayre Junior High School (now high school) at 58th and Walnut Street in Philadelphia. His teams had a 59–9 win–loss record in three seasons. Inheriting a one-win team in 1966 at Simon Gratz High School in Philadelphia, Chaney compiled a 63–23 record in six seasons.

Chaney&#x27;s first collegiate position was at Cheyney State College, where he coached the Cheyney Wolves in the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s (NCAA) Division II. At Cheyney, Chaney had a 232–56 record. Cheyney won the 1978 NCAA Division II men&#x27;s basketball tournament.

After a decade at Cheyney, Chaney moved on to Temple University in 1982, where he coached the Temple Owls in NCAA Division I. Chaney built a reputation as a tough coach who always demanded excellence on and off the court. He was well known for his early-morning practices, match-up zone defense, tough non-conference scheduling, and winning basketball teams. He won the Henry Iba Award, given annually to the best college basketball coach by the United States Basketball Writers Association, in 1987 and 1988.

On February 13, 1994, Chaney threatened to kill then-University of Massachusetts Amherst coach John Calipari at a post-game news conference, where Calipari was speaking at a podium. Chaney entered the conference mid-speech, calling him an &quot;Italian son-of-a-bitch,&quot; accusing Calipari of manipulating the referees. When Calipari attempted to respond to the accusations, Chaney yelled, &quot;Shut up...!&quot;, and proceeded to charge the stage, before being stopped by security. While being held back, Chaney shouted, &quot;When I see you, I&#x27;m gonna kick your ass!&quot; As security restrained Chaney, he repeatedly yelled, &quot;I&#x27;ll kill you!&quot; and angrily admitted telling his players to &quot;knock your fucking kids in the mouth.&quot; Chaney received a one-game suspension for the incident. The two coaches later reconciled. Chaney praised Calipari&#x27;s coaching ability and defended him over the Derrick Rose controversy at the University of Memphis.

On December 20, 2004, during a win over Princeton, Chaney became the fifth active coach and 19th all-time to appear on the sidelines for 1,000 games, joining Lou Henson (New Mexico State, Illinois), Bob Knight (Army, Indiana, Texas Tech), Eddie Sutton (Creighton, Arkansas, Kentucky, Oklahoma State, San Francisco), and Hugh Durham (Florida State, Georgia, Jacksonville).

In 2005, Chaney ordered backup forward Nehemiah Ingram into the game to commit hard fouls against Big 5 rival Saint Joseph&#x27;s in response to what he thought were several missed calls by the referees. After the game Chaney admitted to &quot;sending a message&quot; and stated &quot;I&#x27;m going to send in what we used to do years ago, send in the goons.&quot; John Bryant of Saint Joseph&#x27;s suffered a fractured arm as a result of an intentional foul. Following the incident, he suspended himself for one game, and upon hearing the severity of the injury, the university suspended him for the remainder of the regular season. Chaney self-extended the suspension to that year&#x27;s Atlantic 10 Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament.

On March 13, 2006, Chaney announced his retirement from coaching at a press conference, effective after Temple&#x27;s play in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT). Fran Dunphy was named Chaney&#x27;s successor following the season. Chaney was later inducted into the Big 5 Hall of Fame, which recognizes the best in Philadelphia&#x27;s college basketball history. Chaney won a total of 741 career games. He took Temple to the NCAA tournament 17 times. His 1987–88 Owls team entered the NCAA tournament ranked #1 in the country, and he reached the Elite Eight on five occasions. In 2001, Chaney was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Chaney and his wife Jeanne had a daughter, Pamela, and two sons, Darryl and John Jr. Chaney died on January 29, 2021, at the age of 89.

<doc id="796545" wikidata="Q314765" url="?curid=796545" title="Alessandro Stradella">
<text>Antonio Alessandro Boncompagno Stradella (Bologna, 3 July 1643 – Genoa, 25 February 1682) was an Italian composer of the middle Baroque period. He enjoyed a dazzling career as a freelance composer, writing on commission, and collaborating with distinguished poets, producing over three hundred works in a variety of genres.

==Life==

Stradella was born in Bologna on 3 July 1643 to the aristocrats Marc&#x27;Antonio Stradella (1579-1649) from Nepi (in the province of Viterbo), and his second wife, Vittoria Bartoli from Orvieto, and baptised Antonio Alessandro Boncompagno Stradella on 1 August 1643 in Bologna. His godfather in proxy was , who had appointed his father vice-marquis of Vignola on 7 June 1642. Although the family resided in Nepi, they were temporarily in Bologna, taking refuge from papal troops attacking Vignola.

He was educated at Rome, and was already making a name for himself as a composer at the age of 24. In 1667 he composed a Latin oratorio (lost) for the Confraternity of Crocifisso di San Marcello and in the following year the serenata &quot;La Circe&quot; for the Princess of Rossano Olimpia Aldobrandini Pamphilj. In 1671–72 he collaborated in staging some operas, two by Francesco Cavalli and two by Antonio Cesti, at the Tordinona Theater, composing prologues, intermedios and new arias. In the early 1670s, he also composed some operas performed in private theatres of aristocratic families.

Stradella began to live a dissolute life. With Carlo Ambrogio Lonati he attempted to embezzle money from the Roman Catholic Church, but was found out: he fled the city, only returning much later when he thought it was safe. His numerous incautious affairs with women began to make him enemies among the powerful men of the city, and he had to leave Rome for good.

In 1677 he went to Venice, where he was hired by a powerful nobleman, Alvise Contarini, as the music tutor to his mistress, Agnese Van Uffele. She and Stradella began an affair and fled Venice together for Turin, where they were protected by Marie Jeanne Baptiste of Savoy-Nemours, the regent of Savoy. Contarini followed and instructed the Archbishop that Uffele and Stradella must marry or that Uffele must take the veil. She did the latter, and then the two married in October; however, as Stradella left the convent after signing the contract, he was attacked from behind on 10 October by two would-be-hired assassins, who believed him dead when they left him in the street. He survived and the two assassins took asylum with the French ambassador. That Contarini had hired the attackers became known, leading to complaints from the regent of Savoy to Louis XIV; the matter became a topic of negotiation between the courts. In 1678 Stradella fled to Genoa, where he met again with Lonati. He was paid to compose operas performed at Falcone Theatre and music for the local nobility.

==Murder==
In 1682 he was stabbed to death at the Piazza Banchi. A nobleman of the Lomellini family hired the killer which put an end to Stradella&#x27;s life, although the identity of the killer was never discovered. Another report of his murderers states: &quot;Stradella was murdered at Genoa by three brothers of the name of Lomellini, whose sister he had seduced&quot;. Stradella was buried in the Santa Maria delle Vigne.

==Work==
Stradella was an extremely influential composer at the time, though his fame was eclipsed in the next century by Corelli, Vivaldi and others. Some of his music was exploited by George Frideric Handel, for example in &quot;Israel in Egypt.&quot; Probably his greatest significance is in originating the &quot;concerto grosso&quot;: while Corelli in his Op. 6 was the first to publish works under this title, Stradella clearly uses the format earlier in one of his &quot;Sonate di viole&quot;. Since the two knew each other, a direct influence is likely.

Stradella wrote at least six baroque operas including a full-length comic opera &quot;Il Trespolo tutore&quot;. He also wrote more than 170 cantatas, at least one of which was based on a poem by Sebastiano Baldini, and six oratorios. Stradella composed 27 separate instrumental pieces, most for strings and basso continuo, and typically in the &quot;sonata da chiesa&quot; format.

He wrote two cantatas for the regent of Savoy, &quot;Se del pianeta ardente&quot; and &quot;Sciogliete i dolci nodi&quot;.

==Legacy==
His colourful life and his bloody death ordered by the powerful Lomellini family provided the basis for biographical operas such as &quot;Il cantore di Venezia&quot; by Virginio Marchi (1835), &quot;Stradella&quot; by Louis Niedermeyer (Paris, 1837), &quot;Stradella&quot; by César Franck (1841, unfinished), &quot;Alessandro Stradella&quot; by Friedrich von Flotow (Hamburg, 1844), &quot;Alessandro Stradella&quot; by Adolf Schimon (1846), &quot;Stradella il trovatore&quot; by Vincenzo Moscuzza (1850), &quot;Alessandro Stradella&quot; by Giuseppe Sinico (1864) and &quot;Ti vedo, ti sento, mi perdo&quot; by Salvatore Sciarrino (Teatro alla Scala, 2017).

American novelist F. Marion Crawford also produced a highly romanticized novel of Stradella&#x27;s affair and flight from Venice, titled &quot;Stradella&quot; (Macmillan 1909).

<doc id="796564" wikidata="Q3312691" url="?curid=796564" title="Midlands (Tasmania)">
<text>The Midlands is a region of Tasmania between Launceston and Hobart. It also refers to the relatively flat, dry agricultural area, so named because it covers the region between the two cities. Its name is probably also influenced from the Midlands in the United Kingdom. It lends its name to the Southern Midlands Council, Northern Midlands Council, and the Midland Highway. The region is sometimes conflated or confused with the adjacent region of the Central Highlands—with the added term &quot;Tasmania&#x27;s heartland&quot;.

==Geography==
Most of the Midlands is a region of relatively low plains drained mostly by tributaries of the Tamar River in the north and Jordan River in the south. The natural vegetation was predominantly grassland, but all of it is either grazed by cattle and sheep or cleared for growing better pasture species. On the eastern side it rises into low, unglaciated dolerite hills and mountains, largely covered with dry sclerophyllous forests, but on the west lies the high doleritic Lake Country, which was extensively glaciated during Quaternary glacial periods and is covered with large numbers of lakes consequently carved into the very hard and erosion-resistant rock.

The climate of the Midlands is the driest in Tasmania, with annual rainfalls ranging from . Rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year and the region is less prone to very heavy rainfalls than the eastern coast of Tasmania. Because it is not surrounded by sea, the Midlands has both the warmest summers and some of the coldest winters in Tasmania. In summer, maximum temperatures average , whilst in winter most days have frosts, sometimes severe. The lowest temperature in the region is around in 1902, when snow fell in Hobart city.

Owing to the relatively low rainfall and the presence of recently eroded fertile dolerite rocks, the soils are the most fertile in all of Tasmania. Most of them are quite close to the chernozems of Asia and North America, and consequently the Midlands is rich grazing land supporting intensive rearing of sheep. Some grain crops are also grown, though the summers are rather cool for them.

<doc id="796570" wikidata="Q7292473" url="?curid=796570" title="Randy Thorsteinson">
<text>Randy Thorsteinson (born November 8, 1956) is a politician and businessman in Red Deer, Alberta, Canada.

==Early years==
Thorsteinson was born in Gimli, Manitoba and spent his youth living in Winnipeg, Manitoba; Edmonton, Alberta; Calgary, Alberta; and Grande Prairie, Alberta.

==Education==
He attended St. Paul&#x27;s High School in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

Thorsteinson attended Ricks College (now Brigham Young University-Idaho campus) for two years followed by two years at Brigham Young University (Utah) majoring in business management.

==Business ventures==
Following university Thorsteinson spent three years as Retail Sales Manager for Travelaire Trailer Canada Ltd. in Red Deer, Alberta.

He was one of the founders of Carlson Tours and Incentive Travel Ltd. in 1984 which subsequently changed its name to Cascadia Motivation Inc. Thorsteinson is the Chief Operating Officer of the company. Cascadia Motivation works with Canadian businesses to improve their performance levels and achieve their objectives.

==Political career==
Thorsteinson entered politics as president of the Red Deer riding association of the Reform Party of Canada in 1988 and served in this position for three years.

In 1988 Thorsteinson served as the campaign manager for Michael Roth, the Reform Party candidate in Red Deer riding. Roth finished second to Doug Fee (PC) with just under 10,000 votes.

===Leader of Social Credit===
Thorsteinson joined the Alberta Social Credit Party in 1991, and became leader the following year.

Under Thorsteinson, Social Credit experienced the beginnings of a rebirth, and in the 1997 general election, the party nominated 70 candidates and collected 64,667 votes (almost seven per cent of the popular vote). This was Social Credit&#x27;s best result since 1979, but it failed to win any seats in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta.

By 1999, however, Thorsteinson, a convert to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, was at odds with his party after a movement within the party to limit the involvement of Latter-day Saints. Thorsteinson quit the party in April 1999 and was a founder of the Alberta First Party but was not active in the party.

===Leader of the Alberta Alliance===
In 2002 Thorsteinson was the founder of the Alberta Alliance Party (which changed its name to Wildrose Alliance in 2008). The party met the registration requirements and he became the party&#x27;s leader at the Party Founding Convention in February 2003.

Thorsteinson&#x27;s new party gained momentum immediately following the 2004 federal election when Edmonton Norwood Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Gary Masyk crossed the floor to join the Alberta Alliance, bringing Alberta Alliance representation into the legislature.

Later that year in the 2004 provincial election, Thorsteinson placed second in votes in his riding of Innisfail-Sylvan Lake, failing to become a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). His party garnered 77,506 votes and won one seat in the election; Paul Hinman was elected MLA for the riding of Cardston-Taber-Warner.

On March 7, 2005, Thorsteinson announced his resignation as leader of the Alberta Alliance, saying he would not be able to devote the time and energy into the party that was required of a leader. Paul Hinman, the lone Alliance MLA in the Legislature succeeded Thorsteinson as leader.

Randy was elected as President of the Alberta Alliance at the 2007 Annual General Meeting held on March 24, 2007 in Edmonton Alberta. He had been serving a short stint as interim president of the party after former president John Murdoch stepped down.

With the merger of the Alberta Alliance Party and the non registered Wildrose Party of Alberta on January 19, 2008, Thorsteinson declined to be a member of the new party and has had no involvement with the renamed Wildrose Alliance Party.

===Strong and Free Alberta PAC===
Thorsteinson is the Chairman of the Strong and Free Alberta Political Action Committee which derives its name from the Alberta provincial motto &quot;Fortis et Liber&quot; (strong and free).

The Strong &amp; Free Alberta Political Action Committee is a political organization promoting conservative fiscal and social policies.

===Leader of the Reform Party of Alberta===
In 2016, Elections Alberta recognized the registration of a new Reform Party of Alberta, with Thorsteinson as its leader. It is the third provincial political party he has led. The socially conservative party intended to run a full slate in the 30th Alberta general election in 2019, but ultimately it presented only one candidate. He intended to run as a local candidate in the Innisfail-Sylvan Lake by-election held on July 12, 2018, but did not. He was, however, the party&#x27;s sole candidate in the 31st Alberta general election in 2023.

<text>West Point () is the westernmost point in Seattle, Washington, United States, jutting into Puget Sound from the Magnolia neighborhood. It also marks the northern extent of Elliott Bay; a line drawn southeastward to Alki Point marks the western extent of the bay. At the point itself is the 1881 West Point Lighthouse, the first staffed light station on Puget Sound. Just to the east is the West Point Treatment Plant, and beyond that, Discovery Park, formerly the U.S. Army&#x27;s Fort Lawton.

The original Lushootseed name for West Point, &quot;&quot;, means &quot;brush spread over water.&quot; West Point was given its English name in 1841 by U.S. Navy lieutenant Charles Wilkes, commander of the United States Exploring Expedition.

In 1992, construction of an expansion to the sewage treatment plant unearthed the archaeological remains of early Coast Salish peoples, including thousands of artifacts from 4,200 years ago.

<doc id="796578" wikidata="Q922169" url="?curid=796578" title="Jamie Dimon">
<text>James Dimon ( ; born March 13, 1956) is an American businessman who has been the chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of JPMorgan Chase since 2006.

Dimon began his career as a management consultant at Management Analysis Center. After earning an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School in 1982, he joined American Express, working there, under the mentorship of Sandy Weill, until 1985. The following year, at age of 30, Dimon was appointed chief financial officer (CFO) of Commercial Credit and later became the firm&#x27;s president. He was chief operating officer (COO) of both the insurer Travelers and the brokerage firm Smith Barney from 1990 to 1998, when he became president of Citigroup. In 2000, he was appointed CEO of Bank One, overseeing its operations until merger with JPMorgan Chase in 2004. Dimon then became COO of JPMorgan Chase, assuming the role of CEO in 2006.

He was on the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York during the late 2010s. Dimon was included in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2006, 2008, 2009, and 2011 lists of the world&#x27;s 100 most influential people. , &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated his net worth at $2.8 billion.

== Early life and education ==
Jamie Dimon was born in New York City and grew up in the Jackson Heights neighborhood of Queens. He is one of three sons of Theodore and Themis (née Kalos) Dimon, who had Greek ancestry. His paternal grandfather was a Greek immigrant who had worked as a banker in Smyrna and Athens and later changed the family name from Papademetriou to Dimon. Dimon has an older brother, Peter, and a fraternal twin brother, Ted. Both his father and grandfather were stockbrokers at Shearson. Jamie attended the Browning School and majored in psychology and economics at Tufts University, graduating &quot;summa cum laude&quot;. At Tufts, he wrote a paper on Shearson&#x27;s mergers, which his mother sent to Sandy Weill, who then hired Dimon to work at Shearson during a summer break, doing budgets.

After graduating, Dimon worked in management consulting at Management Analysis Center for two years before enrolling at Harvard Business School. During the summer while he was a student at Harvard, he worked at Goldman Sachs. He graduated in 1982, earning an MBA as a Baker Scholar. After Dimon&#x27;s graduation from Harvard Business School, Sandy Weill convinced him to turn down offers from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Lehman Brothers to join him as an assistant at American Express. Although Weill could not offer the same amount of money as the investment banks, he promised Dimon that he would have &quot;fun.&quot; Dimon&#x27;s father, Theodore Dimon, was an executive vice president at American Express.

== Career ==

=== Commercial Credit and transition into Citigroup===
Sandy Weill left American Express in 1985, and Dimon followed him. The two then took over Commercial Credit, a consumer finance company, from Control Data. At age 30, Dimon was appointed chief financial officer, helping turn around the company. In 1998, through a series of mergers and acquisitions, Dimon and Weill formed a large financial services conglomerate: Citigroup. But Dimon left Citigroup in November 1998, after Weill asked him to resign during a weekend executive retreat. Rumors at the time suggested that he and Weill had argued, in 1997, over Dimon&#x27;s inaction to promote Weill&#x27;s daughter, Jessica M. Bibliowicz, although that happened more than a year before Dimon&#x27;s departure. At least one other account cites, as the real reason, a request by Dimon to be treated as an equal.

=== Move to J.P. Morgan ===

In March 2000, Dimon became CEO of Bank One, the nation&#x27;s fifth largest bank. When JPMorgan Chase merged with Bank One in July 2004, Dimon became president and chief operating officer of the combined company. On December 31, 2005, he was named CEO of JPMorgan Chase, and on December 31, 2006, he was named chairman and president. In March 2008, he was a Class A board member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Under Dimon&#x27;s leadership, with the acquisitions during his tenure, JPMorgan Chase has become the leading U.S. bank in domestic assets under management, market capitalization value and publicly traded stock value. In 2009, Dimon was considered one of &quot;The TopGun CEOs&quot; by Brendan Wood International, an advisory agency.

On September 26, 2011, Dimon was involved in a high-profile heated exchange with Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of Canada, in which Dimon said provisions of the Basel III international financial regulations discriminate against U.S. banks and are &quot;anti-American.&quot; On May 10, 2012, JPMorgan Chase initiated an emergency conference call to report a loss of at least $2 billion in trades that Dimon said were &quot;designed to hedge the bank&#x27;s overall credit risks.&quot; The strategy was, in Dimon&#x27;s words, &quot;flawed, complex, poorly reviewed, poorly executed and poorly monitored.&quot; The episode was investigated by the Federal Reserve, the SEC and the FBI, and the central actor was labelled with the epithet the &quot;London Whale.&quot;

In May 2023, Jamie Dimon testified under oath in connection with two lawsuits filed against JPMorgan Chase. The plaintiffs accused the bank of serving the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. This happened within five years (1998-2013) after his crimes became known; the bank itself described the claims as meritless.

Dimon serves on the executive committee of The Business Council, an organization of global CEOs. He was chairman of the organization&#x27;s executive committee during 2011 and 2012. As of 2024, Dimon is also a board member of the Business Roundtable, previously serving as chairman of the organization.

==== Fines and legal settlements ====
According to Good Jobs First&#x27;s violation tracker, during Dimon&#x27;s time heading JPMorgan Chase, the bank was fined $38 billion in total by the U.S. government, for legal and regulatory infractions. Under Dimon, JPMorgan Chase reached a then-record $13 billion settlement ($11 billion of which was tax deductible) with the US government, which was the second largest (behind Bank of America&#x27;s $16.65 billion settlement) in relation to the mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities in the years leading up to the 2007–2008 financial crisis. The bank said, &quot;Under Mr. Dimon&#x27;s stewardship, the Company has fortified its control infrastructure and processes and strengthened each of its key businesses, while continuing to focus on strengthening the Company&#x27;s leadership capabilities across all levels.&quot;

Dimon described the settlement as &quot;unfair,&quot; and said he &quot;had to control his rage&quot; regarding the topic, with most of the government claims against his company being for dealings that took place at companies before JPMorgan Chase bought them, as a result of the financial crisis. It is estimated that 70–80% of the dealmaking for the settlement was due to the outstanding legal exposures of Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, which JPMorgan Chase had acquired at the encouragement of Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, New York Fed President Timothy Geithner and other federal officials who helped broker the acquisitions, encouraged communication among the parties and even contributed financially to facilitate the transactions.

=== Compensation ===
Dimon is one of the few bank chief executives to have become a billionaire, largely because of his stake in JPMorgan Chase. He received a $23 million pay package for fiscal year 2011, more than any other bank CEO in the US. However, his compensation was reduced to $11.5 million in 2012 by JPMorgan Chase following a series of controversial trading losses that amounted to $6 billion. On January 24, 2014, it was announced that Dimon would receive $20 million for his work in 2013; a year of record profits and stock price under Dimon&#x27;s reign, despite significant losses that year due to scandals and payments of fines. The award was a 74% raise, which included over $18 million in restricted stock.

Dimon received $34.5 million from JPMorgan Chase in fiscal year 2022, and $36 million in fiscal year 2023.

=== Approach to business ===
Dimon carries everywhere a sheet of paper on which he writes lists of things to do, things to check up on, and things to remember, which he systematically crosses off. He has said he uses the OODA loop method in scenario evaluation. 

== Political activity ==

From 1989 to 2009, Dimon donated primarily to the Democratic Party. In May 2012, he described himself as &quot;barely a Democrat.&quot; After Barack Obama won the 2008 presidential election, there was speculation that Dimon would become Secretary of the Treasury. Obama eventually named Timothy Geithner to the position. Following the acquisition of Washington Mutual by JPMorgan Chase, Obama commented on Dimon&#x27;s handling of the real-estate crash, credit crisis and the banking collapse affecting corporations nationwide, including major financial institutions like Bank of America, Citibank and Wachovia, and said he did &quot;a pretty good job managing an enormous portfolio.&quot;

Dimon has had close ties to some people in the Obama White House, including former Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel. Dimon was one of three CEOs—along with Goldman Sachs Chairman Lloyd Blankfein and Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit—said by the Associated Press to have had liberal access to former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. Nonetheless, Dimon has often publicly disagreed with some of Obama&#x27;s policies. During the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, JPMorgan Chase, under Dimon&#x27;s leadership donated large sums of money to the Remain campaign, and Dimon personally campaigned with Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne against Brexit.

In December 2016, Dimon joined a business forum assembled by then president-elect Donald Trump to provide strategic and policy advice on economic issues. The forum dissolved after Trump&#x27;s comments on the alt-right political violence at the 2017 Unite the Right rally. During Trump&#x27;s presidency, Dimon supported his Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, but condemned the Trump administration&#x27;s immigration and trade policies. In a 2019 interview with &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, Dimon claimed that the United States had reached &quot;the most prosperous economy the world has ever seen&quot; despite acknowledging issues such as income inequality and the China–United States trade war. Dimon also criticized the U.S. federal government response to the COVID-19 pandemic under Trump in a letter to shareholders which also criticized the state of education, health care and social safety nets in the United States.

During the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Dimon criticized the lack of a &quot;strong centrist, pro-business, pro-free enterprise&quot; candidate. In 2018 Dimon &quot;thought about thinking about&quot; starting his own presidential campaign, but decided that it would be too unpopular to succeed. During the 2020 United States presidential election, Dimon wrote a memorandum calling for candidates to respect the democratic process and a peaceful transition of power, writing &quot;While strong opinions and tremendous passion characterized this U.S. election, it is the responsibility of each of us to respect the democratic process, and ultimately, the outcome.&quot; Dimon subsequently condemned the 2021 United States Capitol attack. In 2021, Trump complained that Dimon was &quot;not a patriot&quot; because of his company&#x27;s business in China.

In May–June 2023, Dimon was encouraged by American billionaire and hedge fund manager Bill Ackman to run in the 2024 United States presidential election, after the former expressed his interest in pursuing a public office sometime in the future. Dimon clarified that he has no plans to run for office at this time, and that he is happy with his current leading position in JPMorgan Chase, where he expects to stay for three and a half more years.

In November 2023, Dimon said he preferred Nikki Haley over Donald Trump as the Republican nominee in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. In August 2024, Dimon published an op-ed column in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, where he stated that the next president must &quot;restore our faith in America.&quot; In the opinion piece, he endorsed neither Trump nor Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. However, in October 2024, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Dimon was privately supporting Harris&#x27; 2024 campaign. After Donald Trump took office as president again in January 2025, Dimon said he supported Trump&#x27;s tariff policies. Dimon has previously said that the tariffs were a threat to the US economy.

== Personal life ==
In 1983, Dimon married Judith Kent, whom he met at Harvard Business School. They have three daughters: Julia, Laura, and Kara Leigh. Julia and Kara attended Duke University; Laura is a Barnard College graduate, a freelance journalist, formerly at the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, and currently a producer for ABC News.

Dimon was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2014. He received eight weeks of radiation and chemotherapy ending in September 2014. In March 2020, at the age of 63, Dimon underwent &quot;emergency heart surgery.&quot; The reason for the surgery was to repair an acute aortic dissection. According to JP Morgan, Dimon recovered well from surgery, with Gordon Smith and Daniel Pinto running the bank until his return. In April 2020, it was announced that Dimon returned to work in a remote capacity due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>João Alves Jobin Saldanha (3 July 1917 – 12 July 1990) was a Brazilian journalist and football manager. He coached the Brazil national football team during the South American Qualifying to the 1970 FIFA World Cup. Nicknamed &quot;João Sem Medo&quot; (&quot;Fearless João&quot;) by Nelson Rodrigues, Saldanha played for Botafogo. He then started a career in journalism and became one of Brazil&#x27;s most prolific sports columnists. He often criticised players, managers and teams, and was a member of then-illegal Brazilian Communist Party (&quot;Partido Comunista Brasileiro – PCB&quot;).

==Biography and career==

In 1957, Botafogo appointed him as their coach, despite his lack of managerial experience. The club won the Rio state championship that season, but Saldanha resigned from the club in 1959. In 1969, he was invited to take charge of the national team, and led them to a perfect 6-0 record. It is alleged that football federation president João Havelange appointed him in the hope that journalists would be less critical of the national team if one of their own was in charge.

Saldanha was publicly criticised by Dorival Yustrich, coach of Flamengo. Saldanha responded by confronting him while brandishing a revolver. Saldanha was said to have fallen out of favour because of his unwillingness to select players who were personal favourites of President Emílio Garrastazu Médici, in particular striker Dario (Brazil was then a military dictatorship). It is reported that Saldanha, after being told that President Médici would be pleased to see Dario in the team, answered, &quot;well, I also have some suggestions to give in the President&#x27;s ministry choices&quot;. The last straw came when the assistant manager resigned, saying that Saldanha was impossible to work with.

Afterwards, Saldanha went back to his journalistic career, even covering the 1970 and 1974 World Cups for TV Globo
and the 1986 and 1990 World Cups for TV Manchete. The day after commenting on the second round match between Italy and Argentina, Saldanha was admitted into the Sant&#x27;Eugenio Hospital, in Rome, with respiratory problems, and died eight days later.

<doc id="796604" wikidata="Q529871" url="?curid=796604" title="Lucius Artorius Castus">
<text>Lucius Artorius Castus (fl. 2nd century AD) was a Roman military commander. A member of the &quot;gens Artoria&quot; (possibly of Messapic or Etruscan origin). He has been suggested as a potential historical basis for King Arthur.

==Military career==

What little is known of Lucius Artorius Castus comes from inscriptions on fragments of a sarcophagus, and a memorial plaque, found in Podstrana, on the Dalmatian coast in Croatia. Although the inscriptions cannot be precisely dated, Castus probably served in the Roman army some time between the mid-late 2nd century AD or early to mid-3rd century AD.

===First inscription===
The memorial inscription, which was broken into two pieces at some point prior to the 19th century and set into the wall of the Church of St Martin in Podstrana, Croatia, reads (note that &quot;7&quot; is a rendering of the symbol used by scribes to represent the word centurio; ligatured letters are indicated with underlines):

 D...M

 MIARVM ADVERSVS ARM[...]S PROC CENTE
 NARIO PROVINCIAE LI[...] GLADI VI
 VVS IPSE SIBI ET SVIS [...]T[...]

Manfred Clauss of the Epigraphik-Datenbank Clauss-Slaby (EDCS), following the readings and expansions provided in CIL 03, 01919; CIL 03, 08513; CIL 03, 12813; Dessau 2770; IDRE-02, 303; BritRom-07, 00001; JIES-2019-432 expands the text as:

:D(is) M(anibus) / L(ucius) Artori[us Ca]stus |(centurio) leg(ionis) / III Gallicae item [|(centurio) le]g(ionis) VI Ferra/tae item |(centurio) leg(ionis) II Adi[utr(icis) i]tem |(centurio) leg(ionis) V M(a)/c(edonicae) item p(rimus) p(ilus) eiusdem [leg(ionis?)] praeposito(!) / classis Misenatium [pr]aef{f}(ectus) leg(ionis) VI / Victricis duci(!) legg[ionu]m Britan(n)ici/{mi}a(no)rum adversus Arm[3]s proc(uratori) cente/nario(!) provinciae Li[b(urniae?) iure] gladi(i) vi/vus ipse sibi et suis [posu]it

Hans-Georg Pflaum offered a slightly different expansion:

:D(is) M(anibus) L(ucius) Artori[us Ca]stus (centurio) leg(ionis) III Gallicae item [(centurio) le]g(ionis) VI Ferratae item (centurio) leg(ionis) II Adi[utricis i]tem (centurio) V M(acedonicae) C(onstantis) item p(rimi) p(ilus) eiusdem [legionis], praeposito classis Misenatium, [item pr]aeff(ecto) leg(ionis) VI Victricis, duci legg(ionum) [duaru]m Britanicimiarum adversus Arm[oricano]s, proc[uratori) centenario provinciae Lib[urn(iae) iure] gladi vivus ipse et suis [….ex te]st(amento)

Anthony Birley translates this as:
:&quot;To the divine shades, Lucius Artorius Castus, centurion of the Third Legion Gallica, also centurion of the Sixth Legion Ferrata, also centurion of the Second Legion Adiutrix, also centurion of the Fifth Legion Macedonica, also chief centurion of the same legion, in charge of (Praepositus) the Misenum fleet, prefect* of the Sixth Legion Victrix, commander of two** British legions against the Armenians, centenary procurator of Liburnia with the power of the sword. He himself (set this up) for himself and his family in his lifetime.***&quot;

*Note that the double -ff- in PRAEFF should be indicative of the plural (often dual), though it might be a scribal error here.

**Birley follows Pflaum&#x27;s expansion of the text where [duaru]m &quot;of two&quot; is reinstated before Britanicimiarum. Previous editors have preferred to restore the word as &quot;alarum&quot; &quot;to/for the alae&quot;, which may make better sense if &quot;duci legg&quot; is to be understood as the title dux legionum.

***Birley does not translate the final phrase, [...ex te]st(amento), which (if correct) should be rendered &quot;...according to the terms of (his) will&quot;

As of 2009, the two stone fragments bearing this inscription have been removed from the wall of the Church of St. Martin for scientific analysis and restoration; they have since been replaced by a copy. As of 2012 the large inscription had been cleaned and returned to display in the Chapel of St. Martin in Podstrana, Croatia. The smaller inscription is still in storage in the museum. The piece bearing the name Castus can still be located. The other two pieces sent for cleaning have been lost. The whereabouts of the fourth piece remains unknown.

===Second inscription===
The memorial plaque, which was discovered not far away from the first inscription and was also broken at some point prior to the 19th century, reads:

 L ARTORIVS
 CASTVS P P
 LEG V MA[.] PR
 AEFEC[.]VS LEG
 VI VICTRIC

Which Clauss (following CIL 03, 12791 (p 2258, 2328,120); CIL 03, 14224; IDRE-02, 304), expands: &lt;br&gt;L(ucius) Artorius | Castus p(rimus) p(ilus) | leg(ionis) V Ma[c(edonicae)] pr|aefec[t]us leg(ionis) | VI Victric(is)|[...]

Translated: &lt;br&gt;Lucius Artorius Castus, Primus Pilus of the legion V Macedonica, Prefect of the Legion VI Victrix [...]

===Possible third inscription===
An undated, unprovenanced inscription on a stamp, supposedly discovered in Rome but recorded as being in Paris in the 19th century reads:

 • LVCI •&lt;br&gt;
 • ARTORI &lt;br&gt;
 • CASTI • 
As inscription shows the text is in the genitive form. In fact, the rendered expansion will be Lucii Artorii Casti which means: (It belongs to) Lucius Artorius Castus.

===Units and ranks===
====Centurion of Legio III Gallica====
The first unit mentioned on Castus&#x27;s inscription is the Legio III Gallica – for most of the 2nd and 3rd centuries the unit was stationed in Syria. He held the rank of centurion in this legion – most Roman soldiers only achieved the rank of centurion after about 15–20 years of service, but it was not unknown for some politically connected civilians of the equestrian class to be directly commissioned as centurions upon entering the Army, though these equestrian centurions (known as &quot;ex equite Romano&quot;) were in the minority. We cannot tell whether or not Castus had a lengthy career as a legionary soldier before attaining the centurionate, or whether he was directly commissioned at this rank, as the vast majority of career centurions&#x27; inscriptions do not mention any ranks that they might have held below the centurionate. Successful officers often omitted the record of any ranks lower than primus pilus, as Castus did on his memorial plaque.

====Centurion of Legio VI Ferrata====
From the middle of the 2nd century until at least the early 3rd century the legio VI Ferrata was stationed in Judea.

====Centurion of Legio II Adiutrix====
From the early 2nd century onward the legio II Adiutrix were based at Aquincum (modern Budapest) and took part in several notable campaigns against the Parthians, Marcomanni, Quadi and, in the mid-3rd century, the Sassanid empire.

====Centurion and Primus Pilus of Legio V Macedonica====
The legio V Macedonica was based in Roman Dacia throughout the 2nd century and through most of the 3rd – the unit took part in battles against the Marcomanni, Sarmatians and Quadi.
The legio V Macedonica after 185 CE was called &quot;Pia Fidelis&quot; or &quot;Pia Constans&quot; (shortened as P.F. or P.C.), so Castus served in this unit as centurion and primus pilus before 185 CE (in the inscription these nicknames are missing).

====Praepositus of the Misenum fleet====
Castus next acted as Provost (Praepositus) of the Misenum fleet in Italy. This title (generally given to &quot;Equites&quot;) indicated a special command over a body of troops, but somewhat limited in action and subject to the Emperor&#x27;s control.

====Praefectus of Legio VI Victrix====
The Legio VI Victrix was based in Britain from c. 122 AD onward, though their history during the 3rd century AD is rather hazy. Throughout the 2nd century AD and into the 3rd, the headquarters of the VI Victrix was at &quot;Eboracum&quot; (modern York). The unit was removed briefly to &quot;Lugdunum&quot; (Lyons) in 196 AD by Clodius Albinus, during his doomed revolt against the emperor Severus, but returned to York after the revolt was quelled – and the unit suffered a significant defeat – in 197 AD.

Castus&#x27;s position in the Legio VI Victrix, Prefect of the Legion (&quot;Praefectus Legionis&quot;), was equivalent to that of the Praefectus Castrorum. Men who had achieved this title were normally 50–60 years old and had been in the army most of their lives, working their way up through the lower ranks and the centurionate until they reached Primus Pilus (the rank seems to have been held exclusively by primipilares ). They acted as third-in-command to the legionary commander, the legatus legionis, and senior tribune and could assume command in their absence. Their day-to-day duties included maintenance of the fortress and management of the food supplies, sanitation, munitions, equipment, etc. For most who had attained this rank, it would be their last before retirement. During battles, the Praefectus Castrorum normally remained at the unit&#x27;s home base with the reserve troops, so, given his administrative position and (probably) advanced age, it is unlikely that Castus actually fought in any battles while serving in Britain.

Castus could have overseen vexillations of troops guarding Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, but his inscriptions do not provide us with any precise information on where he might have served while in Britain. Given his duties as &quot;Praefectus Legionis&quot;, it is reasonable to assume that he spent some – if not all – of his time in Britain at the VI Victrix&#x27;s headquarters in York.

It is interesting that the title is spelled (P)RAEFF on Castus&#x27;s sarcophagus – doubled letters at the end of abbreviated words on Latin inscriptions usually indicated the plural (often dual) and some legions are known to have had multiple praefecti castrorum. The title is given in the singular on the memorial plaque, though, so we might have a scribal error on the sarcophagus. If not, then Castus was probably one of two prefects of this legion.

====Dux Legionum Trium &quot;Britanicimiarum&quot;====
Before finishing his military career, Castus led an expedition of some note as a Dux Legionum, a temporary title accorded to officers who were acting in a capacity above their rank, either in command of a collection of troops (generally combined vexillations drawn from legions) in transit from one station to another or in command of a complete unit (the former seems to be the case with Castus, since the units are spoken of in the genitive plural).

=====Adversus *Arm[oric(an)o]s or Adversus *Arme[nio]s?=====
For many years it has been believed that Castus&#x27;s expedition was against the Armoricans (based on the reading ADVERSUS ARM[...]S, reconstructed as &quot;adversus *Armoricanos&quot; – &quot;against the Armoricans&quot; – by Theodor Mommsen in the CIL and followed by most subsequent editors of the inscription), but the earliest published reading of the inscription, made by the Croatian archaeologist Francesco Carrara in 1850, was ADVERSUS ARME[...], with a ligatured ME (no longer visible on the stone, possibly due to weathering, since the stone has been exposed to the elements for centuries and was reused as part of a roadside wall next to the church of St. Martin in Podstrana; the mutilated word falls along the broken right-hand edge of the first fragment of the inscription). If Carrara&#x27;s reading is correct, the phrase is most likely to be reconstructed as &quot;adversus *Armenios&quot;, i.e. &quot;against the Armenians&quot;, since no other national or tribal name beginning with the letters *Arme- is known from this time period.

The regional names Armoricani or Armorici are not attested in any other Latin inscriptions, whereas the country Armenia and derivatives such as the ethnic name Armenii and personal name Armeniacus are attested in numerous Latin inscriptions. Furthermore, no classical sources mention any military action taken against the Armorici/Armoricani (which was in origin a regional name that encompassed a number of different tribes) in the 2nd or 3rd centuries. While there are literary references to (and a small amount of archaeological evidence for) minor unrest in northwestern Gaul during this time period – often referred to as, or associated with, the rebellion of the Bagaudae, there is no evidence that the Bagaudae were connected with the Armorici/Armoricani, or any other particular tribe or region for that matter, making the possible reference to the Armorici/Armoricani somewhat strange (especially since Armorica otherwise experienced a period of prosperity in the late 2nd century AD, when some scholars believe that Castus&#x27;s expedition took place). Armenia, on the other hand, was the location of several conflicts involving the Romans during the 2nd and 3rd centuries.

The alternate, &quot;Armenian&quot; translation was supported in 1881 by the epigrapher and classical scholar Emil Hübner, and most recently taken up again by the historian and epigrapher Xavier Loriot, who (based on the contextual and epigraphic evidence) suggests a floruit for Castus in the early mid-3rd century AD (Loriot&#x27;s analysis of the inscription has recently been adopted by the Roman historians Anthony Birley and Marie-Henriette Quet).

With external wars against a foreign enemy the tribe or people are named. Another example from the Severan period reads: duci exercitus Illyrica expeditione Asiana item Parthica item Gallica, ’Leader of the Illyrican army on the Asian, Parthian and Gallic expeditions.’

There are also a number of literary and epigraphical pieces of evidence demonstrating Roman military campaigns in Armenia against Armenians.
In the Parthian War of AD 161-6 under Lucius Verus the general Priscus led the advance through Armenia and captured the Armenian capital at Artaxata. Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus subsequently awarded themselves the titles of Armeniacus, Parthicus, Medicus and pater patriae. Around ad 214–216 the Armenia King Khosrov I was imprisoned by the Romans. The Armenians rebelled and Caracalla sent Theocritus who led an army to defeat. However, after a subsequent successful campaign, Caracalla did eventually grant the Armenian crown to Tiridates II c. AD 217 and Armenia returned under Roman influence.
In the reign of Macrinus, AD 217-8, the Historia Augusta states there was a ‘dux Armeniae erat et item legatus Asiae atque Arabiae’. In c. AD 233 Severus Alexander launched a three prong attack against the Persians with the northern army invading through Armenia. Alexander drew troops from the Rhine and Danube on his march east, and we have various inscriptions dated to ad 232–5 honouring men who died in ‘expediteone Partica et Armeniaca’.

=====Britanicimiarum=====
The name of the units that Castus led in this expedition, &quot;Britanicimiarum&quot;, seems to be corrupt – it might be reconstructed as &quot;*Britanniciniarum&quot; or &quot;*Britannicianarum&quot;. If so, they were probably units similar in nature to the &quot;ala&quot; and &quot;cohors I Britannica&quot; (also known as the &quot;I Flavia Britannica&quot; or&quot; Britanniciana&quot;, among other titles), which were stationed in Britain in the mid-1st century AD, but removed to Vindobona in Pannonia by the late 80s AD (they would later take part in Trajan&#x27;s Parthian War of 114–117 AD and Trebonianus Gallus&#x27; Persian war of 252 AD). Though the name of the unit was derived from its early service in Britain, the unit was not generally composed of ethnic Britons. No units of this name are believed to have been active in Britain during the late 2nd century.
In an inscription from Sirmium in Pannonia dating to the reign of the emperor Gallienus (CIL 3, 3228), we have mention of vexillations of legions &quot;*Brittan(n)icin(arum)&quot; (&quot;militum vexill(ationum) legg(ionum) ]G]ermaniciana[r(um)] [e]t Brittan(n)icin(arum)&quot;) – another form that is very similar to the &quot;*Britan(n)icimiarum&quot; from Castus&#x27;s inscription.

====Procurator Centenarius of Liburnia====
Exceptionally talented, experienced and/or connected Praefects Castrorum/Legionis could sometimes move on to higher civilian positions such as Procurator, which Castus indeed managed to accomplish after retiring from the army. He became &quot;procurator centenarius&quot; (governor) of Liburnia, a part of Roman Dalmatia, today&#x27;s Croatia. (&quot;centenarius&quot; indicates that he received a salary of 100,000 sesterces per year).
Castus was appointed procurator centenarius of the province of Liburnia with ius gladii, the power to put anyone, even Senators, to death. Nothing further is known of him. Other Artorii are attested in the area, but it is unknown if Lucius Artorius Castus started this branch of the family in Dalmatia, or whether the family had already been settled there prior to his birth (if the latter, Castus might have received the Liburnian procuratorship because he was a native of the region).

==Lucius Artorius Castus&#x27;s &quot;floruit&quot;==
No dates are given in either inscription, making it difficult to offer a precise date for them, no less Lucius Artorius Castus&#x27;s &quot;floruit&quot;. The late French epigraphy expert Xavier Loriot suggested that Lucius Artorius Castus&#x27;s expedition against the Armenians (as he reads the main inscription) could have taken place in 215 AD, under the reign of emperor Caracalla, or perhaps later, in 232 AD, under the reign of Severus Alexander (when P. Aelius Hammonius led a Cappadocian force in Severus&#x27;s Persian war). Three Croatian archaeologists examined the inscriptions in 2012, as part of an international conference on Lucius Artorius Castus organized by authors Linda Malcor and John Matthews: Nenad Cambi, Željko Miletić, and Miroslav Glavičić. Cambi proposes that Lucius Artorius Castus&#x27; career can be dated to the late 2nd century AD and his death to the late 2nd, or perhaps early 3rd century AD. Glavičić dates Lucius Artorius Castus&#x27;s military career to the middle- through late-2nd century AD and proposes that he was the first governor of the province of Liburnia, which Glavičić suggests was only established as a separate province from Dalmatia circa 184–185 AD. Miletić dates Lucius Artorius Castus&#x27;s military career to circa 121–166 AD and his procuratorship of the province of Liburnia to circa 167–174 AD. Cambi, Miletić, and Glavičić all accept the reading &quot;(adversus) Armenios&quot;, &quot;against the Armenians&quot; (with Cambi offering &quot;Armorios&quot; [an abbreviation of &quot;Armoric[an]os&quot;] as an alternate possibility); Miletić places the expedition against the Armenians during emperor Lucius Verus&#x27;s Parthian war of 161–166 AD.

==Identification with King Arthur==
In 1924, Kemp Malone was the first to suggest the possibility that Lucius Artorius Castus was the inspiration for the figure of Arthur in medieval European literature. More recent champions have included authors C. Scott Littleton and Linda Malcor. The hypothesis has been heavily criticized by prominent Arthurian scholars due to the historical Artorius Castus having very little in common with the Arthurian legends and the arguments relying excessively on speculation and wishful thinking.

Due to the significant differences between the persons and careers of the historical Lucius Artorius Castus and the traditional King Arthur, the consensus of mainstream historians is that it is very unlikely the former inspired the latter. For example, Lucius Artorius Castus was not contemporaneous with the Saxon invasions of Britain in the 5th century CE which gave rise to the Arthurian legends, and some of the earliest written references to Arthur are of him fighting against the Saxons. The strongest link between them may be the extended family or clan name &quot;Artorius&quot; which may have developed into the personal name &quot;Arthur&quot;, but this does not necessarily mean Lucius Artorius Castus himself inspired the legends. The possibility, however unlikely or remote, is nonetheless real that he was remembered in local tales that grew in the retelling. No definitive proof, however, has yet been established that Lucius Artorius Castus was the &quot;real&quot; King Arthur.

===Legacy===
In the film &quot;King Arthur&quot;, Lucius Artorius Castus is partially identified with King Arthur. The film asserts that Arthur&#x27;s Roman name was &quot;Artorius Castus&quot;, and that Artorius was an ancestral name derived from that of a famous leader. His &quot;floruit&quot; (&quot;prime time&quot;) is, however, pushed a few centuries later so that he is made a contemporary of the invading Saxons in the 5th century CE. This would be in agreement with native Welsh tradition regarding Arthur, although his activities are placed many decades or sometimes centuries earlier than the medieval sources assign to him. As a research consultant for the film &quot;King Arthur&quot; (2004), Linda Malcor&#x27;s hypotheses regarding Lucius Artorius Castus were the primary inspiration for the screenplay.

Lucius Artorius Castus plays an important role with the character Askeladd in the Japanese manga &quot;Vinland Saga&quot;. In the prologue of the series, the main antagonist Askeladd is noted to be a descendant of Artorius Castus through his Welsh mother. Lucius Artorius Castus is described as being the person that the legend of King Arthur was based on.

<text>Col. Bruce Hampton and the Aquarium Rescue Unit was a jam band founded by Col. Bruce Hampton. The band gained popularity in the Atlanta club scene in the early 1990s and went on to tour with the first H.O.R.D.E. Tour. During their formative years, the band was composed of Bruce Hampton, Oteil Burbridge, Jimmy Herring, Jeff Sipe, Matt Mundy, and Count M&#x27;Butu. Jeff Mosier and Charlie Williams were members of the band during the early years, but left to pursue other endeavors. Although the band was never commercially successful, their combination of bluegrass, rock, Latin, blues, jazz, funk, and impeccable chops became a template for future bands.

==History==
The band originated from a weekly Atlanta jam session hosted by Hampton (from the Hampton Grease Band and The Late Bronze Age) and eventually toured around the Southeastern United States with Hampton, Herring, Burbridge, Sipe, Mundy, and M&#x27;Butu. This lineup produced two albums released on Capricorn Records; &quot;Col. Bruce Hampton and the Aquarium Rescue Unit&quot;, in 1992, and &quot;Mirrors of Embarrassment&quot;, in 1993.

During the summer of 1992, the group helped start the H.O.R.D.E. tour with such like-minded bands as Phish, Spin Doctors, Blues Traveler, Bela Fleck &amp; the Flecktones, and Widespread Panic. Members of these bands would frequently tour, perform, and record with one another. Béla Fleck and John Popper contributed on &quot;Mirrors of Embarrassment&quot; and Popper also contributed to &quot;The Benefit Concert Vol. 2&quot;. Chuck Leavell played on ARU&#x27;s first two albums on Capricorn Records. Also, in 1992 Billy Bob Thornton directed the movie &quot;Widespread Panic: Live from the Georgia Theatre&quot; which features a music video for &quot;Basically Frightened&quot; performed by Col. Bruce Hampton &amp; The Aquarium Rescue Unit with Chuck Leavell and Count M&#x27;Butu.

===Break-up===
In 1993 the band lost two key members when Matt Mundy retired from the band and Hampton soon followed. Oteil, Herring and Sipe continued to tour as &quot;The Aquarium Rescue Unit.&quot; The band had a rotating outer cast of members over the years, including lead vocalist Paul Henson; Oteil&#x27;s brother, Kofi Burbridge on keyboards, flute, back-up vocals; and drummer Sean O&#x27;Rourke. They recorded additional studio albums as Aquarium Rescue Unit: 1994&#x27;s &quot;eeePee&quot; and &quot;In A Perfect World&quot;, and 2003&#x27;s &quot;The Calling&quot;.

The remaining original members started to leave as they received offers from other larger acts. Jeff Sipe joined with Jonas Hellborg and the late Shawn Lane in 1995, and over the years has played with Leftover Salmon, Susan Tedeschi, Phil Lesh, and Trey Anastasio. Currently Jeff Sipe is playing drums for Keller Williams&#x27;s new band the WMDs. In 1997, Oteil Burbridge replaced Allen Woody in The Allman Brothers Band. Burbridge also played in Phish keyboardist Page McConnell&#x27;s side project Vida Blue, on Trey Anastasio&#x27;s Surrender to the Air, and in his own occasional project, Oteil And The Peacemakers. He continued to play with the Allman Brothers Band until the band officially broke up on 10/28/2014. During the last few years of his time with the Allman Brothers, Oteil was also a full-time member the Tedeschi Trucks Band. He was asked to fill the bass slot in the post-Fare Thee Well incarnation of The Grateful Dead when Phil Lesh decided he no longer wanted to tour. This project is called Dead &amp; Company. Jimmy Herring co-founded Jazz Is Dead in 1998, then toured and recorded with supergroup Frogwings, The Allman Brothers Band, Project Z, Phil Lesh and Friends, and The Dead. In 2006 Herring was asked to join Widespread Panic with whom he has recorded and toured extensively.

===Reunion===

In 2004 Hampton, Herring, Sipe, Burbridge and M&#x27;Butu reunited for several shows as the original Col. Bruce Hampton and Aquarium Rescue Unit. They continued with eight shows in Colorado and the Southeast between January 2006 and May 2007. Bobby Lee Rodgers of The Codetalkers was asked to sit in on banjo and vocals, taking the place of Matt Mundy who has retired from performing.

By 2007 each member of the original lineup was an accomplished artist in their own right: Herring with Widespread Panic, Burbridge with two bands: The Allman Brothers Band and Oteil and The Peacemakers, Sipe with Trey Anastasio and Leftover Salmon, M&#x27;Butu with The Derek Trucks Band, and Hampton with Col. Bruce &amp; The Quark Alliance.

Aquarium Rescue Unit reunited for the reopening of the Georgia Theatre in Athens, Georgia, on August 8, 2011. The lineup included Col. Bruce Hampton, Jimmy Herring, Oteil Burbridge, Jeff Sipe and Matt Slocum on keyboards.

On March 24, 2015, via Facebook, Col. Bruce Hampton announced the band was getting back together for shows scheduled for summer 2015. The band returned to the lineup of Hampton, Oteil Burbridge, Jimmy Herring, Matt Slocum and Jeff Sipe.

<text>Pauline Julien, (May 23, 1928October 1, 1998), nicknamed &quot;La Renarde&quot;, was a singer, songwriter, actress, feminist activist and Quebec sovereigntist.

Born in Trois-Rivières, Quebec, Julien was the companion of the poet and Québec provincial MLA Gérald Godin, another Trifluvian and sovereignist. Julien performed pro-independence songs in Montréal clubs as early as 1964. In 1965 she hosted the CBC television series &quot;Mon pays, mes chansons&quot;. At the CBC she also collaborated and recorded with pianist Herbert Ruff, and performed on the program &quot;On Stage&quot;.

In 1970, Julien and Godin were arrested during the October Crisis and were released eight days later without charge.

In 1994, France decorated her with the title Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres. Julien was made a Chevalière de l&#x27;Ordre national du Québec.

Diagnosed with a debilitating brain disease, Julien committed suicide in early October 1998 in Montreal.

She was the subject of the 2018 documentary film &quot;Pauline Julien, Intimate and Political (Pauline Julien, intime et politique)&quot;.

<text>Shelvock Manor is a house and grounds in a township of the same name near Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England. It was once a place of local importance, and was for more than two centuries the seat of the Thornes, a leading family in Shropshire. The first recorded spelling of Shelvock was Shelfhoc (1175), and later Sselvak and Schelfac (around the year 1270). The name is most likely derived from the Saxon &quot;&quot;ac&quot; meaning oak, prefixed by its location on a shelf or hill.

==History of the ownership and owners of the manor==

===Early history===

====1000–1200====
In the Domesday period (around the year 1086), Shelvock was one of the three Berewicks (a hamlet attached to a manor) of the Manor of Wykey. This manor was owned in Edward the Confessor&#x27;s time by Edwin, Earl of Mercia. In William the Conqueror&#x27;s time it was owned by one Odo, who owned also Hordley and Ruyton, but held them all under Roger de Montgomery, Earl of Shrewsbury.

The earl&#x27;s son Robert rebelled and forfeited his property in 1102, and Wykey, as with many other of his manors, was given to Alan Fitz Flaald, hereditary Sheriff of Shropshire and ancestor of the Stewart Kings of Scotland. Flaald&#x27;s son, William Fitz Alan, gave Ruyton and Wykey to John Le Strange about 1155, to hold under him. Le Strange gave Shelvock and all its s to one William Fitz Walter and his heirs to hold of himself and his heirs.

Sometime between the Domesday Book and 1175, Shelvock became the head of the Manor which was originally the Domesday Manor of Wykey.

====1200–1500====
One record from the year 1270 states that Philip, Lord of Shelvock, was also lord of Shotatton. Shotatton, Shelvock, and Eardiston were most likely the three Berewicks of the Domesday Manor of Wykey. Philip must have derived his title to the property from William Fitz Walter to account for the Lord of Shelvock having the right to hold a Court and to (punish by fine) the township of Shotatton.

About 1301 the Le Strange family sold Ruyton, with all its homages and fees, to their suzerain Edmund Fitz Alan, Earl of Arundel, which would include all their rights over Wykey and Shelvock; however about 1325 John, Lord of Shelvock gives to the Abbot of Haghmond a quit claim as to certain lands at Balderton. Apparently, Shelvock had not passed with Ruyton into the immediate possession of the Earl of Arundel, but was still held by an under-tenant, presumably a descendant of the William Fitz Walter to whom it had been granted in 1175.

The under-lords of Shelvock were still in possession in 1397, when the grandson of Edmund Fitz Alan forfeited his lands. Around the year 1354, during the reign of Edward III, William le Yonge was Steward of the Manor of Ruyton, and on 20 November that year, Richard, Earl of Arundel, granted to him and Alice his wife settlement of lands &quot;in the vills of Shelvak, Atton &amp; Erdeston&quot;.

In 1357, Geoffrey, son of John Loyt of Kynardeston, took relief of half the village of Shelvock, and paid 2 shillings and 8 d (£0.13). In the same year the townsmen of Shelvock asserted an immemorial right of pasturing their cattle on the Wigmarsh Common.

John le Yonge succeeded his father William, and was living at the time of the execution of the Earl of Arundel in 1397, when he was returned as holding &quot;Shelfake &amp; Wyke by service of a quarter of a Knight&#x27;s fee of the Honour of the Earl of Arundel&quot;. The manors appear to be separated shortly afterwards. A Thomas le Younge, who was Steward of Ruyton Manor in 1426, may have been the son of John and owner of Shelvock. John&#x27;s daughter and eventual heiress, Cecilia, married Robert Thornes, son of Roger de la Thornes who resided on his estate at Thornes, in the parish of Shenstone, Staffordshire.

In 1381 the Earl of Arundel interfered to appease some dissensions among the burgesses of Shrewsbury which had become very acute, and induced them to commit the government of the town to a committee of 12 persons, one of whom was Robert of Thornes, son of Robert Thornes. Either this Robert or his son Thomas succeeded John or Thomas Yonge as owner of Shelvock, in right of the marriage with Cecilia Yonge. Thomas had two sons. The eldest, Robert, succeeded to Shelvock and the other property in Ruyton, while the younger, Roger, succeeded to Thornes. Robert&#x27;s son, Robert, succeeded his father and married Ellen, widow of Roger Seresby, but in 1473, he released all his interests (including Shelvock) to his first cousin, Thomas Thornes, son of Roger. Thomas Thornes, grandson of the Alderman, is described &quot;as of Shelvock&quot; in 1476 when he married Mary, daughter of Sir Roger Corbet of Morton Corbet.

===Later history===

====1500–1700====
Roger Thornes, son of Thomas, was called the &quot;Wise Thornes of Shrewsbury, for that both town and country repaired to him for advice&quot;&quot;. Though owner of Shelvock, he retained his family connection with Shrewsbury, and seems to have lived principally in the town, where he had a house in Raven Street, just opposite School Lane. He was six times Bailiff. He married Anne, the daughter of Sir Roger Kynaston, with whom he had 7 children. Roger died in 1531, and was buried in St. Mary&#x27;s Church. Shrewsbury. After him was a rapid succession to the property of Shelvock.

John Thornes, his son, married Elizabeth Astley of Patshull Hall. Jeffrey Thornes, son of John, married Jane Kynaston of Shardon, by whom he had several children, including his daughter Jane, baptised at Myddle on 13 February 1545. He later married Anne Fowler of Staffordshire. His Will was proved at Lichfield in 1552, and he was succeeded by his second wife&#x27;s son, Nicholas Thornes, who married Margaret, daughter of Walter Wrottesley of Staffordshire. He was in turn succeeded in 1592 by his son Richard Thornes, who in 1599 bought a third part of the Manor of Ruyton from George Younge, possibly the heir of Thomas Younge, Archbishop of York, who had bought the manor in 1567 from the Earl of Arundel and others. Richard Thornes was Sheriff of Shropshire in 1610, but for the first half of the year only, being succeeded during the latter half of the year as sheriff by Richard Mytton of Halston, whose sister Elizabeth Mytton he had married. The initials R.T./E.T. 1606 were to be found on a stable with enormously thick walls still standing at Shelvock.

Francis Thornes, son of the Sheriff, married Beatrice, eldest daughter of Sir Andrew Corbet of Moreton Corbet Castle, on 12 December 1625, at Moreton Corbet, when he was 19 and she was 15. When the English Civil War broke, Thornes actively sided with the King.

Francis Thornes was one of many county gentlemen captured when Shrewsbury was taken on 22 February 1644 or 1645, by the Parliamentary forces under the command of his first cousin, Thomas Mytton of Halston, and he had to pay £720 for his estate. When his wife&#x27;s brother, Sir Vincent Corbet, 1st Baronet, died in 1656, he became one of the trustees of the Corbet estates. In 1659 the Corbet family went to the Court of Chancery for redress, alleging that he was running the estates for his own profit and preventing Sir Vincent&#x27;s heir visiting his mother. He used his position to marry his daughter, Elizabeth to the 2nd Baronet. After the Restoration Francis Thornes was one of the Commissioners appointed under the Corporation Act 1661 for administering oaths of allegiance and supremacy to all office holders in Shrewsbury, and for removing from office all disaffected persons.

Thomas Thornes, son of Francis, was the last Thornes owner of Shelvock. He was baptised at Moreton Corbet on 26 September 1630, and in 1653 he married Elinor, his first wife, daughter of Jonathan Langley of the Abbey, Shrewsbury. He later married Hester Littleton, daughter of Sir William Courteen, of London, and widow of Sir Sir Edward Littleton, 1st Baronet of Pillaton Hall, Staffordshire, a zealous royalist, and then Anne, who married after his death George Bold. Thomas Thornes sold Webscott, in Myddle parish, to his brother-in-law Thomas Price. He died without issue, surviving his father by less than two months. While the Thornes&#x27; ownership of the manor ceased in the middle of the 17th Century, the family remained connected to the lands well into the 18th.

====1700–1900====
On the death of Thomas Thornes his widow retained possession of Shelvock, and married George Bold, but their right to the property was evidently disputed by the family, for in 1699 a deed of family settlement was executed, dated October 30, between them and several other relatives. By this deed it was agreed that all differences and lawsuits about the land and estate of the late Francis and Thomas Thornes were to cease. The Bolds were to hold for their lives and to keep in repair the capital messuage of Shelvock, the Heath Mill, and the demesne lands belonging to Shelvock, and several properties in Shotatton which were parcel of the demesne lands of Shelvock. After the deaths of the Bolds, the whole of the above were to belong in fee simple, free from encumbrances, to Francis Thornes&#x27; four daughters and their representatives. Anne Bold, therefore, and her second husband, George Bold, had possession of Shelvock from 1678; and they were still alive in 1707, but had to let it to some under-tenants.

Lady Corbet (one of the recipients of the estate after Ann Bold&#x27;s death) settled her fourth part of Shelvock estate on her grandson Corbet Kynaston and in 1702 her sisters Beatrice Thornes and Francis Ironsides transferred their shares (subject to their life interests) to her. In 1707, the remaining fourth was bought from John Price by Corbet Kynaston&#x27;s trustees for £400. Another deed of family arrangement was executed on 7 August 1707, conveying the manor and manor house of Shelvock and its demesnes to Corbet Kynaston, and other pieces of land nearby to the Bolds and others in fee. Corbet Kynaston became sole owner of Shelvock on the death of the Bolds some time between 1707 and 1738, when he executed a deed barring his estate tail in a part of the property. He died unmarried on 17 June 1740. He left all his real estates, including Sundorne (inherited from his father) and Shelvock, to Andrew Corbet, whose grandmother was his great-aunt; but Andrew Corbet died on 15 April 1741 without issue, and was succeeded by his brother John Corbet.

Corbet Kynaston left debts amounting to between £70,000 and £80,000; suits were instituted by his creditors, and an Act of Parliament had to be obtained for selling his estates. An arrangement was entered into, by a deed dated 20 December 1748. Anna Maria Leighton and her husband Sir Charlton Leighton were to have the manor, house, and lands of Shelvock, and the furniture there, along with several freehold tenements. In 1757, Sir Charlton let Shelvock for his own life to Richard Madocks, yeoman, and as Madocks is described in the deed as of Shelvock, he was apparently already tenant of it before this time. In 1766, Sir Charlton gave up the property of Shelvock Manor and its grounds, as well as another farm, to his son Charlton Leighton.

The deed of 20 December 1748 mentions lands within the Manor of Shelvock belonging to Edward Thornes. Edward Thornes of Ruyton married Elizabeth Bill of Felton, at Felton on 23 June 1711. In 1779 the land Edward owned had passed from him to Thomas Reynolds.

In 1774, the manor and estate of Shelvock was sold to William Mostyn Owen of Woodhouse, Esq. He died in 1795 and was succeeded by his son William Mostyn Owen, who about 1832 conveyed Shelvock to Thomas Bulkeley-Owen, of Tedsmore in exchange for lands at Haughton. About 1858, Owen pulled down the old house and erected the farm house, which is a little to the east of the site of the old house. Some of the cellars of the old house still remain into the 21st Century. When the house was pulled down, a quantity of oak panelling was removed to Tedsmore, including an old English mantelpiece which was placed in the entrance hall there. Bulkeley Hatchett Bulkeley-Owen, who died on 10 August 1868, leaving a widow but no children, was succeeded by his brother, the Rev. T. M. Bulkeley-Owen.

Mr. Thomas Lloyd was the occupier of Shelvock farm which included the house and almost the whole township in 1894, and Mr. Thomas Bowdler occupied the cottage, which is the only other house in the Township of Shelvock. It is situated on the brook which separates the Townships of Shelvock and Eardiston, and is probably the Gate House mentioned in the Deed of 1766.

In the 1890s, Shelvock was part of the Tedsmore Hall property. The date 1606 was still on one of the stables in 1894, situated, with park-like grounds round it, and a picturesque pool below. In 1894 the Township of Shelvock included the house and only one cottage. The area was 259 acres 3 roods 4 perches (1.1 km2).

====1900–Present====
In the late 20th Century, the farm was owned by the family of Mr. D. R. Corbett. There has no doubt been various owners and occupiers (tenant farmers) throughout the 19th and 20th Centuries.

In 2000, as part of a Millennium Year project, a member of the Rogers family recalled that &#x27;I once lived at Shelvock and my mum (Patricia Lloyd) was born there. My grandfather W. E. Lloyd once farmed at Shelvock until approx 1990. I spent a lot of my childhood on the farm&quot;&quot;. My great grandfather was Thomas Lloyd mentioned above. W.E Lloyd was well known amongst members of the Suffolk Sheep society and had the well known Shelvock flock, that won many a cup at shows around the country

<text>Fernando &quot;Nanding&quot; Hofileña Lopez Sr. (April 13, 1904May 26, 1993) was a Filipino statesman. A member of the influential López family of Iloilo, he served as vice president of the Philippines under Presidents Elpidio Quirino from 1949 to 1953 under the Liberal Party and Ferdinand Marcos from 1965 to 1972, under the Nacionalista Party. He was also the chairman of ABS-CBN Corporation from 1986 to his death in 1993.

==Early life and career==
Lopez was born on April 13, 1904, in Jaro, Iloilo City to Benito Villanueva Lopez and Presentacion Javelona Hofileña. He was the younger brother and only sibling of Eugenio Lopez Sr. The Lopez family was the richest and most influential family in the province.

Lopez studied high school at Colegio de San Juan de Letran, finishing in 1921. He studied law in the University of Santo Tomas, earning his Bachelor of Laws degree in 1925. After passing the bar examinations, he did not go into private practice, but helped his older brother manage the family business.

In 1945, with no prior political experience, Lopez was chosen by President Sergio Osmeña to be mayor of Iloilo City. In 1947, he ran for senator and won.

Lopez was one of the founders of University of Iloilo and the FEATI University in Manila.

The brothers Eugenio and Fernando owned the Iloilo-Negros Air Express Company (the first Filipino owned air service), the &quot;Iloilo Times&quot; (&quot;El Tiempo&quot;), the &quot;Manila Chronicle&quot; and ABS-CBN Corporation, LSC (Lopez Sugar Corporation), Bayantel (including Bayan DSL), SkyCable (including SkyBroadband), Meralco, RLC (Rockwell Land Corporation), Rockwell Center, First Balfour, Inc., Philippine Electric Corporation (Philec), First Electro Dynamics Corporation (Fedcor), First Sumiden Circuits, Inc. (FSCI), Securities Transfer Services, Inc. (STSI), The Medical City (TMC), BayanTrade DotCom, First Gas Holdings Corporation (Santa Rita), FGP. Corp. (San Lorenzo), FG Hydro Power Corporation (Pantabangan-Masiway), FG Bukidnon (Agusan mini-hydro), Bauang Private Power Corporation (Bauang), Panay Electric Company (PECO), First Philippine Industrial Corporation (the major fuel distributor of Shell and Chevron Caltex in the country), First Philippine Realty Corp, First Philippine Electric Corp. (First Philec), First Philec Solar Corporation, First Sumiden Circuits, Inc. (FSCI), First Sumiden Realty, Inc, First Philippine Industrial Park.

==Vice-presidency==

===First term (1949–1953)===

In 1949, Lopez became vice-president under President Elpidio Quirino and concurrently worked as secretary of agriculture, serving until 1953. He was then elected once again as senator, and re-elected in 1959.

===Second and third term (1965–1972)===

In 1965, Lopez ran with Ferdinand Marcos and won as vice-president. He was re-elected in 1969, making him, to date the only vice-president to serve two non-consecutive terms, two different presidents and from different parties. By the time martial law was declared in 1972, the Lopez family fell out of Marcos&#x27; favor and was targeted by the regime because of their denunciations of Marcos. The position of vice-president was abolished, and the Lopez family was stripped of most of its political and economic assets.

==Later life and death==
After the removal of Marcos from power as a result of the People Power Revolution of 1986, Lopez became chairman of FHL Investment Corporation and vice-chairman of First Philippine Holdings Corporation.

He died on May 26, 1993, a month after his 89th birthday leaving his wife Mariquit Javellana with whom he had six children: Yolanda, Fernando, Jr. (Junjie), Alberto (Albertito), Emmanuele, Benito and Mita. He was also the longest living vice president until he was surpassed by Teofisto Guingona Jr. in 2017.

<doc id="796619" wikidata="Q194257" url="?curid=796619" title="Elasmobranchii">
<text>Elasmobranchii () is a subclass of Chondrichthyes or cartilaginous fish, including modern sharks (superorder Selachii), rays, skates, and sawfish (superorder Batoidea). Members of this subclass are characterised by having five to seven pairs of gill slits opening individually to the exterior, rigid dorsal fins and small placoid scales on the skin. The teeth are in several series; the upper jaw is not fused to the cranium, and the lower jaw is articulated with the upper. The details of this jaw anatomy vary between species, and help distinguish the different elasmobranch clades. The pelvic fins in males are modified to create claspers for the transfer of sperm. There is no swim bladder; instead, these fish maintain buoyancy with large livers rich in oil.

The definition of the clade is unclear with respect to fossil chondrichthyans. Some authors consider it as equivalent to Neoselachii (the crown group clade including modern sharks, rays, and all other descendants of their last common ancestor). Other authors use the name Elasmobranchii for a broader branch-based group of all chondrichthyans more closely related to modern sharks and rays than to Holocephali (the clade containing chimaeras and their extinct relatives). Important extinct groups of elasmobranchs &quot;sensu lato&quot; include the hybodonts (Order Hybodontiformes), xenacanths (order Xenacanthformes) and Ctenacanthiformes. These are also often referred to as &quot;sharks&quot; in reference to their similar anatomy and ecology to modern sharks.

The name Elasmobranchii comes from the Ancient Greek words (&quot;plate&quot;) and (&quot;gill&quot;), referring to the broad, flattened gills which are characteristic of these fishes.

==Description==
Elasmobranchii is one of the two subclasses of cartilaginous fish in the class Chondrichthyes, the other being Holocephali (chimaeras).

Members of the elasmobranchii subclass have no swim bladders, five to seven pairs of gill clefts opening individually to the exterior, rigid dorsal fins, and small placoid scales. The teeth are in several series; the upper jaw is not fused to the cranium, and the lower jaw is articulated with the upper.

Extant elasmobranchs exhibit several archetypal jaw suspensions: amphistyly, orbitostyly, hyostyly, and euhyostyly. In amphistyly, the palatoquadrate has a postorbital articulation with the chondrocranium from which ligaments primarily suspend it anteriorly. The hyoid articulates with the mandibular arch posteriorly, but it appears to provide little support to the upper and lower jaws. In orbitostyly, the orbital process hinges with the orbital wall and the hyoid provides the majority of suspensory support.

In contrast, hyostyly involves an ethmoid articulation between the upper jaw and the cranium, while the hyoid most likely provides vastly more jaw support compared to the anterior ligaments. Finally, in euhyostyly, also known as true hyostyly, the mandibular cartilages lack a ligamentous connection to the cranium. Instead, the hyomandibular cartilages provide the only means of jaw support, while the ceratohyal and basihyal elements articulate with the lower jaw, but are disconnected from the rest of the hyoid. The eyes have a tapetum lucidum. The inner margin of each pelvic fin in the male fish is grooved to constitute a clasper for the transmission of sperm. These fish are widely distributed in tropical and temperate waters.

Many fish maintain buoyancy with swim bladders. However elasmobranchs lack swim bladders, and maintain buoyancy instead with large livers that are full of oil. This stored oil may also function as a nutrient when food is scarce.

==Evolutionary history==
The oldest unambigous total group elasmobranch, &quot;Phoebodus,&quot; has its earliest records in the Middle Devonian (late Givetian), around 383 million years ago. Several important groups of total group elasmobranchs, including Ctenacanthiformes and Hybodontiformes, had already emerged by the latest Devonian (Famennian). During the Carboniferous, some ctenacanths would grow to sizes rivalling the modern great white shark with bodies in the region of in length. During the Carboniferous and Permian, the xenacanths were abundant in both freshwater and marine environments, and would continue to exist into the Triassic with reduced diversity. The hybodonts had achieved a high diversity by the Permian, and would end up becoming the dominant group of elasmobranchs during the Triassic and Early Jurassic. Hybodonts were extensively present in both marine and freshwater environments. While Neoselachii/Elasmobranchi &quot;sensu stricto&quot; (the group of modern sharks and rays) had already appeared by the Triassic, they only had low diversity during this period would and only begin to extensively diversify from the Early Jurassic onwards, when modern orders of sharks and rays appeared. This co-incided with the decline of the hybodonts, which had become minor components of marine environments by the Late Jurassic, but would remain common in freshwater environments into the Cretaceous. The youngest remains of hybodonts date to the very end of the Cretaceous.

==Taxonomy==
Elasmobranchii was first coined in 1838 by Charles Lucien Bonaparte. Bonaparte&#x27;s original definition of Elasmobranchii was effectively identical to modern Chondrichthyes, and was based around gill architecture shared by all 3 living major cartilaginous fish groups. During the 20th century it became standard to exclude chimaeras from Elasmobranchii; along with including many fossil chondrichthyans within the group. The definition of Elasmobranchii has since been subject to much confusion with regard to fossil chondrichthyans. Maisey (2012) suggested that Elasmobranchii should exclusively be used for the last common ancestor of modern sharks and rays, a grouping which had previously been named Neoselachii by Compagno (1977). Other recent authors have used Elasmobranchii in a broad sense to include all chondrichthyans more closely related to modern sharks and rays than to chimaeras.

The total group of Elasmobranchii includes the Cohort Euselachii Hay, 1902, which groups the Hybodontiformes and a number of other extinct chondrichthyans with Elasmobrachii &quot;sensu stricto&quot;/Neoselachii, to the exclusion of more primitive total group elasmobranchs, which is supported by a number of shared morphological characters of the skeleton.

Recent molecular studies suggest the Batoidea are not derived selachians as previously thought. Instead, skates and rays are a monophyletic superorder within Elasmobranchii that shares a common ancestor with the selachians.

<doc id="796623" wikidata="Q338324" url="?curid=796623" title="Noli de Castro">
<text>Manuel &quot;Noli&quot; Leuterio de Castro Jr. (; born July 6, 1949) is a Filipino broadcaster, journalist and politician who served as the 12th Vice President of the Philippines from 2004 until 2010, under the second full term of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. He was elected to the Senate of the Philippines in 2001 after receiving the most votes of any senator in the 2001 election.

With a career spanning over five decades, de Castro is among the most recognizable journalists in Philippine broadcast media. De Castro is currently the anchor of the radio program &quot;Kabayan&quot; on DWPM, TeleRadyo Serbisyo and Prime TV and the TV program &quot;TV Patrol&quot; on ANC, Kapamilya Channel, A2Z and ALLTV. He is one of the key television figures in favor of the Philippine drug war undertaken by the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte. 

==Early life and education==
De Castro was born as Manuel Leuterio de Castro Jr. in the town of Pola, Oriental Mindoro at 4:00 pm on July 6, 1949. He is the fifth child of Manuel de Castro Sr. (born c. 1909) and Demetria (née Leuterio, born c. 1911). He studied at the University of the East in 1971 with a degree in Bachelor of Commerce, majoring in banking and finance, and a doctorate degree &quot;Honoris causa&quot; from the Polytechnic University of the Philippines.

== Broadcasting career ==
De Castro began his broadcasting career during the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos. He worked as a field reporter for Johnny de Leon, a popular radio announcer at the time. He later became a radio announcer in RPN&#x27;s DWWW station from 1982 to 1986.

After the ousting of Marcos in 1986, de Castro joined ABS-CBN, as the segment host for &quot;At Your Service&quot; of &quot;Good Morning! Philippines&quot;. He also joined DZMM, a radio station of ABS-CBN, as the anchorman of &quot;Kabayan&quot;, gaining the nickname &quot;&quot;Kabayan&quot; Noli&quot;.

In 1987, he became one of the anchors of the news and public affairs show, &quot;TV Patrol&quot;. The following year, de Castro became an anchor on &quot;Magandang Gabi... Bayan&quot;. On July 8, 1996, de Castro became the sole anchor of &quot;TV Patrol&quot;. In January 1999 and July 2024, he became the newscast&#x27;s overall head of production and became the senior vice president of DZMM. On February 12, 2001, de Castro left the newscast to run for Senator.

During his term as Vice President of the Philippines from 2004 to 2010, On July 2, 2005, to June 28, 2010, he co-anchored the program &quot;Para Sa&#x27;yo, Bayan&quot;, which aired weekly on DZMM.

On July 12, 2010, &quot;Kabayan&quot; returned with de Castro as its anchor again. On November 8, 2010, he returned as an anchor of &quot;TV Patrol&quot;, replacing Julius Babao who left the newscast as the latter would move to &quot;Bandila&quot; alongside Karen Davila. He joined Korina Sanchez and Ted Failon for his second stint until October 7, 2021. On January 10, 2011, he started co-anchoring &quot;Radyo Patrol Balita: Alas Siyete&quot; (later renamed &quot;TeleBalita&quot; and &quot;TeleRadyo Balita&quot; in 2020) as it was combined with &quot;Kabayan&quot;.

He had been a staunch critic of almost all programs of President Benigno Aquino III, who has criticized former President Arroyo, de Castro&#x27;s running mate in the 2004 elections. He has been known to fire tirades against Aquino throughout Aquino&#x27;s presidency (which ended in May 2016). During the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte, however, he became meek as former President Arroyo had close ties with Duterte. De Castro has been criticized for perceived misogyny, homophobia and transphobia in live television. In 2018, he was being eyed by the Duterte administration for a possible return in politics under the new administration. De Castro supports the Philippine Drug War. De Castro, along with Persida Acosta, amplified the possibility of Dengvaxia vaccination, which began during former President Aquino&#x27;s term, as the cause of death of children in the Philippines. It was later proven by the World Health Organization and the Philippine Department of Health that Dengvaxia is safe and that the initial deaths of children were not connected with Dengvaxia. Various organizations have blamed de Castro and Acosta for their misinformation which led to the deaths of numerous Filipino youths due to a &quot;vaccination scare campaign&quot;.

On November 8, 2021, after backing out of another Senate run, de Castro returned to ABS-CBN and resumed as anchor for both &quot;TeleRadyo Balita&quot; and &quot;Kabayan&quot; on TeleRadyo and Kapamilya Channel. He also became the host of the new public affairs program &quot;&quot; on Kapamilya Channel, TeleRadyo and A2Z; it aired until January 1, 2023. On January 9, 2023, he returned to &quot;TV Patrol&quot; for his third stint, joining Bernadette Sembrano, Henry Omaga-Diaz and Karen Davila, coinciding with the celebration of the Feast of the Black Nazarene. In January 2025, he took a temporarily leave from ABS-CBN until February 3, 2025.

== Political career ==
=== Senate career (2001–2004) ===
In the 2001 Philippine Senate election, de Castro garnered the most votes and was the top-notcher for that year, garnering over 16.2 million votes running as an Independent under the Puwersa ng Masa coalition, the opposition coalition that backed ousted President Joseph Estrada.

De Castro&#x27;s three-year stint in the Senate saw him author 252 bills and resolutions, including the Expanded Senior Citizens Act of 2002, Balikbayan Law of 2002, Quarantine Act and Newborn Screening Test Act of 2001.

De Castro did not finish his six-year term when he was elected to the vice presidency in the 2004 Philippine presidential election.

=== Vice presidency (2004–2010) ===


In the 2004 Philippine election, de Castro ran for vice president. He won by a narrow margin over Senator Loren Legarda, but an electoral protest was filed by the latter. The Supreme Court, acting as the Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET), dismissed the protest. He was appointed by President Arroyo as chairman for housing and urban development (HUDCC). As HUDCC Chair, Vice President de Castro also serves as ex officio chairman of the Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF or Pag-IBIG Fund), the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB), the National Housing Authority (Philippines) (NHA), the National Home Mortgage Finance Corporation (NHMFC) and the Social Housing Finance Corporation (SHFC) as well as ex officio vice chairman of the Home Guaranty Corporation (HGC). He has also been designated as concurrent presidential adviser on overseas Filipino workers, as alternate chairman of the National Anti-Poverty Commission, head of the Task Force Against Illegal Recruitment, price monitoring czar and cabinet officer for Regional Development Palawan.

De Castro was chairman of the Pag-IBIG Fund when the housing scam involving Globe Asiatique (GA) scam took place. Throughout his vice presidency, de Castro had minimal limelight and was regarded only as &quot;backup&quot; for the then incumbent party coalition if ever President Arroyo was ousted.

=== 2010 presidential election ===
De Castro was initially a front runner in the 2010 presidential election. Being the vice president, he was a popular choice among older voters to replace outgoing president Arroyo. However, his lead was taken by Benigno Aquino III (who later won) after Aquino declared his intent to run for president. In December 2009, he did not file to be included on the ballot. In an interview conducted by Karen Davila, he announced that he would retire from politics at the end of his vice presidential term and intended to commit himself full time to broadcast journalism.

=== 2022 Senate election bid and subsequent withdrawal ===
De Castro initially announced his intention to run as senator for the 2022 Senate election. On October 7, 2021, he took oath as a new member of Aksyon Demokratiko and made his last appearance on his programs. He subsequently filed his certificate of candidacy on October 8. However, on October 13, he withdrew his candidacy.

<doc id="796629" wikidata="Q76521" url="?curid=796629" title="Max Scheler">
<text>Max Ferdinand Scheler (; 22 August 1874 – 19 May 1928) was a German philosopher known for his work in phenomenology, ethics, and philosophical anthropology. Considered in his lifetime one of the most prominent German philosophers, Scheler developed the philosophical method of Edmund Husserl, the founder of phenomenology.

After Scheler&#x27;s death in 1928, Martin Heidegger affirmed, with Ortega y Gasset, that all philosophers of the century were indebted to Scheler and praised him as &quot;the strongest philosophical force in modern Germany, nay, in contemporary Europe and in contemporary philosophy as such.&quot;

==Life and career==

===Childhood===
Max Scheler was born in Munich, Germany, on 22 August 1874, to a well-respected orthodox Jewish family: his Catholic father had converted to Judaism in order to marry his mother. He had &quot;a rather typical late nineteenth century upbringing in a Jewish household bent on assimilation and agnosticism.&quot; He converted to Chistianity (Catholic) in 1901.

===Student years===
Scheler began his university studies as a medical student at the University of Munich; he then transferred to the University of Berlin where he abandoned medicine in favor of philosophy and sociology, studying under Wilhelm Dilthey, Carl Stumpf and Georg Simmel. He moved to the University of Jena in 1896 where he studied under Rudolf Eucken, at that time a very popular philosopher who went on to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1908. (Eucken corresponded with William James, a noted proponent of philosophical pragmatism, and throughout his life, Scheler entertained a strong interest in pragmatism.) It was at Jena that Scheler completed his doctorate and his &quot;habilitation&quot; and began his professional life as a teacher. His doctoral thesis, completed in 1897, was entitled &quot;Beiträge zur Feststellung der Beziehungen zwischen den logischen und ethischen Prinzipien&quot; (Contribution to establishing the relationships between logical and ethical principles). In 1898 he made a trip to Heidelberg and met Max Weber, who also had a significant impact on his thought. He earned his &quot;habilitation&quot; in 1899 with a thesis entitled &quot;Die transzendentale und die psychologische Methode&quot; (The transcendental and the psychological method) directed by Eucken. He became a lecturer (&quot;Privatdozent&quot;) at the University of Jena in 1901.

===First period (Jena, Munich, Gottingen and World War I)===
When his first marriage, to Amalie von Dewitz, ended in divorce, Scheler married Märit Furtwängler in 1912, who was the sister of the noted conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler. Scheler&#x27;s son by his first wife, Wolf Scheler, became troublesome after the divorce, often stealing from his father, and in 1923, after Wolf had tried to force him to pay for a prostitute, Scheler sent him to his former student Kurt Schneider, a psychiatrist, for diagnosis. Schneider diagnosed Wolf as not being mentally ill, but a psychopath, using two diagnostic categories (Gemütlos and Haltlos) essentially equivalent to today&#x27;s &quot;antisocial personality disorder&quot;.

===Second period (Cologne)===
After 1921 he disassociated himself in public from Catholic teaching and even from the Judeo-Christian-Islamic God, committing himself to pantheism and philosophical anthropology.

Scheler had developed the habit of smoking between sixty and eighty cigarettes a day which contributed to a series of heart attacks throughout 1928, forcing him to cancel any travel plans. On May 19, 1928, he died in a Frankfurt hospital due to complications from a severe heart attack.

==Philosophical contributions==

===Love and the &quot;phenomenological attitude&quot;===

When the editors of &quot;Geisteswissenschaften&quot; invited Scheler (about 1913/14) to write on the then developing philosophical method of phenomenology, Scheler indicated that the phenomenological movement was not defined by universally accepted theses but by a &quot;common bearing and attitude toward philosophical problems.&quot; Scheler disagrees with Husserl that phenomenology is a method of strict phenomenological reduction, but rather &quot;an attitude of spiritual seeing … something which otherwise remains hidden ….&quot; Calling phenomenology a method fails to take seriously the phenomenological domain of original experience: the givenness of phenomenological facts (essences or values as &quot;a priori&quot;) &quot;before they have been fixed by logic,&quot; and prior to assuming a set of criteria or symbols, as is the case in the natural and human sciences as well as other (modern) philosophies which tailor their methods to those of the sciences.

Rather, that which is given in phenomenology &quot;is given only in the seeing and experiencing act itself.&quot; The essences are never given to an &#x27;outside&#x27; observer without direct contact with a specific domain of experience. Phenomenology is an engagement of phenomena, while simultaneously a waiting for its self-givenness; it is not a methodical procedure of observation as if its object is stationary. Thus, the particular attitude (&quot;Geisteshaltung&quot;, lit. &quot;disposition of the spirit&quot; or &quot;spiritual posture&quot;) of the philosopher is crucial for the disclosure, or seeing, of phenomenological facts. This attitude is fundamentally a moral one, where the strength of philosophical inquiry rests upon the basis of love. Scheler describes the essence of philosophical thinking as &quot;&quot;a love-determined movement of the inmost personal self of a finite being toward participation in the essential reality of all possibles&quot;.&quot;

The movement and act of love is important for philosophy for two reasons: (1) If philosophy, as Scheler describes it, hearkening back to the Platonic tradition, is a participation in a &quot;primal essence of all essences&quot; (&quot;Urwesen&quot;), it follows that for this participation to be achieved one must incorporate within oneself the content or essential characteristic of the primal essence. For Scheler, such a primal essence is most characterized according to love, thus the way to achieve the most direct and intimate participation is precisely to share in the movement of love. It is important to mention, however, that this primal essence is not an objectifiable entity whose possible correlate is knowledge; thus, even if philosophy is always concerned with knowing, as Scheler would concur, nevertheless, reason itself is not the proper participative faculty by which the greatest level of knowing is achieved. Only when reason and logic have behind them the movement of love and the proper moral preconditions can one achieve philosophical knowledge. (2) Love is likewise important insofar as its essence is the condition for the possibility of the givenness of value-objects and especially the givenness of an object in terms of its highest possible value. Love is the movement which &quot;brings about the continuous emergence of ever-higher value in the object--just as if it was streaming out from the object of its own accord, without any sort of exertion...on the part of the lover. ...true love opens our spiritual eyes to ever-higher values in the object loved.&quot; Hatred, on the other hand, is the closing off of oneself or closing one&#x27;s eyes to the world of values. It is in the latter context that value-inversions or devaluations become prevalent, and are sometimes solidified as proper in societies. Furthermore, by calling love a movement, Scheler hopes to dispel the interpretation that love and hate are only reactions to felt values rather than the very ground for the possibility of value-givenness (or value-concealment). Scheler writes, &quot;Love and hate are acts in which the value-realm accessible to the feelings of a being...is either &quot;extended&quot; or &quot;narrowed&quot;.&quot;

===Material value-ethics===

Values and their corresponding disvalues are ranked according to their essential interconnections as follows:

# Religiously relevant values (holy/unholy)
# Spiritual values (beauty/ugliness, knowledge/ignorance, right/wrong)
# Vital values (health/unhealthiness, strength/weakness)
# Sensible values (agreeable/disagreeable, comfort/discomfort)

Further essential interconnections apply with respect to a value&#x27;s (disvalue&#x27;s) existence or non-existence:

* The existence of a positive value is itself a positive value.
* The existence of a negative value (disvalue) is itself a negative value.
* The non-existence of a positive value is itself a negative value.
* The non-existence of a negative value is itself a positive value.

And with respect to values of good and evil:

* Good is the value that is attached to the realization of a positive value in the sphere of willing.
* Evil is the value that is attached to the realization of a negative value in the sphere of willing.
* Good is the value that is attached to the realization of a higher value in the sphere of willing.
* Evil is the value that is attached to the realization of a lower value [at the expense of a higher one] in the sphere of willing.

Goodness, however, is not simply &quot;attached&quot; to an act of willing, but originates ultimately within the disposition (&quot;Gesinnung&quot;) or &quot;basic moral tenor&quot; of the acting person. Accordingly:

* The criterion of &#x27;good&#x27; consists in the agreement of a value intended, in the realization, with the value preferred, or in its disagreement with the value rejected.
* The criterion of &#x27;evil&#x27; consists in the disagreement of a value intended, in the realization, with the value preferred, or in its agreement with the value rejected.

===&quot;Man and History&quot; (1924)===
Scheler planned to publish his major work in anthropology in 1929, but the completion of such a project was curtailed by his premature death in 1928. Some fragments of such work have been published in &quot;Nachlass&quot;. In 1924, &quot;Man and History&quot; (&quot;Mensch und Geschichte&quot;), Scheler gave some preliminary statements on the range and goal of philosophical anthropology.

In this book, Scheler argues for a tabula rasa of all the inherited prejudices from the three main traditions that have formulated an idea of man: religion, philosophy and science. Scheler argues that it is not enough just to reject such traditions, as did Nietzsche with the Judeo-Christian religion by saying that &quot;God is dead&quot;; these traditions have impregnated all parts of our culture, and therefore still determine a great deal of the way of thinking even of those that don&#x27;t believe in the Christian God.
