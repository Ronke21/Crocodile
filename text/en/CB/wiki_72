<text>Prestressed concrete is a form of concrete used in construction. It is substantially prestressed (compressed) during production, in a manner that strengthens it against tensile forces which will exist when in service. It was patented by Eug√®ne Freyssinet in 1928. 

This compression is produced by the tensioning of high-strength &quot;tendons&quot; located within or adjacent to the concrete and is done to improve the performance of the concrete in service. Tendons may consist of single wires, multi-wire strands or threaded bars that are most commonly made from high-tensile steels, carbon fiber or aramid fiber. The essence of prestressed concrete is that once the initial compression has been applied, the resulting material has the characteristics of high-strength concrete when subject to any subsequent compression forces and of ductile high-strength steel when subject to tension forces. This can result in improved structural capacity or serviceability, or both, compared with conventionally reinforced concrete in many situations. In a prestressed concrete member, the internal stresses are introduced in a planned manner so that the stresses resulting from the imposed loads are counteracted to the desired degree.

Prestressed concrete is used in a wide range of building and civil structures where its improved performance can allow for longer spans, reduced structural thicknesses, and material savings compared with simple reinforced concrete. Typical applications include high-rise buildings, residential concrete slabs, foundation systems, bridge and dam structures, silos and tanks, industrial pavements and nuclear containment structures.

First used in the late nineteenth century, prestressed concrete has developed beyond pre-tensioning to include post-tensioning, which occurs after the concrete is cast. Tensioning systems may be classed as either &#x27;monostrand&#x27;, where each tendon&#x27;s strand or wire is stressed individually, or &#x27;multi-strand&#x27;, where all strands or wires in a tendon are stressed simultaneously. Tendons may be located either &quot;within&quot; the concrete volume (internal prestressing) or wholly &quot;outside&quot; of it (external prestressing). While pre-tensioned concrete uses tendons directly bonded to the concrete, post-tensioned concrete can use either bonded or unbonded tendons.

==Pre-tensioned concrete==

Pre-tensioned concrete is a variant of prestressed concrete where the tendons are tensioned &quot;prior&quot; to the concrete being cast. The concrete bonds to the tendons as it cures, following which the end-anchoring of the tendons is released, and the tendon tension forces are transferred to the concrete as compression by static friction.
Pre-tensioning is a common prefabrication technique, where the resulting concrete element is manufactured off-site from the final structure location and transported to site once cured. It requires strong, stable end-anchorage points between which the tendons are stretched. These anchorages form the ends of a &quot;casting bed&quot; which may be many times the length of the concrete element being fabricated. This allows multiple elements to be constructed end-to-end in the one pre-tensioning operation, allowing significant productivity benefits and economies of scale to be realized.

The amount of bond (or adhesion) achievable between the freshly set concrete and the surface of the tendons is critical to the pre-tensioning process, as it determines when the tendon anchorages can be safely released. Higher bond strength in early-age concrete will speed production and allow more economical fabrication. To promote this, pre-tensioned tendons are usually composed of isolated single wires or strands, which provides a greater surface area for bonding than bundled-strand tendons.
Unlike those of post-tensioned concrete (see below), the tendons of pre-tensioned concrete elements generally form straight lines between end anchorages. Where &quot;profiled&quot; or &quot;harped&quot; tendons are required, one or more intermediate &quot;deviators&quot; are located between the ends of the tendon to hold the tendon to the desired non-linear alignment during tensioning. Such deviators usually act against substantial forces, and hence require a robust casting-bed foundation system. Straight tendons are typically used in &quot;linear&quot; precast concrete elements, such as shallow beams and hollow-core slabs; whereas profiled tendons are more commonly found in deeper precast bridge beams and girders.

Pre-tensioned concrete is most commonly used for the fabrication of structural beams, floor slabs, hollow-core slabs, balconies, lintels, driven piles, water tanks and concrete pipes.
==Post-tensioned concrete==


Post-tensioned concrete is a variant of prestressed concrete where the tendons are tensioned &quot;after&quot; the surrounding concrete structure has been cast.

The tendons are not placed in direct contact with the concrete, but are encapsulated within a protective sleeve or duct which is either cast into the concrete structure or placed adjacent to it. At each end of a tendon is an anchorage assembly firmly fixed to the surrounding concrete. Once the concrete has been cast and set, the tendons are tensioned (stressed) by pulling the tendon ends through the anchorages while pressing against the concrete. The large forces required to tension the tendons result in a significant permanent compression being applied to the concrete once the tendon is &quot;locked off&quot; at the anchorage. The method of locking the tendon ends to the anchorage is dependent upon the tendon composition, with the most common systems being &quot;button-head&quot; anchoring (for wire tendons), &quot;split-wedge&quot; anchoring (for strand tendons), and &quot;threaded&quot; anchoring (for bar tendons).
Tendon encapsulation systems are constructed from plastic or galvanised steel materials, and are classified into two main types: those where the tendon element is subsequently bonded to the surrounding concrete by internal grouting of the duct after stressing (&quot;bonded&quot; post-tensioning); and those where the tendon element is permanently &quot;de&quot;bonded from the surrounding concrete, usually by means of a greased sheath over the tendon strands (&quot;unbonded&quot; post-tensioning).

Casting the tendon ducts or sleeves into the concrete before any tensioning occurs allows them to be readily profiled to any desired shape including incorporating vertical or horizontal curvature or both. When the tendons are tensioned, this profiling results in reaction forces being imparted onto the hardened concrete, and these can be beneficially used to counter any loadings subsequently applied to the structure.

===Bonded post-tensioning===

In bonded post-tensioning, tendons are permanently bonded to the surrounding concrete by the &quot;in situ&quot; grouting of their encapsulating ducting (after tendon tensioning). This grouting is undertaken for three main purposes: to protect the tendons against corrosion; to permanently lock in the tendon pre-tension, thereby removing the long-term reliance upon the end-anchorage systems; and to improve certain structural behaviors of the final concrete structure.

Bonded post-tensioning characteristically uses tendons each comprising &quot;bundles&quot; of elements (e.g., strands or wires) placed inside a single tendon duct, with the exception of bars which are mostly used unbundled. This bundling makes for more efficient tendon installation and grouting processes, since each complete tendon requires only one set of end anchorages and one grouting operation. Ducting is fabricated from a durable and corrosion-resistant material such as plastic (e.g., polyethylene) or galvanised steel, and can be either round or rectangular/oval in cross-section. The tendon sizes used are highly dependent upon the application, ranging from building works typically using between 2 and 6 strands per tendon, to specialized dam works using up to 91 strands per tendon.

Fabrication of bonded tendons is generally undertaken on-site, commencing with the fitting of end anchorages to formwork, placing the tendon ducting to the required curvature profiles, and reeving (or threading) the strands or wires through the ducting. Following concreting and tensioning, the ducts are pressure-grouted and the tendon-stressing ends sealed against corrosion.

===Unbonded post-tensioning===
Unbonded post-tensioning differs from bonded post-tensioning by allowing the tendons permanent freedom of longitudinal movement relative to the concrete. This is most commonly achieved by encasing each individual tendon element within a plastic sheathing filled with a corrosion-inhibiting grease, usually lithium-based. Anchorages at each end of the tendon transfer the tensioning force to the concrete, and are required to reliably perform this role for the life of the structure.

Unbonded post-tensioning can take the form of:
* Individual strand tendons placed directly into the concreted structure (e.g., buildings, ground slabs)
* Bundled strands, individually greased-and-sheathed, forming a single tendon within an encapsulating duct that is placed either within or adjacent to the concrete (e.g., restressable anchors, external post-tensioning)

For individual strand tendons, no additional tendon ducting is used and no post-stressing grouting operation is required, unlike for bonded post-tensioning. Permanent corrosion protection of the strands is provided by the combined layers of grease, plastic sheathing, and surrounding concrete. Where strands are bundled to form a single unbonded tendon, an enveloping duct of plastic or galvanised steel is used and its interior free spaces grouted after stressing. In this way, additional corrosion protection is provided via the grease, plastic sheathing, grout, external sheathing, and surrounding concrete layers.

Individually greased-and-sheathed tendons are usually fabricated off-site by an extrusion process. The bare steel strand is fed into a greasing chamber and then passed to an extrusion unit where molten plastic forms a continuous outer coating. Finished strands can be cut to length and fitted with &quot;dead-end&quot; anchor assemblies as required for the project.

===Comparison between bonded and unbonded post-tensioning===
Both bonded and unbonded post-tensioning technologies are widely used around the world, and the choice of system is often dictated by regional preferences, contractor experience, or the availability of alternative systems. Either one is capable of delivering code-compliant, durable structures meeting the structural strength and serviceability requirements of the designer.

The benefits that bonded post-tensioning can offer over unbonded systems are:
* Reduced reliance on end-anchorage integrity. Following tensioning and grouting, bonded tendons are connected to the surrounding concrete along their full length by high-strength grout. Once cured, this grout can transfer the full tendon tension force to the concrete within a very short distance (approximately 1 metre). As a result, any inadvertent severing of the tendon or failure of an end anchorage has only a very localised impact on tendon performance, and almost never results in tendon ejection from the anchorage.
* Increased ultimate strength in flexure. With bonded post-tensioning, any flexure of the structure is directly resisted by tendon strains at that same location (i.e. no strain redistribution occurs). This results in significantly higher tensile strains in the tendons than if they were unbonded, allowing their full yield strength to be realised, and producing a higher ultimate load capacity.
* Improved crack control. In the presence of concrete cracking, bonded tendons respond similarly to conventional reinforcement (rebar). With the tendons fixed to the concrete at each side of the crack, greater resistance to crack expansion is offered than with unbonded tendons, allowing many design codes to specify reduced reinforcement requirements for bonded post-tensioning.
* Improved fire performance. The absence of strain redistribution in bonded tendons may limit the impact that any localised overheating has on the overall structure. As a result, bonded structures may display a higher capacity to resist fire conditions than unbonded ones.

The benefits that unbonded post-tensioning can offer over bonded systems are:
* Ability to be prefabricated. Unbonded tendons can be readily prefabricated off-site complete with end anchorages, facilitating faster installation during construction. Additional lead time may need to be allowed for this fabrication process. 
* Improved site productivity. The elimination of the post-stressing grouting process required in bonded structures improves the site-labour productivity of unbonded post-tensioning.
* Improved installation flexibility. Unbonded single-strand tendons have greater handling flexibility than bonded ducting during installation, allowing them a greater ability to be deviated around service penetrations or obstructions.
* Reduced concrete cover. Unbonded tendons may allow some reduction in concrete element thickness, as their smaller size and increased corrosion protection may allow them to be placed closer to the concrete surface.
* Simpler replacement and adjustment. Being permanently isolated from the concrete, unbonded tendons can be readily de-stressed, re-stressed or replaced should they become damaged or need their tension adjusted in service.
* Superior overload performance. Although having a lower ultimate strength than bonded tendons, unbonded tendons&#x27; ability to redistribute strains over their full length can give them superior pre-collapse ductility. In extremes, unbonded tendons can resort to a catenary-type action instead of pure flexure, allowing significantly greater deformation before structural failure.

==Tendon durability and corrosion protection==
Long-term durability is an essential requirement for prestressed concrete given its widespread use.
Research on the durability performance of in-service prestressed structures has been undertaken since the 1960s, and anti-corrosion technologies for tendon protection have been continually improved since the earliest systems were developed.

The durability of prestressed concrete is principally determined by the level of corrosion protection provided to any high-strength steel elements within the prestressing tendons. Also critical is the protection afforded to the end-anchorage assemblies of unbonded tendons or cable-stay systems, as the anchorages of both of these are required to retain the prestressing forces. Failure of any of these components can result in the release of prestressing forces, or the physical rupture of stressing tendons.

Modern prestressing systems deliver long-term durability by addressing the following areas:
* Tendon grouting (bonded tendons)Bonded tendons consist of bundled strands placed inside ducts located within the surrounding concrete. To ensure full protection to the bundled strands, the ducts must be pressure-filled with a corrosion-inhibiting grout, without leaving any voids, following strand tensioning.
* Tendon coating (unbonded tendons)Unbonded tendons comprise individual strands coated in an anti-corrosion grease or wax, and fitted with a durable plastic-based full-length sleeve or sheath. The sleeving is required to be undamaged over the tendon length, and it must extend fully into the anchorage fittings at each end of the tendon.
* Double-layer encapsulationPrestressing tendons requiring permanent monitoring or force adjustment, such as stay cables and re-stressable dam anchors, will typically employ double-layer corrosion protection. Such tendons are composed of individual strands, grease-coated and sleeved, collected into a strand bundle and placed inside encapsulating polyethylene outer ducting. The remaining void space within the duct is pressure-grouted, providing a multi-layer polythene‚Äìgrout‚Äìplastic‚Äìgrease protection barrier system for each strand.
* Anchorage protectionIn all post-tensioned installations, protection of the end anchorages against corrosion is essential, and critically so for unbonded systems.

Several durability-related events are listed below:
* Ynys-y-Gwas bridge, West Glamorgan, Wales, 1985A single-span, precast-segmental structure constructed in 1953 with longitudinal and transverse post-tensioning. Corrosion attacked the under-protected tendons where they crossed the &quot;in-situ&quot; joints between the segments, leading to sudden collapse.
* Scheldt River bridge, Melle, Belgium, 1991A three-span prestressed cantilever structure constructed in the 1950s. Inadequate concrete cover in the side abutments resulted in tie-down cable corrosion, leading to a progressive failure of the main bridge span and the death of one person.
* UK Highways Agency, 1992Following discovery of tendon corrosion in several bridges in England, the Highways Agency issued a moratorium on the construction of new internally grouted post-tensioned bridges and embarked on a five-year programme of inspections on its existing post-tensioned bridge stock. The moratorium was lifted in 1996.
* Pedestrian bridge, Charlotte Motor Speedway, North Carolina, US, 2000A multi-span steel and concrete structure constructed in 1995. An unauthorised chemical was added to the tendon grout to speed construction, leading to corrosion of the prestressing strands and the sudden collapse of one span, injuring many spectators.
* Hammersmith Flyover London, England, 2011Sixteen-span prestressed structure constructed in 1961. Corrosion from road de-icing salts was detected in some of the prestressing tendons, necessitating initial closure of the road while additional investigations were done. Subsequent repairs and strengthening using external post-tensioning was carried out and completed in 2015.
* Petrulla Viaduct (&quot;Viadotto Petrulla&quot;), Sicily, Italy, 2014One span of a twelve-span viaduct collapsed on 7 July 2014, causing four injuries, due to corrosion of the post-tensioning tendons.
* Genoa bridge collapse, 2018. The Ponte Morandi was a cable-stayed bridge characterised by a prestressed concrete structure for the piers, pylons and deck, very few stays, as few as two per span, and a hybrid system for the stays constructed from steel cables with prestressed concrete shells poured on. The concrete was only prestressed to 10 MPa, resulting in it being prone to cracks and water intrusion, which caused corrosion of the embedded steel.
* Churchill Way flyovers, Liverpool, EnglandThe flyovers were closed in September 2018 after inspections revealed poor quality concrete, tendon corrosion and signs of structural distress. They were demolished in 2019.

==Applications==
Prestressed concrete is a highly versatile construction material as a result of it being an almost ideal combination of its two main constituents: high-strength steel, pre-stretched to allow its full strength to be easily realised; and modern concrete, pre-compressed to minimise cracking under tensile forces. Its wide range of application is reflected in its incorporation into the major design codes covering most areas of structural and civil engineering, including buildings, bridges, dams, foundations, pavements, piles, stadiums, silos, and tanks.

===Building structures===
Building structures are typically required to satisfy a broad range of structural, aesthetic and economic requirements. Significant among these include: a minimum number of (intrusive) supporting walls or columns; low structural thickness (depth), allowing space for services, or for additional floors in high-rise construction; fast construction cycles, especially for multi-storey buildings; and a low cost-per-unit-area, to maximise the building owner&#x27;s return on investment.

The prestressing of concrete allows load-balancing forces to be introduced into the structure to counter in-service loadings. This provides many benefits to building structures:
* Longer spans for the same structural depthLoad balancing results in lower in-service deflections, which allows spans to be increased (and the number of supports reduced) without adding to structural depth.
* Reduced structural thicknessFor a given span, lower in-service deflections allows thinner structural sections to be used, in turn resulting in lower floor-to-floor heights, or more room for building services.
* Faster stripping timeTypically, prestressed concrete building elements are fully stressed and self-supporting within five days. At this point they can have their formwork stripped and re-deployed to the next section of the building, accelerating construction cycle times.
* Reduced material costsThe combination of reduced structural thickness, reduced conventional reinforcement quantities, and fast construction often results in prestressed concrete showing significant cost benefits in building structures compared to alternative structural materials.

Some notable building structures constructed from prestressed concrete include: Sydney Opera House and World Tower, Sydney; St George Wharf Tower, London; CN Tower, Toronto; Kai Tak Cruise Terminal and International Commerce Centre, Hong Kong; Ocean Heights 2, Dubai; Eureka Tower, Melbourne; Torre Espacio, Madrid; Guoco Tower (Tanjong Pagar Centre), Singapore; Zagreb International Airport, Croatia; and Capital Gate, Abu Dhabi UAE.

===Civil structures===
====Bridges====
Concrete is the most popular structural material for bridges, and prestressed concrete is frequently adopted. When investigated in the 1940s for use on heavy-duty bridges, the advantages of this type of bridge over more traditional designs was that it is quicker to install, more economical and longer-lasting with the bridge being less lively. One of the first bridges built in this way is the Adam Viaduct, a railway bridge constructed 1946 in the UK. By the 1960s, prestressed concrete largely superseded reinforced concrete bridges in the UK, with box girders being the dominant form.

In short-span bridges of around , prestressing is commonly employed in the form of precast pre-tensioned girders or planks. Medium-length structures of around , typically use precast-segmental, &quot;in-situ&quot; balanced-cantilever and incrementally-launched designs. For the longest bridges, prestressed concrete deck structures often form an integral part of cable-stayed designs.

====Dams====
Concrete dams have used prestressing to counter uplift and increase their overall stability since the mid-1930s. Prestressing is also frequently retro-fitted as part of dam remediation works, such as for structural strengthening, or when raising crest or spillway heights.

Most commonly, dam prestressing takes the form of post-tensioned anchors drilled into the dam&#x27;s concrete structure, the underlying rock strata, or both. Such anchors typically comprise tendons of high-tensile bundled steel strands or individual threaded bars. A tendon is grouted to the concrete or rock at its far (internal) end and has a significant &quot;de-bonded&quot; free length at its external end which allows the tendon to stretch during tensioning. Tendons may be full-length-bonded to the surrounding concrete or rock once tensioned, or (more commonly) have strands permanently encapsulated in corrosion-inhibiting grease over the free length to permit long-term load monitoring and re-stressability.

====Silos and tanks====
Circular storage structures such as silos and tanks can use prestressing forces to directly resist the outward pressures generated by stored liquids or bulk solids.
Horizontally curved tendons are installed within the concrete wall to form a series of hoops, spaced vertically up the structure. When tensioned, these tendons exert both axial (compressive) and radial (inward) forces onto the structure, which can directly oppose the subsequent storage loadings. If the magnitude of the prestress is designed to always exceed the tensile stresses produced by the loadings, a permanent residual compression will exist in the wall concrete, assisting in maintaining a watertight crack-free structure.

====Nuclear and blast====
Prestressed concrete has been established as a reliable construction material for high-pressure containment structures such as nuclear reactor vessels and containment buildings, and petrochemical tank blast-containment walls. Using pre-stressing to place such structures into an initial state of bi-axial or tri-axial compression increases their resistance to concrete cracking and leakage, while providing a proof-loaded, redundant and monitorable pressure-containment system.

Nuclear reactor and containment vessels will commonly employ separate sets of post-tensioned tendons curved horizontally or vertically to completely envelop the reactor core. Blast containment walls, such as for liquid natural gas (LNG) tanks, will normally utilize layers of horizontally-curved hoop tendons for containment in combination with vertically looped tendons for axial wall pre-stressing.

====Hardstands and pavements====
Heavily loaded concrete ground slabs and pavements can be sensitive to cracking and subsequent traffic-driven deterioration. As a result, prestressed concrete is regularly used in such structures as its pre-compression provides the concrete with the ability to resist the crack-inducing tensile stresses generated by in-service loading. This crack resistance also allows individual slab sections to be constructed in larger pours than for conventionally reinforced concrete, resulting in wider joint spacings, reduced jointing costs and less long-term joint maintenance issues. Initial works have also been successfully conducted on the use of precast prestressed concrete for road pavements, where the speed and quality of the construction has been noted as being beneficial for this technique.

Some notable civil structures constructed using prestressed concrete include: Gateway Bridge, Brisbane Australia; Incheon Bridge, South Korea; Roseires Dam, Sudan; Wanapum Dam, Washington, US; LNG tanks, South Hook, Wales; Cement silos, Brevik Norway; Autobahn A73 bridge, Itz Valley, Germany; Ostankino Tower, Moscow, Russia; CN Tower, Toronto, Canada; and Ringhals nuclear reactor, Videbergshamn Sweden.

==Design agencies and regulations==
Worldwide, many professional organizations exist to promote best practices in the design and construction of prestressed concrete structures. In the United States, such organizations include the Post-Tensioning Institute (PTI) and the Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute (PCI). Similar bodies include the Canadian Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute (CPCI), the UK&#x27;s Post-Tensioning Association, the Post Tensioning Institute of Australia and the South African Post Tensioning Association. Europe has similar country-based associations and institutions.

These organizations are not the authorities of building codes or standards, but rather exist to promote the understanding and development of prestressed concrete design, codes and best practices.

Rules and requirements for the detailing of reinforcement and prestressing tendons are specified by individual national codes and standards such as:
*European Standard EN 1992-2:2005 ‚Äì Eurocode 2: Design of Concrete Structures;
* US Standard ACI318: Building Code Requirements for Reinforced Concrete; and
* Australian Standard AS 3600-2009: Concrete Structures.

<doc id="833502" wikidata="Q775586" url="?curid=833502" title="King of New York">
<text>King of New York is a 1990 neo-noir crime film directed by Abel Ferrara and written by Nicholas St. John. It stars Christopher Walken, Laurence Fishburne, David Caruso, Victor Argo and Wesley Snipes, with supporting roles played by Giancarlo Esposito, Steve Buscemi, Paul Calder√≥n, Janet Julian and Theresa Randle. Walken portrays Frank White, a New York City drug kingpin rebuilding his criminal empire after his release from prison, while also attempting to go legitimate.

The film was released by Carolco Pictures (through New Line Cinema) on September 28, 1990. It received mixed reviews from critics, with several criticizing the film&#x27;s violence and dark tone. Retrospective reviews have been much more positive, and the film has been described as one of Ferrara&#x27;s best.

== Plot ==
Frank White, a drug lord, strives to control New York City&#x27;s criminal underground. Shortly after his release from Sing Sing Penitentiary, White and his crew, led by his trigger-happy right-hand man Jimmy Jump, consolidate power by eliminating their rivals in the Colombian drug cartel and Triad. White personally executes a Mafia boss who refuses to cooperate with him.

White&#x27;s exploits catch the attention of the NYPD&#x27;s narcotics squad. Detectives Bishop, Gilley and Flanigan confront White but lack any tangible evidence to arrest him. They instead turn their attention to White&#x27;s henchmen, whom they arrest after a surviving member of the Colombian drug cartel agrees to cooperate with the police.

White&#x27;s lawyers intervene and free the men from jail. Gilley and Flanigan, extremely frustrated at White&#x27;s use of the law to dodge justice, decide to simply murder White and his crew. They storm a night club where White is partying and kill many of his men. White and Jump survive the raid but are chased by Gilley and Flanigan. Jump ambushes and mortally wounds Flanigan. Gilley is unable to resuscitate his partner, and executes Jump in a fit of rage.

A grief-stricken Gilley attends Flanigan&#x27;s funeral, where he is abruptly assassinated by White in a drive-by shooting. White then confronts detective Bishop in his own apartment. He holds him at gunpoint while explaining that he eliminated the Colombian drug cartel and Triad in New York City because he disapproved of their involvement in human trafficking and child prostitution. White restrains Bishop to a chair and leaves.

Bishop escapes his restraints and chases White into the subway. Both men draw guns on each other, but White uses an innocent bystander as a human shield. The two exchange gunfire and Bishop is killed. White exits the subway and makes his way to a taxi in Times Square. He clutches a gunshot wound to his torso and watches as police surround his taxi. White goes limp as the police close in on him.

== Cast ==
== Production ==

=== Development ===
Abel Ferrara and Nicholas St. John had wanted to make &quot;King of New York&quot; since the early 1980&#x27;s. Ferrara had shot test footage and begun casting calls as early as 1981, but shelved the project. Over the intervening nine years, the script was heavily rewritten.

Due to the film&#x27;s controversial subject matter, Ferrara had difficulty finding an American studio willing to back the picture. The film was ultimately financed entirely by Italian companies Reteitalia and Scena International. Producer Augusto Caminito described the project as a bridge between Italian and American film industries, and likened the story to a modern-day Robin Hood.

=== Filming ===
Principal photography began on April 19 and June 14, 1989. &quot;King of New York&quot; was shot entirely in and around New York City. According to Ferrara, then-owner Donald Trump gave him permission to film at the Plaza Hotel at no charge, on the condition that Walken would pose for a photograph with Ivana Trump, who was a fan of the actor.

Filming locations included Sing Sing, the Plaza Hotel, Times Square, Times Square‚Äì42nd Street station, Williamsburg, Queensboro Bridge, Fifth Avenue, Ossining, and Saranac Lake. Silvercup Studios served as the main studio.

The film initially received an X rating from the MPAA, but was reduced to an R after an appeal.

== Release ==
=== Home media ===
&quot;King of New York&quot; was released on a 2-Disc Special Edition DVD on April 20, 2004. The film was released on Blu-ray on October 23, 2007.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 73% based on 30 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;&quot;King of New York&quot; covers familiar narrative ground with impressive style -- and leaves plenty of room for its talented cast to deliver gripping performances.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100 based on 20 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

&quot;Total Film&quot; rated &quot;King of New York&quot; four stars out of five. Roger Ebert awarded two stars out of four, citing Walken&#x27;s &quot;usual polished and somehow sinister ease&quot; and the director&#x27;s strong command of mood and style, marred by a sketchy screenplay and a fragmented plot. Mark Caro, writing for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, gave the movie only 1/2 star, adding that star Christopher Walken and the movie remain &quot;just out of grasp&quot;. The film was also featured in Steven Jay Schneider&#x27;s 7th Edition of &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot;.

Bojan Bazelli was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for Best Cinematography.

== In popular culture ==
Rapper The Notorious B.I.G. sometimes referred to himself by the monikers &#x27;Frank White&#x27; and &#x27;The King Of New York&#x27;, after the main character of this film.

Since Biggie&#x27;s death, multiple New York based rappers have used the &quot;King Of New York&quot; moniker, such as Jay-Z, 6ix9ine, and Westside Gunn.

<doc id="833506" wikidata="Q2383624" url="?curid=833506" title="Differential Galois theory">
<text>In mathematics, differential Galois theory is the field that studies extensions of differential fields.

==Overview==
Whereas algebraic Galois theory studies extensions of algebraic fields, differential Galois theory studies extensions of differential fields, i.e. fields that are equipped with a derivation, &quot;D&quot;. Much of the theory of differential Galois theory is parallel to algebraic Galois theory. One difference between the two constructions is that the Galois groups in differential Galois theory tend to be matrix Lie groups, as compared with the finite groups often encountered in algebraic Galois theory.

== Motivation and basic concepts ==
In mathematics, some types of elementary functions cannot express the indefinite integrals of other elementary functions. A well-known example is formula_1, whose indefinite integral is the error function formula_2, familiar in statistics. Other examples include the sinc function formula_3 and formula_4.

It&#x27;s important to note that the concept of elementary functions is merely conventional. If we redefine elementary functions to include the error function, then under this definition, the indefinite integral of formula_1 would be considered an elementary function. However, no matter how many functions are added to the definition of elementary functions, there will always be functions whose indefinite integrals are not elementary.

Using the theory of differential Galois theory , it is possible to determine which indefinite integrals of elementary functions cannot be expressed as elementary functions. Differential Galois theory is based on the framework of Galois theory. While algebraic Galois theory studies field extensions of fields, differential Galois theory studies extensions of differential fields‚Äîfields with a derivation &quot;D&quot;.

Most of differential Galois theory is analogous to algebraic Galois theory. The significant difference in the structure is that the Galois group in differential Galois theory is an algebraic group, whereas in algebraic Galois theory, it is a profinite group equipped with the Krull topology.

== Definition ==
For any differential field &quot;F&quot; with derivation &quot;D&quot;, there exists a subfield called the field of constants of &quot;F&quot;, defined as:
: Con(&quot;F&quot;) = {&quot;f&quot; ‚àà &quot;F&quot; | &quot;Df&quot; = 0}.
The field of constants contains the prime field of &quot;F&quot;.

Given two differential fields &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot;, &quot;G&quot; is called a simple differential extension of &quot;F&quot; if

and satisfies
: ‚àÉ&quot;s&quot;‚àà&quot;F&quot;; &quot;Dt&quot; = &quot;Ds&quot;/&quot;s&quot;,
then &quot;G&quot; is called a logarithmic extension of &quot;F&quot;.

This has the form of a logarithmic derivative. Intuitively, &quot;t&quot; can be thought of as the logarithm of some element &quot;s&quot; in &quot;F&quot;, corresponding to the usual chain rule. &quot;F&quot; does not necessarily have a uniquely defined logarithm. Various logarithmic extensions of &quot;F&quot; can be considered. Similarly, an exponential extension satisfies
: ‚àÉ&quot;s&quot;‚àà&quot;F&quot;; &quot;Dt&quot; = &quot;tDs&quot;,
and a differential extension satisfies
: ‚àÉ&quot;s&quot;‚àà&quot;F&quot;; &quot;Dt&quot; = &quot;s&quot;.
A differential extension or exponential extension becomes a Picard-Vessiot extension when the field has characteristic zero and the constant fields of the extended fields match.

Keeping the above caveat in mind, this element can be regarded as the exponential of an element &quot;s&quot; in &quot;F&quot;. Finally, if there is a finite sequence of intermediate fields from &quot;F&quot; to &quot;G&quot; with Con(&quot;F&quot;) = Con(&quot;G&quot;), such that each extension in the sequence is either a finite algebraic extension, a logarithmic extension, or an exponential extension, then &quot;G&quot; is called an elementary differential extension .

Consider the homogeneous linear differential equation for formula_6:
: formula_7„ÄÄ‚Ä¶„ÄÄ(1).
There exist at most &quot;n&quot; linearly independent solutions over the field of constants. An extension &quot;G&quot; of &quot;F&quot; is a Picard-Vessiot extension for the differential equation (1) if &quot;G&quot; is generated by all solutions of (1) and satisfies Con(&quot;F&quot;) = Con(&quot;G&quot;).

An extension &quot;G&quot; of &quot;F&quot; is a Liouville extension if Con(&quot;F&quot;) = Con(&quot;G&quot;) is an algebraically closed field, and there exists an increasing chain of subfields
: &quot;F&quot; = &quot;F&quot;0 ‚äÇ &quot;F&quot;1 ‚äÇ ‚Ä¶ ‚äÇ &quot;F&quot;n = &quot;G&quot;
such that each extension &quot;F&quot;&quot;k&quot;+1 : &quot;Fk&quot; is either a finite algebraic extension, a differential extension, or an exponential extension. A Liouville extension of the rational function field C(&quot;x&quot;) consists of functions obtained by finite combinations of rational functions, exponential functions, roots of algebraic equations, and their indefinite integrals. Clearly, logarithmic functions, trigonometric functions, and their inverses are Liouville functions over C(&quot;x&quot;), and especially elementary differential extensions are Liouville extensions.

An example of a function that is contained in an elementary extension over C(&quot;x&quot;) but not in a Liouville extension is the indefinite integral of formula_1.

== Basic properties ==
For a differential field &quot;F&quot;, if &quot;G&quot; is a separable algebraic extension of &quot;F&quot;, the derivation of &quot;F&quot; uniquely extends to a derivation of &quot;G&quot;. Hence, &quot;G&quot; uniquely inherits the differential structure of &quot;F&quot;.

Suppose &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot; are differential fields satisfying Con(&quot;F&quot;) = Con(&quot;G&quot;), and &quot;G&quot; is an elementary differential extension of &quot;F&quot;. Let &quot;a&quot; ‚àà &quot;F&quot; and &quot;y&quot; ‚àà &quot;G&quot; such that &quot;Dy&quot; = &quot;a&quot; (i.e., &quot;G&quot; contains the indefinite integral of &quot;a&quot;). Then there exist &quot;c&quot;1, ‚Ä¶, &quot;c&quot;&quot;n&quot; ‚àà Con(&quot;F&quot;) and &quot;u&quot;1, ‚Ä¶, &quot;u&quot;&quot;n&quot;, &quot;v&quot; ‚àà &quot;F&quot; such that
: formula_9
(Liouville&#x27;s theorem). In other words, only functions whose indefinite integrals are elementary (i.e., at worst contained within the elementary differential extension of &quot;F&quot;) have the form stated in the theorem. Intuitively, only elementary indefinite integrals can be expressed as the sum of a finite number of logarithms of simple functions.

If &quot;G&quot;/&quot;F&quot; is a Picard-Vessiot extension, then &quot;G&quot; being a Liouville extension of &quot;F&quot; is equivalent to the differential Galois group having a solvable identity component. Furthermore, &quot;G&quot; being a Liouville extension of &quot;F&quot; is equivalent to &quot;G&quot; being embeddable in some Liouville extension field of &quot;F&quot;.

== Examples ==
* The field of rational functions of one complex variable C(&quot;x&quot;) becomes a differential field when taking the usual differentiation with respect to the variable &quot;x&quot; as the derivation. The field of constants of this field is the complex number field C.

* By Liouville&#x27;s theorem mentioned above, if &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) and &quot;g&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) are rational functions in &quot;z&quot;, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is non-zero, and &quot;g&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is non-constant, then formula_10 is an elementary function if and only if there exists a rational function &quot;h&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) such that formula_11. The fact that the error function and the sine integral (indefinite integral of the sinc function) cannot be expressed as elementary functions follows immediately from this property.
* In the case of the differential equation formula_12, the Galois group is the multiplicative group of complex numbers with absolute value 1, also known as the circle group. This is an example of a solvable group, and indeed, the solutions to this differential equation are elementary functions (trigonometric functions in this case).
* The differential Galois group of the Airy equation, formula_13, over the complex numbers is the special linear group of degree two, SL(2,C). This group is not solvable, indicating that its solutions cannot be expressed using elementary functions. Instead, the solutions are known as Airy functions.

== Applications ==
Differential Galois theory has numerous applications in mathematics and physics. It is used, for instance, in determining whether a given differential equation can be solved by quadrature (integration). It also has applications in the study of dynamic systems, including the integrability of Hamiltonian systems in classical mechanics.

One significant application is the analysis of integrability conditions for differential equations, which has implications in the study of symmetries and conservation laws in physics.

<text>A resident assistant (RA), also known by a variety of other names, is a trained peer leader who coordinates activities in residence halls in colleges and universities, mental health and substance abuse residential facilities, or similar establishments.

An RA has many roles and responsibilities, including building a residential community through programming, acting as a mentor for students, being a familiar first resource for students with academic or institutional questions, and enforcing residence policies. RAs assist residents with problem solving or refer them to counseling resources. Above all, a resident assistant must be an example and uphold professional and personal accountability as outlined by the institution.

At post-secondary institutions RAs are often undergraduate or graduate students themselves, and must balance their schedule and priorities with the needs of the students they are supporting. RAs must balance their own personal and academic needs while ensuring they are supporting and fostering community among residents, connecting residents with resources, and providing enriching programming. RAs will often report to a residence hall director, or another professional staff member within the Residence Life unit.

A major component of the job is not only creating a community, but also ensuring safety for all, for example, by participating in nightly community walks. Other duties held by RAs outside of community building and programming can include ordering supplies, managing a budget, and determining need for maintenance, repairs, and furnishings. They may maintain household records and assign rooms.

==Job benefits==
According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, the national mean hourly wage of an RA was $13.87 in 2017, and the national mean average annual wage was $28,850. An RA at a college or university does not typically receive an hourly wage, but is compensated in other ways. Common compensations are price-adjusted or free room, free board, and/or stipends. Listed below are two tables of RA hourly and annual mean wage, broken down by individual industries.

===Unionization===
Resident Assistants at some institutions have unionized to secure stronger benefits. Examples have included:
*Columbia University
*Barnard College
*Tufts University
*Swarthmore College
*Wesleyan University
*Emerson College
*Georgetown University
*Bucknell University
*Drexel University
*University of Pennsylvania
*Fordham University
*Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute

In unionizing progress:

== Job duties and responsibilities ==

Each institution has its own duties and requirements for an RA. The following are the more common responsibilities of an RA.

=== Administrative ===
An RA is often asked to be a liaison between the resident community of which they are a part and the residence hall director of the building. This often requires writing reports, keeping accurate records, completing timely follow-up, and maintaining good communication. RAs are usually required to meet with their building coordinator weekly or bi-weekly to discuss their residents, planned programming, and any other issues or subjects that could affect the ability to perform their administrative responsibilities. The RA may also assist with public relations and housing needs such as submitting facilities concerns for review and collecting information about resident move out. 

=== Community ===
The residents and the RA compose a community, simply by living together in a similar location. The RA may be required to foster this community by mentoring and encouraging the residents be tolerant and respectful of the other residents and their property. They often facilitate programming to create a sense of community and belonging on the floor or in the building. This programming is meant to bring a greater sense of community, with many institutions having strong community pride within residence halls in the form of mascots and traditions. Further, RAs are often expected to be positive role models within their communities. They are to act as role models of the standards put in place by the institution by demonstrating: academic integrity, respect for diversity and inclusion, and prioritizing community integration or participation. 

=== Interpersonal ===
These duties deal with directly helping the residents as individuals. This requires the RA to know all the residents and be able to help each resident if they run into any problems with each other as well as with other things that may follow. Some problems could pertain to relationships, classwork, or institutional questions. The RA should have the skills to either assist the resident, or know of a resource that the resident can use to solve their problem. A large portion of an RA&#x27;s role is not to be the expert in supporting students with all of their needs, but rather to have the knowledge and ability to identify when a resident is in need of support and refer residents to other resources that can support them such as counselling services, academic advising, etc. 

===Security===
These duties involve creating a safe and healthy environment for the residents to reside in. Many institutions require RAs to participate in a &#x27;on duty&#x27; rotation where they actively walk through and monitor communities throughout the night. While completing these nightly rounds, enforcing community standards, such as quiet hours and alcohol and drug policy are frequent occurrences. Fines, bonds, and behavioural contracts can be issued at many universities by RAs as a result but at other institutions RAs are only required to address and document concerns and professional staff such as residence hall directors complete the follow-up for community standard infractions. Monitoring floor activity and helping with conflict resolution between residents is another important security related duty of the RA. As more institutions take on a curricular approach and put learning at the forefront of their practice, many RAs are encouraged to have an educational-based conversation with students and focus on restoration and not reprimand them. Finally, while completing their nightly walk throughs RAs are often asked to check on the physical security of residence halls, ensuring doors are locked and there are no facilities concerns that need to be addressed. 

===Integration===
This refers to assisting residents in making a smooth transition into campus life by getting them involved in traditional activities in their institution such as homecoming events, for example. Many RAs are asked to help first-year residence students transition campus and academic life, providing orientation to campus services and being available for questions and support throughout the academic terms. Further, when residents move out of residence halls RAs help support their integration into the broader campus community. 

===Academic and awareness===
This refers to academic development and social awareness. Resident assistants are there to promote the well-being of residents in university housing, and to make sure that residents feel like they have enough resources available to them and know how to use them. RAs may try to teach students about social justice and inclusivity, and take students to places on campus where they can learn more about social justice and groups with differing identities. RAs can show students where to go when they need academic help or advice, and can even offer advice of their own as they are often older students with more experience.

===Identity===
This refers to the personal development of residents that enables them to gain a level of self-awareness. This can be fostered through student development theory frameworks such as Sanford&#x27;s theory of challenge and support and Kolb&#x27;s theory of experiential learning. 

===Independence===
Resident assistants must encourage the development of life skills and personal accountability amongst the residents. This may be through RAs teaching skills such as how to do laundry or cook, or bringing in additional resources such as career centres to support residents in learning how to make a cover letters or excel at job interviews.

===Programs===
One way many of these elements can be achieved is through programming. This is a major aspect of the job for a resident assistant. Programming can come in three different forms. This includes planned, passive, and take. A planned program is an event created or co-sponsored by the resident assistant. This event is specifically tailored to fit the needs and/or interests of the residents. Sometimes RAs are required to have one planned event for their residents a month, as well as contribute to a building program once a semester in which they work with other RAs to create a meaningful program for the whole building. A passive program is one that is completed without assembling or direct interaction between the residents and/or the resident assistant. Passive programs are generally used to start a conversation on a particular issue affecting the residents. These programs can range from a bulletin board that can be casually read in passing, or they can be more interactive like taking a survey, for example. Finally, take programs require the resident assistant to accompany residents to an event which can include an on-campus program such as an institution sponsored event, a basketball game or perhaps a movie. All these programs help to develop a community amongst residents and incorporate the core values mentioned above.

Active Program Ideas: Mocktails (alcohol safety), Condom Olympics (sex ed), DIY air fresheners with baking soda and essential oils (Hygiene), DIY Tote bags from old t- shirts (Sustainability), Ice-cream Social (Icebreaker), BJ&#x27;s and PJS- Ben and Jerrys (Sex education), Paint Nite (Alcohol safety).

Passive Program Ideas: Making a door dec (decoration) representative for that month (bunnies in March, ornaments in December, pumpkins in October), going door to door and handing out candy/ taping candy on their door, an interactive bulletin board where they can write countries they&#x27;ve been or what they&#x27;re thankful for in November.

=== Institution-specific === 
These duties are designated from the values and goals of the institution. This denotes that the RA should be a role model by following the regulations. In addition, the RA could be required to disseminate, explain, and uphold these regulations.

At the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, resident advisors are role models, peer advisors, resource referrals, student advocates, and educators. RAs assume leadership roles in creating a positive and friendly atmosphere for students of varied backgrounds. RAs at Illinois develop relationships with their residents on a personal level and try to become a resource to each of them. An RA at Illinois is responsible for a floor of residents, and creates programs and activities for their floor throughout the semester. RAs can point residents in the right direction and help them solve problems by referring them to departments on campus for more extensive help with certain issues. RAs also make sure to address the needs of underrepresented groups of students and work with other staff to incorporate the needs and wishes of these student groups into the community model.

At Illinois, RAs are compensated with waived fees for housing and meal plans, and are given a monthly stipend of roughly $105.00. RAs have nights where they are on duty, and must complete procedures such as checking the security of the building, making sure residents in the residence halls are safe and don‚Äôt have any unaddressed concerns, and be available to anyone who is having problems or needs help with something.

The job of an RA is to create a community among their residents that is inclusive, welcoming, and comfortable environment for students who are living in university housing. Creating a social and welcoming living space is important for students getting acclimated to a new setting (the college campus) and making sure students feel at home.

== International ==

=== Singapore ===
At the National University of Singapore, there are cluster leaders, resident assistants, and members of the Junior Common Room Committee (JCRC). Cluster leaders help keep students within their &quot;cluster&quot;, which are students on their floor, safe and healthy. They work alongside resident assistants (RAs) to work towards creating a safe and inclusive community for students. RAs are given training in areas such as crisis management, event organization, CPR and AED training, and presentation skills. The JCRC is a student body council made up of elected undergraduate students to help plan events and make sure that students within the residence have a say in what happens around them. Within this committee, there are 9 to 11 potential positions for each residence hall.

=== Mexico ===
In Mexico, resident assistants are typically called &quot;prefectos&quot;. The position has many of the same functions as in the USA, with a few exceptions including taking attendance every night at 11:30pm. The residence halls tend to be mainly of the same sex; therefore attendance is taken every night by a resident assistant to ensure opposite sex guests are no longer in the building.

=== United Kingdom ===
Positions similar to resident assistants are much rarer in the UK than the USA, reflecting British universities taking much less direct interest in their student&#x27;s personal, social and sporting life than their American equivalents. It is more common to have a professional manager, supported by a team of student assistants, whose role focuses on duties covering security, fire and first-aid along with night/weekend reception. However, some UK universities do have a similar role to that of the resident assistant in the USA. These are often called &quot;senior wardens&quot;, &quot;student wardens&quot; or &quot;senior mentors&quot;. Such positions do not generally much focus on improvement of student life, and are instead more directed towards pastoral care of residents along with practical responsibilities. The positions are most often filled by graduate students or sometimes undergraduate students from their second year of study on.

<text>Thornton Waldo Burgess (January 17, 1874 ‚Äì June 5, 1965) was an American conservationist and author of children&#x27;s stories. By the time he retired, he had written more than 170 books and 15,000 stories for his daily newspaper column.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Born January 14, 1874 in Sandwich, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod, Burgess was the son of Caroline F. Haywood and Thornton W. Burgess Sr., a direct descendant of Thomas Burgess, one of the first Sandwich settlers in 1637. Thornton, Sr., died the same year his son was born, and the young Thornton, Jr. was brought up by his mother in Sandwich. They lived in humble circumstances. As a youth, he worked tending cows, picking trailing arbutus (mayflowers) or berries, shipping water lilies from local ponds, selling candy, and trapping muskrats. William C. Chipman, one of his employers, lived on Discovery Hill Road, a wildlife habitat of woodland and wetland. This habitat became the setting of many stories in which Burgess refers to Smiling Pool and the Old Briar Patch.

Graduating from Sandwich High School in 1891, Burgess briefly attended a business college in Boston from 1892 to 1893, living in Somerville, Massachusetts, at that time. But he disliked studying business and wanted to be an author. He relocated to Springfield, Massachusetts, where he accepted a job as an editorial assistant at the Phelps Publishing Company. His first stories were written using the pseudonym &quot;W. B. Thornton&quot;.

Burgess married Nina Osborne in 1905, but she died in childbirth a year later, leaving him to raise their son alone. It is said that he began writing bedtime stories to entertain his young son, Thornton III. Burgess remarried in 1911; his wife Fannie had two children by a previous marriage. The couple later bought a home in Hampden, Massachusetts, in 1925 that became Burgess&#x27; permanent residence in 1957. His second wife died in August 1950. Burgess returned frequently to Sandwich, which he always claimed as his spiritual home. Many of his childhood experiences and the people he knew there influenced his interest and were the impetus for his concern for wildlife.

===&quot;Old Mother West Wind&quot;===
Burgess used his outdoor observations of nature as plots for his stories. In Burgess&#x27; first book, &quot;Old Mother West Wind&quot; (1910), the reader meets many of the characters found in later books and stories. The characters in the &quot;Old Mother West Wind&quot; series include Peter Rabbit (known briefly as Peter Cottontail), Jimmy Skunk, Sammy Jay, Bobby Raccoon, Little Joe Otter, Grandfather Frog, Billy Mink, Jerry Muskrat, Spotty the Turtle, Old Mother West Wind, and her Merry Little Breezes.

===Additional publications===
For the next 50 years, Burgess steadily wrote books that were published around the world in many languages, including French, Gaelic, German, Italian, Spanish, and Swedish. Collaborating with him was his illustrator and friend Harrison Cady who was born and raised in Gardner, Massachusetts, and thereafter of New York and Rockport, Massachusetts. Peter Rabbit was created by British author and illustrator Beatrix Potter, prompting Burgess to note, &quot;I like to think that Miss Potter gave Peter a name known the world over, while I with Mr. Cady&#x27;s help perhaps made him a character.&quot;

From 1895 to 1962, Burgess wrote &quot;nearly 900&quot; stories, natural science articles, and poems for magazines, including 201 children&#x27;s stories for &quot;People&#x27;s Home Journal&quot; magazine. For over 16 years from May 1913 through the magazine&#x27;s demise following its final December 1929 issue, Burgess published a children&#x27;s story in every issue of &quot;People&#x27;s Home Journal&quot; magazine.

From 1912 to 1960, without interruption, Burgess wrote his syndicated daily newspaper column (via the George Matthew Adams Service), &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot;.

===Radio broadcasts===
From 1912 to 1960, Burgess also broadcast on the radio. His &quot;Radio Nature League&quot; radio series began at WBZ (AM), then located in Springfield, in early January 1925. Burgess broadcast the program from the studio at the Hotel Kimball on Wednesday evening at 7:30¬†p.m. Praised by educators and parents, the program had listeners and members in more than 30 states at its peak. Burgess&#x27; &quot;Radio Nature League&quot; disbanded briefly in August 1930, but he continued to give radio talks for WBZ concerning conservation and the humane treatment of animals.

===Final publications===
In 1960, Burgess published his last book, &quot;Now I Remember, Autobiography of an Amateur Naturalist&quot;, depicting memories of his early life in Sandwich as well as his career highlights. That same year, Burgess, at the age of 86, had published his 15,000th newspaper column.

In 1998, Burgess&#x27; granddaughter, Frances B. Meigs, published &quot;My Grandfather, Thornton W. Burgess : An Intimate Portrait&quot;, detailing her childhood growing up under his wing.

===Death===
He died on June 5, 1965, at the age of 91. His son had died suddenly the year before.

==Awards and accomplishments==
Burgess was actively involved with conservation efforts. Some of his projects during his lifetime included:

* Helping to pass laws protecting migrant wildlife.
* &quot;The Green Meadow Club&quot; for land conservation programs.
* &quot;The Bedtime Stories Club&quot; for wildlife protection programs.
* &quot;Happy Jack Squirrel Saving Club&quot; for War Savings Stamps &amp; Bonds.
* &quot;The Radio Nature League&quot; broadcast from WBZ in Boston and WBZA in Springfield, Massachusetts.

For his efforts, Burgess also received:

* An Honorary Literary Degree in 1938, from Northeastern University 
* A special gold medal from the Museum of Science in Boston, for &quot;leading children down the path to the wide wonderful world of the outdoors&quot; 
* The Distinguished Service Medal of the Permanent Wildlife Protection Fund.

==Legacy and influence==

===Wildlife Sanctuaries and Museum===
After his death, the Massachusetts Audubon Society purchased Burgess&#x27; Hampden home and established the Laughing Brook Wildlife Sanctuary at that location; the house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Thornton W. Burgess Society operates the Green Briar Nature Center in East Sandwich, Massachusetts. The Society&#x27;s Thornton W. Burgess Museum in Sandwich closed to the public October 2012.

===Other===
* A middle school in Hampden, Massachusetts was named after Burgess in honor of his work for conservation. The school opened in 1967 and was closed by the Hampden-Wilbraham Regional School District in June 2018.
* In the early 1970s, an anime television adaptation of some of Burgess&#x27; works was produced by a Japanese animation studio and was later distributed worldwide. The English language translation was entitled &quot;Fables of the Green Forest&quot;.
* John Crowley&#x27;s novel &quot;Little, Big&quot; (1980) includes allusions to locations and characters in Burgess&#x27; stories.

<doc id="833519" wikidata="Q1002884" url="?curid=833519" title="Forge (character)">
<text>Forge is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, most commonly in association with the X-Men. A mutant with an unsurpassed brilliance in technology, he has had a lengthy career as a government weapons contractor. Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist John Romita Jr., Forge first appeared in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #184 (Aug. 1984).

Forge shared a romantic relationship with Storm and a brief affair with Mystique, which led him to associate with the X-Men and thus enhancing the technology at the X-Mansion. He was also a member of X-Factor.

==Publication history==

Forge was created by writer Chris Claremont and artist John Romita Jr., and first appeared in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #184 (Aug. 1984).

Claremont&#x27;s outline for the character&#x27;s debut identifies Forge as Daniel Lone Eagle, although that name has not been used for the character in Marvel canon.

As part of &quot;Marvel NOW!&quot;, Forge returns as a member of Cable&#x27;s X-Force.

==Fictional character biography==

===Early years===
Forge is a mutant with an innate superhuman talent for invention and an intuitive genius. He is a Native American of the Cheyenne nation. Despite being trained as a medicine man, he primarily relies upon technology rather than mysticism to accomplish his tasks. This causes conflict with his teacher, Naze, and ultimately leads him to leave and join the military.

While in the army, Forge served in the Vietnam War. After rising in the ranks to become a sergeant, he was asked to join S.H.I.E.L.D. Forge declines, seeing his need is in Vietnam. During his second tour of duty in the war, his comrades are killed by enemy troops. In anger, he uses their spirits to summon a band of demons to destroy the opposition. Forge, concerned about his former comrades, decides to order a B-52 bombing on his position to close the portal from the world of the unliving. The bombs destroy the spirits, but he is injured as well, losing his right leg and right hand. This action allows the demon called the Adversary to come to Earth. After this, Forge is hesitant to employ his mystical abilities.

Years later, Forge creates cybernetic replacements for his lost limbs. When Tony Stark stops making advanced weaponry for the US government, Forge is hired as an employee of the Defense Department.

One of his earliest commissions is to design a weapon to detect the Dire Wraiths. Subsequently, Forge constructs a device capable of neutralizing mutant powers. Following orders from the President, Henry Peter Gyrich, an agent of the National Security Council, takes the device. Forge protests because the device is untested and extremely dangerous to use. The device is used against Rogue, who was wanted for allegedly killing a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. However, the device instead removes the powers of her teammate, Storm.

===Romance===
Forge rescues Storm after she falls into a river. Forge brings her back to his home in Dallas, Texas. During her recovery, romantic feelings develop between them. When she finds out he developed the device which removed her abilities, Storm leaves. They are briefly reunited to fight the common enemy of the Dire Wraiths, who are trying to prevent Forge from perfecting his neutralizer. They are defeated by the combined forces of the X-Men, Magik and Amanda Sefton.

Forge later improves his Neutralizer, but is hesitant to design more devices like it because of what happened with Storm. With the help of the Wraiths&#x27; enemy, Rom the Space Knight, Forge creates a large-scale version of the neutralizer in Earth&#x27;s orbit. Rom and Forge use the device on the Wraith&#x27;s home-world, casting the entire race into the other-dimensional Limbo.

After saving the world, Forge destroys all remaining Neutralizers and focuses on ridding the Earth of the Adversary. The Adversary, in the shape of Naze, convinces Storm that Forge was driven insane by her leaving and is planning to open a gate to hell. Storm tries to kill Forge, but the moment she stabs him she sees that she was tricked. During the events of the &quot;Fall of the Mutants&quot; crossover, the Adversary banishes Storm and Forge to another dimension, devoid of human life. Storm and Forge spend an unknown amount of time there, rekindling their romance. Forge then restores Storm&#x27;s abilities and uses them to power a gate back home.

===X-Men===
Forge and Storm arrive on Earth and join the X-Men in their battle with the Adversary. Forge is required to sacrifice nine willing lives to banish the Adversary forever; eight X-Men and Madelyne Pryor volunteer and die in the casting of Forge&#x27;s spell. The goddess Roma intervenes and secretly restores the X-Men to life. Magik, younger sister of X-Man Colossus, sees Forge as responsible for the death of her brother and attacks Forge, who fights back using his knowledge of Native-American sorcery. Feeling guilty over his involvement, Forge allows Magik to stab him with her Soulsword in the hopes it will kill him. Instead, its effects cause both mutants to come to terms with their shortcomings.

====Destiny====
Forge, still unaware of the X-Men&#x27;s resurrection, fights alongside Mystique&#x27;s Freedom Force and an interim team of &quot;X-Men&quot; against the Reavers at Muir Island. He uses his mutant skills to create a rifle that deactivates the cyborg enemy Skullbuster and forces the rest of the Reavers to retreat. During the battle, Destiny is killed, but not before foreseeing that Forge and Mystique will one day love one another, a fact that both parties find implausible. Afterwards, Mystique blames him for Destiny&#x27;s death.

Banshee approaches Forge, on a lead given by Lorna Dane (Polaris) that the team is still alive. Forge is convinced by visions that all the X-Men are still alive. During this time, his days as a soldier in the Vietnam War are depicted. The two of them plan to travel all over the world looking for their missing friends, starting with Storm in Cairo, Egypt, but their plane is ambushed by the Fenris Twins. Later, they go to the ruins of the Xavier Mansion (destroyed during the events of &quot;Inferno&quot;), and rescue Jean Grey from a gang of Masque&#x27;s Morlocks. They finally learn that the X-Men are indeed alive, but have faked their deaths for the time being.

Forge and Banshee eventually find the X-Men and become full-time members. They fight against several threats, such as Genoshan soldiers, Skrulls, and the Shadow King. During &quot;X-Tinction Agenda&quot;, Forge&#x27;s skills are critical in defeating Cameron Hodge and overthrowing the Genoshan government. His plans are kept deep inside his own mind by a self-induced trance that even the forced removal of his artificial limbs cannot break.

====End of romance====
After the events of the &quot;Muir Island Saga&quot;, Forge becomes a member of the X-Mansion&#x27;s &quot;support team&quot;. He redesigns the Danger Room and the Blackbird jet.

With the arrival of Bishop and Storm&#x27;s constant involvement with the team, Forge and Storm&#x27;s relationship becomes rocky. Forge leaves the X-Men after coming to believe Storm would have rejected his proposal of marriage. The pair continue to have an on-again-off-again relationship, until it ends for good. Forge goes back home to Dallas to become a government contractor again and to help with the mental care of Mystique, who is becoming schizophrenic. During her stay, Forge and Mystique grow closer and have an affair.

===X-Factor===
Forge replaces Valerie Cooper as the new government liaison for the mutant superhero team X-Factor. Forge goes on his second cosmic adventure while with X-Factor, venturing to the far side of the sun with dozens of other superheroes in the incident known as the Infinity Crusade. Forge is personally affected as one of his team, Wolfsbane, is kidnapped by the villain called the Goddess. Forge ends up orbiting a duplicate Earth in an escape pod, along with the vigilante Nomad.

When the team begins to experience personal problems, Forge takes a more active involvement, gradually taking over the leadership of the remaining members of X-Factor. In this role, he sees the mutant criminals Mystique and Sabretooth forced to become unwilling members of his team. Forge also comes to terms with his heritage when the Adversary returns. With Naze&#x27;s assistance, Forge defeats the Adversary by combining technology created using his mutant powers with his mystical abilities. Under Forge&#x27;s leadership, X-Factor is tricked into hunting and battling former team member Multiple Man. Following this, Forge severs the team&#x27;s involvement with the government and leads them underground. Forge and Mystique become more attracted to one another while working together as members of the team, with Forge ultimately falling in love with Mystique. During their time underground, another former X-Factor member, Strong Guy, awakes from a coma that he suffered due to his powers over-stressing his heart. Forge creates a device that saves Strong Guy&#x27;s life. Along with the other team members, Forge is severely injured after Sabretooth betrays and attacks the team. Mystique escapes her forced membership while Forge is recuperating. After recovering from his injuries, Forge refuses to become a member of a new X-Factor line-up led by former team leader Havok, as he feels that Havok is no longer trustworthy. This new version of X-Factor disbands shortly thereafter. For a time, Forge is not active on any mutant groups, though he briefly works as support staff at the X-Men&#x27;s mansion.

===Xavier&#x27;s Underground===
Forge takes part in Xavier&#x27;s Underground movement. He works with a former X-Factor member, Multiple Man, in Genosha. Afterwards, Forge returns to the X-Men and briefly becomes a mentor to Danielle Moonstar.

Later, Charles Xavier asks him for help in locating Mystique whom he needs for a clandestine mission. Forge also helps Cannonball and Siryn find Cable with the aid of Deadpool, and builds a pair of special gauntlets for New X-Men team member Surge; afterward, he returns to his lab to build a Nimrod unit with the primary objective of protecting mutants and secondary objective of protecting humans. He then encounters a time-traveling Nimrod suffering from severe damage, demanding that Forge fix him; this version of Nimrod comes from an alternate future, and had compelled an alternate version of Forge (married to Storm, with two children) to build a device to allow it to travel to the past. The alternate Forge had seemingly complied, but actually built a device to send Nimrod not only back in time, but also to another timeline, and to disable him upon arrival. Nimrod threatens to harm this reality&#x27;s Storm, and Forge offers to transfer Nimrod into his own version of the Sentinel, which Nimrod agreed to. The transfer is interrupted by the arrival of Surge and the rest of the New X-Men, who had received Forge&#x27;s distress call through Surge&#x27;s own gauntlets; in the ensuing battle, Forge helps them defeat Nimrod.

===Messiah Complex===
After Forge sends Madrox and Layla to the future, he goes on a mission at Cyclops&#x27; behest to rendezvous with the other X-Men, who are on their way to confront Sinister&#x27;s forces. He is shot by a seemingly treacherous Bishop. He is seen later in the recovery room along with other injured X-Men.

===Divided We Stand===
Forge suffers an array of injuries, including serious head trauma, from Bishop&#x27;s attack during his mad quest to murder the first mutant child following M-Day. Bishop steals several time travel devices that Forge is reverse engineering. Throughout his recovery, Forge is obsessed with recreating his notes and research on these devices. Fixated to an unhealthy degree on this project, Forge shuts himself off in his home at Eagle Plaza to devote all his time to this work. But before he begins, he enhances his home&#x27;s defense systems to ensure that he never falls victim to such an attack again.

===Ghost Box===
Forge later returns in &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; #29, when the X-Men fly to his complex on Wundagore Mountain to confront him about his apparent role in an inter-dimensional invasion of Earth. After following a trail of mysteriously genetically created mutants and death, the X-Men track Forge down, who through a monologue, reveals his true madness. He wants to save the world from the Annexation, an invasion from a parallel world on the other side of the Ghost Box, the trans-dimensional teleporter. He plans to send the X-Men to the parallel universe that is home to the Ghost Boxes to destroy them before the Annexation begins. The X-Men try to talk Forge down, but he rebukes them and forcibly opens the Ghost Box, risking all life on Earth. Thanks to the assistance of Abigail Brand and Beast, a laser is shot into the opening of the Ghost Box. Before everything is destroyed, Ororo offers Forge a chance to come back with them. A bitter Forge rejects her offer, and stays in his complex as it is destroyed.

===Cable and X-Force===
As part of &quot;Marvel NOW!&quot;, Forge is shown to still be alive following the destruction of his complex, and has apparently restored his original right hand (but still uses a prosthetic for his right leg). Forge is approached by Cable (after he used his telepathic abilities to help cure him of his insanity) to be in a new X-Force team created by Cable.

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===
As part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot;, Forge appears as a member of Storm&#x27;s X-Men as their primary technician even though his relationship with Storm is awkward and strained. Forge programmed Cerebra into the body of a Sentinel with the capability to showcase human emotion and the ability to teleport along with mutant detection so she could be a bridge between Earth and Limbo.

===Dawn of X===
Professor X tasks Forge with modifying Cerebro so it can store backups for mutant minds. Forge would later assist the Marauders with recovering his mutant power neutralizers after they were co-opted by the Russians.

In &quot;Destiny of X&quot;, Forge is selected to be part of the new X-Men team during the second Hellfire Gala.

==Powers and abilities==

Forge is a mutant with a superhuman intuitive talent for inventing mechanical devices, backed up by the ability to visually perceive mechanical energy in action. This power allows him to instinctively recognize the potential and functional uses of any machine or technological device in his visual range, a skill that combined with his natural intelligence gives him the ability to conceive, design and build highly advanced mechanical devices; and operate, modify and disassemble existing technology or create countermeasures for it. Forge&#x27;s superhuman talent for invention does not mean that he is of a superhuman intellect; even a genius at invention must for the most part consciously work out the theoretical principles behind the invention and then the design of the invention itself through a series of logical steps. In Forge&#x27;s case, however, many of these logical steps are worked out by his subconscious mind. Forge himself is sometimes not fully aware of how he created a device and must disassemble it to determine how it works.

Forge wore synthetic stretch fabric backed by micro-thin bulletproof Kevlar and thermal insulation while a member of the X-Men. He sometimes employs devices of his own invention. Most notable among these was his Neutralizer gun that could suppress superhuman mutant abilities. The only known examples of this device have been destroyed. Forge has also invented a hand-held scanning device that can detect the presence of superhuman beings or aliens.

Forge has knowledge of many scientific and technological fields. He also possesses various mystical abilities such as spell casting through mystical training, though he rarely uses them. He possesses extensive knowledge of Native American magic.

His bionic-robotic right hand (which he has since restored to its original organic state) and right leg often contain concealed weapons and devices that he can use in combat. In addition, they can be outfitted with computer interfaces and plasma blasters. His skill as a hand-to-hand combatant and as a marksman from his military training were so impressive that Nick Fury offered him a job with S.H.I.E.L.D.

==Reception==
* In 2014, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Forge 38th in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every X-Man ever&quot; list.
* In 2018, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Forge 30th in their &quot;Age Of Apocalypse: The 30 Strongest Characters In Marvel&#x27;s Coolest Alternate World&quot; list.
* In 2018, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Forge 19th in their &quot;20 Most Powerful Mutants From The &#x27;80s&quot; list.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the Age of Apocalypse reality, Forge was a member of Magneto&#x27;s rebels, the X-Men, and years of combat against Apocalypse&#x27;s empire had left him a cyborg with a mostly-robotic body except for the right half of his face. He left them to go his own way and became the founder and leader of the Outcasts, an anti-Apocalypse resistance cell of mutants disguised as a traveling theater group. The Outcasts&#x27; consisted of Sauron, Toad, Brute, and Mastermind, and later Sonique and Essex, who is rescued by the group from the Infinites during their attack on a train. He became a father figure to Nate Grey, and also his trainer, teaching him how to combat without using his powers. When the Outcasts were attacked by Domino and her henchmen Caliban and Grizzly, Forge attempted to distract them with a Flash Grenade and later in the battle personally killed Grizzly for killing Toad. Forge was eventually killed by Sinister, who had been masquerading as a member of the Outcasts called Essex.

===Age of X===
An alternate version of Forge is present in the &quot;Age of X&quot; reality. He was present when Magneto used New York City skyscrapers to create his so-called &quot;Fortress X&quot;.

===Exiles===
An alternate version of Forge, who appears to be a White American with no apparent Native heritage (but still a cyborg with a robotic right leg, though now also with a robotic right full-arm instead of just a robotic right hand), is drafted onto the interdimensional superhero group the Exiles. Originating from Earth-2814, he was married to his reality&#x27;s Storm. In this reality, the Skrulls succeeded in conquering Earth, but Forge rebuilt and reprogrammed Sentinel City to destroy their command city. He seemingly perished in the explosion, but was instead plucked out of time and put on the Exiles.

===Here Comes Tomorrow===
In the apocalyptic alternate future of &quot;Here Comes Tomorrow&quot;, the final arc of Grant Morrison&#x27;s run of &quot;New X-Men&quot;, a British Mutant under the name Smith had taken Forge&#x27;s alias, the Maker. Though his powers and his relation to Forge, if any, are unknown, he bore some physical resemblance to the former Maker, and also carried numerous mechanical tools.

===House of M===
Forge is seen in &quot;House of M&quot; as a scientist working under Tony Stark, Iron Man. He is one of Stark&#x27;s most trusted employees and is one of the first to learn that he is truly Iron Man. He utilizes his skills in technology and computers by aiding Jarvis and Stark in tracking down the mutant gene bombs that Johnny Storm and Stark are hunting down all over the city.

===Hulk: Future Imperfect===
In the mini-series &quot;Hulk: Future Imperfect&quot;, describing an alternate timeline where the Hulk becomes the Maestro, the Maestro claims that Forge created a weapon specifically designed to kill the Maestro, but that the Maestro killed him before the weapon could be used. The present-day Hulk would later encounter Forge using such a weapon.

===Marvel Zombies===
Forge appears in &quot;Marvel Zombies&quot; alongside Magneto&#x27;s Acolytes as one of few survivors who were hiding on Asteroid M from the hordes of zombie superheroes on Earth. He constructs artificial limbs for the Black Panther after the zombie Giant-Man consumes some of his original ones. Forge becomes close friends with Black Panther, and Forge&#x27;s daughter later marries Black Panther&#x27;s son, and the couple later conceives a child. After the Panther&#x27;s and Forge&#x27;s children die under mysterious circumstances (later revealed that to have been murdered by Malcolm Cortez), both friends become closer through their shared tragedy, and help to raise their grandson together.

During the former heroes&#x27; forty years of absence, Forge anticipates that the zombies would return. Over the decades he and his forces plunder the technological remnants of the world. He makes improvements to Reed Richards&#x27; and Tony Stark&#x27;s technologies for defenses of the colony New Wakanda, such as the Avengers&#x27; force field projector and Iron Man&#x27;s armors. The inter-dimensional transporter is the only technology Forge is unable to rebuild, and it is later revealed that Fabian Cortez&#x27;s son, Malcolm, has sabotaged it by removing some of its key components. Forge dons one of the Iron Man armors when the zombies return. After multiple extensive battles, the surviving zombies and the colonists begin a truce because the returning zombies&#x27; hunger has faded. Cortez ambushes and teleports the zombies to another dimension to seize power within the colony.

===Mutant X===
The version of Forge who appears in the &quot;Mutant X&quot; comic is virtually the same as his mainstream incarnation: he first used his powers to manufacture anti-mutant technology for the government, and later becomes Storm&#x27;s lover. However, because Storm has become a vampire in the Mutant X universe, he allows her to regularly drain blood from him so that she will not have to violate her oath to never take a life.

===Old Man Logan===
As revealed by Old Man Logan, the Earth-21923 Forge was not with the X-Men the night when the villains rose and Mysterio tricked Wolverine into killing his fellow X-Men. Many years later after the villains took over the United States of America and renamed it Amerika, Forge was shown living in a Cheyenne reservation in South Dakota when Rhino led the Rhino Gang into invading. While Forge&#x27;s highly advanced weaponry defeated the Rhino Gang, Forge rode an exo-skeleton which he used to beat Rhino to death. Upon ending up on Earth-616, Old Man Logan told Forge about the fate of his Earth-807128 counterpart. Even though Old Man Logan never visited the Cheyenne Reservation, he was sure that Forge was the one responsible for protecting it from the Rhino Gang.

Old Man Logan&#x27;s return to this Wasteland sees a renewed focus on Forge. He has built a fortress on his land, above and below. When it is attacked by Sabretooth clones, Forge sacrifices his life to detonate his secret weapon, an unstable Old Man Speedball.

===Ronin===
In an alternate reality of &quot;X-Men: Ronin&quot;, the X-Men are superheroes based out of Japan. Forge is a Japanese police officer with an attraction to Storm. He also helps build and pilot an array of robots called &quot;Sentinel Force&quot; which are sent against the X-Men.

===Ultimate Marvel===
The Ultimate Marvel version of Forge has been dramatically re-imagined. He became a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants and follows Magneto with the promise of getting to strike back at humans. This version of Forge is also now of Asian Indian descent, a play upon the mainstream version of the character&#x27;s American Indian heritage.

Magneto ordered Forge to invent a machine that would enhance his abilities to a point where Magneto would be able to kill every human on Earth. It was only at the final stages of his machine that he realized what he was truly doing, and attempted to confront Magneto. Magneto asks Forge if he is hesitating, and Forge hastily assures him no; he is later seen depressed and angry.

In the &#x27;Magnetic North&#x27; storyline it is revealed that he was freed from prison by Mystique. As a pair, they frame Lorna Dane with one of Forge&#x27;s devices. It causes her powers to malfunction, killing dozens of innocent people. Later, Forge does nothing as Mystique snaps the neck of a female police officer and assumes her form. As part of a carefully thought out plan, Forge and Mystique later personally attack the Triskelion; the headquarters for the Ultimates and a supervillain prison. They kill dozens of S.H.I.E.L.D. soldiers during the attack and even more die cleaning up the prison break which results.

He is then taken into custody, but escapes the Triskelion using a phasing device, also helping Wolverine break out as well. Although, according to Nick Fury in &quot;Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk&quot;, he orchestrated the escape for Wolverine to lead him to the Hulk&#x27;s location. He is later tortured and killed in the Savage Land by the Brotherhood.

<text>Robert Keyser Schul (September 28, 1937 ‚Äì June 16, 2024) was an American long-distance runner. , he is the only American to have won an Olympic gold medal in the 5000 m, at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.

==Early career==
Schul, born and raised on a farm in West Milton, Ohio, was born with asthma, which bothered him throughout his career. As told by his brother Larry he started running as a child against his brothers in Indian relays where one would start at the back of the pack and work to get to the front. This would come to be one of the tactics he would later use in his running. He started running for his school in seventh grade and continued through high school (4:34.4 mile). He graduated from Milton-Union High School in 1955. He continued his collegiate career in 1956, at Miami University in Ohio, where he broke the school record in the mile as a sophomore running 4:12.1. He graduated in 1966.

He joined the Air Force as an enlisted airman and for a year had limited training because of Air Force schooling. In May 1960, he was assigned to Oxnard Air Force Base in California and Max Truex (himself a world class distance runner, who placed sixth in the Olympic 10,000 meters that year) became his commanding officer. In June, after one month of good training, Schul ran the USA championships; he placed fifth in his trial race, running 3:55 for 1500 meters. In 1961, Truex introduced Schul to Hungarian coach Mih√°ly Igl√≥i. Under Igl√≥i&#x27;s training, Schul finished third at the national championships in the 3000 m steeplechase. In 1962, he ran well indoors at two miles, with only one American, Jim Beatty, running faster. However, after several poor races that spring, Schul was diagnosed with mononucleosis and spent three months in an Air Force hospital. The next winter, Schul became the US Indoor Champion, running 13:39.3 for three miles. A few weeks later, he ran the third fastest indoor two miles ever (8:37.5), though losing to Beatty&#x27;s world record time of 8:30.7. With a partially torn soleus muscle, Schul placed third in the Pan American Games at 5K, but the injury kept him from competing in the U.S. Championships.

==1964 success==
Returning to Miami University in the fall of 1963, Schul continued using Igl√≥i&#x27;s training methods, with some innovations. The highlights of his 1964 indoor season were a new American record time for three miles, 13:31.4 (then the second fastest indoor time in the world), and two wins over 10,000 meters world record holder Ron Clarke of Australia.

Schul posted an extremely impressive outdoor season in 1964, not losing a single race and beating among others Bruce Kidd, Gerry Lindgren, Billy Mills, Bill Baillie, and Bill Dellinger. Schul first broke the American record in the 5000m at Compton, running 13:38.0. Schul did not run in the NCAA Championships that year, as he thought it unfair for a twenty-six-year-old to be running against younger opponents. He won both the US Championship and the separately held Olympic Trials that year. On August 29, 1964, Schul set a new world record for two miles of 8:26.4, eclipsing the previous mark of 8:29.6 by Michel Jazy of France.

For the first time Track and Field News and Sports Illustrated picked an American to win a distance race, as Schul went to the Games having both the best time in the world in the 5000m and the new two-mile world record. The Olympic final was held in heavy rain. In the last lap, Jazy appeared poised to take the gold, as he had opened up a ten-meter lead on the back stretch; however, Schul ran an impressive 37.8 for the last 300 meters on a muddy track. He caught Jazy 50 meters before the finish line, and pulled away for a clear victory to take the gold medal.

==Injuries and retirement==
After returning home, Schul&#x27;s knee was hurting and he could not run for four months. Using a YMCA pool and stationary bicycle throughout the winter, he resumed running in March 1965.

With only three months of training, Schul won the US Championship again in 1965, this time over three miles again, setting a new American record of 13:10.4. He stated afterward, &quot;it was the toughest race I ran and won.&quot; Schul never managed to regain his 1964 level again, though he did run personal bests over the metric distances of 1500 meters (3:40.7) and 3000 meters (7:59.9) in Europe.

In August 1965, Schul&#x27;s knee began hurting again and he decided to retire. He resumed training in 1967 for fitness purposes and this led him to the 1968 Olympic trials at South Lake Tahoe. With numerous injuries and limited training, he still managed to place fifth in the final. In that final, he had an asthma attack after a few laps and struggled throughout, fainting as he crossed the finish line.

In 1971, for one year, Schul served as the national coach for Malaysia and then moved back to the U.S., re-settling in Ohio. In his spare time he continued to train club athletes. In 1978, the Air Force sent all their top distance runners to Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio to train under Schul. After a year of training, many of the athletes reduced their times enough to compete in National events. Schul himself participated in road races along with his club athletes until the age of sixty, when his right leg and back problems prevented further racing. Along the way, Schul became a top masters runner (33.55 for 10,000 m and 76:00 for half marathon at age fifty; 17:56 for 5,000 m at age 60). In October 2007, Schul had his right hip replaced.

Schul was employed at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, as its men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country and track coaches from 1996 to 2007.

==Death==
Schul died in Middletown, Ohio on June 16, 2024, at the age of 86.

<text>Julius &quot;Jules&quot; Dassin ( ; December 18, 1911 ‚Äì March 31, 2008) was an American film and theatre director, producer, writer and actor. A subject of the Hollywood blacklist, he subsequently moved to France, and later Greece, where he continued his career. He was a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Screen Directors&#x27; Guild.

Dassin received a Best Director Award at the Cannes Film Festival for his film &quot;Du rififi chez les hommes&quot;. He was later nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director and Best Writing, Story and Screenplay ‚Äì Written Directly for the Screen for his film &quot;Never on Sunday&quot;, and was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical for his Broadway production of &quot;Illya Darling&quot;.

== Biography ==
===Early life===
Julius Dassin was born in Middletown, Connecticut, on December 18, 1911, to Bertha () and Samuel Dassin, a barber. His parents were both Jewish immigrants from Odessa, Russian Empire (now Ukraine). Julius had seven siblings, including four brothers, Louis C., Benjamin, Irving and Edward; and three sisters.

In 1915, when Julius was three years old, the Dassin family moved to Harlem, New York. He attended public grammar school where he received his first acting role in a school play. Julius was given a small part but when came time to speak his only line, he fainted due to stage fright. He also learned to play the piano at a young age. During his youth he attended Camp Kinderland, a left-wing Yiddish youth camp.

Julius attended Morris High School in the Bronx. He started acting professionally in 1926, at the age of fourteen, with the Yiddish Art Theatre in New York City. On October 13, 1929, newspaper columnist Mark Hellinger printed a story given to him by Dassin in the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;; nearly twenty years later, the two would work together in Hollywood.

On July 11, 1933, Julius&#x27; older brother Louis was arrested in Meriden, Connecticut when he confessed to the theft of $12,000 from the Puritan Bank and Trust Company, where he worked as a teller and treasurer. On September 10, 1933, when he was 21 years old, Julius married Beatrice Launer, a concert violinist and a graduate of the Juilliard School of Music.

Beginning in 1934, Julius spent three years studying dramatic technique in Europe. He spent time in Italy, France, Spain, Germany, Russia, England, Czechoslovakia, Portugal, Switzerland and Greece, working odd jobs to sustain himself.

=== New York theatre and radio career ===
After returning from Europe in 1936, Dassin joined the Children&#x27;s Theatre, a division of the Federal Theatre Project during the Great Depression. It was during this time that he joined the Communist Party USA (CPUSA). The troupe put on children&#x27;s plays at the Adelphi Theatre in New York City. During this time, he played the role of Zar in &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot; in September 1936, and the role of Oakleaf in &quot;Revolt of the Beavers&quot;, which ran from May 20, 1937, to June 19, 1937. The later play was criticized as strongly communist.

He later joined up with the Artef Players, a Yiddish Proletarian Theater company in 1937, serving as an actor, set designer, set builder, stage director and even ticket salesman. Beginning on October 5, 1937, he appeared in Moyshe Kulbak&#x27;s play &quot;The Outlaw&quot;, which had been adapted by Chaver Paver at The Artef Theatre He also appeared in Artef Players&#x27; &quot;Recruits&quot; and &quot;200,000&quot;. On November 5, 1938, Dassin&#x27;s wife Beatrice gave birth to their first child, son Joseph. In October 1939, he acted in Chaver Paver&#x27;s &quot;Clinton Street&quot;, which was staged at the Mercury Theatre, after Orson Welles&#x27; troupe had left for Hollywood and the Radio-Keith-Orpheum circuit. Since the pay was poor with Artef Players, Dassin formed a theatre troupe to tour the Borscht Circuit in the Catskills as summer stock.

Dassin acted in a movie scripted and directed by Jack Skurnick, which was shown to a small group at a space that Skurnick rented in New York but was never exhibited beyond that.

He then wrote sketches for radio, at times directing his own radio plays, and became a stage director and producer. In April 1939, Dassin adapted Nicolai Gogol&#x27;s story &quot;The Overcoat&quot; for the CBS variety program &quot;The Kate Smith Hour&quot;, which starred Burgess Meredith and was broadcast live on April 20, 1939. In early 1940, Dassin staged and directed the play &quot;Medicine Show&quot; for producer Martin Gabel, starring Isabel Bonner, Philip Bourneuf and Norman Lloyd. Although it was well received by critics, &quot;Medicine Show&quot; only ran for 35 performances at the New Yorker Theatre, from April 12, 1940, to May 11, 1940.

===Working in Hollywood===

==== RKO Radio Pictures (1940) ====
In June 1940, Dassin was signed to a term contract with Hollywood film studio RKO Radio Pictures as a director. He was immediately assigned as an assistant director to learn the motion picture business, working under Garson Kanin on &quot;They Knew What They Wanted&quot; (1940) and Alfred Hitchcock on &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Smith&quot; (1941), both starring Carole Lombard and both under the supervision of producer Harry E. Edington. During the filming of &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Smith&quot;, Dassin&#x27;s wife Beatrice gave birth to their second child, daughter Richelle. By January 1941, after six months without a proper directorial job, Dassin was released from his RKO Radio Pictures contract.

Dassin returned to radio work in Hollywood, presenting his previously adapted Gogol story &quot;The Overcoat&quot; for a repeat performance on &quot;The Kate Smith Hour&quot;, this time starring Henry Hull, which was broadcast live on January 3, 1941. He was also one of the several actors who formed the Actors&#x27; Laboratory Theatre.

==== Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and loan-out to Eagle-Lion Films (1941‚Äì1946) ====
Wanting to prove that he could direct motion pictures, Dassin approached Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in the spring of 1941 offering his services for free. He told the studio that he would direct any film for free; the studio instead offered to pay him to direct a short film. Dassin made his directorial debut with a short film of Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot;. Filmed in June 1941 and released on October 25, 1941, the success of the picture led to his hasty promotion as a feature film director and the signing of an exclusive five-year contract in early November 1941. Dassin was promoted from the short story department to the feature film department by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer at the same time as Fred Zinnemann and Fred Wilcox.

His feature film debut at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was the low-budget spy thriller &quot;Nazi Agent&quot; (originally announced under the titles &quot;Salute to Courage&quot;, &quot;House of Spies&quot; and &quot;Out of the Past&quot;), under the supervision of producer Irving Asher and starring Conrad Veidt, in the dual roles of twin brothers, and Ann Ayars. Released in early 1942, the film received immediate critical acclaim and was a box office success, with Dassin being compared to Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock.

Dassin followed with the romantic comedy &quot;The Affairs of Martha&quot; (originally announced under the title &quot;Once Upon a Thursday&quot;), starring Marsha Hunt and Richard Carlson, and under the supervision of producer Irving Starr. The film was made in early 1942 on a limited budget. When released in mid-1942, the film was a moderate success and again Dassin was highlighted in the reviews.

In mid-February 1942, it was reported that Dassin would direct a film titled &quot;Men at Sea&quot; from a Marine Corps story by Alma Rivkin (possibly a typo for Allen Rivkin) starring Philip Dorn. The film was presumably abandoned. In April 1942, it was reported that Dassin would be one of eight directors, along with Fred Zinenmann, Fred Wilcox, Charles Lederer, Edward Cahn, Joseph M. Newman and David Miller, to film a sequence for a planned patriotic anthology film at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer titled &quot;Now We Are 21&quot;. The film was to be produced by B. F. Zeidman and scripted by Peter Ruric from a story by Jerry Schwartz. Actors such as Gene Kelly, Ray McDonald, Virginia O&#x27;Brien, James Warren, Tatricia Dane, Johnny Davis and Barry Wilson were to appear in the film, but it was never made.

Joan Crawford, one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s biggest stars at the time, watched a private screening of &quot;Nazi Agent&quot;, after which she rushed to Louis B. Mayer&#x27;s office insisting that Dassin direct her upcoming World War II drama vehicle, &quot;Reunion in France&quot; (originally announced simply as &quot;Reunion&quot;). The picture was being produced by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and was to co-star Philip Dorn and John Wayne&quot;.&quot; Crawford also requested that Ann Ayars, who co-starred in &quot;Nazi Agent&quot;, be given the second female lead in her film. Dassin was notified of this new assignment on May 19, 1942, and the press reported that he had been promoted to become an &quot;A movie&quot; director.&quot;&quot; On the first day of shooting, Dassin yelled &quot;cut&quot; while Crawford was performing, which deeply upset the actress and led her to rush into Mayer&#x27;s office. Dassin was called into Mayer&#x27;s office and told that his career as a film director was over. To his surprise, Crawford invited the young director to have dinner at her house later that night and the two became dear friends; the next day, Dassin resumed his directorial duty on the film. The film opened to theatres in December 1942 but received mixed opinions from critics who found its pace too slow.

After completing &quot;Reunion in France&quot;, it was reported that Dassin received a leave of absence from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to act in a stage production of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot; on Broadway. The play was to be directed by and starring John Carradine, though it is unknown if this production came through. Dassin was also employed by Frank Tuttle as one of the lecturers for Hollywood School for Writers&#x27; new film directing class, along with Fred Zinnemann, Irving Pichel and L√°szl√≥ Benedek.

In mid-November 1942, he was assigned to direct another romantic comedy, &quot;Young Ideas&quot; (originally announced as &quot;Faculty Row&quot;), under the supervision of producer Robert Sisk. The film was shot from mid-December 1942 to early 1943 and starred Susan Peters, Herbert Marshall and Mary Astor. The film was released in the summer of 1943 and received favorable reviews as a light comedy. In March 1943, Dassin joined the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

In September 1943, after several months without a project, Dassin took over the directorial duties on a comedy film adaptation of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Canterville Ghost&quot;. Original director Norman Z. McLeod had departed after five weeks of shooting, following a clash with producer Arthur Field and the cast, which included Charles Laughton, Robert Young and Margaret O&#x27;Brien. The film finished shooting in December 1943 and was released in the summer of 1944. Between the filming of scenes, Laughton often asked Dassin to play Russian classical songs on the piano, of which both were fond. &quot;The Canterville Ghost&quot; was very well received by critics and won a Retro Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation in 2020.

In January 1944, producer Edwin H. Knopf selected Dassin to direct the suspense drama &quot;Secrets in the Dark&quot; (originally announced as &quot;Strangers in the Dark&quot; and &quot;The Outward Room&quot;). The motion picture was based on Millen Brand&#x27;s novel &quot;The Outward Room&quot; and from the existing play version &quot;The World We Make&quot;, which had been adapted by Sidney Kingsley. The plot was that of a middle-class girl who escapes from an insane asylum and develops a love affair with a blue collar steel worker, and in turn overcomes her phobias. The property was developed as a starring vehicle for Susan Peters, newly promoted Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer starlet. Gene Kelly was first cast as the male lead in January 1944, though he was replaced by Robert Young in February 1944. Other cast members included Fortunio Bononova, Katharine Balfour, Felix Bressart, Alexander Granach, Peggy Maley, Marta Linden, Morris Ankrum, Sharon McManus and Betty Lawler.

&quot;Secrets in the Dark&quot; was to start shooting on February 20, 1944, with cinematographer Robert Planck, but was pushed back to early March 1944 due to production delays. On April 1, 1944, Peters was admitted into Santa Monica Hospital for abdominal pain and underwent major surgery. Her recovery took several months, postponing the films&#x27; production indefinitely. Reports varied as to how much footage was shot; some reported as little as ten-day of filming, while others stated that the film was nearly completed. By the time that Peters had recovered in the summer of 1944, Dassin was on a voluntary leave from the studio, so Peters was instead assigned to &quot;Keep Your Powder Dry&quot; (originally announced as &quot;Women in Uniform&quot;) for director Edward Buzzell. When Dassin finally returned to work for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in mid-1945, Peters had undergone another series of surgeries (due to an accidental shotgun discharge on January 1, 1945), which put her in a wheelchair. Peter&#x27;s character in &quot;Secrets in the Dark&quot; was to be rewritten as a paraplegic, but the film was instead permanently shelved.

When &quot;Secrets in the Dark&quot; was first postponed in early April 1944, Dassin started acting in night plays at the Actors&#x27; Laboratory Theatre as part of the War Charities benefits. The first play in which he acted was &quot;Night Lodging&quot;, followed by &quot;The Lower Depths&quot;. In May 1944, Dassin teamed up with Arthur Lubin to set up the Soldier Shows Stock Company, a project to put on plays featuring wounded war veterans at Torney General Hospital in Palm Springs, California.

In June 1944, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer announced that Dassin had been assigned to direct the company&#x27;s 20th Anniversary film, &quot;Some of the Best&quot;. The five-reel picture was to include excerpts from prior Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films, spanning 1924‚Äì1943, along with wrap-around pieces starring Lewis Stone. Dassin, however, became weary of his directorial duties at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and asked Louis B. Mayer to be released from his exclusive contract. Mayer sternly refused, even after Dassin offered to sign a promissory document that he would never work for a rival Hollywood studio. In a later interview conducted in December 1946, Dassin revealed that he was ashamed of some of the directorial duties he was forced to accept while at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Dassin had hoped to return to work on the New York stage but instead took a thirteen-month voluntary hiatus from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, filling his time by reading books on the beach and working on local plays. On July 30, 1944, Dassin&#x27;s wife Beatrice gave birth to their third child, daughter Julie.

In November 1944, actor Ralph Bellamy approached Dassin to direct &quot;The Democrats&quot;, a play he was producing on Broadway. &quot;The Democrats&quot; was written by Melvin Levy and was so co-star Frances Dee. Although the production received good publicity throughout the month of November 1944, it would appear that it never came to fruition, perhaps because Dassin was unable to receive a leave of absence from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

In December 1944, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer assigned Dassin to direct the crime-mystery film &quot;Dangerous Partners&quot; (originally announced as &quot;Paper Chase&quot;) for producer Arthur Field. Dassin took over the directorial duties from Fred Zinnemann (who was then suspended from Metro-Goldywn-Mayer for refusing to finish the picture), and had anticipated casting Susan Peters in the lead. But when Peters suffered a gun shot wound accident on January 1, 1945, Dassin pulled out of the project. Director Edward Cahn was ultimately hired for the job and recast the female lead role with Signe Hasso, successfully completing the picture.

Returning to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in May 1945, after thirteen months away from cameras, Dassin was assigned to direct the romantic comedy film &quot;A Letter for Evie&quot; for producer William H. Wright. The picture began shooting in early June 1945 and included Marsha Hunt, Hume Cronyn, John Carroll, Norman Lloyd and Pamela Britton. &quot;A Letter for Evie&quot; briefly changed title to &quot;All the Things You Are&quot; in late 1945, but its original title was restored in time for release in November 1945.

It was announced that once Dassin completed the shooting of &quot;A Letter for Evie&quot;, he would fly to Europe to direct a series of plays sponsored by the Actors&#x27; Laboratory Theatre. The plays were to star soldiers as part of war-time moral-building entertainment. Again, he was denied a leave of absence from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and in early August 1945 was assigned to direct the romantic comedy thriller (with strong film noir tones), &quot;Two Smart People&quot; (originally announced as &quot;Time for Two&quot;) for producer Ralph Wheelwright. The picture began filming in September 1945 and starred Lucille Ball, John Hodiak and Lloyd Nolan, and was released in late 1946. Following &quot;Two Smart People&quot;, Dassin would spend more than a year without successfully shooting another film.

In March 1946, Dassin and Joseph Losey co-directed Viola Brothers Shore&#x27;s stage play &quot;Birthday&quot; for the Actors&#x27; Laboratory Theatre. The production, which unfolds a narrative of a girl&#x27;s 18th birthday, was staged at the Phoenix Theater starring actress Karen Morley. The cast also included Howard Duff, Jocelyn Brando and Don Hanmer. In August 1946, it was reported that Dassin had been signed to direct the film noir &quot;Repeat Performance&quot; for Eagle-Lion Films, through a loan-out arrangement with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The picture was to be made under the supervision of writer-producer Marion Parsonnet and set to star Franchot Tone, Sylvia Sidney, Constance Dowling and Tom Conway. Unfortunately, disagreements about the budget and script caused the whole production to fall apart and the entire cast and crew resigned. The picture was eventually made with a completely new team a year later. Dassin was finally released from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer once his exclusive five-year contract expired in November 1946.

==== Mark Hellinger Productions and Universal-International Pictures (1946‚Äì1948) ====
As soon as the news hit that Dassin was free from contractual obligations with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, writer-turned-producer Mark Hellinger scooped up the director, signing him to a non-exclusive three-picture freelance contract with his film production company, Mark Hellinger Productions. The contract gave Dassin the freedom to choose his own three projects to direct at Mark Hellinger Productions, without an expiry date. The producer had an existing financing and distribution deal with Universal-International Pictures, where Dassin was set to direct one of Hollywood&#x27;s biggest new stars, Burt Lancaster, in a violent prison film noir, &quot;Brute Force.&quot;&quot;&quot;

With new freedom, and support from executive producer Hellinger and associate producer Jules Buck, Dassin announced that he would shoot the picture using realism and a documentary-style. He also employed a total of thirteen actors with whom he had worked at the Actors&#x27; Laboratory Theatre, including Hume Cronyn, Howard Duff, Roman Bohnen, Whit Bissell, Art Smith, Jeff Corey, Sam Levene, Charles McGraw, Will Lee, Ray Teal, Crane Whitley, Kenneth Patterson and James O&#x27;Rear. The cast also included noted Hollywood actors Charles Bickford, Yvonne De Carlo, Ann Blyth, Ella Raines and Anita Colby. &quot;Brute Force&quot; was shot from March to April 1947 on the Universal-International Pictures lot, with reshoots taking place in early May 1947 to appease objections from the Motion Picture Association of America, shortly before a preview audience. The film, which featured a score composed and conducted by Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa, was released to theatres in July 1947 through Universal-International Pictures; that same month, Cosmopolitan magazine awarded Dassin with the Movie Citations of the Month Award for Best Director. Less than a year after its release, Dassin revealed that he did not like the film.

In early May 1947, Dassin was announced as the director of Hellinger&#x27;s next production, &quot;The Naked City&quot; (originally announced as &quot;Homicide&quot;) Dassin planned to push the realism and documentary-style filming technique of the police story flic further by shooting it entirely on location in New York City. The production received full cooperation from New York City&#x27;s Homicide Squad during its two and a half months of location shooting, from June to August 1947. 107 different locations were shot in New York City, and to distract the crowd and keep them looking natural, Dassin hired a juggler to draw their attention away from the cameras.

Dassin, Hellinger and associate producer Buck worked with several of the same cast and crew members from &quot;Brute Force&quot; on &quot;The Naked City&quot;, including actors Howard Duff, Ralph Brooks and Chuck Hamilton, assistant director Fred Frank, cinematographer William H. Daniels, art director John F. DeCuir, set decorator Russell A. Gausman and composer Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa. The film also starred Barry Fitzgerald, Don Taylor and Dorothy Hart. After overseeing the editing of the film in Hollywood during September and October 1947, Dassin flew back to New York City in early November 1947 to work on the pre-production of the stage play &quot;Strange Bedfellows&quot;. Unbeknownst to Dassin, Hellinger and Buck wound up re-cutting the film in his absence; the director only finding out at the film&#x27;s premiere on March 3, 1948, when he saw a highly edited version of his film projected on the screen. Furthermore, Hellinger died suddenly on December 21, 1947, months before the film was premiered and released to theatres by Universal-International Pictures.

Although Dassin was unhappy about the final cut of &quot;The Naked City&quot;, the film was a huge success (one of the top movies of 1948), and it was nominated for and won several accolades, including Academy Awards for Best Film Editing and Best Cinematography, Black-and-White, an Academy Award nomination for Best Writing, Motion Picture Story; a British Academy of Film and Television Arts nomination for Best Film from any Source; and Writers Guild of America Award nominations for Best Written American Drama and The Robert Meltzer Award. In 2007, the film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States National Film Preservation Board and was selected for preservation in the Library of Congress&#x27; National Film Registry.

Dassin&#x27;s third and final film under his Mark Hellinger Productions contract was up in limbo following Hellinger&#x27;s death. The film production unit had undergone considerable changes in the months prior to Hellinger&#x27;s passing, including the addition of Humphrey Bogart as vice-president, and the signing of a six-picture financing and distribution deal with David O. Selznick&#x27;s Selznick Releasing Organization. Mark Hellinger Productions owned the filming rights to several Ernest Hemingway stories, Forest Rosaire&#x27;s novel &quot;East of Midnight&quot;, Arthur Cohn&#x27;s screenplay &quot;Disbarred&quot;, Gordon Macker&#x27;s screenplay &quot;Race Track&quot;, Philip G. Epstein&#x27;s screenplay &quot;Mistakes Will Happen&quot;, and Jerry D. Lewis&#x27; screenplay &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle&quot;; in addition to three films in development: &quot;Knock on Any Door&quot;, &quot;Criss Cross&quot; and &quot;Act of Violence&quot;. Any of these properties may have been picked for Dassin to direct in 1948. The company also held contracts with actors Bogart, Burt Lancaster, Don Taylor and Howard Duff, and with cinematographer William Daniels.

Bogart, Selznick and secretary-treasurer A. Morgan Marie announced their plan to continue Mark Hellinger Productions in January 1948, by co-heading the company and honoring the late producers&#x27; namesake with the previously planned films in development. However, difficulty lay in finding a new executive producer to head the production; Jerry Wald was first approached but was unable to free himself from his Warner Bros. contract. Robert Lord was then offered the post and freed himself from his Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer contract to accept the new position. Unfortunately, Hellinger&#x27;s widow, former actress Gladys Glad Hellinger, decided to liquidate the company and all of its assets in early February 1948. The story properties and actor, director and cinematographer contracts were sold to other studios via the William Morris Agency. This lead Bogart, Lord and Marie to form their own film production company, Santana Productions, and secure a financing and distribution deal with Columbia Pictures with some of the properties they managed to purchase. It is unknown which, or if a studio bought out Dassin&#x27;s remaining one-picture deal, though news reports hinted towards Universal-International Pictures or Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

In late December 1947, before Bogart, Selznick and Marie had decided upon continuing the Mark Hellinger Productions firm, Dassin took the opportunity of his non-exclusive contract to partner with stage actor and producer Luther Adler in an independent film venture. Adler had recently purchased Jack Iams&#x27; novel &quot;Prophet by Experience&quot; in September 1947 and hired Ben Hecht to adapt it and write the screenplay. The story dealt with a hermit who is taken out of seclusion by a magazine writer, and who has a unique set of experiences in the outside world. Adler, who was solely to act as producer in his new film production company, approached Dassin to direct the picture and negotiations were underway for a financing and distribution deal with Columbia Pictures. For reasons unknown, the film was never made.

While still in New York City, Dassin was hired by producers John Houseman and William R. Katzell to direct Allan Scott&#x27;s play &quot;Joy to the World&quot;; a comedy about a ruthless Hollywood producer. The play began rehearsals on January 26, 1948, and opened on Broadway at the Plymouth Theatre on March 18, 1948. It would run for 124 performances, until July 3, 1948. The cast included Alfred Drake, Marsha Hunt, Morris Carnovsky, Mary Welch, Lois Hall, Peggy Maley, Myron McCormick, Clay Clement, Bert Freed, Kurt Kasznar and Theodore Newton.

==== 20th Century-Fox Film and the blacklist years (1948‚Äì1953) ====
In February 1948, Dassin was approached by theatre producer Mike Todd who was preparing to venture into the film producing business. Todd planned to make a series of low-budget, $500,000 pictures and had secured a financing and distribution deal with 20th Century-Fox Film. The first picture in Todd&#x27;s new deal was &quot;Busman&#x27;s Holiday&quot;, an original story based on newspaper accounts of a Bronx bus driver who took off for Florida with his family using his company&#x27;s bus. Todd cast Joan Blondell as one of the leads and planned to shoot the entire picture using real locations, from New York City to Florida. Impressed by the success and filming style of &quot;The Naked City&quot;, Todd approached Dassin to direct &quot;Busman&#x27;s Holiday&quot;. Although the picture was ultimately never made, Dassin had become an increasingly sought-after director. 

On April 3, 1948, he returned to Hollywood to meet with executives from three different studios: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 20th Century-Fox Film and Columbia Pictures, each of which had offered him a contract. Dassin connected best with Darryl F. Zanuck and opted to sign with 20th Century-Fox Film. In addition to &quot;Busman&#x27;s Holiday&quot;, he was tied to two other film projects in the spring of 1948, both involving actress Paulette Goddard at 20th Century-Fox. The first was to be a film adaptation of Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s latest novel and recently opened Broadway hit &quot;The Respectful Prostitute&quot;, for which Goddard and actor Burgess Meredith had negotiated the screen rights, hoping to play the leads. Dassin, who had promised to direct, was the only director Goddard wanted.

By June 1948, Dassin was set to direct &quot;Anna Lucasta&quot; at Columbia Pictures, a play written by Philip Yordan about a young prostitute whose family tries to use her to steal money from a potential husband. Goddard was scheduled to play the lead in the film and reportedly insisted that Dassin be hired to direct. During negotiations with 20th Century-Fox, Zanuck considered loaning Linda Darnell to Columbia Pictures as part of a package deal, but things fell through. Irving Rapper ultimately directed the film at Columbia Pictures.

During the summer of 1948, Dassin directed &quot;Magdalena&quot; on Broadway, a play produced by Edwin Lester, which ran for 88 performances from September 20, 1948, to December 4, 1948. By the time that &quot;Magdalena&quot; closed, Dassin was already back in Hollywood, having signed a contract with Zanuck at 20th Century-Fox. Dassin&#x27;s inaugural project for the studio was &quot;Thieves&#x27; Highway&quot; (originally announced as &quot;Thieves&#x27; Market&quot; and &quot;Hard Bargain&quot;), starring Richard Conte, Lee J. Cobb and Valentina Cortese. In November 1949, the film won the Photoplay Award for Best Picture of the Month.

Contrary to an often-cited 1958 &quot;Time&quot; magazine article, Dassin was not blacklisted because of a single denunciation from a particular witness at a congressional hearing. Instead, his name had been mentioned a number of times, at various hearings of the United States House of Representatives House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), and by different witnesses, some as early as 1947. He was also linked to several Communist-front organizations.

On October 22, 1947, while Dassin was still working on &quot;The Naked City&quot;, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) chief supervisor and executive producer James Kevin McGuinness testified before the HUAC. He described an incident at MGM in 1941, shortly after Dassin had joined the studio, when an attempt was made to halt the production of &quot;Tennessee Johnson&quot;, a biographical picture about the life of former U.S. President Andrew Johnson. McGuinness explained that after the death of the original producer of the picture, J. Walter Ruben, he took over the production as part of his executive function. He was then presented with a petition, signed by Dassin, Ring Lardner Jr., Donald Ogden Stewart, Hy S. Kraft and Richard Collins, which was addressed to MGM executive vice-president Al Lichtman, demanding that the picture be aborted for political reasons. All five signees were known Communists. The news hit the media quickly.

In 1948 and 1949, Dassin&#x27;s name was connected with at least three Communist-front organizations. First, he was an executive board member of the Actors&#x27; Laboratory Theatre. The Committee did not assert that the Actors&#x27; Lab was Communist, but rather that its board of directors was made up almost exclusively of CPUSA members or Communist sympathizers, including Dassin. Second, he had been a member of the Artists&#x27; Front to Win the War‚Äîa gathering on October 16, 1942 that the HUAC cited as subversive. Third, Dassin was a sponsor of the National Council of the Arts, Sciences and Professions&#x27; Scientific and Cultural Conference for World Peace, held from March 25‚Äì27, 1949, which the HUAC also cited as subversive.

In the late spring of 1949, Zanuck called Dassin into his office to warn him that he was on the verge of being blacklisted, but that he still had enough time to make one more movie for 20th Century-Fox. Zanuck gave Dassin a copy of Gerald Kersh&#x27;s novel &quot;Night and the City&quot; and rushed him to England to make the film unhindered by the HUAC hearings. &quot;Night and the City&quot;, later released in mid-1950, was filmed entirely on location in London between July and October 1949 and starred Richard Widmark, Gene Tierney, Googie Withers, Hugh Marlowe and Mike Mazurki. Dassin was already unofficially blacklisted during the production of &quot;Night and the City&quot; and was not allowed back on the studio property to edit the film nor oversee the musical scoring.

Nevertheless, Zanuck and producer Julian Blaustein hired Dassin to direct one more 20th Century-Fox Film, &quot;Half Angel&quot;, a Technicolor comedy starring Loretta Young, and scheduled to begin shooting in mid-June 1950. However, after political pressure from Hollywood and Washington, D.C., Dassin was replaced by Richard Sale.

On April 25, 1951, film director Edward Dmytryk, one of the &quot;Hollywood Ten&quot; who had been blacklisted in 1947 for refusing to answer questions from the HUAC, had a change of heart and decided to cooperate with the Committee and &quot;name names&quot;. In his revised testimony, Dmytryk revealed that the Screen Directors&#x27; Guild included seven known Communists. It was one of the first times the HUAC heard of film directors being Communists; up till then, the Committee had concentrated on left-wing writers in the Screen Writers&#x27; Guild. Dassin was named as one of the seven directors‚Äîalong with Frank Tuttle, Herbert Biberman, John Berry, Bernard Vorhaus and Dmytryk himself‚Äîwho had attended a Communist meeting at Berry&#x27;s house for the purpose of electing themselves to the guild&#x27;s board of directors. Dmytryk explained that, at the time, the Communist Party wanted to get as many people as it could on the board of directors of the Screen Writers&#x27; Guild, Screen Actors&#x27; Guild, and Screen Directors&#x27; Guild in order to eventually control the policy of those guilds, particularly in relation to forging a coalition of the various unions.

On May 24, 1951, Frank Tuttle also gave cooperative testimony to the HUAC. He said that during the 1930s and 1940s, a group of seven Communists existed within the Screen Directors&#x27; Guild. Dassin was again named as one of those seven Communists, along with Herbert Biberman, Edward Dmytryk, Bernard Vorhaus, John Berry, Michael Gordon and Tuttle himself. Tuttle explained that the CPUSA&#x27;s goal was to elect its representatives to the board of directors of the Screen Directors&#x27; Guild, but that only he, Dmytryk and Biberman had succeeded in being appointed to executive positions, with the help of votes from the seven Communists in the guild.

Dassin&#x27;s name was further mentioned during HUAC hearings for actor Jos√© Ferrer on May 25, 1951, and film director Michael Gordon on September 17, 1951. From that point on, Dassin was officially identified as a past or present CPUSA member.

In 1952, after Dassin had been out of work for two years, actress Bette Davis hired him to direct her in the Broadway revue &quot;Two&#x27;s Company&quot;. The show ran for 90 performances, closing on March 8, 1953, due to Davis&#x27; poor health. Dassin was then offered a job in France to direct a film. He accepted the offer and left the U.S. for good, never having to appear before the HUAC.

=== Working in Europe ===

==== France ====

In March 1953, Dassin was hired by French producer Jacques Bar to direct the comedy-crime film &quot;The Most Wanted Man&quot;, starring Fernandel and Zsa Zsa Gabor in a spoof of American gangster films. Dassin maintains that two days before the film was to begin shooting, Bar yielded to pressure from a powerful U.S. politician not to work with Dassin, receiving threats that the film, and any future Bar productions, would not be granted American distribution. In an HUAC hearing on July 12, 1956, Allied Artists Pictures Corporation manager of branch operations Roy M. Brewer stated that a worrisome Gabor phoned him from France after hearing rumors that Dassin had been identified as a Communist. The next day, Brewer received a telegram from American Federation of Labor&#x27;s European representative Irving Brown, also questioning Dassin&#x27;s political views. Brewer further stated that at no point did he recommend the dismissal of Dassin as director, but that he merely reported the facts to the inquirers, which was that Dassin had been identified as a Communist. &quot;The Most Wanted Man&quot; was ultimately directed by Henri Verneuil (a frequent collaborator of Fernandel), who went on to become a noted neo-noir director. Dassin later stated that he had further difficulty finding work in Europe as American film distribution companies forbade the exhibition of any film, regardless of its origin, associated with artists blacklisted in Hollywood. He later admitted that he worked as an uncredited writer on a number of scripts that were sent back to Hollywood through Zanuck.

Dassin did not work as a film director again until &quot;Rififi&quot; in 1955 (a French production), his most influential film and an early work in the &quot;heist film&quot; genre. He won the Best Director award for the film at the 1955 Cannes Film Festival. It inspired later heist films, such as &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot; (1960). Another film it inspired was Dassin&#x27;s own heist film &quot;Topkapi&quot; (1964), filmed in France and Istanbul, Turkey with his future second wife, Melina Mercouri and Oscar winner Peter Ustinov.

Most of Dassin&#x27;s films in the decades following the blacklist are European productions. His later career in Europe and the affiliation with Greece through his second wife, combined with the Frenchified pronunciation of his surname in Europe (as &quot;Da-SAn&quot; instead of the common American &quot;DASS-ine&quot;) led to a common misconception that he was a native European director.

====Melina Mercouri====
At the Cannes Film Festival in May 1955 he met Melina Mercouri, Greek actress and wife of Panos Harokopos. At about the same time, he discovered the literary works of Nikos Kazantzakis; these two elements created a bond with Greece. Dassin next made &quot;He Who Must Die&quot; (1957) based on Kazantzakis&#x27; &quot;Christ Recrucified&quot; and in which Mercouri appeared. She went on to star in his &quot;Never on Sunday&quot; (1960) for which she won best actress at the Cannes Film Festival. She then starred in his next three films ‚Äì &quot;Phaedra&quot; (1962), &quot;Topkapi&quot; (1964) and &quot;10:30 P.M. Summer&quot; (1966).

He divorced his first wife, Beatrice Launer, in 1962 and married Mercouri in 1966. She later starred in his &quot;Promise at Dawn&quot; (1970)‚Äîduring the filming of which, Dassin broke both his legs‚Äîand later &quot;A Dream of Passion&quot; (1978).

====Affiliation with Greece====
Dassin was considered a major Philhellene to the point of Greek officials describing him as a &quot;first generation Greek&quot;. Along with Mercouri, he opposed the Greek military junta.

The couple had to leave Greece after the colonels&#x27; coup in 1967. In 1970 they were accused of having financed an attempt to overthrow the dictatorship, but the charges were quickly dropped. Dassin and Mercouri lived in New York City during the 1970s; then, when the military dictatorship in Greece fell in 1974, they returned to Greece and lived out their lives there. In 1974 he and Mercouri made &quot;The Rehearsal&quot; about the junta.

While Mercouri became involved with politics and won a parliamentary seat, Dassin stayed with movie-making in Europe. In 1982 he was a member of the jury at the 34th Berlin International Film Festival.

==Personal life==
=== Marriages ===
Dassin married twice. Before his marriage to Melina Mercouri, he married Beatrice Launer in 1933; she was a New-York‚Äìborn, Jewish‚ÄìAmerican concert violinist (aka Beatrice Launer-Dassin; 1913‚Äì1994), a graduate of the Juilliard School of Music. They divorced in 1962. Their children were Joseph Ira Dassin, better known as Joe Dassin (1938‚Äì80), a popular French singer in the 1970s; songwriter Richelle &quot;Rickie&quot; Dassin (born 1940); and actress‚Äìsinger Julie Dassin (born 1944; also known as Julie D.).

=== Death ===
Dassin died from complications of influenza at the age of 96; he was survived by his two daughters and his grandchildren. Upon his death, the Greek prime minister Costas Karamanlis released a statement: &quot;Greece mourns the loss of a rare human being, a significant artist and true friend. His passion, his relentless creative energy, his fighting spirit and his nobility will remain unforgettable.&quot;

A major supporter of the return of the Parthenon Marbles to Athens, for which he established the Melina Mercouri Institution in her memory after her death in 1994, he died a few months before the opening ceremony of the New Acropolis Museum.

==Preservation==
The Academy Film Archive has preserved Jules Dassin&#x27;s film &quot;Night and the City&quot;, including the British and pre-release versions.

In 2000, Rialto Pictures restored and released &quot;Rififi&quot; theatrically. It was subsequently released on home video through The Criterion Collection and Arrow Films.

<text>Martin Johannes Walser (; 24 March 1927 ‚Äì 26 July 2023) was a German writer, known especially as a novelist. He began his career as journalist for &quot;S√ºddeutscher Rundfunk&quot;, where he wrote and directed audio plays. He was a member of Group 47 from 1953 on.
His first novel, &quot;Marriage in Philippsburg&quot;, a satirical portrait of postwar society, became a success in 1957. Walser then turned to freelance writing. He published a trilogy of novels about the character Anselm Kristlein, beginning with &quot;Halbzeit&quot; in 1960, &quot;Das Einhorn&quot; (&quot;The Unicorn&quot;) in 1966 and ending with &quot;Der Sturz&quot; (&quot;The Fall&quot;) in 1973. Most of his major works have been translated into English, including the 1978 novella &quot;Runaway Horse&quot;, which was successful with both readers and critics. He also wrote plays (&quot;Die Zimmerschlacht&quot;), screenplays, story collections and essays. Several of his books have been adapted to the screen, including &quot;Runaway Horse&quot; in 1986 and again in 2007.

Walser received many awards, including the Georg B√ºchner Prize in 1981 and the Peace Prize of the German Publishers&#x27; Association in 1998. His acceptance speech for the Peace Prize caused controversy with Walser&#x27;s remarks on German commemoration of the Holocaust. The &quot;monumentalization of shame&quot;, he said, risks turning remembrance of the Holocaust into a &quot;lip service&quot; ritual. In 2002, Walser&#x27;s portrayal of the literary critic Marcel Reich-Ranicki in his novel &quot;&quot; (&quot;Death of a Critic&quot;) was regarded as anti-Semitic.

Walser is regarded, along with Heinrich B√∂ll, G√ºnter Grass, and Siegfried Lenz, as one of Germany&#x27;s most influential postwar authors.

== Early life and education ==

Walser was born on 24 March 1927 in Wasserburg, on Lake Constance. His parents were coal merchants who also kept an inn next to the train station in Wasserburg. The second of three children, Walser lost his father at age ten. He described the environment in which he grew up in his novel &quot;A Gushing Fountain&quot;. From 1938 to 1943 he attended the secondary school in Lindau, until his induction to the armed forces, initially as an auxiliary. According to documents released in June 2007, he became a member of the Nazi Party on 20 April 1944 at age 17. Walser denied that he knowingly entered the party, and assumed that he was enrolled by a garrison commander as part of a larger group without his knowledge. The claim was disputed by Hans-Dieter Kreikamp from the German Federal Archives, who said that a personal signature was formally required, even in times of war. By the end of the Second World War, Walser was a soldier in the Wehrmacht.

After the war, he completed his in Lindau in 1946. He then studied literature, history, and philosophy at the University of Regensburg and the University of T√ºbingen, achieving his doctorate in literature in 1951 with a thesis on Franz Kafka.

== Career ==
While studying, Walser worked as a reporter for the &quot;S√ºddeutscher Rundfunk&quot; broadcasting company, and wrote and directed his first audio plays. He travelled to Czechoslovakia, England, France, Italy, and Poland as part of his job. In 1950 Walser married Katharina &quot;K√§the&quot; Neuner-Jehle; the couple had four daughters.

Beginning in 1953, Walser was regularly invited to conferences of the Group 47, which was focused on literature for a new democratic Germany. The group awarded him a prize for his story &quot;Templones Ende&quot; in 1955. His first novel, &quot;Marriage in Philippsburg&quot;, was published in 1957. Like his later books, it was set in Southern Germany in a postwar society, and satirically portrayed the &quot;conservative middle class&quot; during the &quot;so-called economic miracle&quot;. The novel first appeared in English three years later as &quot;The Gadarene Club&quot;.
The book became a huge success, which enabled Walser to work as a freelance author and reside in Friedrichshafen. In 1958 Walser lived in the U.S. for three months and participated in the Harvard International Seminary. He returned to the U.S. several times, invited by American universities to observe political conditions there.

Walser&#x27;s most famous and best-selling work was the novella &quot;Runaway Horse&quot;, published in 1978. It was both a commercial and a critical success, and was described as &quot;Walser&#x27;s most beautiful and mature book and a masterful, searing critique of society&quot;.

In 2004 Walser left his long-time publisher Suhrkamp Verlag for Rowohlt Verlag after the death of the Suhrkamp director . An unusual clause in his contract with Suhrkamp allowed him to take the publishing rights to all his works with him. According to Walser, a key reason for the switch was the lack of active support by Suhrkamp during the controversy over his novel &quot;&quot; (&quot;Death of a Critic&quot;).

Walser was a member of the in Berlin, the , the in Darmstadt, and the German P.E.N.

In 2007 the German political magazine placed Walser second on its list of the 500 most important German intellectuals, behind Pope Benedict XVI and ahead of Nobel Prize winner G√ºnter Grass.

== Work ==
Walser&#x27;s subjects were often broken heroes who found it difficult to live up to the requirements of society or their own expectations. Walser said: &quot;I think that world literature is about losers. That&#x27;s just the way it is. From Antigone to Josef K. ‚Äî there are no winners, no champions. And furthermore, anyone can confirm that in their circle of acquaintances: People are always more interesting when they are losing than when they are winning.&quot;

He wrote his most successful book, the novella &quot;Runaway Horse&quot;, in just two weeks. Its protagonists are two very different men, former school friends who experience a mid-life crisis.

Walser&#x27;s books have been translated into many languages. In 2007 he gave many of his manuscripts to the Deutsches Literaturarchiv Marbach for preservation. Some of them feature in a permanent exhibition at the Literaturmuseum der Moderne in Marbach, including &quot;Ein springender Brunnen&quot;.

=== &quot;Death of a Critic&quot; ===
In his 2002 roman-√†-clef &quot;Death of a Critic&quot;, Walser, who disliked literary critics in general, denounced one of the most prominent in Germany, of the (&quot;FAZ&quot;). Critics characterized his portrayal as &quot;playing on numerous anti-Semitic cliches&quot;. The novel caused a scandal, especially in view of Reich-Ranicki&#x27;s Jewish heritage and Walser&#x27;s former membership in the Nazi Party. The novel was hotly debated even before it was released. Frank Schirrmacher, editor of the &quot;FAZ&quot;, refused to print an advance excerpt in the paper, as had traditionally been done for Walser&#x27;s books.

In May 2010, Reich-Ranicki commented in an interview with : &quot;I don&#x27;t think he is an anti-Semite. But it is important to him to demonstrate that the critic who allegedly tortured him most is also a Jew. He expects his public to follow him in this. You see, there never was an anti-Semitic line or remark from Grass, not one. And I certainly haven&#x27;t written only positively about his books.&quot; After the scandal, Walser was not welcome in the U.S. for a long time.

== Political engagement ==
Walser was known for his political activity. In 1961, he was the first literary writer to support the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in an election campaign.
In 1964, Walser attended the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trial, and was involved in protests against the Vietnam War. During the late 1960s, Walser, like many German left intellectuals, including G√ºnter Grass, supported Willy Brandt for chancellor of West Germany.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Walser moved further to the left and was considered a sympathizer of the DKP, the newly formed West German Communist Party. He was friends with leading German Marxists such as and even visited Moscow during this time. By the 1980s, Walser began shifting back to the political right. In 1988 he gave a series of lectures titled &quot;Speeches about One&#x27;s Own Country&quot; in which he made clear that he considered the division of Germany a painful and intolerable gulf. This was also the topic of his story .

== Personal life ==
In 1950, Walser married Katharina (&quot;K√§the&quot;) Neuner-Jehle. The couple had four daughters: the actress Franziska Walser, the writer and painter Alissa Walser, the writer Johanna Walser, and the writer Theresia Walser. German journalist Jakob Augstein is Walser&#x27;s son from a relationship with translator Maria Carlsson.

Walser died in Nussdorf on 26 July 2023, at age 96.

== Awards ==
Walser was awarded the Hermann Hesse Prize in 1957 for his first novel. He received the Georg B√ºchner Prize in 1981, the Ricarda Huch Prize of Darmstadt in 1990, the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade in 1998, and the Friedrich Nietzsche Prize in 2015 for his life&#x27;s achievements, among many other awards.

=== Peace Prize of the German Book Trade ===
In 1998 Walser was awarded the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade. His acceptance speech, given at St. Paul&#x27;s Church in Frankfurt, invoked issues of historical memory and political engagement in contemporary German politics and unleashed a controversy that roiled German intellectual circles. Walser&#x27;s acceptance speech was titled: &quot;&quot; (Experiences while drafting a soap box speech): 
At first the speech caused no great stir; the audience received the speech with applause, though Ignatz Bubis, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, did not applaud, as confirmed by television footage of the event. Some days after the event, and again on 9November, the 60th anniversary of the pogrom against German Jews, Bubis accused Walser of &quot;intellectual arson&quot; () and claimed that Walser&#x27;s speech was both &quot;trying to block out history or, respectively, to eliminate the remembrance&quot; and pleading &quot;for a culture of looking away and thinking away&quot;. Then the controversy started. As described by Karsten Luttmer: Walser replied by accusing Bubis to have stepped &quot;out of dialogue between people&quot;. Walser and Bubis met on 12 December to discuss the heated controversy and settle the dispute. Bubis withdrew his claim that Walser had been intentionally incendiary, and Walser maintained that his speech was unambiguous. They agreed that no appropriate language had yet been found to deal with Germany&#x27;s past.

== Works ==

Walser&#x27;s books were published by Suhrkamp Verlag, Frankfurt, until 2003. The publisher printed an edition of his works in 12 volumes in 1997. Beginning in 2004, Walser&#x27;s works were published by Rowohlt, Reinbek. His works include:

<text>The Vasa Museum () is a maritime museum in Stockholm, Sweden. Located on the island of Djurg√•rden, the museum displays the only almost fully intact 17th-century ship that has ever been salvaged, the 64-gun warship &quot;Vasa&quot; that sank on her maiden voyage in 1628. The Vasa Museum opened in 1990 and, according to the official website, is the most visited museum in Scandinavia. Together with other museums such as the Stockholm Maritime Museum, it belongs to the Swedish National Maritime Museums (SNMM).

== History ==
From the beginning of 1961 to 1983, &quot;Vasa&quot; was housed in a temporary structure called Wasavarvet (&quot;The Vasa Shipyard&quot;) where she was treated with polyethylene glycol. Visitors could only view the ship from two levels and the maximum distance was only 5¬†m (17¬†ft). In 1981, the Swedish government decided that a permanent &quot;Vasa&quot; museum was to be constructed and a competition for the design of the museum building was organized. A total of 384 architects sent in models of their ideas and the final winners were Marianne Dahlb√§ck and G√∂ran M√•nsson with &quot;Ask&quot; (&quot;box&quot;). The construction of the new building began on and around the dry dock of the old naval yard with an inauguration ceremony hosted by Prince Bertil on 2 November 1987. &quot;Vasa&quot; was towed into the flooded dry dock under the new building in December 1987, and during the summer of 1989, when visitors were allowed onto the construction site, 228,000 people visited the half-finished museum. The museum was officially opened on 15 June 1990. So far, &quot;Vasa&quot; has been seen by over 25 million people. In 2017, the museum had a total of 1,495,760 visitors.

The main hall contains the ship itself, and various exhibits related to the archaeological findings of the ships and early 17th-century Sweden. &quot;Vasa&quot; has been fitted with the lower sections of all three masts, a new bowsprit, winter rigging, and has had certain parts that were missing or heavily damaged replaced. The replacement parts have not been treated or painted and are therefore clearly visible against the original material that has been darkened after three centuries under water.

The new museum is dominated by a large copper roof with stylized masts that represent the actual height of &quot;Vasa&quot; when she was fully rigged. Parts of the building are covered in wooden panels painted in dark red, blue, tar black, ochre yellow and dark green. The interior is similarly decorated, with large sections of bare, unpainted concrete, including the entire ceiling. Inside the museum the ship can be seen from six levels, from her keel to the very top of the sterncastle. Around the ship are numerous exhibits and models portraying the construction, sinking, location, and recovery of the ship. There are also exhibits that expand on the history of Sweden in the 17th century, providing background information for why the ship was built. A movie theatre shows a film in alternating languages on the recovery of the &quot;Vasa&quot;.

The museum is in the process of publishing an 8-volume archaeological report to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the salvage. &quot;Vasa I: The Archaeology of a Swedish Warship of 1628&quot; was published at the end of 2006. Subsequent volumes will be published annually.

The museum also features four other museum ships moored in the harbour outside: the ice breaker &quot;Sankt Erik&quot; (launched 1915), the lightvessel &quot;Finngrundet&quot; (1903), the torpedo boat &quot;Spica&quot; (1966) and the rescue boat &quot;Bernhard Ingelsson&quot; (1944).

<text>Peter Ulrich Weiss (8 November 1916 ‚Äì 10 May 1982) was a German writer, painter, graphic artist, and experimental filmmaker of adopted Swedish nationality. He is particularly known for his plays &quot;Marat/Sade&quot; and &quot;The Investigation&quot; and his novel &quot;The Aesthetics of Resistance&quot;.

Peter Weiss earned his reputation in the post-war German literary world as the proponent of an avant-garde, meticulously descriptive writing, as an exponent of autobiographical prose, and also as a politically engaged dramatist. He gained international success with &quot;Marat/Sade&quot;, the American production of which was awarded a Tony Award and its subsequent film adaptation directed by Peter Brook. His &quot;Auschwitz Oratorium,&quot; &quot;The Investigation&quot;, served to broaden the debates over the so-called &quot;Aufarbeitung der Vergangenheit&quot; (or formerly) &quot;Vergangenheitsbew√§ltigung&quot; or &quot;politics of history.&quot; Weiss&#x27;s magnum opus was &quot;The Aesthetics of Resistance&quot;, called one of the &quot;most important German-language work[s] of the 70s and 80s.&quot; His early, surrealist-inspired work as a painter and experimental filmmaker remains less well known.

== Life ==
Weiss was born in Nowawes (now part of Potsdam-Babelsberg) near Berlin, to a Hungarian Jewish father Jen√∂ Weisz from Nagy Em√∂ke, Nyitra County (whose parents were Moric Weisz and Fanny Steiner from Szered near Pozsony) and a Christian mother from Switzerland.
After the First World War and the break-up of the Austro-Hungarian Empire Weiss&#x27;s father became a Czech citizen and the son acquired his father&#x27;s citizenship ‚Äì Weiss was never a German citizen. At age three he moved with his family to the German port city of Bremen, and during his adolescence back to Berlin where he began training as a painter. In 1935 he emigrated with his family to Chislehurst, near London, where he studied photography at the Polytechnic School of Photography. In 1936‚Äì1937 the family moved to Czechoslovakia. Weiss attended the Prague Art Academy. After the German occupation of the Czech Sudetenland in 1938, his family moved to Sweden, while Weiss was visiting Hermann Hesse in Switzerland. In 1939 he joined his family in Stockholm, Sweden, where he lived for the rest of his life. He became a Swedish citizen in 1946. Weiss was married three times: to the painter Helga Henschen, 1943‚Äì47; to Carlota Dethorey, 1949; and from 1964 until his death to the Swedish artist and stage designer Gunilla Palmstierna-Weiss.

In the 1960s Weiss became increasingly politically radical, taking stands for revolutionary Cuba and against US intervention in Vietnam and visiting both countries. In 1966 he visited the United States together with the West German writers group &quot;Gruppe 47&quot;. During a conference at Princeton University he denounced the US war against North Vietnam which seems to have scandalized his German colleagues more than his US hosts. In 1967 he participated in the anti-war Russell Tribunal in Stockholm and in 1968 he joined the eurocommunist Swedish Left Party (VPK). During the same year he also visited North Vietnam and published a book about his trip.

In 1970 Weiss suffered a heart attack. During the following decade, he wrote his monumental three-part novel, &quot;The Aesthetics of Resistance&quot;, as well as two very different stage versions of Kafka&#x27;s novel &quot;The Trial&quot;. He died in Stockholm in 1982.

== Painting, Film, and Literature ==

During his early life as a painter ‚Äì 1930 to 1950 ‚Äì Weiss was influenced by old Dutch masters such as Pieter Breughel, and Hieronymus Bosch. After World War II his painting, as well as his work in film and literature, came under the lasting influence of Surrealism. He taught painting at Stockholm&#x27;s People&#x27;s University, and illustrated a Swedish edition of &quot;The Book of One Thousand and One Nights&quot;. In 1952 he joined the Swedish Experimental Film Studio, where he directed several experimental short films, followed by several socially conscious documentary shorts: &quot;Gesichter im Schatten&quot; (Faces in the Shadow, 1956), &quot;Im Namen des Gesetzes&quot; (In the Name of the Law, 1957), &quot;Was machen wir jetzt?&quot; (What Do We Do Now?, 1958). In 1959 he directed his only full length (experimental) film &quot;H√§gringen&quot; &quot;(The Disappeared&quot;). In the early 1950s, Weiss had begun to write again, producing a number of prose works, some in German, others in Swedish. Most are short, intense, surrealist text which suggest the influence of Kafka (whose work Weiss would later adapt for the stage).

The most important of these prose texts is &quot;Der Schatten des K√∂rpers des Kutschers&quot; (&quot;The Shadow of the Body of the Coachman&quot;, 1952). It is a nearly hermetic experimental work which explores language through the use of surreal, disturbing imagery whereby an apparent rural idyll is transformed into a kafkaesque nightmare. The Surrealist effect was enhanced by collages in the style of Max Ernst, so-called xylography, which Peter Weiss created for the book. &quot;Coachman&quot; has been linked both to the French &quot;nouveau roman&quot; of Alain Robbe-Grillet and Raymond Queneau, as well as to French absurdist works by Samuel Beckett, Eugene Ionesco, and Jean Genet. When it was eventually published in Germany in 1960 it put its 45-year-old writer at the forefront of the West German literary scene. Weiss abandoned painting and filmmaking and turned exclusively to writing. Nearly all his subsequent works ‚Äì and all of the major ones ‚Äì are written in German. His next prose work, &quot;Abschied von den Eltern&quot; (&quot;Leavetaking&quot;, 1959/60) was less hermetic than &quot;Coachman&quot; and strongly autobiographical. It was not only a critical but also a public success, as was its follow-up &quot;Fluchtpunkt&quot; (&quot;Vanishing Point&quot;, 1962)

Since the early 1950 Weiss had also been writing plays: &quot;Der Turm&quot; (&quot;The Tower&quot;, 1950), &quot;Die Versicherung&quot; (&quot;The Insurance&quot;, 1952), &quot;Nacht mit G√§sten&quot; (&quot;Night with Guests&quot;, 1963), &quot;Wie dem Herrn Mockinpott das Leiden ausgetrieben wird&quot; &quot;(How Mister Mockinpott was Cured of His Sufferings&quot;, 1963/68). But none of these stage works prepared the public for what came next: A play about the French Revolution which through its title alone became an overnight a sensation: &quot;&quot;Die Verfolgung und Ermordung Jean Paul Marats dargestellt durch die Schauspielgruppe des Hospizes zu Charenton unter Anleitung des Herrn de Sade&quot; (&quot;The Persecution and Assassination of Jean Paul Marat As Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton Under the Direction of Monsieur de Sade&quot;). First performed in West Berlin in 1964, it quickly brought Weiss notoriety. The following year, 1965, British director Peter Brook staged it at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in London. Brook&#x27;s film version (1967) turned &quot;Marat/Sade&quot; into an international cultural icon. Set in an insane asylum and constantly in danger of being overwhelmed by madness and chaos, the play explores the place of writers and intellectuals in a time of revolutionary upheaval. At its center are two very different historical figures, Jean-Paul Marat, a writer and leading intellectual of the French Revolution, and the Marquis de Sade, a writer and intellectual as well, whose attitude towards the revolution is much more ambivalent and who is solipsistically obsessed with sex, violence, and pain. In the play Weiss draws both on Antonin Artaud&#x27;s Theater of Cruelty and on its opposite: Brecht&#x27;s theater of reason. In the words of de Sade: &quot;Our intent in creating such dialogues as these / was to experiment with various antitheses / to oppose each to each so that we might / upon our many doubts shed some light&quot;. Much of the discussion of the play has focused on whether it is Marat&#x27;s or Sade&#x27;s position which prevails.

Beginning with &quot;Marat/Sade&quot; Weiss&#x27;s work increasingly attracted the attention of communist East Germany. The play and all the ones to follow were staged in exemplary fashion in Rostock and other theaters in the GDR. Weiss frequently visited East Berlin and became friends with many East German writers and artists. He developed a collaborative relationship and eventually a close friendship with Manfred Haiduk, professor of literature in Rostock. After Weiss wrote his play about Trotsky, which East German party functionaries interpreted as an anti-Leninist provocation, he for a while became persona non grata, but the relationship soon revived. Weiss was one of only a handful of western artists and intellectuals whose work attracted wide interest in both Germanies though in both states he was also subjected to distrust and denunciations.

During this period Brecht&#x27;s influence on Weiss&#x27;s plays became more evident. He also became obsessed with Dante&#x27;s Divine Comedy the influence of which is present in all his works from the mid-1960s until his death. In 1965, Weiss wrote the documentary play &quot;The Investigation&quot; (&quot;Die Ermittlung&quot;) on the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials. &quot;Like Marat/Sade&quot; it attracted wide international attention and became the focus of heated debates about the &#x27;right&#x27; way of representing Auschwitz and about who gets to decide what is acceptable and what is not. This was followed by two experimental plays about the struggle for self-determination in the &#x27;Third World&#x27;: &quot;Gesang vom lusitanischen Popanz&quot; (&quot;Song of the Lusitanian Bogey&quot; [a better translation would be &quot;Canto of the Lusitanian Bogey&quot;] 1967) about Angola, and &quot;Viet Nam Diskurs&quot; (&quot;Viet Nam Discourse&quot;, 1968). The next two plays once again focused on intellectuals and writers in times of upheaval: &quot;Trotzki im Exil&quot; (&quot;Trotsky in Exile&quot;, 1970) and &quot;H√∂lderlin&quot; (1971). Between 1971 and 1981 Weiss worked on his opus magnum: his three part 1000 page novel on the European resistance against Nazi Germany, &quot;The Aesthetics of Resistance&quot;.

Weiss received numerous awards, among them the Charles Veillon Award, 1963; the Lessing Prize, 1965; the Heinrich Mann Prize, 1966; the Carl Albert Anderson Prize, 1967; the Thomas Dehler Prize, 1978; the Cologne Literature Prize, 1981; the Bremen Literature Prize, 1982; the Swedish Theatre Critics Prize, 1982; and finally the highest German literary award, the Georg B√ºchner Prize, 1982.

<text>The Mazda Porter and Porter Cab are a series of small kei trucks that were produced from 1961 to 1989 (as the B360/B600 until 1968) by Mazda, mainly for sale in the domestic Japanese market. Export versions of the Porter were labelled E360. The Porter was replaced by the Autozam Scrum, a rebadged Suzuki Carry.

== B360/B600==

The predecessor of the Porter, introduced in February 1961, the Mazda B360, was available as a pickup (KBBA33) or light van (KBBAV) version of the R360 kei passenger car. It had a 356¬†cc OHV V-twin producing (&quot;BA&quot;) and weighed . The 1961 export only Mazda B600 (KBEA) was similar to the B360 except that it received an enlarged 577¬†cc version of the air-cooled V-twin. This engine produced and of torque.

In September 1963 the B360 gained the four-cylinder, 358¬†cc &quot;DB&quot; OHV engine from the Carol. It also received a facelift, with a larger grille using the same look as the B1500 truck. The modelcodes changed to KBDA33/KBDAV, and a DeLuxe Van version was added. Top speed went up from 67 to . In October 1966 the B360 received another facelift, giving it a much more modern look.

The two-cylinder B600 was one of the first Japanese cars to have an impact in the Indonesian market. The B600, nicknamed &quot;Soap Box&quot; (&quot;Kotak Sabun&quot;) in Indonesia for its square shape, was used by numerous government agencies and public utilities. It was only ever sold with van bodywork there. The B600 was a common sight in Indonesia for decades, so common that its V-twin engine has become popular for use in custom motorcycles. Since 2010, the supply of B600 engines has begun to dry up, however, with prices increasing accordingly.

In 1972, the B360/600 entered license production in Burma (today&#x27;s Myanmar). Mazda&#x27;s investment consisted of shipping the production equipment to Burma; this was part of Japanese war reparations to Myanmar. After strict sanctions were imposed in 1988 and the import of Japanese parts became impossible, manufacture shifted to MADI (Myanmar Automobile and Diesel Engine Industries). The little trucks were built in the &quot;No 2 Automobile Industry&quot; plant in the small town of Tonbo, at Kwinhla Station, Pandaung Township, Bago Division (just north of Yangon), where MADI also assembled the Mazda Pathfinder and the Hino TE truck. The truck was kept in production until the mid-1990s with 100 percent local content. Always painted in blue from the factory, these were ubiquitous as taxis in Burma (Mandalay in particular) until after the markets opened up in 2011.


==Porter==

Available either as a pickup truck (KBDB33) or a small van (KBDBV), the first Porter (E360 in export markets) was produced from November 1968 to April 1976. The car was closely based on the B360 predecessor, but with all-new body panels. This model was briefly assembled in South Africa by Motor Assemblies: 942 examples of the E360 were built there in 1969 and 1970.

The initial engine was the carry-over four-stroke, and 358¬†cc inline-four from the B360. The engine was changed to the new Chantez&#x27; , 359¬†cc water-cooled, two-stroke two-cylinder unit in April 1973. This change brought with it some cosmetic changes and a new model code (KBAA/KBAAV). In 1975 the Porter was modified to fit new, larger license plates and the engine downgraded to to match new, stricter emissions regulations. The pickup was typically painted Pale Canary Yellow from the factory, while vans were Light Green.

The wheelbase was with leaf springs in the rear, weight was and maximum cargo capacity was when first introduced.

==Porter Cab (1st generation)==
The Porter Cab (KECA53) was introduced in March 1969. It was a small, cabover pickup truck on a wheelbase, equipped with a live rear axle and a at 5500¬†rpm, 359¬†cc water-cooled, two-stroke two-cylinder. This, the CC, was Mazda&#x27;s first two-stroke engine. Top speed was . The Porter Cab, with its peculiar cowlings around the headlights carried an instantly recognizable &quot;surprised&quot; appearance.

In 1970 new doors were developed, with the original sliding windows exchanged for roll-down items, incorporating a quarter window. A ventilation vent was also added to the front. Like the Porter, the Porter Cab received the Chantez-derived AA engine in April 1973, which offered at 6000¬†rpm, five less than in the Chantez.

In January 1975, the Porter Cab too was lightly modified to fit the new larger license plates - hitherto, kei cars had carried smaller license plates than regular cars ( x rather than 330 x 165¬†mm). In April 1976 the Porter Cab also received an engine which met the new, tougher 1975 emissions regulations and the model code PC3A. The only color available was changed too, from light green to white. Like the Porter before it, the Porter Cab was labelled E360 in export markets.
===Prices===
==Porter Cab (2nd generation)==

When Kei car regulations were changed for 1976, due to shrinking sales in the category, Mazda did not think it a worthwhile expenditure to develop a new, clean 550¬†cc engine. Instead, they discontinued the Chantez passenger car and the Porter pickup, and began buying Mitsubishi&#x27;s 2G23 engines to equip the New Porter Cab which appeared in 1977 (PC4D). The Porter Cab was stretched by 200¬†mm (almost entirely behind the rear axle, with the wheelbase remaining unchanged) and widened by . Dimensions were now x as per the updated standards, and the 546¬†cc Vulcan S two-cylinder developed at 5500¬†rpm. The headlight bezels were squared off, lending the car a more conventional appearance. In 1979 the car gained two more horsepower.

The second generation Porter Cab was only available in a bright blue color with light grey trim (bumpers, headlight bezels) and black interior, until the 1983 facelift after which only white was available. The facelifted version gained the cleaner Vulcan II engine (G23B), although power output remained the same. Trim pieces were now in a darker grey, interior brown.

In 1985 there was another minor facelift, with trim pieces now in black and a black band between the headlights. The engine switched from a timing chain to a timing belt, and the interior changed to gray. Air conditioning was now available as an option. In 1987 the Mitsubishi Minicab received Mitsubishi&#x27;s new three-cylinder engine, but the Porter Cab had to soldier on with the old two-cylinder. In June 1989, after twenty years of continuous production with nothing more than facelifts, the Porter Cab was finally retired. It was replaced by the Autozam Scrum, a badge-engineered Suzuki Carry.

<text>The Mazda Chantez (chassis code KMAA) is a two-door kei car that was introduced by Mazda in July 1972. The Chantez had a longer wheelbase at than most of its competitors and featured the powerful two-stroke &quot;AA&quot; engine also seen in the Porter. With , top speed was and the sprint was dispatched in a sprightly 20.6¬†seconds. In more recent testing (early 2000s) of a 1972 GF II, 0‚Äì100¬†km/h came up in 35.8¬†seconds. The engine was installed longitudinally in the front of the vehicle powering the rear wheels, and the spare tire was installed next to the engine on the right side.

The name is second-person plural present indicative of , which in French means &#x27;to sing&#x27;.
Originally, the Chantez had been planned to use a single-rotor Wankel engine, a slimmed down derivative of the R100&#x27;s 10A engine, and test cars were seen in 1970. Mazda&#x27;s financial situation and lobbying from other &quot;Kei&quot; manufacturers, who considered this engine type an unfair advantage, to disallow rotary engines in this class meant that Mazda chose not to bring this version to market. As a result of not being able to build the car they had originally planned, Mazda lost interest in the Kei class and sales halted without a replacement in 1976, on the eve of new &quot;Kei&quot; car regulations. Mazda did not market another &quot;Kei&quot; passenger car until 1989 with a reintroduction of the Carol, which was a rebadged Suzuki Alto, and to this day still choose not to make their own engines for the &quot;Kei&quot; class.

Equipment levels ranged from the lowest spec L (less chrome, body colored bumpers and B-pillars), via the LX, GL, GF, and GL II to the top-of-the-line GF II, which featured a sports interior, radial tires, and available two-tone paint.

In late 1974, anticipating a changing law at the turn of the year, the trunk lid and front bumper were modified to fit larger-size license plates.
== Chantez EV Concept ==
The Mazda Chantez EV was a concept car designed by Mazda as part of the A.I.S.T. government funded scheme; it was unveiled at the 1972 Tokyo Motor Show.

The Chantez EV featured a unique grille-less appearance which helped with aerodynamic efficiency, also to aid with efficiency is Mazda&#x27;s first car with regenerative braking. The Chantez EV was fitted with a single electric motor, rear-mounted driving the rear axle, powered by a battery pack rated to deliver a total output of up to . It has a claimed top speed of . The battery replaced the rear seat and provided a stated range of about .

<doc id="833550" wikidata="Q363817" url="?curid=833550" title="Lloyd Doggett">
<text>Lloyd Alton Doggett II (born October 6, 1946) is an American lawyer and politician serving as a U.S. representative frrom Texas since 1995. A member of the Democratic Party, Doggett was a member of the Texas Senate from 1973 to 1985 and a justice of the Texas Supreme Court from 1989 to 1994.

Doggett represents the same district President Lyndon B. Johnson once represented from 1937 until 1949. He is also the dean of Texas&#x27;s congressional delegation; he previously shared the deanship with Sheila Jackson Lee until her death in 2024. Doggett was the first sitting Democratic congressperson after the CNN presidential debate to call on Joe Biden to drop out of the 2024 presidential race.

==Early life and education==
Doggett was born in Austin, the son of Alyce Paulin (Freydenfeldt) and Lloyd Alton Doggett. His maternal grandparents were Swedish. Doggett graduated Omicron Delta Kappa and received both a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business administration and a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Texas at Austin, where he served as student body president his senior year. While attending the University of Texas at Austin, he also joined Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity.

==Early career==
Doggett served as a member of the Texas Senate from 1973 to 1985. He gained attention in 1979 as a member of the &quot;Killer Bees&quot;, a group of 12 Democratic state senators who opposed a plan to move the state&#x27;s presidential primary to March 11. The intent was to give former Texas Governor John Connally a leg up on the 1980 Republican nomination. The Killer Bees wanted a closed primary. When this proposal was rejected, they walked out of the chamber and left the Senate two members short of a quorum. The bill was withdrawn five days later.

He was the Democratic nominee for the 1984 United States Senate election in Texas, losing to the Republican candidate, then-U.S. Representative Phil Gramm, by a wide margin. Doggett authored the bill creating the Texas Commission on Human Rights, as well as a law outlawing cop killer bullets and a sunset law requiring periodic review of government agencies.

In 1989, Doggett became both an Associate Justice of the Texas Supreme Court and an adjunct professor at the University of Texas School of Law.

==U.S. House of Representatives==


=== Elections ===
;Before 2012
Doggett was elected to the House of Representatives in 1994 in what was then the 10th district after 32-year incumbent Jake Pickle retired. He was one of the few Democrats to win an open seat in that year&#x27;s massive Republican landslide. Running for reelection in 1996, Doggett defeated Republican nominee Teresa Doggett, to whom he is no relation. It marked the second election in a row in which he defeated a black female Republican. In the years following his first reelection, Doggett consistently won around 85% of the vote, facing only Libertarian opponents. The 10th, which had once been represented by Lyndon Johnson, had long been a liberal Democratic bastion in increasingly Republican Texas.

Redistricting by the Texas Legislature in 2003 split Austin, which had been entirely or almost entirely in the 10th district for more than a century, into three districts. Through Republican gerrymandering, Doggett&#x27;s home wound up in a new, heavily Republican 10th district stretching from north central Austin to the Houston suburbs. Most of his former territory wound up on the 25th district, which consisted of a long tendril stretching from Austin to McAllen on the Mexican border. It was called &quot;the fajita strip&quot; or &quot;the bacon strip&quot; because of its shape. Doggett moved to the newly configured 25th and entered the Democratic primary‚Äîthe real contest in the heavily Democratic, majority-Hispanic district. He won the primary and the general election.

On June 28, 2006, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the nearby 23rd district&#x27;s lines violated the rights of Latino voters. As part of the 2003 redistricting, heavily Democratic and majority-Latino Laredo had largely been cut out of the 23rd and replaced by several heavily Republican areas near San Antonio. The decision turned on the fact that the 23rd was a protected majority-Latino district‚Äîin other words, if the 23rd was ever redrawn to put Latinos in a minority, an acceptable majority-Latino district had to be created in its place. While the new 23rd was 55% Latino, only 46% of its voting population was Latino. The Court therefore found that the 23rd was not an acceptable Latino-majority district. It also found that the 25th was not compact enough to be an acceptable replacement because the two Latino communities in the district were more than 300 miles apart, creating the impression that it had been deliberately drawn to pick up as many Latinos as possible without regard to compactness.

Due to the 23rd&#x27;s size, the ruling forced the redrawing of five districts between El Paso and San Antonio, including the 25th. For the 2006 election, Doggett regained most of his old base in Austin (though not the area around the University of Texas at Austin, which stayed in the 21st), and also picked up several suburbs southeast of the city. After skating to reelection in 2006 and 2008, he was held to only 52 percent of the vote in 2010‚Äîhis closest race since 1996.

;2012

It was reported that the new Congressional maps in Texas turned Doggett&#x27;s district from a strongly Democratic district into a strongly Republican one. The new map split Doggett&#x27;s old territory among five districts. His home was placed in a new, heavily Republican 25th district stretching from east Austin all the way to the fringes of Fort Worth. Much of his old base was placed in the newly created 35th district, a majority-Hispanic district stretching from San Antonio to eastern Austin. Doggett&#x27;s home was approximately five blocks east of the 35th. It appeared that the Republican-controlled state legislature had gerrymandered the district by packing as many Democrats in the San Antonio-Austin corridor into it as possible.

Doggett accused the Republicans of wanting to make it difficult, if not impossible, for an Anglo Democrat to be elected to Congress from Texas, saying, &quot;The Republican Party is determined to make the Democratic Party a party of minorities‚Äîthat is what this is about, as well.&quot; He added that the Republicans were deliberately trying to reduce Austin&#x27;s clout in Congress by &quot;deny[ing] the capital city an opportunity to have a district that reflects the capital city.&quot; He was faced with the choice between running in the reconfigured 25th or moving, joking that he would live in a Winnebago to be able to run in the newly created 35th.

Doggett was set to face State Representative Joaquin Castro in the 35th district primary election. The race was described as the biggest threat to Doggett&#x27;s survival yet, with Castro seen as a &quot;rising star&quot; in the Democratic party. Doggett accused Castro of working alongside Republicans throughout the redistricting process. The Republican House Redistricting Committee later said that any discussions with Castro took place after the area for the district was decided. Castro opted to run in the neighboring 20th district after its incumbent, Charlie Gonzalez, announced his retirement.

Doggett eventually decided to run in the 35th district, facing Bexar County assessor Sylvia Romo. Before the primary, he said that he would move into the district if he won. Political commentators suggested that Romo had the district numbers in her favor, but was attempting the difficult leap from local office to Congress, while Doggett had a huge amount of funding. Doggett stressed his long tenure as a progressive Democrat, saying he wanted to &quot;stoutly defend Social Security, Medicare, and national health care&quot;, and also touted his strong support for higher education programs and public education. By contrast, Romo&#x27;s campaign stressed her tax knowledge and CPA license, focusing on her potential to help with Congressional tax reform and economic growth.

Doggett won the primary with 73.2% of the vote. He performed strongly in San Antonio, an area he had never before represented. The district is so heavily Democratic that he was heavily favored to win the general election in November. He easily defeated Republican nominee, former San Marcos Mayor Susan Narvaiz, in the general election to become the first Anglo Democrat to represent a significant portion of San Antonio since Chick Kazen left office in 1985.

;2016
Doggett won his 12th House term in 2016. With 124,612 votes (63.1%), he again defeated Narvaiz, who polled 62,384 (31.6%). Two other contenders held the remaining 5.4% of the vote.

2022

Texas&#x27;s population growth resulted in its gaining two congressional seats after the 2020 census. In October 2021, Doggett announced he would run for reelection in the state&#x27;s new 37th district rather than the 35th. Austin had been split between five districts on the previous congressional map, and Republican members of Congress who represented the area began facing closer reelection margins later in the decade due to the city&#x27;s continued population growth and overwhelmingly Democratic voting patterns. Republican state legislators drew a new district almost entirely within Travis County to bolster Republican margins in surrounding districts. It closely resembles the area Doggett represented for his first five terms. Doggett&#x27;s decision to run in the 37th district created a vacancy in the 35th, which runs along Interstate 35 from Austin to San Antonio. Both seats are overwhelmingly Democratic, and the winner of the Democratic primary in the 35th district, Greg Casar, was easily elected in the general election. Doggett won the 37th just as easily.

== Tenure ==
Described as an &quot;endangered species&quot;, Doggett was one of only three white male Democratic House members from Texas in the 113th Congress (the others being Gene Green and Beto O&#x27;Rourke) in a state with mostly Republicans and minority members of the Democratic Party. Since Green&#x27;s and O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s retirements after the 2018 election, Doggett is the only white male Democrat representing Texas in Congress. He is one of the most liberal white Democrats from a Southern district, and one of the most liberal people ever to represent Texas in Congress. David Hawkings of &quot;Roll Call&quot; described his tax and environmental policies as &quot;muscular progressivism&quot;.

Doggett was a frequent critic of former Speaker Newt Gingrich while allying with David Bonior, the Democratic whip, when Bonior was leading &quot;an effort to diminish Gingrich&#x27;s power by raising continual questions about his ethics.&quot; He has been a close ally of Nancy Pelosi. In 2002, he supported her successful bid for Democratic leader over fellow Texan Martin Frost, a more moderate candidate.

On the local level, Doggett helped ensure the development of the Austin Outpatient Clinic, which opened in 2011 as the largest veterans&#x27; clinic of its kind in the country. In 2014, he secured passage of legislation to expand the Missions National Park and supported it being named a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Doggett has long supported more open government, and is also a leading advocate for campaign finance reform. On the Ways and Means Committee, he has sought to close many overseas tax shelters. Doggett has authored legislation to create tax incentives for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and to create a nationwide Silver Alert system. From 2011 to 2016, he served as ranking member of the Human Resources Subcommittee and in 2017 became ranking member of the Tax Policy Subcommittee. His priorities there included education, health care, preventing child abuse, reducing prescription drug prices, fighting poverty, and eliminating multinational tax shelters and loopholes.

On July 2, 2024, Doggett became the first sitting Democrat in Congress to openly call for President Joe Biden to withdraw from the 2024 United States presidential election after the first presidential debate, in which many perceived Biden performed poorly in, causing many Democrats to start being concerned about Biden&#x27;s age and cognitive ability.
Before Doggett took this political risk he spoke with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries. He also huddled with Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland and spoke with Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, a close ally of Biden&#x27;s, and &quot;with every other (House) member I could find.&quot; Doggett&#x27;s message was clear: &quot;We must have another candidate.&quot; Democrats had become doubtful of Biden&#x27;s ability to defeat former President Donald Trump in the general election.

After Trump&#x27;s victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, regarding not calling on Biden to call it quits sooner, Doggett said, ‚ÄúI only regret I didn‚Äôt do it earlier ... I believe that the only person in our caucus who doesn‚Äôt share some responsibility for the outcome is Dean Phillips, who came out early.‚Äù

=== Political positions ===
;Abortion
Doggett supports legalization of abortion. In 2003, he voted against a bill that would have banned all late-term procedures called partial-birth abortions. He was given a 100% by the NARAL. He voted in favor of a bill to provide federal funding for embryonic stem cell research in 2007.

;Environment
Doggett supports environmental preservation. He is one of the leading opponents in the House of drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve in Alaska. The League of Conservation Voters gave Doggett a 100% rating, an indication that he supports the group&#x27;s interpretation of environmental preservation. In the 110th Congress (2007‚Äì08), he wrote climate change legislation that would have gone further to reduce greenhouse gases than bills his party&#x27;s leaders supported.

In June 2009, Doggett voted for the American Clean Energy and Security Act, a bill that would have established an emissions trading system for American producers of carbon dioxide. He said, &quot;It has been a difficult and significant decision&quot;. &quot;I just decided that I will have a better chance to make changes later in the process if I acted in good faith now. But don&#x27;t think this means I&#x27;m signing off on the conference report&quot;, he added.

In 2018, Doggett was rated 100% by the group Clean Water Action.

;Gay rights
Doggett voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment in the 109th Congress. He voted against HR 4380 and HR 2587, bills that would have banned adoption by same-sex couples. In 1996, Doggett voted for the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), but in 2011 he co-sponsored the Respect for Marriage Act, which would repeal DOMA.

;Taxes
Doggett introduced legislation focused on restricting American companies from using overseas strategies to reduce their corporate tax rates. When Obama unveiled his plan in May 2009 to significantly change how U.S.-based multinationals are taxed, it included aspects of Doggett&#x27;s proposals to crack down on tax dodgers. He voted against the 2010 tax compromise, criticizing the renewal of the Bush tax cuts, saying &quot;This bill is largely a mishmash of rejected Republican ideas that cost too much to accomplish too little.&quot; He led a group of Democrats who &quot;criticized the inclusion of a Social Security payroll tax reduction, saying it would endanger the soundness of the program.&quot;

In 2010, Doggett was responsible for an amendment to an education jobs bill that would mandate that Texas keep the same amount of education funding for three years in order to receive $832 million in federal money. Rick Perry called it &quot;an unconstitutional anti-Texas amendment&quot; and later filed a lawsuit after the Department of Education declined the application for funds.

In 2015, Doggett introduced legislation to close a loophole that allows tax writeoffs for senior executive bonuses, calling it &quot;a perverse incentive for companies: the more you pay your executives, the less you&#x27;ll pay in taxes.&quot;

;Energy
Doggett has backed bills to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and supports cap-and-trade as well as clean technologies. He supported the 2009 climate-change bill, &quot;despite claiming it didn&#x27;t do enough to protect the environment.&quot; He said it stripped the EPA of too much power and was too beneficial to coal plants and &quot;other polluters.&quot; Doggett supports auctioning carbon allowances, and has worked to make legislation usually associated with the House Ways and Means Committee to be associated with the Energy and Commerce Committee.

In June 2015, Doggett voted against fast-track Trade Promotion Authority, calling it a &quot;charter for corporate America rather than a high-level trade agreement.&quot; He criticized the U.S. Trade Representative for failing to enforce labor and environmental standards. &quot;Usually, the reason that USTR fails is that it doesn&#x27;t really try,&quot; he said. &#x27;Asleep at the Wheel&#x27; is a great Texas swing band, but it is a horrible philosophy for trade law enforcement.&quot;

In 2015, Doggett&#x27;s continued interest in international affairs was reflected in his support for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the Iran nuclear deal. Together with Representatives David Price and Jan Schakowsky, Doggett organized a successful whip effort to ensure Congress did not obstruct nuclear negotiations with Iran.

;Health care
In March 2010, Doggett voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Before his vote, he cited concerns that the bill did not include enough affordability, insurance competition provisions, and consumer protection provisions. Originally an advocate of a public option, he conceded the option in the final vote.

In 2015, Congress passed Doggett&#x27;s NOTICE Act, which ensures that hospitalized seniors are notified whether they are in outpatient observation or inpatient care, saving them the sticker shock from realizing Medicare may not cover their skilled nursing facility care as expected. Doggett sponsored the Medicare Identity Theft Prevention Act, which was enacted in 2015 and protects seniors from identity theft by removing Social Security numbers from Medicare cards. Another of Doggett&#x27;s sponsored bills, the Ensuring Access to Clinical Trials Act, was enacted that same year. It allows patients with rare diseases to receive some compensation for clinical trial participation, without that compensation counting toward income eligibility limits for Social Security income or Medicaid.

Doggett has said Republicans in Congress and &quot;ideological groups that have never accepted the idea of social insurance&quot; pose a greater threat to Social Security than the country&#x27;s aging population.

Doggett founded the House Prescription Drug Task Force to tackle the cost of prescription drugs.

Doggett co-sponsored the Medicare for All Act of 2019.

;Criticism of healthcare opponents
In August 2009, a &quot;rally&quot; against Obamacare broke out after Doggett said that he would support it even if his constituents opposed it. The protesters, who chanted &quot;just say no&quot;, were later criticized by Doggett, who called them a &quot;mob&quot; and &quot;extremists&quot;, and said the group was part of the &quot;party of no.&quot; Of the situation, he said: &quot;Their fanatical insistence on repealing Social Security and Medicare is not just about halting health care reform but rolling back 75 years of progress.&quot; Doggett said he was committed to individual choices.

Doggett reportedly tried to answer questions, but felt the demonstrators opposed all government programs, including Social Security and Medicare, in addition to the health care plan. He said that &quot;[i]n Texas, not only with the weather but with the politics, it is pretty hardball around here ... I have a pretty thick skin about all of this. But this really goes over the line.&#x27;&quot;

;Immigration
Doggett supports a guest worker program for undocumented immigrants. In 2004, he voted against a bill that would have required hospitals to report undocumented immigrants who received hospital treatment to the Department of Justice. The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), an anti-immigration organization classified by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group, gave Doggett a score of 0% ‚Äì indicating the percentage of times he voted in favor of FAIR&#x27;s positions ‚Äì in 2003.

Doggett also supports the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which grants undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. at a young age, known as &quot;Dreamers&quot;, access to work permits and deportation relief.

;Iraq
Doggett was one of the leading opponents of the authorization of the Iraq War in 2003 and called for a timetable for U.S. troops pulling out of Iraq. On May 24, 2007, he was one of 140 Democrats and two Republicans to vote against HR 2206, a bill that would provide emergency supplemental appropriations for funding the war, and in 2009 he was one of only 30 representatives to vote against HR 2346, which provided funding to continue war.

;Education
In 2009, as part of the Obama administration&#x27;s American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Doggett authored the American Opportunity Tax Credit, which provides a refundable credit for some tuition and related expenses.

;Other social service issues
In January 2013, Doggett passed a bill into law setting up a national commission to examine ways to reduce the number of children who die of abuse and neglect. More children die in Texas of abuse and neglect than in any other state. The tax and spending deal approved that month to avoid a so-called &quot;fiscal cliff&quot; included an extension of a higher-education tax credit he had proposed. He also worked with Representative Sam Johnson to pass a bill through the House in December 2012 to authorize the phased removal of Social Security numbers from Medicare cards to crack down on identity theft.

;Trump administration
Doggett was a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, skipping his inauguration to speak at the Women&#x27;s March at the State Capitol in Austin, which observers described as the largest protest in Texas history. He has played a leading role in seeking disclosure of Trump&#x27;s tax returns and in opposing the repeal of the Affordable Health Care Act. Doggett also sponsored a resolution to formally censure Trump for his failure regarding violence at Charlottesville, Virginia.

;Syria
In 2023, Doggett was among 56 Democrats to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21 which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.

;Israel
Doggett voted to provide Israel with financial support in the 2023 Israel-Hamas war. He has since criticized Israel and U.S. policy for failing to protect civilians in Gaza.

<text>The International Examiner is a free monthly Asian American newspaper and media nonprofit organization based in Seattle, Washington&#x27;s historic Chinatown International District (CID). It was founded in 1974 by Gerald Yuasa and Lawrence Imamura to serve what the founders thought were the business interests of the Asian American community in Seattle&#x27;s CID. In 2023, the &quot;Examiner&quot; published its 50th volume, identifying five areas of coverage: public safety, the arts, housing, transportation, cultural preservation, and commerce. The editorial team received 2024 Editorial Excellence awards from fellow journalists at &quot;Real Change.&quot; With its print editions distributed across Seattle, and articles published on a rolling basis online, its total monthly readership is estimated at 20,000.

In 1975, the &quot;Examiner&quot; was purchased by the Alaska Cannery Workers Association (ACWA) for $1 and became an activist, community-based newspaper. Although the paper became independent three years later, it continued the tradition of community activism firmly established under the ACWA. As such, its editors were also community activists and organizers, rather than traditional journalists.

Today, the &quot;International Examiner&quot; is the oldest Asian American newspaper in the Pacific Northwest and the oldest continuously publishing pan-Asian newspaper in the country. The &quot;IE&quot; is a registered 501 (c)(3) non-profit organization governed by a volunteer Board of Directors.

<text>The Warlord Chronicles or The Warlord Trilogy is a series of three novels about Arthurian Britain written by Bernard Cornwell. The story is written as a mixture of historical fiction and Arthurian legend. The books were originally published between 1995 and 1997 by Penguin and Michael Joseph in the United Kingdom and by St. Martin&#x27;s Press in the United States. It has been adapted for television as &quot;The Winter King&quot;.

==Books in the trilogy==
* &quot;The Winter King&quot; (1995)
* &quot;Enemy of God&quot; (1996)
* &quot;&quot; (1997)

==Treatment of legend and history==
The story is written as if it took place in Dark Age Britain as described in the original Welsh legends, with appropriate types of technology, culture, warfare, and attitudes. Cornwell also weaves later additions such as Merlin and Lancelot into the plot.

Like other interpretations of the Arthurian legends, the series postulates that post-Roman Britain was a difficult time for the native Britons, who were threatened by invasion from the Anglo-Saxons in the East and raids from the Irish in the West. At the same time, they suffered internal power struggles between their petty kingdoms. Like Marion Zimmer Bradley in her novel &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot;, Cornwell also presumes friction occurred between the old Druidic religion and Christianity.

The protagonist of the series is Derfel Cadarn (pronounced Derv-el), based on the part-legendary Saint Derfel and on Bedivere. Cornwell&#x27;s Derfel is a Saxon brought up as a Briton by Merlin, the greatest of all Druids. In the course of the story, he becomes a great warrior and one of Arthur&#x27;s warlords in his war against the Saxons. Derfel is one of Arthur&#x27;s closest advisers and friends, and casts Excalibur into the sea after the Battle of Camlann. Merlin, meanwhile, concerns himself with trying to restore the old gods of Britain.

Other characters from the Arthurian mythos are given significant twists. For example, Lancelot, always portrayed as the most virtuous and the mightiest of Arthur&#x27;s knights, here is depicted as an arrogant, cowardly, and self-serving petty prince, whose legendary feats and martial prowess are crafted through the songs of the bards and a fictional reputation that he himself carefully cultivates. Sagramor is a Hungarian prince in the Lancelot-Grail Cycle, but is depicted here as a Numidian veteran of the old Roman Army who joined Arthur&#x27;s service after the collapse of the Empire.

Cornwell portrays Merlin as a lecherous, driven, mischievous, and irreverent druid. His solution to the problem of integrating the magic of the Arthurian mythos in the context of historical fiction is to leave room for the reader to take the &quot;magic&quot; depicted in the story at face value or to interpret it as a mixture of coincidence, psychology, primitive technology, and illusion, which preys on the superstitions, religious fundamentalism, and intolerance of the time.

==Reception==
&quot;The Warlord Chronicles&quot; has been acclaimed for both its storytelling qualities and its accuracy in portraying contemporary life. Cornwell himself has said, &quot;I have to confess that of all the books I have written these three are my favourites.&quot;

==Audiobooks==
Isis Audio Books and HarperCollins have published unabridged audiobook recordings of all three novels, read by Edmund Dehn and Jonathan Keeble respectively. Penguin Audiobooks have also published abridged versions of the three novels, read by Tim Pigott-Smith.

==Television adaptation==

On 22 April 2022, Sony Pictures Television announced that their recently acquired production company Bad Wolf were adapting &quot;The Winter King&quot; into a 10-part series for British television. The series was developed for television by Kate Brooke and Ed Whitmore, premiering in 2023 on ITVX, the upcoming streaming platform from U.K. broadcaster ITV.

The live-action adaptation had previously been linked to Epix and One Big Picture. On April 4, 2022, Bad Wolf announced that filming would begin in late 2022 in Wales and that the series would no longer air on Epix.

<text>The Seattle Chinese Post () was a weekly Chinese-language newspaper based in Seattle, Washington&#x27;s International District. It was founded on 1982 by Assunta Ng, also founder of the &quot;Northwest Asian Weekly.&quot; At the time of its founding, it was the first Chinese-language newspaper published in the Pacific Northwest since 1927.

== History ==
&quot;The Seattle Chinese Post&quot; was founded by Assunta Ng. It was given its name in December 1981 by community members in the surrounding International District in an &quot;open-naming&quot; contest. Originally headquartered in the Bush Hotel in the International District, &quot;The Seattle Chinese Post&#x27;s&quot; first issue was published January 20, 1982. The first issue consisted primarily of advertisements because, at the time, Chinese characters had to be manually typed and typesetters used a bulky and noisy tool imported from Taiwan.

In September 1982, &quot;The Seattle Chinese Post&quot; expanded its English-language coverage from two articles an issue to a full four-page insert. This insert grew and became &quot;The Seattle Chinese Post&#x27;s&quot; sister paper, &quot;Northwest Asian Weekly&quot;, which was officially launched on February 5, 1983.

In 1985, &quot;The Seattle Chinese Post&quot; and &quot;Northwest Asian Weekly&quot; launched the first Seattle Chinese Yellow Pages.

In 1986, Ng&#x27;s husband, George Liu, joined The Seattle Chinese Post and Northwest Asian Weekly as a full-time manager.

In 1987, &quot;The Seattle Chinese Post&quot; moved its offices from the Bush Hotel to the former site of the Wing Luke Museum.

On December 29, 2022, the paper announced it will cease print and online operations. Its final print issue was on January 21, 2023. The &quot;Northwest Asian Weekly&quot; also ceased print but its website will continue to be updated for the foreseeable future.

In September 2023, it was announced &quot;The Seattle Chinese Post&quot; was to resume publishing articles online on Oct. 5 after the newspaper‚Äôs owner Assunta Ng donated it to the Tacoma-based nonprofit Asia Pacific Cultural Center. Three former contributors will write for the website.

<doc id="833560" wikidata="Q889441" url="?curid=833560" title="Boden's Mate">
<text>Boden&#x27;s Mate is a checkmating pattern in chess characterized by bishops on two criss-crossing diagonals (for example, bishops on a6 and f4 delivering mate to a king on c8), with possible flight squares for the king being occupied by friendly pieces or under attack by enemy pieces. Most often the checkmated king has castled queenside, and is mated on c8 or c1. Many variants on the mate are seen, for example a king on e8 checkmated by bishops on g6 and a3, and a king on f1 checkmated by bishops on h3 and b6. Often the mate is immediately preceded by a sacrifice that opens up the diagonal on which the bishop delivers checkmate, and the mate is often a pure mate (as is the case for all but one of the examples given here).

The mate is named for Samuel Boden, who played a famous early example of it in Schulder‚ÄìBoden, London 1853. However, it had been known previously from the game Horwitz‚ÄìPopert, Hamburg 1844.
==History==

Boden&#x27;s Mate is characterized by a king being mated by two bishops on criss-crossing diagonals, with possible flight squares blocked by friendly pieces. Samuel Boden, for whom the mate is named, administered an early example of it in the friendly game Schulder‚ÄìBoden, London 1853. That game went 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 3.c3 f5 4.Bc4 Nf6 5.d4 fxe4 6.dxe5 exf3 7.exf6 Qxf6 8.gxf3 Nc6 9.f4 Bd7 10.Be3 0-0-0 11.Nd2 Re8 12.Qf3 Bf5 13.0-0-0? (13.Bd5 is better) 13...d5! 14.Bxd5? (allowing a forced mate; better is 14.Rde1, losing a piece) 14...Qxc3+ 15.bxc3 Ba3#, giving the final checkmate position shown in the diagram.

However, the mate had been known before that from the game Horwitz‚ÄìPopert, Hamburg 1844 (see diagram). There, Black set a trap with 1...Bb8, which White fell into with 2.Rxd5?. Instead of playing the winning 2...Qxh2+ 3.Qxh2 Rxh2+ 4.Kxh2 c6+ (5.Re5 Nxe5 6.dxe5?? Rxd1) Black blundered with 2...c6??. After that White could not save his rook because of the threatened mate in two. Instead, he surprised Black with 3.Rh5! Qxh5 4.Qxc6+! bxc6 5.Bxa6#.
==Typical pattern==

Boden&#x27;s Mate has occurred in many later games, usually, as in the Boden and Horwitz games, after the losing king has castled on the queenside, and the winner sets up the mate by a queen sacrifice on c3 or c6.

Perhaps the most famous example of Boden&#x27;s Mate is the so-called Peruvian Immortal game, Canal‚ÄìNN, simultaneous exhibition, Budapest 1934: 1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nc3 Qa5 4.d4 c6 5.Nf3 Bg4 6.Bf4 e6 7.h3 Bxf3 8.Qxf3 Bb4 9.Be2 Nd7 10.a3 0-0-0?? 11.axb4!! Qxa1+ 12.Kd2! Qxh1 13.Qxc6+! bxc6 14.Ba6#.
==Atypical patterns==

More rarely, Boden&#x27;s Mate can occur, for example, (a) where a White bishop on g6 delivers mate to a Black king on e8, which is hemmed in by a White bishop on a3, and its own queen on d8 and knight on d7 or (b) where a bishop on h6 delivers mate to a Black king on f8, which is hemmed in by a White bishop on c4, and its own queen on e8 and bishop on e7. An example of the former was Alekhine‚ÄìVasic, Banja Luka 1931: 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.Bd3 Bxc3+? 5.bxc3 h6? 6.Ba3 Nd7 7.Qe2 dxe4 8.Bxe4 Ngf6 9.Bd3 b6??, when White mated with 10.Qxe6+ fxe6 11.Bg6#. An example of the latter occurred in Elyashov‚ÄìNN, Paris 1948, which illustrates an opening trap arising from From&#x27;s Gambit. After 1.f4 e5!? 2.fxe5 d6 3.exd6 Bxd6 4.Nf3 g5 5.d4 g4 6.Ng5?! f5 7.e4 Be7? 8.Nh3! gxh3 9.Qh5+ Kf8 10.Bc4 Qe8, White mated with 11.Qh6+! Nxh6 12.Bxh6#.

In a game between two of the strongest players of the nineteenth century, White delivered a Boden&#x27;s Mate to a king on e7: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nge7 4.c3 d6 5.d4 Bd7 6.0-0 Ng6 7.Ng5 h6 8.Nxf7 Kxf7 9.Bc4+ Ke7 10.Qh5 Qe8 11.Qg5+! hxg5 12.Bxg5# Zukertort‚ÄìAnderssen, Breslau 1865. An unusual example of Boden&#x27;s Mate occurring to a king on d8, and without the winning side having to sacrifice to achieve the mating position, occurred in Pandolfini‚ÄìNN, 1970, after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Nxe4 6.d4 exd4 7.Re1 d5 8.Nxd4 Bd6 9.Nxc6 Bxh2+ 10.Kh1 Qh4 11.Rxe4+ dxe4 12.Qd8+ Qxd8 13.Nxd8+ Kxd8 14.Kxh2 (So far this is a position known to opening theory from the Riga Variation of the Ruy Lopez. White is considered to have the advantage after 14...Be6 15.Be3.) f5?? 15.Bg5# 1‚Äì0.

<doc id="833569" wikidata="Q335713" url="?curid=833569" title="John Ganzoni, 2nd Baron Belstead">
<text>John Julian Ganzoni, 2nd Baron Belstead, Baron Ganzoni, (30 September 1932 ‚Äì 3 December 2005) was a British Conservative politician and peer who served as Leader of the House of Lords under Margaret Thatcher from 1988 to 1990.

==Background and education==
Ganzoni was the only son of Sir John Ganzoni, a barrister and Conservative MP for Ipswich who was created Baron Belstead in 1938, and his wife Gwendolen Gertrude Turner, daughter of Arthur Turner, of Ipswich. He went to Eton before reading History at Christ Church, Oxford.

==Political career==
Belstead showed little interest in politics at first, and waited six years after succeeding to the peerage on his father&#x27;s death in 1958 before making his maiden speech. In 1970, Edward Heath appointed him to become Parliamentary Under-Secretary to Margaret Thatcher at the Department of Education and Science; he was moved in the same rank to the Northern Ireland Office three years later.

When Margaret Thatcher led the Tories back to power in 1979, she sent him to the Home Office. He was then made Minister at the Foreign Office when Lord Carrington and his team resigned after the Falklands invasion. In 1980, he was interviewed by the BBC&#x27;s Panorama current affairs program about Britain&#x27;s preparations for a nuclear attack.

He next moved to the Ministry of Fisheries and Food, and went back to the Education Department again before becoming Deputy Leader to William Whitelaw as Leader of the House of Lords. He succeeded Whitelaw in that post in 1988, taking the sinecure post of Lord Privy Seal at the same time.

After losing his Cabinet seat, which he had gained when he became Lord Privy Seal, in 1990 he became Paymaster General and Northern Ireland Minister under John Major, retiring from the Government to become Chairman of the Parole Board in 1992.

In the 1983 New Year Honours, he was sworn of the Privy Council. After the House of Lords Act 1999 removed the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords, he was created a life peer (an honour given to all former Leaders of the House of Lords) as Baron Ganzoni, of Ipswich in the County of Suffolk on 17 November 1999. He also gave his name to the new &quot;Belstead Centre&quot; at Woodbridge School.

==Personal life==
Lord Belstead never married. He died in December 2005, aged 73, when both the hereditary peerage and the baronetcy became extinct. He is buried in the churchyard of St Mary&#x27;s, Great Bealings, Suffolk.

He was an active Freemason and president of the Board of General Purposes for the United Grand Lodge of England. He was appointed to be a Deputy Lieutenant of the County of Suffolk on 2 April 1979.

<text>Internal ballistics (also interior ballistics), a subfield of ballistics, is the study of the propulsion of a projectile.

In guns, internal ballistics covers the time from the propellant&#x27;s ignition until the projectile exits the gun barrel. The study of internal ballistics is important to designers and users of firearms of all types, from small-bore rifles and pistols, to artillery.

For rocket-propelled projectiles, internal ballistics covers the period during which a rocket motor is providing thrust.

==General concepts==
Interior ballistics can be considered in three time periods:
*Lock time - the time from sear release until the primer is struck
*Ignition time - the time from when the primer is struck until the projectile starts to move
*Barrel time - the time from when the projectile starts to move until it exits the barrel.

The burning firearm propellant produces energy in the form of hot gases that raise the chamber pressure which applies a force on the base of the projectile, causing it to accelerate. The chamber pressure depends on the amount of propellant that has burned, the temperature of the gases, and the volume of the chamber. The burn rate of the propellant depends on the chemical make up and shape of the propellant grains. The temperature depends on the energy released and the heat loss to the sides of the barrel and chamber. 

As the projectile travels down the barrel, the volume the gas occupies behind the projectile increases. Some energy is lost in deforming the projectile and causing it to spin. There are also frictional losses between the projectile and the barrel. The projectile, as it travels down the barrel, compresses the air in front of it, which adds resistance to its forward motion.

The breech and the barrel must resist the high-pressure gases without damage. Although the pressure initially rises to a high value, the pressure starts dropping when the projectile has traveled some distance down the barrel. Consequently, the muzzle end of the barrel does not need to be as strong as the chamber end.

Mathematical models have been developed for these processes. The four general concepts which are calculated in interior ballistics are:
# Energy - released by the propellant
# Motion - the relation between the projectile acceleration and the pressure on its base.
# Burning rate - a function of the propellant surface area and an empirically derived burning rate coefficient which is unique to the propellant.
# Form function - a burning rate modifying coefficient that includes the shape of the propellant.

==History==
Internal ballistics was not scientifically based prior to the mid-1800s. Barrels and actions were built strong enough to survive a known overload (Proof test). Muzzle velocity was surmised from the distance the projectile traveled.

In the 1800s test barrels began to be instrumented. Holes were drilled in the barrel and fitted with standardized steel pistons which exerted pressure which compressed standardized copper cylinders when the firearm discharged. The reduction in the copper cylinder length is used as an indication of peak pressure, known as &quot;Copper Units of Pressure&quot;, or &quot;CUP&quot; for high pressure firearms. Similar standards were applied to firearms with lower peak pressures, typically common handguns, with test cylinder pellets made of more easily deformed lead cylinders, hence &quot;Lead Units of Pressure&quot;, or &quot;LUP&quot;. The measurement only indicated the maximum pressure that was reached at that point in the barrel. Piezoelectric strain gauges were introduced in the 1960&#x27;s, allowing instantaneous pressures to be measured without destructive pressure ports. Instrumented projectiles were developed by the Army Research Laboratory that measures the pressure at the base of the projectile and acceleration.

==Priming methods==
Methods of igniting the propellant evolved over time. A small hole (a touch hole) was drilled into the breech, into which a propellant was then poured, and an external flame or spark applied (see matchlock and flintlock). Percussion caps were and self-contained cartridges have primers that detonate after mechanical deformation, igniting the propellant. 

==Propellants==

===Black powder===

Gunpowder (Black powder) is a finely ground, pressed and granulated mechanical pyrotechnic mixture of sulfur, charcoal, and potassium nitrate or sodium nitrate. It can be produced in a range of grain sizes. The size and shape of the grains can increase or decrease the relative surface area, and change the burning rate significantly. The burning rate of black powder is relatively insensitive to pressure, meaning it will burn quickly and predictably even without confinement, making it also suitable for use as a low explosive. It has a very slow decomposition rate, and therefore a very low brisance. It is not, in the strictest sense of the term, an explosive, but a &quot;deflagrant&quot;, as it does not detonate but decomposes by deflagration due to its subsonic mechanism of flame-front propagation.

===Nitrocellulose (single-base propellants)===

Nitrocellulose or &quot;guncotton&quot; is formed by the action of nitric acid on cellulose fibers. It is a highly combustible fibrous material that deflagrates rapidly when heat is applied. It also burns very cleanly, burning almost entirely to gaseous components at high temperatures with little smoke or solid residue. &quot;Gelatinised&quot; nitrocellulose is a plastic, which can be formed into cylinders, tubes, balls, or flakes known as &quot;single-base&quot; propellants. The size and shape of the propellant grains can increase or decrease the relative surface area, and change the burn rate significantly. Additives and coatings can be added to the propellant to further modify the burn rate. Normally, very fast powders are used for light-bullet or low-velocity pistols and shotguns, medium-rate powders for magnum pistols and light rifle rounds, and slow powders for large-bore heavy rifle rounds.

===Double-base propellants===

Nitroglycerin can be added to nitrocellulose to form &quot;double-base propellants&quot;. Nitrocellulose desensitizes nitroglycerin to prevent detonation in propellant-sized grains, (see dynamite), and the nitroglycerin gelatinises the nitrocellulose and increases the energy. Double-base powders burn faster than single-base powders of the same shape, though not as cleanly, and burn rate increases with nitroglycerin content.

In artillery, Ballistite or Cordite has been used in the form of rods, tubes, slotted-tube, perforated-cylinder or multi-tubular; the geometry being chosen to provide the required burning characteristics. (Round balls or rods, for example, are &quot;degressive-burning&quot; because their production of gas decreases with their surface area as the balls or rods burn smaller; thin flakes are &quot;neutral-burning,&quot; since they burn on their flat surfaces until the flake is completely consumed. The longitudally perforated or multi-perforated cylinders used in large, long-barreled rifles or cannon are &quot;progressive-burning;&quot; the burning surface increases as the inside diameter of the holes enlarges, giving sustained burning and a long, continuous push on the projectile to produce higher velocity without increasing the peak pressure unduly. Progressive-burning powder compensates somewhat for the pressure drop as the projectile accelerates down the bore and increases the volume behind it.)

===Solid propellants (caseless ammunition)===

&quot;Caseless ammunition&quot; incorporates propellant cast as a single solid grain with the priming compound placed in a hollow at the base and the bullet attached to the front. Since the single propellant grain is so large (most smokeless powders have grain sizes around 1¬†mm, but a caseless grain will be perhaps 7¬†mm diameter and 15¬†mm long), the relative burn rate must be much higher. To reach this rate of burning, caseless propellants often use moderated explosives, such as RDX. 

The major advantages of a successful caseless round would be elimination of the need to extract and eject the spent cartridge case, permitting higher rates of fire and a simpler mechanism, and also reduced ammunition weight by eliminating the weight (and cost) of the brass or steel case.

While there is at least one experimental military rifle (the H&amp;K G11), and one commercial rifle (the Voere VEC-91), that use caseless rounds, they have met with little success. One other commercial rifle was the Daisy VL rifle made by the Daisy Air Rifle Co. and chambered for .22 caliber caseless ammunition that was ignited by a hot blast of compressed air from the lever used to compress a strong spring like for an air rifle. The caseless ammunition is of course not reloadable, since there is no casing left after firing the bullet, and the exposed propellant makes the rounds less durable. Also, the case in a standard cartridge serves as a seal, keeping gas from escaping the breech. Caseless arms must use a more complex self-sealing breech, which increases the design and manufacturing complexity. Another unpleasant problem, common to all rapid-firing arms but particularly problematic for those firing caseless rounds, is the problem of rounds &quot;cooking off&quot;. This problem is caused by heat from the chamber heating the round in the chamber to the point where it ignites, causing an unintentional discharge.

To minimize the risk of cartridge cook-off, machineguns can be designed to fire from an open bolt, with the round not chambered until the trigger is pulled, and so there is no chance for the round to cook off before the operator is ready. Such weapons could use caseless ammunition effectively. Open-bolt designs are generally undesirable for anything but machine guns; the mass of the bolt moving forward causes the gun to lurch in reaction, which significantly reduces the accuracy of the gun, which is generally not an issue for machinegun fire.

==Propellant charge==
===Load density and consistency===

Load density is the percentage of the space in the cartridge case that is filled with powder. In general, loads close to 100% density (or even loads where seating the bullet in the case compresses the powder) ignite and burn more consistently than lower-density loads. In cartridges surviving from the black-powder era (examples being .45 Colt, .45-70 Government), the case is much larger than is needed to hold the maximum charge of high-density smokeless powder. This extra room allows the powder to shift in the case, piling up near the front or back of the case and potentially causing significant variations in burning rate, as powder near the rear of the case will ignite rapidly but powder near the front of the case will ignite later. This change has less impact with fast powders. Such high-capacity, low-density cartridges generally deliver best accuracy with the fastest appropriate powder, although this keeps the total energy low due to the sharp high-pressure peak.

Magnum pistol cartridges reverse this power/accuracy tradeoff by using lower-density, slower-burning powders that give high load density and a broad pressure curve. The downside is the increased recoil and muzzle blast from the high powder mass, and high muzzle pressure.

Most rifle cartridges have a high load density with the appropriate powders. Rifle cartridges tend to be bottlenecked, with a wide base narrowing down to a smaller diameter, to hold a light, high-velocity bullet. These cases are designed to hold a large charge of low-density powder, for an even broader pressure curve than a magnum pistol cartridge. These cases require the use of a long rifle barrel to extract their full efficiency, although they are also chambered in rifle-like pistols (single-shot or bolt-action) with barrels of 10 to 15¬†inches (25 to 38¬†cm).

==Chamber==

===Straight vs bottleneck===

Straight walled cases were the standard from the beginnings of cartridge arms. With the low burning speed of black powder, the best efficiency was achieved with large, heavy bullets, so the bullet was the largest practical diameter. The large diameter allowed a short, stable bullet with high weight, and the maximum practical bore volume to extract the most energy possible in a given length barrel. There were a few cartridges that had long, shallow tapers, but these were generally an attempt to use an existing cartridge to fire a smaller bullet with a higher velocity and lower recoil. With the advent of smokeless powders, it was possible to generate far higher velocities by using a slow smokeless powder in a large volume case, pushing a small, light bullet. The odd, highly tapered 8 mm Lebel, made by necking down an older 11¬†mm black-powder cartridge, was introduced in 1886, and it was soon followed by the 7.92√ó57mm Mauser and 7√ó57mm Mauser military rounds, and the commercial .30-30 Winchester, all of which were new designs built to use smokeless powder. All of these have a distinct shoulder that closely resembles modern cartridges, and with the exception of the Lebel they are still chambered in modern firearms even though the cartridges are over a century old.

===Aspect ratio and consistency===
When selecting a rifle cartridge for maximum accuracy, a short, fat cartridge with very little case taper may yield higher efficiency and more consistent velocity than a long, thin cartridge with a lot of case taper (part of the reason for a bottle-necked design). Given current trends towards shorter and fatter cases, such as the new Winchester Super Short Magnum cartridges, it appears the ideal might be a case approaching spherical inside. Target and vermin hunting rounds require the greatest accuracy, so their cases tend to be short, fat, and nearly untapered with sharp shoulders on the case. Short, fat cases also allow short-action weapons to be made lighter and stronger for the same level of performance. The trade-off for this performance is fat rounds which take up more space in a magazine, sharp shoulders that do not feed as easily out of a magazine, and less reliable extraction of the spent round. For these reasons, when reliable feeding is more important than accuracy, such as with military rifles, longer cases with shallower shoulder angles are favored. There has been a long-term trend however, even among military weapons, towards shorter, fatter cases. The current 7.62√ó51mm NATO case replacing the longer .30-06 Springfield is a good example, as is the new 6.5 Grendel cartridge designed to increase the performance of the AR-15 family of rifles and carbines. Nevertheless, there is significantly more to accuracy and cartridge lethality than the length and diameter of the case, and the 7.62√ó51mm NATO has a smaller case capacity than the .30-06 Springfield, reducing the amount of propellant that can be used, directly reducing the bullet weight and muzzle velocity combination that contributes to lethality, (as detailed in the published cartridge specifications linked herein for comparison). The 6.5 Grendel, on the other hand, is capable of firing a significantly heavier bullet (see link) than the 5.56 NATO out of the AR-15 family of weapons, with only a slight decrease in muzzle velocity, perhaps providing a more advantageous performance tradeoff.

==Friction and inertia==
===Static friction and ignition===
Since the burning rate of smokeless powder varies directly with the pressure, the initial pressure buildup,(i.e. &quot;the shot-start pressure&quot;), has a significant effect on the final velocity, especially in large cartridges with very fast powders and relatively light weight projectiles. In small caliber firearms, the friction holding the bullet in the case, determines how soon after ignition the bullet moves, and since the motion of the bullet increases the volume and drops the pressure, a difference in friction can change the slope of the pressure curve. In general, a tight fit is desired, to the extent of crimping the bullet into the case. In straight-walled rimless cases, such as the .45 ACP, an aggressive crimp is not possible, since the case is held in the chamber by the mouth of the case, but sizing the case to allow a tight interference fit with the bullet, can give the desired result. In larger caliber firearms, the shot start pressure is often determined by the force required to initially engrave the projectile driving band into the start of the barrel rifling; smoothbore guns, which do not have rifling, achieve shot start pressure by initially driving the projectile into a &quot;forcing cone&quot; that provides resistance as it compresses the projectile obturation ring.

===Kinetic friction===
The bullet must tightly fit the bore to seal the high pressure of the burning gunpowder. This tight fit results in a large frictional force. The friction of the bullet in the bore does have a slight impact on the final velocity, but that is generally not much of a concern. Of greater concern is the heat that is generated due to the friction. At velocities of about , lead begins to melt, and deposit in the bore. This lead build-up constricts the bore, increasing the pressure and decreasing the accuracy of subsequent rounds, and is difficult to scrub out without damaging the bore. Rounds, used at velocities up to , can use wax lubricants on the bullet to reduce lead build-up. At velocities over , nearly all bullets are jacketed in copper, or a similar alloy that is soft enough not to wear on the barrel, but melts at a high enough temperature to reduce build-up in the bore. Copper build-up does begin to occur in rounds that exceed , and a common solution is to impregnate the surface of the bullet with molybdenum disulfide lubricant. This reduces copper build-up in the bore, and results in better long-term accuracy. Large caliber projectiles also employ copper driving bands for rifled barrels for spin-stabilized projectiles; however, fin-stabilized projectiles fired from both rifle and smoothbore barrels, such as the APFSDS anti-armor projectiles, employ nylon obturation rings that are sufficient to seal high pressure propellant gasses and also minimize in-bore friction, providing a small boost to muzzle velocity.

===The role of inertia===
In the first few centimeters of travel down the bore, the bullet reaches a significant percentage of its final velocity, even for high-capacity rifles, with slow burning powder. The acceleration is on the order of tens of thousands of gravities, so even a projectile as light as can provide over of resistance due to inertia. Changes in bullet mass, therefore, have a huge impact on the pressure curves of smokeless powder cartridges, unlike black-powder cartridges. The loading or reloading of smokeless cartridges thus requires high-precision equipment, and carefully measured tables of load data for given cartridges, powders, and bullet weights.

==Pressure-velocity relationships==
Energy is imparted to the bullet in a firearm by the pressure of gases produced by burning propellant. While higher pressures produce higher velocities, pressure duration is also important. Peak pressure may represent only a small fraction of the time the bullet is accelerating. The entire duration of the bullet&#x27;s travel through the barrel must be considered.

===Peak vs area===
Energy is the ability to do work on an object. Work is force applied over a distance. The total energy imparted to a bullet is indicated by the area under a curve with the y-axis being force (i.e., the pressure exerted on the base of the bullet multiplied by the area of the base of the bullet) and the x-axis being distance. Increasing the energy of the bullet requires increasing the area under that curve, either by raising the pressure, or increasing the distance the bullet travels under pressure. Pressure is limited by the strength of the firearm, and duration is limited by barrel length.

==Propellant design==
Propellants are matched to firearm strength, chamber volume and barrel length; and bullet material, weight and dimensions. The rate of gas generation is proportional to the surface area of burning propellant grains in accordance with Piobert&#x27;s Law. Smokeless propellant reactions occur in a series of zones or phases as the reaction proceeds from the surface into the solid. The deepest portion of the solid experiencing heat transfer melts and begins phase transition from solid to gas in a &quot;foam zone&quot;. The gaseous propellant decomposes into simpler molecules in a surrounding &quot;fizz zone&quot;. Endothermic transformations in the &quot;foam zone&quot; and &quot;fizz zone&quot; require energy initially provided by the primer and subsequently released in a luminous outer &quot;flame zone&quot; where the simpler gas molecules react to form conventional combustion products like steam and carbon monoxide.

The heat transfer rate of smokeless propellants increases with pressure, resulting in the rate of gas generation from a given grain surface area increased at higher pressures. Accelerating gas generation from fast burning propellants may rapidly create a destructively high pressure spike before bullet movement increases reaction volume. Conversely, propellants designed for a minimum heat transfer pressure may cease decomposition into gaseous reactants if bullet movement decreases pressure before a slow burning propellant has been consumed. Unburned propellant grains may remain in the barrel if the energy-releasing &quot;flame zone&quot; cannot be sustained in the resultant absence of gaseous reactants from the inner zones.

===Propellant burnout===

Another issue to consider, when choosing a powder burn rate, is the time the powder takes to completely burn vs. the time the bullet spends in the barrel. Looking carefully at the left graph, there is a change in the curve, at about 0.8 ms. This is the point at which the powder is completely burned, and no new gas is created. With a faster powder, burnout occurs earlier, and with the slower powder, it occurs later. Propellant that is unburned when the bullet reaches the muzzle is wasted ‚Äî it adds no energy to the bullet, but it does add to the recoil and muzzle blast. For maximum power, the powder should burn until the bullet is just short of the muzzle.

Since smokeless powders burn, not detonate, the reaction can only take place on the surface of the powder. Smokeless powders come in a variety of shapes, which serve to determine how fast they burn, and also how the burn rate changes as the powder burns. The simplest shape is a ball powder, which is in the form of round or slightly flattened spheres. Ball powder has a comparatively small surface-area-to-volume ratio, so it burns comparatively slowly, and as it burns, its surface area decreases. This means as the powder burns, the burn rate slows down.

To some degree, this can be offset by the use of a retardant coating on the surface of the powder, which slows the initial burn rate and flattens out the rate of change. Ball powders are generally formulated as slow pistol powders, or fast rifle powders.

Flake powders are in the form of flat, round flakes which have a relatively high surface-area-to-volume ratio. Flake powders have a nearly constant rate of burn, and are usually formulated as fast pistol or shotgun powders. The last common shape is an extruded powder, which is in the form of a cylinder, sometimes hollow. Extruded powders generally have a lower ratio of nitroglycerin to nitrocellulose, and are often progressive burning ‚Äî that is, they burn at a faster rate as they burn. Extruded powders are generally medium to slow rifle powders.

==General concerns==

===Bore diameter and energy transfer===

A firearm, in many ways, is like a piston engine on the power stroke. There is a certain amount of high-pressure gas available, and energy is extracted from it by making the gas move a piston ‚Äî in this case, the projectile is the piston. The swept volume of the piston determines how much energy can be extracted from the given gas. The more volume that is swept by the piston, the lower is the exhaust pressure (in this case, the muzzle pressure). Any remaining pressure at the muzzle or at the end of the engine&#x27;s power stroke represents lost energy.

To extract the maximum amount of energy, then, the swept volume is maximized. This can be done in one of two ways ‚Äî increasing the length of the barrel or increasing the diameter of the projectile. Increasing the barrel length will increase the swept volume linearly, while increasing the diameter will increase the swept volume as the square of the diameter. Since barrel length is limited by practical concerns to about arm&#x27;s length for a rifle and much shorter for a handgun, increasing bore diameter is the normal way to increase the efficiency of a cartridge. The limit to bore diameter is generally the sectional density of the projectile (see external ballistics). Larger-diameter bullets of the same weight have much more drag, and so they lose energy more quickly after exiting the barrel. In general, most handguns use bullets between .355 (9¬†mm) and .45 (11.5¬†mm) caliber, while most rifles generally range from .223 (5.56¬†mm) to .32 (8¬†mm) caliber. There are many exceptions, of course, but bullets in the given ranges provide the best general-purpose performance. Handguns use the larger-diameter bullets for greater efficiency in short barrels, and tolerate the long-range velocity loss since handguns are seldom used for long-range shooting. Handguns designed for long-range shooting are generally closer to shortened rifles than to other handguns.

===Ratio of propellant to projectile mass===
Another issue, when choosing or developing a cartridge, is the issue of recoil. The recoil is not just the reaction from the projectile being launched, but also from the powder gas, which will exit the barrel with a velocity even higher than that of the bullet. For handgun cartridges, with heavy bullets and light powder charges (a 9√ó19mm, for example, might use of powder, and a bullet), the powder recoil is not a significant force; for a rifle cartridge (a .22-250 Remington, using of powder and a bullet), the powder can be the majority of the recoil force.

There is a solution to the recoil issue, though it is not without cost. A muzzle brake or recoil compensator is a device which redirects the powder gas at the muzzle, usually up and back. This acts like a rocket, pushing the muzzle down and forward. The forward push helps negate the feel of the projectile recoil by pulling the firearm forwards. The downward push, on the other hand, helps counteract the rotation imparted by the fact that most firearms have the barrel mounted above the center of gravity. Overt combat guns, large-bore high-powered rifles, long-range handguns chambered for rifle ammunition, and action-shooting handguns designed for accurate rapid fire, all benefit from muzzle brakes.

The high-powered firearms use the muzzle brake mainly for recoil reduction, which reduces the battering of the shooter by the severe recoil. The action-shooting handguns redirect all the energy up to counteract the rotation of the recoil, and make following shots faster by leaving the gun on target. The disadvantage of the muzzle brake is a longer, heavier barrel, and a large increase in sound levels and flash behind the muzzle of the rifle. Shooting firearms without muzzle brakes and without hearing protection can eventually damage the operator&#x27;s hearing; however, shooting rifles with muzzle brakes - with or without hearing protection - causes permanent ear damage. (See muzzle brake for more on the disadvantages of muzzle brakes.)

Powder-to-projectile-weight ratio also touches on the subject of efficiency. In the case of the .22-250 Remington, more energy goes into propelling the powder gas than goes into propelling the bullet. The .22-250 pays for this by requiring a large case, with much powder, all for a fairly small gain in velocity and energy over other .22 caliber cartridges.

===Accuracy and bore characteristics===
Nearly all small bore firearms, with the exception of shotguns, have rifled barrels. The rifling imparts a spin on the bullet, which keeps it from tumbling in flight. The rifling is usually in the form of sharp edged grooves cut as helices along the axis of the bore, anywhere from 2 to 16 in number. The areas between the grooves are known as lands.

Another system, polygonal rifling, gives the bore a polygonal cross section. Polygonal rifling is not very common, used by only a few European manufacturers as well as the American gun manufacturer Kahr Arms. The companies that use polygonal rifling claim greater accuracy, lower friction, and less lead and/or copper buildup in the barrel. Traditional land and groove rifling is used in most competition firearms, however, so the advantages of polygonal rifling are unproven.

There are four methods of rifling a barrel:
* A single point cutter is drawn down the bore by a machine that controls the rotation of the cutting head relative to the barrel. This is the slowest process, but requires the simplest equipment. It is often used by custom gunsmiths as it can result in very accurate barrels.
* Button rifling uses a die with a negative image of the rifling cut on it which is drawn down the barrel while rotated, swaging the inside of the barrel. This creates all the grooves at once by deformation, and is faster than cut rifling. 
* Hammer forging is a process in which a slightly oversized, bored barrel is placed around a mandrel that contains a negative image of the length of the rifled barrel. The barrel and mandrel are rotated and hammered by power hammers, which forms the inside of the barrel. This is the fastest and often cheapest method of making a barrel, but the equipment is expensive. Hammer-forged barrels are generally not capable of the accuracy attainable with the first two methods mentioned.
* Electrical discharge machining (EDM) or Electro chemical machining (ECM) processes use electricity to erode away material, a process which produces a highly consistent diameter and very smooth finish, with less stress than other rifling methods. EDM is very costly and primarily used in large bore, long barrel cannon where traditional methods are very difficult, while ECM is used by some smaller barrel makers.

The purpose of the barrel is to provide a consistent seal, allowing the bullet to accelerate to a consistent velocity. It must also impart the right spin, and release the bullet consistently, perfectly concentric to the bore. The residual pressure in the bore must be released symmetrically, so that no side of the bullet receives any more or less push than the rest. 

To maintain a good pressure seal, the bore must be a precise constant diameter, or have a slight decrease in diameter from breech to muzzle. Any increase in bore diameter will allow the bullet to shift, allowing gas to leak past the bullet, decreasing velocity, or cause the bullet to tip so that it is no longer perfectly coaxial with the bore. High quality barrels are lapped to remove any constrictions in the bore which will cause a change in diameter.

A lapping process known as &quot;fire lapping&quot; uses a lead &quot;slug&quot; that is slightly larger than the bore and covered in fine abrasive compound to cut out the constrictions. The slug is passed from breech to muzzle to remove obstructions. Many passes are made, and as the bore becomes more uniform, finer grades of abrasive compound are used. The final result is a barrel that is mirror-smooth, and with a consistent or slightly tapering bore. The hand-lapping technique uses a wooden or soft metal rod to pull or push the slug through the bore, while the newer fire-lapping technique uses specially loaded, low-power cartridges to push abrasive-covered soft-lead bullets down the barrel.

Another issue that has an effect on the barrel&#x27;s hold on the bullet is the rifling. When the bullet is fired, it is forced into the rifling, which cuts or &quot;engraves&quot; the surface of the bullet. If the rifling is a constant twist, then the rifling rides in the grooves engraved in the bullet, and everything is secure and sealed. If the rifling has a decreasing twist, then the changing angle of the rifling in the engraved grooves of the bullet causes the rifling to become narrower than the grooves. This allows gas to blow by, and loosens the hold of the bullet on the barrel. An increasing twist, however, will make the rifling become wider than the grooves in the bullet, maintaining the seal. When a rifled-barrel blank is selected for a gun, the higher-twist end is located at the muzzle.

The muzzle of the barrel is the last thing to touch the bullet before it goes into ballistic flight, and as such has the greatest potential to disrupt the bullet&#x27;s flight. The muzzle must allow the gas to escape the barrel symmetrically; any asymmetry will cause an uneven pressure on the base of the bullet, which will disrupt its flight. The muzzle end of the barrel is called the &quot;crown&quot;, and it is usually either beveled or recessed to protect it from bumps or scratches that might affect accuracy. 

Before the barrel can release the bullet in a consistent manner, it must grip the bullet in a consistent manner. The part of the barrel between where the bullet exits the cartridge, and engages the rifling, is called the &quot;throat&quot;, and the length of the throat is the freebore. In some firearms, the freebore is zero as the act of chambering the cartridge forces the bullet into the rifling. This is common in low-powered rimfire target rifles. The placement of the bullet in the rifling ensures that the transition between cartridge and rifling is quick and stable. The downside is that the cartridge is firmly held in place, and attempting to extract the unfired round can be difficult, to the point of even pulling the bullet from the cartridge in extreme cases.

With high-powered cartridges, a significant amount of force is required to engrave the bullet which can raise the pressure in the chamber above the maximum design pressure. Higher-powered rifles usually have a longer freebore so that the bullet is allowed to gain some momentum, allowing the and the chamber pressure to drop slightly before the bullet engages the rifling. However, any slight misalignment can cause the bullet to tip as it engages the rifling, resulting in the bullet does not entering the barrel coaxially.

===Revolver-specific issues===

The defining characteristic of a revolver is the revolving cylinder, separate from the barrel, that contains the chambers. Revolvers typically have 5 to 10 chambers, and the first issue is ensuring consistency among the chambers, because if they aren&#x27;t consistent then the point of impact will vary from chamber to chamber. The chambers must also align consistently with the barrel, so the bullet enters the barrel the same way from each chamber.

The throat in a revolver is composed of two separate parts, the cylinder throat and the barrel throat. part of the cylinder and sized so that it is concentric to the chamber and very slightly over the bullet diameter. The cylinder gap - the space between the cylinder and barrel - must be wide enough to allow free rotation of the cylinder even when it becomes fouled with powder residue, but not so large that excessive gas is released. The forcing cone - where the bullet is guided from the cylinder into the bore of the barrel - should be deep enough to force the bullet into the bore without significant deformation. Unlike rifles, where the threaded portion of the barrel is in the chamber, revolver barrels threads surround the breech end of the bore. It is possible that the bore is compressed when the barrel is screwed into the frame. Cutting a longer forcing cone can relieve this &quot;choke&quot; point, as can lapping of the barrel after it is fitted to the frame.

<text>Uran is a coastal town in Raigad District&#x27;s Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra state in Konkan division. It lies to the east of Mumbai across the Dharamtar Creek. Uran is primarily a fishing and agriculture village, which has developed into the special economic zone of Uran. The primary languages spoken are Agri and Koli which is a dialect of Marathi-Konkani.

==History==
The city name is derived from the Hindu goddess Uranavati. It was called Uruvan during the rule of Madhavrao I, the fourth Peshwa of the Maratha Empire. Later, the area was named Uran by the Portuguese and Ooran by the British.

Many Indian dynasties have ruled the area. In early history, these included the Maurya Empire, SƒÅtavƒÅhana Empire, Western Kshatrapas, VƒÅkƒÅ·π≠aka Empire, Chalukyas, and Yadavas.

The area around Mumbai, including Uran, was under Portuguese and British rule in the 16th to 19th centuries.

Uran was subject to the Maratha princely states in the Maharashtra. Uran was once the base of the famous Maratha &quot;Sarkhel&quot; (Admiral) Kanhoji Angre, who battled European naval interests in the 18th century.

==Geography==
Uran is located at . Uran is at an average elevation of .

On the tip of a peninsula, Uran district is surrounded by sea on three sides. The town of Uran itself is centrally located on the peninsula, flanked by Karanja village to the south and Mora village and port to the north.

Uran is home to extensive salt pans, part of a long-standing network of salt manufacturing around Mumbai. The land has been under redevelopment pressure.

The Uran wetlands were once home to many species of birds and reptiles, some critically endangered. The wetlands were developed in 2009 and 2010, leaving only the Panje-Dongri wetlands.

Uran consists of multiple smaller villages and can be divided into South, North and West parts. 

Villages in Southern Uran:


==Economy==
The main occupation in Uran is fishing; 80% of the fish production of Mumbai comes from fishermen based out of the Uran in Navi Mumbai, especially the villages of Karanja and Mora.

The second major occupation is farming. Uran contributes to the production of rice in the Raigad district. Raigad is the second largest district in terms of rice production in India.

Shipping, shipbuilding, and port support are major economic factors in Uran district. Jawaharlal Nehru Port (JNPT) is the largest container terminal in India. Other container terminals in the Uran district include APM Terminals (formerly GTI) and DP World (formerly the British Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company). Salt pan owners revolted against the government decision to build a seaport, but the port has proved to be the main source of income to residents and nearby villages, as major projects and warehouses have opened nearby.

The Indian Navy maintains a naval base near Mora. Due to Security reasons sea travel restrictions is imposed by the Indian Navy .

<text>A bearded axe, or Skegg√∏x (from Old Norse &quot;Skegg&quot;, &quot;beard&quot;, and &quot;√∏x&quot;, &quot;axe&quot;), is any of various axes, used as a tool and weapon, as early as the 6th century AD. It is most commonly associated with Viking Age Scandinavians. The hook or &quot;beard&quot;, i.e. the lower portion of the axe bit extending the cutting edge below the width of the butt, provides a wide cutting surface while keeping the overall mass of the axe low. 

This design allows the user to grip the haft directly behind the head for planing or shaving wood and variations of this design are still in use by modern woodworkers and some foresters. The &quot;beard&quot; of the axe would also have been useful in battle, for example to pull a weapon or shield out of a defender&#x27;s grasp.

Through Scandinavian mercenaries fighting in the Varangian Guard, the design entered the Byzantine Empire. After the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople, the Sultan&#x27;s guard adopted axes of similar design to underline their continuity with the Byzantine Empire. In the 15th century, these axes would evolve into single-handed bearded axes with a hammerhead on the head. Through Ottoman influence, these axes would spread to Poland and Hungary, where they would become known as &quot;Czekan.&quot;

There are a number of variants in its design.

<doc id="833586" wikidata="Q4132754" url="?curid=833586" title="Ventura County Line">
<text>The Metrolink Ventura County Line is a commuter rail line serving Ventura County and the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles County and the City of Los Angeles, in the Southern California system. The line is the successor of the short lived CalTrain commuter rail line.

== Schedules ==
, the Ventura County Line is served by 20 Metrolink trains (ten in each direction) each weekday, running primarily at peak hours in the peak direction of travel.

However, of those trains, only six trains (three in each direction) travel the entire length of the line between Los Angeles and Ventura‚ÄìEast station. Sixteen trains (eight in each direction) short turn, traveling only between Los Angeles and Moorpark station, while 20 trains (ten in each direction) travel between Los Angeles and Chatsworth station.

Two round trips operate on weekends over the entire length of the line. Metrolink passengers (except those at Ventura‚ÄìEast station) also have access to four &quot;Pacific Surfliner&quot; trains (two in each direction) each day through a codeshare agreement.

==Tracks==
The line operates between Moorpark and Los Angeles Union Station on tracks owned by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority ‚Äì the Ventura Subdivision from Moorpark to Burbank Airport and the Valley Subdivision, the Valley Subdivision from Burbank to Glendale, becoming the River Subdivision into Los Angeles Union Station. It uses the Coast Line of the Union Pacific Railroad between Moorpark and Oxnard and into Ventura where the Santa Paula Branch splits from the rest of the Coast Line. Ventura‚ÄìEast station and layover facility are on the Santa Paula Branch Line.

==History==

The railway was originally constructed by the Southern Pacific Railroad as their Coast Line, connecting Los Angeles to San Francisco. The Montalvo Cutoff between Burbank and Ventura via the Simi Valley was built in 1904, bypassing the old line further to the north. Caltrans ran commuter rail service over the line very briefly in 1982 and 1983, but CalTrain was unsustainable due to a number of factors.

In 1990 the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, predecessor of Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, acquired a portion of the right-of-way between Los Angeles and Moorpark from Southern Pacific and transferred it to the newly formed Southern California Regional Rail Authority for commuter service. 

The line began operations in 1992 as one of Metrolink&#x27;s original three routes, with service from Moorpark to Los Angeles Union Station in Downtown Los Angeles. Service was extended to Camarillo and Oxnard in 1994 after the 1994 Northridge earthquake, then to Ventura in 2002.

Because Amtrak trains operate on the same corridor all day, every day, Metrolink did not operate weekend service on the line. As part of a six-month trial program to determine demand, Metrolink added Saturday service on April 6, 2020. Permanent Saturday service started on May 29, 2021, with one round trip between LA Union Station and Moorpark. Service was extended to Ventura‚ÄìEast on August 9, 2021. 

Metrolink established a code sharing agreement with Amtrak, allowing all Metrolink passengers to ride select Pacific Surfliner trains with any ticket or pass, starting April 4, 2022. The code sharing agreement adds one more morning and early afternoon trip to Ventura, expanding midday and Saturday service, and establishing &quot;de facto&quot; Sunday service on the line.

===Accidents===

====2008 Chatsworth train collision====

At 4:23¬†p.m. on September 12, 2008, 25 people were killed in a collision between Metrolink commuter train 111 and a freight train. At least 130 people were injured, with at least one dying later at a hospital. The crash occurred on the Ventura County Line near Heather Lee Lane, south of the Ronald Reagan Freeway(SR-118) and east of Topanga Canyon Boulevard. Both locomotives, the leading car of the commuter train, and seven cars of the freight train were derailed.

====2015 Oxnard train derailment====

On February 24, 2015, according to Oxnard Police Sergeant Denise Shadinger, a Metrolink commuter train traveling from Ventura County to Los Angeles hit a road vehicle near Oxnard, California; she initially said there was an unspecified number of injuries. The incident was reported at 5:44 A.M. Three cars derailed, at least one vehicle was fully engulfed at some point, and the three derailed cars were on their sides; the locomotive was still upright. Little but scorched, mangled wreckage in an intersection and on the tracks was left of the truck; Oxnard Fire Department battalion chief Sergio Martinez said the driver fled the scene unhurt but was found and taken into custody. News helicopters and footage from ABC affiliate KABC showed footage of triage tarps lying in the 5th Street (SR 34) where on-scene firefighters were treating victims and monitoring the scene. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), in a tweet, acknowledged the incident and stated they were launching an investigation. The train engineer died a week later and 29 others were injured. A week after the incident, an Amtrak train collided with a vehicle in the same area as the first crash.

==Stations==
==Future development==
The Santa Barbara County Association of Governments is interested in expanding Metrolink service into the county. Following a meeting on May 8, 2024, the agency&#x27;s board of directors directed its staff toward preparing a formal agreement with Ventura County. The proposed one-year pilot program would add an early-morning northbound train between Moorpark and with intermediate stops at Camarillo, Oxnard, , , and , as well a mid-morning southbound return train with the same intermediate stops but also continuing nonstop to L.A. Union Station.

<text>The Aerial Achievement Medal (AAM) is a decoration of the United States Air Force and United States Space Force which was established in 1988. The decoration is intended to recognize the contributions of aircrew members who would, otherwise, not be qualified for the award of the Air Medal.

The decoration is awarded in the name of the Secretary of the Air Force and is presented to members of the United States military or civilian personnel, while serving in a capacity with the U.S. Air Force, who distinguish themselves by sustained meritorious achievement while participating in aerial flight. The achievements must be accomplished with distinction above and beyond that normally expected of professional airmen.

Pilots/sensors of Unmanned aerial vehicles may also receive this award. One was given in 1997 for successfully flying a disabled UAV back to its base. According to a report based on Air Force statistics, from January 2009 to mid-2010 3497 medals were granted to operators, while 1408 more were given to pilots.

The Aerial Achievement Medal may be approved by local commanders; however, the missions for which the decoration is authorized must be approved by a Major Air Force Command.

Minimum requirements for an Aerial Achievement Medal are 20 flights of at least 2 hours with one flight per theater per day. For the basic Aerial Achievement medal, 14 flights may be used. However, if this is the case, then 26 flights must be used for the first Oak Leaf Cluster.

Enlisted personnel receive three (3) promotion points per award.

The Aerial Achievement Medal service ribbon bears a resemblance to the Air Crew Europe Star ribbon.

<text>The Lost World is a science fiction novel by British writer Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton in 1912, concerning an expedition to a plateau in the Amazon basin of South America where prehistoric animals still survive. It was originally published serially in the &quot;Strand Magazine&quot; and illustrated by New-Zealand-born artist Harry Rountree during the months of April‚ÄìNovember 1912. The character of Professor Challenger was introduced in this book. The novel also describes a war between indigenous people and a vicious tribe of ape-like creatures.

== Plot summary ==
Edward Malone, a young reporter for the &quot;Daily Gazette&quot;, asks his editor for a dangerous assignment to impress the woman he loves, Gladys, who wishes for a great man capable of brave deeds and actions. His task is to approach the notorious Professor Challenger, who dislikes the popular press intensely and physically assaults intrusive journalists. The subject is to be his recent South American expedition which, surrounded by controversy, guarantees a hostile reaction. As a direct approach would be instantly rebuffed, Malone instead masquerades as an earnest student. On meeting the professor he is startled by his intimidating physique, but believes his ruse is succeeding. However, Challenger had really seen through the masquerade, and after confirming Malone‚Äôs scientific knowledge is non-existent, erupts in anger and forcibly throws him out. 

However, Malone earns his respect by refusing to press charges with a policeman who saw his violent ejection into the street. Challenger ushers him back inside and, extracting promises of confidentiality, eventually reveals he has discovered living dinosaurs in South America, following up an expedition by a now-deceased previous American explorer named Maple White. At a tumultuous public meeting in which Challenger experiences further ridicule (most notably from a professional rival, Professor Summerlee), Malone volunteers for an expedition to verify the discoveries. His companions are to be Professor Summerlee, and Lord John Roxton, an adventurer who helped end slavery on the Amazon; the notches on his rifle showing how many slavers he killed doing so.

Running the gauntlet of hostile tribes, the expedition finally reaches the lost world with the aid of indigenous guides, who are superstitiously scared of the area. Summerlee retains his scepticism, despite being delighted at making other scientific discoveries in the fields of botany and entomology: even a glimpse of a pterodactyl at a distance fails to convince him, because he believes it is some species of stork. The sharper-eyed Roxton is inclined to agree it is not a stork but has no clue what it really is, until a night-time encounter when it flies down and is seen by all at close range, as it steals the companions‚Äô dinner. After this, Summerlee apologises to Challenger. The cliffs to the plateau itself prove to be apparently unscalable, but an adjacent pinnacle turns out to be climbable, and moreover, has a tall tree which can be cut down and used as a bridge, which allows the four explorers to cross to the plateau. 

However, they are almost immediately trapped on it, thanks to the treachery of one of their luggage-porters, Gomez‚Äîwho, as it turns out, is a former slaver whose brother had previously been killed by Roxton during his anti-slavery activities-. He takes his revenge by dropping the tree off the cliff, stranding the explorers on the plateau. Roxton shoots Gomez and they hear the scream and then the thud of the falling body. The other guide is subsequently killed by another porter, a formerly enslaved black man named Zambo, who remains loyal to the party: but the latter is unable to do much more to help, other than send some of the company&#x27;s supplies over by rope.

Whilst investigating the wonders of the lost world, discovering many plants and creatures thought to be extinct including Iguanodons, they narrowly escape an attack from pterodactyls. Although barely escaping with their lives, Roxton takes great interest in nearby blue clay deposits. At night a ferocious Megalosaurus is about to break through the thorn bushes surrounding their camp; Roxton averts disaster by bravely dashing at it, thrusting a blazing torch at its face to scare it away. The night after, Malone studies fauna near the central lake including a Stegosaurus, and escapes the same Megalosaurus. Meanwhile, the others are captured by a race of &quot;ape-men&quot;. 

Whilst in captivity, they discover that a tribe of indigenous people, with whom the &quot;ape-men&quot; are at war, inhabit the other side of the plateau. Roxton escapes and together with Malone mounts a rescue, preventing many unpleasant deaths, including a young indigenous man who is a prince of his tribe. The rescued indigenous people take the party to their village, then with the help of their firepower return to defeat the &quot;ape-men&quot;. After witnessing the power of their guns, the tribe wish to keep them on the plateau but, helped by the young prince they saved, they eventually discover a tunnel leading back to the outside world. During their time with the tribe, Roxton plans how to capture a pterodactyl chick, and succeeds in doing so.

Upon return to England, despite full reports from Malone many detractors continue to dismiss the expedition&#x27;s account, much as they had Challenger&#x27;s original story‚Äîalthough Summerlee, having been on the expedition, has now switched sides and is supporting Challenger. Anticipating this, at a public meeting at Queen&#x27;s Hall Challenger produces the young pterodactyl as proof, transfixing the audience and leaving them in no doubt of the truth. The explorers are instantly feted as heroes, and on a wave of adulation find themselves carried shoulder-high from the hall by cheering crowds. The pterodactyl, in the confusion, makes its escape and is witnessed several times at different locations around London, causing consternation wherever it goes, but is last seen heading off to the southwest in the probable direction of its home.

At a private celebratory dinner, Roxton reveals to the others that the blue clay contained diamonds. He had been tipped off to the possibility, by the recollection of a similar feature in South Africa, and managed to extract about ¬£200,000 worth (¬£23 million in 2021), which is to be split between them. Challenger plans to open a private museum with his share. Summerlee plans to retire and categorise fossils. Malone returns to his love, Gladys, hoping she will recognise his achievements. Instead, he finds she has now changed her mind and married a very ordinary man instead, an insignificant clerk. Astonished at this turn of events, and with nothing to keep him in London, he decides to accompany Roxton back to the lost world.

==References in other works==
In addition to lending its title to this subgenre, the title of Doyle&#x27;s work was reused by Michael Crichton in his 1995 novel &quot;The Lost World&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, and its film adaptation, &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;. Two of the characters in Crichton&#x27;s novel mention a palaeontologist called John Roxton.

Greg Bear&#x27;s 1998 novel &quot;Dinosaur Summer&quot; is a sequel to &quot;The Lost World&quot;, set in an alternate history 1947. In the context of Bear&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Lost World&quot; was a nonfiction work published by Doyle as recounted to him by Professor Challenger.

==References to actual history, geography and current science==
The characters of Ed Malone and Lord John Roxton were modelled, respectively, on the journalist E. D. Morel and the diplomat Roger Casement, leaders of the Congo Free State reform campaign (the Congo Reform Association), which Doyle supported. In 1911, just when Doyle was writing the book, Casement made a second such anti-slavery reform campaign in the Amazonian part of Peru. It is possible that Malone was also based on Bertram Fletcher Robinson, a close friend of Doyle&#x27;s, because like Robinson, Malone was raised in the West Country, exceeded six¬†feet in height, became an accomplished rugby union player, worked as a London-based journalist, and he loved a woman called Gladys.

Doyle was aware of his good friend Percy Harrison Fawcett&#x27;s expedition to the Huanchaca Plateau in Noel Kempff Mercado National Park, Bolivia. Fawcett organised several expeditions to delimit the border between Bolivia and Brazil ‚Äì an area of potential conflict between both countries. Doyle attended Fawcett&#x27;s lecture to the Royal Geographical Society on 13 February 1911 and was impressed by the tale about the remote &quot;province of Caupolican&quot; (present day Huanchaca Plateau) in Bolivia ‚Äì a dangerous area with impenetrable forests, where Fawcett saw &quot;monstrous tracks of unknown origin&quot;.

Fawcett wrote in his posthumously published memoirs: &quot;Monsters from the dawn of Man&#x27;s existence might still roam these heights unchallenged, imprisoned and protected by unscalable cliffs. So thought Conan Doyle when later in London I spoke of these hills and showed photographs of them. He mentioned an idea for a novel on Central South America and asked for information, which I told him I should be glad to supply. The fruit of it was his &quot;Lost World&quot; in 1912, appearing as a serial in the &quot;Strand Magazine&quot;, and subsequently in the form of a book that achieved widespread popularity.&quot;

A 1996 &quot;Science Fiction Studies&quot; review of an annotated edition of the novel suggested that another inspiration for the story may have been the 1890s contested political history of the Pacaraima Mountains plateaux, and Mount Roraima in particular.

<text>Humphrey Edward Gregory Atkins, Baron Colnbrook, (12 August 1922 ‚Äì 4 October 1996) was a British politician and a member of the Conservative Party. He served for 32 years as a Member of Parliament (MP), and served in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher from 1979 to 1982.

== Early life ==
Atkins was born on 12 August 1922, in Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire, son of Captain Edward Davis Atkins and Violet Mary (). His family spent his first few years in Kenya, returning to England after his father died from being attacked by a rhinoceros. Atkins was educated at Wellington College, Berkshire, and served in the Royal Navy from 1940 to 1948.

In 1944, Atkins married Margaret Spencer-Nairn. They had four children, three daughters and one son. He worked for Nairn&#x27;s, his wife&#x27;s family&#x27;s linoleum business in Kirkcaldy, Scotland, then became a director of a financial advertising agency.

==Political career==
Atkins contested the constituency of West Lothian in 1951, and was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Merton and Morden in 1955. He became MP for Spelthorne in 1970.

Atkins was the Conservative Chief Whip from 1973 to 1979, and served as a Secretary of State for Northern Ireland from 1979 to 1981. In September 1981, he was appointed as Lord Privy Seal, which was a role as the chief government spokesman in the House of Commons for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. This role was necessary because the Foreign Secretary, Lord Carrington, sat in the House of Lords. He resigned in April 1982, along with Lord Carrington, over the Falklands invasion.

Atkins was appointed to the Order of St Michael and St George as a Knight Commander (KCMG) in the 1983 Dissolution Honours. He left the House of Commons in 1987 and was created a life peer on 16 October as Baron Colnbrook, &quot;of Waltham St Lawrence in the Royal County of Berkshire.

==Death==
Atkins died from cancer on 4 October 1996, aged 74, at home in Waltham St Lawrence, Berkshire.

<doc id="833596" wikidata="Q312037" url="?curid=833596" title="STS-121">
<text>STS-121 was a 2006 Space Shuttle mission to the International Space Station (ISS) flown by on its 32nd flight. The main purposes of the mission were to test new safety and repair techniques introduced following the &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster of February 2003 as well as to deliver supplies, equipment and German European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut Thomas Reiter to the ISS.

After two weather-related delays, the shuttle successfully launched on Tuesday, July 4, 2006, at 14:37:55 EDT. It was the first and only shuttle launch on the United States&#x27; Independence Day. The mission lasted for 13 days before landing at the Kennedy Space Center on July 17, 2006, at 09:14:43 EDT.

STS-121 was also designated the ISS Assembly Mission ULF 1.1. As the mission followed on from STS-114 in carrying out the recommendations made in response to the &quot;Columbia&quot; Accident Investigation Board report, it was considered a Return to Flight test mission. Its successful launch and landing led NASA to fully resume regular Space Shuttle launches in the construction of the ISS.

== Crew ==
=== Crew notes ===
Thomas Reiter&#x27;s position was previously planned to be filled by Sergey Volkov (Russia) before the launch of STS-121 was postponed until July 2006.

British-born astronaut Piers Sellers replaced Carlos Noriega who was originally scheduled to be on the STS-121 mission NASA announced on Thursday, July 15, 2004. This was due to an undisclosed, temporary medical condition.

The transfer of Reiter to the ISS returned the station to a three crew member staffing level. After the loss of &quot;Columbia&quot; and the grounding of the Shuttle fleet, only two people had been residing on the ISS.

== Shuttle hardware ==
* External Tank: ET-119
* Solid Rocket Boosters: BI-126 &amp; RSRM-93
* SSMEs: s/n 2045, 2051, 2056
* OMS engines: LP-01/35 RP-03/33

=== Crew seat assignments ===
==Mission background==
During the STS-121 mission to the International Space Station (ISS), the crew of continued to test new equipment and procedures for the inspection and repair of the thermal protection system that is designed to increase the safety of the Space Shuttles. It also delivered more supplies and cargo for future ISS expansion.

After the &quot;Columbia&quot; accident, NASA decided that two test flights would be required and that activities that were originally assigned to STS-114 would need to be divided into two missions because of the addition of post-&quot;Columbia&quot; safety tests. Before the accident, &quot;Columbia&quot; had been assigned to missions STS-118 and STS-121. The STS-118 mission, also an International Space Station flight, was at first reassigned to &quot;Discovery&quot;, but was later assigned to .

The STS-121 mission was originally to have sent &quot;Columbia&quot; to service the Hubble Space Telescope. However, that servicing mission was given another designation on the manifest before the disaster and the designation of STS-121 once again became available. Since STS-115 through STS-120 were already delegated to existing missions, NASA selected the lowest available mission designation for the second test flight. Hence, the mission following STS-114 is STS-121.

The STS-121 test flight mission was originally to be flown aboard &quot;Atlantis&quot; in September 2005, after &quot;Discovery&quot; flew STS-114, but a problem with the landing gear of &quot;Atlantis&quot; moved &quot;Discovery&quot; ahead to fly STS-121. After the return of &quot;Discovery&quot; to California following the completion of STS-114, scheduling again changed. &quot;Atlantis&quot; was moved up to fly the STS-115 mission (whose launch was planned for August 2006) and &quot;Discovery&quot; was to fly the STS-121 mission as originally planned. The launch of the STS-121 mission was delayed until July 2006 as well, due to an unresolved foam debris and the Engine Cut Off (ECO) sensor issue from STS-114.

On May 12, 2006, &quot;Discovery&quot; was moved from the Orbiter Processing Facility to the Vehicle Assembly Building, where it was mated to its External Tank and SRBs. Rollout to Pad 39B occurred on May 19, 2006, ahead of the planned launch, during the July 2006 launch window, which existed for about ten minutes each day between July 1 and 19.

==Equipment delivered to the ISS==

Key items delivered, as part of over 2 tons of cargo included:
Multi Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) Leonardo on its 4th flight, 7th MPLM overall, carrying:

*‚àí80¬†¬∞C Freezer
:This freezer is known as the Minus Eighty Degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI). The French-built unit comprises four independent drawers which can be set to operate at different temperatures. Initially, temperatures of will be used during on-orbit ISS operations. Both reagents and samples will be stored in the freezer. As well as storage, the freezer is designed to be used to transport samples to and from the ISS in a temperature controlled environment. The total capacity of the unit is .

*The European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) for biological experiments.
:This consists of a gas tight incubator in which there are two centrifuges, each able to carry four experimental cartridges. Two &quot;Ground controls&quot;‚Äîexact copies of the equipment and experiments‚Äîwill be run on the ground, one in Europe and one at NASA&#x27;s Ames Research Center.
*New oxygen generation system
:This device is considered a test for an equipment design with potential for use on proposed future long durations to the Moon and Mars. The system will initially run below its maximum capacity, though it is designed for enabling the ISS to support a crew of six in the future. It will supplement the Russian-built Elektron system operating in the &quot;Zvezda&quot; module.

*New cycling machine for the ISS crew
:A Danish built device, the Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation System (CEVIS)

*Replacement common cabin air assembly heat exchanger used to control the internal air temperature of the ISS.

All of the above equipment was installed in the &quot;Destiny&quot; Laboratory Module.

Also carried in the payload bay was an Integrated Cargo Carrier with the Trailing Umbilical System (TUS) for the Mobile Transporter 
(returning old one), an EATCS/Pump Module (PM), two Fixed Grapple Bars for PM and TUS relocation during EVA and an LMC carrying the DTO-848 TPS Repair Box.

==Mission timeline==



The shuttle was docked to the ISS for the majority of the flight. For much of the time the shuttle was at the ISS the Multi-Purpose Logistics Module &quot;Leonardo&quot; was mated and accessible to the crew for the transfer of equipment, supplies, returned experiments and trash.
Three spacewalks were carried out on the mission, the third was dependent on sufficient consumables being available and two alternate timelines were planned, with and without the final spacewalk. There were also additional &quot;Get Ahead&quot; tasks planned for the crew to do at the ISS if they found themselves with more time than planned, one such get ahead task was completed on EVA 2. The crew were able to take the majority of one day off, during which they explored the ISS, took photographs, and conducted press interviews.

Events throughout the day went according to plan, one exception being an abnormal temperature reading on thruster L5L (see Pre-launch concerns). The launch window was from 3:48:41 to 3:53:02¬†pm at 3:42, while in the T-9 built-in hold, mission control decided to postpone launch because anvil (thunderstorm) clouds and lightning were detected within of the launch area and path. Launch was rescheduled for July 2 at 15:26. STS-121 was the first launch during which NASA took special precautions to deter vultures, particularly the local turkey vulture, from flying over the area. Efforts included the swift removal of roadkill and other dead animals from areas around the launch site. This followed a near miss during STS-114.

Again, the countdown continued according to schedule with a launch time of 15:26. At 09:30 on July 2, 2006, the NASA launch blog reported that the &quot;shuttle weather officer forecasts a 70-percent chance of weather prohibiting a launch this afternoon due to thunderstorms and anvil clouds. There is a 60-percent chance of weather prohibiting launch should there be a 24-hour turnaround, and a 40-percent chance with a 48-hour delay. If we scrub today due to weather, mission managers will meet later to decide if they want to make a third consecutive launch attempt or stand down for one day and try again on Tuesday.&quot;

At 13:14, the launch director made a final decision to scrub again due to unfavorable weather conditions. The next launch attempt was scheduled for around 14:38¬†pm on July 4, 2006.

The shuttle&#x27;s fuel cells were replenished to improve the chances of having enough electrical power on orbit to enable the third planned space walk to take place.

Cracks and a region where a piece of foam had come off were discovered in the insulation on the upper part of the external fuel tanks. The foam came off a bracket which held an oxygen line in place. The fragment that fell off weighed and, according to NASA, would not be big enough to damage the shuttle if it were to come off during flight. The thermal stresses of repeated filling and emptying the fuel tank with the cryogenic fuel are known to cause a degree of damage to the insulation foam.
At 08:35 the backup circuit breaker controlling the primary heaters on the segment joints of both solid rocket boosters were noticed to have failed. Consideration was given to a repair on the pad. However, this was not done as the heaters are only used in colder weather, and the primary heater was functional.

For the third launch attempt, there was only a 20% chance of weather preventing launch according to NASA.

At 14:37:55 Eastern Daylight Time, Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; launched from the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Florida. This was the third attempt at launch. It was also the first US Space Shuttle to launch on the United States&#x27; Independence Day.

During and after launch much attention was paid to monitoring the external tank for the loss of insulation foam. The shuttle was equipped with a number of new cameras, and video was also taken from spotter planes. Each solid rocket booster contained three cameras ‚Äì one to monitor the separation, and two focused on the leading edge. The video from these was not to be broadcast, but recorded for later retrieval from the solid rocket boosters. A further camera was placed on the external tank, as during STS-114, to broadcast live images on NASA TV during launch. The first thing two of the crew from the mid-deck did when the main engines cut out was leave their seats to take photographs and video of the external tank. One of the factors that was potentially affecting the choice of day within the launch window was the lighting conditions for this imagery, as the sun&#x27;s slightly different angle on the different days affected the location of shadows on the external tank. However, the day to day difference in lighting was determined to be relatively unimportant, particularly as the lighting conditions depended to a great degree on a more unpredictable factor ‚Äì the degree to which the external tank tumbles on separation.

During the launch, NASA TV broadcast a view from the external tank camera mounted between the Shuttle and the external tank. Unlike the previous two missions, no foam breakage or foam pieces were easily seen falling off the tank. However, upon close inspection of the many cameras covering the launch NASA determined that several small pieces of debris were seen jetting away from the tank. Generally, though, these were seen after the time NASA was most concerned about.

Approximately 23 minutes into the flight, further debris was observed floating beside the orbiter as reported by Mission Specialist Michael Fossum. His transmission was broadcast live on NASA TV. Fossum initially described the debris as a piece with straps attached, a description which would fit a thermal protection system blanket. Such a blanket was noted to be flapping on the previous mission, STS-114, but was not of concern, as it protects a section of the vehicle which does not get particularly hot. Analysis of video images on the ground has indicated that the debris observed was strips of ice formed on the outside of an engine nozzle, which sublimated and disintegrated during observation. Very similar ice formations were seen on earlier missions.

Video analysis also revealed a tile shim which came out during main engine start.

The orbital maneuvering system thruster in which a heater failed prior to launch (see Pre-launch concerns) was warmed by pointing it at the sun, enabling it to be used during ISS rendezvous docking operations.

En route to the ISS, the -long Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) tipped with two types of lasers and a high-resolution television camera was used to inspect the underside of the shuttle for damage. Particular attention was paid to the leading edges of the shuttle&#x27;s wings.

The post mission management team briefing after flight day 2 revealed that the inspections had found that a gap filler was protruding on the port side lower wing, not a location of particular concern. The gap filler was not from an area which has been modified since STS-114; it had been with the vehicle since 1982.

An analysis of the inspections revealed the presence of bird droppings on the leading edge of the right wing. The launch director said he saw droppings in that location before launch. During the crew press conference on landing day, the crew joked about the bird droppings, indicating that they were still present on the orbiter though rather charred.

Following rendezvous with the ISS, the shuttle performed a rendezvous pitch maneuver prior to docking to allow the ISS crew to briefly inspect and photograph the Shuttle&#x27;s heat shield. An uneventful docking with the space station was performed. Thomas Reiter officially became a member of the International Space Station Expedition 13 crew shortly after docking; the transfer of his personalised Soyuz spacecraft seat liner, which cushions the landing, indicated the official transfer point.

The Multi-Purpose Logistics Module &quot;Leonardo&quot; was mated to the space station&#x27;s Unity module. There were concerns that some straps were in the way of the docking equipment, but following video inspections of the straps they were determined not to be a problem and docking continued as planned.

A number of focused inspections of the Shuttle&#x27;s heat shield were conducted while it was docked to the ISS.

The results of analysis of data collected by the wing leading edge sensors were discussed in the post mission management meeting briefing at the conclusion of flight day 4. The sensors were revealed to have picked up six impacts. The maximum g observed was 1.6 g, compared to ground testing where impacts producing on the order of 10 g were required to cause damage.

Michael Fossum and Piers Sellers performed a -hour space walk. They evaluated the use of the Orbital Boom Sensor System extension to Shuttle&#x27;s Canadarm as a work platform in case repairs are needed to the shuttle. The first step was to attach the foot restraints to the arm. First Piers Sellers worked alone; then Mike Fossum joined him ‚Äì when both are on the arm they attempted increasingly vigorous operations that simulate various potential repair scenarios.

Initial reports from Michael Fossum and Piers Sellers suggested that the boom was damping out motion rapidly, making it a good work platform. Piers Sellers said at one point: &quot;I felt almost no motions at all, just a few inches each way, very few motions&quot;. When standing on the boom while it was moving they described it as very smooth.

Fossum had a problem with his long safety tether, which was damaged after he made a mistake; not realising he had left the tether in a locked position, he expected it to be automatically drawn tight. Upon realising the mistake Fossum said: &quot;Oh no! ... That&#x27;s embarrassing&quot;. The damaged tether had to be switched for a spare.

The other major task was to make safe a cable cutter on the ISS&#x27;s mobile transporter.

The morning&#x27;s flight plan revision emailed up to the crew contained the following request:

One of the day&#x27;s highlights was a press conference from orbit, with questions from JSC, KSC, and the ESA.

Robotics operations continued, with the Canadarm2 releasing the mobile transporter from one end, while remaining attached with the other end to the Destiny module in preparation for the following day&#x27;s work on the mobile transporter system. Other preparations for the second space walk continued, including the setting up of equipment, and cameras.

Additionally a new spacesuit being delivered to the ISS was transferred and underwent &quot;checkout&quot; procedures.

Sellers and Fossum performed a 6-hour, 47-minute space walk. They deployed a spare pump module and replaced a reel of umbilical cable carrying power, data and video for operating the station&#x27;s Mobile Transporter rail car.

The astronauts also continued cargo transfers between the shuttle, the International Space Station and the &quot;Leonardo&quot; multi-purpose logistics module. &quot;Leonardo&quot; arrived with more than 7,400 pounds of equipment and supplies for the station. &quot;Leonardo&quot; will be returned Friday to the payload bay packed with more than 4,300 pounds of science experiment results, unneeded items and trash.

At 10:35 EDT, President George W. Bush had a private telephone conversation with the crew, during which he told the astronauts that they represent the best of service and exploration, and thanked them for the job they are doing.

Pilot Mark Kelly suggested during an on-orbit press conference that the wake-up songs should be made known to the crew before they are woken up by them when he said:
A third and final spacewalk to demonstrate shuttle repair techniques was carried out by Sellers and Fossum. Repairs were done on pre-damaged samples of heat shield materials brought into space on a special pallet in the payload bay of the shuttle. The repairs were expected to work best when the material has been warm and is cooling, so the actions were carefully coordinated by mission control with regard to exposure of the samples to sunlight. While the procedures, and NOAX (Non-Oxide Adhesive Experimental) material had been tested in a vacuum on Earth, the zero-G tests were required because of offgassing from the material and the potential for bubbles to form that could weaken the structure of the repair.

Following a problem on the previous EVA where latches on a SAFER became detached, Kapton tape was used to ensure the latches remained closed on this EVA.

Sellers lost one of the spatulas he was using to put the NOAX onto the samples of heat shield material. He tried to locate it himself with the assistance of Fossum, who said &quot;Don&#x27;t worry it happens.&quot; Mission controllers saw the spatula float away over the port side of the shuttle payload bay. The loose tool was determined not to pose a hazard to the mission.

The Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; (STS-121) crew enjoyed a day off after having completed three successful space walks and transferring thousands of pounds of supplies and equipment earlier in the flight.

Mission Specialist Mike Fossum received a call from Texas Governor Rick Perry, who, like Fossum, is a graduate of the Texas A&amp;M University. He mentioned to Fossum how proud he was to have the first Aggie in space. &quot;&quot;Aggies are all up in great arms to have the first Aggie in space,&quot; said Perry. &quot;You are making some history, Michael.&quot;&quot;

Later in the afternoon, Fossum and Nowak participated in live interviews with MSNBC and Fox News Live.

Expedition 13 crewmember Jeffrey Williams confirmed steps and final procedures for closeout of the MPLM which will be relocated from the International Space Station to &quot;Discovery&quot;‚Ä≥s payload bay.
Transfer of &quot;Leonardo&quot; to the shuttle payload bay was completed in preparation for &quot;Discovery&quot;&#x27;s departure from the International Space Station. Wilson and Nowak used the Canadarm2 to complete the transfer of the module packed with over 4000 pounds of material to return to Earth.

Wilson and Nowak also used the shuttle&#x27;s arm and extension boom to inspect the shuttle&#x27;s port wing for any signs of micro-meteoroid damage while on-orbit. The other wing and the nose cap were inspected on flight day 12 following undocking.

Major discussion on the ground occurred concerning a small leak, an &quot;APU [auxiliary power unit] 1 fuel tank pressure decay&quot;, in either a nitrogen or hydrazine tank, in one of the three redundant auxiliary power units which generate hydraulic power for use controlling the flight control surfaces during landing. Ultimately, tests performed after ISS undocking increased confidence in the integrity of the APU to the point where mission controllers decided to use the unit as normal for the re-entry.

Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;‚Ä≥s STS 121 crew undocked from International Space Station after a 9-day stay. Undocking occurred over the Pacific Ocean just north of New Zealand.

Mark Kelly flew &quot;Discovery&quot; to a point above the station before performing the final separation burn.

Crew members also used the Canadarm and the orbital boom sensor system to perform final inspections of the starboard wing and shuttle nosecap for any damage that may have been caused by orbital debris while docked with the International Space Station.

Troubleshooting of one of the Flash Evaporator Subsystem (FES) (FES PRI B) was carried out. FES A was to be used during reentry but it was desirable to have both functional. This was in addition to the usual extensive checkout of all systems required for reentry ensuring they were functional.

Other activities included a long series of live press conferences from orbit, and preparations for landing, which included stowing items on the middeck, fitting the seats in place, and the CDR and Pilot practicing a simulated landing.

&quot;Discovery&quot; received a clean bill of health on the recent heat shield inspections and was given a Go for landing. There were only two very minor deviations from a nominal landing procedure planned: APU 1 was started early, and, due to the problems with the heater thermostat on APU 3, the heater was turned off manually by one of the crew.

The deorbit burn phase began successfully at 7:07¬†am CDT, committing &quot;Discovery&quot; to land on the 17th. At 8:08¬†am CDT, &quot;Discovery&quot; was safely out of reentry and headed toward a landing at KSC runway 15. The original landing target (Runway 33) was ruled out at the last minute due to showers south of KSC where the orbiter would have circled before landing. Shortly before landing the right air data probe initially failed to deploy. It began functioning of its own accord a few minutes later.

&quot;Discovery&quot; landed successfully on schedule at 09:14:43 EDT with three good APUs throughout the landing procedure. During the post landing inspection tour, Lindsey remarked that this was one of the cleanest inspections he&#x27;d ever done.

During post landing press briefings it was stated that:
*&quot;Discovery&quot;‚Ä≥s windows would be replaced before the next mission, STS-116, so that the old ones can be studied by engineers at Corning to find out the cause of small imperfections which appeared during the mission.
*The mission&#x27;s demonstration that the shuttle&#x27;s arm can be used as a work platform was a good sign for a potential future Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission.
*The Space Shuttle Program is &quot;back in business&quot;.

== Additional personnel ==
As well as the shuttle crew, the ISS crew was key to this mission. The ISS crew included:
Commander Pavel Vinogradov and Flight Engineer Jeffrey Williams.

CAPCOM ‚Äì those responsible for speaking on the radio to the Shuttle from mission control were:

Steve Frick / Rick Sturckow During Ascent/Descent;
Rick Mastracchio / Lee Archambault while in Orbit; Julie Payette for ISS Operations

The launch director was Michael D. Leinbach; the flight director&#x27;s position in mission control was held by Steve Stich during launch and re-entry and by Tony Ceccacci / Norm Knight during orbital operations.

==Wake-up calls==
A tradition for NASA spaceflights since the days of Gemini, mission crews are played a special musical track at the start of each day in space. Each track is specially chosen, often by their family, and usually has special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

==Contingency planning==
There are various contingency plans for failures occurring during and immediately after launch, known as abort modes. If the comprehensive inspections of the shuttle&#x27;s heat shield which was conducted once the vehicle was in orbit had suggested that it would not be able to survive a re-entry, or another problem occurred, then &quot;Atlantis&quot;, commanded by Brent Jett, would have been used to mount the STS-301 rescue mission which involves the shuttle crew transferring to the ISS then awaiting rescue. STS-121 was the first shuttle mission to carry an 8.5-meter cable designed to connect the flight deck manual controls used during landing to an avionics bay in the middeck allowing mission controllers to land the shuttle uncrewed if required. However the Rescue Flight Resource Book released following STS-121 states that a controlled break-up rather than a landing was planned for a disabled shuttle.

One of the contingency plans most likely to be put into action was a landing at alternate site (primarily Dryden Flight Research Center and Edwards Air Force Base) in the event of bad weather at KSC. In addition to the specific plans, NASA had a generic &quot;mishap response plan&quot;, and the shuttle software was pre-loaded with information on a large number of airfields that were potential landing sites. In many cases, the airfields were unaware of their presence in the shuttle software.

===STS-300===
STS-300 was the designation given to the Contingency Shuttle Crew Support mission which would have launched in the event Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; became disabled during STS-114 or STS-121. The rescue mission for STS-114 was a modified version of the STS-121 mission, which would have involved the launch date being brought forward. If needed, it would have launched no earlier than August 11, 2005. The crew for this mission was a 4-person subset of the full STS-121 crew:
*Steven Lindsey, Commander and backup Remote Manipulator System (RMS) operator
*Mark Kelly, Pilot and prime RMS operator
*Michael E. Fossum, Mission Specialist 1 and Extravehicular 2
*Piers Sellers, Mission Specialist 2 and Extravehicular 1

==Pre-launch concerns==
Following the flight readiness review meeting which concluded on June 17, 2006, NASA&#x27;s Chief Engineer Christopher Scolese and Chief Safety and Mission Assurance Officer Bryan O&#x27;Connor, who served as pilot on STS-61-B and commanded STS-40, decided that from their point of view they were going to recommend that the shuttle not be flown. O&#x27;Connor later expanded this to explain that this is due to the potential for the loss of the vehicle; he supported the collective decision to fly, however, especially given the option for the crew to stay on the ISS and await rescue if the shuttle is unable to return to earth. Both Scolese and O&#x27;Connor included notes explaining their position in their entries in the official plans.

Statement by Scolese and O&#x27;Connor as released by NASA:

NASA&#x27;s public affairs office had said following the flight readiness review that O&#x27;Connor and Scolese would not talk to the media about their objections. On June 20 it was reported that O&#x27;Connor was readily agreeing to interviews and also said the statement was actually written by the public affairs office and agreed by the two officials.

On the morning of the first launch attempt, on July 1, concerns included weather, external fuel tank foam, and a thruster failure. The thruster failure was detected via abnormally low thermostat readings in one of the left Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) pods. The thruster in question ‚Äì L5L, one of 38 ‚Äì was considered inoperable. The plan was not to fix the problem, but to ensure that any reduction in maneuverability resulting from the failure is within the limits that the crew can cope with on orbit. Thruster L5L became operational again after mission managers decided to use sunlight to warm up the thruster to normal operational levels and it was able to be used during the docking procedures with the ISS.

==Mission coverage==
NASA&#x27;s simulation website was regularly updated as the launch approached. Shortly after launch NASA TV online and via cable was seriously disrupted by a thunderstorm over Goddard Space Flight Center from where NASA TV is uplinked to satellites for distribution.

The entire mission was covered on NASA TV and was available online worldwide, on cable, and on satellite in the USA. In the United States, CNN, C-SPAN, FOX News, HDNet, and MSNBC had live coverage of the launch and landing.

<doc id="833597" wikidata="Q11790865" url="?curid=833597" title="New Lodge, South Yorkshire">
<text>New Lodge is a housing estate in Barnsley in South Yorkshire, England.

The &#x27;New Lodge&#x27; estate is located to the north of Barnsley on the A61 near Athersley.

The earliest reference to New Lodge dates from 1377, when the area was referred to as &#x27;Newe Laythes&#x27;, becoming New Laithes in 1541. Maps from 1850 show 8 or 9 farm outbuildings at New Lodge, together with the large stone built manor house with its long carriageway and the &#x27;Roundhouse&#x27; lodge on the Wakefield Turnpike (now the A61). The manor house was built in the late 18th century by the York architect John Carr for his nephew John Clarke. The land for the house was purchased in 1769. The &#x27;Roundhouse&#x27;, an unusual eight-sided building, was demolished in the mid-20th century, and its site is now occupied by the Roundhouse Medical Centre. The manor house remained in private hands until the 1940s; it subsequently became a private club until it was purchased by Barnsley Borough Council in 1947 and converted into a home for elderly ladies in 1950. The home was closed down in 1990 and the historic building was badly vandalised, but restored and extended as a private residential home in 1992.
Today New Lodge is a predominantly council housing estate. Prior to the Second World War, the area was mostly farmland, but was purchased by Barnsley Council in 1946 for the express purpose of creating a new housing estate. A document of conveyance dated 16 November 1946, recording the purchase of the land from the Barn-Murdoch family by Barnsley Council for a sum of ¬£7,750, can be found in the Athersley Archives. Factory built houses, or prefabs, comprise most of the estate. These are of the concrete section Tarran type, and the BISF houses, known as the &#x27;tin houses&#x27;. By the late 1940s there was a thriving community of predominantly mining families and the estate was completed in the early 1950s with conventional brick houses.

Regent Crescent and Park Avenue were called New Lodge before the council estate was built. The estate is currently undergoing a renovation, with the replacement of some of the Tarran houses and major upgrades to the remaining stock.

<text>The Forty Group was a Kenyan society or organization of the mid-twentieth century constituted primarily of members of the Kenya African Union who joined with the aim of using violence to make their voice heard. The name is a translation of the Gƒ©k≈©y≈© phrase Anake a 40, which means The Young Men of 40. The organization was also called Kiama kia 40 translating to The (political) party of 40. The number 40 is a reference to the year 1940, in which most of the group&#x27;s core members were drafted into the British Armed Forces.

The organization consisted mainly of men fresh from service in World War II.

It was founded by Mwangi Macharia and gradually evolved into part of the Mau Mau rebellion of the 1950s.

Stanley Mathenge was one of the leaders of the Forty Group.

<text>Pavlovsky Posad () is a town and the administrative center of Pavlovo-Posadsky District in Moscow Oblast, Russia, located from Moscow, at the confluence of the Klyazma and Vokhna Rivers. Population: 

==History==

The town of Pavlovsky Posad was founded in 1844 by merging several villages (Pavlovo, Dubrovo, Zakharovo, and Melenki). From its very foundation, the land on which the town stands belonged to the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius monastery of the Russian Orthodox Church. Later, from the mid-17th century, the land came into state ownership. Due to these peculiarities, Pavlovsky Posad never knew serfdom.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Pavlovsky Posad serves as the administrative center of Pavlovo-Posadsky District. As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Pavlovo-Posadsky District as the Town of Pavlovsky Posad. As a municipal division, the Town of Pavlovsky Posad is incorporated within Pavlovo-Posadsky Municipal District as Pavlovsky Posad Urban Settlement.

==Economy==
From the very beginning Pavlovsky Posad has had the textile industry as its main business. This industry is still the most prominent in modern town. During the 1990s, most textile factories were transformed into public corporations and went through bankruptcy. The public float index for these factories is currently extremely low: about 90-95% of each factory&#x27;s shares are owned by one person.

The town has also always been famous for its Pavlovo Posad shawl factories. One of these factories, &quot;Pavlovo-Posadkaya Manufaktura&quot;, is still producing traditional shawls and kerchiefs in the Russian style. Some other factories survived by concentrating on fire-equipment (such as fire hoses); whereas others yet are producing vestments for Orthodox priests.

===Transportation===
The Moscow‚ÄìVladimir railway goes through the town.

==Religion==
Pokrovsko-Vasilyevsky Monastery was established near the cemetery in the beginning of the 20th century. In the monastery there&#x27;s a cathedral that actually incorporates two independent churches: the upper church of Pokrov and the lower of St.¬†Basil the Confessor, who was Vasily Gryaznov&#x27;s saint patron. For his missionary work among the old believers, Vasily Gryaznov was granted sainthood in 1999. A cathedral also has a belltower. Both the cathedral and the belltower are built in the so-called pseudo-Russian style. There&#x27;s also a little church of St.¬†Andrei Rublev at the monastery gates.
There are also three more Orthodox churches and one Old Believers&#x27; Orthodox church.

==Attractions==
Local attractions include several 19th-century factory buildings, a local museum, a museum of Russian shawls and kerchiefs, and an exhibition center. Some old tombstones could be found on local Old Believer&#x27;s cemeteries. There are also many old buildings in the streets of the town center.

*Natalya Petrusyova, speed skater
*Vyacheslav Tikhonov, actor

<doc id="833606" wikidata="Q1356198" url="?curid=833606" title="Kanheri Caves">
<text>The Kanheri Caves (&quot;KƒÅnherƒ´-guhƒÅ&quot; ) are a group of caves and rock-cut monuments cut into a massive basalt outcrop in the forests of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, on the island of Salsette in the western outskirts of Mumbai, India. They contain Buddhist sculptures and relief carvings, paintings and inscriptions, dating from the 1st century CE to the 10th century CE. &quot;Kanheri&quot; comes from the Sanskrit &quot;Krishnagiri&quot;, which means &quot;black mountain&quot;.

The site is on a hillside, and is accessible via rock-cut steps. The cave complex comprises one hundred and nine caves. The oldest are relatively plain and unadorned, in contrast to later caves on the site, and the highly embellished Elephanta Caves of Mumbai. Each cave has a stone plinth that functioned as a bed. A congregation hall with huge stone pillars contains a stupa (a Buddhist Pagoda). Rock-cut channels above the caves fed rainwater into cisterns, which provided the complex with water. Once the caves were converted to permanent monasteries, their walls were carved with intricate reliefs of Buddha and the Bodhisattvas. Kanheri caves were built in the 1st century and had become an important Buddhist settlement on the Konkan coast by the 3rd century CE.

Most of the caves were Buddhist viharas, meant for living, studying, and meditating. The larger caves, which functioned as chaityas, or halls for congregational worship, are lined with intricately carved Buddhist sculptures, reliefs, pillars and rock-cut stupas. Avalokiteshwara is the most distinctive figure. The large number of viharas demonstrates there was a well organized establishment of Buddhist monks. This establishment was also connected with many trade centers, such as the ports of Sopara, Kalyan, Nasik, Paithan and Ujjain. Kanheri was a University center by the time the area was under the rule of the Maurayan and Kushan empires. In the late 10th century, the Buddhist teacher Atisha (980‚Äì1054) came to the &quot;Krishnagiri Vihara&quot; to study Buddhist meditation under Rahulagupta.

==Inscriptions at Kanheri==

Nearly 51 legible inscriptions and 26 epigraphs are found at Kanheri, which include inscriptions in Brahmi, Devanagari and 3 Pahlavi epigraphs found in Cave 90. One of the significant inscriptions mentions the marriage of Satavahana ruler Vashishtiputra Satakarni with the daughter of Rudradaman I:

There are also two inscriptions of Yajna Sri Satakarni (170-199 CE), in cave No. 81, and in the Chaitya cave No. 3.

A 494-495 CE inscription found at Kanheri mentions the Traikutaka dynasty.

==Description of the caves==
The Island of Salsette, or Shatshashthi, at the head of Bombay harbour, is peculiarly rich in rock-Temples, there being works of this kind at Kanheri, Marol, Mahakali Caves, Magathane, Mandapeshwar Caves, and Jogeshwari Caves. The most extensive series is the group of Buddhist caves at Kanheri, a few miles from Thane, in which are about 109 separate caves, mostly small, however, and architecturally unimportant.

From their position, within easy access from Bombay and Bassein, they early attracted attention, and were described by Portuguese visitors in the 16th century, and by European voyagers and travellers like Linschoten, Fryer, Gemelli Careri, Anquetil Du Perron, Salt and others.

They are about six miles from Thana, and two miles north of the Tulsi lake, recently formed to increase the water supply of Bombay, and are excavated in one large bubble of a hill, situated in the midst of an immense tract of forest country. Most of the hills in the neighbourhood are covered with the jungle, but this one is nearly bare, its summit being formed by 
one large rounded mass of compact rock, under which a softer stratum has in many places been washed out by the rains, forming natural caves; it is in the stratum again below this that most of the excavations are situated. The rock in which the caves are is a volcanic breccia, which forms the whole of the hilly district of the island, culminating to the north of the caves in a point about 1,550 feet above the sea level. 

In so large a group there must be considerable differences in the ages of some of the excavations. These, however, may generally be at least approximatively ascertained from the characters of the numerous inscriptions that exist upon them. Architectural features are necessarily indefinite where the great majority of the excavations consist of a single small room, usually with a little veranda in front, supported by two plain square or octagonal shafts, and stone-beds in the cells. In the larger and more ornate caves they 
are, of course, as important here as elsewhere. Their style is certainly primitive, and some of these monks&#x27; abodes may date from before the Christian era. 

One small cave of this type (No. 81) in the ravine, consisting of a very narrow porch, without pillars, a room with a stone bench along the walls, and a cell to the left, has an inscription of Yajna Sri Satakarni of the Satavahanas of the 2nd century CE, and it is probable that numbers of others in the same plain style may range from the second to the fourth century. Others, however, are covered inside with sculpture of a late Mahayana type, and some have inscriptions which must date as late as the middle of the ninth century. 

The existence of so many monastic dwellings in this locality is partly accounted for by the neighbourhood of so many thriving towns. Among the places mentioned as the residences of donors to them, occur the names of Surparaka, the Supara of Greek and the Subara of Arab writers, the ancient capital of the northern Konkan; Kalyan, long a thriving port; Chemula, the Samylla of Greek geographers, on the island of Trombay; and Vasya perhaps Vasai or Bassein. Sri Staanaka or Thana itself, and Ghodabandar were 
also doubtless thriving towns. 

===Cave No.1===
Cave No.1 is a vihara, a Buddhist monastery. The entrance is framed by two large pillars. The cave has two levels, but its construction has never been completed.

===Cave No.2===
On the right of the court of the Great Chaitya is Cave No.2, pressing very closely upon it. It is a long cave, now open in front, and which contained three dagobas, one of them now broken off near the base. This cave are cave No.4 on both sides of the Great Chaitya are probably older than the Chaitya cave, which seems to have been thrust in between these two caves at a later date; but this long room has been so much altered at different times that it is not easy to make out its original arrangements. On the rock surrounding the dagoba are sculptures of Buddha, a litany, etc..., but all these are probably of later date.

===Great Chaitya (Cave No.3)===
The cave first met on the way up the hill, and the most important one in the whole series, is the great Chaitya cave. On the jamb of the entrance to the veranda is an inscription of Yajna Sri Satakarni (circa 170 CE), the same whose name appears in cave No. 81; the inscription here being much mutilated, it is only by help of the other that it can be deciphered. It seems, however, to be integral, and it is consequently not improbable that the cave was excavated during his reign.

From the style of the architecture it can be stated with certainty that the Cave 17 at Nasik Caves is contemporary, or nearly so, with the Great Chaitya at Karla, and that the Nahapana Cave there (No.10) is a bit earlier than No.17, but at no great interval of time. The Gautamiputra Cave No.3 succeeded to these after a considerable lapse of time, while anything that Yajna Sri Satakarni may have done there must, of course, have been executed within a short interval of time after that. On the other hand, whatever its date may be, it is certain that the plan of this Chaitya Cave is a literal copy of that at Karle, but the architectural details show exactly the same difference in style as is found between Cave 17 and Cave 3 at Nasik. 

If, for instance, we compare the capitals in this cave, with those of Karle, we find the same degradation of style as is seen between Nasik cave No.10 and the later Nasik cave No.3. The screen too, in front of this cave, though very much weatherworn and consequently difficult to draw, is of very nearly the same design that is in the Gautamiputra Cave at Nasik, and in its complication of discs and animal forms seems almost as modern as what can be found at Amravati.

This temple is 86.5 feet long by 39 feet 10 inches wide from wall to wall, and has thirty-four pillars round the nave and the dagoba, only 6 on one side and eleven on the other having bases and capitals of the Karle Chaitya-cave patterns, but not so well proportioned nor so spiritedly cut, while fifteen pillars round the apse are plain octagonal shafts. The dagoba is a very plain one, nearly 16 feet in diameter, but its capital is destroyed; so also is all the woodwork of the arched roof. The aisle across the front is covered by a gallery under the great arched window, and probably the central portion of the veranda in front was also covered, but in wood. At the ends of this veranda are two colossal figures of Buddha, about 
23 feet high, but these appear to be considerably later than the cave itself. 

The sculpture on the front screen wall is apparently a copy of that in the same position at Karle, but rather better executed, indeed, they are the best carved figures in these caves; the rock in this place happens to be peculiarly close grained, and the style of dress of the figures is that of the age of the great Satakarnis. The earrings are heavy and some of them oblong, while the anklets of the women are very heavy, and the turbans wrought with great care. This style of dress never occurs in any of the later caves or frescoes. They may with confidence be regarded as of the age of the cave. Not so with the images above them, among which are several of Buddha and two standing figures of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteswara, which all may belong to a later period. So also does the figure of Buddha in the front wall at the left end of the veranda, under which is an inscription containing the name of Buddhaghosha, in letters of about the sixth century. 

The verandah has two pillars in front, and the screen above them is carried up with five openings above. In the left side of the court are two rooms, one entered through the other, but evidently of later date than the cave. The outer one has a good deal of sculpture in it. On each side of the court is an attached pillar; on the top of that on the west side are four lions, as at Karle; on the other are three fat squat figures similar to those on the pillar in the court of the Jaina Cave, known as Indra Sabha, at Ellora; these probably supported a wheel. In front of the verandah there has been a wooden porch. 

====Cave No.4====
On the left of the court of the Great Chaitya is a small circular cell containing a solid Dagoba, from its position almost certainly of more ancient date than this cave. On the right of the court of the Great Chaitya is Cave No.2. Both these caves are probably older than the Chaitya cave, which seems to have been thrust in between these two caves at a later date. On the rock surrounding the dagoba are sculptures of Buddha, a litany, etc..., but all these are probably of later date.

South of the last is another Chaitya cave, but quite unfinished and of a much later style of architecture, the columns of the veranda having square bases and compressed cushion-shaped capitals of the type found in the Elephanta Caves. The interior can scarcely be said to be begun. It is probably the latest excavation of any importance attempted in the hill, and may date about the ninth or tenth century after Christ.

===Cave No.5 and cave No.6===
These are not really caves but actually water cisterns. There is an important inscription over these (No 16 of Gokhale) mentioning that these were donated by a minister named Sateraka. The inscription also mentions the queen of Vashishtiputra Satakarni (130-160 CE), as descending from the race of the Karddamaka dynasty of the Western Satraps, and being the daughter to the Western Satrap ruler Rudradaman.

===Darbar Cave (Cave No.11)===

To the north-east of the great Chaitya cave, in a glen or gully formed by a torrent, is a cave bearing the name of the Maharaja or Darbar Cave, which is the largest of the class in the group, and, after the Chaitya Caves, certainly the most interesting. It is not a Vihara in the ordinary sense of the term, though it has some cells, but a Dharmasala or place of assembly, and is the only cave now known to exist that enables us to realise the arrangements of the great hall erected by Ajatashatru in front of the Sattapanni Cave at Rajagriha, to accommodate the first convocation held immediately after the death of Buddha. According to the Mahawanso &quot; Having in all respects perfected this hall, he had invaluable carpets spread there, corresponding to the number of priests (500), in order that being seated on the north side the south might be faced; the inestimable pre-eminent throne of the high priest was placed there. In the centre of the hall, facing the east, the exalted preaching pulpit, fit for the deity himself, was erected.&quot;
The plan of the cave shows that the projecting shrine occupies precisely the position of the throne of the President in the above description. In the cave it is occupied by a figure of Buddha on a simhasana, with Padmapani and another attendant or chauri-bearers. This, however, is exactly what might be expected more than 1,000 years after the first convocation was held, and when the worship of images of Buddha had taken the place of the purer forms that originally prevailed. It is easy to understand that in the sixth century, when this cave probably was excavated, the &quot;present deity&quot; would be considered the sanctifying President of any assembly, and his human representative would take his seat in front of the image. 

In the lower part of the hall, where there are no cells, is a plain space, admirably suited for the pulpit of the priest who read Bana to the assembly. The centre of the hall, 73 feet by 32, would, according to modern calculation accommodate from 450 to 500 persons, but evidently was intended for a much smaller congregation. Only two stone benches are provided, and they would hardly hold 100, but be this as it may, it seems quite evident that this cave is not a Vihara in the ordinary sense of the term, but a Dharmasala or place of assembly like the Nagarjuni Cave.

There is some confusion here between the north and south sides of the hall, but not in the least affecting the position of the President relatively to the preacher. From what we know, it seems, as might be expected, the Mahawanso is correct. The entrance to the hall would be from the north, and the President&#x27;s throne would naturally face it. 

There are two inscriptions in this cave, but neither seems to be integral, if any reliance can be placed on the architectural features, though the whole cave is so plain and unornamented that this testimony is not very distinct. The pillars of the veranda are plain octagons without base or capital, and may be of any age. Internally the pillars are square above and below, with incised circular mouldings, changing in the centre into a belt with 16 sides or flutes, and with plain bracket capitals. Their style is that of the Viswakarma temple at Ellora, and even more distinctly that of the Chaori in the Mokundra pass. A Gupta Empire inscription has lately been found in this last, limiting its date to the fifth century, which is probably that of the Yiswakarma Cave, so that this cave can hardly be much more modern. The age, however, of this cave is not so important as its use. It seems to throw a new light on the arrangements in many Buddhist Caves, whose appropriation has hitherto been difficult to understand.

===Other caves===
Directly opposite to it is a small cave with two pillars and two half ones in the veranda, having an inscription of about the 9th or 10th century on the frieze. Inside is a small hall with a rough cell at the back, containing only an image of Buddha on the back wall. 

The next, on the south side of the ravine, is also probably a comparatively late cave. It has two massive square pillars in the verandah, with necks cut into sixteen flutes as in the Darbar cave and some of the Elura Buddhist caves, it consequently is probably of the same age. The hall is small and has a room to the right of it, and in the large shrine at the back is a well cut dagoba. 

The next consists of a small hall, lighted by the door and a small latticed window, with a bench running along the left side and back and a cell on the right with a stone bed in it. The veranda has had a low screen wall connecting its two octagon pillars with the ends. Outside, on the left, is a large recess and over it two long inscriptions. Close to this is another cave with four benched chambers; possibly it originally consisted of three small caves, of which the dividing partitions have been destroyed; but till 1853 the middle one contained the ruins of four small dagobas, built of unbumt bricks. These were excavated by Mr. E. W. West, and led to the discovery of a very large number of seal impressions in dried clay, many of them enclosed in clay receptacles, the upper halves of which were neatly moulded somewhat in the form of dagobas, and with them were found other pieces of moulded clay which probably formed chhatris for the tops of them, making the resemblance complete.

Close to the dagobas two small stone pots were also found containing ashes and five copper coins apparently of the Bahmani dynasty, and if so, of the 14th or 15th century. The characters on the seal impressions are of a much earlier age, but probably not before the 10th century, and most of them contain merely the Buddha creed.

The next cave on the same side has a pretty large hall with a bench at each side, two slender square columns and pilasters in front of the antechamber, the inner walls of which are sculptured with four tall standing images of Buddha. The shrine is now empty, and whether it contained a structural simhasana or a dagoba is difficult to say. 

Upon the opposite side of the gulley is an immense excavation so ruined by the decay of the rock as to look much like a natural cavern; it has had a very long hall, of which the entire front is gone, a square antechamber with two cells to the left and three to the right of it. The inner shrine is empty. In front has been a brick dagoba rifled long ago, and at the west end are several fragments of caves; the fronts and dividing walls of all are gone.

====Cave 41====

Some way farther up is a vihara with a large advanced porch supported by pillars of the Elephanta type in front and by square ones behind of the pattern occurring in Cave 15 at Ajanta. The hall door is surrounded by mouldings, and on the back wall are the remains of painting, consisting of Buddhas. In the shrine is an image, and small ones are cut in the side walls, in which are also two cells. In a large recess to the right of the porch is a seated figure of Buddha, and on his left is Padmapani or Sahasrabahu-lokeswara, with ten additional heads piled up over his own; and on the other side of the chamber is the litany with four compartments on each side. This is evidently a late cave.

====More caves====
Altogether there are upwards of 30 excavations on both sides of this ravine, and nearly opposite the last-mentioned is a broken dam, which has confined the water above, forming a lake. On the hill to the north, just above this, is a ruined temple, and near it the remains of several stupas and dagobas. Just above the ravine, on the south side, is a range of about nineteen caves, the largest of which is a fine vihara cave, with cells in the side walls. It has four octagonal pillars in the veranda connected by a low screen wall and seat, and the walls of the veranda, and sides and back of the hall, are covered with sculptured figures of Buddha in different attitudes and variously accompanied, but with so many female 
figures introduced as to show that it was the work of the Mahayana school. There is reason, however, to suppose that the sculpture is later than the excavation of the cave. 
Behind and above these is another range, in some parts double, three near the east end being remarkable for the profusion of their sculptures, consisting chiefly of Buddhas with attendants, dagobas, etc... But in one is a fine sculptured litany, in which the central figure of Avalokiteswara has a tall female on each side, and beyond each are five compartments, those on the right representing danger from the elephant, lion, snake, fire, and shipwreck; those on the left from imprisonment (?) Garuda, Shitala or disease, sword, and some enemy not now recognizable from the abrasion of the stone.

====Cave No.90====
In Cave No.90 is a similar group representing Buddha seated on the Padmasana, on a lotus throne, supported by two figures with snake hoods, and surrounded by attendants in the manner so usual in the Mahayana sculptures of a later age in these caves. There are more figures in this one than are generally found on these compositions, but they are all very like one another in their general characteristics. 

Over the cistern and on the pilasters of the veranda are inscriptions which at first sight appear to be in a tabular form and in characters met with nowhere else; they are in Pahlavi. 

Lastly, from a point near the west end of this last range, a series of nine excavations trend to the south, but are no way remarkable. 

What strikes every visitor to these Kanheri caves is the number of water cisterns, most of the caves being furnished with its own cistern at the side of the front court, and these being filled all the year round with pure water. In front of many of the caves too there are holes in the floor of the court, and over their facades are mortices cut in the rock as footings for posts, and holdings for wooden rafters to support a covering to shelter the front of the caves during the monsoon. 

All over the hill from one set of caves to another steps are cut on the surface of the rock, and these stairs in many cases have had handrails along the sides of them. 

Passing the last-mentioned group and advancing southwards by an ancient path cut with steps wherever there is a descent, we reach the edge of the cliff and descend it by a ruined stair about 330 yards south of the great Chaitya cave. This lands in a long gallery extending over 200 yards south-south-east, and sheltered by the overhanging rock above. The floor of this gallery is found to consist of the foundations of small brick dagobas buried in dust and debris, and probably sixteen to twenty in number, seven of which were opened 
out by Mr. Ed. W. West in 1853.&#x27; Beyond these is the ruin of a large stone stupa, on which has been a good deal of sculpture, and which was explored and examined by Mr. West. In the rock behind it are three small cells also containing decayed sculptures, with traces of plaster covered with painting. Beyond this the floor suddenly rises about 14 feet, where are the remains of eleven small brick stupas; then another slight ascent lands on a level, on which are thirty-three similar ruined stupas buried in debris. Overhead the rock has been cut out in some places to make room for them. On the back wall are some dagobas in relief and three benched recesses. The brick stupas vary from 4 to 6 feet in diameter at the base, but all are destroyed down to near that level, and seem to have been all rifled, for in none of those examined have any relics been found. 

There were other large stupas in front of the great Chaitya cave, but these were opened in 1839 by Dr. James Bird, who thus described his operations &quot;The largest of the topes selected for examination appeared to have been one time between 12 or 16 feet in height. It was much dilapidated, and was penetrated from above to the base, which was built of cut stone. After digging to the level of the ground and clearing away the materials, the workmen came to a circular stone, hollow in the centre, and covered at the top by a piece of gypsum. This contained two small copper urns, in one of which were some ashes mixed with a ruby, a pearl, small pieces of gold, and a small gold box, containing a piece of cloth; in the other a silver box and some ashes were found. Two copper plates containing legible inscriptions, in the Lat or cave character, accompanied the urns, and these, as far as I have yet been able to decipher them, inform us that the persons buried here were of the Buddhist faith. The smaller of the copper plates bears an inscription in two lines, the last part of which contains the Buddhist creed.&quot; 

On the east side of the hill are many squared stones, foundations, tanks, etc..., all betokening the existence at some period of a large colony of monks.

<doc id="833608" wikidata="Q3837267" url="?curid=833608" title="Los Angeles Herald Examiner">
<text>The Los Angeles Herald Examiner was a major Los Angeles daily newspaper, published in the afternoon from Monday to Friday and in the morning on Saturdays and Sundays. It was part of the Hearst syndicate. It was formed when the afternoon &quot;Herald-Express&quot; and the morning &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot;, both of which were published there since the turn of the 20th century, merged in 1962.

For a few years after the merger, the &quot;Los Angeles Herald Examiner&quot; had the largest afternoon-newspaper circulation in the US. It published its last edition on November 2, 1989.

==Early years==
William Randolph Hearst founded the &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot; in 1903, in order to assist his campaign for the presidential nomination on the Democratic ticket, complement his &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;, and provide a union-friendly answer to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. At its peak in 1960, the &quot;Examiner&quot; had a circulation of 381,037. It attracted the top newspapermen and women of the day. The &quot;Examiner&quot; flourished in the 1940s under the leadership of the city editor James H. Richardson, who led his reporters to emphasize crime and Hollywood scandal coverage.

The &quot;Los Angeles Herald Examiner&quot; was the result of a merger with the &quot;Los Angeles Herald-Express&quot; in 1962. In turn, the &quot;Herald-Express&quot; had been the result of a merger between the &quot;Los Angeles Evening Express&quot; and &quot;Evening Herald&quot; in 1931. The &quot;Herald-Express&quot; was also Hearst-owned and excelled in tabloid journalism under City Editor Agness Underwood, a veteran crime reporter for the &quot;Los Angeles Record&quot; before moving to the &quot;Herald-Express&quot; first as a reporter and later its city editor. With the merger in 1962, the newspaper became an afternoon-only newspaper.

The &quot;Examiner&quot;, while founded as a pro-labor newspaper, shifted to a hard-right stance by the 1930s, much like the rest of the Hearst chain. It was pro-law enforcement and was vehemently anti-Japanese during World War II. Its editorials openly praised the mass deportation of Mexicans, including U.S. citizens, in the early 1930s, and was hostile to liberal movements and labor strikes during the Depression. Its coverage of the Zoot Suit Riots in Los Angeles during World War II also was particularly harsh on the Mexican-American community.

Much of its conservative rhetoric was minimized when Richardson retired in 1957. Underwood remained on the staff following the merger in an upper management position, leaving the day-to-day operations to younger editors.

The Hearst Corporation decided to make the new &quot;Herald Examiner&quot; an afternoon paper, leaving the morning field to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; (which at the same time had ceased publication of the evening &quot;Mirror&quot;). However, readers&#x27; tastes and demographics were changing. Afternoon newspaper readership was declining as television news became more prominent, while expanding suburbs made it harder to distribute papers during the rush hour. The fact that sports leagues were playing more night games also meant that evening newspapers were no longer able to print full results. Indeed, by the 1950s Hearst&#x27;s morning papers such as the &quot;Examiner&quot; had their income siphoned off merely to support the chain&#x27;s faltering afternoon publications. Following the merger between the &quot;Herald-Express&quot; and &quot;Examiner&quot;, readership of the morning &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; soared to 757,000 weekday readers and more than 1 million on Sunday. The &quot;Herald Examiner&quot;‚Ä≥s circulation dropped from a high of 730,000 in the mid-1960s to 350,000 in 1977. By the time it closed in 1989 its circulation was 238,000.

==Strike and closure==
On December 15, 1967, &quot;Herald Examiner&quot; employees began a strike that lasted almost a decade and resulted in at least $15 million in losses. At the time of the labor strike, the paper&#x27;s circulation was about 721,000 daily and it had 2,000 employees. The strike ended in March 1977, with circulation having dropped to about 350,000 and the number of employees to 700.

Owner William Randolph Hearst, Jr.&#x27;s confrontational response prolonged the unrest. He hired a number of strike-breakers to keep the paper going, as well as Pinkerton guards to maintain security, protect the strike-breakers and harass the strikers. Numerous violent incidents took place between pickets and strike-breakers, as well as confrontations between the guards and the Los Angeles Police Department.

The paper enjoyed a journalistic and spiritual renaissance beginning in 1978, when Jim Bellows was hired as its editor. &quot;On January 1, Jim Bellows came to Los Angeles as editor of the worst urban daily newspaper in America, the Los Angeles Herald Examiner,&quot; read a profile in &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, in 1978. Bellows and his successor, Mary Ann Dolan, brought an infusion of new talent, youth and energy to the newsroom. The excitement of rejuvenating a newspaper in Los Angeles with a storied past attracted a stream of young journalists, many with Ivy League credentials. The paper&#x27;s scrappy, no-holds-barred, often unconventional coverage repeatedly challenged the dominant &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; on stories about City Hall, local politics, the Los Angeles Police Department, the arts and sports, and its coverage was recognized repeatedly for its excellence by the Los Angeles Press Club. The paper was also slightly eclectic: its entertainment section was hip, its sports section was blue-collar and its news hole straddled the tabloid and kick-ass journalism genres. However, as an after-effect of the 10-year long strike, advertising and circulation continued to decline.

The paper switched back to a morning publication in 1982, 20 years after the merger; this did little to improve sagging revenue and readership. Furthermore, having two editions led to higher production costs. The afternoon edition was dropped during 1989.

In 1989, the Hearst Corporation attempted to sell the moribund newspaper, but found no suitable buyers (News Corporation intended to buy the paper and turn it into a tabloid, but backed out). This led to the company&#x27;s shutting down the newspaper.

On November 2, 1989, the paper printed its last edition, with a banner head saying &quot;SO LONG, L.A.!&quot; One factor behind the shutdown was increased pressure from the competing &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, whose circulation was, at the time of the &quot;Herald Examiner&quot; shutdown, about four times larger.

Editorial writer Joel Bellman recalled that by then the newspaper&#x27;s

==Notable cases==
===Black Dahlia coverage===
:&quot;This specific section relates to the period when the newspaper was known as the Los Angeles Examiner&quot;

The &quot;Examiner&quot; was the first newspaper to break the story of the 1947 dismemberment murder of 22-year-old Elizabeth Short, who was ultimately dubbed the Black Dahlia by &quot;Los Angeles Herald-Express&quot; crime reporter Bevo Means.

&quot;Examiner&quot; news reporter Will Fowler was on another assignment with photographer Felix Paegel on January 15, 1947, when they heard a radio call of a mutilated female body found in a vacant lot on Norton Avenue in the Leimert Park area of Los Angeles. Fowler and Paegel arrived before police and observed the female body. Fowler claimed in his autobiography that he knelt down to close the victim&#x27;s eyes before Paegel began shooting photographs. City editor Richardson in his own autobiography had another, more mundane version of the &quot;Examiner&quot; obtaining the story. He said that reporter Bill Zelinsky called the city desk from Los Angeles Police headquarters to report the discovery of the body and a reporter and photographer were dispatched to the lot where a crowd of newsmen was already assembled.

Whatever the facts were, the morning &quot;Examiner&quot; scooped the other Los Angeles newspapers by publishing an extra edition two hours before any of the afternoon newspapers hit the streets.

By the late afternoon of January 15, an autopsy on the female victim was completed by the Los Angeles County Coroner&#x27;s Office. The victim&#x27;s fingerprints were scheduled to be airmailed to the FBI fingerprint identification division in Washington, D.C. &quot;Examiner&quot; Assistant Managing Editor Warden Woolard suggested to Los Angeles police Capt. Jack Donahoe, who was chief of the department&#x27;s homicide division, that the victim&#x27;s fingerprints be transmitted to the FBI by using the &quot;Examiner&quot;‚Ä≥s new soundphoto machine. During the early morning hours of January 16, the International News Photo wire service received the prints via photo transmission from the &quot;Examiner&quot;. Soon afterward, the FBI identified the victim as Elizabeth Short.

In the early afternoon of January 16 an &quot;Examiner&quot; extra hit the streets, again beating the competition. The &quot;Examiner&quot; identified Short and provided details of her life growing up in Massachusetts, and details of her adult life in Santa Barbara and later in Los Angeles. The &quot;Examiner&quot; noted that Short had lived in Los Angeles for a period of time before moving to various other cities in the pursuit of jobs and men. She returned to Los Angeles in 1946 and lived in hotels and rooming houses while visiting a man she had met while living in Florida.

Following Short&#x27;s identification, reporters from the &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot; contacted her mother, Phoebe Short, and told her that her daughter had won a beauty contest. Only after prying as much personal information as they could from Phoebe did the reporters tell her that her daughter had been murdered. The newspaper offered to pay her air fare and accommodations if she would travel to Los Angeles to help with the police investigation. That was yet another ploy, since the newspaper kept her away from police and other reporters to protect its scoop.

Each day the &quot;Examiner&quot; came up with more details of Short&#x27;s murder, and painted her as a lovelorn woman searching for a husband. The &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot; was getting hammered daily by the &quot;Examiner&quot;. The newspaper&#x27;s editors were so desperate for fresh stories that they sent rookie reporter Roy Ringer to the &quot;Examiner&quot;‚Ä≥s offices on Broadway. Ringer was new and unknown to &quot;Examiner&quot; newsmen. He walked into the &quot;Examiner&quot;‚Ä≥s composing room from off the street and lifted the Black Dahlia story proofs off the spikes and walked out. The &quot;Daily News&quot; city desk then rewrote the &quot;Examiner&#x27;s&quot; stories. After three days of stealing &quot;Examiner&quot; copy, Ringer walked into the composing room on the fourth day for a fresh batch of Black Dahlia stories. As he was about to grab a handful of proofs from the spike, someone from behind grabbed his shoulder. Behind Ringer was &quot;Examiner&quot; city editor James Richardson. &quot;Nice try&quot;, said Richardson, as he sent Ringer back to the &quot;Daily News&quot; empty-handed.

At one point an anonymous tip led &quot;Examiner&quot; reporters to the Greyhound bus station in downtown Los Angeles, where a steamer trunk owned by Short was discovered. Inside were letters, photographs and clothing belonging to the victim. The &quot;Examiner&quot; obtained the contents and led coverage of Short&#x27;s life leading up to her death based on her own personal records and in her own voice. In another instance, more photos, newspaper clippings and letters were anonymously mailed to the &quot;Examiner&quot;. Richardson often said in subsequent interviews about his years at the &quot;Examiner&quot; that he believed the letters were from Short&#x27;s killer.

The Black Dahlia case was never solved, but for three months it led most of the Los Angeles newspaper&#x27;s front pages until other sensational homicides replaced it.

===Jailing of William Farr===
During the 1970 Los Angeles murder trial of Charles Manson and his followers, who were charged with the 1969 murders of actress Sharon Tate and six others, &quot;Herald Examiner&quot; reporter William Farr reported in an article that Manson had planned to murder Elizabeth Taylor and Frank Sinatra.

Farr was summoned by judge Charles Older to divulge his sources for the article. Farr refused. But at that time, Farr had already left the &quot;Herald Examiner&quot; to work for the Los Angeles County District Attorney&#x27;s Office and later for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. Farr cited the California reporters shield law that protected him from revealing his sources, but Older ruled that since Farr was no longer a journalist he was required to hand over his notes.

Farr continued to refuse to reveal his sources and was jailed for 48 days from 1972 to January 11, 1973, on a contempt of court citation. Although he was released from custody by order of U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas while the decision was on appeal, his case dragged through the courts for several years. The courts, however, recognized that a journalist could spend the rest of his life in jail if he refuses to divulge his sources on moral principle. In 1974, a California State Court of Appeal determined in &quot;In re Farr&quot; (36 C.A. 3d 577, 1974) that a procedure had to be adopted that allowed the courts to hold a hearing to consider a contempt of court citation involving the shield law. The first issue was whether a reporter was refusing to reveal sources by invoking the shield on &quot;moral principle&quot;. The second consideration by the court was whether incarcerating the reporter would likely induce him or her to reveal the sources. In 1976, the state appellate court finally set aside the contempt citation.

The Farr case in effect strengthened the California shield law and served as a precedent in future shield law cases involving journalists.

==Building==
The &quot;Los Angeles Herald Examiner&quot; Building is at the southwest corner of Broadway and 11th Street in southern Downtown Los Angeles. Hearst paid $1 million in 1913 for the parcel, which was part of railroad magnate Henry Huntington&#x27;s land holdings. The building was designed in the Mission Revival and Spanish Colonial Revival styles, largely by San Francisco architect Julia Morgan, then associated with Los Angeles architects J. Martyn Haenke and William J. Dodd, whose contributions have not yet been determined by scholars. It was completed in 1914, and is a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument.

After the newspaper closed in 1989, the building remained in use as a popular filming location for 26 years, with its ornate, period appropriate lobby to 15 standing sets ranging from a modern police station, a courtroom, a hospital, to an industrial basement perfect for horror. It was once the second-most-filmed location in Los Angeles having hosted over 1,250 individual productions as of 2013, ranging from Hollywood blockbusters such as &quot;Short Cuts&quot; (1993), &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; (1995), the Academy Award winner, &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; (2006), to its last production, the indie film &quot;Fixed&quot; (2017), produced by longtime property manager Bryan Erwin. It was also featured in television series as varied as &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot;. The property hosted its last production in July 2015.

Georgetown Co., a New York real estate developer, obtained control of the site in 2015. Plans for an $80-million renovation by architecture firm Gensler included restaurants and shops on the ground floor and offices in the remaining space. Walter and Margarita Manzke were planning a restaurant there. In 2019, Arizona State University announced plans to locate its Los Angeles campus in the building, which was eventually opened in 2022.

==Earlier publication==

===&quot;Los Angeles Express&quot;===

The &quot;Los Angeles Express&quot; was Los Angeles&#x27;s oldest newspaper published under its original name until it merged with the &quot;Herald&quot;. It was established on March 27, 1871.

===&quot;Los Angeles Herald&quot;===

Established in 1873, the &quot;Los Angeles Herald&quot; or the &quot;Evening Herald&quot; represented the largely Democratic views of the city and focused primarily on issues local to Los Angeles and Southern California. The &quot;Los Angeles Daily Herald&quot; was first published on October 2, 1873, by Charles A. Storke. It was the first newspaper in Southern California to use the innovative steam press; the newspaper&#x27;s offices at 125 South Broadway were popular with the public because large windows on the ground floor allowed passersby to see the presses in motion. In 1922, the &quot;Herald&quot; officially joined the Hearst News empire.

===&quot;Los Angeles Herald-Express&quot;===

In 1931, Hearst merged the &quot;Los Angeles Daily Herald&quot; with the &quot;Los Angeles Evening Express&quot; to form the &quot;Los Angeles Evening Herald and Express&quot;, which was then the largest-circulating evening newspaper west of the Mississippi.

<text>Thomas Frederick Peart, Baron Peart, PC (30 April 1914 ‚Äì 26 August 1988) was a British Labour politician who served in the Labour governments of the 1960s and 1970s and was a candidate for Deputy Leader of the Party.

==Early life and education==
Thomas Frederick Peart was born in Durham, England, in 1914, the son of Emerson Featherstone Peart, a headmaster and leading Labour member of Durham County Council, and Florence Blissenden. The younger Peart qualified as a teacher at the University of Durham in 1936. During his time at university he was President of the Durham Union for Epiphany term of 1936. He studied at the Inner Temple but did not enter the legal profession, instead teaching economics in Durham. He served in the Royal Artillery in World War II, gaining the rank of captain.

==Political career==
Peart was elected Member of Parliament for Workington in 1945, serving until 1976. He initially served as PPS to the Minister of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries (Tom Williams).

Peart, along with the rest of the Labour Party, went into opposition following Winston Churchill&#x27;s 1951 election victory. In 1964, he returned to government after Harold Wilson defeated Alec Douglas-Home at that year&#x27;s election. He was appointed to the Cabinet holding the Cabinet post of Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. His tenure saw advances in pay for agricultural labourers, and in technology.

In 1968, Peart became Lord Privy Seal, with no particular responsibilities. Seven months later, Peart became Leader of the House of Commons, taking the subsidiary title Lord President of the Council. After Labour lost the 1970 election, Peart returned to opposition as Shadow Leader of the House of Commons. He held that position until December 1971, when he became Shadow Agriculture Minister. When Labour returned to power, Peart once more took the Agriculture portfolio.

On 23 September 1976, Peart was created a life peer as Baron Peart, of Workington in the County of Cumbria, to serve as Leader of the House of Lords and Lord Privy Seal at a time when the Labour faction in the Lords was tiny compared to the vast Tory majority, mainly composed of hereditary peers.

After Margaret Thatcher won the 1979 election, Peart continued as Leader of the Labour Peers and thus became Shadow Leader of the House of Lords. He served in those roles until 1982, when he was defeated for re-election by Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos in a vote among Labour peers.

==Personal life and death==
In 1945, Peart married Bette Lewis, and they had one son.

On 6 June 1975, Peart was on board the train which derailed in the Nuneaton rail crash; he survived with minor injuries.

In 1984, Peart was attacked by two robbers who broke into his London home. This preceded a terminal decline in his health, and he died at a hospital in London on 26 August 1988, at the age of 74.

<text>The New Lodge () is an urban, working class Catholic community in Belfast, Northern Ireland, immediately to the north of the city centre. The landscape is dominated by several large tower blocks. The area has a number of murals, mostly sited along the New Lodge Road. The locality is demarcated by Duncairn Gardens, Antrim Road, Clifton Street, and dependent on opinion, York Street or North Queen Street. North Queen Street and Duncairn Gardens have often seen rioting between republicans and loyalists. The New Lodge is also an electoral ward of Belfast City Council.

==History==
The area now known as the New Lodge was once open farmland within the original 17th-century city walls of the town of Belfast.

The name of the area probably derives from the farm lodge at Solitude, now the location of the home ground of Cliftonville F.C. The Old Lodge Road, now largely demolished, ran from Peter&#x27;s Hill to the bottom of the Oldpark Road, while the New Lodge Road would have continued along the line of the modern Cliftonville Road.

With Belfast&#x27;s explosive expansion as an industrial city in the 19th century, the New Lodge developed as a built up, inner-city area; its residents came from both the Protestant and Catholic communities. The area between Lepper Street and the Antrim Road was largely filled with slum housing for the workers in the Lepper Mill, while the area between York Street and North Queen Street provided the same standard of accommodation for workers in the Gallagher tobacco factory and York Street Mill on York Street.

The area between the New Lodge Road and Duncairn Gardens was historically occupied by the better-off working-class families, while Duncairn Gardens itself and Clifton Street were upmarket well into the 20th century.

Victoria Barracks, a major British army barracks, was an important feature of the area. The only remnants of it are the street name where about 10 former officers&#x27; houses remain in use today, the old barrack wall (on North Queen Street beside the police station) and the former army gym, now a social centre known locally as &quot;The Recy.&quot;

The New Lodge was heavily damaged in the Belfast Blitz in 1941, in which many streets were laid waste by the concentrated bombing on the nearby factories, mills and army barracks; Burke Street, which ran between Dawson and Annadale streets was completely levelled in the 15‚Äì16 April Easter Tuesday raid, with all its inhabitants killed. The subsequent destruction of large swathes of housing stock began a process of movement to the suburbs and depopulation which continues to the present. After the Second World War, many people from the New Lodge moved to new housing developments in suburban areas like Ballymurphy, New Barnsley, Rathcoole and Glengormley.

In the 1950s, the army barracks was closed and the area was redeveloped with a mixture of low-rise and tower block buildings. Much of the population of the &quot;Sailortown&quot; area of Belfast&#x27;s docklands moved here in the 1960s.

The New Lodge, on the edge of the city centre, with a history of active Irish republicanism and surrounded by Loyalist areas saw much violence during the Troubles. The few remaining Protestants left the area in the early 1970s as it came under increasing attack by Loyalists. They were replaced by Catholics intimidated from Loyalist areas of Belfast.

The McGurk&#x27;s Bar bombing occurred in the area on 4 December 1971 in North Queen Street; after initially being blamed on the Provisional Irish Republican Army, it was claimed by the Ulster Volunteer Force.

As a stronghold of the Third Battalion of the Provisional IRA&#x27;s Belfast Brigade, rioting and gun battles between the IRA and the British Army and loyalist paramilitaries were almost daily occurrences during the early 1970s and other periods of high political tension such as the 1981 Irish hunger strike and occurred sporadically during the rest of that period. The area was vulnerable to attacks by Loyalist paramilitaries throughout the Troubles, particularly to drive-by shootings. The corner of the New Lodge Road and the Antrim Road was statistically the most dangerous spot to stand at in Northern Ireland. The last fatal IRA attack in the area before the ceasefire came in August 1992, when guardsman Damien Shackleton was killed by a sniper.

Despite this daily life proceeded and the area benefitted from housing improvement and slum clearance during the 1980s, with new high standard public housing. However, despite this, the improvement in the general economic situation and the IRA and Loyalist ceasefires of 1994, depopulation continued apace as people left for the suburbs.

In recent years, Northern Ireland has become an attractive destination for many immigrants from the developing world and Eastern Europe, with the New Lodge seeing immigration from Poland, Latvia and Lithuania since the expansion of the European Union in 2004.

==Local politics==
The Dock Ward was one of 15 wards of Belfast City Council prior to 1973. Its boundaries were the Antrim Road, Clifton Street, North Queen St, Great George&#x27;s Street and Brougham Street. From 1973 to 1985 the eastern boundary of the New Lodge ward was North Queen Street. The boundaries were extended to York Street and Clifton Park Avenue in 1985. In 1993 the Antrim Road boundary was restored with the Unity flats area added. These boundaries are used for census information.

The Dock Ward of Belfast City Council mainly returned Unionists with slim majorities in the pre-War years, with Nationalists winning from the 1940s and becoming more dominant as time moved on. In the post-War years, the New Lodge was historically the political stronghold of Gerry Fitt.

The co-terminous Stormont parliamentary constituency was the most marginal constituency, changing hands at every election until 1965. It was won by the Ulster Unionist Party in 1929, Northern Ireland Labour Party in 1933, Unionists in 1938, NILP in 1945, Unionists in 1949, Irish Labour in 1953, Unionists in 1958, Irish Labour (Gerry Fitt) in 1962, and Republican Labour (Fitt again) in 1965 and 1969.

The Westminster parliamentary constituency was part of East Belfast until the 1974 elections and has formed part of North Belfast since then (although the areas east of North Queen Street were in West Belfast from 1983 to 1997).

Politically, Sinn F√©in now dominate the area although previously parts of the area were, along with the Lower Falls, one of the strongest areas for Official Republicanism in Belfast ‚Äì especially the areas around the Carlisle estate and Henry Street. Seamus Lynch was elected for the Republican Clubs and their successor parties between 1977 and 1993 and a social club for supporters of the Workers Party and Official IRA survived until the late 80s.

==Social conditions==
While the housing stock is now largely of a high standard, and the Belfast economy has improved dramatically from the nadir of the 1980s, the New Lodge remains an area of considerable social deprivation.

The Northern Ireland Index of Multiple Deprivation lists the New Lodge as the fifth most deprived of 581 wards in Northern Ireland, and the second most deprived in terms of income. The high score comes in spite of it being the least deprived of the 581 in terms of access to services, lying on the edge of the city centre and with major health and education facilities nearby. 70.8% of the local school population are entitled to free school meals.

Less than a quarter of households in the New Lodge own their own homes, with the vast majority renting from the Northern Ireland Housing Executive or other social landlords.

40.4% of local 16-year-olds gained five or more good GCSEs in 2002, well below the Northern Ireland average, but higher than most similarly deprived areas in England. 27.7% of 18-year-olds went on to further or higher education in the same year.

With increasing property prices in the Belfast area in recent years, a higher proportion of younger and better qualified people have stayed in the area with affordable property which is within walking distance of the city centre.

The graveyard in Henry Place houses the graves of many people prominent in Belfast&#x27;s history, most notably United Irishman Henry Joy McCracken

The area is quite close to all amenities including the City Centre, the Mater Hospital and Cityside (Yorkgate) Shopping Centre. A previous attempt was made to establish a local supermarket at the Ashton Centre however this failed after the opening of the Yorkgate complex in 1991.

==Culture==
In common with similar areas, much local cultural and social life revolves around the pub scene, in the New Lodge itself and in the nearby Docks area. Live rock, blues, techno and Irish traditional music are regularly performed.

The New Lodge Festival was devised as an alternative to the traditional Internment Night bonfire, which often led to violence. The festival is linked to the West Belfast Festival and Ardoyne fleadh and sees a wide range of musical events, children&#x27;s activities, amateur sport and historical and cultural discussions.

Many local people are passionate football fans. Gaelic football and boxing are also popular ‚Äì Hugh Russell, who won a flyweight bronze medal in the 1980 Moscow Olympics came from the area and still lives nearby.

In September 2011, pop star Rihanna chose to film scenes for her music video We Found Love in the New Lodge area.

==2001 Census==
The New Lodge is one of the 60 wards of Belfast City Council. On Census day (29 April 2001) there were 5,224 people living in New Lodge ward. Of these:

* 25.7% were under 16 years old and 18.4% were aged 60 and above;
* 46.6% of the population were male and 53.4% were female; and
* 97.3% were from a Catholic Community Background and 2.2% were from a &#x27;Protestant and Other Christian (including Christian related)&#x27; Community Background.

<text>Bullseye (Lester) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by Marv Wolfman and John Romita Sr. Depicted as a psychopathic assassin, Bullseye uses the opportunities afforded by his line of work to exercise his homicidal tendencies and to work out his own personal vendetta against Daredevil. He is also an enemy of the Punisher, a partner of Deadpool, and the mentor of Funhouse. Although he possesses no superpowers, Bullseye is able to use almost any object as a lethal projectile, be it weapons like shuriken and sai or seemingly harmless objects like playing cards and pencils. His marksmanship is uncanny, at a nearly supernatural level. The alternate continuities of &quot;Daredevil Noir&quot;, &quot;PunisherMAX&quot;, and Ultimate Marvel respectively feature the original Bullseye incarnations Eliza, Shelton Pendergrass, and Benjamin &quot;Dex&quot; Poindexter.

Bullseye has been adapted into various forms of media relating to Daredevil, with live-action portrayals including Colin Farrell in the film &quot;Daredevil&quot; (2003), Wilson Bethel as Poindexter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) television series, and Curtis Small in the MCU film &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot; (2024).

==Publication history==
The character&#x27;s first appearance is in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #131 (March 1976). Although created by writer Marv Wolfman and artist John Romita Sr., the book features art by Bob Brown and Klaus Janson.

Bullseye&#x27;s real name and origins are unknown. He uses the name &quot;Benjamin Poindexter&quot; on several occasions, first mentioned in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #159 (1979) where he goes by the name &quot;Mr. Poindexter,&quot; which he later claims is &quot;just one of the many names he used&quot; (&quot;Daredevil&quot; #181, 1982). However, there are also instances where his name is given as ‚ÄúLester&quot;. The miniseries &quot;Bullseye: Greatest Hits&quot; (2004) developed the character&#x27;s backstory, but also revealed that some or all of it has been fabricated, probably by Bullseye himself. In this series, Bullseye&#x27;s name was Leonard and his brother‚Äôs was Lester or, initially, Nate.

Following &quot;Civil War&quot;, Warren Ellis took over writing &quot;Thunderbolts&quot; and Bullseye became one of the core members of the new team line-up.

In the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; aftermath storyline &quot;Dark Reign&quot;, Bullseye becomes a member of the Dark Avengers under the alias Hawkeye and features in a five-issue limited series &quot;Dark Reign: Hawkeye&quot;, written by Andy Diggle, with art by Tom Raney. As a member of the Dark Avengers, he has a major role in the crossover &quot;Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Utopia&quot;, written by Matt Fraction. He appeared as a regular character in &quot;Dark Avengers&quot; #1-16 (March 2009-June 2010).

Bullseye is killed by Daredevil in &quot;Shadowland&quot; #1, but is later confirmed alive in &quot;Daredevil&quot; vol. 3 #26.

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life and backstory===
Bullseye grew up in The Bronx, New York City, New York, where he lived with his brother and their abusive father. He became an expert shot by playing with his brother&#x27;s rifles. When he was 10 years old, his brother tried to kill their father by setting fire to their home; shortly thereafter, Bullseye was placed in a foster home. In high school, he became a baseball player. An extremely talented pitcher, he was offered a college athletic scholarship, but opted to enter the minor leagues. After three games, he was called up to start a sold-out Major League game. He had surrendered no hits, and in the bottom of the ninth with two outs, he became bored and asked the coach pull him from the game. The coach insisted that he finish the game. After the opposing team&#x27;s batter mocked him as a coward, Bullseye threw the ball at his head, killing him. As the ball struck, he said, &quot;Bullseye&quot;. He was barred from professional baseball and convicted of manslaughter.

This is a retcon of a previous origin story, which depicts Bullseye growing up as a below average student in a trailer park with an alcoholic, physically abusive father. In this version of events, Bullseye fakes his father&#x27;s suicide using a handgun set off by a toy arrow. It is unclear how many elements of this version are actually true.

Bullseye&#x27;s cold demeanor and unique skills led to his recruitment by the National Security Agency as an assassin, then an assignment to train Contras in Nicaragua. By the time he arrived, however, he claimed to have already been planning to leave the NSA. He had planned on robbing the Contras and fleeing, but he discovered they were desperately poor. Bullseye made the best of the situation: within seven hours of being informed of their poverty, he had led the Contras in seizing a landing strip that Colombian cocaine smugglers were using as a staging area before transporting the drugs to the US. Without use of the airfield, the smugglers were unable to send new shipments. Bullseye set up his hapless Nicaraguan translator Paolo as the leader of the new force controlling the airfield, and let the word spread around; however, Paolo was nothing but a . Bullseye planned to invite several organized crime heads to the airfield to broker a new deal with him as Paolo&#x27;s supposed . He would take their money and disappear, presumably leaving Paolo to suffer the wrath of the Mafia, Russian mafia, yakuza, and various other criminal elements. However, before the deal could be finalized, the Punisher (Frank Castle) arrived.

Castle killed all the organized crime leaders in a fiery explosion from which Bullseye barely escaped. The two engaged in a fierce battle in which Bullseye was able to wound the Punisher and evade or disable several of his weapons. Bullseye then used some blood-reddened mud to paint a bull&#x27;s-eye on his forehead, mocking Castle&#x27;s inability to hit him. The fight concluded when Drug Enforcement Administration agents arrived, and the Punisher fled. Bullseye turned himself in to the D.E.A. agents and soon was assigned to infiltrate the Kingpin&#x27;s criminal empire. He obtained a costume, fled yet again, and became one of the most dangerous hitmen in the world.

All of the above information is given by Bullseye during a subsequent interrogation by US intelligence. Just prior to escaping from custody, Bullseye confesses he made up some or all of his story to amuse himself; for example, he claims that he was really the one who started the fire which burned down his childhood home. The whole capture was a plan by the assassin to gain access to the prison where his father is being held. Bullseye finally gets revenge on his father, leaving him to burn as the prison&#x27;s security systems torch everything inside.

===Costumed criminal career===
Bullseye battles (and defeats) Daredevil at a circus to establish his reputation as an extortionist. Shortly after, Daredevil by chance overhears him in the midst of an extortion attempt and captures him. Bullseye is later hired by Maxwell Glenn to kill Matt Murdock and Foggy Nelson, and Daredevil interferes. Although Bullseye wins again, Daredevil escapes death, and Bullseye&#x27;s professional reputation is damaged as a result. Seeking to regain his credibility, he challenges Daredevil on live television, but is soundly defeated.

Smarting from this even harsher blow to his reputation, Bullseye hires Eric Slaughter&#x27;s gang and kidnaps the Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff) to bait Daredevil into a revenge bout. Daredevil defeats him again, and the despair of this repeated humiliation drives him to a mental breakdown. It is later revealed that this breakdown was in part caused by a brain tumor, which begins causing migraines, paranoia and hallucinations that everyone he meets is Daredevil. He escapes from prison, but is recaptured by Daredevil, and the tumor is successfully removed. The tumor&#x27;s symptoms quickly disappear, and defense lawyers are able to have him freed on the argument that his criminal behavior was caused solely by the brain tumor. He is hired to assassinate the Kingpin, but meets with repeated failure. Inexplicably, this convinces the Kingpin to employ him as a chief assassin, but he is fired the same day he witnesses the Kingpin&#x27;s humiliating defeat at Daredevil&#x27;s hands. Bullseye&#x27;s repeated failed attempts to regain this briefly-held position became a running joke of the &quot;Daredevil&quot; series.

While in prison, he learns that the Kingpin has employed Elektra (Daredevil&#x27;s former lover) as a new chief assassin. After escaping prison, Bullseye attacks and impales Elektra on her own sai. This fails to convince the Kingpin, who says he will only be rehired if Bullseye kills Daredevil. Bullseye attempts to ambush Daredevil, but their battle ends with his arch-foe dropping him from atop a telephone wire. The multi-story fall breaks Bullseye&#x27;s back, paralyzing him.

During Bullseye&#x27;s extended hospital stay following the fall, Daredevil breaks into his hospital room and forces him to participate in a two-man variation on Russian roulette. The revolver used in the game is secretly unloaded, but Daredevil has Bullseye take the even-numbered turns so that he would feel sure that the last shot is going to kill him. Bullseye has repeatedly cited this incident as his greatest grudge against Daredevil.

Japanese scientist Lord Dark Wind liberates Bullseye and has him brought to Japan, lacing his bones with adamantium and thus restoring his mobility. Lord Dark Wind did this so that Bullseye would work as an assassin in return, but in spite of this favor being done for him, Bullseye refuses to work for free. He instead makes another play to regain the position of the Kingpin&#x27;s chief assassin once again if he kills Daredevil, knowing he would fail. Bullseye is imprisoned for several years.

Bullseye eventually escapes prison, and then battles Captain America. He battles Crossbones in an attempt to assassinate the Red Skull to regain his old position with the Kingpin.

After encountering the amnesiac Daredevil, he takes advantage of this by committing robberies while impersonating Daredevil in an attempt to destroy his nemesis&#x27;s image. In one of his early heists, he is caught by his mark&#x27;s disillusioned trophy wife. He becomes enamored of the wife who pleads with him to be taken away by him, but he keeps the wife in his derelict hideout as his lover, attempting to flatter her by showering her with stolen money and jewelry. However, the woman realizes that he is mentally fragile and, frightened by one of his psychotic outbursts, leaves him. Gradually, Bullseye becomes so immersed in his Daredevil impersonation that he believes himself to truly be Daredevil, a confusion which the real hero takes advantage of to defeat him.

Bullseye later has another run-in with the Punisher when he is part of Frank&#x27;s frame-up scheme that ends with Bullseye getting both of his hands shot and losing a finger to the Punisher&#x27;s brutality. Bullseye encounters Deadpool and Gambit during another long interval in which the character was seldom used.

Bullseye is hired by the villain Mysterio to attack and confuse Daredevil. In the course of their battle, Bullseye kills Karen Page (Daredevil&#x27;s long-time love interest) with one of Daredevil&#x27;s own billy clubs.

Bullseye is recruited to steal the &quot;Identity Disc&quot;, purported to be in possession of AIM and have vital information on the world&#x27;s superheroes, along with Deadpool, Sabretooth, Vulture, and Juggernaut.

Bullseye again offers to kill Daredevil for Kingpin, later entering Daredevil&#x27;s apartment and attempting to kill Milla Donovan (Daredevil&#x27;s new girlfriend). Enraged and already near the breaking point, Daredevil attacks Bullseye and throws him out the window. During the fight, the hero reveals to Bullseye that he knows his real name Lester, his mother was a prostitute, and that he never knew his father. He mocks the assassin&#x27;s new &#x27;Bullseye&#x27; tattoo and carves a new one over it with a rock.

Bullseye seeks purported documents confirming Daredevil&#x27;s secret identity. After a brutal fight with Daredevil and Elektra, Bullseye flees into open traffic where he is hit by a truck, sustaining severe injuries.

===Thunderbolts===

Bullseye, along with many other villains, is recruited into the Thunderbolts by Iron Man and Mister Fantastic to hunt down anti-registration superheroes in the &quot;Civil War&quot; storyline. Afterwards, he is recruited by Norman Osborn into the reformed team led by Moonstone. He operates invisibly and is not seen by the public. He is used as a last resort and has a nano-chain fed into his system, so if he disobeys orders, he will receive an electrical shock.

Bullseye fights American Eagle after having been deceived by Songbird and told that his nano-chain is disabled. During the fight, he simultaneously receives an electrical shock from the nano-chain in his system on order of Moonstone and is attacked by American Eagle. American Eagle beats him severely, mocking him throughout for purposely avoiding fights with superpowered foes, and finally breaks Bullseye&#x27;s neck. As a result of the damage sustained from both being attacked by a man with superhuman strength and being shocked by the nano-chain, Bullseye is paralyzed, is unable to speak, and has incurred severe brain injuries. Bullseye is later shown walking due to nanomechanical surgery, then goes on a killing spree using scalpels to &quot;get some target practice in&quot;. Later, he joins the Thunderbolts in their efforts to assassinate Moon Knight.

Bullseye was with the Thunderbolts when they fought the Skrulls in Washington DC. He took advantage of the clone of Andrea von Strucker being distracted by Moonstone to kill Andrea, and nearly killed Moonstone in the process. Bullseye travels along with the other Thunderbolts to Central Park and joins the final battle against the main Skrull force. Obtaining a missile launcher from the Zeus, he fires a rocket through the Skrull Yellowjacket&#x27;s right eye, thus disabling the Skrull from engaging with other heroes. Osborn orders Bullseye to kill Songbird, finally giving Bullseye the chance for revenge. Bullseye nearly succeeds, but is incapacitated by the Swordsman helping Songbird escape.

===Dark Avengers===

As a reward for his role during the Skrull invasion, Bullseye is placed on the Dark Avengers and given the costume and codename of Hawkeye.

On the Dark Avengers&#x27; first mission, he kills Morgana le Fey only for the sorceress to return yet again with an army of demons.

When the Dark Avengers fight a rogue Hulkbuster robot, &quot;Hawkeye&quot; disables the robot after killing its pilot. When the robot falls and kills 36 civilians, Osborn reprimands Bullseye for his part in the deaths, to which Bullseye demands credit for his kills. &quot;Hawkeye&quot; then goes out and saves a woman from being attacked by three men. He kills the men, and the woman inadvertently infuriates him by referring to Osborn as &quot;his boss&quot;. After he kills the woman, he notices a news crew in a helicopter filming the action. He silences the news crew by blowing up the helicopter.

Bullseye is used to take out his old partner Deadpool. Deadpool eventually gains the upper hand and stabs Bullseye through the chest with a meat hook, who later wakes up in a hospital and goes after Deadpool again. Deadpool easily avoids Bullseye&#x27;s attacks, then runs Bullseye down, stopping with one of the vehicle&#x27;s tires on Bullseye&#x27;s leg. Bullseye pays off Deadpool (under the pretense that Osborn told him to do so) to save himself.

Elektra stabs Bullseye with his own arrow.

Bullseye is later given the order by Osborn to eliminate Daredevil, who has been discovered leading the Hand. Daredevil (who is going through the trials needed to join the Hand) and Bullseye clash. Bullseye booby-traps a building with 100 people in it. Daredevil continues to battle Bullseye unaware that the building is rigged and that Bullseye has the detonator. When the building explodes, Bullseye escapes and leaves Daredevil to his grief, mocking that if Daredevil had chosen to kill him the people in the building might have been saved.

Molecule Man turns Bullseye into a pool of water to subdue him; however, as a liquid he still tries to attack Molecule Man. He is restored by the Sentry. He is also part of the team when they go to Manhattan to look for Noh-Varr. The Sentry finds him first but is distracted and leaves the battle later to find Noh-Varr gone.

Osborn later assigns Bullseye with the duty to kill Lindy Reynolds (Sentry&#x27;s wife). He takes Lindy for a helicopter ride, and strangles and dumps Lindy&#x27;s body in the ocean. When the Sentry questions him about Lindy&#x27;s whereabouts, Bullseye claims Lindy committed suicide over the countryside by jumping out of the copter, and the Sentry flies off to find Lindy.

===Shadowland===
In the aftermath of Siege, Bullseye is incarcerated and sent to the Raft. But in the process of being transferred there, he manages to kill his captors and escapes. He returns to Hell&#x27;s Kitchen and arrives at Shadowland, Daredevil&#x27;s fortress, and is confronted by Daredevil and a legion of Hand ninjas. Bullseye is unprepared for his enemy&#x27;s newfound ruthlessness as Daredevil dislocates both his shoulders and then stabs him through the heart with his own sai, killing him in a similar way to how Bullseye had killed Elektra years before. Later, a group of Hells Bikers put together an unauthorized funeral service (as J. Jonah Jameson had expressly forbade) for Bullseye; Ben Urich is dragged along, as well as Danny Deaver. Deaver continually sees visions of Bullseye; it is not clear whether or not it is Bullseye&#x27;s spirit or simply part of Deaver&#x27;s psychosis. Bullseye&#x27;s funeral service is interrupted by Daredevil and the Hand which results in a massive brawl. Urich is nearly killed. Daredevil later exhumes Bullseye&#x27;s corpse, intending to resurrect him as a soldier loyal to the Hand. The heroes interrupt the ceremony ‚Äî Spider-Man explicitly noting that the only thing worse than killing Bullseye is the idea of bringing him back ‚Äî preventing Bullseye&#x27;s resurrection.

===Return===
Bullseye&#x27;s body was later stolen by Lady Bullseye and The Hand from SHIELD custody, but a botched resurrection left him an invalid who had to rely on a life support system to survive. To get revenge, he is revealed to be the mastermind behind Klaw, Coyote, and Ikari&#x27;s actions against Daredevil. He is later found by the hero who defeated Ikari and Lady Bullseye. The warehouse where they were is subsequently destroyed, and Bullseye is nearly drowned in radioactive waste, leaving him scarred and blind.

Bullseye would go on to have his body-fully repaired by the Hand in an encounter with Elektra when he was contracted by the Assassins Guild to target Elektra&#x27;s allies.

During the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, Bullseye is among the villains attending the Kingpin&#x27;s viewing party of the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610.

During the &quot;Infinity Wars&quot; storyline, Bullseye is among the villains that accompany Turk Barrett to his meeting with the Infinity Watch at Central Park.

When Daredevil&#x27;s prot√©g√© Blindspot was left blinded by the villain Muse, Matt Murdock put out a bounty on himself out of guilt, attracting the attention of Bullseye and several other supervillains. Daredevil beat Bullseye and then revealed that he had put the contract out in hopes of luring Bullseye, as Blindspot&#x27;s condition reminded Daredevil of the murder of Karen Page.

Hired by the Hood, Bullseye impersonates Ronin to commit crimes to ruin Hawkeye&#x27;s reputation, however, Clint Barton uses Bullseye&#x27;s identity and defeats the psychotic killer.

After &quot;The War of the Realms&quot;, Bullseye steals Dragonfang, a mystical sword of the deceased Valkyrie, and uses it to mortally wound Heimdall. This earns him the enmity of the current Valkyrie Jane Foster who stops Bullseye by destroying Dragonfang.

While accompanied by an unnamed female ninja, Bullseye heads into an abandoned karate dojo and places an article about Spider-Boy on the wall. He tells the ninja to throw her shurikens and she successfully lands a bullseye on them. A flashback revealed that Spider-Boy crashed Daredevil&#x27;s match with Bullseye and ended up winning the Golden Fang Trophy. When Spider-Boy takes Daredevil to the top of the Daily Bugle to retrieve the trophy, they are ambushed by Bullseye and his apprentice Maka Akana, who is dressed as &quot;Spider-Girl&quot;. After catching one of Akana&#x27;s shurikens, Daredevil finds that it is covered in a non-lethal poison. After a brief fight with Spider-Boy, Akana webs up Spider-Boy and Daredevil with her barbed webbing before she and Bullseye get away with the Golden Fang Trophy. Daredevil and Spider-Boy follow them to Madripoor. In a flashback, Bullseye discovered Maka Akana after seeing her dive at Kawainui Falls, Hawaii and having seen her other stuff online that leads to him taking her in as a student and intended successor, developing a father-daughter relationship, before she took on the villain name Funhouse. Arriving in Madripoor, Bullseye and Funhouse arrive at the Challenge of the Jade Dragon tournament overseen by the Gaping Maw. To their surprise, Daredevil and Spider-Boy show up to partake in the tournament after claiming their item of entry from the sumo wrestler Enormo and his student Hulkette offscreen. Bullseye and Funhouse watch Spider-Boy and Daredevil as they face off against El Gigante and La Mota. Following Spider-Boy and Daredevil&#x27;s victory, Bullseye and Funhouse face off against the Perfect Golden Duo. After Funhouse punches Liu enough to knock his teeth out, Bullseye receives them as he uses the teeth to improvise a brass knuckle. They managed to defeat the Perfect Golden Duo. After reuniting with Bullseye after having ramen with Spider-Boy, Bullseye tells Funhouse that the Sisters of Stone won their match, before he and Funhouse watch Spider-Boy and Daredevil face off against Bengal and Tigris. When Spider-Boy and Daredevil defeat Bengal and Tigris, Bullseye and Spider-Girl fight the Sisters of Stone next as Bullseye gives the official his weapons. They defeated them where Spider-Girl copies the abilities of a Gaping Maw warrior. Bullseye and Spider-Girl face off against Daredevil and Spider-Boy where Mist orders her warriors to look away so that Spider-Girl can&#x27;t copy their abilities again. Spider-Boy gets a spider-sense that Bullseye might double-cross Spider-Girl. Bullseye has Spider-Girl fight Daredevil while he fights Spider-Boy. When Bullseye rips Spider-Boy&#x27;s backpack off and starts to beat him with it, Daredevil yields.

==Powers and abilities==
Bullseye has an innate ability to throw virtually any object as a projectile with incredible accuracy and with enough force to be lethal. Some of his accomplishments include lacerating a person&#x27;s throat with a thrown playing card or with a drinking straw, spitting his own tooth through a human skull, tossing a paper airplane to a distant rooftop, cutting a person&#x27;s throat, killing people with screws, and killing a person with a toothpick thrown through a window from a hundred yards away. Aside from his ability to throw projectiles with lethal accuracy, Bullseye is also a skilled hand-to-hand combatant and has been trained in karate. He is also extremely talented in the use of edged/throwing weapons and conventional firearms. Bullseye has exceptional physical conditioning, with the agility, reflexes, stamina, and speed of a professional athlete. Bullseye also has a high pain tolerance.

After falling from a building, many of Bullseye&#x27;s bones were reinforced with strips of adamantium. This has increased his resistance to injury in unarmed combat and allows him to perform acrobatic maneuvers that would fracture ordinary human bones. Unlike Wolverine, whose adamantium was implanted using stolen and incomplete notes on the bonding process and who survived only because of his mutant healing factor, Bullseye&#x27;s surgery was performed properly by Lord Dark Wind himself, and thus included the special herb treatment which prevents the body from being destroyed by the implantation.

Bullseye has a compulsive need to study his targets&#x27; histories, abilities, and relationships before engaging them. He employs this information to attempt to anticipate his opponents&#x27; movements in combat. This compulsion often crosses from the professional into the personal, such as Bullseye&#x27;s obsession with Elektra. Due to a mutual head injury, Bullseye was able to sense Daredevil&#x27;s presence psychically for a brief time.

==Reception==
Bullseye was 20th in IGN&#x27;s list of the &quot;Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time&quot;, and 35th in their list of &quot;The Top 50 Avengers&quot;.

==Other versions==
===Amalgam Comics===
In the Amalgam Comics continuity, Bullseye is combined with DC Comics&#x27;s Deadshot to create Deadeye.

===&quot;Daredevil Noir&quot;===
In &quot;Daredevil Noir&quot;, Bullseye is a woman named Eliza. She is Daredevil&#x27;s love interest until her identity as the Bullseye Killer is revealed in issue #3. Daredevil battles her and the two fall into the sea, but Daredevil still loves her and is unable to kill her. Eliza is left on the docks unconscious and taken into police custody.

===&quot;Marvel 1602&quot;===
In the &quot;Marvel 1602&quot; universe (Earth-311), Bull&#x27;s Eye appears as an assassin/first mate for the villainous Captain Wilson Fiske (The King&#x27;s Pin). He is heavily tattooed around the face and arms, and possesses the mainstream Bullseye&#x27;s abilities. He is sent by his captain with orders to kill Peter Parquagh aka the 1602 version of Spider-Man. He is attacked by the 1602 version of the Lizard and presumably perishes.

===&quot;Old Man Logan&quot;===
In &quot;Old Man Hawkeye&quot;, a prequel to the &quot;Old Man Logan&quot; comic, Bullseye appears as a Marshal who works for the Red Skull and goes against his superior&#x27;s orders to track down Hawkeye as he has missed the thrill of fighting a superhero for the last couple of decades. This version has a cybernetic eye implant that increases his aiming abilities.

In Old Man Logan&#x27;s flashback, Mysterio used an illusion of Bullseye and other villains to trick Wolverine into killing his fellow X-Men. The Bullseye illusion was used on Jubilee by the time Wolverine unintentionally killed her.

===PunisherMAX===

A version of Bullseye appears in Jason Aaron&#x27;s run on &quot;PunisherMax&quot; starting with issue #6. This version of Bullseye is hired by the Kingpin to kill the Punisher. He does not wear a costume but has a bullseye tattooed on his forehead. Although his abilities are more realistic than in the mainstream Marvel continuity, he is still a very talented marksman and a deadly fighter, proficient with a variety of weapons. His real name is Shelton Pendergrass.

This version is psychopathic/sociopathic and shows extreme obsessive compulsive tendencies toward his targets. He is said to have gassed an entire elementary school when some children were witness to a mob hit and then killed the rest of the town with bombs at the mass funeral. Obsessing with getting inside the Punisher&#x27;s head, Bullseye kills the father of a suburban family and takes the wife and children hostage, putting himself in the role of their new husband and father. He then arranges for gunmen to kill the family in front of him to recreate The Punisher&#x27;s origin. He fails to feel why The Punisher was upset by this occurrence. Off-panel Bullseye repeats the same experiment with three more families.

Eventually, Bullseye realizes what was the last thing the Punisher said to his wife. This realization sends the Punisher into shock and sends a near-death Bullseye into a smiling coma. Later, Punisher finds Bullseye&#x27;s coma bed and shoots him in the head.

===&quot;Secret Wars&quot; (2015)===
During the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, different versions of Bullseye resided on the different domains of Battleworld:

* A Wild West version of Bullseye resides on the Battleworld domain of the Valley of Doom. He works for Governor Roxxon alongside Elektra, Grizzly, and Otto Octavius. Bullseye and his fellow crooks were first seen having been sent by Governor Roxxon to intimidate Judge Franklin Nelson into leaving town so that the latter would not preside over Red Wolf&#x27;s trial. Sheriff Steve Rogers and Red Wolf later fight Bullseye, Elektra, Grizzly, and Octavius when they are ordered by Mayor Wilson Fisk into killing Red Wolf. While Sheriff Rogers was able to incapacitate Bullseye following Octavius&#x27;s death, he briefly recovers where he manages to shoot Sheriff Rogers starting to expose Mayor Fisk&#x27;s corruption. When Red Wolf faces off against Bullseye, Elektra, and Grizzly again, Red Wolf manages to defeat the three villains.
* A variation of Bullseye resides in the Battleworld domain of Killville. He was sent by the Assassin Guild to target Doctor Octopus only to be killed by MODOK.

===Ultimate Marvel===
The Ultimate Marvel version of Bullseye is named Benjamin Poindexter, first appearing in &quot;Ultimate Elektra&quot;. He works as the Kingpin&#x27;s prime assassin until Elektra beats him in direct hand-to-hand combat. He employs disguises on his hits and dons a variation of his regular Marvel Universe incarnation&#x27;s costume (sans mask) at one point.

During the &quot;Ultimate Invasion&quot; storyline, Maker traveled to Earth-6160 and remade it into his own image. Lester is a bodyguard and assassin implied to be from the European Coalition and serves as an employee of Wilson Fisk, being present during a board meeting at the Daily Bugle, on the day when J. Jonah Jameson and Ben Parker resigned. When leaving, the limousine that Fisk and Lester were about to use was bombed by the Green Goblin.

He relates that what happened to his eye at the hands of Iron Lad led to Lester and his siblings tearing out one of their eyes in solidarity. Then he questions Harry&#x27;s resolve on being a hero. on which Harry just quotes &quot;Am I a boy... or a man? Am I a hero... or something else? I guess we&#x27;re about to find out&quot;.

===&quot;What If?&quot;===
In &quot;What If Daredevil Lived in Feudal Japan?&quot;, Matt &quot;Bullseye&quot; Murdock was a 19th-century sharpshooter and the great-great-grandfather of millionaire playboy and bestselling author Matthew Murdock. In 1857, Matt served as a cabin boy on the first American naval vessel to visit Japan. The entire crew besides Matt was killed by The Devil Who Dares, a ronin forced into service by the Giant Shogun in return for restoring his blinded son&#x27;s sight. The Shogun planned to steal the ship&#x27;s cargo of gunpowder and ammunition; however, Matt detonated the explosives and destroyed the ship, escaping in a lifeboat. He returned to America and served in the Civil War, becoming an expert marksman. He was hired by the Shogun as a mercenary to kill the Devil&#x27;s son, who had adopted his father&#x27;s identity. Realising that the Shogun was the true architect of his friend&#x27;s deaths and troubled when the Shogun ordered him to kill the Devil&#x27;s partner Elektra in cold blood, Bullseye stood by and allowed Devil to kill him. Bullseye became the Devil&#x27;s friend and was eventually appointed the first American ambassador to Japan. His great-great-grandson wrote a best selling novel based on the Devil&#x27;s adventures.

==In other media==
===Television===
* An original alternate incarnation of Bullseye, Clint Barton, appears in the animated series &quot;Avengers Assemble&quot; episode &quot;Planet Doom&quot; (2013).

===Film===
* Bullseye is portrayed by Colin Farrell in &quot;Daredevil&quot; (2003). This version has an Irish background and his traditional costume was dropped in favor of a biker/metalhead style appearance and a shaved head with a bullseye branding on his forehead. Additionally, he primarily wields shurikens, though he also uses other small objects with as much ease. Prior to the film&#x27;s release, the comic book version adopted a near-identical appearance, but has since reverted to the traditional look, retaining only the scar. Director Mark Steven Johnson credited Joe Quesada for talking him out of using the traditional costume. Additionally, Farrell was encouraged to keep his Irish accent. He also had to read Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;Daredevil&quot; comics to understand Bullseye: &quot;because the expression on the character&#x27;s faces in the comic books, and just the way they move sometimes, and the exaggerations of the character I&#x27;m playing [...] he&#x27;s so over-the-top that you do draw from that. But it&#x27;s not exactly a character you can do method acting for... you know, running around New York killing people with paper clips.&quot; In the film&#x27;s plot, after being hired by the Kingpin to kill Nikolas Natchios, Bullseye fights Daredevil, who he sees as a personal challenge as the latter is the first target he ever missed, before successfully killing Nikolas and Elektra Natchios. Daredevil and Bullseye&#x27;s subsequent fight takes them to a church, where the former eventually maneuvers the latter into having his hands shot by an ESU sniper before throwing Bullseye out of a window and onto Ben Urich&#x27;s car. Following this, Bullseye is hospitalized, but maintains use of his expert marksmanship skills.

After drawing Wilson Fisk&#x27;s attention while protecting the latter from assailants, he is manipulated into donning a replica Daredevil suit and carrying out hits in an attempt to both impugn the real Daredevil&#x27;s reputation and neutralize threats to Fisk&#x27;s resurgence as a crime lord. While operating as Daredevil, Dex battles the real Daredevil twice, forms a relationship with a civilian named Julie before Fisk has her killed to manipulate Dex further, and kills his former partner, Agent Ray Nadeem, on Vanessa Marianna&#x27;s orders. Upon learning from Daredevil that he was being manipulated, Dex crashes Fisk and Vanessa&#x27;s wedding reception to seek revenge.

<text>James Timothy McCarver (October 16, 1941 ‚Äì February 16, 2023) was an American professional baseball catcher, television sports commentator, and singer. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1959 to 1980 for four teams, spending almost all of his career with the St. Louis Cardinals and Philadelphia Phillies. A two-time All-Star, he helped the Cardinals to the 1964 World Series title, batting .478 in the Series, including a three-run home run in the tenth inning to win Game 5. In 1966, he became the first catcher since the 19th century to lead the National League (NL) in triples with 13. McCarver was runner-up for the 1967 NL Most Valuable Player Award, behind teammate Orlando Cepeda, after batting .295 and leading NL catchers in assists and fielding percentage.

Traded to the Phillies after the 1969 season, he was later re-joined by pitcher and St. Louis teammate Steve Carlton, becoming his regular catcher as the team won three division titles from 1976 to 1978. After increased use as a pinch hitter in his last several seasons, in September 1980, McCarver became the 18th major league player to play in four decades.

After his playing career, McCarver became a television color commentator, most notably for Fox Sports after previous stints with the other three broadcast networks. He eventually set a record by calling 23 World Series as well as 20 All-Star Games, earning three Emmy Awards in the process. In 2012, McCarver was named the Ford C. Frick Award recipient. He was inducted into the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame in 2016, and the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame in 2017.

==Playing career==
===Early life===
McCarver was born in Memphis, Tennessee, where he attended Christian Brothers High School. He was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals in 1959. After playing in the minor leagues with the Keokuk Indians and the Rochester Red Wings, McCarver reached the Major Leagues for the first time at 17.

McCarver spent the 1960 season with the Memphis Chicks, the 1961 season with the Charleston Charlies, and the 1962 season with the Atlanta Crackers, receiving brief promotions to the major leagues in the 1960 and 1961 seasons. In 1963, he was promoted to the Major Leagues for good.

===St. Louis Cardinals===
McCarver hit the tie-breaking home run in the 10th inning, winning Game 5 of the 1964 World Series for the Cardinals. In 1966, McCarver was named to the All-Star Team, scored the winning run in the 10th inning of that 1966 All-Star Game, and became the first catcher to lead the National League in triples, with 13. In 1967, he finished second to teammate Orlando Cepeda for the National League Most Valuable Player award.

McCarver was a member of two World Series champion teams in St. Louis. He was the favorite catcher of the notoriously temperamental Bob Gibson, and he fostered a relationship with young pitcher Steve Carlton that would keep him in the Major Leagues later in his career. In 1968, McCarver was the Cardinals catcher as they won the NL pennant but were ultimately defeated by the Detroit Tigers in a seven-game World Series.

===Later career===
After the 1969 season, the Cardinals traded McCarver, Curt Flood, Joe Hoerner, and Byron Browne to the Philadelphia Phillies for Dick Allen, Cookie Rojas, and Jerry Johnson. On June 14, 1972, the Phillies traded McCarver to the Montreal Expos for John Bateman. The Expos used McCarver as an outfielder. The Cardinals re-acquired McCarver from the Expos for Jorge Roque after the 1972 season. The Boston Red Sox purchased McCarver from the Cardinals towards the end of the 1974 season. The Red Sox released McCarver in June 1975. He signed with the Phillies a week later.
During his first stint with the Phillies, McCarver caught Rick Wise&#x27;s no-hitter on June 23, 1971. At the end of the season, the Phillies traded Wise to the Cardinals for Steve Carlton, reuniting McCarver with his former teammate. During the 1972 season, the Phillies traded McCarver to the Montreal Expos, where, on October 2, he caught the second of Bill Stoneman&#x27;s two career no-hitters. McCarver finished his career as Carlton&#x27;s personal catcher for the Phillies in the late 1970s.

McCarver retired after the 1979 season to begin a broadcasting career. McCarver briefly returned to duty in September 1980, becoming one of 31 players to appear in Major League games in four decades (1950s‚Äì1980s).

He caught 121 shutouts during his career, ranking him 9th all-time.

==Broadcasting career==
After retiring from playing, McCarver worked in sports broadcasting as a color commentator for several decades. He won three Emmy Awards for Sports Event Analyst.

===Local broadcasts===
He began his broadcasting career at WPHL-TV (Channel 17) in Philadelphia, where he called Phillies games with Richie Ashburn and Harry Kalas. McCarver called games for local sports networks carrying the Phillies from 1980 to 1982, the New York Mets from 1983 to 1998, the New York Yankees from 1999 to 2001, and the San Francisco Giants in 2002.

===National broadcasts===
McCarver began working as a backup &quot;Game of the Week&quot; commentator for NBC in 1980. His work at NBC was followed by stints with ABC (where he teamed with Don Drysdale on backup &quot;Monday Night Baseball&quot; games in 1984 and Al Michaels and Jim Palmer from 1985 to 1989 and again from 1994 to 1995 under the &quot;Baseball Network&quot; umbrella) and CBS (where he teamed with Jack Buck from 1990 to 1991 and Sean McDonough from 1992 to 1993). McCarver called his first World Series in for ABC as a last-minute replacement for Howard Cosell. While at ABC, McCarver also served as a correspondent and play-by-play announcer for freestyle skiing at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, and he later co-hosted the primetime coverage of 1992 Winter Olympics with Paula Zahn for CBS.

In 1996, McCarver was paired with Joe Buck on the Fox network&#x27;s MLB telecasts, a role he held from 1996 to 2013. In 2003, McCarver set a record by broadcasting his 13th World Series on national television (surpassing Curt Gowdy). He called 24 World Series for ABC, CBS, and Fox. McCarver announced in March 2013 that he would leave Fox after the 2013 season. His final Fox broadcast was October 30, 2013, as the Boston Red Sox defeated the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 6 to win the 2013 World Series.

===Return to local broadcasting===
In December 2013, he was hired to be a part-time analyst for the Cardinals on Fox Sports Midwest. He teamed with Dan McLaughlin to call 30 games in the 2014 season. His first game called for the Cardinals was on April 28, 2014, when they hosted the Milwaukee Brewers. McCarver returned to the Cardinals booth for 40 games in 2015 and continued to call a select number of games each year through 2019. McCarver did not work on any telecasts during the team&#x27;s shortened 2020 season, due to health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2022, McCarver officially announced his retirement from broadcasting.

McCarver also hosted a nationally syndicated sports interview program, &quot;The Tim McCarver Show&quot;, from 2000 until 2017.

===Criticism===
During the 1992 National League Championship Series, McCarver criticized Deion Sanders, who also had become an NFL star, for playing two sports‚Äîfootball and baseball‚Äîon the same day. For his criticism, on October 14, 1992, after Game 7 had concluded, Sanders dumped a bucket of ice water on McCarver three times while covering the National League pennant-winning Atlanta Braves&#x27; clubhouse celebration for CBS. After being doused with the water, McCarver shouted at Sanders, &quot;You are a real man, Deion. I&#x27;ll say that.&quot; Also during the 1992 post-season (when McCarver worked for CBS), Norman Chad criticized McCarver in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; by saying that he&#x27;s someone who &quot;when you ask him the time, will tell you how a watch works,&quot; a reference to McCarver&#x27;s habit of over-analyzing.

In October 2008, just before the 2008 NLCS, McCarver made public his feelings about Manny Ramirez, calling him &quot;despicable&quot; and criticizing him for his sloppy, lazy play in Boston and how he had suddenly turned it around in Los Angeles. Ramirez declined to comment.

In 2010, McCarver compared the New York Yankees&#x27; treatment of former manager Joe Torre to the treatment meted out by Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia to generals who fell out of favor with their leaders. After receiving negative comments about his position on the topic, McCarver apologized.

==Music career==
On October 9, 2009, McCarver released a cover album of jazz standards entitled &quot;Tim McCarver Sings Songs from the Great American Songbook&quot;.

==Personal life==
McCarver married his high school sweetheart, Anne, on December 29, 1964. They had two daughters.

McCarver died of heart failure in Memphis, on February 16, 2023, at age 81.

<text>√âtienne Bacrot (; born 22 January 1983) is a French chess grandmaster, and as a child, a chess prodigy.

He competed at the Candidates Matches in 2007 and won the Aeroflot Open in 2009. He passed 2700 FIDE rating in 2004 and in January 2005 he became the first French player to enter the top 10.

Bacrot won an individual bronze medal at the 37th Chess Olympiad in 2006 for his performance on board one, as well as four medals at the World Team Championships.

== Chess career ==

He started playing at age 4. By 10, Bacrot was winning junior competitions, and in 1996, at 13 years of age, he won against Vasily Smyslov. He became a Grandmaster in March 1997 at the age of 14 years and 2 months, making him the youngest person at the time to have held the title until Ruslan Ponomariov took the record that December. He was coached previously by Josif Dorfman.

Bacrot served as one of the four advisors to the world team in the 1999 Kasparov versus the World event.

He has a son, Alexandre, and a daughter, Victoria, with Nathalie Bonnafous.

In 2023 Bacrot took part in the Chess World Cup in Baku as the 52nd seed, making it to the fourth round after defeating Nay Lin Tun, Aleksandar Indjic and the 13th seed Yu Yangyi from China, before losing to Indian GM Vidit Gujrathi.
He, then, participated in the FIDE Grand Swiss 2023, where he scored 6,5/11 and was in contention for a top 2 finish until round 8 when he lost against Fabiano Caruana after blundering in time pressure. In this strong tournament he beat Belgian GM Daniel Dardha, German GM Niclas Huschenbeth and 2720-rated GM Yu Yangyi, with a TPR of 2749.
After the Grand Swiss, Bacrot played on board 1 for France in the European Team Chess Championship scoring 4/8 as France finished in seventh place.

<text>Montalvo is a neighborhood in Ventura, California, United States. Founded about 1887 as an unincorporated town of Ventura County, it was incorporated into the city in 2012. Montalvo is located in the southern portion of the city on the northern bank of the Santa Clara River. It is bounded by Victoria Avenue to the west, Ralston Street to the north, Johnson Drive to the east, and the Ventura Freeway to the south.

==History==
J. G. Hill, credited with being the founder of Montalvo, laid out plans for the town site in 1886. Some accounts indicate that the community was named after Garci Rodr√≠guez de Montalvo, the Spanish author who first described the Island of California in the 1510 novel &quot;Las Sergas de Esplandi√°n&quot;. In 1887, the Southern Pacific Railroad built the railroad line from Los Angeles through the Santa Clara River Valley northerly through the area.

In its early days, Montalvo was served by the Washington Street railroad depot. For awhile, the depot was the terminus of the Southern Pacific Railroad in Ventura County. Goods destined for Ventura and Port Hueneme were unloaded at Montalvo and taken by cart to those locations. The community also became a center for growing and processing apricots. A school was built on Grand Avenue in 1889. In the 19th century, the community had a newspaper called the &quot;Montalvo Courier&quot; or the &quot;Evening Monitor&quot;. It was a thriving community in the late 19th century. In the late 1880s, the University of Southern California planned to establish a satellite campus, to be known as the &quot;Collegiate Institute&quot;, on a grassy knoll in Montalvo. According to one account: &quot;There was a splendid hotel beside the large depot. The town boasted a daily newspaper, a Chinese laundry, a general store and post office that was the center of life along the river.&quot; Montalvo promoters touted the community as &quot;the Pasadena of Ventura County.&quot;

In the early 1900s, after railroad service was extended to Oxnard, most of the homes in Montalvo were physically relocated across the Santa Clara River to Oxnard. Oxnard became a boom town, and home mover John Brakey developed a thriving business loading homes on rollers and moving them across the dry river bed from Montalvo to Oxnard. During this time, Montalvo also lost its newspaper and printing press. By the 1920s, most of Montalvo&#x27;s population had relocated elsewhere.

After World War II, several residential neighborhoods were built in Montalvo. In 1952, the community formed the Montalvo Sanitary District (later renamed the Montalvo Municipal Improvement District) and built a sewage treatment plant to facilitate further development. Development was halted in 1958 when the Ventura County Health Department found the sewage treatment plant to be inadequate. After improvement to the sewage facilities, development resumed.

In 1961, Ventura County master plan consultants proposed developing Montalvo as &quot;the core of an urban region&quot; covering Ventura, Oxnard, Port Hueneme, and Saticoy, which was predicted to reach a population of 700,000 by 1980 and 2,000,000 by the year 2020. The consultants proposed making Montalvo the hub of Ventura County government, culture, and transportation, including development of a civic center and a state college.

In 1967, the Ventura Freeway was constructed through Montalvo, resulting in significant financial losses to local merchants.

==Annexation and crime problems==
In the 1970s and 1980s, the city of Ventura expanded eastward and residents debated proposals to accept annexation of Montalvo into the city of Ventura.

Annexation of areas around Montalvo stimulated new construction including 35 apartment buildings on three Montalvo streets south of the Bristol Shopping Center. By 1990, unincorporated Montalvo had a population of 4,630 and a median household income of $46,602. In the 1990s, the area began to experience increased blight and crime, including fights, drug dealing and tagging, as two gangs claimed the apartment area as their territory. In 1994, the Ventura Police Department opened a storefront substation in the Montalvo area to attempt to fight the increased crime.

An initial effort at annexation was defeated in 1992. The Ventura‚ÄìEast station, a Metrolink passenger train station opened for regular service in November 2002. Montalvo was annexed into the city of Ventura in September 2012. The city added a community sign and sidewalks in 2023.

==Landmarks==
Notable landmarks in Montalvo included Sam Korb&#x27;s Trading Post, Loop&#x27;s Restaurant, Little Heidelberg Restaurant, and The White Spot.

Montalvo also was home to a natural dirt mound in the northern part of the community that was rumored to be the work of native Americans. It was described in the 1890s as having an altitude of 150 feet with smoothly sloping sides and approximately one-quarter mile in length. Later press reports indicate that large portions of the mound were removed to be used as fill dirt.

<doc id="833625" wikidata="Q1887053" url="?curid=833625" title="Malcolm Shepherd, 2nd Baron Shepherd">
<text>Malcolm Newton Shepherd, 2nd Baron Shepherd, Baron Shepherd of Spalding (27 September 1918 ‚Äì 5 April 2001), was a British Labour politician and peer who served as Leader of the House of Lords under Harold Wilson and James Callaghan and member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom.

Shepherd was the son of the Labour politician George Shepherd, 1st Baron Shepherd. With the House of Lords Act 1999, the right of the hereditary peers of an automatic seat in the House of Lords was removed, so Shepherd was created a life peer as Baron Shepherd of Spalding, of Spalding in the County of Lincolnshire to keep his seat.

== Early life ==

Born in Blackburn, Lancashire, Malcolm Shepherd was educated at the Lower School of John Lyon and the Friends&#x27; School, an independent school in the market town of Saffron Walden in Essex. He was commissioned in the Royal Army Service Corps in 1941 and served in North Africa, Sicily and Italy rising to the rank of Captain and transferring to what was known as &#x27;Special Services&#x27;. Initially his mother and father were against him joining the Army because of their pacifist convictions.

After the end of the Second World War, Shepherd, together with his wife Allison, went to Singapore as an employee of a British trading company. Later Shepherd purchased majority shares in the firm of Fielding, Brown and Finch working in Malaya and Singapore. When his father died in 1954, he took six months leave, came to the UK to settle his father&#x27;s affairs and made his maiden speech in the House of Lords before returning to the Far East and resuming his business career. In 1958, his company headquarters moved to London and Shepherd moved himself and his family to the UK.

== Political career ==

Shepherd succeeded to the title of Baron Shepherd of Spalding on the death of his father in December 1954, and took his seat in the House of Lords on 8 March 1955. In 1960 he became Deputy Opposition Chief Whip in the Lords, and became Opposition Chief Whip in 1964.

When Shepherd first joined the House of Lords its membership was entirely composed of hereditary peers with a large inbuilt Conservative Party majority. There were only about 25 to 30 Labour Party peers. Shepherd was a pragmatist who realised that if he was to enable the Bills sent from the House of Commons to pass through the House of Lords he had to do deals with the Conservatives and maintain good relations with all in the House.

Although a moderate in his political views he was an early advocate of House of Lords reform. He thought there was too much unnecessary ceremony and in 1971 argued that those entitled to vote in the Upper House be restricted to regular attenders.

After the Labour victory in the 1964 general election, he became Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms and Government Chief Whip, House of Lords, a post he held until 1967 when he became Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. He also served as Deputy Leader of the House of Lords from 1968 to 1970.

Shepherd was appointed to the Privy Council in the 1965 Birthday Honours.

As Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, a role that had previously been known as Secretary of State for the Colonies. During his tenure at The Foreign Office, Britain was busy shedding Empire and he was very involved in the new constitutions of colonies becoming independent, including Fiji. Shepherd was also involved in resolving the Caribbean island of Anguilla&#x27;s demand for independence from St. Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla. He also had to deal with the Biafra war in Nigeria. He won particular popularity in Gibraltar by supervising the introduction of a new constitution which bound Gibraltar more closely to the UK after the Spanish government of General Franco closed the border. Shepherd&#x27;s preamble to the Gibraltar constitution stated that &#x27;Her Majesty&#x27;s Government will never enter into arrangements under which the people of Gibraltar will pass under the sovereignty of another state against their wishes.&#x27; Within the Colony&#x27;s population he is commonly known as &quot;The Father of the Constitution&quot;. He was also responsible for Hong Kong during the riots of 1967 inspired by the cultural revolution; he maintained a relationship with the territory in the following years.

From 1970 to 1974, Shepherd was Opposition Deputy Leader, House of Lords. In 1974 he became Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lords, a post he held until he resigned in 1976.

In 1975, Shepherd and his wife Allison accompanied The Queen and Prince Philip on the first state visit to Japan.

In November 1975, Harold Wilson caused controversy within the Labour Party by sending him to represent the UK Government at the funeral of General Franco.

Shepherd remained an active member of the House of Lords for the rest of his life, and on 16 November 1999 he was created a life peer as Baron Shepherd of Spalding, of Spalding in the County of Lincolnshire in order to keep his seat after the House of Lords Act removed the right of hereditary peers to an automatic seat in the House.

== Business career ==

After the surprise defeat of Harold Wilson&#x27;s Labour government in the 1970 general election, Shepherd worked for Rudy Sternberg&#x27;s Sterling Group.

He returned to an active career in business after resigning from the Cabinet in 1976 and also held a number of public offices.

Shepherd was the first Chairman of the Civil Service Pay Research Unit board from 1978 to 1981. He served on the Packaging Council from 1978 to 1980. He was chairman of the Medical Research Council from 1978 to 1982.

From 1976 to 1986 he was Deputy Chairman of Rudi Sternberg&#x27;s, later to become Lord Plurenden, Sterling Group of Companies. In 1979 he became chairman of the National Bus Company which was then one of the largest nationalised industries. Shepherd oversaw a large rise in its profits which reached ¬£48m by 1984. He tried to persuade the Conservative government not to privatise the company, warned of the disappearance of loss-making rural services and frequently clashed with the Transport Secretary Nicholas Ridley.

He was President of the Centre Europ√©en de l&#x27;Enterprise Publique from 1985 and of the Institute of Road Transport Engineers.

==Family==

In 1941, Shepherd married Allison Wilson Redmond (died 1998), the sister of broadcaster James Redmond. Their two sons, Graeme and Douglas, were born in Singapore before he succeeded to the title.

He was on holiday in Lanzarote (with his Whip&#x27;s permission), where he died suddenly on 5 April 2001. His elder son Graeme inherited the hereditary title. He is buried together with his wife, Allison, in the yard of Muiravonside church in Falkirk, Scotland.

<text>Cassadaga (a Seneca Indian word meaning &quot;Water beneath the rocks&quot;) is a small unincorporated community located in Volusia County, Florida, United States, just north of Deltona. It is especially known for having many psychics and mediums, and has consequently been named the &quot;Psychic Capital of the World&quot;.

== History of Cassadaga == 
The Cassadaga Spiritualist Camp began circa 1875, when the Southern Cassadaga Spiritualist Camp Meeting Association was founded by George P. Colby, from Pike, New York, a trance medium who traveled to many different states, giving readings and seances. He was well known and in his travels was referred to as the &quot;seer of spiritualism.&quot; Colby attended summer Spiritualist Camp meetings at Lily Dale, New York, the town adjacent to Cassadaga, New York that would lend its name to the Florida community.

Colby worked with several spirit guides who would give him knowledge. One of his spirit guides was a Native American named Seneca, who had manifested to Colby during a seance in Lake Mills, Iowa. According to Colby, Seneca had instructed him to travel south to Florida, where he eventually arrived at a place called the Blue Springs Landing, near Orange City, Florida. According to Colby, the area that Seneca had led him to was the same area that Colby had seen during the seance in Iowa.

Colby had arrived in Florida in 1875, and on December 18, 1894, the charter was granted to form The Southern Cassadaga Spiritualist Camp Meeting Association. Later, on January 3, 1895, Colby had signed a warranty deed to the association for thirty-five acres. The people who came to the Spiritualist Camp in the early days of its formation were affluent and well educated. The association later received additional acreage that expanded the camp to the current fifty-seven acres.

==The Cassadaga Camp today==
Today, the Camp features the Cassadaga Hotel, a central auditorium, The Colby Memorial Temple, a community library, the Caesar Forman Healing Center, a Camp bookstore, a welcome center, and the Andrew Jackson Davis Educational building, used for musical performances and gatherings. Nearby is Colby-Alderman Park.

The principles of spirituality that are taught by the people at Cassadaga state, &quot;Spiritualism has no dogma or creed, just a simple set of nine principles to help guide our lives&quot;. According to the teachings of spiritualism, it is the &quot;science, philosophy, and religion based upon the principle of continuous life&quot;. On March 14, 1991, the Southern Cassadaga Spiritualist Camp was declared a U.S. Historic District. The Cassadaga Spiritualist Camp is a federal tax-exempt church currently governed by a board of trustees.

<doc id="833632" wikidata="Q2984706" url="?curid=833632" title="Combat Readiness Medal">
<text>The Combat Readiness Medal is an award of the United States Air Force and United States Space Force created in 1964. The original Combat Readiness Medal was an award senior to the Air Force Commendation Medal, and it was awarded for superior and meritorious duty to the United States Air Force. The award criteria for the medal were revised in 1967 and the Combat Readiness Medal adopted the designation as a service medal.

The Combat Readiness Medal is awarded to any member of U.S. Air Force or U.S. Space Force, who have accomplished sustained individual combat mission readiness in an Air Force or Space Force weapon system or who have undertaken the preparedness for direct weapon-system employment. A service member must have completed 24 cumulative months of sustained duty performance for the medal to be received.

The Combat Readiness Medal is given as a service award by an Air Force Major Command or Space Force Field Command. In many cases, those receiving the award have also qualified for the Air Medal, the Aerial Achievement Medal or the Nuclear Deterrence Operations Service Medal. For aeronautically rated Air Force officers and enlisted aircrew personnel, it is not unusual to receive one or both of the flight crew medals simultaneously with the Combat Readiness Medal.

The medal was designed by the Institute of Heraldry. On the obverse, it has an inverted triangle on top of a delta-swept winglike object, both representing supersonic aircraft. This design is enclosed by a stylized compass rose, with triangles at the points, indicating the worldwide nature of the mission of the Air Force. The reverse of the medal has the inscription, &quot;For Combat Readiness--Air Force&quot; in a circle, near the outer edge of the medal. The ribbon has a wide center stripe of red, flanked on either side by a narrow stripe of light blue, thin stripe of dark blue, narrow stripe of light blue with a stripe of red at the edge.

Multiple presentations of the Combat Readiness Medal are authorized, with additional awards denoted by oak leaf clusters. The Combat crew badge, a qualification accoutrement worn by crew members collecting time towards the medal, is no longer awarded.

If an Air Force or Space Force member has the Combat Readiness Medal and does the Blue to Green program (Air Force/Space Force to Army transition) they are still authorized to wear the medal, but unlike in the Air Force and Space Force, it will be worn as the last medal/ribbon, but before any foreign awards.

<doc id="833639" wikidata="Q4798016" url="?curid=833639" title="San Bernardino Line">
<text>The San Bernardino Line is a Metrolink line running between Downtown Los Angeles east through the San Gabriel Valley and the Inland Empire to San Bernardino, with limited express service to Redlands. It is one of the three initial lines on the original Metrolink system, along with the Santa Clarita Line (now the Antelope Valley Line) and the Ventura County Line.

, 18 round trips run between Los Angeles and San Bernardino on weekdays with one trip continuing on to Redlands. It was the first of the seven Metrolink lines to run on both Saturday and Sunday, with 8 trains to San Bernardino on Saturdays and Sundays. Two Saturday and two Sunday trains would continue to Riverside‚ÄìDowntown station until July 5, 2014, when weekend service on the 91 Line (now the 91/Perris Valley Line) began.

==Route==
The line is owned by Metrolink. After leaving Union Station and crossing the Los Angeles River, the line follows the San Bernardino Freeway and El Monte Busway until just after the Cal State L.A. station; it then runs in the median of the San Bernardino Freeway to the El Monte Station along the former route of the Pacific Electric Railway&#x27;s San Bernardino Line. Starting at El Monte, the line parallels the Union Pacific&#x27;s Sunset Route (ex-Southern Pacific) for a few miles before turning northeast at Bassett onto a Southern Pacific branch. At the former Southern Pacific/Pacific Electric-Santa Fe crossing, it switches to the Santa Fe route; from Claremont to just west of San Bernardino it follows what was the Santa Fe&#x27;s Pasadena Subdivision (and before that the Second District of the LA Division, the Santa Fe passenger main line). From San Bernardino Depot, the line follows the Santa Fe&#x27;s Redlands branch line towards Downtown Redlands. The San Bernardino Line is mostly single track with seven passing sidings and short sections of double track near Covina, between Pomona and Montclair, west of Fontana, and throughout San Bernardino.

==History==
Los Angeles County Transportation Commission acquired the Southern Pacific Railroad Burbank Branch in 1992. When the line opened on October 26, 1992, service extended only as far as Pomona. It was incrementally extended to Claremont that December, Montclair the following February, then finally to San Bernardino in May 1993. Saturday service was added in 1997 and Sunday service in 1998 making it the first Metrolink line to offer weekend service.

San Bernardino Associated Governments (SANBAG) completed an environmental impact report (EIR) in 2015 to extend Metrolink service southeast from the current eastern terminus in San Bernardino to Redlands. The extension follows the Redlands Subdivision and comprises two projects.

The Downtown San Bernardino Passenger Rail Project extended Metrolink southeast one mile via double trackage to a new terminus at the San Bernardino Transit Center. The project&#x27;s groundbreaking was in February 2014; at that time, the extension was expected to be completed by mid-2016. , the completion date had been extended to 2017. Construction work on the extension continued through March and April 2017. Test trains began running on the tracks in April 2017. This phase of the project opened to the public on December 16, 2017.

Arrow is a rail extension to Redlands. By December 2015, SANBAG decided that this second phase of the project, from the San Bernardino Transit Center to Redlands, would no longer be a Metrolink extension, but rather an independent system. SANBAG planned to use diesel multiple units (DMUs) and have Omnitrans operate the system. However, San Bernardino Line express limited-stop trains would run on part of the extension, to a new station near the Downtown Redlands station. Construction was planned to begin in 2017, however groundbreaking took place in July 2019 with a 2022 opening. The selected route runs between the Downtown San Bernardino station and the University of Redlands with stops at Tippecanoe Avenue, Esri, and Downtown Redlands, adjacent to the Redlands Santa Fe Depot. Omnitrans was removed as the system&#x27;s operator in 2019 amid mounting deficits, and Metrolink took over construction and procurement. Arrow opened on October 24, 2022. Arrow&#x27;s DMU sets have been studied for wider deployment on the rest of the San Bernardino Line. The rolling stock is the new EMD F125, and others were MPI MPXpress, EMD F59PH, and some cab cars.

== Future development ==
The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LA Metro) has plans to add the current LA General Medical Center station on the El Monte Busway as an infill station to the line. This would involve building a second track and center platform. The cost of this project is estimated between $51¬†million and $110¬†million. Currently, westbound Metrolink passengers must exit at the Cal State LA station and take any of the westbound buses one stop to the Medical Center.

== Stations ==
The San Bernardino Line has 15 full-time stations. They are, from west to east:

<text>The Boeing EA-18G Growler is an American carrier-based electronic warfare aircraft, a specialized version of the two-seat Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet. The EA-18G replaced the Northrop Grumman EA-6B Prowlers in service with the United States Navy. The Growler&#x27;s electronic warfare capability is primarily provided by Northrop Grumman. The EA-18G began production in 2007 and entered operational service with the US Navy in late 2009. Australia has also purchased thirteen EA-18Gs, which entered service with the Royal Australian Air Force in 2017.

==Development==
===Requirement and testing===
On 15 November 2001, Boeing successfully completed an initial flight demonstration of F/A-18F &quot;F-1&quot; fitted with the ALQ-99 electronic warfare system to serve as the EA-18 Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) concept aircraft. In December 2003, the US Navy awarded a development contract for the EA-18G to Boeing. As primary contractor, Boeing was to construct the forward fuselage and wings, and perform the final assembly. Northrop Grumman was the principal airframe subcontractor and they would supply the center and aft fuselage as well as the principal electronic combat system. In 2003, the Navy expected to receive 90 EA-18Gs.

The first EA-18G test aircraft entered production on 22 October 2004. The first test aircraft, known as EA-1, was rolled out on 3 August 2006, before making its maiden flight at St. Louis on 15 August 2006; it was later ferried to Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland on 22 September 2006. EA-1 primarily supports ground testing in the Air Combat Environment Test and Evaluation Facility (ACETEF) anechoic chamber.

The second aircraft (EA-2) first flew on 10 November 2006, and was delivered to NAS Patuxent River on 29 November 2006. EA-2 is an AEA flight test aircraft, initially flying on Pax River&#x27;s Atlantic Test Range (ATR) for developmental test of the AEA system before transitioning to the Electronic Combat Range (ECR, or &#x27;Echo Range&#x27;) in Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake in California. Both aircraft are assigned to VX-23 &quot;Salty Dogs&quot;. EA-1 and EA-2 are F/A-18Fs F-134 and F-135, pulled from the St. Louis production line and modified by Boeing to the EA-18G configuration. However, since they were not built initially as Growlers, the Navy has designated these two test aircraft as NEA-18Gs. There were five Growlers flying in the flight test program as of June 2008.

===Procurement===
In an April 2006 report, the US Government Accountability Office expressed concerns. The GAO felt the electronic warfare systems on the EA-18G were not fully mature so there is a risk of &quot;future cost growth and schedule delays&quot;. The report recommended that the DoD consider purchasing additional ICAP III upgrades for EA-6Bs to fill any current and near-term capability gaps and restructure the initial EA-18G production plans so that procurement takes place after the aircraft has &quot;demonstrated full functionality&quot;. In a 2008 GAO report, the director of the DoD&#x27;s Operational Test and Evaluation department questioned the workload on the two-person Growler crew to replace the Prowler&#x27;s crew of four.
The U.S. Navy has ordered a total of 57 aircraft to replace its in-service EA-6B Prowlers, most of which are based at NAS Whidbey Island. The US DoD gave approval for the EA-18G program to begin low rate initial production in 2007. The EA-18G was scheduled to finish flight testing in 2008. The Navy planned to buy approximately 85 aircraft in 2008. Approval for full-rate production was expected in the third quarter of 2009, and was given on 23 November 2009. Boeing planned to ramp up production to 20 aircraft per year. On 9 July 2009, General James Cartwright told the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services that the choice had been to continue the F/A-18 production line because the warfighting commanders needed more aerial electronic warfare capability that only the EA-18G could provide.

The Navy&#x27;s submission for the 2011 defense budget put forth by the Obama administration calls for four EA-18G Growler squadrons to be added to the fleet. On 14 May 2010, Boeing and the US Department of Defense reached an agreement for a multi-year contract for an additional 66 F/A-18E/Fs and 58 EA-18Gs over the next four years. This will raise the total to 114 EA-18Gs on order.

The Pentagon&#x27;s Director of Operational Test and Evaluation determined that the EA-18G was &quot;still not operationally suitable&quot; in February 2011. Prime contractor Boeing is working to address issues with software updates. In December 2011, Operational Test and Evaluation concluded that the EA-18G software was &quot;operationally effective and suitable&quot;.

On 19 December 2014, the Navy publicly reported that it wants to modify the production contract with Boeing to slow production of the Growler from three airplanes per month to two. It will also purchase an additional 15 Growlers, funded by a spending bill that will go to President Obama for signature in late December 2014. Boeing would then be able to continue running the St. Louis production line through 2017. Boeing has said it cannot sustain the production line at fewer than two airplanes per month.

==Design==

The Growler&#x27;s flight performance is similar to that of the F/A-18E/F. This attribute enables the Growler to perform escort jamming as well as the traditional standoff jamming mission (radar jamming and deception). Growlers are able to accompany F/A-18s during all phases of an attack mission. In order to give the Growler more stable flight for the electronic warfare mission, Boeing changed the leading edge fairings and wing fold hinge fairings, and added wing fences and aileron &quot;tripper strips&quot;.

The Growler has more than 90% in common with the standard Super Hornet, sharing airframe, Raytheon AN/APG-79 AESA radar and weapon systems such as the AN/AYK-22 stores management system. Most of the dedicated airborne electronic attack equipment is mounted on a plate in the space that used to house the internal 20¬†mm cannon and on the wingtips. Nine weapons stations remain free to provide for additional weapons or jamming pods. The added electronics include AN/ALQ-218 wideband receivers on the wingtips and ALQ-99 high and low-band tactical jamming pods. The ALQ-218 combined with the ALQ-99 form a full spectrum electronic warfare suite that is able to provide detection and jamming against all known surface-to-air threats. However, the current pods may be inadequate against emerging threats.

The EA-18G can be fitted with up to five ALQ-99 jamming pods and will typically add two AIM-120 AMRAAM or AGM-88 HARM missiles. The EA-18G will also use the INCANS Interference Cancellation system that will allow voice communication while jamming enemy communications, a capability not available on the EA-6B. In addition to the radar warning and jamming equipment, the Growler possesses a communications receiver and jamming system that will provide suppression and electronic attack against airborne communication threats.

The poor reliability of the ALQ-99 jammer pod and frequent failures of the Built-In Test (BIT) have caused the crew to fly missions with undetected faults. The ALQ-99 has also interfered with the aircraft&#x27;s AESA radar and has imposed a high workload on the two-man crew, along with reducing the Growler&#x27;s top speed.

Boeing is looking into other potential upgrades; the ALQ-99 radar jamming pod may be replaced in the future, and the company is looking into adding weapons and replacing the satellite communications receiver. The Growler is the initial platform for the Next Generation Jammer (NGJ) which uses active electronically scanned array (AESA) technology to focus jamming power exactly where needed. The NGJ was to be implemented on the F-35. However, in May 2012, the U.S. Navy decided to focus NGJ integration on the EA-18G for an expected in-service date of 2020, and defer work for the F-35. Boeing is also looking at exporting a Growler Lite configuration without the jamming pods for electronic awareness rather than electronic attack.

Three Growlers networked together can generate targeting tracks for hostile radio-frequency sources in real time, but this is difficult to arrange with the current minimum strength US Navy squadrons. Utilizing faster data-links, the Growler could use its EW pods to accurately locate signal sources. In a group of three planes, when one detects a signal from a source such as a cell phone, the other two can also listen for the same signal, all three measuring the amount of time taken for transmissions to travel from the source to each aircraft to trilaterate the location to &quot;a very, very small area.&quot; By early 2015, the Navy had demonstrated this concept using EA-18s equipped with Rockwell Collins&#x27; tactical targeting network technology (TTNT) and ALQ-218 receivers to acquire emissions from a target vessel and target it from a stand-off range without using their own detectable radar emissions. Boeing announced on 1 December 2015 that they would upgrade Navy EA-18Gs with the TTNT datalink.

Following U.S. Navy missions in Operation Odyssey Dawn during the 2011 Libyan Revolution, the Royal Australian Air Force decided to add the Raytheon ATFLIR (forward looking infrared) pod to their order of 12 Growler aircraft. When the Navy&#x27;s EA-18Gs&#x27; radar and radar detectors located possible targets, they passed the information through datalinks to strike fighters. However, the Growlers themselves lacked the ability to visually confirm what it detected, so adding a FLIR pod gives it visual acuity to see targets and shorten the kill chain; it is not known if the U.S. Navy will also add a FLIR pod. Australian EA-18Gs will also be equipped with the AIM-9X Sidewinder missile.

==Operational history==
===United States===
The first Growler for fleet use was officially accepted by VAQ-129 &quot;Vikings&quot; at NAS Whidbey Island, on 3 June 2008. The Navy planned to buy approximately 85 aircraft to equip 11 squadrons as of 2008. The EA-18G completed operational evaluation in late July 2009. The Growler was rated operationally effective and suitable for operational use. On 5 August 2009, EA-18G Growlers from Electronic Attack Squadron 129 (VAQ-129) and Electronic Attack Squadron 132 (VAQ-132) completed their first at-sea carrier-arrested landing aboard the .

The first deployable EA-18G squadron was VAQ-132 &quot;Scorpions&quot;, which reached operational status in October 2009. The first Growler operational deployment was announced on 17 February 2011. In service, the EA-18&#x27;s radio name during flight operations will be &quot;Grizzly&quot;. The &quot;Growler&quot; nickname sounded too much like the EA-6B&#x27;s &quot;Prowler&quot; name, so &quot;Grizzly&quot; will be used to avoid confusion. By May 2011, 48 Growlers had been delivered to the U.S. Navy.

With the termination of the EB-52H standoff jammer, the Growler became the sole remaining crewed tactical jammer. Air Staff requirements director Maj. Gen. David Scott has indicated that the USAF will seek to provide electronic warfare officers to fly on U.S. Navy Growlers, without providing funding to purchase additional aircraft. USAF personnel of 390th Electronic Combat Squadron stationed at NAS Whidbey Island have been supporting and flying the Growler.

The EA-18G was first used in combat during Operation Odyssey Dawn, enforcing the UN no-fly zone over Libya in 2011. Five EA-18Gs were redeployed from Iraq to support operations in Libya in 2011.

The Growler was deployed as part of Operation Prosperity Guardian, where one destroyed a Houthi Mil Mi-24 &quot;Hind&quot; on the ground with an AGM-88E Advanced Antiradiation Guided Missile (AARGM). The EA-18G also scored its first air-to-air kill, downing a Houthi drone.

===Australia===
In 2008, the Australian Government requested export approval from the US government to purchase up to six EA-18Gs, which would be part of the order for 24 F/A-18F Super Hornets.
On 27 February 2009, Defence Minister Joel Fitzgibbon announced that 12 of the 24 Super Hornets on order would be wired on the production line for future fit-out as EA-18Gs. The additional wiring would cost A$35¬†million. On 23 August 2012, the Australian Government announced that 12 RAAF Super Hornets would be fitted with Growler capability at a cost of $1.5 billion, making the Royal Australian Air Force the only military other than the U.S. to operate the Growler&#x27;s electronic jamming equipment.

On 3 May 2013, the Australian Government announced that it will buy 12 new-build Growlers to supplement the existing Super Hornet fleet. Australia took delivery of the first of 12 Growlers on 29 July 2015. Uniquely, Australian Growlers will be equipped with the AN/ASQ-228 ATFLIR targeting pod and will also have additional air-to-air weapons in the form of the AIM-9X missile. The aircraft will be operated by No. 6 Squadron RAAF. On 7 July 2017, the RAAF completed delivery of the 12 EA-18G Growlers with the arrival of the last Growler at RAAF Base Amberley, home of No. 6 Squadron RAAF.

One of the Australian EA-18Gs was written off following an engine fire in January 2018, leaving the force with 11 of the type. On 29 January, an Australian EA-18G caught fire after an aborted takeoff at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada while participating in Exercise Red Flag 2018. The crew were able to exit the jet on the ground unharmed. An investigation found that one engine&#x27;s high-pressure compressor had broken into three major pieces that severely damaged the lower airframe, right tailfin, and the other engine. The aircraft was written off on 15 August and the Australian Government is attempting to claim compensation for the loss of the A$125 million aircraft.

On 9 December 2020, the Royal Australian Air Force had announced that the 11 EA-18G Growlers and 24 F/A-18F Super Hornets had been grounded after an incident occurred where the crew of a RAAF F/A-18F had to eject on takeoff which is under investigation.

On 30 September 2021, the US State Department approved the sale of an EA-18G to Australia to replace that lost in the 2018 accident. This aircraft was ordered in early 2022, with the price being up to $US 125 million. It will be acquired from the US Navy&#x27;s stock of Growlers and be modified to the same configuration as the other Australian aircraft before being delivered to the RAAF. The aircraft was delivered to the RAAF in February 2023.

In February 2023, a A$2 billion project to upgrade the RAAF&#x27;s Growlers and support infrastructure was approved and awarded to Boeing Corp. As part of the project new radar infrastructure will be installed at RAAF Base Amberley and the Delamere Air Weapons Range. The Growlers will also be fitted with improved sensors, longer-ranged missiles and new jamming pods.

===Potential operators===
====Japan====
On 1 January 2018, it was reported that the Japanese Government is considering purchasing an electronic warfare attack aircraft and the EA-18G is a candidate for the Japan Air Self-Defense Force.

===Failed bids===
====Finland====
Boeing and the US Navy indicated their intention to propose the F/A-18E/F and EA-18G as a package for the new fighter introduction program, HX, which would replace the F/A-18C/D fighters operated by the Finnish Air Force, and on 18 February 2019 the US Department of Defense approved the export of the EA-18G to Finland. However, the Finnish Air Force selected the F-35 Lightning II in February 2022.

<doc id="833653" wikidata="Q2393800" url="?curid=833653" title="Smelly Cat">
<text>&quot;Smelly Cat&quot; is a comedy song from the American sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; (1994‚Äì2004), performed by American actress Lisa Kudrow. &quot;Friends&quot; writers Adam Chase and Betsy Borns wrote the song with musician Chrissie Hynde and Kudrow for the latter&#x27;s character Phoebe Buffay, and it first appears in the sixth episode of the show&#x27;s second season, &quot;The One with the Baby on the Bus&quot; (1995). Hynde guest stars in the episode as Stephanie Schiffer, a singer hired to replace Phoebe as Central Perk&#x27;s in-house musician, to whom Phoebe eventually teaches &quot;Smelly Cat&quot;.

Borns had intended to write the song about a dog, basing it on her own pet dog Gouda, but ultimately decided that a song about a pungent cat would be funnier. Chase and other &quot;Friends&quot; writers, including series creator David Crane, developed the song out of lyrics that had originated as dialogue. Following its debut, Kudrow would continue to perform &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; frequently throughout &quot;Friends&quot;&#x27; ten-year run, most prominently during the show&#x27;s second season, with the song evolving into a running gag and integral component of Phoebe&#x27;s role. The song&#x27;s popularity grew among fans to the point where they asked for it to be officially released as an album track. Kudrow and Hynde&#x27;s band the Pretenders, credited as Phoebe Buffay and the Hairballs, recorded an updated version entitled &quot;Smelly Cat Medley&quot; for the soundtrack album &quot;Friends Again&quot; (1999). Musically, &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; is an acoustic pop and folk novelty song about an odorous cat who is mistreated and neglected by its owners due to its stench.

Established as a fan favorite, &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; has become closely associated with Phoebe, Kudrow, and the series, and is often ranked highly by media publications among &quot;Friends&quot;&#x27; most memorable moments and featured songs, even rivaling the show&#x27;s theme song &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There for You&quot; by the Rembrandts in terms of popularity. &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; has been covered by several artists, including &quot;Friends&quot; guest stars E. G. Daily, Chris Isaak, and James Michael Tyler, co-star Courteney Cox, and singer Colbie Caillat. Kudrow also performed &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; with Taylor Swift live during the singer&#x27;s 1989 World Tour in 2015, with footage of the duet garnering widespread media attention and becoming a viral sensation. During &quot;Friends&quot;‚Ä≥ , Kudrow performed a special rendition of the song with Lady Gaga.

== Background and writing ==
On the American sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; (1994‚Äì2004), actress Lisa Kudrow plays Phoebe Buffay, an eccentric masseuse and amateur singer-songwriter with little musical talent. The character often performs some of her original, unusual songs at Central Perk, a New York coffeehouse where she and her five friends socialize with each other. &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; was written for the character by Kudrow with Adam Chase, Betsy Borns, and Chrissie Hynde. The song was conceived in 1995 by Borns, a &quot;Friends&quot; writer who had intended for it to be about a dog. Tending to incorporate her personal life into &quot;Friends&quot; storylines, Borns initially based the song on a malodorous dog she had owned as a child named Gouda (after the cheese), at first describing the concept &quot;as an ode to her childhood pet&quot;. She ultimately decided a song about a foul-smelling cat would be funnier.&quot;Smelly Cat&quot; first appears in the sixth episode of the second season, &quot;The One with the Baby on the Bus&quot; (1995), which Borns also wrote. Chase, another writer for &quot;Friends&quot;, also contributed lyrics, which originated as dialogue for the episode. He suggested that Phoebe sing a song called &quot;Smelly Cat&quot;, a title he had pitched because the show &quot;just needed a funny song title&quot;. Once the writers decided when the character would sing in the episode, they collaborated on evolving the dialogue into lyrics. According to Chase, much of &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; was improvised during late-night sessions in the &quot;Friends&quot; writer&#x27;s room, with &quot;two or three people around the table adding lines on the spot&quot;. Series creator David Crane and writer Jeff Astrof also took turns suggesting different lines that and phrases that were ultimately included in the final song, such as Astrof&#x27;s &quot;What are they feeding you?&quot;. Kudrow composed the melody herself, as she had done for all of her character&#x27;s original songs. She recalled, &quot;The words to the song were penned down by some very intelligent scriptwriters. But it was me who came up with the tune underneath the words&quot;.

During the episode&#x27;s live taping, Chase suggested to Crane that the song would be funnier if Kudrow emphasized the word &quot;smelly&quot; instead of the expected word &quot;cat&quot;. Typically, writers do not offer notes once filming began, unless a scene did not work completely. With some hesitation, Crane suggested the note to Kudrow, and the revision ultimately resulted in a louder laugh from the studio audience. Hynde, lead singer of rock band The Pretenders, guest stars in the episode as Stephanie Schiffer, a professional singer hired to replace Phoebe as Central Perk&#x27;s resident musician. Phoebe initially protests being fired from her gig, but eventually teaches her &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; by the end of the episode. Hynde co-wrote the song&#x27;s music with Kudrow, who described writing with Hynde as &quot;amazing&quot;. The musician had agreed to guest star on &quot;Friends&quot; with little knowledge about how popular the relatively new sitcom had already become in the United States, having not heard about the show prior to being cast. In the episode, Hynde performs a somber version of &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; on acoustic guitar to a full Central Perk audience. Hynde also performs The Pretenders&#x27; cover of &quot;Angel of the Morning&quot; in the same episode.

&quot;Smelly Cat&quot; grew increasingly popular among fans of the show, who sent letters to producers asking that they release the song on an album. Upon realizing the song&#x27;s popularity, Reprise Records&#x27; Howie Klein expressed interest in developing a concept album based around &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; as a follow-up to the previous years&#x27; &quot;Friends&quot; album, but Kudrow&#x27;s participation in the project was undecided. An updated version of the song entitled &quot;Smelly Cat Medley&quot; was eventually released on the soundtrack album &quot;Friends Again&quot; (1999), credited to Phoebe Buffay and the Hairballs. The track is a combination of &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; excerpts from various episodes, featuring vocals from Kudrow and The Pretenders. Although the album&#x27;s cover features all six of the show&#x27;s main cast members ‚Äì Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer ‚Äì Kudrow was the only main cast member to contribute a song.

== Use in &quot;Friends&quot; ==
&quot;Smelly Cat&quot; is one of several songs Phoebe writes and performs on &quot;Friends&quot;. Debuting in &quot;The One with the Baby on the Bus&quot;, which aired on November 2, 1995, Phoebe first mentions the song to Rachel Green (Aniston) in conversation. The song is initially established as Phoebe&#x27;s least popular among audiences. In the episode, Stephanie struggles to play &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; to Phoebe&#x27;s liking, with Phoebe advising the character to work on feeling the song&#x27;s lyrics. &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; proved popular and would continue to make several appearances throughout &quot;Friends&quot;&#x27; ten seasons, primarily via various performances and renditions by Phoebe. Although intended to be a one-time joke, the writers continued to conceive ways of incorporating the song into the series, creating various storylines that revolve around &quot;Smelly Cat&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There for You: The One About Friends&quot; author Kelsey Miller confirmed that the composition was used most frequently during the show&#x27;s second season, with Phoebe singing it at Central Perk regularly. The song would become one of the show&#x27;s most used running gags.The song appears in season two&#x27;s &quot;The One Where Eddie Moves In&quot;, in which Phoebe attempts to record a professional rendition of the song in a recording studio. She struggles to record with background singers. Phoebe eventually films a music video for the song, for which her voice is ultimately dubbed by a professional singer, voiced by E. G. Daily. Phoebe initially believes she is hearing herself sing and thinks she sounds good. Upon learning the truth, Phoebe ultimately feels sorry for the anonymous singer instead of pitying herself. The song is then heard in season three&#x27;s &quot;The One with Phoebe&#x27;s Ex-Partner&quot;, in which Leslie (again portrayed by Daily), a singer with whom Phoebe used to perform, suggests that &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; be adapted into a jingle for a cat litter commercial. Phoebe ultimately refuses the offer, but Leslie sells the song without Phoebe&#x27;s permission, prompting her to write &quot;Jingle Bitch&quot; about Leslie. The product is named &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; Kitty Litter, after the song. In &quot;The One After the Superbowl&quot;, Phoebe performs the song as a duet with Rob, portrayed by musician Chris Isaak, although Phoebe criticizes his rendition, suggesting that the singer refrain from incorporating his signature high-pitched yodeling in favor of &quot;a more masculine note&quot;. In reality, Isaak recalled that Kudrow was very friendly, offering to run lines and rehearse &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; with him. Phoebe also leads her friends in a sing-along version of &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; at Central Perk, each of whom contribute a solo, except Ross Geller (Schwimmer) because there are no more lines.

In season five&#x27;s &quot;The One with Joey&#x27;s Bag&quot;, Phoebe&#x27;s estranged father Frank Buffay (Bob Balaban) reveals that he used to sing her a lullaby called &quot;Sleepy Girl&quot;, which shares &quot;Smelly Cat&quot;&#x27;s melody, as a baby, further establishing &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; as a fundamental aspect of Phoebe&#x27;s life story. However, Sam Ashurst of &quot;Digital Spy&quot; identified this as a plot hole, since Phoebe had previously confirmed that her father abandons her before she was born, therefore he could not have been present to sing to her. Ashurst theorized that Phoebe could have been so determined to retain the copyright to her most famous song that she lied about its composer. According to Rachel Steinberg of &quot;Radio Times&quot;, &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; is heard nine times throughout the course of the series in various capacities. VH1 writer Stacy Lambe believes &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; once signified &quot;a point in Phoebe&#x27;s career when it seemed like her music was going to take off.&quot; &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; described the song as &quot;Phoebe&#x27;s acoustic anthem [which] echoed throughout the whole series.&quot; Following filming of the &quot;Friends&quot; series finale &quot;The Last One&quot; in January 2004, a wrap party was hosted for the cast and crew at Los Angeles&#x27; Park Plaza Hotel, at which a cocktail named after the song was served. A full version of the music video has been included on DVD releases of &quot;Friends&quot;.

== Composition ==

Kudrow&#x27;s original rendition of &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; has been described as a &quot;folky, acoustic&quot; track. The &quot;Toronto Star&quot; called it a &quot;unique guitar ballad&quot;. According to HelloGiggles&#x27; Rachel Paige, the music video version is treated to a &quot;90s remix&quot; with heavy production. Amazon identified the updated &quot;Smelly Cat Medley&quot; as a pop song lasting two minutes and twenty-seven seconds (2:27) in duration. &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; alternates between three chords ‚Äì E, A and D ‚Äì although Phoebe never refers to chords by their traditional names. The song consists of a simple melody and humorous lyrics, with Comedy Central describing Kudrow&#x27;s vocals as &quot;strained&quot;.

A novelty song, MTV&#x27;s Lindsay Soll wrote that &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; is about a &quot;feline with a pungent odor&quot;, but Phoebe reassures the cat that its scent is not its own fault. Rachel Simon, writing for &quot;Bustle&quot;, summarized the track as a song about &quot;a poor-smelling cat treated badly by society for its odor&quot;. The song&#x27;s lyrics begin &quot;Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?&quot;, followed by &quot;Smelly cat, smelly cat it&#x27;s not your fault.&quot; &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; continues, &quot;It may not be a bed of roses/ but you&#x27;re no friend to those with noses&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; critic Beth Cherry believes that the song &quot;educate[s] the world about the plight of olfactorily-challenged felines everywhere.&quot; Ciara Knight of &quot;Joe&quot; considers the song&#x27;s opening lyrics to be its most iconic.

Simon believes &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; explores an inspiring message beyond the odor of a cat about remaining unbothered while being bullied and shunned. Classic FM&#x27;s Sofia Rizzi agreed that the song &quot;has a deep and meaningful message at its core&quot;. Referring to the line &quot;what are they feeding you?&quot;, &quot;Bustle&quot;&#x27;s Mallory Schlossberg suggested that fans &quot;may never know the answer to that deeply philosophical musical question&quot;. The song never reveals how or why the cat smells bad, or what its owners are feeding it. Kudrow confirmed that she never learned what the cat was being fed, although the general consensus is that the cat&#x27;s diet contributed to its smell. The cat&#x27;s gender is also never confirmed.

== Reception and popularity ==
Reviews for &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; have been generally positive. &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; writer Jo Sayer reviewed &quot;The One with the Baby on the Bus&quot; as &quot;an awesome episode because it&#x27;s ... where Smelly Cat is first introduced.&quot; &quot;Newsweek&quot; called the song &quot;legendary&quot;. A Medium contributor wrote that the song &quot;has become an undetachable part of Phoebe&#x27;s persona and her anthem&quot;. The &quot;Toronto Star&quot;&#x27;s Melody L. Goh hailed &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; as &quot;the best song to ever be played on &quot;Friends&quot;&quot;, while RT√â declared it one of the series&#x27; greatest moments. Greg Gilman of &quot;TheWrap&quot; described &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; as &quot;delightfully silly&quot;. Laura McClellan of &quot;Taste of Country&quot; deemed &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; &quot;one of Phoebe&#x27;s greatest quirky coffee house hits&quot;. Ilyse Liffreing of &quot;Ad Age&quot; reviewed one of Phoebe&#x27;s &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; performances as &quot;One of the most memorable scenes&quot; from the series, which the author believes in turn &quot;solidified Phoebe as their show favorite.&quot; The &quot;Honolulu Star-Advertiser&quot;&#x27;s Betty Shimabukuro described &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; as &quot;legendary for its tunelessness and total fusion with the Phoebe personality&quot;, and suggested that fans seek solace by singing the song following the show&#x27;s finale. Conversely, &quot;Wired&quot; writer Travis Reilly described the track as &quot;notoriously awful&quot;, while &quot;The Washington Post&quot; journalist Jennifer Frey dismissed the song&#x27;s several renditions as &quot;painful&quot;.

&quot;Digital Spy&quot; ranked &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; among &quot;12 amazing Phoebe moments&quot;. Sammy Nickalls, writing for HelloGiggles, believes &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; &quot;will go down in history for the best song about an odorous pet&quot;. Madison Malone Kircher of &quot;Business Insider&quot; wrote that &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; predated the Internet as a viral meme by &quot;becoming an oft-quoted and mimicked cultural touchstone for fans of the show.&quot; Victoria Dawson Hoff of &quot;Elle&quot; observed that the song threatens to &quot;unseat &#x27;I&#x27;ll Be There For You&#x27; as the song that&#x27;s most synonymous with &quot;Friends&quot;&quot;, explaining that fans still struggle to &quot;get it out of our heads&quot; nearly 20 years after it was released. &quot;Bustle&quot;&#x27;s Rachel Simon agreed that &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; rivals &quot;the theme song as one of the show&#x27;s most unforgettable musical moments&quot;. CinemaBlend contributor Jessica Rawden attributes the song&#x27;s popularity to several storylines that established &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; as an important aspect of Phoebe&#x27;s life, ultimately becoming &quot;ingrained into the cultural fiber of &quot;Friends&quot;&quot;. &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;&#x27;s Ellen Scott described the song as &quot;glorious&quot; and &quot;iconic&quot;, to which any true fan knows the lyrics. VRT described it as &quot;painful for the ears, but in the collective memory&quot;. Conversely, Lindsey Weber of &quot;Vulture&quot; found &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; is &quot;overrated&quot;, believing it to be inferior to Phoebe&#x27;s angrier songs.

== Live performances and covers ==

Kudrow has generally refrained from performing &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; live under most circumstances, despite being constantly asked by fans. The song began to experience a revival in 2009 when a dance remix began circulating on the Internet. Upon learning about the remix, Kudrow said &quot;I can&#x27;t wait to hear if it is any good&quot;. In September 2009, Kudrow performed &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; live with actress Courteney Cox, who portrayed Monica Geller on &quot;Friends&quot;, during the Rock A Little, Feed A Lot benefit concert. Kudrow was intended to introduce musician Sheryl Crow, only for the audience to ask her to sing &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; instead. Kudrow then invited Cox to join her for the performance, for which the stagehands provided Kudrow with a guitar at Cox&#x27;s insistence. The performance was met with a standing ovation from the crowd. &quot;Hello!&quot; joked that &quot;hitting the right notes wasn&#x27;t really a concern [for the actresses] if they wanted the performance to reflect Lisa&#x27;s character&#x27;s dubious musical talents&quot;, while Inquisitr&#x27;s Asher Bayot reviewed the duet as awkward. The performance remained Kudrow&#x27;s only documented post-&quot;Friends&quot; &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; performance for several years.

In 2014, singer-songwriter Colbie Caillat sang an a capella version of &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; live at a Central Perk-themed pop-up caf√© in Manhattan, New York, which had been launched to commemorate the show&#x27;s 20th anniversary. Caillat&#x27;s unscheduled performanced surprised many fans in attendance, who she encouraged to sing along. Despite praising Caillat&#x27;s rendition as &quot;awesome&quot; for &quot;fulfill[ing] every &quot;Friends&quot; fanatic&#x27;s fantasy&quot;, &quot;Bustle&quot;&#x27;s Aly Semigran criticized her for performing only half of the song. However, she believes her rendition should lead to a Phoebe tribute album, on which she should reprise &quot;Smelly Cat&quot;. At the same pop-up, actor James Michael Tyler, who portrayed Central Perk barista Gunther, performed the first verse of the song with band The Rembrandts, who recorded &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There for You&quot;. Brent Furdyk of &quot;Entertainment Tonight Canada&quot; described the Tyler-Rembrandts rendition as &quot;Jim Morrison-esque&quot;. A box of &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; kitty litter from the episode &quot;The One with Phoebe&#x27;s Ex-Partner&quot; was displayed as part of the pop-up&#x27;s exhibit.

In August 2015, Kudrow performed &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; live with singer Taylor Swift at the Staples Center during the final North American legs of her 1989 World Tour. Her fifth and final performance at the venue, Swift introduced Kudrow as Phoebe Buffay, advising the audience that &quot;She&#x27;s only ever played in coffee houses before. She&#x27;s never played in a big venue like this&quot;. Kudrow then entered the stage wearing a long skirt reminiscent of Phoebe&#x27;s wardrobe. Adopting her character&#x27;s personality, both Kudrow and Swift accompanied themselves on guitar. Kudrow interrupted Swift midway through the duet to offer feedback and remind her to feel the song&#x27;s lyrics, prompting screams and laughter from the audience. Referencing her duet with Hynde, Kudrow ultimately assured Swift that she master the song eventually. The performance was widely reported and positively received by media outlets. Yvonne Villarreal of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; found the rendition superior to &quot;Smelly Cat&#x27;s&quot; &quot;over-produced music video&quot; from &quot;The One Where Eddie Moves In&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;&#x27;s Helena Horton called Kudrow&#x27;s performance &quot;the sweetest&quot; of all the guest appearances throughout Swift&#x27;s tour. &quot;Stylist&quot; agreed that Kudrow&#x27;s appearance &quot;might top&quot; all other guests, calling it superior to singers Selena Gomez and Justin Timberlake&#x27;s cameos at the same concert, while Screener&#x27;s Andrea Reiher concurred that Kudrow was arguably Swift&#x27;s &quot;best guest of the entire &#x27;1989&#x27; run&quot;, concluding that the singer once again &quot;wins at life&quot;. Heather Saul of &quot;The Independent&quot; crowned Kudrow &quot;the highlight of all of [Swift&#x27;s] cameos&quot;, eclipsing Timberlake&#x27;s first stage appearance since becoming a father.

Michel Serra of &quot;Closer&quot; reviewed that Kudrow &quot;has not lost any of Phoebe&#x27;s intonations&quot;, despite being performed 10 years after the actress had last played the role. &quot;Business Insider&quot;&#x27;s Madison Malone Kircher found the song to be &quot;an excellent fit for Swift&quot; due to her love of cats, despite being &quot;a far cry from the tracks on her &#x27;80s-pop-inspired ... album&quot;. Tessa Berenson of &quot;Time&quot; wrote that Swift &quot;may have outdone herself&quot; by duetting with Kudrow, suggesting that Swift&#x27;s next album should be a cover album of Phoebe songs. Rachel Paige of HelloGiggles declared that it would be difficult for Swift to ever top this moment, while &quot;HuffPost&quot; contributor Stephanie Marcus called Swift&#x27;s decision to perform with Kudrow &quot;genius&quot; and &quot;glorious&quot;. A critic for &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; described the rendition as &quot;a whole new ‚Äì and slightly surreal ‚Äì experience to see it performed with pop royalty in front of a huge stadium audience.&quot; Fan recordings of the performance became very popular on the Internet being heavily circulated on social media, with both Swift and &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; trending on Facebook and Twitter, respectively, the following morning. The videos quickly earned millions of views, becoming the most viral guest performance from the tour. &quot;Time&quot; ranked the performance Swift&#x27;s seventh best moment of 2015. However, &quot;Vice&quot;&#x27;s Mitchell Sunderland questioned whether Swift&#x27;s target demographic of fans born in and after 1999 were truly familiar with Kudrow and the song. As of 2016, E. G. Daily sometimes performs the song during her shows.

To commemorate the show&#x27;s 25th anniversary in September 2019, a flash mob of 25 women dressed as Phoebe assembled in New York&#x27;s Union Square and performed &quot;Smelly Cat&quot;. In tribute to the character, each woman donned a suede fringe jacket, blonde wig, and guitar, replicating one of Phoebe&#x27;s outfits from the series. The impersonators also sang the song at each location they stopped, including &quot;The Today Show&quot;, WPIX TV and Grand Central Station. The performers used the occasion to raise awareness for pet rescue and encourage witnesses to adopt a cat, on behalf of the Best Friends Animal Society. During &quot;Friends&quot;‚Ä≥ , Kudrow performed a special rendition of &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; with Lady Gaga.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Smelly Cat&quot; has since been established as a fan and cult favorite. Although Phoebe performs nearly 40 original songs over &quot;Friends&quot;&#x27; ten-year run, &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; is considered her breakout hit and signature song, as well as &quot;her most famous creation&quot;. According to &quot;The Times of India&quot;, Phoebe made the song &quot;real and iconic at the same time&quot; to the point at which &quot;its used worldwide by fans.&quot; In 2014, Kudrow revealed that fans constantly ask her to sing the song, but she refuses. &quot;USA Today&quot; ranked the lyrics of &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; among the actress&#x27; best &quot;Friends&quot; quotes. &quot;More&quot; included &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; among &quot;The 15 Best Moments In &#x27;Friends&#x27; History&quot;, with author Effie Orfanides deeming it &quot;one of the best things to come out of the series&quot;, insisting that all fans know its lyrics. &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; is one of the most enduring songs from the sitcom, having &quot;become ubiquitous in pop culture‚Äôs collective consciousness&quot;, according to Ellen Gutoskey of &quot;Mental Floss&quot;. &quot;Premi√®re&quot; magazine described it as &quot;one of the most iconic songs on American television&quot;. VH1 ranked &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; &quot;Friends&quot;&#x27; best musical moment, ahead of &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There for You&quot;. Author Kat George called the song &quot;as essential to &quot;Friends&quot; as the shows theme song&quot;, even going on to crown it &quot;the show&#x27;s unofficial theme song.&quot; E! also ranked the song first, writing that the character &quot;turned the sincere lyrics into one of her most acclaimed (laughed) &#x27;hits&#x27;.&quot; In a similar article, &quot;Billboard&quot; critic Erin Strecker deemed the track &quot;a classic&quot; among Phoebe&#x27;s songs. According to Shaad D&#x27;Souza of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; is &quot;arguably the most famous in-world TV song of all time&quot;.

NDTV recognized &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; as one of &quot;Friends&quot;&#x27; 20 funniest moments, citing its music video as their favorite rendition. E! considers &quot;Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat&quot; to be among &quot;Friends&quot;&#x27; 25 most quotable moments. Classic FM ranked &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; Phoebe&#x27;s best song, with writer Sofia Rizzi calling it &quot;a post-modern work of art&quot; that remains &quot;an anthem for fans of the show today.&quot; &quot;Metro&quot;&#x27;s Hanna Flint declared the song &quot;arguably one of the most memorable songs in the history of television.&quot; &quot;Marie Claire&quot; believes &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; has grown to be nearly as ubiquitous as &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; and Christmas carols, calling it &quot;everyone&#x27;s favourite &quot;Friends&quot; song&quot; and concluding, &quot;Despite belting out dozens of ditties during the 10 season run of &quot;Friends,&quot; the musical talent of Phoebe Buffay will always be remembered through the lyrical genius that is Smelly Cat.&quot; In 2016, Comedy Central crowned the song &quot;one of the most iconic tunes of the 90s&quot;, calling it a &quot;timeless&quot; track because fans can recall its lyrics 21 years later.

In addition to ranking &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; first on BuzzFeed&#x27;s &quot;Definitive Ranking Of Phoebe Buffay&#x27;s Top 40 Songs&quot;, author Tasmai Uppin called it &quot;the ultimate Phoebe Buffay song&quot; against which all of her songs are compared. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; Phoebe&#x27;s fifth greatest song, with author Hillary Busis calling it &quot;iconic and charming and ready-made for merchandise&quot; but questioned its popularity, considering it less funny than some of her other songs. Busis also praised its music video. The &quot;Irish Independent&quot; included &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; as one of &quot;Friends&quot;&#x27; 10 best moments, about which author Aishling Phelan wrote that Phoebe &quot;created some pretty comical and sometimes disturbing songs, but Smelly Cat emerged as her trademark number.&quot; Phelan went on to describe its lyrics as &quot;deep and eloquent&quot;, but dismissed its music video as &quot;cheesy&quot;. Although VH1 ranked &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; the third &quot;Best (Fake) Song Written For TV&quot;, author Stacy Lambe critiqued the music video version as &quot;overproduced&quot;. Meanwhile, Abi Jackson of &quot;Stylist&quot; included the costume Phoebe wears in the &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; music video among &quot;The 50 most iconic fashion and beauty moments in &quot;Friends&quot;&quot;, calling it &quot;One of Phoebe&#x27;s best sartorial moments&quot; and joking &quot;forget Lady Gaga, this is how music videos should be&quot;.

Ranking &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; among &quot;Friends&quot;&#x27; 10 best running gags, Gillian Furmage of WOW247 wrote that the show simply &quot;wouldn&#x27;t be &quot;Friends&quot; without the anthem that is &#x27;Smelly Cat&#x27;.&quot; Calling it one of television&#x27;s 12 best running gags, &quot;Refinery29&quot;&#x27;s wrote that the song &quot;still brings the laughs years after the show&#x27;s end.&quot; Erin Fitzpatrick of &quot;Digital Spy&quot; ranked &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; the 11th best original song from within a television show. Kat George of &quot;Bustle&quot; ranked the video the third best video the &quot;Friends&quot; characters watched during the series, while ranking the commercial for the single seventh. Although Hyndes used to get annoyed by fans asking her to perform &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; on stage, she has grown used to the popularity of it and now considers the song to be &quot;probably my biggest legacy now&quot;. Portuguese comedy group Gato Fedorento named themselves after &quot;Smelly Cat&quot;, which translates to &quot;Gato Fedorento&quot; in Portuguese. To commemorate the show&#x27;s 25th anniversary in September 2019, Google created several &quot;Friends&quot;-themed easter eggs which appear in the search results when the name of a main character is searched. Searching &quot;Phoebe Buffay&quot; or &quot;Phoebe&quot; returned an image of a guitar which, when clicked, promoted Kudrow&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; to play in the background, while a black cat walks across the screen as a green cloud of gas is excreted from its backside to indicate its stench.

<text>Nicholas Valentino Lampson (born February 14, 1945) is an American politician who is a former Democratic Congressman representing the 22nd Congressional District and the 9th Congressional District of Texas.

==Early life, education, and early political career==
Lampson is a lifelong resident of Southeast Texas and a second-generation Italian-American. His grandparents came to the United States from Italy one hundred years ago and settled in Stafford, where they had farms and were founding members of their church. His parents grew up, met, and married in Fort Bend County. Lampson&#x27;s mother and father eventually moved to Beaumont, where he was born.

Lampson is one of six children born to a welder and a homemaker. His father died when he was 12 years old, and Lampson took his first job at that young age sweeping floors to supplement the family&#x27;s income. Lampson&#x27;s mother received $19 per month from Social Security as long as he stayed in school. This money helped his family stay together in those difficult years. This would later influence his commitment to protecting Social Security.

Though Lampson&#x27;s mother had only a fifth grade education, she encouraged her children in school, and all six graduated from college with at least one degree. His mother earned her GED on her 80th birthday. Lampson earned a Bachelor of Science degree in biology and a master&#x27;s degree in education from Lamar University, where he was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. He taught high school science at Hebert High School in Beaumont. An inner calling to be of service to others, and the experience of interning with Congressman Jack Brooks in 1969, led him to seek public office.

In 1976, Lampson was elected tax assessor-collector for Jefferson County and served nearly twenty years. He instituted an emphasis on customer service, successfully pushed for major upgrades in computer technology, and reduced the cost of collecting taxes by $3 million a year. He resigned from his post in order to run for congress.

==First period in Congress (1997‚Äì2005)==
===Elections===
;1996
In the 1996 election, Lampson decided to run for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives representing Texas&#x27;s 9th congressional district. The incumbent was Republican U.S. Congressman Steve Stockman, who was a freshman in congress. The district had been represented by Democrat Jack Brooks for 42 years, but Brooks had been one of the most prominent Democratic incumbents to lose re-election in the &quot;Republican Revolution&quot; of 1994, which brought the House under the control of Republicans for the first time since the 83rd United States Congress following the 1952 elections. Lampson won the Democratic primary with 69% of the vote. In the general election, he defeated Stockman 53%-47%.

;1998

He won re-election to a second term against Republican Tom Cottar 64%-36%.

;2000
He won re-election to a third term against Republican Paul Williams 59%-40%.

;2002
He won re-election to a fourth term against Republican Paul Williams 59%-40%.

;2004

Lampson was one of the prime targets of a controversial mid-decade redistricting in 2003. His district was renumbered as the 2nd district. Galveston, which along with Beaumont had anchored the district and its previous incarnations for over a century, was moved into the neighboring 14th District. Much of Galveston County and the portion of Houston including NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center (which had been part of the 9th since 1967) were drawn into DeLay&#x27;s 22nd District. They were replaced by several heavily Republican areas north and east of Houston.

In the 2004 election, Lampson opted to run for reelection in the 2nd District. His Republican opponent was Ted Poe, a longtime district court judge in Harris County, home to most of Houston. Poe defeated Lampson, 56%-43%. Though Beaumont and Jefferson County gave Lampson a majority, he was swamped in the Harris County portion of the district, which supported Poe with 70% of the vote. He was one of several Democratic incumbents that were successfully removed from office as a direct result of Tom Delay&#x27;s controversial mid-decade redistricting plan.

==Second period in Congress (2007‚Äì2009)==

===Elections===
;2006
On May 4, 2005, Lampson announced his candidacy in Texas&#x27;s 22nd congressional district, which had been held by DeLay for 20 years. In the 2003 redistricting, DeLay drew much of Lampson&#x27;s former territory into his own 22nd district, including part of Galveston County (but not Galveston city) and the Johnson Space Center. Lampson had briefly considered a so-called &quot;kamikaze&quot; run against DeLay. He moved to Stafford, a city halfway between Houston and Sugar Land, where his grandparents immigrated to from Italy.

Conservative media pundits criticized Lampson&#x27;s decision to run in the 22nd. Fred Barnes of Fox News Channel called him &quot;a carpetbagger&quot; who &quot;moved into&quot; DeLay&#x27;s district. However, Lampson had represented all of the 22nd&#x27;s portion of Galveston County, as well as part of its share of Houston, during his first stint in Congress. Also, as mentioned above, he had family connections in the district.

The 22nd had long been considered a solidly Republican district, with a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+15. A Democratic presidential candidate had not carried the district since the Texan Lyndon B. Johnson defeated Barry Goldwater in the 1964 election. Democrats had not held the congressional seat since after the 1978 election. The 2008 presidential candidate Ron Paul had held the seat as a Republican before DeLay took over in 1985. Historically, among districts in the Houston area, only the 7th District has been considered more Republican.

DeLay, who was then the House Majority Leader, was seen as vulnerable. He had only won re-election by 14 points in 2004 against a relatively unknown Democrat who spent virtually no money‚Äîan unusually close margin for a party leader. Many experts believed that as a result of DeLay&#x27;s attempts to make the other Houston-area districts more Republican, his own district was more competitive than the one he had represented for his first 10 terms in Congress. Most importantly, DeLay had been investigated for corruption and was indicted on conspiracy and money laundering charges. DeLay denied all allegations and a Texas judge dismissed the former charge in late 2006; still, this damaged DeLay&#x27;s credibility in the campaign.

On April 4, 2006, DeLay withdrew his candidacy for the upcoming November midterm elections in the face of questions about his ethics; he cited troubling poll numbers as the reason. Lampson announced on August 17, 2006, that three major police associations had endorsed him: the National Association of Police Organizations, the International Union of Police Associations, and the Texas State Police Coalition.

Texas Governor Rick Perry announced on August 29, 2006, that a special election would take place for the balance of DeLay&#x27;s 11th term, coinciding with the general election on November 7, 2006. This meant that voters voted once in the special election for a candidate to fill DeLay&#x27;s seat during the lame-duck session of the 109th Congress, and voted a second time for a candidate to represent the district in the 109th Congress. Lampson ran only for the full term, facing Republican Houston City Councilwoman Shelley Sekula-Gibbs.

On September 22, 2006, &quot;The Hotline&quot; ranked Texas&#x27; 22nd Congressional District House race as third (up from a previous ranking of fifth) in a list of the top 30 House races in the country. Additionally, other traditionally conservative organizations backed Lampson&#x27;s candidacy. The National Rifle Association and the Veterans of Foreign Wars both supported Lampson in the 2006 election.

Three national political journals‚Äîthe &quot;Cook Political Report,&quot; Larry Sabato&#x27;s &quot;Crystal Ball&quot;, and &quot;Congressional Quarterly&quot;‚Äîrated the race as &quot;Leans Democratic&quot;. On October 30, 2006, a Zogby poll commissioned by the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;-KHOU-TV was released, showing the write-in candidate, Sekula-Gibbs, at 27.9 percent and Lampson at 36 percent, with nearly 25 percent still undecided.

Lampson defeated Sekula-Gibbs in the November 7 election, 52 to 42 percent, with the remaining 6 percent going to Libertarian Bob Smither. He officially returned to Congress on January 4, 2007. But, DeLay was still on the ballot as the official Republican candidate (Democrats successfully sued to prevent Sekula-Gibbs&#x27; from replacing DeLay on the ballot, forcing her to run a write-in campaign). Meanwhile, Sekula-Gibbs ran unopposed in the special election. This caused confusion for many voters, who were told repeatedly &quot;write in Sekula-Gibbs&quot; but then found her name on the ballot. This resulted in a large (but unreleased) number of excluded votes for Tom DeLay in the general election. Numerous ballots were discarded, including all straight-party votes and direct votes for DeLay. This caused a small outcry of resentment from supporters of Sekula-Gibbs, who felt the election was stolen and their votes disfranchised.

The two elections held on the same day resulted in Sekula-Gibbs winning to serve the last two months of DeLay&#x27;s term, while Lampson won the seat for a full term, starting in January 2007.

;2008

Lampson faced reelection in 2008 against Pete Olson, an attorney and a former aide to Senators Phil Gramm and John Cornyn. Despite the perception that the district was more competitive than the one DeLay represented for his first 10 terms, the 22nd was considered a heavily Republican district. It gave Bush 64 percent of the vote in 2004. By most accounts, it was one of the few realistic chances for a Republican challenger to unseat a Democrat in what was forecast to be a bleak year for Republicans.

Olson and Lampson agreed to a debate on the issues on October 20, 2008, in Rosenberg, Texas.

An October 22, 2008, poll by John Zogby and the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; said that Olson had a 17-point lead over Lampson.

On October 30, 2008, Larry Sabato predicted Lampson&#x27;s Congressional race to be a &quot;Republican Pick Up&quot; with Olson defeating Lampson.

On November 4, 2008, Olson defeated Lampson with 52.5% of the vote to Lampson&#x27;s 45.3%. Lampson carried the Galveston County portion of the district, but could not overcome a 15,900-vote deficit in Harris County.

== Tenure ==

=== Missing and exploited children ===
In the spring of 1997, 12-year-old Laura Kate Smither of Friendswood, Texas, was abducted while she was out jogging. Despite efforts by the community and law enforcement her body was found two and a half weeks later.

The devastation felt by the Smither family and the determination of the volunteers inspired Lampson to establish the first-ever United States House Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children. Its purpose is to raise awareness of missing and exploited children matters, develop legislation, and support policies that protect children from abduction, exploitation, and abuse. The caucus has played a significant role in promoting the welfare of children and has worked on various initiatives to strengthen child protection laws, improve law enforcement efforts in cases involving missing and exploited children, and provide support and resources to the families of victims. Caucus members pushed through passage of legislation including the Protection of Children From Sexual Predators Act of 1998, Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act of 2000, AMBER Alert System, Code Adam Act, Protecting Our Children Comes First Act of 2007, and the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act. It became the largest bi-partisan, issue-based caucus in the House and inspired the creation of an identical caucus in the Senate.

Lampson authored the Protecting Our Children Comes First Act of 2007. It passed the House and Senate. It was signed into law by President Bush on June 3, 2008.

He introduced and passed the SAFE Act of 2007 in the House. Its intent was to amend the federal criminal code to expand the reporting requirements with respect to violations of laws prohibiting sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. It died in the Senate. Provisions of the bill were adopted in the PROTECT Our Children Act of 2008 and signed into law.

Lampson worked closely with the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children and became known as a tireless advocate for their interests on Capitol Hill.

=== Transportation and infrastructure ===
Lampson won support for numerous projects benefiting Southeast Texas, including the Neches River Salt Water Barrier, funding for improving areas of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, port upgrades, and coastal and beach improvement projects. Other notable projects that he secured federal funding for include the Galveston Causeway, Galveston Island Trolley expansion, NASA 1 Bypass Freeway, and major renovations to the Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base&#x27;s fire station.

He co-sponsored the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. The landmark legislation affirmed President Clinton&#x27;s key priorities: improving safety, protecting public health and the environment, and creating opportunity for all Americans.

Following the September 11 attacks, Lampson played a key role in passing Aviation Security legislation as a member of the Subcommittee on Aviation including the Aviation and Transportation Security Act. The bill created a new Transportation Security Administration.

He voted for the Maritime Transportation Antiterrorism Act.

He co-sponsored the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002&quot;.&quot; 

Lampson included language in the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans&#x27; Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act of 2007 waiving the local funding match required under the Stafford Act. It passed unanimously through the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and allowed Texas communities to qualify for disaster assistance programs, providing a savings to the State of Texas totaling upwards of $40 million.

=== NASA, the Johnson Space Center, and Human Space Flight ===
Lampson&#x27;s congressional district included the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. He established a reputation as a vocal advocate of the International Space Station, human space flights, and increased federal funding in support of NASA.

In 2002 and 2003, he introduced the Space Exploration Act, a bill to establish long-term goals for NASA and the nation&#x27;s space program. This bill was largely adopted as policy by the Bush Administration in 2004.

In 2007, he secured more than $300 million in additional federal funding for NASA.

In 2008, twelve house members led by Lampson successfully urged House leaders to add $2 billion to NASA&#x27;s budget in The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2008. The total budget was $20.2 billion. The additional funding allowed for a Space Shuttle flight to deliver the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer to the International Space Station. The project measures antimatter in cosmic rays and searches for evidence of dark matter. Samuel C. Ting, Nobel prize winning physicist, is the lead researcher on the project. The budget increase also accelerated the development of the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) and Ares I Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV), which would replace the Space Shuttle.

Additional legislation supported by Lampson includes the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2000, the Commercial Space Transportation Competitiveness Act of 2000, the NASA Flexibility Act of 2004, the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act of 2004, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2008.

He introduced the Amendment to the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2003, seeking to allow NASA to help Russia purchase additional Soyuz and Progress vehicles if the President notifies Congress they are needed to ensure the safety of the crew aboard the International Space Station and to maintain its operational viability while the Space Shuttle fleet is grounded; it influenced the Bush administration&#x27;s policy and led to passage of the Iran Nonproliferation Amendments Act of 2005.

Lampson was instrumental in passage of the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act of 2004. It provided guidelines for regulating the safety of commercial human spaceflight in the United States under the oversight of the Federal Aviation Administration. It also paved the way for commercial space tourism. The bill&#x27;s author, Congressman Dana Rohrabacher, credited Lampson among two other colleagues for being able to get this legislation passed.

=== Foreign affairs and travel ===
Lampson participated in the NATO Parliamentary Assembly and served as chairman of the Congressional Study Group on Germany, an inter-parliamentary assembly between the German Bundestag and the U.S. House of Representatives.

He was involved in the effort to expand NATO to include all of the Balkan states following the dissolution of the USSR. Traveling to each of the countries, he served as a delegate to help determine their membership eligibility.

The abduction of American children by a non-custodial parent and failure of countries such as Germany in honoring The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction was an issue pressed by Lampson. He authored a concurrent resolution agreed to in the House and Senate calling on allied nations to &quot;comply fully with both the letter and the spirit of their international legal obligations under the Convention to ensure their compliance to honor their commitments and return wrongfully abducted children to their place of habitual residence, and ensure parental access rights by removing obstacles to the exercise of those rights.&quot; Germany re-evaluated their non-compliance and put in place additional measures to honor the enforcement of international treaties compelling them to intervene in the return of abducted children to their country of origin.

Lampson was a member of the Cuba Working Group and a proponent of lifting trade embargoes. He co-sponsored the Cuban Food and Medicine Security Act of 1999, Bridges to the Cuban People Act of 2001, Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act of 2002, Export Freedom to Cuba Act of 2003, Bridges to the Cuban People Act of 2003, and Agricultural Export Facilitation Act of 2007.

In 1999, he traveled to Cuba with Southeast Texas rice farmers to meet President Fidel Castro and his government in an attempt to call for renewed agricultural trade between the United States and Cuba. Before a 1960s trade embargo, Cuba imported virtually all of its rice from the U.S. The members of the delegation played a major role in getting a landmark law signed by President Clinton the very next year: the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. For the first time in decades, it opened the door to modest trade with Cuba. As of 2016, that law has led to more than $5 billion in American exports to Cuba. In 2002, Lampson helped facilitate a deal to allow 30,000 metric tons of grain to be shipped to Cuba from the Port of Galveston for the first time in forty years.

In 2003, he traveled to Germany as part of a congressional delegation meeting with the German Bundestag. Part of the trip included a stop at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, where he visited with wounded U.S. servicemen and women.

In 2008, he traveled to Afghanistan, Pakistan and India with Senator Ben Nelson, Congressman Allen Boyd, and Congressman Tim Mahoney. They met with Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf

== Political positions ==
The &quot;National Journal&quot; ranked Lampson as the most conservative Democrat in Texas. Rated as more conservative than 53 percent of House members and more liberal than 47 percent, he ranked as the sixth-most-conservative Democrat overall, behind lawmakers from Georgia, Mississippi and Oklahoma in 2008.

Abortion

Lampson generally favored abortion rights but opposed &quot;partial-birth&quot; abortion. His position on abortion was that it is a personal matter.

He voted in favor of a ban on partial birth/late term abortions.

In 2004, Lampson was one of forty-eight Catholic members of Congress that signed a letter to the cardinal archbishop of Washington, D.C., saying the threats by some bishops to deny communion to politicians who support abortion rights were &quot;deeply hurtful,&quot; counterproductive and &quot;miring the Church in partisan politics.&quot;

During his tenure, he averaged a 66% rating by NARAL Pro-Choice America.

Energy

Lampson believed in balanced energy policies supporting both traditional fossil fuel activities and viable renewable energy sources. He encouraged research and development in new energy technologies.

Lampson was an original co-sponsor of the United States-India Nuclear Cooperation Approval and Nonproliferation Enhancement Act. It formalized President Bush and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh&#x27;s commitment in which India agreed to separate its civil and military nuclear facilities and to place all its civil nuclear facilities under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards and, in exchange, the United States agreed to work toward &quot;a full civil&quot; nuclear alliance with India. It enhanced cooperation in using nuclear energy and reduced the danger of nuclear proliferation.

He introduced the Industrial Energy Efficiency Research and Development Act of 2007. It sought to support research and development of new industrial processes and technologies that optimize energy efficiency and environmental performance, utilize diverse sources of energy, and increase economic competitiveness. The bill passed the House but died in the Senate.

Iraq

Lampson voted in favor of authorizing the use of military force against Iraq in 2002 following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In a 2019 statement on Facebook, Lampson expressed regret voting for the invasion into Iraq and believed the Bush administration misled Congress.

He voted in favor of referring a House resolution entitled &quot;H.Res.1258 - Impeaching George W. Bush, President of the United States, of high crimes and misdemeanors&quot; to the Judiciary Committee.

He was one of fifteen Democrats that voted against a bill that set a time table of withdrawing troops from Iraq by December 2008.

Clinton Impeachment

Lampson voted in favor of an Impeachment inquiry against Bill Clinton in 1998. He was one of only 31 Democrats to cross party lines to support it; they were referred to as &quot;The group of 31&quot;. Half of the defectors were members of the Blue Dog coalition, a group of Democrats who represent the center of the political spectrum. Lampson ultimately voted against the Impeachment of Bill Clinton.

== Later career ==

===2012 Congressional election===

After 14th District U.S. Congressman Ron Paul decided that he would not run for re-election to Congress in order to focus on his presidential campaign, Lampson filed papers to run for Congress in that 14th District. The 14th had been shifted well to the east in redistricting, and now included roughly 85 percent of the territory Lampson had represented during his first stint in Congress. Notably, Beaumont and Galveston, the largest cities in Lampson&#x27;s old district, were now in the 14th. Lampson won the May 29, 2012 primary with 83.23% of the vote and faced State Rep. Randy Weber in the November 6th general election. Lampson was defeated by Weber on November 6, 2012, by a 53% to 45% margin. Lampson only carried his home county of Jefferson County and was unable to overcome the partisan lean of a district that was significantly redder than the territory he had previously represented.

===2018 judicial election===
Lampson ran for county judge of Jefferson County in 2018. His opponent was Republican incumbent Jeff R. Branick. The election was held on November 6, 2018. He lost the election, 50.63% to 49.37%, a margin of 949 votes. Governor Greg Abbott, Senator Ted Cruz, and Sean Hannity made public appearances in Jefferson County in order to rally support for the vulnerable incumbent, who had switched to the Republican Party a year earlier. Lampson was endorsed by the Beaumont Enterprise. He focused his campaign on securing relief for victims of Hurricane Harvey and diversifying the economic development of Jefferson County.

===Other work===
Lampson has worked on seniors&#x27; issues at the local and national levels as a director of the Area Agency on Aging. He served as a delegate to the 1995 White House Conference on Aging. He is active with local organizations such as the American Heart Association, Land Manor (a rehabilitation facility), and the Young Men&#x27;s Business League. He is a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. He was chair of the 1995 Bishop&#x27;s Faith Appeal at the Diocese of Beaumont.

== Awards and honors ==
In 2019, Austria&#x27;s Habsburg family honored Lampson with the &quot;Medal of Friendship&quot; in recognition of his work as a leading advocate for the NASA space program, the relationships he built with international partners, and his overall commitment to peace.

In 2012, Lampson was honored as one of the &quot;Legends of Galveston&quot; at the Hilton Galveston Island Resort.

In 2008, Lampson was honored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce with their prestigious &quot;Spirit of Enterprise Award&quot; in recognition of his pro-business voting record. During the same year he was the recipient of the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) Guardian of Small Business Award in recognition of his strong voting record and his efforts to increase business opportunities, reduce taxes, and eliminate overly burdensome taxes in the 110th Congress.

In 2004, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children honored Lampson with the Congressional Leadership Award in recognition of his commitment to protecting American children. National television network Court TV honored Lampson with its first annual ‚ÄúKeep America Safe‚Äù award for his work on child safety issues.

The Laura Recovery Center honored Lampson with the Triangle of Trust Award. The award goes to individuals and organizations that have shown commitment to a relationship among law enforcement, communities and families of missing children.

In 2002, the Houston Chronicle ranked Lampson #1 in constituent services among all other Houston area congressmen.

The Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership honored Lampson with its prestigious Quasar Award for Exceptional Leadership in Economic Development in 1997.

He was recognized as the Outstanding Young Man of Beaumont in 1978 by the Texas Jaycees.

==Personal life==
Lampson is married to Susan Floyd-Lampson, a retired special education teacher and former Ms. Port Arthur. They have two daughters, Hillary and Stephanie, and six grandchildren. He and his family reside in their hometown of Beaumont. He is a former healthcare executive and currently consults for tech and energy companies.

Lampson underwent a successful quadruple bypass surgery on March 25, 2007, at the Texas Heart Institute. He is a Roman Catholic.

==Electoral history==

* The 1996 election took place in two parts: an open special primary election on November 5, 1996, concurrent with the general election, followed by a runoff between the two highest vote-getters that took place on December 10, 1996 (as neither Lampson nor Stockman gained 50% of the vote). This was because a three-judge court of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas redrew the boundaries of districts 18, 29, and 30, and redrew portions of districts 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 22, 24, 25, and 26. The District Court further ordered that the candidates in these districts who have filed by August 30, 1996, and been certified by September 5, 1996, would compete in the open primary special election due to the lack of time for a normal primary. See Bush v. Vera.


*Write-in and minor candidate notes: In the 2006 special election for the remaining two months of DeLay&#x27;s term, Republican Don Richardson received 7,405 votes and Republican Giannibicego Hoa Tran received 2,568 votes. In the 2006 general election, Don Richardson received 428 votes and Joe Reasbeck received 89 votes.

<text>Lincoln University is a private university in Oakland, California, United States. It enrolls more than 500 students in undergraduate- and graduate-level programs in business administration as well as an English-language program, certificate programs, and bachelor of science programs.

==History==
Named to honor President Abraham Lincoln, Lincoln University was founded and chartered under the laws of California in 1926. The first university officers were Benjamin Franklin Lickey, president, and Edward J. Silver, vice president and educational director. Lickey with his wife Susan had in 1919 founded a law study program in San Francisco for veterans returning after the First World War and other working adults, which offered evening classes to part-time students, while he was working as the western representative of the Law Department of the La Salle Extension University of Chicago which offered degrees through correspondence courses. The program developed into a tutorial center with a broader curriculum. One of its early slogans was &quot;The Shortcut to Success&quot;; it offered &quot;reasonable terms&quot; and a &quot;money-back guarantee&quot;.

By 1927 Lincoln University was operating on the Arcade Floor of the Phelan Building on Market Street in San Francisco with Colleges of Law and Commerce and a Department of Special Courses and Coaching, offering both day and evening classes as a co-educational institution.

An advertisement of that year showed Lincoln University offering college courses in law, commerce, foreign trade, and business administration and special courses and coaching in bar examination preparation, advertising, journalism, and public speaking. It also maintained a junior college and high school program, which operated a preparatory school and special preparation for College Board examinations. At this time Lickey served as president of Lincoln University while continuing as the agent of LaSalle Extension University.

Its nonprofit status was recognized by the Internal Revenue Service in 1950 and in 1961 a second campus was opened in San Jose. By 1987, the San Jose campus had become the location of the university&#x27;s law school programs. It separated in 1993 to become the independent Lincoln Law School of San Jose. The university moved from San Francisco to Oakland in December 1999.

Lincoln University was featured in a March 2011 &quot;Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; article entitled ‚ÄúLittle-Known Colleges Exploit Visa Loopholes to Make Millions Off Foreign Students.‚Äù

==Academics==
Lincoln University offers the following degree programs:
*Master of Business Administration
*Master of Science
*Bachelor of Arts
*Bachelor of Science

==Ranking==
In 2024, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Lincoln University Unranked in Business Schools.

==Undergraduate Admissions==
Lincoln University has an open admission policy, admitting all applicants so long as certain minimum requirements are met. For 2024, Lincoln University&#x27;s enrolled students had an average 2.6 high school GPA.

==Accreditation==
Lincoln University is accredited by the WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC). It was previously accredited by the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS) to award master&#x27;s and bachelor&#x27;s degrees. The university&#x27;s graduate business programs are accredited by the International Accreditation Council for Business Education (IACBE).

===U.S. Department of Education additional oversight===
It is on the U.S. Department of Education&#x27;s Federal Student Aid (FSA) &quot;List of Institutions on Heightened Cash Monitoring as of December 1, 2019.&quot; The U.S. Department of Education may place institutions on a Heightened Cash Monitoring (HCM) payment method to provide additional oversight of cash management. Heightened Cash Monitoring is a step that FSA can take with institutions to provide additional oversight for a number of financial or federal compliance issues, some of which may be serious and others that may be less troublesome. The list notes &quot;severe findings&quot; for Lincoln University.

== Athletics ==

In May 2023, ahead of its third year of sponsoring sports, Lincoln University announced that it had joined the South Western States Intercollegiate Conference of the NCCAA for four of its five total teams, with each men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer and basketball program joining the SWS, while football remained independent.

<text>Lincoln University (Lincoln U) is a public, historically black, land-grant university in Jefferson City, Missouri. Founded in 1866 by African-American veterans of the American Civil War, it is a member-school of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund. This was the first black university in the state. In the fall 2023, the university enrolled 1,799 students.

==History==

During the Civil War, the 62nd Colored Infantry regiment of the U.S. Army, largely recruited in Missouri, set up educational programs for its soldiers. At the end of the war it raised $6,300 to set up a black school, headed by a white abolitionist officer, Richard Foster, and founded by James Milton Turner, a student and protege of John Berry Meachum.

Foster opened the Lincoln Institute in Jefferson City in 1866. Lincoln had a black student body, both black and white teachers, and outside support from religious groups. The state government provided $5,000 a year to train teachers for the state&#x27;s new public school system for blacks, including mostly formerly enslaved men and women. 

Under the Morrill Act of 1890, Missouri designated the school a land-grant university, emphasizing agriculture, mechanics and teaching. This provision helped to establish funding for its operations.

By 1921, the college had expanded to offer graduate programs. It was officially designated a university by the state of Missouri. It changed its name to Lincoln University of Missouri. In 1954, it opened its doors to applicants of all ethnicities. It provides both undergraduate and graduate courses.

On May 22, 2019, Jefferson City was hit by an EF3 tornado, causing significant damage to the historic President&#x27;s Residence near the campus.

In May 2021, Lincoln University President Jerald Woolfolk announced her plans to step down at the end of that school year.

In 2024, Lincoln University alumni called for president John B. Moseley to step down following the suicide of vice-president Antoinette Candia-Bailey. She had complained of harassment and unfair treatment by him. In the ensuing months, an independent investigation was carried out by the University&#x27;s Board of Curators. President of the Board of Curators, Victor B. Pasley, stated ‚Äúduring this exhaustive, independent investigation, no evidence was found that Dr. Moseley bullied Dr. Candia-Bailey.&quot; After two months of voluntary leave, Moseley was reinstated as President of Lincoln University of Missouri. Sherman Bonds, president of the Lincoln University Alumni Association, issued a statement questioning the investigation‚Äôs findings and accusing the board of causing ‚Äúirrevocable harm, shame, hopelessness, and mortification to our beloved University.‚Äù 

=== Presidents ===
==Athletics==
The Lincoln University athletic teams are called the Blue Tigers. The university is a member of the NCAA Division II ranks, primarily competing in the Great Lakes Valley Conference (GLVC) since the 2024‚Äì25 academic year. The Blue Tigers previously competed in the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association (MIAA) from 2010‚Äì11 to 2023‚Äì24 (which they were a member on a previous stint from 1970‚Äì71 to 1998‚Äì99, but later left because it had not had a football team since after the 1989 fall season), as well as the Heartland Conference, of which it was a founding conference member, from 1999‚Äì2000 to 2009‚Äì10.

Lincoln competes in twelve intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, football, golf, soccer, and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball and track &amp; field.

The school revitalized its football program and re-entered the MIAA in 2010. The Lincoln University Women&#x27;s Track Team made NCAA Division II history by winning the Outdoor Track and Field Championships five consecutive times.

===Alma Mater &quot;Lincoln, O, Lincoln&quot;===
The alma mater is sung to the tune of &quot;Ach wie ist&#x27;s m√∂glich dann&quot;, a German folk song published in 1827 and variously credited to Georg Heinrich or Friedrich Silcher Kuchen (the West Point and Wake Forest alma mater songs use the same melody).

==Student activities==
Founder&#x27;s Day, traditionally held on the first Saturday of February, pays tribute to the founders of Lincoln University. Homecoming, usually held in October, is a celebratory time when family and friends of Lincoln University convene to participate in gala activities. Springfest, usually held in late April, celebrates the arrival of spring with games and other activities throughout the week.

===Marching Musical Storm===
The &quot;Marching Musical Storm&quot; is the university&#x27;s marching band. It was founded in 1948 and is one of the largest student organizations on campus. The band performs at all home football games, select basketball games, and other school-sanctioned functions throughout the year.

<text>Lincoln University (LU) is a public state-related historically black university (HBCU) near Oxford, Pennsylvania. Founded as the private Ashmun Institute in 1854, it has been a public institution since 1972 and is the second HBCU in the state, after Cheyney University of Pennsylvania. Lincoln is also recognized as the first college-degree granting HBCU in the country. Its main campus is located on near the town of Oxford in southern Chester County, Pennsylvania. The university has a second location in the University City area of Philadelphia. Lincoln University provides undergraduate and graduate coursework to approximately 2,000 students. It is a member-school of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund.

While a majority of its students are African Americans, the university has a long history of accepting students of other races and nationalities. Women have received degrees since 1953, and made up 66% of undergraduate enrollment in 2019.

==History==
In 1854, John Miller Dickey, a Presbyterian minister, and his wife, Sarah Emlen Cresson, a Quaker, founded Ashmun Institute, later named Lincoln University, in Hinsonville, Pennsylvania. They named it after Jehudi Ashmun, a religious leader and social reformer. They founded the school for the education of African Americans, who had few opportunities for higher education.

John Miller Dickey was the first president of the college. He encouraged some of his first students, James Ralston Amos (1826‚Äì1864), his brother Thomas Henry Amos (1825‚Äì1869), and Armistead Hutchinson Miller (1829/30-1865), to support the establishment of Liberia as a colony for African Americans. Each of the men became an ordained minister.

In 1866, a year after the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, Ashmun Institute was renamed Lincoln University. The college attracted highly talented students from numerous states, especially during the decades of legal segregation in the American South. Many alumni furthered their careers in academia, public service, and the arts. President William Howard Taft gave the commencement address at Lincoln in 1910.

In June 1921, days after the Tulsa race massacre, President Warren Harding visited Lincoln to deliver the commencement address. He spoke about the need to seek healing and harmony in that incident&#x27;s aftermath, as well as to honor Lincoln alumni who were among the 367,000 African-American servicemen who fought in World War I. The school newspaper noted Harding&#x27;s visit as &quot;the high water mark in the history of the institution.&quot;

In 1945 Horace Mann Bond, an alumnus of Lincoln, became the first African-American president of the university. He served for twelve years. 

In 1946, inspite of then prevailing racial dynamics, Albert Einstein visited the university to give a lecture on Physics and also spoke on racism. This was depicted in a 2017 episode of Genius (American TV series), which dramatizes Einstein&#x27;s life.

From 1854 to 1954, Lincoln University graduates accounted for 20% of African American physicians and over 10% of African American lawyers in the United States.

The university marked its hundredth anniversary by amending its charter in 1953 to permit the granting of degrees to women. True coeducation was slow to arrive, however, and women still constituted only 5% of the student body in 1964.

In 1972 Lincoln University formally associated with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a state-related institution.

In November 2014, university president Robert R. Jennings resigned under pressure from faculty, students and alumni after comments relating to issues of sexual assault. Jennings was also the subject of a couple of no-confidence votes by faculty and the alumni association in October 2014.

In 2017, Brenda A. Allen became Lincoln&#x27;s new president. She graduated from Lincoln in 1981.

In 2020, MacKenzie Scott donated $20 million to Lincoln University. Her donation is the largest single gift in Lincoln&#x27;s history.

==Academics==
According to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, Lincoln University ranks number 19 in the 2020 magazine&#x27;s ranking of HBCUs. In 2020 the &quot;US News &amp; World Best Colleges Report&quot; rated Lincoln 119 among Regional Universities North.

Lincoln University&#x27;s International and Study Abroad Program had student participation in Service Learning Projects in the countries of Ecuador, Argentina, Spain, Ireland, Costa Rica, Japan, France, Cambodia, Zambia, Liberia, Ghana, Kenya, Russia, Australia, Thailand, the Czech Republic, Mexico, and South Africa

The Lincoln-Barnes Visual Arts program is a collaboration between Lincoln University and the Barnes Foundation. It established a Visual Arts program that leads to a Bachelor of Fine Arts, and most recently, a Pan-Africana Studies major has been added to the list undergraduate majors available at the institution.

==Campus==

Lincoln University main campus is with 56 buildings totaling over one million gross square feet. There are fifteen residence halls that accommodate over 1,600 students. The residence halls range from small dorms such as Alumni Hall, built in 1870; and Amos Hall, built in 1902, to the new coed 400-bed apartment-style living (ASL) suites built in 2005. There are additional off-campus housing arrangements such as Thorn Flats, in Newark, Delaware. The campus was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2022.

The four-story, Ivory V. Nelson Science Center and General Classroom High Technology Building was completed in 2008. The International Cultural Center was completed in 2010.

The Health and Wellness Center is a facility that opened in 2012. There is also a football stadium on campus. One of the most visible landmarks on campus is the Alumni Memorial Arch, located at the entrance to the university. The arch was dedicated by President Warren G. Harding in 1921, to honor the Lincoln men who served in World War I.

The Langston Hughes Memorial Library (LHML): Vail Memorial Library served as the first physical library building on the Lincoln University campus. Its collection outgrew the building&#x27;s capacity after notable 1929 alumnus and renowned poet, James Mercer Langston Hughes, bequeathed the contents of his personal library to the university upon his death in 1967. Construction of a larger building was underway in 1970. The new Langston Hughes Memorial Library (LHML) opened in 1972. Holdings include over 185,000 volumes as well as databases containing in excess of 30,000 journal titles, periodicals, eBooks, and media offerings.

The completely renovated Student Union Building contains the bookstore, caf√©, two television studios, and a radio studio, postal services, and multipurpose rooms. The Thurgood Marshall Living Learning Center, along with the Student Union Building, are the centers for campus social and meeting activities. Marshall graduated in the class of 1930, directed the NAACP&#x27;s Legal Defense Fund in groundbreaking cases, and was the first African American to be appointed as a justice to US Supreme Court.

Lincoln University is a census-designated place (CDP) for statistical purposes. As of the 2010 census, Lincoln University CDP had a resident population of 1,726.

==The Barnes Foundation==
As president of Lincoln University (1945‚Äì1957), Horace Mann Bond formed a friendship with Albert C. Barnes, philanthropist and art collector who established the Barnes Foundation. Barnes took a special interest in the institution and built a relationship with its students. Barnes gave Lincoln University the privilege of naming four of the five directors originally set as the number for the governing board of the Barnes Foundation.

Barnes had an interest in helping under-served youth and populations. Barnes intended his $25 billion art collection to be used primarily as a teaching resource. He limited the number of people who could view it, and for years even the kinds of people, with a preference for students and working class. Visitors still must make appointments in advance to see the collection, and only a limited number are allowed in the galleries at one time.

In the mid-20th century, local government restricted traffic to the current campus, located in a residential neighborhood located at 300 North Latch&#x27;s Lane, Merion, Pennsylvania. Barnes&#x27; constraints, local factors, and management issues pushed the Foundation near bankruptcy by the 1990s. Supporters began to explore plans to move the collection to a more public location and maintain it to museum standards. To raise money for needed renovations to the main building to protect the collection, the Foundation sent some of the most famous Impressionist and Modern paintings on tour.

In 2002, the Attorney General of Pennsylvania D. Michael Fisher contested Albert C. Barnes&#x27; will, arguing that the Merion location of the collection and small number of board members limited the Foundation&#x27;s ability to sustain itself financially. Pennsylvania Governor Edward Rendell brokered a settlement in 2005 between the Barnes Foundation and Lincoln University. This agreement resulted in the number of directors increasing. This has diluted Lincoln&#x27;s influence over the collection, now valued at approximately twenty-five billion dollars.

A documentary named The Art of the Steal depicts the events.

<text>A tolerance interval (TI) is a statistical interval within which, with some confidence level, a specified sampled proportion of a population falls. &quot;More specifically, a tolerance interval provides limits within which at least a certain proportion (&quot;p&quot;) of the population falls with a given level of confidence (1‚àíŒ±).&quot; &quot;A (&quot;p&quot;, 1‚àíŒ±) tolerance interval (TI) based on a sample is constructed so that it would include at least a proportion &quot;p&quot; of the sampled population with confidence 1‚àíŒ±; such a TI is usually referred to as p-content ‚àí (1‚àíŒ±) coverage TI.&quot; &quot;A (p, 1‚àíŒ±) upper tolerance limit (TL) is simply a 1‚àíŒ± upper confidence limit for the 100 &quot;p&quot; percentile of the population.&quot;

== Definition ==
Assume observations or random variates formula_1 as realization of independent random variables formula_2 which have a common distribution formula_3, with unknown parameter formula_4.
Then, a tolerance interval with endpoints formula_5 which has the defining property:

:formula_6
where formula_7 denotes the infimum function. 

This is in contrast to a prediction interval with endpoints formula_8 which has the defining property:
:formula_9.
Here, formula_10 is a random variable from the same distribution formula_3 but independent of the first formula_12 variables.

Notice formula_10 is {{em|not}} involved in the definition of tolerance interval, which deals only with the first sample, of size &quot;n&quot;.

==Calculation==
One-sided normal tolerance intervals have an exact solution in terms of the sample mean and sample variance based on the noncentral &quot;t&quot;-distribution. 
Two-sided normal tolerance intervals can be estimated using the chi-squared distribution.

==Relation to other intervals==
{{further|Interval estimation}}

&quot;In the parameters-known case, a 95% tolerance interval and a 95% prediction interval are the same.&quot; If we knew a population&#x27;s exact parameters, we would be able to compute a range within which a certain proportion of the population falls. For example, if we know a population is normally distributed with mean formula_14 and standard deviation formula_15, then the interval formula_16 includes 95% of the population (1.96 is the z-score for 95% coverage of a normally distributed population).

However, if we have only a sample from the population, we know only the sample mean formula_17 and sample standard deviation formula_18, which are only estimates of the true parameters. In that case, formula_19 will not necessarily include 95% of the population, due to variance in these estimates. A tolerance interval bounds this variance by introducing a confidence level formula_20, which is the confidence with which this interval actually includes the specified proportion of the population. For a normally distributed population, a z-score can be transformed into a &quot;&quot;k&quot; factor&quot; or tolerance factor for a given formula_20 via lookup tables or several approximation formulas. &quot;As the degrees of freedom approach infinity, the prediction and tolerance intervals become equal.&quot;

The tolerance interval is less widely known than the confidence interval and prediction interval, a situation some educators have lamented, as it can lead to misuse of the other intervals where a tolerance interval is more appropriate.

The tolerance interval differs from a confidence interval in that the confidence interval bounds a single-valued population parameter (the mean or the variance, for example) with some confidence, while the tolerance interval bounds the range of data values that includes a specific proportion of the population. Whereas a confidence interval&#x27;s size is entirely due to sampling error, and will approach a zero-width interval at the true population parameter as sample size increases, a tolerance interval&#x27;s size is due partly to sampling error and partly to actual variance in the population, and will approach the population&#x27;s probability interval as sample size increases.

The tolerance interval is related to a prediction interval in that both put bounds on variation in future samples. However, the prediction interval only bounds a single future sample, whereas a tolerance interval bounds the entire population (equivalently, an arbitrary sequence of future samples). In other words, a prediction interval covers a specified proportion of a population &quot;on average&quot;, whereas a tolerance interval covers it &quot;with a certain confidence level&quot;, making the tolerance interval more appropriate if a single interval is intended to bound multiple future samples.

==Examples==

 gives the following example: So consider once again a proverbial EPA mileage test scenario, in which several nominally identical autos of a particular model are tested to produce mileage figures formula_22. If such data are processed to produce a 95% confidence interval for the mean mileage of the model, it is, for example, possible to use it to project the mean or total gasoline consumption for the manufactured fleet of such autos over their first 5,000 miles of use. Such an interval, would however, not be of much help to a person renting one of these cars and wondering whether the (full) 10-gallon tank of gas will suffice to carry him the 350 miles to his destination. For that job, a prediction interval would be much more useful. (Consider the differing implications of being &quot;95% sure&quot; that formula_23 as opposed to being &quot;95% sure&quot; that formula_24.) But neither a confidence interval for formula_14 nor a prediction interval for a single additional mileage is exactly what is needed by a design engineer charged with determining how large a gas tank the model really needs to guarantee that 99% of the autos produced will have a 400-mile cruising range. What the engineer really needs is a tolerance interval for a fraction formula_26 of mileages of such autos.

Another example is given by: The air lead levels were collected from formula_27 different areas within the facility. It was noted that the log-transformed lead levels fitted a normal distribution well (that is, the data are from a lognormal distribution. Let formula_14 and formula_29, respectively, denote the population mean and variance for the log-transformed data. If formula_30 denotes the corresponding random variable, we thus have formula_31. We note that formula_32 is the median air lead level. A confidence interval for formula_14 can be constructed the usual way, based on the &quot;t&quot;-distribution; this in turn will provide a confidence interval for the median air lead level. If formula_34 and formula_35 denote the sample mean and standard deviation of the log-transformed data for a sample of size n, a 95% confidence interval for formula_14 is given by formula_37, where formula_38 denotes the formula_39 quantile of a &quot;t&quot;-distribution with formula_40 degrees of freedom. It may also be of interest to derive a 95% upper confidence bound for the median air lead level. Such a bound for formula_14 is given by formula_42. Consequently, a 95% upper confidence bound for the median air lead is given by formula_43. Now suppose we want to predict the air lead level at a particular area within the laboratory. A 95% upper prediction limit for the log-transformed lead level is given by formula_44. A two-sided prediction interval can be similarly computed. The meaning and interpretation of these intervals are well known. For example, if the confidence interval formula_37 is computed repeatedly from independent samples, 95% of the intervals so computed will include the true value of formula_14, in the long run. In other words, the interval is meant to provide information concerning the parameter formula_14 only. A prediction interval has a similar interpretation, and is meant to provide information concerning a single lead level only. Now suppose we want to use the sample to conclude whether or not at least 95% of the population lead levels are below a threshold. The confidence interval and prediction interval cannot answer this question, since the confidence interval is only for the median lead level, and the prediction interval is only for a single lead level. What is required is a tolerance interval; more specifically, an upper tolerance limit. The upper tolerance limit is to be computed subject to the condition that at least 95% of the population lead levels is below the limit, with a certain confidence level, say 99%.

In 1984, he finished school and training, and served in the East German National People&#x27;s Army (German: &quot;Nationale Volksarmee&quot; or NVA). Brussig found it difficult to wield a weapon and had a hard time. He worked as a museum guard, cleaner and hotel porter among a variety of other odd jobs until the early 90s. In 1990, he studied sociology at the Free University of Berlin. He changed universities 3 years later to study the art of film-making. He graduated in the year 2000.

Thomas Brussig commutes back and forth from Berlin to Mecklenburg as a writer and is married.

<doc id="833695" wikidata="Q710121" url="?curid=833695" title="Arthur Kane">
<text>Arthur Harold Kane Jr. (February 3, 1949 ‚Äì July 13, 2004) was an American musician best known as the bass guitarist for the pioneering glam rock band the New York Dolls. Kane was a founding member of the Dolls in 1971 and remained an integral part of the band until he was forced out in 1975, shortly after the departure of Johnny Thunders and Jerry Nolan. In 2004, after decades of estrangement from Dolls singer David Johansen, Kane rejoined the surviving Dolls (Johansen and Sylvain Sylvain) to rehearse and play a reunion concert in London, which was the subject of the 2005 documentary &quot;New York Doll&quot;. In addition to his bass playing, Kane was known for his subculture fashion sense and for uttering original aphorisms in his uniquely toned voice.

Kane&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Killer&quot;, was inspired by the first article written about the Dolls in which the journalist described Kane&#x27;s &quot;killer bass playing&quot;. Kane also said that it was inspired by the adversary of the 1930s&#x27; science fiction hero &quot;Buck Rogers&quot;, a villainous character named Killer Kane.

== Early life ==
Kane was born in The Bronx, New York City, the only child of Erna and Harold Kane. His mother&#x27;s ancestors had immigrated from Sweden. Arthur was close to his mother and her aunt, his Aunt Millie, who used to like to listen to Elvis records. The first word that he learned as a young child was &quot;record&quot;. When Arthur was seventeen, his mother died of cancer (leukemia). His father was an abusive alcoholic and, when he quickly remarried, Arthur left home for good. He graduated from Martin Van Buren High School in Queens. He first played bass in the band Actress along with other original New York Dolls: Johnny Thunders, Rick Rivets and Billy Murcia.

Kane attended Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York as a Food Science and Management student. During his early years there, Kane socialized with art students such as Eric Marshall in the Pratt dormitory on Willoughby Avenue. Marshall was later, through association with the retro New Wave band Marbles, recruited on saxophone for fellow-Doll Sylvain&#x27;s short-lived Criminals. Kane was always interested in music. By his third year at Pratt he had stopped attending classes, was sharing an apartment with Dave Trott, and wanted to start a band. At twenty-one he inherited money that he used to move to Amsterdam hoping to find like-minded musicians.

==The New York Dolls==

After returning home after spending about a year in Amsterdam, Kane had been noticing a charismatic figure around New York City with avant-garde hair and clothes who would shortly take on the name Johnny Thunders. Kane decided to approach him one day in front of a West Village pizzeria (accompanied by Rick Rivets, who had heard that Johnny was a musician) to ask him if he wanted to get together sometime to jam on their instruments. Shortly thereafter they all met at a rehearsal studio, where they had booked some time, located in the West Thirties area of New York City (Johnny brought along his friend Billy Murcia to play drums). Kane later wrote in his autobiography that as he was about to enter the studio space he heard Johnny&#x27;s original style of playing electric guitar:
&quot;It was raunchy, nasty, rough, raw, and untamed,&quot; adding, &quot;His sound was rich and fat and beautiful, like a voice.&quot; Kane had originally envisioned himself as being the guitar player of the band but in that moment offered to pick up a Fender bass to accompany saying, &quot;I know exactly what to play with what you&#x27;re playing on guitar. Let&#x27;s hear what it sounds like.&quot; Adding, &quot;And it sounded great to us. We had hit the nail on the head.&quot;

Sometime after that event, Kane then approached future Dolls singer David Johansen. As Johansen explains it:
Killer Kane was known for his outrageous outfits such as one-piece body stockings, large bow-ties, and thigh-high, neon-colored platform boots. Kane created many original and infamous looks by scouring shops in London, &quot;combing through Amsterdam&#x27;s Waterlooplein flea market during all of 1970&quot;, and &quot;various Brooklyn thrift shops&quot;. Mixing pop art with music, the Dolls sought to create a persona as &quot;larger-than-life rock-and-roll comic book superheroes&quot;, or as if they were a band from outer space ‚Äì concepts that were expanded upon in one form or another not much later by other bands such as KISS.
In addition to his signature bass sound, Kane had a unique way of performing on stage. As rock photographer Bob Gruen explained, while playing bass Kane &quot;moved a bit robotically, kind of like a giant Frankenstein.&quot; Throughout his tenure with the Dolls, Kane dated a succession of atypically tall women, including Stacia of Hawkwind.

The Dolls put out two studio albums, 1973&#x27;s &quot;New York Dolls&quot; and 1974&#x27;s &quot;Too Much Too Soon&quot;. The Dolls influenced several bands that came soon after with the emerging Punk scene such as the Sex Pistols, The Clash, The Damned, and Generation X; and were a precursor to 80&#x27;s Glam metal bands such as M√∂tley Cr√ºe, Cinderella, and Poison.

Their drummer, Billy Murcia, died from an accidental overdose while they were touring England in 1972. Plagued by bad management, drug and alcohol abuse, and cliques forming within the group, the band broke up in 1975 ‚Äì Kane&#x27;s last experience with the band that year being a shouting match in a trailer court in Florida.

==Post-Dolls==

After the Dolls broke up, Kane collaborated with Blackie Lawless (who would later form W.A.S.P.) on a project dubbed Killer Kane, which resulted in the single &quot;Mr. Cool.&quot; Lawless was an old friend from New York City and had replaced Johnny Thunders during the ill-fated Florida tour in 1975.

After the Dolls, Kane was involved in several projects including: playing bass in the band formed by Sid Vicious (who had a brief solo career in 1978 after the Sex Pistols); being a member of The Idols (with Jerry Nolan), and The Corpse Grinders (with Rick Rivets); and joining Johnny Thunders on a few tours in the 1980s.

These projects failed to turn into long-term gigs, and Kane began to feel that there was no longer any place in the music business for him; that what little material success he had achieved with the Dolls was to be the high-water mark of his career. Kane saw himself living in poverty and obscurity for the rest of his life. As this bitter realization gripped him, band after band directly inspired by the Dolls catapulted to stardom, and the other members of the Dolls continued their careers. Lead singer of the Dolls, David Johansen, who Kane viewed as a rival, found success as Buster Poindexter.

As a result, Kane grew frustrated with music (although he continued playing and in fact learned harmonica during this period). He relocated from New York City to Los Angeles, but he could not escape his regrets. His envy and creative block, coupled with alcoholism and the breakdown of his marriage, led to a deepening depression. Although urban myth frames Kane as a drug addict, this was not the case; his true downfall was alcohol. After seeing David Johansen as the Ghost of Christmas Past in the comedy &quot;Scrooged&quot;, Arthur, in his depression, got drunk and jumped out of a second storey window. Although a planter box partially broke his fall, the impact caused slight neural damage and affected his speech.

In 1992 Kane was walking home from a party for the Red Hot Chili Peppers when someone attacked him and he was later found in a ditch near his apartment. His injuries were severe enough that he was in physical therapy to learn how to walk and talk again. A rumor then circulated that he was a victim of the Rodney King riots, but that was another urban legend. Nobody actually knows what happened and he might have simply been mugged by a &quot;violent street person&quot;. For several years Kane lived in a small studio apartment in West Hollywood where he was just scraping by financially.

Kane surprised all who knew him when in 1989 he joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In 1998 Kane started volunteer work as a librarian assisting the public with genealogy at the Family History Center at the Los Angeles Temple. It was while browsing the Social Security Death Index (SSDI) on microfilm one day in the genealogy library that Kane discovered that his father, with whom Arthur had been estranged since the death of his mother in 1966, was deceased.

==New York Dolls reunion and film==
In the early 2000s, Kane met filmmaker Greg Whiteley through his work with the Latter-day Saints, and the two became friends. Whiteley commented that all Kane ever talked about was how he wished that he could somehow get the Dolls back together. Whiteley started shopping around the idea of doing a film on Kane&#x27;s life. Coincidentally, in 2004 Morrissey‚Äîwho for decades had been a high-profile fan of the Dolls‚Äîoffered Kane an opportunity to perform a reunion show with the surviving Dolls (David Johansen and Sylvain Sylvain) at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of his Meltdown Festival (former band members Johnny Thunders died in 1991 at age 38, and Jerry Nolan in 1992 at age 45). When Kane called Whiteley to ask for a ride to the pawn shop to retrieve his bass guitar, Whiteley asked if he could bring along a camera. From there Whiteley filmed Kane&#x27;s experiences preparing for the reunion, rehearsing with the Dolls in New York, and reconciling with Johansen, culminating in two sold-out shows in London; which for Kane was all a fulfillment of a nearly thirty-year dream. Whiteley&#x27;s footage resulted in the 2005 Sundance-featured documentary, &quot;New York Doll&quot;.
==Death and legacy==
On July 13, 2004, just 22 days after the reunion concert, Kane thought that he had caught the flu in London and checked himself into a Los Angeles hospital, complaining of fatigue. He was quickly diagnosed with leukemia and died within two hours. He was 55 years old. Johansen described Kane as &quot;nonjudgmental, bawdy and holy.&quot;

Annual tributes to Kane&#x27;s lasting memory and influence were held at the Continental in New York City until its closing in 2006. Singer-songwriter Robyn Hitchcock wrote a tribute to Kane, &quot;N.Y. Doll&quot;, for his 2006 album, &quot;Ol√©! Tarantula&quot;. In 2009 Kane&#x27;s autobiography was published entitled, &quot;I, Doll: Life and Death with the New York Dolls,&quot; with the foreword and epilogue written by Barbara Kane.

Kane met Barbara (n√©e Garrison) when he was with the Dolls, and they were married in 1977. Although they were separated for many years, their divorce never became finalized. She was interviewed for the &quot;New York Doll&quot; documentary, portions of which are interspersed within the film&#x27;s narrative.

In 2005 the documentary, &quot;New York Dolls: All Dolled Up&quot;, was released on DVD. The directors, rock photographer Bob Gruen, and his then wife, Nadya Beck, owned an early video camera and shot many hours of footage of the Dolls in the early 1970s. Edited down to 95 minutes, the black and white film shows the Dolls in different locales, such as backstage or at an airport, and documents several of the Dolls&#x27; live performances in New York City and California. Kane appears in some of the footage wearing a plaster cast on his left arm. This was the result of his volatile girlfriend Connie Gripp (1947‚Äì1983) attempting to cut off his thumb so that he would be unable to play bass anymore. In his autobiography, fellow bass player and Dolls fan Dee Dee Ramone mentioned Kane when discussing Connie, whom he himself later dated. Dee Dee and Connie&#x27;s similarly violent and tumultuous relationship would inspire the 1977 Ramones song &quot;Glad to See You Go&quot;.

<text>The Certificate of Merit Medal was a military decoration of the United States Army that was issued between the years of 1905 and 1918. The Certificate of Merit Medal replaced the much older Certificate of Merit which was authorized by the United States Congress on March 3, 1847.

==History==
The system of military awards and decorations presented to members of the United States Military can trace its lineage to the Badge of Military Merit. This military award, established by George Washington, was given in recognition of soldiers who displayed unusual gallantry or extraordinary fidelity. Awarded three times during the Revolutionary War, the Badge of Military Merit was not awarded again. Thus, for more than 50 years the United States Military had no official military decorations.

===Original Certificate of Merit===
The original Certificate of Merit was authorized by an Act of Congress related to the expansion of the US Army during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War (1846‚Äì1848). The legislation authorized brevets to non-commissioned officers and for privates who distinguished themselves in service &quot;the President may in like manner grant him a certificate of merit, which shall entitle him to additional pay at the rate of two dollars per month.&quot; This was a step forward in the recognition of the individual contributions of soldiers. The first certificates were only authorized for Privates and it was not until 1854 that the Certificate of Merit was awarded to NCOs the rank of Sergeant and above. The Certificate of Merit was never authorized for officers. During this period from at least 1865 to 1904, the Certificate was used as an equivalent to the Medal of Honor. This created a dilemma for some soldiers, who applied for both awards, hoping to benefit from the pay increase included with the Certificate, in spite of the fact that military protocol restricted them to only one decoration. George Jordan is an example of a soldier who received both. It was issued to 545 soldiers during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. After the war, the Certificate of Merit was discontinued.

===Reintroduced Certificate of Merit===
Though the Army was of the position that it no longer had the authority to award the Certificate of Merit, commanders in the field continued to recommend soldiers for the award, but the Army did not act on the nominations. Following the Battle of Little Big Horn in 1876, the Certificate of Merit was reintroduced.

In 1892, the criteria for the Certificate of Merit was changed. Adjutant General&#x27;s Circular number 2 dated 11 February 1892 stated:

Medals of honor should be awarded to officers or enlisted men for distinguished bravery in action, while certificates of merit should, under law, be awarded for distinguished service, whether in action or otherwise, of a valuable character to the United States as, for example, extraordinary exertion in the preservation of human life, or in the preservation of public property, or rescuing public property from destruction by fire or otherwise, or any hazardous service by which the Government is saved loss in men or material. Simple heroism in battle, on the contrary, is fitly rewarded by a medal of honor, although such act of heroism may not have resulted in any benefit to the United States. Where the conduct of an enlisted man, non-commissioned officer or private has been represented to merit both a medal of honor and a certificate of merit, recommendation may be made for both, either simultaneously or at different times.

Soldiers, both privates and non-commissioned officers, were eligible for award of a Certificate of Merit upon the recommendation of their regimental or corps commander. Service could be in peacetime or in time of war. These regulations remained in effect until 9 July 1918.

===Certificate of Merit Medal===
In 1905, a medal was created for those holding a Certificate of Merit and called the Certificate of Merit Medal. This medal was authorized for wear on a United States military uniform. It was always worn following the Medal of Honor, before all campaign medals. The first recipient of the Certificate of Merit Medal was First Lieutenant William B. Baker, who was presented medal No. 1 on 30 December 1907. Baker had received an original Certificate of Merit as a corporal during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War on 13 August 1898. The last act recognized by a Certificate of Merit was May 1918, when Corporal Paul Scaletta made a water rescue of soldiers in dangerous surf condition at Ocean Beach, California. The last soldier to be awarded the Certificate of Merit Medal was George Arrington for his service while a Private with the 24th Infantry Regiment in 1889. He was awarded medal No. 361, and subsequently converted it to a Distinguished Service Cross.

===Conversion===
The Certificate of Merit Medal was declared obsolete on July 19, 1918. Those holding the Certificate of Merit Medal could exchange their medal for the newly created Distinguished Service Medal. In 1934, Congress changed the regulation allowing the conversion of the medal to the Distinguished Service Cross, including those converted to the Distinguished Service Medal.

==Appearance==
The medal is bronze, 1.25 inches in diameter. The obverse depicts an eagle facing left, with its wings partially spread. The eagle is surrounded by the inscription &quot;VIRTUTIS ET AUDACIAE MONUMENTUM ET PRAEMIUM&quot; (&quot;Virtue and Audacity are Their Own Monument and Reward&quot;).

The reverse of the medal bears the word, &quot;FOR MERIT&quot; surrounded by an oak wreath of two branches, the stems joined at the bottom by a bow. Around the edge in relief are the words, &quot;UNITED STATES ARMY&quot; at the top and thirteen stars below.

The suspension and service ribbon of the Certificate of Merit Medal is red, white and blue. It has two stripes of blue at the edges with equal stripes of white. A wide central stripe of red is bisected by a thin stripe of white.

<text>Ganamukti Parishad (Bengali for &#x27;Tripura State Indigenous People&#x27;s Liberation Council&#x27;) is a left-wing movement working amongst the Tripuri peoples of Tripura, in north-eastern India. It is affiliated with Communist Party of India (Marxist) as its tribal wing.

==Split ==
In March 1967, the party split into two factions:

*Tripura Rajya Ganamukti Parishad, attached to Communist Party of India
*Tripura Rajaer Upajati Ganamukti Parishad, attached to Communist Party of India (Marxist)

==Origins==

During the 1940s the royal house of Tripura tried its best to maintain its political rule over the state. However, monarchy was challenged by movements that were influenced by the Indian National Congress and the Communist Party of India. These associations proposed democratic reforms, but were met with stern resistance from the royal house. In 1946 members of &quot;Janamangal Samiti&quot; (People&#x27;s Welfare Association), &quot;Janasiksha Samiti&quot; (People&#x27;s Educational Association), the local cell of the Communist Party and individual left-wingers got together to form the &quot;Tripura Rajya Prajamandal&quot; (Tripura State Popular Assembly). Prajamandal proposed a form of constitutional monarchy for the state.

The Prajamandal included both communists and non-communists. In 1948 a ban on the organisation was proposed, on the ground that the organisation was under the influence of communists in East Pakistan. This spurred the non-communist leaders of Prajamandal to try to expel the communists. However, the ban was enforced before the expulsion had taken place. Leaders of Prajamandal were arrested, and many cadres went into hiding. By not differentiating between communists and non-communists in repressing Prajamandal, the royal government indirectly contributed to increasing the support for the communist within the organisation. On Independence Day Prajamandal took out a militant manifestation in Agartala. Simultaneously, the movement started activating itself in the struggle for Tiprasas land rights. Following the Partition of India, a major wave of Bengali Hindus migrated to Tripura from East Pakistan. On the Tripura countryside Bengali money-lenders started to take over agricultural land from indebted Tiprasas. Prajamandal organised resistance, a struggle that radicalized the movement.

On several sites the movement resulted in clashes with the state forces. In October police firing in Bishalgarh killed nine Tiprasa and injured twenty more. The military set up camps in the tribal areas, with the objective of rooting out Prajamandal. The Prajamandal leadership considered that it had no possibility to cope with the increasing repression, and decided to dissolve the association.

In the void that emerged after the disappearance of Prajamandal, Tiprasa leaders founded the &quot;Tripura Rajaer Mukti Parishad&quot; (Tripura State Liberation Council, generally called &quot;Mukti Parishad&quot;). Mukti Parishad raised demands of withdrawal of the DIR and freedom of expression and association. The slogan of the movement was &#x27;Democratic Rights for the People of Tripura&#x27;.

==Armed struggle==
As Tripura was put under military rule in March 1949, the leadership of the &quot;Mukti Parishad&quot; went underground to escape arrests. In the tribal belts of the state armed resistance was organized by the GMP. Inspired by the advances of the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army, the Mukti Parishad set up the &quot;Shanti Sena&quot; (Peace Army), which routed out the troops of the administration from the tribal belt. In the ‚Äòliberated areas‚Äô people&#x27;s government was in command, with the Village Committees of GMP managing the everyday affairs. The tribals didn&#x27;t have to pay any taxes to the state, nor would they turn to the courts of the state to express their queries. At the same time, a cultural revolution took place within the tribal society as abolition of child marriages, forced labour, excessive alcohol consumption, oppression of women, etc. were outlawed by the GMP.

==Entry into mainstream politics==
Armed resistance lasted until 1951. Then the strategies changed as a result of the changes in the political climate of the state. The Communist Party had begun to operate over-ground. In the end of 1949 the leaders of GMP had joined CPI. Now the struggle of the GMP was to be taken overground, in cooperation with CPI. In the first parliamentary elections of India in 1952 both seats of the Lok Sabha (2nd chamber of the Indian parliament) were won by the CPI. Both of the elected MPs, Biren Dutta and Dasarth Deb, were stalwarts of the GMP. Deb, the president of GMP, was at the time of election still considered as a guerrilla leader on the run by the police. The cases against him were not dropped until he was pardoned by the Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru himself after having reached the parliament premises incognito for his first session.

==1967 conference==

It should be mentioned that although the bulk of the leadership as well as the common members of the GMP were tribals, the GMP was not an exclusively Tiprasa organization at this time (Biren Dutta, for example was a Bengali). After the end of the armed struggle, an intense debate surged within the CPI concerning the future role of the GMP. Some considered that the GMP, whose membership was overwhelmingly agrarian, should be integrated into the peasant mass organization of the party, AIKS, and that Tiprasas and Bengali peasants should fight together since their class interests were the same. Other, such as Deb, considered that the tribals were not merely peasants but also constituted a separate sub-national entity and that the GMP should be a Tiprasa organization articulating the sub-nationalist consciousness of the tribal community.

In the beginning of the 1960s CPI suffered a severe internal division. The party was split into two camps on issues such as the relationship to the Congress party and the Sino-Soviet polemic. In 1964 the split was a fact, as two separate party congresses were held, one by CPI and the other by Communist Party of India (Marxist). The split also came to divide the Tripura unit of the CPI, with the CPI(M) soon having outmanovered the CPI in Tripura. Initially both factions agreed that the GMP ought to stay intact and that it would be spared from the split for the sake of unity of the mass organization movement, but soon competition over control over the organization started. At the GMP conference of 1967 the split had also reached the GMP, and CPI(M) formed &quot;Tripura Rajaer Upajati Ganamukti Parishad&quot; and its leader within the GMP, Deb, who were able to gather the support of the broad majority of the organization. At the same conference the GMP was re-christened as the Upajati (i.e., Tribal) Ganamukti Parishad. Subsequently, non-tribals were no longer able to obtain GMP membership. Thus Deb&#x27;s thesis that Tiprasa constituted as separate subnationalist entity and needed a mass organization of their own had been implemented in the organizational practice.

Following the 1967 conference CPI formed &quot;Tripura Rajya Ganamukti Parishad&quot;, led by Aghore Debbarma.

==ATPLO merger==

In 1983 the All Tripura Peoples Liberation Organization of Binanda Jamatya gave up their arms and were integrated into the Ganamukti Parishad. ATPLO had surged as a splinter group of the Tripura National Volunteers, and a turf war between the TNV soon turned into a bloody fight. In the end, ATPLO found no other viable solution than to align with their former enemies and thus merge into GMP.

==The organisation today==
Today the Tripura Rajaer Upajati Ganamukti Parishad is affiliated with the All India Kisan Sabha, the peasant mass-organization of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)). GMP does, however, maintain its own organizational character as an entirely tribal organization. Similarly, as the GMP is an affiliate to the AIKS, the Tribal Youth Federation is affiliated to the Democratic Youth Federation of India and the Tribal Students Union is affiliated to the Students Federation of India. However at the same time as these organizations belong to different all India structures, they are organizationally interlinked. The general secretary and president of TYF are by tradition elected as members of the secretariat of the GMP. The GMP, TYF and TSU use other flags, symbols and publications than their all India bodies. The leadership of these three organizations are referred to as Central Committees, whereas the state leaderships of the AIKS, DYFI and SFI are referred to as State Committees.

By 2000 it claimed a membership of 70 000. It president is Naresh Jamatia and its general secretary is Radhacharan Debbarma.
