<text>The New Democratic Party of Quebec (NPDQ; , NPDQ) is a minor federalist and social-democratic provincial political party in Quebec, Canada. The party is a revival of the comparable New Democratic Party of Quebec, which existed in various forms as the federal New Democratic Party (NDP)&#x27;s provincial section in Quebec from 1963 to 1991. The current party, however, has never been connected with the federal NDP. The modern party was registered on 30 January 2014. The party has announced that, subsequent to a decision taken by its members at a special meeting in November 2024, the party will be dissolving.

==History==
===First iteration===
The original New Democratic Party of Quebec emerged from the Parti social démocratique du Québec, the Quebec section of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation. Aside from briefly electing a single member to the National Assembly (David Côté), it only played a minor role in Quebec provincial politics. During the late 1980s, it came under the leadership of radical sovereigntists, prompting a rupture from the federal NDP. It voted to disaffiliate from the federal party in 1989 and changed its name to the Parti de la democratie socialiste (PDS) in 1994. The PDS would later become a founding member of Québec solidaire, a left-wing provincial party with a sovereigntist platform.

===Second iteration===
For the following two decades, the NDP remained moribund in Quebec; indeed, it was the only province where the NDP was not fully organized. Unlike other national parties in Canada, the NDP is fully integrated with its provincial and territorial branches.

During the 2006 convention of the federal NDP, held in Quebec City, the idea of recreating the provincial NPDQ was brought up. However, the idea failed to win support at the New Democratic Party-Quebec Section&#x27;s convention in November 2006 in Saint-Jérôme. However, gains by the federal party— at first modest with the 2007 by-election in which Tom Mulcair gained the House of Commons seat in Outremont and then dramatic &quot;Orange Surge&quot; of the 2011 Canadian federal election— led to renewed calls for a provincial NDP in Quebec as an alternative to the federalist Quebec Liberal Party and the sovereigntist Parti Quebecois.

On August 17, 2012, federal NDP leader Mulcair announced that, while the NDP was unable to organize for the (then on-going) 2012 election, the NDP intended to run candidates in the next provincial election (then tentatively scheduled for 2016). However, by November 2012, Mulcair had changed his mind, believing that dividing the party&#x27;s efforts between federal and provincial politics would be &quot;extremely perilous.&quot; The president of the Quebec Section, André St-Hilaire, agreed with his concerns, arguing their first priority was electing a federal NDP government.

Nevertheless, NDP activists remained interested in establishing a provincial party. On April 29, 2013, the name &quot;Nouveau Parti démocratique du Québec&quot; was reserved with Élections Québec by Pierre Ducasse, Jack Layton&#x27;s former Quebec lieutenant. Ducasse said it was &quot;not in the plans&quot; to have a structural link to the federal party, and the NDP&#x27;s deputy national director confirmed they were not involved in reserving the name. On January 30, 2014, the New Democratic Party of Quebec was registered as a provincial party with Élections Québec. Ducasse was listed as the party leader. The party did not stand any candidates in the general election later that year.

The first election the NPDQ contested was the October 2, 2017 by-election in Louis-Hébert. Their candidate, former MP Denis Blanchette, placed seventh with 1.35% of the vote.

Interim leader Pierre Ducasse had announced he would not be a candidate in the party&#x27;s 2018 leadership election. The campaign period began on 1 September 2017 and the nomination deadline for leadership candidates was 20 October 2017. On 21 January 2018, the party leadership contest elected Raphaël Fortin was chosen leader.

===2018 campaign: Re-establishing the party===
For the 2018 provincial election, the NPDQ sought to re-establish a presence in the province by running a small campaign that focused on Fortin as leader. Able to run only 59 candidates across the province, the party aimed to influence the discussion and gain attention for a party that had not been present in the province for over two decades. Fortin, speaking with media, said that he had instructed his candidates to not, “look at the final results; look at your campaign and how many people you reach.”

During the campaign, the NPDQ maintained similar policies to those of Québec Solidaire, such as supporting a guaranteed minimum income and universal daycare and post-secondary, though it asserted it was a staunchly federalist party.

Federal New Democratic leader Jagmeet Singh did not endorse the provincial party during the campaign.

==Election results==
The party did not run candidates in the 2022 Quebec general election.

<doc id="797282" wikidata="Q2356484" url="?curid=797282" title="Liquid Snake">
<text>Liquid Snake is a fictional character from the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; franchise. Along with protagonist Solid Snake, he is a product of &quot;Les Enfants Terribles&quot;, a top-secret government project to artificially create soldiers by cloning the legendary soldier Big Boss. He first appears as the main antagonist in the original &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, where he leads the rogue FOXHOUND unit in a hostile takeover of a nuclear disposal facility in Alaska. The character returns in &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain&quot; as a child mercenary nicknamed the White Mamba with his real name revealed to be Eli.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;===

 was raised in the United Kingdom following his birth, and served as an operative for the British SAS and later became the field commander of FOXHOUND during &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, leading Revolver Ocelot, Psycho Mantis, Sniper Wolf, Vulcan Raven, Decoy Octopus and the Genome Soldiers. He leads the hostile takeover of Shadow Moses Island, Alaska to acquire Big Boss&#x27;s remains and use his genetic information to treat the mutations affecting his subordinates, the Genome Army. Liquid harbors a strong resentment towards Solid Snake, as he mistakenly believes that Snake received Big Boss&#x27;s superior genes while he was given only the flawed genes. In reality, it is Liquid who carries superior genes.

Snake first meets Liquid after he is taken captive by the enemy and imprisoned in a medical room. The two battle each other multiple times throughout the story. First, Liquid tries to kill Snake by piloting a Hind D and pursuing him across the Communication Towers but Snake destroys the helicopter with anti-air Stinger missiles. Afterward, Liquid manipulates Snake into activating Metal Gear REX by disguising himself as Master Miller. Snake destroys REX but falls unconscious in the aftermath which allowed Liquid to take his brother to the top of REX&#x27;s ruins and challenge to a fistfight. Snake prevails but Liquid survives again and pursues Snake in a jeep chase that results in a crash outside the island&#x27;s facility. Just as he approaches Snake, Liquid suddenly succumbs to the same FOXDIE virus that had also been injected into Snake. Liquid&#x27;s death leaves Snake in doubt of his own survival, as FOXDIE targets victims based on specific DNA.

===&quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot;===

Liquid&#x27;s presence still had an influence. His right arm was transplanted posthumously as a replacement to Revolver Ocelot. This resulted in Liquid&#x27;s voice and mannerisms to be utilized by Ocelot whenever Solid Snake is nearby, such as when his host is confronted by Snake during the hijacking of Metal Gear RAY from the disguised tanker. The rest of Liquid&#x27;s body was being kept by an unspecified agency until being stolen by Hal Emmerich to fake Snake&#x27;s death. Liquid&#x27;s personality took over Ocelot once again during the climax of Solidus Snake&#x27;s takeover of the Big Shell with the intent of rebelling against The Patriots. Liquid was the one to send Arsenal Gear crashing into Manhattan.

===&quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot;===

Liquid&#x27;s consciousness seemingly takes over his host&#x27;s body as Liquid Ocelot. However, Liquid&#x27;s personality is ultimately revealed to be an elaborate facade by Ocelot made possible through a process of self-hypnosis, in order to trick the Patriots&#x27; AIs. The rest of Liquid&#x27;s remains were used as spare body parts for Big Boss&#x27;s restoration.

===&quot;Metal Gear Solid V&quot;===

Liquid Snake&#x27;s next official appearance is in a prequel. The youth is a 12-year-old child soldier named who fled from his home in England after learning about his nature as a clone. He becomes an active mercenary in the Angola-Zaire border region in Central Africa where he sets up his own mercenary unit consisting entirely of children, nicknamed the or &quot;Nyoka ya Mpembe&quot; due to being the only white child soldier in the region.

Venom Snake first encounters Eli in Masa Village after it is taken over by Eli&#x27;s group. After being subdued, he is taken into Mother Base where the Diamond Dogs staff try to re-educate him and integrate him into normal society along with the other child soldiers. However, Eli resists this treatment and rebels against the Mother Base staff, focusing his hostility on Big Boss&#x27;s body double who is mistaken for his biological father.

When Eli sneaks into a chopper during Snake&#x27;s deployment to OKB Zero in Kabul, he catches the attention of the young psychic known as the Third Child, who uses Eli&#x27;s will to activate Sahelanthropus and attack Snake. After Sahelanthropus is neutralized and transferred to Mother Base, the Third Child infiltrates the place and befriends Eli, giving him a vial containing the English strain of Skull Face&#x27;s vocal cord parasite. The two plot out an elaborate escape plan which involves helping other child soldiers escape and fixing Sahelanthropus with the assistance of its creator Emmerich. Ultimately, Eli succeeds in reactivating Sahelanthropus and hijacks the Metal Gear from Mother Base, escaping alongside the Third Child and the other child mercenaries.

&quot;Kingdom of the Flies&quot; shows Snake pursuing Eli&#x27;s group in an unnamed African island surrounded by saltwater, where the English strain of the vocal cord parasite has been spread to prevent access to adults. Snake confronts Eli and a battle ensues between Sahelanthropus and a battalion of Diamond Dogs soldiers. Eli is defeated but Snake is forced to abandon him when he displays signs of infections, as Eli has lost his immunity to the parasites as a result of undergoing puberty. Before Eli can die, the Third Child arrives and uses his psychic powers to remove the parasite within him. The two youths escape just as Diamond Dogs launches a Napalm airstrike to cleanse the island of the parasites. An image of the Manhattan skyline is seen while Eli vows revenge.

==Concept and design==
===Physical appearance===
Liquid Snake is almost identical to Solid Snake in terms of facial appearance and physique, with the only difference between them being Liquid&#x27;s darker skin tone and medium-length blond hair. He has a tattoo of a snake entwined around a sword on his left arm, with concept art also showing a small piercing on his left ear and dog tags around his neck. For most of &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, Liquid is dressed in a brown trenchcoat but fights shirtless when he confronts Snake at the end of the game. When he disguises himself as Master Miller, he ties his hair in a ponytail and wears a pair of sunglasses, changing the tone of his voice as well. In &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot;, when Liquid possesses Ocelot, his physical appearance changes as well, exposing the surgically attached right arm and letting his hair loose.

Eli in &quot;Metal Gear Solid V&quot; wears a wardrobe similar to his older self, consisting of a green jacket with no shirt and shorts. The back of his jacket has a drawing of a pig with an eye patch meant to resemble Big Boss and the phrase &quot;Never Be Game Over&quot; atop of it. Underneath the pig, the kanji 液体人間 (&quot;ekitai ningen&quot;), which means &quot;liquid person&quot;, can be seen. He carries in his belt a conch, a reference to the novel &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;.

===Casting===
In the original &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, Liquid Snake was voiced by Banjō Ginga in the Japanese version and by Cam Clarke (credited as James Flinders in the PlayStation release) in the English version. Both actors would reprise the role in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot;. Stuntman Mark Musashi provided Liquid Snake&#x27;s motion capture for &quot;Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes&quot;. The character&#x27;s young version in &quot;Metal Gear Solid V&quot; was voiced by Piers Stubbs, who also provided facial capture, while his motion capture was performed by Vincent Giry. Yūtarō Honjō dubbed the character&#x27;s voice for the Japanese version.

==Reception==
In 1999, readers of GameSpot voted Liquid Snake into the list of top ten video game villains. IGN included him in their 2011 list of top 100 video game villains, as number 53. He was ranked as the 16th-coolest video game villain by &quot;Complex&quot; in 2012. GameDaily ranked him ninth on their &quot;Top 25 Evil Masterminds of All Time&quot;. Liquid ranked first on IGN&#x27;s 2008 list of the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series&#x27; top ten villains, also placing as seventh on their list of top ten &quot;Metal Gear&quot; boss battles. &quot;Play&quot; ranked Liquid Snake the fifth-best &quot;Metal Gear&quot; character, adding he &quot;has become one of the most iconic villains of the franchise and is still one of its most popular characters.&quot;

Liquid was included on GamesRadar+ 2008 list of &quot;outrageously camp bad guys&quot; at fifth place, also giving honourable mention on their list of &quot;mega plot twists you never saw coming&quot; to finding out Master Miller is actually Liquid Snake. In 2011, UGO Networks ranked Liquid as the fourth-scariest fictional terrorist in entertainment, also featuring him revealing himself in &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; on the list of the most shocking twists in gaming. In 2012, GamesRadar+ featured both him and Solidus Snake at second place on the list of most evil clones in gaming, commenting that &quot;as evil clones go, the ones that threaten the world with thermonuclear war and eradication rank as some of the worst,&quot; and also listing him and Solid Snake as having one of the best brotherly rivalries in gaming. IGN also remarked their rivalry, saying &quot;Few rivalries in games have spanned as massive and confusing a timeline as Solid Snake and Liquid Snake&quot;.

<text>IgA vasculitis (HSP), previously known as Henoch–Schönlein purpura, is an autoimmune disease that most commonly affects children. In the skin, the disease causes palpable purpura (small, raised areas of bleeding underneath the skin), often with joint pain and abdominal pain. With kidney involvement, there may be a loss of small amounts of blood and protein in the urine (hematuria and proteinuria), but this usually goes unnoticed; in a small proportion of cases, the kidney involvement proceeds to chronic kidney disease. HSP is often preceded by an infection, such as a throat infection.

HSP is a systemic vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels) and is characterized by deposition of immune complexes containing the antibody immunoglobulin A (IgA); the exact cause for this phenomenon is unknown. In children, it usually resolves within several weeks and requires no treatment apart from symptom control but may relapse in a third of cases and cause irreversible kidney damage in about one in a hundred cases. In adults, the prognosis is different from in children. The average duration of cutaneous lesions is 27.9 months. For many, it tends to be relapsing–remitting over a long period of time, rather than self-limiting and there tend to be more complications.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Purpura, arthritis, and abdominal pain are known as the &quot;classic triad&quot; of Henoch–Schönlein purpura. Purpura occur in all cases, joint pains and arthritis in 80%, and abdominal pain in 62%. Some include gastrointestinal hemorrhage as a fourth criterion; this occurs in 33% of cases, sometimes, but not necessarily always, due to intussusception. The purpura typically appear on the legs and buttocks, but may also be seen on the arms, face and trunk. The abdominal pain is colicky in character, and may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea. There may be blood or mucus in the stools. The joints involved tend to be the ankles, knees, and elbows, but arthritis in the hands and feet is possible; the arthritis is nonerosive and hence causes no permanent deformity. Forty percent have evidence of kidney involvement, mainly in the form of hematuria (blood in the urine), but only a quarter will have this in sufficient quantities to be noticeable without laboratory tests. Problems in other organs, such as the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and lungs may occur, but is much less common than in the skin, bowel and kidneys.

Of the 40% of patients who develop kidney involvement, almost all have evidence (visible or on urinalysis) of blood in the urine. More than half also have proteinuria (protein in the urine), which in one eighth is severe enough to cause nephrotic syndrome (generalised swelling due to low protein content of the blood). While abnormalities on urinalysis may continue for a long time, only 1% of all HSP patients develop chronic kidney disease. Hypertension (high blood pressure) may occur. Protein loss and high blood pressure, as well as the features on biopsy of the kidney if performed, may predict progression to advanced kidney disease. Adults are more likely than children to develop advanced kidney disease.

== Pathophysiology ==
Henoch–Schönlein purpura is a small-vessel vasculitis in which complexes of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and complement component 3 (C3) are deposited on arterioles, capillaries, and venules (hence it is a type III hypersensitivity reaction). The activation of the alternative complement pathway results in the deposition of IgA aggregates or IgA complexes in target organs (with deposition of C3). This leads to the production of inflammatory mediators, including vascular prostaglandins like prostacyclin, which may play a key role in the development of IgAV and its organ-specific clinical manifestations. As with IgA nephropathy, serum levels of IgA are high in HSP and there are identical findings on renal biopsy; however, IgA nephropathy has a predilection for young adults while HSP is more predominant among children. Further, IgA nephropathy typically only affects the kidneys while HSP is a systemic disease. HSP involves the skin and connective tissues, scrotum, joints, gastrointestinal tract and kidneys. The genetic basis remains unclear except for involvement of the human leukocyte antigen region of the genome.
It is hypothesized to involve autoimmunity triggered by infections. Streptococcus strains and Parainfluenza virus are the most commonly associated pathogens, and in children Human Parvovirus B19 is a frequent viral trigger

== Diagnosis ==

The diagnosis is based on the combination of the symptoms, as very few other diseases cause the same symptoms together. Blood tests may show elevated creatinine and urea levels (in kidney involvement), raised IgA levels (in about 50%), and raised C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) results; none are specific for Henoch–Schönlein purpura. The platelet count may be raised, and distinguishes it from diseases where low platelets are the cause of the purpura, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

If there is doubt about the cause of the skin lesions, a biopsy of the skin may be performed to distinguish the purpura from other diseases that cause it, such as vasculitis due to cryoglobulinemia; on microscopy, the appearances are of a hypersensitivity vasculitis, and immunofluorescence demonstrates IgA and C3 (a protein of the complement system) in the blood vessel wall. However, overall serum complement levels are normal.

On the basis of symptoms, it is possible to distinguish HSP from hypersensitivity vasculitis (HV). In a series comparing 85 HSP patients with 93 HV patients, five symptoms were found to be indicative of HSP: palpable purpura, abdominal angina, digestive tract hemorrhage (not due to intussussception), hematuria and age less than 20. The presence of three or more of these indicators has an 87% sensitivity for predicting HSP.

Biopsy of the kidney may be performed both to establish the diagnosis or to assess the severity of already suspected kidney disease. The main findings on kidney biopsy are increased cells and Ig deposition in the mesangium (part of the glomerulus, where blood is filtered), white blood cells, and the development of crescents. The changes are indistinguishable from those observed in IgA nephropathy.

HSP can develop after infections with streptococci (β-haemolytic, Lancefield group A), hepatitis B, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, Coxsackievirus, adenovirus, &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;, measles, mumps, rubella, &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; and numerous others. Drugs linked to HSP, usually as an idiosyncratic reaction, include the antibiotics vancomycin and cefuroxime, ACE inhibitors enalapril and captopril, anti-inflammatory agent diclofenac, as well as ranitidine and streptokinase. Several diseases have been reported to be associated with HSP, often without a causative link. Only in about 35% of cases can HSP be traced to any of these causes.

The exact cause of HSP is unknown, but most of its features are due to the deposition of abnormal antibodies in the wall of blood vessels, leading to vasculitis. These antibodies are of the subclass IgA1 in polymers; it is uncertain whether the main cause is overproduction (in the digestive tract or the bone marrow) or decreased removal of abnormal IgA from the circulation. It is suspected that abnormalities in the IgA1 molecule may provide an explanation for its abnormal behaviour in both HSP and the related condition IgA nephropathy. One of the characteristics of IgA1 (and IgD) is the presence of an 18 amino acid-long &quot;hinge region&quot; between complement-fixating regions 1 and 2. Of the amino acids, half is proline, while the others are mainly serine and threonine. The majority of the serines and the threonines have elaborate sugar chains, connected through oxygen atoms (O-glycosylation). This process is thought to stabilise the IgA molecule and make it less prone to proteolysis. The first sugar is always N-acetyl-galactosamine (GalNAc), followed by other galactoses and sialic acid. In HSP and IgAN, these sugar chains appear to be deficient. The exact reason for these abnormalities is not known.

=== Classification ===
Multiple standards exist for defining Henoch–Schönlein purpura, including the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification and the 1994 Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC). Some have reported the ACR criteria to be more sensitive than those of the CHCC.

More recent classifications, the 2006 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and Pediatric Rheumatology Society (PReS) classification, include palpable purpura as a mandatory criterion, together with at least one of the following findings: diffuse abdominal pain, predominant IgA deposition (confirmed on skin biopsy), acute arthritis in any joint, and renal involvement (as evidenced by the presence of blood and/or protein in the urine).

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Henoch–Schönlein purpura may present with an atypical manifestation, which can be confused with papular urticaria, systemic lupus erythematosus, meningococcemia, dermatitis herpetiformis, and acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy.

== Treatment ==
As of 2017, the optimal way to treat Henoch–Schönlein purpura remains controversial. Analgesics may be needed for the abdominal and joint pains. Wound care is warranted if skin death and ulcerations occur. It is uncertain as to whether HSP needs treatment beyond controlling the symptoms. Most people do not receive therapy because of the high spontaneous recovery rate. Experts disagree on whether to routinely use corticosteroids as treatment for HSP. However, if they are given early in the disease episode, the duration of symptoms may be shortened, and abdominal pain can improve significantly. Moreover, the chance of severe kidney problems may be reduced. A systematic review did not find any evidence that steroid treatment (prednisone) is effective at decreasing the likelihood of developing long-term kidney disease.

Evidence of worsening kidney damage would normally prompt a kidney biopsy. Treatment may be indicated on the basis of the appearance of the biopsy sample; various treatments may be used, ranging from steroids by mouth to a combination of intravenous methylprednisolone (steroid), cyclophosphamide and dipyridamole followed by prednisone. Other regimens include steroids/azathioprine, and steroids/cyclophosphamide (with or without heparin and warfarin). Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is occasionally used.

There is no good evidence that treating children who have HSP with antiplatelet agent prevents persistent kidney disease. There is also no evidence that treating children or adults with cyclophosphamide prevents severe kidney disease. Heparin treatment is not justified for people with HSP.

== Prognosis ==
Overall prognosis is good in most patients, with one study showing recovery occurring in 94% and 89% of children and adults, respectively (some having needed treatment). In children under ten, the condition recurs in about a third of all cases, usually within the four months of the initial attack. Recurrence is more common in older children and adults.

=== Kidney involvement ===
In adults, kidney involvement progresses to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) more often than in children. In a UK series of 37 patients, 10 (27%) developed advanced kidney disease. Proteinuria, hypertension at presentation, and pathology features (crescentic changes, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy) predicted progression. About 20% of children that exhibit nephrotic or nephritic features experience long permanent renal impairment.

The findings on renal biopsy correlate with the severity of symptoms: those with asymptomatic hematuria may only have focal mesangial proliferation while those with proteinuria may have marked cellular proliferation or even crescent formation. The number of crescentic glomeruli is an important prognostic factor in determining whether the patient will develop chronic renal disease.

In ESKD, some eventually need hemodialysis or equivalent renal replacement therapy (RRT). If a kidney transplant is found for a patient on RRT, the disease will recur in the graft (transplanted kidney) in about 35% of cases, and in 11%, the graft will fail completely (requiring resumption of the RRT and a further transplant).

== Epidemiology ==
HSP occurs more often in children than in adults, and usually follows an upper respiratory tract infection. Half of affected patients are below the age of six, and 90% are under ten. It occurs about twice as often in boys as in girls. The incidence of HSP in children is about 20 per 100,000 children per year, making it the most common vasculitis in children.

Cases of HSP may occur anytime throughout the year, but some studies have found that fewer cases occur during the summer months.

== History ==

The disease is named after Eduard Heinrich Henoch (1820–1910), a German pediatrician (nephew of Moritz Heinrich Romberg the pioneer of neurology who published his classic textbook between 1840 and 1846 and the first to describe Romberg&#x27;s sign.) and his teacher Johann Lukas Schönlein (1793–1864). Johann Schönlein described the condition as an entity in 1837; Eduard Heinrich Henoch in 1868 reported the first case of a patient with colic, bloody diarrhea, painful joints, and a rash. The English physician William Heberden (1710–1801) and the dermatologist Robert Willan (1757–1812) had already described the disease in 1802 and 1808, respectively, but the name &quot;Heberden–Willan disease&quot; has fallen into disuse. Moreover, Willan was the first to describe an exanthematous rash of childhood known as erythema infectiosum in 1799. In 1920, Eduard Glanzmann(1887-1959), a Swiss pediatrician noted for his contributions in the fields of infectious disease, vitamin therapy and, mostly the field of haematology. He recognised the role of allergy in the pathogenesis of Henoch-Schonlein purpura, hence the understanding of the allergic component in HSP. William Osler is also the first to recognise the underlying allergic mechanism of HSP. In 2012, the International Chapel Hill Consensus Conference Nomenclature of Vasculitides renamed HSP IgA vasculitis. Prior to this, the disease was more often known as Henoch–Schönlein purpura rather than the reverse.

== In popular culture ==
The disease was featured in the TV series &quot;House&quot; in the season 6 episode &quot;Open and Shut&quot;.

<doc id="797291" wikidata="Q2386695" url="?curid=797291" title="Teabagging">
<text>Teabagging is a slang term for the sexual act involving placing the scrotum into the mouth of a sexual partner for sexual pleasure, or onto the face or head of another person, sometimes as a comedic device.

The name of the practice, when it is done in a repeated in-and-out motion, is derived from its passing resemblance to the dipping of a tea bag into a cup of hot water as a method of brewing tea. As a form of non-penetrative sex, it can be done for its own enjoyment or as foreplay.

==Oral sex==

Along with the penis, the scrotum is sensitive and considered to be an erogenous zone. This makes varying degrees of stimulation an integral part of oral sex. And while some may enjoy the stimulation, not everyone responds to it. Sex experts have suggested various techniques that the performer can use during fellatio to increase their partner&#x27;s pleasure. These include gently sucking and tugging on the scrotum and use of lips to ensure minimal contact with their teeth. It has also been recommended as a form of foreplay or safer sex. It presents a low risk of transmission for many diseases, including HIV.

Its gain in prominence has been attributed to its depiction in the 1998 film &quot;Pecker&quot;, directed by John Waters. It has since become popular enough with couples to be discussed during an episode of the television series &quot;Sex and the City&quot;.

Sex and relationship experts have varying definitions on how the act is performed. According to columnist Dan Savage, the person whose scrotum is being stimulated is known as &quot;the teabagger&quot; and the one giving the stimulation is &quot;the teabaggee&quot;: &quot;A teabagger dips sack; a teabaggee receives dipped sack.&quot; Some consider the act to be as simple as fellatio involving the scrotum. Others consider the position to involve the man squatting over his reclined partner while the testicles are repeatedly raised and lowered into the mouth. Whether licking and fondling is considered teabagging was once debated on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;.

==In video games==
Teabagging in video games involves a player character rapidly and repeatedly crouching over the corpse of another player-controlled character as a form of humiliation or to provoke the other player. The practice likely originated from multiplayer communities in games such as &quot;Quake&quot; or &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;, and it became more prominent in later first-person shooter games like &quot;&quot;. The use of teabagging is now widespread in video game culture, although some gamers consider it to be an act of bad sportsmanship or harassment.

The act courted much controversy across June and July 2022 when two professional female &quot;Valorant&quot; players received suspensions by Riot Games for criticizing people who had compared the act to sexual assault. In addition to the suspensions, the players were also doxxed and faced real-world consequences. The suspensions caused outrage in much of the &quot;Valorant&quot; and wider internet community, with various commentators calling the comparison to real-world sexual violence as &quot;out of control&quot; and &quot;absurd&quot;.

The player known as Dawn, who received a three-month suspension for voicing her opinion, said of the situation: &quot;I have watched [sexual assault] happen in broad daylight. It is not something you can compare to crouching in a video game. I was visibly upset by this, as were hundreds of thousands of people, and replied under her thread expressing my frustrations and concerns.&quot;

==Social ridicule and harassment==
Teabagging is not always carried out consensually, such as when it is done as a practical joke, which, in some jurisdictions, is legally considered sexual assault or sexual battery. It has been practiced during hazing or bullying incidents, with reports including groups holding down victims while the perpetrator &quot;shoved his testicles in [the victim&#x27;s] face&quot; or puts his &quot;crotch to his head&quot;.

<doc id="797293" wikidata="Q342910" url="?curid=797293" title="Simon Gray">
<text>Simon James Holliday Gray (21 October 1936 – 7 August 2008) was an English playwright and memoirist who also had a career as a university lecturer in English literature at Queen Mary, University of London, for 20 years. While teaching at Queen Mary, Gray began his writing career as a novelist in 1963 and, during the next 45 years, in addition to five published novels, wrote 40 original stage plays, screenplays, and screen adaptations of his own and others&#x27; works for stage, film and television and became well known for the self-deprecating wit characteristic of several volumes of memoirs or diaries.

==Biography==
Simon James Holliday Gray was born on 21 October 1936 on Hayling Island, in Hampshire, England to James Gray and his wife Barbara (née Holliday). His father, who later became a pathologist, worked on the island as GP. In 1939, during World War II, when he was three years old, Simon and his elder brother Nigel were evacuated to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to live in &quot;a house where his grandfather and [his grandfather&#x27;s] alcoholic wife were attended upon by a younger aunt&quot;; in 1945, when he was nearly 10, he returned to England, where he was educated at Westminster School, in London. In 1957, he received a B.A. from Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia; and, in 1961, another B.A. from Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1965, he was appointed a lecturer in English at Queen Mary College, London.

He married his first wife, Beryl Kevern, in 1965; they had two children, a son, Benjamin, and a daughter, Lucy, and were divorced in 1997. During their marriage, he had an eight-year affair with another Queen Mary lecturer, Victoria Katherine Rothschild (b. 1953), a daughter of Sir Nathaniel Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild; in 1997, after his divorce, they married, living together in west London, until his death.

In 2004 he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire for services to drama and literature.

Suffering from both lung cancer and prostate cancer and related ailments at the time of his death, he died of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, on 7 August 2008, at the age of 71.

==Career==
When he was still in his 20s, he began his writing career as a novelist with &quot;Colmain&quot;, published by Faber and Faber in 1963. His career in drama began when he adapted one of his own short stories, &quot;The Caramel Crisis&quot;, for television. He subsequently wrote a number of plays for, amongst others, &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; and &quot;Play for Today&quot; BBC anthology series, frequently in collaboration with the producer Kenith Trodd. Gray wrote 40 plays and screenplays for the stage, television, and film and eight volumes of memoirs based on his diaries.

&quot;Wise Child&quot;, an adaptation of a TV play deemed too shocking for the small screen, was his first stage play. It starred Simon Ward and Alec Guinness and was produced by Michael Codron at Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre in 1967. Subsequently, he wrote original plays for both radio and television and adaptations, including a TV adaptation of &quot;The Rector’s Daughter&quot;, by F. M. Mayor, and stage adaptations of &quot;Tartuffe&quot; and &quot;The Idiot&quot;. His original television screenplays include &quot;Running Late&quot;, &quot;After Pilkington&quot;, &quot;Unnatural Pursuits&quot;, and &quot;A Month in the Country&quot;. His 1971 play &quot;Butley&quot;, produced by Codron, began a long creative partnership with Harold Pinter as director of both the play and the film versions and continued the partnership with the actor Alan Bates begun with Gray&#x27;s 1967 television play &quot;Death of a Teddy Bear&quot;. In all Bates starred in 11 of Gray&#x27;s works, while Pinter directed 10 separate productions of Gray&#x27;s works for stage, film, and television, beginning with &quot;Butley&quot;. The last one was a stage production of &quot;The Old Masters&quot;, starring Peter Bowles and Edward Fox.

As with &quot;Butley&quot; (1971) and &quot;Otherwise Engaged&quot; (1975), whose London productions and films both starred Bates, and &quot;Quartermaine&#x27;s Terms&quot; (1981), starring Fox, Gray &quot;often returned to the subject of the lives and trials of educated intellectuals.&quot;

He wrote many other successful stage plays, including &quot;The Common Pursuit&quot;, &quot;The Late Middle Classes&quot;, &quot;Hidden Laughter&quot;, &quot;Japes&quot;, &quot;Close of Play&quot;, &quot;The Rear Column&quot;, and &quot;Little Nell&quot;, several of which he directed himself.

In 1984, at the suggestion of Robert McCrum, Faber editor-in-chief at that time, he kept a diary of the London premiere of &quot;The Common Pursuit&quot;, directed by Pinter at the Lyric Hammersmith, resulting in the first of his 8 volumes of theatre-related and personal memoirs, &quot;An Unnatural Pursuit&quot; (Faber 1985), and culminating in the critically acclaimed trilogy entitled &quot;The Smoking Diaries&quot; (Granta, 2004–2008).

Gray&#x27;s play about George Blake, &quot;Cell Mates&quot; (1995), starring Rik Mayall, Stephen Fry and Simon Ward, attracted media attention when Stephen Fry suffered a nervous breakdown and abruptly &quot;fled to Bruges&quot; after the third West End performance, thus leaving the show without its lead actor. Gray subsequently wrote his theatrical memoir &quot;Fat Chance&quot;, providing an account of the episode.

In August 2008, shortly before his death, he attracted further press attention with his criticism of the Royal National Theatre&#x27;s &quot;cowardice&quot; in dealing with the subject of radical Islam.

==Posthumous tributes and related developments==

Gray&#x27;s final volume of diaries, &quot;Coda&quot;, &quot;so named because it rounds off the trilogy of &#x27;Smoking Diaries&#x27; (The Smoking Diaries, The Year of the Jouncer and The Last Cigarette) ... a meditation on death, or rather dying, an account of living on borrowed time,&quot; was published posthumously by Faber and Faber and &quot;Granta&quot; in November 2008. From 8 to 12 December 2008, in five 15-minute episodes, actor Toby Stephens read from this &quot;candid and darkly comic account of coming to terms with terminal cancer&quot; for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Book of the Week&quot;.

&quot;Simon Gray: A Celebration&quot;, directed by Harry Burton, who directed Gray&#x27;s last stage production in Spring 2008 (&quot;Quartermaine&#x27;s Terms&quot; at Theatre Royal, Windsor), was held at the Comedy Theatre, in London, on 15 March 2009.

A production entitled &quot;The Last Cigarette&quot;, based on Gray&#x27;s and Hugh Whitemore&#x27;s adaptation of the three volumes of his memoirs called &quot;The Smoking Diaries&quot; and directed by Richard Eyre, opened at the Minerva Theatre, Chichester, England, in April 2009. The production, with Felicity Kendal, Nicholas Le Prevost, and Jasper Britton, then transferred to the Trafalgar Studios, in London&#x27;s West End,

An official web site was launched in October 2009.

&quot;The Late Middle Classes&quot; finally received its London premiere on 27 May 2010 at the Donmar Warehouse in London, directed by David Leveaux and starring Helen McCrory, Eleanor Bron, Peter Sullivan and Robert Glenister. The original production of the play, directed by Harold Pinter, was prevented from reaching its intended West End theatre by a musical about a boy band. Gray&#x27;s experience of this production is the subject of his diary &quot;Enter a Fox&quot;.

In May–June 2014 &quot;In the Vale of Health&quot;, consisting of three unseen plays and one revival—&quot;Japes&quot;, &quot;Michael&quot;, &quot;Japes Too&quot; and &quot;Missing Dates&quot;—was performed at the Hampstead Theatre, London, directed by Tamara Harvey and starring Gethin Anthony, Jamie Ballard, Imogen Doel, Tom Mothersdale and Laura Rees.

<text>In Tibetan Buddhism and later traditions of mysticism and the paranormal, a tulpa is a materialized being or thought-form, typically in human form, that is created through spiritual practice and intense concentration.
Modern practitioners, who call themselves &quot;tulpamancers&quot;, use the term to refer to a type of willed imaginary friend which practitioners consider to be sentient and relatively independent. Modern practitioners predominantly consider tulpas to be a psychological rather than a paranormal concept. The idea became an important belief in Theosophy.

==Origins==
The concept of tulpas has origins in the Buddhist nirmāṇakāya, translated in Tibetan as (): the earthly bodies that a buddha manifests in order to teach those who have not attained nirvana. The western understanding of tulpas was developed by twentieth-century European mystical explorers, who interpreted the idea independently of buddhahood.

==Theosophy and thought-forms==

20th-century Theosophists adapted the Vajrayana concept of the emanation body into the concepts of &#x27;tulpa&#x27; and &#x27;thoughtform&#x27;. The Theosophist Annie Besant, in the 1905 book &quot;Thought-Forms&quot;, divides them into three classes: forms in the shape of the person who creates them, forms that resemble objects or people and may become ensouled by nature spirits or by the dead, and forms that represent inherent qualities from the astral or mental planes, such as emotions. The term &#x27;thoughtform&#x27; is also used in Evans-Wentz&#x27;s 1927 translation of the &quot;Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot;. The concept is also used in the Western practice of magic. The Slender Man has been described by some people as a tulpa-effect, and attributed to multiple people&#x27;s thought processes.

Occultist William Walker Atkinson in his book &quot;The Human Aura&quot; described thoughtforms as simple ethereal objects emanating from the auras surrounding people, generating from their thoughts and feelings. He further elaborated in &quot;Clairvoyance and Occult Powers&quot; how experienced practitioners of the occult can produce thoughtforms from their auras that serve as astral projections which may or may not look like the person who is projecting them, or as illusions that can only be seen by those with &quot;awakened astral senses&quot;.

===Alexandra David-Néel===
Spiritualist Alexandra David-Néel stated that she had observed Buddhist tulpa creation practices in 20th-century Tibet. She described tulpas as &quot;magic formations generated by a powerful concentration of thought.&quot; David-Néel believed that a tulpa could develop a mind of its own: &quot;Once the tulpa is endowed with enough vitality to be capable of playing the part of a real being, it tends to free itself from its maker&#x27;s control. According to David-Néel, this happens nearly mechanically, just as the child, when her body is completed and able to live apart, leaves its mother&#x27;s womb.&quot; She said she had created such a tulpa in the image of a jolly Friar Tuck-like monk, which she claimed had later developed independent thought and had to be destroyed. David-Néel raised the possibility that her experience was illusory: &quot;I may have created my own hallucination&quot;, though she said others could see the thoughtforms that she created.

==Tulpamancers==
Influenced by depictions in television and cinema from the 1990s and 2000s, the term tulpa started to be used to refer to a type of willed imaginary friend. Practitioners consider tulpas to be sentient and relatively autonomous. Online communities dedicated to tulpas spawned on the 4chan and Reddit websites. These communities refer to tulpa practitioners as &quot;tulpamancers&quot;. The communities gained popularity when adult fans of &quot;My Little Pony&quot; started discussing tulpas of characters from the &quot;My Little Pony&quot; television series. The fans attempted to use meditation and lucid dreaming techniques to create imaginary friends. Surveys by Veissière explored this community&#x27;s demographic, social, and psychological profiles. These practitioners believe a tulpa is a &quot;real or somewhat-real person&quot;. The number of active participants in these online communities is in the low hundreds, and few meetings in person have taken place. They belong to &quot;primarily urban, middle-class, Euro-American adolescent and young adult demographics&quot; and they &quot;cite loneliness and social anxiety as an incentive to pick up the practice&quot;. 93.7% of respondents expressed that their involvement with the creation of tulpas has &quot;made their condition better&quot;, and led to new unusual sensory experiences. Some practitioners have sexual and romantic interactions with their tulpas, though the practice is controversial and trending toward taboo. One survey found that 8.5% support a metaphysical explanation of tulpas, 76.5% support a neurological or psychological explanation, and 14% &quot;other&quot; explanations.

Practitioners believe tulpas are able to communicate with their host in ways they sense do not originate from their own thoughts. Some practitioners report experiencing hallucinations of their tulpas. Practitioners that have hallucinations report being able to see, hear and touch their tulpas.

Veissière&#x27;s survey of 141 respondents found that the rates of neurodivergence including autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was significantly higher among the surveyed tulpamancers than in the general population. He goes on to speculate that people may be more likely to want to make a tulpa because these groups have a higher level of loneliness. Tulpamancers were typically white, articulate, and imaginative and lived in urban areas. A 2022 study found individuals that did not have psychosis who experienced more than one unusual sensory phenomenon, (in this instance autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) and tulpamancy) were found to have greater hallucination-proneness than people that only experienced one of the two sensory phenomenon.

Somer et al. (2021) described the Internet tulpamancer subculture as being used to &quot;overcome loneliness and mental suffering&quot;, and noted the close association with reality shifting (RS), a way of deliberately inducing a form of self-hypnosis in order to escape from current reality into a pre-planned desired reality or &quot;wonderland&quot; of chosen fantasy characters.

<doc id="797296" wikidata="Q6857903" url="?curid=797296" title="Militia Act of 1855">
<text>The &quot;Militia Act&quot; of 1855 was an Act passed by the Parliament of the Province of Canada that permitted the formation of an &quot;Active Militia&quot;, which was later subdivided into the Permanent Active Militia and the Non-Permanent Active Militia, and divided the province into 18 military districts. 

== History ==
Assisted by volunteer staff officers, each district was commanded by a colonel, while the entire operation was led by Colonel Étienne-Paschal Taché. Trained at the expense of taxpayers, the volunteers were armed, equipped and paid 5 shillings a day for 10 days of training a year (20 days for those in the artillery), with captains being paid 10 shillings 6 pence a day, however, the men had to provide their own uniforms. Initially set at 5,000 men, the Act&#x27;s popularity forced the government to double its size to 10,000 men by 1856. 

By 1858, enthusiasm waned when economic depression occupied the minds of Canadians. In 1860, military spirit was revived by the royal visit of the Prince of Wales. Canadians, Nova Scotians, and New Brunswickers launched their own volunteer units. These companies began to form into battalions that gradually eclipsed the Sedentary Militia. In 1864, the Sedentary Militia was re-styled as the &quot;Non-Service Militia&quot;, and in 1869, its battalions were reduced to the &quot;Reserve Militia&quot; of each county. The Reserve Militia was last enrolled in 1873 (but never called out), deferred thereafter, and the theory that every able-bodied man was liable for service was finally abolished in 1950.

Exemption from military service: &quot;Every person bearing a certificate from the Society of Quakers, Mennonites or Tunkers, or any inhabitant of Canada, of any religious denomination, otherwise subject to military duty, but who, from the doctrine of religion, is averse to bearing arms and refuses personal military service, shall be exempt from such service when balloted in time of peace, or war, upon such conditions and under such regulations as the Governor in Council, may, from time to time, prescribe.&quot; From 1869 to World War I, several orders in council were issued providing &quot;entire exemption&quot; for religious groups that the Canadian government was encouraging to immigrate to Canada. These were Mennonites from Russia (1873), Doukhobors (1898) and Hutterites (1899).

==Ministers responsible==

* Minister of Militia and Defence (non British Army units up to 1906) for the Province of Canada 1855 to 1867
* Minister of Militia and Defence 1867 to 1923
* Minister of National Defence 1923 to 1940

After 1940, the Militia became the Canadian Army with Active or Regular Forces and Reserve.

<doc id="797297" wikidata="Q497298" url="?curid=797297" title="Talulah Gosh">
<text>Talulah Gosh were an English guitar-pop group from Oxford, and one of the leading bands of the indiepop movement, taking their name from the headline of an NME interview with Clare Grogan. They supposedly formed in 1986 when Amelia Fletcher and Elizabeth Price, both wearing Pastels badges, met at a club in Oxford. Their original line-up comprised Amelia Fletcher (vocals, guitar, principal songwriter), her younger brother Mathew Fletcher (drums), Peter Momtchiloff (lead guitar), Rob Pursey (bass) and Elizabeth Price (vocals). Pursey left early on, to be replaced by Chris Scott.

==History==
The group made their live debut on 7 March 1986, and later the same year released a flexidisc on Sha La La flexilabel and two singles simultaneously on the Edinburgh-based label 53rd &amp; 3rd, &quot;Beatnik Boy&quot; and &quot;Steaming Train&quot;. These singles, especially the former, were unashamedly cutesy, something also reflected in the names the group had adopted for themselves: leader Amelia was &quot;Marigold&quot;, while Elizabeth became &quot;Pebbles&quot;. Mathew Fletcher was rather less flatteringly nicknamed &quot;Fat Mat&quot;. Their appearance led to them being labelled as an &quot;anorak indie&quot; band.

For their third single, the group returned to a song they had first recorded in session for Janice Long&#x27;s show on Radio 1 in August 1986, &quot;Talulah Gosh&quot;. Elizabeth Price left toward the end of the year to form The Carousel with Razorcuts frontman Gregory Webster, and so the single, released on 30 May 1987, was the first to feature replacement Eithne Farry (vocals, tambourine). The single was less shambolic than their earlier offerings, and a video was made for it which was played on &quot;The Chart Show&quot; (then shown on Channel 4), giving the band some mainstream exposure. The single was produced (some critics suggested it was over-produced) by John Rivers, as was the follow-up &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot;, a sophisticated pop song that reduced the band&#x27;s &quot;shambling&quot; element to the point where mainstream success seemed a possibility. Indeed, The Primitives would later take precisely this route to success – but Talulah Gosh never made the national chart. The ironically-titled debut (compilation) album &quot;Rock Legends: Volume 69&quot; was released in October 1987, collecting tracks from the earlier singles and radio sessions.

January 1988 saw not only the release of &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; but also the broadcast of a second Radio 1 session, this time for DJ John Peel. What was to be Talulah Gosh&#x27;s last single, a punk thrash titled &quot;Testcard Girl&quot; (very loosely based on an old Heinz advertising jingle), was released in May. The group split later that year. A posthumous collection of BBC radio sessions was issued by Sarah Records in 1991, and a more comprehensive retrospective was released on K Records in 1996. A limited edition EP of demos, recorded in 1986, was issued for Record Store Day in 2011, at which point a new retrospective album was also announced, at that time to be called &quot;Grrrr&quot;. On 22 July 2013, Amelia Fletcher announced on her Facebook page that the album, now called &quot;Was It Just a Dream?&quot;, would be released in October 2013. It was launched along with a DJ set by Amelia Fletcher, Eithne Farry and Elizabeth Price at the London club Scared To Dance.

After the split, Peter joined Razorcuts, while Amelia issued a one-off solo single, &quot;Can You Keep a Secret?&quot;. Amelia and Mathew Fletcher and Peter Momtchiloff regrouped as Heavenly in late 1989, with Talulah Gosh co-founder Rob Pursey also returning to the fold. Following the break-up of Razorcuts, Scott formed Saturn V with Gregory Webster and Razorcuts drummer Struan Robertson.

<doc id="797298" wikidata="Q83680" url="?curid=797298" title="Sher Shah Suri">
<text>Sher Shah Suri (Farid al-Din Khan; 1472 or 1486 – 22 May 1545), also known by his title Sultan Adil (), was the ruler of Bihar from 1530 to 1540, and Sultan of Hindustan from 1540 until his death in 1545. He defeated the Mughal Empire, founding the Sur Empire and establishing his rule in Delhi. The influence of his innovations and reforms extended far beyond his brief reign, being recognized as one of the greatest administrative rulers in India. During his time in power, he remained undefeated in battle and is renowned as one of the most skillful Afghan generals in history. By the end of his reign, his empire covered nearly all of Northern India.

Born between 1472 and 1486 and given the name Farid Khan, his early childhood saw him flee from home due to internal family strife. He pursued an education in Jaunpur, where his rise to power began after his father offered him a managerial position over his jagirs. Sher Shah effectively governed these territories, gaining a reputation for his reforms that brought prosperity to the region. However, due to family intrigues, he eventually relinquished his position over the jagirs. Sher Shah then moved to Agra, where he stayed until his father&#x27;s death. This event allowed him to return to his family&#x27;s jagirs and take control, thereby solidifying his leadership and furthering his rise to power.

Sher Shah spent time in Agra after the Mughals gained power, observing the leadership of Babur. After leaving Agra, he entered the service of the governor of Bihar. Following the governor&#x27;s death in 1528, Sher Shah obtained a high position in Bihar and, by 1530, became the regent and de facto ruler of the kingdom. He engaged in conflicts with the local nobility and the Sultanate of Bengal. In 1538, while Mughal Emperor Humayun was engaged in military campaigns elsewhere, Sher Shah overran the Bengal Sultanate and established the Suri dynasty. He defeated the Mughals and drove them out of India, establishing himself as emperor in Delhi. As ruler of Hindustan, Sher Shah led numerous military campaigns, conquering Punjab, Malwa, Marwar, Mewar, and Bundelkhand. A brilliant strategist, Sher Shah was both a gifted administrator and a capable general. His reorganization of the empire and strategic innovations laid the foundations for future Mughal emperors, notably Akbar. Sher Shah died in May 1545 while besieging Kalinjar fort. Following his death, the empire descended into civil war until it was eventually re-conquered by the Mughals.

During his rule as Emperor of the Sur Empire, Sher Shah implemented numerous economic, administrative, and military reforms. He issued the first Rupiya, organized the postal system of the Indian subcontinent, as well as extending the Grand Trunk Road from Chittagong in Bengal to Kabul in Afghanistan, significantly improving trade. Sher Shah further developed Humayun&#x27;s Dina-panah city, renaming it Shergarh, and revived the historical city of Pataliputra, which had been in decline since the 7th century CE, as Patna. Additionally, he embarked on several military campaigns that restored Afghan prominence in India.

==Name and title==
His birth name was Farid Khan. After 1526, he was conferred the title Sher Khan, and following his ascension as Sultan of Hindustan in 1540, he became known as Sher Shah.

His surname &#x27;Suri&#x27; was taken from his Pashtun Sur tribe. He was a distant kinsman to Babur&#x27;s brother-in-law, Mir Shah Jamal, who remained loyal to Humayun. The name &quot;Sher&quot; (means &quot;lion&quot; in Persian) was conferred upon him for his courage when, as a young man, he killed a tiger that leapt suddenly upon the governor of Bihar, Behar Khan Lohani.

==Early life and origin (1472/1486–1497)==
Sher Shah was born in Sasaram, located in present-day Bihar, India. His birthdate is disputed, with some accounts stating he was born in 1472, while others claim 1486. He was of Pashtun Afghan origin, belonging to the Sur clan.

Sher Shah&#x27;s grandfather, Ibrahim Khan Sur, began his career as a horse trader and eventually became a landlord (Jagirdar) in the Narnaul area of present-day Haryana. He represented his patron, Jamal Khan Lodi Sarangkhani, who assigned him several villages in Hissar Firoza. Sher Shah&#x27;s father, Hasan Khan Sur, entered the service of Jamal Khan. In 1494, Jamal Khan was promoted and established in Bihar by Sikandar Khan Lodi. At Jamal Khan&#x27;s request, Sikandar granted Hasan the jagirs of Khwaspur, Sasaram, and Hajipur in Bihar.

Hasan had several wives and fathered over eight sons, with Nizam Khan being Sher Shah&#x27;s only full brother. One of Sher Shah&#x27;s stepmothers was cruel to him, and Hasan, being too submissive to his wife, was unable to intervene. As a result, Sher Shah sought refuge with Jamal Khan, aiming to gain experience and further his education.

Sher Shah pursued his education in Jaunpur for several years, studying subjects such as history and religion. On one occasion, Hasan visited Jamal Khan in Jaunpur and encountered some of Sher Shah&#x27;s relatives, who spoke of Sher Shah&#x27;s potential for future greatness. Impressed by these accounts, Hasan invited Sher Shah to manage his domains in 1497.

===Rise to power (1497–1528)===

Sher Shah accepted his father&#x27;s offer and embarked on implementing numerous reforms. His early administrative career focused on combating corruption. One of Sher Shah&#x27;s significant reforms as administrator of his father&#x27;s domains was the assessment of land revenues, along with defining and establishing commissions for tax collectors. However, despite these reforms, Sher Shah faced resentment and intrigue from his stepmother, who had initially forced him to flee, and his step-brothers. This opposition eventually led to Sher Shah resigning from his post in 1518, after serving as manager for 21 years. Following his resignation, he initially engaged in banditry before departing for Agra, which was under the rule of the Lodi dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate.

Sher Shah remained in Agra until his father&#x27;s death, after which he received his father&#x27;s jagirs from Sultan Ibrahim Khan Lodi. Returning to his jagirs in 1520–21, Sher Shah began administering them while in the service of Behar Khan Lohani. Conflict emerged however over the split of his father&#x27;s land between his brothers, and Muhammad Khan Sur initially drove Sher Shah from the estate by defeating one of his governors. In 1526, the Lodis were overthrown, bringing the Mughals to power under Babur. During this time, Behar Khan Lohani established an independent state in Bihar and assumed the title of Sultan Muhammad. With the aid of Junaid Khan, the Mughal governor of Jaunpur, Sher Shah joined Mughal service. In April 1527, after Babur launched a campaign against the Afghans in Bihar, Sher Shah distinguished himself, and his estates were restored in 1528. 

With his jagirs secured, Sher Shah accompanied Junaid Khan to Agra, where he met Mughal Emperor Babur. During this time, Sher Shah was conferred the title of Sher Khan after killing a tiger that leapt upon the ruler of Bihar. Sher Shah remained in Agra, observing Mughal military organization and administration.

Once, while dining with Mughal Emperor Babur, Sher Shah encountered a dish he was unfamiliar with eating. In response, he drew his dagger, cut the dish into smaller pieces, and then ate it with a spoon. Babur took notice and informed his minister, Mir Khalifa:

Suspecting a rising plot against him, Sher Shah departed Agra and left Mughal service, returning to his Jagirs in 1528. He sought refuge under the protection of Sultan Muhammad of Bihar. Upon Sher Shah&#x27;s arrival, he was warmly received and appointed as the guardian of Muhammad&#x27;s son, Jalal Khan.

==Reign in Bihar (1528–1538/1540)==
In October 1528, Sultan Mohammad of Bihar died, and his queen, Dudu Bibi, assumed the role of regent. Sher Shah was appointed as her deputy governor, allowing him to begin consolidating his position in the region through a myriad of military and administrative reforms. These reforms significantly strengthened his position, making him one of the most influential Afghan leaders in India.

In 1529, Sher Shah anticipated joining Mahmud Lodi, the younger brother of Ibrahim Lodi, in his insurrection against the Mughals that rallied most of the significant Afghan leaders in India. Sher Shah, however, recognized the division among the Afghans and Mahmud&#x27;s incompetence, thus refusing to aid Mahmud. Intending for the unification of all Afghan leaders, Mahmud marched with his army to Sasaram, persuading Sher Shah to join the rebellion. Hesitatingly, Sher Shah accompanied the expedition with his own set of men, and the insurrection initially succeeded, capturing Ghazipur and Banaras. However, upon the arrival of Mughal forces, Mahmud Lodi abandoned the army. After this, many Afghan nobles including Sher Shah submitted to Babur. In early 1530, the death of Dudu Bibi enabled Sher Shah to become the regent for Jalal Khan, effectively making him the de facto ruler of Bihar.

Despite his growing power, many of the Lohani nobles opposed Sher Shah&#x27;s dominance. Although he offered to share power, the Lohani nobles rejected his proposal and instead fled to Bengal with Jalal Khan, seeking the support of Nasiruddin Nasrat Shah, the ruler of the Bengal Sultanate. Consequently, Sher Shah became the sole ruler of Bihar. However, he did not adopt any grand titles, preferring to style himself as Hazrat-i-Ala.

===Acquisition of Chunar (1530)===

Taj Khan, the governor of Chunar, was assassinated by his stepson. In the aftermath, his wealthy widow, Lad Malika, sought a protector to secure her position. Recognizing Sher Shah&#x27;s growing influence, she agreed to marry him. Through these negotiations, which were kept secret from Taj Khan&#x27;s sons, Sher Shah gained control of Chunar. This acquisition significantly bolstered Sher Shah&#x27;s power and influence in the region, as he now controlled a significant fort and a large treasury.

===First conflict with the Mughals (1530–1532)===

The death of Mughal Emperor Babur in December 1530 saw the Afghan insurrection rejuvenated, and Mahmud Lodi again returned. Sher Shah immediately ignored Mahmud&#x27;s attempts of garnering Sher Shah&#x27;s aid until he was promised all of Southern Bihar. After further being visited by Mahmud, Sher Shah acquiesced. The combined Afghan forces marched on Banaras and Jaunpur, with Junaid Khan withdrawing to Agra. The Afghan forces followed up their victories by seizing Lucknow.

Humayun, entrenched in a siege of Kalinjar, immediately withdrew, crossing the Ganges and began a battle against Mahmud Lodi at Dadrah in 1531. The Afghan forces were decisively defeated, and the coalition was shattered. Mahmud Lodi fled to Orrisa, while Sher Shah emerged on top by keeping Southern Bihar.

Humayun followed up his victory by besieging Chunar, a fortress owned by Sher Shah, in September 1532. The siege continued for over four months to no avail. In order to make peace, Sher Shah offered his loyalty to the Mughals on the condition that he remained in control of Chunar, offering to send his third son, Qutb Khan, as hostage. Humayun accepted and lifted the siege in December 1532, returning to Agra due to the rising threat of Bahadur Shah, the ruler of the Gujarat Sultanate. Humayun did not wish to split up his forces under the command of a noble to continue the siege, as this would split his strength, additionally giving reason for peace to be established.

===Lohani conflict and Bengal campaign (1533–1537)===

Makhdum Alam, the administrator of Hajipur, refused to recognize Ghiyasuddin Mahmud Shah as the Sultan of Bengal, accusing him of assassinating the previous Sultan, Alauddin Firuz. He formed an alliance with Sher Shah, who saw this as an opportunity to crush the power of the Lohani nobles allied with Mahmud Shah. Mahmud Shah sent several expeditions against Sher Shah, which were all defeated. Makhdum Alam however, was killed, and his estates fell to Sher Shah upon his death. In 1534, Mahmud Shah sent an army of artillery, cavalry and infantry under Ibrahim Khan to conquer Bihar, with Jalal Khan accompanying the campaign. However, Sher Shah launched a sudden attack on the combined forces of the Lohani chiefs of Bihar and Mahmud Shah of Bengal, defeating them at Surajgarh in March 1534, winning a decisive victory. Ibrahim Khan was killed admist the battle, and Jalal Khan was forced to retreat to Bengal. Following the victory, Sher Shah consolidated his control over Bihar.

Between 1536 and 1537, Sher Shah followed up his victories by invading Bengal and defeating Mahmud Shah numerous times, occupying all lands west of the Teliagarhi pass. Mahmud Shah repeatedly requested the Portuguese to aid him, which they did by fortifying the Teliaghari and Sakrigali passes. Sher Shah, however, out-flanked the combined armies and reached Gauda by way of Jharkhand. Mahmud Shah immediately capitulated, and was forced to pay over 13,000,000 gold coins, and cede territory up to Sakrigali.

===Second Bengal campaign and conflict with the Mughals (1537–1540)===
Eager to conquer the Bengal Sultanate, Sher Shah prepared for another invasion, and an opportunity came when Mahmud Shah failed to send annual tribute, forcing him to seek refuge in Gaur and frantically ask Humayun for aid. In response, Humayun mobilized a Mughal army in July 1537, and advanced towards Chunar. The Mughals reached the fort in November 1537 and laid siege to it. The siege lasted over six months before the fort finally fell. Following this, Sher Shah began a second invasion into Bengal, seizing Rohtasgarh in March 1538 through stratagem. He used Rohtasgarh to situate Afghan families and loot he obtained during the war. Following up his victory, Sher Shah besieged Gauda, which fell in April 1538. Split detachments would also be sent to conquer Chittagong. Another force battled against Mahmud Shah led by Khawas Khan Marwat, a general of Sher Shah, which saw Mahmud Shah decisively defeated and mortally wounded. With these victories, Sher Shah held his first coronation. 

After the fall of Gauda, Sher Shah offered favorable peace terms to Humayun, proposing to pay 10,000,000 dinars, and cede Bihar in exchange for control of Bengal. Humayun refused the offer, not wishing to leave Bengal&#x27;s rich resources to a hostile state. Additionally, the wounded Mahmud Shah, who had entered Humayun&#x27;s camp, urged him to continue the war against Sher Shah. Mahmud Shah died from his wounds soon after.

Following this, Humayun marched towards Bengal to confront Sher Shah. However, the Mughal army was troubled with heavy rains, causing the loss of their baggage between Patna and Monghyr. Humayun eventually reached Gauda and seized it without opposition on 8 September 1538. However, the city had been abandoned by the Afghans, and the treasury looted. Humayun remained in Gauda for months, restoring order to the city, as he was trapped with his army due to the weather. Sher Shah capitalized on this, seizing Bihar and Varanasi, reclaiming control over Chunar, and laying siege to Jaunpur. Other detachments of the Afghan army extended as far as Kannauj. As a result, Humayun found himself effectively stranded in Gauda with no lines of communication. Learning of unrest in Agra, Humayun immediately sought to settle for peace with Sher Shah. However, as he crossed the Karmanasa River, where his army was vulnerable to attack, Sher Shah capitalized on the Mughal army&#x27;s fragile state and attacked at the Battle of Chausa. The Afghans descended on the Mughal army, which was 200,000 strong. Overwhelmed, the Mughal army was completely routed. Humayun barely escaped with his life, with the Mughals suffering over 7,000 casualties, including many prominent noblemen.

With his defeat, Humayun returned to Agra, and restored order after unrest began due to his brother, Hindal Mirza. Humayun then began mobilizing another army and advanced against Sher Shah, who raised his own army, although being numerically inferior. The two armies met at Kannuaj, mirroring each other across the Ganges river. Humayun crossed the river and engaged in skirmishes with Sher Shah&#x27;s forces. During the fighting, many of Humayun&#x27;s nobles hid their insignia to avoid recognition by the Afghans, and several fled the battle. The Mughal army was ultimately defeated, forcing Humayun to flee. Following this victory, Sher Shah was crowned a second time on 17 May 1540, being declared the ruler of Hindustan and adopting the epithet Sultan Adil, meaning &quot;Just King.&quot; He further took on the name Sher Shah.

==Reign as Sur emperor (1540–1545)==
===Consolidation and Punjab campaign (1540–1542)===
As Humayun fled, Sher Shah pursued him with split detachments. He then seized Agra, defeating the Mughals there, and sent Khawas in pursuit of Humayun. The pursuit and flight of Humayun allowed Sher Shah to capture and enter Delhi, beginning the consolidation of his rule there by reorganizing its administration. As Humayun reached Lahore in July 1540, the Afghans were at Sultanpur Lodhi. With the approach of the Afghans, the Mughals fled Lahore. At Khushab, Humayun and Kamran quarreled and parted ways, with Humayun leaving for Sindh, and Kamran to Kabul.

As Humayun began withdrawing, Khawas Khan initially gave up the pursuit, halting on the Jhelum river. Sher Shah then advanced from Sirhind toward Lahore, and then continued toward the Chenab river before arriving at Khushab. At Khushab, Sher Shah sent two detachments under Khawas Khan and Qutb Khan to pursue Humayun and his contingent out of the region. The pursuit continued as far as the Panjnad River before withdrawing back to Khushab and merging with Sher Shah&#x27;s force.

Remaining encamped at Khushab, Sher Shah received the submission of Baloch chiefs, including prominently Ismail Khan, Fateh Khan, Ghazi Khan, and many others who ruled the region between the Chenab and the Indus rivers. Sher Shah then entered into conflict with the Gakhars, who had historically been difficult to subjugate despite attempts by previous rulers. Sher Shah initially attempted diplomacy, inviting the Gakhar chief to acknowledge him as the emperor of India. However, the Gakhar gave an insulting response, which enraged Sher Shah. In retaliation, Sher Shah marched through Punjab, subjugating the Gakhars, devastating much of the countryside, and taking many prisoners. To further secure his rule, Sher Shah established Rohtas Fort and stationed 50,000 men in Punjab under his generals Haibat Khan Niazi and Khawas Khan Marwat. Subsequently, Sher Shah turned his attention to Bengal, where the governor he had appointed had become rebellious.

===Reforms in Bengal (1541)===
Recognizing the importance of Bengal, Sher Shah focused much of his administrative efforts in the region. In March 1541, Khijir Khan, the governor of Bengal under Sher Shah, led a revolt, as well as marrying a daughter of the former Sultan, Mahmud Shah. Sher Shah mobilized an army and personally led it to defeat Khijir Khan, restoring Bengal to his suzerainty. He then divided Bengal into 47 smaller administrative divisions, each overseen by a shiqdar, with Kazi Fajilot established as the chief supervisor of the Muqtars. These reforms increased the prominence of Afghans in Bengal, leading many to settle in the region. Some of these Afghan settlers later established the Muhammad Shahi dynasty, which ruled Bengal from 1553 to 1563, and the Karrani dynasty, which ruled from 1563 to 1576.

===Conquest and consolidation of Malwa (1542)===
In 1542, Sher Shah embarked on a campaign to Malwa. Qadir Khan, the ruler of the Malwa Sultanate, had offended Sher Shah by claiming he was equal to him, as well as failing pledged aid against the Mughals. Upon arriving in Gwalior, the governor of the city submitted to the Afghans. The Afghan army continued their march to Sarangpur. Believing defeat was imminent, Qadir Khan left Ujjain and awaited at Sarangpur for Sher Shah&#x27;s arrival. Sher Shah received him, and they together advanced into Ujjain. Sher Shah then made Qadir Khan the governor of Gauda. However, suspicious of Sher Shah&#x27;s intentions, Qadir Khan fled to Gujarat, leaving Malwa annexed to Sher Shah&#x27;s domain.

Sher Shah consolidated his new territories before returning to Agra, also receiving submission from the ruler of Ranthambore. Shujaat Khan was appointed as the new governor of Malwa, with further attempts from Qadir Khan to reclaim Malwa ending in failure against Shujaat Khan.

===Conquest of Raisen (1543)===

After the death of Bahadur Shah of Gujarat, Puran Mal regained control of Raisen, which had been annexed by Bahadur Shah in 1532. Following the re-capture of the city, Puran Mal was accused of committing tyrannies unto the Muslim populace, which Puran Mal denied. After assembling an army, the Rajputs, facing defeat, surrendered under the promise of safe conduct. Puran Mal withdrew from the fort with 4,000 Rajputs, including their families. However, after being ill-advised by fanatic Muslims, as well as Muslim widows appealing to him after allegedly suffering under Puran Mal&#x27;s rule, Sher Shah gave permission for the Afghan army to attack the Rajputs while they were still leaving the fort. The Rajputs killed their women and children before engaging in battle with the Afghans, before being defeated as the Afghans massacred them. This act is considered the darkest mark on Sher Shah&#x27;s reign.

===Conquest of Marwar (1543–1544)===
Having initially attempted to aid Humayun in regaining his throne, as well as having failed to capture Humayun for Sher Shah, and Marwar itself being a formidable kingdom and threat to his rule, Sher Shah began preparing for war in August 1542.

In early 1543, Sher Shah Suri, with a force of 80,000 cavalry, set out against Maldeo Rathore, the Rajput king of Marwar. The Afghan army advanced through Merta before Maldeo advanced with his own army of 50,000 to face Sher Shah, which had halted in the village of Sammel in the pargana of Jaitaran, near Jodhpur. Establishing defenses, Sher Shah&#x27;s strong position made it difficult for Maldeo to launch an attack, while Sher Shah&#x27;s position became dangerous due to supply difficulties for his large army. Sher Shah thus resorted to intrigue by dropping forged letters near Maldeo&#x27;s camp, falsely indicating that some of his commanders intended to defect to the Afghans. This caused great distress to Maldeo, leading him to abandon his commanders and retreat to Jodhpur with his men.

Maldeo&#x27;s generals, Jaita and Kumpa, split off a contingent of 12,000 men to fight against the Afghans. In the resulting Battle of Sammel, Sher Shah emerged victorious. Following the victory, Khawas Khan Marwat took possession of Jodhpur and occupied the territory of Marwar from Ajmer to Mount Abu in 1544, with Bikaner also submitting to Afghan rule. Maldeo was initially forced to retreat to Siwana, however after the death of Sher Shah he was able to recapture Jodhpur by July 1545 and the rest of his territories by 1546. In doing so he had to defeat the chain of garrisons that had been posted by Sher Shah before his death.

==Death (1545)==
Following the conquest of Marwar, Sher Shah besieged Kalinjar Fort in 1544. Due to continuous resistance from the Rajputs, he besieged the fort for seven months. The circumstances regarding Sher Shah&#x27;s death are uncertain. Some sources state that he was mortally wounded by a gunpowder explosion when one of his cannons burst. Another account suggests that during a battle, as he descended from a rampart and ordered his men to hurl bombs into the fort, one bomb fell back and hit a cache of bombs, causing a large explosion. Some people escaped with minor burns, while Sher Shah was found half-burned and taken to his tent, where he remained for two days. Despite his critical condition, he ordered his men to swarm the fort, advancing close to the fort with his troops. Upon hearing that the fort had finally fallen, he remarked, &quot;Thanks to Almighty god.&quot; Sher Shah succumbed to his wounds and died on 22 May 1545, at the age of 73 or 59.
At the end of his reign, Sher Shah&#x27;s empire spanned nearly the entirety of Northern India, excluding Assam, Kashmir, Gujarat, and the North-West Frontier Province. Sher Shah&#x27;s heir apparent was his eldest son, Adil Khan. However, Jalal Khan was more favored by the nobility and seen as more experienced. As a result, Jalal Khan was invited by the nobility to be crowned, becoming Sher Shah&#x27;s successor, and taking the regnal name Islam Shah Suri. Sher Shah was buried in the tomb of Sher Shah Suri, which stands in the middle of an artificial lake at Sasaram, a town on the Grand Trunk Road. The tomb finished its construction on 16 August 1545, three months after his death.

Hermann Goetz posited that one of the motivations for Sher Shah choosing his birthplace, Sasaram, as the site of his tomb, was that:

Decades after his death, the Tarikh-i-Sher Shahi was commissioned by Akbar to detail the reign of Sher Shah. Written by Abbas Sarwani, the source was significant toward detailing the conquest of Bengal by Sher Shah as well as the magnitude of his reforms, and greatly benefited in contribution towards the history of medieval India.

==Children and succession==

Sher Shah had two surviving sons upon his death, Jalal Khan (known as Islam Shah Suri), and Adil Khan. Conflict emerged after Sher Shah&#x27;s death and Islam Shah was victorious after a battle at Agra, with Adil Khan fleeing and his fate unknown. Islam Shah would rule until his death in 1553, being succeeded by his minor son, Firuz Shah Suri who was assassinated by Muhammad Adil Shah, a nephew of Sher Shah from his full brother, Nizam Khan. 

The turbulence of succession and the instability afterward in the reign of Adil Shah unraveled the Sur Empire, including the rise of many military adventurers such as Taj Khan Karrani in Bihar, Ibrahim Shah Suri in Bayana, Sikandar Shah Suri in Lahore, and Muhammad Khan Sur in Bengal.

Initially having aborted an attempt against Islam Shah in 1553, Humayun returned to invade India. Capitalizing off of the instability to invade the Punjab, Mughal forces seized Lahore without opposition due to the civil war, and Afghan forces were defeated at Machhiwara. Sikander Shah attempted to give battle to Humayun at Sirhind before being defeated as well, allowing the Mughals to re-occupy Delhi.

==Legacy and reforms==
===Currency===

The system of tri-metalism that came to characterize Mughal coinage was introduced by Sher Shah. While the term &quot;rūpya&quot; had previously been used as a generic term for any silver coin, during his rule the term &quot;rūpee&quot; came to be used as the name for a silver coin of a standard weight of 178 grains, which was the precursor of the modern rupee. The &quot;Rupee&quot; is today used as the national currency in India, Indonesia, the Maldives, Mauritius, Nepal, Pakistan, the Seychelles, and Sri Lanka. Gold coins called the &quot;Mohur&quot; weighing 169 grains and copper coins called Paisa were also minted during his reign. According to numismatists Goron and Goenka, it is clear from coins dated AH 945 (1538 AD) that Sher Shah had assumed the royal title of Farid al-Din Sher Shah and had coins struck in his own name prior to the battle of Chausa.

===Provincial and local administration===
Historians widely acclaim Sher Shah for his administrative ability, being referred to as one of the greatest Administrators in India. Some of his reforms took off the institutions of Alauddin Khalji. The Sur Empire was divided into many subdivisions called Iqtas, which were often ruled by military governors. Haibat Khan, who governed the Punjab, commanded over 30,000 men and could distribute jagirs to his soldiers. Khawas Khan, another military governor, ruled over Rajasthan with a force of over 20,000 men. The heads of Iqtas were known by various titles such as Hakim, Faujdar, or Momin and typically commanded bodies of men usually numbering less than 5,000. Their responsibilities included maintaining order and enforcing law within their jurisdictions.

Iqtas were further divided into districts known as Sarkars, each overseen by two chief officers: the Shiqar and the Munsif. The Shiqar was responsible for civil administration and could field 200–300 soldiers to maintain law and order. The Munsif handled revenue collection and civil justice, while chief Shiqars often dealt with criminal justice cases.

Sarkars were in turn divided into smaller units called Parganas, which consisted of a town and its surrounding villages. Each Pargana had a Shiqar, a Munsif, a Fotdar (treasurer), and a Karkun (clerk) proficient in Hindi and Persian. The Shiqar of a Pargana was a military officer under the Sarkar&#x27;s Shiqar&#x27;s oversight and was responsible for maintaining stability and assisting the Munsif in land revenue collection and measurement. The Munsif in the Pargana was under the supervision of the chief Munsif in the Sarkar.

Villages within the Parganas often operated autonomously and were governed by assemblies called Panchayats. This was respected by Sher Shah during his reign. These assemblies consisted of village elders who managed local needs and enforced community-specific punishments. The village chief acted as a liaison between the village and the higher levels of government.

===Religious policy===
The religious policy of Sher Shah is debated amongst historians. Dr. Qanungo states that Sher Shah upheld religious tolerance toward Hindus. Ram Sharma states that Sher Shah Suri was heavily devoted to his faith, always praying the five prayers, while also claiming that Sher Shah&#x27;s wars against the Rajputs were a Jihad. The war against Puran Mal in particular was described as a Jihad, and his treatment of Maldeo were argued as signs of religious intolerance. However, Sher Shah was always tolerant of Hindus. He did not bear grudges against them or wage anti-Hindu propaganda.

Srivastava elaborates, stating that Sher Shah&#x27;s balanced approach satisfied his fellow Muslims despite his lenient treatment of Hindus. His policy was that Islam would hold supremacy over the lands he conquered, but without displacing Hinduism.

===Military===
Noted by historians as an excellent military leader, Sher Shah invited Afghans from across the empire as well as Afghanistan, giving them high positions and personally taking an interest in recruiting troops. Sher Shah promoted individuals based on merit rather than nepotism. The Afghan army emphasized cavalry, while their infantry were armed with muskets. One of his military reforms included dividing his army into divisions, each led by a commander. Discipline was strict, with provisions supplied by Banjaras who accompanied the army. Roles were assigned through the Dagh system, which also helped root out foreign spies. Salaries for soldiers were established at a fixed rate, and salaries were often regular.

During Sher Shah&#x27;s first Bengal campaign from 1536 to 1537, his army was reportedly 240,000 strong, comprising 40,000 horsemen, 200,000 Infantry, 1,500 elephants, and 300 boats. In his second invasion from 1537 to 1538, his forces were said to include 100,000 horsemen and 300,000 footmen. These figures are likely exaggerated. A distressed Mughal commander in 1535 reported that Sher Shah only had 6,000 horsemen, while merely a few years later, he had over 70,000. These figures are put into question by Kolff, but he emphasizes the capabilities of Sher Shah in his methods of recruitment. 

Chaurasia describe Sher Shah&#x27;s commanding abilities through his patience, and foresight, being able to attack at a critical moment. Experienced with numerous military tactics, he often capitalized off of taking enemy forces by surprise. Sher Shah considered Pashto as a sign of friendliness, and gave higher salaries to Afghans who could speak Pashto in his army. By 1540, his standing army consisted of over 150,000 cavalrymen, 25,000 infantrymen, and over 5,000 war elephants.

===Social justice===
Sher Shah was renowned for his social justice. Courts were held by Qadis, with Sher Shah himself observing civil cases. Hindus settled their disputes in Panchayat assemblies, while in criminal cases, nobody was exempt from the law of the empire. The criminal law of the empire was extremely harsh to deter others from committing crimes out of fear of the repercussions. Sher Shah imposed heavy punishments on individuals in high posts, including government officials.

Sher Shah&#x27;s reputation grew as he became known for being a formidable and just ruler, to the point where merchants could travel and sleep in deserts without fear of being harassed by bandits or robbers. His soldiers acted as police, with the duty of finding thieves and robbers. Sher Shah Suri also implemented the reform of self-responsibility, assigning officials the duty to find culprits in cases such as murder; if they failed, they would be held responsible and hanged. Historians praise these reforms for their effectiveness.

===Buildings===
Sher Shah built several monuments, including Rohtas Fort (now a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Pakistan), many structures in the Rohtasgarh Fort in Bihar, the Sher Shah Suri Masjid in Patna, the Qila-i-Kuhna Mosque inside the Purana Qila complex in Delhi, and the Sher Mandal, an octagonal building also inside the Purana Qila complex, which later served as the library of Humayun. He built a new city, Bhera, in present-day Pakistan in 1545, including within it a grand masjid named after him. 

Sher Shah was responsible for greatly rebuilding and modernizing the Grand Trunk Road, a major artery that runs all the way from modern day Bangladesh to Afghanistan. Caravanserais (inns) and mosques were built, and trees were planted along the entire stretch on both sides of the road to provide shade to travelers. Wells were also dug, especially along the western section. He also established an efficient postal system, with mail being carried by relays of horse riders.

The mausoleum of Sher Shah Suri was described as one of the most beautiful monuments in India, due to its grandeur and dignity. British archaeologist Cunningham was even inclined to prefer it over the Taj Mahal.

===Trade===
Among his reforms while consolidating the empire, Sher Shah abolished taxes at the borders of provinces to invigorate trade throughout India. Only two levies remained in place: one on goods being brought into the country and another when goods were sold. As a result, customs duties were entirely removed.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Sher Khan&quot; (1962), an Indian Hindi-language action film by Radhakant starring Kamaljeet in the titular role along with Kumkum, is ostensibly based on the emperor&#x27;s life. &quot;Shershah Suri&quot;, a television show about the emperor, was aired on DD National by Doordarshan, the Indian national public broadcaster.

The Jungle Book, made by Rudyard Kipling, has its antagonist Shere Khan named after Sher Shah Suri.

<doc id="797304" wikidata="Q1049071" url="?curid=797304" title="West Texas Intermediate">
<text>West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is a grade or mix of crude oil; the term is also used to refer to the spot price, the futures price, or assessed price for that oil. In colloquial usage, WTI usually refers to the WTI Crude Oil futures contract traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). The WTI oil grade is also known as Texas light sweet. Oil produced from any location can be considered WTI if the oil meets the required qualifications. Spot and futures prices of WTI are used as a benchmark in oil pricing. This grade is described as light crude oil because of its low density and sweet because of its low sulfur content.

The price of WTI is often included in news reports on oil prices, alongside the price of Brent crude from the North Sea. Other important oil markers include the Dubai crude, Oman crude, Urals oil, and the OPEC reference basket. WTI is lighter and sweeter, containing less sulfur than Brent, and considerably lighter and sweeter than Dubai or Oman.

==WTI crude oil as a trade grade==

Unlike Brent Crude, WTI crude oil is not from any specific oil fields. Rather, WTI is described (for example by the Alberta Government) as &quot;light sweet oil traded and delivered at Cushing, Oklahoma&quot; (with WTI Midland and WTI Houston crude oil defined similarly for Midland, Texas, and Houston, Texas respectively). Historically, local trade between oilfield production and refineries around Midland, Texas, and Cushing, Oklahoma, could be said to define WTI oil, but as local production declined, pipelines into those areas began to deliver crude oil of other grades, produced and blended elsewhere, which were also accepted as WTI. The WTI futures contract formalized this relationship by specifying that the deliverable asset for the contract could be a blend of crude oil, as long as it was of acceptable lightness and sweetness. Crude oil lightness is characterized by oil gravity, and crude oil sweetness by sulfur content. Measurements of lightness and sweetness of WTI changes depending on the particular light and sweet oil traded at Cushing at the time of the measurement, and even the particular measurement methodology.

The Platts and Argus API and sulfur measurements are descriptions of WTI as assessed, while the NYMEX WTI futures contract characterization is a requirement for WTI crude oil delivery to the contract. WTI crude oil will typically satisfy the WTI futures contract requirements and be close to the Platts and Argus assessed values at the time.

==Development of the physical WTI market==
The US governmental decontrol of oil prices on January 28, 1981, marked the beginning of the physical WTI Crude Oil spot market. Under the previous US Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, WTI crude oil traded under a variety of spot prices split into various categories set by the price controls. After the price decontrol, WTI graded crude oil traded under spot prices centered around spot prices at Cushing, Oklahoma, Midland, Texas, and Houston, Texas (specifically at the Magellan East Houston &quot;MEH&quot; Terminal). Oil price collapses during 1985-1986 significantly reduced local oil production around Cushing, and linked Gulf Coast imported crude oil supplies into the Cushing region and the WTI market. The growth of the WTI spot market came in tandem with the growth of the WTI futures market. The volatility of WTI spot prices lead to the development of WTI futures contracts, while the adoption of the WTI futures contracts as hedging tools by producers and refiners worldwide lead to the worldwide adoption of assessed physical WTI spot prices as benchmark prices for crude.

==Global adoption of WTI assessed prices as oil benchmark prices==
Price Reporting Agencies (PRAs), such as Platts and Argus Media, compiled assessment prices of WTI based on prices of spot transactions starting in 1981. Eligible spot transaction prices at Cushing, Oklahoma, is typically reported as WTI, while eligible spot transactions at Midland, Texas, and Houston, Texas (at the MEH Terminal) are reported as WTI Midland, and WTI Houston respectively. The development of WTI spot and futures markets led crude oil producers around the world to use assessed WTI prices as a benchmark in oil pricing. For example, in 2008, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Colombia, and Ecuador based their crude oil selling prices on either the Platts WTI Mnth 1 index or the Platts WTI Mnth 2 index (the assessed prices of transactions with delivery in the next deliverable month or the second deliverable month). Subsequently, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Iraq started using the Argus Sour Crude Index (ASCI) as their price index in 2009, but the ASCI index itself is priced in relation to WTI futures with a differential, which imply those countries still effectively benchmark their crude oil selling prices to WTI.

==NYMEX WTI Crude Oil futures contract==
The volatility of crude oil prices after the US oil price decontrol led to the development of the NYMEX WTI Light Sweet Crude Oil futures contract in 1983. The NYMEX Crude Oil contract trades under the symbol CL on the New York Mercantile Exchange, now part of Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The contract is for 1,000 US barrels, or 42,000 US gallons, of WTI crude oil, the minimum tick size of the contract is $0.01 per barrel ($10 for contract), and the contract price is quoted in US dollars. Monthly contracts are available for the current year, the following 10 calendar years, and 2 additional months. For example, from the perspective of any day in June before the last trade date for the June 2020 contracts, contracts for June 2020, July 2020, August 2020, ... December 2030, January 2031, and February 2031 are available for trading. The maximum number of contracts would be 134 contracts, which occurs at the expiry of a December contract when contracts for a new calendar year and two months are made available for trading.

===Futures contract delivery===
Cushing, Oklahoma is a major trading hub for crude oil and has been the delivery point for crude contracts and therefore the price settlement point for West Texas Intermediate on the New York Mercantile Exchange for over three decades. The town of Cushing, Oklahoma is a small, remote place with only 7,826 inhabitants (according to the 2010 Census). However, it is the site of the Cushing Oil Field, which was discovered in 1912, and dominated U.S. oil production for several years. The area became a &quot;vital transhipment point with many intersecting pipelines, storage facilities, and easy access to refiners and suppliers,&quot; infrastructure which remained after the Cushing field had declined in importance. Crude oil flows &quot;inbound to Cushing from all directions and outbound through dozens of pipelines&quot;. It is in Payne County, Oklahoma, United States.

===Adoption of WTI futures for investment purposes===
Starting in 2003, an influx of traders from outside of the oil industry begun to participate in oil futures and other commodities futures markets. These market participants, which includes hedge funds, pension funds, insurance companies, and retail investors, were motivated by the increasing acceptance of oil futures contracts and related derivatives as financial assets. Demand from these investors and general financial innovation created inexpensive access to financial instruments related to oil futures contracts, such as options, index funds, and exchange-traded funds. As part of wave of investor interest, WTI crude oil futures prices (as well as Brent Crude oil prices) are included in both the Bloomberg Commodity Index and the S&amp;P GSCI commodity index, which are benchmark indices widely followed in financial markets by traders and institutional investors. Its weighting in these commodity indices give LME Nickel prices non-trivial influence on returns on a wide range of investment funds and portfolios.

===Effect of futures contract trading on physical WTI market===
For financial investors without oil storage, purchasing the shortest maturity futures contract and then rolling to the next contract priory to expiry offered the closest approximation to investing in physical oil prices. However, financial markets are much larger than oil markets, and investor flows began to dominate oil producers&#x27; hedging needs and moved the oil futures market into contango, where futures prices are greater than spot prices. Contango imposes a roll cost on investors who must roll futures contracts, as they must pay a relatively higher price for those contracts to get the same underlying spot price exposure as their previous expiring contract. These roll costs could be viewed as compensation, purchased virtual storage, or an indirect subsidy for storage owners to provide the service of storing crude on behalf of financial investors. In the WTI context, storage owners would include most participants in the physical WTI market. Beyond the need by financial investors in oil, oil storage is also valuable because it provides insurance against supply disruptions or unexpected increases in demand. Refiners who wish to avoid carrying real physical oil inventories can purchase futures contracts as virtual storage as an alternative. Oil producers wishing to maintain real physical oil inventories similarly could lower the cost of those inventories through selling futures contracts. Index fund participation in the crude oil market is also associated with lower price volatility.

WTI futures contracts are tied to physical deliveries into the physical spot WTI market, so WTI futures contract prices should converge to physical spot WTI market conditions and prices. But since deliveries made to settle an expiring WTI futures contract are also physical spot WTI transactions that can be included into PRA assessed prices, abnormal futures contract transactions could drive WTI spot prices and assessed prices. This was the case on April 20, 2020, when WTI futures contract trading drove both assessed WTI and ASCI prices to negative territories.

====WTI Negative Pricing April 20, 2020====
On April 20, 2020, WTI&#x27;s May contract closed at -$37.63/barrel while the June contract closed at positive $20.43/barrel. Prices mainly dropped due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced demand, with storage issues and the expiration of the May contract on the following day resulting in reduced trading. For the first time ever, the reduction in trading shut down the Trade at Settlement (TAS) mechanism of the May 2020 WTI contract 30 minutes before the end of trading due to a lack of buyers. The TAS shutdown signaled to market participants that all remaining open May 2020 WTI contracts that have to be sold, either outright or for the purposes of rolling to the June 2020 contract, to the open market in the next twenty minutes. The speed at which the contracts had to be sold, and the closeness of that time to contract expiry meant that large physical oil traders, who could have transported and stored oil elsewhere given a low enough price, could not buy contracts due to operational, risk management, and position limit constraints. Any remaining traders who were willing to buy contracts gained enormous market power and pushed prices downwards into negative territory. This situation is an extreme case of contango. Assess WTI prices were affected, and the WTI spot price dropped to -$36.98 on April 20. At the same time, Mars crude oil produced in the US Gulf Coast (USGC) settled at -$26.63, and Middle East exporters who uses ASCI (of which Mars is a component) as the selling price benchmark had to settle for negative prices that day.

==Pricing premium/discount in relation to Brent==

Historically, WTI has generally traded at a premium to Brent before 2011, but since the shale oil boom in the 2010s it has been traded at a discount against Brent crude oil. Both the volatility of the WTI/Brent premium/discount, as well as its reversal from premium to discount in 2011, are studied and monitored by market participants as indicators for the functioning of WTI and Brent Crude as oil price benchmarks.

===US supply factors===
In February 2011, WTI was trading around $85/barrel while Brent was at $103/barrel. The reason most cited for this difference was that Cushing had reached capacity due to a surplus of oil in the interior of North America. At the same time, Brent moved up in reaction to civil unrest in Egypt and across the Middle East. Since WTI-priced stockpiles at Cushing could not easily be transported to the Gulf Coast, WTI crude was unable to be arbitraged in bringing the two prices back to parity. Oil prices at coastal areas of the United States were closer to Brent than to WTI. In June 2012, the Seaway Pipeline, which had been transporting oil from the Gulf Coast to Cushing, reversed its flow direction, to transport WTI-priced crude to the Gulf Coast, where it received Brent prices. The price difference persisted, however, and was large enough that some oil producers in North Dakota put their oil on tanker cars, and shipped it by rail to the Gulf and East Coast, where it received Brent prices. Brent continued to trade $10–20 higher than WTI for two years, until June 2013.

===Freight rate factors===
To the extent that price difference between WTI and Brent crude entice traders to ship WTI to North Sea refineries or ship Brent to US Gulf Cost refineries, the premium/discount between WTI and Brent crude must reflect oil tanker freight costs. Oil tanker freight cost rates could be highly volatile, due to circular dependence on fuel oil prices and ultimately crude prices, to demand for oil tankers to serve non-USGC non-North-Sea trade routes (especially to China), and to demand for using oil tankers as floating storage for crude oil. From 2000 to 2009, oil tanker freight rates represented a substantial contributor to the WTI premium over Brent crude.

===Brent crude production and trading factors===
Premiums/discounts between WTI and Brent crude also reflects declining crude oil production priced under Brent crude prices. As crude production declines from depletion in Brent crude associated North Sea oilfields (Brent, Forties, Oseberg, Ekofisk, and Troll; also referred to as BFOET), a higher proportion of that oil production is consumed by local European refiners, and both a lesser proportion and a lesser absolute amount of that oil production can be exported to the US. During periods when WTI trades at a premium to Brent crude, declining Brent crude production pushes up that premium as traders cannot source supplies to sell into the US for a profit.

As well, participants in the Brent crude market compensates for declining North Sea production by associating additional oilfields and different quality crude production into the definition of Brent crude, which affects the quality differential between Brent and WTI crude oils. Forties and Oseberg crude oil was added in 2002, Ekofisk crude oil was added in 2007, and Troll crude oil was added in 2018 to Brent crude oil pricing basket. Moreover, the different grades in the &quot;Brent basket&quot; are priced different. For example, Ekofisk, Oseberg, and Troll crude oil grades have a quality premium over Brent crude oil grades, while Forties have a price discount for high sulphur content. Brent prices usually reflect the cheapest or the most competitive physical crude oil in the above basket, which means that Brent prices usually reflect prices for Forties crude oil. These quality changes to Brent Crude oil directly affect the premium or discount between what refiners would pay for WTI and Brent crude oil.

<text>Operation Spring Awakening () was the last major German offensive of World War II. The operation was referred to in Germany as the Plattensee Offensive and in the Soviet Union as the Balaton Defensive Operation. It took place in Western Hungary on the Eastern Front and lasted from 6 March until 15 March 1945. The objective was to secure the last significant oil reserves still available to the European Axis powers and prevent the Red Army from advancing towards Vienna. The Germans failed in their objectives.

The operation, initially planned for 5 March, began after German units were moved in great secrecy to the Lake Balaton () area. Many German units were involved, including the 6th Panzer Army and its subordinate Waffen-SS divisions after being withdrawn from the failed Ardennes offensive on the Western Front. The Germans attacked in three prongs: &quot;Frühlingserwachen&quot; in the Balaton-Lake Velence-Danube area, &quot;Eisbrecher&quot; south of Lake Balaton, and &quot;Waldteufel&quot; south of the Drava-Danube triangle. The advance stalled on 15 March, and on 16 March the Red Army and allied units began their delayed Vienna offensive.

== Background ==
On 12 January Hitler received confirmation that the Soviet Red Army had begun a massive winter offensive through Poland, named the Vistula–Oder offensive. Hitler ordered OB West Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt to withdraw the following units from active combat in the Battle of the Bulge: I SS Panzer Corps with 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH) and 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend, along with II SS Panzer Corps with 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich and 9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen. These units were to be refitted by 30 January and attached to the 6th Panzer Army under the command of Sepp Dietrich for the upcoming Operation Spring Awakening. Hitler wanted to secure the extremely vital Nagykanizsa oil fields of southern Hungary, as these were the most strategically valuable assets remaining on the Eastern Front. The deadline of 30 January proved impossible for refitting to be completed.

As Operation Spring Awakening would be of great importance, lengthy preparation and strategic care was taken to preserve the operation&#x27;s secrecy. But while the 6th Panzer Army was refitting in Germany, Hitler ordered a preliminary offensive with a similar object to be conducted, resulting in Operation Konrad III beginning 18 January. The objectives of Konrad III included relieving besieged Budapest and the recapturing of the Transdanubia region. By 21 January, only 5 days into Operation Konrad III, the Germans had taken the towns of Dunapentele and Adony which are on the Western shore of the Danube. Their push resulted in the annihilation of the Soviet 7th Mechanized Corps. This sudden and savage push caused the Soviet command to contemplate an evacuation to the opposite shore of the Danube. Before the end of the 4th day, the Germans had recaptured 400 square kilometers of territory, an achievement comparable to the initial German gains during the Ardennes offensive and the Western Front in December 1944. At the height of Operation Konrad III, January 26, the Axis front lines had reached within 20 km of Budapest&#x27;s southern perimeter, and within about 10 km of the northern perimeter, but their forces were exhausted.

From 27 January through 15 February, the Soviets conducted numerous successful counter-attacks, forcing the Germans to give up the greater portion of their territorial gains, pushing the front line back to the area between Lake Velence, the village of Csősz, and Lake Balaton. This area had the Margit Line running right through it, and would see more fighting in the upcoming Operation Spring Awakening. By mid-February, the Soviet bridgehead across the Garam River north of Esztergom was identified as a threat. This bridgehead would jeopardize the upcoming Spring Awakening&#x27;s southeastern push past Lake Balaton to secure the southern Hungarian oilfields while also exposing a straight route towards Vienna. Thus, beginning on 17 February, Operation Southwind began the effort to secure the Garam bridgehead from the 2nd Ukrainian Front, and by 24 February the task was successfully achieved, proving to be the very last successful German offensive of the war.

== German plan ==

=== Creation of Operation Spring Awakening ===

During a Situation Conference on 7 January 1945, at which both Hermann Göring and Rundstedt were present, Hitler proposed his intention of pulling the 6th SS Panzer Army to reserve due to severe Allied air attacks. Rundstedt received the withdrawal orders on January 8, and the Panzer Army&#x27;s divisions began preparations to withdraw from the stalled Ardennes Offensive. The slow withdrawal was greatly hampered by Allied air superiority.

On 12 January, the Soviet 1st Ukrainian and 1st Belorussian Fronts began their Vistula–Oder offensive with over 2 million men, placing considerable new pressure on the Eastern Front. When this news reached Hitler, he immediately began to plan a major offensive of his own on this Front. Unfortunately, at the time, Hitler&#x27;s best remaining panzer forces were still engaged on the Western Front. On 20 January, Hitler ordered Rundstedt to withdraw forces from the ongoing Battle of the Bulge; the 1st SS, 2nd SS, and 12th SS Panzer Divisions managed to disengage and withdraw the same day. Almost all support units of the 6th SS Panzer Army were pulled from the Ardennes by 22 January, while the 9th SS Panzer Division was the last to leave on 23 January.

On this same day, 22 January, Hitler committed to send the fatigued 6th SS Panzer Army to Hungary for his new counteroffensive, a view Heinz Guderian (OKH) partially agreed with. Guderian wanted the 6th SS Panzer Army on the Eastern Front, but would have preferred its employment in the defence of Berlin. A glimpse of the ensuing verbal exchange during this argument was captured in Alfred Jodl&#x27;s (OKW) post-war interrogation, where he quotes Hitler saying: &quot;You want to attack without oil – good, we&#x27;ll see what happens when you attempt that&quot;.

Hitler&#x27;s reasoning for sending the 6th SS Panzer Army south into Hungary can be understood through the list of main strategic points listed in a Situation in the East conference held on January 23: 1) The Hungarian oil region and Vienna oil region, which made up 80% of remaining reserves, had to be defended and/or retaken, and without which the war effort could not be continued; 2) the defense of the Upper Silesian industrial region, vital for the war economy and coal production. Two quotes illustrate how seriously Hitler viewed this ruling: &quot;&quot;Hitler considered the protection of Vienna and Austria as of vital importance and that he would rather see Berlin fall than lose the Hungarian oil area and Austria&quot;, &quot;He&quot; [Hitler] &quot;accepted the risk of the Russian threat to the Oder east of Berlin&quot;&quot;. Hitler chose to ignore Guderian&#x27;s view for how the 6th SS Panzer Army should be deployed.

On 27 January, Guderian was tasked by Hitler to stop the 3rd Ukrainian Front in the vicinity of the Margit Line in order to protect the vital oil fields. The following day, 28 January, this operation received its preliminary name, Operation Süd (German: South). The main objectives of the operation were as follows: 1) the security of vital raw materials such as oil, bauxite, and manganese for iron, 2) the defense of arable land for food and crops, the Austrian military industrial complex, and the city of Vienna, and 3) to stop the Soviet advance. Interestingly, an additional side-objective was the hope that the counteroffensive would force the Soviet command to divert some forces from its northern offensives headed to Berlin instead towards Hungary.

Operation Süd was scheduled to start after a path to Budapest had been established. The operation would be considered a success if 1) Operation Konrad III could pin the Soviets between the Vértes mountains and the Danube, 2) the 8th Army could secure its Front in Northern Hungary, and 3) if the incoming panzer armies could be refitted during transit to maintain the element of surprise.

Four plans for Operation Süd were produced by high-ranking officials from Army Group South, the 6th SS Panzer Army, and the 6th Army: &quot;Lösung A&quot; (German: Solution A) by Fritz Krämer of the 6th SS Panzer Army; &quot;Lösung B&quot; and &quot;Lösung C2&quot; by Helmuth von Grolman of Army Group South; and &quot;Lösung C1&quot; by Heinrich Gaedcke of the 6th Army. There was much fighting and bickering as to which plan should be implemented. The commander of Army Group South, Otto Wöhler, chose &quot;Lösung B&quot;.

The four plans were sent to Guderian on 22 February for review, and Army Group South informed Army Group F commander Maximilian von Weichs on 23 February that the operation would commence on 5 March, in anticipation that Operation Südwind (German: South Wind) would have finished successfully by 24 February. If Operation Südwind was successful, Operation Süd&#x27;s start could be deferred by 8 to 9 days. On 25 February, Hitler ordered Wöhler, Weichs, and Dietrich to personally present the plans for Operation Süd to him, along with Guderian and Jodl, at the Reich Chancellery in Berlin, where he ultimately chose &quot;Lösung C2&quot;, disagreeing with the commander of Army Group South, Otto Wöhler. Guderian then ordered Wöhler to increase the daily fuel allowance from 400 to 500 cubic meters (400k to 500k liters) of fuel on February 26, and by February 28 the specifics of the operation, now officially named &quot;Operation Frühlingserwachen&quot; (Spring Awakening), were completed. As per &quot;Lösung C2&quot;, 3 offensive prongs were planned, with the main attack of the 6th Army and 6th SS Panzer Army, &quot;Frühlingserwachen&quot;, being directed towards the Danube through Lakes Velence and Balaton; the 2nd Panzer Army&#x27;s &quot;Eisbrecher&quot; (Icebreaker) attack directed eastward from the western end of Lake Balaton; and the LXXXXI Corps &quot;Waldteufel&quot; (Forest Devil) attack directed north from the Drava River.

=== Overarching German military structure ===
OKW was the overarching military command for the German army in WW2, while the OKH was officially a high command operating under OKW. Adolf Hitler was the Commander-in-chief of OKH, while also being the supreme commander of OKW. Finding itself issuing more and more direct orders, OKW eventually became responsible for Western and Southern commands, while OKH was responsible for Eastern commands. This operational overlap caused by the centralized command led to disagreements, shortages, waste, inefficiencies, and delays, often escalating to the point where Hitler himself would have to give the final ruling on a matter.

For Operation Spring Awakening, the area for the new offensive was set on the borderline between OKW (Army Group F) and OKH (Army Group South), and this would cause troubles. Army Group E wanted to assemble its troops north of the Drava River by February 25, but Army Group South was not prepared to start the offensive this early due to the ongoing Operation Southwind; subsequently, the OKW and Hitler grew more impatient. The chosen course of action on 25 February, &quot;Lösung C2&quot;, favored the quicker and farther-reaching joint operation of the 2nd Panzer Army and 6th SS Panzer Army, while &quot;Lösung B&quot; opted to first secure the left flank of the main thrust &quot;Frühlingserwachen&quot; (between Lake Velence and the Danube) before moving south toward the 2nd Panzer army. Guderian was in favor of &quot;Lösung C2&quot; because this plan would shorten the time the 6th SS Panzer Division would need to stay in Hungary. The OKW and OKH did not use common terminology for parts of the offensive, as OKH referred to the entire offensive as Frühlingserwachen, while the OKW referred to the operation attacking north of the Drava as &quot;Waldteufel&quot;.

Army Group South and the OKH could not agree on how to best utilize the 1st Cavalry Corps. OKH wanted to send the Corps south-west to the 2nd Panzer army, a move Wöhler saw of little use since the 2nd Panzer army would have a lower chance of success compared to the main attacking thrust of &quot;Frühlingserwachen&quot;. Wöhler wanted to use the 1st Cavalry Corps on the eastern shore of Lake Balaton, as German intelligence reported that &quot;the enemy is still the weakest between Lake Balaton and the Sárviz Channel&quot;.

To further complicate matters, due to the limited number of newly trained personnel this late in the war, units under Waffen-SS command were often kept at acceptable capacity levels using Wehrmacht personnel. For instance, only 1/3 of the 6th SS Panzer Army&#x27;s staff were actually from the Waffen-SS.

=== Arrival into the Hungarian theater ===
When withdrawing from the Western Front, elements of the III. Flak-Korps were tasked with protecting the 6th SS Panzer Army while en route to Zossen south of Berlin. From here the units&#x27; possible de-training locations would seem to be the cities along the Oder River, however this was a calculated misinformation measure to confuse enemy forces who actually attacked these cities. The real plan for the units of 6th SS Panzer Army was to travel south through Vienna to their first Hungarian destination, the city of Győr and its surrounding area. Other units from other armies were also sent to the Hungarian theater, for example the 16th SS Panzer Grenadier Division Reichsführer-SS who was brought up from Italy through the Brenner straight and sent to the 2nd Panzer Army. Some units necessary for the major offensive did not arrive in Hungary until just a few days before its start, the last being the 9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen arriving in Győr at the beginning of March. Many of the incoming units also received cover names to help further mask the build-up of forces from the enemy.
By 7 February, on orders of Hitler, strict secrecy rulings were put into place: death penalty for command infractions, license plates were to be covered, insignia on vehicles and uniforms to be covered, no reconnaissance in forward combat areas, unit movements only by night or overcast conditions, no radio traffic, and the units were not to appear on situation maps.

Prior to these measures, on 30 January, 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte was ordered to follow many of the same secrecy measures, including the temporary removal of their cuff titles.

=== Objectives of the German forces ===
As per the selected &quot;Lösung C2&quot;, the Germans planned to attack Soviet General Fyodor Tolbukhin&#x27;s 3rd Ukrainian Front. On 27 February, Army Group South hosted a chiefs-of-staff conference to which the chiefs-of-staff of the 2nd Panzer Army, 6th SS Panzer Army, 6th Army, 8th Army, and Luftflotte 4 attended; here the plans for Operation Spring Awakening were laid out. The offensive would consist of four forces, three were to be attack forces while one was to be a defense force. Below are the units under their respective command as discussed on 27 February.


On 28 February, the start date for Operation Spring Awakening was finally moved back to 6 March, though many commanders felt that a greater delay was necessary. During the first days of March, alarming reports about road and terrain conditions due to the spring thaw flooded Army Group South Headquarters. Such thaws had previously badly affected 3 other operations in the area: planned Operation Spätlese in December, Operation Southwind, and the &quot;Waldteufel&quot; attack forcing a change of location for the attack bridgehead from Osijek to Donji Miholjac. Despite the start of the operation being so close, some additional plans were thought up to help the sluggish assembly speeds of incoming units. On 3 March, the 6th SS Panzer Army suggested that a naval assault across Lake Balaton itself could be implemented to help the 1st Cavalry Corps on the southeastern edge, but this turned out to be impossible as the spring storms had blown the pack ice against the southern shore. On 5 March, the 6th SS Panzer Army took over command of the Hungarian II Corps, along with its 20th Hungarian Division and 9th replacement Division, hereby becoming responsible for the northern shore of Lake Balaton.

The 6th Panzer Army was responsible for the primary thrust of the offensive, &quot;Frühlingserwachen&quot;. It was to advance from an area north of Lake Balaton, through the two lakes (Balaton and Velence), and southeast to capture territory from the Sió Channel to the Danube. After reaching the Danube, one part of the army would turn north creating a northern spearhead and move along the Danube River to retake Budapest, which had been captured on 13 February 1945. Another part of 6th SS Panzer Army would then turn south and create a southern spearhead. The southern spearhead would move along the Sió to link up with units from German Army Group E, which was to thrust north through Mohács. However, the commanding staff of Army Group E was pessimistic about the LXXXXI Corps&#x27; ability to reach Mohács due to the unfavorable terrain and sole dependence on infantry. Nonetheless, if successful, it was envisioned that the meeting of Army Group E&#x27;s &quot;Waldteufel&quot; and the 6th SS Panzer Army&#x27;s &quot;Frühlingserwachen&quot; would encircle both the Soviet 26th Army and the Soviet 57th Army.

The 6th Army would join the 6th SS Panzer Army in its thrust southeast to the Danube, then turn north to cover the flank of &quot;Frühlingserwachen&quot;. The 2nd Panzer Army&#x27;s &quot;Eisbrecher&quot; would advance from an area southwest of Lake Balaton and progress towards Kaposvár to engage the Soviet 57th Army. All this time, the Hungarian Third Army would hold the area west of Budapest along the Vértes Mountains.

== Soviet preparation ==

=== Interrupted Soviet offensive preparations ===
On 17 February 1945, the Stavka of the Supreme High Command instructed the 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian Fronts to prepare for an offensive towards Vienna which would begin on March 15. However, from 17 to 18 February, the 2nd Ukrainian Front noticed the 1st SS Panzer division Leibstandarte and the 12th SS Panzer division Hitlerjugend fighting at the Garam River during the German Operation Southwind. Knowing that German Panzer divisions were not created for defensive purposes, the Soviet Fronts in Hungary became suspicious of the enemy&#x27;s intentions. Prisoners taken during Operation Southwind testified that the Germans were in fact preparing to gather a large offensive force. By 20 February, the Soviet fronts in Hungary began to understand what the Germans planned to do. The security of the lands west of the Danube, particularly in the south which held the Hungarian oil fields, was the Germans&#x27; main priority at this stage of the war.

=== Soviet defensive preparations ===
As the 2nd Ukrainian Front held the territory of Budapest and the lands north of the Hungarian capital, defensive preparations in this sector were not paid much attention due to the lower likelihood of attack, but this was not the same in the south. 3rd Ukrainian Front marshal Fyodor Tolbukhin ordered his armies to prepare for a German offensive on his entire Front, preparation of which would have to be completed no later then 3 March. To ensure sufficient supply of war materials and fuel, stockpiles were set up on either side of the Danube, a ferry was put into use and additional temporary bridges and gas pipelines were built on the Danube River.

Tolbukhin&#x27;s plan was to initially slow down the German advance to rob their offensive of momentum, then begin grinding down the attacking armies, then initiate the planned Soviet offensive to finish off the remaining German forces. This plan, along with the strategic deployment of the Soviet forces, was quite similar to that of the Battle of Kursk, although it utilized experiences learned in 1943. The 3rd Ukrainian Front worked on digging in, creating extensive trench networks ideal for anti-tank defenses, along with defensive earthworks for the artillery and infantry. The main differences between the Soviet defenses during the Battle of Kursk and the Balaton defensive operation (the Russian name for Operation Spring Awakening) was the relative short time frame allowed for defensive preparations (half a month), the smaller number of Soviet forces partaking in the defensive, and a reduced focus on perfecting the defensive lines as after all the 3rd Ukrainian Front would need to start its offensive from these lines. Other minor differences included the lack or limited use of barbed wire installations, anti-tank obstacles, and bunkers, although the 4th Guards Army command did suggest placing the burnt out wrecks of 38 previously destroyed German tanks into advantageous positions; it is unclear how many were actually set up.

Tolbukhin&#x27;s 3rd Ukrainian Front had 5 Armies plus 1 Air Army, in addition it also had the 1st Bulgarian Army with the 3rd Yugoslav Partisan Army also partaking in the defense. The 3rd Ukrainian Front would be set up in a two echelon defensive layout, with the 4th Guards Army, 26th Army, and 57th Army, and the 1st Bulgarian Army in the first echelon, while the 27th Army would be held back in the second echelon for reserve. The 4th Guards Army&#x27;s three Guards Rifle Corps and one Guards Fortified District would be spread out over a 39 km front and reach 30 km deep, broken into two belts with one behind the other. The 26th Army, which was expected to take the brunt of the German offensive, arranged its three Rifle Corps along a 44 km front but only 10–15 km deep. The 26th Army&#x27;s Corps&#x27; would be layered in two belts whose defensive preparations had originally begun back on 11 February, prior to any sign of German offensive intentions. The 57th Army&#x27;s one Guards Rifle and one Rifle Corps were spread along a 60 km front and 10–15 km deep; the Army would receive another Rifle Corps during the fighting. The 27th Army&#x27;s one Guards Rifle and two Rifle Corps would remain in reserve unless the situation in the 26th Army called for its use. Held in reserve, the 3rd Ukrainian Front also had the 18th Tank Corps and 23rd Tanks Corps, along with the 1st Guards Mechanized Corps and the 5th Guards Cavalry Corps. While these Armies were preparing for the imminent offensive, the 17th Air Army was busy flying reconnaissance missions, although they could not report on much due to excellent German camouflage.

Because of the serious tank losses of January–February along the Margit line, Marshal Tolbukhin ordered that no Front/Army level counter-attacks were to take place, and local tactical attacks should be very limited; the only objective was to hold the Front and grind down the German offensive. The two tanks Corps would remain under the 26th and 27th Armies to be utilized only in dire need. The defensive strategy of the 3rd Ukrainian Front was one of anti-tank defense as this was what the Germans were going to use. On average for every kilometer of Front, 700+ anti-tank and 600+ anti-infantry mines were placed, with these numbers rising to 2,700 and 2,900 respectively in the 26th Army&#x27;s sector. Between the 4th Guards Army and 26th Guards Army, 66 anti-tank zones were created whose depth reached 30–35 km. Each anti-tank position had 8–16 artillery guns and a similar number of anti-tank guns. A prime example of the scale of defensive installments can be seen in the 26th Army&#x27;s 135th Rifle Corps. Between 18 February and 3 March the 233rd Rifle Division had dug 27 kilometers of trenches, 130 gun and mortar positions, 113 dugouts, 70 command posts and observation points, and laid 4,249 antitank and 5,058 antipersonnel mines, all this on a frontage of 5 kilometers. Although there were no tanks in this defensive zone, there was an average of 17 anti-tank guns per kilometer forming 23 tank killing grounds.

=== Overarching Soviet military structure ===
The Soviet forces, contrary to the Germans, did not have such odd structural complications as the Soviet armies could make independent decisions while the Stavka could intervene when asked or if necessary; a much more straightforward military structure with clear boundaries. This is an example of a de-centralized command. It was not uncommon for the Soviets to actually search out and exploit the boundaries between the OKW and OKH as they knew these areas would suffer from poorer military command; the advance to Budapest is an example.

==Order of battle for 6–15 March 1945==
These are the main units that were a part of the Army Groups/Front which saw combat in Operation Spring Awakening. Please note that the units below are subordinate to the commanding structure under which they spent the most time during the offensive. Units during the final months of the war were very prone to location reassignments as the front situation evolved. Reserve units are not included in the list.

== German offensive ==

The offensive units did not start in unison owing to complications, thus the units of the 6th SS Panzer Army began their attack at 04:00 while the 2nd SS Panzer Corps attacked at 18:30. On the 6 March 1945, the German 6th Army, joined by the 6th SS Panzer Army launched a pincer movement north and south of Lake Balaton. Ten armoured (Panzer) and five infantry divisions, including a large number of new heavy Tiger II tanks, struck 3rd Ukrainian Front, hoping to reach the Danube and link up with the German 2nd Panzer Army forces attacking south of Lake Balaton. The attack was spearheaded by the 6th SS Panzer Army and included once elite units such as the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler, by now seriously degraded from constant fighting and heavy losses. Dietrich&#x27;s army made &quot;good progress&quot; at first, but as they drew near the Danube, the combination of the muddy terrain and strong Soviet resistance had ground the German advance to a halt.

On 10 March, the Axis forces fighting under Operation Spring Awakening around Lake Balaton had a total of 230 operational tanks and 167 operational assault guns between their 17 divisions. A single fully equipped late 1944 Panzer division would officially have held no fewer than 136 tanks, meaning that by 10 March the entire offensive immediately surrounding Lake Balaton had enough tanks for only 1.7 Panzer divisions as opposed to the 11 which were in action.

By the 14 March, Operation Spring Awakening was at risk of failure. The 6th SS Panzer Army was well short of its goals. The 2nd Panzer Army did not advance as far on the southern side of Lake Balaton as the 6th SS Panzer Army had on the northern side. Army Group E met fierce resistance from the Bulgarian First Army and Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s Yugoslav Partisans, and failed to reach its objective of Mohács. German losses were heavy. Heeresgruppe Süd lost 15,117 casualties in the first eight days of the offensive.

On the 15 March, strength returns on this day show the &quot;Hohenstaufen&quot; Division with 35 Panther tanks, 20 Panzer IVs, 32 Jagdpanzers, 25 Sturmgeschützes and 220 other self-propelled weapons and armoured cars. 42% of these vehicles were damaged, under short or long-term repair. The &quot;Das Reich&quot; Division had 27 Panthers, 22 Panzer IVs, 28 Jagdpanzers and 26 Sturmgeschützes on hand (the number of those under repair is not available).

== Soviet counterattack – Vienna offensive ==
On 16 March, the Soviets forces counterattacked in strength. The Germans were driven back to the positions they had held before Operation Spring Awakening began. The overwhelming numerical superiority of the Red Army made any defense impossible, but Hitler believed victory was attainable.

On 22 March, the remnants of the 6th SS Panzer Army withdrew towards Vienna. By 30 March, the Soviet 3rd Ukrainian Front crossed from Hungary into Austria. By 4 April, the 6th SS Panzer Army was already in the Vienna area desperately setting up defensive lines against the anticipated Soviet Vienna offensive. Approaching and encircling the Austrian capital were the Soviet 4th and 6th Guards Tank, 9th Guards, and 46th Armies.

The Soviet&#x27;s Vienna Offensive ended with the fall of the city on 13 April. By 15 April, the remnants of the 6th SS Panzer Army were north of Vienna, facing the Soviet 9th Guards and 46th Armies. By 15 April, the depleted German 6th Army was north of Graz, facing the Soviet 26th and 27th Armies. The remnants of the German 2nd Panzer Army were south of Graz in the Maribor area, facing the Soviet 57th Army and the Bulgarian First Army. Between 25 April and 4 May, the 2nd Panzer Army was attacked near Nagykanizsa during the Nagykanizsa–Körmend offensive.
Some Hungarian units survived the fall of Budapest and the destruction which followed when the Soviets counterattacked after Operation Spring Awakening. The Hungarian Szent László Infantry Division was still indicated to be attached to the German 2nd Panzer Army as late as 30 April. Between 16 and 25 March, the Hungarian Third Army had been destroyed about west of Budapest by the Soviet 46th Army which was driving towards Bratislava and the Vienna area.

On 19 March, the Red Army recaptured the last territories lost during the 13‑day Axis offensive. Sepp Dietrich, commander of the Sixth SS Panzer Army tasked with defending the last sources of petroleum controlled by the Germans, joked that &quot;6th Panzer Army is well named—we have just six tanks left.&quot;

== Armband order ==
The failure of the operation resulted in the &quot;armband order&quot; that was issued by Hitler to Dietrich, who claimed that the troops, and more importantly, the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot;, &quot;did not fight as the situation demanded.&quot; As a mark of disgrace, the Waffen-SS units involved in the battle were ordered to remove their cuff titles. Dietrich did not relay the order to his troops. The reason for not relaying this order was twofold; firstly the order had already been partially previously completed as cuff tiles were already removed from the uniforms as per a secrecy measure ordered on 30 January 1945, secondly there was no need to further disgrace his men beyond the fatal loss they had just suffered.

== Trophy tanks ==

After new territory had been captured, Soviet collection teams scoured the countryside and towns to document and photograph knocked out Axis vehicles and tanks. This was an effort to document not only the sudden buildup of Axis forces and to gain intelligence, but also an opportunity to assess the quality of their opponent&#x27;s technology. Four main commissions were formed by the HQ of the artillery of the 3rd Ukrainian Front, the 17th Air Army, the 9th Guards Army, and the 18th Tank corps. Hundreds of tanks and armored fighting vehicles were documented.

<text>Backwash is a retrospective compilation of music by the group Talulah Gosh.

==The album==
Released on LP and CD by K Records in 1996 (see 1996 in music), it contains all of their single and radio session tracks, plus live versions of two songs of which no studio recordings exist (&quot;Pastels Badge&quot; and &quot;Rubber Ball&quot;) and a flexi-disc track (&quot;I Told You So&quot;). The compilation falls in the field of twee pop.

With their earlier collections &quot;Rock Legends: Volume 69&quot; and &quot;They&#x27;ve Scoffed the Lot&quot; now out of print, &quot;Backwash&quot; remains the only commercially available record by the band. As well as the three exclusive songs, both of these previous compilations are included here, save for a short count-in (by either Eithne Farry or Amelia Fletcher) on &quot;The Girl with the Strawberry Hair&quot;, which is omitted.

The artwork resembles the cover of &quot;They&#x27;ve Scoffed the Lot&quot;: as well as the pattern design, two members are shown on the front with three on the back. On &quot;Scoffed&quot; the lineup with Elizabeth Price was represented, while on &quot;Backwash&quot; her successor Eithne Farry is shown.

&quot;Backwash&quot; was given the rare 10/10 rating by &quot;NME&quot;.

===&quot;Was It Just A Dream?&quot;===

With the physical formats of &quot;Backwash&quot; out of print, a new compilation titled &quot;Was It Just A Dream?&quot; was released on Damaged Goods - Damgood364lp/cd in 2013. This contained &quot;Backwash&quot; in full, with the addition of four demo tracks recorded in 1986 and previously issued as a limited edition EP for Record Store Day in 2011.

<text>Marie J. Desonier State Nature Preserve is located in eastern Athens County, Ohio, United States. It is heavily forested, on Jordan Run near its headwaters, in Deep Hollow. The preserve features a loop trail, the Oak Ridge Trail, with two footbridges. This trail can be hiked in a two-mile loop, or as a 2.5-mile loop. There are no other developed facilities there except for a small parking area. The preserve represents a good example of the local forest, with relatively few invasive species.

<text>Manhunt, sometimes just called hunt, refers to a number of variations of the game of tag. The goal is to avoid being tagged by anyone designated as &quot;it&quot; or (for those already &quot;it&quot;) to tag anyone who has not been tagged. It is played in the dark. Some variations include teams and point scoring. In some variants flashlights are used. Other variants on manhunt include Takedown manhunt and Buildup Manhunt. In the Takedown manhunt version the player tagged &quot;IT&quot; will need to bring the player down to the ground often with force in order for it to be counted as a tag. In the Build up variant, the game starts as any normal game, but instead of players who have been captured waiting out the game they will join the hunter and also become &quot;it&quot; themselves.

<doc id="797326" wikidata="Q2564177" url="?curid=797326" title="Abarat">
<text>Abarat (2002) is a fantasy novel written and illustrated by Clive Barker, the first in Barker&#x27;s &quot;The Books of Abarat&quot; series. It is aimed primarily at young adults. The eponymous Abarat is a fictional archipelago which is the setting for the majority of the story.

The title image contains an ambigram, which may indicate that it is derived from the Russian word &#x27;наоборот&#x27; commonly meaning &#x27;the other way around&#x27;. The paintings in the book are done with oils. Barker had already completed 300 paintings before he started working on the first book. By most accounts, Barker realised early that the story he wanted to tell could not be contained in one book. The American Library Association picked &quot;Abarat&quot; as one of its Best Books for Young Adults.

==Plot==
&quot;Abarat&quot; focuses on Candy Quackenbush, a teenage girl frustrated with her life in Chickentown, Minnesota. After an argument with her teacher over a school project and the doodling Candy has done in her school workbook, Candy leaves the school and goes to the edge of town, where she sees the remains of a lighthouse. She finds this incredibly strange because Chickentown is thousands of miles from the ocean.

She then encounters a master thief named John Mischief who looks human except for the antlers on his head. Mischief&#x27;s seven brothers live on these horns, appearing only as heads. Because he is pursued by a sinister humanoid being named Mendelson Shape, Mischief sends Candy to light the lamp in the lighthouse, which summons an ocean known as the Sea of Izabella from a parallel world. Candy climbs the rotting lighthouse stairs while the brothers distract Shape. When she reaches the top, she finds an inverted pyramid with a cup on top. As Shape gets away from Mischief and his brothers and begins to climb the stairs, Candy searches for the ball that goes in the cup and will light the lamp. She finds it and is surprised to see it is covered in swirling lines exactly like the ones she doodled in her school book. After giving her a key to protect and extinguishing the light, Mischief and Candy ride the seas to Abarat. A group of creatures carry them to a nearby island where Candy is separated from him. On the island, Candy learns that the Abarat consists of twenty-five islands, each occupying a different hour of the day, and was formerly connected to Candy&#x27;s world before the harbour&#x27;s destruction by Abaratian authorities. Thereafter the story follows her adventures as she discovers the crises affecting the Abarat, and gains intimations that she may be destined to conclude these. The story also introduces her chief antagonists: the sorcerer known as Christopher Carrion, his grandmother Mater Motley, and the industrialist Rojo Pixler, all of whom seek to dominate the Abarat.

==Critical reception==
In 2002, &quot;Abarat&quot; was nominated for the Bram Stoker Award for Best Work for Young Readers. In 2003 it won 2nd place in the Locus Poll for the Best Young Adult Novel.

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; reviewed it as &quot;the author&#x27;s imagination runs wild as he conjures some striking imagery (&quot;Dark threads of energy moved through her veins and leaped from her fingertips&quot; says one of the three women in the opening scene) and cooks up a surreal stew of character portraits (rendered in bold colours and brushwork, they resemble some of Van Gogh&#x27;s later work). But much of the novel feels like a wind-up for the books to follow and, after this rather unwieldy 400-page ride, readers may be disappointed by so many unresolved strands of the plot&quot;.

&quot;School Library Journal&quot; said &quot;Barker is obviously more comfortable in the Abarat than he is in our more mundane world; the chapters that take place in Chickentown don&#x27;t seem fully developed. Once Candy is safely in the fantastical realm, however, the story takes off. The rendering of the Abarat&#x27;s locales, cultures, and mythology, combined with the author&#x27;s own full-color illustrations and well-realized characters, allows readers to become quickly immersed in this beautiful and frightening world. In spite of a less-than-credible, almost preternatural calm in the face of the bizarre, Candy makes a fine protagonist, displaying strength, vulnerability, and a lack of the forced spunkiness displayed by some adventurous heroines. This first book in a series of four sets the stage nicely for what is sure to be a rollicking, epic ride&quot;.

==Proposed adaptations==
Before the first book was published, Disney bought full rights to the series for $8 million, intending to produce a film series to rival Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series. There were also preliminary plans for theme parks based on the Babilonium island from the books.

<text>Rockbridge State Nature Preserve is a nature reserve featuring a natural bridge located in the unincorporated community of Rockbridge in Hocking County, Ohio, United States. It is part of the Hocking Hills region, but the sandstone that forms the natural bridge is located lower in the stratigraphic sequence than that which forms most of the region&#x27;s notable features.

== Nature preserve ==
The preserve consists of of land which borders the Hocking River and is connected to the trailhead via a narrow easement. The park&#x27;s trail system includes two loop trails, one of which passes the natural bridge, while the other passes a rock shelter. Both formations are located a short distance from the Hocking River on small tributaries. The preserve was acquired by the state of Ohio in 1978.

== Natural bridge ==
The natural bridge is the largest of at least 12 natural bridges in the state of Ohio. It is approximately long, wide, and thick. It was formed when water eroded the softer layers of Mississippian Black Hand sandstone underneath the bridge. The nearby community of Rockbridge, Ohio is named after the formation.

<text>Strange Brew (also known as The Adventures of Bob &amp; Doug McKenzie: Strange Brew) is a 1983 Canadian-American comedy film starring the popular &quot;SCTV&quot; characters Bob and Doug McKenzie, portrayed by Dave Thomas and Rick Moranis, who also served as co-directors. Co-stars include Max von Sydow, Paul Dooley, Lynne Griffin and Angus MacInnes.

Loosely based on elements of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, most of the film was shot in Toronto and Scarborough. Parts were also filmed in Prince George, British Columbia.

==Plot==
Two unemployed brothers, Bob and Doug McKenzie (Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas), screen a poorly made film they have produced to a theatre audience. When the disappointed patrons become hostile, they release a jar of moths into the theatre, which disrupts the showing and allows them to escape without issuing refunds, although they do give one refund to a couple of crying kids, which turned out to be the beer money their father gave them. The next day, the two place a live mouse in an empty beer bottle in an attempt to blackmail the local beer store into giving them free Elsinore beer, but they are told to take their complaint to Elsinore brewery&#x27;s management. When they do so, they are given jobs on the bottling line inspecting for mice in bottles.

Meanwhile, the evil Brewmeister Smith (Max von Sydow) is developing a plan to take over the world by adulterating Elsinore beer with a mind control drug which, while rendering the consumer docile, also makes them vulnerable to mind control when certain tones are played. Smith tests this spiked beer on patients of the neighbouring Royal Canadian Institute for the Mentally Insane, which is connected to the brewery by tunnels.

Bob and Doug learn that the brewery&#x27;s former owner, John Elsinore, has recently died under mysterious circumstances and his daughter Pam (Lynne Griffin) has been given full control of the Elsinore brewery. While exploring the massive complex, they find a shuttered cafeteria containing an old Galactic Border Patrol video game, which supernaturally reveals that Brewmeister Smith murdered John Elsinore and that Pam&#x27;s bumbling Uncle Claude (Paul Dooley) was involved. Bob recognizes a brewery employee as former hockey great Jean &quot;Rosie&quot; LaRose (Angus MacInnes), who suffered a career-ending nervous breakdown and has fallen under Smith&#x27;s control.

Eventually, Bob and Doug wander into the Brewmeister&#x27;s operations room while he is away, and Doug takes a floppy disk containing a video of John Elsinore&#x27;s murder (thinking it is a &quot;new wave EP bootleg&quot; and not realizing the importance of its contents). Smith and Claude tranquilize the brothers and arrange to frame them for murder, concealing Pam and her father&#x27;s friend, Henry Green (Douglas Campbell), in beer kegs in the back of their sabotaged van, and instruct the brothers to deliver the kegs to a party. Unable to stop, the brothers careen into Lake Ontario. All survive (Pam with apparent memory loss), and the brothers are arrested.

The brothers&#x27; bizarre antics at their trial cause the judge to declare them insane and put them under Brewmeister Smith&#x27;s care at the asylum. Rosie soon finds them and helps them escape, and they find and rescue Pam. Having figured out the Brewmeister&#x27;s plan, Rosie foments an uprising among the brainwashed mental-patient test subjects. The brothers separate for the first time in their lives. Doug and a group of asylum inmates help capture Claude, while Rosie and another group overpower Brewmeister Smith. The spirit of John Elsinore, possessing the brewery&#x27;s electrical system, electrocutes Smith when he is shoved against his light-up world map. Meanwhile, Smith has locked Pam and Bob in a brewery tank and begins filling it with beer; they escape when Bob consumes all the beer, expanding to a cartoonish size.

John Elsinore&#x27;s ghost warns them that Smith has already shipped tainted beer to Oktoberfest and urges them to prevent the beer from being consumed. The police accompany the brothers back to their house to retrieve their dog, Hosehead, to invade the party. Enticed by promises of free beer and sausages, Hosehead leaps into the air and flies over the city like Superman. He crashes into the tent at the celebration and, mistaken for a skunk, frightens people away from the tainted beer. In the end, the McKenzie Brothers are heroes and Pam and Rosie find true love. Bob and Doug are allowed to haul away the contaminated beer, apparently to try to drink it all. The movie ends with an over-the-credits commentary by Bob and Doug about the movie and select crew members as their names scroll by in the credits.

==Cast==
==Production==
In December 1981, Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas released a Bob and Doug McKenzie comedy album, &quot;The Great White North&quot;, which sold a million copies. The success of the McKenzie brothers led the &quot;SCTV&quot; show to center an entire 90-minute episode around the characters, &quot;The Great White North Palace&quot;, which aired in April 1982. Based on this success, they thought about parlaying that success into a feature film. After fellow &quot;SCTV&quot; cast member John Candy got an offer from Universal Pictures to do a film called &quot;Going Berserk&quot;, Moranis and Thomas started talking about writing a screenplay for a Bob and Doug film. Andrew Alexander, executive producer for &quot;SCTV,&quot; reminded them that he had exclusive contracts with the two men and that if they wrote a script, he would sue them. Moranis and Thomas soon found themselves faced with the challenge of expanding their improvisations on &quot;SCTV&quot; from &quot;two guys talking about how hard it was to get parking spaces in donut shops to a full-length story&quot;, Thomas said in an interview.

Moranis and Thomas hired Steve De Jarnatt to write the first draft. Initially, Thomas told De Jarnatt that he wanted to base the film&#x27;s story on &quot;Hamlet&quot;, but De Jarnatt&#x27;s draft was too faithful to the play and he was told be more creative with the parallels. Moranis&#x27; and Thomas&#x27; agents sent the script to various Hollywood studios, and a few days later they had a deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer based not on the script but on record sales, &quot;the breakout potential, and the fact that it was being advertised on a television show&quot;, Thomas remembers. MGM was unhappy with the script because Bob and Doug were improvised characters done in their &quot;comic voices&quot; and they felt that nobody but themselves could write for these characters. Thomas began rewriting the script without Moranis, who was now uncertain about doing the film. After working on the first 50 pages, Moranis took a look at what Thomas had done and they then worked together rewriting it. However, they were not sure just how much they could legally change and did most of the changes in the first third of the script, including the addition of Bob and Doug&#x27;s science fiction film, &quot;Mutants of 2051 A.D.&quot;, which Bob and Doug were shown watching in a movie theatre, causing a riot. Thomas remembers that the script was &quot;far more bizarre and conceptual in the beginning ... if we had been able to rewrite the whole thing, we would have made the whole thing like that&quot;.

Originally, Moranis and Thomas were not going to direct or write the film but ended up doing both with the guidance of executive producer Jack Grossberg, who had produced films by Mel Brooks and Woody Allen. They were given a budget of $5 million. Before filming, all of the major breweries wanted the McKenzie brothers to appear in beer advertisements. The filmmakers had the promise of the Molson Brewery, but once the brewery found out that there was a joke in the film about putting a mouse in a beer bottle, they distanced themselves from the film. The filmmakers were also banned from filming in a Brewers Retail store, and from using the name &quot;Brewers Retail&quot;. The filmmakers instead built a replica of a Brewers Retail store at a cost of more than $45,000, calling it &quot;The Beer Store&quot;. Filming also took place at the Old Fort Brewing Co. in Prince George, British Columbia. The emergency vehicles used during filming were all real Metropolitan Toronto Police squad cars. The ambulances used briefly were on loan from Metropolitan Toronto Ambulance.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Strange Brew&quot; has an approval rating of 76% based on reviews from 25 critics with an average rating of 6.70/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Though lowbrow in intent and outcome, &quot;Strange Brew&quot; effectively mines laughs from its unique premise and likeable stars.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a score of 50 based on six reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.
In her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin wrote: &quot;Anyone who&#x27;s partial to the McKenzies&#x27; humor doubtless has a fondness for beer. The price of a ticket could buy enough beer for an experience at least as memorable as this one.&quot; Gary Arnold, in his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, wrote: &quot;Neither triumph nor fiasco, &quot;Strange Brew&quot; leaves plenty of room for improvement, but I hope Thomas and Moranis get the chance to demonstrate that they&#x27;ve learned a lot from the mixed assortment of nuttiness in their first movie comedy.&quot; In his review for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, Jay Scott wrote: &quot;What&#x27;s terrific about the McKenzie Brothers is their offhand depiction of two English-Canadian working-class dimwits ... and what&#x27;s terrific about the movie is its equally offhand surrealism.&quot;

In 2023, Barry Hertz of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; named the film as one of the 23 best Canadian comedy films ever made.

==Soundtrack album==

The soundtrack album was released in August 1983 by PolyGram and Anthem Records of Canada (ANR 1-1042). (Full title: &quot;The Adventures of Bob and Doug McKenzie: Strange Brew - Excerpts from the Original Soundtrack&quot;). Most of the album consisted of comedy sketches and film dialogue, while the music sampling was usually accompanied by the characters&#x27; commentary. The main title theme was performed by Thomas&#x27; brother, Ian Thomas. The album was produced by Marc Giacomelli, Rick Shurman and Ian Thomas. 
The soundtrack won the Canadian Juno Award for Best Comedy Album in 1984. Moranis and Thomas accepted the award in character at the awards ceremony on 5 December 1984, which was hosted by Joe Flaherty and SCTV alum Andrea Martin.
The album was only available for a short time and currently remains out of print. This was the last album released by the duo.

==Motion picture score==
As with the soundtrack album, the motion picture score was released for a short time and remains out of print. The album runs approximately 63 minutes and was composed and conducted by Charles Fox.

==Book==
To promote the film, a beer-shaped paperback book was released in 1983, &quot;The Adventures of Bob &amp; Doug McKenzie in Strange Brew: The Book About the Movie About the TV Show About the Men!&quot; The book featured pictures of the characters, stills from &quot;Strange Brew&quot;, comics, puzzles and much of the characters&#x27; humor. The book also included a joke library card with the names of numerous Canadian celebrities who had checked it out. The book was only available for a brief period and is currently out of print.

==Cancelled sequel==
A sequel to the film, entitled &quot;Home Brew&quot;, was planned for production in 1999, but financing fell through at the last minute. Co-written by Dave Thomas and Paul Flaherty, the film was to be directed by Flaherty, and Dan Aykroyd was on board to play the part of friend Rick Ripple. Principal photography was to begin on July 19, 1999 in Toronto. At one point, Todd McFarlane was to step in as executive producer to revive financing for the film, but never followed through.

The plot, according to a Maple Palm (Dave Thomas&#x27;s production company) release, would feature Bob and Doug, now working as garbage men, being convinced by a fast-talking insurance salesman (Aykroyd) to get into the microbrewing business.

<doc id="797334" wikidata="Q742787" url="?curid=797334" title="United States Department of the Navy">
<text>The United States Department of the Navy (DON) is one of the three military departments within the Department of Defense of the United States of America. It was established by an Act of Congress on 30 April 1798, at the urging of Secretary of War James McHenry, to provide a government organizational structure to the United States Navy (USN). Since 1834, the department has exercised jurisdiction over the United States Marine Corps (USMC), and during wartime the United States Coast Guard (USCG). These branches remain at all times independent and coequal service branches within the DON. It is led by the secretary of the Navy (SECNAV), a statutory civilian officer. 

The Department of the Navy was an executive department, whose secretary served on the president&#x27;s cabinet, until 1949, when amendments to the National Security Act of 1947 established the Department of Defense as a unified department for all military services; the DON, along with the Department of the Army and Department of the Air Force, became a component of the DoD, subject to the authority, direction and control of the secretary of defense.

From 2001 to 2019, proposals to rename the Department of the Navy to the Department of the Navy and Marine Corps were introduced with wide support in the United States Congress, but failed due to the opposition of Senator and former U.S. Navy officer John McCain.

==Leadership==

The Department of the Navy is headed by the secretary of the Navy, also known as the &quot;SECNAV&quot; in naval jargon, who has the authority to conduct all of the affairs of the department, subject to lawful authority, the secretary of defense, and the president. The secretary of the Navy is appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate. The secretary is assisted by an under secretary of the Navy, four assistant secretaries of the Navy and a general counsel of the Department of the Navy, who are also appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate.

The highest-ranking military officers in the Department of the Navy are the chief of naval operations and the commandant of the Marine Corps, who are the principal military advisors to the Secretary of the Navy. They supervise their respective military services of the Department of the Navy, and in a separate capacity serve as members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They are assisted by a vice chief of naval operations and an assistant commandant of the Marine Corps.

==Composition==
The Department of the Navy comprises two uniformed services: the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps (sometimes collectively called the &quot;naval services&quot; or &quot;sea services&quot;).

The Department of the Navy consists of all elements of the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps. According to Navy Regulations Section 0204-2, the term &quot;Navy Department&quot; refers only to the executive offices at the seat of government.

The Department of the Navy is composed of the following:
* All field activities, headquarters, forces, bases, installations, activities, and functions under the control or supervision of the Secretary of the Navy; and
* When it is operating as a service in the Navy Department, the Coast Guard. (Ordinarily part of the Department of Homeland Security, federal law provides that the Coast Guard may be transferred to the Department of the Navy by the President at any time, or by Congress during time of war)

==Proposed redesignation as the Department of the Navy and Marine Corps==
From 2001 until his death in 2019, Congressman Walter B. Jones Jr. introduced legislation to rename the Department of the Navy as the Department of the Navy and Marine Corps. The legislation would have also renamed the Secretary of the Navy to the Secretary of the Navy and Marine Corps. Congressman Jones put forward the legislation to give the Marine Corps equal recognition with the Navy as part of the Department of the Navy, stating in 2018, &quot;The Marine Corps is an equal member of this department, and therefore, deserves equal recognition in its title.&quot; In 2013, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the cost of a name change to be only $500,000 over several years.

His proposal had strong support in the House of Representatives and Senate, with 98 percent of house members and 80 percent of senators supporting it in 2008. In 2010, it set a record number for cosponsors in the House, with 415 members. The redesignation has been endorsed by Marine Corps and Navy professional associations including the Marine Corps League, Fleet Reserve Association, and Veterans of Foreign Wars. Former commandants of the Marine Corps Generals Alfred M. Gray Jr., Carl Epting Mundy Jr., Charles C. Krulak, James L. Jones, Michael Hagee, and James T. Conway have endorsed the change. Former famous marines have also voiced support including Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North and Gunnery Sergeant R. Lee Ermey, who stated in 2010 &quot;When we die, when mama and dada get that letter of condolence, it would be kind of nice if the Marine Corps was mentioned...just change the letterhead. What&#x27;s the harm in that? These young men and women are fighting and losing their lives for this country. We aren&#x27;t asking for our own department. We are reasonable people. We are just asking for an honorable mention.&quot; Former secretaries of the Navy Paul Nitze and John Howard Dalton have also supported the change.

Despite having consistent support in both the House of Representatives and Senate, the proposal consistently failed to pass due to the intervention of Senator and former Navy officer John McCain, who served as the chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

<text>Hawk Woods is an old-growth forest located in central Athens County, Ohio, United States, outside the city of Athens. The forest comprises of foothills in the Allegheny Plateau region. Adjacent to Strouds Run State Park, the woods now are included in a state nature preserve named the Dale &amp; Jackie Riddle State Nature Preserve.

==Riddle State Nature Preserve==

The preserve is owned and managed by the City of Athens, with the original direction coming from the Athens Conservancy. This Ohio public land was dedicated as a state nature preserve, in part because the Ohio Division of Natural Areas and Preserves donated $50,000 towards the purchase price. The property was purchased from a logging company in 2003 for $550,000. Prior to 2003, the forest had been under private ownership, which kept it isolated from the public for at least 150 years.

The preserve is part of the city&#x27;s east-side Strouds Ridge Preserve project, which to date includes about total. The Athens Conservancy purchased an adjacent tract of land in 2018 to help buffer the forest from invasive species that result from outside development.

As with many other areas in southeast Ohio, the preserve suffers from white-tail deer overpopulation. A deer exclosure was built to demonstrate the effects of grazing pressure from the deer.

The preserve is known to harbor the relatively rare gametophytic fern species, the weft fern, &quot;Trichomanes intricatum&quot;.

<doc id="797347" wikidata="Q1784269" url="?curid=797347" title="Alectryomancy">
<text>Alectryomancy (also called alectoromancy or alectromancy; derivation comes from the and ) is a form of divination in which the diviner observes a bird, several birds, or most preferably a white rooster or cockerel pecking at grain (such as wheat) that the diviner has scattered on the ground. It was the responsibility of the pullularius to feed and keep the birds used. The observer may place grain in the shape of letters and thus discern a divinatory revelation by noting which letters the birds peck at, or the diviner may just interpret the pattern left by the birds&#x27; pecking in randomly scattered grain.

In another version, the observer tethers the bird in the center of a circle, around the perimeter of which is marked the alphabet, with a piece of grain at each letter. For each grain the bird pecks, the observer writes down the letter which that grain represents. The observer also replaces each grain as the bird eats it, so that letters may be repeated. The sequence of letters recorded will presumably contain a message.

This form of divination is related to Ouija, by the random selection of letters; to gyromancy, by the random selection of letters from a circle around the diviner himself; and to orniscopy, divination by the movements of birds.

Alectryomancy is also sacrificing a sacred rooster. The use of the sacred rooster through alectryomancy may be further understood within that religious character and likewise defined as the cockfight or cockfighting with the intent of communication between the gods and man.

==History==
Roosters were commonly used for predictions in different parts of the world, and over the ages different methods were used. The most common and popular form of this divination based on the observation of a rooster eating corn scattered on letters. This practice was used when the sun or the moon was in Aries or Leo. A circle of letters (originally 24 in number, since j, v are the same as i, u) was traced on the ground and laid out with some sort of grain placed on each letter. Next a rooster, usually a white one, was let pick at the grains, thus selecting letters to create a divinatory message or sign. The chosen letters could be either read in order of selection, or rearranged to make an anagram. Sometimes readers got two or three letters and interpreted them. Additional grains replaced those taken by the rooster. It is unknown exactly how long ago this form of mantic arts had been practiced, but can date it back to at least 300 AD with evidence given by Iamblichus, a Syrian Neoplatonist philosopher from Arabian origin. According to legend, the magician Iamblichus used this art to discover the person who should succeed Valens Caesar in the empire, but the bird picking up four of the grains, those which lay on the letters &quot;T h e o&quot;, left it uncertain whether Theodosius, Theodotus, Theodorus, or Theodectes, was the person designated. Valens, however, learning what had been done, put to death several individuals whose names unhappily began with those letters.

=== Roman alectryomancy ===
Alectryomancy was part of a deeply entrenched tradition among the Romans, where the chicken is used for all sorts of divination with the belief that the animal is a soothsayer. For this reason, the chicken figured prominently in public policy since no major decision was made without using the animal in divination rites. Aside from alectryomancy, the chicken was also used to divine the future with diviners trained to read meanings in the bird&#x27;s organs, feather, skin, flesh, and bone.

The Roman chicken divination rituals were complex and conducted with an extraordinary level of organization unparalleled among the ancient civilizations that shared the same practice. One of the earliest forms was developed by the Etruscans, who established an elaborate ritual of alectryomancy using a hen to find answers for life&#x27;s most pressing problems. The process involved a circle, which was divided into twenty parts to represent the Etruscan alphabet and each sector was sprinkled with corn. The bird is placed at the middle and the sequence of its pecking was recorded. Specifically, alectryomancy was used in ancient Rome to identify thieves.

<doc id="797349" wikidata="Q4752658" url="?curid=797349" title="The Bay Boy">
<text>The Bay Boy is a 1984 Canadian drama film. It is a semi-autobiographical film based on director Daniel Petrie&#x27;s experiences of growing up in Glace Bay, a mining town on Cape Breton Island, during the Great Depression. It features the screen debut of Kiefer Sutherland as the film&#x27;s central character, alongside Liv Ullmann as his character&#x27;s mother.

==Plot==
In 1937, Donald Campbell is a sensitive 16-year-old boy. His mother wants him to continue his education after high school and become a priest, but Donald is more interested in girls than prayerbooks. He is also frightened after a visiting priest attempts to molest him.

Meanwhile, when he is not in school, Donald spends his time helping his father dig a bootleg pit; helps care for his older brother, Joe, who was the brightest boy in his grade until he got sick and was left disabled; and pursues Saxon Coldwell, one of police Sergeant Coldwell&#x27;s two daughters. Sergeant Coldwell&#x27;s wife died a few months earlier.

Donald lives a hard-working but fairly happy life, until the night he witnesses Sergeant Coldwell shoot and kill the Jewish couple who are his landlord and landlady. The chief of police is a relative, so Donald feels comfortable admitting that he saw the killing. However, he says that he did not see who did it, because he is afraid of Sergeant Coldwell - especially after Sergeant Coldwell subsequently lets Donald know that he is aware that Donald &quot;did&quot; see who committed the murder (because he could not have seen the shooting without also seeing who did it). When the Sergeant comes home and finds Donald (innocently) visiting with his daughter Dianna, he orders him out of the house but not without hitting him with his belt a few times first. The Sarge turns his attention on Dianna and begins to violently discipline her when Donald snaps and tells him that he is going to the Chief to finally tell him that the Sarge was the murderer. After a short pursuit, Coldwell catches and tries to kill the boy - with the result, his secret is revealed and he is arrested for the murder of the Jewish couple, child abuse, and attempted murder of Donald.

Later, in spite of his strong attraction to both of Coldwell&#x27;s daughters, Donald eagerly loses his virginity to the sexually experienced Mary, the brightest girl in his class, who seduces him in her empty home while the two are studying. They agree to regularly meet to have sex, but this does not lead to any lasting relationship. The Coldwell girls have to move away, and Donald sadly bids farewell to them, while preparing to leave home himself to study. He tells his mother he does not intend to become a priest — which she accepts.

<doc id="797350" wikidata="Q347001" url="?curid=797350" title="Antoine Meillet">
<text>Paul Jules Antoine Meillet (; 11 November 1866 – 21 September 1936) was one of the most important French linguists of the early 20th century. He began his studies at the Sorbonne University, where he was influenced by Michel Bréal, the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, and the members of the . In 1890 he was part of a research trip to the Caucasus, where he studied the Armenian language. After his return, de Saussure had gone back to Geneva, so Meillet continued the series of lectures on comparative linguistics that de Saussure had given.

In 1897 Meillet completed his doctorate, &quot;Research on the Use of the Genitive-Accusative in Old Slavonic&quot;. In 1902 he took a chair in Armenian at the and took under his wing Hrachia Adjarian, who would become the founder of modern Armenian dialectology. In 1905 Meillet was elected to the , where he taught on the history and structure of Indo-European languages. One of his most-quoted statements is that &quot;anyone wishing to hear how Indo-Europeans spoke should come and listen to a Lithuanian peasant.&quot; He worked closely with linguists Paul Pelliot and Robert Gauthiot.

Today Meillet is remembered as the mentor of an entire generation of linguists and philologists who would become central to French linguistics in the twentieth century, such as Émile Benveniste, Georges Dumézil, and André Martinet.

In 1921, with the help of linguists Paul Boyer and , he founded the .

== Historical linguistics == 
Today, Meillet is known for his contribution to historical linguistics. He is notable for having coined and formalized the concept of &quot;grammaticalisation&quot; (influential but still controversial today) to denote what he viewed as the process of innovation by which autonomous words ended up as &quot;grammatical agents&quot;. Subsequent to the further development and popularization of the concept by Jerzy Kuryłowicz and further development in the late 20th century, it would become a significant element of functionalist linguistics.

=== Homeric studies ===
At the Sorbonne, from 1924, Meillet supervised Milman Parry. In 1923, a year before Parry began his studies with Meillet, the latter wrote the following (which, in the first of his two French theses, Parry quotes):

Meillet offered the opinion that oral-formulaic composition might be a distinctive feature of orally transmitted epics (which the &quot;Iliad&quot; was said to be). He suggested to Parry that he observe the mechanics of a living oral tradition to confirm whether that suggestion was valid; he also introduced Parry to the Slovenian scholar Matija Murko, who had written extensively about the heroic epic tradition in Serbo-Croatian and particularly in Bosnia with the help of phonograph recordings. From Parry&#x27;s resulting research in Bosnia, the records of which are now housed at Harvard University, he and his student Albert Lord revolutionized Homeric scholarship.

=== Language controversies ===

Meillet has been accused of meddling politics with his observation of languages. He had negative views on German and especially on Hungarian. Hungarian, he claimed, was too difficult a language full of loanwords and not capable of being a culture bearer (in a way that he claimed other Finno-Ugric languages were unable to become such). His views on Hungarian provoked a critical response from the Hungarian writer Dezső Kosztolányi.

== International languages ==
Meillet supported the use of an international auxiliary language. In his book (&#x27;The Pursuit of the Perfect Language in the Culture of Europe&#x27;), Umberto Eco cites Meillet as saying: &quot;Any kind of theoretical discussion is useless, Esperanto is functioning&quot;. In addition, Meillet was a consultant with the International Auxiliary Language Association, which presented Interlingua in 1951.

<doc id="797360" wikidata="Q59697" url="?curid=797360" title="Hesperus">
<text>In Greek mythology, Hesperus (; ) is the Evening Star, the planet Venus in the evening. A son of the dawn goddess Eos (Roman Aurora), he is the half-brother of her other son, Phosphorus (also called Eosphorus; the &quot;Morning Star&quot;). Hesperus&#x27; Roman equivalent is Vesper (cf. &quot;evening&quot;, &quot;supper&quot;, &quot;evening star&quot;, &quot;west&quot;). By one account, Hesperus&#x27; father was Cephalus, a mortal, while Phosphorus was the star god Astraeus. Other sources, however, state that Hesperus was the brother of Atlas, and thus the son of Iapetus.

== Variant names ==
Hesperus is the personification of the &quot;evening star&quot;, the planet Venus in the evening. His name is sometimes conflated with the names for his brother, the personification of the planet as the &quot;morning star&quot; Eosphorus (Greek , &quot;bearer of dawn&quot;) or Phosphorus (Ancient Greek: , &quot;bearer of light&quot;, often translated as &quot;Lucifer&quot; in Latin), since they are all personifications of the same planet Venus. &quot;Heosphoros&quot; in the Greek Septuagint and &quot;Lucifer&quot; in Jerome&#x27;s Latin Vulgate were used to translate the Hebrew &quot;Helel&quot; (Venus as the brilliant, bright or shining one), &quot;son of Shahar (Dawn)&quot; in the Hebrew version of Isaiah 14:12.

Eosphorus/Hesperus was said to be the father of Ceyx and Daedalion. In some sources, he is also said to be the father of the Hesperides.

Maurus Servius Honoratus, in his commentaries on Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Eclogues&quot;, mentions that Hesperus inhabited Mount Oeta in Thessaly and that there he had loved the young Hymenaeus, son of Dionysus and Ariadne. Servius makes no distinction between the Evening Star and the Morning Star, calling them both Hesperus and the Lucifer of Ida.

== &quot;Hesperus is Phosphorus&quot; ==

In the philosophy of language, &quot;Hesperus is Phosphorus&quot; is a famous sentence in relation to the semantics of proper names. Gottlob Frege used the terms &quot;the evening star&quot; (&quot;der Abendstern&quot;) and &quot;the morning star&quot; (&quot;der Morgenstern&quot;) to illustrate his distinction between sense and reference, and subsequent philosophers changed the example to &quot;Hesperus is Phosphorus&quot; so that it utilized proper names. Saul Kripke used the sentence to posit that the knowledge of something necessary (in this case the identity of Hesperus and Phosphorus) could be empirical rather than knowable &quot;a priori&quot;.

<doc id="797363" wikidata="Q158069" url="?curid=797363" title="Olympia (1938 film)">
<text>Olympia is a 1938 German documentary film written, directed and produced by Leni Riefenstahl, which documented the 1936 Summer Olympics, held in the Olympic Stadium in Berlin during the Nazi period. The film was released in two parts: Olympia 1. Teil — Fest der Völker (Festival of Nations) (126 minutes) and Olympia 2. Teil — Fest der Schönheit (Festival of Beauty) (100 minutes). The 1936 Summer Olympics torch relay, as devised for the Games by the secretary general of the Organizing Committee, Dr. Carl Diem, is shown in the film.

&quot;Olympia&quot; is controversial due to its political context and propaganda value. However, the techniques Riefenstahl employed are almost universally admired and had a lasting influence on film and television coverage of sport events. &quot;Olympia&quot; appears on many lists of the greatest films of all time, including &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;All-Time 100 Movies&quot;.

==Production==
The Nazis planned on using the 1936 Summer Olympics as a piece of propaganda. Riefenstahl claimed that the film was commissioned by the International Olympic Committee, but it was financed entirely by the government using a company named Olympia Film GmbH. The Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda oversaw the production of the film. &quot;Olympia&quot; prominently depicted the Nazi idea of Strength Through Joy.

Joseph Goebbels discussed making the film with Leni Riefenstahl on 28 June 1935, after she received an award for &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;. They discussed it further in August and October. Goebbels, Adolf Hitler, and Carl Diem were in agreement that Riefenstahl was the best person to direct the film. She was initially given 1.5 million ℛ︁ℳ︁, but this grew to 2.35 million ℛ︁ℳ︁.

Many advanced motion picture techniques, which later became industry standards but which were groundbreaking at the time, were employed, including unusual camera angles, smash cuts, extreme close-ups and placing tracking shot rails within the bleachers. Although restricted to six camera positions on the stadium field, Riefenstahl set up cameras in as many other places as she could, including in the grandstands. She attached automatic cameras to balloons, including instructions to return the film to her, and she also placed automatic cameras in boats during practice runs. Amateur photography was used to supplement that of the professionals along the course of races. Perhaps the greatest innovation seen in &quot;Olympia&quot; was the use of an underwater camera. The camera followed divers through the air and, as soon as they hit the water, the cameraman dived down with them, all the while changing focus and aperture.

Walter Frentz and Hans Ertl were among the film&#x27;s camera crew. Riefenstahl argued with a referee who refused to let her cameraman Gustav Lantschner film the hammer throw competition. She complained about this to Goebbels who dismissed her as a &quot;hysterical woman&quot; and was not allowed to return to the stadium until she apologized to the referee.

&quot;Paris-soir&quot; incorrectly claimed that Goebbels slapped Riefenstahl, called her Jewish, and that she fled to Switzerland.

Riefenstahl edited the film over the course of two years.

==Release==
The premiere had to be postponed due to the &quot;Anschluss&quot;. Riefenstahl proposed releasing the film on Hitler&#x27;s birthday. &quot;Olympia&quot; was approved by the censors on 14 April 1938, and released on 20 April, Adolf Hitler&#x27;s 49th birthday. It had a profit of RM 114,066.45 by 1943.

Riefenstahl toured the United States, during which she met Henry Ford and Walt Disney, in an attempt to distribute the film there. However, Kristallnacht and protests from organizations including the Jewish Labor Committee and Hollywood Anti-Nazi League doomed her efforts. &quot;Olympia&quot; was given an English-dubbed American release by Excelsior Pictures after the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact.

There had been few screenings of &quot;Olympia&quot; in English-speaking countries upon its original release. It was re-released in the United States in 1948 under the title &quot;Kings of the Olympics&quot; in a truncated version acquired from Germany by the U.S. Office of Alien Property Custodian and severely edited without Riefenstahl&#x27;s involvement. In 1955 Riefenstahl agreed to remove three minutes of Hitler footage for screening at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. The same version was also screened on West German television and in cinemas around the world.

==Reception==
The reaction to the film in Germany was enthusiastic, and it was received with acclaim and accolades around the world. In 1960, Riefenstahl&#x27;s peers voted &quot;Olympia&quot; one of the 10 best films of all time. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; recognised the film as &quot;even more technically dazzling&quot; than &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; described the film as &quot;visually ravishing ... A number of sequences in the supposedly documentary Olympia, notably those devoted to the high-diving competition, become less and less concerned with record and more and more abstract: as some of the divers hit the water, the visual interest of patterns of movement takes over.&quot;

American film critic Richard Corliss observed in &quot;Time&quot; that &quot;the matter of Riefenstahl &#x27;the Nazi director&#x27; is worth raising so it can be dismissed. [I]n the hallucinatory documentary &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; ... [she] painted Adolf Hitler as a Wagnerian deity ... But that was in 1934–35. In [&quot;Olympia&quot;] Riefenstahl gave the same heroic treatment to Jesse Owens.&quot;

==Accolades==
The film won several awards;

* National Film Prize (1937–1938)
* Greek Sports Prize (1938)
* Olympic Gold Medal from the International Olympic Committee (1939)
* Lausanne International Film Festival (1948) — Olympic Diploma

==In popular culture==
* In the 2016 biographical film about Jesse Owens, &quot;Race&quot;, the filming at the Olympic Games is depicted with Riefenstahl constantly quarreling with Goebbels about her artistic decisions, especially over filming Jesse Owens, who is proving a politically embarrassing refutation of Nazi Germany&#x27;s claims about Aryan athletic supremacy.
* Neue Deutsche Härte band Rammstein released a cover of Depeche Mode&#x27;s song &quot;Stripped&quot; in 1998. The song&#x27;s music video is made from footage from &quot;Olympia&quot;.

<text>A fleet or naval fleet is a large formation of warships – the largest formation in any navy – controlled by one leader. A fleet at sea is the direct equivalent of an army on land.

==Purpose==
In the modern sense, fleets are usually, but not necessarily, permanent formations and are generally assigned to a particular ocean or sea. Most fleets are named after that ocean or sea, but the convention in the United States Navy is to use numbers.

A fleet is typically commanded by an admiral, who is often also a commander in chief. Still, many fleets have been or are commanded by vice admirals or rear admirals. Most fleets are divided into several squadrons, each under a subordinate admiral. Those squadrons, in turn, are often divided into divisions. In the Age of Sail, Royal Navy fleets were divided into van, center, and rear squadrons, named after each squadron&#x27;s place in the line of battle. In more modern times, the squadrons are typically composed of homogeneous groups of the same class of warship, such as battleships or cruisers.

Since many smaller navies contain a single fleet, the term &quot;the fleet&quot; is often synonymous with &quot;the navy&quot;.

Multinational fleets are not uncommon in naval history. For example, several nations made up the Holy League fleet at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, and a Franco-Spanish fleet faced the British Royal Navy at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. In modern times, NATO has formed standing combined fleets and operations from several national navies such as Operation Active Endeavour.

==Modern fleets==

Modern fleets combine surface warships, submarines, support ships, and ship-based aircraft to conduct naval operations at sea. The largest naval powers operate aircraft carriers as their fleets&#x27; primary capital ships, with battleships having become obsolete since the Second World War. These formations are typically organised as carrier battle groups, with the task force centred around the aircraft carrier and its complement of aircraft. Modern fleets such as these (and those without carriers) are generally understood to be blue water, or oceanic, green water, or littoral fleets as opposed to brown water or coastal/riverine forces. The fleets of larger navies are usually divided into smaller numbered or named fleets based on geographic operating areas or administrative groupings of the same type of ships.

Modern fleets are usually administrative units. Individual task forces are formed to conduct specific operations.

In fictional literary works and/or media, most notably in science fiction, the term &#x27;fleet&#x27; has also been used for a group of space-faring vessels used for interstellar travel.

<doc id="797371" wikidata="Q274931" url="?curid=797371" title="Émile Benveniste">
<text>Émile Benveniste (; 27 May 1902 – 3 October 1976) was a French structural linguist and semiotician. He is best known for his work on Indo-European languages and his critical reformulation of the linguistic paradigm established by Ferdinand de Saussure.

==Biography==
Benveniste was born in Aleppo, Aleppo Vilayet, Ottoman Syria to a Sephardi family. His father sent him to Paris to undertake rabbinical studies, but he left the Rabbinical School after receiving his baccalauréat, and enrolled in the École pratique des hautes études. There he studied under Antoine Meillet, a former student of Saussure, and Joseph Vendryes, completing his degree in 1920. He would return to the École pratique des hautes études in 1927 as a director of studies, and would receive his doctorate there in 1935, with his major thesis on the formation of noun roots, and his secondary thesis on the Avestan infinitive. Following Meillet&#x27;s death in 1936, he was elected to the Chair of Comparative Grammar in the Collège de France in 1937. He held his seat at the Collège de France until his death, but ceased lecturing in December 1969, after suffering a stroke that left him aphasic. Earlier that year he had been elected as the first President of the International Association for Semiotic Studies, and stayed nominally in that position until 1972. Benveniste died in a nursing home in Versailles, aged 74.

==Career==
At the start of his career, his highly specialised and technical work limited his influence to a small circle of scholars. In the late thirties, he aroused some controversy for challenging the influential Saussurian notion of the sign, that posited a binary distinction between the phonic shape of any given word (&quot;signifier&quot;) and the idea associated with it (&quot;signified&quot;). Saussure argued that the relationship between the two was psychological, and purely arbitrary. Benveniste challenged this model in his &quot;Nature du signe linguistique&quot;.

The publication of his monumental text, &quot;Problèmes de linguistique générale&quot; or &quot;Problems in General Linguistics&quot;, would elevate his position to much wider recognition. The two volumes of this work appeared in 1966 and 1974 respectively. The book exhibits not only scientific rigour but also a lucid style accessible to the layman, consisting of various writings culled from a period of more than twenty-five years. In Chapter 5, &quot;Animal Communication and Human Language&quot;, Benveniste repudiated behaviourist linguistic interpretations by demonstrating that human speech, unlike the so-called languages of bees and other animals, cannot be merely reduced to a stimulus-response system.

The I–you polarity is another important development explored in the text. The third person acts under the conditions of possibility of this polarity between the first and second persons. Narration and description illustrate this.

:&quot;&quot;I&quot; signifies &quot;the person who is uttering the present instance of the discourse containing &quot;I&quot;.&quot; This instance is unique by definition and has validity only in its uniqueness ... &quot;I&quot; can only be identified by the instance of discourse that contains it and by that alone.&quot;

&quot;You&quot;, on the other hand, is defined in this way:
:&quot;by introducing the situation of &quot;address,&quot; we obtain a symmetrical definition for &quot;you&quot; as &quot;the individual spoken to in the present instance of discourse containing the linguistic instance of &quot;you&quot;.&quot; These definitions refer to &quot;I&quot; and &quot;you&quot; as a category of language and are related to their position in language.&quot; — from &quot;Problems in General Linguistics&quot;

A pivotal concept in Benveniste&#x27;s work is the distinction between the &quot;énoncé&quot; and the &quot;énonciation&quot;, which grew out of his study on pronouns. The &quot;énoncé&quot; is the statement independent of context, whereas the &quot;énonciation&quot; is the act of stating as tied to context. In essence, this distinction moved Benveniste to see language itself as a &quot;discursive instance&quot;, i.e., fundamentally as discourse. This discourse is, in turn, the actual utilisation, the very enactment, of language.

One of the founders of structuralism, Roland Barthes, attended Benveniste&#x27;s seminars at École Pratique. Pierre Bourdieu was instrumental in publishing Benveniste&#x27;s other major work, &quot;Vocabulaire des Institutions Indo-Européennes&quot; in his series &quot;Le Sens commun&quot; at radical publisher Les Éditions de Minuit (1969). The title is misleading: it is not a “vocabulary”, but rather a comprehensive and comparative analysis of key social behaviors and institutions across Germanic, Romance-speaking, Greco-Roman, and Indo-Iranian cultures, using the words (&quot;vocables&quot;) that denote them as points of entry. It makes use of philology, anthropology, phenomenology and sociology. A number of contemporary philosophers (e.g.  Giorgio Agamben, Barbara Cassin, Nicole Loraux, Philippe-Joseph Salazar, François Jullien, Marc Crépon) have often referred to Benveniste&#x27;s &quot;Vocabulaire&quot; and are inspired by his methodology and the distinction he draws between meaning (&quot;signification&quot;) and what is referred to (&quot;désignation&quot;). Jacques Derrida&#x27;s famous work on &quot;hospitality, the Other, the enemy&quot; is an explicit &quot;gloss&quot; on Benveniste&#x27;s ground-breaking study of host/hostility/hospitality in the &quot;Vocabulary&quot;.

<text>Coney Island USA is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit arts organization founded in 1980 that is dedicated to the cultural and economic revitalization of the Coney Island neighborhood of Brooklyn in New York City.

Coney Island USA&#x27;s headquarters building in the heart of Coney Island&#x27;s amusement district houses a theater in which the organization presents &quot;Sideshows by the Seashore&quot;, a showcase for performers with unusual talents that runs continuously during the warmer months, as well as the Coney Island Museum.

The Coney Island Museum features artifacts and memorabilia about the amusement park, beach and neighborhood&#x27;s history and culture, as well as changing exhibits of art and culture. The museum is open seasonally.

Coney Island USA is also notable as the organizer of the annual Coney Island Mermaid Parade, the first of which took place in 1983.

Coney Island USA was founded in 1980 by Costa Mantis, Jane Savitt-Tennen and Dick D. Zigun. Over the years, Coney Island USA has been funded, in part, by the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, the New York Council for the Humanities, the Brooklyn Borough President, and New York City Council member Mark Treyger and others.

In 2025, Coney Island USA joined the Coney Island History Project and other Coney Island community organizations in opposing the casino proposed by Thor Equities for Coney Island. The Brooklyn Paper quoted Coney Island USA Executive Director Patrick Wall on the issue: “We’re asking for a giant fort to come and plop down on top of our entire amusement district across three blocks. That’s crazy! It’s going to keep people locked in, they’ve got food, they’ve got accommodations, they’ve got entertainment. They’re never going to come outside, they’re never going to give us money.”

<text>A living museum, also known as a living history museum, is a type of museum which recreates historical settings to simulate a past time period, providing visitors with an experiential interpretation of history. It is a type of museum that recreates to the fullest extent conditions of a culture, natural environment or historical period, in an example of living history.

== Costumed historians ==
A costumed historian has many roles and responsibilities at historical sites. In addition to conducting tours, interpreting a space, or portraying a historical character, they are also involved in the research process that aides the site interpretation. Full-time staff interpreters develop public programs, tours, and write scripts for interpretative panels, pamphlets, and videos. They often work closely with the curatorial and educational staff to collaborate on ideas about collection tours, school tours, educational programs, and site interpretation. Supervisors are also responsible for the extensive training of new staff members, volunteers, and interns.

As a career, historical interpretation positions do not usually require the applicant to have a specific degree or background. Prospective employers are looking for interpreters who have good communication skills and are comfortable speaking in front of large audiences. They should also possess strong research and writing skills. While a master&#x27;s degree is not usually required, a background or degree in history, public history, museum studies, or education is beneficial. The average salary for full-time museum workers in the United States was $44,430 in 2019. A large part of the competencies acquired by the interpreter are gained through experience and on-the-job-training at each individual site.

== Interpretation ==

The main interpretative technique of living history museums, aside from exhibitions, are the use of costumed interpreters or historians. Costumed historians make history come alive through interactions that formulate social, cultural, and political connections with the past. There are two different types of costumed interpretation utilized at living history sites: first-person and third-person interpretation.

In first-person interpretation, the costumed historian portrays a specific historical character. The historian adopts speech patterns, mannerisms, worldviews, and attitudes appropriate to the character being portrayed. Since the interpreters are representing a historical character during a particular time period, their knowledge and therefore how they interact with the public, is limited to their designated character and historic time period. For example, interpreters at the English Village at Plimoth Plantation are first-person interpreters who portray some of the original residents of Plymouth Colony. For example, a costumed historian will say that &quot;I am making cornbread&quot;.

Third-person interpretation does not limit the costumed historian to a particular historical character or time period and maintain a working knowledge of both the past and present. Instead, they represent a gender, status, and occupation. Plimoth Plantation employs third-person interpretation at the Wampanoag Homesite where, although dressed in historically accurate clothing, the costumed historians speak from a modern perspective about Wampanoag history and culture. For example, a costumed historian will say that &quot;They ate a healthy, seasonally varied diet that included corn, beans, squash, fish, venison, fruit, and vegetables&quot;.

Both first- and third-person costumed historians participate in demonstrating and performing daily tasks and crafts of the time period. Most interpreters at living history sites have a background in history, public history, museum studies, or education, and conduct significant historical research in order to effectively and accurately provide interpretation to the public.

Freeman Tilden, a National Park Service Interpreter known as the father of interpretation, wrote Interpreting Our Heritage in 1957. His book is one of the first comprehensive instructional texts on the subject of interpretation and outlines six basic interpretative principles that are still taught today in interpretive training sessions nationwide. The six principles of interpretation are:

#interpretation that does not somehow relate to what is on display or being described to enhance the visitor experience will be sterile,
#information is not interpretation but all interpretation includes information,
#interpretation is teachable art,
#the main aim of interpretation is not instruction, but provocation,
#interpretation should aim to present a whole instead of simply a part, and
#interpretation geared toward children should follow a fundamentally different approach rather than a dilution of the presentation given to adults.

== Scholarship ==

Scholars and museum professionals have done significant work exploring the different interpretation styles, how the museum presents and explains the role of the costumed historian, and how the interaction between visitor and costumed interpreter impacts the visitor&#x27;s overall museum experience. Jay Anderson, in his 1984 book, Time Machines: The World of Living History, defines living history as an “attempt by people to simulate life in another time” and stresses its importance within American culture. He argues that living history museums function as powerful “time machines” that transport visitors both mentally and emotionally into the past for a unique learning experience. Anderson divides the recreated historical experience enacted at living history museums into three categories based on their purpose and outcome: educational for museum purposes, research for archaeological inquiries, and recreation for entertainment.

== Authenticity ==
A major concern at living history museums is the idea of authenticity. Living historians define authenticity as perfect simulation between a living history activity and the piece of the past it is meant to re-create. A major difference between living history museums and other historical interpretation is that at living history sites, the interpretation is usually given in the first-person present, versus the third-person past narratives given at other sites. Living history museums seek to convey to visitors the experience of what it felt like to live in the past. Critics of living history museums argue that replication of past states of mind is impossible, and therefore living history is inherently inaccurate.

The relative authenticity of living history farms varies significantly. At its best, they most accurately reflect the past appropriate to the time period while at their worst they may portray gross inaccuracies in an attempt to portray a certain idealized image. One such example is Wichita&#x27;s Old Cowtown Museum, which in its small, rural representation of Wichita resembles Western movies and Wild West myths more than the bustling urban city that Wichita quickly became. This living history narrative developed because of the availability of small historical buildings and inaccurate replicas, prodding from the city, and the influence of Hollywood. Museum professionals must grapple with these issues of conflicting audience and institutional needs which impact the overall structure of living history. Living history museums have also been criticized for their ability to teach, particularly from those that believe &quot;living history is antiquarian, idyllic, or downright misleading.&quot; In response to this question, the Association for Living History, Farm, and Agricultural Museums (ALHFAM) has stated that they distinguish between an unchanging past and an interpretation of a constantly changing past. It additionally was affirmed by the ALHFAM that they also support Dr. Scott Magelssen&#x27;s idea that living history museums produce history as others do, such as teachers in classrooms, authors in monographs, and even directors in film.

<doc id="797382" wikidata="Q4882325" url="?curid=797382" title="Belfast Royal Academy">
<text>The Belfast Royal Academy (commonly shortened to ) is the oldest school in the city of Belfast, Northern Ireland. It is a co-educational, non-denominational voluntary grammar school in north Belfast. The Academy is one of 8 schools in Northern Ireland whose Head is a member of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference.

== History ==
The Academy was founded in 1785 by James Crombie. Originally situated near St Anne&#x27;s Parish Church in what is now Academy Street, it moved to its current location on the Cliftonville Road in 1880. For more than a century the school was named &quot;Belfast Academy&quot;. On 27 November 1887, Queen Victoria granted permission for the school to style itself &quot;Belfast Royal Academy&quot;, and its name was officially changed in November 1888.

=== &quot;Barring out&quot; incident ===
On 12 April 1792, a group of schoolboys (eight boarders and two day boys) barricaded themselves in the mathematics classroom. In doing so they &quot;declared war against the masters until their requests should be granted&quot;. As they expected to be holed up for some time, they had taken a quantity of provisions from the Academy kitchens; further they managed to arm themselves with 5 pistols and a large quantity of gunpowder and shot. A letter, headed “Liberty Hall”, was sent by the students to their masters in which they stated they would not surrender until their demands had been met.
The Academy authorities, in an attempt to break the siege, sent workmen to break down the door and pour water down the chimney, without success, as the boys opened fire on them.
Finally the Sovereign of Belfast, William Bristow, was summoned, he read the Riot Act to the boys but failed to end the barring out, and one of the boys opened fire on him.

The siege ended by negotiation between the governors and the boys soon after; the boys, however, refused to show remorse and were later beaten, all leaving the school shortly following their punishment.
===Admission of girls===
Originally a boys&#x27; school, girls were admitted to the secondary level in 1900 but taught separately. Mixed classes were introduced in 1924.

== Headmasters ==
* James Crombie (1785–1790)
* William Bruce (1790–1822)
* James Gray (1822–1826)
* Reuben John Bryce (1826–1880)
* William Collier (1880–1890)
* T. W. Foster (1890–1898)
* T. R. Collier (1898–1923)
* Alexander Foster (1923–1942)
* John Darbyshire (1943–1968)
* Louis Lord (1968–1980)
* William Sillery (1980–2000)
* William Young (2000–2008)
* Moore Dickson (2009–2017)
* Hilary Woods (2017–present)

== School emblem ==
The school emblem comprises the rose, the thistle and the shamrock, along with the Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom, the Arms of the City of Belfast and those of the province of Ulster. The three significant dates mark the foundation of the school by James Crombie in 1785, the transfer to the present site in 1880 and the approval by Queen Victoria of the designation Belfast Royal Academy in 1888.

== Preparatory department ==

The school&#x27;s preparatory department, Ben Madigan Preparatory School, is located on the Antrim Road in the shadow of Cave Hill. Originally opened in 1829, it moved to its current site in 1965. A pre-prep was opened in 1998.

== House system ==
When a pupil enters the Academy they are placed into one of the four houses: Shaw, Currie, Pottinger or Cairns, named after past pupils: James Shaw, Donald Currie, Henry Pottinger, and Hugh Cairns, 1st Earl Cairns, for whom the house colours are yellow, green, red, and blue, respectively; each pupil must wear a tie with a stripe of their house colour on it.

== Honours system ==

As a pupil progresses through the Academy, they can earn honours through excellence in sport and/or the arts. There are minor honours, allowing a pupil to wear a minor honours tie, (green owls) intermediate honours (blue owls) and major honours (gold owls). In addition, a pupil gaining intermediate honours is entitled to wear a black blazer with maroon braid surrounding a golden school badge. A pupil gaining major honours in sport is entitled to wear a distinctive maroon blazer with blue braid and a gold school badge. Pupils who receive major honours in the arts, be it for music, drama, or art &amp; design are entitled to wear a blue blazer with maroon braid and a gold school badge. The honour, e.g. Cricket XI 2004 or Music 2002, is stitched in gold letters under the badge for both intermediate and major honours.

<text>Frank Hamilton Newcomb (10 November 184620 February 1934) was a United States Revenue Cutter Service commodore, best known for his actions at the Battle of Cárdenas during the Spanish–American War.

==Early life and education==
Newcomb was born in Boston, Massachusetts on 10 November 1846, the oldest of three children. His father, Hiram Newcomb was a merchant sea captain and Frank sailed on his father&#x27;s ship at an early age. At the age of sixteen he served on another merchant ship that made an around the world trading voyage.

==Career==

===U.S. Navy===
In 1863 at the age of 17, Newcomb received a U.S. Navy officer&#x27;s appointment as acting master&#x27;s mate aboard the mortar schooner . As a part of the Atlantic Blockading Squadron during the American Civil War, &quot;Para&quot; served through many engagements. In early 1865, Newcomb was transferred to , which was a coaling vessel home-ported at Port Royal, South Carolina. At the conclusion of the war, Newcomb resigned from the Navy and attempted to make a living as a merchant and as an officer on a merchant ship. He made trips to Europe and the West Coast, but due to a decline in United States merchant shipping after the war he was not able to make a living as a merchant mariner. In 1869, he began working for the Alabama and Chattanooga Railroad and later the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad.

===U.S. Revenue Cutter Service===
Desiring to return to a sea career, Newcomb applied for and received a commission in the United States Revenue Cutter Service. He was commissioned as a third lieutenant on 8 March 1873 and assigned initially to . &quot;Petrel&quot; was sold on 21 October 1873 and Newcomb was transferred to USRC &quot;W.H. Crawford&quot;, reporting aboard 25 November 1873. Newcomb was transferred to based at Milwaukee, Wisconsin in June 1876. He was promoted to second lieutenant on 25 March 1878. In 1879, Newcomb was appointed as an assistant inspector for the United States Life-Saving Service by USLSS superintendent Sumner I. Kimball. While he served in this capacity he was placed in charge of based in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, and he used the boat to aid in inspecting USLSS stations in south Virginia and North Carolina. The senior inspector, Lieutenant Charles F. Shoemaker and Newcomb helped establish an all black crew located on North Carolina&#x27;s Outer Banks at Pea Island because some of the white crews didn&#x27;t want to serve in mixed race crews. Newcomb appointed a locally recognized surfman, Richard Etheridge as the Pea Island Life-Saving Station head keeper. On 1 July 1885, he was assigned to . On 7 December 1886, he began serving on . On 7 November 1889, Newcomb was transferred to . On 16 May 1891 Newcomb was promoted to first lieutenant.

====Spanish–American War====

As a first lieutenant, Newcomb reported aboard in September 1897 as the commanding officer. &quot;Hudson&quot; was homeported at New York City&#x27;s harbor at that time. Newcomb received orders assigning &quot;Hudson&quot; to the Navy and to report to Norfolk, Virginia, for outfitting because of the growing tensions with Spain over the sinking of the on 15 February 1898. Although more of a tugboat than a combat vessel, &quot;Hudson&quot; was equipped at Norfolk Naval Shipyard with two six-pound rapid fire guns fore and aft and a Colt automatic machine gun on the aft deckhouse. She also received .) armor plating around the pilothouse and deckhouse. On 23 April, &quot;Hudson&quot; departed Norfolk with orders to report to the staging area for Cuban operations at Key West, Florida. War with Spain had been declared 21 April while the cutter was in the shipyard.

On 11 May 1898, in one of the first actions off the coast of Cuba, Newcomb distinguished himself and his ship in the Battle of Cárdenas. The U.S. Navy torpedo boat and USRC &quot;Hudson&quot; had been shelling Spanish positions. &quot;Winslow&quot; had been hit multiple times. Half her complement was dead or wounded and her captain gravely wounded. Newcomb ordered &quot;Hudson&quot; to tow &quot;Winslow&quot; out of harm&#x27;s way. Under heavy fire, she did just that, despite nearly foundering on shoals trying to fasten a line to &quot;Hudson&quot;. Newcomb&#x27;s actions saved &quot;Winslow&quot; from destruction and possible capture. After the action at Cárdenas, &quot;Hudson&quot; patrolled the waters near Cárdenas Bay, capturing three vessels carrying stores while destroying a fourth. Newcomb and the crew of &quot;Hudson&quot; returned to her homeport of New York City in mid-August 1898 and a rousing welcome and a recommendation by President William McKinley to Congress to issue a gold medal for Newcomb, silver medals for his officers, and bronze medals for his enlisted crew.

A joint resolution by Congress carried out the president&#x27;s wishes and medals were struck for Newcomb, his officers and men. Newcomb received the only gold medal awarded by Congress for participation in the Spanish–American War.

===Later USRCS service===
After Newcomb&#x27;s return to New York and the receipt of the Cardenas Medal, he was awarded seven additional points on the Revenue Cutter Service&#x27;s promotion system which helped him get promoted to captain in 1902. He later served as the Supervisor of Anchorages for New York Harbor, and Superintendent of Construction of Life-Saving Stations for the Atlantic Coast and Great Lakes. On 8 May 1908 he was promoted to the rank of senior captain. At age 64, Newcomb reached mandatory retirement age and he retired with the rank of captain-commandant on 10 November 1910.

==Later life and death==
In 1927, Newcomb received the rank of commodore on the U.S. Coast Guard Retired List.
Newcomb died of natural causes at Los Angeles, California, on 19 February 1934. He is interred at Arlington National Cemetery with his wife, Rose Prioleau Newcomb (1863–1951.

==Legacy==
The United States Navy destroyer USS &quot;Newcomb&quot; (DD-586) was named in his honor.

In 2014, the Coast Guard&#x27;s Command and Operations School renamed its &quot;Top Conn&quot; award to the Newcomb award. It is awarded to the graduate of each Prospective Commanding Officer / Prospective Executive Officer class that best demonstrates the excellence in leadership, mentorship, and inspiration exemplified by Newcomb.

<text>Edward Leon Budde ( ; November 2, 1940 – December 19, 2023) was an American professional football guard. He played his entire career for the Kansas City Chiefs in the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL).

==Early life==
Budde was born in Highland Park, Michigan, on November 2, 1940. After graduating from Denby High School, he played for Michigan State University in 1960 as an offensive tackle, receiving first-team All-American honors two years later during his tenure there.

==Professional career==
Budde was drafted as the first-round pick for both the Philadelphia Eagles and the American Football League&#x27;s Kansas City Chiefs in the 1963 NFL and AFL drafts, respectively, before ultimately signing with the Chiefs.
He played for the Kansas City Chiefs for 14 years as the left offensive guard, longer than any other Chief except for punter Jerrel Wilson. Through his first nine seasons, Budde did not miss a single start, playing in 177 games in his career. Budde was 6&#x27;5 and 265 pounds (196 cm; 120 kg) with an unusual stance, in that he put his left hand down instead of the usual right. Budde and the Chiefs won two American Football League Championships (1966 and 1969) and a world championship in Super Bowl IV after defeating the NFL&#x27;s Minnesota Vikings 23–7.

Budde was selected to the American Football League All-Star team in 1963, 1966, 1967, 1968, and 1969, and played in six AFL All-Star games. He was selected for the &quot;Sporting News&quot; AFL All-League team in 1969. In 1968, Budde became the first offensive lineman to be selected by the Associated Press as an Offensive Player of the Week.

Budde was named a member of the All-Time All-AFL Team First-team in 1970. He retired after the 1976 season and was inducted into the Chiefs&#x27; Hall of Honor in 1984.

==Personal life and death==
Budde was married to his wife for over 60 years; together they had three children. One of their children, Brad, was an All-American with USC and also played in the NFL for the Chiefs, the only father-son combination to be first-round draft picks for the same NFL team.

Budde died on December 19, 2023, at age 83.

<text>The following was a list of stations on the Metropolitana di Bologna, an old project of underground in Bologna. The project of the underground had stalled after a dispute between Regione Emilia-Romagna, the local government and the central government. A new project has been approved in 2007 and is now partially funded by the Government. On October 13, 2009 the municipal government decided to use a project financing strategy in order to provide for a quick start of the works. The new project originally included an overground segment. On October 15, 2009 the idea of building a partially overground system was abandoned, and the system is probably going to be entirely underground.

<text>Morbegno (; or ; ) is a little town in the low Valtellina Valley in Italy, on the left side of the Adda river. It is part of the province of Sondrio of Lombardy.

Given its proximity to the San Marco Pass, which connects the Valtellina with the Val Brembana, it played an important role in the past as a passage for trade and transport to and from northern Europe.

In 2007, it started a project to become a leader in sustainability, by involving the population in a participatory design process, presently labelled &quot;Morbegno 2020&quot;. Morbegno is partnering with the international non-profit organization The Natural Step to design a vision of what the people living in Morbegno want to create in the long term, and choose the strategic path to move towards the vision from the present reality.

Morbegno has also been selected as a pilot city in the Di.Mo.Stra. project, by the Association of Italian Municipalities for the diffusion of Strategic Planning models. Finally, on November 21, 1966, it received the honorary title of town with a presidential decree.

<doc id="797408" wikidata="Q5160568" url="?curid=797408" title="Congratulations I'm Sorry">
<text>Congratulations I&#x27;m Sorry (typeset as Congratulations...I&#x27;m Sorry) is the third studio album by the American alternative rock band Gin Blossoms, and the follow-up album to the successful 1992 release &quot;New Miserable Experience&quot;, released in 1996 by A&amp;M Records. The album was named in reference to the success of 1992&#x27;s &quot;New Miserable Experience&quot;, followed closely by the suicide of the former band member Doug Hopkins in 1993.

Reaction to &quot;Congratulations I&#x27;m Sorry&quot; was mixed, with some critics feeling that the music lay too close to the sound of the previous album. One common complaint was that most versions of the album lacked the successful 1995 single &quot;Til I Hear It from You&quot;, from the &quot;Empire Records&quot; soundtrack; however, some editions of the album did contain the track as its final.

The album&#x27;s title, according to the lead singer Robin Wilson, came from the response band members usually received from people who both wanted to congratulate the band for the success of &quot;New Miserable Experience&quot;, while then offering apologies for their friend and former band member Doug Hopkins. The album eventually reached platinum status.

==Reception==
Reception to the album was mixed. AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine explained that &quot;the only fault of &quot;Congratulations...I&#x27;m Sorry&quot; is that it sounds a bit too close to the debut -- there&#x27;s virtually no difference in terms of style and production.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; critic David Browne said that &quot;there’s something too generic about the Gin Blossoms.&quot;

&quot;People&quot; called the album &quot;a quick fix for any dark mood&quot;, continuing, &quot;the songs are so upbeat they almost conjure sunny summer afternoons.&quot;

== Track listing ==

*&quot;Competition Smile&quot; ends at 3:38. Following 30 seconds of silence, an untitled hidden track begins.
*The track &quot;7th Inning Stretch&quot; is omitted from international releases of the album. This version of the album has 13 tracks, with &quot;Til I Hear It from You&quot; as track 13.

== Excluded songs ==
Among tracks excluded from the album are &quot;Seeing Stars&quot;, a song written by the lead singer Robin Wilson about the band&#x27;s ex-lead guitarist Doug Hopkins, and the 1995 hit &quot;Til I Hear It from You&quot;. The latter was released as a single (although it is included on the international edition of the album) and can be found on the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Empire Records&quot;, while the former was included as a B-side on the &quot;Follow You Down&quot; single, along with Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Idiot Summer&quot; from the soundtrack of &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot;.

<doc id="797418" wikidata="Q753279" url="?curid=797418" title="Socket A">
<text>Socket A (also known as Socket 462) is a zero insertion force pin grid array (PGA) CPU socket used for AMD processors ranging from the Athlon Thunderbird to the Athlon XP/MP 3200+, and AMD budget processors including the Duron and Sempron. Socket A also supports AMD Geode NX embedded processors (derived from the Mobile Athlon XP). It compliments (and later supersedes) the prior Slot A CPU interface used in some Athlon Thunderbird processors. The front-side bus frequencies supported for the AMD Athlon XP and Sempron are 133 MHz, 166 MHz, and 200 MHz. Socket A supports 32-bit CPUs only.

The socket is a zero insertion force pin grid array type with 462 pins, hence the alternative name Socket 462. About nine pins in the socket are blocked to discourage accidental insertion of Socket 370 CPUs on Socket A motherboards.

Socket A was replaced by Socket 754 and Socket 939 during 2003 and 2004 respectively, except for its use with Geode NX processors.

== Technical specifications ==
* Support of processor clock-speeds between 600 MHz (Duron) to 2333 MHz (Athlon XP 3200+)
* Double data rate 100, 133, 166 and 200 MHz front-side bus on Duron, XP and Sempron processors, based on the Alpha 21264 EV6 bus.
Initially launched with 100 MHz FSB support in the earliest chipsets it evolved stepwise to faster 200 MHz FSB while maintaining pin compatibility throughout its lifetime. However, clock, timing, BIOS and voltage differences restrict compatibility between older chipsets and later processors.

Socket dimensions are 5.59 cm (5.24 cm without lever) × 6.55 cm or 2.2&quot; (2.06&quot; without lever) × 2.58&quot;, slightly bigger than Socket 370 sockets.

== Heatsink ==
Heatsinks were commonly attached directly to the CPU socket, but some motherboards also had 4 holes for fastening bigger heatsinks to the motherboard. Those holes are placed in a rectangle with lateral lengths of 35 mm and 65 mm.

== Socket A mechanical load limits ==

AMD recommends that the mass of a Socket A CPU cooler to not exceed 300 grams (10.6 ounces). Heavier coolers may result in damage to the die when the system is not properly handled.

All Socket A processors (Athlon, Sempron, Duron and Geode NX) have the following mechanical maximum load limits which should not be exceeded during heatsink assembly, shipping conditions, or standard use. They came with a warning that load above those limits may crack the processor die and make it unusable. The limits are included in the table below.

These load limits are quite small compared to the load limits of Socket 370, Socket 423 and Socket 478 processors. Indeed, they were so small that many users more often than not ended up with cracked processors while trying to remove or attach heatsinks to their fragile processor core. This makes installing non-standard or non-certified heatsink solutions a risky business. OEM aluminium heatsinks typically provided smaller thermal tolerances, so the improper application or absence of a thermal pad or thermal grease or operation in high room temperatures may result in some Socket A CPUs overheating and crashing, permanently damaging them and rendering them unusable.

== Chipsets==
AMD offered official chipsets for the Slot A/Socket A CPUs. These are included in the table below.
Third-party chipsets include the nForce, nForce2, and a large number of VIA K-series chipsets.

In practice, third-party chipsets were heavily favoured by motherboard manufacturers. Stability problems and compatibility quirks from these chipsets abounded from manufacturers not following chipset designers&#x27; guidelines. This caused long-lasting damage to AMD&#x27;s reputation, despite AMD having nothing to do with the poorly-realised hardware. A similar incident happened with third-party chipsets for Super Socket 7 CPUs, of which AMD tried to remedy it by putting quality assurance measures for the Athlon, which used Slot A/Socket A CPUs. Despite this, however, the aforementioned problems mentioned above still lingered on for quite a while, even for Athlon CPUs.

<text>Gatchina (, ) is a town and the administrative center of Gatchinsky District in Leningrad Oblast, Russia. It lies south-south-west of St. Petersburg, along the E95 highway which links Saint Petersburg and Pskov. Population: It was previously known as &quot;Khotchino&quot;, &quot;Gatchina&quot; (until February 14, 1923), &quot;Trotsk&quot; (until August 2, 1929), and &quot;Krasnogvardeysk&quot; (until January 28, 1944).

Gatchina, the largest town in Leningrad Oblast, is best known as the location of the Great Gatchina Palace, one of the main residences of the Russian Imperial Family during the 18th and 19th centuries. The historic center and Gatchina Palace are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site&#x27;s &quot;Historic Centre of Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments&quot;.
Another popular tourist attraction in Gatchina is the Prioratsky Palace.

Gatchina has placed highly in quality-of-life rankings in Russia.

==History==
===Early history===
Gatchina was first documented in 1499 under the name Khotchino as a village in possession of the Novgorod Republic. In the 17th century it was passed to Livonia and then to Sweden in a series of wars, until the early years of the Great Northern War at the turn of the 1700s when the area was returned to Russia. In 1703, Gatchina found itself in the southern vicinity of the new Russian capital, Saint Petersburg, which was being constructed north at the mouth of the Neva River. Despite technically still belonging to Swedish Ingria, in 1708, Gatchina was given by Peter the Great to his sister, Natalya Alexeyevna, and after her death in 1716 Peter founded an Imperial Hospital and Apothecary there. In 1765, it became the property of Count Orlov.

===Imperial residence===

==== 18th century ====

In 1765, Catherine the Great, Empress of the Russian Empire, purchased Gatchina Manor from Prince Boris Kurakin, which featured the village and a small manor. Gatchina was gifted by Catherine to one of her favorites, Count Grigory Grigoryevich Orlov, who reportedly organized the assassination of Tsar Peter III three years earlier, resulting in her becoming empress. Between 1766 and 1788, Count Orlov built the massive Great Gatchina Palace in place of the original manor, with 600 rooms, an extensive English landscape park over , with an adjacent zoo and a horse farm. A triumphal arch was erected to a design by the architect of Gatchina Palace, Antonio Rinaldi, forming a monumental entrance. Upon Orlov&#x27;s death in 1783, Gatchina Palace was bought by Catherine from his heirs, and gave it to her son Grand Duke Pavel Petrovich, the future Tsar Paul I. During his ownership, Paul made alterations to the palace, but also began developing the village of Gatchina into a town using experience from his travels around Europe. After ascending to the throne, Paul granted Gatchina the status of Imperial City, an honorary designation for towns that possessed a royal palace. Gatchina Palace was expanded and altered numerous times by its subsequent imperial owners, with the addition of Rococo interiors designed by Rinaldi and Vincenzo Brenna, and executed by Italian stucco workers and Russian craftsmen.

==== 19th century ====
In 1854, a railroad connecting Gatchina and Saint Petersburg was opened, and the territory of Gatchina was expanded with several villages in the vicinity being incorporated into the city. The following year Gatchina Palace came under the ownership of Tsar Alexander II, who used it as his second residence. Alexander built a hunting village south of Gatchina into a retreat where he and his guests could enjoy the unspoiled wilderness of northwestern Russia. Following the assassination of Alexander II in 1881, Gatchina Palace was passed to his shaken son, the new Tsar Alexander III, who was advised that he and his family would be safer in Gatchina as opposed to at the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg. Alexander spent most of his life at Gatchina Palace, which became known as &quot;The Citadel of Autocracy&quot; after the Tsar&#x27;s reactionary policies. Here he signed decrees, held diplomatic receptions, theatrical performances, masquerades and costumed balls, and other events and entertainment. Alexander III introduced some technological modernizations new to Russia at the Gatchina Palace, such as indoor heaters, electric lights, a telephone network, non-freezing water pipes and a modern sewage system. His son, the future Tsar Nicholas II and the last Russian Tsar, spent his youth in the Gatchina Palace, although he and his family would make Tsarskoye Selo his home. His mother, Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna, widow of Alexander III, was the patron of the city of Gatchina, the palace and its parks.

===20th century===
Gatchina was honored as the best-kept city of Russia at the 1900 World&#x27;s Fair in Paris (Exposition Universelle). The quality of life, education, medical services, and public safety in Gatchina were recognized as the best, and it was recommended as an example for other cities in Russia. In 1910, one of the first airfields in Russia was established in Gatchina, with the city becoming one of the first centers of aviation and engine technology in Russia. The pilot Pyotr Nesterov was trained at the Gatchina airfield and made his first long-distance flight from Gatchina to Kiev. Gatchina Palace remained one of the official imperial residences of Tsar Nicholas II, who was presiding over annual military parades and celebrations of the Imperial Russian Army garrisons, stationed in Gatchina until 1917.

==== World War I ====
During World War I, major medical hospitals in Gatchina were visited by the Tsar Nicholas II and Empress Maria Fyodorovna, the mother of Nicholas II, his wife the Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna, as well as their daughters Grand Duchess Olga, Grand Duchess Tatiana, Grand Duchess Maria, and Grand Duchess Anastasia.

In March 1917, the Russian Empire collapsed upon the abdication of Nicholas II following the February Revolution, leading to a decline in Gatchina&#x27;s importance as the town and its palace became state property of the Russian Provisional Government, who converted it to a museum.

==== Russian Civil War ====
Shortly afterwards, the Bolsheviks seized power in the October Revolution and the outbreak of the Russian Civil War followed. It saw Gatchina loyal to the White Movement, and the palace was visited by President Alexander Kerensky of the deposed Russian Provisional Government on October 27, 1917. During Kerensky&#x27;s visit, fighting broke out in Gatchina between detachments of the Red Guards and Cossack units of General Pyotr Krasnov. The Reds won the battle, which had avoided the palace, and on November 1, they held a rally outside the palace in the main square, where Pavel Dybenko encouraged the Cossack units stationed in the palace to surrender and not to oppose the Red authorities. Kerensky left Gatchina Palace that night, and it was occupied by Red troops the following day.

==== Interbellum ====
In May 1918, the museum was re-opened by the Reds &quot;for the victorious popular masses of the Russian Revolution&quot; in Gatchina. From 1918 to 1941, the Gatchina Palace and parks were open to public as a national museum. On February 14, 1923, Gatchina was renamed Trotsk () by the new Soviet authorities, after Leon Trotsky. After Joseph Stalin became General Secretary of the Russian Communist Party (b), Trotsky was gradually exiled (and later killed on Stalin&#x27;s orders), and the town was renamed Krasnogvardeysk (, &quot;Red Guard City&quot;) on August 2, 1929.

==== World War 2 ====

Gatchina was occupied by Nazi Germany from Saturday, September 13, 1941, following the German invasion of Russia during World War II.
The Germans renamed the town Lindemannstadt, in honor of the Wehrmacht general Georg Lindemann, and looted much of the Gatchina Palace for its collections of art. On January 26, 1944, the Germans abandoned Lindemannstadt during their retreat, setting fire to Gatchina Palace and vandalizing much of the park. The town was quickly retaken by the Red Army, and two days later it was renamed back to its original pre-Soviet name, Gatchina.

==== Rebuilding ====
After the war, Gatchina was rebuilt to Soviet standards, and became home to the Petersburg Institute of Nuclear Physics. The extent of the Gatchina Palace&#x27;s devastation was extraordinary, and initially was considered irreparable damage. Restoration works continued for over 60 years, and some pieces of the art collection were recovered from safe keeping and returned to Gatchina. Today, one section of the Gatchina Palace is partially completed and certain state rooms and the Arsenal Halls are now open to the public. Other areas of the palace, including those of Tsar Alexander III, remain closed and unrestored.

In 1990, shortly before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Gatchina Palace and surviving buildings in Gatchina&#x27;s historic center became UNESCO World Heritage Sites, as part of the wider Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments. In 1999, Gatchina was awarded in the Most Comfortable City of Russia, a quality of life competition for Russian towns and cities, being ranked first in Category III, the category for cities with a population of under 100,000. In 2010, Gatchina&#x27;s status as an Historical city of Russia was revoked.

==Name==
The town has notably been known under various names during its history. As common with larger urban areas under the Soviet Union, Gatchina was renamed to reflect the changed ideals of the government. This first came in honouring Leon Trotsky. However, with the feud between Trotsky and Stalin at a high this name was to become problematic. Thus, the city was renamed again in honour of the Soviet troops. Unlike other regions that underwent this process, Gatchina has a more complex history leading to multiple variations.

==Administrative and municipal divisions==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Gatchina serves as the administrative center of Gatchinsky District. As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Gatchinsky District as Gatchinskoye Settlement Municipal Formation. As a municipal division, Gatchinskoye Settlement Municipal Formation is incorporated within Gatchinsky Municipal District as Gatchinskoye Urban Settlement.

==Economy==

===Industry===
In Gatchina, there are several enterprises related to timber industry, including a paper mill, and to food industry.

===Transportation===

Gatchina is an important railway node. One railway, running north to south, connects the Baltiysky railway station in St. Petersburg with Dno and Nevel. Within the town limits, suburban trains in this direction stop at the platform of Tatyanino and the station of Gatchina-Varshavskaya. Another railway, also from the Baltiysky railway station, arrives to Gatchina from the northwest and has two stops, Mariyenburg and Gatchina-Passazhirskaya-Baltiyskaya. Yet another railway runs south of the town center from east to west and connects Mga via Ulyanovka with Volosovo. The railway station on this line in Gatchina is Gatchina-Tovarnaya-Baltiyskaya.

The M20 Highway connecting St. Petersburg and Pskov, crosses Gatchina from north to south. South of Gatchina, it crosses the A120 Highway, which encircles St. Petersburg. A paved road connects Gatchina with Kingisepp via Volosovo. There are also local roads.
===Science===
Gatchina is the site of the Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute.

<text>Laie Hawaii Temple is a temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints located on the northeast shore of the Hawaiian island of Oahu. The temple sits on a small hill, half a mile from the Pacific Ocean, in the town of Lāie, from Honolulu. Along with Brigham Young University–Hawaii and the Polynesian Cultural Center, the Laie Hawaii Temple plays an important role in the town of Lā&#x27;ie, with the Visitors&#x27; Center attracting more than 100,000 people annually.

In addition to initial building and construction, the temple has been dedicated for use by several church presidents. The temple site was dedicated by Joseph F. Smith on June 1, 1915, with Heber J. Grant dedicating the completed structure on November 27, 1919. Spencer W. Kimball rededicated the temple after significant expansion on June 13, 1978. Following seismic upgrades and remodeling, Thomas S. Monson rededicated the temple on November 21, 2010.

The Laie Hawaii Temple was the first temple built by the church outside the contiguous United States. The temple is also the oldest to operate outside Utah, and the church&#x27;s fifth-oldest temple still in operation. The Laie Hawaii Temple was formerly known as the Hawaiian Temple or the Hawaii Temple until the implementation of the standard naming convention for the church&#x27;s temples.

==History==

===Sandwich Islands Mission===

During the California Gold Rush, the first ten Mormon missionaries to Hawaii departed San Francisco on the ship &quot;Imaum of Muscat.&quot; After 20 days at sea, the ship arrived on December 12, 1850, in Honolulu Harbor at what was then known as the &quot;Sandwich Islands&quot; (Hawaiian Islands). A week later, nine missionaries received their assignments; two headed to the island of Kaua&#x27;i, three to Lahaina on the island of Maui, two to the Big Island of Hawaii, and two stayed behind in Honolulu. These nine missionaries formed the basis of the Sandwich Islands Mission. The church&#x27;s first congregation in Hawaii was established on the island of Maui in 1851. Missionaries settled on the island of Lānai in 1854, and in Lāʻie on the island of Oahu in 1865.

===Lāie===

In 1865, the church purchased a sugarcane plantation for $14,000 as a gathering place for the Latter-day Saints in the area. While on a mission to the Sandwich Islands, Joseph F. Smith first proposed building a temple in Hawaii during a meeting in Lāie on February 15, 1885. George Q. Cannon, one of the original ten missionaries, visited Lāʻie in 1900 and became revered as a prophet for promoting the idea of a new Hawaiian temple among his congregations.

In 1915, Joseph F. Smith, then sixth president of the church, announced plans for the first temple outside the contiguous United States and chose Lāʻie for its construction. According to Mormon folklore, precious materials arrived just in time to complete the building of the temple: Temple builders ran out of wood (a scarce commodity on the islands) during initial construction, but local members received lumber when a ship ran aground and needed to unload some of its cargo of wood. The temple builders volunteered to help the ship and were given the lumber out of gratitude. The lumber taken from the ship proved to be just enough to finish the temple.
When news of the new Laie Hawaii Temple reached Native Hawaiian converts (and other Polynesians) living far from home in the town of Iosepa, Utah, many decided to emigrate back to Hawaii. Although the Hawaiians had lived in Iosepa since 1889, the closest temple, Salt Lake Temple, was 75 miles away from the colony. Moving to Laie gave the Hawaiians the ability to be closer to the new temple and allowed them to perform sacred ordinances without having to travel great distances. By January 1917, most of the Hawaiians returned home, leaving Iosepa a ghost town.

Church president Heber J. Grant presided over the Hawaiian Temple&#x27;s dedication on November 27, 1919. Grant called the Hawaiian people &quot;descendants of Lehi&quot; (a prophet in the Book of Mormon), and saw the future of the new temple in Lāʻie as a magnet for Polynesian converts. After the temple was completed, more Polynesians moved to Lāʻie, to participate in temple ordinances. Tourists were also drawn to the area, and guide books of the time compared the Lāʻie temple to the Taj Mahal.

The 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor gave rise to another popular tale about the Laie Hawaii Temple in church folklore. According to variations on this story, Japanese aircraft pilots attempted to bomb or strafe the Hawaiian Temple just prior to, or just after, the attack, but were thwarted by mechanical failure or from an unseen protective force. Some stories suggest that the Japanese pilot who attempted to attack the temple was converted to the church after he saw a picture of the temple in the possession of the faith&#x27;s missionaries in Japan. Although there is an eyewitness who believes he saw the attempted bombing and a former missionary who says he met the Japanese convert, historians have found little supporting evidence that would substantiate these stories.

===Renovation===
Beginning in May 1976, the temple was closed for a two-year remodeling project, expanding from to over . Church president Spencer W. Kimball rededicated the temple on June 13, 1978.

A $5.5 million renovation, renewal, and beautification project along Hale Laa Boulevard leading to the temple began in 2003, lasting 14 months: Norfolk pines suffering from termite infestation were replaced with royal palms, new decorative lighting was added to the terraces, and landscaped roundabouts were put in place. At the same time, the Visitors&#x27; Center was upgraded with interactive kiosks and new displays. There is now a cut-away model of the temple on display, which allows visitors to see its interior, because only members with an active recommend are allowed to enter after a temple is dedicated. It took the artisan team over eight months to build the temple model in the US and more than a week to reassemble the model for display after being shipped to Hawaii.

In December 2008, the Laie Hawaii Temple closed again for structural and seismic upgrades and to restore the ordinance rooms to their original appearance and progressive-style presentation of the endowment (still using film). The baptistry was repaired and renovated. The temple was rededicated on November 21, 2010, by Thomas S. Monson.

In 2020, like all the church&#x27;s other temples, the Laie Hawaii Temple was closed in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

==Architecture==
Church president Joseph F. Smith wanted the architecture of the Laie Hawaii Temple to resemble Solomon&#x27;s Temple referred to in the biblical canon. The temple is often compared to the Cardston Alberta Temple, designed by young architects Hyrum Pope and Harold W. Burton. Pope and Burton&#x27;s design was also used for Laie, and their work is rooted in the Prairie style architecture made popular by architect Frank Lloyd Wright in the early twentieth-century. The temples also evoke Mesoamerican architectural motifs, a favored theme of Burton&#x27;s.

The temple sits on an site that was once part of a large sugarcane plantation. Construction of the temple first began in February 1916. Native materials consisting of crushed lava rock were used to build the temple, along with reinforced concrete. The building&#x27;s gleaming white finish was created using pneumatic stone-cutting techniques. The temple has the shape of a cross when seen from the air; the highest point of the temple is , and it measures from east to west and from north to south.
The exterior of the temple exhibits four large friezes planned by American sculptor J. Leo Fairbanks and built with the help of his brother Avard Fairbanks. Modeled four-fifths lifesize and cast in concrete, the bas-relief friezes depict God&#x27;s dealings with Man. The north frieze depicts the story of the Book of Mormon. The west frieze shows the people of the Old Testament. The New Testament and the Apostasy are depicted on the southern frieze of the temple, and the restoration of the church through Joseph Smith is shown on the east frieze. On the grounds of the temple are statues also designed by the Fairbanks brothers, including Joseph being blessed by his father and one of the Prophet Lehi in a scene from the Second Book of Nephi in the Book of Mormon.
As visitors approach the temple and pass a number of reflecting pools, a maternity fountain sits in front of the uppermost pool. Designed by the Fairbanks brothers, this bold relief honors Hawaiian Motherhood and depicts a Hawaiian mother holding a giant clam shell while pouring water over her children. The act is supposed to symbolize mothers pouring their love, hope and care onto their children.

The landscaped temple grounds contain tropical gardens, with plants such as hibiscus, Brazilian plume, birds of paradise, lantana, red ginger, bougainvillea, plumeria, Ixora, and others. At the base of the temple grounds is a fountain separating a Family History Center and a Visitors&#x27; Center, where a ten-foot sculpture replica of Bertel Thorvaldsen&#x27;s &quot;Christus&quot; stands inside the entrance.

The Laie Hawaii Temple is and houses three ordinance rooms and six sealing rooms. Landscape artist LeConte Stewart designed many of the murals found inside the temple.

==Admittance==
Laie Hawaii Temple is not used for regular Sunday worship. As temples require church approval to enter, only church members who are recommended by their local bishop are allowed to enter for the purpose of participating in ceremonies such as endowments, baptism for the dead and marriage. Because of these guidelines, those without an active recommend are not allowed inside temples, but public tours of the grounds outside and of the visitors&#x27; centers are available.

==Temple presidents==
Notable temple presidents include Edward L. Clissold (1936–38, 1943–44, 1963–65); D. Arthur Haycock (1986–89), and J. Richard Clarke (1998–2001).

<doc id="797427" wikidata="Q2566879" url="?curid=797427" title="Caramuru">
<text>Caramuru (-1557) was the Tupi name of the Portuguese colonist Diogo Álvares Correia, who is notable for being the first European to establish contact with the native Tupinambá population in modern-day Brazil and was instrumental in the early colonization of Brazil by the Portuguese crown. Notably, Caramuru&#x27;s native-born wife, Catarina Paraguaçu, was the first South American native to be received in France in 1526. He and Catarina became the first Christian family in Brazil and had three children: Gaspar, Gabriel and Jorge, all named knights by Tomé de Sousa.

==Life==
Correia was born in Viana do Castelo. He departed to the Portuguese colony of Brazil in 1509, probably aboard a French vessel. His ship wrecked, probably in the reefs off Rio Vermelho, and Correia found himself alone among the Tupinambá Indians. They called him &quot;Caramuru&quot;, meaning &quot;moray&quot;. Correia married Paraguaçu or Paraguassu, the daughter of Morubixaba (the Tupinamba&#x27;s word for chief) Taparica.

During the following twenty years, Correia kept contact with European ships and used his influence on local natives to help the Portuguese crown and missionaries during the early years of colonization. In 1526, he traveled to France with his wife. Paraguaçu was baptized by Mary Catherine des Granches, wife of Jacques Cartier, under the name Katherine du Brézil, thereby creating the first Brazilian Christian family. A couple of years later, he returned to Bahia at the request of King John III of Portugal. In 1534, he assisted Francisco Pereira Coutinho, the first captain of Bahia, in establishing the settlement of Pereira (later known as Vila Velha or &quot;Old Town&quot;) in modern Salvador&#x27;s Ladeira da Barra neighborhood. By 1546, Pereira Coutinho, accused of heresy and disobedience to the Crown, having systematically mistreated the Tupinambá, had caused them to turn hostile and Correia followed him when he fled to Porto Seguro, in order to appease the situation and bring him to his senses. When they returned the next year, the ship was damaged off the southern shore of Itaparica and the survivors captured by the Tupinambá. Correia was spared but the captain was consumed in a cannibalistic feast. In 1549, Correia aided Tomé de Sousa in founding Salvador and creating the first government over all of the Brazilian colony.

He died in October 1557, was buried in the Church of Jesus, and left half of his wealth to the Jesuits. His wife Catarina Paraguaçu died in 1582. His sons Gaspar, Gabriel, and Jorge were declared knights by Governor Tomé de Sousa for their services to the Portuguese Crown. They went on to help found Cachoeira on the Paraguaçu.

<doc id="797432" wikidata="Q7307003" url="?curid=797432" title="Reese River">
<text>The Reese River is a tributary of the Humboldt River, located in central Nevada in the western United States.
The Reese rises in the southern section of the Toiyabe Range, on the flanks of Arc Dome. In its upper reaches, the Reese River is a fast-flowing mountain stream surrounded by relatively lush growth, including Aspen groves and cottonwood trees. It then flows north between the Toiyabe Range and the Shoshone Mountains for approximately half its length. The river then passes through a low point in the Shoshone Mountains and continues north between that range and the Fish Creek Mountains. Once it exits the Toiyabe Range, it becomes a slow, muddy stream, and its waters are used for irrigation by scattered farms and ranches along its lower reaches. Although considered a tributary of the Humboldt, in most years, the Reese dwindles into a chain of shallow pools long before it reaches the main stem. Only during infrequent floods does the Reese contribute water to the Humboldt, entering near Battle Mountain. Nevada State Route 305 parallels the lower, usually dry portion of the channel from the Austin area to Battle Mountain.

The river is named after John Reese, who explored the area in 1854 as part of the expedition of Colonel Edward Steptoe, and who later served as a guide to Captain James H. Simpson&#x27;s survey of a military road through central Nevada. The mining boomtown of Austin, located in the upper reaches of the Reese River, names its long-lived newspaper the &quot;Reese River Reveille&quot;.

== Reese River excitement ==
The Reese River excitement took place in 1862 and 1863 in the river valley. During this period, the area was explored and settled. After Austin was founded, prospectors went south to explore the Toiyabe Range and crossed the border of Lander County and Esmeralda County. Three mining districts were organized in the Toiyabe Range in Esmeralda County, namely Marysville, Twin River, and Washington. Also, several villages and ranches were established in the county. After the Toiyabe Range, the Shoshone Mountains were found, and in 1863 silver was found on the western side of the mountain range. At that place, Union District was organized, and the village Ione was founded.

Nye County was established as a result of the Reese River excitement: inhabitants of Union District signed a petition in which they said the district was far from Aurora and Austin, the county seats of respectively Esmeralda and Lander County. Nye County was created by the Nevada Legislature on February 16, 1864.

<doc id="797437" wikidata="Q262154" url="?curid=797437" title="Elizabeth Loftus">
<text>Elizabeth F. Loftus (born 1944) is an American psychologist who is best known in relation to the misinformation effect, false memory and criticism of recovered memory therapies.

Loftus&#x27;s research includes the effects of phrasing on the perceptions of automobile crashes, the &quot;lost in the mall&quot; technique and the manipulation of food preferences through the use of false memories. In the Jane Doe case that began in 1997, Loftus and Melvin J. Guyer revealed serious concerns about the background and validity of the initial research. She has also served on the executive council of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and was a keynote speaker at the British Psychological Society&#x27;s 2011 annual conference.

As well as her scientific work, Loftus has provided expert testimony or consultation for lawyers in over 300 court cases, including for the legal teams of Ghislaine Maxwell, Harvey Weinstein, Ted Bundy, O. J. Simpson, Angelo Buono and Robert Durst. She has also written many books, including &quot;The Myth of Repressed Memory: False Memories &amp; Allegations of Sexual Abuse&quot; and &quot;Witness for the Defense&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Born Elizabeth Fishman on October 16, 1944, Loftus grew up in a Jewish family in Bel Air, California. Her father (Sidney Fishman) was a doctor and her mother (Rebecca Fishman) a librarian. When Loftus was 14 years old, her mother drowned.

She received a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics and psychology from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1966, followed by a master&#x27;s and PhD in mathematical psychology from Stanford University in 1967 and 1970 respectively. Her thesis was entitled &quot;An Analysis of the Structural Variables That Determine Problem-Solving Difficulty on a Computer-Based Teletype&quot;.

== Career ==
=== 1970 to 1989 ===
From 1970 to 1973, Loftus was employed as a cognitive psychologist at the New School for Social Research in New York City, after becoming dissatisfied with university work such as calibrating math and word problems for fifth-grade students. At the time, she had also been investigating semantic memory with Professor Jonathan Freedman at Stanford University.

Loftus was employed at the University of Washington from 1973 to 2001, initially as an assistant professor. She shifted from laboratory work to using &quot;real world&quot; situations of criminal court cases.

Around this time, the United States Department of Transportation was offering funding for research into car crashes. Loftus&#x27;s first experiment in this area involved showing 45 students videos of car crashes and then asking the students to estimate the speed of the car. Her findings were that the mean estimates of the speeds were 32 mph when the question was phrased as the speed that the cars &quot;collided&quot;, 34 mph when the question was phrased as &quot;hit each other&quot; instead, and 41 mph when the question was phrased as &quot;smashed each other&quot;. Loftus concluded that &quot;these results are consistent with the view that the questions asked subsequent to an event can cause a reconstruction in one&#x27;s memory of that event&quot;.

In 1974, Loftus published two articles with her observations about the conflicting eyewitness accounts in a particular murder trial and about the reliability of witness testimony in general. This resulted in several lawyers contacting her about current cases, beginning her career of paid work providing advice to lawyers. Early attempts for Loftus to act as an expert witness for these lawyers were deemed inadmissible by judges, however in June 1975 Loftus presented the first expert witness testimony in Washington State on the topic of eyewitness identification.

=== 1990 to 1996 ===
In 1990, George Franklin was on trial for murdering a young girl 20 years prior. The prosecution&#x27;s evidence included eyewitness testimony from Franklin&#x27;s daughter that she had witnessed the murder, based on a recovered memory which was unearthed during a therapy session a year before the trial. The defense attorney had a theory that the daughter had never seen the crime and that the testimony was based on a false memory. Loftus was employed by the attorney to provide expert testimony in support of this theory. Loftus referred to an experiment where she showed people video of a crime and then an incorrect television news report about the crime. Afterwards, the viewers had mixed up some events from the original video with those in the news report. Loftus argued that the same must have happened to Franklin&#x27;s daughter, causing a &quot;memory&quot; of an event that she hadn&#x27;t witnessed.

However, the prosecutor forced Loftus to admit that she had never studied memories like those of Franklin&#x27;s daughter. Loftus&#x27;s studies found that people could misidentify random perpetrators, not that they could mistakenly accuse their own fathers. It was also not proven that memories could be wholly invented, rather than altered. The prosecution was successful and Franklin was convicted, though the conviction was later overturned on appeal and the prosecution declined to retry Franklin.

In 1991 there were several high-profile court cases of people having recovered memories of having been molested by their parents, which gained Loftus&#x27;s attention. She read through several then-current psychology books (The Courage to Heal) which instructed women and therapists in methods of recovering &quot;lost&quot; memories of sexual abuse, and urging therapists to query their clients about childhood incest. Also in 1991, Loftus was deemed an honorary fellow of the British Psychological Society.

Around this time, Loftus&#x27;s undergraduate student Jim Coan developed the &quot;lost in the mall&quot; technique. This technique involved Coan giving his younger brother three stories of actual events from his childhood, plus a false story about the brother being lost in a mall. The younger brother believed all stories to be true and provided further details of the false story.

A similar experiment by Loftus found that 25% of subjects believed that they could remember the event which had never taken place; however, this study was criticized by Lynn Crook and Martha Dean based on the ethics of the subject recruitment method used and Kenneth Pope has argued she overgeneralized the findings to draw conclusions about false memories and therapeutic techniques. A later study by Loftus (involving 332 undergraduate students who received course credit for participating) found that approximately one third of students accepted as true a false story about having their ear licked by a drug-addled Pluto character during a childhood visit to Disneyland.

Following the publication of these studies, armed guards accompanied Loftus at lectures. Also, Loftus had previously received death threats after the publication of her 1994 book &quot;The Myth of Repressed Memory&quot;. The same year, Loftus received an In Praise of Reason award from the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.

In the 1997 &quot;New Hampshire vs Joel Hungerford&quot; case, the judge set strict conditions on the admissibility of recovered memory testimony.
=== 1997 to 2000 ===
In 1997, psychiatrists David Corwin and Erna Olafson published a case study of a recovered memory of apparently genuine childhood sexual abuse, which became known as the Jane Doe case. Loftus and Melvin Guyer interviewed Jane&#x27;s stepmother who revealed that she was involved in building a case against Jane&#x27;s mother in a battle for custody of Jane. Jane contacted the University of Washington and accused Loftus of breaching her privacy. The university put Loftus under investigation, including confiscating her files. The investigation lasted for 21 months, during which time Loftus was not allowed to share her findings. The university cleared Loftus of breaking research protocols, and Loftus and Guyer published their findings in 2002.

Loftus&#x27;s invitation to give the keynote address at the New Zealand Psychological Society&#x27;s conference in August 2000 provoked the society&#x27;s director of scientific affairs, John Read, to resign from his position and for conference attendees to distribute materials critical of Loftus&#x27;s work. Loftus stated that she &quot;didn&#x27;t wear her best jacket&quot; to give her address for &quot;fear of flying tomatoes&quot;. Prior to the conference, Loftus was the subject of several internet posts by conspiracy theorist Diana Napolis which alleged that Loftus was conspiring to help child molesters.

=== 2001 to present ===
By 2001, Loftus had become disappointed with the University of Washington&#x27;s unwillingness to stand by her during the controversy involving the Jane Doe case, and she left the university. The same year, Loftus received a William James Fellow Award from the Association for Psychological Science.

From 2001 to 2003, Loftus worked for the University of California, Irvine, (UCI) as a distinguished professor in the department of Criminology, Law and Society and the department of Psychological Science. She was also a fellow in the UCI Department of Cognitive Sciences and the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory. Her work included an experiment on 131 undergraduate students in relation to preferences for cookies and strawberry ice cream. The students were given false information that they had become sick from these foods when they were under 10 years old, and were asked before and afterwards to rate the likelihood of this event having occurred.

In 2002, Loftus was ranked 58th in the &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot;″s list of the 100 most influential psychological researchers of the 20th century. The following year, Loftus received the award for Distinguished Scientific Applications of Psychology from the American Psychological Association (APA). Also in 2003, Loftus was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

In 2003, the &quot;Taus v. Loftus&quot; case in the Supreme Court of California saw Loftus, Melvin J. Guyer and &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; magazine being sued by Nicole Taus regarding the article they published about her case. The lawsuit included 21 claims of defamation, invasion of privacy, infliction of emotional distress and fraud. Initially, all but one of the claims was dismissed. The remaining claim was regarding Loftus&#x27;s self-misrepresentation as Corwin&#x27;s colleague and supervisor while interviewing Taus&#x27;s foster mother. In August 2007, the remaining claim was withdrawn by Taus, after reaching an agreement that Loftus&#x27;s insurance company would pay a settlement of $7,500 to Nicole Taus. The following year, Loftus published her studies on the case.

In 2004, she attempted to implant a false memory in Alan Alda on &quot;Scientific American Frontiers&quot;. Alda did not accept the false memory of becoming sick as a child from eating a hard-boiled egg. Loftus stated that Alda&#x27;s questionnaire self-correction from &quot;definitely didn&#x27;t happen&quot; to &quot;happened&quot; supported the false memory theory. The variance in Alda&#x27;s pre- and post-experiment responses was not stated. Loftus attended and was a speaker at the Beyond Belief symposium in November 2006. In 2005, she received the Grawemeyer Award in psychology from the University of Louisville. In 2009, she received the Joseph Priestley Award presented by Dickinson College. In 2010, she received the Scientific Freedom and Responsibility Award from the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

From 2011 to , Loftus was on the executive council of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. Loftus was a keynote speaker at the British Psychological Society&#x27;s annual conference in 2011.

In June 2013, Loftus presented at the TEDGlobal Conference in Edinburgh, Scotland. She was also the keynote speaker at the 2013 Psychonomic Society annual meeting. In 2015, Loftus received an honorary doctorate in psychology from Goldsmiths, University of London. In 2016, Loftus received the John Maddox Prize, In 2018, she won the Western Psychological Association&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award and the University College Dublin&#x27;s Ulysses Medal.

In 2022, Loftus made Research.com&#x27;s list of world’s top female scientists, ranking at No. 451 in the United States.

== The recovered memory / false memory debate ==

Elizabeth Loftus has been an active participant in controversies over memory since the last decades of the 20th century, known as the recovered memory / false memory debate, or as the &quot;Memory Wars&quot; (as in the title of the book &quot;The Memory Wars&quot;).

Loftus was a member of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation Scientific Advisory Board. She along with Peter Freyd, Pamela Freyd and the False Memory Syndrome Foundation have argued that there is sufficient experimental evidence that people distort their memories, that human memory is not usually faithful to objective facts, and that false memories can be implanted in other people through suggestion and recovered-memory therapy. Thus, in many or most cases, the memories of childhood abuse that people recover in psychotherapy, and which are sometimes presented in court, are false memories.

Other scholars and specialists including Bessel van der Kolk, Lenore Terr, Jennifer Freyd and Linda Williams argue that there are well-documented cases of forgetting and later remembering traumatic events that occurred during childhood or adulthood by people in both clinical and non-clinical populations.

Elizabeth Loftus has argued that the concept of memory inhibition or repression is inadequate and that there is no such thing as repressed and later recovered memories of traumatic events. Loftus criticizes recovered-memory therapy and in particular Freud&#x27;s psychoanalysis for spreading these inadequate concepts.

Richard McNally argues that forgetting of childhood abuse events can be explained by other factors such as ordinary forgetting or nondisclosure and that the theory of a motivational mechanism for forgetting (repression) is unnecessary.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) and the Eleventh revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) do not use the concept of repression but that of dissociative amnesia. Dissociative amnesia is the forgetfulness due to psychological causes, including stress, of certain autobiographical events, which can cover short or long periods. The DSM-5 includes dissociative amnesia as a disorder (a clinical syndrome) and also as a symptom (among others) of post-traumatic stress disorder.

In 1977 Florence Rush argued that Freud&#x27;s theory about the Oedipus complex was created to cover up real cases of sexual abuse committed by adults against children. According to this, Freud changed his initially posited seduction theory because he wanted to hide the reality of the traumas that his patients would have suffered. In 1984 Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson published The Assault on Truth, where, like Rush, he argues that Freud covered up the reality of sexual abuse.

Drawing on Rush and Masson, Susie Orbach argues that Freud replaced his theory of seduction and childhood sexual trauma with the theory of the Oedipus complex. Freud changed his views and decided that his patients&#x27; memories of sexual abuse were actually imaginary, neurotic fantasies of unrealized events and Oedipal wishes. This change in Freudian theory was criticized by Sandor Ferenczi and John Bowlby among other mental health specialists.

Phil Mollon claims that Freud was ahead of his time and that the new findings on false memory syndrome confirm the claims Freud made a century ago about imaginary memories.

On the other hand, in addition to Elizabeth Loftus, several reputable modern psychologists and psychiatrists, including Ulric Neisser, Julia Shaw and Daniel Schacter agree that human memory is usually not true to the facts.

The book edited by Robert Belli &quot;True and False Recovered Memories. Toward a Reconciliation of the Debate&quot; (2012) tries to make a synthesis that takes into account the part of truth and reason that both parts have in the debate.

== Involvement in legal cases ==
Loftus has testified in over 300 cases, and consulted on many more. Her legal cases include:
* Robert Durst&#x27;s 2020 trial for murder: Loftus testified for the defense regarding the killing of Susan Berman.
* Ghislaine Maxwell&#x27;s 2021 trial for sex-trafficking: Loftus testified for the defense during Maxwell&#x27;s trial regarding sex trafficking of under-age girls for Jeffrey Epstein. This was the first case where Loftus claimed that the potential for financial rewards could cause a human brain to create a false traumatic memory; when questioned about the basis of the theory by the jury, Loftus stated &quot;I am not aware of any studies on that, but based on my research, it&#x27;s definitely plausible.&quot;
*Harvey Weinstein&#x27;s 2020 trial for rape and sexual assault: Loftus testified for the defense during Weinstein&#x27;s trial for sexual assault of two women.

Loftus has also been involved with the cases of Ted Bundy, O. J. Simpson, Rodney King, Oliver North, Martha Stewart, Lewis Libby, Michael Jackson, the Menendez brothers and the Oklahoma City bombers.

== Personal life ==
From 1968 to 1991, Elizabeth was married to fellow psychologist Geoffrey Loftus.

== Publications ==
Loftus has written or co-authored many journal articles and books, including the 1994 book titled &quot;The Myth of Repressed Memory&quot;.

<doc id="797441" wikidata="Q3283817" url="?curid=797441" title="Moby Dick and Mighty Mightor">
<text>Moby Dick and Mighty Mightor is an American Saturday-morning animated television series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions that ran on CBS from September 9, 1967 to January 6, 1968, airing in reruns until September 6, 1969. Despite Moby&#x27;s name coming first, he had only one short per half-hour episode, sandwiched between two with Mightor. The same structure was used the previous season for &quot;Frankenstein Jr. and The Impossibles&quot;.

==Characters and plot==
===&quot;Mightor&quot;===
One day, while on a hunting trip, a teenage caveman named Tor (voiced by Bobby Diamond), along with his winged pet dinosaur Tog (vocal effects provided by John Stephenson), rescue an ancient hermit from an Allosaurus. As a reward, the hermit gives Tor a magical club. When Tor raises his club to the sky, he transforms into the masked and muscular Mightor (voiced by Paul Stewart), a prehistoric superhero who possesses superhuman strength and the power of flight through his club, which can also fire energy blasts. He can also transform Tog into a powerful fire-breathing dragon.

Mightor protects his village from evil-doers. Amongst the villagers are the chief Pondo (voiced by John Stephenson) and his daughter Sheera (voiced by Patsy Garrett). Sheera has a younger brother named Little Rok (voiced by Norma MacMillan), who loves pretending to be Mightor which often causes him to be saved from danger by Mightor on different occasions. The characters have several pets, including Little Rok&#x27;s bird Ork (vocal effects provided by John Stephenson), and Sheera&#x27;s mammoth calf Bollo (vocal effects also provided by Stephenson).

Mightor had recurring enemies like:

* Korg - An exiled member of Tor&#x27;s tribe
* Serpent Queen (voiced by Jean Vander Pyl) - A serpent-themed female
* Kragor - The leader of the Cave Creatures
* Rog - The leader of the Stone Men
* Vultar - Leader of the Vulture Men
* Grok - A caveman who unleashed Tyrannor, and later stole the Golden Rock to control the beasts

Mightor bears a number of similarities to the Marvel superhero Thor, particularly during the early of run of the latter titular character&#x27;s series. Both heroes having a secret identity of an ordinary, unassuming man with a superpowered alter ego when possessing a powerful mystical weapon. Their respective names and titles are quite similar as well.

===&quot;Moby Dick&quot;===
Teenage boys Tom (voiced by Bobby Resnick) and Tubb (voiced by Barry Balkin) are rescued by the great white whale Moby Dick (vocal effects provided by Don Messick) after a shipwreck. Together with their pet seal Scooby (vocal effects provided by Messick), they face the dangers of the undersea world.

==Production==
After the success of &quot;Space Ghost&quot;, CBS&#x27; head of daytime programming, Fred Silverman, commissioned Hanna-Barbera to develop three new action-adventure series in the same vein for the 1967–68 fall schedule consisting of &quot;The Herculoids&quot;, &quot;Shazzan&quot;, and &quot;Moby Dick and Mighty Mightor&quot;.

==Home media==
On July 19, 2011, Warner Archive released &quot;Moby Dick and the Mighty Mightor: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in region 1 as part of their Hanna-Barbera Classic Collection. This is a Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) release, available exclusively through Warner&#x27;s online store and Amazon.com.

Characters from &quot;Moby Dick&quot; later appear in &quot;Sealab 2021&quot;: Tubb as child actor star &quot;Chubby Cox&quot;, and Scooby the seal as &quot;Stinky Pete&quot;, whose appearances culminate in his eyes becoming near-demonic, uttering his catchphrase &quot;I&#x27;m cha-cha-cha-cha-delicious&quot;.

Mightor makes some appearances in the Adult Swim show &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;, as Judge Hiram Mightor and voiced by Gary Cole. Moby Dick appears in the episode &quot;SPF&quot;, voiced by Wally Wingert.

Tom, Tubb, and Scooby the seal appear in the &quot;Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated&quot; episode &quot;The Midnight Zone&quot;, with Tom and Tubb voiced by Dee Bradley Baker. Moby Dick is depicted as a submarine piloted by Tom and Tubb. They helped Mystery Incorporated and Cassidy Williams to reach the Midnight Zone (the deepest part of the ocean near Crystal Cove) when World War II robots have been attacking Cassidy Williams.

Moby Dick appears at the end of the episode where he rolls on everybody for being at his cove during his birthday. Tubb is a recurring character in the third season and has a German accent. Little Rok and Ork appear in the season three episode &quot;Collection Protection&quot; where Little Rok is an anime fan, a rival of Peter Potamus, and the proprietor of Little Rok&#x27;s Big Museum of Anime and Manga Memorabilia.

A new incarnation of Mightor appears in the 2016 DC comic book series &quot;Future Quest&quot;, along with several other characters from Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s action cartoons. This version is a young black boy of modern times who discovers the original&#x27;s club and is transformed into a new Mightor, with the boy&#x27;s pet cat becoming a powerful saber-toothed cat. This Mightor is mentored in his new heroic role by Birdman.

<text>The Kona Hawaii Temple is the 70th operating temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The intent to build the temple was announced on May 7, 1998, by the church&#x27;s First Presidency. It is located in Kailua-Kona on the island of Hawaii and is the second temple built in Hawaii, along with the Laie Hawaii Temple, and is the sixth in the Pacific Islands.

The temple has a single attached spire. This temple was designed by church architect Emil B. Fetzer, using a modern architectural style. A groundbreaking ceremony, to signify the beginning of construction, was held on March 13, 1999, conducted by John B. Dickson of the Seventy. 

==History==
The Kona Hawaii Temple was announced May 7, 1998, with a groundbreaking ceremony presided over by John B. Dickson of the Seventy then held on March 13, 1999. Approximately 1,200 people attended the groundbreaking ceremonies. Dickson, Donald L. Hallstrom, an area seventy, Hilo stake president John Sakamaki, and Kona stake president Philip A. Harris each spoke at the ceremony. Dickson turned over the first shovelful of dirt, after which other onlookers, including many children, participated.

After construction was completed, a public open house was held from January 12–15, 2000. LDS Church president Gordon B. Hinckley dedicated the temple on January 23–24, 2000. Hinckley was accompanied to the dedication by Boyd K. Packer, Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and Hallstrom. More than 3,800 church members attended the dedicatory sessions.

In 2020, like all the church&#x27;s others, the Kona Hawaii Temple was closed for a time in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

On August 29, 2022, the First Presidency announced that the temple would close for renovations. It closed in October 2023, with renovations expected to be completed by late 2025. The renovations will expand the temple from 9,500 square feet to 12,000 square feet.

The temple dedication was considered the first event in a yearlong commemoration of the sesquicentennial of the church in Hawaii.

Steve Young, a member of the National Football League&#x27;s Hall of Fame and his wife, Barbara Graham, were married in the Kona Hawaii Temple on March 15, 2000.

== Design and architecture ==
The temple is on a 7-acre site, with views of the ocean and Mount Hualalai. The building has a modern architectural style and uses traditional Latter-day Saint temple design. Designed by Emil B. Fetzer, its architecture reflects both the cultural heritage of Kona and its spiritual significance to the church.

The majority of the building was constructed with cast stone containing white marble chips; while there is no noticeable visible difference, the tower was built with fiberglass to make it lighter. The temple has two ordinance rooms, two sealing rooms, and a baptistry, each designed for ceremonial use. 

The design uses elements representing Latter-day Saint symbolism to provide deeper spiritual meaning to its appearance and function. Symbolism is important to church members and includes the statue of the angel Moroni on top of the temple’s steeple, which symbolizes “the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ.”

== Temple presidents ==
The church&#x27;s temples are directed by a temple president and matron, each serving for a term of three years. The president and matron oversee the administration of temple operations and provide guidance and training for both temple patrons and staff.

Serving from 2000 to 2002, the first president was Larry R. Oler, with Midge J. Oler serving as matron. As of 2025, the temple’s president and matron are Edward Lincoln Reinhardt and Gail Tsurue Minami Reinhardt.

== Admittance ==
Following completion of construction, the church announced the public open house that was held from January 12-15, 2000 (excluding Sundays). The temple was dedicated by Gordon B. Hinckley on January 23 and 24, 2000, in four sessions.

Like all the church&#x27;s temples, it is not used for Sunday worship services. To members of the church, temples are regarded as sacred houses of the Lord. Once dedicated, only church members with a current temple recommend can enter for worship. The Kona Hawaii Temple is currently closed for renovations.

<doc id="797445" wikidata="Q1259586" url="?curid=797445" title="Yellow-naped amazon">
<text>The yellow-naped amazon or yellow-naped parrot (Amazona auropalliata) is a widespread amazon parrot sometimes considered to be a subspecies of the yellow-crowned amazon (&quot;Amazona ochrocephala&quot;). It inhabits the Pacific coast of southern Mexico and Central America. It has been recently been reclassified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN Red List due to a dramatic decline across the extent of its range. Yellow-naped amazons have lost more than 92% of their population over the last three generations.

The primary cause for their population decline are deforestation and illegal removal of young for the parrot trade. This parrot readily mimics sounds, and in captivity, this includes human speech, which is probably the reason it is popular in aviculture. Like all parrots, however, mimicking abilities vary greatly between individuals. Recent surveys of the Costa Rican population across an 11-year time span found a significant decline in their population. Despite this decline, the Costa Rican population is considered to be the stronghold for the species.

==Description==
The yellow-naped amazon is distinguished by its green forehead and crown and a yellow band across the lower nape (back part of neck) and hindneck. The eyes are orange, beak is dark gray and is paler towards the base of the upper mandible. The feet are also dark gray.

Yellow-naped amazons inhabit dry forest and mangrove habitat of the tropics, and nest in naturally occurring cavities Although yellow-naped amazons will not excavate cavities, they will chew the entrance. The parrots will nest in a wide variety of trees, although dead Coyols (palm trees) are one preferred species. During the breeding season, pairs are monogamous, and pairs defend small breeding territories around the nest by duetting with their partners. Breeding success is low (89%), and the majority of nests fail due to poaching 

The vocal behavior of yellow-naped amazons has been more extensively studied than in any other wild parrot. Yellow-naped amazons, like all parrots, exhibit vocal learning behavior in the wild. This behavior manifests in the form of vocal dialects, in which the repertoire of calls that parrots vocalize change at discrete geographic boundaries, similar to how humans have different languages or dialects. These dialects also are meaningful to the parrots; they are less responsive to calls that are not their own dialect. Dialects are also stable over long periods of time.

Mated pairs of yellow-naped amazons also duet together on their territories in highly complex ways; they produce precisely coordinated and synchronized sequences of calls. These duets are organized by syntactic rules, in which the order and structure of notes changes in predetermined but flexible ways. Neighboring pairs of birds will counter-duet, in which pairs will rapidly exchange duets. This behavior appears similar to the counter-singing observed in male songbirds. These displays will at times become so heated that physical fights will occur at territory boundaries, although these are rare.

==Taxonomy==
Three subspecies are recognized:
* &quot;A. a. auropalliata&quot;: Southern Mexico to northwestern Costa Rica.
* &quot;A. a. parvipes&quot;: The Mosquito Coast in eastern Honduras and northeastern Nicaragua.
* &quot;A. a. caribaea&quot;: Bay Islands, Honduras.

==Range and habitat==
It is found along the Pacific Coast from southern Mexico south to northern Costa Rica. Recent census efforts have indicated declining populations throughout much of the range, with reduced populations in Costa Rica and Nicaragua and vanishingly small populations in Honduras, Mexico and Guatemala (Dupin et al. 2020, Wright et al. 2018). The Mesoamerican Parrot Census Network, with support of the World Parrot Trust, has been engaging volunteers to assess the status of yellow-naped amazons across their range to assist with conservation.

In common with many parrot species, it feeds on nuts, berries, seeds, and fruit.

==In captivity==
Yellow-naped amazons are highly sought after for their talking ability and playful personalities. They are also known for nest-protective behaviors that often lead them to bite. This is particularly common in males during the breeding season. While they do not always handle emotions well, they will signal when stressed or over excited by spreading (fanning) their tail and eye pinning (contracting and expanding the pupils of their eyes). If they are allowed to calm down before they are handled, bites are not common. Yellow-naped amazons, as with many other parrots, tend to bond with one member of a household and may be jealous of others.

Yellow-naped amazons do enjoy the stimulation of interacting with people, however. The more they are socialized, the more comfortable they will be around humans and animals.

Yellow-naped amazons are cavity-nesting birds in their wild habitat, therefore they enjoy chewing. Because of this, they should be supplied with bird-safe and non-toxic toys to chew. They also enjoy manipulating objects and interacting with them.

A rare blue mutation of the yellow-naped amazon is known to exist in which the entire body is turquoise in color.

<doc id="797448" wikidata="Q2356572" url="?curid=797448" title="Consualia">
<text>The Consualia or Consuales Ludi was the name of two ancient Roman festivals in honor of Consus, a tutelary deity of the harvest and stored grain. &quot;Consuales Ludi&quot; harvest festivals were held on August 21, and again on December 15, in connection with grain storage. The shrine of Consus was underground, it was covered with earth all year and was only uncovered for this one day. Mars, the god of war, as a protector of the harvest, was also honored on this day, as were the Lares, the household gods that individual families held sacred.

During the celebration horses, mules, and asses were exempted from all labour, and were led through the streets adorned with garlands and flowers. Chariot races were held this day in the Circus Maximus, which included an odd race in which chariots were pulled by mules.

In Roman mythology, the Consualia was founded by Romulus as an occasion to gather his Sabine neighbors. When the community was assembled and in a state of drunken festivity, Romulus&#x27;s men abducted the daughters of the Sabines to become their brides (see &quot;The Rape of the Sabine Women&quot;).

There were also sacrifices to Consus on 7 July. Consus&#x27; feasts were followed by those of the related goddess Ops: the Opiconsivia on 25 August and the Opalia on 19 December.

According to Livy, the festival honors Neptune.

<text>A gastrectomy is a partial or total surgical removal of the stomach.

==Indications==

Gastrectomies are performed to treat stomach cancer and perforations of the stomach wall.

For severe duodenal ulcers, it may be necessary to remove the lower portion of the stomach and the upper portion of the small intestine. If there is a sufficient portion of the upper duodenum remaining, a Billroth I procedure is performed, where the remaining portion of the stomach is reattached to the duodenum before the common bile duct. If the stomach cannot be reattached to the duodenum, a Billroth II is performed, wherein the remaining portion of the duodenum is sealed off, a hole is cut into the next section of the small intestine (called the jejunum), and the stomach is reattached at this hole. As the pylorus is used to grind food and slowly release the food into the small intestine, removal of the pylorus can cause food to move into the small intestine faster than normal, leading to gastric dumping syndrome.

==Polya&#x27;s operation==
Also known as the Reichel–Polya operation, this is a type of posterior gastroenterostomy which is a modification of the Billroth II operation developed by Eugen Pólya and Friedrich Paul Reichel. It involves a resection of 2/3 of the stomach with blind closure of the duodenal stump, and a retrocolic gastrojejunostomy.

==Post-operative effects==
The most obvious effect of the removal of the stomach is the loss of a storage place for food while it is being digested. Since only a small amount of food can be allowed into the small intestine at a time, the patient will have to eat small amounts of food regularly in order to prevent gastric dumping syndrome.

Another major effect is the loss of the intrinsic-factor-secreting parietal cells in the stomach lining. Intrinsic factor is essential for the uptake of vitamin B12 in the terminal ileum, and without it the patient will develop a vitamin B12 deficiency. This can lead to a type of anaemia known as megaloblastic anaemia (can also be caused by folate deficiency, or autoimmune disease where it is specifically known as pernicious anaemia) which severely reduces red-blood cell synthesis (known as erythropoiesis, as well as other haematological cell lineages if severe enough but the red cell is the first to be affected). This can be treated by giving the patient direct injections of vitamin B12. Iron-deficiency anemia can occur as the stomach normally converts iron into its absorbable form.

Another side effect is the loss of ghrelin production, which has been shown to be compensated after a while. Lastly, this procedure is post-operatively associated with decreased bone density and higher incidence of bone fractures. This may be due to the importance of gastric acid in calcium absorption.

Post-operatively, up to 70% of patients undergoing total gastrectomy develop complications such as dumping syndrome and reflux esophagitis. A meta-analysis of 25 studies found that construction of a &quot;pouch&quot;, which serves as a &quot;stomach substitute&quot;, reduced the incidence of dumping syndrome and reflux esophagitis by 73% and 63% respectively, and led to improvements in quality-of-life, nutritional outcomes, and body mass index.

After Bilroth II surgery, a small amount of residual gastric tissue may remain in the duodenum. The alkaline environment causes the retained gastric tissue to produce acid, which may result in ulcers in a rare complication known as retained antrum syndrome.

All patients lose weight after gastrectomy, although the extent of weight loss is dependent on the extent of surgery (total gastrectomy vs partial gastrectomy) and the pre-operative BMI. Maximum weight loss occurs by 12 months and many patients regain weight afterwards.

==History==
The first successful gastrectomy was performed by Theodor Billroth in 1881 for cancer of the stomach.

Historically, gastrectomies were used to treat peptic ulcers. These are now usually treated with antibiotics, as it was recognized that they are usually due to &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; infection or chemical imbalances in the gastric juices.

In the past a gastrectomy for peptic ulcer disease was often accompanied by a vagotomy, to reduce acid production. This problem is now managed with proton pump inhibitors.

<text>Umag (; ; ) is a coastal town in Istria, Croatia.

Its patron saint is St. Peregrine.

==Geography==
It is the westernmost town of Croatia, and it includes Bašanija, the westernmost point of Croatia.

==Demographics==
According to the 2021 census, its population was 12,699 with 6,751 living in the city proper.

Umag had a population of 7,281, with a total municipal population of 13,467 according to the 2011 census. Like many other towns in Istria, Umag has a multi-ethnic population. Croats, because of the exodus of many Italians after the Second World War, are nowadays an absolute majority with 59.6%; Italians 18.3%, Serbs 3.8%, Slovenes 2.2%, Bosniaks 1.7%, Albanians 1.3% and those regionally declared (as Istrians) make up the final 1.57%.
However, according to the 1921 census, 100% of the population spoke Italian. This does not mean that all residents were ethnic Italians at the time. Croatians also used Italian as their primary language in official contexts.

==History==
Umag was mentioned for the first time in the 7th century by an anonymous citizen from Ravenna, but it already existed in Roman times. Proof of this is found in the numerous remains of Roman villas, the so-called villa rustica uncovered all along the coast. The town&#x27;s history is closely linked to the settlement of Sipar, whose ruins can be found on a narrow cape four kilometres north of Umag. In the 9th century, the fortified settlement of Sipar was devastated by invaders, the Neretva pirates. However, after this unfortunate incident Umag grew in significance thanks also to its location, a small islet separated from the mainland by a narrow channel. It was actually this location that safeguarded the settlement from the continuous invasions down through the centuries. The Roman period of relative prosperity was interspersed with one of insecurity caused primarily by frequent invasions, outbreaks of plague, cholera, and malaria. The number of its inhabitants declined rapidly. Umag became part of the reigns of Odoacer, Theodoric, and was also ruled by the Langobards.

From the 6th to the 8th centuries it fell under Byzantine dominion, followed by the rule of the Lombards in 751 and Francs in 774. The subsequent period was marked by insecurity and frequent changes of government ranging from the Patriarchs of Grado and Aquileia to the Bishops of Trieste. However, the increasingly powerful Venetian Republic imposed its rule over Istria, forcing Umag and other western Istrian towns to swear loyalty to Venice. In fact, in 1269, the Commune of Umag swore loyalty to Venice which from that time on 1797 was to appoint governors of Umag from among its nobility. This period was by no means a peaceful one.

Century-old clashes with Genoa brought about more destruction and looting. In 1370 the Genoese navy attacked Umag, destroying the town&#x27;s archive. The outbreaks of plague that decimated the inhabitants forced the Venetian authorities to consider colonising the area with new settlers, mainly from the territories threatened by Turkish invasions. The harbour of Umag was utilised for loading agricultural surplus from the hinterland. Up to the collapse of Venice Umag had lived like other Istrian towns. Its communal arrangement was guaranteed by Statute from 1541.

With the fall of the Venetian Republic, Umag, like the entire eastern Adriatic coast, came under the rule of France until 1815 when it passed over to Austria until 1918. With the end of World War I Istria became part of Italy. After World War II, the flaring up of the Trieste crises resulted in the establishment of the Free Territory of Trieste, while Umag became part of Zone B governed by the Yugoslav Army, and eventually became part of SR Croatia within SFR Yugoslavia in 1954. After Umag became part of Yugoslavia, there was an exodus of many Italians from the town, who, until then, had constituted the majority of its population.

In 1993, with the establishment of the new local rule, Umag became an independent municipality, and, in 1997, was awarded the status of town (&quot;grad&quot;).

==Economy==

The natural features of the area have considerably influenced the development of the economy as a whole. The geographical location of Umag, in particular, has ensured an intensive and dynamic growth of the tourist industry after World War II, which has been expanding rapidly ever since. The closeness of big west European markets and the rise in standard of East European countries have both accounted for the expansion of this economic branch which is tightly linked to other economic resources in the region the most significant being agriculture. The best fertile soil and the vast arable land in the area have fostered the production of traditional Mediterranean crops present in the region for thousands of years, with particular emphasis on olive growing and wine grape growing.

The latter accounts for a successful winemaking industry and the emerging in recent years of a number of highly renowned local wine makers that can be traced in the wine chart of Istria. Linked with agriculture is the rapidly expanding tourist branch agro-tourism which has not only enriched the tourist offer but is also committed to preserving the old-world values of the region. Apart from that, mention must be made of the &quot;Podravka&quot; food factory in Umag where huge quantities of tomatoes were processed. The factory was closed in 2023 which marked the end of tomato growing industry in this part of Istria. The food industry started in Umag in the early 20th century with the opening of the &quot;Arrigoni&quot; plant for packing fish and tomatoes and the building of a flour mill, the predecessor of today&#x27;s bakery and biscuit factory.

Today new factories have grown up in two industrial zones (Ungarija and Kravlji rt), which are provided with the necessary infrastructure continuously rebuilt and enlarged. The economic growth of Umag is based on the stimulation and support of small and medium-sized firms and the establishment of business zones. For that purpose, the town authorities have set apart 355,200.00 kuna for the programme aimed at stimulating the growth of agriculture and businesses for the year 2002. Besides, Umag is the founding member of the &quot;Istarska razvojna agencija&quot; IDA (Istrian Development Agency), with its seat in Pula.

==Events==
Umag hosts Sea Star Festival every May since 2017

The town hosts an annual ATP tennis tournament on clay courts.

<doc id="797469" wikidata="Q1633270" url="?curid=797469" title="Hubert Lamb">
<text>Hubert Horace Lamb (22 September 1913 in Bedford – 28 June 1997 in Holt, Norfolk) was an English climatologist who founded the Climatic Research Unit in 1972 in the School of Environmental Sciences at the University of East Anglia.

==Career==
Most of Lamb&#x27;s scientific life was spent at the Meteorological Office, UK, where he started as a Technical Officer progressing by special merit promotion. As a Quaker and conscientious objector, Lamb refused to work on the meteorology of gas spraying during World War II, and was transferred to the Irish Meteorological Service, then still closely associated with the UK Met Office. On returning to the UK service after the war his responsibilities were in the fields of long range weather forecasting, world climatology and climate change. In this capacity he was assigned to West Germany and Malta. Earlier he was also posted as meteorological adviser on a Norwegian whaling factory ship to Antarctica. He became a member of the World Meteorological Organization&#x27;s Working Group on Climate Fluctuations.

Lamb was one of the first to propose that climate could change within human experience, going against the orthodox view of the time that climate could be treated as constant for practical purposes. He developed early theories about the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age. He became known for his prediction of gradual global cooling and a coming glacial period (colloquially an &quot;ice age&quot;), and he subsequently highlighted a more immediate future prospect of global warming.

===Medieval warm epoch===
In 1965 he published his study on &quot;The early medieval warm epoch and its sequel&quot;, based on &quot;data from the realms of botany, historical document research and meteorology&quot;. His view was that &quot;Evidence has been accumulating in many fields of investigation pointing to a notably warm climate in many parts of the world, that lasted a few centuries around A.D. 1000–1200, and was followed by a decline of temperature levels till between 1500 and 1700 the coldest phase since the last ice age occurred.&quot; The paper included a series of diagrams of temperatures in central England over the period, simplified in a 1982 version adjusted to account for &quot;probable under-reporting of mild winters in Medieval times&quot; and &quot;certain botanical considerations&quot; including historical records of vineyards in southern and eastern England. This version was featured in the IPCC First Assessment Report of 1990, figure 7.1c on p. 202, as a &quot;Schematic diagram of global temperature variations for the last thousand years.&quot;

===Climatic Research Unit===
In 1971 Lamb decided to base his pioneering research at a university, and he became the first director of the Climatic Research Unit established in 1972 in the School of Environmental Sciences at the University of East Anglia. In 1973 and 1975 he arranged for two international conferences which were hosted in Norwich. He was known as &quot;the ice man&quot; because of his view that global cooling would lead to a future glacial period within 10,000 years with some abrupt cooling phases occurring &quot;within one to two thousand years&quot;. However he also acknowledged that global warming could have serious effects within a century. His warnings of damage to agriculture, ice caps melting, and cities being flooded caught widespread attention and helped to shape public opinion. He gained the unit sponsorship from seven major insurance companies, who wanted to make use of the research of the unit when making their own studies of the implications of climate change for insurance against storm and flood damage. He retired from the unit in 1978, and his contributions to the unit were recognised in 1981 when he was granted an honorary Doctorate of Science.

===Abrupt climate change and global warming===
Lamb&#x27;s 1977 book &quot;Climatic History and the Future&quot; described studies of fossil pollen showing an abrupt change from a glacial era of pinewoods to oak trees, pointing to &quot;great rapidity of climate change&quot;. He discussed research on the complex effects of human caused pollution, and suggested that &quot;On balance, the effects of increased carbon dioxide on climate is almost certainly in the direction of warming but is probably much smaller than the estimates which have commonly been accepted.&quot;

In the preface to his 1984 edition of the book, Lamb noted studies of the &quot;carbon dioxide problem&quot; and called for more investigation of past climate, particularly &quot;evidence that some major climatic changes took place surprisingly quickly.&quot; He outlined recent research suggesting that the next glaciation would begin in 3,000 to 7,000 years, and wrote &quot;It is to be noted here that there is no necessary contradiction between forecast expectations of (a) some renewed (or continuation of) slight cooling of world climate for some years to come, e.g. from volcanic or solar activity variations; (b) an abrupt warming due to the effect of increasing carbon dioxide, lasting some centuries until fossil fuels are exhausted and a while thereafter; and this followed in turn by (c) a glaciation lasting (like the previous ones) for many thousands of years.”

==Awards==
* 1974 - Murchison Award of the Royal Geographical Society, UK
* 1984 - Vega Medal of the Swedish Geographical Society
* 1986 - Symons Gold Medal of the Royal Meteorological Society 
* 1997 - European Geophysical Society Honorary Membership 

==Commemoration==
In August 2006, the Climatic Research Unit Building in the School of Environmental Sciences at the University of East Anglia was renamed the Hubert Lamb Building.
In the same year, Lamb was hailed as &#x27;instrumental in establishing the study of climate change as a serious research subject&#x27; in a report listing the &#x27;top 100 world-changing discoveries, innovations and research projects to come out of the UK universities in the last 50 years&#x27;.

In September 2013, the centenary of Lamb&#x27;s birth was commemorated by a symposium at the University of East Anglia, co-organised with the Royal Meteorological Society.

==Family==
Lamb was son of Ernest Horace Lamb (1878–1946), DSC, DSc, professor of engineering at Queen Mary College, London, and Lilian, daughter of the Rev. G. H. Brierley. He was a grandson of the mathematician Horace Lamb, whose influence he credited for his own early career at the Meteorological Office, and a nephew of the classicist Walter Lamb, the painter Henry Lamb and the archaeologist Dorothy Lamb. His son Norman Lamb was the Liberal Democrat MP for North Norfolk from 2001 until 2019.

<text>Fromage blanc (; ; also known as maquée) is a fresh cheese similar to cream cheese originating from the north of France and southern Belgium. The name means &quot;white cheese&quot; in French. &quot;Fromage frais&quot; (&quot;fresh cheese&quot;) differs from &quot;fromage blanc&quot; in that, according to French legislation, &quot;fromage frais&quot; must contain live cultures when sold, whereas with &quot;fromage blanc&quot;, fermentation has been halted.

&quot;Fromage blanc&quot; can be served either as a dessert similar to yogurt, frequently with added fruit, spread on bread, usually over or under jam, or used in savoury dishes. In many Western countries, &quot;fromage blanc&quot; is sold in supermarkets alongside yogurts.

<doc id="797472" wikidata="Q995607" url="?curid=797472" title="Bone ash">
<text>Bone ash is a white material produced by the calcination of bones. Typical bone ash consists of about 55.82% calcium oxide, 42.39% phosphorus pentoxide, and 1.79% water. The exact composition of these compounds varies depending upon the type of bones being used, but generally the formula for bone ash is Ca5(OH)(PO4)3. Bone ash usually has a density around 3.10 g/mL and a melting point of 1670 °C (3038 °F). Most bones retain their cellular structure through calcination.

==History==
===Antiquity===
Burnt bones have been recovered from numerous Ancient Greek sanctuaries dating from the Late Bronze Age up to the Hellenistic period. The burnt bones are often calcined with a white or blueish color, allowing archaeologists to identify them as sacrificial remains. At the sanctuary to Artemis in Eretria a round altar of fieldstones filled with soil was found, dating to the 8th century BC. The upper surface was covered with clay and animal bones were burned on top, then apparently swept off the surface with terracotta, metal objects, and pottery and trampled until the altar was eventually subsumed by the ritual debris. Some scholars have attributed these altars to chthonian rituals, but this is disputed. Xenocrates of Aphrodisias reported its use as a medicinal ingredient, although cannibalism was, according to Galen, prohibited under the laws of the Roman Empire.

==Uses==
===Bone china===

Bone ash is a key raw material for bone china. Constituting around 50% of the body, it reacts with other raw materials in the body during firing to form, amongst other phases, anorthite.

In preparation for use in bone china, bones undergo multiple processing stages, including:
* Removal of any meat before being degreased.
* Calcination to around 1000 °C (1832 °F). This will remove all organic matter, and the bone is left sterilised.
* Being ground with water to fine particle size.
* Being partially dewatered.

Since the 1990s, the use of synthetic alternatives to bone ash, which are based on dicalcium phosphate and tricalcium phosphate, has increased. Significant amounts of bone china is produced using these synthetic alternatives rather than bone ash.

===Fertilizers===
Bone ash can be used alone as an organic fertilizer or it can be treated with sulfuric acid to form a &quot;single superphosphate&quot; fertilizer which is more water soluble:

:Ca3(PO4)2 + 2 H2SO4 + 5 H2O → 2 CaSO4·2H2O + Ca(H2PO4)2·H2O

Similarly, phosphoric acid can be used to form triple superphosphate, a more concentrated phosphorus fertilizer which excludes the gypsum content found in single superphosphate:

:Ca3(PO4)2 + 4 H3PO4 → 3 Ca(H2PO4)2

===Metal casting===

Bone ash is used in foundries for various purposes. Examples include release agents and protective barriers for tools exposed to molten metal, and as a sealant for seams and cracks. Applied as a powder or water slurry, bone ash has many unique characteristics. First of all, the powder has high thermal stability, so it maintains its form in extremely high temperatures. The powder coating itself adheres to metal well and does not drip, run, cause much corrosion, or create noticeable streaks. Using the bone ash is easy as well, as it comes in a powder form, is easy to clean up, and does not separate into smaller parts (therefore requiring no extra mixing).

===Metallurgy===
Bone ash is a material often used in cupellation, a process by which precious metals (such as gold and silver) are removed from base metals.

In cupellation, base metals in an impure sample are oxidized with the help of lead and are vaporized and absorbed into a porous cupellation material, typically made of magnesium or calcium. This leaves the precious metals which do not oxidize behind. Bone ash&#x27;s extremely porous and calcareous structure as well as its high melting point makes it an ideal candidate for cupellation.

==Analysis of bone ash==
The chemical analyses, determined by X-ray fluorescence and reported as %, of three samples of ceramic grade bone ash:

==In culture==
===Bible===
From Isaiah: &quot;And the people shall be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire&quot;

Its use is mentioned in the Book of Amos (2:1): &quot;I will not turn away the punishment thereof, because he burned the bones of the King of Edom into lime.&quot;

It was used in ancient formulas for white paint and cosmetic pigments, and in the cupellation process to separate silver from lead.

<text>Saturday Night was a Canadian general interest magazine. It was founded in Toronto, Ontario in 1887 and was Canada&#x27;s oldest general interest magazine. The magazine ceased publication in 2005.

== History ==
&quot;Saturday Night&quot; was first established in 1887 as a weekly broadsheet newspaper about public affairs and the arts, and was later expanded into a general interest magazine. The editor, Edmund E. Sheppard, was prevented from editing a daily newspaper due to an earlier libel action in regards to an incident involving Louis Riel. Additionally, the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Day Act&quot; in Toronto prevented publication on Sunday. So, in its first years, the paper was restricted to being a weekly publication, published on Saturdays, hence the name. It had a circulation of 10,000. In 1925 the magazine sold 30,858 copies.

&quot;Saturday Night&quot; went through a number of owners, formats, and frequencies of publication. Its content went through periods where it would focus more on news, and at other times a greater focus on feature columns. In 1949, Its format size was reduced from broadsheet to magazine size. In 1952, Jack Kent Cooke became the magazine&#x27;s publisher after he purchased its owner, Consolidated Press, and it entered a period of decline, and switched from weekly to fortnightly publication in 1954. Under Cooke, the magazine &quot;lost its character and pre-eminence&quot; as a cultural magazine, with Cooke attempting to change it into a newsmagazine, similar to &quot;TIME&quot;. In 1961, Kent sold the magazine to Percy Bishop, an oil and mining entrepreneur and supporter of the far-right Alberta Social Credit League. The next year Bishop merged &quot;Saturday Night&quot; with his other publications &quot;The Canadian&quot;, a right-wing magazine he had started to promote his political views. &quot;Saturday Night&quot; editor-in-chief Arnold Edinborough and six other members of the editorial board resigned in protest Bishop&#x27;s renamed magazine, &quot;Canadian Saturday Night&quot;, was edited by one-time Social Credit candidate Arthur Lowe and folded after three issues. &quot;Saturday Night&quot; was revived in 1963 by Edinborough who purchased the magazine with $100,000 of his own money and some funding from the family of Robertson Davies, and thus also becoming its publisher, and circulation grew to 90,000.

Robert Fulford was the magazine&#x27;s editor from 1968 to 1987. Under his editorial guidance, the magazine enjoyed critical success and expanded its arts and literary coverage and was also an important source of long-form political reportage, much of it by Christina McCall. However, financial difficulties continued. Losing money, in 1971 Edinborough sold the magazine for $1 to a non-profit foundation. In 1974, the magazine again ceased publication for six months due to financial difficulties until it was purchased by a group of funders led by developer Murray Frum and a $100,000 grant from Imperial Oil. Norman Webster, whose family owned the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot;, purchased the magazine in 1979. Under Fulford, &quot;Saturday Night&quot; also featured short stories and poetry and gave poet Dennis Lee and writer Margaret Atwood their first national exposure.

Works by Robertson Davies (who was the magazine&#x27;s literary editor in the 1940s), Michael Ignatieff, Peter Gzowski, Mordecai Richler, and portrait photographer Yousuf Karsh were also featured in the magazine in its heyday.

=== Demise ===
The magazine was purchased by Conrad Black by his company Hollinger Inc. in 1987. The magazine lost money for Black for the years he owned it, never recovering even in the late 1990s when many other Canadian magazines saw their fortunes improve. The last standalone monthly issue was March 2000 (Vol 115 No 2, Issue #3819) under editor Paul Tough. In addition to newsstand distribution, the magazine was included as a weekend supplement in subscription copies of several Hollinger newspapers, although in 1992 Hollinger began offering subscribers the option of switching to &quot;The Idler&quot; instead of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;.

After a hiatus of two months it was relaunched as a weekend magazine insert within Black&#x27;s &quot;National Post&quot;, continuing as Vol 115 No 3, Issue #3819. It was issued weekly in this format under the editorship of Dianna Symonds until September 22, 2001 (Vol 116 No 35 Issue #3885) when it was cancelled as part of CanWest&#x27;s cutbacks at the &quot;National Post&quot;.

The title was saved, however, when it was purchased by MultiVision Publishing and re-emerged under editor Matthew Church as a bimonthly (and later 10 times-a-year) newsstand magazine (with some copies inserted in subscription &quot;National Post&quot;s) beginning in April 2002 as Vol 117, No 1, Issue #3886. Later purchased by St. Joseph Media, publication was ended in November 2005 with Issue #3916, which is at present the last printed issue of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;.

On October 20, 2005, the company announced that publication would be &quot;suspended&quot; due to insufficient advertiser support. The editor at the time of suspension was Gary Ross, who had been editor since 2004.

=== Blog ===
On December 18, 2008, the &quot;Saturday Night&quot; website was relaunched as a blog, with the initial post indicating that the site would &quot;canvas the country and present you with a unique and intriguing perspective on our national life in politics and power, sex and crime, entertainment and culture, arts and literature, style and design.&quot; However, after several posts made that day, the blog appeared to be abandoned and was not updated in the months following launch.

<doc id="797479" wikidata="Q88921" url="?curid=797479" title="Cabal (video game)">
<text>is a 1988 arcade shooter video game originally developed by TAD Corporation and published in Japan by Taito, in North America by Fabtek and in Europe by Capcom. In the game, the player controls a commando, viewed from behind, trying to destroy various enemy military bases. The game was innovative for the era, but only a mild success in the arcades, and became better known for its various home conversions.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Cabal&quot; has one-player and two-player-simultaneous modes of gameplay. Each player assumes the role of an unnamed commando trying to destroy several enemy military bases. There are 5 stages with four screens each. The player starts with a stock of three lives and uses a gun with limitless ammunition and a fixed number of grenades to fend off enemy troops and attack the base. The commando is seen from behind and starts behind a protective wall which can be damaged and shattered by enemy fire. To stay alive, the player needs to avoid enemy bullets by running left or right, hiding behind cover, or using a dodge-roll. An enemy gauge at the bottom of the screen depletes as foes are destroyed and certain structures (which collapse rather than shatter) are brought down. When the enemy gauge is emptied, the level is successfully completed, all of the remaining buildings onscreen collapse, and the player progresses to the next stage. If a player is killed, he is immediately revived at the cost of one life or the game ends if they have no lives remaining. Boss fights, however, restart from the beginning if the only remaining player dies.

From time to time, power-ups are released from objects destroyed onscreen. Some power-ups give special weapons such as an extremely fast-firing machine gun or an automatic shotgun with a lower firing rate and larger area of effect. Others grant extra grenades or additional points.

The arcade cabinet is a standard upright cabinet. Each player uses a trackball to move their character from side to side and move the crosshairs about the screen. On later board revisions, a joystick was installed instead with an optional sub-PCB for use with a trackball. With a trackball, dodge-rolling is done by pushing the trackball to maximum speed.

&quot;Cabal&quot; was somewhat innovative in that it featured a 3D perspective in which the player character was situated in the foreground with an over-the-shoulder camera view, similar to modern third-person shooters. Players cannot move the character while firing (holding down the fire button gives players control of the aiming cursor), and when moving the character to avoid incoming bullets, the aiming cursor moves along in tandem. This creates the need for a careful balance between offensive and defensive tactics, separating &quot;Cabal&quot; from run-and-gun shooters which relied more on reflexes. Advanced gameplay involves destructible asset management in balancing dodging (which gets riskier as the number of enemy projectiles on screen increases) with the safer alternative of taking cover behind a protective but limited durability wall.

== Ports and related releases ==
&quot;Cabal&quot; was ported to several home computers of the era, including the DOS computers, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Atari ST and Amiga. It was also ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System console by Rare. A version for the Atari Lynx was previewed and even slated to be published in April 1992, but was never released by Fabtek.

When converting the game to the Nintendo Entertainment System, Rare were given a &quot;Cabal&quot; cabinet but did not have access to the game&#x27;s source code, so they had to play the game over and over and redraw the graphics from memory. To accommodate the many layers and sprites of the arcade game, programmer Anthony Ball used a common coding trick: swapping sprites from left to right every other frame. This has the negative side effect of causing the sprites to flicker when they reach the console&#x27;s limit of eight per line, but Ball, like many programmers of the era, found this an acceptable trade-off for including all the game&#x27;s content, and in a 2016 interview he said he is happy with the quality of the conversion.

&quot;Cabal&quot; was followed in 1990 by &quot;Blood Bros.&quot;, though the sequel had a western theme as opposed to &quot;Cabal&quot;&#x27;s Vietnam War-era theme.

== Reception and legacy ==

In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Cabal&quot; on their November 1, 1988, issue as being the eighth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.

The arcade version was reviewed by Clare Edgeley in &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; magazine. She gave it a positive review, while comparing it favorably with &quot;Operation Wolf&quot; (1987) and &quot;Combat School&quot; (1987). Nick Kelly of &quot;Commodore User&quot; rated &quot;Cabal&quot; seven out of ten, comparing it favorably with &quot;Gryzor&quot; (1987) and &quot;Devastators&quot; (1988).

The ZX Spectrum version won the award for best advert of the year according to the readers of &quot;Crash&quot;.

The game&#x27;s success inspired many &quot;Cabal&quot; clones, such as &quot;NAM-1975&quot; (1990) and &quot;Wild Guns&quot; (1994).

<text>The Beurs van Berlage (literally &quot;Berlage&#x27;s stock market&quot;) is a building on the Damrak, in the centre of Amsterdam. It was designed as a commodity exchange by architect Hendrik Petrus Berlage and constructed between 1896 and 1903. It influenced many modernist architects, in particular functionalists and the Amsterdam School. It is now used as a venue for concerts, exhibitions and conferences.

The building is constructed of red brick, with an iron and glass roof, and stone piers, lintels and corbels. Its entrance is under a high clock tower, while inside lie three large multi-storey halls formerly used as trading floors, with offices and communal facilities grouped around them.

The aim of the architect was to modify the styles of the past by emphasizing sweeping planes and open plan interiors. It has stylistic similarities with some earlier buildings, for instance St Pancras station and the work of H. H. Richardson in America, or the Castell dels Tres Dragons, Barcelona, by Lluís Domènech i Montaner. True to its nineteenth-century roots, it maintains the use of ornament in a civic structure.

On 2 February 2002 the civil ceremony of the wedding of King Willem-Alexander and Máxima Zorreguieta took place in the Beurs van Berlage.

The Beurs van Berlage has a café located on the Beursplein side and the tower is also open to the public.

<doc id="797484" wikidata="Q2784740" url="?curid=797484" title="Kyra (Charmed)">
<text>Kyra, also known by her title the Seer, is a fictional character from the American television supernatural drama &quot;Charmed&quot;, which aired on The WB Television Network (The WB) from 1998 to 2006. Kyra was created by executive producer Brad Kern and portrayed by actress Charisma Carpenter. Her original contract was a recurring role that included three episodes in the show&#x27;s season seven. &quot;TV Guide&quot; reported the WB had considered promoting her to a series regular.

A demon characterized by her powers of divination and precognition, she eventually forms a friendship with Leo Wyatt (Brian Krause) and the Charmed Ones, specifically Phoebe Halliwell (Alyssa Milano), after expressing her desire to become human. Although she was killed by the demon Zankou (Oded Fehr) on the show, Kyra is transported through time by the witch Prue Halliwell in the comics, saving her. She makes further canonical appearances in the comic book series &quot;&quot;. Her storylines focus on her involvement with Prue&#x27;s new destiny, and her romantic relationship with the newly revived Benjamin Turner (the father of half-demon Cole Turner).

Carpenter characterized Kyra through her sex appeal. Media outlets compared the character to Carpenter&#x27;s previous performance as Cordelia Chase on the supernatural dramas &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;. Kyra received primarily positive reviews from critics, who praised Carpenter&#x27;s performance. The character was also positively received in retrospective reviews. On the other hand, Television Without Pity&#x27;s Demian criticized Kyra as a carbon copy of Cordelia without any indicators of a unique identity.

== Appearances ==

=== Television ===
Kyra (Charisma Carpenter) is a demon who channels her powers of precognition and divination through the use of a magical pool. She can also &quot;shimmer&quot;, a method of teleportation used by demons. Introduced in season seven, Kyra helps Leo Wyatt (Brian Krause) uncover the identity of a masked demon attacking his son Wyatt Halliwell. She later works with the half-demon Sirk (Zack Ward) on his plans to track down and kill all of his mortal relatives in order to seal his transformation as a full demon.

As a demon, Kyra cannot feel emotions, although she is curious about the world of mortals. Longing to experience the emotions she sees in her visions, she contacts the Elders (a council of whitelighters which governs the forces of good) to make a deal where she would trade her information on a then-unknown threat, the Avatars, if she is made human. The Avatars are a group of magical beings capable of warping reality who devote themselves to creating a world without good or evil. As word of Kyra&#x27;s betrayal spreads across the Underworld, Leo is sent by the Avatars to save her and bring her to the Halliwell Manor during the negotiations. The Charmed OnesPiper Halliwell (Holly Marie Combs), Phoebe Halliwell (Alyssa Milano), and Paige Matthews (Rose McGowan)reluctantly agree to protect Kyra.

While at the manor, Kyra bonds with Phoebe over their shared power of premonition. To gain Phoebe&#x27;s trust, she guides her and Lieutenant Darryl Morris (Dorian Gregory) to Inspector Sheridan (Jenya Lano), a member of the San Francisco Police Department who was placed into a coma by FBI agent Kyle Brody (Kerr Smith). Brody had sequestered Sheridan in a psychiatric hospital after she discovered Piper, Phoebe, and Paige were witches. After some encouragement, Kyra shares her premonition of the Avatars with Phoebe. Although the Avatars were predicted to be a threat, Kyra&#x27;s vision shows Phoebe and her future daughter living in a utopia where demons no longer exist. After receiving the vision, Phoebe has a premonition that the demon Zankou (Oded Fehr) will vanquish Kyra. In order to prevent Kyra&#x27;s death, Phoebe convinces the Elders to provide a spell to turn Kyra human. During this time, Kyra forces Leo to reveal his true identity as an Avatar. While Piper helps her to prepare for her new life as a mortal, Kyra reveals her real name and abandons her title as &quot;the Seer&quot;. Zankou kills Kyra before she can be transformed into a mortal. Her death is a turning point for Piper and Phoebe as it pushes them to meet and help the Avatars build their new world.

=== Comics ===
Kyra appears in &quot;&quot;, the canonical comic book continuation of the television series. Prue Halliwell summons Kyra from the past to better understand her new identity as the guardian of the Nexus of the All—a spiritual energy that forms the basis of all magic. While performing a ritual to enter Kyra&#x27;s mind, Prue steals her powers of foresight to further understand herself and the All. As a reward for helping her, Prue turns Kyra into a mortal and gives her a soul. Despite being overjoyed at her transformation, Kyra is initially uncertain about her plans for the future.

Kyra decides to reconnect with Piper, Phoebe, and Paige and devote her life to doing good. She begins by helping the newly resurrected Benjamin Turner, the father of the half-human and half-demon Cole Turner, adjust to his new life. After spending time together, Kyra and Benjamin fall in love and begin a romantic relationship. Prue kidnaps Kyra, along with Benjamin and the archai (a magical being capable of opening portals through reality) Tyler Michaels. Kyra witnesses Prue perform a sacrificial ritual forcing Tyler to open portals in the sky that provide the Old Ones with access to the mortal world. Prue, while under the influence of the Old One Heremus, attacks Knox Academy, a school for magic, and turns its students and faculty into hosts for demons. Paige rescues Kyra, Benjamin, and Tyler. Following Prue&#x27;s death and the closure of the portals, Benjamin and Kyra take over Knox Academy.

=== Casting and creation ===
Charisma Carpenter was initially scheduled for at least two episodes of &quot;Charmed&quot;; she later confirmed on her official website that Kyra would be a recurring character. Carpenter joked that she was surprised to be considered for such a minor part on the show. In an article for &quot;Today&quot;, reader Patrick Kelly cited Carpenter&#x27;s appearances on &quot;Charmed&quot; as an indicator of her popularity among the 16- to 39-year-old male demographic. &quot;The Palm Beach Post&quot;″s Kevin D. Thompson said Carpenter was one of the &quot;guest-stars we can&#x27;t wait to see&quot; for the 2004–05 United States network television schedule. 

Kyra was created as a separate character from the Seer, played by Debbi Morgan, who was featured as an antagonist in the show&#x27;s fourth season. When discussing Kyra&#x27;s introduction, a writer for &quot;The Jackson Sun&quot; also characterized her as a villain. Carpenter had previously played a seer named Cordelia Chase in the television show &quot;Angel&quot;. Although she did not personally identify as a &quot;vision girl&quot;, Carpenter said she was often cast as a seer. In a 2019 &quot;Business Insider&quot; article, Jillian Selzer noted that Carpenter&#x27;s casting on &quot;Charmed&quot; was not surprising given her involvement on other supernatural shows.

According to &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s Kristin Veitch, representatives from The WB Television Network (The WB) issued a statement indicating the possibility of Kyra being promoted to star billing. Carpenter had been set to star in a mid-season replacement sitcom for United Paramount Network (UPN) called &quot;Like Cats and Dogs&quot;, but she was interested in doing more &quot;Charmed&quot; episodes if the pilot was not picked up the network. She said although she enjoyed working in the supernatural genre and viewed it as familiar territory, she was hesitant about committing to the show&#x27;s demanding shooting schedule as it would take time away from raising her son.

=== Characterization ===
In an interview with &quot;Charmed Magazine&quot;, Carpenter described Kyra as having a similar sassiness as Cordelia Chase, but clarified Kyra was &quot;totally evil and a lot sexier&quot; than Cordelia. She identified sexuality as the defining aspect of Kyra&#x27;s personality, referring to her as &quot;overtly sexual, coy, and kitteny&quot;. While she viewed Cordelia as a &quot;smartass&quot;, Carpenter defined Kyra as a &quot;temptress&quot; and a &quot;jezebel&quot;, and her flirtatious banter with Leo as a part of her own agenda. She said her approach to Kyra was influenced by her revealing outfit, feeling that every woman on &quot;Charmed&quot; had to look and act &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;notoriously sexy&quot;. Executive producer Brad Kern summed up the character as &quot;a seductress and a real smartass&quot;.

Pat Shand, the writer of &quot;Charmed: Season 10&quot;, said he incorporated Kyra in the comic book series because he enjoyed her dialogue and Carpenter&#x27;s performance; he wrote: &quot;To write dialogue for a character played by Charisma is to hear Charisma in your head. Who would turn that down?&quot;. Shand commended Carpenter&#x27;s ability to voice characters in &quot;a very unique rhythm&quot; and called the process of replicating that energy in the form of comics as &quot;a blast&quot; and &quot;super easy&quot; in comparison with the show&#x27;s other characters.

When discussing the season&#x27;s development, Shand said pairing Kyra and Prue Halliwell for a storyline was a &quot;natural fit&quot; since both characters were his favorites from the show. In interviews with the fansite CharmedComicFan, he explained Kyra was a central part of the season. Shand identified her as part of the &quot;straight up plot&quot; and &quot;inextricable&quot; from Prue&#x27;s storylines in response to fans&#x27; concerns that she would be limited to a subplot. Although Prue never interacted with Kyra on the show, Shand said Prue had sifted through &quot;all of the seers in all of the history to see who best tell her what&#x27;s the deal&quot; and chose Kyra.

== Critical reception ==
Critical response to Kyra was largely positive. The &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligence&quot;″s Melanie McFarland praised Kyra as a &quot;tasty demon seer&quot;. In a &quot;Charmed Magazine&quot; article, Tara Dilullo considered Carpenter to be the perfect person to play Kyra since she had &quot;spent the better part of her career facing down the supernatural with a snark and a smile&quot; as Cordelia Chase. Television Without Pity&#x27;s Demain, however, had a more mixed response to Kyra. Although he enjoyed that &quot;Charmed&quot; hired an actor from a Joss Whedon show, he felt Carpenter was not given enough material and criticized her for playing the character too similar to Cordelia. Parodying Kyra&#x27;s lack of a concrete identity, Demain referenced Kyra as &quot;Charisma&quot;, &quot;Cordelia&quot;, and &quot;Cordelia Lite&quot; in his episode recaps.

Kyra was also praised in retrospective reviews. SpoilerTV&#x27;s Gavin Hetherington said Kyra was one of the season&#x27;s high points, and felt the character could have been used more. &quot;Screen Rant&quot;″s Amanda Bruce described her as &quot;a fun addition to the show&quot; and praised Carpenter&#x27;s performance. Describing Kyra as the more memorable version of the two Seers, Hypable&#x27;s Karen Rought praised the show for casting Carpenter; she wrote &quot;how fitting is it that [Carpenter] landed this role after Cordelia Chase also had precognitive abilities&quot;. Movie Pilot&#x27;s John Collins cited Carpenter as one of his favorite guest stars on &quot;Charmed&quot;.

In 2015, Pat Shand criticized the decision to kill Kyra and introduce the novice witch Billie Jenkins (Kaley Cuoco) in season eight. He described Kyra as a better alternative to Billie as a potential &quot;fourth main character&quot; or &quot;non-Charmed One getting all that screen time&quot; during the final season. In a Tumblr interview Shand wished that Kyra had received a spin-off with Cole Turner and Darryl Morris.

<doc id="797486" wikidata="Q3270046" url="?curid=797486" title="Climatic Research Unit">
<text>The Climatic Research Unit (CRU) is a component of the University of East Anglia and is one of the leading institutions concerned with the study of natural and anthropogenic climate change.

With a staff of some thirty research scientists and students, the CRU has contributed to the development of a number of the data sets widely used in climate research, including one of the global temperature records used to monitor the state of the climate system, as well as statistical software packages and climate models.

==History==
The CRU was founded in 1972 as part of the university&#x27;s School of Environmental sciences. The establishment of the Unit owed much to the support of Sir Graham Sutton, a former Director-General of the Meteorological Office, Lord Solly Zuckerman, an adviser to the University, and Professors Keith Clayton and Brian Funnel, Deans of the School of Environmental Sciences in 1971 and 1972. Initial sponsors included British Petroleum, the Nuffield Foundation and Royal Dutch Shell. The Rockefeller Foundation was another early benefactor, and the Wolfson Foundation gave the Unit its current building in 1986. Since the second half of the 1970s the Unit has also received funding through a series of contracts with the United States Department of Energy to support the work of those involved in climate reconstruction and analysis of the effects on climate of greenhouse gas emissions. The UK Government (Margaret Thatcher) became a strong supporter of climate research in the mid-1980s.

The first director of the unit was Professor Hubert Lamb, who had previously led research into climatic variation at the Met Office. He was then known as the &quot;ice man&quot; for his prediction of global cooling and a coming ice age but, following the UK&#x27;s exceptionally hot summer of 1976, he switched to predicting a more imminent global warming. The possibility of major weather changes and flooding attracted attention to the unit and sponsorship by major insurance companies wanting to mitigate their potential losses. Prior to the Unit&#x27;s establishment, it had widely been believed by the meteorological establishment that the climate was essentially constant and unvarying. Lamb and others in the climatological community had for years argued that the climate system was in fact highly variable on timescales of decades to centuries and longer. The establishment of the CRU enabled Lamb and his colleagues to focus on this issue and eventually to win the argument decisively.

Hubert Lamb retired in 1978. His successors were Tom Wigley (1978–1993), Trevor Davies (1993–1998), Jean Palutikof and Phil Jones (jointly 1998–2004), Phil Jones (2004–2016), and Tim Osborn (from January 2017); Peter Liss was acting director during investigations between December 2009 and July 2010. In 1984, the unit moved to a new cylindrical building designed by Rick Mather. In 2006, this was named the &quot;Hubert Lamb Building&quot; in honour of the first director.

==Activities==

At the time of its establishment the CRU set out four key aims, which still remain valid:

* To establish firmer knowledge of the history of climate in the recent and distant past.
* To monitor and report on current climatic developments on a global scale.
* To identify the processes (natural and man-made) at work in climatic fluctuations and the characteristic timescales of their evolution.
* To investigate the possibilities of making advisory statements about future trends of weather and climate from a season to many years ahead, based on acceptable scientific methods and in a form likely to be useful for long-term planning purposes.

CRU produces a range of climate datasets, covering temperature, precipitation, pressure and circulation, both global and regional. One of the CRU&#x27;s most significant products is the CRUTEM global dataset of land near-surface temperature anomalies on a 5° by 5° grid-box basis, which is compiled in conjunction with the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research and its sea-surface temperature dataset to produce the HadCRUT temperature record. First compiled in the early 1980s, the record documents global temperature fluctuations since the 1850s. The CRU compiles the land component of the record and the Hadley Centre provides the marine component. The merged record is used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in all its publications. 

Other products include the CRU TS high resolution gridded land surface dataset of multiple factors including precipitation, vapour pressure and cloud cover as well as temperatures. This type of dataset can be used to monitor drought conditions, for example.

CRU is also involved in a study of Eurasian climate over the last 10,000 years based upon tree ring data and a study of European climate in the last 200 years based upon temperature records. It is a participant in MEDALUS – the Mediterranean Desertification and Land Use project. The custodians of the raw data are the National Meteorological Organisations that originated the data; CRU retains most but not all of the raw data, which continues to be held by the originating services.

It published a quarterly journal, &quot;Climate Monitor&quot;. This ceased publication in 1998, being replaced by an online version, &quot;Climate Monitor Online&quot;.

===Release of raw meteorological data === 

The CRU collates data from many sources around the world. In August 2009 its director, Phil Jones, told the science journal &quot;Nature&quot; that he was working to make the data publicly available with the agreement of its owners but this was expected to take some months, and objections were anticipated from National Meteorological Organisations that made money from selling the data. It was not free to share that data without the permission of its owners because of confidentiality agreements, including with institutions in Spain, Germany, Bahrain and Norway, that restricted the data to academic use. In some cases, the agreements were made orally, and some of the written agreements had been lost during a move. Despite this, the CRU was the focus of numerous requests under the Freedom of Information Act for data used by the unit&#x27;s scientists. &quot;Nature&quot; reported that in the course of five days in July 2009 the CRU had been &quot;inundated&quot; with 58 FOI requests from Stephen McIntyre and people affiliated with his Climate Audit blog requesting access to raw climate data or information about their use.

In early 2011 a large amount of raw weather station data had been released by the Met Office and the US Global Historical Climatology Network, but around two-thirds of the data owners did not respond to the CRU requests for agreement, and both Poland and Trinidad and Tobago declined. Two FOIA requests for data shared with another researcher were refused by the university, and the requestors appealed this to the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office (ICO). In its decision released on 23 June 2011, the ICO required CRU to release the remaining raw data irrespective of the wishes of the meteorological organisations which owned the data. This decision included data from Trinidad and Tobago but did not cover Poland. The raw data release was completed by 27 July 2011.

== CRU email controversy ==

In November 2009, hackers gained access to a server used by the CRU and stole a large quantity of data, anonymously posting online more than 1,000 emails and more than 2,000 other documents. Some climate change deniers including bloggers falsely asserted that a number of the leaked e-mails contain evidence supporting their global warming conspiracy theory that scientists had allegedly conspired to manipulate data and to keep scientists who have contrary views out of peer-review literature. This controversy was dubbed &quot;Climategate&quot;.

A series of independent public investigations of the allegations found no evidence of fraud or scientific misconduct. The Muir Russell report exonerated the scientists, but found &quot;a consistent pattern of failing to display the proper degree of openness, both on the part of CRU scientists and on the part of the UEA&quot;. The scientific consensus that global warming is occurring as a result of human activity remained unchanged.

In 2011, a new analysis of temperature data by the independent Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature group, many of whom had stated publicly that they thought it was possible that the CRU had manipulated data, concluded that &quot;these studies were done carefully and that potential biases identified by climate change sceptics did not seriously affect their conclusions&quot;.

<text>Pieris brassicae, the large white, also called cabbage butterfly, cabbage white, cabbage moth (erroneously), or in India the large cabbage white, is a butterfly in the family Pieridae. It is a close relative of the small white, &quot;Pieris rapae&quot;.

The large white is common throughout Europe, North Africa and Asia.

==Distribution==
The large white is common throughout Europe, north Africa, and Asia to the Himalayas often in agricultural areas, meadows and parkland. It has managed to establish a population in South Africa and in 1995 it was predicted to spread to Australia and New Zealand.

The large white is a strong flier and the British population has been reinforced in most years by migrations from the continent. Scattered reports of the large white from the north-eastern United States (New York, Rhode Island and Maine) over the past century are of a dubious nature and indicate either accidental transport or intentional release. Such introductions threaten to establish this agricultural pest in North America.

In 2010 the butterfly was found in Nelson, New Zealand where it is known as the great white butterfly. It is classed as an unwanted pest due to the potential effect on crops. For a limited period in October 2013 the Department of Conservation offered a monetary reward for the capture of the butterfly. After two weeks, the public had captured 134 butterflies, netting $10 for each one handed in. As a result of this and other containment measures, such as over 263,000 searches in the upper South Island and the release of predatory wasps, the large white was officially declared to be eradicated from New Zealand as of December 2014.

===Eggs===
The large white ova are pale yellow, turning darker yellow within twenty-four hours of being oviposited. A few hours prior to hatching, they become black, the shell more transparent, and the larvae visible within.
===Larvae===
Large white larvae experience four moultings and five instars. The first instar follows the hatching of the egg into large white larvae. The larvae are light yellow with distinctive brown heads and have soft bodies. The larvae appear to be very hairy. Following a moulting, the larvae enter the second instar. They have tubercles covered with black hair. In the third instar, large white larvae display more activity. This instar is when the larvae are observed to eat voraciously, and cause significant amounts of damage to their host plant. At this point, they are observed to be more yellow in colour, studded with black dots. Following the third instar, the larvae go through the fourth instar, with similar appearances as the larvae of the third instar, but with more aggrandized size and feeding behaviour. The large white larvae are observed to be cylindrical, robust, and elongated by the fifth instar, yellow in colour and with bright colouration on their abdomen and thorax. They are also observed to have a grey and black head. This instar requires maximum food quality and quantity in order to aid in full development, otherwise the larva dies before becoming an adult butterfly.


===Imagines===
For both males and females, the wings are white with black tips on the forewings. The female also has two black spots on each forewing. The underside of each wing is a pale greenish and serves as excellent camouflage when at rest. The black markings are generally darker in the summer brood. The large white butterfly&#x27;s wingspan reaches 5 to 6.5 cm on average.

====Male====
The upperside of the male is creamy white. The forewing is irrorated (sprinkled) with black scales at the base and along the costa for a short distance. The apex and termen above vein 2 are more or less broadly black with the inner margin of the black area containing a regular even curve. In one or two specimens a small longitudinally narrow black spot was found in interspace 3. Hindwing: uniform, irrorated with black scales at base, a large black subcostal spot before the apex, and in a few specimens indications of black scaling on the termen anteriorly. The underside of the forewing is white, slightly irrorated with black scales at the base of cell and along costa. The apex is light ochraceous brown with a large black spot in outer half of interspace 1 and another quadrate black spot at base of interspace 3. The hindwing is light ochraceous brown, closely irrorated with minute black scales. The subcostal black spot before the apex shows through from the upperside. The antennae are black and white at apex. The head, thorax, and abdomen are black, with some white hairs, where underneath is whitish.

====Female====
The upperside of the female is similar to that of the male, but the irroration of black scales at the bases of the wings is more extended. The black area on apex and termen of forewing is broader, its inner margin less evenly curved. A conspicuous large, black spot also exists in the outer half of interspace 1 near the base of interspace 3. On the hindwing the subcostal black spot before the apex is much larger and more prominent. The underside is similar to that of the male but the apex of the forewing and the whole surface of the hindwing is a light ochraceous yellow, not ochraceous brown. The black discal spots on forewing are much larger. The antennae, head, thorax, and abdomen of the females are the same as for the male.
==Habitat==
The large white butterfly&#x27;s habitat consists of large, open spaces, as well as farms and vegetable gardens, because of the availability of its food source. Some favoured locations include walls, fences, tree trunks, and often their food plant. They primarily hover around these locations, which should contain both wild and cultivated crucifer, as well as oil-seed rape, cabbages, and Brussels sprouts.

==Reproduction and development==
===Mating system===
These butterflies can be polyandrous, but it is not the predominant mating system. This means that, though some female butterflies can have more than one mate, most of the large white females only have one male mate at a time through a monogamous mating system.

Two generations of butterflies are produced each year. The first brood consists of adults with a spring hatching around April. The second brood is made up of adults that hatch around July. Sometimes, a third brood can be observed farther along in the summer if the weather is warm enough.

===Life cycle===
====Oviposition====
These female butterflies oviposit in clusters on the undersides of leaves because the larvae prefer the morphology of leaf undersides over the upper surface of leaves. To oviposit, the female butterflies use the tip of the abdomen and arrange the ova in specific batches.

The pre-oviposition period, which lasts three to eight days, provides ample time for these butterflies to mate. Females tend to use their forelegs to drum on the surfaces of their intended leaves as a test of the plant&#x27;s suitability for breeding. If they find a suitable surface, female large whites oviposit two to three days following copulation. They oviposit approximately six to seven times in eight days. The females can pair up to mate again approximately five or more days after the previous mating.

=====Choosing locations for oviposition=====
Females rely on visual cues, such as the colours of plants, to decide where to lay their eggs. They favour green surfaces in particular to display oviposition behaviour. This colour preference could be due to the fact that the large white&#x27;s food source also acts as a host plant for oviposition.

Most females choose nectar plants like buddleia or thistles, which are green and ideal plants for the larvae. These plants, used as oviposition sites, typically contain mustard oil glucosides, whose primary function is to help the larvae survive as their essential food source. For instance, previous studies have shown that the large white larvae do not survive if the adult butterflies oviposit on a different host plant such as broad bean (&quot;Vicia faba&quot;) because this bean does not contain the proper nutrients to aid larval development.

====Hatching====
The large white eggs hatch approximately one week after being laid and live as a group for some time. The hatching period constitutes around two to seven hours. Upon hatching, they cause a lot of damage to the host plant by eating away at and destroying the host plant. As expected during the colder moments of the day they may appear inactive - dormant.


==Behaviour==
===Migration===
The large whites are found throughout most of Eurasia, though there are some seasonal fluctuations present due to migration. The northern populations tend to be augmented during the summer migration season from butterflies from southern areas. The large whites fly starting early spring, and keep migrating until seasons shift to autumn and the resultant cold weather. This means the large whites typically take two to three flights per butterfly reproductive season.

Large white butterfly migration patterns are typically observed only when there is a disturbance. In general, the large white butterfly&#x27;s migratory patterns are atypical; normally, butterflies fly towards the poles in the spring, and towards the more temperate Equator during the fall. However, they fly in random directions, excluding north, in the spring, and there is little return migration observed. However, it has been hard to track entire migratory paths, since these butterflies can migrate more than 800 kilometres; thus, individual butterflies may not migrate the 800 kilometres, but rather that other butterflies start their migrations from where the other butterflies ended.

===Hibernation===
Large white broods in the north have not been seen to overwinter, nor hibernate over the winter, successfully. However, they have been observed to hibernate in the south.

===Territorial behaviour===
Males do not display considerable amounts of territorial behaviour. It has been suggested that this could be a reason why there is no observed significant sexual dimorphism between the male and female large white butterflies.

==Ecology==
===Diet and food selection===

Large white butterflies have a preference for what types of food plant they usually eat. Studies have shown that the preference for certain plants is reliant upon the butterflies&#x27; previous experiences. The large white butterflies, then, are shown to rely on the species of food plants, the time of experience, and the choice-situation. Thus, the large white butterflies learn what types of foods they prefer, rather than relying on their sense organs or physiological changes. In contrast, this preference for adult food plant differs from the preference of female large whites using visual cues such as plant colour to determine the best host plants for oviposition.

Plants with mustard-oil glucosides are important for this butterfly because it dictates their eating behaviours, and resultant survival rates, as specified in the section regarding oviposition. This is so beneficial for large whites because their large consumption of plants containing mustard oils is the specific reason they are so distasteful to predators, such as birds. Thus, caterpillars are protected from attack, despite them being brightly coloured; in fact, the bright colouration is to signal to predators that they taste bad.

However, there is more benefit to this species&#x27; use of mustard oil glucosides. In addition to predator protection, these glucosides belong to a class of stimuli that produce the biting responses associated with eating. Some plants contain alkaloids and steroids; these reduce and inhibit the butterflies&#x27; responsiveness to mustard oil glucosides. Thus, this utilization of mustard oil glucosides dramatically affects the behaviour of the butterfly, and the resulting food selection for survival.

The food source of the larva of the white butterfly are cabbages, radishes, and the undersides of leaves. Adults feed on flower nectar.

===Predators===
Large white butterflies do not have a specific group of predators. Instead, they are preyed upon by a wide range of animals, and even the occasional plant. This butterfly&#x27;s main predators include birds; however, large whites can also be preyed upon by species in orders such as Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, Coleoptera, Diptera, Arachnid; some species of mammals, one of reptiles, one species of insectivorous plant, and species in amphibian orders, as well as other miscellaneous insect species. The butterflies are typically preyed upon as eggs, larvae, and imagoes.

===Aposematism===
Large white butterflies emit an unpleasant smell which deters predators. In addition, large whites are an aposematic species, meaning that they display warning colours, which benefits the large whites against predation. This aposematic colouration occurs in the larval, pupal, and imago stages, where toxic mustard oil glycosides from food plants are stored in the individuals&#x27; bodies. Aposematism is not entirely related to Müllerian mimicry; however, large white larvae often benefit from multiple other aposematic larvae from other species, such as the larvae of &quot;Papilio machaon&quot;.

==Relationship to people==
===Role as pests===
The crops most susceptible to &quot;P. brassicae&quot; damage in areas in Europe are those in the genus &quot;Brassica&quot; (cabbage, mustard, and their allies), particularly Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, kohlrabi, rape, swede, and turnip. The attacks to crops are rather localized and can lead to 100% crop loss in a certain area. In addition, because of its strong inclination to migrate, adults may infest new areas that were previously free from attack. Because many of the host plants of &quot;P. brassicae&quot; are sold for consumption, damage by these butterflies can cause a great reduction of crop value. Larvae may also bore into the vegetable heads of cabbage and cauliflower and cause damage. High populations of these larvae may also skeletonise their host plants. In present-day areas such as Great Britain, &quot;P. brassicae&quot; are now less threatening as pests because of natural and chemical control reasons. However, it is still considered a pest in other European countries, in China, India, Nepal, and Russia. In fact, it is estimated to cause over 40% yield loss annually on different crop vegetables in India and Turkey.

<text>English family law concerns the law relating to family matters in England and Wales. Family law concerns a host of authorities, agencies and groups which participate in or influence the outcome of private disputes or social decisions involving family law. Such a view of family law may be regarded as assisting the understanding of the context in which the law works and to indicate the policy areas where improvements can be made.

The UK is made up of three jurisdictions: Scotland, Northern Ireland, and England and Wales. Each has quite different systems of family law and courts. This article concerns only England and Wales. Family law encompasses divorce, adoption, wardship, child abduction and parental responsibility. It can either be public law or private law. Family law cases are heard in the Family Justice System of England and Wales in both county courts and family proceedings courts (magistrates&#x27; court), both of which operate under codes of Family Procedure Rules. There is also a specialist division of the High Court of Justice, the Family Division which hears family law cases.

==Family relationships==

===Marriage and civil partnership===
UK law recognises both marriages and civil partnerships, both of which can be entered by couples of any gender. Traditionally, marriage was only available between a man and a woman, according to decisions in cases including &quot;Hyde v Hyde&quot; and &quot;Corbett v Corbett&quot;, as well as the wording of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, the legislation which primarily dealt with divorce.

The Civil Partnership Act 2004 introduced the ability for couples of the same sex to obtain legal recognition. The Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 allowed same sex couples to legally marry. The fact that same sex couples could get a marriage or a civil partnership, but opposite sex couples were precluded from civil partnerships led to a legal challenge in the UK Supreme Court—&quot;R (on the application of Steinfeld and Keidan) v Secretary of State for International Development.&quot; The inequality of treatment between opposite and same sex couples created by the introduction of civil partnerships as a stepping stone towards marriage equality was considered a breach of Articles 8 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and the court issued a declaration of incompatibility. Parliament then passed the Civil Partnerships, Marriages and Deaths (Registration etc) Act 2019 to extend civil partnerships to all.

===Divorce and dissolution===
The Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 was, until 2020, the legislation governing divorce (and dissolution of civil partnerships). It set out five &quot;facts&quot; which were necessary before a divorce (or dissolution) could be granted. These were adultery, behaviour which the petitioner could not reasonably be expected to live, desertion for over two years, separation for two years with consent, or separation for five years. An attempt to reform the divorce procedure was included as part of the Family Law Act 1996, but it did not take effect.

A legal challenge to the five facts was brought to the Supreme Court in &quot;Owens v Owens&quot; by a woman who was denied a contested divorce petition due to failure to prove one of the five facts. The court expressed considerable sympathy but found against her. Parliament reformed the procedure with the Divorce, Dissolution and Separation Act 2020.

The procedure for seeking a divorce takes the form of two parts: seeking a &quot;decree nisi&quot;, followed by a &quot;decree absolute&quot; six weeks later. The Divorce (Religious Marriages) Act 2002 allows the court to make the issuance of the &quot;decree absolute&quot; conditional on the receipt of an order of a religious authority—for example, a &quot;get&quot; issued by a Jewish &quot;beth din&quot;.

When the court has to decide on orders for the appropriate care for children following a divorce, it does so using the jurisdiction of the Children Act 1989.

Important or difficult decisions, however, are published on the internet both by the Court Service and by the British and Irish Legal Information Institute. The cases cited here provide examples.

* Miller v Miller (Short marriage, no children, rich husband)
* Piglowska v. Piglowski (Runaway costs)
* Clayton v Clayton 2006 (An appeal against injunctions preventing a father from publishing matters concerning his daughter. The appeal was allowed, the injunction quashed and a Prohibited Steps Order imposed.)

<doc id="797499" wikidata="Q1151299" url="?curid=797499" title="Ragdoll physics">
<text>Ragdoll physics is a type of procedural animation used by physics engines, which is often used as a replacement for traditional static death animations in video games and animated films. As computers increased in power, it became possible to do limited real-time physical simulations, which made death animations more realistic.

Early video games used manually created animations for a character’s death sequences. This had the advantage of low CPU utilization, as the data needed to animate a &quot;dying&quot; character was chosen from a set number of pre-drawn frames. In contrast, a ragdoll is a collection of multiple rigid bodies (each of which is ordinarily tied to a bone in the graphics engine&#x27;s skeletal animation system) tied together by a system of constraints that restrict how the bones may move relative to each other. When the character dies, their body begins to collapse to the ground, honouring these restrictions on each of the joints&#x27; motion, which often looks more realistic.

The term &quot;ragdoll&quot; comes from the problem that the articulated systems, due to the limits of the solvers used, tend to have little or zero joint/skeletal muscle stiffness, leading to a character collapsing much like a toy rag doll, often into comically improbable or compromising positions. Modern use of ragdoll physics goes beyond death sequences.

== History ==
The &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; licensed game &quot;Jurassic Park: Trespasser&quot; exhibited ragdoll physics in 1998 but received very polarised opinions; most were negative, as the game had a large number of bugs. It was remembered, however, for being a pioneer in video game physics.

There are fighting games where the player controls one part of the body of the fighter and the rest follows along, such as &quot;Rag Doll Kung Fu&quot;, as well as racing games such as the &quot;FlatOut&quot; series.

Recent procedural animation technologies, such as those found in NaturalMotion&#x27;s Euphoria software, have allowed the development of games that rely heavily on the suspension of disbelief facilitated by realistic whole-body muscle/nervous ragdoll physics as an integral part of the immersive gaming experience, as opposed to the antiquated use of canned-animation techniques. This is seen in &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot;, &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;, &quot;Red Dead Redemption&quot;, &quot;Max Payne 3&quot; and &quot;Red Dead Redemption 2&quot; as well as titles such as LucasArts&#x27; &quot;Star Wars: The Force Unleashed&quot; and &quot;Puppet Army Faction&#x27;s Kontrol&quot;, which feature 2D powered ragdoll locomotion on uneven or moving surfaces.

== Approaches ==
Ragdolls have been implemented using Featherstone&#x27;s algorithm and spring-damper contacts. An alternative approach uses constraint solvers and idealized contacts.
While the constrained-rigid-body approach to ragdolls is the most common, other &quot;pseudo-ragdoll&quot; techniques have been used:

*Verlet integration: used by &quot;&quot; and popularized by Thomas Jakobsen, this technique models each character bone as a point connected to an arbitrary number of other points via simple constraints. Verlet constraints are much simpler and faster to solve than most of those in a fully modelled rigid body system, resulting in much less CPU consumption for characters.
*Inverse kinematics post-processing: used in &quot;&quot;, this technique relies on playing a pre-set death animation and then using inverse kinematics to force the character into a possible position after the animation has completed. This means that, during an animation, a character could wind up clipping through world geometry, but after it has come to rest, all of its bones will be in valid space. Limitations can force body parts to move through each other in unnatural ways; for instance, a character&#x27;s hand may lay on top of their chest in a death animation, but the hand is then moved through the chest to the ground underneath by inverse kinematics.
*Blended ragdoll: this technique was used in &quot;Halo 2&quot;, &quot;Halo 3&quot;, &quot;Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare&quot;, &quot;Left 4 Dead&quot;, &quot;Medal of Honor: Airborne&quot;, &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;, and &quot;.&quot; It works by playing a pre-made animation, then binding the ragdoll to the last frame of the animation. Occasionally the ragdolling player model will appear to stretch out and spin around in multiple directions, as though the character were made of rubber. This erratic behavior has been observed to occur in games that use certain versions of the Havok engine, such as &quot;Halo 2&quot; and &quot;Fable II&quot;.
*Active ragdoll: used primarily in &quot;Unreal Engine&quot; games such as &quot;Unreal Tournament 3&quot; and &quot;Killing Floor 2&quot;. It works by playing a pre-made animation, but constraining the output of that animation to what a physical system would allow. This helps alleviate the ragdoll feeling of characters suddenly going limp, offering correct environmental interaction as well. This requires both animation processing and physics processing, thus making it even slower than a traditional ragdoll alone, though the benefits of the extra visuals seem to overshadow the reduction in processing speed. See also: &quot;Euphoria (software)&quot;
*Procedural animation: traditionally used in non-realtime media (film/TV/etc), this technique (used in the Medal of Honor series starting from European Assault onward) employs the use of multi-layered physical models in non-playing characters (bones / muscle / nervous systems), and deformable scenic elements from &quot;simulated materials&quot; in vehicles, etc. By removing the use of pre-made animation, each reaction seen by the player is unique, whilst still deterministic.

<text>Judy Tyler (born Judith Mae Hess; October 9, 1932 – July 3, 1957) was an American singer and actress.

==Early life and career==
Judy Tyler spent her teen years in Teaneck, New Jersey. She came from a show business family and was encouraged to study dance and acting. Tyler&#x27;s acting career began as a teenager, with regular appearances on &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; as Princess Summerfall Winterspring from 1950 to 1953.

Like her mother, Tyler became a chorus girl, and then landed a starring role in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical &quot;Pipe Dream&quot;. &quot;Life&quot; did a story on rising Broadway talent with Tyler on its cover as one of the up-and-coming stars. Tyler lived with her parents in Teaneck while appearing on &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; and Broadway.

Offered an opportunity in Hollywood, Tyler appeared in the film &quot;Bop Girl Goes Calypso&quot; (1957), then starred opposite Elvis Presley in &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; (1957). On December 28, 1957— nearly six months after her passing —Tyler was a cast member in a televised &quot;Perry Mason&quot; episode, &quot;The Case of the Fan Dancer&#x27;s Horse,” the “last film made by Judy Tyler before her death in an auto accident.”

==Death==
A few days after her &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; filming ended, Tyler and her second husband, Gregory Lafayette (born Earl Gregory Nisonger Jr.), began driving home to New York from Hollywood. While driving through Wyoming on July 3, 1957, they were involved in an automobile accident on U.S. Route 287 near Rock River. Tyler was killed instantly, aged 24, and Lafayette died the next day, aged 19. &quot;The Casper Morning Star&quot; reported the passenger killed in the oncoming car, driven by Paul Reed, was Don D. Jones, 23, of Hanna, Wyoming. Police said Lafayette&#x27;s car swerved to avoid hitting a slow-moving car-and-trailer entering the highway and collided head-on with the other vehicle in the crash. Reporter Ted Smith wrote in &quot;The Commercial Appeal&quot; that the car towing the trailer was returning to the highway after leaving a tourist shop.

<doc id="797520" wikidata="Q185710" url="?curid=797520" title="Jack McGurn">
<text>Jack &quot;Machine Gun Jack&quot; McGurn (born Vincenzo Antonio Gibaldi; ; July 2, 1902 – February 15, 1936) was a Sicilian-American boxer, mobster, and eventually a made man and caporegime in Al Capone&#x27;s Chicago Outfit.

==Early life==

McGurn was born in July 1902 in Licata, Sicily, the eldest son of Tommaso and Giuseppina (née Verderame) Gibaldi. Four years later, he and his mother emigrated to join his father in the United States of America, arriving at Ellis Island on November 24, 1906. McGurn grew up in Red Hook, Brooklyn where he went to Public School 46 on Union Street.

McGurn moved to Chicago when he was 14 where he later took up a career in boxing as a teenager and changed his name to &quot;Battling&quot; Jack McGurn because boxers with Irish names got the better bookings. They lived near Taylor street in Chicago&#x27;s Little Italy neighborhood. After Tommaso&#x27;s death while McGurn was still young, his mother remarried to grocer Angelo DeMory.

==Prohibition==
The Genna gang, which ruled Chicago&#x27;s Little Italy at the time, demanded money from the area&#x27;s inhabitants and businesses to help pay for the gang&#x27;s legal defense. McGurn&#x27;s stepdad, Angelo Demory, either refused or could not pay and was murdered by Genna gangsters in 1923. A few years later, in February 1926, McGurn avenged his death by hunting down and killing the three men responsible over the course of eight days. After this rampage, McGurn spent a short time with the North Side Gang before ending up in the Capone gang by April 1926.

McGurn quickly became one of the Capone gang&#x27;s most prolific, and successful, hitmen. He was with Capone on April 27, 1926, when they gunned down Westside O&#x27;Donnell gangsters James J. Doherty and Thomas &quot;Red&quot; Duffy. Assistant State&#x27;s Attorney William H. McSwiggin was also killed in this attack, who they were unaware was riding in the car with the gangsters. Slugs recovered from the crime scene were later matched to a Tommy Gun used by McGurn.

One of McGurn’s most high-profile hits was the assassination of North Side Gang leader Earl “Hymie” Weiss on October 11, 1926. McGurn is reputed to have used his trademark Tommy Gun as he gunned down the gang leader from an open window across the street from Holy Name Cathedral.

In the summer of 1927, Joe Aiello made an attempt to take over the Unione Siciliana. He put $25,000 bounties on Al Capone and Tony Lombardo, which attracted assassins from out of town. Between May and September 1927, Jack McGurn killed at least four would-be hitmen that had come to Chicago to kill his boss. On March 7, 1928, McGurn was shot and wounded by the Gusenberg brothers at the Hotel McCormick, at Ontario and Rush street, from where he had been leading a local takeover of the beer racket. On April 17, McGurn was shot at by North siders James Clark and Billy Davern, at the corner of Morgan and Harrison. McGurn retaliated by killing Billy Davern a few weeks later.

McGurn had part ownership of a speakeasy jazz club, a venue which still exists today, the infamous Green Mill, at 4802 North Broadway, in the middle of the rival &quot;Bugs&quot; Moran gang&#x27;s territory. In November 1927, manager Danny Cohen gave McGurn the task of &quot;persuading&quot; comedian/singer Joe E. Lewis not to move his act south to the New Rendezvous Café, at North Clark Street and West Diversey Parkway. Lewis refused, and McGurn slit Lewis&#x27;s throat, cutting off a portion of his tongue and leaving him for dead. Miraculously, Lewis eventually recovered and resumed his career, but his voice never regained its lush sound.

==St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre==
Some have suggested McGurn was involved in planning the St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre, in 1929, though this has not been proven.

Although police charged McGurn in the case, he was never brought to trial largely due to his &quot;blonde alibi&quot; — girlfriend and later wife Louise Rolfe — who claimed they spent the whole day together.

==Later years==
In April 1930, when Frank J. Loesch, chairman of the Chicago Crime Commission compiled his &quot;Public Enemies&quot; list of the top 28 people he saw as corrupting Chicago, McGurn&#x27;s name was fourth on the list, which was published nationwide.

This notoriety caused him to be shunned by the Outfit. McGurn, who had great hand-eye coordination, subsequently attempted a career as a professional golfer. McGurn was a silent partner in Evergreen Golf Course, at 91st Street and Western Avenue, a known mob hangout where he could often be found playing, practicing, giving lessons, or drinking and playing cards in the clubhouse. Dan Lilly was known to have caddied for him once and claimed that he kept a machine gun in his golf bag at all times. FBI documents released in December 1999 revealed that singer Bing Crosby, who frequently played golf in Chicago, was one of McGurn&#x27;s golfing partners.

On August 25, 1933, the Western Open golf championship began at Olympia Fields Country Club in the far south suburb of Olympia Fields. A reasonably skilled golfer and flashy dresser, McGurn entered the competition as Vincent Gebhardi (another version of his real name), the professional at public Evergreen Golf Course. In the opening round, McGurn carded a 13-over-par 83 on course No. 4 (today&#x27;s North Course). The next morning, the name &quot;Gebhardi&quot; on the day&#x27;s pairing sheet was observed by an alert Chicago Police chief detective, who sent two sergeants to arrest him. &quot;Aware of McGurn&#x27;s truculent temper&quot;, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; account reported, &quot;the sergeants enlisted the help of Lt. Frank McGillen and five policemen from the Homewood station of the county highway force&quot;.

McGurn was playing much better the second day. The group of burly officers accosted McGurn on the seventh green and told him he was under arrest under a warrant issued the day before under the &quot;criminal reputation law&quot;. He was accompanied by his wife, the glitzy &quot;Blonde Alibi&quot; Louise Rolfe. Wearing a tight, thin white dress and sporting a three-carat diamond ring, she approached the policemen and snapped, &quot;Whose brilliant idea was this?&quot; McGurn politely asked to finish his round. Amused, the plainclothesmen agreed and became part of his gallery. But the police presence began to unnerve McGurn and his game suddenly went sour. He came in with a 16-over-par 86 for a 36-hole total of 169, 14 strokes above making the cut.

==Death==
Less than three years later, McGurn, by then impoverished and cast out of the Outfit, was assassinated by three men with pistols on February 15, 1936, one day after the seventh anniversary of the St. Valentine&#x27;s Day massacre. He was bowling at the second-floor Avenue Recreation Bowling Alley, at 805 N. Milwaukee Avenue in Chicago.

McGurn&#x27;s assassins tossed a Valentine card with a prophetic poem near to his body: 
:&quot;You&#x27;ve lost your job, you&#x27;ve lost your dough,
:Your jewels and cars and handsome houses, 
:But things could still be worse you know... 
:At least you haven&#x27;t lost your trousers!&quot;.

He was laid to rest at Mount Carmel Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois.

After McGurn&#x27;s murder, his half-brother, Anthony De Mory, angrily said, &quot;I know the guys who killed Jack. I&#x27;m going to get them&quot;. On March 2, 1936, however, De Mory was fatally shot by three masked men inside a Chicago pool hall. The Chicago Police Department linked the assassination to McGurn&#x27;s slaying.

The identity of McGurn&#x27;s killers remains unknown, but research and speculation by criminologists suggest three possible theories: 
# Revenge by former Irish mob boss George &quot;Bugs&quot; Moran, who McGurn had tried to kill almost seven years before.
# A contract killing ordered by the Chicago Outfit under Frank Nitti, because McGurn (an alcoholic and a braggart), had become a liability due to his extensive inside knowledge of the American Mafia. 
# Revenge by James Gusenberg, the brother of Frank and Peter Gusenberg, who were both murdered during the St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre.

<doc id="797527" wikidata="Q4143008" url="?curid=797527" title="Homomorphic filtering">
<text>Homomorphic filtering is a generalized technique for signal and image processing, involving a nonlinear mapping to a different domain in which linear filter techniques are applied, followed by mapping back to the original domain. This concept was developed in the 1960s by Thomas Stockham, Alan V. Oppenheim, and Ronald W. Schafer at MIT and independently by Bogert, Healy, and Tukey in their study of time series.

==Image enhancement==
Homomorphic filtering is sometimes used for image enhancement. It simultaneously normalizes the brightness across an image and increases contrast. Here homomorphic filtering is used to remove multiplicative noise. Illumination and reflectance are not separable, but their approximate locations in the frequency domain may be located. Since illumination and reflectance combine multiplicatively, the components are made additive by taking the logarithm of the image intensity, so that these multiplicative components of the image can be separated linearly in the frequency domain. Illumination variations can be thought of as a multiplicative noise, and can be reduced by filtering in the log domain.

To make the illumination of an image more even, the high-frequency components are increased and low-frequency components are decreased, because the high-frequency components are assumed to represent mostly the reflectance in the scene (the amount of light reflected off the object in the scene), whereas the low-frequency components are assumed to represent mostly the illumination in the scene. That is, high-pass filtering is used to suppress low frequencies and amplify high frequencies, in the log-intensity domain.

===Operation===
Homomorphic filtering can be used for improving the appearance of a grayscale image by simultaneous intensity range compression (illumination) and contrast enhancement (reflection).

formula_1

Where,

m = image,

i = illumination,

r = reflectance

We have to transform the equation into frequency domain in order to apply high pass filter. However, it&#x27;s very difficult to do calculation after applying Fourier transformation to this equation because it&#x27;s not a product equation anymore. Therefore, we use &#x27;log&#x27; to help solve this problem.

formula_2

Then, applying Fourier transformation

formula_3

Or formula_4

Next, applying high-pass filter to the image. To make the illumination of an image more even, the high-frequency components are increased and low-frequency components are decrease.

formula_5

Where

H = any high-pass filter

N = filtered image in frequency domain

Afterward, returning frequency domain back to the spatial domain by using inverse Fourier transform.

formula_6

Finally, using the exponential function to eliminate the log we used at the beginning to get the enhanced image

formula_7

The following figures show the results of applying the homomorphic filter, high-pass filter, and the both homomorphic and high-pass filter. All figures were produced using Matlab.

According to figures one to four, we can see how homomorphic filtering is used for correcting non-uniform illumination in the image, and the image become clearer than the original. On the other hand, if we apply the high pass filter to the homomorphic filtered image, the edges of the images become sharper and the other areas become dimmer. This result is similar to applying only a high-pass filter to the original image.

==Anti-homomorphic filtering==
It has been suggested that many cameras already have an approximately logarithmic response function (or more generally, a response function which tends to compress dynamic range), and display media such as television displays, photographic print media, etc., have an approximately anti-logarithmic response, or an otherwise dynamic range expansive response. Thus homomorphic filtering happens accidentally (unintentionally) whenever we process pixel values f(q) on the true quantigraphic unit of light q. Therefore it has been proposed that another useful kind of filtering is anti-homomorphic filtering in which images f(q) are first dynamic-range expanded to recover the true light q, upon which linear filtering is performed, followed by dynamic range compression back into image space for display.


==Audio and speech analysis==
Homomorphic filtering is used in the log-spectral domain to separate filter effects from excitation effects, for example in the computation of the cepstrum as a sound representation; enhancements in the log spectral domain can improve sound intelligibility, for example in hearing aids.

==Surface electromyography signals (sEMG)==
Homomorphic filtering has been used to remove the effect of the stochastic impulse train, which originates the sEMG signal, from the power spectrum of the sEMG signal itself. In this way, only information about motor unit action potential (MUAP) shape and amplitude was maintained; this was then used to estimate the parameters of a time-domain model of the MUAP itself.

==Neural decoding==
How individual neurons or networks encode information is the subject of numerous studies and research. In central nervous system it mainly happens by altering the spike firing rate (frequency encoding) or relative spike timing (time encoding).
Time encoding consists of altering the random inter-spikes intervals (ISI) of the stochastic impulse train in output from a neuron. Homomorphic filtering was used in this latter case to obtain ISI variations from the power spectrum of the spike train in output from a neuron with or without the use of neuronal spontaneous activity. The ISI variations were caused by an input sinusoidal signal of unknown frequency and small amplitude, i.e. not sufficient, in absence of noise to excite the firing state. The frequency of the sinusoidal signal was recovered by using homomorphic filtering based procedures.

<text>Labin (Italian/Istriot: Albona) is a town in Istria, west Croatia, with a town population of 5,806 (2021) and 10,424 in the greater municipality (which also includes the small towns of Rabac-Porto Albona and Vinež-Vines, as well as a number of smaller villages).

==History==

Labin developed from the site of the Roman settlement of Albona. Its name predates classical antiquity and is derived from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*alb-&quot; (&quot;eminence&quot;, &quot;hill&quot;). Before and under the Roman occupation, Albona was an important commune. On a marble tablet the Roman inscription we read that under the Emperor Marco Iulio Severo Filippo noble Caesar noble Prince made Albona a Republic. To be a republic it had to have two joined Magistrates called Duumviri and Public officers called Aediles which took care of Public buildings and other official duties.

From 1295 it was under the rule of the dukes of Pazin, and from 1381 it found itself under the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Aquileia. From 1420 until 1797 it was ruled from the Republic of Venice and after that belonged to Austrian Empire until 1918, when it was annexed to the Kingdom of Italy. Labin, as a Croatian-speaking town, was for a long time the centre of Croatia&#x27;s largest coal mining district, with four mines operating at the height of its production. In March and April 1921, the town was the scene of a miners&#x27; strike which quickly grew into an anti-fascist rebellion, considered to be the first of its kind, and the declaration of the short-lived Labin Republic. The mine in downtown Labin closed in 1989. The large, coal-fired power plant in nearby Plomin now has its coal imported from outside sources once the mines were closed. After the Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947, Labin, like the whole of Istria, was annexed to Yugoslavia. 

The famous Lutheran reformer Matthias Flacius Illyricus (3 March 1520 – 11 March 1575), was born in Labin and a small exhibition in what was once his house, commemorates this. Unfortunately, due to the counter-reformation, he was forced to live most of his life in exile in Germany where he became the undisputed leader of the conservative wing of the Lutheran movement after the death of Luther. His chief literary legacy was in the area of biblical exegesis.

== Population ==

Language

Labinjonska Cakavica, one of the most interesting and oldest Istrian dialects spoken in and around the town of Labin. It belongs to Northern Chakavian dialect of the Chakavian variety of Croatian. It differs from the usual Chakavian (with typical pronoun &quot;ča&quot;) because it lacks most palatals, with other parallel deviations called &quot;tsakavism&quot; (cakavizam).
In 2019, by the decision of the Ministry of Culture, Labinjonska Cakavica became a protected intangible cultural asset of the Republic of Croatia.

<text>Alfred Sinowatz (5 February 192911 August 2008) was an Austrian historian and politician of the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ), who served as Chancellor of Austria from 1983 to 1986. Prior to becoming Chancellor, he had served as Minister of Education from 1971 to 1983 and Vice-Chancellor from 1981 to 1983.

After a three-years term in office, Sinowatz resigned as Chancellor after Kurt Waldheim&#x27;s victory in the 1986 presidential election.

== Life and career ==
Born in Neufeld an der Leitha, Burgenland, Sinowatz&#x27; family belonged to the local Croatian minority. He attended the gymnasium in Wiener Neustadt and Baden, where he obtained his &quot;Matura&quot; degree. Educated as a historian at the University of Vienna, he received his doctorate in 1953. He embarked upon a career in the civil service of the Burgenland state government and joined the staff of the provincial archive in 1956.

Sinowatz became an elected member of the municipal assembly (&quot;Gemeinderat&quot;) of his hometown Neufeld in 1957 and served as a regional SPÖ party secretary from 1961. Also in 1961 he became MP of the Burgenland state diet (&quot;Landtag&quot;), from 1964 to 1966 as speaker of the parliament. In 1966 he joined the provincial government as Minister of Education.

Upon the 1971 legislative election, Sinowatz became a member of the Austrian National Council parliament. On 4 November 1971, he took office as Minister of Education and Arts in the second cabinet of Chancellor Bruno Kreisky. During the ensuing twelve years of his office, Sinowatz substantially reformed the system of education in Austria to allow and increase social mobility. In 1982 he promoted the recognition of Buddhism in Austria as an official religious community.

In 1981, after Bruno Kreisky&#x27;s aspiring &quot;crown prince&quot;, Finance Minister Hannes Androsch was removed from his position, Sinowatz also became Vice-Chancellor.

== Chancellorship ==
The SPÖ had held an absolute majority in the National Council since 1970. However, at the 1983 election, they won 90 seats, two short of a majority. Kreisky resigned as chancellor, and Sinowatz reluctantly succeeded him. He helmed a coalition, still initiated by Kreisky, with the Freedom Party (FPÖ) which was then run by liberals under Vice-Chancellor Norbert Steger. In autumn 1983, Sinowatz also succeeded Kreisky as chairman of the SPÖ.

In late 1984, his red-blue coalition had to face the severe internal crisis of the Occupation of the Hainburger Au by thousands of people protesting against the building of a power station in the Danube floodplain, with violent clashes between police and demonstrators. Sinowatz managed to calm both sides by calling a halt to the woodland clearing and announcing a &quot;Christmas Peace&quot; on 22 December 1984, following considerable pressure from the public.

In spite of this, his period of office generally is not considered to have been successful. It was overshadowed by the 1985 diethylene glycol wine scandal, a construction scandal and bribery affair concerning the new Vienna General Hospital, and, in particular, the crisis of increasing debts of the nationalized industry, above all the VÖEST-Alpine steel conglomerate based in Linz. Close to the end of his period in office, Sinowatz also came under pressure after Defense Minister Friedhelm Frischenschlager of his coalition partner, the Freedom Party, officially received the former &quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; Walter Reder, a convicted war criminal who had been imprisoned in Italy since World War II, upon his return to Austria.

Since Sinowatz&#x27; contemplative manner was not very typical of that of politicians, he often earned pitiful smiles, for example, for his 1983 government declaration quote &quot;Ich weiß schon, (...) das ist alles sehr kompliziert so wie diese Welt, in der wir leben und handeln...&quot; (&quot;I know well, (...) that is all very complicated just like this world in which we live and act...&quot;), usually rendered as &quot;Es ist alles sehr kompliziert&quot; (&quot;Everything is very complicated&quot;).

== Waldheim Affair ==
During a meeting of the steering committee of the Burgenland SPÖ before the 1986 presidential election, according to a later rendering by board member Ottilie Matysek, Chancellor Sinowatz insinuated that one would have to point out to the Austrians that the candidate of the conservative Austrian People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP), the former UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim, had a &quot;brown&quot; (i.e. Nazi) past. By an indiscretion, this remark was passed on to the weekly magazine &quot;profil&quot;, which started to investigate the matter and triggered the Waldheim debate.

During the presidential campaign, Sinowatz strongly opposed Waldheim. When Waldheim gave assurances that he had not been a member of the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) Equestrian Corps, but had only joined its members in riding occasionally, Sinowatz countered: &quot;So we note that Kurt Waldheim never was a member of the SA, but only his horse.&quot;

After Waldheim&#x27;s election in the second round, Sinowatz resigned and passed on his post as chancellor to Finance Minister Franz Vranitzky, who also succeeded him as SPÖ chairman in 1988. At the same time, Sinowatz also resigned as an MP of the Austrian National Council.

== Later years ==
Sinowatz sued the &quot;profil&quot; journalist Alfred Worm for libel because of reports concerning Sinowatz&#x27; internal announcements to reveal Waldheim&#x27;s past. Even though all top representatives of the Burgenland SPÖ, including &quot;Landeshauptmann&quot; governor Johann Sipötz, gave testimony in his favor when he denied the accuracy of Ottilie Matysek&#x27;s (who had by then left the SPÖ) depiction of the events, the court gave more weight to the authenticity of her hand-written notes and dismissed the suit. This also led to Sipötz&#x27;s resignation and Sinowatz&#x27; conviction for giving false evidence in 1991.

Sinowatz retired to private life in his Burgenland home. Another indictment in the VÖEST Noricum scandal trial ended with his acquittal in 1993. In July 2008 he had to be taken to the Vienna General Hospital to undergo cardiac surgery. He died two weeks later at the age of 79. At the time of his death, he was the oldest living former Austrian chancellor.

<text>Mountainboarding (MTB), also known as dirtboarding, off-road boarding, and All-Terrain Boarding (ATB), is a well-established, but little-known action sport derived from snowboarding. The sport was initially pioneered by James Stanley during a visit to the Matterhorn in the 1990s, where snow was not available. A mountainboard is made up of components including a deck, bindings (to secure the rider to the deck), four wheels with pneumatic tires, and two steering mechanisms known as trucks. Mountainboarders, also known as riders, ride specifically designed boardercross tracks, slopestyle parks, grass hills, woodlands, gravel tracks, streets, skateparks, ski resorts, BMX courses, and mountain bike trails. It is this ability to ride such a variety of terrain that makes mountainboarding unique from other board sports.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Morton Hellig&#x27;s &#x27;Supercruiser Inc.&#x27; was the first company to manufacture and retail the &#x27;All Terrain Dirtboard&#x27;, patented in 1989.
Mountainboarding (name coined by Jason Lee) began in the UK, the United States and Australia in 1992. Unknown to each other, riders from other Boardsports started to design, build, and eventually manufacture boards that could be ridden off-road. This desire to expand the possible terrain that a boarder can ride created the sport of Mountainboarding.

==== United Kingdom ====
Dave and Pete Tatham, Joe Inglis and Jim Aveline, whilst looking for an off-season alternative to surfing and snowboarding, began designing boards that could be ridden down hills. Inglis developed initial prototypes, and in 1992 noSno was started. Extensive research and development produced the noSno truck system which enabled the boards to be steered and remain stable at high speeds. NoSno boards utilized snowboard bindings and boots, with large tyres for rough ground, and the option for a hand-operated hydraulic disc brake.

==== United States ====
In 1992, after having snowboarded at Heavenly Valley Resort in Northern California, friends Jason Lee, Patrick McConnell and Joel Lee went looking for an alternative for the summer season. Not finding anything suitable they co-founded Mountain Board Sports (MBS) in 1993 to build boards that they could use to carve down hills. The original MBS boards, known as &#x27;Frame Boards&#x27; had a small wooden deck, metal posts to hold the rider&#x27;s feet, a tubular metal frame connecting trucks which used springs to enable steering, thus create the carving sensation that the MBS co-founders sought.
The first recorded mountainboarding act occurred in the summer of 1978. On a bet, skateboarder Mike Motta, residing in Medford, Massachusetts, navigated down a hill known as Seven Bumps in Malden, Massachusetts using a standard Franklin skateboard.

==== Australia ====
John Milne developed a three-wheeled version of a mountainboard in 1992 in his spare time during periods of very poor surf. It used a unique steering system to emulate surfing on land. It had three wheels and a skate-style deck with no bindings.

=== Mid-to-late nineties ===
From the early days of invention there has always been a competitive element in mountainboarding. Encompassing racing, freestyle and downhill, competitions have been organized in the USA since 1993 and in the UK since 1997. In the same year, the ATBA-UK (All Terrain Boarding Association), the national governing body for mountainboarding in the UK, was born. As a non-profit making organization it represented and promoted the sport by putting riders interests first, promoting safety, sanctioning events, providing training, and sourcing funding to put on the ATBA-UK National Series, an annual series of competitions. The competitions did much to promote the sport and in 1998 mountainboarding had an estimated participation of over 1 million athletes worldwide. The components evolved, and the sport continued to grow. MBS developed the open heel binding, the channel truck called the &quot;eggshock&quot;, and the reverse V-Brake system and sold boards worldwide. In 1998 Maxtrack started distributing MBS mountainboards in the UK and Europe.

====Future====
Some powered mountain boards are gaining traction in the board enthusiast world. Small gas or electric motors are being attached to allow for mountainboarding to be done on flat ground or to climb hills rather than just downhill. Many DIY electric mountainboard builders are developing new drivetrains for their boards with electric motors, rivaling the power of small motorcycles, which could become the norm.

== Equipment ==

=== Board components ===
==== Deck ====
Mountainboard decks are the part that most of the components are attached to, and provide the base for the rider to stand on. They are generally from 90–110 centimeters in length, and can be made from a range of construction methods and materials. For example, high specification boards may be made from composite carbon and glass-reinforced plastic, possibly with a wooden core, similar to a snowboard deck. Basic decks are generally made using laminated wood pressed into shape, comparable to a longboard deck with larger dimensions and a different shape. There are variable characteristics such as flex, weight, shape, length and tip angle that can be custom-made, or stock boards from a variety of manufacturers.

==== Trucks ====
Trucks are the components made up of a hanger, damping and/or spring system, and axles which attach the wheels to the deck. They also have the mechanisms required to allow the board to turn.

===== Skate trucks =====

Skate trucks have a rigid axle and a top hanger, with a single bolt and bushings, also called rubbers or grommets, that provide the cushion mechanism for turning the mountainboard. The bushings cushion the truck when it turns. The stiffer the bushings, the more resistant the mountainboard is to turning. The softer the bushings, the easier it is to turn. A bolt called a kingpin holds these parts together and fits inside the bushings. Thus by tightening or loosening the kingpin nut, the trucks can be adjusted loosely for better turning and tighter for more control. Skate-style mountainboard trucks are similar to skateboard trucks but more robust and with a longer axle.

===== Channel trucks =====

Channel trucks are common on mountainboards, and are made up of an axles mounted to the truck bottom piece, which is suspended from a top hanger by a kingpin. They are mounted to the deck using nuts and bolts through the hanger part, on an angle, (usually 35°). When the board is tilted laterally the axles turn together to angle the wheels in the direction of the turn. Two polyurethane dampers sometimes known as &quot;egg shocks&quot; are mounted between the hanger and the axle housing on each truck to provide resistance to the lean of the rider during turning. Springs are mounted in the same place with the dampers inside them.
The &#x27;shocks&#x27; present in channel trucks are there to dampen the turning system, and help reduce the oscillations of the trucks on the board commonly described as speed wobble. The springs are there to return the deck to center after a turn has been performed. Neither are there to provide suspension between the deck and axles. They have a kingpin that can&#x27;t move vertically which prevents this.

Also, the effectiveness of springs as employed in 2009 channel truck designs is open to debate.
In a &quot;Coil over Oil&quot; shock, the extension of the spring is dampened as well as contraction. In a channel truck design, this is not the case as the damper sits freely inside the spring—therefore only contraction is dampened, not extension. This means that when a spring ceases to be under load and extends, it can extend past the equilibrium point.

===== NoSno trucks =====
NoSno trucks use two &#x27;kingpin&#x27;-type bolts to create a floating , an axle with a plate into which the bolts go, an angled base plate that attaches to the deck, and polyurethane bushings to dampen the turn. The amount of turn available in the trucks can be adjusted by tightening the bolts or by using bushings of different hardness. A similar design was adopted by Howla Mountainboards for the limited time that they manufactured boards.

==== Bindings ====

Bindings involve adjustable straps that hold the rider on to the board while allowing room to move their feet.
*Snowboard bindings
*Ratchet-strap bindings
*Velcro Bindings
*Bar-Bindings
*Heelstraps

==== Wheels ====

Wheels are made up of plastic or metal hubs and pneumatic tires ranging in size of 8–13 inches. The 8&quot; wheel has evolved into the best choice for freestyle riding, and also an all purpose wheel for general riding. Larger wheels (generally 9&quot; and 10&quot;) are more useful to the downhill rider; granting the rider access to high-speed runs and more stability when traveling at speed. 13&quot; or larger is better for floatation on soft sand or control in mud.

==== Tyres ====
Various tires have been made available by different mountainboard manufacturers, giving riders a choice of tire specifications. For example, the thickness of the tire is variable and usually either 2- or 4-ply. 2-ply tires are lighter, but more susceptible to punctures than 4-ply tires. There is a variety of tread patterns available, ranging from street slicks to deep tread designed for maximum grip with split center beads to channel water away. Width and diameter are also variable.

==== Brakes ====
Brakes are generally reserved for big mountain riding where riders need an increased ability to control their speed over long runs. The brakes are usually attached to both front wheels of the mountainboard rather than the rear to give greater braking efficiency and reduce the chances of the rear wheels locking up and skidding. They are operated via a hand-held lever which when pulled causes both brake mechanisms to work simultaneously. There are four types of brakes used on mountainboards:

;Mechanical drum brakes
:Those brakes use brake drums attached to the wheel with the 5 wheel-screws (Scrub). They are cheap and brake rigidly but get extremely hot and tend to melt the plastic hub. Good emergency brakes only, not any good for long steep hills. There is currently no heat resistant hub where they would attach to.

;Hydraulic Disc Brakes
:Hydraulic Disc Brakes use rotors attached to the hubs with hydraulically operated brake mechanisms that force ceramic pads against the rotors to effect braking. Advantages include high braking power and reliability. Disadvantages include cost, vulnerability of the discs, heat build up, and weight.

;Hydraulic Rim Brakes
:Hydraulic Rim Brakes use the hub, or preferably, a bolt on metal disc as the braking surface for hydraulically operated brake mechanisms that push polyurethane blocks against the braking surface. Advantages include good braking power, and good modulation. Disadvantages include possible damage to bearings.

;Cable-pull &#x27;V&#x27; Brakes
:Cable-pull &#x27;V&#x27; Brakes also use the hub or metal discs as a braking surface. The hand operated lever pulls a metal cable to push polyurethane blocks against the braking surface. Advantages include low cost, low weight, and easy installation and maintenance. Disadvantages include low braking power, and the need to be regularly adjusted.

=== Protections ===
Mountainboarders wear a range of protective equipment while riding.

*Helmets - are designed to protect the wearer&#x27;s head from falls and damage to the brain. There are two types of helmets: full-face and open face. Full-face provides more protection to the wearer and open face provides greater visibility for the wearer.
*Wrist Guards - are designed to protect the wearers&#x27; wrists from impacts. They come in two types: gloves and wrap-arounds. But both include plastic splints which prevent the wearers wrists from bending backwards during a fall and protect the palms against cuts and grazes.
*Elbow Pads - are designed to protect the wearers&#x27; elbows from impact during falls. Sometimes forearm guards are incorporated into the elbow pads.
*Knee Pads - are designed to protect the wearers&#x27; knees from impact during falls.
*Padded Shorts - are designed to protect the wearers&#x27; hips, coccyx, and buttocks from impact during falls.
*Body Armor - is designed to protect the wearer&#x27;s upper body, arms, shoulders and back from impact during falls.

== Media ==

The following are some of the numerous publications Mountain Boarding has had in various news media outlets and other media, including for the annual Mountain Board US Open in Snowmass and the Twighlight Showdown Mountainboard Championships.

=== Historical Magazines ===
*Off-Road Boarding Magazine founded in &#x27;99 with its editor Brian Bishop and other dedicated riders. It ran numerous pictorials, US riding spots, rider profiles and carried virtually no ads. It started small, and was given away at comps and shops. The last issue of the mag was printed in full color and a new name &quot;Mountainboard Magazine&quot;. The new title was later adopted by a UK publisher.
*All Terrain Boarding Magazine aka ATBMag: The longest running, 4 years, and only Mountainboard magazine to make it onto mainstream newsagent shelves. Distributed worldwide it ran to 39 copies and one photo album featuring the work of Paul Taylor. ATBMag was also responsible for the creation of the World Freestyle Championships, running it for the first 2 years. It also created the World Series, taking place in 12 countries. ATBmag sponsored a team of riders, who were later sponsored by EXIT. The team featured Tom Kirkman, Laurie Kaye, Alex Downie, Oli Morrison, Arno Van Den Vejver, Ig Wilkinson, Jack Chew and Tuai Lovejoy. 2005 saw the team take to Europe and ride in 7 countries following the World Series Tour. In 2006 the magazine made its final issue.
*Scuz Mountainboarding Zine was first published in July 2004 as a paid-for magazine, however subsequent issues were published and distributed for free both as a printed hardcopy version and on the internet as a downloadable PDF. It was announced in October 2006 that issue twelve would be the final issue.
*Mountainboard Magazine was produced by the same people who created scuz, and it was re-branded to suit changing trends in mountainboarding, and a cover charge was introduced to help pay for the costs involved in producing the magazine as the advertising featured was sufficient. Only one issue was ever printed.
*Mountainboarding Video Magazine (MVM) The only video mag to showcase mountain boarding from around the world. This publication only made nine issues, co-produced and edited by Justin Rhodes, Van DeWitt, and Brett Dooley.
*UKATB ran for 6 years between 2000 and 2006 and was the first website to feature in-depth advice and tips from board maintenance to ramp building and trick tips. At its peak the site attracted over 10 000 unique visitors a month.

<text>Lance Graf von Haugwitz-Hardenberg-Reventlow, (February 24, 1936 – July 24, 1972) was a British-born American entrepreneur, racing driver and heir to the Woolworth fortune. Reventlow was the only child of heiress Barbara Hutton and her second husband, Count Kurt Haugwitz-Hardenberg-Reventlow. His stepfathers included actor Cary Grant and Prince Igor Troubetzkoy.

== Early years ==

Lance Haugwitz-Hardenberg-Reventlow was the only child of Danish nobleman Count Kurt Haugwitz-Hardenberg-Reventlow and American socialite Barbara Hutton. Hutton had inherited the Woolworth department store fortune and was then one of the wealthiest women in the world. Reventlow was born at Winfield House in London, restored by his mother and named for her grandfather Frank Winfield Woolworth. Reventlow&#x27;s birth was difficult and his mother almost died during his delivery. As a child, he struggled with respiratory problems and was asthmatic.

Reventlow&#x27;s parents&#x27; marriage, Hutton&#x27;s second of seven, was tumultuous and did not last; after the couple divorced in 1938, Reventlow became the subject of a bitter custody battle. In 1944, Reventlow&#x27;s father was awarded custody until he reached school age, after which his mother would gain custody. Before his father was to relinquish custody, he sent Reventlow to Canada. Hutton regained custody of Reventlow in 1945. Reventlow was largely estranged from his father until the Count&#x27;s death in 1969.

== Racing career ==
In 1948, at age 12, Reventlow was introduced to the world of Grand Prix motor racing when his mother married Prince Igor Troubetzkoy, who won the Targa Florio that year. In his teenage years, Reventlow&#x27;s money afforded him the latest in exotic cars, which led to his involvement in motor racing.

In Hollywood, Reventlow became friends with fellow auto enthusiast James Dean and competed in club events around California. On September 30, 1955, he and Bruce Kessler were some of the last people to speak to Dean when they met on their way to an auto race in Salinas, California. Reventlow said he had coffee with Dean at a restaurant approximately thirty minutes before Dean was killed in an automobile accident near Cholame, California, while driving his Porsche 550 Spyder.

=== Professional career ===
Reventlow began his racing career in America in the mid-1950s, initially with a Mercedes before moving to an 1100cc Cooper in 1956. The next year he went to Europe to buy a Maserati, which he crashed heavily at Snetterton, escaping unhurt. He also briefly drove a Cooper Formula 2 car, before returning to the United States. He then set up his own company in Venice, California, to construct Chevrolet-powered race cars he named Scarab with Phil Remington as chief engineer. Along with hired driver Chuck Daigh, the two were initially successful in racing. They won the majority of major sportscar events they entered, often in competition with the Cunningham team of Lister Jaguars. Reventlow had looked at buying a Lister Jaguar, but thought that he could build a better car. Daigh drove a Scarab to victory in the 1958 Riverside International Grand Prix in California, beating a field of international race car teams, including driver Phil Hill and the Ferrari Team. Carroll Shelby drove a Scarab to first place at Continental Divide Raceways in Castle Rock in Douglas County, Colorado, where he broke a course record.

His racing team was much talked about for having built the first Formula One race car in America. Shifting operations overseas to Britain, Reventlow&#x27;s team had little success racing the Scarab cars in Formula One against the new rear-engine race cars. He went back to the drawing board and built a competitive prototype Scarab rear-engined car, but had become less interested in racing before its testing was complete. In 1962, he shut down the operation, leased the California facilities to Shelby, and quit auto racing altogether.

Reventlow&#x27;s organization constructed a total of eight Scarabs during its existence. In a 1971 interview, Reventlow confirmed that three front-engined Chevy-powered sports cars, three front-engined formula cars, one rear-engined formula car and one rear-engined sports car were built. Two of the front-engined formula cars were powered by Reventlow-commissioned engines drawn up by American racing engine designer Leo Goossen to Reventlow&#x27;s specifications, while the third car was powered by a Goossen-designed and engineered Offenhauser engine. The rear-engined formula was powered by a modified Buick powerplant; this engine and the suspension/brake package were taken from this car and used on the rear-engined sports car, the last Scarab built.

== Personal life ==
At the age of 21, Reventlow was given the choice between becoming an American, Danish or British citizen. He chose American citizenship, saying, &quot;I thought it over for a full 20 seconds.&quot;

On March 24, 1960, Reventlow married actress Jill St. John at the Mark Hopkins Hotel in San Francisco. They separated in October 1962. St. John filed for divorce on October 2, 1963, citing extreme cruelty; she stated that Reventlow called her &quot;stupid and incompetent&quot; in front of others and bullied her into taking part in dangerous sports. Their divorce was granted on October 30, 1963.

While estranged from St. John, Reventlow dated actress Sherry Jackson.

On November 6, 1964, Reventlow married ex-Mouseketeer Cheryl Holdridge in a lavish ceremony in Hollywood before 600 guests. Reventlow&#x27;s mother, Barbara Hutton, could not attend the wedding because of illness but gave the couple a $500,000, five-bedroom home set on 21 acres in Benedict Canyon.

=== Death ===
In 1972, Reventlow was seeking real-estate developers as partners to build a ski resort in Aspen, Colorado, where he had a home. He was an experienced pilot, with thousands of hours, rated fully for IFR on multi-engine planes, but on July 24, 1972, Reventlow was a passenger, scouting locations for real estate in a hired single-engine Cessna 206. The pilot was an inexperienced 27-year-old student with only 39 hours&#x27; flying time who flew into a blind canyon during a thunderstorm and stalled the aircraft while trying to turn around. The plane plunged to the ground, killing all four aboard.

Reventlow was initially buried, but his remains were later exhumed and cremated. His ashes are interred in the Woolworth mausoleum at the Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx.

<doc id="797542" wikidata="Q3658797" url="?curid=797542" title="Lincoln's New Salem">
<text>Lincoln&#x27;s New Salem State Historic Site is a reconstruction of the former village of New Salem in Menard County, Illinois, where Abraham Lincoln lived from 1831 to 1837. While in his twenties, the future U.S. President made his living in this village as a boatman, soldier in the Black Hawk War, general store owner, postmaster, surveyor, and rail splitter, and was first elected to the Illinois General Assembly.

Lincoln left New Salem for Springfield in 1837, and the village was generally abandoned about 1840, as other towns developed. After Lincoln&#x27;s death in 1865, historians and biographers collected the memories, documents, and plans of the village from former residents and neighbors of Lincoln, and the site&#x27;s archaeological remains were studied. In 1921, a state park opened on the village site to commemorate Lincoln and Illinois&#x27; frontier history. The Civilian Conservation Corps built a historic recreation of New Salem based on its original foundations in the 1930s. The village is located northwest of Springfield, and approximately south of Petersburg.

==Original New Salem==
New Salem was founded in 1829, when James Rutledge and John Camron built a gristmill on the Sangamon River. They surveyed and sold village lots for commercial business and homes on the ridge stretching to the west above the mill. Over the first few years of its existence, the town grew rapidly, but after the county seat was located in nearby Petersburg, the village began to shrink and by 1840, it was abandoned. The fact that the Sangamon River was not well-suited for steamboat travel was also a reason for the town&#x27;s decline.

In 1831, when Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s father, Thomas, relocated the family to a new homestead in Macon County, Illinois, 22-year-old Lincoln struck out on his own. Lincoln arrived in New Salem by way of flatboat and he remained in the village for about six years. During his stay, Lincoln earned a living as a shopkeeper, soldier in the Black Hawk War, general store owner, postmaster, land surveyor, and rail splitter, as well as doing odd jobs around the village. As far as historians know, Lincoln never owned a home in the village as most single men did not own homes at this time; however, he would often sleep in the tavern or his general store and take his meals with a nearby family.

While living here, Lincoln ran for the Illinois General Assembly in 1832, handily winning his New Salem precinct but losing the countywide district election. He tried again in 1834 and won. Lincoln left New Salem and moved to Springfield, also in his election district, around 1837.

When Lincoln lived in New Salem, the village was home to a cooper shop, blacksmith shop, wool carding mill, four general stores (including the Lincoln-Berry General Store), a tavern, a grocery, two doctors&#x27; offices, a shoemaker, a carpenter, a hat maker, a tanner, a schoolhouse/church, several residences, common pastures, and kitchen gardens. During its short existence, the village was home to anywhere from 20 to 25 families at a time. New Salem was not a small farm village, but instead a commercial village full of young businessmen and craftsmen trying to start a new life on the frontier.

==Lincoln&#x27;s New Salem State Historic Site==

In 1906, William Randolph Hearst purchased the village land and deeded it to the Old Salem Chautauqua Association. In 1919, the land was gifted to the State of Illinois. The site was opened to the public on May 19, 1921. Over time, building reconstructions were erected on the foundations of the original village, mostly by the Civilian Conservation Corps, during the Great Depression. The location is presently called Lincoln&#x27;s New Salem State Historic Site, featuring 23 buildings, mostly log houses and costumed interpreters, representing the era of Lincoln&#x27;s residency. The cabins, shops, and businesses are furnished by period implements, objects, and furniture, with many acquired from area farms and homes. In addition to the village, the park includes extensive woodlands. 
Twenty-two of the village buildings are reconstructed; one log cabin, the Onstot Cooper Shop, is original, although it had been previously moved by Henry Onstot to Petersburg in 1840. In 1922, it was returned to New Salem on what archeologists believe was its original foundation. In addition to archeological investigations, much of the town was recreated based on period documents and the recollections and drawings of former residents, who had been interviewed in the late 19th century.

=== Steamboats &quot;Talisman&quot; ===
In 1832 a 136-foot, 150-ton river steamer &quot;Talisman&quot; ventured from Cincinnati, Ohio, down the Ohio River, up the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers, and into central Illinois on the Sangamon River, while chartered to Springfield businessman Vincent Bogue. Lincoln helped clear obstructions from the riverbanks on &quot;Talisman&quot;&#x27;s trip upriver, and co-piloted the steamer with Rowan Herndon back to Beardstown.

In the summer of 1961, after a period of design and fabrication by Dubuque Boat &amp; Boiler Works at Dubuque, Iowa, the new sternwheel steamboat &quot;Talisman&quot; made its way to New Salem by way of the Mississippi River, Illinois River, and the Sangamon River. The steamer, christened &quot;Talisman&quot;, was a scaled-down representation of the previous vessel, at 40 tons and 73 feet in length, with an upper cabin and powered by a 60 bhp diesel engine. The recreation boat was given a landing next to the Rutledge Camron Saw and Grist Mill site on the riverbank, and tourists had the opportunity to take short excursions on the river. Unfortunately, just like the original &quot;Talisman&quot;, the recreated steamer was plagued by low water levels on the river which gradually increased the difficulty of navigation over the years until in 1998 the river dam at Petersburg was abandoned and water levels became too low. The boat was finally grounded a few miles upriver from the historical site, and then served as a large lawn decoration about a hundred feet from the riverbank. On November 19, 2021, the boat was destroyed in a controlled burn.

===Visitors===
Lincoln&#x27;s New Salem was visited by approximately 600,000 people in 2006. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, under the name, &quot;Lincoln&#x27;s New Salem Village.&quot; The historic site includes a visitor&#x27;s center with an exhibit and theater.

Active recreational infrastructure centers on the &quot;Mentor Graham Trail&quot;, long, and the &quot;Volksmarch Trail&quot;, long. The state park contains 200 campsites, including 100 electrical hookups.

<text>The Sangamon River is a principal tributary of the Illinois River, approximately long, in central Illinois in the United States. It drains a mostly rural agricultural area and runs through Decatur and past Springfield. The river is associated with the early career of Abraham Lincoln, who was a sometime boatman working on the river, and played an important role in early European settlement of Illinois, when the area around was known as the &quot;Sangamon River Country&quot;. The section of the Sangamon River that flows through Robert Allerton Park near Monticello was named a National Natural Landmark in 1971.

==Description==
The river rises from several short headstreams in southern McLean County that arise from a glacial moraine southeast of Bloomington-Normal, Illinois. Part of the moraine is publicly owned as the Moraine View State Recreation Area. The river&#x27;s course forms a large arc through central Illinois, first flowing east into Champaign County, Illinois, south through Mahomet, then west through Monticello and Decatur, then turning northwest to flow along the north side of Springfield. It receives Salt Creek at , approximately north-northwest of Springfield; then the river turns west, forming the southern boundary of Mason County with Menard and Cass counties. It joins the Illinois River from the east just north of Beardstown.
The Sangamon is impounded in Decatur to form Lake Decatur, constructed in 1920–1922 to provide a water supply for Decatur. This lake, formed by damming the main stem of the river, with no control over upstream land uses, has had major problems with siltation and agricultural pollution. The lake often has excessive nitrate levels from agricultural runoff. Many times the city was forced to warn people not to allow babies to consume water in Decatur because of &quot;blue baby syndrome&quot;, Methemoglobinemia. Decatur has now installed nitrate treatment to avoid this problem.

The upper Sangamon, between Mahomet and Monticello, runs along the face of a terminal moraine within the Lake Michigan Glacial Lobe, which ranges in age from 28,000 to 12,000 BP. During the glacial Woodfordian Substage (middle Wisconsin Stage), ice of the Lake Michigan Glacial Lobe advanced rapidly, leaving a terminal moraine parallel to the modern Sangamon River. The ice stagnated and melted behind this moraine, without the meltwater overtopping the terminal moraine. Along this stretch, the eastern part of the watershed of the Sangamon therefore consists of short creeks, two to three miles (3–5 km) in length, that drain the face of the moraine. This forms an asymmetric watershed typical of rivers formed along the face of a terminal moraine.

==History==

The river was home to many different groups of Native Americans in the centuries before the arrival of Europeans. The name of the river comes from a Pottawatomie word &quot;Sain-guee-mon&quot; meaning &quot;where there is plenty to eat.&quot; In the 18th century, groups of the Kickapoo settled along the river. In the middle 18th century, the region near the river was the scene of a conflict between the Illini and Meskwaki as part of the larger French and Iroquois Wars. French traders were active in the region throughout the middle 18th century when it was part of the Illinois Country.

The first U.S. settlers arrived in the region in the 1810s. In 1821, Elijah Iles built a log-framed store, the first commercial building in Springfield. Groups of Cumberland Presbyterians settled the river valley beginning in 1825, giving the region a distinctive culture identified and described at the turn of the 20th century by Edgar Lee Masters.

Abraham Lincoln arrived with his family in the area in 1830 to settle a section of government land bisected by the river. The site, now Lincoln Trail Homestead State Memorial, was selected by Lincoln&#x27;s father after the family migrated from Indiana. The 21-year-old Lincoln helped build a 16 foot by 16 foot (4.8 m by 4.8 m) cabin along the river. The following year in 1831, he canoed down the river to homestead on his own near New Salem in Menard County northwest of Springfield. Later that year he floated down the river with companions on a flatboat to the Illinois River, and then following the Mississippi River to New Orleans.

Lincoln was impressed by the navigational difficulties on the river, especially during the arrival of the first steamship, the &quot;Talisman&quot;, a 150-ton steamer, up the river to Springfield in March 1832. Some sources state that Lincoln himself piloted the first steamship up the Sangamon to Springfield, accomplishing this feat with many men, almost as large as Lincoln, with axes to chop through whatever trees impeded the journey. More likely Lincoln acted as a guide and axeman. In later years, he told of taking a steamship three miles (5 km) into the prairie after losing his way on the Sangamon during a flood. During his first campaign for the Illinois General Assembly in 1832, he made navigational improvements on the river a centerpiece of his platform. From 1848 to 1860, Lincoln practiced law in the Illinois Eighth Judicial Circuit, which meant he regularly crossed the river as he traveled around the circuit.

The Potawatomi Trail of Death passed through here in 1838.

==The river today==

Despite its environmental problems, the Sangamon River is a focus of recreation for the people of Central Illinois. Key parklands along the river, moving from upstream to downstream, include Shady Rest, Robert Allerton Park, the parks bordering Lake Decatur, Rock Springs Conservation Area, Lincoln Trail Homestead State Park, Springfield&#x27;s Carpenter Park and Riverside Park, the Sangamon River State Fish and Wildlife Area, Lincoln&#x27;s New Salem, Saybrook, and the Sanganois State Fish and Wildlife Area.

The river was mentioned in Sufjan Stevens&#x27;s song &quot;Decatur, Or, Round Of Applause For Your Stepmother!&quot;. Singer songwriter Ben Bedford references the Sangamon in several of his songs, one of which is titled after it.

<text>Janusz Magnuski (1933–1999) was a Polish author and military historian. His principal works document the development and deployment of Polish and Soviet armor utilized during World War II and he has been called &quot;the world&#x27;s most noted historian of Soviet tank history&quot;. He was one of the authoritative sources for documentation of the hardware on display in the Museum of the Polish Army located in Warsaw.

He was born in Poland on August 12, 1933 and died of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in Warsaw on November 6, 1999.

<text>The International Building Exhibition (Interbau) was an architectural project in which a number of prominent international architects designed buildings for the reconstruction of the Hansa quarter of Berlin after World War II. After the buildings were constructed, the exhibit was officially opened in July 1957. Many of the buildings still stand today, including those designed by Le Corbusier, Oscar Niemeyer, Arne Jacobsen, Alvar Aalto, and Walter Gropius. Situated in a park, Interbau showcased an array of designs by the foremost Western architects from many countries, with high and low-rise buildings merging seamlessly with the landscape and greenery.

== Background ==
Towards the end of World War II, Berlin was heavily bombed by the Allies. A significant portion of the city was razed. The Hansa neighbourhood was no exception. 

After the defeat of Nazi Germany, the US, France, and Great Britain controlled the Western sectors of Berlin, while the East was under the grip of the Soviets. Both East and West Berlin suffered from housing shortages. For a brief period, the two sectors attempted to work together and rebuild. However global power politics dominated, and the city was divided. Both East and West Berlin saw Berlin&#x27;s reconstruction as a way to demonstrate the superiority of their values and way of life. A new law, LEX IBA, was enacted to allow for planning and design without the previous building codes. In East Berlin, Stalinallee was created; in the West, Interbau.

Stalinallee was inspired by Socialist realism and classicism. Because the buildings were structured in three tiers, they were often compared to wedding cakes. While the facades of the buildings on Stallinalle were uniform, the Soviets emphasised luxurious finishes within the buildings, including stucco ceilings, parquet floors, double glazing on fixtures, and central heating.

The focus of Interbau was buildings made by and for humans. In the words of Rolf Schwedler, the Senator for Building and Housing, &quot;In this regard, the demands and requirements of the modern man are to be taken into full consideration.&quot; Unlike Stalinallee, the buildings of Interbau utilised a wide array of colors. While apartments within the builds had similar appointments, the outer structures were unique. 

Interbau was intended to be a testament to Western values of freedom of expression, where high and low-rise buildings merged seamlessly with the landscape and greenery. Thirteen architects participated in the project.

The exhibit opened on 6 July 1957, in West Berlin&#x27;s Hansa neighbourhood. 

== Architects ==
More than 50 architects, from around the world (excluding Soviet-occupied territories in Eastern Europe), were involved. By including architects from so many countries, West Berlin communicated that Interbau was not only German, it was multicultural, drawing inspiration from around the world. Some of the more notable architects who worked on Interbau include Le Corbusier (France), Oscar Niemeyer (Brazil), Arne Jacobsen (Denmark), Alvar Aalto (Finland), and Walter Gropius (German-American). 

The buildings were situated in a park, and in addition to the architecture, careful attention was given to landscaping. Led by Walter Rossow, Interbau could live up to its vision of &quot;people in a green metropolis&quot; only by careful, integrated landscape design. In 1955, just two years before the opening of the exhibit, Rossow&#x27;s article &quot;Green Spaces in the Hansaviertel&quot; laid out the plan for landscaping Intebau. In 1956 work began on Interbau&#x27;s green spaces.

== Major contributions ==
Among the 601 apartment complexes and additional amenities, five buildings stand out. These buildings include the Oscar Niemeyer-Haus, Walter Gropius-Haus, Alvar Aalto-Haus, Corbusierhaus, and Congress Hall. 

The Walter Gropius House was designed by Walter Gropius and Wils Ebert. The structure features pops of bright colors on the balconies and entrances. The balconies line the building in a checkered fashion.  The house itself is a concave structure with narrow sides. Like many other buildings in Interbau, the Gropius and Ebert design sought to ensure no visible line between the residential area and the park.

Corbusierhaus was intended to be a remodel of the Unité d&#x27;habitation in Milan. The building was intended to be a &quot;city in a city&quot;.  Its  size, however, caused some commotion. In contrast to other buildings, Courbusierhaus included 530 apartments and 17 stories.

Designed by a prominent Brazilian architect, Oscar Niemeyer Haus features 78 apartments with distinct blue and yellow balconies. The building is supported by v-shaped concrete pillars. Like many other buildings in Interbau, the apartment complex is lined with windows, allowing nature into people&#x27;s homes.

Alvar Aalto-Haus, designed by leading Finnish architect Alvar Aalto, was eight stories high and contained 78 apartments. To bring nature into the home, each apartment featured a large patio. Windows were included on all sides of the building. Additionally, the building bends towards the west and opens towards the east allowing all apartments to capture natural light.

Congress Hall, also known as the House of World Cultures, was designed by American architect Hugh Stubbins as a gift from the United States. The building was constructed on an artificial mound so that it could be seen from East Berlin. After the exhibition ended, Congress Hall was gifted to the city of Berlin. The building acted as a center for discussion of international contemporary arts, focusing on non-European cultures and societies. However on 21 May 1980, the structure collapsed. The building has since been reconstructed in its original style.

==Other buildings==

The Dutch architectural firm Van den Broek &amp; Bakema, comprising Jo van den Broek and Jaap Bakema, participated in the project. Although their building, known as the Bakema Tower, was not constructed until two years after the exhibition opened, the plans and models were included in the catalogue.

== Today ==
Interbau no longer has the mission of promoting Western values of freedom. The exhibit is an important example of modernism, a successful integration of nature into the living space. While some of the individual buildings have been recognised, the community as a whole and the successful collaboration of notable architects have not been given the same prominent recognition. Although residential, the area is available for tourism and study.

<text>Operation Earnest Will (24 July 1987 – 26 September 1988) was an American military protection of Kuwaiti-owned tankers from Iranian attacks in 1987 and 1988, three years into the Tanker War phase of the Iran–Iraq War. It was the largest naval convoy operation since World War II, and flowed from Resolution 598 which had been adopted three days earlier.

The U.S. Navy warships that escorted the tankers, part of U.S. Naval Forces Central Command, were the operations&#x27; most visible part. U.S. Air Force AWACS radar planes provided surveillance and U.S. Army special-operations helicopters hunted for possible attackers.

Other U.S. Navy vessels participated in Operation Earnest Will. They were then under the command of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Seventh Fleet which had primary responsibility for combat operations in the Persian Gulf. The numerous ships used in Operation Earnest Will mostly consisted of Carrier Battle Groups, Surface Action Groups and ships from the Pacific&#x27;s Third and Seventh Fleets and the Mediterranean-based Sixth Fleet. They generally operated in and near the Persian Gulf for parts of their normal six-month deployments.

It was the first tactical operation of the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) that involved Navy SEALs, Special Boat Units, and 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne) (&quot;Nightstalkers&quot;) aviators all working together.

The French Navy also supported Resolution 598, as did the British Navy.

==Background==

The so-called &quot;Tanker War&quot; phase of the Iran–Iraq War started when Iraq attacked the oil terminal and oil tankers at Iran&#x27;s Kharg Island in early 1984. Iraq had expanded its air force with new, Exocet-equipped French and Soviet aircraft. Saddam&#x27;s aim in attacking Iranian shipping was, among other things, to provoke the Iranians to retaliate with extreme measures, such as closing the Strait of Hormuz to all maritime traffic, thereby bringing American intervention. Iran limited the retaliatory attacks to Iraqi shipping, leaving the strait open.

Becoming landlocked after the Battle of al-Faw, and due to the blockade of Iraqi oil pipelines to the Mediterranean Sea by Iran&#x27;s ally Syria, Iraq had to rely on its ally, Kuwait and other Gulf Arab allies to a lesser extent to transport its oil. After increasing attacks on Iran&#x27;s main oil export facility at Kharg Island by Iraq, Iran started to attack Kuwaiti tankers carrying Iraqi oil from 13 May 1984, and later attacking tankers from any Gulf state supporting Iraq. Attacks on ships of non-combatant nations in the Persian Gulf sharply increased thereafter, with both nations attacking oil tankers and merchant ships of neutral nations in an effort to deprive their opponent of trade.

Besides concerns about the intensified Tanker War, the superpowers feared that the possible fall of Basra, which was now under threat, might lead to a pro-Iranian Islamic republic in largely Shia-populated southern Iraq. During the first four months of 1987, Kuwait turned to the superpowers, partly to protect oil exports but largely to seek an end to the war through superpower intervention. In December 1986, Kuwait&#x27;s government asked the Reagan administration to send the U.S. Navy to protect Kuwaiti tankers against Iranian attacks. Although members of both the U.S. House and Senate opposed the reflagging policy, the executive debated this idea and finally agreed to it on 7 March 1987.

U.S. law forbade the use of navy ships to escort civilian vessels under a foreign flag, so the Kuwaiti ships were re-registered under the U.S. flag. Before Earnest Will formally began, it became clear how dangerous Persian Gulf operations would be. On 17 May 1987, an Iraqi F-1 Mirage fired two Exocet missiles at the guided missile frigate , killing 37 sailors and injuring 21. Iraqi officials said that the targeting of the U.S. warship was accidental.

==Operations==
After the passage of UNSCR 598 on 20 July 1987, the U.S. Navy began Operation Earnest Will at 2:00 a.m. (EDT) on 23 July 1987. , , , , and were the first U.S. Navy ships assigned to escort the Kuwaiti oil tankers, under the command of Rear Admiral Harold Bernsen.

===&quot;Bridgeton&quot; incident===
On the very first escort mission, on 24 July 1987, the Kuwaiti oil tanker &quot;al-Rekkah&quot;, re-flagged as the U.S. tanker MV &quot;Bridgeton&quot; and accompanied by US navy warships, struck an Iranian underwater mine planted some west of Farsi Island the night earlier by a Pasdaran special unit, damaging the ship, but causing no injuries. &quot;Bridgeton&quot; proceeded under her own power to Kuwait, with the U.S. Navy escorts following behind to avoid mines.

The operation was widely publicized, and American reporters aboard another ship in the convoy immediately issued reports about the incident, claiming it had &quot;played into Iran&#x27;s plan&quot;. Iran&#x27;s Prime Minister Mir Hossein Mousavi called it an &quot;irreparable blow to America&#x27;s political and military prestige&quot;, and said that it was the &quot;invisible hands [of God]&quot; that hit the US-flagged ship, and expressed hope that the U.S. Congress would put an immediate end to the Administration&#x27;s plan. The Congress was critical of the re-flagging policy, but still didn&#x27;t have a united position on the issue.

It was an unforeseen development. The commander of the task force admitted that in spite of intelligence warnings, no one had thought it necessary to check the route for naval mines, and it was soon brought out that not only did the U.S. not have any minesweepers in the Persian Gulf, it did not have any easily accessible minesweepers at all, so the escort operation was placed on hold until minesweepers would be available. The Pentagon deployed Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron 14 (HM-14) with eight minesweeping SeaStallion helicopters, five oceangoing minesweepers, and six small coastal minesweepers—dramatically increasing U.S. presence in the Persian Gulf, and increasing the probability of an Iran–U.S. confrontation. U.S. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger indirectly provoked Iran to retaliate.

===Subsequent operations===
In the following 14 months, many U.S. warships took up escort duties. At one point, more than 30 warships were in the region to support the operation.

===Operation Prime Chance===

Earnest Will overlapped with Operation Prime Chance, a largely secret effort to stop Iranian forces from attacking Persian Gulf shipping.
Despite the protection offered by U.S. Navy vessels, Iran used mines and small boats to harass the convoys steaming to and from Kuwait, at the time a principal ally of Iraq. In late July 1987, Rear Admiral Harold J. Bernsen, commander of the Middle East Force, requested Naval Special Warfare assets. Special Boat Teams deployed with six Mark III Patrol Boats and two Navy SEAL platoons in August. The Middle East Force decided to convert two oil service barges, &quot;Hercules&quot; and &quot;Wimbrown VII&quot;, into mobile sea bases. These were moored in the northern Persian Gulf, allowing special operations forces to thwart clandestine Iranian mining and small boat attacks.

On 21 September, Night Stalkers flying MH-6 and AH-6 &quot;Little Birds&quot; took off from the frigates and USS &quot;Klakring&quot; to track an Iranian ship, . The Nightstalkers watched &quot;Iran Ajr&quot; turn off its lights and begin laying mines. After receiving permission to attack, the helicopters fired guns and rockets, stopping the ship. &quot;Iran Ajr&quot;″s crew continued to push mines over the side, and the aircraft resumed firing until the crew abandoned ship. 

At first light, a SEAL team, assisted by Special Boat Teams, boarded the vessel and discovered nine mines on the vessel&#x27;s deck, as well as a logbook revealing areas where previous mines had been laid. towed the mine layer (a converted tank landing craft) to the Iran-Iraq war zone. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) technicians from EOD Mobile Unit 5 scuttled the vessel the following day. The logbook implicated Iran in mining international waters.

Within a few days, the special operations forces had determined the Iranian pattern of activity: hide during the day near oil and gas platforms in Iranian waters and at night, head toward the Middle Shoals Buoy, a navigation aid for tankers. With this knowledge, the special operations forces launched three Little Bird aircraft and two patrol craft to the buoy. The aircraft arrived first and were fired upon by three Iranian boats anchored near the buoy. In a short but intense firefight, the aircraft sank all three boats. The captured and wounded Iranians were later taken aboard the USS Guadalcanal for treatment. The injured Iranian detainees were returned through cooperation between the U.S. Red Cross and the Red Crescent.

Lessons from Earnest Will later led USSOCOM to acquire the patrol coastal ships and the Mark V Special Operations Craft.

===Operation Nimble Archer===

On 15 October, the reflagged U.S. tanker was struck by an Iranian Silkworm missile while at anchor near the oil terminal outside Kuwait City. Seventeen crewmen and the American captain were injured in the attack. On 18 October, the U.S. Navy responded with Operation Nimble Archer. Four destroyers shelled two Revolutionary Guard bases in the &quot;Rostam&quot; oil field, located on oil platforms, that had been used to stage attacks on shipping. After the shelling, the landed a SEAL platoon and a demolition unit that planted explosives on one of the platforms to destroy it. The SEALs then boarded and searched a third platform . Documents and radios were taken for intelligence.

===Operation Praying Mantis===

On 14 April 1988, east of Bahrain, the frigate hit a mine, blowing an immense hole in its hull. 10 sailors were injured. The U.S. retaliated fiercely. On 18 April, U.S. forces launched Operation Praying Mantis, attacking the Iranian fast-attack craft &quot;Joshan&quot;, the frigates and and Revolutionary Guard bases in the Sirri and Sassan oil fields. After U.S. warships bombarded the &quot;Sirri&quot; base, located on an oil platform, and set it ablaze, a UH-60 helicopter with a SEAL platoon flew toward the platform but was unable to get close enough because of the roaring fire. Secondary explosions soon wrecked the platform.

===Endgame===

Thereafter, Iranian attacks on neutral ships dropped drastically. On 3 July 1988, , mistook Iran Air Flight 655 for an Iranian F-14 and shot it down over the Strait of Hormuz. All 290 passengers and aircrew aboard the Airbus A300B2 died, including 65 children or infants.

The two effects of Earnest Will – Praying Mantis and the airliner&#x27;s downing – helped convince Iran to agree to a ceasefire on 18 July 1988 and a permanent end to hostilities on 20 August 1988, ending its eight-year war with Iraq.

On 26 September 1988, escorted the operation&#x27;s last tanker to Kuwait. The remaining SEALs, patrol boats, and helicopters then returned to the U.S.

<text>Semyon Ivanovich Chelyuskin (; 1707 – 1764) was a Russian polar explorer and naval officer.

Chelyuskin graduated from the Navigation School in Moscow. He first became a deputy navigator while serving in the Baltic Fleet (1728) and later promoted to navigator (1733). Chelyuskin was chosen for the Second (Great Northern) Kamchatka Expedition, in which he took part until 1743. He participated in expeditions, led by Vasily Pronchischev and Khariton Laptev. In spring of 1741, Chelyuskin made a voyage from the Khatanga River to the Pyasina River by land. He described the western coastline from the Taimyr Peninsula to the Middendorff Bay and then from the mouth of Pyasina to the mouth of the Yenisei River. In winter of 1741–1742, he traveled from Turukhansk to the mouth of the Khatanga River, describing the northern coastline of the Taimyr Peninsula from the Faddey Bay on the East to the mouth of the Taimyra River on the West. Chelyuskin found the northern extremity of Asia, which Aleksandr Fyodorovich Middendorf would later name after him in 1843 (Cape Chelyuskin).

He was discharged from the Baltic Fleet in the rank of a captain in 1760.

==Named in honor==
Cape Chelyuskin (the northernmost cape of Eurasia), Chelyuskin Peninsula (northern tip of Taymyr), Chelyuskin Island near Taymyr, famous Soviet Chelyuskin steamship and some streets and settlements have been named after Chelyuskin.

In 1930s the Soviet Union operated a steamship built in Denmark in 1933, SS &quot;Chelyuskin&quot;, named after Semion Chelyuskin. It sank in the Chukchi Sea near Kolyuchin Island during an ill-fated attempt to cover the Northern Sea Route.

The 1965-built icebreaker &quot;Ledokol-8&quot; was renamed &quot;Semyon Chelyuskin&quot; in 1966.
