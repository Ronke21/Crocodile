==History==

===Founding===

B36 Tórshavn was officially founded on 28 March 1936, but had already been playing matches since 1935. The capital was growing, and there was a lot of interest in football. B36 was founded by young people who wanted to play football, but had no opportunity to play for the existing club, HB Tórshavn. The initiative was taken by an entrepreneur called Niels Ejdesgaard, who became the first chairman of the new football club. When B36 was founded, they battled with local rivals for the rights to the Gundadalur Stadium, although both teams used the venue and played a number of derby matches there during that initial season. The conflict was solved by the mayor of Tórshavn, who decided that the stadium was to be shared equally between the two clubs. In 1946 the club were celebrated as national champions for the first time, and in 1965 the club won its first national cup.

===Hard times===

In 1962, B36 Tórshavn celebrated its fifth national championship, but dark times were to follow. The club would wait 35 years for its next national championship. To make matters worse, rival team HB Tórshavn experienced a lot of success in the same period. In the middle of the 1980s, B36 Tórshavn was relegated twice from the best division. Then in 1987, Kristian á Neystabø took over as chairman and Kjartan Mohr as cashier. They took on the task of rebuilding the club, and succeeded in making a turnaround. The results improved, and the cup was won in 1991, although the National Championship was lost in the final match that same year. Then, in 1997, the club celebrated its first national championship in 35 years. Since then, B36 Tórshavn has been five-time champions, and have won the cup three times.

===Local rivalry===

In the last 20–25 years, the local rivalry with HB Tórshavn has increased, and now the two clubs are about equal in strength. In 2018, the teams fought a fierce cup final, which B36 Tórshavn won on penalties, after one of the most dramatic cup finals ever at The Faroe Islands. After two red cards in the end of the match, B36 Tórshavn was playing 9 against 11 from the stoppage time in the ordinary match and through all the extended time. In the 95th minute, B36 Tórshavn equalized to 2–2 with the last shot in the ordinary match from the youngster Hannes Agnarson, and went on to keep HB Tórshavn from scoring. This 9 against 11 was a repetition of the previous years 2nd leg of the cup semi finals, where B36 Tórshavn also played with 9 men in all the extended time and about 20 minutes of the ordinary time. Despite being down with 2 men, B36 Tórshavn won the match 3–2, when club legend Róaldur Jacobsen scored from 72 meters in the last minute.

==Players sold abroad==

Normally Faroese players who move abroad to play football are youngsters who join foreign clubs as academy players, but recently B36 Tórshavn has sold two senior players to norwegian football teams. In 2018 the Faroese international defender Odmar Færø was sold to Hamarkameratene, where he played one season. He then returned to Faroese league to play for KÍ Klaksvík. Likewise, the former Faroe Islands national under-21 football team player Meinhard Olsen was sold to Kristiansund BK in 2018. After a short spell with B36 in 2020 he again went abroad, and is now playing with Mjøndalen IF Fotball in Norway. In June 2019, he made his debut on the Faroe Islands national football team in a match against Spain.

In 2022 Martin Agnarsson was sold to the danish Superliga team Viborg FF, after the teams had met in UEFA Europa Conference League. Martin is currently a regular player on Faroe Islands national under-21 football team. In November 2022 he had his debut on the Faroe Islands national football team in a friendly against Kosovo.

==International players==

B36 Tórshavn regularly delivers players to Faroese National Team. Most recently, Andrass Johansen, Hannes Agnarsson, Jann Benjaminsen and Magnus Egilsson were called up for the matches against Liechtenstein and Denmark. A current player on The Faroese U21 National Team is Gutti Dahl Olsen.

In 2023 Taufee Skandari made his debut for Afghanistan. This was the first time ever, that a non-Faroese player in the Faroese league has been selected to a national team. He had his debut in a match against Kyrgyzstan in the 2023 CAFA Nations Cup.

Andrias Eriksen, Eli Nielsen, Hannes Agnarsson, Benjamin Heinesen, Andrass Johansen, Jann Benjaminsen, Símun Sólheim and Silas Eyðsteinsson have all played on The Faroese U21 National Team.

==European competitions==
Clubs in the Faroe Islands first took part in European competitions in 1992, after the Faroe Islands Football Association became a member of UEFA in 1990. B36 was drawn against Avenir Beggen in the Cup Winners Cup qualifying round in 1992. They came close, but didn&#x27;t make it through to the first round after a 1–0 loss and a 1–1 draw at home.

In 2005/06, the team reached the second round in the UEFA Cup after defeating ÍBV Vestmannaeyar of Iceland 3–2 on aggregate. In the second round, they narrowly lost to Danish Superliga-club FC Midtjylland 1–2 in the away leg and drew 2–2 at home. The team reached the second qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League in 2006/07 after defeating Birkirkara FC of Malta 5–2 on aggregate and were eliminated in second qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League, losing both matches to Fenerbahçe 4–0 and 5–0.

In the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League, B36 reached the second qualifying round, after defeating St Joseph&#x27;s, Gibraltar on penalties in the preliminary round, after 2–2 on aggregate. The team also made it through the first qualifying round by defeating OFK Titograd from Montenegro after a 0–0 draw at home and a 2–1 victory away. In the second round, B36 Tórshavn was up against Beşiktaş Istanbul. That opposition was too strong, and the matches ended 0–2 and 0–6.

The campaign in 2020–21 Europa League was the most successful European campaign ever, where B36 became the first Faroese team to get through three rounds in an UEFA club competition. This was the year of the pandemic, so the qualifying matches in were played with one single match each round. The victories were won against St Joseph&#x27;s, Gibraltar (away), Levadia Tallinn aet. at home and The New Saints after penalties at home. The opposition in the third round became a bit to strong. B36 played away, and lost 1-3 against CSKA Sofia.

In the 2022–23 Conference League B36 became the first Faroese team ever, who managed to turn a defeat away into a win on aggregate. They lost 0-2 to Borac Banja Luka, but managed to win 3-1 aet. at home and 4-3 after penalties. The campaign ended in third round, where the danish team Viborg were the opponents.

In the 2023–24 Conference League, B36 made it to the third qualifying round after victories against Paide Linnameeskond from Estonia and Haverfordwest County from Wales. In the third round the opposition from the Croat team Rijeka proved to be to strong, and B36 lost both matches.

<text>Frigate navy is a term describing a nation state&#x27;s navy that is made of mostly frigates or destroyers as a major combat force. This navy would thus be lacking large vessels such as cruisers, a significant number of effective submarines, or aircraft carriers, but it would also be more effective and deployable than a navy that just maintains corvettes or gunboats. A frigate navy can be a green water navy or a brown water navy, depending on how logistics are structured. The Royal Netherlands Navy is an example of a frigate navy, as was the U.S. Navy in the War of 1812.

<text>Ronald T. Y. Moon (September 4, 1940 – July 4, 2022) was the Chief Justice of the Hawaii State Supreme Court in Honolulu, Hawaii. He served his first term from 1993 to 2003, and his second term from 2003 until retiring in August 2010. Moon studied at Coe College towards bachelor&#x27;s degrees in psychology and sociology. He went on to the University of Iowa College of Law, where he obtained his Juris Doctor. He returned to Honolulu in 1965 and became law clerk to United States District Court Judge Martin Pence. He served under Pence for a year. In 1966, Moon joined the staff of the Prosecuting Attorney of Honolulu where he was deputy prosecutor until 1968. He left public service to become a partner in the law firm Libkuman, Ventura, Moon and Ayabe where he stayed until 1982. It was from the law firm that Governor George Ariyoshi appointed Moon to the Hawaii State Judiciary as a circuit court judge. Governor John Waihee then elevated Moon to the office of Associate Justice of the Hawaii State Supreme Court in 1990. In 1993, Moon was once again elevated to become chief justice.
He retired on August 31, 2010.

On May 5, 1993, Chief Justice Moon, joined by Justice Steven Levinson, ruled that the State of Hawaii must have compelling reasons to justify excluding same-sex couples from marriage in the case of &quot;Baehr v. Miike&quot;. This decision was the first in the world that suggested same-sex couples should be granted equal marriage rights. His decision did not gain a majority, but Court of Appeals Judge James S. Burns, who was filling in for a recused Justice, wrote a concurrence agreeing with the result of Moon&#x27;s opinion.

Moon was of Korean descent. His grandparents were among the first Korean immigrants to Hawaii.

<doc id="827929" wikidata="Q581925" url="?curid=827929" title="Sleeping Cupid (Michelangelo)">
<text>The Sleeping Cupid is a now-lost sculpture created by Renaissance artist Michelangelo, which he artificially aged to make it look like an antique on the advice of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco in order to sell for a higher price. It was this sculpture which first brought him to the attention of patrons in Rome.

== Creation ==
Michelangelo began working on his sleeping cupid in 1495, in Florence, Italy. Michelangelo never said why he carved a sculpture of a cupid, but it is known that he studied a sculpture in the Medici Gardens that contained a sleeping cupid. Ascanio Condivi, the Italian Painter, described Michelangelo&#x27;s work as &quot;a god of love, aged six or seven years old and asleep&quot;.

== Description ==
Michelangelo created the sculpture and then passed it onto a dealer, Baldassare del Milanese. Eventually the sleeping cupid was bought by Cardinal Riario of San Giorgio; controversy arose when he discovered the statue was falsely aged and demanded his money back. However, Michelangelo was permitted to keep his share of the money. When Michelangelo offered to take the sculpture back from Baldassare when he learned how much money he made off of selling it, Baldassare refused, saying, &quot;he would rather break it into a hundred pieces; he had bought the child, and it was his property&quot;. 

The &quot;Sleeping Cupid&quot; was a significant work in establishing the reputation of the young Michelangelo, who was 21 at the time. The sculpture was later donated by Cesare Borgia to Isabella d&#x27;Este, and was probably collected by Charles I of England when all the Gonzaga collections were bought and taken to London in the seventeenth century. 

It was previously impossible to attempt to identify Michelangelo&#x27;s cupid, until Paul Norton&#x27;s proposal that Michelangelo&#x27;s work may be in the &quot;Album of Busts and Statues in Whitehall.&quot; This led to one of the cupids on the album to be thought to be Michelangelo&#x27;s lost cupid, as the description matches quite well. But it is still unknown if this is the exact one Michelangelo created, as there is no record the statue after the original sale.

== Destruction ==
In 1698, the &quot;Sleeping Cupid&quot; was most likely destroyed in the great fire in the Palace of Whitehall, London along with many other fine works of art. It is unknown what happened to the sculpture.

<text>Alexander Stuart Murray, FBA (8 January 1841March, 1904) was a Scottish archaeologist. He was known for excavations on Cyprus.

==Life==
Murray was born at Arbroath, and educated there, at the Royal High School, Edinburgh and at the Universities of Edinburgh and Berlin. In 1867 he entered the British Museum as an assistant in the department of Greek and Roman antiquities under Sir Charles Newton, whom he succeeded in 1886. His younger brother, George Robert Milne Murray (1858–1911), was made keeper of the botanical department in 1895, a rare instance of two brothers becoming heads of departments at the museum.

In 1873 Murray published a &quot;Manual of Mythology&quot;, and in the following year contributed to the &quot;Contemporary Review&quot; two articles—one on the Homeric question—which led to a friendship with Mr Gladstone, the other on Greek painters. In 1874 he also published the popular work &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in Mythology&quot;. In 1880-1883 he brought out his &quot;History of Greek Sculpture: From the Earliest Times Down to the Age of Pheidias&quot;, which at once became a standard work. In 1886, he was selected by the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland to deliver the next year&#x27;s Rhind lectures on archaeology, out of which grew his &quot;Handbook of Greek Archaeology&quot; (1892).

In 1894-1896 Murray directed excavations in Cyprus including those at Enkomi; they were undertaken by means of a bequest of £2000 from Miss Emma Tournour Turner. The objects obtained are described and illustrated in &quot;Excavations in Cyprus&quot;, published by the trustees of the museum in 1900. Murray&#x27;s other official publications include three folio volumes on Terra-cotta Sarcophagi, White Athenian Vases and Designs from Greek Vases. In 1898 he wrote for the &quot;Portfolio&quot; a monograph on Greek bronzes, founded on lectures delivered at the Royal Academy in that year, and he contributed many articles on archaeology to standard publications.

In recognition of his services to archaeology he was made LL.D. of Glasgow University in 1887 and elected a corresponding member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences in 1900.

<text>Insure++ is a memory debugger computer program, used by software developers to detect various errors in programs written in C and C++. It is made by Parasoft, and is functionally similar to other memory debuggers, such as Purify, Valgrind and Dr Memory.

==Overview==
Insure++ can automatically find erroneous accesses to freed memory (use-after-free situations), array-bounds violations, freeing unallocated memory (which often happens when a programmer frees the same memory twice, or when he frees global or stack memory), and many others.

Unlike Purify and Valgrind, Insure++ inserts its instrumentation at the source-code level, which allows it to detect errors that the other tools miss. In particular, Insure++ can detect buffer overflows in automatic arrays, and overflows which involve pointers that accidentally &quot;jump&quot; from one valid memory region to another, as in the following example:
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
int main()
 char *p = malloc(1024); /* first dynamically-allocated block */
 char *q = malloc(1024); /* second block */
 p += 1200; /* At this point, &quot;p&quot; is likely to point into the second block. 
 However, false assumptions about the real behaviour lead to mistakes. */
 *p = &#x27;a&#x27;; /* invalid write (past the end of the first block) */


The source-level instrumentation allows it to not only identify that a leak occurred, but where it occurred. Some tools merely provide information about where the memory was allocated, Insure++ also gives a stack trace for when/where the actual leak occurred.

Additionally, Insure++ will produce Linear Code Sequence and Jump Code Coverage metrics for all tested code.

<text>Khordad () was a Persian-language newspaper published in Tehran, Iran. It was available between 1998 and 1999. Considered to be a liberal reformist newspaper, its title was a reference to the &quot;2nd of Khordad Movement&quot;, the Iranian reform movement. The word &#x27;Khordad&#x27; is the New Persian continuation of Middle Persian &quot;Hordad&quot;, from Avestan Haurvatat &quot;wholeness.&quot;

==History and profile==
&quot;Khordad&quot; was established in 1998. Its founder and publisher was Abdollah Noori. It was shut down by Iran Special Clerical Court in November 1999, and its publisher and editor-in-chief, Abdollah Noori, was sentenced to jail for five years on 27 November 1999. &quot;Khordad&quot; was based in Tehran.

<text>The Mermen are an American instrumental rock band from San Francisco, California formed in 1989. They have since moved to Santa Cruz, California.

The group&#x27;s sound was originally rooted in surf and psychedelic rock music of the 1960s, although they have made &quot;sincere attempts to get away from the surf music label&quot; and currently delve into many genres, mainly driven by the melodic visions of the band&#x27;s founder, songwriter, and guitarist Jim Thomas. The band&#x27;s music is entirely instrumental and &quot;does a good job of defying description&quot;. The Mermen perform as a power trio: electric guitar, electric bass, and drums, with occasional guests for live concerts. They were featured in the soundtrack of the Sony PlayStation video game &quot;Road Rash 3D&quot; and have contributed music for films as well.

The 2010 album, &quot;In God We Trust&quot;, was their first release in a decade. It was followed in December 2012 by their first full-length Christmas release, &quot;Do You Hear What I Hear - A Very MERMEN Christmas&quot;.

Thomas also fronts The Shitones, an associated band that features some of the same personnel (Jennifer Burnes on bass, and Shigemi Komiyama on drums prior to his 2014 death.) While Mermen feature Thomas&#x27;s original compositions almost exclusively, the Shitones are a cover band that emphasizes instrumental rock hits of the 1950s and &#x27;60s by the likes of Link Wray and The Ventures, along with instrumental versions of songs by Neil Young, The Grateful Dead, Jimi Hendrix and others.

<text>Ali Reza Noori (or sometimes Ali-Reza Nouri) (, April 8, 1962 in Isfahan – October 31, 2002) was a member of the 6th Iranian parliament and a supporter of President Mohammad Khatami&#x27;s reform programs. He was the brother of Abdollah Noori. Dr. Ali Reza Noori was educated in medicine and was a practicing physician before entering politics.

Noori was killed in a car accident in northern Iran during his term in the parliament. Allegations of conspiracy surrounded the tragic accident in which another reformist member of the parliament, Masoud Hashemi Zehi, from Khash, Sistan-Baluchistan, was also killed.

<doc id="827945" wikidata="Q2707421" url="?curid=827945" title="Romantic ballet">
<text>The Romantic ballet is defined primarily by an era in ballet in which the ideas of Romanticism in art and literature influenced the creation of ballets. The era occurred during the early to mid 19th century primarily at the Théâtre de l&#x27;Académie Royale de Musique of the Paris Opera Ballet and Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in London. It is typically considered to have begun with the 1827 début in Paris of the ballerina Marie Taglioni in the ballet &quot;La Sylphide&quot;, and to have reached its zenith with the premiere of the divertissement &quot;Pas de Quatre&quot; staged by the Ballet Master Jules Perrot in London in 1845. The Romantic ballet had no immediate end, but rather a slow decline. Arthur Saint-Léon&#x27;s 1870 ballet &quot;Coppélia&quot; is considered to be the last work of the Romantic Ballet. Romantic ballet is believed to have been experienced in three main phases: The zenith phase from 1830 to 1840, the decline phase from 1850 to 1880, and the revival phase in the 1890s prior to Diaghilev. Each phase is synonymous with the production of a few specifically stylized ballets.

During this era, the development of pointework, although still at a fairly basic stage, profoundly affected people&#x27;s perception of the ballerina. Many lithographs of the period show her virtually floating, poised only on the tip of a toe. This idea of weightlessness was capitalised on in ballets such as &quot;La Sylphide&quot; and &quot;Giselle&quot;, and the famous leap apparently attempted by Carlotta Grisi in &quot;La Péri&quot;.

Other features which distinguished Romantic ballet were the separate identity of the scenarist or author from the choreographer, and the use of specially written music as opposed to a &quot;pastiche&quot; typical of the ballet of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The invention of gas lighting enabled gradual changes and enhanced the mysteriousness of many ballets with its softer gleam. Illusion became more diverse with wires and trap doors being widely used. Additionally, technical advancements in production of tulle facilitated the popularization of romantic tutus, a costume that became synonymous with the era.

== Cult of the ballerina ==
The Romantic era marked the rise of the ballerina as a central part of ballet, where previously men had dominated performances. There had always been admiration for superior dancers, but elevating ballerinas to the level of celebrity came into its own in the nineteenth century, especially as female performers became idealized and objectified. Marie Taglioni became the prototypical Romantic ballerina, praised highly for her lyricism. The movement style for Romantic ballerinas was characterized by soft, rounded arms and a forward tilt in the upper body. This gave the woman a flowery, willowy look. Leg movements became more elaborate due to the new tutu length and rising standards of technical proficiency. Important Romantic ballerinas included Marie Taglioni, Carlotta Grisi, Lucille Grahn, Fanny Cerrito, Pauline Leroux and Fanny Elssler. The plots of many ballets were dominated by spirit women—sylphs, wilis, and ghosts, who enslaved the hearts and senses of mortal men and made it impossible for them to live happily in the real world.

While ballerinas became increasingly virtuosic, male dancers became scarce, particularly in Paris (although they were still common in other European areas, such as Denmark). This led to the rise of the female travesty dancer - a female dancer who played male roles. While travesty dancing had existed prior to the romantic period it was generally used in tableau and walk-on (marcheuse) parts. Now it became a high-status occupation, and a number of prima ballerinas made their names by dancing &quot;en travestie&quot;. Fanny Elssler and her sister both played travesty parts. The most well known travesty dancer was Eugénie Fiocre, who was the first dancer to play Frantz in &quot;Coppélia&quot;, as well as a number of ballerina roles.

=== Femininity in the Romantic Era ===
The ballets of the Romantic era were largely written and choreographed by men, thus the role of women in these ballets is largely reflective of the Romantic view and status of women in general. Emphasis on the sensuality and innocence of women through the roles of supernatural and weightless characters revealed the desire of men to both protect and exploit the opposite sex. The role of the female enchanter was a staple of the romantic era and it greatly outnumbered the roles of male enchanters in ballets. The Romantic age was consumed with beauty and the mysterious dichotomy of the sexual and spiritual facets of femininity. Despite the growing importance of females in ballet, women benefitted little socially, as the era was still defined by widely accepted patriarchal notions.  As a result of the idealized women presented on stage and the men in the plots willing to die for them, young dancers often found themselves to be exploited by men in society who wished to preserve the idea of femininity they were presented through romantic storylines.

==Design and scenography==

===Romantic tutu===

The costume for the Romantic ballerina was the romantic tutu. This was a full, white, multi-layered skirt made of tulle. The ballerina wore a white bodice with the tutu. In the second acts of Romantic ballets, representing the spiritual realm, the &quot;corps de ballet&quot; appeared on stage in Romantic tutus, giving rise to the term &quot;white act&quot; or ballet-blanc. The inclusion of gas lights and the romantic tutu in romantic ballets resulted in a sense of eeriness among theatergoers of the era due to the revelation of the dancer&#x27;s silhouetted legs through the thin fabric. Prior to the 19th century tulle was hand woven, meaning the creation of each costume was time-consuming and costly. The invention of the bobbinet machine in 1808 streamlined the production of tulle, allowing for larger scale production of the romantic costumes that construct the era&#x27;s signature look.

The end of the Romantic era saw a shift in the shape of tutu from the bell shaped full skirt of the romantic tutu to the short and stiff skirt that characterized the classical tutu. The shortening of the tutu came as a direct result of the increasing intricacy and difficulty of ballet steps. By the 1870s, the length of tutu had changed from mid-calf to above the dancer&#x27;s knee. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Swan Lake&quot; in the late 1870s debuted an even shorter tutu, built with hoops and 10 layers of netting to maintain its flat, wide shape. The classical tutu soon became the most well known shape of skirt, used by prima ballerinas to show off their skill and strength.

=== Pointe shoes ===
The Romantic era marks the first time that dancers began to incorporate pointe work into their classwork and performances beyond the elementary poses and tricks meant to dazzle the eyes of an audience. Pointe shoes were initially implemented to give the effect of the dancer floating. The first use of pointe shoes in performance is attributed to Marie Taglioni in La Sylphide. Contrary to the hard shank and box of modern pointe shoes, Taglioni&#x27;s pointe shoes were the typical ballet shoes of the era with extra darning around the side and tips of the shoes to create extra padding for her toes. Due to the lack of support in the shoes, ballerina&#x27;s could not remain on pointe for long periods of time.

=== Technique ===
Ballet Technique from the Baroque era to the Romantic era is represented by a fluid shift in movement, with steps from the Baroque era being both lost and reimagined. The era saw pointe work become increasingly prevalent in class work, though the technique was not deemed to be particularly revolutionary. Records of classwork from the era refer to pointe work in a casual manner, indicating that pointe work was believed to be a natural extension of past ballet technique rather than a new phenomenon. With the introduction of pointe work into classes came an increased emphasis on strengthening of the feet for both male and female dancers. Exercises such as coupes were first taught during this era to prepare dancers for the strength needed to dance on unblocked pointe shoes. These exercises have since evolved alongside modern technique and taken on new meanings.

===Special effects===

Romantic ballet owed much to the new developments in theatre effects, particularly gas lighting. Candles had been previously used to light theatres, but gas lighting allowed for dimming effects and other subtleties. Combined with the effects of the Romantic tutu, ballerinas posing &quot;en pointe&quot;, and the use of wires to make dancers &quot;fly,&quot; directors used gas lighting to create supernatural spectacles on stage.

<text>Permanent TSB Group Holdings plc, formerly Irish Life and Permanent plc is a provider of personal financial services in Ireland. Irish Life Assurance plc and the Irish Permanent Building Society merged to form the Irish Life and Permanent Group in 1999 and the merged entity acquired the Trustee Savings Bank in 2001. The group has no connection to the UK&#x27;s TSB Bank.

==History==
The bank is historically derived from three different companies:
* Irish Life Assurance
* Irish Permanent Building Society 
* Trustee Savings Bank (no relation to the British bank of the same name)

Irish Life Assurance plc (founded 1939) and the Irish Permanent Building Society (founded 1884) merged to form the Irish Life and Permanent Group in 1999 and the merged entity acquired the Trustee Savings Bank (founded 1816) in 2001.

===Irish Life Assurance===
Irish Life was a life assurance company created in 1939 with state assistance and concentrated on life assurance and investment products.

* The City of Dublin Assurance Company
* the Irish Life and General Assurance Company
* the Irish National Assurance Company
* the Munster and Leinster Assurance Company
were amalgamated.

Later some British companies shed their Irish operations, and merged them into this new company. They were:

* the Prudential
* the Britannic
* the Liverpool Victoria Friendly Society
* the Pearl
* the Refuge

Shares in the business were sold to the public in July 1991. In 1965 Irish Life entered the UK market and competed against its former parent, initially under its own name.

In 1999, Irish Life Assurance plc and the Irish Permanent Building Society merged to form the Irish Life and Permanent Group. In March 2012, Irish Life Assurance was sold to the Irish State for €1.3 billion as part of a bank recapitalisation programme following the Irish financial crisis.

===Irish Permanent Building Society===
Permanent TSB, previously the Irish Permanent Building Society, was founded as The Irish Temperance Permanent Benefit Building Society which was founded in 1884. In 1940 under new managing director Edmund Farrell its name was changed to Irish Permanent Building Society. Farrell, and later his son, Edmund Farrell Jnr managed the building society until about 1990.

In 1992 Irish Permanent Finance, specialising in auto finance, was established. In 1992 branch operations were opened in London and Belfast. In 1992 a Banking subsidiary established in the Isle of Man.

In 1994 the Irish private banking operation of Guinness &amp; Mahon was acquired. In 1996 Capital Home Loans, a UK mortgage lender, was acquired.

It was a mutual organisation, jointly owned by those saving and borrowing. It demutualised to form a plc on 21 September 1994. Irish Permanent was a predominantly personal banking and mortgage company.

In 1999, Irish Life Assurance plc and the Irish Permanent Building Society merged to form the Irish Life and Permanent Group.

===Trustee Savings Bank===
The origins of the TSB Bank date back to 1816 when the first Irish Savings Bank was established in Waterford. Shortly afterwards, savings banks were established in Cork, Dublin, Monaghan and Limerick.

The Dublin and Monaghan banks merged in 1977, followed by the amalgamation of the Cork and Limerick banks in 1986.

In 1988, Waterford was incorporated into the Dublin bank and finally, in 1992, Cork and Limerick Savings Bank amalgamated with Trustee Savings Bank Dublin, to form TSB Bank. It was purchased by Irish Life and Permanent from the Government of Ireland in 2001.

===Permanent TSB===

In 2001, Irish Life and Permanent Group acquired the Irish Trustee Savings Bank from the Government of Ireland, and rebranded as Permanent TSB.

During the Irish banking crisis the group was split. The profitable Irish Life Group was purchased by the government for €1.3 billion, and subsequently sold to Great-west Lifeco in July 2013. The bank received a further €2.7 billion of capital from the Irish State, bringing it into majority state ownership.

The bank has over one million customers in Ireland. The chief executive of Permanent TSB is Eamonn Crowley, who succeeded Jeremy Masding in that capacity in June 2020.

In March 2011 during the Irish banking crisis the bank was said to be in need of an external €4.0 billion bailout.

In February 2011 SEB (Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB) acquired Irish Life International Ltd (ILI), so it now operates under the corporate name Life International Assurance Company Limited.

On 19 February 2013, Great-West Lifeco of Canada announced its acquisition of the Irish Life Group for €1.3 billion. This was disputed by the shareholders. The Supreme Court rejecting the shareholders&#x27; application to delay the sale, pending the hearing of their challenge of the sale. This was heard on 21 January 2014, and concluded on 13 February 2014. Judgement was reserved and on 15 August 2014 the case was referred to Europe.

In October 2016, the US bank Cerberus Capital Management bought the UK loan book.

In July 2022, Permanent TSB received approval to acquire a €7.6 billion Ulster Bank loan book by the Competition &amp; Consumer Protection Commission, along with 25 branch properties. Former competitor, Ulster Bank had announced its withdrawal of services from the Republic of Ireland in February 2021.

In June 2023, the Irish Government and NatWest Group each sold 5% stakes in the bank leaving them with 57.4% and 11.7% share respectively.

In October 2023, Permanent TSB launched an overhaul of its brand and business, rebranding to PTSB, following its acquisition of a large portion of Ulster Bank which was withdrawing from the Republic of Ireland.

<text>Aura (EOS CH-1) is a multi-national NASA scientific research satellite in orbit around the Earth, studying the Earth&#x27;s ozone layer, air quality and climate. It is the third major component of the Earth Observing System (EOS) following on Terra (launched 1999) and Aqua (launched 2002). Aura follows on from the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS). Aura is a joint mission between NASA, the Netherlands, Finland, and the U.K. The Aura spacecraft is healthy and is expected to operate until at least 2023, likely beyond.

The name &quot;Aura&quot; comes from the Latin word for air. The satellite was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base on July 15, 2004, aboard a Delta II 7920-10L rocket.

The Aura spacecraft has a mass of about . The body is long with the extended single solar panel about long.

Aura flies in a Sun-synchronous orbit, in formation with three other satellites, collectively known as the &quot;A Train&quot;; it is last in the formation. The other satellites in the formation are:
* OCO-2
* GCOM-W1
* Aqua

All satellites have an equatorial crossing time at about 1:30 in the afternoon, thus the name &#x27;A (Afternoon) Train&#x27;.

==Mission==
As of 2015, there had been 1589 Aura-related journal articles. The scientific findings of these studies address key NASA research objectives related to stratospheric composition, air quality, and climate change.

Aura has suffered some minor, non-mission ending anomalies.

On January 12, 2005, a solar array connector partially &quot;unzipped&quot; losing temperature telemetry and power from part of the solar array. On March 12, 2010, Aura lost power from one-half of one of the 11 solar panels and this was attributed to a Micrometeoroid Orbital Debris (MMOD) strike. These events, and 9 other anomalies in the array regulation electronics (ARE), have resulted in an estimated loss of 33 out of 132 solar strings. Nonetheless, the mission is estimated to have ample power capabilities to supply the mission until fuel runs out.

A Formatter Multiplexer Unit (FMU) / Solid State Recorder (SSR) anomaly was first detected in December 2007. New symptoms were detected in January 2017 and starting on March 21, 2017, Aura no longer recorded housekeeping data to partition 31.

In December 2016, reaction wheel #3 spun down. It was recovered 10 days later.

On January 31, 2018, the TES instrument was decommissioned due to degrading operations. A mechanical arm on the instrument began stalling intermittently in 2010, affecting TES&#x27;s ability to collect data continuously. Despite the adaptations of TES operators, the degradation got worse with time and in 2017 the instrument lost operations for approximately half the year. It will continue to receive enough power to keep it from getting too cold which could affect the two remaining functioning instruments.

As of 2020, the expected constellation exit date is December 2023. An extended mission, below the A-train could push decommissioning back to late 2025 or as far as 2036. Predicted re-entry would be 2048.

==Instruments==
Aura carries four instruments for studies of atmospheric chemistry:
*HIRDLS — High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder — measures infrared radiation from ozone, water vapor, CFCs, methane and nitrogen compounds. Developed jointly with the United Kingdom Natural Environment Research Council. HIRDLS capabilities were compromised at launch when a piece of Kapton film in the instrument came loose and blocked much of the aperture, allowing only a partial view. The blockage prevented certain types of observations and necessitated the development of algorithms to remove the effects due to the blockage. This unanticipated algorithm developmental effort delayed data delivery. The HIRDLS chopper motor stalled on March 17, 2008, and HIRDLS has not produced science since.
*MLS — Microwave Limb Sounder — measures emissions from ozone, chlorine and other trace gases, and helps to clarify the role of water vapor in global warming. The MLS instrument package is divided into the THz, GHz, and spectrometer modules. The THz module was developed to measure the OH radical in the stratosphere and mesosphere using heterodyne detection of thermal emission. These modules observe emissions across 20 bands. In February 2006, band 13, the primary MLS band for measuring HCl, began to exhibit symptoms of aging and was deactivated to conserve life. It now only makes periodic observations. On August 6, 2013, band 12, which measures N2O, shut down.
*OMI — Ozone Monitoring Instrument — uses ultraviolet and visible radiation to produce daily high-resolution maps. Developed by the Finnish Meteorological Institute and the Netherlands Agency for Aerospace Programmes. In 2007, OMI began to experience a &quot;row anomaly&quot; which affected the quality of the radiance data. The row anomaly has continued to progress since then, with periods of stability.
*TES — Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer — measured tropospheric ozone in infrared wavelengths, also carbon monoxide, methane and nitrogen oxides. TES&#x27;s laser A, which was used for retrieving interferometer control, began operating below peak in 2007 but was resurrected to replace laser B which ceased operation in August 2016. Laser A then operated at only 10% power. In 2011, TES observations were shifted from global survey mode, in which it made continuous observations, to special operations mode, wherein it made high sample density observations over specific targets. Furthermore, the TES Interferometer Control System (ICS) motor began stalling in 2015. Each stall took days or weeks to recover from and as of 2018 there had been 19 of them. As a result, in early 2018 the instrument was decommissioned.

<text>Systrace is a computer security utility which limits an application&#x27;s access to the system by enforcing access policies for system calls. This can mitigate the effects of buffer overflows and other security vulnerabilities. It was developed by Niels Provos and runs on various Unix-like operating systems.

Systrace is particularly useful when running untrusted or binary-only applications and provides facilities for privilege elevation on a system call basis, helping to eliminate the need for potentially dangerous setuid programs. It also includes interactive and automatic policy generation features, to assist in the creation of a base policy for an application.

Systrace used to be integrated into OpenBSD, but was removed in April 2016 (in favour of &quot;pledge&quot; post OpenBSD 5.9). It is available for Linux and Mac OS X, although the OS X port is currently unmaintained. It was removed from NetBSD at the end of 2007 due to several unfixed implementation issues. As of version 1.6f Systrace supports 64-bit Linux 2.6.1 via kernel patch.

==Features==
Systrace supports the following features:
* Confines untrusted binary applications: An application is allowed to make only those system calls specified as permitted in the policy. If the application attempts to execute a system call that is not explicitly permitted, an alarm gets raised.
* Interactive policy generation with graphical user interface: Policies can be generated interactively via a graphical frontend to Systrace. The frontend shows system calls and their parameters not currently covered by policy and allows the user to refine the policy until it works as expected.
* Supports different emulations: Linux, BSDI, etc..
* Non-interactive policy enforcement: Once a policy has been trained, automatic policy enforcement can be used to deny all system calls not covered by the current policy. All violations are logged to Syslog. This mode is useful when protecting system services like a web server.
* Remote monitoring and intrusion detection: Systrace supports multiple frontends by using a frontend that makes use of the network, very advanced features are possible.
* Privilege elevation: Using Systrace&#x27;s privilege elevation mode, it&#x27;s possible to get rid of setuid binaries. A special policy statement allows selected system calls to run with higher privileges, for example, creating a raw socket.

==Vulnerability history==
Systrace has had some vulnerabilities in the past, including:
* Exploiting Concurrency Vulnerabilities in System Call Wrappers Paper by Robert Watson from the First USENIX Workshop On Offensive Technologies (WOOT07) analyzing system call wrapper traces across several wrapper platforms including systrace
* Google Security discovers local privilege escalation in Systrace
* Local root exploit on NetBSD
* Vulnerabilities in systrace

<doc id="827966" wikidata="Q6757885" url="?curid=827966" title="Marcos Mantis">
<text>The Marcos Mantis M70 is a British (2+2) sports car introduced in 1970 by Marcos Engineering, powered by the same Triumph 2.5 litre 6-cylinder engine used in the Triumph TR6 and by TVR. In February 1971, Marcos announced that the car could also be purchased in component form, at a domestic market price of £425, compared to the recommended retail price of £3,185 for the factory-built version. For comparison, a sporty luxury saloon such as the V8 Rover 3500 would have cost £2,150 including sales taxes. With Marcos encountering financial problems and closing down later in 1971, only 32 examples of the Mantis were produced, although &quot;Motor&quot; magazine reported that there were another 35 unsold cars in the United States, and possibly other unsold vehicles elsewhere.

Following the closure of Marcos, Autotune UK acquired the moulds and produced a few more car kits in the mid-1980s, marketing them as &quot;Autotune Mirages&quot;.

The Marcos brand was resurrected in 1981, but the Mantis name only appeared again much later in 1997, as a totally new 2-seater vehicle with a 4.6 litre engine. Boasting exceptional performance figures, this was further boosted in 1998 with the Mantis GT adding a supercharger, bringing power output beyond 500bhp. Production of this new version of the Mantis was 51 road-legal cars, with 16 being the supercharged GT version. There were also an additional 38 Mantis Challenge race cars.

In 1995 Dutch racing driver Cor Euser became the factory driver for Marcos, and in 2000, the Marcos racing business was sold to long time GT sponsor Eurotech, a Dutch engineering firm. By that time, all Marcos racing cars and road car chassis were built in the Netherlands. Cor Euser competed as Marcos Racing International, racing various Marcos derived models including a GT-3 spec Mantis, and a further development of the Mantis, the Marcos Mantis Marcorelly.

==Technical details==
Announced as being officially released for sale in the United Kingdom during October 1970, as a luxurious 2+2, the Mantis M70 boasted a top speed of . The suspension consisted of coil springs on all of the four wheel assemblies, as well as a live rear axle suspension with trailing links and an “A” bracket. The Mantis was expected to be marketed to the “younger English executive market” at a price of A$6,500. 

With a length of and a height of , these dimensions made it a lengthy car but also one of the lowest coupes on the English market at that time. 
The Mantis /ˈmæn.tɪs/ name has been used subsequently for models bearing little similarity to the original model. Introduced in 1997, the Mantis GT is a higher performance version of the Mantis, due to progression in technology. The name Mantis is taken from the mantis insect and is intended to signify the performance of the Mantis&#x27; engine, a supercharged 4.6 litre V8, producing , and of torque. This allows the Mantis to accelerate from in 3.7 seconds and to reach a top speed of . The car features power-assisted rack and pinion steering. It is equipped with AP Vented disc brakes with a diameter of in the front and in the rear.

===Surviving examples===
Mantis M70 - There are around 6-7 examples still appearing at various events worldwide; one is Canadian-registered, four or five UK-registered, plus one AutoTune Mirage (last seen in lilac/silver). It is impossible to say exactly how many of these are in full on-the-road running order, and how many arrive on the back of a low-loader.

<text>James Earl Duffy Jr. (born June 4, 1942) is a retired associate justice of the Hawaii State Supreme Court. He served on the court from 2003 to 2013. He also is a former federal judicial nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

== Early life and education ==
Born in St. Paul, Minnesota, Duffy graduated from Cretin High School in Saint Paul, Minnesota, Duffy earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the College of St. Thomas in 1965. He then went on to Marquette University to obtain his doctorate of jurisprudence in 1968.

== Professional career ==
Duffy began his legal career in 1968 at the law firm Cobb &amp; Gould where he became an associate. He joined the law firm Chuck &amp; Fujiyama in Honolulu, Hawaii as an associate. In 1975, Duffy became a senior partner and the firm was renamed Fujiyama, Duffy &amp; Fujiyama. Duffy retired from Fujiyama, Duffy &amp; Fujiyama in 2000 and worked as a mediator from 2000 until his appointment to the Hawaii State Supreme Court in 2003.

==Unsuccessful nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit==
On June 17, 1999, President Bill Clinton nominated Duffy to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to replace Judge Cynthia Holcomb Hall, who had taken senior status on August 31, 1997. Although Duffy had the support of both of Hawaii&#x27;s U.S. senators at the time, his nomination languished in the Republican-led Senate, which declined to hold a U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing or vote on his nomination.

In a quixotic move, Clinton renominated Duffy and several other appeals-court nominees on January 3, 2001. President George W. Bush on March 20, 2001, withdrew Duffy&#x27;s nomination, along with those of 62 other executive and judicial nominees, choosing not to renominate Duffy.

Later in 2001, Bush nominated Richard R. Clifton of Hawaii for the seat to which Duffy had been nominated, and Clifton was confirmed in a 98–0 vote of the U.S. Senate on July 30, 2002.

== Nomination to and service on the Hawaii State Supreme Court ==
In 2003, Hawaii Governor Linda Lingle appointed Duffy from his private practice to the five-member Hawaii State Supreme Court. Though appointed by a governor from the Hawaii Republican Party, Duffy is a member of the Hawaii Democratic Party.

&quot;Hawaii has been very good to me, both personally and professionally, and this is my opportunity to pay back some of the good things that have been done for me in the practice of law and personally,&quot; Duffy said at a news conference while standing next to Lingle, according to an April 15, 2003 Associated Press article.

<doc id="827981" wikidata="Q275138" url="?curid=827981" title="FC Haka">
<text>FC Haka, originally &quot;Valkeakosken Haka&quot;, commonly known as Haka, is a Finnish professional football club based in the industrial town of Valkeakoski. The club was founded in 1934 and competes in Finland&#x27;s premier division, the Veikkausliiga. It is one of the most successful clubs in Finland, with nine Finnish championships and 12 Finnish Cup wins.

==History==
Haka has historically had close ties with the paper industry in the Valkeakoski area, and is still sponsored by UPM Kymmene.

The club was founded as &quot;Valkeakosken Haka&quot; in 1934, with significant support from paper entrepreneur Juuso Walden. In 1949 it was promoted to Finland&#x27;s top division &quot;Mestaruussarja&quot; (now known as Veikkausliiga), and in 1955 won the inaugural Finnish Cup.

The 1960s was the most successful era in Haka&#x27;s history, with the club winning both the league and cup three times, including the first double in Finnish football history in 1960. The club was relegated in 1972, but came straight back, and won the double again in 1977.

The club&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;FC Haka&quot; in the early 1990s. Haka won the title again 1995, but was relegated the next season. Keith Armstrong was hired as the new coach, and the club came straight back again, winning three straight championships from 1998 to 2000. Goalkeeping legend Olli Huttunen succeeded Armstrong as coach in 2002, and led the club to the championship (2004) and two cups (2002 and 2005).

Haka&#x27;s best performance in UEFA competition was in the 1983–1984 season when they reached the quarterfinals of the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, losing to eventual champions Juventus 0–2 on aggregate. The club was involved in European competition every year between 1998 and the 2008–2009 season.

In subsequent years the club&#x27;s financial situation deteriorated on two occasions, like many other small market teams in Veikkausliiga. The first was the 2008–09 season when a group of investors led by local businessman and restaurateur Sedu Koskinen (owner and founder of a nationwide night-club chain) formed FC Haka Oy to help an essentially bankrupt team to finish the season. In 2010 Sedu Koskinen left, after having invested around €1 million of his own money in the club.

Since then the club&#x27;s operations have been reformed to make it financially sounder. The team, having been one of the most successful and prestigious in Finland, ran at a loss for several years during the 2000s. At the same time the overall global economic situation and sponsorship payments from UPM Kymmene diminished. This forced the club to rationalize its operations and adopt a new role as one of the smaller clubs in Finnish top flight football. The situation at the start of 2012 Finnish football season was described by the chairman and board members as difficult but stable.

These times of financial struggles saw the club move from perennial championship challengers to a team usually poised for relegation. In both 2011 and 2012 pre-season media predictions placed the club in the bottom three. Haka finished last in the standings in 2012 and were relegated to the second tier (then known as &quot;Ykkönen&quot;, but rebranded in 2023 as &quot;Ykkösliiga&quot;). The club finally won promotion back to the Veikkausliiga for the 2020 season following a near perfect campaign in the 2019 Ykkönen, where they dropped only 7 points and finished 19 points ahead of second-place TPS.

<text>The Edge Chronicles is a children&#x27;s fantasy novel series written by Paul Stewart and illustrated by Chris Riddell. It consists of four trilogies, plus four additional books, and other books related to the universe (The Edge). The series was originally published by Doubleday, a subsidiary of Penguin Random House, and has sold more than three million copies, according to its publisher.

The stories of &quot;The Edge Chronicles&quot; take place in the fictional world of The Edge, a vast cliff with no apparent bottom. The majority of books are grouped into sagas, with each saga focusing on one character. The power of flight is a major theme of the books, with each age defined by the current technology used for air travel. In the first age, floating rocks were used to stay airborne, then floating wood was used, and finally phrax-power. The series is notable for its flora and fauna, along with the maps of various locations in The Edge.

The first three trilogies were released over the course of 1998 to 2006, with a standalone saga serving as a conclusion to the first two ages of flight and a beginning to the third released in 2009. The series was planned to end after the tenth book, with the author&#x27;s blog, Weird New Worlds serving as the continuous adventures with weekly &#x27;chapter&#x27; installments. After the completion of the 66 chapters of the blog, the authors decided to revisit the series with the fourth trilogy which would adapt the characters and stories from the blog, with the first and second books released in 2014 and 2015 respectively. The series also includes a number of short stories, along with a companion book.

<doc id="827991" wikidata="Q194881" url="?curid=827991" title="Howard Hesseman">
<text>Howard Hesseman (February 27, 1940 – January 29, 2022) was an American actor known for his television roles as burned-out disc jockey Dr. Johnny Fever on &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; and the lead role of history teacher Charlie Moore on &quot;Head of the Class&quot;. He appeared regularly on television and in film from the 1970s to 2010s, with his other noteworthy roles including Sam Royer (the husband of lead character Ann Romano) in the last two seasons of &quot;One Day at a Time&quot; and a supporting role as Captain Pete Lassard in the film &quot;Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment.&quot;

==Early life==
Hesseman was born in Lebanon, Oregon, on February 27, 1940. His parents divorced when he was five, and he was raised by his mother and stepfather, a police officer. He graduated from Silverton High School in 1958. Hesseman attended the University of Oregon, and was later a founding member of the San Francisco-based improvisational comedy troupe The Committee with fellow actor David Ogden Stiers. Early in his acting career, he used the alias Don Sturdy, the name he also used as a radio DJ on underground FM station KMPX in San Francisco in the late 1960s.

==Career==
Under the alias of Don Sturdy, Hesseman made his first television appearances, including the episode &quot;Public Affairs: DR-07&quot; of the show &quot;Dragnet&quot; in 1968. He portrayed a hippie named Jesse Chaplin, the editor of an underground newspaper. In this &quot;Dragnet&quot; episode, his character was a panelist on a TV show opposite Sgt. Friday and Officer Gannon.

He played a bit part in two final-season episodes of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;. In the episode &quot;Sam for Town Council&quot;, Hesseman played a character named Harry has an exchange with Emmett Clark (Paul Hartman), who is running for town council against Sam Jones, played by Ken Berry. Harry complains to Emmett how poor the fishing has been at a nearby fishing spot. Emmett promises to stock the pond with big perch in exchange for Harry&#x27;s vote. Harry agrees and wears a campaign button supporting Emmett in the race. In the episode &quot;Goober Goes to an Auto Show&quot;, Hesseman, also credited as Don Sturdy, played the counter boy, serving hot dogs and root beers to Goober and his old trade-school rival Roy Swanson, played by Noam Pitlik.

On July 18, 1969, he appeared with the improvisational comedy group The Committee in several sketches on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;, including one with guest Janis Joplin. Hesseman also appeared in a number of skits as part of The Committee in the 1971 classic film &quot;Billy Jack&quot;.

Hesseman made several appearances as Mr. Plager, a member of the group therapy ensemble on &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;; Mr. Plager eventually came out as gay. Hesseman became a playwright in the sixth season of the show, writing a play about the characters in the group. In several other episodes of &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;, Hesseman&#x27;s voice can be heard as a TV announcer.
Hesseman is best known for his role as DJ John &quot;Dr. Johnny Fever&quot; Caravella on the television sitcom &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; from 1978 to 1982, a role Hesseman prepared for by working as a DJ in San Francisco at KMPX-FM for several months. He was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 1980 and 1981 for his portrayal of Fever. He reprised the role in nine episodes of &quot;The New WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;, and also directed several episodes of the 1991-93 series revival. 

He portrayed Sam Royer, the man who married Ann Romano (Bonnie Franklin) on the sitcom &quot;One Day at a Time&quot; from 1982 to 1984.

In 1986, he appeared in the Disney film &quot;Flight of the Navigator&quot; as NASA research facility scientist Dr. Louis Faraday.

Hesseman played teacher Charlie Moore on the ABC series &quot;Head of the Class&quot; for four seasons from 1986 to 1990. 

In 1994, Hesseman introduced lost footage of Janis Joplin in a documentary on Woodstock. He made three appearances on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, one in which he paid tribute to, and told jokes about, the recently deceased John Belushi and the other in which NBC showed a picture of U.S. President Ronald Reagan, which Hesseman mooned off-camera. He also encouraged the viewing audience to moon the picture and send pictures in to NBC. In 1995, Hesseman played the role of the Marquis de Sade in &quot;Quills&quot; at the Geffen Playhouse in Westwood, California, which included one scene in which he was fully naked. In 2001, Hesseman had a role on three episodes of &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;. 

In 2006, he played the unorthodox Judge Robert Thompson in three episodes of &quot;Boston Legal&quot;, and also appeared in an episode of &quot;House&quot;. During his appearance as Judge Thompson, Hesseman paid &quot;homage&quot; to his role as a teacher in his earlier ABC series by hearing a court case while sitting atop the judge&#x27;s bench, just as the character of Mr. Moore taught his class atop his desk. In 2007, he played The Chemist on HBO&#x27;s &quot;John From Cincinnati&quot;. He guest-starred as an announcer at a horse track on &quot;Psych&quot;, in the episode &quot;And Down the Stretch Comes Murder.” Hesseman guest-starred on the 2007 season premiere of NBC&#x27;s &quot;ER&quot;, playing a man tripping on magic mushrooms who may or may not have been an orthopedist from another hospital. Hesseman starred in &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot; at the New Theatre Restaurant in Overland Park, Kansas, from September to November 2010. In February 2011, he portrayed Dr. Elliot D. Aden in the 11th-season &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Turn On, Tune In, Drop Dead.” Dr. Aden was head of Department of Defense project called Stonewall at WLVU, which did research in fringe psychological concepts such as extrasensory perception and out-of-body experiences.

==Personal life and death==
Hesseman was married to Cаtherine Mаison from 1965 until 1974. He was later married for 33 years to actress Caroline Ducrocq. He died from complications of colorectal surgery in Los Angeles, California, on January 29, 2022, at age 81.

<text>Philo Vance is a fictional amateur detective originally featured in 12 crime novels by S. S. Van Dine in the 1920s and 1930s. During that time, Vance was immensely popular in books, films, and radio. He was portrayed as a stylish—even foppish—dandy, a New York &quot;bon vivant&quot; possessing a highly intellectual bent. &quot;S. S. Van Dine&quot; was the pen name of Willard Huntington Wright, a prominent art critic who initially sought to conceal his authorship of the novels. Van Dine was also a fictional character in the books, a sort of Dr. Watson figure who accompanied Vance and chronicled his exploits.

==Character==

In the early novels, Van Dine claimed that &quot;Philo Vance&quot; was an alias, and that details of the sleuth&#x27;s adventures had been altered to protect his true identity, even if &quot;he has now gone to Italy to live&quot;. This claim was conveniently forgotten as the series progressed. (A few years later, the same process occurred with another fictional detective, Ellery Queen, whose authors acknowledged being inspired by Van Dine.)

As Van Dine described the character of Vance in the first of the novels, &quot;The Benson Murder Case&quot;:

Vance was what many would call a dilettante, but the designation does him an injustice. He was a man of unusual culture and brilliance. An aristocrat by birth and instinct, he held himself severely aloof from the common world of men. In his manner there was an indefinable contempt for inferiority of all kinds. The great majority of those with whom he came in contact regarded him as a snob. Yet there was in his condescension and disdain no trace of spuriousness. His snobbishness was intellectual as well as social. He detested stupidity even more, I believe, than he did vulgarity or bad taste. I have heard him on several occasions quote Fouché’s famous line: &quot;C’est plus qu’un crime; c&#x27;est une faute&quot;. And he meant it literally.

Vance was frankly a cynic, but he was rarely bitter; his was a flippant, Juvenalian cynicism. Perhaps he may best be described as a bored and supercilious, but highly conscious and penetrating, spectator of life. He was keenly interested in all human reactions; but it was the interest of the scientist, not the humanitarian.

Vance’s knowledge of psychology was indeed uncanny. He was gifted with an instinctively accurate judgement of people, and his study and reading had coordinated and rationalized this gift to an amazing extent. He was well grounded in the academic principles of psychology, and all his courses at college had either centered about this subject or been subordinated to it…

He had reconnoitered the whole field of cultural endeavor. He had courses in the history of religions, the Greek classics, biology, civics, and political economy, philosophy, anthropology, literature, theoretical, and experimental psychology, and ancient and modern languages. But it was, I think, his courses under Münsterberg and William James that interested him the most.

Vance’s mind was basically philosophical—that is, philosophical in the more general sense. Being singularly free from the conventional sentimentalities and current superstitions, he could look beneath the surface of human acts into actuating impulses and motives. Moreover, he was resolute both in his avoidance of any attitude that savoured of credulousness and in his adherence to cold, logical exactness in his mental processes.

In the same book, Van Dine detailed Vance&#x27;s physical features:
He was unusually good-looking, although his mouth was ascetic and cruel...there was a slightly derisive hauteur in the lift of his eyebrows...His forehead was full and sloping—it was the artist&#x27;s, rather than the scholar&#x27;s, brow. His cold grey eyes were widely spaced. His nose was straight and slender, and his chin narrow but prominent, with an unusually deep cleft...Vance was slightly under six feet, graceful, and giving the impression of sinewy strength and nervous endurance.
In the second adventure, &quot;The Canary Murder Case&quot; (set in 1927), Van Dine says that Vance was &quot;not yet thirty-five... His face was slender and mobile; but there was a stern, sardonic expression to his features, which acted as a barrier between him and his fellows.&quot;

Vance was highly skilled at many things: an &quot;expert fencer&quot;, a golfer with a three handicap, a breeder and shower of thoroughbred dogs, a talented polo player, a master poker player, a winning handicapper of race horses, experience in archery (&quot;a bit of potting at Oxford,&quot; as he referred to it), a patron of classical music, a connoisseur of fine food and drink, knowledgeable of chess, and of several foreign languages. He was also an expert on Chinese ceramics, psychology, the history of crime, ancient Egypt, Renaissance art, and a host of other recondite subjects. In &quot;The Kidnap Murder Case&quot;, in which Vance uses a gun, Van Dine describes Vance as a good marksman and a decorated World War I veteran.

Van Dine says Vance&#x27;s &quot;one passion&quot; is art. &quot;He was something of an authority on Japanese and Chinese prints; he knew tapestries and ceramics: and once I heard him give an impromptu &quot;causerie&quot; to a few guests on Tanagra figurines...&quot; (&quot;The Benson Murder Case&quot;)

His interest in dogs is featured in &quot;The Kennel Murder Case&quot; (his polo playing is also mentioned in that case), his skill at poker in &quot;The Canary Murder Case&quot;, his ability to handicap race horses in &quot;The Garden Murder Case&quot;, his knowledge of chess and archery in &quot;The Bishop Murder Case&quot;, and of Egyptology in &quot;The Scarab Murder Case&quot;. His skills at golf and at fencing do not figure in any of the cases.

Vance often wore a monocle, dressed impeccably (usually going out with chamois gloves), and his speech frequently tended to be quaint:

* &quot;Why the haste, old dear?&quot; Vance asked, yawning. &quot;The chap&#x27;s, dead, don&#x27;t y&#x27; know; he can&#x27;t possibly run away.&quot; (&quot;The Benson Murder Case&quot;)
* &quot;Really, y&#x27; know, Markham, old thing, &quot; he added, &quot;you should study the cranial indications of your fellow man more carefully—vultus est index animi...&quot; (&quot;The Canary Murder Case&quot;)
* &quot;And now I think I&#x27;ll erase the Greenes from my mind pro tempore, and dip into the &#x27;Satyricon.&#x27; The fusty historians pother frightfully about the reasons for the fall of Rome...&quot; (&quot;The Greene Murder Case&quot;)

He was also a heavy smoker, lighting up and puffing on his Regies throughout the stories.

According to some contemporary critics, these mannerisms of Vance were affectations, which made him look like a foppish dandy, a poseur. (See below for criticisms.) There is some indication that Van Dine wished the reader to question Vance&#x27;s sexuality. In &quot;The Benson Murder Case&quot;, Vance is called a &quot;sissy&quot; by another character, and early in the book, as he is dressing, his friend Markham asks if he is planning to wear a green carnation, the symbol of homosexuality during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

==Publication==
Van Dine&#x27;s first three mystery novels were unusual for mystery fiction because he planned them as a trilogy, but plotted and wrote them in short form, more or less at the same time. After they were accepted as a group by famed editor Maxwell Perkins, Van Dine expanded them into full-length novels. All 12 book titles are in the form &quot;The X Murder Case,&quot; where &quot;X&quot; is always a six-letter word (except for &quot;The Gracie Allen Murder Case&quot;, which was originally just &quot;Gracie&quot;).

Although Van Dine was one of the most educated and cosmopolitan detective writers of his time, in his essays he dismissed the idea of the mystery story as serious literature. He insisted that a detective novel should be mainly an intellectual puzzle that follows strict rules and does not wander too far afield from its central theme. He followed his own prescriptions, and some critics feel that formulaic approach made the Vance novels stilted and caused them to become dated in a relatively few years.

All of the cases, except &quot;The Winter Murder Case&quot;, are mostly set in the Manhattan borough of New York City. On a few occasions, Vance and Van Dine (usually accompanied by Markham and Heath) briefly travel to the Bronx, Westchester County, and New Jersey in the course of their investigations. In &quot;The Greene Murder Case&quot; Vance tells, after his arrival back in New York, that he traveled by train to New Orleans to gather information relevant to the case.

Vance&#x27;s last case, &quot;The Winter Murder Case&quot;, is markedly different from the previous 11 cases in that the locale is away from New York (the Berkshire Mountains of western Massachusetts), and Vance and Van Dine are surrounded by an almost completely different cast of characters (only Markham makes a brief appearance at the very beginning). Wright had just finished writing this case when he died suddenly in New York on April 11, 1939.

==Cast of characters==
Most of the adventures have at their beginning a &quot;Characters of the Book,&quot; much as in Shakespeare&#x27;s plays.

Vance, Van Dine, John F.-X Markham, Ernest Heath, Dr. Emanuel Doremus, and Currie all appear in 11 of the 12 stories; the last, &quot;The Winter Murder Case&quot;, includes only Vance, Van Dine, and a brief appearance of Markham at the very beginning.

*S.S. Van Dine: The fictional narrator S.S. Van Dine accompanies Vance during his investigations and later recounts them to readers. Van Dine, who reveals little about himself except that he once practiced law, says he is Vance&#x27;s chief adviser, especially on financial and legal matters. Van Dine is not like most &quot;sidekicks&quot; in mystery stories. John Loughery, the biographer of Willard Huntington Wright, describes Van Dine as a &quot;noncharacter&quot;: While other people in the novels sometimes talk to him or note his presence, he never addresses anyone (or at least does not quote anything he says to them). He also never does anything that would influence events.
*John F.-X Markham: New York County District Attorney who served only one four-year term. A bachelor, like all of the leading male characters in the stories, he lives in an apartment in lower Manhattan. Markham is a straight-arrow, no-nonsense type whose serious demeanor frequently contrasts, in friendly bantering, with Vance&#x27;s whimsical persona. Van Dine describes this contrast of personalities:

*Ernest Heath: Sergeant in the Homicide Bureau of the New York Police Department. He is gruff, lacking in imagination, prone to misuse English grammar, and also a no-nonsense type when it comes to dealing with suspects in the murder cases (he occasionally suggests to Markham that he &quot;work over&quot; some of them to extract confessions). He and Vance, although very different in most ways, gain a mutual respect for each other as they work together. He seems to sleep very little, as he is up all hours working on cases.
*Dr. Emanuel Doremus: Medical Examiner for New York City. A cocky little man who wears a bowler hat and constantly complains (in a mock manner) about being called to check out corpses just as he has sat down to a meal or is otherwise inconvenienced.
*Currie: Described in &quot;The Benson Murder Case&quot; as &quot;a rare old English servant who acted as Vance&#x27;s butler, valet, major-domo and, on occasions, specialty cook.&quot;

Other individuals who appear frequently include Francis Swacker, Markham&#x27;s male secretary, and Guilfoyle, Hennessey, Snitkin, and Burke, all detectives under Heath in the Homicide Bureau.

==Criticisms of Vance and the novels==
At the height of Philo Vance&#x27;s popularity, comic poet Ogden Nash wrote:
Philo Vance
Needs a kick in the pance.
Famed hardboiled-detective author Raymond Chandler referred to Vance in his essay &quot;The Simple Art of Murder&quot; as &quot;the most character in detective fiction&quot;. In Chandler&#x27;s novel &quot;The Lady in the Lake&quot;, Marlowe briefly uses Philo Vance as an ironical alias. A criticism of Vance&#x27;s &quot;phony English accent&quot; also appears in Chandler&#x27;s &quot;Farewell My Lovely&quot;. In Chandler&#x27;s &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, Marlowe says he&#x27;s &quot;not Sherlock Holmes or Philo Vance&quot; and explains that his method owes more to judgement of character than finding clues the police have missed.

Julian Symons in his history of detective fiction, &quot;Bloody Murder&quot;, says: &quot;The decline in the last six Vance books is so steep that the critic who called the ninth of them one more stitch in his literary shroud was not overstating the case.&quot;

In &quot;A Catalogue of Crime&quot;, Jacques Barzun and Wendell Hertig Taylor criticize &quot;… the phony footnotes, the phony English accent of Philo Vance, and the general apathy of the detective system in all these books …&quot;, in all the Vance novels. They review only seven of the 12 novels, panning all but the first and the last: &quot;The Benson Murder Case&quot;, which they call &quot;The first and best …&quot; and &quot;The Winter Murder Case&quot;, of which they write, &quot;In fact, this short book is pleasant reading …&quot;

In regard to Vance&#x27;s supposedly phony accent, Van Dine addressed the issue early on. In &quot;The Greene Murder Case&quot;, one of the three original novels, he wrote that Vance&#x27;s seemingly British manner of speaking was the result of his long education in Europe, not an affectation. He described Vance as indifferent to what people thought of him and not interested in impressing them.

==Adaptations==

===Films===
Films about Vance were made from the late 1920s to the late 1940s, with some more faithful to the literary character than others. Fictional narrator S.S. Van Dine, who acts as a passive eyewitness to events in the novels, does not appear in the films.
Among the several actors who played Philo Vance on the screen were William Powell, Warren William and Basil Rathbone, all of whom had great success playing other detectives in movies. The movie &quot;The Canary Murder Case&quot; is famous for a contract dispute that eventually helped sink the career of star Louise Brooks. 

William Powell did not enjoy playing Philo Vance, finding the role devoid of the complexity of a truly human character. After three Philo Vance films at Paramount, he flatly refused to play the role again. Later, at Warner Brothers, he was cajoled into making &quot;The Kennel Murder Case&quot;, due to studio pressure and the lack of more interesting scripts. A few years later Powell was offered &quot;The Casino Murder Case&quot; at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer into which a part was written for Myrna Loy as Vance&#x27;s girlfriend, but Powell refused this film as well. 

On Philo Vance as a role, Powell stated: 

The Philo Vance novels were particularly well suited for films, where the more unpleasantly affected aspects of the main character could be toned down and the complex plots given more prominence. One of these films, &quot;The Kennel Murder Case&quot;, has been called a masterpiece by renowned film historian William K. Everson.

* &quot;The Canary Murder Case&quot; (1929) with William Powell
* &quot;The Greene Murder Case&quot; (1929) with William Powell
* &quot;The Bishop Murder Case&quot; (1929) with Basil Rathbone
* &quot;The Benson Murder Case&quot; (1930) with William Powell
* &quot;The Kennel Murder Case&quot; (1933) with William Powell
* &quot;The Dragon Murder Case&quot; (1934) with Warren William
* &quot;The Casino Murder Case&quot; (1935) with Paul Lukas
* &quot;The Garden Murder Case&quot; (1936) with Edmund Lowe
* &quot;The Scarab Murder Case&quot; (1936) with Wilfrid Hyde-White (lost film)
* &quot;Night of Mystery&quot; (1937) (based on &quot;The Greene Murder Case&quot;) with Grant Richards
* &quot;The Gracie Allen Murder Case&quot; (1939) with Warren William as Philo Vance, billed below Gracie Allen
* &quot;Calling Philo Vance&quot; (1940) (a remake of &quot;The Kennel Murder Case&quot; with an altered setting) with James Stephenson
* &quot;Philo Vance Returns&quot; (1947) with William Wright
* &quot;Philo Vance&#x27;s Gamble&quot; (1947) with Alan Curtis
* &quot;Philo Vance&#x27;s Secret Mission&quot; (1947) with Alan Curtis

The plots of the final three films bear no relationship to any of the novels and very little relationship to the Philo Vance character of the novels.

Philo Vance (William Powell) also appears in the &quot;Murder Will Out&quot; comic vignette of &quot;Paramount on Parade&quot; (1930), wherein Vance and Sgt. Heath (Eugene Pallette), along with fellow detective Sherlock Holmes (Clive Brook), go up against Fu Manchu (Warner Oland). Holmes and Fu Manchu were featured in their own respective series at Paramount at this time.

Vance is mentioned in &quot;The Stolen Jools&quot;, an all-star film short produced by Paramount in 1931 to promote fundraising for the National Vaudeville Artists Tuberculosis Sanitarium, but does not appear.

In the trailer for the first &quot;The Thin Man&quot; film in 1934, Powell plays both Vance and Nick Charles via split screen, as Charles tells Vance about the mystery he solves in the movie. At the time, &quot;The Thin Man&quot;&#x27;s studio, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, had not produced a Philo Vance film since 1930, and the property was at that time contracted to Warner Bros. MGM regained the rights for 1935&#x27;s &quot;The Casino Murder Case&quot;, but Powell did not appear in that film.

Vance was also mentioned in &quot;The Lady Eve&quot; (1941).

===Radio===
Three radio drama series were created with Philo Vance as the title character. The first series, broadcast by NBC in 1945, starred José Ferrer. A summer replacement series in 1946 starred John Emery as Vance. The best-known series (and the one of which most episodes survived) ran from 1948 to 1950 in Frederick Ziv syndication and starred Jackson Beck. &quot;Thankfully, the radio series uses only the name, and makes Philo a pretty normal, though very intelligent and extremely courteous gumshoe. ... Joan Alexander is Ellen Deering, Vance&#x27;s secretary and right-hand woman.” George Petrie and Humphrey Davis also co-starred as DA Markham and Sgt. Heath respectively.

===Television===

An Italian-language TV miniseries from 1974 entitled &quot;Philo Vance&quot; featured Giorgio Albertazzi as Philo Vance. The series was composed of three episodes based on the first three Van Dine novels. The scripts were very faithful to the originals.

<text>Steven Henry Levinson (born June 8, 1946, in Cincinnati, Ohio) is a former Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Hawaii. Levinson served his first term from 1992 to 2002 and was retained by the Judicial Selection Commission to serve a second ten-year term. He retired from the court, effective December 31, 2008.

== Education ==
Upon graduating from his hometown Walnut Hills High School, Levinson attended Stanford University where he obtained his bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science in 1968. He then went on to the University of Michigan where he obtained his doctorate of jurisprudence.

== Career ==
In 1971, Levinson moved to Honolulu, Hawaii to work as a law clerk for his uncle Bernard Levinson, Associate Justice of the Hawaii State Supreme Court. In 1972, he joined the law firm Schutter, Levinson and O&#x27;Brien where he worked until 1976. From 1977 to 1989, Levinson worked at the law firm Damon, Key, Bocken, Leong and Kupchak where he became an associate and then a stockholder/director. It is from his private practice that Governor John Waihee appointed Levinson in 1989 to the Hawaii State Judiciary as a circuit court judge. Confident in his abilities, the governor elevated Levinson to the Hawaii State Supreme Court in 1992. Levinson was a member of the American Civil Liberties Union while serving on the bench. Levinson is a member of the Democratic Party of Hawaii.

== &quot;Baehr v. Lewin&quot; ==

In 1993, as a Hawaii State Supreme Court Justice, Levinson wrote a notable opinion in the case of &quot;Baehr v. Lewin&quot;, 852 P.2d 44 (Haw. 1993), in which he ruled that the state of Hawaii needed to demonstrate a &quot;compelling state interest&quot; for denying marriage licenses to three same-sex couples in December 1990. He cited Article I, Section 5 of the Hawaii Constitution in stating:

&quot;No person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law, nor be denied the equal protection of the laws, nor be denied the enjoyment of the person&#x27;s civil rights or be discriminated against in the exercise thereof because of race, religion, sex or ancestry.&quot;

Although the ruling gave a push to the gay-rights movement, in 1998, Hawaii&#x27;s residents voted in favor of amending the state&#x27;s constitution to allow the legislature &quot;the power to reserve marriage to opposite-sex couples.&quot;

==Post-judicial life==
Levinson is currently a member of the Board of Directors of Hawaii United for Marriage, a coalition advocating for the legalization of same-sex marriage in the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.freedomtomarry.org/blog/entry/justice-levinson-reflects-on-why-marriage-matters-20-years-after-historic-HI-ruling&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He has been a member of the board of directors of the ACLU of Hawaii since 2009. Levinson served on the board of directors of Equality Hawaii from 2010 through 2013. He has been performing same-sex marriages in Hawaii since December 2, 2013, the effective date of Hawaii&#x27;s Marriage Equality Bill. In October 2016, Levinson was appointed to be a member of the Honolulu Police Commission by Mayor Kirk Caldwell.

<doc id="828001" wikidata="Q1030571" url="?curid=828001" title="Vortex ring">
<text>A vortex ring, also called a toroidal vortex, is a torus-shaped vortex in a fluid; that is, a region where the fluid mostly spins around an imaginary axis line that forms a closed loop. The dominant flow in a vortex ring is said to be toroidal, more precisely poloidal.

Vortex rings are plentiful in turbulent flows of liquids and gases, but are rarely noticed unless the motion of the fluid is revealed by suspended particles—as in the smoke rings which are often produced intentionally or accidentally by smokers. Fiery vortex rings are also a commonly produced trick by fire eaters. Visible vortex rings can also be formed by the firing of certain artillery, in mushroom clouds, in microbursts, and rarely in volcanic eruptions.

A vortex ring usually tends to move in a direction that is perpendicular to the plane of the ring and such that the inner edge of the ring moves faster forward than the outer edge. Within a stationary body of fluid, a vortex ring can travel for relatively long distance, carrying the spinning fluid with it.

==Structure==

In a typical vortex ring, the fluid particles move in roughly circular paths around an imaginary circle (the &quot;core&quot;) that is perpendicular to those paths. As in any vortex, the velocity of the fluid is roughly constant except near the core, so that the angular velocity increases towards the core, and most of the vorticity (and hence most of the energy dissipation) is concentrated near it.

Unlike a sea wave, whose motion is only apparent, a moving vortex ring actually carries the spinning fluid along. Just as a rotating wheel lessens friction between a car and the ground, the poloidal flow of the vortex lessens the friction between the core and the surrounding stationary fluid, allowing it to travel a long distance with relatively little loss of mass and kinetic energy, and little change in size or shape. Thus, a vortex ring can carry mass much further and with less dispersion than a jet of fluid. That explains, for instance, why a smoke ring keeps traveling long after any extra smoke blown out with it has stopped and dispersed. These properties of vortex rings are exploited in the vortex ring gun for riot control, and vortex ring toys such as the air vortex cannons.

==Formation==

===Formation process===

The formation of vortex rings has fascinated the scientific community for more than a century, starting with William Barton Rogers who made sounding observations of the formation process of air vortex rings in air, air rings in liquids, and liquid rings in liquids. In particular, William Barton Rogers made use of the simple experimental method of letting a drop of liquid fall on a free liquid surface; a falling colored drop of liquid, such as milk or dyed water, will inevitably form a vortex ring at the interface due to the surface tension.

A method proposed by G. I. Taylor to generate a vortex ring is to impulsively start a disk from rest. The flow separates to form a cylindrical vortex sheet and by artificially dissolving the disk, one is left with an isolated vortex ring. This is the case when someone is stirring their cup of coffee with a spoon and observing the propagation of a half-vortex in the cup.

In a laboratory, vortex rings are formed by impulsively discharging fluid through a sharp-edged nozzle or orifice. The impulsive motion of the piston/cylinder system is either triggered by an electric actuator or by a pressurized vessel connected to a control valve. For a nozzle geometry, and at first approximation, the exhaust speed is uniform and equal to the piston speed. This is referred as a parallel starting jet. It is possible to have a conical nozzle in which the streamlines at the exhaust are directed toward the centerline. This is referred as a converging starting jet. The orifice geometry which consists in an orifice plate covering the straight tube exhaust, can be considered as an infinitely converging nozzle but the vortex formation differs considerably from the converging nozzle, principally due to the absence of boundary layer in the thickness of the orifice plate throughout the formation process. The fast moving fluid (A) is therefore discharged into a quiescent fluid (B). The shear imposed at the interface between the two fluids slows down the outer layer of the fluid (A) relatively to the centerline fluid. In order to satisfy the Kutta condition, the flow is forced to detach, curl and roll-up in the form of a vortex sheet. Later, the vortex sheet detaches from the feeding jet and propagates freely downstream due to its self-induced kinematics. This is the process commonly observed when a smoker forms smoke rings from their mouth, and how vortex ring toys work.

Secondary effects are likely to modify the formation process of vortex rings. Firstly, at the very first instants, the velocity profile at the exhaust exhibits extrema near the edge causing a large vorticity flux into the vortex ring. Secondly, as the ring grows in size at the edge of the exhaust, negative vorticity is generated on the outer wall of the generator which considerably reduces the circulation accumulated by the primary ring. Thirdly, as the boundary layer inside the pipe, or nozzle, thickens, the velocity profile approaches the one of a Poiseuille flow and the centerline velocity at the exhaust is measured to be larger than the prescribed piston speed. Last but not least, in the event the piston-generated vortex ring is pushed through the exhaust, it may interact or even merge with the primary vortex, hence modifying its characteristic, such as circulation, and potentially forcing the transition of the vortex ring to turbulence.

Vortex ring structures are easily observable in nature. For instance, a mushroom cloud formed by a nuclear explosion or volcanic eruption, has a vortex ring-like structure. Vortex rings are also seen in many different biological flows; blood is discharged into the left ventricle of the human heart in the form of a vortex ring and jellyfishes or squids were shown to propel themselves in water by periodically discharging vortex rings in the surrounding. Finally, for more industrial applications, the synthetic jet which consists in periodically-formed vortex rings, was proved to be an appealing technology for flow control, heat and mass transfer and thrust generation

===Vortex formation number===

Prior to Gharib &quot;et al.&quot; (1998), few studies had focused on the formation of vortex rings generated with long stroke-to-diameter ratios formula_1, where formula_2 is the length of the column of fluid discharged through the exhaust and formula_3 is the diameter of the exhaust. For short stroke ratios, only one isolated vortex ring is generated and no fluid is left behind in the formation process. For long stroke ratios, however, the vortex ring is followed by some energetic fluid, referred as the trailing jet. On top of showing experimental evidence of the phenomenon, an explanation of the phenomenon was provided in terms of energy maximisation invoking a variational principle first reported by Kelvin and later proven by Benjamin (1976), or Friedman &amp; Turkington (1981). Ultimately, Gharib &quot;et al.&quot; (1998) observed the transition between these two states to occur at a non-dimensional time formula_4, or equivalently a stroke ratio formula_1, of about 4. The robustness of this number with respect to initial and boundary conditions suggested the quantity to be a universal constant and was thus named &quot;formation number&quot;.

The phenomenon of &#x27;pinch-off&#x27;, or detachment, from the feeding starting jet is observed in a wide range of flows observed in nature. For instance, it was shown that biological systems such as the human heart or swimming and flying animals generate vortex rings with a stroke-to-diameter ratio close to the formation number of about 4, hence giving ground to the existence of an optimal vortex ring formation process in terms of propulsion, thrust generation and mass transport. In particular, the squid &quot;lolliguncula brevis&quot; was shown to propel itself by periodically emitting vortex rings at a stroke-ratio close to 4. Moreover, in another study by Gharib &quot;et al&quot; (2006), the formation number was used as an indicator to monitor the health of the human heart and identify patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.

==Other examples==

===Vortex ring state in helicopters===
Air vortices can form around the main rotor of a helicopter, causing a dangerous condition known as vortex ring state (VRS) or &quot;settling with power&quot;. In this condition, air that moves down through the rotor turns outward, then up, inward, and then down through the rotor again. This re-circulation of flow can negate much of the lifting force and cause a catastrophic loss of altitude. Applying more power (increasing collective pitch) serves to further accelerate the downwash through which the main-rotor is descending, exacerbating the condition.

===In the human heart===
A vortex ring is formed in the left ventricle of the human heart during cardiac relaxation (diastole), as a jet of blood enters through the mitral valve. This phenomenon was initially observed in vitro and subsequently strengthened by analyses based on color Doppler mapping and magnetic resonance imaging. Some recent studies have also confirmed the presence of a vortex ring during rapid filling phase of diastole and implied that the process of vortex ring formation can influence mitral annulus dynamics.

===Bubble rings===
Releasing air underwater forms bubble rings, which are vortex rings of water with bubbles (or even a single donut-shaped bubble) trapped along its axis line. Such rings are often produced by scuba divers and dolphins.

===Volcanoes===
Under particular conditions, some volcanic vents can produce large visible vortex rings. Though a rare phenomenon, several volcanoes have been observed emitting massive vortex rings as erupting steam and gas condense, forming visible toroidal clouds:
*Mount Etna, Italy (Sicily)
*Stromboli, Italy (Aeolian Islands)
*Eyjafjallajökull, Iceland
*Hekla, Iceland
*Tungurahua, Ecuador
*Pacaya, Guatemala
*Mount Redoubt, United States (Alaska)
*Mount Aso, Japan (Kyushu)
*Whakaari (White Island), New Zealand
*Gunung Slamet, Indonesia (Central Java)
*Momotombo, Nicaragua (León)

===Separated vortex rings===

There has been research and experiments on the existence of separated vortex rings (SVR) such as those formed in the wake of the pappus of a dandelion. This special type of vortex ring effectively stabilizes the seed as it travels through the air and increases the lift generated by the seed. Compared to a standard vortex ring, which is propelled downstream, the axially symmetric SVR remains attached to the pappus for the duration of its flight and uses drag to enhance the travel. These dandelion seed structures have been used to create tiny battery-free wireless sensors that can float in the wind and be dispersed across a large area.

==Theory==

===Historical studies===
The formation of vortex rings has fascinated the scientific community for more than a century, starting with William Barton Rogers who made sounding observations of the formation process of air vortex rings in air, air rings in liquids, and liquid rings in liquids. In particular, William Barton Rogers made use of the simple experimental method of letting a drop of liquid fall on a free liquid surface; a falling colored drop of liquid, such as milk or dyed water, will inevitably form a vortex ring at the interface due to the surface tension.

Vortex rings were first mathematically analyzed by the German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz, in his 1858 paper &quot;On Integrals of the Hydrodynamical Equations which Express Vortex-motion&quot;.

===Circular vortex lines===
For a single zero-thickness vortex ring, the vorticity is represented by a Dirac delta function as formula_6 where formula_7 denotes the coordinates of the vortex filament of strength formula_8 in a constant formula_9 half-plane. The Stokes stream function is:
formula_10
with formula_11
where formula_12 and formula_13 are respectively the least and the greatest distance from the point formula_14 to the vortex line, and where formula_15 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind and formula_16 is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind.

A circular vortex line is the limiting case of a thin vortex ring. Because there is no core thickness, the speed of the ring is infinite, as well as the kinetic energy. The hydrodynamic impulse can be expressed in term of the strength, or &#x27;circulation&#x27; formula_8, of the vortex ring as formula_18.

===Thin-core vortex rings===
The discontinuity introduced by the Dirac delta function prevents the computation of the speed and the kinetic energy of a circular vortex line. It is however possible to estimate these quantities for a vortex ring having a finite small thickness. For a thin vortex ring, the core can be approximated by a disk of radius formula_19 which is assumed to be infinitesimal compared to the radius of the ring formula_20, i.e. formula_21. As a consequence, inside and in the vicinity of the core ring, one may write: formula_22, formula_23 and formula_24, and, in the limit of formula_25, the elliptic integrals can be approximated by formula_26 and formula_27.

For a uniform vorticity distribution formula_28 in the disk, the Stokes stream function can therefore be approximated by
&lt;/ref&gt;
formula_29

The resulting circulation formula_30, hydrodynamic impulse formula_31 and kinetic energy formula_16 are
formula_33

It is also possible to find the translational ring speed (which is finite) of such isolated thin-core vortex ring:
formula_34
which finally results in the well-known expression found by Kelvin and published in the English translation by Tait of von Helmholtz&#x27;s paper:
formula_35

===Spherical vortices===
Hill&#x27;s spherical vortex is an example of steady vortex flow and may be used to model vortex rings having a vorticity distribution extending to the centerline. More precisely, the model supposes a linearly distributed vorticity distribution in the radial direction starting from the centerline and bounded by a sphere of radius formula_19 as:
formula_37
where formula_38 is the constant translational speed of the vortex.

Finally, the Stokes stream function of Hill&#x27;s spherical vortex can be computed and is given by:
formula_39
The above expressions correspond to the stream function describing a steady flow. In a fixed frame of reference, the stream function of the bulk flow having a speed formula_38 should be added.

The circulation, the hydrodynamic impulse and the kinetic energy can also be calculated in terms of the translational speed formula_38 and radius formula_19:
&lt;/ref&gt;
formula_43

Such a structure or an electromagnetic equivalent has been suggested as an explanation for the internal structure of ball lightning. For example, Shafranov used a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) analogy to Hill&#x27;s stationary fluid mechanical vortex to consider the equilibrium conditions of axially symmetric MHD configurations, reducing the problem to the theory of stationary flow of an incompressible fluid. In axial symmetry, he considered general equilibrium for distributed currents and concluded under the Virial Theorem that if there were no gravitation, a bounded equilibrium configuration could exist only in the presence of an azimuthal current.

===Fraenkel-Norbury model===

The Fraenkel-Norbury model of isolated vortex ring, sometimes referred as the standard model, refers to the class of steady vortex rings having a linear distribution of vorticity in the core and parametrised by the mean core radius formula_44, where formula_45 is the area of the vortex core and formula_20 is the radius of the ring. Approximate solutions were found for thin-core rings, i.e. formula_47, and thick Hill&#x27;s-like vortex rings, i.e. formula_48, Hill&#x27;s spherical vortex having a mean core radius of precisely formula_49. For mean core radii in between, one must rely on numerical methods. Norbury (1973) found numerically the resulting steady vortex ring of given mean core radius, and this for a set of 14 mean core radii ranging from 0.1 to 1.35. The resulting streamlines defining the core of the ring were tabulated, as well as the translational speed. In addition, the circulation, the hydrodynamic impulse and the kinetic energy of such steady vortex rings were computed and presented in non-dimensional form.

===Instabilities===
A kind of azimuthal radiant-symmetric structure was observed by Maxworthy when the vortex ring traveled around a critical velocity, which is between the turbulence and laminar states. Later Huang and Chan reported that if the initial state of the vortex ring is not perfectly circular, another kind of instability would occur. An elliptical vortex ring undergoes an oscillation in which it is first stretched in the vertical direction and squeezed in the horizontal direction, then passes through an intermediate state where it is circular, then is deformed in the opposite way (stretched in the horizontal direction and squeezed in the vertical) before reversing the process and returning to the original state.

<text>The Social Democratic Federation of the United States of America (SDF) was a political party in the United States, formed in 1936 by the so-called &quot;Old Guard&quot; faction of the Socialist Party of America. The SDF later merged again with the Socialist Party in 1957 to form the Socialist Party-Social Democratic Federation (SP-SDF).

==History==

===Origins of split===
Social Democratic Federation leader Louis Waldman noted in his memoirs that while the official split of the Socialist Party that resulted in the creation of the Social Democratic Federation took place in 1936, &quot;the crucial events occurred at the party&#x27;s national convention in Detroit in 1934.&quot; It was at this national gathering that the ongoing factional war between a youthful &quot;Militant&quot; faction favoring aggressive advocacy of revolutionary tactics and joint action with the Communist Party won the day and pushed through a new Declaration of Principles, leading the SPA&#x27;s right wing faction, known as the &quot;Old Guard&quot; to abandon the organization. Throughout the 1930s the Socialist Party had achieved moderate growth, its paid membership returning to the 25,000 level and its candidate for President of the United States Norman Thomas polling nearly a million votes in the election of 1932.

Waldman recounted the main points of departure between the radical youth of the party and the staid older elements: The National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party also established a department aimed to direct the activities of Socialists in the trade unions, a tactic which smacked of quasi-Communist tactics to the members of the Old Guard faction.

===&quot;Old Guard&quot; splits===

The &quot;Old Guard&quot; faction was further provoked by the adoption of a policy document known as the &quot;Declaration of Principles&quot; by the Socialist Party&#x27;s 1934 national convention, held in Detroit. The 1934 Declaration of Principles was merely the result of a long process, in the view of the Old Guard leadership, its call for the &quot;development of the dictatorship of workers and peasants&quot; particularly galling to the faction&#x27;s anti-communist sensibilities. In closing the debate on the matter for the Old Guard at the Detroit convention, New York state party chairman Waldman had condemned the Declaration in no uncertain terms, accusing the Declaration of advancing &quot;dangerous, provocative proposals&quot; which advanced an &quot;anarchistic, illegal, Communist doctrine.&quot;

After the passage of the Declaration of Principles and the closing of the convention, the Old Guard returned home. On behalf of the Socialist Party of New York, chairman Waldman immediately issued a statement disavowing the actions of the Detroit convention: The Old Guard opponents of the Detroit decisions formally organized themselves as a faction immediately after the close of the Detroit conclave, establishing the Committee for the Preservation of the Socialist Party. Pamphlets were published and distributed alleging the Declaration of Principles was a &quot;culminating point of a deep seated antagonism&quot; within the Socialist Party — the proverbial &quot;straw that breaks or threatens to break the camel&#x27;s back.&quot; A stern warning was issued that it was &quot;not enough&quot; to merely defeat the Detroit Declaration of Principles in the party referendum held for their ratification, but that &quot;the Socialist Party must be made safe for Socialism, for social democracy.&quot; Names of sympathizers were gathered, funds collected, and an office established in New York City. A &quot;Provisional Executive Committee&quot; of the faction was named, including such long-time members of the SPA as James Maurer of Pennsylvania, Algernon Lee and Louis Waldman of New York, George Roewer of Massachusetts (Chairman of the Provisional Executive Committee), George Goebel of New Jersey, and Mayor Jasper McLevy of Bridgeport, Connecticut. Louis Hendin was engaged as Executive Secretary of the faction, which had already in 1934 taken the form of a &quot;party within the party.&quot;

In his 1944 memoir, Socialist Party of New York State Chairman Louis Waldman freely acknowledged that he and his New York Old Guard comrades disregarded the authority of the 1934 National Convention and immediately attempted to lock up party assets in his faction&#x27;s control: 

===Establishment of the Social Democratic Federation===

It was not until January 1936 that the National Executive Committee finally revoked the charter of the Old Guard-dominated Socialist Party of New York and reorganized the state under the leadership of an alliance of forces loyal to Norman Thomas and members of the Militant faction. The marriage had already broken up long before this divorce was finalized, however.

In the interim, the &quot;Old Guard&quot; socialists organized themselves as the People&#x27;s Party of New York and affiliated for electoral purposes with the American Labor Party, which retained a ballot line in New York state. This continued until the decision was made to disband and reorganize as an &quot;educational organization for the dissemination of socialist ideals&quot; at two-day convention was held during the weekend of March 27–28, 1937, at the Rand School of Social Science in New York City. This new organization was to be known as the Social Democratic Federation of the State of New York.

The SDF went on to formally organize itself on a national basis at a convention held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on May 29–30, 1937. This foundation gathering elected Mayor Jasper McLevy of Bridgeport, Connecticut as National Chairman of the new organization. The gathering passed a resolution of support to the Loyalist government of Spain and supporting an anti-Nazi boycott. The convention also voted to apply to the Labour and Socialist International as an affiliate.

The SDF chose to seek international affiliation immediately with the Socialist International, over the objections of some delegates like William Karlin of New York, who urged his fellows to wait the short time until &quot;the Trotsky Communists who call themselves the Socialist Party&quot; joined the Fourth International before seeking admission. This theme of communist influence in the Socialist Party from whence they sprung was echoed by Louis Waldman, who declared to the press than Norman Thomas had come under &quot;communist influence&quot; and that &quot;rather than lose our identity as Americans, we left the party.&quot;

The Social Democratic Federation was not organized as an electoral political organization but rather as an interest group seeking to establish connection with the trade union movement in a broader labor party. At the time of its creation the organization did incorporate the former SPA state locals in New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. The influential municipal parties in Reading, Pennsylvania and Bridgeport, Connecticut also left the Socialist Party to establish the SDF. In New York, the SDF supported Franklin Delano Roosevelt and American Labor Party candidates, but the takeover of the ALP by the Communist Party USA drove the SDF&#x27;s adherents from that organization.

Executive Secretary of the SDF was August Claessens, who later served as National Chairman of the group until his death in 1954.

===Reunification with the Socialist Party===

Reunification with the dissident Social Democratic Federation was long a goal of the Socialist Party regulars, with initial attempts beginning as early as 1937. In his 1938 book, &quot;Socialism on the Defensive,&quot; SP leader Norman Thomas acknowledged that a number of issues had been involved in the split which led to the formation of the SDF, including &quot;organizational policy, the effort to make the party inclusive of all socialist elements not bound by communist discipline; a feeling of dissatisfaction with social democratic tactics which had failed in Germany&quot; as well as &quot;the socialist estimate of Russia; and the possibility of cooperation with communists on certain specific matters.&quot; Still, he held that &quot;those of us who believe that an inclusive socialist party is desirable, and ought to be possible, hope that the growing friendliness of socialist groups will bring about not only joint action but ultimately a satisfactory reunion on the basis of sufficient agreement for harmonious support of a socialist program.&quot; This speedy reunification failed after Nazi-Soviet Pact of 1939 revealed the threat of a coalition of two totalitarian states. The threat revealed by this pact reduced the influence of pacifists in the Federation, the Socialist Party, and the labor movement.

During the years of World War II through the first half of the 1950s, the SDF&#x27;s paid membership drastically declined. Its influence on New York politics and labor unions similarly dropped. These declines corresponded with a general decline in the prestige of socialist organizations in the Cold War period, as well as the growth of Americans for Democratic Action and other liberal organizations, which tapped the SDF&#x27;s support among sympathetic progressives. This decline made the SDF more amenable to reunification with the Socialist Party, which lost members while maintaining its opposition to communism and critical support for the U.S. policy of containment. After several years of negotiations, a merger was finally accomplished in 1957 to form the Socialist Party-Social Democratic Federation (SP-SDF). A small group of holdouts refused to reunify, establishing a new organization called the Democratic Socialist Federation.

== Publications ==
The SDF published a monthly, &quot;Social Democrat&quot; edited by Algernon Lee, August Claessens and Liston Oak. It ran from Vol. I #1 July 1944 to Vol XII #5 December 1955.

<text>Tom Smith is an American singer-songwriter from Ann Arbor, Michigan, who got his start in the filk music community. He is a fourteen-time winner of the Pegasus Award for excellence in filking, including awards for his &quot;A Boy and His Frog&quot;, &quot;307 Ale&quot;, and &quot;The Return of the King (Uh-huh)&quot;, and was inducted into the Filk Hall of Fame in 2005.

== Career ==
His nickname, &quot;The World&#x27;s Fastest Filker&quot;, comes from numerous instances of &quot;instafilk&quot;, i.e., quickly-written or improvised songs. He has improvised entire concert sets, and his album &quot;Badgers and Gophers and Squirrels Oh My: The 24-Hour Project&quot;, inspired by Scott McCloud&#x27;s 24-Hour Comics Day, features seventeen songs written in twenty-four hours. In May 2006, he released the album &quot;The Last Hero on Earth&quot;, a comic opera which has twenty songs, all written in one day, to the same plot.

In August 2006, emulating Jonathan Coulton&#x27;s &quot;Thing a Week&quot;, he began &quot;iTom&quot;, a project where he released a new song every week for a year, and continued sporadically after that. So far, he has collected four albums of those songs.

He has parodied Christine Lavin songs with her blessing. He authored the official song for Talk Like a Pirate Day.
He wrote &quot;Enterprising Man&quot; for the animated parody video &quot;Babylon Park: Grudgematch&quot;, as well as the official Transylvania Polygnostic University theme song for the comic &quot;Girl Genius&quot; by Studio Foglio.

Smith performs frequently at conventions across the United States, and has also performed in Canada and England. He has been featured frequently on Dr. Demento, Public Radio International&#x27;s &quot;Sound &amp; Spirit&quot;, and other radio programs. In 2007, he joined with comedy musicians such as Rob Balder, The Great Luke Ski, Sudden Death, Worm Quartet, and others in &quot;The FuMP&quot; (The Funny Music Project). Smith has appeared in concert with Dr. Demento and on the same bill as Chick Corea.

In 2005, &quot;A Boy and His Frog&quot; was the subject of a mini-arc in the &quot;Something Positive&quot; webcomic.

On June 7, 2008, Smith tore his quadriceps while attempting to take the stage at a Christine Lavin concert, landing him in the hospital and preventing him from performing for the next few months.

<text>Fath () was a Persian-language daily newspaper published in Tehran, Iran.

==History==
&quot;Fath&quot; was published by the same team of journalists that published &quot;Khordad&quot;, led by Yadollah Eslami. While cracking down on reformist publications, Iran banned Fath in April 2000; saying it was publishing articles that &quot;disparaged Islam and the religious elements of the Islamic revolution.&quot;

<text>Vodafone Ireland Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Vodafone Group, is a mobile phone network, broadband and TV provider in Ireland. It was created when the Vodafone Group bought Eircell, the mobile arm of Telecom Éireann. As of September 2019, Vodafone has 26% of broadband subscribers (including 40% of fiber to the premises subscribers), and 43% of mobile phone subscribers.

The company operates a full range of voice, SMS, MMS and mobile data services using a 2G GSM 900/1800 network and a 3G UMTS 900/2100 network capable of offering a range of broadband services including DC-HSPA+ which can deliver up to a theoretical 43.2 Mbit/s. Their 4G network was launched in October 2013. Vodafone claims over 99% of the island of Ireland is covered by their 4G network within the Republic. Vodafone 4G operates on the 800/1800 network offering speeds of up to 75 Mbit/s. They have also built a new kind of 4G called 4G+ which enables speeds of 225 Mbit/s on devices that support this and the initial roll out of this service was in major towns and cities first becoming more widespread over time. Vodafone 4G is available to over 6 cities and 500 towns in Ireland making Vodafone the strongest and most widespread 4G service offered in the country. Their 5G service was launched in 2019.

Vodafone Ireland offers a full range of contract (bill pay) and prepay services, including mobile telephony and mobile broadband.

The company also offers a range of fixed-line services including traditional telephone services, ADSL2+, FTTC (VDSL2) and FTTH high speed broadband. These services are delivered using &quot;SIRO&quot;, &quot;Open Eir&quot;, and &quot;NBI&#x27;s&quot; wholesale access networks with Vodafone&#x27;s own back-haul capacity. In some areas, Vodafone has made use of Local-Loop Unbundling (LLU) and has its own equipment in the local exchange operated in partnership with BT Ireland

Numbers issued by Vodafone Ireland usually start with 087 (+353 87), however full number portability is in use in Ireland so the mobile prefix is not a reliable indicator of which network the number is hosted on.

==Eircell==

Eircell commenced operation in 1986 as the Mobile and Broadcast division of Telecom Éireann. The GSM network went live in July 1993. Eircell handled the Irish mobile phone networks defined by the access codes 088 (analogue TACS system) and 087 (digital GSM 900 system) from 1984 until its transfer to Vodafone in 2001. Usage of the service remained low until it became a separate subsidiary, &quot;Eircell Limited&quot;, in 1997. In October 1997, Eircell introduced the analogue prepaid pay as you go system under the &quot;Ready To Go&quot; brand, and turned mobile communications in Ireland into a mass-market product. From early 1997 Eircell faced competition from Esat Digifone, then a joint venture between Denis O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Esat Telecom Group and Telenor of Norway. In 2000, Vodafone made an offer for the company to Eircell&#x27;s parent, Eircom, which saw the company demerge from Eircom plc into a separate plc, Eircell 2000 plc (trading name: Eircell Vodafone), which was then acquired by Vodafone. In 2002, Eircell Vodafone was rebranded as Vodafone Ireland.

In 2001, Eircell closed down its original analogue TACS (088) system, and Vodafone Ireland now operates a purely digital (GSM/UMTS) network.

===Rebranding===

Vodafone saw Eircell undergo a major rebranding exercise on its acquisition by the group. The main rebranding was to associate a shade of deep purple with the company. When Vodafone rebranded with their trademark shade of red, the tagline used was &quot;Red is the new purple, Vodafone is the new name for Eircell&quot;.

Vodafone Ireland introduced UMTS services (branded &quot;Vodafone live! with 3G&quot;) in 2004, launching the first handsets in November. This meant they were ahead of O2 Ireland and new entrant Three Ireland in launching third-generation services. Mobile network Meteor is rolling out their own 3G/UMTS network, having been awarded the last Irish UMTS licence. Initially restricted to contract (&#x27;bill pay&#x27;) customers, Vodafone extended UMTS to pre-pay &#x27;Ready To Go&#x27; customers from 2 June 2005.

==Criticism==
Analysis by the Sunday Independent in January 2006 showed the massive margins being earned by Vodafone and O2 in the country are costing Irish mobile phone users about €300m a year. If the mobile phone companies were to cut their Irish margins to the group average, Vodafone customers would see their annual bills falling by an average of €80.47 (€6.71 a month)

The European Commission upheld a ruling by the Irish regulatory body, Comreg, that the Irish mobile phone market needed greater competition, and acknowledged that &quot;tacit collusion possibly existed between O2 and Vodafone&quot;.

A senior manager at Vodafone Ireland in March 2007 was dismissed following allegations that he defrauded the mobile operator of more than €1m. The company added in a statement: &quot;As the matter is subject to legal proceedings, Vodafone cannot comment further.&quot;

The National Parents Council criticised mobile phone companies for the lack of information available about filtering. &quot;The Sunday Tribune&quot; tested access to four separate sites – a pornography site, an Irish escort site, a pro-anorexia site and a prosuicide site – on the mobile phone networks Vodafone, O2, 3 and Meteor. All four networks allowed access.

In January 2009 it was revealed that Ireland was nearly the most profitable market in the world for multinational mobile operators like Vodafone.

In April 2009, the company admitted to overcharging 100,000 of its Irish customers a total of €900,000 by incorrectly billing them.

In August 2010, it was revealed that the Irish exchequer was facing a demand from the company for a substantial corporation tax refund after it agreed that tax paid in Ireland should have been paid in Britain. The Vodafone subsidiary in question had profits of over €200 million but just 20 employees.

In March 2011, Vodafone pleaded guilty to four breaches of the Data Protection Act at the Dublin District Court.

Vodafone admitted in June 2012 it had not returned more than half of the €1.9m it overcharged customers and there was little likelihood the remainder would be returned. ComReg said it was monitoring Vodafone&#x27;s provision of refunds to affected consumers.

The Department of Justice advised Vodafone publishing details of data requested by the Gardaí and other Irish authorities might compromise national security and hinder the investigation of serious criminal activity but it subsequently published the data.

==Perlico==
On 13 November 2007, Vodafone Ireland announced the acquisition of &quot;Perlico&quot;, a small fixed line phone and broadband services reseller for €80m. This was in line with the strategy of other Vodafone companies across Europe, in buying small fixed-line providers for potential offerings of future converged services. As a result of the acquisition, Perlico was dissolved after the merger, having become a wholly owned subsidiary of Vodafone Ireland.

== Acquisition of BT customers ==
On 22 July 2009, BT Ireland agreed to transfer its consumer voice, broadband data and small business operations in Ireland to Vodafone, leap-frogging the company into a leading role as a fixed-line broadband operator in the country. Under the terms of the deal Vodafone leased capacity on BT&#x27;s fixed line network for the services.

<doc id="828017" wikidata="Q1896691" url="?curid=828017" title="Palmarian Catholic Church">
<text>The Palmarian Church (), officially registered as the Palmarian Christian Church and also known as the Palmarian Catholic Church, is a Christian church with an episcopal see in El Palmar de Troya, Andalusia, Spain. The Palmarian Church claims to be the exclusive One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church founded by Jesus Christ. It claims that the Holy See, the institution of the Papacy and the headquarters of the Catholic Church was moved to El Palmar de Troya at the Cathedral-Basilica of Our Crowned Mother of Palmar, under the auspices of the Patriarchate of El Palmar de Troya, in 1978, due to the alleged apostasy of the Roman Catholic Church from the Catholic faith.

The origins of the Palmarians as a distinct body can be traced back to the alleged Marian apparitions of Our Lady of Palmar, which took place in Andalusia, Spain, from 1968 onward. Two men became particularly associated with this movement as time went on, Clemente Domínguez y Gómez and Manuel Alonso Corral. The former was known as a charismatic visionary and seer, while the latter the intellectual &quot;éminence grise&quot;. The messages of these visions were favourable to a traditionalist Catholic pushback to the liberalising changes introduced by the Second Vatican Council and alleged a Masonic infiltration of the Roman Catholic Church. In 1975, the Palmarians founded a religious order known as the Carmelites of the Holy Face and had a number of priests ordained, then consecrated as bishops by Archbishop Ngô Đình Thục, giving them holy orders. After the death of Pope Paul VI in 1978, Clemente Domínguez claimed that he had been mystically crowned pope of the Catholic Church by Jesus Christ and was to reign as Pope Gregory XVII from El Palmar de Troya.

There have been four subsequent Palmarian popes and the one reigning since 2016 is Pope Peter III. Critical scholars, journalists, and former followers almost universally describe the organization as a cult. Members are expected not to watch any films or television, vote or read newspapers. They also engage in heavy shunning of former members and are not allowed to talk to people unrelated to the Palmarian Catholic Church.

==Name==

The official name of the Palmarian Church in the register of religious entities in the Kingdom of Spain is the &quot;Iglesia Cristiana Palmariana de los Carmelitas de la Santa Faz&quot; (English: &quot;Palmarian Christian Church of the Carmelites of the Holy Face&quot;). This is due to a legal process which began in 1980, when the church applied to the Spanish Ministry of Justice for the status of recognised religion under the name &quot;Iglesia Católica, Apostólica y Palmariana, Orden Religiosa de los Carmelitas de la Santa Faz en Compañía de Jesús y María&quot; (English: &quot;Catholic, Apostolic and Palmarian Church, Religious Order of the Carmelites of the Holy Face in Company of Jesus and Mary&quot;). This was initially rejected in 1982 by the Director-General of Religious Affairs who said that the terms &quot;Catholic&quot;, &quot;Pope&quot; and &quot;Cardinals&quot;, used by the Palmarians bore &quot;excessive resemblance&quot; to those still used by the Roman Catholic Church; in addition, the Palmarians simply claimed that they were the Catholic Church. A few months later, they made a fresh application using the current official name with &quot;Christian&quot; instead of Catholic, while continuing to use terms such as the &quot;Holy Catholic Palmarian Church&quot;, the &quot;One, Holy, Catholic, Apostolic and Palmarian Church&quot;, the &quot;Palmarian Catholic Church&quot; and other variations in internal documents. The Director-General again rejected the registration due to the changes only being &quot;semantic&quot;, but the Palmarians finally pushed through their registration through the Supreme Court of Spain in 1987 using the current official name.

==History==
===Background===
====Marian apparitions, Spain and the Second Vatican Council====
From the 19th century onward, there has been in the Catholic world, a series of what Magnus Lundberg calls &quot;Marian Apocalyptic movements&quot;, resulting from reported Marian apparitions, in which the Virgin Mary is said to appear to members of the laity. In the apparitions, she typically bears an important eschatological message, warning humanity of a coming chastisement from God for its sinful behaviour and apostacy, followed by a period of peace and virtue for the faithful remnant and then a more fearsome chastisement in response to humanity returning to its sinful ways, and a final world war leading to the end of the world. Some of these have been recognised by the Roman Catholic Church after an investigation and declared worthy of belief and veneration, but most of them have not. Palmarians regard several Marian apparitions in particular as important steps on the way to the appearance of Our Lady of Palmar; these are Our Lady of La Salette (1846), Fátima (1917), Ezkioga (1931), Heroldsbach (1949), Ladeira do Pinheiro (1960), San Damiano (1961), and Garabandal (1961).

The apparitions of El Palmar de Troya took place in Spain at a time of religious and political upheaval, during the final decade that Francisco Franco was &quot;Caudillo&quot; of the Spanish State. The government had been established in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War and during the war the nationalists identified themselves as engaged in a &quot;Crusade against the Second Republic (1931–1939), international communism and freemasonry.&quot; Before and during the Civil War, many Catholic clerics were killed by the republican side and in some places the Catholic Church had to go underground. After victory, under Franco, National Catholicism was adopted in Spain, whereby Spanishness and Catholicism were presented as being inseparable. In the worldview of Francoism, Spain was a &quot;providential nation, being a faithful Catholic bulwark against liberalism, Freemasonry, Protestantism and communism&quot;. Spain was a confessional state and this broadly had the support of the church; however, by the 1940s, there was some concerns about the power of the state subordinating the church and after the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s, the high episcopacy, particularly Cardinal Vicente Enrique y Tarancón began to push against Franco for &quot;reforms&quot; and the creation of a more modern state. This was not unanimous and some Spanish priests belonging to the &quot;Hermandad Sacerdotal Española&quot; backed Francoists against the new liberal-leaning line of the Spanish Episcopal Conference and the Vatican.

Following the Second Vatican Council, which took place between 1962 and 1965, there emerged a new openness to religious liberty, ecumenism, interreligious dialogue and on the back of it, introduced in 1969, a New Order of Mass. These changes scandalised traditionalists within the Catholic Church and an insurgent traditionalist Catholic movement emerged pushing back against this. Prominent early figures included Frenchmen such as Georges de Nantes, who founded the &quot;Ligue de la contre-réforme catholique&quot; and Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre who founded the Society of St. Pius X (which became by far the most prominent). The early Palmarian themes were a part of this &quot;milleu&quot;, with direct and indirect relationships with the traditionalist Catholic resistance worldwide, including the SSPX. According to Lundberg, traditionalists refused to believe that &quot;a true Catholic hierarchy would make such changes, and saw modernist, masonic and communist conspiracies&quot;. A common traditionalist theme of decrying &quot;infiltration&quot;, raised questions about the complicity of the Pope himself: Lefebvre diplomatically criticised Pope Paul VI, but still considered him a true Pope. At the opposite end, by 1971, sedevacantists emerged who claimed that Paul VI was a non-Catholic Antipope leading a new heretical religion, an early example of which is Joaquín Sáenz y Arriaga.

====Apparitions of Our Lady of Palmar and Devotion to the Holy Face====
On 30 March 1968, four Spanish Catholic girls, aged 12 and 13—Ana García, Rafaela Gordo, Ana Aguilera and Josefa Guzmán—reported that the Virgin Mary had appeared to them in the field of &quot;La Alcaparroa&quot; farm, close to the village of El Palmar de Troya, which at that time was a district of the municipality of Utrera, in the province of Seville, Andalusia, Spain. On 11 April 1968, a devout Catholic woman named Rosario Arenillas reported seeing the Virgin Mary with the mantle of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in the same place. On 20 May 1968 a neighbor from Utrera named María Marín also said she had seen the Virgin in the same place. On 6 June 1968, María Luisa Vila from Seville went to the farm and said she had a mystical ecstasy in which Jesus Christ administered communion to her and, according to witnesses, when she opened her mouth there was a bloody host inside. In the summer of 1968, Antonio Romero, Manuel Fernández, José Navarro, Antonio Anillos and Arsenia Llanos also said they suffered mystical ecstasies there.

On 15 October 1968, Clemente Domínguez and Manuel Alonso Corral visited the site for the first time. Manuel &quot;Manolo&quot; Corral worked in an insurance brokerage that Serafín Madrid used to finance his charitable works. When Corral became involved in the situation at Palmar de Troya he was expelled from the insurance company (belief in the apparitions were strongly opposed by José Bueno y Monreal, Archbishop of Seville, who refused to examine the seers or even open up any enquiries). On 15 August 1969, the two men attended a Holy Mass celebrated by a Jesuit priest there and during it María Luisa Vila said she had a vision of the Virgin (Josemaría Escrivá, founder of Opus Dei, drawn to mystical phenomenon, held a long interview with Vila who he had met previously at Jerez de la Frontera, Cádiz). Later they ran into María Marín and Nectorio María who said they had a vision of Jesus Christ. After this point, Domínguez and Corral visited far more frequently. There they talked with the visionaries and witnessed their ecstasies and on 14 September 1969, both declared that they had an appearance of a luminous cross.
On 30 September 1968, Rosario Arenillas and Domínguez said they had a vision of Jesus Christ and Padre Pio. A few days later María Luisa Vila declared that she had the same vision. On 8 December 1968, Domínguez claimed to have a vision in which the Virgin and the angels gave him a Dominican habit and on 10 December 1968, Domínguez said that Dominic de Guzmán had appeared to him to recommend praying the Rosary and the &quot;Pater Noster&quot;. On 10 December 1968 he also said that Joseph appeared to him. On 12 December 1969, Domínguez said he had another vision of Dominic and next to him he said he saw the Holy Face of Jesus. Then he said that Dominic had given him the message that he should expand devotion to the Holy Face, the Stations of the Cross and the reparative communion on the first Thursday of each month, to repair the outrages to the divine face of the Lord. Domínguez and Corral began to carry a portrait of the Holy Face for prayers in which ecstasy occurred.

Domínguez claimed to suffer stigmata of the Holy Wounds during his visions, such as a cross-shaped cut on his forehead and cuts on his hands. These visions and stigmata, according to Domínguez himself, also occurred in the boarding house in Seville where he lived. At one point he revealed a 10-centimeter cut on his side, which was a supposed stigmata, representing where Jesus Christ had been pierced in his side by Roman soldier Longinus with the Holy Lance. On 16 July 1970, a supposed Marian apparition told him that the waters from a well in the area were miraculous and that it produced healings. A mastic tree in the area became the main location associated with some of the visions and on 2 February 1970, the believers put a picture of the Holy Face on it (in Palmarian discourse this is called the &quot;Sacred Place of the Lentisco&quot;). A large number of people were drawn to El Palmar de Troya, with 40,000 people witnessing one of Domínguez&#x27; mystical ecstasies and his stigmata. On 2 February 1970 they put a photo of the Holy Face in the mastic and on 2 March 1972, an image of the &quot;Divina Pastora&quot; was blessed. The Virgin of Palmar was placed in the mastic on 12 September 1972. On 8 February 1971, there was a reported apparition of Jesus Christ in the mastic to encourage the faithful who gathered at the farm.

With the duo of Domínguez and Corral now the people most closely associated with visions at Palmar; the former the visionary stigmatist and the latter the one who wrote down, copied and distributed the information; they set about spreading the message far beyond Spain. The visions were translated into English, French and German languages and the newsletter, &quot;Ecos del Palmar&quot;, was published from Barcelona by supporter Jóse María Andreu Magri from 1972. In the early 1970s, as well as receiving donations form ordinary Catholic followers, they gained some substantial benefactors. Most notably, the Baroness de Castillo Chirel, then 90 years old, a devout Catholic woman who had been a follower of Garabandal, gave Domínguez and Corral a donation of 16 million pesatas in 1972 (worth roughly €1.8 million in 2023). As part of their quest to spread the message, throughout the 1970s, the duo, often joined by their ally, Carmelo Pacheco Sánchez (1948–1997), they travelled throughout Spain and Western Europe, before eventually making annual trips across the Atlantic to Latin America and the United States. The traffic was not all one way, as pilgrims came to visit El Palmar de Troya from many different countries in the Catholic world, with Irish people and German-speaking people (Germans, Austrians and Swiss people) being overrepresented.

They went to Rome several times, first on 8 July 1970, where Clemente jumped over a barrier, avoiding Swiss Guard, to keel before a precession of Pope Paul VI and present a letter (taken by a priest). Corral claimed later the Palmarians met with Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani who informed Paul VI. Earlier, on 27 December 1969, they attempted to deliver a letter to the Spanish head of state, Francisco Franco, asking him to read a secret from God to the Spanish nation as part of his end-of-year speech. The duo turned up at &quot;El Pardo&quot; unannounced and &quot;ad hoc&quot; meetings were not accepted, they were instead directed to deliver the letter to his private secretariat in the &quot;Palacio de Oriente&quot;. Stopping off to pray at a Carmelite church on the way, Domínguez had a vision of the Virgin Mary who told him he had been deceived by the devil and to not deliver the letter. Another substantial benefactor, gained during their trips to the United States, was the business woman Marguerite Mary Paul (1921–2001) from Necedah, Wisconsin and her husband. By 1974 Domínguez and Corral were able to purchase the 15,000 square meter plot of land at &quot;La Alcaparroa&quot;. Following an alleged apparition of Jesus Christ on 30 May 1975, the devotees of Palmar were requested to construct a sanctuary at &quot;La Alcaparroa&quot;. Along with the money from donors, a loan was taken out from the Central Bank of Utrera in the name Francisco González, Carlos Girón and Manuel Alonso.

====Foundation of the Carmelites of the Holy Face====

Although there were a few ordained priests of the Roman Catholic Church who were supporters of Our Lady of Palmar and the direction taken by Domínguez and Corral, the majority of those associated with the movement were at that point laymen, as were most of the pilgrims. The nucleus of an organisation began to develop through cenacles (prayer-groups), where the participants referred to themselves as Marian Apostles, or Apostles of the Cross (also Cross Bearers). On 30 November 1975, just ten days after the death of Spanish head of state, Francisco Franco, Domínguez claimed to have a vision of Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary, announcing that a new religious order would be founded by the Palmarians. This order would be a synthesis of &quot;the best&quot; elements of all previous Catholic religious orders and they were to be the &quot;Apostles of the Last Times&quot; (a reference to the prophesies of Louis de Montfort, a noted Mariologist). With Domínguez himself as General, the order was revealed to the world as the Order of the Carmelites of the Holy Face on 22 December 1975. It was announced that it would have four classes; priests, brothers, sisters and tertiaries, laypeople, each wearing a Carmelite habit and a brown scapular, with the images of the Holy Face of Jesus and Our Lady of Palmar.

A major issue that facing the order at the beginning was that it wished to have more ordained priests and indeed consecrated bishops (both Domínguez and Corral wanted this for themselves in particular, as they were officially laymen). They could not rely on the assistance of the local ordinary, Cardinal José Bueno y Monreal, of the Archdiocese of Seville, due to his blanket opposition to anything to do with El Palmar de Troya. Nevertheless, it was ideologically important for the Carmelites of the Holy Face, to receive legitimate holy orders using the old rite of ordination, from a verifiable bishop of the Catholic Church with (in the Catholic view) undoubted apostolic succession, in communion with Pope Paul VI. The most visible bishop publicly associated with traditionalists was Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre of the Society of St. Pius X and the Palmarians had a significant sympathiser within the society, in the form of Maurice Revaz, a canon of the Swiss Abbey of Grand-Saint-Bernard who was teaching at the International Seminary of Saint Pius X at Écône, Switzerland. Revaz asked Lefebvre if he would go to El Palmar de Troya for this purpose, but he declined, pointing them instead to the exiled Vietnamese Archbishop Ngô Đình Thục with the words &quot;He is orthodox and he is not at present occupied. Go and seek him out. He will most certainly agree with your request.&quot;
Revaz, along with the McElligotts, an Irish Palmarian family who had property in Switzerland, drove from Switzerland to Rome to approach the Vietnamese archbishop. Revaz and Thục were already familiar with each other as they had both previously met as pilgrims to El Palmar de Troya in 1974. The background of Archbishop Ngô Đình Thục is that he was previously made the Archbishop of Huế, Vietnam by Pope John XXIII, but due to the 1963 South Vietnamese coup d&#x27;état which killed several close members of his family, he was living in exile in Rome. In 1968, Paul VI had made him the Titular Archbishop of Bulla Regia. Outraged by the murder of his relatives and deeply anti-communist, he was in good standing in Rome but increasingly disillusioned with their &quot;diplomatic&quot; approach to communism and started to draw closer to traditionalism in his exile. Revaz convinced Thục that the Virgin Mary sent him to render her a service and that they must leave immediately to Andalusia, he agreed and the party took a three-day car journey to El Palmar de Troya and Thục was celebrating the Pontifical High Mass there with the Carmelites of the Holy Face by Christmas Eve 1975.

While in El Palmar de Troya, on 31 December 1975, without the permission of the local ordinary at Seville, Thục ordained five men of the Carmelites of the Holy Face to the priesthood, conferring holy orders on the two Spaniards; Clemente Domínguez (who took the religious name Ferdinand) and Manuel Alonso Corral (who took the religious name Isidore), the two Irishmen; Paul Gerald Fox (who took the religious name Abraham) and Francis Coll (who took the religious name Gabriel), as well as the Frenchman; Louis Henri Moullins (who took the religious name Zacarias). Following this, the now Father Ferdinand claimed to have a vision from the Virgin Mary declaring that the Carmelites of the Holy Face needed to have bishops consecrated and as proof of this an alleged miracle was performed, as she had placed the Infant Jesus in his hands (invisible to the human eye), which Domínguez then passed to Archbishop Thục, who supposedly felt the weight of the Infant in his hands and agreed to the consecrations. On 11 January 1976, in a five-hour ceremony through the night, Thục consecrated five Palmarians to the episcopacy, including two men who he had just ordained as priests (Domínguez and Corral), in addition to three priests who had previously been ordained to the priesthood by the Roman Catholic Church, before the visions of Our Lady of Palmar; Camilo Estévez Puga (1924–1997; a Spaniard also known as Leandro), Francis Bernard Sandler (1917–1992; an American Catholic convert from Rabbinic Judaism who was a Benedictine and had served as a parish priest in Sweden, also known as Fulgencio) and finally Michael Thomas Donnelly (1927–1982; an Irish priest from Belfast from the Company of Mary, who within two months left the Palmarians).
The Vatican, through first Cardinal Bueno, then their Nuncio to Spain Luigi Dadaglio and finally Franjo Šeper&#x27;s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, quickly moved against Thục and the Palmarians. They did not question the validity of the orders as such, but essentially declared that they were canonically illicit or irregular, due to not having permission, that they were &quot;ipso iure&quot; suspended from exercising their powers and &quot;ipso facto&quot; excommunicated. The Palmarians for their part, declared their loyalty to Pope Paul VI and argued that the claim of excommunication was illegitimate, claiming that in 1938, Pope Pius XI had granted Archbishop Thục the special power to ordain priests and bishops without requiring further permission. Regardless, in the eyes of the Palmarians, the Roman Curia was categorised as being packed with masonic infiltrators, who were supposedly drugging Pope Paul VI and holding him hostage in the Vatican. In relation to this, Domínguez had another vision in January 1976, where it is claimed Jesus Christ told him to consecrate more bishops and create an episcopal college for Pope Paul VI to come and govern the church from El Palmar de Troya. With Thục now fading into the background, the Palmarians under their own initiative between the years 1976 and 1978 had consecrated 91 additional bishops (mostly Irish and Spaniards, over 40% split almost evenly between these two nationalities, with the rest from mostly German-speaking Europe, as well as English, Nigerians, Argentines, Australians and many more different nations).

In May 1976, a major incident occurred while five Palmarian bishops were returning from a trip to Derval, Brittany, France, as there was a serious automobile crash in the Basque Country. The glass from the windshield shattered and went into the eyes of the General of the Order, Domínguez. Not only was he completely blinded by the incident, but the damage was such that he had to have his eyeballs surgically removed at San Sebastián hospital. The party had gone to Derval to deal with a crisis where a couple of Palmarian bishops there had gone across to the mystic, Pierre Poulain. According to the Palmarians, the devil attacked the car, after Poulain cast a black magic spell on his rival Domínguez. The Spanish media began to call him the &quot;blind-seer.&quot; After months of silence, Domínguez reported a vision of Jesus Christ in September 1976, in which Christ is quoted as saying &quot;No one should think that the palm-tree is lying down. It is more upright than ever because victory is found in the passion and crucifixion. Then comes the resurrection.&quot; Christ is then quoted as saying that he is preparing Domínguez to be a future Pope. God had thus allowed the blinding as a trial, a test of faith and a cross to bear, if he prevailed, he would prove himself worthy of the Papacy.
===The Holy See at El Palmar de Troya===
====Reign of Pope Gregory XVII the Very Great====

Pope Paul VI died on 6 August 1978 and according to the Palmarians (who consider him a Christian martyr), the Pope was supposedly &quot;vilely murdered by the traitors of the Roman Curia&quot; (specifically, they claim he was poisoned to death by Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Jean-Marie Villot). At the time of his passing, the General of the Order of the Carmelites of the Holy Face and other top Palmarian bishops, were in Bogotá, Colombia, as part of their regular trips across the Atlantic Ocean to see to their followers and attempt to recruit more clergy. While waiting to be deported from Colombia, a few hours after the death of Pope Paul VI, Domínguez reported an apparition, in which a mystical papal coronation ceremony took place, where he was crowned Sovereign Pontiff of the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church by Jesus Christ himself, with Peter and Paul in attendance, as well as the recently deceased Pope Paul VI. Although confessing to be but a poor sinner, from now on he would be referred to by Palmarian believers as Pope Gregory XVII and the Holy See of the Catholic Church would no longer be in Rome, but in El Palmar de Troya. The motto he took was &quot;Gloria Olivae&quot;, drawn from the Prophesy of the Popes, a Christian apocalyptic writing.

After returning to Seville, Domínguez held a consistory which selected a Palmarian College of Cardinals, with 24 Palmarian bishops raised to rank of Cardinal, including his close friend Corral. Having kept details of the &quot;celestial&quot; papal enthronement from the press, the public papal coronation ceremony took place on 15 August 1979, where four Palmarian cardinals (including Corral) placed the papal tiara on his head. Domínguez had claimed since the early 1970s that Pope Paul VI would be succeeded by a true Pope and an Antipope. Thus, when the Vatican declared Albino Luciani as their new Pope on 26 August 1978, he was portrayed in a Palmarian Papal pronouncement by Pope Gregory XVII as a usurper, &quot;that clown of an Antipope, Cardinal Luciani, called John Paul I&quot; with his &quot;false smile&quot;. The Vatican for their part decided to merely inaugurate Luciani, eschewing over 800 years of papal coronation ceremonies. This supposed Vatican &quot;Antipope&quot; was in place for only a month before being replaced by Karol Wojtyła, also known as John Paul II (In his &quot;Twenty-Fourth Document&quot; on 24 October 1978, Domínguez used his claimed authority to &quot;excommunicate and anathematise the Antipope Cardinal Wojtyla&quot;, who is described as a &quot;marxist spy&quot; who infiltrated the church as a youth, stating in addition, &quot;we hurl excommunication also at all followers of this Antipope&quot;). The reigns of Pope Gregory XVII in El Palmar de Troya and John Paul II in the Vatican were closely synchronised, both lasting from 1978 until 2005. These Roman &quot;Antipopes&quot; were called precursors of the Antichrist by the Palmarians.


From 1978 until 1997, Palmarian Church leadership consisted of the following: Pope Gregory XVII at the very top, with the role of Secretary of State held by Cardinal Isidore (Corral) underneath and the number three position in the hierarchy was held by the Vice-Secretary of State, Cardinal Elias (Carmelo Pacheco Sánchez). All three were Spaniards, which led to some complaints from the membership, but they simply insisted that they were the most suitable men for the jobs as &quot;three apocalyptic bulls who attack heretics with their mystical horns.&quot; The dynamic was that the Pope was the charismatic visionary and seer, while Corral, who he relied on to record everything, was the intellectual &quot;éminence grise&quot;. Some of the Palmarian bishops and laymen were unwilling to take the leap of accepting the claims of Domínguez to the Papacy and the Holy See moving to El Palmar de Troya, deciding to leave (some reconciled with Rome, others drifted away from religion). Some examples include Palmarian bishops, Maurice Revaz (who took the religious name Hermenegildo) and Alfred Seiwert-Fleige (who took the religious name Athanasius). Domínguez and twelve Cardinals in 1979 made an apostolic journey from El Palmar de Troya to the Holy Land, passing through places outside of Spain which had a significant number of Palmarian faithful such as Switzerland, Austria, Germany, Liechtenstein, France, Great Britain and Ireland.

Between 1978 and 1980, a total of forty-seven pontifical documents were published, before the opening of the First Palmarian Council. These covered the canonisation of over 1,000 new saints, the promulgation of various Mariological and Josephine dogmas, excommunications of &quot;heretics&quot;, anathemas against freemasonry (especially), communism and capitalism, declarations of new Doctors of the Church, declaring as anathema anyone who &quot;dare to condemn the marvelous work of the Holy Inquisition,&quot; calling on all nations to enact the death penalty for abortion (a &quot;monsterous crime&quot;), condemnations of the Vatican &quot;Anti-Papacy&quot;, declaring the New Order of Mass anathema and stating that although the Holy Ghost convoked the Second Vatican Council, he was expelled from it by the majority of apostate bishops who were agents of freemasonry and even though some Catholic truths were present in the documents, due to Pope Paul VI being &quot;drugged&quot; and questions as to the authenticity of his signature on the documents, these aspects alone &quot;invalidates the Council.&quot;
Within the Palmarian Catholic Church, the First Palmarian Council (1980–1992) is recognised as the 21st ecumenical council of the Catholic Church, following on from the Council of Trent (1545–1563) and the Vatican Council (1869–1870), with the supposed &quot;Second Vatican Council&quot; having been declared as invalid. At the opening session on 30 March 1980, the &quot;Palmarian Credo&quot; was published, which lays out the basic teachings of the Church. As part of the council, the &quot;Latin-Tridentine-Palmarian Rite&quot; of the Holy Mass was introduced on 9 October 1983. The final doctrinal work resulting from the twelve-year Council was the &quot;Treatise of the Mass&quot; (1992). This work takes the form of an allegorical interpretation of sacred scripture from the context of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, including the lives of Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary, elaborated by the visions of Pope Gregory XVII, as well as integrating the works of Catholic mystics of a Marian apocalyptic bent, such as Maria de Jesús Ágreda (1602–1665) and Anna Katharina Emmerich (1774–1824).

A significant incident occurred on 19 May 1982, which furthered the conflict between Palmarians and the outside world. Pope Gregory XVII and a number of Palmarian bishops were visiting the Basilica of the Annunciation of Our Lady of Discalced Carmelites of Alba de Tormes, near Salamanca, which is the final resting place of St. Teresa of Ávila. Before the arrival of the Palmarians, there had been rumours spread that they intended to remove the relics of St. Teresa and take them back to El Palmar de Troya. While walking through the convent, the allegedly drunk Pope, along with his Palmarian bishops, shouted that John Paul II was an Antipope and told visiting women who were wearing trousers (considered immodest dress by the Palmarians) that they were whores. The Palmarian clerics were then set upon by a large number of local people, who attacked some of the bishops and tipped one of their vehicles into the River Tormes; they took refuge in the convent until the &quot;Guardia Civil&quot; could disperse the mob. As a direct response, between 30 and 31 July 1982, Pope Gregory XVII issued a number of decrees which stated that only Palmarians could receive grace and indulgencies from holy relics and images, but for members of &quot;apostate, heretical and schismatic churches&quot;, such powers were now withdrawn, veiled to them and they could derive no supernatural value. They also declared that outside of the Palmarian Catholic Church, all powers of bishops, presbyters and deacons were now withdrawn by Pope Gregory XVII, meaning that outside of the Palmarian Church, no other alleged clergyman with holy orders could validly claim to exercise their power or have the right to legitimately perform any act of priestly ministry, including those pertaining to the holy sacraments of the Church.

====&quot;The Sacred History&quot; and the Great Expulsion====

The Church leadership was shaken in 1997, as the number three and four in the Palmarian hierarchy: the Vice-Secretary, Fr. Elias María (Carmelo Pacheco Sánchez) and Fr. Leandro María (Camilo Estévez Puga) had died within two months of each other (Pacheco died in an automobile incident, hit by a truck). With this the Pope lost two of his stalwart supporters and most trusted advisors, which affected him deeply. Fr. Sergio María (Ginés Jesús Hernández), another Spaniard, who had been an electrician became the number three in the Church. Pope Gregory XVII reported a vision in 1997 where the Prophet Elias allegedly appeared to him and said that the enemies of God (elsewhere described as &quot;Jews and Masons&quot;) had at various historical junctures, distorted the pure word of God, which had originally been announced in the world by his Holy Prophets and that these groups had instead introduced adulterations, simulations and falsifications, which had distorted the original texts of sacred scripture (including in what would become the &quot;Latin Vulgate&quot;, traditionally favoured by the Catholic Church) and that its contents must thus be purified to &quot;remove errors&quot; and allow the doctrinally infallible, &quot;purified Bible, full of light&quot; to be accessible to mankind for the Last Times. The process in which this &quot;purified&quot; Bible, later to be called the &quot;Sacred History or Holy Palmarian Bible&quot; (2001), would be brought forward, was known as the Second Palmarian Council and it ran from between 1995 and 2002.

As part of this reviewing process, members of the Palmarian Church, including the clergy, were asked to hand in their old Catholic bibles based on the &quot;Vulgate&quot; or the &quot;Septuagint&quot; to be destroyed (which some opposed, saying that if they did so they could not even study &quot;Treatise of the Mass&quot;, which references it throughout). During this time, there had been a decline in numbers in the Palmarian Church and even among those who remained a significant number of believers, both religious (bishops and nuns) and sympathetic laymen, began to quietly doubt the Pope&#x27;s mental health and conduct, questioning in particular the orthodoxy of the proposals of the Second Palmarian Council on the Bible (to be &quot;purified&quot; with &quot;The Sacred History or Holy Palmarian Bible&quot;) and other aspects, considering them rash changes. This group also raised concerns about the more intense application of the Palmarian Moral Code (also known as &quot;The Norms&quot;), which they accused of moving the Palmarian Church away from the traditional moral and pastoral Catholic theology to a coercive rigorism, which induced extreme scrupulosity and forced family members to cut off all communications (i.e. - social shunning) with those who had been &quot;legitimately excommunicated&quot;, rather than seeking their reconciliation through dialogue with those who had fallen away.
As the Palmarian Catholic Church had moved toward the new millennium, the first signs of an internal issue had begun to emerge on 30 March 1995, as the Palmarian Cardinalate was suppressed, meaning there would not be a conclave after the Pope&#x27;s death. As the decade wore on, the dissident Palmarians began to discuss their concerns secretly among themselves, with burner phones and the like to hide their communications, though control over members had increased by this time, with strict rules on personal conduct beginning to be brought in. Indiscreet communications led to the Palmarian leadership uncovering the dissident network. Fr. Sergio (Ginés Jesús Hernández) made his mark by playing a role in their &quot;unmasking&quot;. A knife that was discovered in one of the rooms of the dissidents was presented to the Pope as part of a conspiracy to murder him. Fearful of a &quot;coup&quot;, the Pope proclaimed on 24 October 2000, that Fr. Isidore (Corral) was to be his Papal successor.

Finally, on the 5 November 2000, the matter of the dissidents came to a head: eighteen Palmarian bishops and seven Palmarian nuns were anathematised and excommunicated, expelled from the property and declared ex-Palmarian. Ex-Fr. Isaac María (José Antonio Perales Salvatella), the former confessor to the Pope was declared as the heresiarch in chief, a new Martin Luther, as a &quot;founder of an anti-church or tenebrous sect&quot;, leader of a conspiracy to overthrow the Pope. Many members of this group moved to Archidona, near Málaga and continued to proclaim themselves as Palmarians, but now sedevacantist, claiming that the Pope had fallen into error and lost the Chair of St. Peter. Some even set up in Paraguay for a while. Others, such as, Ex-Fr. Guido María (Robert McCormack) and Ex-Fr. Dámaso María (Juan Marquez), moved away from Palmarianism completely, declaring it a fraud and accusing the Church of perpetuating psychological abuse, with the dawning of the internet became vocal anti-Palmarian activists.

====Palmarian Catholic Church in 21st century====

Following the death of Pope Gregory XVII in 2005, as his Palmarian Secretary of State, Manuel Alonso Corral (Fr. Isidore María), automatically ascended to the Palmarian Papacy. He chose as his Papal name, Pope Peter II, which had so far been avoided by Catholic Popes since the time of Peter the Apostle. Having been the discreet intellectual power behind the throne of the previous Pontificate, not claiming any visions himself, Pope Peter II&#x27;s Papacy was mostly defined around defending Palmarian Orthodoxy in Papal documents. Though he did in 2006 define as dogma the doctrine of the birth of the Antichrist into the world at the millennium and the circumstances of his birth to the “Anti-Mary.” The &quot;leitmotif&quot; of his Papacy was a deeper sense of Palmarian identity over national ones and a more rigorous focus on the need to uphold “&quot;The Norms&quot;”, with Palmarians increasing required to cut themselves off from the &quot;moral depravity of the surrounding world&quot;, for the Palmarians, a “world totally dominated by Satan.” During this time, the Palmarian Church did not actively seek to grow its membership and avoided even having an internet presence, suffering from members leaving and also a shortage of religious vocations. Pope Peter II died on 15 July 2011, after a long illness.

Fr. Sergio María (born Ginés Jesús Hernández), as the previous Palmarian Secretary of State under Pope Peter II, ascended to the Palmarian Papacy next in 2011 as Pope Gregory XVIII. Lacking the charisma of Domínguez and the intellectual polish of Corral, Pope Gregory XVIII was instead characterised as a “managerial Pope”, an administrator, rather than a visionary or theologian and looked to uphold the basic teachings of traditional Palmarian Catholicism. His style was highly authoritarian and militaristic, characterised by some critics as “unpredictable” and “angry”. During the early years of his Pontificate, strengthening &quot;“The Norms”&quot; even further was of central focus and this became increasingly hardline and controversial, with a harder stance on shunning family members who became apostates (including splitting up families, as well as expelling teenagers from homes), regulating that Palmarian schoolchildren should not play or talk with non-Palmarian classmates and making it an excommunicable offense to leave property in a will to apostates or “public anti-Palmarians.”

In terms of religious developments in the reign of Pope Gregory XVIII, in 2012, the annual celebration of Palmarian Holy Week was moved to a permanently fixed date, with Holy Friday always falling on 25 March, inline with the teachings of &quot;The Sacred History or Holy Palmarian Bible&quot;. An extensive six-volume Palmarian &quot;Lives of the Saints&quot; was published and the Cathedral-Basilica of Our Crowned Mother of Palmar would be completed by 2014. In 2012, Pope Gregory XVIII had declared a &quot;Third Palmarian Council&quot;, which mostly focused on codifying issues relating to &quot;“The Norms”&quot;. Internet use was banned in 2012 and the Pope claimed that, “newspapers, radio, TV and the Internet&quot;, were controlled by &quot;Freemasons and Zionists.” Between 2013 and 2016, publications were less frequent from the Palmarian Papacy, typically focusing on defending Palmarian claims and critiquing the statements of Francis in the Vatican, or &quot;Antipope Pancho&quot;, in the words of Pope Gregory XVIII. Toward the end of his reign, in 2016, claiming to be following the Roman model of the Swiss Guard, Pope Gregory XVIII set up his own Palmarian Papal Guard, consisting mostly of German-speaking Palmarians, they dressed in red berets and khaki uniforms reminiscent of the Carlist &quot;requetés&quot;. In the last few months of his reign, Pope Gregory XVIII relaxed some of the harshest rules in a document entitled &quot;The Easing of Several Norms&quot;, citing &quot;morbid scruples&quot; some of the rules had driven the laity to and eschewing &quot;extremism.&quot;
There was a major defection on 22 April 2016, as Pope Gregory XVIII announced that he was abdicating from the Palmarian Papacy due to losing the faith. The Papacy passed automatically to his Palmarian Secretary of State, Fr. Eliseo María (born Joseph Odermatt). A Swiss Palmarian and the first non-Spanish Palmarian Pope, he took Pope Peter III as his Papal name. It transpired that Ex-Pope Gregory XVIII had been involved in a relationship with an ex-Palmarian nun, Nieves Triviño and had absconded from El Palmar de Troya to marry her. Hernández was declared “Ex-Pope Gregory XVIII the Apostate” by the Palmarian Church, accusing him of stealing assets belonging to the Church and being extremely vainglorious, stating he was corrupted by lust (comparing him to the decadent Borgia Pope Alexander VI), stating also that a Pope should be a father not a tyrant. Although acknowledging that no heresy was to be found in the &quot;Third Palmarian Council&quot;, Pope Peter III declared that it had now been erased, as it had instituted many more “unnecessary Norms”, that Hernández was motivated by pride. This essentially rolled back &quot;The Norms&quot; to where they were in 2011. Hernández spoke to the Spanish media, including &quot;El País&quot;, defending himself and downplaying his mistress, claiming that, through study he had concluded that the original apparitions of Our Lady of Palmar had been genuine, but that they had been hijacked by Clemente and Manolo for financial manipulation.

A serious incident occurred on 10 June 2018 at the Cathedral-Basilica of Our Crowned Mother of Palmar in El Palmar de Troya. While most religious were inside celebrating Holy Mass, two would-be thieves in balaclavas scaled the walls of the compound with a telescopic ladder, armed with a knife, two clown masks, cable ties, duct tape, two pairs of pliers and a crowbar. They were disturbed outside of the Cathedral-Basilica by a Palmarian bishop, Fr. Silvestre María, who was then attacked with a crowbar by the assailants, the noise from the struggle was overheard by another Palmarian bishop, Fr. Jesús María, who came to his assistance. It turned out that the two thieves were Ex-Pope Gregory XVIII the Apostate and his wife, Nieves Triviño. All four parties were injured, but Hernández received a knife wound to the chest with the very knife he had brought, requiring evacuation by helicopter to a hospital in Seville. The struggle had draw the attention of the other Palmarians from inside who called the &quot;Guardia Civil&quot; and the &quot;Servicios de Emergencias Médicas&quot;. After his condition was stabilised, Hernández underwent an extensive legal prosecution, eventually being convicted and sentenced to six years for “armed robbery, grave assault and assault” and Triviño for five. Ultimately, the duo were required to pay a large fine to the Palmarian bishops and their sentences were suspended.

Under Pope Peter III, initially, the new Palmarian Secretary of State was Fr. Benjamin María (Manuel Ambrosio Sánchez) and the Vice-Secretary of State was Fr. Abraham María (Paul Fox), a veteran Irish Palmarian who had been a Palmarian from the earliest days. Despite the chaotic circumstances of his ascent to the Papacy, the less erratic style of the Swiss Pontiff has seen an expanding public profile for the Palmarian Catholic Church. Part of the reason for the renewed global interest was a result of the novelist Dan Brown publishing the fictional book &quot;Origin&quot; in 2017, which places the Palmarian Church as the main protagonist. The Palmarian Church also established an online presence as part of its evangelisation projects, with a website in numerous different languages and opened accounts from 2019 onward on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, YouTube and TikTok, allowing the general public to view its religious beliefs, modes of worship and public works. During the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, there were a number of positives cases in the compound, including 4 deaths due to the virus, which drew media attention. Fr. Benjamin María was demoted as a consequence on 13 February 2021, with Fr. Abraham María raised to Palmarian Secretary of State and Fr. Jesús María (Alfredo Leonardo Villalba), an Argentine former military policeman raised to Palmarian Vice-Secretary of State.

==Doctrine==
===The Triune God===

According to Magnus Lundberg, the Palmarian Church &quot;on a basic level, follows the Trinitarian teachings in the &quot;Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed&quot; (325/381), and the further Christological definitions at the &quot;Councils of Ephesus&quot; (431) and &quot;Chalcedon&quot; (451).&quot; The Palmarian Catholic Church professes Trinitarian Christianity, with the &quot;Palmarian Credo&quot; laying out their belief in the one God, the Triune God, one in essence, with three persons; the Eternal Father, the Son (or the Divine Word) and the Holy Ghost. As a result of the Second Palmarian Council, held between 1995 and 2002, in which the &quot;Vulgate&quot; was &quot;purified&quot; as &quot;The Sacred History or Holy Palmarian Bible&quot;, the primary religious text of the Church, the Palmarians explicitly centre in this Bible, the Triune God as the supreme overarching truth of universal history and by name mention the Triune God and its three persons in the &quot;purified&quot; &quot;Book of Genesis&quot; onward (in the &quot;Old Version&quot; of the Old Testament, used before the Second Palmarian Council, this was far more ambiguous). One of the central devotions practiced by the faithful in the Palmarian Catholic Church is the Holy Trisagion to the Most Holy Trinity.

In its Christology, the Palmarian Church teaches that the &quot;human&quot; soul of Jesus Christ was created by God before anything in the material universe and that this was followed immediately by the creation of the soul of the Holy Virgin Mary. In this, the Palmarians in a limited sense borrow from and somewhat rehabilitate Origen of Alexandria, who taught that the souls of all intelligent being were created before the universe. This concept is an essential element of one of the central Palmarian doctrines; the &quot;Mystical Espousal of Christ and Mary&quot;. The Palmarian Church and its Bible teaches that their souls were spiritually espoused from the very beginning and state that there were other theophanies in history; they claim that the soul of Jesus Christ assumed the body of Melquisedec, Priest and King of Salem (Jerusalem) and that the Holy Virgin Mary&#x27;s soul assumed the body of his chaste wife, Essenia, Queen of Salem (the Essenes play an important role in Palmarian historiography and are seen as synonymous with the Carmelites). Aspects of the teaching, symbolised by the union of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary, are to be found in the writings of St. Jean Eudes, St. Marguerite-Marie Alacoque and 20th century French visionary Jeanne-Louise Ramonet.

===Most Holy Virgin Mary===
In its doctrine and devotional practices, the Palmarian Church places a strong emphasis on the Blessed Virgin Mary. They state &quot;It is common among Palmarians to love the Most Holy Virgin Mary intensely. This is a point where no discussion is allowed.&quot; The established greeting when two Palmarian faithful meet each other is, &quot;¡Ave María Purísima!&quot; (Hail Mary Most Pure) and the response, &quot;sin pecado concebida&quot; (conceived without sin). Just as the Roman Catholic Church historically proclaimed as infallible doctrine, certain teachings about the Blessed Virgin Mary, such as the &quot;Immaculate Conception&quot; (1854) under Pope Pius IX and the &quot;Assumption of Mary&quot; (1950) under Pope Pius XII, the Palmarian Pontiffs have declared as infallible other Marian maximalist teachings. On 12 August 1978, Pope Gregory XVII in his &quot;Second Document&quot; proclaimed as further infallible doctrines, binding on all the faithful, four major Marian teachings; Mary, &quot;Mediatrix of All Graces&quot;, &quot;Co-Redemptrix&quot;, &quot;Queen of Heaven and Earth&quot; and &quot;Mother of the Church.&quot;

The Palmarian Church teaches that the Eternal Father formed the soul of the Blessed Virgin Mary before the creation of heaven and earth. One of the proclaimed infallible doctrines, with great significance for Palmarian soteriology, elaborated by the Church is the &quot;Mystical Espousal of Christ and Mary&quot;: as part of this doctrine it is taught that a particle of Christ&#x27;s Sacred Heart and a drop of his Most Precious Blood was &quot;enthroned&quot; within her and likewise, a particle of Mary&#x27;s Immaculate Heart and a drop of her blood was &quot;enthroned&quot; within him. This has implications for sacramental theology. Linking in with this, the Palmarians teach that through baptism, the baptised receives a drop of Mary&#x27;s blood, washing away original sin, which is strengthened by confirmation. Committing a mortal sin causes the blood drop to disappear, requiring confession to a priest to re-enter a state of grace. In 1982, Pope Gregory XVII proclaimed as infallible doctrine the real presence of both Jesus Christ and Blessed Virgin Mary in the Blessed Sacrament of the Eucharist. This doctrine is not completely novel, having precedents in the Catholic theological writings of some 17th century Franciscan and Jesuit authors, such as Cristóbal de Vega (1595–1672) in his &quot;Theologia Mariana&quot;.

===Holy Saint Joseph===

As with more in-depth doctrinal teachings on the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Palmarian Church has lauded the greater emphasis on Saint Joseph and his nature as a member of the Holy Family in more recent times, which began in 1870 with Pope Pius IX proclaiming Saint Joseph &quot;Patron of the Universal Church&quot; and Pope Leo XIII issuing the encyclical &quot;Quamquam pluries&quot; in 1889. In addition to this, Pope John XXIII added the name of Saint Joseph to the Roman Canon in 1962 and according to the Palmarians, he &quot;professed great love for Most Glorious Saint Joseph.&quot; All three of these Roman Pontiffs have been canonised as saints by the Palmarian Catholic Church. During the reign of Pope Gregory XVII, in his &quot;Third Document&quot; issued on 13 August 1978, the Palmarian Pontiff proclaimed infallible doctrines on the nature of Saint Joseph; the &quot;Presanctification of Joseph&quot;, the &quot;Assumption of Joseph&quot; and &quot;Father and Doctor of the Church&quot;.

The Palmarian teachings on Saint Joseph are included in the &quot;Credo&quot; and thus must be publicly professed by all believers. The teachings on the nature of Saint Joseph are inherently tied to his relationship to the Blessed Virgin Mary and thus Jesus Christ. The Palmarian Church proclaimed as doctrine in 1978, that Saint Joseph was pre-sanctified in the womb of his mother in the third month after his conception. The significance of this pre-sanctification is that from this point on he was freed from the stain of original sin. Thus, unlike the Blessed Virgin Mary&#x27;s Immaculate Conception, his existence was not immaculate from the point of conception, but by the time he was born into the world he was born without the ability to commit any sin during his existence, as a worthy spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary (the &quot;Second Eve&quot;). The Palmarians teach that Saint Joseph remained a virgin throughout his life and never questioned the perpetual virginity of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The Palmarian Church also declared as doctrine that the year after the resurrection of Christ, Saint Joseph was resurrected and assumed into heaven, in body and soul.

===Eschatology===
As with the Roman Catholic Church historically, the Palmarian Church teaches that immediately after death, the soul of each human being is brought before Jesus Christ and receives a particular judgement, where they are judged by God based on their lives, they are accused with the sins that they committed (and whether or not they died in a state of sanctifying grace), their devotion and loyalty to God and membership of his One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church. The Palmarians teach that those who die in a state of sanctifying grace are sent to the Planet of Mary, where sin is absent and the Church Triumphant waits here for the final battle against Antichrist. Likewise, the godless are sent to the Planet of Lucifer, where they are under the leadership of Satan, awaiting the final battle. In the afterlife, following death, heaven, hell, purgatory and limbo are understood as different states, rather than physical locations.

Supposedly, before the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, comes the Antichrist. An in-depth and specific account of the Antichrist is given in the &quot;Palmarian Catechism&quot;. The Palmarian Church teaches that a Beast of a woman, consecrated to Satan is brought up, as an Anti-Mary (the antithesis of the Blessed Virgin Mary), a false virgin from a Jewish background. Both Satan and the Virgin Mary appear before her, as she is given the choice over becoming Satan&#x27;s mother, with the former arguing for and the latter against, using her free will, the Anti-Mary chooses in the affirmative. She joins a &quot;Jewish religious group involved in Satan worship&quot; and eventually becomes their leader. In a great Masonic Lodge, elaborately decorated with an inverted crucifix, she copulates on the altar with an apostate ex-Palmarian Bishop, dressed in his clerical attire. Described as &quot;extraordinarily beautiful and seductive&quot;, upon the completion of the act of fornication, the Anti-Mary immediately strangles the ex-Bishop and kills him (whereby he goes straight to hell). The Antichrist; Satan; is immediately conceived in the flesh and all of hell rejoices. The entire ceremony is witnessed by a group of leading 33rd degree Freemasons.
The Church teaches a chronology of the apocalypse, based on the &quot;Book of Revelation&quot; and supplemented by visions received by Pope Gregory XVII the Very Great, as presented in the &quot;Sacred History&quot; and the &quot;Palmarian Catechism&quot;. Palmarians believe the world is now in the end times, signified by the supposed Great Apostasy of Rome from the Catholic faith, through compromises with Protestantism and Freemasonry, with the Vatican-based Church becoming the Great Whore (as informed by Marian prophesies from Our Lady of La Salette onward). Thus, according to the Palmarian Church, the Antichrist was born in Jerusalem in the year 2000 and made a brief entry in the world in 2012. Physically, the False Messiah appears to be a man, but is literally Satan in the flesh and will persecute the true believers (the Palmarians). An epic final battle, the Armageddon, between Good and Evil will take place on Earth, whereby the inhabitants of the Planet of Mary and Planet of Lucifer return to fight for their respective sides. The wicked lose the contest and are cast into hell.

The Palmarian Church teaches that, not long after this conflict, the bodies of the dead are raised and Jesus Christ returns to Earth in the Second Coming, where the final judgement of each individual human being takes place. He returns at Jerusalem, but is visible from all over the world. At the conclusion of the final judgement, there will be only two destinations; the just, the elect who are saved, will be directly enthroned into the Sacred Heart of Christ, beholding the beatific vision and will live in glory in a blissful and heavenly state forever. Meanwhile, the wicked and the damned are enthroned into the dark heart of Satan, where they are to burn in hell, body and soul, tormented by demons for all eternity.

==Traditions==
===Documents and texts===
Within the Palmarian Church, building on from the pre-1978 Magisterium of the Catholic Church, there is a heavy emphasis on documents which lay out the Palmarian Catholic teachings since then, which it considers the authentic continuation of the Catholic Magisterium. The Palmarian Church does not allow its religious works to be publicly sold for profit, but instead distributes them among its members free of charge, however, in the information age, many of these documents are now freely available on the internet for anybody to access. The core texts of the Church, following the move of the Holy See from Rome in 1978, are the Papal documents of Pope Gregory XVII, released between 1978 and 1980 (every Pope since has released documents, but these in particular are considered pivotal), the &quot;Palmarian Creed&quot; (1980), the &quot;Treatise of the Mass&quot; (1992) which was the end product of the First Palmarian Council and the &quot;Sacred History or Holy Palmarian Bible&quot; (2000–2001), the end product of the Second Palmarian Council, a reworking of the Catholic Bible. In addition to this, there is a &quot;Palmarian Catechism&quot;, which lays out the teachings for the faithful and a &quot;Palmarian Devotionary&quot;, which lays out the central pious practices and modes of worship.

As explained by professor Magnus Lundberg (Uppsala University), in 1997 Clemente Domínguez claimed that Elijah had appeared to him, claiming that the current Bible is &quot;filled with errors that had been introduced by Judeo-Masonic groups through the centuries&quot; and that it was his mission to revise it. Therefore, after 4 years of work, the Holy Palmarian Bible was published in five volumes in 2001, followed by a smaller two-volumes versions and an illustrated version for children. According to Lundberg, the changes were &quot;dramatic&quot;: entire parts of the biblical books were omitted and numerous parts are &quot;almost unrecognizable due to the allegorical and apocalyptical interpretations, which Gregory [i.e. Clemente Domínguez] claimed reflected the original intentions of the divine author. All of this makes the work very different from the traditional Bibles, both in structure and content&quot; states Lundberg. The Bible used by the Palmarian Christian Church is not available in public libraries. In 2018 Lundberg scanned one of the English versions and later published it on his blog.

===Holy Sacrifice of the Mass ===
The very first proclamation of the Pontificate of Pope Gregory XVII, on 8 August 1978, reestablished the &quot;Holy Latin Tridentine Mass of St. Pius V&quot; as the obligatory liturgical form and anathematised the Mass of Paul VI as &quot;confused, ambiguous, equivocal and heretical&quot;, forbidding the Palmarian Catholic faithful from serving at it, as well as forbidding the faithful from receiving the Holy Eucharist in the hand or standing. The reason given for this was to emphasise the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass as a propitiatory sacrifice, the sacrifice of Calvary, something which it claimed the New Order lacked (as well as being &quot;elaborated and confected by heretics&quot;). Palmarian Papal documents pillory the New Order as a &quot;Lutheran supper&quot;, suggesting the Vatican is now compromised by Protestant theological precepts.

On 22 July 1980, Pope Gregory XVII reported a vision in which Pope Pius V appeared and advised him to make some alterations to the Tridentine Mass that he had originally promulgated in his papal bull &quot;Quo primum&quot;. From this year onward, their Mass began to be called the &quot;Latin-Tridentine-Palmarian Rite&quot;. Finally, on 9 October 1983, the Apostolic Constitution and Dogmatic Definitions promulgated the &quot;Holy Palmarian Mass of His Holiness Pope Gregory XVII&quot;. This briefer Mass, based on the Tridentine, is concentrated to three &quot;essential&quot; parts; the offertory, consecration and sacrificial communion, making it around five minutes long. Therefore, Palmarian Catholic clergy do not celebrate an individual Mass, but numerous turns of Masses. The underlying reason for this revision, was that with so few Catholic priests in the world celebrating valid Masses, because of the introduction of the &quot;illegitimate&quot; (in Palmarian eyes) Novus Ordo and with so much atonement to God to be made for the sins of corrupted humanity, reducing the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass to its bare essentials would enable the sacrificing priesthood to be able to say many Masses consecutively. This was in light of the First Palmarian Council and the &quot;Treatise on the Mass&quot;.

According to Palmarian doctrine, the body, soul and blood of Christ is present in the consecrated bread and wine. In addition to this, the Virgin Mary is spiritually and really present in the Holy Eucharist, as her suffering at the foot of the cross is seen as an essential component of the sacrifice of Calvary, which the Mass is as a propitiatory sacrifice. To communicate a person must be in a state of grace; otherwise, it constitutes a sacrilege. Communion should only be taken on the tongue and the recipient must be kneeling when receiving the sacrament. The communion of the faithful is only received in one species; they only receive the Eucharistic bread. If due to long distances to the nearest Palmarian priest, it is not possible to attend Mass, the faithful should pray a penitential rosary instead. According to the precepts of the church, Palmarians should take communion at least every third month, but almost all Masses in the Basilica in El Palmar de Troya are celebrated without lay people taking communion. Still, if in a state of grace, a layperson is allowed to communicate several times per day.

==Organisation and members==
===The Palmarian Popes as Vicars of Christ===

The Palmarian Church considers the Patriarchate of El Palmar de Troya to be the current Holy See of the Catholic Church and as part of this considers the legitimate apostolic predecessors of the Palmarian Pope to be all of the recognised Roman Pontiffs from Peter to Pope Paul VI. After this time, it considers Rome to have fallen into apostasy and all claimants in the Vatican City from Albino Luciani onwards to be non-Catholic Antipopes and &quot;precursors to Antichrist&quot;. The Palmarian Church claim that, following the death of Pope Paul VI in 1978, Jesus Christ mystically elevated Clemente Domínguez to the papacy as Pope Gregory XVII and from this point on the Holy See has been located in El Palmar de Troya. The full title used by the Palmarian Pope is &quot;Sovereign Pontiff, Vicar of Christ, Successor of Saint Peter, Servant of the servants of God, Patriarch of El Palmar de Troya, Herald of the Lord God of Hosts, Aflame with the Zeal of Elias.&quot; Other titles used by the Palmarian Pontiff include &quot;King of the Universe&quot;, &quot;Caudillo&quot; and the &quot;Great Tagus.&quot;

To date, there have been four Popes in El Palmar de Troya and the current incumbent is Pope Peter III, since 2016. So far in the history of the Palmarian Church, the Secretary of State, who is selected by the sitting Pope, has been crowned as Papal successor following the death or vacation of the Papacy by its previous occupier (this has precedent from before 1059 in the Catholic Church when a Pope often had a hand in directly selecting his successor). The Palmarian Church had a College of Cardinals between 1978 and 1995, however it was never required to select a Pope in a conclave.

===Church Militant: friars, nuns and seculars===

Living, active members of the Palmarian Church; whether religious or laymen; must be formally enrolled into the religious order of the Palmarian Church known as the Order of the Carmelites of the Holy Face in Company of Jesus and Mary (Spanish: &quot;Orden Religiosa de los Carmelitas de la Santa Faz en Compañía de Jesús y María&quot;). This, as with many historical Catholic religious orders, is organised into three distinct aspects: the friars, the nuns and the seculars (members of the Palmarian laity who belong to the third order). Thus, in the Palmarian Catholic Church, actively engaging with the spirit of the Order is essential, regardless of vocation and laxity not a possibility. Exact up to date numbers for those currently belonging to one of the three bodies of the Carmelites of the Holy Face (and thus Palmarian Catholic Church) are hard to come by, however, in a sermon delivered in August 2011, the then reigning Pope Gregory XVIII claimed that there were between 1,000 and 1,500 members. Between the years 1976 and 2005, there were 192 men consecrated to the priesthood and ordained to the episcopate during the Pontificate of Pope St. Gregory XVII the Very Great (thus belonging to the Friars of the Carmelites of the Holy Face), but by 2016, the number active was supposedly down to 32 bishops. In the same year, the number of Sisters of the Carmelites of the Holy Face was around 40 nuns.
Through the Carmelites of the Holy Face, the mystical Carmelite Charism is of great significance for Palmarians; members of the Third Order wear a large variation of the Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel with the Holy Face of Jesus on one side and the unified Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary on the other. The men from the order dress in Carmelite brown while attending El Palmar de Troya at feast days and for the religious “Carmelite” as a liturgical colour for certain feasts has been added by the Palmarian Church to its Rite. In their religious documents, the Palmarians accept the traditional mystical narrative of the Carmelites as having been founded by the Prophet Elias on Mount Carmel (succeeded by the Prophet Eliseo). In following with, Daniel a Virgine Maria (1615–1678) against the critical claims of the Bollandists, they claim that the Elian Carmelite heritage was identical with that of the Essenes. In their Bible, the &quot;Sacred History or the Holy Palmarian Bible&quot;, they call many Prophets direct predecessors, “Superior General of the Essenes”, the Israelite “Caudillos” of the Maccabees are also presented as Essenes/Carmelites. The Palmarians glorify the Teresian Reform of St. Teresa of Ávila and St. John of the Cross from the Carmelites of the Ancient Observance into the Discalced Carmelites and consider themselves the true heirs of this tradition. Clemente and Manolo met Mother María de las Maravillas de Jesús, a significant conservative figure of the Spanish Discalced Carmelites and claimed that she told them, &quot;You, one day, will guide the sacred destinies of the Church.” They in turn canonised her as a saint on 17 September 1978 in the &quot;Fourteenth Papal Document&quot; of Pope Gregory XVII.

Over the years, there have been Palmarians active in many different countries all over the world. In the late 1990s, there were Palmarian chapels in the following place (typically in the homes of lay members); in Spain (El Palmar de Troya, Seville, Granada, Bermeo, Hernani, La Bañeza, Barcelona, Gran Canaria, Madrid, Oliva, Sabadell, Santander &amp; Valencia), in England (London, Southport &amp; Manchester), in Scotland (Hamilton), in Ireland (Belfast, Dublin, Gorey, Thurles &amp; Portaferry), in Italy (Cengles village of Lasa &amp; San Candido), in Germany (Augsburg, Berlin, Bottrop, Delbrück, Grafing bei München, Kempten, Mainz, Niederschopfheim, Nonnenbach &amp; Unterschwandorf), in Switzerland (Aadorf, Andermatt, Jaun &amp; Oberwil), in Liechtenstein (Triesenberg), in Austria (Böhlerwerk, Hollenstein, Kitzeck, Leonding, Ludersdorf, Mittlern, Oberperfuss, Salzburg, Sollenau &amp; Virgen), in Poland, in Russia, in the United States (Arkdale, Chicago, Livingston Manor, Sonoma, Tacoma &amp; Yelm), in the former Netherlands Antilles (Bonaire &amp; Curaçao), in Australia, in New Zealand, in Argentina (Buenos Aires, Arequito, Deán Funes, Santa Fe, Mar del Plata, Mendoza, Sierra Chica, Tandil &amp; Villa Diamante), in Paraguay (Julián Augusto Saldívar, Ciudad del Este &amp; Villa Elisa), in Peru (Huancayo, Lima, Pisco, Piura &amp; Santa Rosa), in Venezuela, in Nigeria (Abatete, Abuja, Akpim, Asaba, Awkuzu, Enugu, Ihitta Ogada, Lagos &amp; Nguru Mbaise), Kenya (Nguru Dawida, Ngange Nyika, Taveta, Migwani &amp; Wudany), in the Philippines (San Ramón) &amp; in Brazil (Aracaju, Atibaia, Buerarema, Belo Horizonte, Ilhéus, Passo Fundo, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo &amp; Vitória).

===Church Triumphant: saints of the Palmarian Church===
The Palmarian Catholic Church counts among the saints of the Catholic Church, those canonised before 1978 by the Roman Catholic Church, but in addition, have since canonised over 1,000 more saints since that time. Many of those who they canonised, had already been beatified by previous Pontiffs. The first document dedicated to a Palmarian Papal canonisation proclaimed by the Palmarian Church was that of Padre Pio in the &quot;Tenth Document&quot; of Pope Gregory XVII on 12 September 1978. Many more canonisations have taken place since, particularly between 1978 and 1980, mostly within the Papal documents of Pope Gregory XVII. The most complete recorded collection of names of Palmarian saints is covered in the &quot;Palmarian Lives of the Saints&quot; (2012).

Among those proclaimed saints by the Palmarian Church, include a large number of previous Popes, including the following from modern times: Pope Pius IX, Pope Leo XIII, Pope Pius XI, Pope Pius XII, Pope John XXIII and Pope Paul VI. Historical Catholic rulers, particularly monarchs were canonised including: Charlemagne, Philip II of Spain, Pelagius of Asturias, Alfonso X of Castile, Isabel I of Spain, Mary, Queen of Scots, Élisabeth of France, Charles of Austria and Ferdinand the Holy Prince, but also a president of a republic: Gabriel García Moreno (from Ecuador). In addition to this, the Palmarian Church canonised Christopher Columbus, who, sponsored by the Catholic Monarchs is popularly known as a leading figure in the European Discovery of the Americas, led by the Spanish Empire (the entire &quot;Twenty-Eighth Document&quot; of Pope Gregory XVII is dedicated to this).

One large category of people who were canonised, literally hundreds of named people, are the Martyrs of the Spanish Civil War (or in official Palmarian parlance, the &quot;Holy Martyrs of the Holy Crusade Against Marxism in Spain&quot;), which included a large number of bishops, priests and nuns who were killed during the Red Terror in Spain. Aside from this, an &quot;inumerable’ group of people&quot;, who fought on the nationalist side in the war were canonised, including a number of explicitly named political figures, including: Francisco Franco (&quot;Caudillo&quot; of Spain), Luis Carrero Blanco, José Antonio Primo de Rivera and José Calvo Sotelo. Although categorising the war as a crusade, Pope Gregory XVII stated that not everybody who died on the nationalist side was a martyr or motivated by the defence of Christianity. In 1980, the Palmarian Church declared that Francisco Franco was now a co-patron saint of Spain, alongside James the Great and Teresa of Ávila.
There were other large groups of people who were canonised from certain periods of history, including an &quot;innumerable&quot; group of Irish Catholic Martyrs who died in defence of the Catholic faith under Anglo-Protestant rule. Closely related to this were the Catholic Martyrs of England and Wales who were martyred during the 16th and 17th centuries under Protestantism, the names of many of whom are listed as canonised the Papal documents of the Palmarian Church. Missionaries who in the Far East who died for the Catholic faith were also canonised in groups, such as the Martyrs of China, the Martyrs of the Boxer Rebellion and the Martyrs of Indochina (including Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia). The Martyrs of the French Revolution are listed, including a large number of people who were killed by the revolutionaries around the time of the War in the Vendée and in the September Massacres, as well as the Martyrs of Orange.
Saints from modern times canonised by the Palmarians includes: Faustina Kowalska, Maximilian Kolbe, Josemaría Escrivá and Teresa Benedicta of the Cross. Various Catholic mystics, seers and visionaries, particularly those associated with Marian and apocalyptic themes, were also canonised, including: María de Jesús de Ágreda, Anna Katharina Emmerich, Marie Julie Jahenny, Anna Maria Taigi, the seers of Fátima (Francisco and Jacinta Marto), the seers of La Salette (Maximin Giraud and Mélanie Calvat), as well as the medieval Ramon Llull.

An internet hoax claiming that the Palmarians had canonised Adolf Hitler originated on a fabricated Palmarian blogging site and was disseminated through Wikipedia and other media; the Palmarian Catholic Church has denied the claim. According to the religious studies scholar Magnus Lundberg, the leadership of the Palmarian Catholic Church treat the continued spread of the hoax as evidence that the media and the internet have been coopted by enemies of the church.

==Social and cultural issues==
===&quot;The Norms of Christian Decency&quot;===

In the Palmarian Catholic Church, for members to remain in good standing with the Holy See they are required to adhere to and uphold compulsory moral norms, ranging from standards of dress to media consumption and matters of social interaction, which are laid out in what is called &quot;&quot;The Norms of Palmarian Christian Decency&quot; (abbreviated as &quot;The Norms&quot;&quot;). Violations of the Norms were initially treated as a mortal sin, but by the early 2000s became an excommunicable offense, cutting the offender off from the community and depending on severity, required either their confessor or the Pope to lift it. The Norms were first published in 1985 by Pope Gregory XVII, but has expanded over time. In their documents, including during the reign of Pope Peter III, the Palmarians argue that in upholding these Norms, they are only doing what the Catholic Church has always done, with the Supreme Pontiff having the authority in Catholic moral theology of &quot;binding and loosing&quot; (to pass judgement on matters of Church discipline relating to faith and morals). They point to the &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot; (Index of Forbidden Books), which was enforced from 1560 to 1966 and claim that modern society is far more corrupt and depraved today, thus requiring even stricter rules to guard morality.

In matters of dress, the Palmarians are required to dress modestly, to avoid occasions of sin. The standards are laid out in a publicly available document, which even non-Palmarian visitors to the Cathedral-Basilica of Our Crowned Mother of Palmar are required to comply with. Men must wear long trousers (shorts are not permitted, only boys under 14 years old are permitted to wear short trousers below the knee), shirts must be long-sleeved and completely buttoned up, no designs or lettering are allowed and none of these items may be too close fitting. Denim cloth was once completely banned, but is now just banned in Church buildings (the same applies to sports shoes). Women are required to wear dresses or skirts at all times (trousers are categorised as men&#x27;s clothing and to wear them is considered transvestitism). Dresses have to be long-sleeved down to the wrist and at least up to the base of the neck (no low necklines are allowed and when seated nothing of the knees must be shown, these cannot be close fitting). The same applies to skirts and blouses. Women must wear stockings up to the knee, girls under 14 may wear socks. To enter Church, women must wear a veil (this is commonly in the mantilla-style). This dress code must be adhered to regardless of place or temperature.

Among other things, Palmarians may not frequent places categorised as indecent, such as public swimming baths, beaches, discos and night clubs. Voting in elections is banned. Palmarians may not attend any non-Palmarian religious services, including any social functions connected to them. Palmarians are discouraged from social interaction with those not dressed according to the Norms and while at work, with non-Palmarians, are encouraged to only discuss matters relating to the job at hand (since 2016, this has been relaxed as social contact by phone or letter with non-Palmarians is permitted). The only reading material allowed is religious books approved by the Holy See in El Palmar de Troya (in recent times Pope Peter III has permitted a small number of adventure books for light entertainment). Apostates from the Palmarian Church may not be contacted at all, all photos of Ex-Palmarian clergymen must be destroyed. It is not permitted to contact persons living in adulterous relationships (including cohabiting relationships). Sex education is not permitted, contraception is banned (including natural family planning), courtship and marriage must be with another Palmarian only. Men and women must sit separately in Church. During the reign of Pope Peter II, Palmarians were instructed to destroy their TV sets, videos, mobile phones and internet to protect themselves from the &quot;repugnant moral leprosy rampant in the world.&quot; In more recent times, in a limited fashion, mobile phones and internet are permitted. Having an organ transplant or leaving organs to be transplanted is banned. Birthday candles on cakes, Christmas trees and lights are banned, whereas Nativity scenes are encouraged. Parents may instead give their children presents on Epiphany (also known as Little Christmas), on 6 January instead, but they cannot say they are from &quot;Santa Claus&quot;.
===Pronouncements on political philosophies===
The Palmarian Church has made public statements in Papal documents on various political philosophies and where relevant, has condemned what it holds as contradicting the Catholic faith and an integralist Christian social order. Above all, the great &quot;bête noire&quot; in Palmarian pronouncements on modern society and politics is Freemasonry. The term is used beyond the narrow scope of literal freemasons in Masonic Lodges and extends to all philosophical and political expressions of liberalism. Freemasonry, which is portrayed as Satanic in nature, is accused of being the origin of both capitalism and communism, which, in their own ways, undermine God, the Christian conception of society and erect in its place a secularised and materialist world. Within this scheme, Protestants and others &quot;heretical sects,&quot; are supposedly allied with unconverted Jews against the Mystical Body of Christ.

Pope Leo XIII, declared &quot;the Great&quot;, has been canonised and proclaimed a Doctor of the Church by the Palmarian Church and they champion his Catholic social teaching based on &quot;Rerum Novarum&quot;. Pope Gregory XVII anathematised and excommunicated the &quot;errors of capitalism.&quot; He declared that these errors had &quot;brought corruption&quot;, that many capitalists belonged to masonry, that many capitalists invest money in support of pornography and anti-Christian propaganda. The Palmarian Church teaches that capitalists can be denied communion of the Blessed Sacrament if it is publicly known that they defraud their workers of a fair wage (as one of the sins that cry to Heaven for Vengeance). The Palmarian Church condemned Marxism and declared that they &quot;excommunicate all the members of the Church affiliated with Marxism or Communism, and as well all sympathisers with the perverse doctrine; also whoever engage in dialogue with those who declare themselves to be militant atheists,&quot; hundreds of Catholics persecuted by communists have been canonised by them, including Cardinal József Mindszenty and Pope Gregory XVII consecrated Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary on 22 August 1978. The Palmarians also condemned the &quot;evil national socialism of Hitler&quot; and its &quot;anti-Christian character&quot; (for its &quot;racial idolatry and omnipotence of the state&quot;) and it has canonised Catholics persecuted by them such as Rupert Mayer, Titus Brandsma, Maximilian Kolbe and Teresa Benedicta of the Cross.
===Teachings on non-Palmarian religions===

In stark contrast to post-Vatican II Rome, the Palmarian Church is strongly opposed to religious liberty, ecumenism and interreligious dialogue (all of which are portrayed as a Masonic conspiracy, launched by Satan himself). Within the &quot;Twenty-Eighth Document&quot; of Pope Gregory XVII, it explicitly states that &quot;Popes should launch holy Crusades against the heretics, until either they are converted or disappear persecuted to the ends of the earth. He who permits the adoration of false gods or the practice of false religion stands opposed to God.&quot; A long list of &quot;false&quot; positions generally and religious views are systematically condemned in the Papal documents of the Palmarian Church. The Palmarians state that there has been excessive abuse of the phrase &quot;separated brethren&quot; to describe sects which broke away from the &quot;true&quot; Catholic Church, leading to confusion, thus these groups should be referred to instead as heretics (i. e. — Protestants) and schismatics. It admits, that, of all sects outside of the Catholic Church, the Orthodox are doctrinally the closest, but contain errors, that they need to accept the &quot;filioque&quot; and that they should be called the &quot;Heterodox Church&quot; until they change this and unite themselves under the universal jurisdiction of Supreme Pontiff at El Palmar de Troya. A particularly strong scorn for ex-Palmarians and &quot;Apostate Rome&quot; is present throughout their teachings (both portrayed as villainous traitors).
Non-Christian worldviews and religious teachings such as atheism, paganism, &quot;Mohammedanism&quot; (though Palmarian Popes have stated that Catholics should match their fanatical dedication to religion) and Rabbinic Judaism are also condemned. &quot;Nostra aetate&quot; from the invalidated Vatican II is reverse engineered in the &quot;Fourth&quot; and &quot;Thirty-Eighth Documents&quot; of Pope Gregory XVII, which proclaims that &quot;unconverted Jews&quot; are explicitly the &quot;deicide people&quot; and &quot;perfidious&quot; until they become Catholic. Despite this strong criticism, Pope Gregory XVII admitted to some Jewish admixture in the Spanish nation (and likely in his own distant ancestry) and did not see this as problematic. Leading only to further justification for a fervent endorsement of Spanish nationalism; for Domínguez, Spain could legitimately claim a connection to the Old Covenant Israelites through the Sephardim and now that had been superseded by the New Covenant of Jesus Christ, the Spanish nation remained loyal to God as the zealous bulwark of the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church through the Reconquista, into the Counter-Reformation, fending off Protestantism and Freemasonry, and now had been gifted the Papacy at El Palmar de Troya, after the apostasy of Rome itself.

The Palmarian Church claims that the Pope has supreme spiritual power and temporal power, all the world being subject to him, that the Pope can distribute lands, depose kings and appoint kings. Citing as a clear historical example of this, it points to Pope Pius V&#x27;s &quot;Regnans in Excelsis&quot; in which he excommunicated and deposed Elizabeth Tudor (&quot;pretended Queen of England&quot;). As part of their eschatological beliefs, the Palmarian prophesies, linking in with the concept of the Great Catholic Monarch, foretells of the literal establishment of a great Hispanic-Palmarian Empire, over which the Palmarian Pope will reign as Emperor and fight the Antichrist. A specific Palmarian exercise of the power to depose and appoint kings, is denoted in the &quot;Twenty-Eighth Document&quot;, in which Pope Gregory XVII admits that Pope Hadrian IV had granted Ireland to England as an evangelising power, but the moment the English Crown fell into heresy, it forever lost sovereignty over her and now &quot;since Ireland has no Catholic King, the Pope holds direct power over her until he provides a Catholic king.&quot;

<text>&quot;Eritrea, Eritrea, Eritrea&quot; () is the national anthem of Eritrea. Adopted in 1993 shortly after independence, it was written by Solomon Tsehaye Beraki and composed by Isaac Abraham Meharezghi and Aron Tekle Tesfatsion.

== History ==
The lyrics of the anthem were written by poet Solomon Tsehaye Beraki. Originally written in 1986, Solomon updated them in 1993 after Eritrea&#x27;s independence. The music was composed in 1985–1986 by organist Isaac Abraham Meharezghi (also spelt Isaq), who was a member of the Eritrean People&#x27;s Liberation Front cultural troupe.

<text>Paula Aiko Nakayama (born October 19, 1953) is an American lawyer who served as an associate justice of the Hawaii State Supreme Court from 1993 to 2023. After Rhoda V. Lewis, Nakayama is second woman to ever serve on the Hawaii State Supreme Court. She is also the first Asian American woman to serve as a state supreme court justice nationwide. Currently serving her third term, Nakayama served her first term from 1993 to 2003 and her second term from 2003 to 2013.

==Early life and education==
Nakayama is the daughter of Harry Nakayama, a WWII veteran of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, and Harriet Nakayama, who were both born and raised on Maui. At a young age, Nakayama moved to San Jose, California where she graduated from Blackford High School. She then went on to study at the University of California at Davis where she obtained her bachelor&#x27;s degree in consumer economics. She obtained her doctorate of jurisprudence at the Hastings College of Law.

==Career==
In 1979, Nakayama joined the staff of the Prosecuting Attorney of Honolulu as a deputy prosecutor. In 1982, she joined the law firm Shim, Tam, Sigal and Naito where she became a partner.

In 1992, Governor John D. Waiheʻe III appointed Nakayama to the Hawaii State Judiciary as a circuit court judge. Confident of her skill, the governor elevated Nakayama to the Hawaii Supreme Court in 1993 — the first woman on the court in 26 years. The Hawaii Judicial Selection Commission retained and reappointed Nakayama for a second term in 2003 and for a third term in 2013. She retired from active service on April 21, 2023.

Nakayama&#x27;s notable written opinions include her 1996 opinion that ruled policyholders can sue insurance companies for acting in &quot;bad faith&quot; for delaying payment of claims, and her 2000 majority opinion rejecting part of the state water commission&#x27;s landmark decision that divided Waiahole Ditch water between Windward and Leeward Oahu, which reaffirmed the state&#x27;s commitment to the public trust doctrine &quot;to protect, control and regulate the use of Hawai&#x27;i&#x27;s water resources for the benefit of its people.&quot;

==Personal life==
Nakayama is married to attorney Charles Totto, who formerly served as executive director of the Honolulu Ethics Commission.

<text>The Second City is an improvisational comedy enterprise. It is the oldest improvisational theater troupe to be continuously based in Chicago, with training programs and live theaters in Toronto and New York. Since its debut in 1959, it has become one of the most influential and renowned in the English-speaking world. In February 2021, ZMC, a private equity investment firm based in Manhattan, purchased the Second City.

The Second City has produced television programs in both Canada and the United States, including &quot;SCTV&quot;, &quot;Second City Presents&quot;, and &quot;Next Comedy Legend&quot;. It has been a starting point for many comedians, award-winning actors, directors, and others in show business, including Del Close, Alan Alda, Alan Arkin, Harold Ramis, Bill Murray, Gilda Radner, John Candy, John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, Eugene Levy, Catherine O&#x27;Hara, Dave Thomas, Chris Farley, Tim Meadows, Colin Mochrie, Ryan Stiles, Mike Myers, Nia Vardalos, Steve Carell, Jordan Peele, Tara Strong, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Keegan-Michael Key, Stephen Colbert, Steven Yeun, Cecily Strong, Lauren Ash, Ron Pederson, Ann Pornel, Sam Richardson, Amber Ruffin, Jason Sudeikis, and Aidy Bryant.

== History ==

The Second City chose its self-mocking name from the title of a series of articles about Chicago by A. J. Liebling, published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1952, and published in book form as a collection the same year. In summer 1955, at The Compass bar in Hyde Park, University of Chicago students, led by David Shepherd and Paul Sills, calling themselves Compass Players, began a &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;, based on professional theater games taught by Viola Spolin, who was Sills&#x27;s mother. They soon began performing occasional shows on the Near North Side. On December 16, 1959, The Second City&#x27;s first revue show premiered at 1842 North Wells Street, with Sills&#x27;s former wife and Compass Player Barbara Harris singing &quot;Everybody&#x27;s in the Know&quot;. Admission was $1.50 (). Sahlins and Sills flipped burgers in the kitchen.

Sahlins, Sills, and Howard Alk had founded the theater, in 1959, as a place where scenes and stories were created with improvisation, using techniques that grew out of Spolin&#x27;s innovative teachings, later known as Theater Games, with Sills as its director. The cabaret theater comedy style of the Second City tended towards satire and commentary on social norms, and political figures and events.

In 1961, the theater sent a cast to Broadway with the musical revue, &quot;From the Second City&quot;, directed by Sills and earning Tony Award nominations for ensemble members Severn Darden and Barbara Harris. The company moved a few blocks south, to 1616 North Wells, in 1967. Eventually, the theater expanded to include three touring companies and a second resident company, and now fosters a company devoted to outreach and diversity.

In 2020, during the protests following the murder of George Floyd, The Second City faced several criticisms regarding racism. The CEO, Andrew Alexander, resigned after accusations of institutional racism from former performers and an alumnus were made. Accusations and allegations were also made on social media, triggering further leadership resignations. A notable criticism came from Second City alumnus Dewayne Perkins, who alleged that the institution initially refused to host a benefit show for Black Lives Matter unless half of the proceeds also went to the Chicago Police Department. In response to these issues, The Second City instituted changes, including the formation of a steering committee comprising representatives from BIPOC, Latinx, and LGBTQIA+ communities to foster inclusivity and diversity.

In October 2020, The Second City was put up for sale by Alexander and co-owner D’Arcy Stuart. In January 2021, The Second City and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; paired up to launch a new training scholarship for diverse, upcoming talent. In February 2021, ZMC, a New York City-based private equity investment firm, purchased The Second City.

In 2022, The Second City announced its expansion to New York with its new location in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The nearly entertainment complex at 64 N. 9th Street comprises two cabaret-style live theaters, seven Training Center classrooms, and a full-service restaurant and bar. The Second City New York opened to the public on November 16, 2023, marking a significant expansion of the institution into a new geographic region.

== &quot;SCTV&quot; ==

&quot;Second City Television,&quot; or &quot;SCTV,&quot; was a Canadian television sketch comedy show offshoot from the Toronto troupe of the Second City and ran from 1976 to 1984. Broadcaster and surgeon Charles A. &quot;Chuck&quot; Allard formed a partnership in 1981 that acquired the fledgling series. Allard then moved the series from Toronto to Edmonton, where he owned television station CITV-TV.

The basic premise of &quot;SCTV&quot; was based on a television station (later a network) in the fictional city of Melonville. Rather than broadcast the usual TV rerun fare, the business, run by the greedy Guy Caballero (Joe Flaherty) sitting in a wheelchair only &quot;for respect,&quot; operates a bizarre and humorously incompetent range of cheap local programming. The range included soap opera &quot;The Days of the Week&quot;; game shows, such as &quot;Shoot at the Stars&quot;, in which celebrities literally are shot at in similar fashion to targets in a shooting gallery; and movie parodies, such as &quot;Play it Again, Bob&quot; in which Woody Allen (as played by Rick Moranis) attempts to entice Bob Hope (as played by Dave Thomas) to star in his next film. In-house media melodrama was frequently satirized, including by John Candy, as the vain, bloated variety star character, Johnny La Rue; Thomas&#x27;s acerbic critic, Bill Needle; Andrea Martin&#x27;s flamboyant, leopard-skin clad station manager, Mrs. Edith Prickley; Catherine O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s alcoholic, narcissistic, former leading-lady, Lola Heatherton; and Flaherty&#x27;s effusive talk show host, Sammy Maudlin. Martin Short also originated his dorky Ed Grimley character here, which he later brought to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

==Executive producers==
===Andrew Alexander===
In 1974, Andrew Alexander took the reins of The Second City Toronto, which had opened in 1972, then formed a partnership with Len Stuart, in 1976, starting The Second City Entertainment Company. Its inaugural television production was &quot;SCTV&quot; that year. Alexander co-developed and executive produced over 185 half-hour shows for the series.

In 1985, Alexander and Stuart acquired Chicago&#x27;s Second City. He later founded SCTV, thereby expanding The Second City TV &amp; Film Division. He has produced or executive-produced hundreds of Second City revues in Canada and the United States.

On June 6, 2020, during the Black Lives Matter protests, various Second City comedians signed an open letter stating that &quot;erasure, racial discrimination, manipulation, pay inequity, tokenism, monetization of Black culture, and trauma-inducing experiences of Black artists at The Second City will no longer be tolerated&quot;. prompting Alexander to apologize and resign, pledging that &quot;The next person to fill the Executive Producer position will be a member of the BIPOC community&quot;. Interim executive producer Anthony LeBlanc was appointed to replace him.

===Jon Carr===
On November 25, 2020, The Second City announced that former Dad&#x27;s Garage Theatre Company artistic director Jon Carr had been hired as executive producer. He stepped down in early 2022, and a successor has yet to be named.

== Awards ==
, the Second City has been awarded thirty-seven Equity Joseph Jefferson Awards, which have recognized them for Best Revue five times, the first being &quot;Paradigm Lost&quot; (1997). The revue&#x27;s director, Mick Napier, is one of several directors recognized by the Jeffs, a list that includes founder Bernard Sahlins (for 1983&#x27;s &quot;Exit, Pursued by a Bear&quot;) and improv guru Del Close (1981&#x27;s &quot;Miro, Miro on the Wall&quot;). Sixteen alumni have received Jeff Awards for their performances in Second City revues, including David Pasquesi (&quot;The Gods Must Be Lazy&quot;, 1989), Scott Adsit (&quot;Paradigm Lost&quot;, 1997), Jackie Hoffman (&quot;Disgruntled Employee Picnic&quot;, 1993), Shelley Long (&quot;Wellsapoppin&quot;, 1977), and Nia Vardalos (&quot;Whitewater for Chocolate&quot;, 1994), with Rachel Dratch and Keegan-Michael Key each being honored twice.

In 2009, as the company was celebrating its 50th year, the Second City was awarded an honorary Jeff for the milestone, as well as three awards for the e.t.c.&#x27; s 33rd revue &quot;Studs Terkel&#x27;s Not Working,&quot; recognizing director Matt Hovde and actress Amanda Blake Davis and naming it Best Revue. In 2011, the e.t.c.&#x27;s 35th revue &quot;Sky&#x27;s the Limit (Weather Permitting)&quot; won the Jeff for Best New Work (Musical or Revue), as well Best Revue and Best Actor, for ensemble member Tim Baltz. The following year, the e.t.c.&#x27;s 36th revue &quot;We&#x27;re All In This Room Together&quot; won for Best Revue and Best Director of a Revue - Ryan Bernier, while ensemble member Edgar Blackman took home the Jeff for Best Actor/Actress in a Revue for his work in &quot;Who Do We Think We Are?&quot; on the Second City mainstage. In 2013, the Jeff Awards awarded Best Production: Revue to a Second City show not housed at the venue on Wells Street, &quot;The Second City Guide to Opera&quot;, a collaboration with the Lyric Opera of Chicago that had been initiated by soprano and Lyric creative consultant Renée Fleming, with Best Director: Revue going to Billy Bungeroth.

Toronto&#x27;s Second City mainstage troupe has won ten Canadian Comedy Awards: Best Improv Troupe (2001), Best Sketch Troupe (2001, 2006 and 2009), and Best Comedic Play winners &quot;Family Circus Maximus&quot; (2002), &quot;Psychedelicatessen&quot; (2003), &quot;Facebook of Revelations&quot;, &quot;Barack to the Future&quot; (2009), &quot;0% Down, 100% Screwed&quot; (2010) and &quot;Something Wicked Awesome This Way Comes&quot; (2011).

==Touring Company==
Created in 1967 as a way to increase the talent pool, the initial Touring Company, featuring Ramis, Doyle-Murray and Flaherty, was tested on the road for two years before taking the stage as &quot;The Next Generation&quot; after the mainstage ensemble was sent to perform in New York. The Touring Company continued to perform greatest hit shows on the road, and in 1982, with the assistance of producer Joyce Sloane (and without Sahlins&#x27;s knowledge) they staged an original revue in what would become the theater&#x27;s second stage, the Second City e.t.c.

==Fiftieth anniversary==
In December 2009, the theater celebrated its fiftieth anniversary with a weekend of panels and performance which featured many prominent alumni, including an &quot;SCTV&quot; reunion show starring Joe Flaherty, Eugene Levy, Andrea Martin, Catherine O&#x27;Hara, Harold Ramis, Martin Short, and Dave Thomas. Other notable alumni returning to participate included Steve Carell, Stephen Colbert, Jeff Garlin, Jack McBrayer, James Belushi, Dan Castellaneta, Amy Sedaris, Ian Gomez, Richard Kind, Robert Klein, Fred Willard, David Rasche, Betty Thomas, and George Wendt, as well as original cast member Mina Kolb, Compass Player Shelley Berman, and co-founder Bernard Sahlins, along with Playwrights Theater Club co-founder Sheldon Patinkin; he later served as assistant director to Paul Sills, then succeeded him as artistic director, spending over five decades as an artistic mentor of the troupe while chairman of the theater department at Columbia College Chicago for three decades.

== Alumni ==
==Training Center and The Second City Film School ==

The Second City Training Center was founded in the mid-1980s to facilitate the growing demand for workshops and instruction from the world-famous Second City theatre. Training Centers are located in Chicago, Toronto and Los Angeles. The Training Centers have grown substantially since the Second City Conservatory was established in the mid-1980s under the tutelage of longtime Chicago improv instructors and mentors Martin de Maat and Sheldon Patinkin. The Chicago Training Center has over 5,000 students in several disciplines, including improvisation and comedy writing. Former Training Center students include Steve Carell, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Mike Myers, Chris Farley, Tim Meadows, Bonnie Hunt, Stephen Colbert, Halle Berry, Sean Hayes, Amy Sedaris, Jon Favreau, Hinton Battle, Jack McBrayer, Dave Foley, and Kevin McDonald. Classes are taught by working professionals, many of whom are existing or former Second City performers. In 2007, the Comedy Studies program was created, as a collaboration with Chicago&#x27;s Columbia College, which provides students with an immersion in &quot;all aspects of the study of comedy and improvisation&quot;. In 2016, the Training Center expanded to include the Harold Ramis Film School, now called The Second City Film School, dedicated to comedy in filmmaking. In 2021, The Second City&#x27;s educators voted to unionize as the Association of International Comedy Educators (AICE).

==The Second City Detroit==
The Second City Detroit was a comedy theater and training center in Novi, Michigan. It was the Second City&#x27;s third mainstage location in North America following the Second City Chicago and Toronto. Originally established in September 1993 in downtown Detroit, it relocated to a strip mall in Novi in 2005. The original downtown Detroit theater in the Hockeytown Cafe complex was renamed the City Theater and has since reopened as the Detroit House of Comedy; the Novi location has become the Andiamo Novi Theater.

== The Parents School ==
In the early years of the Second City and Game Theater, several parents and Lincoln Park community members—including Carol and Paul Sills and activists Mona and Dennis Cunningham—started a progressive school for their children, based on Viola Spolin&#x27;s Theater Games techniques and philosophy with her son Paul Sills&#x27; refinements. Early on it was called &quot;Playroom School,&quot; after Spolin&#x27;s &quot;Educational Playroom,&quot; a progressive school project during the 1930&#x27;s on Sheridan Road which Paul Sills had attended. Theater Games were gaining recognition and are now incorporated in drama therapy, play therapy, and are used as an educational tool. Early Second City and Game Theater members, as well as some Old Town and Lincoln Park community members, were closely involved, including the Sillses and Cunninghams, Viola Spolin, Joyce and Byrne Piven, John Schultz, Mel Spiegel, Carol Dougal, and Beverly Gold. The highly progressive curriculum included daily theater games, and some students went on to careers in entertainment. Briefly at the Game Theater site at 1935 N. Sedgwick, the school moved to several locations in Lincoln Park before it closed in the mid-1970s.

== Other influences ==
In 1971, The Players Workshop was Chicago&#x27;s only official school of Improvisation for over a decade. Although it was never officially a part of The Second City cabaret theater, The Players Workshop was often referred to as Players Workshop Of The Second City, due to the school&#x27;s close affiliation with the famous sketch comedy stage.

<text>Michael Edward Tylo (October 16, 1948 – September 28, 2021) was an American actor.

==Career==
Among his numerous soap opera roles, he was best known for his portrayal of Quinton Chamberlain on &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. He played the role from 1981 to 1985 and again from 1996 to 1997. He was half of the very popular supercouple Quint and Nola, with the role of Nola played by actress Lisa Brown.

Tylo also appeared on the soap operas &quot;All My Children&quot; (as Matt Connolly), &quot;General Hospital&quot; (as Charlie Prince), and &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; as Blade Bladeson and Rick Bladeson. He also made a brief appearance in &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; (as Sherman Gale). In addition to soaps, Tylo has done several movie and television roles, including two seasons as Alcalde Luis Ramon in &quot;Zorro&quot; and as Dee Boot in &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;.

Tylo was a full-time professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, teaching in the film department of the College of Fine Arts. He appeared in several productions at the Nevada Conservatory Theatre, most recently in &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot;, &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; and &quot;Come Back, Little Sheba&quot;.

==Personal life==
Tylo was born in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Edward Tylo, a plumber, and his wife, Margaret.

He had three children with his second wife, actress Hunter Tylo: son Michael Edward Tylo II (April 24, 1988 - October 18, 2007), and daughters Izabella Gabrielle (November 12, 1996) and Katya Ariel (January 15, 1998), as well as a stepson, Christopher &quot;Chris&quot; Morehart (January 22, 1980), from Hunter Tylo&#x27;s first marriage to Tom Morehart.

In 1998, his infant daughter Katya was diagnosed with a rare cancer of the eye, retinoblastoma. Doctors removed the eye and began chemotherapy, but later in the year a tumor was detected in Katya&#x27;s other eye; to the amazement of her doctors, that tumor soon inexplicably disappeared. Katya recovered and wears a prosthetic right eye.

On October 18, 2007, nineteen year old Michael Tylo Jr. accidentally drowned in the family pool in Henderson, Nevada. The Clark County Coroner concluded that &quot;the cause of death was drowning due to seizure disorder,&quot; and was ruled accidental.

Tylo married his long-time fiancée Rachelle on January 10, 2010. They had two daughters; Kollette Tylo (born 2012) and Gianna Tylo (born 2015). Tylo died in Henderson, Nevada on September 28, 2021, at the age of 72.

<doc id="828050" wikidata="Q760132" url="?curid=828050" title="Warming up">
<text>&#x27;Warming up&#x27; is a part of stretching and preparation for physical exertion or a performance by exercising or practicing gently beforehand, usually undertaken before a performance or practice. Athletes, singers, actors and others warm up before stressing their muscles. It is widely believed to prepare the muscles for vigorous actions and to prevent muscle cramps and injury due to overexertion.

==Exercise==

A warm-up generally consists of a gradual increase in intensity in physical activity (a &quot;pulse raiser&quot;), joint mobility exercise, and stretching, followed by the activity. For example, before running or playing an intensive sport, athletes might slowly jog to warm their muscles and increase their heart rate. It is important that warm-ups be specific to the activity, so that the muscles to be used are activated. The risks and benefits of combining stretching with warming up are disputable, although it is generally believed that warming up prepares the athlete both mentally and physically.

==Stretching==

Stretching is part of some warm-up routines, although a study in 2013 indicates that it weakens muscles in that situation. There are 3 types of stretches: ballistic, dynamic, and static:

* Ballistic Stretches involve bouncing or jerking. It is purported to help extending limbs during exercise, promoting agility and flexibility.
* Static Stretches involve flexing the muscles. This may help preventing injury and permit greater flexibility and agility. Note that static stretching for too long may weaken the muscles. 
* Dynamic Stretching involves moving the body part in the desired way until reaching the full range of motion, to improve performance.

==Warming up in other contexts==
Psychologists, educators, singers, and similar professionals use warm-ups in therapeutic or learning sessions before starting or after a break; these warm-ups can include vocal and physical exercises, interactive and improvisational games, role plays, etc. A vocal warm-up can be especially important for actors and singers.

== Benefits ==

=== Preventing injury ===
There is contradictory evidence in terms of benefits of comprehensive warm-ups for preventing injury in football (soccer) players, with some studies showing some benefit while other showing no benefit. It has been suggested that it is specifically warm ups aimed at increasing body temperature, rather than targeting stretching, which can prevent injury.

=== Increasing performance ===
In baseball, warm-up swings using a standard weight bat are effective in increasing batting speed. In a 2010 meta-analysis, the authors concluded that in about four-fifths of the studies there was improvement in performance with various physical activities with warm-ups as opposed to without warm-ups. An increase in body temperature, specifically in the muscles, improves explosive skeletal muscle performance (e.g., jumping and sprinting).

<doc id="828054" wikidata="Q24568871" url="?curid=828054" title="Francisco Villa Museum">
<text>The Francisco Villa Museum (also, the Historical Museum of the Mexican Revolution) is dedicated to the life and times of the Mexican Revolutionary, Francisco &quot;Pancho&quot; Villa. The museum is in Chihuahua, Chihuahua, Mexico, and is housed in the former estate of General Francisco Villa and his widow, María Luz Corral de Villa.

==The property==
The Villa Museum and its extensive collection of memorabilia of Villa&#x27;s life, as well as souvenirs and documents relating to other revolutionary leaders, was turned over to the Mexican government in 1981 upon the death of Mrs. Villa. One may view the saddles of the &#x27;Centaur of the North&#x27;, as Villa was styled. These common saddles are known as the McClellan saddle, developed by General George Brinton. It was a reliable saddle and could fit any size horse. Also exhibited are his pistols in the armory, along with his bedroom, living quarters, and photographic memorabilia relating to his activities during the Mexican Revolution. The centerpiece of the collection in the courtyard is the bullet-ridden Dodge automobile in which he and his bodyguards were assassinated in 1923 in the city of Hidalgo del Parral in southern Chihuahua. He is reportedly buried in the Monumento a la Revolución in Mexico City.

==History==
The house was constructed between 1905 and 1907. It is in Chihuahua, Mexico, at 3010, Colonia Santa Rosa. By 1911 the house could no longer fulfill his needs. When Villa was governor of Chihuahua in early 1914, he began to remodel and enlarge the area making it a residence known as &quot;Quinta Luz&quot;, in honor of his wife, Señora doña Luz Corral.

The works of the remodeled house was made possible by Santo Vega, Hilario Berumen, Manuel Portillio, and Italian painter Mario Ferrer. It was remodeled into three sections: the main house where Villa stayed, the back house, and the courtyard.

By 1915 the house became abandoned because the family took refuge in the United States. After five years, Villa&#x27;s wife returned, reportedly because she missed her homeland, and Villa followed. He died in 1923 when he and his Centaurio del Norte bodyguards were assassinated in Parral.

Near the end of her life, Villa&#x27;s wife received visitors from bed, too weak to rise. In early 1981, Luz Corral, who was ill and too advanced in age to maintain the house, stipulated that when she died the house would be donated to the city, provided they turn it into a museum in honor of Villa. The Ministry of Defense accepted the offer. Mrs Villa died at age 89 on July 6, 1981.

Because of the poor state in which it was received, many restorations had to be made by the National Institute of Anthropology and History. The house re-opened on November 17, 1982. The office and music room were used to display the personal belongings of Villa. There are photographs and other personal belongings of Villa&#x27;s era. One exhibit is the car he was traveling in with his escort on the day he was assassinated. The curator of the museum is Adolfo Carrasco Vargas.

==Exhibits==
On the first floor of the museum are utensils and furniture that were commonly used by the Villa Corral family.

On the second floor are five showrooms. The Hall of Arms is where the weapons Villa used in many of his combat missions are displayed. Some of the weapons on exhibit include revolvers, rifles, machine guns, cavalry sabers, baskets, and leather cases with brass. There is a photograph of Rafael Mendoza, a native of Maderas, Chihuahua, who during the Mexican Revolution invented the first air-cooled machine gun, capable of firing 250 rounds per minute. In another showcase, known as the Tragic Room, museum visitors are able to witness the death of General Villa. There is a display that shows the map of the route Villa took before his assassination, and his death mask, taken three hours after his death. On display throughout the house are numerous photographs.

<doc id="828061" wikidata="Q724029" url="?curid=828061" title="A Mathematical Theory of Communication">
<text>&quot;A Mathematical Theory of Communication&quot; is an article by mathematician Claude E. Shannon published in &quot;Bell System Technical Journal&quot; in 1948. It was renamed The Mathematical Theory of Communication in the 1949 book of the same name, a small but significant title change after realizing the generality of this work. It has tens of thousands of citations, being one of the most influential and cited scientific papers of all time, as it gave rise to the field of information theory, with &quot;Scientific American&quot; referring to the paper as the &quot;Magna Carta of the Information Age&quot;, while the electrical engineer Robert G. Gallager called the paper a &quot;blueprint for the digital era&quot;. Historian James Gleick rated the paper as the most important development of 1948, placing the transistor second in the same time period, with Gleick emphasizing that the paper by Shannon was &quot;even more profound and more fundamental&quot; than the transistor.

It is also noted that &quot;as did relativity and quantum theory, information theory radically changed the way scientists look at the universe&quot;. The paper also formally introduced the term &quot;bit&quot; and serves as its theoretical foundation.

==Publication==
The article was the founding work of the field of information theory. It was later published in 1949 as a book titled &quot;The Mathematical Theory of Communication&quot; (), which was published as a paperback in 1963 (). The book contains an additional article by Warren Weaver, providing an overview of the theory for a more general audience.

==Contents==

This work is known for introducing the concepts of channel capacity as well as the noisy channel coding theorem.

Shannon&#x27;s article laid out the basic elements of communication:
*An information source that produces a message
*A transmitter that operates on the message to create a signal which can be sent through a channel
*A channel, which is the medium over which the signal, carrying the information that composes the message, is sent
*A receiver, which transforms the signal back into the message intended for delivery
*A destination, which can be a person or a machine, for whom or which the message is intended

It also developed the concepts of information entropy, redundancy and the source coding theorem, and introduced the term bit (which Shannon credited to John Tukey) as a unit of information. It was also in this paper that the Shannon–Fano coding technique was proposed – a technique developed in conjunction with Robert Fano.

<text>SolidWorks (stylized as SOLIDWORKS) is a brand within Dassault Systèmes that develops and markets software for solid modeling computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided engineering (CAE), 3D CAD design, collaboration, analysis, and product data management. The company introduced one of the first 3D CAD applications designed to run on a desktop PC.
SolidWorks released its first product, SolidWorks 95, on November 1, 1995. Today, the 3D CAD application known as SolidWorks remains the central product within the SolidWorks brand.

As of 2024, SolidWorks had an estimated 7.5 million users. SolidWorks software includes tools for analyses and simulations, such as Finite Element Analysis, which supports modeling, design, and collaborative work.

SolidWorks is a registered trademark of Dassault Systèmes SolidWorks Corporation.

==History==
SolidWorks Corporation was established in December 1993 by MIT graduate Jon Hirschtick, who used funds from his time with the MIT Blackjack Team to start the company. Hirschtick&#x27;s aim was to develop a user-friendly, cost-effective 3D CAD software for the Windows desktop. Originally based in Concord, Massachusetts, the company later moved to Waltham, Massachusetts. Its first product, SolidWorks 95, was released in November 1995. In 1997, Dassault Systèmes, known for its CATIA CAD software, acquired SolidWorks for $310 million in stock.

SolidWorks now offers multiple versions of its CAD software, along with related tools such as DraftSight (a 2D CAD product). Leadership has evolved over the years, with key figures including John McEleney (2001–2007), Jeff Ray (2007–2011), Bertrand Sicot (2011–2015), Gian Paolo Bassi (2015–2022), and Manish Kumar, who became CEO in February 2022. Bassi currently serves as Executive VP of 3DExperience Works at Dassault Systèmes.

==Market==
The SolidWorks&#x27; user base ranges from individuals to large corporations and covers a wide cross-section of manufacturing market segments. Its core industries include industrial equipment, high-tech, life sciences, home and lifestyle, architecture, engineering, and construction. Commercial sales go through an indirect channel of worldwide reseller partners. SolidWorks also partners with third-party developers to add functionality in niche market applications such as circuit layout and tolerance checking.

Directly competitive products to SolidWorks 3D CAD include PTC Creo Elements/Pro, Solid Edge, and Autodesk Inventor.

== Key events ==
SolidWorks held its inaugural user conference, SolidWorks World, in Palm Springs in February 1999, which later evovled into 3DExperience World in February 2019. The event annually convenes SolidWorks customers, value-added resellers, technology partners, students, educators, the press, and SolidWorks employees, maintaining its schedule even during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The user conference provides an opportunity for the close-knit community of engineers and designers that use SolidWorks products to connect and share ideas with each other.

==Modeling technology==

SolidWorks is a solid modeler, and utilizes a parametric feature-based approach which was initially developed by PTC (Creo/Pro-Engineer) to create 3D CAD models and assemblies. The software uses the Parasolid modeling kernel.

&quot;Parameters&quot; refer to constraints whose values determine the shape or geometry of the model or assembly. Parameters can be either numeric parameters, such as line lengths or circle diameters, or geometric parameters, such as tangent, parallel, concentric, horizontal or vertical, etc. Numeric parameters can be associated with each other through the use of relations, which allows them to capture design intent.

&quot;Design intent&quot; is how the creator of the part wants it to respond to changes and updates. For example, the user would want the hole at the top of a beverage can to stay at the top surface, regardless of the height or size of the can. SolidWorks allows the user to specify that the hole is a feature on the top surface, and will then honor their design intent no matter what height they later assign to the can.

&quot;Features&quot; refer to the building blocks of the part. They are the shapes and operations that construct the part. Shape-based features typically begin with a 2D or 3D sketch of shapes such as bosses, holes, slots, etc. This shape is then extruded to add or cut to remove material from the part. Operation-based features are not sketch-based, and include features such as fillets, chamfers, shells, applying draft to the faces of a part, etc.
Building a model in SolidWorks usually starts with either a 2D or 3D sketch. The sketch consists of geometry such as points, lines, arcs, conics (except the hyperbola), and splines. Dimensions are added to the sketch to define the size and location of the geometry. Relations are used to define attributes such as tangency, parallelism, perpendicularity, and concentricity. The parametric nature of SolidWorks means that the dimensions and relations drive the geometry, not the other way around. The dimensions in the sketch can be controlled independently, or by relationships to other parameters inside or outside the sketch.

In an assembly, the analog to sketch relations are mates. Just as sketch relations define conditions such as tangency, parallelism, and concentricity with respect to sketch geometry, &quot;assembly mates&quot; define equivalent relations with respect to the individual parts or components, allowing the easy construction of assemblies. SolidWorks also includes additional advanced mating features such as gear and cam follower mates, which allow modeled gear assemblies to accurately reproduce the rotational movement of an actual gear train.

Finally, drawings can be created either from parts or assemblies. Views are automatically generated from the solid model, and notes, dimensions and tolerances can then be easily added to the drawing as needed. The drawing module includes most paper sizes and standards (ANSI, ISO, DIN, GOST, JIS, BSI and SAC).

== Product portfolio ==

Since 1995, SolidWorks&#x27; has filed hundreds of patents worldwide and holds over 70 active US-granted patents.

=== Design-to-Manufacturing solutions ===
In 1999, the SolidWorks brand started introducing solutions complementary to 3D modeling and in 2006 introduced SolidWorks Design-to-Manufacturing solutions, an integrated system enabling design and manufacturing teams to work together concurrently. As a result, companies can go from conceptual design to manufactured parts faster and more easily using 3D CAD.
=== 3DExperience Works portfolio ===
Since 1995, SolidWorks has expanded beyond the desktop portfolio. Dassault Systèmes introduced 3DExperience (stylized as 3DEXPERIENCE) Works, a business that connects people, data, and applications to take products from idea to delivery. 3DExperience Works leverages the cloud-based 3DExperience platform to provide a single, unified collaborative environment, enabling everyone involved in product development to contribute to the innovation process.

At the center of the 3DExperience Works portfolio are the Design and Engineering solutions built by the SolidWorks brand. The SolidWorks Governance roles connect SolidWorks desktop to the 3DExperience platform. The portfolio also features simulation, manufacturing, governance, and marketing solutions from other Dassault Systèmes brands including 3DExcite, CATIA, DELMIA, ENOVIA, Netvibes, and Simulia.

The SolidWorks roles include both browser-based and cloud-connected roles. Each role is a collection of apps focused on a particular job function (e.g., 3D Creator), enabling a broad set of activities that users in that function typically perform.
Engineering.com, however, noted that some 3DEXPERIENCE features could be found in the standard desktop version of SOLIDWORKS.

=== SOLIDWORKS for Startups Program ===
The SOLIDWORKS for Startups Program, also known as the 3DEXPERIENCE Works for Startups program or the SOLIDWORKS Startup Program, is an initiative designed to support early-stage hardware startups. The program provides free access to industry-standard design, collaboration, and other product development tools for qualifying startups in their first year. Participants also receive free training and co-marketing resources as part of the program. Five companies presented their experiences with the program at 3DEXPERIENCE world 2023.

<doc id="828074" wikidata="Q2301024" url="?curid=828074" title="Special Clerical Court">
<text>Special Clerical Court, or Special Court for Clerics ( , &quot;dādgāh-e vizheh-ye ruhāniyat&quot;) is a special Iranian judicial system for prosecuting crimes, both ordinary and political, committed by Islamic clerics and scholars. The Special Clerical Court can defrock and disbar Islamic jurists, give sentences of imprisonment, corporal punishment, execution, etc. The court functions independently of the regular Iranian judicial framework, with its own security and prison systems, &quot;generally secret and confidential&quot; cases, proceedings and procedures, and is accountable only to the Supreme Leader of Iran, (Ali Khamenei as of 2024). 
The most senior Islamic politician to be prosecuted and sentenced to prison since the Iranian Revolution was Abdollah Nouri (Persian: عبدالله نوری) who was sentenced to five years in prison for political and religious dissent by the court in 1999.

The Court was established in the early 1980s on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis, subsequently phased out, and then re-established in 1987. It was fully institutionalized and endowed with a &quot;code&quot; in 1991 under Supreme Leader Khamenei. This code was revised and expanded in 2005. In addition to a Special Court for the Clerics, there is also a Special prosecutor for the clerics who is also appointed by the Supreme Leader and sometimes conflated with the court.

According to scholar Mirjam Künkler, &quot;since the mid-1990s ... the court has been used increasingly as an instrument for the suppression of dissident clerics, and at times even non-clerical culprits.&quot;

== History ==
Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Rouhollah Khomeini began to set up a &quot;special clerical court&quot; (SCC) to &quot;defend Islam&quot; and deal with those whom he called &quot;corrupt clerics&quot; within months of the February–March 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran.

During the early years of the Iranian revolution (the &quot;first phase&quot; of the court), ad hoc courts were established to deal with &quot;criminal&quot; acts committed by members of the clergy. These were to be &quot;tribunals formed of three clerics and two local elders&quot; according to Radio Farda. In 1979 clergies were punished &quot;under charges such as dependence on the Former Royal Court, the praising the Pahlavi dynasty, or the cooperation with SAVAK.&quot; In the Court&#x27;s &quot;second phase&quot;, from the beginning of 1980, it pursued its work with more discipline. In the late 1980s, the court was officially established in Qom.

Crimes prosecuted were acts aimed against the consolidation of power under Ayatollah Khomeini, as well as
those committed by &quot;black sheep&quot; who broke traditional rules and harmed &quot;the image of the clergy&quot;, according to Radio Farda.

As the new judicial structure of the Islamic Republic was devised and formalized, the SCC were not conceived as part of it. However, in 1987, the courts were revived by a decree of Ayatollah Khomeini in order to try an outspoken critic of the Iran–Contra affair, Mehdi Hashemi. Faced with disapproval of the unconstitutionality of the SCC, Khomeini sent a letter to the Majles of Iran in 1988, recommending that the special courts start operating within constitutional perimeters after the end of the Iran–Iraq War.

In 1990-91, a year after Khomeini&#x27;s death, 
the &quot;Special Clerical Court&quot; was established by the new Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, (the &quot;third phase&quot;).
On November 7, 1990, Mohammad Salimi was appointed the head of the Second Branch of the Special Court for the Clerics.
Khamenei &quot;significantly expanded the SCC. While the courts had hitherto functioned on the basis of no specific code, Khamenei commissioned an extraordinary ordinance of 47 articles, which was expanded in 2005. There had been one court in Tehran, he added ten other branches throughout the country (Tehran, Qom, Mashhad, Isfahan, Shiraz, Tabriz, Sari, Ahvaz, Kerman and Hamedan). &quot;A separate prison network&quot; was commissioned for the SCC. However, not included in all these new changes was the legalization or integration of the court into the official Iranian justice system per Khomeini&#x27;s letter. The court remained under the direct jurisdiction of the Supreme Leader.

==Size and leadership==
The cases and procedures before the SCC &quot;are generally secret and confidential&quot;, so there is no official information about how many people the court has put on trial, what charges have been brought or sentences passed.
However, according to one estimate (by Wilfried Buchta), in the year 2000 there were about 3000 prisoners in the SCC system, 6000 people in its employment. Over a twelve year period from 1988 to 2000, about 600 people were sentenced to death and executed, 2000 clergy were defrocked and another 4000 punished with prison sentences, fines or beatings While this may seem to involve an unusually large number of offenders and punishments, the SCC chief justice Hojjat al-Islam Mohammad Salimi stated in 2006 (to the effect) that about 2000 complaints are registered with the SCC per year.

Heads of the Special Clerical Court since its inception (as of 1987) are:
* Ali Razini (1987-2012)
* Mohammad Jafar Montazeri (in office as of 2012).
Special Prosecutor of the Clerical Court since its inception (as of 1987) are:
* Ali Fallahian (1987-1990)
* Mohammad Reyshahri (1990-1998)
* Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje&#x27;i (1998-2005)
* Mohammad Salimi (2005-2012)
* Ebrahim Raisi (2012-2021)
* Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje&#x27;i (in office as of 2021). 
The former Special Prosecutor of Clergy Court was Ebrahim Raisi, who was appointed by the supreme leader in 2012.

== The court and the law ==
===Unique characteristics and freedoms of court===
The clerical courts were not legalized or integrated into the official justice system, and remain under the direct jurisdiction of the Supreme Leader, and not, as all other courts in Iran, under the judiciary (i.e. the Judicial system of the Islamic Republic of Iran). This gives the clerical courts unique features that often limit the rights of the accused under the courts&#x27; jurisdiction.

*The judiciary has no authority to monitor, oversee or interfere in the affairs of the SCC. Whatever other laws may apply to legal proceedings and prison conditions elsewhere in the country do not apply to the SCC. 
*Whereas the judges of other courts are appointed by the Head of the Judiciary, the judges and prosecutors of the SCC are directly appointed by the Supreme Leader.
**It operates on a budget independent from the judiciary and not approved by the Iranian Parliament or Majles, as all budgets should be according to the constitution, but by the Expediency Discernment Council, a council appointed by and only answerable to the Supreme Leader;
**The Supreme Court, being part of the judiciary, has no jurisdiction to review cases of the SCC. Instead, appeals are heard by another chamber of the clerical court; 
**All court proceedings are closed to the public;
** the personnel of the SCC are not subject to any oversight such as the Judges Disciplinary Court, but subservient to the office of the Leader only; 
**The defense counsel in a trial must be chosen from designated clergy, so that the accused cannot freely choose their defense council, (article 35 of the constitution grants the accused the right to choose his or her own counsel of defense);
**Frequently the accused are not promptly informed of the charges against them. (Article 32 of the Constitution of Iran states the defendant must be properly arraigned and the charges against him must be conveyed clearly and in writing);
** The SCC de facto takes a different approach than the judiciary with regard to the sources of law recognized, for example considering &quot;penal codes and the SCC ordinance as secondary in line to contemporary fatāwā&quot;, (this is in contradiction to Article 167 of the constitution, which says Islamic sources are secondary to any codified law);
**The court runs its own security and prison systems, 
*Since cases are referred to the SCC directly by the office of the Supreme Leader, in theory, the Supreme Leader is in a position to refer any case to the SCC he believes involves some sort of “crime”. An example of the SCC spreading its jurisdiction is a case involving a &quot;press offense&quot; which the SCC took on the grounds that “the defendant is a member of the clergy”, (&quot;On December 30, 1999, ‘Ali Afsahi, chief editor of the cultural and sports magazine &quot;Sinama va Varzesh&quot;, notably not a cleric, was imprisoned for four months for having &#x27;insulted the clergy”), despite the fact that Article 168 of the Iranian Constitution states that the General Courts are the only judicial authority that has jurisdiction to review press offenses.

Iranian Conservatives have argued that Iran&#x27;s Supreme Leader has the power to make new courts if he wishes on the grounds that according to Iran&#x27;s Constitution, the Supreme Leader has absolute power, and so is not limited by the rules of the constitution.

===Complaint about legitimacy===
A number of sources have questioned the constitutionality of the SCC system.
The Human Rights Activist&#x27;s News Agency of Iran (NRANA) complains that the court is not mentioned in the constitution, and has not been approved of by the Islamic Consultative Assembly. Several points of the constitution indicate the court&#x27;s illegality (according to the NRANA): 
* Principles 19, 20 and 107 of the Constitution stipulate that: “The people of Iran, from every tribe to which they belong, enjoy equal rights, and color, race, language and such, do not bestow any privileges. The Supreme Leader in front of the law is equal to everyone else.” (The HRANA then states: &quot;Every exception in this principle needs legal clarification&quot;—none has been given);
*according to the constitution, all offences should be investigated in the judiciary -- &quot;the country&#x27;s highest legal document -- &quot;except for cases involving military courts&quot;; 
*in Article 110 of the Constitution (which spells out the &quot;Duties and Powers&quot; of the Supreme Leader), makes no reference to courts.

Two Iranian reformist Islamic scholars who have served time in prison at the hands of the court -- Mohsen Kadivar, and Hasan Yousefi Eshkevari—also cast doubt on its legitimacy. Like the News Agency of Iran, Kadivar argues that the SCC is a violation of several articles of the IRI&#x27;s constitution (articles 57, 177, 110, 172, and 19), while 
three other articles (57, 177, and 110) make no reference to a court functioning under the authority of the Supreme Leader—which the SCC does.

According to Kadivar, there is no doubt&quot; the Special Clerical Court is currently and always has been &quot;illegal”. “The only way&quot; to legalize it would be to add &quot;a new article (amendment) to it and change &quot;all the aforementioned articles&quot;.

Eshkevari, (who was defrocked and served several years in prison after being convicted by the Court of “spreading lies and insulting Islamic sanctities” among other charges) states the SCC &quot;contradicts the modern law system” and “is clearly&quot; guilty of &quot;discrimination against the justice&quot;. Eshkevari states that the court acts very much like an inquisitional court of medieval times,
—meeting in secret, doing without juries, wielding arbitrary powers, dealing severely with opponents of the ruler who may be too powerful for ordinary laws.

===Prosecutions of institutions===
The SCC do not only sentence criminal and dissident clerics. They also censor and confiscate works that might challenge the Supreme Leader&#x27;s theological and jurisprudential authority, notably those works authored by senior Ayatollahs who oppose the velayate faqih or particular policies of the regime.

On June 25, 2000, the SCC ordered the Tehran daily &quot;Bayan&quot;, run by Hojjatoleslam Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, to cease publishing. Mohtashemi was a former interior minister and aide to President Mohammad Khatami.

In early August 1999, the Clergy court &quot;imposed a five-year ban&quot; on the newspaper &quot;Salam.&quot; Salam was founding in 1991 after a group of left-wing but &quot;veteran revolutionary&quot; pro-regime clerics, were not only banned by the conservative Guardian Council from running for the Assembly of Experts, but could find no newspaper even willing to print that news and their protest. (Despite its limited circulation and focus on influencing policy, the paper became very popular and helped elect reformist Muhammad Khatami president in 1997.)
Prior to this ban, at least one of the clerics, Mohammad Mousavi Khoeiniha, publisher of &quot;Salam&quot;, was convicted for defamation and spreading false information.

=== Explanation for unique status===
The leader of the Iranian Islamic Revolution and founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Rouhollah Khomeini, also created the religious/political concept of &quot;velāyat-e faqih&quot; or &quot;Guardianship of the (Islamic) Jurist&quot;, which held that since government should/must be run in accordance with traditional Islamic law (&quot;sharia&quot;), the rightful ruler (until the reappearance of the &quot;infallible Imam&quot;) would be the leading Islamic jurist (&quot;faqih&quot;, an expert in sharia) to rule over the people and nation. He (males only) would provide political &quot;guardianship&quot;. In Iran the post of Supreme Leader was established to fulfill this role. Though Khomeini&#x27;s massive popularity paved the way for this system of government, seven of the eight leading Shi&#x27;i jurists at the time (the eighth jurist was Khomeini), did not accept &quot;the status the vali-e faqih was accorded in the 1979 Iranian constitution. 

Scholar Mirjam Künkler sees a connection between this lack of clerical support for the theological basis of the Supreme Leader, and the special powers (direct control by the Supreme Leader, being outside of the judiciary system of the Islamic Republic and the Constitution of Iran, trials that are not open to the public and do not allow the accused to choose their own defense counsel, and whose verdict cannot be appealed to the Supreme Court of Iran, etc.), of a court of law devoted just to religious clerics. If the reason for being of the Guardian ruler is based on the principle of &quot;velāyat-e faqih&quot;, and dissident cleric theologians are exactly the people who could &quot;prove the extent to which the &quot;velāyat-e faqih&quot; is inconsistent with Shiʿi traditions and the extent to which it is a theological novelty whose primary function is to justify the exercise of authoritarian rule&quot;; then

<doc id="828076" wikidata="Q429947" url="?curid=828076" title="Mohsen Kadivar">
<text>Mohsen Kadivar (; born 8 June 1959) is a mujtahid, Islamic theologian, philosopher, writer, leading intellectual reformist, and research professor of Islamic Studies at Duke University. A political Iranian dissident, Kadivar has been a vocal critic of the doctrine of clerical rule, also known as Velayat-e Faqih (&quot;Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist&quot;), and a strong advocate of democratic and liberal reforms in Iran as well as constructional reform in understanding of shari&#x27;a and Shi&#x27;a theology. Kadivar has served time in prison in Iran for his political activism and beliefs.

==Education and career==
Born in Fasa (Fars province) to a politically active family, Mohsen Kadivar completed his primary and secondary education in Shiraz before being admitted into electronics engineering at Shiraz University in 1977. He became politically active as a student and was arrested by the Shah&#x27;s police in May 1978 for his political activities. In 1980 he switched his focus to religious education and began attending Shiraz Seminary. He moved to Qom in 1981 to pursue his studies in fiqh and philosophy. In Qom, he was taught by prominent teachers like Ayatollah Hossein-Ali Montazeri. Kadivar graduated with a degree in ijtihad in 1997. He got his Ph.D. in Islamic philosophy and theology from Tarbiat Modares University in Tehran in 1999.

Kadivar started his career as a teacher teaching fiqh and Islamic philosophy at Qom Seminary for fourteen years. He began teaching Islamic philosophy and theology at Imam Sadegh University, Mofid University, Shahid Beheshti University, and Tarbiat Modarres University for seven years. He started as an assistant professor of philosophy at Tarbiat Modarres University in 2000. In 2007 political pressures forced Kadivar to leave his teaching appointment for a position at the Research Center of the Iranian Institute of Philosophy. As an associate professor of Islamic Philosophy Kadivar was fired from his academic job in 2011 because of his political critiques. He was visiting scholar at the Islamic Legal Studies Program of Harvard Law School in 2002, visiting professor of Islamic studies at the University of Virginia (2008–2009), and at Duke University (fall 2009 – spring 2014). He held the fall 2014 Keohane Distinguished Visiting Professorship of University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Kadivar is currently a research professor of Islamic Studies in the department of religious studies at Duke University.

== Personal life ==
Kadivar married Zahra Roodi in 1981 and has four children. Jamileh Kadivar is his sister.

==Dissent==
Kadivar is a prominent critic of the Islamic Republic system in Iran, and wrote a detailed criticism of Ayatollah Khomeini&#x27;s theory of Islamic government as rule by Shia clerics, &quot;Government by Mandate&quot; (see below). 
As punishment for his criticism, Kadivar was sentenced to eighteen months in prison after being convicted by the Special Clerical Court in 1999, on charges of having spread false information about Iran&#x27;s &quot;sacred system of the Islamic Republic&quot; and of helping enemies of the Islamic revolution, or as another observer put it, &quot;for commenting on the contradiction between the revolution&#x27;s aims to serve the people and the subsequent concentration of power in the hands of clerics.&quot; He was released from Evin Prison, on July 17, 2000. Kadivar was unrepentant on his release and is currently active in the various reform movements of Iran. His publications including books, articles, and interviews were banned in Iran since 2009, and he was fired from his job in 2011. Kadivar has been in exile since 2007.

In a 2004 interview, Kadivar told a journalist, &quot;Every member of society and every member of government is subject to the law. No one can be above it. Everyone has the same rights, yet the root of the &quot;faqih&quot; is inequality. He assumes he is above it. ... It is time for the supreme leader to be subject to the constitution too. After all, the Supreme Leader doesn&#x27;t come from God!&quot;

On the issue of clerics in government, he has said: &quot;Our job as religious people is not politics. ... They are taking Iran backward, not toward the future.&quot;

# &quot;Mohsen Kadivar, un clerc militant et réformiste&quot;

== Research works and contributions ==
Four of Kadivar&#x27;s books focus on political theology. Of these, three comprise a trilogy – &quot;The Theories of State in the Shiite Jurisprudence&quot;, &quot;Government by Mandate&quot;, &quot;Government by Appointment&quot;. Two of his books focus on Islam and human rights. Four of his books and a couple of his articles were translated into Arabic.

===&quot;The Theories of State in the Shiite Jurisprudence&quot; ===
The first volume of this trilogy, &quot;The Theories of State in the Shiite Jurisprudence&quot; (Nazarrieh haye Doulat dar Fight&#x27;h e Shi&#x27;eh), which has been translated to Arabic, encompasses a broad typology of religious opinions on the desired or permissible types of government in Shiite theology. Every single instance in this typology is either proposed or endorsed by the highest authorities in Shiite jurisprudence.

According to Kadivar, &quot;Velayat e Motlaghe ye Faghih&quot; reflects a spectrum of authoritative options for Islamic society. There are not one, but &quot;no less than nine distinct possible forms of government all proposed and supported by most revered religious scholars and texts.&quot; 
A. Theories of State based on Immediate Divine Legitimacy
Four theocratic types, in chronological order:

1. &quot;Appointed Mandate of Jurisconsult&quot; in Religious Matters (Shari&#x27;at) along with the Monarchic Mandate of Muslim Potentates in Secular Matters
(Saltanat E Mashrou&#x27;eh)
Advocates: Mohammad Bagher Majlesi, Mirza ye Ghomi, Seyed e Kashfi, Sheikh Fadlullah Nouri, Ayatollah Abdolkarim Haeri Yazdi.

2. &quot;General Appointed Mandate of Jurisconsults&quot;
(Velayat E Entesabi Ye &#x27;Ummeh)
Advocates: Molla Ahmad Naraghi, Sheikh Mohammad Hassan Najafi (Sahib Javahir) Ayatollahs Borujerdi, Golpayegani, Khomeini (before the revolution)

3. &quot;General Appointed Mandate of the Council of the &#x27;Sources of Imitation&#x27; &quot;
(Velayat E Entesabi Ye Ammeh Ye Shora Ye Marje&#x27;eh Taghlid)
Advocates: Ayatollah Sayyed Mohammad Shirazi

4. &quot;Absolute Appointed Mandate of Jurisconsult&quot;
(Velayat e Entesabi ye Motlaghe ye Faghihan)
Advocate: Ayatollah Khomeini (after revolution)

B. Theories of State Based on Divine-popular Legitimacy
Five democratic types, in chronological order:

5. &quot;Constitutional State&quot; (with the permission and supervision of Jurisprudents)
(Dowlat e Mashrouteh)
Advocates: Ayatollahs: Sheikh Esma&#x27;il Mahallati, Mohammad Hosein Na&#x27;ini

6. &quot;Popular Stewardship along with Clerical Oversight&quot;
(Khelafat e Mardom ba Nezarat e Marjaiat)
Advocate: Ayatollah Mohammad Bagher Sadr (secondary opinion)

7. &quot;Elective Limited Mandate of Jurisprudents&quot;
(Velayat e Entekhabi ye Moghayyadeh ye Faghih)
Advocates: Ayatollahs Murtada Motahhari, Nimatullah Salehi Najaf-Abadi, Hosein-Ali Montazeri

8. &quot;Islamic elective State&quot; (Dowlat e Entekhabi ye Eslami)
Advocates: Ayatollahs Mohammad Bagher Sadr (primary opinion), Mohammad Mahdi Shamseddin, Muhammad Jawad Mughniya (Sayyed Kazim Shari&#x27;atmadari)

9. &quot;Collective Government by Proxy&quot; (Vekalat e Malekan e Shakhsi ye Mosha)&quot;
Advocate: Ayatollah Mehdi Ha&#x27;eri Yazdi

===&quot;Government by Mandate&quot;===
Having laid out a spectrum of authoritative options for Islamic society, in his second volume, &quot;Government by Mandate&quot; (Hokumat e Vela&#x27;i), Kadivar criticises Ayatollah Khomeini&#x27;s theology, the most absolutist thesis among the varieties of &quot;Velayat e Motlaghe ye Faghih&quot; and the one enshrined in the constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Kadivar considers this 432-page opus the heart of his trilogy and the most scholarly book he has written.

The work unfolds in two phases: the first, lays bare the presuppositions of the concept of Velayat, which concerns the meaning of the term, its interpretation in mysticism (Irfan), philosophy (Kalam), jurisprudence (Fight&#x27;h), The Qur&#x27;an, and Tradition (Sonnat). In every instance, Kadivar discounts political implications of the term. He traces the first indication of the thesis to the writings of eighteenth and nineteenth century jurists namely, Mohaghegh e Karaki, Shahid Thani, and Ahmad Naraghi. Kadivar, thus determines the age of the concept as less than two centuries, a mere blinking of an eye compared to the history of Shiite jurisprudence.

But he reserves his most devastating attacks for the second part of the book that is devoted to the critical analysis of the proofs and confirmations of the principle of government by divine mandate. Here Kadivar proceeds in four sections; following the sources of adjudication in Shiite theology he sets up and knocks down the arguments for the Velayat e Faghih adduced from Quran, Tradition, (Sonnat) consensus of the Ulama, (Ijma&#x27;) and reason (Aghl), He thus concludes:

&quot;The principle of Velayat e Faqih is neither intuitively obvious, nor rationally necessary. It is neither a requirement of religion (Din) nor a necessity for denomination (Mazhab). It is neither a part of Shiite general principles (&#x27;Usoul), nor a component of detailed observances (Forou&#x27;) It is, by near consensus of Shiite Ulama, nothing more than a jurisprudential minor hypothesis.&quot;

===&quot;Government by Appointment&quot; ===
The third volume of Kadivar&#x27;s trilogy is entitled: &quot;Government by Appointment&quot; (Hokoumat e Entesabi). It deals with practical consequences, disappointments, and disenchantments that the Government based on divine mandate has brought about.

===Reform in Shari&#x27;a===
Kadivar&#x27;s theory of foundational reform in shari&#x27;a could be abstract in this way: The three preconditions of being rational, just, and better than the solutions offered by other religions, did not only pertain in the age of revelation. In any age, the non-worship-related Shari’a precepts must meet these three preconditions on the basis of the conventions of the wise people of the day. Definite disagreement between a precept and the dictates of reason in our day, or a conflict with the norms of justice of our day, or the existence of preferable solutions in the modern age, reveal that the relevant precept was not permanent and has been abrogated. In other words, these precepts were in keeping with best interests in the age of revelation; they did not rank among the Lawgiver&#x27;s permanent, unchanging laws. When people start speaking about the implications of time and place, it means that they have accepted the idea that a Shari’a precept can be temporary. The implications of time and place are not necessarily unchanging; they differ and change. The philosophy behind the presence of these precepts in unchanging Scripture and Tradition was the need to solve the problems of the age of revelation and similar situations. If the Lawgiver had not taken into account the implications of time and place of the Prophet&#x27;s day and the customs of the time, and had abandoned people to their own devices—at a time when there was great need for such precepts, in view of the limitations of collective rationality in the age of revelation—it would have been out of keeping with the God&#x27;s eloquent wisdom. Despite his perfections, the Prophet would have been unable—without the direct assistance of God—to solve the countless problems related to organizing religion and running society. Many was the occasion when he hoped and waited for the blessing of revelation from God. Hence, there was no alternative but to formulate—alongside the unchanging and permanent Shari’a precepts—temporary precepts that were contingent on the continuation of the underlying best interests, and to include them in Scripture and Tradition. The language of the proof, even if it explicitly conveys everlastingness, does not prevent abrogation if the evidence and proof for one precept is superseded by a subsequent proof. Our distinguished predecessors have unanimously accepted this.
Formulating opinions (ijtihād) means distinguishing precepts that were laid down in accordance with the demands of time and place and the conditions of the age of revelation, from the unchanging and permanent precepts of the Shari’a. Confusing these two types of precepts, and considering all the precepts of Scripture and Tradition to be unchanging and applicable in all times and places, is to fail to understand correctly the meaning of religion, the aim of the Prophetic mission and the objectives of the Shari’a.

===Islam as an End in Itself===
The comparative studies between Kadivar&#x27;s approach to reforming Islamic thought and other Shi&#x27;a thinkers reach these concluding remarks: There are three approaches to the discussion of the compatibility of Islam (or more precisely Shari’a and fiqh) with modernity among Muslim Shi’i thinkers in the recent century and a half in Iran. Although the Constant and Variable Perspective in its different expositions by Na’ini, Allama Tabataba’i, and Seyyed Muhammad Baqir Sadr, is the most famous perspective of the compatibility of Islam and modernity, it has four serious problems. Ayatollah Khomeini&#x27;s Perspective of Governmental or Expedient Fiqh, which is the official policy of Islamic Republic of Iran, aside from its flexibility, encounters four problems.
The Perspective of Islam as an End in Itself is the third approach that Kadivar argues has four advantages. It has the capacity of giving a new interpretation of Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) in the modern world based on the spirit of Islam and the goals of the Qur’an, the tradition of the Prophet (Sunna), and his household (Ahl al-Bayt). He finds that Islam as an end in itself is a perfect perspective for the modern world.

===Revisiting Women&#x27;s Rights in Islam===
Kadivar mentioned his innovative ideas on women&#x27;s rights in 2013: There are two types of verses and hadiths regarding women&#x27;s rights in the Qurʾan and Sunna. The first type designates full human rights for women, and recognises equal rights for men and women as humans, despite bodily differences between them. The second type considers that women, because of their lesser capacities, are entitled to fewer rights than men in managing the home and in society. At the same time, reason and Shariʿa required that women be treated with justice and according to what is commonly accepted as good, as right (maʿrūf).
Muslim scholars, following Aristotle, construed justice as deserts based on the basis of proportional equality and considered women as entitled to fewer rights because of what they considered to be women&#x27;s inherent lesser capacity. They took the first type of verses and hadith as the basis for equal rights, and the second type as the standard for women&#x27;s rights and duties, and defended patriarchy as consistent with justice and Shariʿa.
Both proportional equality and deserts-based justice are indefensible and unjustified. Contemporary rationality recognises humans, as they are humans, as rights-holders, and thus upholds fundamental equality and egalitarian justice. This notion of justice is very close to human dignity and Qurʾanic anthropology. The first type of verses and hadiths, on grounds of contextual rational argument, imply fixed and permanent rulings, and, by analogy, verses that apparently imply legal inequality and greater legal rights for men are considered temporary rulings whose validity has expired.
According to egalitarian justice and fundamental equality, although women differ from men physically and psychologically, they are entitled to equal rights because they are human, and it is humanity – not gender, colour, race, class, religion, or political ideology – that carries rights, duties, dignity, and trust and divine vice-regency. This position is more consistent with the Qurʾanic spirit and Islamic standards; evidence for legal inequality, because of its temporariness, cannot be counted as an obstacle to the realization of legal equality.

===Apostasy and Blasphemy===
Rafiq Taqi, a journalist residing in Baku, Azerbaijan was fatally stabbed based on fatwa of an Ayatollah the student of Ayatollah Khomeini in 2011, accused of apostasy and blasphemy because of his articles. Kadivar denounced the ruling of execution openly and wrote a book on this issue. Here is the abstract of his opinions in the case of apostasy and blasphemy in Islam: There is no reliable proof from the Qur’an, Sunnah, consensus (ijmaʻ), or reason that can establish the validity of shedding the blood of anyone who has been accused of apostasy or defaming the Prophet. On the contrary, this goes against the Qur’an and reason. Moreover, the negative effects that would ensue from making licit the shedding of someone&#x27;s blood would be plenty and, as such, would certainly weaken Islam.
Only a sound judicial system can issue a judgment and supervise its implementation. The issuance of a judgment by a jurist who is qualified to issue a legal opinion (fatwa), out of the judicial system, does not suffice.
A judgment on the apostate and defamer of the Prophet is absolutely lacking in evidence from the Qur’an. Traditional jurists, by employing ijtihad, have arrived at this judgment and have claimed consensus by relying on solitary (akhbar wahid) or dependable (muwatthaqah) hadiths.
The ruling on killing the apostate and defamer of the Prophet is incorrect and not possible to implement on account of the following seven proofs:
(a) The necessity of stopping the implementation of the rule of execution of an apostate or a blasphemer as a secondary injunction, &quot;debilitating Islam&quot; (avoiding the harm or seeking public welfare or governmental injunction).
(b) The necessity of suspending or stopping the implementation of punishment for hudud that would lead to the killing of a person during the Occultation of the Twelfth Imam.
(c) Since the judgment on killing is based on solitary reports (al-akhbar al-ahad), it is mandatory to exercise caution by negation the rule of shedding someone&#x27;s blood.
(d) Any judgment of killing based on solitary reports is not a valid basis for dealing with vital and critical issues.
(e) Alteration of the subject matter or situational context (mawduʻ) of apostasy.
(f) The hadiths mandating the execution of the apostate and defamer of the Prophet are contrary to Qur’anic dictates.
(g) The rational proof is too weak to establish the execution of one who abandons religion or insults the holy personages.
In conclusion, exiting from religion (i.e., apostasy) has no temporal punishment. Executing anyone on the basis of insulting the Prophet or the Qur’an or other sacred objects in Islam is therefore indefensible.

<text>Portadown Football Club is a semi-professional Northern Irish football club who play in the NIFL Premiership.

The club was formed in 1887 as a junior team seeking to participate in the Mid-Ulster Cup, eventually joining the Irish League with the support of other local clubs in 1924.

They are based in Portadown, County Armagh and play their home matches at Shamrock Park. The club&#x27;s colours are red and white. Their home are kit consists of red shirts, red shorts and red socks with white trim on all. The badge shows a red apple inside it. Many believe this comes from the &quot;orchard county&quot; nickname to the area.

The club&#x27;s main rivals are Glenavon, with their matches being known as the &quot;Mid Ulster Derby&quot;. The club also has a longstanding rivalry with Glentoran.

==History==
===Junior years (1886–1924)===
The Mid Ulster Football Association was established in 1887 and a series of meetings were held in the Young Men&#x27;s Institute in Edward Street in Portadown to create a club to compete in the Mid-Ulster Cup. Early matches were played at Tavanagh, Ripley&#x27;s Field, Armagh Road and Old Shamrock Park which was located close to the site of what is now Clounagh Junior High School. Among the early names to turn out for &quot;The Ports&quot; were Val Wilson, who would later become High Sheriff for County Armagh; and Harry Bell, whose father owned brickworks on the Armagh Road.

The club won the Irish Junior Cup after defeating Larne at Grosvenor Park on 18 March 1899. That same season, &quot;The Ports&quot; won their first ever cup double by winning the Mid-Ulster Cup for the first time. Portadown retained the trophy the following season and the following next five seasons before the outbreak of World War I. While the Irish Intermediate League was formed in 1916, and Portadown were selected as one of its inaugural clubs, they withdrew as a large number of the club&#x27;s players left to fight in World War I. With the return of local men from the war, there was a demand for senior football in the region. A number of junior clubs in the area put aside their rivalries and backed Portadown&#x27;s bid to join the Irish League. In 1923, the Irish League was expanded from six to ten clubs with the introduction of Newry Town, Ards and Barn. Subsequently, after a number of years of preparation, representatives of the club (including William Mullen, Tom Dawson and a committee) met the league chiefs in June 1924 and were able to present a case for joining the league. Portadown became a full member club of the Irish League together with the readmittance of Belfast Celtic.

===Early Irish League years (1924–1932)===
Portadown played their first senior game, in August 1924, against Glentoran. The first Irish League game played at Shamrock Park was against the champions Queens Island in a game that finished 0–0.

In that first season, Portadown finished fourth, two points behind Belfast Celtic with Queens Island taking second place, behind champions Glentoran. Along the way, &quot;The Ports&quot; played some memorable matches, including a 4–3 victory over Linfield at Shamrock Park and a 1–0 win against Belfast Celtic in the City Cup.

The 1925–26 season saw a continuation of their consolidation in the league with away victories at both Belfast Celtic and Linfield.

After nine seasons in senior football, Portadown won their first senior trophy, defeating Glentoran 1–0 at Solitude in the Gold Cup Final. Around 5,000 fans travelled to witness the win. With three minutes remaining and the scores level at 0–0, William Johnston scored the winning goal.

As the team returned to town that night, they were met by thousands of people at the railway station and toured the town in an open top bus before stopping at St. Mark&#x27;s Church for speeches. Chairman William Mullen led the speeches before igniting a large bonfire.

===Tommy Sloan trophy winning era (1932–1938)===
Tommy Sloan was appointed manager in 1932 and his and Portadown&#x27;s first major trophy success came in the 1933–34 season when they won the Gold Cup under Sloan&#x27;s charge and won the same trophy again in the 1937–38 season before his resignation due to the coming war in 1938. He was replaced by Hugh Bullough, but would return to the club for a brief spell during World War II.

===Postwar era (1945–1954)===
Post-war, Portadown were in the shadow of Mid Ulster rivals Glenavon, who were undergoing their period of glory years in the 1950s that is yet to be repeated by &quot;The Lurgan Blues&quot;.

===Gibby McKenzie era (1958–1977)===
In 1958, the club appointed Scottish manager Gibby McKenzie. The press described him as &quot;the fast-talking Scot with the fanatical zeal for the game who eats sleeps and breathes football&quot; after Harry Walker&#x27;s short spell in charge. McKenzie very nearly clinched that first elusive league title in the 1960–61 season with Albert Mitchell missing a penalty that would have secured the league championship against Glentoran and in the 1961–62 season, where they finished second to Linfield in these seasons and finished third in the Irish League the following season. McKenzie left &quot;The Ports&quot; for good in 1977 after his second spell in charge of the club.

===Bertie Neil era (1977–1979)===
In 1977, the club appointed former Bangor Bertie Neil, famed for the development of Northern Ireland legend and now Sky Sports commentator Gerry Armstrong. Neil&#x27;s spell, although short, was considered successful, with another Gold Cup and an Irish Cup Final appearance in a 3–2 defeat to Cliftonville. In 1979, the club announced that Neil had left the club &quot;by mutual consent&quot;.

===Terry Kingon era (1983–1986)===

After Jon Flanagan&#x27;s short spell in charge, the club appointed former player Terry Kingon. His team reached the Ulster Cup final in 1985, defeating Linfield 3–1 in the semi-final at The Oval. But the serious injury in that match to star Scottish striker Billy Paton (who had scored 28 goals the previous season for &quot;The Ports&quot;) was a devastating blow.

Portadown held Coleraine to a 0–0 draw during the 90 minutes but collapsed in extra-time, losing 5–0. Paton, who had started the game with pain-killing injections, broke down early on. Deprived of his scoring qualities for the rest of the season, Portadown struggled financially and this resulted in the sale of the training ground to meet creditors&#x27; demands. Kingon did his best with limited resources and one of the fascinating features of his season in charge at Shamrock Park was the large number of drawn games involving Portadown. In fact, before he resigned in December 1986, Portadown had drawn 9 of the first 14 Irish League games, losing the other five.

===Ronnie McFall era (1986–2016)===

From December 1986 to March 2016, the club&#x27;s manager was Ronnie McFall. He signed another in five-year contract in 2009 and signed a two-year deal in August 2014. McFall brought several successes to the club, winning their first ever league title in 1989 and league title wins in 1991, 1996 and in 2002; he also won three Irish Cups. He was born and raised in Portadown and played left-back for the club during the 1960s and 1970s. He has also played for Dundee United of Scotland, and afterwards Ards and Glentoran, the latter where he began his managerial career. McFall was the longest serving manager in European football, surpassing Sir Alex Ferguson in 2013. McFall is one of the most successful managers in Irish league football. Following a run of poor results, McFall announced he would step down from his position as manager following a 3–2 defeat to Lurgan Celtic in the Irish Cup quarter-final.

In the 1989–90 season, the club finally won the Irish League, and in the final match there was a pitch invasion by the club&#x27;s fans. In the following 1990–91 season, the club dominated the Irish League, nearly defeating every team in the division. They retained the title that season and they beat rivals Glenavon in the Irish cup final 2–1 to secure the club&#x27;s first ever league and cup double. The season after was less successful with a number players starting to age and attendances started to fall.

In the 1993–94 season, the club had partially recovered from this slump and were involved in a three-way battle for the title between themselves and Linfield and Glenavon. With an updated, &quot;The Ports&quot; took on Glenavon and the winners would secure the league title, however a draw at Mourneview Park would hand the title to Linfield. Glenavon raced into a two-goal lead against Portadown at Mourneview Park, and with Linfield drawing with Glentoran, &quot;The Lurgan Blues&quot; would have won their first league title in 34 years. However, Portadown scored two quick fire goals to level it at 2–2 and with Linfield beating &quot;The Glens&quot; – the Belfast side were now champions. Everything at Mourneview had now turned in Portadown&#x27;s favor, who were creating chance after chance with the Ports missing the chance to win the title themselves when Robert Casey missed an easy chance, with Linfield eventually being crowned champions. For the 1995–96 season, a new crest was introduced and &quot;The Ports&quot; won their third league title that season, with Gary Haylock and Sandy Fraser the instigators in the title winning team.

====Transitional period (1996–2000)====
After their title win, the club lost many of their aging star players to retirement and to other clubs, and McFall is fondly remembered signing Notts County striker Vinny Arkins and &quot;Big Vin&quot; famously talks about how McFall refused to let him walk away from talks until he signed the contract offered to him. A generation of players such as Philip Major and Kyle Neill coming through and a few signings helped McFall build another team to win yet another league title in 2002 and losing 2–1 to Linfield in the Irish Cup Final to prevent another league and cup double.

Thereafter, the club implemented cost-cutting measures and several aging players retired or moved to larger clubs. The club&#x27;s last major trophy came in 2005 when the club took on Larne in the Irish Cup Final, with the Inver Park side scoring early on before &quot;The Ports&quot; scored five goals to secure the Irish Cup.

====Demotion (2008)====
 On 30 April 2008, Portadown, who had been a senior football club in Northern Ireland since 1924, were demoted to the Championship as a result of the club&#x27;s final application form for the new IFA Premiership (due to replace the Irish Premier League for 2008–09) having been received 29 minutes late and thus not considered. The club unsuccessfully appealed its exclusion. Due to the drop from Northern Ireland&#x27;s top domestic football league, the IFA Premiership, Portadown took on intermediate status, due to the IFA Championship, which was Northern Ireland&#x27;s second tier of football, being an intermediate league at the time. McFall described the time as &quot;the toughest point of his managerial career&quot; but kept several star players and in their first season in the Championship. The club won promotion straight back into senior football, defeating their closest rivals Donegal Celtic 2–0 in the last (and decisive) match of the season. Also, after beating Newry City 1–0 at Mourneview Park on 28 February 2009, Portadown became the first intermediate club to win the Irish League Cup with Scotsman Gary McCutcheon scoring the winning goal.

====Top-flight Return, European Football and Cup finals (2009–15)====

Portadown qualified to play UEFA Europa League football in the 2010–11 season on account of being runners-up in the 2009–10 Irish Cup to Linfield. They famously defeated professional side and Latvian champions Skonto 2–1 on aggregate to advance to the second qualifying round. It was their first win in European competition since 1974. The second qualifying round first leg match was played at Shamrock Park on 15 July 2010, with Richard Lecky scoring the opening goal against Azerbaijani champions FK Qarabağ, but two second-half goals from Afran Ismayilov saw the away side take a 2–1 lead back home for the second leg on 22 July. The second leg in Baku ended 1–1 with &quot;The Ports&quot; taking the lead through a free-kick from Kevin Braniff. Despite an effort against the Azerbaijani champions, it was not enough for &quot;The Ports&quot; to progress to the next round and they were eliminated 3–2 on aggregate.

The 2011–12 season saw &quot;The Ports&quot; recover and mount a title challenge that was largely spearheaded by Welsh striker Matthew Tipton, with themselves and Linfield the runaway leaders in the race. However, &quot;The Ports&quot;&#x27; challenge began to fade following an injury to Tipton, and Linfield finished comfortably as champions.

The 2012–13 season saw Matthew Tipton sign for champions Linfield and another European win against Macedonian side Shkëndija in the summertime. The Ports would take on Slaven Belupo of Croatia in the next round, with the promise of a mouth watering tie against La Liga side Athletic Bilbao should they progress. Any hopes of progression were quickly dashed when the Ports lost 6–0 at the Gradski stadion Ivan Kušek-Apaš, being hampered by the unavailability of goalkeeper David Miskelly, with a respectable 4–2 defeat at Shamrock Park ending the clubs time in Europe, its last to date.

The Ports would make waves in the transfer market in January when it was announced they had beaten strong competition from &quot;The Blues&quot; for Shamrock Rovers striker Gary Twigg, who scored on his league debut against Donegal Celtic, although &quot;The Ports&quot; could only muster a seventh-place finish in quite a disappointing season.

The 2013–14 season was a largely frustrating one of what might have been, with Gary Twigg playing a valuable part and scoring regularly, along with in-form young striker Darren Murray and some of Kevin Braniff&#x27;s moments of sheer class displayed at times and the skill of Peter McMahon. The club showed form at times capable of winning the league by beating rivals Glenavon comfortably and notably beating Ballinamallard United 11–0. However, poor results against teams lower in the table meant they finished only fourth, and a falling-out between striker Kevin Braniff and Ronnie McFall resulted in the former leaving the club and moving to Australian side Port Melbourne.

In the 2014–15 season, &quot;The Ports&quot; signed Linfield playmaker Robert Garrett, &quot;Blues&quot; captain Michael Gault and reliable &quot;Blues&quot; striker Mark McAilaster. This had meant a lot was expected of the club to challenge for the title and they started the season with an impressive 3–0 win over Warren Feeney&#x27;s Linfield and several wins over Glenavon and eventual champions Crusaders They also showed the capability of being champions when in a match against basement side Institute; with the match leveled at 1–1 in the dying minutes, Michael Gault scored a late, long distance effort to secure the three points. However, a shock 2–1 defeat away to Warrenpoint Town saw &quot;The Ports&quot; miss out on the chance to go seven points clear in the NIFL Premiership, and the club lost 3–2 to Linfield, with Ross Redman missing a penalty in the final minute of the match. This saw &quot;The Ports&quot; fall away in the league, but in the Irish Cup quarter-final, they took on Linfield once again at Shamrock Park. Portadown were 3–0 up after about 30 minutes. They went on to win the match 3–2.

Portadown took on Ballymena United in the Irish Cup semi-final at The Oval. Portadown sealed their place in the final by winning 3–1. With the Kop Stand at Windsor Park collapsing, the final was forced to be moved to The Oval, where they would take on Glentoran. In the league, Portadown played Glenavon at Mourneview Park with the winner being guaranteed third place and a lucrative UEFA Europa League qualifying round spot. Glenavon raced into a two-goal lead before James Singleton was sent off for clashing with Ken Oman. Portadown had levelled it 2–2 through Peter McMahon and Gary Twigg goals, before Eoin Bradley was hauled down by Ross Redman and a last-minute penalty was dispatched by Andy McGory to give the Lurgan Blues European football. The Irish Cup final at The Oval saw the Ports go into the game as favourites, in what was initially quite a cagey affair on an incredibly wet day in East Belfast. In the second half, David Scullion scored to give &quot;The Glens&quot; the lead and what would prove to be the only goal of the game after an incredibly controversial moment, when Ports midfielder Michael Gault was fouled clean through on goal, and Glens keeper Elliott Morris picked up the resulting pass, with the referee, linesman and goal line official unbelievably letting play continue. Goal line official, Raymond Crangle would state in the aftermath his apology to Portadown officials, stating his belief that he thought it was a clear foul, but due to a technical glitch with his headset, was unable to attract the referees attention. Ports boss Ronnie McFall was quoted in saying the following: &quot;It was a trip and straight red card, the television pictures clearly show that,&quot; he blasted.
&quot;Gary Twigg was also pulled down in the box in the first half and there was a blatant handball in the second half but the referee and officials just weren&#x27;t up to it.
&quot;They keep making major mistakes and they are never downgraded. Things carry on as if nothing happened.
&quot;It&#x27;s a straight red card and free-kick for us. And it&#x27;s not one person making a decision, you have the assistant and man behind the goals and they missed these incidents?
&quot;I&#x27;m looking at the standard of refereeing and some of them should still be in junior football, learning the game.&quot; 

====2015–16 season-End of McFall Era====
The club suffered greatly financially from the result in the final meaning their transfer activity was limited in the summer of 2015. However, they started the season by beating the champions Crusaders 2–1 and Warrenpoint Town by the same scoreline three days later. Results declined rapidly thereafter, and the fans began to pressure the board to consider McFall&#x27;s position as manager. The manager and staff were barracked by the support, and during a 3–1 defeat to Crusaders at Shamrock Park, supporters protested with a banner asking for the sacking of the manager, which was removed by the chairman, who argued with supporters. After the game assistant manager Kieran Harding, accusing Portadown fans protesting as being &quot;...not real supporters,&quot; called them &quot;Imposters&quot;.

In January the club signed former Linfield midfielder Philip Lowry in the hope that fortunes would improve. Lowry created a reasonable impact, scoring from outside the box in a win over Coleraine in the Irish Cup, and again in a 2–1 win over Linfield. Things were slowly improving until Portadown were beaten 4–1 by rivals Glenavon at Mourneview Park.

The club took on NIFL Championship 1 side Lurgan Celtic in the Irish Cup Quarter Final, with the Lurgan side scoring twice in quick succession to go into a 2–0 lead at halftime. Portadown piled on the pressure in the second half to level the score at 2–2 with goals from Marcio Soares and Sean Mackle, before conceding a penalty in the closing minutes which Lurgan Celtic defender Raymond Fitzpatrick converted to send the Lurgan side through to their first-ever Irish Cup Semi Final against Linfield. The result that afternoon marked Ronnie McFall&#x27;s last game as Portadown boss. He resigned following the defeat, marking an end to his 29 years at the club.

The following day, it was announced former defender Pat McGibbon, who had come in earlier that season as the club&#x27;s physiotherapist, would take over as interim manager until the end of the season, with club legend Vinny Arkins coming on board as his assistant coach. Despite only winning once in ten games as caretaker manager, McGibbon was appointed as manager on a two-year contract and helped the club successfully avoid relegation. They finished the season ninth in the league.

====2016–17 season====
Before the start of 2016–17 season, the club was fined £10,000 which was halved on appeal to £5,000 and received a one-year ban on signing professional contracts until June 2017 for not declaring extra payments made to striker Gary Twigg for performing coaching work over the summer. The club also received a 12-point deduction in the league for 2016–17 season for an administrative error made in relation to the contract of exiled midfielder Peter McMahon, who later left the club in July 2016.

Despite starting the season with a major disadvantage, McGibbons side produced victories over Carrick Rangers and Ballinamallard United and were narrowly beaten by many of the teams higher up in the table. However, after a series of poor results in October 2016, Pat McGibbon resigned as manager.

Both Arkins and long serving coach Trevor Williamson remained at the club with Arkins taking over as caretaker manager. Arkins took charge for the match against Coleraine at Shamrock Park, where they lost 1–0.

Arkins won his first official match in charge as interim manager in a 2–1 win against Ballinamallard United with goals from Stephen Hughes and a penalty from Niall Henderson. It was followed up with a 3–1 win over Ards with goals from Robert Garrett, Stephen Hughes and Brendan Shannon scoring his first goal for the club from the penalty spot. However, it was later found that the club had fielded midfielder Robert Garrett, who was supposed to be serving a one-game ban with Ards officials informing the club that they believed that Garrett was suspended.Ards were subsequently awarded a 3–0 win with the Ports being fined £500. Arkins left the club following a 0–5 defeat to Linfield. On 5 December 2016, Portadown-born Niall Currie was appointed as manager after successfully agreeing his release from Ards with him and his loyal assistant Jay Willis joining the club. Upon his first match against Cliftonville at Solitude, they were defeated 1–0. Prior to the match, it was announced that longtime goalkeeper David Miskelly would be retiring immediately due to a shoulder injury sustained the previous season after serving 12 years and making over 400 appearances with the club.

Currie&#x27;s first win as Portadown manager came in a 2–0 win over Dungannon Swifts at Shamrock Park. The Ports approached the annual Boxing Day derby with rivals Glenavon not being in great form with the Ports racing into a surprise two-goal lead with goals from Mark Carson and Aaron Haire. However, the Lurgan Blues had seemingly grabbed a point with them pulling a goal back within the last ten minutes and Sykes scoring a long distance free kick in the dying seconds of the game amid wild scenes of celebration from the Glenavon supporters. Portadown&#x27;s luck had finally changed, however, with it later being found that Glenavon had fielded defender David Elebert, who was due to serve a suspension through yellow cards picked up in reserve league fixtures with the Lurgan side, receiving a fine, and the Ports being awarded a 3–0 win and a valuable 3 three points.

The club earned a 1–1 draw with title chasing Linfield at Windsor Park. This was followed up with another credible 1–1 draw with champions Crusaders. The club went into a game against relegation rivals Carrick Rangers with the knowledge that a defeat would all but condemn them to relegation to which they lost the game 3–2.&quot;The Ports&quot;&#x27; relegation was officially confirmed following a 3–2 defeat to Ards on Easter Tuesday fixture.

====Championship spell 2017–20====

The summer following Portadown&#x27;s relegation saw significant changes in the playing line up. The club opened their Championship campaign with a 3–0 win over Larne and a 2–1 win over Limavady United at Shamrock Park before dropping their first points in a 1–1 draw away to PSNI. The following fixture was the first defeat for the Ports in the Championship, losing 2–1 at home to Institute. The response that followed was a 4–1 win away to Newry City. However the response was short lived and saw four consecutive league defeats to Dergview, Knockbreda, H&amp;W Welders and Ballyclare Comrades with mounting pressure on Ports boss Niall Currie who had built a team which very quickly had not lived up to expectations. A 3–0 win over Loughgall served to paper over the cracks for a Saturday, before a 1–4 home defeat to Newry drew heavy criticism from the home support who made their feelings well known throughout the game and at full time.

At this point the club, who had expected winning the league and promotion as a certainty was languishing closer to the bottom of the league than the top with the thoughts of potentially another relegation entering the minds of many. The winter period however saw a slightly better improvement with the Ports picking up 15 points from the next eight games which included a 1–1 draw and a 6–0 win over Lurgan Celtic and a 7–0 win over Dergview having lost to the Castlederg side earlier in the season. Furthermore, the Boxing Day fixture saw a 4–1 win away to Loughgall which featured a hat trick from Gary Warwick. The January period saw the Ports sitting in 6th place with the split looming and picking up 5 points from 3 games to secure a top six with a late equalizer against Larne (Sitting in 7th) scored by Chris Lavery sealing it. Furthermore, however The Ports lost out in the Irish Cup in extra time to league rivals to Ballyclare Comrades.

What followed was a run of fixtures that was of huge importance which started with a 2–1 win over Loughgall with many thinking that the team had hit form at just the right time. The positivity quickly disappeared however following a 1–0 defeat away to Ballyclare Comrades in the first of nine crucial fixtures and what was the 4th defeat that season to Ballyclare. The following fixture saw a 0–0 draw with the Welders, the game saw the end of Niall Curries tenure as Portadown manager who was relieved of his duties following the result. In February 2018 it was confirmed that Portadown had made an approach and had been successful in appointing ex striker and Warrenpoint Town boss Matthew Tipton with David Miskelly joining as his assistant.

In Tiptons first game in charge the Ports secured a 1–1 draw with league leaders Institute and 4 consecutive wins followed against Loughgall, Newry City and Harland and Wolff Welders with anticipation building that a play off spot would have been very much possible. The team were positioned in 4th place needing 3rd to secure a play off place. A huge game away to Newry City followed with three points for the men in red securing a pre play off spot against Newry. The game ultimately ended 0–0 with a red card for Jamie Douglas and the visitors ultimately coming up short.

The following season, Tipton would seek to shape the Portadown squad to his liking, making a total of 16 signings notably Kevin Braniff and Johnny Flynn on free transfers from Ballymena United, former players Darren Murray and Sean Mackle returned to the club from Crusaders and Warrenpoint Town respectively. That particular season the Ports were challenged in a big way by Larne F.C., who were now subject to significant investment and were favourites to win the NIFL Championship in 2019. The first ten games of the season would see the Ports pick up 5 wins, 4 draws and 1 defeat in what was a fairly respectable return from the opening part of the season that saw them score 19 points out of a possible 30. As the season progressed, they often failed to pick up points away from home that saw them ultimately finish in third place behind Larne and Carrick Rangers with the latter overcoming the men in red in a promotion playoff which the Gers won 2–0.

===Promotion and Premiership spells 2020-===
The club achieved promotion in the 2020-21 NIFL Championship season, having fought Ballinamallard United down to the wire, in a season that was curtailed by the Covid-19 Pandemic. The following season, the Ports finished 9th, with wins over Glenavon and Larne to secure NIFL Premiership safety. Striker Lee Bonis contributed 14 goals throughout the season.

The following season proved to be a more difficult one, which saw the departure of manager Matthew Tipton with the club languishing in the relegation play-off place, under threat from the chasing Warrenpoint Town.
Former midfielder Paul Doolin was appointed as Tiptons replacement, and his initial appointment saw Ports defeat Warrenpoint Town, Ballymena United and Coleraine to secure safety from automatic relegation and set up a play-off with neighbors Annagh United. A standout performance from Billy Stedman saw the Ports come from 2–1 down to win 3–2 in the 1st leg, and a 1–0 win in the 2nd leg securing safety for the 2021–22 season.

The following season the Ports would struggle for form, picking up just 1 point from 11 games, with heavy criticism from supporters following a 3–1 home defeat to newly promoted Newry City, in what many considered a must win game, and a worrying sign of what was to come. Doolin would depart the club after a 4–0 defeat away to Crusaders the following game.

The club would move fairly quickly to appoint Dundela manager Niall Currie, who previously managed the Ports from 2016 to 2018. Currie would bring in former Glenavon striker and free agent Greg Moorhouse, who would prove a needed addition to address the Ports lack of goals.

The Ports would continue to struggle before Christmas, picking up their first win of the season at home to Ballymena United on the 10th December. Currie would sign heavily in the January transfer window, bringing in players from former club Dundela, as well as notably Cathair Friel and Alan O&#x27;Sullivan, on loan from Coleraine and Warrenpoint Town respectively, and Paul McElroy from Ballymena United.

O&#x27;Sullivan would star with two goals in a 3–1 win over Mid Ulster rivals Glenavon in February, with the Ports picking up a further 10 points from the next 5 games, including a 4–3 win away to Newry City, having been 3–2 down in stoppage time, with some heralding &#x27;The Great Escape&#x27; for a side whose survival hopes appeared to be gone at Christmas. However, the great escape wasn&#x27;t to be, and the Ports 3–2 defeat away to relegation rivals Dungannon Swifts sealed their relegation after a spirited survival attempt under Currie.

The Ports would have a relatively difficult start to life in the Championship, which saw defeats to Bangor, H&amp;W Welders and Ballyclare Comrades, however would remain in promotion contention. The Ports would also defeat Dungannon Swifts in the final of the Mid-Ulster Cup, their first win and appearance in the final of the competition since 2003, and would also reach the final of the League Cup for the first time since 2011, following wins over Coagh United, Crusaders, Loughgall and Glenavon to set up a final against Linfield.

The Ports would seal their return to the NIFL Premiership following a draw with table rivals Dundela, lifting the trophy the following week against Institute.

<text>Futbolo klubas Žalgiris, commonly known as FK Žalgiris, Žalgiris Vilnius or simply Žalgiris, is a Lithuanian professional football club based in Vilnius. The club competes in the A Lyga, the top flight of Lithuanian football. The club was founded as Dinamo in 1947. The club&#x27;s name commemorates the victorious &quot;Battle of Žalgiris&quot; (Battle of Grunwald) (both names: &quot;Žalgiris&quot; and &quot;Grunwald&quot; are translated as &quot;green forest&quot;). Žalgiris has featured many Lithuanian football legends during its history including Arminas Narbekovas, Valdas Ivanauskas, Edgaras Jankauskas and Deividas Šemberas. They have won the Lithuanian Championship 10 times, the Lithuanian Football Cup 14 times, and the Lithuanian Supercup 7 times.

The team&#x27;s colours are green and white. The club plays at LFF stadium in Vilnius which has a capacity of 5,067.

After beating Malmö in the second round of Champions League qualifying in July 2022, Žalgiris secured themselves group stage football and became the first ever Lithuanian club to qualify for the group stages of a UEFA club competition; where they dropped into the Europa Conference League group stage after losing in the Europa League play-offs. They would finish bottom of their group with five points, and one win from their six games.

==History==
===Foundation and Soviet period===
The first incarnation of the club played in 1946 as a national team of Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic when it competed in USSR Group III Zone 4 championship and it was one of the clubs which represented one of the Soviet republics. The club consisted of Spartakas Kaunas and Dinamo Kaunas players. Their first match was against Stroitel Moscow which ended 1–1 and they were managed by French coach Emil Pastor. That year they finished in fourth place in RSFSR Western Zone championship.

The club is thought to have been founded in 1947 when it was moved from Kaunas to Vilnius and its name was changed to Dinamo Vilnius. First official match of the formed club was played on 16 May 1947 against Lokomotiv Moscow, who managed to defeat local team 1–2. Steponas Petraitis scored the first official goal for the club that day, beating goalkeeper from a penalty spot in 44th minute. The next year club changed its name to Spartakas Vilnius and used this name until the end of 1961 season. In 1962, they changed their name to Žalgiris.

Žalgiris competed in Soviet Union football league system from 1947 to 1989. Team achieved its first promotion to the top tier in 1952, but came last next season.

Before the start of the 1983 season in Soviet Top League, players initiative group demanded the resignation of coach Benjaminas Zelkevičius, and the players wish was granted as, Algimantas Liubinskas became the trainer.
Start was cautious. A similar result 0–0 has played in Tashkent with Pakhtakor, in Leningrad with Zenit, in Vilnius with Dynamo. In the fourth match of the season against Neftchi in Baku, Gražulis scored goal on 1–0 and brought victory. There were victories and failures, but Žalgiris became the winners of the first round. In first place Žalgiris stayed short, Nevertheless, final fifth place is the highest achievement of Lithuanian football on this time and gives a great hope for future. Arminas Narbekovas, Romas Mažeikis, and Vladimiras Buzmakovas succeeded in the team in that season.

In 1984 Soviet Top League season, Žalgiris finished on 9 place among 18 teams, but rejoiced victories against FC Dynamo Kyiv (1–0 at home), FC Spartak Moscow (twice 2–1), FC Dynamo Moscow (1–0 at home, 2–1 in Moscow). and Valdas Ivanauskas debuted in first team.

The club&#x27;s most successful season was in 1987 when they finished third in the Soviet Top League and qualified for 1988–89 UEFA Cup where they played against Austria Wien, while also for the first time in club&#x27;s history reaching semi–finals of the 1987–88 Soviet Cup (after being eliminated in quarter-finals of the 1955, 1959–60, 1964 campaigns) and 1987 USSR Federation Cup. The club represented the Soviet Union at 1987 Summer Universiade which they won by defeating the South Korean team. In the following season they finished fifth and again qualified for UEFA Cup where they faced IFK Göteborg in the first round and Red Star Belgrade in the second. In 1988, several of Žalgiris players were decorated with medals in the USSR national teams: Vyacheslav Sukristov received silver medal of the UEFA Euro 1988, and Arminas Narbekovas and Arvydas Janonis brought back gold medals from the 1988 Summer Olympics. In 1989 the club finished in fourth place and for the third year in a row qualified for UEFA Cup. They managed to play one game in 1990 at the start of the season before withdrawing due to re-establishment of Lithuania&#x27;s independence and joined the Baltic League which consisted of clubs from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Therefore, they lost their place in UEFA Cup, which was taken by Chornomorets Odesa.

===1990–2007===
Following Lithuania&#x27;s declaration of independence on 11 March 1990, Žalgiris left Soviet Top League with immediate effect. Despite most of the top players including Arminas Narbekovas, Valdas Ivanauskas, Igoris Pankratjevas, Vyacheslav Sukristov and Robertas Fridrikas leaving the club Žalgiris remained favorites to clinch the Lithuanian title and won A Lyga regular season having lost just once in 32 games. The championship, however, was decided by the knock-out competition where Žalgiris lost in the semi-finals to Ekranas Panevėžys and only managed to take a third place.

Green and whites took their first A Lyga title the following season when they won the regular season, took the revenge against Ekranas beating them in the semi-finals and won the final against Lietuvos Makabi Vilnius 3–1 with Ričardas Zdančius scoring a hat-trick. Žalgiris completed the double later that year by winning the Lithuanian cup.

The 1991 season was followed by two significant changes in league format: the knock-out competition was removed and league was reorganized to be played from autumn until spring. Žalgiris saw off the challenge from Panerys Vilnius to defend their title by a single point. There were no double in this year, however: Lietuvos Makabi took revenge for their defeat in last season&#x27;s league final and beat Žalgiris in the final 1–0. In the summer of 1992, Žalgiris made their debut in the UEFA Champions League. Europe&#x27;s elite proved to be merciless: PSV Eindhoven hammered Žalgiris 8–0 on aggregate in the first round.

In 1992–93 season things went the other way round in national competitions: having lost the national title to FK Ekranas by three points Žalgiris reclaimed the cup, beating Sirijus Klaipėda 1–0 in the final courtesy of the extra-time goal by Aurelijus Skarbalius. A similar story happened in the 1993–94 season when ROMAR Mažeikiai narrowly beat Vilnius&#x27; side to the title while Žalgiris defended the cup by beating FK Ekranas 4–2 in the final. Darius Maciulevičius was the hero of that day scoring a hat-trick and Aidas Preikšaitis added another from the penalty spot.

1994–95 season delivered a double blow for the side from the capital. Žalgiris and Inkaras Kaunas finished the league locked on points at the top and extra match on neutral ground was set to be played. Inkaras Kaunas beat Žalgiris 2–0 in Panevėžys and four days later the same two teams met in Klaipėda for cup final. Inkaras once again came out better off as former Žalgiris man Eimantas Poderis scored twice in a 2–1 victory for Kaunas&#x27; side. 1995–96 season did not bring silverware either: free scoring Žalgiris side racked up 106 goals in just 28 games in the league yet could only take a third place, six points behind champions Inkaras Kaunas. On this time Edgaras Jankauskas was top scorer A Lyga with 25 goals. He was later sold to CSKA Moscow.

Things did not go well in the cup as well as Vilnius&#x27; side lost to Kareda Šiauliai in the semi-finals and failed to advance to the final for the first time in six years. Žalgiris reclaimed the cup in 1996–97 season as Donatas Vencevičius&#x27; penalty was enough to see off Inkaras in the final but had to settle for second in the league as Kareda coasted to the title with an 8-point margin. Green and whites mounted a stronger challenge in 1997–98 yet Kareda proved its success has been no fluke by defending their title.

The elusive title finally came in 1998–99 season, the last one to be played from autumn until spring. Defense was the key to success as Žalgiris conceded just 8 goals in 23 games and did not lose a single league match that season. Things were different in the cup as Kareda dismantled Žalgiris 7–0 on aggregate in the semi-finals. The league title allowed Žalgiris to have another try in the UEFA Champions League and this time Vilnius&#x27; side eliminated Armenian champions Araks Ararat before succumbing to a defeat to last season&#x27;s semi-finalists Dynamo Kyiv in the second round.

With a turn of the century a new force rose in Lithuanian football: FBK Kaunas. Under the name of Žalgiris Kaunas they won the transitional shortened league season in 1999 and then backed it up by consecutive titles in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004. Žalgiris on the other hand went into decline and cup final win in 2003 proved to be the sole piece of silverware for the club in the 2000s. In the league Žalgiris started to struggle as well. While in 1999 and 2000 green and whites finished second, 2001 saw them dropping to third, 2002 to fourth and 2005 to the recently unimaginable lows of eighth. Žalgiris was not even the strongest team in the capital as newcomers Vėtra and FC Vilnius were clearly having better time on the pitch.

Despite a constant presence in European competitions the results there were rarely encouraging with the aggregate defeats like 2–7 to Ruch Chorzow and 0–7 to Maccabi Tel Aviv. Budapest Honved and Portadown were the only teams eliminated by Žalgiris between 2000 and 2004. 2005 UEFA Intertoto Cup thus stood out as a major success as green and whites went past three teams – Lisburn Distillery, Dinaburg and Egaleo, before being eliminated by CFR Cluj.

===2008–2016===
The struggles of the noughties culminated in 2008. The league finish of fifth could have been seen as adequate for the time (20 points gap to fourth-placed Sūduva was harder to take) but as country&#x27;s economy braced for the inevitable crisis, expenditures were cut and uncertainty rose Žalgiris was dealt a big blow when club owner Vadim Kastujev was arrested in Moscow. Striped of funds club survived until the end of the season but failed to meet licensing requirements for top flight competition in 2009. With old club&#x27;s future very much in doubt fans of Žalgiris founded a new phoenix club called VMFD Žalgiris which had the same players and staff, and following unsuccessful application for A Lyga license entered second division.

A year outside of top flight proved to be difficult. Žalgiris finished sixth in seven team league and were eliminated from the cup in the Round of 16 by Sakuona Plikiai, a team from a town with a population of just 600. Despite this bleak performance the club received promotion to A Lyga as the number of teams in top flight was increased and some other clubs refused to join in mainly because of financial burden. Žalgiris finished 2010 season in the third place, their highest since 2001.

The fortunes of Žalgiris went all uphill from there. With FBK Kaunas in complete turmoil and Vėtra bankrupt Ekranas for several years became the undisputed superpower of Lithuanian football. Green and whites were closing in, however: Žalgiris took second in 2011, eight points adrift, and closed the gap to a single point a year later. Moreover, in 2012 Vilnius side finally ended their nine-year trophy drought and won Lithuanian Football Cup, beating Ekranas on penalties following a 0–0 draw. The same season saw Žalgiris returning to European competitions but their UEFA Europa League campaign proved to be short: following 1–1 draw in Vilnius, Admira Wacker Mödling hammered Žalgiris 5–1 in the second leg of the second qualifying round.

Žalgiris were considered to be strong favorites for the title before the 2013 season and for much of the season it looked that they would cruise to the championship. Žalgiris had eleven points lead over second-placed Atlantas with five games remaining but four draws in the row followed and before the final match of the season the gap at the top was reduced to three points. In final match out of form Žalgiris proved to be no match for Sūduva and for much of the day prospect of season decider on neutral venue looked very likely. However, in tense atmosphere it was Atlantas who ultimately let it slip as they could only draw the game with Banga Gargždai and Žalgiris celebrated their first title in fourteen years. Victory in Cup final against Šiauliai meant that the double was won—the first since 1991. The great year was backed up by successful performance in UEFA Europa League where Vilnius&#x27; side eliminated St. Patrick&#x27;s Athletic, Pyunik Yerevan and Lech Poznan before losing out to Red Bull Salzburg.

Defending the title in 2014 proved to be far more routine task. Žalgiris finished the season 18 points clear of second-placed Kruoja Pakruojis (the largest winning margin in the league since 2006) and also claimed the cup for the third time in the row, beating Banga Gargždai 2–1 in the final. The club made return to UEFA Champions League after fourteen-year absence yet it did not bring much joy as Dinamo Zagreb beat Žalgiris 4–0 on aggregate in the second qualifying round.

In May 2015 Žalgiris won Lithuanian cup for a record fourth time in the row, beating Atlantas 2–0 in the final. UEFA Champions League campaign was again limited to just two games as Malmo won the return leg in Vilnius 1–0 after goalless first match in Sweden. Žalgiris finished the season top of the league, ten points clear of second-placed Trakai thus claiming third successive title.

In the 2016 season, Žalgiris continued its dominance in Lithuanian football in 2016 with fourth consecutive league title and, remarkably, two cup wins. LFF Cup was rescheduled to be played from spring until autumn that year and therefore two editions of the cup have been played that year. Žalgiris won the first final in May with 1–0 extra time win over Trakai and backed it up with 2–0 final win over Sūduva in September. European experience proved to heartbreaking as following a goalless draw in the first leg in Vilnius Žalgiris was a whisker away from eliminating Astana only to concede an injury time goal to lose the game 2–1.

===2016–present===
In the 2017 season, Žalgiris failed to progress beyond the Champions League&#x27;s second qualifying round once again in 2017 when impressive first leg win over Ludogorets Razgrad and an early goal by Serge Nyuiadzi in the second leg were completely undone by four straight goals by Bulgarian side. In September 2017, Žalgiris reached the seventh consecutive cup final, where they lost to Stumbras, who appeared in their first major final. Žalgiris failed to defend the league title, while they were in top position of the standings until October 2017, but a late march by Sūduva saw them winning their first-ever championship.

In the 2018 season, Žalgiris finished in second place as Sūduva defended their league title, while Žalgiris managed to win the cup in a repeat of last year&#x27;s final as they defeated Stumbras. Playing in the UEFA Europa League, Žalgiris reached the third qualifying round where they lost to Spain&#x27;s Sevilla, which was their best performance in European competition since 2013 when they reached the play-off round of the qualification in the UEFA Europa League. In November 2018, Žalgiris announced that Deividas Česnauskis and Deividas Šemberas joined the club. Česnauskis was appointed as sports director, Šemberas as the director of sports operations.

During the 2019 preseason, head coach Valdas Urbonas signed a contract with the Lithuanian Football Federation and became the head coach of Lithuania national team. Žalgiris then appointed Marek Zub, who was previously successfully working in the club, as head coach. However, Zub left Žalgiris on 15 July 2019. João Luís Martins, who became available after the dissolution of FC Stumbras, took on the job of head coach on a temporary basis until the end of the season.

In January 2020, Žalgiris announced the appointment of Juan Ferrando as head coach. However, Ferrando was forced to pull out due to health issues. Later that month, Alyaksey Baha was signed as the team&#x27;s new head coach. He started off with a success by winning the Lithuanian Supercup on 29 February against champions FK Sūduva. Žalgiris went on to win the 2020 A Lyga. In both 2021 and 2022, they won the double consisting of the A Lyga and LFF cup title.

In July 2022, after beating Malmö 3–0 on aggregate in the Champions League second qualifying round, Žalgiris made history by guaranteeing themselves group stage football for the season. They played Ludogorets in the play-off of the Europa League, but lost on aggregate and dropped into the Conference League group stage. They were the first ever Lithuanian club to qualify for the group stages of a UEFA club competition. Žalgiris were subsequently drawn into Group H against the Swiss stalwarts Basel, Slovakian champions Slovan Bratislava and Armenian champions Pyunik. The team would finish bottom of the group with five points from their six matches.

Žalgiris finished the 2023 A Lyga season in second place, twelve points behind winning team FK Panevėžys, who won their first-ever league title. At the end of the season, Saulius Mikoliūnas, who had been with the club since 2016 and has appeared in over 200 games for Žalgiris, retired from professional football.

==Name history==
==Stadium==

For the majority of the time Žalgiris played in Žalgiris Stadium. This stadium was the biggest in Lithuania and had a capacity of 15,029.

Since 2011 Žalgiris plays in LFF Stadium (Lithuanian Football Federation stadium). This arena, formerly known as Vėtra Stadium, was built in 2004 and holds around 5,000 people.

After the bankruptcy of FK Vėtra football club, LFF took control of the stadium.

It is situated near Vilnius Old Town, 400 metres up the Aušros vartų and Liepkalnio streets from the Gate of Dawn (Lithuanian: Aušros vartai)

==Supporters==

This community is united by their love and loyalty to Žalgiris. Pietų IV is the leader of organised supporting in Baltic states.

The establishment date of Pietų IV is considered October 1985. Since that time fans have been supporting the team while singing, waving flags and creating impressive choreography. Fans helped Žalgiris to survive the financial crisis. During hard periods they organized various events and collected enough money to remain. Pietų IV and the managers of the club together are the founders of Žalgiris Vilnius.

Žalgiris supporters maintain friendly relations with fans of Atlantas. Internationally, there are close historical ties with supporters of Dynamo Kyiv, Karpaty Lviv and Dinamo Tbilisi.

==Kit==
From the establishment of the club, Žalgiris colours were blue, red or sometimes orange. In the 1980s green and white kits were introduced, establishing green/white tradition. From then on, the kit is usually a green and white striped jersey and green/white variation of shorts and socks. In the past there have also been checkered green-white jersey designs. Away kits are usually plain white or green.

<text>Vanilla extract is a solution made by macerating and percolating vanilla pods in a solution of ethanol and water. It is considered an essential ingredient in many Western desserts, especially baked goods like cakes, cookies, brownies, and cupcakes, as well as custards, ice creams, and puddings. Although its primary flavor compound is vanillin, pure vanilla extract contains several hundred additional flavor compounds, which are responsible for its complex, deep flavor. By contrast, artificial vanilla flavor is typically made up of only artificially derived vanillin, which is frequently made from a by-product of the wood pulp industry.

Vanilla extract is the most common form of vanilla used today. Malagasy, Mexican, Tahitian, Indonesian, and Ugandan vanilla beans are the main varieties used today. The term &quot;Bourbon vanilla&quot; refers to the vanilla beans&#x27; provenance as being from the Bourbon Islands, most commonly Madagascar but also Mauritius and Réunion. The name comes from the period when the island of Réunion was ruled by the Bourbon kings of France and has no relation to Bourbon whiskey.

== Legal definitions ==

=== US regulations ===
In the United States, in order for a vanilla extract to be called pure, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires that the solution contain a minimum of 35% alcohol and 100g of vanilla beans per litre (13.35 ounces per gallon). Double and triple strength (up to 20-fold) vanilla extracts are also available, although these are primarily used for manufacturing and food service purposes where the amount of liquid in a recipe needs to be carefully monitored.

Natural vanilla flavoring is derived from vanilla beans with little to no alcohol. The maximum amount of alcohol that is usually present is only 2–3%. Therefore, by FDA regulations it cannot be called an extract.

=== Canadian regulations ===
Under the Food and Drug Regulations (C.R.C., c. 870), vanilla extract products have to be processed from vanilla beans: &quot;Vanilla planifolia&quot; or &quot;Vanilla tahitensia&quot;. For every 100 ml of extract, it must contain an amount of soluble substances proportional to their natural state available for extract. Specifically, if the beans contain &lt; 25% water content, the vanilla extract must consist of at least 10 g of vanilla beans; if the beans contain &gt; 25% water content, the vanilla extract must consist of at least 7.5 g of vanilla beans. Vanilla extract should not contain added colour.

<doc id="828090" wikidata="Q2249305" url="?curid=828090" title="Wheat flour">
<text>Wheat flour is a powder made from the grinding of common wheat used for human consumption. Wheat varieties are called &quot;soft&quot; or &quot;weak&quot; if gluten content is low, and are called &quot;hard&quot; or &quot;strong&quot; if they have high gluten content. Hard flour, or &quot;bread flour&quot;, is high in gluten, with 12% to 14% gluten content, and its dough has elastic toughness that holds its shape well once baked. Soft flour is comparatively low in gluten and thus results in a loaf with a finer, crumbly texture. Soft flour is usually divided into cake flour, which is the lowest in gluten, and pastry flour, which has slightly more gluten than cake flour.

In terms of the parts of the grain (the grass fruit) used in flour—the endosperm or protein/starchy part, the germ or protein/fat/vitamin-rich part, and the bran or fiber part—there are three general types of flour. White flour is made from the endosperm only. Brown flour includes some of the grain&#x27;s germ and bran, while whole grain or &quot;wholemeal flour&quot; is made from the entire grain, including the bran, endosperm, and germ. Germ flour is made from the endosperm and germ, excluding the bran.

== Milling ==
To produce refined (&quot;white&quot;) wheat flour, grain is usually tempered, i.e. moisture added to the grain, before milling, to optimize milling efficiency. This softens the starchy &quot;endosperm&quot; portion of the wheat kernel, which will be separated out in the milling process to produce what is known to consumers as &quot;white flour&quot;. The addition of moisture also stiffens the bran and ultimately reduces the energy input required to shatter the kernel, while at the same time avoiding the shattering of bran and germ particles to be separated out in this milling process by sieving or sifting.

The endosperm portion of the kernel makes up about 80% of the volume and is desirable because the products made from this white flour are often considered to have a milder flavor, smoother texture, and, in the case of bread, greater volume. The balance of the kernel is composed of the bran and the germ which tend to be coarser. With the invention of the roller milling system in the late 19th century, the bran and the germ were able to be removed, dramatically improving the appeal of baked products to the public.

The moistened grain is first passed through the series of break rollers, then sieved to separate out the fine particles that make up white flour. The balance are intermediate particles of endosperm (otherwise known as product &quot;middling&quot; or &quot;farina&quot;) and coarse particles of bran and germ. The middling then makes multiple passes through the reduction rolls, and is again sieved after each pass to maximize extraction of white flour from the endosperm, while removing coarser bran and germ particles.

To produce &quot;whole wheat&quot; flour, 100% of the bran and germ must be reintroduced to the white flour that the roller milling system was originally designed to separate it from. Therefore, these elements are first ground on another mill (usually a pin mill). These finer bran and germ fractions are then reintroduced to the endosperm (&quot;white flour&quot;) to produce whole wheat flour made of 100% of the kernel of wheat.

Flour manufacturers commonly add malted barley flour or fungal amylase to commercially-produced wheat flour. The enzymes in these additives increase the rate of conversion of starch to sugars when water is added to the flour, thus making more sugars available for yeast to metabolize during the bread-making process. Millers use the falling number to determine the quality of the wheat grains that are ground into flour.

==Types==
Wheat flour is available in many varieties; the categorization is regional, and the same name may have several different regional meanings.

===Canada===
*Whole wheat flour in Canada may have up to 5% of the grain removed; most of the germ is often removed to prevent the flour from going rancid.
*Whole grain flour contains the whole grain, including bran, germ and endosperm, but not the chaff

===Fiji===
*Sharp flour is produced in Fiji and primarily used in Indian cuisine.
===Indian wheat flours===
Indian flours are generally categorized by how much of the grain is stripped away.
* Wheat powder/flour – &#x27;whole grain&#x27; (mixture of germ, endosperm and bran)
* Atta flour – mixture of endosperm and bran
* Maida flour – endosperm, bleached; a very white flour, similar to the American bleached flour
* Sooji/rava – coarse-ground endosperm.

===Southeast Asia===
*Tang flour or wheat starch is a type of wheat flour used primarily in Chinese cuisine for making the outer layer of dumplings and buns. It is also used in Vietnamese cuisine, where it is called &quot;bột lọc trong&quot;.

===United States===
American flours are categorized by gluten/protein content, processing, and use.
*All-purpose or plain flour is a blended wheat with a protein content lower than bread flour, ranging between 9% and 12%. Depending on brand or the region where it is purchased, it may be composed of all hard or soft wheats, but is usually a blend of the two, and can range from low protein content to moderately high. It is marketed as an inexpensive alternative to bakers&#x27; flour which is acceptable for most household baking needs.
*Bread flour or strong flour is always made from hard wheat, usually hard spring wheat. It has a very high protein content, between 10% and 13%, making it excellent for yeast bread baking. It can be white or whole wheat or in between.
*Cake flour is a finely milled white flour made from soft wheat. It has very low protein content, between 8% and 10%, making it suitable for soft-textured cakes and cookies. The higher protein content of other flours would make the cakes tough. Related to cake flour are masa harina (from maize), maida flour (from wheat or tapioca), and pure starches.
*Durum flour is made from Durum wheat and is suited for pasta making, traditional pizza and flatbread for doner kebab.
*Graham flour is a special type of whole wheat flour. The endosperm is finely ground, as in white flour, while the bran and germ are coarsely ground. Graham flour is uncommon outside of the United States (but see atta flour, a similar product, below). Graham flour is the basis of true graham crackers.
*Instant flour is pregelatinized (precooked) for easier incorporation in gravies and sauces.
*Pastry flour or cookie flour or cracker flour has slightly higher protein content than cake flour but lower than all-purpose flour. Its protein content ranges between 9% and 10%. It is available as a white flour, a whole-wheat flour, or a white flour with the germ retained but not the bran. It is suitable for pie pastry and tarts, some cookies, muffins, biscuits and other quick breads. Flour is shaken through a sieve to reduce the amount of lumps for cooking pastry.
*Whole-wheat flour contains the wheat germ, endosperm and bran
*White flour or refined flour contains only the endosperm
* Whole-wheat white flour is white flour that contains the endososperm, bran, and germ 
*Enriched flour is white flour with nutrients added to compensate for the removal of the bran and germ
*Bleached flour is a white flour treated with flour bleaching agents to whiten it (freshly milled flour is yellowish) and give it more gluten-producing potential. Oxidizing agents are usually employed, most commonly organic peroxides like acetone peroxide or benzoyl peroxide, nitrogen dioxide, or chlorine. A similar effect can be achieved by letting the flour oxidize with oxygen in the air (&quot;natural aging&quot;) for approximately 10 days; however, this process is more expensive due to the time required. Flour bleached with benzoyl peroxide has been prohibited in the UK since 1997. 
*Bromated flour has a maturing agent added. The agent&#x27;s role is to help with developing gluten, a role similar to the flour bleaching agents. Bromate is usually used. Other choices are phosphates, ascorbic acid, and malted barley. Bromated flour has been banned in much of the world, as bromate is classified as possibly carcinogenic in humans (Group 2B) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), but remains available in the United States.
*Self-rising or self-raising flour is white flour that is sold premixed with chemical leavening agents. It was invented by Henry Jones. Self-rising flour is typically composed of the following ratio:
**1 cup (100 g) flour
** teaspoons (3 g) baking powder
**a pinch to  teaspoon (1 g or less) salt

===Other===
*Spelt flour is produced from the type of wheat called spelt. It is less commonly used in modern cooking than other wheat varieties. It is still used for specialty baking.

==Baking characteristics==
===W index===
The W index is an indicator of a flour&#x27;s strength which is commonly used by professional bakers. It is measured using a Chopin Alveograph, and it takes into account both the toughness and elasticity of the flour&#x27;s gluten. The W index is often not listed on commercial flour packaging, but it can be approximated based the flour&#x27;s protein content.

In general, a higher W index flour will require a longer rising time for leavened bread products. Higher W index flour better retains the CO2 produced during the fermentation process, because the gluten traps the produced gas.

===Zeleny sedimentation value===
The Zeleny sedimentation value is a measurement of how much of the flour sediments during a set period of time in a lactic acid solution. It is used to predict the baking characteristics of a particular cultivar. Since this test has costs associated with it, the Zeleny value may itself be estimated by EM irradiation and spectral analysis of the dry material. Where present, damage by insect pests and fungal diseases are the primary determinants of the sedimentation value, overwhelming the underlying genetic characteristics.

==National Flour==

===United Kingdom===

During World War II, the British government promoted National Flour; it was adopted in 1942 as a healthy and economic alternative to importing wheat. The flour is described as being of 85% extraction, i.e. containing more of the whole wheat grain than refined flour, generally described as 70% extraction at the time. Parliamentary questions on the exact constitution of National Flour in 1943 reveal that it was &quot;milled from a grist consisting of 90 per cent wheat and 10 per cent diluent grains. Authorised additions are calcium at the rate of per of flour and dried milk at the rate of per of flour and customary improvers in normal proportions.&quot; The diluent grains were barley, oats and rye and customary improvers were &quot;certain oxidising agents which improve the quality of the bread baked from the flour, and their nature depends on the kind of grain used, whether hard or soft&quot;. A survey of the composition of National Flour was conducted for the period 1946–1950. National Flour was discontinued in 1956 against the recommendations of the Medical Research Council as the government considered that the addition of nutritional supplements to refined flour removed the necessity for using National Flour on health grounds.

===Kenya===
National Flour was also a term for a flour introduced in Kenya by the colonial government which contained 70% wheat flour and 30% maize flour.

<text>A gamebook is a work of printed fiction that allows the reader to participate in the story by making choices. The narrative branches along various paths, typically through the use of numbered paragraphs or pages. Each narrative typically does not follow paragraphs in a linear or ordered fashion. Gamebooks are sometimes called choose your own adventure books or CYOA after the influential &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; series originally published by US company Bantam Books. Gamebooks influenced hypertext fiction.

Production of new gamebooks in the West decreased dramatically during the 1990s as choice-based stories have moved away from print-based media, although the format may be experiencing a resurgence on mobile and ebook platforms. Such digital gamebooks are considered interactive fiction or visual novels.

==Description==
Gamebooks range widely in terms of the complexity of the &quot;game&quot; aspect. At one end are the branching-plot novels, which require the reader to make choices but are otherwise like regular novels (this style is exemplified by the originator of the gamebook format, &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot;, and is sometimes referred to as &quot;American style&quot;).

At the other end of the spectrum are what amounts to &quot;solitaire RPG adventures&quot; or &quot;adventure gamebooks&quot;, which emulate a tabletop RPG in novel form and feature sophisticated rules for battling monsters and overcoming obstacles. The story can be decided by factors other than the reader&#x27;s choices, such as dice rolls (or other randomization mechanics, such as leafing through the book to arrive at a random paragraph number), the lack (or presence) of equipment or other items, or by various statistics, such as running out of health points.

The latter style is most commonly associated with the British &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; (FF) franchise (started in 1982), which originated, codified, and popularised much of the more advanced format that many later gamebooks would follow (the geographic dichotomy led to this type of gamebook sometimes being analogously referred to as &quot;British style&quot;). &quot;CYOA&quot; and &quot;FF&quot; are the two most popular, successful, and enduring gamebook franchises of all time, rendering them the archetypes of their respective, clashing styles and positions on the complexity spectrum. Later series like &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; and &quot;Fabled Lands&quot;, typically from Britain, would take the FF formula and push the limits of what could be achieved with printed text narratives (leading to, for example, twenty-book arcs in which the same created character could be taken sequentially from one to the next, or four or more books that contain interlocking references to each other in order to create one huge world map).

In all gamebooks, the story is presented as a series of sections of printed text. These are often but not always numbered. Branching-plot novel sections often run to several pages in length, whereas solitaire and adventure gamebook sections are usually no longer than a paragraph or two. These are not intended to be read in order. Instead, at the end of a text section, the reader is typically given a choice of narrative branches that they may follow. Each branch contains a reference to the number of the paragraph or page that should be read next if that branch is chosen (e.g. to go north turn to section 98). The narrative thus does not progress linearly through the book or follow the paragraphs in numerical order. The story continues this way until a paragraph or page which ends that branch of the story. Many solitaire or adventure gamebooks feature a single &quot;successful&quot; ending, and the remainder are &quot;failures&quot;. Thus, a gamebook becomes a &quot;puzzle&quot; since only a few or even one branching paths lead to victory. Branching plot novels, on the other hand, tend to be more concerned with narrative resolution rather than winning or losing, thus often have several endings which may be deemed equally &quot;successful&quot;.

Gamebooks are typically written in the second person with the reader assuming the role of a character to experience the world from that character&#x27;s point of view (e.g. &quot;you walk into the cold and dark forest&quot;).

Many gamebooks form series with a common theme, trade dress, and/or ruleset. While each book is typically a stand-alone narrative, there are gamebook series such as &quot;Steve Jackson&#x27;s Sorcery!&quot; that continue the narrative from the previous books in the series.

==History==

===Origins===
There are several examples of early works of art with branching narratives. The romantic novel &quot;Consider the Consequences!&quot; by Doris Webster and Mary Alden Hopkins was published in the United States in 1930, and boasts &quot;a dozen or more&quot; different endings depending on the &quot;taste of the individual reader&quot;. The 1936 play &quot;Night of January 16th&quot; by Ayn Rand, about a trial, is unusual in that members of the audience are chosen to play the jury and deliver a verdict, which then influences the play&#x27;s ending: guilty or not guilty.

Also quite early on, the possibility of having stories branching out into several different paths was suggested by Jorge Luis Borges in his short story &quot;An Examination of the Work of Herbert Quain&quot; (1941). This story features an author whose novel is a three-part story containing two branch points, and with nine possible endings. Another story by Borges, titled &quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot; (1941), also describes a book with a maze-like narrative, which may have inspired the gamebook form. The children&#x27;s book &quot;Treasure Hunt&quot;, published in 1945 in Britain under the name of &quot;Alan George&quot; (probably a pseudonym), is another early example of a story with multiple paths for the reader to follow.

Programmed learning materials have been recognized as an early influence on the development of branching path books. This learning method was first applied in the TutorText series of interactive textbooks, published from the late 1950s up until the early 1970s. These books present the reader with a series of problems related to a particular area of study, allowing him or her to choose among several possible answers. If the answer to a problem is correct, the reader moves on to the next problem. If the answer is incorrect, the reader is given feedback and is asked to pick a different answer. This educational technique would form a basis for many later narrative gamebook series.

During the 1960s, authors from several different countries started experimenting with fiction that contained multiple paths and/or endings. Some literary works in this vein include the French-language novel &quot;L&#x27;ironie du sort&quot; (1961) by Paul Guimard, the Spanish-language novels &quot;Hopscotch&quot; (1963) by Julio Cortázar and &quot;Juego de cartas&quot; (Card Game, 1964) by Max Aub, and the works of the French literary group known as the Oulipo (1967). Other early experiments include the short stories &quot;Alien Territory&quot; and &quot;The Lost Nose: a Programmed Adventure&quot; (both 1969) by John Sladek, the novel&quot; The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; (1969) by John Fowles, and the collection of short stories titled &quot;Tante storie per giocare&quot; (Many Tales to Play With, 1971) by Italian author Gianni Rodari. 

Taken together, these influences may have contributed to the development of several pioneering gamebooks in the 1960s and 1970s. These include &quot;Lucky Les&quot; by E.W. Hildick (1967), &quot;State of Emergency&quot; by Dennis Guerrier and Joan Richards (1969), the Swedish-language book &quot;Den mystiska påsen&quot; (The Mysterious Bag, 1970) by Betty Orr-Nilsson, and the French-language book &quot;Histoires comme tu voudras&quot; (Stories as You Want Them, 1978) by Marie-Christine Helgerson, among others.

===Breakthroughs and popularization===
In the US, &quot;The Adventures of You&quot; series appeared in 1976–77, with two titles that would later become part of the groundbreaking &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; series: &quot;Sugarcane Island&quot; by Edward Packard and &quot;Journey Under the Sea&quot; by R. A. Montgomery.

Tabletop role-playing games such as &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; were another early influence that would contribute in major ways to the development of the gamebook form. The first module which combined a branching-path narrative with a set of role-playing game rules was &quot;Buffalo Castle&quot; for the &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; system (1975). Buffalo Castle was innovative for its time, as it allowed the reader to experience a role-playing session without need for a referee. It has been followed by many other solitaire adventures for the T&amp;T system, as well as solos for other tabletop role-playing games.

The first commercially successful series of gamebooks was the &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; series establishing the &quot;American&quot; gamebook tradition. The &quot;British&quot; tradition, as exemplified by the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; series, was, by contrast, slightly younger. British gamebooks differ from the American tradition by having rules more strongly influenced by the game mechanics of roleplaying games.

====The US (late 1970s–)====
&quot;The Adventures of You&quot;, a two-book series, authored by Edward Packard and R.A. Montgomery and initially published by Vermont Crossroads Press, laid much of the groundwork for the later surge in popularity of the gamebook format. &quot;Sugarcane Island&quot; by Edward Packard was written in 1969 but did not see publication until 1976. This became a series when &quot;Journey Under the Sea&quot; by R. A. Montgomery was published in 1977. Two standalone gamebooks authored by Packard would follow, both published by Lippincott: &quot;Deadwood City&quot; (1978) and &quot;The Third Planet from Altair&quot; (1979). While these early efforts apparently achieved some popularity with readers, they (and the gamebook format in general) still did not have a publisher with the marketing strength required to make them available to mass audiences.

Packard and Montgomery took the idea of publishing interactive books to Bantam, and thus the &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; (CYOA) series was born in 1979, beginning with &quot;The Cave of Time&quot;. The series became immensely popular worldwide and several titles were translated into more than 25 languages. The series reached the peak of its popularity with children in the 1980s. It was during this period that Bantam released several other interactive series to capitalize on the popularity of the medium (a few examples are: &quot;Choose your Own Adventure for Younger Readers&quot;, &quot;Time Machine&quot; and &quot;Be An Interplanetary Spy&quot;). Many other American publishers released their own series to compete with CYOA.

One of the most popular competitors seems to have been TSR, who released several branching-path novels based on their own role-playing games. The most famous TSR series was &quot;Endless Quest&quot; (1982–). Another strong competitor was Ballantine with their &quot;Find Your Fate&quot; series, which featured adventures in the Indiana Jones, James Bond and Doctor Who universes. Famous author R. L. Stine wrote several books for this line, including &quot;The Badlands of Hark&quot;, as well as for other series such as Wizards, Warriors and You. Several &quot;Choose your Own Adventure&quot; spin-offs and many competing series were translated into other languages.

====The UK (early 1980s–)====
One of the most influential and popular gamebook series was the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; series, which started in 1980 when a Puffin Books representative saw a hall full of 5,000 people playing &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and asked Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson to make a book about role-playing games. They instead offered the idea of a book which simulated the experience of roleplaying games. Within a year they presented a book under the name of &quot;The Magic Quest&quot; to Puffin which Puffin agreed to publish. Having spent six more months developing the concept it was published under the name of &quot;The Warlock of Firetop Mountain&quot; in 1982.

Another notable UK gamebook series is &quot;Lone Wolf&quot;, developed by Joe Dever in 1984. Like &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot;, the writer was an experienced &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; player who developed the setting of Lone Wolf for his campaigns. However the books were also inspired by medieval texts such as &quot;Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; and &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;.

&quot;Grailquest&quot; is a series of gamebooks written by J.H. Brennan (also beginning in 1984) that were also inspired by the Arthurian legends. Set mainly on Avalon they make use of a dice based system.

&quot;The Way of the Tiger&quot;, a Japan-themed gamebook series by Mark Smith and Jamie Thomson (starting in 1985), is also a notable UK publication.

==== Outside the English-speaking world (mid 1980s–) ====
Branching-path books also started to appear during the 1980s in several other countries, including Spain, France, Italy, Mexico, Chile, Denmark and Japan.

Despite the domination of works that have been translated from English in most non-English-speaking countries, a sizable number of original gamebooks—both individual books and series—have been published in various countries; this is especially the case in France (e.g. the &quot;La Saga du Prêtre Jean&quot; series) and in Japan (e.g. Tokyo Sogensha&#x27;s &quot;Super Adventure Game&quot; series and Futabasha&#x27;s &quot;Bouken Gamebook&quot; series).

In some other countries, publication both of translated series and of original books began in later years. For example, the first original books in Brazil and Italy seem to have appeared in the 1990s.

==== Eastern Europe (late 1980s–) ====
Translated editions of &quot;Choose your Own Adventure&quot;, &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; and other English-language series only appeared in Eastern European countries after the fall of Communism.

Since the mid-1980s, about 90 gamebooks have been published in Poland, not only as printed books, but also as comics, e-books or mobile applications. The author of the largest number of titles (20) is Beniamin Muszyński. Polish gamebooks are regularly written by their fans and published online by &quot;Masz Wybór&quot; (publishing house which has been operating since 2010).

In the 1990s, the gamebook genre became highly popular in Bulgaria for approximately ten years. Whilst internationally well-known series such as &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; and &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; were translated for the Bulgarian market, the works of numerous Bulgarian gamebook authors were most popular with readers.

During the popularity peak of gamebooks in Bulgaria, Bulgarian publishing houses believed that only Western authors would sell and, as a consequence, virtually all Bulgarian gamebook authors adopted English pseudonyms. This tradition persisted after their nationality was publicly disclosed. A smaller number of Hungarian authors also adopted Western pseudonyms, in addition to &quot;official titles&quot; that were also in English.

Several adventure gamebooks have been released in the Czech Republic and Russia. In Azerbaijan, Narmin Kamal&#x27;s novel, &quot;Open It&#x27;s Me&quot;, offers the reader a choice to either read the book as a random collection of thirty-nine short stories about the same character, or as a single novel. A photo of the book&#x27;s hero is published on the final page and the author asks the reader questions about the character.

=== Decline and resurgence (1990s onward) ===
The branching-path book commercial boom dwindled in the early 1990s, and the number of new series diminished. However, new branching-path books continue to be published to this day in several countries and languages. &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; went on to become the longest running gamebook series with 184 titles. The first run of the series ended in 1998.

R. A. Montgomery started rereleasing some &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; titles in 2005. His company has also released some new titles. New books and series continue to be published in other countries to this day. Examples are the &quot;1000 Gefahren&quot; series in Germany and the &quot;Tú decides la aventura&quot; series in Spain. The sixtieth and &quot;lost&quot; entry in the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; series, &quot;Bloodbones&quot;, was finally published by Wizard in 2006.
In recent years, the format may be getting a new lease of life on mobile and ebook platforms.

==Types==
This type of book was seen predominantly as a form of entertainment for children. Nonetheless, there were books with more didactic purposes (ranging from historical series such as the aforementioned &quot;Time Machine&quot; to books with religious themes such as the Making Choices series). Also, a few branching-path books were aimed at adults, ranging from business simulations to works of erotica.

===Mainstream fiction===
Barring the aforementioned works of Dennis Guerrier in the 1960s, one of the earliest examples of the form is the five-volume &quot;Barcelona, Maxima Discrecion&quot; series, which adapted the noir fiction genre to an interactive form. Published in the 1980s, this series was only available in Catalan and Spanish.

Heather McElhatton published a bestselling gamebook for adults in 2007, called &quot;Pretty Little Mistakes: A Do-Over Novel&quot;. It was followed by a sequel titled &quot;Million Little Mistakes&quot; published in 2010.

Some contemporary literary novels have used the gamebook format, including Kim Newman&#x27;s &quot;Life&#x27;s Lottery&quot; (1999) and Nicholas Bourbaki&#x27;s &quot;If&quot; (2014).

===Education===
In 2011, McGraw-Hill Education began releasing adaptations of the original &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; titles as graded readers. The stories were retold in simplified language and re-organized plotlines, in order to make them easier for English as a second or foreign language readers to play. The choice format of gamebooks has proved to be popular with ESL teachers as a way to motivate reluctant students, target critical thinking skills, and organize classroom activities.

===Erotica===
Various erotic gamebooks have been published by major publishers. In 1994 &quot;Derrière la porte&quot; by Alina Reyes was published by Pocket Books France and Éditions Robert Laffont, and later translated into English for Grove Press and Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson (as &quot;Behind Closed Doors&quot;) and into Italian for Ugo Guanda Editore (as &quot;Dietro le porte&quot;). Melcher Media in 2003 packaged two &quot;Choose-Your-Own-Erotic-Adventure&quot; books for Penguin Books&#x27; Gotham Books imprint, including &quot;Kathryn in the City&quot; by Mary Anne Mohanraj, a well-known writer of erotica.

===Role-playing solitaire adventures===
Solitaire adventures were a parallel development. This type of book is intended to allow a single person to use the rules of a role-playing game to experience an adventure without need of a referee. The first role-playing game solitaire adventures to be published were those using the &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; system, beginning with the book Buffalo Castle in 1976, making &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; the first role-playing game to support solitaire play. Flying Buffalo released 24 solo adventure books (plus several pocket size adventures) in the period 1976–1993. A number of the adventures are still in print today. They were very successful among players of role-playing games and inspired many imitators.

Another early role-playing game with solitaire modules made for it was &quot;The Fantasy Trip&quot;. The first such module was &quot;Death Test&quot;, published in 1978. Eight adventures were released in total. One thing that set them apart was the need for miniatures and a hexmap, in order to take advantage of the combat and movement systems. These adventures were also very popular and influential.

Meanwhile, several third-party publishers started to publish solitaire adventures meant for use with popular roleplaying systems. Some of the earliest adventures in this vein were &quot;The Solo Dungeon&quot; (1978) by British author Richard Bartle, and &quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot; (1979), published by Judges&#x27; Guild in the United States. Both of these adventures were meant to be used with &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; rules.

Solitaire role-playing adventures also experienced a boom in the 1980s. Many role-playing rulesets included solo adventures which were intended to teach the rules systems to the players. Some companies released lines of solitaire adventures for their own games. Examples of games with prolific solitaire lines were &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, &quot;GURPS&quot;, &quot;Das Schwarze Auge&quot;, &quot;DC Heroes&quot;, and &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot;. Some third-party publishers continued to release solo adventures for established RPG systems (including Judges&#x27; Guild, who released solos for &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;). Solitaire adventures were also featured quite frequently in professional RPG magazines and fanzines. Several solo adventures (such as those for &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot;, &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, and &quot;Das Schwarze Auge&quot;) were translated into other languages.

As was the case with other types of gamebooks, the production of solitaire RPG adventures decreased dramatically during the 1990s. However, new solos continue to be published to this day. Some companies continue to produce solo adventures for &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot;. There are also new solo adventures for a variety of systems, and even some influenced by the &quot;Fantasy Trip&quot; solos (such as the ones by Dark City Games). The Internet has provided a channel to distribute solitaire adventures, with both free and commercial adventures made available as electronic documents.

===Adventures===
Adventure gamebooks incorporate elements from &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; books and role-playing solitaire adventures. The books involve a branching path format in order to move between sections of text, but the reader creates a character as in a role-playing game, and resolves actions using a game-system. Unlike role-playing solitaire adventures, adventure gamebooks include all the rules needed for play in each book. Adventure gamebooks are usually not divided into numbered pages, but rather into numbered sections of text, so that several sections may fit in a single page, or a single section can span several pages.

&quot;The Warlock of Firetop Mountain&quot; was published in 1982, the first of what became the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; series of gamebooks, one of the first adventure gamebook series. With over 60 titles, including a variety of spin-offs, the series popularised the gamebook format in the UK and many other countries, such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Singapore, the United States, Portugal, Tanzania, Brazil, Spain, France, Germany, Italy, Denmark, Israel, Japan, and after the fall of communism, Eastern Europe.

Several authors in different countries continue to publish adventure gamebooks in the late 2010s. Notable examples are German fantasy authors Wolfgang Hohlbein, Markus Heitz, and Lemonbits. Adventure gamebooks experienced a publishing boom in the 1980s, most notably in the United Kingdom, the United States, Italy and France. British series such as &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Lone Wolf&quot;, and &quot;The Way of the Tiger&quot; were translated into several languages and became very popular worldwide. The boom decreased considerably in the 1990s, with Fabled Lands being the last major British gamebook series. In the 2000s, reissues of the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; series emerged, and garnered some commercial success.

==Online adaptations==

Given the similar structure to html links between the pages of a website, numerous efforts have been made to create a digital equivalent to the gamebook format, with varying degrees of success. These include visual novels, story websites, and various experiments with audio CDs (such as TSR, Inc&#x27;s short-lived &quot;Terror TRAX&quot; line).

<doc id="828095" wikidata="Q278954" url="?curid=828095" title="Alonso de Guzmán y Sotomayor, 7th Duke of Medina Sidonia">
<text>Alonso Pérez de Guzmán y de Zúñiga-Sotomayor, 7th Duke of Medina Sidonia, GE (10 September 155026 July 1615), was a Spanish aristocrat who was most noted for his role as commander of the Spanish Armada that was to attack the south of England in 1588. He was a great-great grandson of Ferdinand II of Aragon.

== Family ==
Alonso&#x27;s father was Juan Carlos Pérez de Guzmán, who died in 1556. This was two years before the death of his own father, Juan Alfonso Pérez de Guzmán, 6th Duke of Medina Sidonia, meaning that Juan Carlos failed to inherit the ducal title and died merely as the 9th Count of Niebla.

His paternal grandmother, who died in 1528, was Ana de Aragón y de Gurrea, an illegitimate daughter of Alonso de Aragón y Ruiz de Iborra, Archbishop of Zaragoza, himself an illegitimate son of king Ferdinand II of Aragón. In 1518 Ana de Aragón had married in succession two Dukes of Medina Sidonia. The first marriage was to Alfonso Pérez de Guzmán, 5th Duke of Medina Sidonia, who was to die childless in 1548. He was declared insane (&quot;mentecato&quot;), which invalidated the marriage and vacated the succession to the title. The bride was then married, in the same year, to the 5th Duke&#x27;s brother, Juan Alfonso, the 6th Duke, born on 24 March 1502. He would survive his bride by three decades, dying at Sanlúcar de Barrameda, in the province of Cádiz, Spain, on 26 November, 1558.

Alonso&#x27;s mother was Leonor de Zúñiga y Sotomayor, a most powerful and wealthy woman, herself daughter of the powerful duchess Teresa de Zúñiga, 2nd marchioness of Ayamonte, 3rd duchess of Béjar, 4th countess of Bañares, 2nd marchioness of Gibraleón, so it was her name Zúñiga, the one to be passed to the family, as she was married to a &quot;Sotomayor&quot; of a family less endowed with nobility titles, county of Belalcázar, something by no means unique in the high Spanish aristocracy of the time.

As Alonso&#x27;s father, Juan Carlos, had already died in 1556, it was on the death of his grandfather in 1559, that Alonso, only some nine years of age at the time, inherited the ducal title along with one of the greatest fortunes in Europe.

==Betrothal and marriage==
The 7th duke was betrothed in 1569 to Ana de Silva y Mendoza, who was then four years of age, the daughter of the Prince and the Princess of Éboli. In 1572 when the duchess was little more than ten years of age, the pope granted a dispensation for the consummation of the marriage. The Duke of Medina Sidonia had a son, Juan Manuel, who succeeded his father.

A scandal of the time accused Philip II of a love intrigue with the young girl&#x27;s mother, the Princess of Éboli. The constant unvarying and apparently unmotivated favor the king showed the duke has been accounted for by claiming he simply took a fatherly interest in the girl. In any case no proof has been discovered of any relation between the king and the princess.

Don Alonso made no serious effort to save his mother-in-law Ana de Mendoza, Princess of Éboli from the later persecution she suffered at the hands of Philip II. His correspondence is full of whining complaints of poverty, and appeals to the king for pecuniary favors. In 1581 he was created a knight of the Golden Fleece, and was named Captain General of Lombardy. By pressing supplications to the king he got himself exempted on the ground of poverty and poor health.

Don Alonso was also the patron of Don Jerónimo Sánchez de Carranza who wrote the premier text on the Spanish system of swordplay which was called the &#x27;True Art&#x27; or the &quot;Verdadera Destreza&quot;. He was asked by King Philip II of Spain to lead the Spanish Armada.

==Spanish Armada==

===Preparations===
When the Marquis of Santa Cruz died, on 9 February 1588, Philip insisted on appointing the 7th Duke to the command of the Armada. He had prepared his orders to the Duke of Medina Sidonia already three days before the death of Santa Cruz. The motivation of Philip&#x27;s decision is unknown, but it may have been grounded in his consideration of the duke&#x27;s very high social rank, administrative competence, modesty and tactfulness, and last but not least his reputation as a good Catholic. The micro-managing king probably wanted a commander who would obey his instructions to the letter, which had been less likely had command been in the hands of Santa Cruz, or either of the most experienced officers in the Armada, Juan Martinez de Recalde and Miguel de Oquendo.

The disadvantages of this choice of Medina Sidonia were highlighted by the latter himself in a letter to the king, in which he stressed his lack of military experience on land and at sea, his lack of information about either the English enemy or the Spanish war plans, his poor health and tendency to sea-sickness, and his inability to contribute financially to the expedition. Philip II may never have seen this letter, for his secretaries Don Juan de Idiaquez and Don Cristobal de Moura replied to the duke that they dared not show it to the king.

Historians have speculated that Medina Sidonia himself did not believe in the success of the Armada, and that this motivated his attempt to reject the command as also a later letter he wrote to the king, advising an attempt to conclude peace or at least postpone the operation. What general opinion of the duke may have been is unrecorded, but it is known that skepticism regarding the Armada&#x27;s prospects existed among senior Spanish officers and informed foreign commentators.

The opinion of modern historians on Medina Sidonia&#x27;s efforts to prepare the Armada is generally favorable. He reorganized the fleet, rationalized the chaotic distribution of loads and guns, and increased the ammunition supplies from 30 to 50 rounds per gun. The permission of the king to add the Castilian galleons of the &quot;Indian Guard&quot; to the Armada nearly doubled its first-line fighting strength. Under the duke&#x27;s command the material state of the Armada and the manning of the ships was much improved. The distribution of cannons and ammunition was rationalized, and Medina Sidonia got permission from Philip to lodge some of his men ashore; prior to that, the king had insisted that the sailors be kept aboard their ships at all times, a policy which had a disastrous effect on the health and morale of the fleet. Medina Sidonia managed to establish good relationships with his subordinate commanders, and gathered additional supplies right up to the moment of sailing.

===Fleet command===
Medina Sidonia&#x27;s behavior as a fleet commander in the ensuing series of fights with the English has come under more criticism. Lacking military experience, he showed little initiative or self-confidence, instead cautiously obeying the instructions of the king, and relying on the opinion of his advisers and subordinate commanders. This tendency was reinforced by the senior adviser appointed to him by the king, Diego Flores de Valdes, an experienced sea officer but also a man renowned for his caution. Medina Sidonia also seriously underestimated the difficulty of coordinating his actions with the commander of the Spanish forces in the Netherlands, Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma, who was supposed to launch his invasion fleet to meet the Armada at sea. However, this problem was fundamental to the operational plan imposed on the two commanders by Philip II.

Allowing for the limitations inherent in a total lack of command experience, Medina Sidonia fought the battle courageously and intelligently. His health suffered badly as a result of the campaign, and after his return to Spain the king finally relieved him of his command and granted him permission to return home to convalesce. Later, he served the Spanish crown for another two decades in various functions. The duke&#x27;s reputation suffered, because several popular accounts, notably the one written by the monk Juan de Victoria, placed all blame for the defeat on him.

Informed commentators and modern historians have put most of the blame on Philip II himself for imposing an impractical plan on his commanders, and on Diego Flores de Valdes for badly advising the duke. Philip II himself did not single out his chosen commander to bear the responsibility for the defeat. He stated &quot;Action without cause is illegitimate of reason&quot; in response to public outcry on re-sending a fleet to Britain. The duke retained his posts of admiral of the ocean and captain-general of Andalusia, and continued to serve Philip II and later Philip III.

The popular image of the duke in later years was strongly influenced by propaganda surrounding the Armada, including an English account which claimed that the Duke of Medina Sidonia was a fool and a coward who hid below decks in a specially reinforced room. This story became a lasting part of popular descriptions of the battle, in which the Duke of Medinia Sidonia was frequently portrayed as an incompetent buffoon.

==Later years==
When an English fleet attacked Cádiz in 1596, Medina Sidonia&#x27;s allegedly slow response was blamed for giving the English enough time to sack the city.

In 1606 Medina Sidonia&#x27;s obstinacy caused the loss of a squadron which was destroyed near Gibraltar by the Dutch. This episode made the duke a satirical target of Miguel de Cervantes.

==In popular culture==
* In the Belgian Suske en Wiske comic book story &quot;De Stierentemmer&quot; (&quot;The Bull Tamer&quot;) (1952) the character Aunt Sidonia learns that she is related to the 16th century duke of Medina Sidonia, Alonso Pérez de Guzmán. In the Dutch educational comic strip series &quot;Van Nul tot Nu&quot; (1982), which tells the history of the Netherlands in comic book form, Alonso Pérez de Guzmán is caricatured as Tante Sidonia as a nod to &quot;Suske en Wiske&quot;.
* The children&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;The House with a Clock in Its Walls&quot; features an appearance by the Duke of Medina Sidonia, in command of the Armada, as a type of magical hologram. This element was not included in the 2018 film adaptation.
* The alternate history novel &quot;Ruled Britannia&quot; is set in a world where the Duke&#x27;s Armada defeated the English. While the Duke does not appear, his fictitious nephew Baltasar Guzmán, an army officer, is a prominent character.

<text>Shi Lang (1621–1696), Marquis Jinghai, also known as Secoe or Sego, was a Chinese admiral who served under the Ming and Qing dynasties in the 17th century. He was the commander-in-chief of the Qing fleets which destroyed the power of Zheng Chenggong&#x27;s descendants in the 1660s, and led the conquest of the Zheng family&#x27;s Kingdom of Tungning in Taiwan in 1683. Shi later governed part of Taiwan as a marquis.

==Early life and career==
Shi Lang was born to a distinguished lineage in Fujian, in 1621. He studied military strategy in his youth, and became particularly proficient in naval warfare. He was also famous for his strength, ferocity and martial skills in battle. Kangxi Emperor once described him as a fierce warrior who was also highly adept in military command skills, however, he was a blunt and rude person who lacked basic manners and courtesy. After fighting a number of minor operations locally with his father, he joined Zheng Zhilong&#x27;s naval fleet as captain of the left vanguard. Shi Lang served most of the early 1640s in the Zheng family&#x27;s fleet, where he apparently saw some conflict with Zheng Zhilong&#x27;s son Zheng Chenggong. When Shi defected to the Qing dynasty in 1646, Zheng Chenggong killed Shi&#x27;s father, brother and son.

==Campaign against the Zheng family==
The Qing rulers prized Shi Lang for his extensive naval experience and his network of contacts in the major trading ports of East Asia. He accompanied Prince Jidu (son of Jirgalang) on an expedition in Fujian in 1656, and attained the rank of Assistant Brigadier-General. In the campaign of 1663 against the Zheng family, he commanded Dutch ships and men to follow up the Qing victories. In 1668, he submitted a plan to drive the remnants of the Ming dynasty from Taiwan and the Pescadores (Penghu), but the proposal was not utilised. He was given a post in the Imperial Bodyguard and attached to the Chinese Bordered Yellow Banner.

==Conquest of Taiwan==
In 1681, following the Revolt of the Three Feudatories, the Kangxi Emperor sought a possible leader for an amphibious operation against Taiwan. Following the advice of Li Guangdi, he chose Shi Lang. Shi Lang insisted on having an independent command, not one shared with Yao Qisheng, the Governor-General of Fujian. On 8 July 1683, after extensive preparation, Shi Lang led a force of 300 warships and 20,000 soldiers out of Tongshan, Fujian. On July 16–17, he defeated the Zheng family&#x27;s leading naval commander, Liu Guoxuan, in a major engagement near the Pescadores. On 5 September, Shi Lang received Zheng Keshuang&#x27;s offer to surrender. On 3 October, he reached Taiwan and formally obtained the capitulation of Liu Guoxuan and Zheng Keshuang.

Following this successful campaign, Shi Lang returned to the Chinese mainland and worked hard to persuade the Kangxi Emperor to make Taiwan part of China&#x27;s recognized territory. At the time, there was opposition among many within the Qing government toward the annexation of Taiwan, arguing that its maintenance would become an economic burden on the empire. However, the Kangxi Emperor accepted Shi Lang&#x27;s views, and in 1684 Taiwan was divided into three counties and established as a prefecture of Fujian province.

Shi Lang was declared the &quot;General Who Maintains Peace on the Seas&quot; () and given the hereditary rank of marquis. At his own request, he was specially granted the privilege of wearing an honorary peacock feather. Shi Lang continued at his post in Fujian, seizing almost half of the developed land in southern Taiwan for his own profit. Shi annually extorted monetary resources from rich and poor local communities alike, and instituted policies that deliberately aimed to isolate Taiwan from the rest of the Qing Empire – coastal provinces were forbidden to interact with Taiwan, and even people from inland provinces were disallowed to bring their families with them, effectively preventing them from making any permanent foothold in Taiwan. Although he was later charged with arrogance, in 1688 the Kangxi Emperor received Shi Lang in audience in Beijing and allowed him to sit in the imperial presence, reiterating his confidence in him. Shi Lang returned to Fujian and remained in office there until his death in 1696.

==Legacy==

Shi Lang was given the posthumous name &quot;Xiangzhuang&quot; (), and the title of Junior Tutor to the Heir Apparent. In 1732, his name was entered for worship in the Temple of Eminent Statesmen. One of his sons achieved distinction as an admiral, whilst another was a state official. The Shi family was granted the special privilege of burial in their ancestral cemetery in Jinjiang, instead of in Banner lands as was the case with other Bannermen.

Though famous for his military achievements, Shi Lang remains a controversial figure in contemporary China. He is generally denounced as a traitorous figure who abandoned the Ming loyalist cause for the Qing. As a defector, his exploits have generally been downplayed by the governments of both Taiwan and China, and he is remembered in Taiwan as a conqueror and cruel governor.

==In popular culture==
Shi Lang appears as a minor character in the wuxia novel &quot;The Deer and the Cauldron&quot; by Louis Cha. In the novel, the Kangxi Emperor ordered Shi Lang to assist the protagonist Wei Xiaobao in destroying the Mystic Dragon Cult. The Battle of Penghu, in which Shi Lang led the Qing navy to victory over the forces of the Kingdom of Tungning, is also mentioned in the later chapters.

<doc id="828105" wikidata="Q1754074" url="?curid=828105" title="L.A. (Light Album)">
<text>L.A. (Light Album) is the 23rd studio album by the American rock band the Beach Boys, released on March 16, 1979, and their first issued through CBS Records. Recorded during a period of acrimony between the band members, it was a critical and commercial failure, peaking at number 100 in the U.S. and number 32 in the UK.

The album largely consists of solo recordings by the individual band members, including two from Dennis Wilson (&quot;Love Surrounds Me&quot; and &quot;Baby Blue&quot;) that were lifted from his unreleased second solo album, &quot;Bambu&quot;. Brian Wilson was not present for much of the &quot;L.A.&quot; sessions. The production was credited to returning Beach Boy Bruce Johnston, the band itself, and their manager James William Guercio.

&quot;L.A.&quot; produced three singles: an 11-minute disco rerecording of &quot;Here Comes the Night&quot; from their 1967 album &quot;Wild Honey&quot;, the Brian and Carl Wilson collaboration &quot;Good Timin&#x27;&quot;, and Al Jardine&#x27;s &quot;Lady Lynda&quot;. &quot;Here Comes the Night&quot; and &quot;Good Timin″&quot; charted at numbers 44 and 40, respectively, while &quot;Lady Lynda&quot; was a top 10 hit in several territories abroad, including the UK.

==Background==
In the late 1970s, the Beach Boys were in a state of professional and personal disarray, with the Wilson brothers struggling with drug abuse and, alongside Mike Love, each facing an imminent or ongoing divorce from their wives. In March 1977, the group signed an $8 million deal with CBS Records, with their first album expected for delivery before January 1, 1978. Dennis Wilson released his first solo album, &quot;Pacific Ocean Blue&quot;, in September 1977, after which the band recorded &quot;M.I.U. Album&quot; to finish off their contract with Reprise.

The Beach Boys missed their CBS album deadline and, from February to March 1978, embarked on a three-week tour of Australia and New Zealand. While the tour was a commercial success, tensions within the band were disastrous and nearly resulted in another breakup when the group discovered Dennis had purchased heroin for Brian Wilson with funds allegedly acquired from Carl Wilson. During an argument regarding this incident, Brian&#x27;s bodyguard Rocky Pamplin punched Carl in the face. Band manager and business advisor Stephen Love, who felt that Pamplin&#x27;s actions were justified, was subsequently fired.

After returning to Los Angeles, Brian ran away on a days-long drug binge and was later discovered lying under a tree at Balboa Park in San Diego without shoes, money, or a wallet. Biographer Steven Gaines writes that Brian was then admitted to a local hospital, and when discharged, immediately joined his bandmates at Criteria Studios in Miami, where they were recording their long-overdue first album for CBS. Peter Ames Carlin, another biographer, supports that sessions had already been underway in Miami, but Mike&#x27;s 2016 memoir, &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, gives a different timeline:

==Production==

From January 11 to August 22, 1978, members of the band held sessions at various studios in Los Angeles. In Dennis&#x27; case, he was focused on recording his second solo album, &quot;Bambu&quot;. From August 28 to September 1, the group recorded at Criteria Studios in Miami and subsequently compiled a tape of their work for CBS. Yetnikoff and CBS vice president Tony Martell then visited the studio and were previewed the songs. Carlin writes that the sessions and the meeting &quot;did not go well&quot;. Martell remembered, &quot;We sat there and listened to the tunes. ... At one point, it was a little volatile, because of what we heard. They told us it was one of their finest efforts.&quot; Brian&#x27;s other bodyguard, Stan Love, said that when Yetnikoff heard the tapes, &quot;he turned to the group and said, &#x27;I think I&#x27;ve been fucked.&#x27;&quot;
The Wilson brothers&#x27; cousin Steve Korthof recalled, &quot;Brian was real weird then, real quiet, not saying much. Real depressed. I think he just realized he wasn&#x27;t going to be able to pick up the slack. Brian eventually suggested that Bruce Johnston be brought back in to help produce the album.&quot; His bandmates agreed to the suggestion based on the strength of Johnston&#x27;s success writing the 1975 hit &quot;I Write the Songs&quot;. According to Gaines, &quot;When everyone else returned to Los Angeles to continue recording at Western Studios, Brian wanted to stay in Florida by himself. The group agreed that this was out of the question and forced him to return to L.A.&quot;

Sessions resumed at various other studios from September 18, 1978, to January 24, 1979. In between these sessions, Mike also recorded two unreleased solo albums, &quot;First Love&quot; and &quot;Country Love&quot;. Brian, who is barely present on &quot;L.A.&quot;, was institutionalized at Brotzman Memorial Hospital from November 1978 to early 1979 following an incident in which he attacked his doctor during a visit. In Carlin&#x27;s description, &quot;if Brian sang a note anywhere on the album, his voice is so far down in the mix as to be completely unidentifiable.&quot;

==Songs and outtakes==

Love described &quot;L.A.&quot; as &quot;mainly a collection of solo efforts&quot;. These included songs from Mike Love’s unreleased album “First Love” and Dennis Wilson’s in progress album “Bambu”. The album&#x27;s centerpiece was &quot;Here Comes the Night&quot;, an 11-minute disco reworking of an original R&amp;B song that the band had released on their 1967 album &quot;Wild Honey&quot;. Dennis was opposed to the recording, and Brian did not participate. Another older song, &quot;Good Timin&#x27;&quot;, had dated from the band&#x27;s aborted 1974 sessions at Caribou Ranch. Brian&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Shortenin&#x27; Bread&quot; featured Dennis on lead, and was a different recording from the version on the unreleased Adult/Child album.

Among the newer songs, Carl contributed three – &quot;Angel Come Home&quot;, &quot;Full Sail&quot;, and &quot;Goin&#x27; South&quot; – that he wrote with songwriter Geoffrey Cushing-Murray, whom he had met through touring member Billy Hinsche. Dennis&#x27; two songs – &quot;Baby Blue&quot; and &quot;Love Surrounds Me&quot; – were lifted from his in-progress &quot;Bambu&quot; album. Biographer Jon Stebbins states that the songs were included at the insistence of Dennis&#x27; bandmates, and quotes music journalist Domenic Priore, who surmised, &quot;They obviously didn&#x27;t have enough good material for their debut album on their new label, so they nicked some of the better [songs from &quot;Bambu&quot;]&quot;.

Love&#x27;s &quot;Sumahama&quot; is lyrically inspired by his fiancé at the time, a woman named Sumako, and is &quot;about a young girl who wants to go with her mother to a place called &#x27;Sumahama&#x27; in search of her father.&quot; Sumahama was re-recorded from the version recorded on his unreleased album First Love. Although some of the lyrics are in Japanese, Sumako was of Korean descent. Al Jardine&#x27;s &quot;Lady Lynda&quot; is a tribute to his then-wife that is based musically on Bach&#x27;s &quot;Jesu, Joy of Man&#x27;s Desiring&quot;.

Among the outtakes, a re-recorded version of &quot;Santa Ana Winds&quot; appeared on their next album, &quot;Keepin&#x27; the Summer Alive&quot; (1980), &quot;Brian&#x27;s Back&quot; (another First Love outtake) was released on the 1998 compilation &quot;Endless Harmony&quot;, and &quot;California Feelin&#x27;&quot; was released on the 2013 compilation &quot;Made in California&quot;. &quot;Rock Plymouth Rock/Roll&quot; , a song from the band&#x27;s unfinished &quot;Smile&quot; album, was also considered for inclusion as the opening track of &quot;L.A.&quot;. Still-unreleased tracks from the &quot;L.A.&quot; sessions include &quot;Looking Down the Coast/Monterey&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Begging You Please&quot;, &quot;Basketball Rock&quot;, &quot;Bowling&quot;, &quot;There’s a Feeling Through the Air&quot;, and renditions of &quot;Calendar Girl&quot; and &quot;Drip Drop&quot;.

==Packaging==
In the liner notes, it is explained that the &quot;L.A. (Light Album)&quot; title refers to the &quot;awareness of, and the presence of, God here in this world as an ongoing loving reality&quot;. The initials also allude to Los Angeles, the band&#x27;s native home. Carlin writes that the title &quot;evoked both Los Angeles and the city&#x27;s long-standing position as a capital of vaguely New Age religions&quot;.

The sleeve design features an assortment of illustrations drawn individually by Gary Meyer (&quot;The Beach Boys&quot;), Jim Heimann (&quot;Light Album&quot;), Drew Struzan (&quot;Sumahama&quot;), Dave McMacken (&quot;Lady Lynda&quot;), Steve Carver (&quot;Full Sail&quot;), Nick Taggart (&quot;Here Comes the Night&quot;), Howard Carriker (&quot;Angel Come Home&quot;), Peter Green (&quot;Good Timin″&quot;), Neon Park (&quot;Baby Blue&quot;), Blue Beach (&quot;Shortenin&#x27; Bread&quot;), Mick Haggerty (&quot;Here Comes the Night&quot;), and William Stout (&quot;Goin&#x27; South&quot;). Troy Lane is credited as &quot;cover artist&quot;, while Gary Meyer is credited with art direction and design.

==Release==
Lead single &quot;Here Comes the Night&quot; (backed with &quot;Baby Blue&quot;) was issued on February 19, 1979, and peaked at number 44. &quot;L.A. (Light Album)&quot; followed on March 16 and reached number 100 in the U.S. The next month, &quot;Good Timin&#x27;&quot; (backed with &quot;Love Surrounds Me&quot;) was issued as a second single and reached number 40, becoming the band&#x27;s first top 40 hit since &quot;It&#x27;s OK&quot; in 1976. Stebbins summarized this juncture in the band&#x27;s career,

In April, the group appeared on &quot;The Midnight Special&quot;, where they performed their past hits alongside &quot;Baby Blue&quot;, &quot;Here Comes the Night&quot;, and &quot;Angel Come Home&quot;. In August, &quot;Lady Lynda&quot; (backed with &quot;Full Sail&quot;) was issued as the album&#x27;s third and final single. It failed to chart in the U.S., but was a top 10 hit in several territories abroad, including the UK.

==Critical reception==
The album received mostly unfavorable reviews from music critics. In his review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Dave Marsh wrote, &quot;The Beach Boys have not made great rock music since &quot;Wild Honey&quot; [and have not] made competent pop music since &quot;Holland&quot;&quot;, concluding that the album &quot;is worse than awful. It is irrelevant.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; concluded that &quot;the songs here are better than some recent albums by the group; they&#x27;re gentle, tuneful and innocently charming... But they&#x27;re pretty trivial, too.&quot;

AllMusic reviewer John Bush felt, &quot;The Beach Boys ended the decade by releasing the worst album of their career&quot;, describing it as &quot;yet another oddball attempt to push the Beach Boys into the contemporary mainstream despite their many songwriting and production flaws.&quot; &quot;Blender&quot;″s Douglas Wolk decreed that &quot;L.A.&quot; was &quot;practically a self-parody&quot; with &quot;Here Comes the Night&quot; being the only enjoyable track. Jeff Tamarkin, who penned liner notes for the 2000 CD reissue, said of the album: &quot;There is undeniable brilliance here if one dares to look.&quot; Stebbins praised the Wilson brothers&#x27; contributions and derided the songs by Love and Jardine, calling the album &quot;an uneven and disappointing affair. If you liked one part of it, then you were sure to hate others.&quot; Carlin opined that &quot;L.A.&quot; was &quot;a big improvement over &quot;M.I.U..&quot; ... the album&#x27;s strength came largely from its diversity of voices&quot;. Critic Richard Williams referred to &quot;Angel Come Home&quot; as &quot;the most beautifully textured and exquisitely pain-racked white soul music ever made&quot;.

<text>Ometepe is an island formed by two volcanoes rising out of Lake Nicaragua, located in the Rivas Department of the Republic of Nicaragua. Its name derives from the Nahuatl words &quot;ome&quot; (two) and &quot;tepetl&quot; (mountain), meaning &quot;two mountains&quot;. It is the largest island in Lake Nicaragua.

The two volcanoes (Concepción and Maderas) are joined by a low isthmus to form one island. Ometepe has an area of . It is long and wide. The island has an economy based on livestock, agriculture, and tourism. Plantains are the major crop.

==Inhabitants==
The island first became inhabited during the Dinarte phase (c. 2000 BC – 500 BC), although evidence is questionable. The first known inhabitants were speakers of Macro-Chibchan languages. Traces of this past can still be found in petroglyphs and stone idols on the northern slopes of the Maderas volcano. The oldest date from 300 BC. Several centuries later, Chorotega and Nicarao people continued to add to the petroglyphs and created statues on Ometepe carved from basalt rock.

After the Spaniards conquered the Central American region in the 16th century, pirates began prowling Lake Nicaragua. They came in from the Caribbean Sea via the San Juan River. The inhabitants of Ometepe were hard hit. The pirates kidnapped women, stole the inhabitants&#x27; animals, possessions, and harvest, and erected settlements on the shore, making it their refuge. This made the local population move to higher grounds on the volcanoes in search of shelter. The island was finally settled by the Spanish conquistadors at the end of the 16th century.

The most important villages on the island are Altagracia (pop. 4081), on the northeastern side, and Moyogalpa (pop. 2905), with its harbor on the northwestern side of the island. These two villages are the centers of the two municipalities and the island is divided between the two. Many traditions have been kept alive, thus inhabitants of Ometepe celebrate more religious and folk festivals than anywhere else in Nicaragua.

Today, Ometepe is developing tourism and ecotourism, with the archaeological past and the bounty of its nature sanctuary, the exotic vegetation, animal and bird life as drawcards. Ometepe Airport opened in 2014.

==Volcanoes==
Concepción is on the northwest half of the island. It has a base of beneath its symmetrical cone, and it is an active volcano. Because of its symmetry, it has been considered extremely beautiful. The volcano is believed to have risen in the early Holocene epoch and, through continual eruptions, now reaches an altitude of making Ometepe the world&#x27;s highest lake island.

After a long period of dormancy, an eruption began at Concepción on December 8, 1880. This eruption was extensive, and the volcano remained active for a year. More eruptions followed in 1883, 1889, 1902, 1907, and 1924. In 2005, an earthquake measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale occurred as a result of increasing pressure within the volcano. Cracks appeared on roads throughout the island and an advisory to leave the island was issued. This was the first minor eruption since 1999. The most recent eruption was in 2010 and although it was extremely violent, few of the inhabitants heeded the order from the government in Managua to evacuate the island and little damage was done.
The southeast half of the island consists of Maderas, which has a crater lake and supports a diverse rainforest environment. Maderas is also believed to have risen in the Holocene epoch and rises above sea level. It is considered extinct or possibly dormant. The large lagoon in its crater was discovered on April 15, 1930, by farmer Casimiro Murillo. The sides of the volcano are mainly covered with coffee and tobacco plantations while the remainder is rain forest. Much of this part of the island is now a nature reserve.

The volcanic ash has made the soil of this island extremely fertile, allowing continuous planting. The volcanoes are visible from everywhere on the island, and life on Ometepe revolves closely around them. They also play an important part in the myths and legends of the island, which once served as an indigenous burial ground.

===IUGS geological heritage site===
In respect of it being &#x27;a type example of volcano spreading and volcano-tectonic interactions in the volcanic arc sedimentary basin of Lake Nicaragua&#x27;, the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) included &#x27;La Isla de Ometepe: Quaternary volcanoes in the Lake Nicaragua sedimentary basin&#x27; in its assemblage of 100 &#x27;geological heritage sites&#x27; around the world in a listing published in October 2022. The organisation defines an IUGS Geological Heritage Site as &#x27;a key place with geological elements and/or processes of international scientific relevance, used as a reference, and/or with a substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences through history.&#x27;

==Archaeology==

Ometepe Island is generally included within the archaeological area of &quot;Greater Nicoya&quot;, which also encompasses the Rivas area on the lake shore and descends into Costa Rican Nicoya Peninsula. Due to deposits of volcanic ash over millennia, the soil is very fertile, allowing constant planting without fallowing. This rich environment has allowed the island to be continuously inhabited since the Dinarte phase (c. 2000 BC – 500 BC). There is a time period classified as the “Ometepe period” (AD 1350 – 1550) or &quot;Greater Nicoyan Period&quot;, which corresponds to the Mesoamerican Postclassic period. This period is associated with the migration of the Nicarao (Nahua speakers) into the area of Greater Nicoya.

The archaeologists who have done fieldwork on the island over the years are:
*1880s: J.F. Bransford;
*1959-1961: excavations by Dr. Gordon Willey and Albert Norweb;
*1962: Wolfgang Haberland and Peter Schmidt;
*1995–1999: Suzanne M. Baker - Ometepe Petroglyph Project.

===Ceramics===
Dr. Gordon Willey and Albert Norweb excavated the Cruz site (named after the Cruz Hacienda), on the North East part of the island. This site is important because it produced nearly 30,000 sherds, most of which belonged to the Late Polychrome Period. The upper levels of the site produced the diagnostic ceramic types which came to define the Late Polychrome Period for the whole of the Rivas area. Pieces were also found from the San Jorge phase of the Zoned Bichrome Period.

The Ceramic Type &quot;Ometepe Red Slipped-Incised&quot; is found on Ometepe Island. It is a Late Polychrome Period ceramic type, and it is usually found in the form of jar sherds. This type of ceramic is identifiable because it is scraped on both the inside and out, and smoothing and polishing is done on the exterior body and rim. The slip, over the rim and outside, is a dull red to brown, while only the inside of the neck is slipped. Lines are cut into the lip of the jar, and triangles are the most common motif, either interlocking or meeting tip to tip. Other ceramic types found on the island include: Granada Polychrome from the Middle Polychrome Period, Castillo Late Polychrome, and Luna Ware Polychrome.

===Petroglyphs===


The Ometepe Petroglyph Project was a volunteer field survey of the Maderas half of Ometepe from 1995 to 1999. This project intensively surveyed 15 km of the Maderas half of the island over five field seasons. The project mapped 73 archaeological sites within this area, including almost 1700 petroglyph panels on 1400 boulders.

Of the 73 sites surveyed by the Ometepe Petroglyph Project, petroglyphs were recorded at all but one. Many of the petroglyphs on Ometepe contain spirals, and “meander” across the rock face. Stylized turtles are a common motif for the area.

The petroglyphs of Ometepe include some forms which are less common. Figures in many of the depictions are described as having “bowling ball faces” on human figures. As noted above, spirals are common, and are apparently used in several ways. Two attached spirals appear to represent the island, with its two volcanoes. Spirals also are used to depict the head of anthropomorphic figures. Some figures resemble Mesoamerican depictions of Nagual, suggesting the shared practice of Tonal spirituality.

Some of the unusual formations seen within the petroglyphs on Ometepe include seats or steps carved into boulders, ovals, and big grooves. The purpose behind these forms has not yet been explained.

Between the 1995 and 1996 field seasons, ten sites were recorded. The greatest concentration of petroglyphs was noted at N-RIO-3, probably recorded by Haberland as Om-38. Located along the slopes and at the top and of a ridge, the site contains 82 boulders with petroglyphs, six mortars, two metates and a scatter of ceramics and chert lithics. Of the 149 petroglyphs recorded during 1996, most were located on land owned by the cooperative at the hacienda.
When the program was expanded in 1997, to include volunteers, 20 volunteers participated in recording fifteen additional sites. The most impressive site, N-RIO-19, was greater than 180,000 square meters in area. Ninety-two petroglyphs, over 30 house mounds, stone statuary fragments, and pottery from at least three different periods of occupation were recorded at the site, and the material was being studied in Managua.

The Ometepe Petroglyph project is an interesting example of modern technology assisting in the recording of archaeological sites. As the prehistoric art sites were being surveyed and recorded, pictures were taken of each site in both color and black and white. A video was even made at one site. Photos were then uploaded into a computer, and the Photoshop program was then used to increase the contrast of the photos, increasing the visibility of the petroglyphs pictured. This allowed for a more accurate record of sites that by necessity were photographed in less than ideal conditions and lighting. In addition to the remote area and poor lighting, on Ometepe Island, the depth of the engraved lines on petroglyphs thus far recorded varies from “immeasurably shallow” to around three centimeters (Ometepe Petroglyph Project Website, 2006).

==Wildlife==
Ometepe harbors large populations of the white-faced capuchin monkey, also called white-headed capuchin, (&quot;Cebus capucinus&quot;) and populations of the mantled howler monkey (&quot;Alouatta palliata&quot;). Efforts are being made to study and protect these animals. The Ometepe Biological Field School is situated on the Maderas side of the island. Here, students and scientists from all over the world come to study the unique flora and fauna of the area.
The lake surrounding Ometepe harbors many species of aquatic animals, notably the Nicaragua shark which until recently was thought to be a unique species of freshwater shark but has since been shown to be continuous with ocean populations. Small populations of spider monkeys (&quot;Ateles s.&quot;) inhabit very small islands within Lake Nicaragua. These populations exist solely due to humans and many of the local fishermen routinely stop by to feed these troops. The local form of the rice rat &quot;Oryzomys couesi&quot; is distinctive and may represent a separate subspecies.

==Transportation==
Ometepe La Paloma Airport (OMT) serves the island with service from La Costeña. The airlines offers flights to Managua, San Carlos, and San Juan de Nicaragua (Greytown). Flights to Managua operated twice a week, every Thursday and Sunday. The flights were discontinued due to low demand. There are three ferry ports on the island and there are regular ferries and lanchas to and from San Carlos and Granada twice a week (seasonally and at night) as well as several times a day to and from San Jorge, Rivas. The roads on the island have recently been paved with concrete pavers for all the major roads on the island. the secondary roads outside the cities are all dirt or gravel and often heavily washed out and not passable without 4WD or a motorcycle.
== Tourism ==
In 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the island of Ometepe had 141,178 tourist arrivals. The majority arrive between mid-November and mid-May. The majority of the visitors arrive via ferry from San Jorge to Moyogalpa.

<doc id="828120" wikidata="Q242598" url="?curid=828120" title="Blanche of Namur">
<text>Blanche of Namur (Swedish and Norwegian: &quot;Blanka&quot;; 1320–1363) was Queen of Norway and Sweden as the wife of King Magnus Eriksson.

==Background==
Blanche was the eldest daughter of John I, Marquis of Namur and Marie of Artois. On her father&#x27;s side, she was a member of the powerful House of Dampierre, being a grandchild of Count Guy of Flanders. On her mother&#x27;s side Blanche was related to the French royal house, as her mother was a daughter of Philip of Artois, a patrilineal great-grandson of Louis VIII of France, and thus a member of a junior line of the House of Capet.

==Marriage==
It is unknown why a marriage was arranged between the king of Sweden and Norway and a member of the House of Namur. In June 1334 king Magnus travelled from Norway to Namur to propose. They were engaged in Namur and Magnus returned to Sweden in the fall of 1334. Blanche left Namur in the fall of 1335 and the wedding took place in October or early November 1335, possibly at Bohus Castle. As a wedding gift Blanche received the province of Tunsberg in Norway and Lödöse in Sweden as fiefs; Tunsberg was exchanged in 1353 to Bohus, Marstrand, Elfsyssel, Rånrike and Borgarsyssel. Blanche&#x27;s coronation took place in July 1336, possibly 22 July, in the Great Church in Stockholm. She was accompanied to Sweden by an entourage which included her brothers Robert and Louis, who came to be in service of her spouse: it is known that Louis remained in the king&#x27;s service as late as 1354.

==Queenship==
After her coronation, Queen Blanche was given her own seal with the inscription: &quot;Blanche, by the Grace of God Queen of Sweden, Norway and Scania&quot;, in which she is depicted with a crown and holding a scepter: unusually for a married woman of that period, she did not cover her hair with a veil.

The queen was described as wise and as an extraordinary beauty. At this point, Sweden did not have an official capital, and Queen Blanche accompanied the King in their travels between the royal residences. In 1345, her brothers Louis and Robert were made vassals of her husband.

Blanche and Magnus had two sons, Eric and Haakon, plus at least three daughters who died as children. In 1343, it was agreed that the two kingdoms of Sweden and Norway should again be divided, and that their eldest son Eric should inherit Sweden and their second son Haakon Norway. The same year, Haakon was invested as King of Norway at the age of three. At this occasion, the members of the Norwegian council guaranteed the right of Magnus to govern Norway during the minority of Haakon and to resist all attempts from Haakon’s elder brother to take over Norway: they swore their promise not only to King Magnus, but also to Queen Blanche. On 18 November 1343, the archbishops and bishops of Sweden swore an oath to assist Blanche in the event Magnus should die when Eric was still minor. 

The future saint Bridget of Sweden served as &quot;magistra&quot; or mistress of the robes to the queen at an unknown period, and regularly socialized with the royal couple before she left Sweden for Rome in 1349, and Bridget left descriptions of them and their court. In the will of the royal couple from 1 May 1346, they made large donations to Bridget&#x27;s planned Vadstena Abbey and asked to be buried there. Bridget, however, opposed their burial in her convent, and described the royal couple in a negative fashion. She accused Queen Blanche of having been a negative influence on state affairs by discrediting capable advisers before the king; &quot;She is a snake with the tongue of a harlot, the bile of dragons in her heart and the most bitter poison in her flesh. Therefore all her eggs became poisonous. Lucky are those who never experience their burden.&quot; Bridget expressed great dislike over the fact that the king and queen decided to live in a marriage without intercourse after the queen&#x27;s seventh pregnancy; she claims that this was the reason for the king&#x27;s rumored homosexuality, that Queen Blanche had been responsible when King Magnus made his controversial favorite Bengt Algotsson duke of Finland, and that Algotsson was the lover of them both.

In the 1350s, a crisis occurred because of the Black Death in Sweden and Norway and the failed politics in the Baltic, followed by the division of the kingdom of Sweden and Norway when their second son Haakon VI of Norway was declared of legal majority and free from his father&#x27;s regency, resulting in the end of the united kingdoms of Sweden and Norway. In 1356, the opposition supported their eldest son Eric in a rebellion against his parents, resulting in a mediation where king Magnus had to make Eric his co-ruler and divide Sweden between them. During this conflict, Queen Blanche seems to have supported her husband against their son. When Eric and his wife Beatrix died in 1359, Blanche was accused of having poisoned them, accusations that are however regarded as but propaganda against her. It is now believed that they died from the plague.

From 1359, she seems to have resided in Tønsberg Castle in Norway. Tønsberg was a part of her dower lands, and she ruled the area as her dower. It appears that her finances were somewhat strained during these years.

On 9 April 1363, she and Magnus attended the wedding of their son Haakon with Margaret, daughter of Valdemar IV of Denmark, in Copenhagen. Shortly after the wedding, Blanche fell ill and died. The cause of death and the place where she is buried are unknown.

==Issue==
# Eric XII of Sweden
# Haakon VI of Norway
# At least three daughters who died in infancy or early childhood, some buried at Ås Abbey.

== Legacy ==

Queen Blanche is one of the most well-known of the Swedish/Norwegian medieval queens. Apparently, she was very politically and socially active and noticeable, not only as a queen, as many stories and songs were written about her.

In Sweden, Queen Blanche is also remembered for the song: &quot;Rida rida ranka, hästen heter Blanka&quot; (&quot;Ride, ride on my knee, the horse is called Blanka&quot;), which has influenced the famous historical painting by Albert Edelfelt of her and her son Haakon.

Its theme was &quot;Progress and Harmony for Mankind.&quot; In Japanese, Expo &#x27;70 is often referred to as . It was the first world&#x27;s fair held in Japan and in Asia.

The Expo was designed by Japanese architect Kenzō Tange, assisted by 12 other Japanese architects. Bridging the site along a north–south axis was the Symbol Zone. Planned on three levels, it was primarily a social space with a unifying space frame roof.

The Expo attracted international attention for the extent to which unusual artworks and designs by Japanese avant-garde artists were incorporated into the overall plan and individual national and corporate pavilions. The most famous of these artworks is artist Tarō Okamoto&#x27;s iconic Tower of the Sun, which still remains on the site today.

==Background==

Osaka was chosen as the site for the 1970 World Exposition by the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) in 1965. 330 hectares in the Senri Hills outside Osaka had been earmarked for the site and a Theme Committee under the chairmanship of Seiji Kaya was formed. Kenzo Tange and Uzo Nishiyama were appointed to produce the master plan for the Expo. The main theme would be &quot;Progress and Harmony for Mankind&quot;. Tange invited 12 other architects to elucidate designs for elements within the master plan. These architects included: Arata Isozaki for the &quot;Festival Plaza&quot; mechanical, electrical and electronic installations; and Kiyonori Kikutake for the Landmark Tower.

==Master plan==
Two main principles informed the master plan. The first was the idea that the wisdom of all the peoples of the world would come together in this place and stimulate ideas; the second was that it would be less of an &quot;exposition&quot; and more of a &quot;festival&quot;. The designers thought that unlike previous expositions they wished to produce a central, unifying, Festival Plaza where people could meet and socialise. They called this the &quot;Symbol Zone&quot; and covered it and the themed pavilions with a giant space frame roof.

The designers liked the idea that like the 1851 Great Exhibition in London, the roof of the Symbol Zone could be a unifying entity for the expo. They did not want the constraint imposed by the London Exhibition of having everything contained under one roof, so the space frame contained only the Festival Plaza and themed pavilions. Tange compared the concept to a tree. The idea was that although the national pavilions were like individual flowers they needed to be connected to the whole via branches and a trunk. Thus the Symbol Zone became the trunk and the moving pedestrian walkways and sub-plazas became the branches. These elements were reinforced with colour, with the trunk and branches in plain white and the pavilions in their own colours that were determined by the national architects.

The Symbol Zone ran north–south across the site, spanning an arterial road running east–west. The Festival Plaza was to the north of road and had the main gate on its southern end. To the north of the main gate and central to the Festival Plaza was the Tower of the Sun from which visitors could join pedestrian walkways that travelled out towards the north, south, east and west gates.

The Theme Space under the space frame was divided into three levels, each designed by the artist Tarō Okamoto, The underground level represented the past and was a symbol of the source of humanity. The surface level represented the present, symbolising the dynamism of human interaction. The space frame represented the future and a world where humanity and technology would be joined. Tange envisioned that the exhibition for the future would be like an aerial city and he asked Fumihiko Maki, Noboru Kawazoe, Koji Kamiya and Noriaki Kurokawa to design it. The Theme Space was also punctuated by three towers: the Tower of the Sun, the Tower of Maternity and the Tower of Youth.

To the north of the Theme Space was the Festival Plaza. This was a flexible space that contained a flat area and stepped terrace. The plaza could be rearranged to provide for different requirements for seating capacity, from 1500 to 10000. The flexibility extended to the lighting and audio visual equipment allowing for a range of musical performances and electronic presentations. Festival Plaza was covered by the world&#x27;s first large-scale, transparent membrane roof. It was designed by Tange and structural engineer Yoshikatsu Tsuboi + Kawaguchi &amp; Engineers. Measuring 75.6 m in width and 108 m in length, it was 30 m high and supported by only six lattice columns.

Seventy-seven countries participated in the event, and within six months the number of visitors reached 64,218,770, making Expo &#x27;70 one of the largest and best attended expositions in history. It held the record for most visitors at an Expo until it was surpassed by the Shanghai World Expo in 2010. It generated a profit of 19 billion Yen.

==Major pavilions==

* The Canadian pavilion, designed by architect Arthur Erickson, featured two National Film Board of Canada productions: &quot;The Land&quot;, a look at Canada from coast to coast, filmed for the most part from a low-flying aircraft, as well as the animated short &quot;The City&quot;, directed by Kaj Pindal. Montreal artist and architect Melvin Charney had submitted a radically different design for the Canadian pavilion, fashioned from construction cranes and scaffolding, which was rejected.
* The West German pavilion, designed by Fritz Bornemann, featured the world&#x27;s first spherical concert hall, based on artistic concepts by Karlheinz Stockhausen. The pavilion theme was &quot;gardens of music&quot;, in keeping with which Bornemann &quot;planted&quot; the exhibition halls beneath a broad lawn, with the connected auditorium &quot;sprouting&quot; above ground. Inside, the audience was surrounded by 50 loudspeaker groups in seven rings at different &quot;latitudes&quot; around the interior walls of the sphere. Sound was sent around the space in three dimensions using either a spherical controller designed by Fritz Winckel of the Electronic Music Studio at Technische Universität Berlin, or a ten-channel &quot;rotation mill&quot; constructed to Stockhausen&#x27;s design. Works by Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, Bernd Alois Zimmermann, and Boris Blacher were played from multi-track tape. As the main feature, however, Stockhausen was invited to present five-and-a-half-hour live programs of his music every day over a period of 183 days to a total audience of about a million listeners. In the course of the exhibition, 19 performers in Stockhausen&#x27;s ensemble gave concerts for over a million visitors. &quot;Many visitors felt the spherical auditorium to be an oasis of calm amidst the general hubbub, and after a while it became one of the main attractions of Expo 1970&quot;.
* The USSR pavilion was the tallest in the fairgrounds, a sweeping red and white design by Soviet architect Mikhail V. Posokhin.
* The U.S. pavilion was an air-supported dome, a joint design by architects Davis Brody and structural engineer David H. Geiger
* The Netherlands pavilion was the work of Carel Weeber and Jaap Bakema.
* The Hong Kong pavilion, topped by sails that were raised and lowered twice daily, was designed by Alan Fitch, W. Szebo &amp; Partners.
* The Philippine Pavilion was designed by renowned Filipino Architect Leandro Locsin and was very well received and was judged as one of the ten most popular pavilions at the exhibition with its dramatic roof sweeping up from the ground using fine Philippine hardwoods and other native materials.

== Other attractions ==

A popular highlight of the fair was a large Moon rock on display in the United States&#x27; pavilion. It had been brought back from the Moon by Apollo 12 astronauts in 1969.

Expo &#x27;70 also saw the premiere of the first-ever IMAX film: the Canadian-produced &quot;Tiger Child&quot; for the Fuji Group pavilion.

The Expo also featured demonstrations of conveyor belt sushi, early mobile phones, local area networking and maglev train technology.

==After the fair==
===Today===
The site of Expo &#x27;70 is now Expo Commemoration Park. Almost all pavilions have been demolished, but a few memorials remain, including part of the roof for Festival Plaza designed by Tange. The most famous of the still-intact pieces is the Tower of the Sun. The former international art museum pavilion designed by Kiyoshi Kawasaki was used as the building for the National Museum of Art, Osaka until March 2004 (the museum moved to downtown Osaka in November 2004).

Additionally, there is a time capsule that is to be left for 5,000 years and opened in the year 6970. The capsule was donated by The Mainichi Newspapers Co. and the Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. The concept creating time capsules at world&#x27;s fairs started with the two Westinghouse Time Capsules, which are to be opened in 6939.

Part of the Expo Commemoration Park is now ExpoCity, a shopping mall that features the Redhorse Osaka Wheel.

Osaka successfully bid for Expo 2025 alongside Yekaterinburg, Russia and Baku, Azerbaijan. However, the world&#x27;s fair will not reuse the park space, and will instead be hosted on Yumeshima island in Konohana, on the waterfront of Osaka Bay.

===50th anniversary===
To celebrate the 50th anniversary, &quot;Expo ’70 50th Anniversary Special Exhibition&quot; was held in Tennozu area of Tokyo from February 15 to 24, 2020.

Osaka Monorail operated a wrapping train that reproduced the monorail design that operated at the Expo to commemorate the anniversary.

==In popular culture==

Expo &#x27;70 appears in Shōwa nostalgia fiction, where it is used as a symbol of the financial prosperity of Shōwa era Japan. For example, Expo &#x27;70 plays a central role in the plot of the Naoki Urasawa&#x27;s manga &quot;20th Century Boys&quot;; and various Expo &#x27;70 pastiches are featured in &quot;Crayon Shin-chan: Fierceness That Invites Storm! The Adult Empire Strikes Back&quot;.

*Expo &#x27;70 is the setting for the Daiei Motion Picture Company production of Noriaki Yuasa&#x27;s &quot;Gamera vs. Jiger&quot; (1970), which was extensively filmed on location at the Expo grounds. The final battle between the monsters takes place at the Expo site. The film was marketed overseas as &quot;Monsters Invade Expo &#x27;70&quot;.
*&quot;Kamen Rider&quot; episode 7 was filmed on the fairgrounds of Expo &#x27;70.
*Director Douglas Trumbull said that the design of the space freighter &quot;Valley Forge&quot; in the 1971 science fiction drama &quot;Silent Running&quot; was inspired by the Landmark Tower.
*Expo &#x27;70 is the main setting for the Canadian director Robert Lepage&#x27;s 1998 film entitled &quot;Nô&quot;, based on his play &quot;The Seven Branches of the River Ota&quot;.
*Expo &#x27;70 is the climax setting for the Tamil film &quot;Ulagam Sutrum Valiban&quot; directed by M. G. Ramachandran.
*Expo &#x27;70 is an experimental psychedelic drone musical act from Kansas City, Missouri led by Justin Wright (2003–present).
*Expo &#x27;70 is referenced in Yasuo Ohtagaki&#x27;s manga &quot;Moonlight Mile&quot;, as the protagonist Gorou comes from Suita.
*Expo &#x27;70 is referenced in the 2012 novel &quot;Miracles of the Namiya General Store&quot; by Keigo Higashino.

<doc id="828131" wikidata="Q1414271" url="?curid=828131" title="Weak ordering">
<text>In mathematics, especially order theory, a weak ordering is a mathematical formalization of the intuitive notion of a ranking of a set, some of whose members may be tied with each other. Weak orders are a generalization of totally ordered sets (rankings without ties) and are in turn generalized by (strictly) partially ordered sets and preorders. 

There are several common ways of formalizing weak orderings, that are different from each other but cryptomorphic (interconvertable with no loss of information): they may be axiomatized as strict weak orderings (strictly partially ordered sets in which incomparability is a transitive relation), as total preorders (transitive binary relations in which at least one of the two possible relations exists between every pair of elements), or as ordered partitions (partitions of the elements into disjoint subsets, together with a total order on the subsets). In many cases another representation called a preferential arrangement based on a utility function is also possible.

Weak orderings are counted by the ordered Bell numbers. They are used in computer science as part of partition refinement algorithms, and in the C++ Standard Library.

==Examples==

In horse racing, the use of photo finishes has eliminated some, but not all, ties or (as they are called in this context) dead heats, so the outcome of a horse race may be modeled by a weak ordering. In an example from the Maryland Hunt Cup steeplechase in 2007, The Bruce was the clear winner, but two horses Bug River and Lear Charm tied for second place, with the remaining horses farther back; three horses did not finish. In the weak ordering describing this outcome, The Bruce would be first, Bug River and Lear Charm would be ranked after The Bruce but before all the other horses that finished, and the three horses that did not finish would be placed last in the order but tied with each other.

The points of the Euclidean plane may be ordered by their distance from the origin, giving another example of a weak ordering with infinitely many elements, infinitely many subsets of tied elements (the sets of points that belong to a common circle centered at the origin), and infinitely many points within these subsets. Although this ordering has a smallest element (the origin itself), it does not have any second-smallest elements, nor any largest element.

Opinion polling in political elections provides an example of a type of ordering that resembles weak orderings, but is better modeled mathematically in other ways. In the results of a poll, one candidate may be clearly ahead of another, or the two candidates may be statistically tied, meaning not that their poll results are equal but rather that they are within the margin of error of each other. However, if candidate formula_1 is statistically tied with formula_2 and formula_3 is statistically tied with formula_4 it might still be possible for formula_1 to be clearly better than formula_4 so being tied is not in this case a transitive relation. Because of this possibility, rankings of this type are better modeled as semiorders than as weak orderings.

==Axiomatizations==

Suppose throughout that formula_7 is a homogeneous binary relation on a set formula_8 (that is, formula_7 is a subset of formula_10) and as usual, write formula_11 and say that or if and only if formula_12 

===Strict weak orderings===

Preliminaries on incomparability and transitivity of incomparability

Two elements formula_1 and formula_3 of formula_8 are said to be with respect to formula_7 if neither formula_11 nor formula_18 is true. 
A strict partial order formula_7 is a strict weak ordering if and only if incomparability with respect to formula_7 is an equivalence relation. 
Incomparability with respect to formula_7 is always a homogeneous symmetric relation on formula_22 
It is reflexive if and only if formula_7 is irreflexive (meaning that formula_24 is always false), which will be assumed so that transitivity is the only property this &quot;incomparability relation&quot; needs in order to be an equivalence relation. 

Define also an induced homogeneous relation formula_25 on formula_8 by declaring that 
formula_27 
where importantly, this definition is necessarily the same as: formula_28 if and only if formula_29 
Two elements formula_30 are incomparable with respect to formula_7 if and only if formula_32 are with respect to formula_25 (or less verbosely, ), which by definition means that both formula_34 are true. 
The relation &quot;are incomparable with respect to formula_35&quot; is thus identical to (that is, equal to) the relation &quot;are formula_36-equivalent&quot; (so in particular, the former is transitive if and only if the latter is). 
When formula_7 is irreflexive then the property known as &quot;transitivity of incomparability&quot; (defined below) is the condition necessary and sufficient to guarantee that the relation &quot;are formula_36-equivalent&quot; does indeed form an equivalence relation on formula_22 
When this is the case, it allows any two elements formula_30 satisfying formula_34 to be identified as a single object (specifically, they are identified together in their common equivalence class).

Definition

A strict weak ordering on a set formula_8 is a strict partial order formula_7 on formula_8 for which the induced on formula_8 by formula_7 is a transitive relation. 
Explicitly, a strict weak order on formula_8 is a homogeneous relation formula_7 on formula_8 that has all four of the following properties:
Properties (1), (2), and (3) are the defining properties of a strict partial order, although there is some redundancy in this list as asymmetry (3) implies irreflexivity (1), and also because irreflexivity (1) and transitivity (2) together imply asymmetry (3). The incomparability relation is always symmetric and it will be reflexive if and only if formula_7 is an irreflexive relation (which is assumed by the above definition). 
Consequently, a strict partial order formula_7 is a strict weak order if and only if its induced incomparability relation is an equivalence relation. 
In this case, its equivalence classes partition formula_8 and moreover, the set formula_53 of these equivalence classes can be strictly totally ordered by a binary relation, also denoted by formula_54 that is defined for all formula_55 by: 

:formula_56 for some (or equivalently, for all) representatives formula_57 

Conversely, any strict total order on a partition formula_53 of formula_8 gives rise to a strict weak ordering formula_7 on formula_8 defined by formula_62 if and only if there exists sets formula_55 in this partition such that formula_64 

Not every partial order obeys the transitive law for incomparability. For instance, consider the partial order in the set formula_65 defined by the relationship formula_66 The pairs formula_67 are incomparable but formula_68 and formula_69 are related, so incomparability does not form an equivalence relation and this example is not a strict weak ordering.

For transitivity of incomparability, each of the following conditions is necessary, and for strict partial orders also sufficient:
* If formula_11 then for all formula_4 either formula_72 or both.
* If formula_1 is incomparable with formula_3 then for all formula_75, either (formula_76) or (formula_77) or (formula_75 is incomparable with formula_1 and formula_75 is incomparable with formula_3).

===Total preorders===

Strict weak orders are very closely related to total preorders or (non-strict) weak orders, and the same mathematical concepts that can be modeled with strict weak orderings can be modeled equally well with total preorders. A total preorder or weak order is a preorder in which any two elements are comparable. A total preorder formula_25 satisfies the following properties:

* : For all formula_83 if formula_84 then formula_85
* : For all formula_86 formula_87
** Which implies : for all formula_88 formula_89

A total order is a total preorder which is antisymmetric, in other words, which is also a partial order. Total preorders are sometimes also called preference relations.

The complement of a strict weak order is a total preorder, and vice versa, but it seems more natural to relate strict weak orders and total preorders in a way that preserves rather than reverses the order of the elements. Thus we take the converse of the complement: for a strict weak ordering formula_54 define a total preorder formula_25 by setting formula_28 whenever it is not the case that formula_93 In the other direction, to define a strict weak ordering &lt; from a total preorder formula_94 set formula_11 whenever it is not the case that formula_96

In any preorder there is a corresponding equivalence relation where two elements formula_1 and formula_3 are defined as equivalent if formula_99 In the case of a preorder the corresponding partial order on the set of equivalence classes is a total order. Two elements are equivalent in a total preorder if and only if they are incomparable in the corresponding strict weak ordering.

===Ordered partitions===

A partition of a set formula_8 is a family of non-empty disjoint subsets of formula_8 that have formula_8 as their union. A partition, together with a total order on the sets of the partition, gives a structure called by Richard P. Stanley an ordered partition and by Theodore Motzkin a list of sets. An ordered partition of a finite set may be written as a finite sequence of the sets in the partition: for instance, the three ordered partitions of the set formula_103 are
formula_104
formula_105
formula_106

In a strict weak ordering, the equivalence classes of incomparability give a set partition, in which the sets inherit a total ordering from their elements, giving rise to an ordered partition. In the other direction, any ordered partition gives rise to a strict weak ordering in which two elements are incomparable when they belong to the same set in the partition, and otherwise inherit the order of the sets that contain them.

===Representation by functions===

For sets of sufficiently small cardinality, a fourth axiomatization is possible, based on real-valued functions. If formula_107 is any set then a real-valued function formula_108 on formula_107 induces a strict weak order on formula_107 by setting 
formula_111 
The associated total preorder is given by setting 
formula_112 
and the associated equivalence by setting 
formula_113

The relations do not change when formula_114 is replaced by formula_115 (composite function), where formula_116 is a strictly increasing real-valued function defined on at least the range of formula_117 Thus for example, a utility function defines a preference relation. In this context, weak orderings are also known as preferential arrangements.

If formula_107 is finite or countable, every weak order on formula_107 can be represented by a function in this way. However, there exist strict weak orders that have no corresponding real function. For example, there is no such function for the lexicographic order on formula_120 Thus, while in most preference relation models the relation defines a utility function up to order-preserving transformations, there is no such function for lexicographic preferences.

More generally, if formula_107 is a set, formula_122 is a set with a strict weak ordering formula_123 and formula_124 is a function, then formula_114 induces a strict weak ordering on formula_107 by setting 
formula_111
As before, the associated total preorder is given by setting 
formula_128 
and the associated equivalence by setting 
formula_129 
It is not assumed here that formula_114 is an injective function, so a class of two equivalent elements on formula_122 may induce a larger class of equivalent elements on formula_132 Also, formula_114 is not assumed to be a surjective function, so a class of equivalent elements on formula_122 may induce a smaller or empty class on formula_132 However, the function formula_114 induces an injective function that maps the partition on formula_107 to that on formula_138 Thus, in the case of finite partitions, the number of classes in formula_107 is less than or equal to the number of classes on formula_138

==Related types of ordering==

Semiorders generalize strict weak orderings, but do not assume transitivity of incomparability. A strict weak order that is trichotomous is called a strict total order. The total preorder which is the inverse of its complement is in this case a total order.

For a strict weak order formula_7 another associated reflexive relation is its reflexive closure, a (non-strict) partial order formula_142 The two associated reflexive relations differ with regard to different formula_143 and formula_68 for which neither formula_62 nor formula_146: in the total preorder corresponding to a strict weak order we get formula_147 and formula_148 while in the partial order given by the reflexive closure we get neither formula_149 nor formula_150 For strict total orders these two associated reflexive relations are the same: the corresponding (non-strict) total order. The reflexive closure of a strict weak ordering is a type of series-parallel partial order.

==All weak orders on a finite set==

===Combinatorial enumeration===
The number of distinct weak orders (represented either as strict weak orders or as total preorders) on an formula_151-element set is given by the following sequence :
These numbers are also called the Fubini numbers or ordered Bell numbers.

For example, for a set of three labeled items, there is one weak order in which all three items are tied. There are three ways of partitioning the items into one singleton set and one group of two tied items, and each of these partitions gives two weak orders (one in which the singleton is smaller than the group of two, and one in which this ordering is reversed), giving six weak orders of this type. And there is a single way of partitioning the set into three singletons, which can be totally ordered in six different ways. Thus, altogether, there are 13 different weak orders on three items.

===Adjacency structure===
Unlike for partial orders, the family of weak orderings on a given finite set is not in general connected by moves that add or remove a single order relation to or from a given ordering. For instance, for three elements, the ordering in which all three elements are tied differs by at least two pairs from any other weak ordering on the same set, in either the strict weak ordering or total preorder axiomatizations. However, a different kind of move is possible, in which the weak orderings on a set are more highly connected. Define a to be a weak ordering with two equivalence classes, and define a dichotomy to be with a given weak ordering if every two elements that are related in the ordering are either related in the same way or tied in the dichotomy. Alternatively, a dichotomy may be defined as a Dedekind cut for a weak ordering. Then a weak ordering may be characterized by its set of compatible dichotomies. For a finite set of labeled items, every pair of weak orderings may be connected to each other by a sequence of moves that add or remove one dichotomy at a time to or from this set of dichotomies. Moreover, the undirected graph that has the weak orderings as its vertices, and these moves as its edges, forms a partial cube.

Geometrically, the total orderings of a given finite set may be represented as the vertices of a permutohedron, and the dichotomies on this same set as the facets of the permutohedron. In this geometric representation, the weak orderings on the set correspond to the faces of all different dimensions of the permutohedron (including the permutohedron itself, but not the empty set, as a face). The codimension of a face gives the number of equivalence classes in the corresponding weak ordering. In this geometric representation the partial cube of moves on weak orderings is the graph describing the covering relation of the face lattice of the permutohedron.

For instance, for formula_152 the permutohedron on three elements is just a regular hexagon. The face lattice of the hexagon (again, including the hexagon itself as a face, but not including the empty set) has thirteen elements: one hexagon, six edges, and six vertices, corresponding to the one completely tied weak ordering, six weak orderings with one tie, and six total orderings. The graph of moves on these 13 weak orderings is shown in the figure.

==Applications==

As mentioned above, weak orders have applications in utility theory. In linear programming and other types of combinatorial optimization problem, the prioritization of solutions or of bases is often given by a weak order, determined by a real-valued objective function; the phenomenon of ties in these orderings is called &quot;degeneracy&quot;, and several types of tie-breaking rule have been used to refine this weak ordering into a total ordering in order to prevent problems caused by degeneracy.

Weak orders have also been used in computer science, in partition refinement based algorithms for lexicographic breadth-first search and lexicographic topological ordering. In these algorithms, a weak ordering on the vertices of a graph (represented as a family of sets that partition the vertices, together with a doubly linked list providing a total order on the sets) is gradually refined over the course of the algorithm, eventually producing a total ordering that is the output of the algorithm.

In the Standard Library for the C++ programming language, the set and multiset data types sort their input by a comparison function that is specified at the time of template instantiation, and that is assumed to implement a strict weak ordering.

<doc id="828135" wikidata="Q318429" url="?curid=828135" title="Malcolm Gladwell">
<text>Malcolm Timothy Gladwell (born 3 September 1963) is a Canadian journalist, author, and public speaker. He has been a staff writer for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; since 1996. He has published eight books. He is also the host of the podcast &quot;Revisionist History&quot; and co-founder of the podcast company Pushkin Industries.

Gladwell&#x27;s writings often deal with the unexpected implications of research in the social sciences, such as sociology and psychology, and make frequent and extended use of academic work. Gladwell was appointed to the Order of Canada in 2011.

==Early life and education==
Gladwell was born in Fareham, Hampshire, England. His mother Joyce (née Nation) Gladwell, is a Jamaican psychotherapist. His father, Graham Gladwell, was a mathematics professor from Kent, England. When he was six his family moved from Southampton to the Mennonite community of Elmira, Ontario, Canada. He has two brothers. Throughout his childhood, Malcolm lived in rural Ontario Mennonite country, where he attended a Mennonite church. Research done by historian Henry Louis Gates Jr. revealed that one of Gladwell&#x27;s maternal ancestors was a Jamaican free woman of colour (mixed black and white) who was a slaveowner. His great-great-great-grandmother was of Igbo ethnicity from Nigeria. In the epilogue of his 2008 book &quot;Outliers&quot; he describes many lucky circumstances that came to his family over the course of several generations, contributing to his path towards success. Gladwell has said that his mother is his role model as a writer.

Gladwell&#x27;s father noted that Malcolm was an unusually single-minded and ambitious boy. When Malcolm was 11, his father, a professor of mathematics and engineering at the University of Waterloo, allowed his son to wander around the offices at his university, which stoked the boy&#x27;s interest in reading and libraries. In the spring of 1982, Gladwell interned with the National Journalism Center in Washington, D.C. He graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history from Trinity College of the University of Toronto in 1984.

== Career ==
Gladwell decided to pursue advertising as a career after college. After being rejected by every advertising agency he applied to, he accepted a journalism position at conservative magazine &quot;The American Spectator&quot; and moved to Indiana. He subsequently wrote for &quot;Insight on the News&quot;, a conservative magazine owned by Sun Myung Moon&#x27;s Unification Church. In 1987, Gladwell began covering business and science for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, where he worked until 1996. In a personal elucidation of the 10,000-hour rule he popularized in &quot;Outliers&quot;, Gladwell notes, &quot;I was a basket case at the beginning, and I felt like an expert at the end. It took 10 years—exactly that long.&quot;

When Gladwell started at &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1996, he wanted to &quot;mine current academic research for insights, theories, direction, or inspiration&quot;. His first assignment was to write a piece about fashion. Instead of writing about high-class fashion, Gladwell opted to write a piece about a man who manufactured T-shirts, saying: &quot;[I]t was much more interesting to write a piece about someone who made a T-shirt for $8 than it was to write about a dress that costs $100,000. I mean, you or I could make a dress for $100,000, but to make a T-shirt for $8—that&#x27;s much tougher.&quot;

Gladwell gained popularity with two &quot;New Yorker&quot; articles, both written in 1996: &quot;The Tipping Point&quot; and &quot;The Coolhunt&quot;. These two pieces would become the basis for Gladwell&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Tipping Point&quot;, for which he received a $1 million advance. He continues to write for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Gladwell also served as a contributing editor for &quot;Grantland&quot;, a sports journalism website founded by former ESPN columnist Bill Simmons.

In a July 2002 article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Gladwell introduced the concept of the &quot;talent myth&quot; that companies and organizations, in his view, incorrectly follow. This work examines different managerial and administrative techniques that companies, both winners and losers, have used. He states that the misconception seems to be that management and executives are all too ready to classify employees without ample performance records and thus make hasty decisions. Many companies believe in disproportionately rewarding &quot;stars&quot; over other employees with bonuses and promotions. However, with the quick rise of inexperienced workers with little in-depth performance review, promotions are often incorrectly made, putting employees into positions they should not have and keeping other, more experienced employees from rising. He also points out that under this system, narcissistic personality types are more likely to climb the ladder, since they are more likely to take more credit for achievements and take less blame for failure. He states both that narcissists make the worst managers and that the system of rewarding &quot;stars&quot; eventually worsens a company&#x27;s position. Gladwell states that the most successful long-term companies are those who reward experience above all else and require greater time for promotions.

== Works ==
With the release of &quot;Revenge of the Tipping Point: Overstories, Superspreaders, and the Rise of Social Engineering&quot; in 2024, Gladwell has had eight books published.

When asked for the process behind his writing, he said: &quot;I have two parallel things I&#x27;m interested in. One is, I&#x27;m interested in collecting interesting stories, and the other is I&#x27;m interested in collecting interesting research. What I&#x27;m looking for is cases where they overlap&quot;.

===&quot;The Tipping Point&quot;===
The initial inspiration for his first book, &quot;The Tipping Point&quot;, which was published in 2000, came from the sudden drop of crime in New York City. He wanted the book to have a broader appeal than just crime, however, and sought to explain similar phenomena through the lens of epidemiology. While Gladwell was a reporter for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, he covered the AIDS epidemic. He began to take note of &quot;how strange epidemics were&quot;, saying epidemiologists have a &quot;strikingly different way of looking at the world&quot;. The term &quot;tipping point&quot; comes from the moment in an epidemic when the virus reaches critical mass and begins to spread at a much higher rate.

Gladwell&#x27;s theories of crime were heavily influenced by the &quot;broken windows theory&quot; of policing, and Gladwell is credited for packaging and popularizing the theory in a way that was implementable in New York City. Gladwell&#x27;s theoretical implementation bears a striking resemblance to the &quot;stop-and-frisk&quot; policies of the NYPD. However, in the decade and a half since its publication, &quot;The Tipping Point&quot; and Gladwell have both come under fire for the tenuous link between &quot;broken windows&quot; and New York City&#x27;s drop in violent crime. During a 2013 interview with BBC journalist Jon Ronson for &quot;The Culture Show&quot;, Gladwell admitted that he was &quot;too in love with the broken-windows notion&quot;. He went on to say that he was &quot;so enamored by the metaphorical simplicity of that idea that I overstated its importance&quot;.

===&quot;Blink&quot;===
After &quot;The Tipping Point,&quot; Gladwell published &quot;Blink&quot; in 2005. The book explains how the human unconscious interprets events or cues as well as how past experiences can lead people to make informed decisions very rapidly. Gladwell uses examples like the Getty kouros and psychologist John Gottman&#x27;s research on the likelihood of divorce in married couples. Gladwell&#x27;s hair was the inspiration for &quot;Blink&quot;. He stated that once he allowed his hair to get longer, he started to get speeding tickets all the time, an oddity considering that he had never gotten one before and that he started getting pulled out of airport security lines for special attention. In a particular incident, he was apprehended by three police officers while walking in downtown Manhattan because his curly hair matched the profile of a rapist, despite the fact the suspect looked nothing like him otherwise.

Gladwell&#x27;s &quot;The Tipping Point&quot; (2000) and &quot;Blink&quot; (2005) were international bestsellers. &quot;The Tipping Point&quot; sold more than two million copies in the United States. &quot;Blink&quot; sold equally well. As of November 2008, the two books had sold a combined 4.5 million copies.

===&quot;Outliers&quot;===
Gladwell&#x27;s third book, &quot;Outliers&quot;, published in 2008, examines how a person&#x27;s environment, in conjunction with personal drive and motivation, affects his or her possibility and opportunity for success. Gladwell&#x27;s original question revolved around lawyers: &quot;We take it for granted that there&#x27;s this guy in New York who&#x27;s the corporate lawyer, right? I just was curious: Why is it all the same guy?&quot;, referring to the fact that &quot;a surprising number of the most powerful and successful corporate lawyers in New York City have almost the exact same biography&quot;. In another example given in the book, Gladwell noticed that people ascribe Bill Gates&#x27;s success to being &quot;really smart&quot; or &quot;really ambitious&quot;. He noted that he knew a lot of people who are really smart and really ambitious, but not worth $60 billion. &quot;It struck me that our understanding of success was really crude—and there was an opportunity to dig down and come up with a better set of explanations.&quot;

===&quot;What the Dog Saw&quot;===
Gladwell&#x27;s fourth book, &quot;What the Dog Saw: And Other Adventures&quot;, was published in 2009. &quot;What the Dog Saw&quot; bundles together Gladwell&#x27;s favourites of his articles from &quot;The New Yorker&quot; since he joined the magazine as a staff writer in 1996. The stories share a common theme, namely that Gladwell tries to show us the world through the eyes of others, even if that other happens to be a dog.

===&quot;David and Goliath&quot;===
Gladwell&#x27;s fifth book, &quot;David and Goliath&quot;, was released in October 2013, and examines the struggle of underdogs versus favourites. The book is partially inspired by an article Gladwell wrote for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 2009 entitled &quot;How David Beats Goliath&quot;. The book was a bestseller but received mixed reviews.

===&quot;Talking to Strangers&quot;===
Gladwell&#x27;s sixth book, &quot;Talking to Strangers&quot;, was released September 2019. The book examines interactions with strangers, covers examples that include the deceptions of Bernie Madoff, the trial of Amanda Knox, the suicide of Sylvia Plath, the Jerry Sandusky pedophilia case at Penn State, and the death of Sandra Bland. Gladwell explained what inspired him to write the book as being &quot;struck by how many high profile cases in the news were about the same thing—strangers misunderstanding each other.&quot; It challenges the assumptions we are programmed to make when encountering strangers, and the potentially dangerous consequences of misreading people we do not know.

===&quot;The Bomber Mafia&quot;===
Gladwell&#x27;s seventh book, &quot;The Bomber Mafia: A Dream, a Temptation, and the Longest Night of the Second World War&quot;, was released in April 2021.

=== &quot;Revenge of the Tipping Point&quot; ===
Gladwell&#x27;s eighth book, &quot;Revenge of the Tipping Point&quot; was released in October 2024. The book is a sequel to his best seller &quot;The Tipping Point,&quot; which was released in 2000. The book discusses social epidemics and tipping points, this time with the aim of explaining the dark side of contagious phenomena, and offers an alternate history of two of the biggest epidemics of our day: COVID and the opioid crisis.

==Reception==
&quot;The Tipping Point&quot; was named as one of the best books of the decade by &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and &quot;The Times&quot;. It was also Barnes &amp; Noble&#x27;s fifth-best-selling non-fiction book of the decade. &quot;Blink&quot; was named to &quot;Fast Company&quot; list of the best business books of 2005. It was also number 5 on Amazon customers&#x27; favourite books of 2005, named to &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; best non-fiction books of 2005, and in the top 50 of Amazon customers&#x27; favourite books of the decade. &quot;Outliers&quot; was a number 1 &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller for 11 straight weeks and was &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s number 10 non-fiction book of 2008 as well as named to the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; list of the 50 best non-fiction books of 2008.

&quot;Fortune&quot; described &quot;The Tipping Point&quot; as &quot;a fascinating book that makes you see the world in a different way&quot;. The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; called it &quot;a wonderfully offbeat study of that little-understood phenomenon, the social epidemic&quot;.

Reviewing &quot;Blink&quot;, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; dubbed Gladwell &quot;the most original American journalist since the young Tom Wolfe.&quot; Farhad Manjoo at &quot;Salon&quot; described the book as &quot;a real pleasure. As in the best of Gladwell&#x27;s work, &quot;Blink&quot; brims with surprising insights about our world and ourselves.&quot; &quot;The Economist&quot; called &quot;Outliers&quot; &quot;a compelling read with an important message&quot;. David Leonhardt wrote in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;: &quot;In the vast world of nonfiction writing, Malcolm Gladwell is as close to a singular talent as exists today&quot; and &quot;Outliers&quot; &quot;leaves you mulling over its inventive theories for days afterward&quot;. Ian Sample wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;Brought together, the pieces form a dazzling record of Gladwell&#x27;s art. There is depth to his research and clarity in his arguments, but it is the breadth of subjects he applies himself to that is truly impressive.&quot;

Gladwell&#x27;s critics have described him as prone to oversimplification. &quot;The New Republic&quot; called the final chapter of &quot;Outliers,&quot; &quot;impervious to all forms of critical thinking&quot; and said Gladwell believes &quot;a perfect anecdote proves a fatuous rule&quot;. Gladwell has also been criticized for his emphasis on anecdotal evidence over research to support his conclusions. Maureen Tkacik and Steven Pinker have challenged the integrity of Gladwell&#x27;s approach. Even while praising Gladwell&#x27;s writing style and content, Pinker summed up Gladwell as &quot;a minor genius who unwittingly demonstrates the hazards of statistical reasoning&quot;, while accusing him of &quot;cherry-picked anecdotes, post-hoc sophistry and false dichotomies&quot; in his book &quot;Outliers&quot;. Referencing a Gladwell reporting mistake in which Gladwell refers to &quot;eigenvalue&quot; as &quot;Igon Value&quot;, Pinker criticizes his lack of expertise: &quot;I will call this the Igon Value Problem: when a writer&#x27;s education on a topic consists in interviewing an expert, he is apt to offer generalizations that are banal, obtuse or flat wrong.&quot; A writer in &quot;The Independent&quot; accused Gladwell of posing &quot;obvious&quot; insights. &quot;The Register&quot; has accused Gladwell of making arguments by weak analogy and commented Gladwell has an &quot;aversion for fact&quot;, adding: &quot;Gladwell has made a career out of handing simple, vacuous truths to people and dressing them up with flowery language and an impressionistic take on the scientific method.&quot; In that regard, &quot;The New Republic&quot; has called him &quot;America&#x27;s Best-Paid Fairy-Tale Writer&quot;. His approach was satirized by the online site &quot;The Malcolm Gladwell Book Generator&quot;.

In 2005, Gladwell commanded a $45,000 speaking fee. In 2008, he was making &quot;about 30 speeches a year—most for tens of thousands of dollars, some for free&quot;, according to a profile in &quot;New York&quot; magazine. In 2011, he gave three talks to groups of small businessmen as part of a three-city speaking tour put on by Bank of America. The program was titled &quot;Bank of America Small Business Speaker Series: A Conversation with Malcolm Gladwell&quot;. Paul Starobin, writing in the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot;, said the engagement&#x27;s &quot;entire point seemed to be to forge a public link between a tarnished brand (the bank), and a winning one (a journalist often described in profiles as the epitome of cool)&quot;. An article by Melissa Bell of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; posed the question: &quot;Malcolm Gladwell: Bank of America&#x27;s new spokesman?&quot; &quot;Mother Jones&quot; editor Clara Jeffery said Gladwell&#x27;s job for Bank of America had &quot;terrible ethical optics&quot;. However, Gladwell says he was unaware that Bank of America was &quot;bragging about his speaking engagements&quot; until the &quot;Atlantic Wire&quot; emailed him. Gladwell explained:
In 2012, CBS&#x27;s &quot;60 Minutes&quot; attributed the trend of American parents &quot;redshirting&quot; their five-year-olds (postponing entrance into kindergarten to give them an advantage) to a section in Gladwell&#x27;s &quot;Outliers&quot;.

Sociology professor Shayne Lee referenced &quot;Outliers&quot; in a CNN editorial commemorating Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s birthday. Lee discussed the strategic timing of King&#x27;s ascent from a &quot;Gladwellian perspective&quot;. Gladwell gives credit to Richard Nisbett and Lee Ross for inventing the Gladwellian genre.

Gladwell has provided blurbs for &quot;scores of book covers&quot;, leading &quot;The New York Times&quot; to ask, &quot;Is it possible that Mr. Gladwell has been spreading the love a bit too thinly?&quot; Gladwell, who said he did not know how many blurbs he had written, acknowledged, &quot;The more blurbs you give, the lower the value of the blurb. It&#x27;s the tragedy of the commons.&quot;

==Podcast==
Gladwell is host of the podcast &quot;Revisionist History&quot;, initially produced through Panoply Media and now through Gladwell&#x27;s own podcast company. It began in 2016 and has aired seven 10-episode seasons. Each episode begins with an inquiry about a person, event, or idea, and proceeds to question the received wisdom about the subject. Gladwell was recruited to create a podcast by Jacob Weisberg, editor-in-chief of The Slate Group, which also includes the podcast network Panoply Media. In September 2018, Gladwell announced he was co-founding a podcast company, later named Pushkin Industries, with Weisberg. About this decision, Gladwell told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;: &quot;There is a certain kind of whimsy and emotionality that can only be captured on audio.&quot;

He also has a music podcast with Bruce Headlam and Rick Rubin, titled &quot;Broken Record&quot; where they interview musicians. It has two seasons, 2018–2019 and 2020 with a total of 49 episodes.

==Personal life==
Gladwell is a Christian. His family attended Above Bar Church in Southampton, U.K., and later Gale Presbyterian in Elmira when they moved to Canada. His parents and siblings are part of the Mennonite community in Southwestern Ontario. Gladwell wandered away from his Christian roots when he moved to New York, only to rediscover his faith during the writing of &quot;David and Goliath&quot; and his encounter with Wilma Derksen regarding the death of her child.

Gladwell was a national class runner and an Ontario High School (Ontario Federation of School Athletic Associations – OFSAA) champion. He was among Canada&#x27;s fastest teenagers at 1500 metres, running 4:14 at the age of 13 and 4:05 when aged 14. At university, Gladwell ran 1500 metres in 3:55. In 2014, at the age of 51, he ran a 4:54 at the Fifth Avenue Mile. At 57 he ran a 5:15 mile.

He had his first child, a daughter, in 2022. In 2024 it was reported that &quot;In a span of five years, he got engaged, had two children, turned 61, and moved from Manhattan to pastoral Hudson, New York.&quot;.

Gladwell is passionate about cars and reading car magazines, particularly the British magazine Car.

==Awards and honours==
In 2005, &quot;Time&quot; named Gladwell one of its 100 most influential people.

In 2007, he received the American Sociological Association&#x27;s first Award for Excellence in the Reporting of Social Issues. The same year, he received an honorary degree from the University of Waterloo.

In 2011, he was named a Member of the Order of Canada, the second highest honour for merit in the system of orders, decorations, and medals of Canada.

He has received honorary degrees from the University of Waterloo (2007) and the University of Toronto (2011).

<text>Expo &#x27;75 ( ) was a World&#x27;s Fair held on the island of Okinawa in Japan from July 20, 1975, to January 18, 1976.

==History ==
Expo 75 was conceived, in part, to commemorate the American handover of Okinawa to Japan in 1972. The theme of the exposition was the oceans, and focused on oceanographic technologies, marine life, and oceanic cultures. The motto was “The sea we would like to see&quot; (海－その望ましい未来, &quot;Umi - sono nozomashii mirai&quot;).

The event was located on the western end of the Motobu Peninsula, with a site area of 1,000,000 square metres (including sea areas). Thirty-seven nations participated, along with eight domestic and three international organizations. The keynote speaker on opening day was American author James A. Michener.

The exposition is the given reason for the construction of the Nakagusuku Hotel.

==Expo 75 site ==

The site was divided into four “Clusters” in which there were pavilions and exhibits:

===Fish Cluster ===
* Iran Pavilion
* Sumitomo Pavilion
* Aquarium
* Dolphin Land
* Expo Future Car (C.V.S.)

===Peoples and History Cluster ===
* International Pavilion No. 1
* Okinawa Pavilion
* EXPO Hall
* Hitachi Pavilion
* Oceanic Culture Museum — Audio-visual hall, planetarium and exhibition hall displaying ships, carvings, and other cultural items from the Pacific Ocean area.
* Mitsubishi Pavilion — Ride featuring underwater technologies
* International Pavilion No. 2

===Science and Technology Cluster ===
* World Ocean Systems (W.O.S) — Whale-shaped theater.
* Mistui Children’s Pavilion
* Fuyo Group Pavilion — Featuring oceanic robotics and aerial garden.
* U.S.A. Pavilion
* Aquapolis — Centerpiece floating city.
* Canada Pavilion
* Australia Pavilion
* Italy Pavilion
* U.S.S.R. Pavilion
* Expo New City Car (K.R.T.)

===Ships Cluster ===
* International Pavilion No. 3
* Midori/Icearama Pavilion – Iceberg-shaped building displaying a 3,000-year-old ice core, and a 12,000-year-old ice core.
* EXPO Port
* Guest House

There was also EXPO Port, EXPO Beach, and an amusement park named EXPO Land.

==Highlights ==
The centerpiece of Expo 75 was the Aquapolis a floating city designed by Japanese architect Kiyonori Kikutake. It was envisioned as a concept of how humans could live harmoniously on the ocean, and a prototype for marine communities. The Aquapolis was constructed at a shipyard in Hiroshima, Japan, and then towed to the Expo site. The facility was funded by the Japanese government, and cost 13 billion yen. It was thirty-two meters high, and had a one-hundred square meter deck. It was later sold for scrap in 2000.

The Expo Transit System featured two types of automated, electric transport vehicles: The &quot;Expo New City Cars&quot; (KRT) ran on a 3.7 km track almost the whole length of the site, there were three stations. The Expo Future Cars (CVS) track was at the north end and connected the Fish Cluster with Expo Land via five stations.

==Post-Exposition ==
After the Expo was over, the site became Okinawa Commemorative National Government Park (国営沖縄記念公園), also known as Ocean Expo Park. Most of the exhibits were removed, although the Aquapolis was retained as an attraction and eventually hosted four million visitors. As years passed, the number of visitors to the Aquapolis declined and it was closed in 1993. In October 2000, the Aquapolis was towed away to Shanghai to be scrapped.
The main tank of the aquarium facility that was opened at Expo was the largest indoor aquarium in the world at that time with a water volume of . After that, we continued to use the Aquarium facility used in Expo&#x27;75 and opened it as the Okinawa Ocean Expo Aquarium. The Okinawa Ocean Expo Aquarium was closed in 2002 due to aging and then reopened as Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium.

The Tropical &amp; Subtropical Arboretum were later constructed on the site.

<doc id="828142" wikidata="Q6630631" url="?curid=828142" title="Christopher Street Day">
<text>Christopher Street Day (CSD) is an annual European LGBTQ+ celebration and demonstration held in various cities across Europe for the rights of LGBTQ+ people, and against discrimination and exclusion. It is Germany&#x27;s and Switzerland&#x27;s counterpart to Gay Pride or Pride Parades. Austria calls their Pride Parade &quot;Rainbow Parade&quot;. The most prominent CSD events are Berlin Pride, CSD Hamburg, and CSD Cologne in Germany, and CSD Zürich in Switzerland.

== History ==
The CSD is held in memory of the Stonewall riots, the first big uprising of LGBT people against police assaults that took place at the Stonewall Inn, a bar on Manhattan, New York City&#x27;s Christopher Street in the district of Greenwich Village on June 28, 1969.

On Saturday, June 27, 1970, marches to mark the first anniversary of Stonewall were held in Chicago and San Francisco, followed on Sunday, June 28, 1970, by the Christopher Street Liberation Day Parade in New York and the Christopher Street West Association Parade in Los Angeles; the four gatherings were the first Pride parades in United States history. To accommodate the interests of the many different groups participating, the Christopher Street Liberation Day Committee named the days leading up to the march Gay Pride Week.

The first four American cities have since continued to celebrate Pride on the last weekend of each June. It has become an international tradition to hold a demonstration for the rights of LGBT people in the summer. The first German Christopher Street Day took place in Berlin in 1979; other parades before then had different names. The first documented LGBT parade in Germany was in Münster on 29 April 1972. The first parade in Switzerland was celebrated on June 24, 1978 in Zürich and was called &quot;Christopher Street Liberation Memorial Day.&quot;

== Current situation ==
CSD Berlin started in 1979. Now almost every large city in Germany celebrates CSD, with the largest in Berlin (Berlin Pride), Hamburg (Hamburg Pride) and Cologne (Cologne Pride). When Cologne hosted Europride in 2002, it attracted 1.2 million participants and spectators to the city together with the Cologne Carnival.

Due to organizational reasons, the CSDs do not take place on the historic date of June 27, but on different weekends between June and August. On the one hand, CSDs are considered political parades, and therefore also include speeches, political mottos, and attendances and patronages from well-known politicians. On the other hand, CSDs are often compared to carnival processions or techno parades, in which celebrating and partying are the main focus. 

A typical Christopher Street Day Parade includes floats as well as walking groups usually provided by and made up of members of LGBT organizations, but is increasingly used also as a platform for political campaigning and commercial advertising as floats by political parties and commercially sponsored trucks are becoming more common. It is also typical to see many drag queens or women and men colorfully dressed. BDSM enthusiasts also often participate in CSDs. The parade is usually quite joyous and has a rather upbeat and exciting energy to it. In addition to the Parade and the final rallies, in many cities there are days or up to whole weeks of street festivals and cultural events with artists, political events, lectures, readings, parties and other festivities.

== In Berlin ==


The largest gay street party in Europe is held each year since 1993 in Berlin and is called Lesbian and Gay City Festival (&quot;Lesbisch-schwules Stadtfest Berlin&quot;). Today Berlin is the leading city in Europe when it comes to gay events with four major gay festivals held each year: Lesbian and Gay City Festival, Berlin Pride, Folsom Europe and Easter Berlin. Even a smaller Pride Parade called Kreuzberg Pride, is held every year together with Dyke March.

The growth and commercialization of CSDs, coupled with their de-politicization – has led to an alternative CSD in Berlin, the so-called Kreuzberg Pride (Kreuzberger CSD) or &quot;Transgenialer&quot; (&quot;Transgenial&quot;/&quot;Trans Ingenious&quot;) CSD. Political party members are not invited for speeches, nor can parties or companies sponsor floats. After the parade there is a festival with a stage for political speakers and entertainers. Groups discuss lesbian/transsexual/transgender/gay or queer perspectives on issues such as poverty and unemployment benefits (Hartz IV), gentrification, or &quot;Fortress Europe.&quot;
In June 2010, American philosopher and theorist Judith Butler refused the Civil Courage Award (Zivilcouragepreis) of the Christopher Street Day Parade in Berlin, Germany at the award ceremony, arguing and lamenting in a speech that the parade had become too commercial, and was ignoring the problems of racism and the double discrimination facing homosexual or transsexual migrants. According to Butler, even the organizers themselves promote racism. The general manager of the CSD committee, Robert Kastl, countered Butler&#x27;s allegations and pointed out that the organizers already awarded a counselling center for lesbians dealing with double discrimination in 2006. Regarding the allegations of commercialism Kastl explained further that the CSD organizers do not require small groups to pay a participation fee which starts at 50 € and goes up to 1500 €. He also distanced himself from all forms of racism and Islamophobia.

==Politicians attending==
Politicians often participate in CSDs, including:
*Federal Foreign Minister and Vice Chancellor Joschka Fischer (Cologne, 2002, Hamburg 2004, Cologne 2005)
*Federal Minister Renate Künast (Berlin 2001)
*Former Governing Mayor of Berlin Klaus Wowereit (since 2001)
*Mayor of Frankfurt Petra Roth (2004)
*Prime Minister of Hesse Roland Koch (Frankfurt am Main)
*President of the German Bundestag Wolfgang Thierse (Berlin 2000)

In some cities, politicians are also patrons of the CSD, for example in Hamburg, the former First Mayor Ortwin Runde, and Ole von Beust, in Dresden Mayor Ingolf Rossberg, in Würzburg Claudia Roth, in Munich the former Mayor Christian Ude as well as current Mayor Dieter Reiter and in Brunswick, the former Federal Minister Jürgen Trittin.

<text>The British Rail Class 40 is a type of British railway diesel electric locomotive. A total of 200 were built by English Electric between 1958 and 1962. They were numbered D200-D399. Despite their initial success, by the time the last examples were entering service they were already being replaced on some top-level duties by more powerful locomotives. As they were slowly relegated from express passenger uses, the type found work on secondary passenger and freight services where they worked for many years. The final locomotives ended regular service in 1985. The locomotives were commonly known as &quot;Whistlers&quot; because of the distinctive noise made by their turbochargers.

==Origins==

The origins of the Class 40 fleet lay in the prototype diesel locomotives (LMS No. 10000 and 10001 ordered by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway and British Railways and D16/2 ordered by British Railways between 1947 and 1954) and most notably with the Southern Region locomotive No. 10203, which was powered by English Electric&#x27;s 16SVT MkII engine developing 2,000 bhp (1,460 kW). The bogie design and power train of 10203 was used almost unchanged on the first ten production Class 40s.

==Prototypes==

British Railways originally ordered ten Class 40s, then known as &quot;English Electric Type 4s&quot;, as evaluation prototypes. They were built at the Vulcan Foundry in Newton-le-Willows, Lancashire. The first locomotive, D200, was delivered to Stratford on 14 March 1958. Following fitter and crew training, D200 made its passenger début on an express train from London Liverpool Street to on 18 April 1958. Five of the prototypes, Nos. D200, D202-D205, were trialled on similar services on the former Great Eastern routes, whilst the remaining five, Nos. D201, D206-D209, worked on Great Northern services on the East Coast Main Line.

Sir Brian Robertson, then chairman of the British Transport Commission, was less than impressed, believing that the locomotives lacked the power to maintain heavy trains at high speed and were too expensive to run in multiple – opinions that were later proved to be correct. Airing his views at the regional boards prompted others to break cover and it was agreed that later orders would be uprated to 2,500 hp (a change that was never applied). Direct comparisons on the Great Eastern Main Line showed they offered little advantage over the &quot;Britannia&quot; class steam locomotives when driven well, and the Eastern Region declined to accept further machines as they deemed them unsuitable to replace the Pacific steam locomotives on the East Coast Main Line, preferring to hold on until the &quot;Deltic&quot; Class 55 diesels were delivered.

The London Midland Region was only too pleased, as the Eastern Region&#x27;s decision released additional locomotives to replace their ageing steam fleet. The West Coast Main Line had been starved of investment for many years and the poor track and generally lower speeds (when compared to the East Coast route) suited Class 40s, as the need to hold trains at speed for long periods simply did not exist and it better took advantage of their fairly rapid acceleration.

==Production==
Following the mixed success of the prototypes, another 190 locomotives were ordered by British Railways, and were numbered from D210 to D399. All were built at Vulcan Foundry, except one batch of twenty (Nos. D305–D324) which were built at Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns factory in Darlington. All the locomotives were painted in the British Railways diesel green livery, and the final locomotive, D399, was delivered in September 1962.

Batches of the class were built with significant design differences, due to changes in railway working practices. The first 125 locomotives, Nos. D200–D324, were built with steam-age &#x27;disc&#x27; headcode markers, which were used to identify services. Later, it was decided that locomotives should display the four character train reporting number (or headcode) of the service they were hauling, and Nos. D325–D344 were built with &#x27;split&#x27; headcode boxes, which displayed two characters either side of the locomotive&#x27;s central gangway doors. Another policy decision led to the discontinuing of the gangway doors (which enabled train crew to move between two or three locomotives in multiple). The remaining locomotives, Nos. D345–D399, carried a central four-character headcode box. In 1965, seven of the first batch of locomotives, Nos. D260–D266, which were based in Scotland, were converted to the central headcode design.

From 1973, locomotives were renumbered to suit the TOPS computer operating system, and became known as &#x27;Class 40&#x27;. Locomotives D201 to D399 were renumbered in sequence into the range 40 001 to 40 199. The first built locomotive, D200, was renumbered 40 122, which was vacant due to the scrapping of D322 as the result of accident damage.

==The named 40s==
Locomotives in the range D210–D235 were to be named after ships operated by the companies Cunard Line, Elder Dempster Lines, and Canadian Pacific Steamships, as they hauled express trains to Liverpool, the home port of these companies. The only locomotive not to carry a name was D226 which was to carry the name &quot;Media&quot; but never did so. From approximately 1970, with Class 40s no longer working these trains, the nameplates were gradually removed, so that by 1973 contributors to Railway World were reporting 7 different locomotives running without nameplates, all observed in North Wales. However the Ian Allan Motive Power Combined Volume (a list of all operational locomotives published annually for enthusiasts) was still listing the names of all officially named Class 40 locomotives in 1980 despite none having carried their nameplates for many years.

A series of unofficial names were applied to the Class 40s by enthusiasts and enthusiastic depot staff. Some locos ran in service with these names applied for many months, others were painted out within days.

The locos to carry these unofficial names were:
* 40 060 &#x27;Ancient Mariner&#x27; (while in departmental duties as 97 405)
* 40 104 &#x27;Warrior&#x27;
* 40 129 &#x27;Dracula&#x27;
* 40 131 &#x27;Spartan&#x27;
* 40 132 &#x27;Hurricane&#x27;
* 40 134 &#x27;Andromeda&#x27;
* 40 137 &#x27;Trojan&#x27;
* 40 145 &#x27;Panther&#x27;
* 40 150 &#x27;Crewe&#x27;
* 40 155 &#x27;Vulcan Empress&#x27;
* 40 164 &#x27;Lismore&#x27;

== BR service ==

The Class 40s operated in all areas of British Railways although sightings in the Western and Southern Regions have always been exceptionally rare and usually the result of special trains and/or unusual operational circumstances, but examples have been recorded such as D317 hauling a parcels train between Micheldever and Basingstoke on 3 July 1967, and D335 operating the 07:35 Oxford to Paddington and 10:16 Paddington - Birmingham on 29 June 1971. A review of the areas of operation published towards the end of the class&#x27;s operational life showed no regular operational service on the Southern Region, and the only parts of the Western Region regularly visited were the Cambrian Line between Shrewsbury and Aberystwyth, and freights on the Gloucester to Severn Tunnel Junction route.

After the early trials the majority of Class 40s were based at depots in northern England, notably Longsight, Carlisle Kingmoor, and Wigan Springs Branch on the Midland Region, and Thornaby and Gateshead on the Eastern Region.

The heyday of the class was in the early 1960s, when they hauled top-link expresses on the West Coast Main Line and in East Anglia. 

Like many diesel locomotive types of the time, they suffered criticism for reliability. The train heating boilers were a particular early problem on the EE type 4&#x27;s, requiring strict maintenance and were fairly complicated to operate. Late Autumn 1958 on the Great Northern line saw that, on six out of ten days, the Flying Scotsman service failed to produce an EE Type 4, and ran late with a steam loco deputising. Breakdowns were common. The biggest problem the class encountered was their poor power-to-weight ratio. They lacked the versatility of the Class 37s, being either too heavy or too underpowered, for the work allocated. 

However, the arrival of more powerful diesels such as Class 47, Class 50, Class 55, and the later InterCity 125, together with the electrification of the West Coast Main Line, meant that the fleet was gradually relegated to more mundane duties.
In later life the locomotives were mainly to be found hauling heavy freight and passenger trains in the north of England and Scotland. As more new rolling stock was introduced, their passenger work decreased, partly due to their lack of electric train heating (D255 was fitted with electric train heating for a trial period in the mid-1960s) for newer passenger coaches. They lost their last front-line passenger duties – in Scotland – in 1980, and the last regular use on passenger trains was on the North Wales Coast Line between Holyhead, Crewe and Manchester, along with regular forays across the Pennines on Liverpool to York and Newcastle services.

Throughout the early 1980s Class 40s were common performers on relief, day excursion (adex) and holidaymaker services along with deputisation duties for electric traction, especially on Sundays between Manchester and Birmingham. This resulted in visits to many distant parts of the network. It would be fair to say that few routes in the London Midland and Eastern regions did not see a Class 40 worked passenger service from time to time. Regular destinations included the seaside resorts of Scarborough, Skegness and Cleethorpes on the Eastern region, with Blackpool and Stranraer being regularly visited on the West Coast.

Much rarer workings include visits to London&#x27;s Paddington and Euston stations, Norwich, Cardiff and even Kyle of Lochalsh. The fact that 40s could turn up almost anywhere resulted in them being followed by a hard core of bashers, enthusiasts dedicated to journeying over lines with rare traction for the route.

=== Withdrawal ===
Withdrawal of the Class 40s started in 1976, when three locomotives (40 005, 40 039 and 40 102) were taken out of service. At over 130 tons the Class were by then considered underpowered. In addition, some were found to be suffering from fractures of the plate-frame bogies (due mainly to inappropriate use on wagon-load freight and the associated running into tightly curved yards), and spares were also needed to keep other locomotives running.

Also, many Class 40s were not fitted with air braking, leaving them unable to haul more modern freight and passenger vehicles. Despite this, only seventeen had been withdrawn by the start of the 1980s. The locomotives became more popular with railway enthusiasts as their numbers started to dwindle.

Withdrawals then picked up apace, with the locomotives which lacked air brakes taking the brunt of the decline. In 1981, all 130 remaining locomotives were concentrated in the London Midland region of BR. Classified works overhauls on the Class 40s were also gradually phased out, only 29 members of the class had a full classified in 1980, and the final two emerged from Crewe Works in 1981. The last to receive a classified overhaul was 40 167 in February 1981.

After that, numbers dwindled slowly until, by the end of 1984, there were only sixteen still running. These included the pioneer locomotive, 40 122, which, having been withdrawn in 1981, was reinstated in July 1983 and painted in the original green livery to haul rail enthusiasts&#x27; specials. The last passenger run by a Class 40, apart from 40 122, occurred on 27 January 1985, when 40 012 hauled a train from Birmingham New Street to York. All the remaining locomotives except 40 122 were withdrawn the next day.

The majority of Class 40s were cut up at Crewe, Doncaster, and Swindon works.
Crewe works dismantled the most 40s, the totals are listed below.
* Crewe Works scrapped 65 locos
* Doncaster Works scrapped 64 locos
* Swindon Works scrapped 54 locos.

The other ten locos to be scrapped were cut at Derby, Glasgow, Inverkeithing, and Vic Berry at Leicester.

1981 and 1983 saw the highest number of Class 40 withdrawals, a total of 41 locomotives being withdrawn both years.

The very last Class 40s to be cut up were 40 091 and 40 195 by A. Hampton contractors at Crewe Works in December 1988.

===Further use===

The Class 40 story was not quite over, however. Upon the joint initiative of enthusiasts Howard Johnston and Murray Brown who noticed 40 122 on the withdrawn sidings at Carlisle Kingmoor depot in summer 1981 ready to go to Swindon Works for breaking up. 40 122 was reinstated by BR, with a replacement bogie and power unit from 40 076, after an overhaul at Toton depot. Now in working condition and repainted in BR green, it was regularly used to haul normal passenger trains in the hope of attracting enthusiasts, as well as special trains. In addition, four locomotives were temporarily returned to service as Class 97 departmental locomotives, numbered 97 405–408. They were used to work engineering trains for a remodelling project at Crewe station. These were withdrawn by March 1987.

40 122 was eventually withdrawn in 1988 and presented to the National Railway Museum. Six other locomotives were preserved, and on 30 November 2002, over sixteen years after the last Class 40 had hauled a mainline passenger train, the Class 40 Preservation Society&#x27;s 40 145 hauled an enthusiasts&#x27; railtour, &quot;The Christmas Cracker IV&quot;, from Crewe to Holyhead via Birmingham. Following a three-year hiatus, after suffering a traction motor flashover, 40 145 returned to mainline operation in 2014.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 3 June 1962, D244, just 30 months old was at the head of the 22:15 Kings Cross - Edinburgh sleeper from the previous night. The train was diverted from Peterborough via Sleaford with a route conductor taking charge. Approaching Lincoln at 00:45 hours on the Sunday morning, too fast for a 15 mph permanent speed restriction, the locomotive lurched but stayed on the track, though its train of sleeping cars were all derailed. The rear portion of the train narrowly missed demolishing Pelham Street Signal Box. Three people were killed in the incident, including the Sleeping Car Attendant, whilst 30 others were injured.
* On 26 December 1962, D215 &quot;Aquitania&quot; was hauling the up &quot;Mid-Day Scot&quot; when it collided with the rear of a Liverpool-Birmingham train, at Coppenhall Junction, Crewe. 18 were killed and 34 injured, including the guard. Contrary to popular belief, D326 was not hauling the train.
* On 13 May 1966, a freight train became divided between Norton Junction and Weaver Junction, Cheshire. Locomotive D322, hauling an express passenger train, was in collision with the rear part of the freight train, which had run away. Both the driver and secondman were killed. The locomotive was withdrawn in September 1967.
* On 7 May 1965, a freight train was derailed at Preston-le-Skerne, County Durham. Locomotive No. D350 was hauling a newspaper train that ran into the derailed wagons and was itself derailed. Recovery of the locomotive was not until 16 May.
* On 14 August 1966, locomotive No. D311 was hauling a passenger train which was derailed when it ran into a landslip at Sanquhar, Dumfriesshire.
* On 31 July 1967, locomotive No. D283 was hauling a loaded Cliffe to Uddingston cement train at Thirsk in North Yorkshire. The train derailed with one wagon coming to rest around 2 feet foul of the adjacent down fast line. Moments later, experimental locomotive DP2, hauling a Scottish-bound express, collided with the wagon at around 50MPH. Seven people were killed and 45 injured. DP2 and the leading three coaches were destroyed.
* On 6 August 1975, locomotive No. 40 189 was hauling a freight train which was unable to stop due to a lack of brake power. It collided with another freight train at Weaver Junction, Cheshire.
* On 26 October 1975, an express passenger train failed at Lunan, Angus. Locomotive No. 40 111 was sent to its assistance but ran into the rear of the failed train at . One person was killed and eleven were injured.
* On 24 December 1977, 40 164 was in collision with coaches (due to form the 06:00 service to Mallaig) in platform 5 of Glasgow Queen Street Station. The driver had lost control of the locomotive on the 1 in 45 descending gradient in Queen Street Tunnel. The cause of the accident was identified at the subsequent inquiry to packing pieces not having been inserted into the brake system after the locomotive&#x27;s wheels had been profiled on the wheel lathe, reducing their diameter.
* In September 1978, locomotive No. 40 044 was hauling a freight train that ran away and was derailed by trap points at Chinley, Derbyshire.

===D326: The Great Train Robbery, 1963===

D326 (later 40 126) was the most famous Class 40, but for unfortunate reasons. The engine had an early chequered history. It was classed as a jinxed loco by some railwaymen, with some drivers being reluctant to drive it. In 1963 it was involved in the infamous &quot;Great Train Robbery&quot;, and a year later in August 1964 a secondman was electrocuted when washing the windows. Finally, in August 1965, it suffered total brake failure with a maintenance train at Birmingham New Street and hit the rear of a freight train, injuring the guard. It then settled down and had a normal life until it was scrapped in 1984.

40126 was withdrawn from service on 15 February 1984. Upon withdrawal the locomotive was offered to the National Railway Museum at York as an exhibit loco regarding its past history. However, the NRM declined and it was scrapped at Doncaster Works with indecent haste, no doubt to stop any pillaging souvenir hunters. Other famous &quot;40s&quot; include 40 106, which was the last one to remain in BR green livery, and 40 009, the last 40 to still have vacuum brakes only.

==In popular culture==
D318 (since preserved) appeared in the film &quot;Robbery&quot;, a fictionalised version of the Great Train Robbery.

==Preservation==
Seven locomotives and one cab end (40 088) have been preserved on heritage railways, including the first built, D200, and the departmental locomotives: 97406, 97407 and 97408. Not all locomotives may be carrying their names currently and these are noted in the chart below.

Of the seven class 40s to be preserved, all except for 40118 have run in preservation and three have run on the main line in preservation; these are D200 (40122), D213 (40013) and D345 (40145). As of 2018, D213 and D345 are operational on the main line.

One locomotive, 40013 &quot;Andania&quot;, was rescued from Vic Berry&#x27;s scrapyard in 1987. D212 &quot;Aureol&quot; was briefly sent to Vic Berry&#x27;s scrapyard for asbestos removal, before being moved to its new home at the Midland Railway Centre.
Note: Marked names indicate that the loco is not presently wearing them.

==Model railways==
There have been quite a few models of Class 40s over the years. In OO gauge, French manufacturer Jouef entered the UK OO gauge market with a Class 40 model in about 1977. This was available in blue or green, but only the disc headcode version was available; it was not a very accurate model, being overly wide. Next, Lima produced a much better Class 40 from 1988 and was available with all four types of nose styles. Bachmann produced a super-detailed Class 40 in the early 2000s, but this was criticised somewhat for poor shape in the cab window area. This was addressed by Bachmann later in production, when lighting was included and the drive was a true 1CO-CO1 arrangement. In 2023, Bachmann released a new tooled Class 40, including D213 &quot;Andania&quot;, which is presented in her current Main Line operating condition; BR Green livery with small yellow panels.

In 2010, Hornby Railways launched its first version of the BR Class 40 which was a remotored Lima model that Hornby had acquired, which is basic representation of the prototype as part of their Railroad range in BR Blue in OO gauge.

British N gauge models of the Class 40 have been produced by Graham Farish, representing the main three headcode versions. A BR Green version of D211 &quot;Mauretania&quot; received a positive review from The Railway Magazine Guide to Modelling in 2017.
