<text>In ufology, the psychosocial hypothesis, abbreviated PSH, argues that at least some UFO reports are best explained by psychological or social means. It is often contrasted with the better-known extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH), and is particularly popular among UFO researchers in the United Kingdom, such as David Clarke, Hilary Evans, the editors of &quot;Magonia&quot; magazine, and many of the contributors to &quot;Fortean Times&quot; magazine. It has also been popular in France since the publication in 1977 of a book written by Michel Monnerie, (&quot;What if UFOs do not exist?&quot;).

UFOlogists claim that the psychosocial hypothesis is occasionally confused with aggressive anti-ETH debunking, but that there is an important difference in that the PSH researcher sees UFOs as an &quot;interesting&quot; subject that is worthy of serious study, even if it is approached in a skeptical (i.e. non-credulous) way.

The psychosocial hypothesis builds on the finding that most ufo reports have mundane explanations like celestial objects, airplane lights, balloons, and a host of other misperceived things seen in the sky which suggests the presence of an unusual emotional climate which distorts perceptions and the perceived significance and anomalousness of merely terrestrial stimuli. In the more exotic situation where people claim direct contact with extraterrestrials, the need for a psychosocial approach seems obligated by the presence of at least 70 claims of people meeting Venusians and at least 50 claims of meeting Martians; both worlds now known to be uninhabitable and devoid of any advanced civilization. Hoaxing seems to explain some of these contactees claims, but visionary dreams, hallucinations, and other mental processes are clearly implicated in such myth-based material. By generalization, the other material suggesting the presence of extraterrestrial entities from elsewhere is hypothesized to be explainable by similar means. The observed presence of surreal dream-like activity and imagery or themes based in the cultural environment and historically understood sources reinforces the proposition that the extraterrestrial hypothesis is unnecessary and, by Occam&#x27;s razor, probably incorrect.

==Origin==

In the English UFO literature, the term psycho-social hypothesis first achieved prominence in April 1984 when the cover of &quot;Magonia&quot; featured &quot;The Rise of the Psycho-social hypothesis&quot; by Jacques Scornaux and Peter Rogerson. Scornaux&#x27;s use of the term traces back to French UFO controversies spawned by Michel Monnerie whose book (1979) presented &quot;&quot; as a direct challenge to the extraterrestrial hypothesis. Claude Maugé had exposed &quot;Magonia&quot; readers to a brief outline of &quot;the socio-psychological model&quot; emerging from French studies in 1983, but flipping the syllables made the term more conventional to existing academic vocabulary. Rogerson&#x27;s adopting the term represented to him an evolution and de-escalation of exotic hypotheses he had been entertaining that originally included paranormal notions like psi, collective hallucinations, and the collective unconscious. The term marked the embrace of a fully normal system of psychological processes that included dreams, hallucinations, fantasy interpretations of materially real stimuli, distortions of perception, and metachoric experiences. These were things influenced by cultural myths, social conditioning, and historical context. Since 1968, the circle of writers who wrote for &quot;Magonia&quot; had been exploring alternatives to the ETH under a general sense that it had failed to account for much of what was being seen in the high strangeness cases. Roger Sandell spoke of being a nuts and bolts ufologist until he realized that the UFO reports he had gathered from a 1905 Welsh wave made little sense and were part of a larger complex of ghost stories and religious visions. He notes that ufological thought had once been dominated by theories that Venus and Mars were the source of ufos, but the space program had shown they were in fact quite lifeless. Add in the apocalyptic and demonological material of then contemporary ufo thinking and the need for a major re-think seemed obliged. Could it all be mundane products of the human mind such as dreams, rumors and hoaxes? Peter Rogerson had similarly become convinced we are seeing the rise of a contemporary mythology and advocated for a comprehensive search for historical antecedents of ufo rumors. He began the search for the social factors driving ufo flaps and social panics. Magonia writers would point to &quot;a relationship between ufo waves and times of radical social change&quot; with Rogerson offering that the 1954 French flap had occurred at &quot;a time of national defeat and government crisis.&quot; In one striking piece, he offered a lengthy meditation on the social resonances and ideological influences shaping the varying beliefs found among ufo writers over the course of ufo history.

==Science fiction aspects of the UFO mythos==

Bertrand Méheust, a French sociologist, began a study of the science fiction parallels to ufo mythology when he stumbled upon a copy of the 1908 novel &quot;The Lightning Wheel&quot; by Jean de la Hire in his family&#x27;s attic. He opened it and began reading how the central characters find themselves being lifted up by a ray into a flying disc that hums and glows with a halo of light. The discovery stimulated a search for parallels between ufo experience narratives and pre-1947 science fiction literature. Meheust found dozens of them, many of the more impressive including such wondrous effects as invisible force-fields, mesmeric mental effects, materializations and dematerializations, teleportation, traveling through walls, levitating entities, and engine-stopping rays. One could also find humanoids visiting earth for a range of motives that parallel later UFO thought: wanting to spy on humans, experiment on us, breed with us, create a multi-generational program to shape humanity, deal with their dying world, invade our world, and teach us lessons about cosmic history and the need for peace. While some of this can be relegated to coincidences driven by similar reasoning and expectations about the future, often these wonders are more reminiscent of supernatural and old occult mythology than what is really reasonably expected to be created using future technology. Michel Monnerie wove Meheust&#x27;s study into his larger historical critique of what shaped ufo mythology. Michel Meurger deserves special mention for expanding Meheust&#x27;s thesis into an impressive compendium of parallels brimming with nearly 800 footnotes and a set of dozens of illustrations. One subsequent paper, in English, presents a focused historical study, showing a continuum between the nightmarish medical horrors experienced in modern ufo abduction narratives, back through the mad scientists of pulp science fiction, that built in turn upon anti-vivisection propaganda and rumors circulating in the 19th century.

Jacques Vallee was among the first ufologists to note that electromagnetic effects associated with ufos could be found in earlier fiction such as a play written by Arthur Koestler and the first flying saucer novel – Bernard Newman&#x27;s &quot;The Flying Saucer&quot; (1948). This observation has been expanded in one study published in &quot;Magonia&quot; that traces a continuum of anti-machine machines back through wartime rumors about Marconi developing engine-stopping rays and a sizeable culture backdrop of films, film serials, and pulp stories imagining future wars and the superweapons that would fight them.

Meheust saw early on that the more common species of aliens in ufo experiences were well represented in the Hugo Gernsback era (1926–1936) pulps. This insight has been followed up in increasing detail by subsequent researchers. Grays, in particular, are now well understood as having been a stereotype in large part because Gernsback specifically asked his writers to do stories where future evolution caused beings to develop large brains but atrophied bodies caused by technology making muscles irrelevant to survival. Gernsback loved H.G. Wells&#x27;s writings, reprinted his work, and it was Wells who first developed the logic of such degenerative evolution which he inserted into his masterwork &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; (1898). Important modifications to the stereotype were introduced by the creative team that built the aliens appearing at the climax of Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (1977). Completely black eyes and thin pencil necks soon appeared on bald brainy aliens in ufo encounters in mimicry of film imagery. While the public was given the impression that the aliens would be based on those found in ufo investigations; the CE3K alien design team had never been given drawings to base their work on. They were only given a brief verbal directive that they should be large-headed and short.

Some work has also been done on the cultural back-stories to insectoids, reptoids, and some lesser horror clichés. Even precursors to alien fashions have been looked into in a light-spirited manner.

A number of other pieces in this tradition explore such science fictional saucer esoterica as doorway amnesia, miraculous ascension by lifting light, the physics of travelling through walls, magnetic propulsion, and aliens taking nutrition through the skin along psychosocial and historical lines.

==The saucer rumor==

Arguably the most far-reaching and surprising mystery solved by psychosocial research was the puzzle posed by J. Allen Hynek in 1977: &quot;Why flying saucers? Why not flying cubes or flying pyramids, or for that matter, why not flying pink elephants or even flying buildings, reported from a hundred different countries? Indeed if UFO reports were entirely the result of excited imaginations, why not hundreds, possibly thousands, of totally and radically different types of reports as people of different cultures let their locally conditioned imaginations loose?&quot; In 1988, Martin Kottmeyer observed a colleague trying to speculate that the source of saucer imagery lay in a certain art movement. While the notion immediately struck him as wrong, he began to think about what might be a better approach. He soon began gathering together what writings he could find about the Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting in 1947, typically pointed to as the start of the modern ufo phenomenon. One of the first things he turned to was a memoir given as a speech before the First International UFO Congress in 1977. His eye soon fell on a statement by Arnold that the objects he sighted &quot;were not circular&quot;. Arnold also complained the flying saucer label arose because of a &quot;great deal of misunderstanding&quot; on the part of the reporter who wrote the story up for the Associated Press. Bill Bequette asked him how the objects flew and Arnold answered that, &quot;Well, they flew erratic, like a saucer if you skip it across the water.&quot; The intent of the metaphor was to describe the motion of the objects not their shape. Bill Bequette would later insist the fault was not with him, but Arnold himself but, ultimately it does not matter who is to blame for it. The only salient fact is that a mistake was definitely made somewhere. Any doubt about this is eliminated by turning to the first document written by Kenneth Arnold, the report he wrote and sent to Air Force mere days after his sighting nine mystery objects speeding across the face of Mount Rainier. It includes a drawing of the shapes made by one of the objects. It certainly confirms the memoir. It isn&#x27;t circular or round as a saucer properly ought to be. Shoe heel or beetle might better express the awkwardly inelegant form.

The logical implications of saucers being a mistake had the feel of a paradigm shift- to Kottmeyer, like suddenly learning that one of the axioms one learned in school forming the base of Euclidean geometric reasoning had just changed. One was not living in a Euclidean universe, but a Riemannian one where a straight line was no longer the shortest distance between two points. All those people in 1947 who reported seeing circular, disc-shaped, saucer-shaped crafts (82% of the 853 cases collected by Ted Bloecher) had based their expectations on a mistake, a rumor with journalistic credentials. They weren&#x27;t seeing what Arnold saw, only what they were told he saw. Similarly the rumor shaped the ufo phenomenon for decades afterwards keeping the shape dominant throughout the culture, shaping film imagery, saucer photography, ufo illustration, contactee tales, and high strangeness abduction experiences. By one tally 82% of the craft descriptions in alien abduction reports fall into the flying saucer category. It can be found in nearly all the well-known cases: Betty &amp; Barney Hill&#x27;s interrupted journey, Herb Schirmer, Travis Walton, the Andreasson affair, Whitley Strieber

Kottmeyer first reported his discovery in a letter to &quot;Saucer Smear&quot; published April 25, 1988. It was more widely disseminated when the finding was published as part of an article titled &quot;Entirely Unpredisposed&quot; that appeared first in &quot;Magonia&quot; in 1990. There he spelled out its full argumentative significance: &quot;The implications of this journalistic error are staggering in the extreme. Not only does it unambiguously point to a cultural origin of the whole flying saucer phenomenon, it erects a first-order paradox into any attempt to interpret the phenomenon in extraterrestrial terms: Why would extraterrestrials redesign their craft to conform to Bequette&#x27;s error?&quot; In 1993, he offered a fuller account of the significance of the finding in a piece titled &quot;The Saucer Error&quot;. Some ETH skeptics embraced Kottmeyer&#x27;s arguments and tried to expand it with additional material concerning Arnold&#x27;s writings. The cover of Arnold&#x27;s 1950 memoir of the 1947 incident &quot;The Saucer As I Saw It&quot; has been pointed to as showing a more crescent-shaped craft than that drawn in the AF report. A photo of Arnold holding a sketch showing yet another subtly different shape has also been pointed to as significant. While not uninteresting flourishes to the story, one should not ignore that historical investigation always privileges the earliest documents of a case and those generated by the witness over later and second-hand journalistic quotes. Late images and writings are vulnerable to a range of doubts concerning both memory and distortions arising from revisions shaped by late arriving issues and fluid fashions of interpretation, reason enough to ignore them.

The principal counterargument advanced to save the ETH is that flying saucers were seen before Kenneth Arnold&#x27;s story hit the headlines and those could not have been shaped by the rumor. Many of these reports were never published, let alone investigated, before Arnold became news and so are vulnerable to errors of memory and suggestion. Even if any are eventually found with a satisfactory pedigree, the argument overlooks that Hynek and Jacobs only offered the questions they did because saucers are the dominant shape of ufos after 1947. No amount of research is ever go change the fact that saucers make up only a trivial percentage of things seen in the sky before 1947 and will never be proven to be dominant. The fallacy of this approach is demonstrated by imagining what a Hynek-like thinker, immersed in the reports of the airship era (1896/7), asked and answered, &quot;Why cigar-shaped and not globes or cubes?&quot; and &quot;then&quot; was told that reports of a slow, low-flying cigar-shaped object in 1347 A.D. meant he had not found the source of the problem. He would clearly dismiss the report as irrelevant – the implicit issue is explaining the dominance of the shape. The rumor generated by Arnold&#x27;s report is the clear answer to Hynek&#x27;s question, regardless of minor cases that were exceptions to the dominants of their own era.

==Flaps of flying phantoms==

In the first couple decades of the saucer controversy, several researchers sought to argue that flaps were generated by saucers timing their arrival to the proximity of Mars. Predictions were generated, but notably failed. One 1962 study remarked, &quot;If one works with data limited to the period 1950 to 1956 one can argue a correlation as strong as one in a thousand against chance existed.&quot; Outside this limited set, however, it is clear no correlation can be found. Charles H. Smiley, Chairman of the Department of Astronomy at Brown University computed 14 ideal minimum energy orbits for transportation from Mars to Earth and Venus to Earth between 1956 and 1965 and determined the likely arrival times plus and minus ten days. He then looked at the number of ufo reports to Blue Book for these periods. They were self-evidently insignificant and corresponded to no flaps. Other researchers argued flaps were indications of phased operations, indications of the construction of bases, or ways of desensitizing humanity to the extraterrestrial presence before overt Contact or a Mass Landing, which would culminate in the imminent future. These predictions clearly failed as well.

British researchers, puzzled by the failures decided to take things in new directions: Peter Rogerson would write, &quot;There should be a major co-operative effort at a systematic search for pre-1947 &#x27;waves,&#x27; involving, if possible, full scrutiny of national and local newspapers, and scientific and popular magazines, starting with flap periods, then other periods.&quot; Attention should be paid to &quot;the social, religious, political and scientific background.&quot; Roger Sandell&#x27;s work on a 1905 outbreak of ufo sighting in Wales had already suggested that these earlier flaps had odd facets, some of the high strangeness material echoed modern cases, but not in the ways might hope if one thought them extraterrestrial. Mary Jones encountered a sinister black clad man she identified as Satan, but would probably thought an MIB had it not been 1905 Wales. Other Men in Black were seen and one figure turned into a black dog before one witness&#x27;s eyes. Noting such things only add to the complexity of the ufo phenomenon he urged progress could only be made by detailed research conducted with no preconceptions.

Nigel Watson, in time, began reporting on his research into a March–May 1909 panic involving the belief that German airships were spying on Britain. Phantom airship flaps would eventually be catalogued from a diverse set of places like New Zealand in 1909, Russia &amp; Poland in 1892, Canada in 1896, Washington state in 1908, Denmark in 1908, South Africa in 1914, and Norway in 1914-16. These flaps generally involved cigar-shaped craft more reminiscent of Zeppelins than extraterrestrial spacecraft and were attended by rumors of foreign spies and spy networks. They often had their own forms of physical evidences, multiple witnesses to crafts with improbable details, and surreal close encounters. The rumors all had idiosyncratic aspects which pointed to a need to interpret them in terms of the contemporary societal backdrop – often tensions about impending war, sometimes political conflicts within the society. 
By the 1930s, the imagery of phantom airships was replaced by phantom aeroplanes – &#x27;ghost fliers&#x27; in places including Scandinavia and Britain. Later phantom flier imagery transmutes into Foo-fighters and ghost rockets, in accordance with new rumors and newer facts of evolving modern technology.

One researcher would point out that a mid-1600s boom in prophecies accompanied rumors of the imminent overthrow of King and Church. The aligning of aerial phenomena and political events had been alleged as early as John Aubrey, the antiquary, concerning events in 1647. A series of sightings of second suns, second moons, and marching of armies in the sky, it was assumed significantly, preceded the 1662 Act of Uniformity and the revival of the Church of England.

In the spirit of being engaged in &quot;a long, slow process of trial &amp; error studies&quot;, variations in these explanations have been experimented with. The 1905 Wales flap occurred at a time that the traditional values were under assault from the modern world. The religious revival associated with the sightings maybe were generated by the tensions of rapid, unprecedented social change. Psychosocial researchers have looked into other notions like Phil Klass&#x27;s notion that media is the primary driver of flaps but they find it so scandalously error-riddled, it is difficult to accept it has anything like the sizeable role he alleges. Media doubtless contributes imagery, but the emotional component of the rumors associated with flaps relies on larger aspects of the social environment.
researchers in the psychosocial tradition generally do not accept explanations involving mass hysteria e.g. as when expressed back in 1954 by the French psychiatrist George Heuyer. By the time they were writing, doubts had already been expressed. Mark Rhine in the Condon report and Robert Hall for the 1969 AAAS symposium on UFOs looked at certain classic episodes of mass hysteria or hysterical contagion like the June bug epidemic, the Seattle windshield pitting epidemic, and the Mad Gasser of Mattoon, to see how well they could serve as explanatory models for what is going on with the ufo phenomenon. Neither developed the idea very far and Hall discerned several difficulties in comparing these phenomena, probably the most notable being the fleeting character of those model social epidemics. Michael Swords later offered additional observations that essentially killed it for researchers on both sides of the debate. In a recent discussion of Great Britain&#x27;s Warminster flap of the 1960s, the researchers echo these developments and prefer to discuss the flap as a collective delusion maintained by rumor and gossip.

==The &quot;Modern Myth&quot; of Jung==

With his essay &quot;Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies&quot; (1958), Carl Gustav Jung can be seen as one of the founding fathers of the PSH. Some also say that because of his use of the concept of synchronicity in this book, he is also one of the founding fathers of paranormal explanations of the UFO phenomena. ETH advocates sometimes say that while Jung approached UFOs psychologically because he was a psychologist, he was also on record as stating that some might be true physical objects under intelligent control, citing in particular radar corroboration. They say Jung truly seriously considered the Extraterrestrial Hypothesis. The Associated Press quoted him in 1958 saying, &quot;a purely psychological explanation is ruled out.&quot; The flying saucers were real and &quot;show signs of intelligent guidance and quasi-human pilots. I can only say for certain that these things are not a mere rumor, something has been seen. ...If the extraterrestrial origin of these phenomena should be confirmed, this would prove the existence of an intelligent interplanetary relationship. ... That the construction of these machines proves a scientific technique immensely superior to ours cannot be disputed.&quot; Disciples of Jung have offered thoughtful rebuttals.

Jung risibly complained about that 1958 newspaper piece for making him look like someone who believed UFOs were physically real. &quot;This report is altogether false.&quot; Jung was completely uncommitted on the issue of whether they were real or unreal. He tried to set the record straight. &quot;I was quoted as a saucer believer. I issued a statement to the United Press and gave a true version of my opinion, but this time the wire went dead: nobody, so far as I know, took any notice of it, except one German newspaper... one must draw the conclusion that news affirming the existence of Ufos is welcome, but that skepticism seems to be undesirable. To believe that Ufos are real suits the general opinion, whereas disbelief is to be discouraged... This remarkable fact in itself surely merits the psychologist&#x27;s interest.&quot;

<doc id="824284" wikidata="Q3048328" url="?curid=824284" title="Saulė">
<text>Saulė (, ) is a solar goddess, the common Baltic solar deity in the Lithuanian and Latvian mythologies. The noun &quot;Saulė&quot;/&quot;Saule&quot; in the Lithuanian and Latvian languages is also the conventional name for the Sun and originates from the Proto-Baltic name *&quot;Sauliā&quot; &gt; *&quot;Saulē&quot;.

==Representation==
Saulė is one of the most powerful deities, the goddess of the sun itself, responsible for all life on Earth. She is the patroness of the unfortunate, especially orphans. The Lithuanian and Latvian words for &quot;the world&quot; (&quot;pasaulis&quot; and &quot;pasaule&quot;) are translated as &quot;[a place] under the Sun&quot;.

Saulė is mentioned in one of the earliest written sources on Lithuanian mythology. According to the Slavic translation of the Chronicle by John Malalas (1261), a smith named Teliavelis made the Sun and threw it into the sky. Missionary Jerome of Prague (ca. 1369–1440) spent three years attempting to Christianize Lithuania and later recounted a myth about the kidnapped Saulė. She was held in a tower by a powerful king and rescued by the zodiac (&quot;Signa Zodiaci&quot;) using a giant sledgehammer. Jerome swore that he personally witnessed the hammer, venerated by the locals.

==Family==

Saulė and Mėnuo/Mēness (the Moon) were wife and husband. Mėnuo fell in love with Aušrinė (the morning star or Venus). For his infidelity, Perkūnas (thunder god) punished Mėnuo. There are different accounts of the punishment. One version has it that Mėnuo was cut into two pieces, but he did not learn from his mistakes and thus the punishment is repeated every month. Another version claims that Mėnuo and Saulė divorced, but both wanted to see their daughter Žemyna (earth). That is why the Sun shines during the day, while the Moon visits at night. A third version claims that the face of Mėnuo was disfigured by either Dievas (the supreme god) or Saulė.

In other myths, Aušrinė is depicted as a daughter and servant of Saulė. Aušrinė lights the fire for Saulė and makes her ready for another day&#x27;s journey across the sky. Vakarinė (the evening star) makes the bed for Saulė in the evening. In the Lithuanian mythology, Saulė was mother of other planets: Indraja (Jupiter), Sėlija (Saturn), Žiezdrė (Mars), Vaivora (Mercury).

==Feasts==
Saulė&#x27;s feast was celebrated during the summer solstice. Lithuanian Rasos (turned into Saint Jonas&#x27; Festival by Christianity) and Latvian Līgo (turned into Jāņi) involve making wreaths, looking for the magical fern flower, burning bonfires, dancing around and leaping over the fire, and greeting the Sun when it rises at around 4 am next morning. It is the most joyous traditional holiday. The winter solstice is celebrated as the return of Saulė. Christianity absorbed Lithuanian Kūčios and Latvian Ziemassvētki into Christmas. Other celebrations took place around the equinoxes.

== Mythology ==
=== Colors ===
In Latvian folk songs, Saule and her daughter(s) are dressed of shawls woven with gold thread and Saule wears shoes of gold. She is also depicted in a silver, gold or silk costume and wearing a sparkling crown.

She is sometimes portrayed as waking up &quot;red&quot; (&quot;sārta&quot;) or &quot;in a red tree&quot; during the morning. Saule is also said to own golden tools and garments: slippers, scarf, belt, and a golden boat she uses as her means of transportation. Other accounts ascribe her golden rings, golden ribbons, golden tassels, and even a golden crown.

Saule is also described as being dressed in clothes woven with &quot;threads of red, gold, silver and white&quot;. In the Lithuanian tradition, the sun is also described as a &quot;golden wheel&quot; or a &quot;golden circle&quot; that rolls down the mountain at sunset. Also in Latvian riddles and songs, Saule is associated with the color red as if to indicate the &quot;fiery aspect&quot; of the sun: the setting and the rising sun are equated with a rose wreath and a rose in bloom due to their circular shapes.

=== Movements ===
Saulė is portrayed dancing in her gilded shoes on a silver hill and her fellow Baltic goddess Aušrinė is said to dance on a stone for the people on the first day of summer. In Lithuania, the Sun (identified as female) rides a car towards her husband, the Moon, &quot;dancing and emitting fiery sparks&quot; on the way.

=== Dwelling ===
In a myth from Lithuania, a man named Joseph becomes fascinated with Aušrinė appearing in the sky and goes on a quest to find the &quot;second sun&quot;, who is actually a maiden that lives on an island in the sea and has the same hair like the Sun. In the Baltic folklore, Saulė is said to live in a silver gated castle at the end of the sea, located somewhere in the east, or to go to an island in the middle of the sea for her nocturnal rest. In folksongs, Saule sinks into the bottom of a lake to sleep at night, in a silver cradle &quot;in the white seafoam&quot;.

=== Vehicle ===
The Sun, which has a feminine gender in Baltic languages, is described as an anthromorphized being that rides across the celestial abode in a vehicle, like a carriage or a chariot, which is described as &quot;saulės ratai&quot; in Lithuanian and &quot;saules rati&quot; in Latvian. 

Saulė also drives a carriage with copper wheels, a &quot;gleaming copper chariot&quot; or a golden chariot pulled by untiring horses or a &quot;pretty little sleigh&quot; (&quot;kamaņiņa&quot;) made of fish-bones. Saulė is also described as driving her shining car on the way to her husband, the Moon. In other accounts, she is said to sail the seas on a silver or a golden boat, which, according to legend, is what her chariot transforms into for her night travels. In a Latvian folksong, Saule hangs her sparkling crown on a tree in the evening and enters a golden boat to sail away.

=== Horses ===
The Sun is associated with horses in Baltic mythology: Lithuanian riddles describe the Sun as a ball with a hundred horses (&quot;šimtas arklių nepavež&quot;) - an image repeated in Latvian songs (&quot;Simts kumeliņu&quot;). 

Saulė&#x27;s horses are also mentioned in several pieces of Baltic folklore. Her horses are said to be of white color; in other accounts they amount to three steeds of golden, silver and diamond colors. In Latvian &quot;dainas&quot; (folk songs), her horses are described as yellow, of a golden or a fiery color. The sun&#x27;s steeds are also portrayed as having hooves and bridles of gold in the &quot;dainas&quot;, and as golden beings themselves or of a bay colour, &quot;reflect[ing] the hues of the bright or the twilight sky&quot;. When she begins her nocturnal journey through the World Sea, her chariot changes into a boat and &quot;the Sun swims her horses&quot;, which signifies that &quot;she stops to wash her horses in the sea&quot;.

Scholarship points that the expressions &quot;geltoni žirgeliai&quot; or &quot;dzelteni kumeliņi&quot; (&#x27;golden&#x27; or &#x27;yellow horses&#x27;), which appear in Latvian &quot;dainas&quot;, seem to be a recurrent poetic motif. According to Nijole Laurinkiene, the expression could refer to a golden or fiery character to the animals.

===Other depictions===
According to studies by professor Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga and ethnologue , Saule is also depicted in folksongs as a &quot;mother&quot; (Lithuanian &quot;motinėlė&quot;, Latvian &quot;māmuliņa&quot;) who comforts orphans, which is the reason why the sun takes time to rise. In other folksongs, the personified female Sun is also associated with the color &quot;white&quot; (Latv &quot;balt-&quot;), such as the imagery of a white shirt, the expression &quot;mīļā, balte&quot; (&quot;Sun, dear, white&quot;), and the description of the trajectory of the sun (red as it rises, white as it journeys on its way).

<text>Jean-Baptiste Regnault (; 9 October 1754 – 12 November 1829) was a French painter.

==Biography==
Regnault was born in Paris, and began life at sea in a merchant vessel. At the age of fifteen his talent attracted attention, and he was sent to Italy by M. de Monval under the care of Jean Bardin. After his return to Paris in 1776, Regnault won the Prix de Rome for his painting &quot;Alexandre and Diogène&quot; and in 1783 he was elected to the French . His diploma picture, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Education of Achilles by Chiron the Centaur&quot; is now in the Louvre, as also are his &quot;Trois Grâces, Le Déluge, Descente de croix (Christ taken down from the Cross,&quot; originally executed for the royal chapel at Fontainebleau) and &quot;Socrate arrachant Alcibiade du sein de la Volupté.&quot; His &quot;L&#x27;origine de la peinture&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;origine de la sculpture, ou Pygmalion amoureux de sa statue&quot; are now at the Palace of Versailles.

He was the author of many large historical paintings, especially of allegorical subjects. His school, which reckoned amongst its attendants Pierre-Narcisse Guérin, Louis-Philippe Crépin, Louis Lafitte, Merry-Joseph Blondel, Robert Lefèvre, Henriette Lorimier and Alexandre Menjaud, was for a long while the rival in influence of that of David. Besides Blondel, Guérin, Lefèvre and Lorimier, Regnault&#x27;s students included Godefroy Engelmann, Louis Hersent, Charles Paul Landon, Hippolyte Lecomte, Jacques Réattu, Jean-Hilaire Belloc and Anne Nicole Voullemier.

Regnault was married first to Sophie Meyer, then Sophie Félicité Beaucourt. He died in Paris. He is buried in Père-Lachaise Cemetery.

<doc id="824312" wikidata="Q2111298" url="?curid=824312" title="Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution">
<text>&quot;Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution&quot; is a 1973 essay by the evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky, criticising anti-evolution creationism and espousing theistic evolution. The essay was first published in &quot;American Biology Teacher&quot; in 1973.

Dobzhansky first used the title statement, in a slight variation, in a 1964 presidential address to the American Society of Zoologists, &quot;Biology, Molecular and Organismic&quot;, to assert the importance of organismic biology in response to the challenge of the rising field of molecular biology. The term &quot;light of evolution&quot;—or &quot;sub specie evolutionis&quot;—had been used earlier by the Jesuit priest and paleontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and then by the biologist Julian Huxley.

== Overview ==
Dobzhansky opens with a critique of Shaikh Abdul Aziz bin Baz, who later became Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, for holding a belief based on scripture that the Sun revolves around the Earth. Dobzhansky asserts that &quot;it is ludicrous to mistake the Bible and the Koran for primers of natural science. They treat of matters even more important: the meaning of man and his relations to God.&quot; He then criticizes the early English antievolutionist Philip Henry Gosse—who had proposed that fossils were created in the places where they were found—for blasphemously implying that God is deceitful.

As he had said in his earlier presidential address, &quot;If the living world has not arisen from common ancestors by means of an evolutionary process, then the fundamental unity of living things is a hoax and their diversity is a joke.&quot; These two themes of the unity of living things and the diversity of life provide central themes for his essay.

Addressing the diversity of life on Earth, Dobzhansky asks whether God was joking when he created different species for different environments. This diversity becomes reasonable and understandable, however, if Creation takes place not by the whim of the Creator &quot;but by evolution propelled by natural selection.&quot; He further illustrates this diversity from his own investigation of the widely diverse range of species of fruit flies in Hawaii. Either the Creator, &quot;in a fit of absent mindedness,&quot; created many species of fruit flies in Hawaii, or the fruit flies that arrived on the islands, diversified to fill a wide range of vacant ecological niches.

He illustrates the unity of living things using the molecular sequence of cytochrome C, which Emanuel Margoliash and Walter M. Fitch had shown to be similar in a wide range of species, including monkeys, tuna, kangaroos, and yeast. This unity is further illustrated by the similarity of the embryos of different species. Either God deliberately arranged things &quot;to mislead sincere seekers of truth&quot; or these similarities are the result of evolution.

Dobzhansky concludes that scripture and science are two different things: &quot;It is a blunder to mistake the Holy Scriptures for elementary textbooks of astronomy, geology, biology, and anthropology.&quot;

One response to this paper was a paper by Stephen Dilley, &quot;Nothing in biology makes sense except in light of theology?&quot;. This argued that Dobzhansky&#x27;s arguments all &quot;hinge[d] upon sectarian claims about God’s nature, actions, purposes, or duties&quot;—claims that in Dilley&#x27;s view required more justification and appeared mutually incompatible.

== The underlying theme ==
The underlying theme of the essay is the need to teach biological evolution in the context of debate about creation and evolution in public education in the United States. The fact that evolution occurs explains the interrelatedness of the various facts of biology, and so makes biology make sense. The concept has become firmly established as a unifying idea in biology education.

== The phrase ==
The notion of the &quot;light of evolution&quot; came originally from the vitalist Jesuit priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, whom Dobzhansky much admired. In the last paragraph of the article, Dobzhansky quotes from de Chardin&#x27;s 1955 &quot;The Phenomenon of Man&quot;:
:(Evolution) general condition to which all theories, all hypotheses, all systems must bow and which they must satisfy henceforward if they are to be thinkable and true. Evolution is a light which illuminates all facts, a curve that all lines must follow. (p. 219 of &quot;The Phenomenon of Man&quot;)

The phrase &quot;nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution&quot; has come into common use by those opposing creationism or its variant called intelligent design. While the essay argues (following de Chardin) that Christianity and evolutionary biology are compatible, a position described as &quot;evolutionary creation&quot; or &quot;theistic evolution&quot;, the phrase is also used by those who consider that &quot;in biology&quot; includes anthropology, and those who consider a creator to be unnecessary, such as Richard Dawkins who published &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; just three years later.

<text>Nils Schumann (; born 20 May 1978) is a former German athlete, winner of the 800 m at the 2000 Summer Olympics, who retired in 2009. For most of the five years before his retirement he had featured sparingly at an international level due to injuries.

Schumann, born in Bad Frankenhausen, began his career as a footballer in 1984 before switching to athletics. He won a gold medal over 800 m at the 1998 European Athletics Indoor Championships in Valencia. At the European Championships in Budapest in the same year, he won the title in a close finish. A few weeks later he also won the 800 m race at the World Cup in Johannesburg.

He also made the final of the 1999 World Athletics Championships, but placed 8th and last. He had a quiet 2000 season, until the Olympics started in Sydney. Schumann cruised through the preliminaries, easily qualifying for the final. In the final, Schumann set in his final sprint at the last straight, taking the lead with just 50 m to go. Favourite Wilson Kipketer of Denmark gained in the closing meters, but was unable to prevent a surprise victory by the German runner. In the following year, Schumann finished in fifth place at the 2001 World Championships in Athletics in Edmonton.

Schumann, who also won a bronze medal at the 2002 European Championships, was unable to defend his Olympic title at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, suffering from injury throughout the 2004 season.

==Competition record==
==Beyond retirement==
On 3 March 2008 Schumann married the 400 meter runner Korinna Fink. That was the year in which he set up his own business: he also advertises his services as a personal trainer, based in Erfurt.

<text>Glory Season is a 1993 science fiction novel by David Brin. It was nominated for both the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1994. An announcement in the back of one edition of &quot;Earth&quot; is for a novel titled &quot;Stratos&quot;, to be released in the spring of 1992. It seems likely that this was delayed, and renamed &quot;Glory Season&quot;.

==Plot summary==

Three thousand years before the story starts, Lysos founds a human colony on the isolated planet of Stratos in an effort to radically re-engineer human life into a happier, more pastoral form. She developed a strain of human beings that conceives clones in winter (always female), while those conceived in summer (variants or &quot;vars&quot;) obtain their genes through sexual reproduction just in case biological adaptation becomes necessary. Further, males and females have opposed seasons of sexual receptivity: men in summer and women in winter. This scheme is said to be stable over evolutionary time because women gain an advantage from self-cloning, while men only reproduce in summer. Finally, men have been made far less aggressive during the times that they are less sexually receptive and are much less numerous. The social result is that the vast majority of the population of Stratos consists of groups of female clones, each in its own social or economic niche. Over the centuries, these groups have come to dominate society. Men are confined to relatively few professions (such as sailing) and have a lower social status than clones, but higher than vars. In each generation, a few women vars become successful enough to found their own clan or &quot;hive&quot; of clones.

As is customary, clones are trained to carry on their clan&#x27;s business, while vars leave as young adults to seek their fortune. It is time for identical twins Maia and Leie to enter the outside world. They plan to work as sailors to gain experience and explore Stratos, find their niche, and found a clan. Almost immediately, they hit a snag. The only two ship&#x27;s captains willing to take them on at that time insist they split up, because they cannot have it appear to their clone passengers that clones are doing lowly ship&#x27;s work. The ships are traveling together. Aboard, Maia meets Naroin, a highly competent female bosun&#x27;s mate. Later, Leie&#x27;s ship is lost in a storm. Maia is heartbroken and seriously injured, but eventually recuperates and finds a job on a railroad.

On the railroad, Maia discovers her var temporary assistant is actually a clone courier and courtesan running illegal drugs. The drugs are designed to shift a man&#x27;s period of sexual interest. They are part of a plot by reactionary &quot;Perkinites&quot; (named after Charlotte Perkins Gilman, author of &quot;Herland&quot;) to minimize the role of men in an isolated valley, and perhaps later all of Stratos.

Maia notifies the &quot;Planetary Equilibrium Authority&quot;, but is kidnapped and imprisoned by the Perkinites. She discovers that Renna, a prisoner in another cell, is transmitting messages electrically. She talks with Renna by code and develops a friendship with her unseen fellow inmate. When she discovers that Renna is being transferred somewhere else, Maia engineers her escape, only to find that idealistic radicals (&quot;rads&quot;) and their allies have already freed Renna, who is actually the &quot;Visitor,&quot; a &quot;male&quot; envoy from the rest of humanity whose arrival has triggered great debate among the leaders of Stratos as to how to respond to the renewed - and unwanted - contact. She tags along with Renna and the rads.

A platonic friendship develops between Renna and Maia. Their group, which includes Naroin, is later overtaken at sea by pirates (pirating being a tolerated, legal activity). During the ensuing boarding fight, Maia is shocked when she encounters her sister, one of the pirates. The pirates win, with the help of traitors planted in the rads&#x27; group. They strand many of their female prisoners, including Maia and Naroin, and one young male sailor named Brod on a deserted island and take Renna, their prize, to a secret base.

After the castaways manage to ambush pirates sent to eliminate all witnesses, they sail off to alert the authorities, but Maia, accompanied only by Brod, sets out to try to rescue Renna. They inadvertently stumble upon the pirate base. While secretly reconnoitering it, Maia helps free more prisoners, including the rads and the crew of her ship. She also learns that Renna has somehow escaped. More fighting breaks out when their enemies learn the rest of their prisoners are loose. In the turmoil, Maia and her allies are cornered, but she finds a secret exit which leads to the long-lost &quot;Jellicoe Former&quot;, an advanced manufacturing facility that can produce anything. Renna is killed when the spaceship he found and completed at Jellicoe Former explodes soon after its launch. Maia is severely injured in the battle. The police and other interested parties arrive to save the survivors of Maia&#x27;s side.

While recuperating, Maia is dragged into politics and kept a prisoner discreetly by one clan because she has become a symbol. She tells her story to a group of male heads of sailing clans. One of them turns out to be the father she had never known. For her actions, they offer her &quot;clan&quot; an alliance. At the end, with Renna dead, Maia becomes an embarrassment to her captors, so she is allowed to walk away free. She decides that she will not found a clan of clones, but rather have offspring the old way.

==Major themes==
The nature of the novel is a subject of some contention, some believing that the setting is a feminist utopia, others holding it to be a dystopian work functioning as a post-feminist critique of feminism. The structure of the society is complex enough to make either interpretation possible, though the society&#x27;s origin and structure is based on an extreme of separatist feminism. Also, the structure of the society as seen within the narrative supports the view of biological determinism when it comes to the relationship between genetics and gender roles.

The author, in the novel&#x27;s afterword, explains that the idea for the society in which the story takes place originated from a study of reproductive cycle of aphids, which is heterogamous. Aphids alternate between asexual reproduction in the summer, i.e., when the environment is favorable and there is plenty of food, and sexually in the fall when the organism is stressed by its environment. This has the biological advantage of ensuring identical copies of the parent will be well suited to take advantage of the favorable conditions, and variation in offspring in a stressful environment in hopes some of the offspring will find the environment favorable, even when the parents do not. The entire social construct in the novel is therefore an extrapolation of this idea onto a human culture, where successful female clans (female, because only they can produce offspring) can take advantage of their sociological niches by producing exact copies, and unsuccessful females produce variable offspring sexually.

<text>The Pacific Publishing Company is a Seattle-based commercial printer and newspaper publisher. The company publishes newspapers in Washington and along with &quot;Great Basin Sun&quot; in Nevada and &quot;Nevada Rancher&quot; magazine.

== History ==
Houston media executive Tom Haley and five other investors formed Pacific Publishing Company (PPC) in 1990 to purchase the assets of 14 newspapers in King County, Washington with a combined circulation of 126,000 and 135 employees. From John Murray, owner of Murray Publishing Company, PPC purchased the &quot;Queen Anne News&quot;, &quot;Magnolia News&quot;, &quot;Masonic Tribune&quot;, &quot;The Issaquah Press&quot;, &quot;The Issaquah Valley Shopper&quot; and &quot;Argus Weekend.&quot; From John Flaherty, owner of Flaherty Newspapers, PPC purchased the &quot;Beacon Hill News&quot;, &quot;Capitol Hill Times&quot;, &quot;University Herald&quot;, &quot;The North Central Outlook&quot;, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Mercer Islander&quot;, &quot;Madison Park Times&quot;, &quot;South District Journal&quot; and &quot;Seattle&#x27;s Police Beat&quot;.

In 1995, PPC sold &quot;The Issaquah Press&quot; to The Seattle Times Company. The paper closed in February 2017 after publishing more than 6,000 editions over 117 years.

By 2000, PPC had nine publications with a combine total circulation of 90,000 and employed 43 full-time workers and eight part-timers.

In 2005, Haley sold PPC to Peter Bernhard, who owned several community newspapers in Nevada.

In January 2007, PPC sold &quot;The Kirkland Courier&quot; to King County Publications, a subsidy of Sound Publishing, and it was renamed to &quot;The Kirkland Reporter&quot;. PPC originally purchased &quot;The Kirkland Courier&quot; in 1992, which at that time was a free weekly newspaper with a 17,000 circulation.

PPC ran into financial difficulty during the global Great Recession of 2007–2009, selling the &quot;Capitol Hill Times&quot; in July 2009 to Washington Legal Journal, a legal notice publisher.

In January 2012, PPC shut down its &quot;South Seattle Beacon&quot; and &quot;North Seattle Herald-Outlook&quot; community newspapers.

PPC reacquired the &quot;Capitol Hill Times&quot; on Jan. 1, 2015 from RIM Publications, the publishing wing of the foreclosure services company that took it over from PPC in 2012. PPC also acquired RIM&#x27;s last two remaining Washington papers: the &quot;Monroe Monitor and Valley News&quot; and &quot;The Eatonville Dispatch&quot;.

&quot;The&quot; &quot;Capitol Hill Times,&quot; founded in 1926, ceased as of 2020. A year later &quot;The&quot; &quot;Monroe Monitor&quot;, founded in 1899, was merged into the &quot;Snohomish County Tribune&quot; in November 2021.

=== Nevada News Group ===
Nevada News Group is a division of PPC operating in Nevada. Prior to 2022, Nevada News Group published six community newspapers along with a business publication and a ranching magazine.

On Aug. 1, 2019, PPC acquired the assets of four publications from Sierra Nevada Media Group: the &quot;Nevada Appeal&quot; in Carson City, The &quot;Record-Courier&quot; in Gardnerville, the &quot;Fallon Lahontan Valley News&quot; and the &quot;Northern Nevada Business View&quot; in Reno. Nevada News Group was to operate these papers along with the other titles it published at the time: the &quot;Winnemucca Humboldt Sun&quot;, &quot;Battle Mountain Bugle&quot;, &quot;Lovelock Review-Miner&quot;, &quot;Fallon and Fernley Mailbox News&quot;, and &quot;Nevada Rancher&quot; magazine.

On June 15, 2022, Owner/Publisher Peter Bernhard announced the &quot;Winnemucca Humboldt Sun&quot;, &quot;Battle Mountain Bugle&quot; and &quot;Lovelock Review-Miner&quot; would be merged into a single publication called the &quot;Great Basin Sun&quot;. Bernhard attributed this to the February 2022 closing of Press Works Ink, a printing press in Carson City owned by Ogden Newspapers that printed all of PPC&#x27;s Nevada newspapers. As a result of the press closure, PPC moved the printing of its Nevada newspapers out of state to Wesco Graphics in Tracy, California.

In January 2025, PPC sold Nevada News Group to Eagle Valley Publishing. The sale included the &quot;Nevada Appeal&quot;, &quot;The Record-Courier&quot;, the &quot;Lahontan Valley News&quot; and &quot;Northern Nevada Business Weekly.&quot; PPC retained ownership of &quot;Great Basin Sun&quot; in Winnemucca and &quot;Nevada Rancher&quot; magazine.

== Commercial Printing ==
PPC&#x27;s Commercial Web Printing Division was first started within Murray Publishing in 1976. The facility is located near downtown Seattle at 636 S. Alaska Street, in SoDo near Georgetown. Pacific Publishing maintains two lines of cold-set web press operating 24 hours a day six days a week.

<text>Antoine Étex (March 20, 1808 ParisJuly 14, 1888 Chaville) was a French sculptor, painter and architect.

==Biography==
He first exhibited in the Paris Salon of 1833, his work including a reproduction in marble of his &quot;Death of Hyacinthus&quot;, and the plaster cast of his &quot;Cain and His Race Cursed By God&quot;. Adolphe Thiers, who was at this time minister of public works, now commissioned him to execute the two groups of &quot;Peace&quot; and &quot;War&quot;, flanking the arch on the east facade of the Arc de Triomphe. This last, which established his reputation, he reproduced in marble in the Paris Salon of 1839.

The French capital contains numerous examples of the sculptural works of Étex, which included mythological and religious subjects besides a great number of portraits. Among the best known of his architectural productions is Étex&#x27;s tomb of Théodore Géricault in Père Lachaise Cemetery, which includes a bronze figure of the painter, and a low-relief version the painter&#x27;s controversial &quot;Raft of the Medusa&quot; on a front panel.

Étex&#x27;s paintings include the subjects of Eurydice and the martyrdom of Saint Sebastian, and he also wrote a number of essays on subjects connected with the arts. The last year of his life was spent at Nice, and he died at Chaville, Seine-et-Oise in 1888. He was buried in the Cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris.

<doc id="824373" wikidata="Q7898388" url="?curid=824373" title="Upminster Bridge">
<text>Upminster Bridge is a crossing of the River Ingrebourne carrying the A124 road between the suburbs of Hornchurch and Upminster in northeast London, England. The bridge is known to have existed since at least 1375 and the current brick bridge was opened in 1892, replacing a series of wooden bridges. It gave its name to the nearby Upminster Bridge tube station, which opened in 1934, and has also been applied to the neighbourhood around the station in the London Borough of Havering.

==Etymology==
The bridge has been alternatively known as Bridge House Bridge and Lower Bridge, with &quot;Bridge House&quot; referring to a house which stood nearby on the current site of Hornchurch Stadium. The placename &quot;Upminster&quot; is first recorded in 1062 as &quot;Upmynstre&quot; and is recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book. It is formed from Old English &quot;upp&quot; and &quot;mynster&quot;, possibly meaning the large church on high ground, above the valley of the Ingrebourne. However, it may also indicate the position of an Anglo-Saxon minster secondary to those at Barking or Tilbury.

==History==
The bridge has existed since at least 1375. It is recorded in 1617 as being in need of repair. The River Ingrebourne formed the boundary between the ancient parishes of Hornchurch and Upminster. However, upkeep of all bridges over the river were the responsibility of the Upminster parish authorities, as Hornchurch claimed exception due to the charter of the Royal Liberty of Havering. The wooden bridge was destroyed and replaced with another after the winter of 1709/10. Replacement wooden carriage bridges were constructed in 1759 and 1827 and an adjacent ford was in use up until the 19th century. A stone and brick structure was completed in 1892 and contains a time capsule.

The significance of the boundary was reduced in 1934 when both sides became part of Hornchurch Urban District. Upminster Bridge tube station opened in 1934. Until its last replacement with railings in the 1980s by Havering London Borough Council, the bridge used to have two low height cast-iron plated bridge sides that were cast by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry, makers of Big Ben and other bells in the Houses of Parliament. A nearby pub used to bear the name &quot;The Bridge House&quot; but is now called &quot;The Windmill&quot;, after a brief period being the &quot;Hungry Horse&quot;.

==Geography==
The area is split between the Hornchurch and Upminster post towns. However, the post town boundary does not follow the line of the river, instead deviating from it at Hacton Bridge, following the Fenchurch Street–Southend railway line to Berkeley Close and then realigning to the river at Upminster Golf Course. This causes three streets east of the Ingrebourne to be in the Hornchurch post town and twelve streets west of the river to be in the Upminster post town. The street names Bridge Avenue, Boundary Road, Hornminster Glen and Minster Way allude the nature of the location as a boundary between places.

==Transport==
It is the location of Upminster Bridge tube station. The area is served by the 193, 248 and 370 bus routes, with services to Cranham, Romford, Upminster and Lakeside. The London Loop key walking route passes through the Upminster Bridge area, and the station forms the end point of section 22 from Harold Wood and the starting point of section 23 to Rainham.

Until 1972, bus routes on the A124 road that crosses the narrow bridge were more numerous. Before 248 was extended from its orbital run around Upminster Park Estate to connect into Romford town centre, the London Transport buses reaching Upminster station were the 193 and the 86. The latter running all the way from Bow and Limehouse the 15 or so miles to Upminster most of the time hugging the course of the A124 road.

<doc id="824388" wikidata="Q434061" url="?curid=824388" title="Francis V, Duke of Modena">
<text>Francis V, Duke of Modena, Reggio and Guastalla, Archduke of Austria-Este, Royal Prince of [[Hungary]] and [[Bohemia]], Duke of [[Mirandola]] and of [[Massa, Tuscany|Massa]], Prince of [[Carrara]] (; 1 June 1819 – 20 November 1875) was a reigning prince. He was Duke of Modena, Reggio, and Mirandola, Duke of Guastalla from 1847 and Duke of Massa and Prince of Carrara from 1846 to 1859. His parents were Francis IV of Modena and Princess Maria Beatrice of Savoy. He was the last reigning duke of Modena before the duchy was incorporated into the Kingdom of Italy.

==Life and legacy==
Francis was baptised 5 days after birth by the local archbishop in the local cathedral; Emperor Francis I of Austria, the former Holy Roman Emperor, was his godfather, but his uncle Archduke Ferdinand acted as proxy for the emperor.

In 1826 Francis IV of Modena appointed Count Clemente Coronini as tutor to Francis, with Don Pietro Raffaelli, who would later become Bishop of Carpi and Reggio, as his assistant. In 1829, Baron Ernest Geramb became Francis&#x27; new tutor.

On 15 September 1836, Francis became a Knight of the Austrian Order of the Golden Fleece, and 3 years later he received the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Netherlands Lion.

After the death of his mother in 1840, Francis was considered the legitimate heir to the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland by Jacobites as Francis I. At his death his younger brother&#x27;s daughter Maria Theresia of Austria-Este became Jacobite claimant.

On 30 March 1842, Francis married Princess Adelgunde of Bavaria, daughter of King Ludwig I of Bavaria, in the Allerheiligen-Hofkirche at the Munich Residenz. The Archbishop of Munich-Freising was the chief officiant of the wedding. The couple had only one child, Princess Anna Beatrice (19 October 1848 in Gries, Bolzano – 8 July 1849 in Modena).

In 1842, Francis received another order: the Order of the Most Holy Annunciation.

At the death of his father Francis IV of Modena on 21 January 1846, Francis succeeded as reigning duke of Modena. As member of a cadet branch of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine he also bore the titles of an Archduke of Austria and a Prince Royal of Hungary and Bohemia from birth; from his father he inherited also the titles of Duke of Reggio and Mirandola, Duke of Massa, Prince of Carrara and Lunigiana. At the death of his cousin the Duchess Marie-Louise of Parma on 18 December 1847, he succeeded as Duke of Guastalla.

During the revolutions of 1848, Francis was forced to flee his duchy by a popular uprising and was restored by Austrian troops in the following year.

In 1855, Francis established his own new order: the Order of the Eagle of Este, of which he acted as Grand Master.

In 1859 the Duchy of Modena was invaded by armies of France and Sardinia in the Second Italian War of Independence. On 11 June, Francis fled and his government was overthrown on 14 June. The duchy was incorporated into the United Provinces of Central Italy. On 18 March 1860, King Victor Emanuel II of Sardinia ordered Modena to be incorporated into the new Kingdom of Italy. Francis protested against this four days later.

After the loss of his duchy, Francis withdrew to Vienna, where he lived in the Palais Modena. He also had a summer residence at Schloss Wildenwart in Bavaria. Although he spent most of his time in Austria he occasionally traveled and in 1864 he visited the Middle East.

On 7 March 1861, William Ewart Gladstone, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, made a verbal attack against Francis in the House of Commons, primarily accusing Francis of having violated criminal procedure by imposing excessive punishments. Constantine Phipps, Marquis of Normanby published a book later that year rebutting all of Gladstone&#x27;s charges against Francis.

Francis died at Vienna on 20 November 1875. He left most of his huge estate to his 1st cousin twice removed Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, who subsequently used the title Archduke of Austria-Este in keeping with the strict terms of the will. Francis&#x27;s remains were kept at the Capuchin Church in Vienna.

<text>The Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope or JKT is a 1-metre optical telescope named for the Dutch astronomer Jacobus Kapteyn (1851–1922) of the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on La Palma in the Canary Islands, Spain.

Funded jointly by the Netherlands and the United Kingdom with planning throughout the 1970s, construction of the JKT was completed in 1983 with the first photographic plate taken in March 1984. It can be used with two different focal points and different instruments, although by 1998 this was refined to one CCD imaging instrument. The telescope weighs nearly 40 metric tons in total.

During construction in 1983, a Spanish container ship carrying parts of the telescope to La Palma was involved in an aircraft incident. In what is known as the Alraigo incident, a British Royal Navy Sea Harrier fighter jet made an emergency landing on the base plate for the telescope.

Being superseded by more recent and larger telescopes, it was taken out of service as a common-user facility in August 2003. 

Since 2014, the telescope is owned by the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC) and operated by the &quot;Southeastern Association for Research in Astronomy&quot; (SARA) which has retrofitted JKT as a remotely operated observatory (under the internal designation SARA-RM), with the first new observations in this regime in April 2016.

<text>Sir Noel Plunkett Power, (Traditional Chinese: 鮑偉華爵士, 4 December 1929 – 19 November 2009) was a senior judge in Hong Kong and Brunei Darussalam. He had been a barrister-at-law in his home-country Australia when he joined the judiciary of Hong Kong in 1965 as a magistrate in the Lands Tribunal. Since then, he had been successively promoted as President of the Lands Tribunal, a puisne judge of the Supreme Court and Vice-President of the Court of Appeal. In 1996, he became acting Chief Justice of the Supreme Court when Sir Ti-liang Yang resigned and contested for the first ever election of the Chief Executive. After the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong from Britain to People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1997, he was appointed Vice-President of the Court of Appeal of the High Court. He retired from the High Court in 1999 but remained as a non-permanent judge of the Court of Final Appeal.

Power was honoured with a knighthood and a Gold Bauhinia Star in 1999 by the British monarch and the Government of Hong Kong respectively. He chaired an independent inquiry to probe into the opinion poll scandal of the University of Hong Kong in 2000. In 2005, he was one of the presiding judges of the Court of Final Appeal who heard the inheritance dispute between local tycoon Nina Wang and her old-aged father-in-law. In his later years, Power was a judge of the Court of Appeal of Brunei Darussalam and was appointed President in 2007. He died in office in 2009.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Power was born on 4 December 1929 in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, to a locally renowned family of Irish descent. His grandfather, Francis Power (1852–1912), was a member of the Legislative Council of Queensland; his great-uncle, Virgil Power, (1849–1914) was a judge of the Supreme Court of Queensland. Power was the middle child among his siblings with an elder brother and younger sister. His parents were John Joseph Power, a doctor in the Australian Army and once the president of the Queensland Turf Club, and Hilda Power.

In his early years, Noel Power was educated at Downlands College, Toowoomba, Queensland. After that he read law and studied literature at the University of Queensland where he was a member of the winning team in the Inter-Varsity Debating Competition. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts and LL.B degrees from the university.

===Judicial career===
Shortly after graduation, Power was called to the bars of the High Court of Australia and Supreme Court of Queensland in 1955, where he began his career as a barrister-at-law. In 1965, he moved to Hong Kong and became a magistrate of the Lands Tribunal. He managed to get promoted as President of the Lands Tribunal in 1976. In this capacity, he had compiled the &quot;Lands Tribunal Law Reports&quot; for three consecutive years, before getting promoted again as a puisne judge of the Supreme Court in 1979. During serving in the Supreme Court, Power was appointed by the government in 1984 to chair the Broadcasting Review Board. Under his chairmanship, the committee published a report in 1985 which resulted in the establishment of the Broadcasting Authority in 1987. In 1987, Power became a judge of the Court of Appeal, a post he had held until 1993 when he was appointed Vice-President of the Court of Appeal. From 1994 to 1997, he was also the chairman of the editorial board of the &quot;Hong Kong Law Reports&quot;.

In 1996, Power was appointed acting Chief Justice of the Supreme Court when Sir Ti-liang Yang resigned and contested for the election of the Chief Executive. He did not hold the post for long and was soon succeeded by Andrew Li as Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal immediately after the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong from Britain to the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1997.

The end of British rule bought many changes to the judicature of Hong Kong. A Court of Final Appeal was set up to replace the British Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and the Supreme Court was renamed the High Court, and Power was appointed a non-permanent judge of the Court of Final Appeal in addition to his original post as Vice-President of the Court of Appeal. Justice Power retired from the Court of Appeal in July 1999 but continued to serve in the Court of Final Appeal. In 2005, he was one of the judges of the Court of Final Appeal who heard the inheritance dispute between local business tycoon, Nina Wang, and her old aged father-in-law. The case was one of the longest civil trials in the legal history of Hong Kong. The court finally overturned the previous High Court rulings and found in favour of Nina Wang.

To mark his contribution to the judiciary of Hong Kong, Power was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours of 1999. He received the knighthood in person from Queen Elizabeth II in Buckingham Palace in the same year. Also in 1999, the Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region awarded him the Gold Bauhinia Star, the second-highest honour the Chief Executive can bestow.

In 2000, an opinion poll scandal emerged in the University of Hong Kong when the Director of the university&#x27;s Public Opinion Programme (POP), Dr Robert Chung, revealed to the local media that he was pressured by then Chief Executive, Tung Chee Hwa, through a third person that he must stop conducting public opinion polls on the popularity of the Chief Executive and the government. The scandal aroused critical debate in Hong Kong that the then Pro-Chancellor of the University of Hong Kong, Sir Ti-liang Yang, was compelled to set up an independent inquiry panel. Justice Power was then appointed to chair the panel while other members of the inquiry were Ronny Wong Fook- hum, former Chairman of the Bar Association, and Pamela Chan, former Chief Executive of the Consumer Council. In the 76-page report later published by the inquiry, all three members concurred in concluding that the Senior Special Assistant to the Chief Executive, Andrew Lo Cheung-on, did attempt to influence the Public Opinion Programme. The report finally resulted in the resignations of the then Vice-Chancellor, Prof Cheng Yiu-chung, and Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Prof Wong Siu-lun, of the university.

===Later years===
Since 1980, Power had already served as visiting judge to Brunei Darussalam on several occasions. After retiring from the Court of Appeal of Hong Kong in 1999, he was appointed a judge of the Court of Appeal of Brunei Darussalam in 2003, and became President of the Court of Appeal of Brunei Darussalam in 2007.

Power resided in Australia in his final years but kept travelling frequently to hear cases in Brunei. Despite declining health, he managed to work through the legal year of 2009 in Brunei.

===Death===

On 19 November 2009, he suddenly suffered a heart attack and was sent to the Jerudong Park Medical Centre in Brunei. He died on the same day in the medical centre, while he was still in office, aged 79.

The death of Justice Power was grieved by the Law Society of Brunei Darussalam and Chief Justice of Hong Kong, Andrew Li. In his statement, Chief Justice Li particularly praised him as &quot;one of the most outstanding Judges to have served Hong Kong in recent decades. He was an outstanding lawyer and his judgments have provided authoritative guidance in many areas, particularly in the criminal field.&quot; A memorial service was held by the Law Society of Brunei on 21 November. Lady Power and key people from the judiciary of Brunei were present.

==Family==
Power was married to Irma Maroya, a Croatian, in Australia on 27 March 1965. They moved to Hong Kong soon after their marriage. The couple had two sons and one daughter. Sir Noel&#x27;s hobbies included travelling, reading, and cooking and wine tasting. From 1984 to 1999 he was the Chairman of Hong Kong Island of the International Food and Wine Society. From 1994 to 1999 he was Chairman of Asia-Pacific Zone and from 1999 to 2009 was Chairman of Gold Coast of the same society. Sir Noel found the Wines of the Pacific Rim Fair in Hong Kong in 1988. The Fair had become an annual event since then.

<text>Ludovic Vitet (18 October 18025 June 1873) was a French dramatist and politician.

==Early life and career==
Ludovic Vitet was born in Paris. He came from a wealthy bourgeois family, as the grandson of former member of the National Convention Louis Vitet (17361809), and son of Pierre-Jean Vitet and Amélie Arnaudtizon. He was educated at the École Normale. His politics were liberal and he was a member of the society &quot;Aide-toi, le ciel t&#x27;aidera.&quot; At the École he took courses in philosophy and studied law, practicing and teaching until 1824, when he abandoned these professions to travel around France and to Italy, since he was interested in history, architecture, archeology and music.

In the 1820s, Vitet became one of the contributors to the &quot;Globe,&quot; a liberal-leaning journal founded by Paul-François Dubois which also featured the writing of Charles de Rémusat, Victor Cousin, and Étienne-Jean Delécluze. He also contributed to the &quot;Revue française&quot; and the &quot;Revue des deux Mondes,&quot; of which he was one of the main editors, as well as to the &quot;Journal des savants&quot;. Between 1827 and 1829 Vitet published several dramatic scenes (&quot;Les Barricades&quot;, &quot;Les Etats de Blois&quot;, and &quot;La mort de Henri III&quot;), which ensured his notoriety and which were later reunited in volume under the title &quot;La Ligue&quot; (1844).

==Orleanist Monarchy==
One of the main advocates of liberalism, both political and economic, he was a friend of Madame de Staël, Alessandro Manzoni and Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi. With a few friends, he founded the society &quot;Aide-toi, le ciel t&#x27;aidera&quot; (Help yourself, Heaven will help you) in order to support the Liberals in the elections of 1827. The society&#x27;s efforts to increase voter registration for the opposition contributed to the defeat of the ultra-royalists in the election. Vitet unsuccessfully requested a prefecture from the Minister of the Interior, François Guizot; however, on 25 November Guizot created for him the new post of Inspector General of Historic Monuments, which foreshadowed the current Ministry of Culture. The report submitted by Vitet in 1831 at the end of his first tour in the north of France shows that he was in charge not only of monuments but also of museums, libraries, archives and schools of artistic education. This report was soon used by Victor Hugo for his pamphlet &quot;War on the Demolishers&quot;, published in 1832. Vitet made two other tours: one to Burgundy, Lyons and its environs, and Puy in 1831; the other to the southwest in 1833, which gave him the opportunity to save the cloister of Moissac.

During the Orleanist Monarchy of Louis-Philippe Vitet&#x27;s prominence as a politician and bureaucrat emerged. He presented himself unsuccessfully to the Chamber of Deputies on 21 June 1834, as an elected representative for the 6th district of the Seine-Maritime département (Bolbec). But the Chamber declared the election null and void, so he stood for re-election and was successfully seated the following September 13. He made distinguished speeches in the House and defended the policy of the Ministry of the Interior. On 10 April 1836 Vitet was appointed Secretary General of the Ministry of Commerce and as such resigned from his duties as Inspector General of Historic Monuments, which he handed over to Prosper Mérimée, with whom he continued to closely follow questions concerning historic monuments. In 1837, he became a member of the newly created Commission des monuments historiques, which had just been created and which awarded grants for and oversaw the restoration of historic sites. He served as vice-president of the commission from 1839 onwards. Vitet was elected to the Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres on 15 December 1839; he was then elected to the Académie Française on 8 May 1845, filling the vacated chair of the late Alexandre Soumet.

In 1836, Vitet was appointed simultaneously as Secretary General of the Ministry of Finance and to the Council of State. He also successfully stood for re-election on October 15 that year, and was successively re-elected on 4 November 1837, 2 March 1839, 9 July 1842 and 1 August 1846, serving six terms in all. In the Chamber, he voted for the endowment of the Duke of Nemours, for the census, for the Pritchard indemnity, and wrote the official report for the law on patents.

==Later career==
After the Revolution of 1848, Vitet remained faithful to the Orléans family. He ran unsuccessfully in the Constituent Assembly elections in the Seine-Inférieure department, but was elected to the Legislative Assembly on 13 May 1849 and became one of its vice-presidents. He took his place in the monarchist majority and voted for the expedition to Rome; for the Falloux Laws on education; and for the law of 31 May 1850, restricting universal suffrage. Hostile to the policy of the prince-president, he was among the deputies who met at the town hall of the 10th arrondissement of Paris to protest against the coup d&#x27;état of 2 December 1851, that ended the Second Republic and gave Louis-Napoleon presidential powers for ten years, effectively beginning the Second Empire. As vice-president of the meeting, Vitet was arrested and imprisoned for a few days.

Under the Second Empire, he moved away from public life and dealt only with art and literature, in part because he remained a monarchist. The disasters of 1870-71 reawakened Vitet&#x27;s interest in public affairs, and he published in the &quot;Revue des deux mondes&quot; his optimistic &quot;Lettres sur le siège de Paris.&quot; He joined the Republic after its inception on 4 September 1870, and during the Siege of Paris he published a series of articles in the &quot;Revue des deux Mondes&quot; in which he advocated resistance.

Elected deputy again for Seine-Inferieure in the National Assembly on 8 February 1871, he was, from the start, one of the chamber&#x27;s vice-presidents and was part of the commission headed by Adolphe Thiers to negotiate peace with the Germans. He deposited the bill of 30 August 1871, in which the Assembly recognized itself as constituting power, which passed by a vote of 434 to 225. He wrote the official report on the &quot;Rivet law,&quot; creating the Third Republic, which he personally opposed. In June 1872, Vitet was part of the delegation sent by the right to Thiers to persuade the latter to adopt a conservative policy. He voted for peace with the Germans, for the abrogation of the laws of exile, for the petition of the bishops, against the three-year service, and in May 1873 for the resignation of Thiers. This was his last vote before his death a fortnight later.

Under the Third Republic, he had also regained his position as president of the Commission des monuments historiques and worked both for the revision of the list of historical monuments and for the verification of the accounts of the works.

==Family and personal life==
Ludovic Vitet had married Cécile Perier (18141858), the daughter of Scipion Perier, with whom he had no children; but he adopted his niece Hélène Casimir-Perier, whom he made his heiress. He had a sister Amélie, wife of Eugène Aubry-Vitet.

Vitet was the author of some valuable works on the history of art, and his &quot;Monographie de l&#x27;Église Notre-Dame de Noyon&quot; (1845) especially did much to awaken popular interest in architecture. In the early days of the Romantic movement, he wrote some vivid dramatic sketches. They are:
*&quot;Les Barricades, scènes historiques&quot; (1826)
*&quot;Les États de Blois, scènes&quot; (1827)
*&quot;La Mort de Henri III&quot; (1829)
All three were published together in 1844 with the title of &quot;La Ligue&quot;.

<doc id="824423" wikidata="Q2199336" url="?curid=824423" title="Phantom Rider">
<text>Phantom Rider is the name of several Old West heroic gunfighter characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was originally called [[Ghost Rider]], and was renamed following the introduction of Marvel&#x27;s motorcycle-riding character of the same name.

The character has made minor appearances across media. He made his live-action debut in the 2007 film &quot;Ghost Rider&quot;, portrayed by Sam Elliott.

==Publication history==
Marvel Comics&#x27; first Ghost Rider look was based on the Magazine Enterprises character Ghost Rider (Rex Fury), created by writer Ray Krank and artist Dick Ayers for editor Vincent Sullivan in &quot;Tim Holt&quot; #11 (1949). The character appeared in horror-themed Western stories through the run of &quot;Tim Holt&quot;, &quot;Red Mask&quot;, and &quot;A-1 Comics&quot; up until the institution of the Comics Code.

After the trademark to the character&#x27;s name and motif lapsed, Marvel Comics debuted its own near-identical, horror-free version of the character in &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; #1 (cover-dated February 1967), by plotter and original &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; artist Ayers, and writers Gary Friedrich and Roy Thomas.

In an interview, Ayers recalled how the character was conceived, &quot;Vin would come in and sit down and describe what he wanted in The Ghost Rider. He told me to go see Disney&#x27;s Sleepy Hollow-Ichabod Crane, The Headless Horseman, and then he told me to play the Vaughn Monroe record, &quot;Ghost Riders in the Sky.&quot; And then he started talking about what he wanted the guy wearing.&quot;

With the introduction of Marvel&#x27;s supernatural Ghost Rider in the 1970s, Marvel renamed its Western Ghost Rider — first, to the unfortunate Night Rider (a term previously used in the Southern United States to refer to members of the Ku Klux Klan) in a 1974–1975 reprint series, and then to Phantom Rider. At least five men have been the Phantom Rider, one of whom is active in the modern day.

The Magazine Enterprises library of characters, including its version of Ghost Rider, was reprinted by AC Comics in the 1980s. While the copyrights have lapsed due to non-renewal, AC renamed the Ghost Rider as the Haunted Horseman, due to Marvel having maintained the Ghost Rider trademark.

==Fictional character biography==

===Carter Slade===
Carter Slade, the first to wear the mask, debuted in &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; #1 (February 1967). He battled evil while dressed in a phosphorescent white costume, complete with a full-face mask, cape, and the hat. Slade received his outfit and horse from Flaming Star, a Native American medicine man.

He was never called the Phantom Rider in these original appearances. In Marvel continuity, it was not until after his death that the Phantom Rider name was given to the character, and reprints now retroactively use that name for Slade.

Johnny Blaze, the modern era Ghost Rider, eventually found himself transported into the 19th century where the latter met and teamed up with Slade. Carter was badly wounded and Blaze took him to Flaming Star to be healed and then dealt with Carter&#x27;s enemies. Carter recovered and Johnny returned to the present.

Slade&#x27;s spirit, however, returned and possessed his descendant Hamilton to make into a Phantom Rider and rode out to rescue Blaze from certain doom.

===Jamie Jacobs===

After Slade&#x27;s death in &quot;Western Gunfighters&quot; #7 (January 1972), his sidekick Jamie Jacobs became the second Phantom Rider. He was soon killed in action.

===Lincoln Slade===
Lincoln Slade is Carter Slade&#x27;s brother and a U.S. Marshal, as well as the third Phantom Rider. Lincoln was driven insane by his powers. When the West Coast Avengers are traveling through time on one of their adventures, Lincoln becomes infatuated with Mockingbird. Lincoln kidnapped the Avenger and fled to a secret location. He then drugs Mockingbird, removing the latter&#x27;s ability to give or deny consent, and rapes her. Once the effects of the drugs wear off, the enraged Mockingbird fights and defeats him. In the battle&#x27;s course, he is knocked over a cliff. As he clings to the cliffside, he first pleads with Mockingbird to help him, then attempts to reassert his hypnotic authority and orders her to help him. Hating him for his violation of her, Mockingbird allows him to fall to his death. Years later, Lincoln&#x27;s spirit possesses his descendant Hamilton to seek &quot;vengeance&quot; against Mockingbird. His spirit returns a second time to make Mockingbird return his feelings.

Comic Book Resources placed him as one of the superheroes Marvel wants you to forget.

===Reno Jones===

In the miniseries &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot;, the African American gunslinger Reno Jones used the Ghost Rider identity briefly in a battle with the Ku Klux Klan-affiliated mercenaries called the Nightriders. Jones was one-half of the team called the Gunhawks, along with his former friend Kid Cassidy, whom Jones had believed dead. Cassidy was revealed to be alive and the leader of the Nightriders; he was killed, and Jones retired.

===Hamilton Slade===
In present-day continuity, Hamilton Slade is Lincoln Slade&#x27;s distant descendant who was an archaeologist who found the burial site of his legendary ancestor, in the supernatural-motorcyclist series &quot;Ghost Rider&quot;. As he explored the site, he found a large burial urn and from it appeared the ghostly garb of his ancestors (Carter and Lincoln). Possessed by the spirits of his ancestors, he became a new version of the Phantom Rider, and rode off to rescue Johnny Blaze, the current Ghost Rider, from one of his foes. However, he would have no memory of his adventures as the Ghost Rider and eventually Lincoln&#x27;s ghost would take over more frequently and haunt Mockingbird for his death. An exorcism released the spirits of Carter and Lincoln from Hamilton. Lincoln is defeated and banished while Hamilton agrees to have Carter possess him. Hamilton attempted a similar exorcism to save his daughter Jaime from the returning spirit of Lincoln. He was killed by Crossfire as the exorcism was being completed.

===J. T. Slade===

Nick Fury recruits Carter Slade&#x27;s grandson, James Taylor Slade (also known as J. T. Slade), introduced in &quot;The Mighty Avengers&quot; #13, to be part of Fury&#x27;s team against the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; of Skrulls. He has superhuman reflexes and the ability to cause a chain to ignite in flame and cause massive damage. The character roll call at the beginning of &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; #4 (September 2008) refers to J. T. as &quot;Hellfire&quot;. Hellfire goes on to make numerous appearances in the ongoing series, &quot;Secret Warriors&quot;. He is revealed to be a HYDRA double agent, after which Fury allows him to fall to his death.

===Jaime Slade===
In the 2010 series &quot;Hawkeye &amp; Mockingbird&quot;, it is revealed that Hamilton Slade had a daughter named Jaime Slade. While she was examining an urn belonging to the Slade family, Lincoln Slade&#x27;s spirit possessed her, transforming Jaime into the new Phantom Rider. Claiming to be both &quot;the spirit and the heir&quot;, the Phantom Rider teamed up with Crossfire to battle the heroes Hawkeye and Mockingbird. Jaime&#x27;s father Hamilton Slade attempts to exorcise her, but is killed by Crossfire.

==Other versions==
The Phantom Riders, a gang inspired by the Phantom Rider, appear in &quot;Old Man Logan&quot;.

==In other media==
===Television===
An original incarnation of the Phantom Rider appears in the &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; episode &quot;Return to the Spider-Verse&quot; Pt. 2, voiced by Clancy Brown. This version is a Wild West-themed alternate reality variant of Ben Parker.

===Film===
The Carter Slade incarnation of Phantom Rider, credited as and amalgamated with the Caretaker, appears in &quot;Ghost Rider&quot;, portrayed by Sam Elliott. This version is a former Texas Ranger from the 19th century who sold his soul to Mephistopheles and became his servant as Ghost Rider before leaving his service and becoming a cemetery caretaker. After Johnny Blaze becomes the new Ghost Rider, Slade mentors him and gives him his shotgun before vanishing into the afterlife.

<text>Connectionless-mode Network Service (CLNS) or simply Connectionless Network Service is an OSI network layer datagram service that does not require a circuit to be established before data is transmitted, and routes messages to their destinations independently of any other messages. As such it is a &quot;best-effort&quot; rather than a &quot;reliable&quot; delivery service. CLNS is not an Internet service, but provides capabilities in an OSI network environment similar to those provided by the Internet protocol suite. The service is specified in ISO/IEC 8348, the OSI Network Service Definition (which also defines the connection-oriented service, CONS.)

==Connectionless-mode Network Protocol==
Connectionless-mode Network Protocol (CLNP) is an OSI protocol deployment. CLNS is the service provided by the Connectionless-mode Network Protocol (CLNP). From August 1990 to April 1995 the NSFNET backbone supported CLNP in addition to TCP/IP. However, CLNP usage remained low compared to TCP/IP.

==Transport Protocol Class 4 (TP4) in conjunction with CLNS==
CLNS is used by ISO Transport Protocol Class 4 (TP4), one of the five transport layer protocols in the OSI suite. TP4 offers error recovery, performs segmentation and reassembly, and supplies multiplexing and demultiplexing of data streams over a single virtual circuit. TP4 sequences PDUs and retransmits them or re-initiates the connection if an excessive number are unacknowledged. TP4 provides reliable transport service and functions with either connection-oriented or connectionless network service. TP4 is the most commonly used of all the OSI transport protocols and is similar to the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) in the Internet protocol suite.

==Protocols providing CLNS==

Several protocols provide the CLNS service:

* Connectionless-mode Network Protocol (CLNP), as specified in ITU-T Recommendation X.233.
* End System-to-Intermediate System (ES-IS), a routing exchange protocol for use in conjunction with the protocol for providing the CLNS (ISO 9542).
* Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS), an intradomain routing exchange protocol used in both the OSI and Internet environments (ISO/IEC 10589 and RFC 1142).
* Interdomain Routing Protocol (IDRP), the OSI equivalent of BGP.
* Signalling Connection Control Part (SCCP), as specified in ITU-T Recommendation Q.711 is a Signaling System 7 protocol.

* X.25 protocol suite, an OSI Connection Oriented Network Service (CONS)

<doc id="824434" wikidata="Q3129922" url="?curid=824434" title="Isaac Newton Telescope">
<text>The Isaac Newton Telescope or INT is a 2.54 m (100 in) optical telescope run by the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on La Palma in the Canary Islands since 1984.

Originally the INT was situated at Herstmonceux Castle in Sussex, England, which was the site of the Royal Greenwich Observatory after it moved away from Greenwich due to light pollution. It was inaugurated in 1967 by Queen Elizabeth II.

Herstmonceux suffered from poor weather, and the advent of mass air travel made it plausible for UK astronomers to run an overseas observatory. In 1979, the INT was shipped to La Palma, where it has remained ever since. It saw its second first light in 1984, with a video camera. A major change was the mirror was now made of the new type Zerodur glass, as compared to the old mirror&#x27;s Pyrex glass.

Until 2024, the main instruments were the Wide Field Camera (WFC) and Intermediate Dispersion Spectrograph (IDS). WFC is a four CCD photographic prime-focus instrument with a relatively large 0.56×0.56 square degree field of view, which was commissioned in 1997. IDS is a medium-low resolution optical spectrograph (R 550-9375). As of mid 2024 the INT is undergoing upgrades in preparation for the installation of HARPS3, after which it will be the main instrument.

The old site of the INT is now the Observatory Science Centre at Herstmonceux, and it is known for its distinctive greened copper dome and various science and astronomy activities.

==Summary Background up to 1979==
The United States gifted a 98-inch mirror in 1949 to the United Kingdom. (In a telescope this could establish the 3rd largest in the World, behind only the Hale and Hooker telescopes at that time). After ten years the mount was ordered for the telescope, and in 1959 construction began on what would be the INT, and it was completed by 1965; first light at Herstmonceux was conducted that year.

The mirror was ground by Grubb in the 1950s, although until 1956, according to &quot;Observatories and Telescopes of Modern Time&quot;s, there was some consideration for buying a new 74-inch from Grubb. The Royal Greenwich Observatory completed its move to Herstmonceux in 1956.

A short film was published in 1956 that featured the grinding of the 98-inch mirror blank for the Isaac Newton Telescope by Grubb Parsons. (reflecting telescopes of this type need the glass blank ground into a precise shape, which can take years).

The telescope&#x27;s first light (first, first light) occurred in 1965, and it was dedicated in 1967.

On December 1, 1967, the &quot;Isaac Newton Telescope&quot; of the Royal Greenwich Observatory at Herstmonceux was inaugurated (dedicated) by Queen Elizabeth II. One of the accomplishments with the telescope was the observations of Cygnus X-1.

In the late 1960s, a concept was developed for a Northern Hemisphere Observatory, that culminated in the project for an international observatory in the Canary Islands; Mauna Kea in Hawaii was also considered for the location. Although the telescope was acquitting itself, the weather at the site less so. This eventually led to the plan to move the telescope to a new observatory, which would occur in the next decade and into the early 1980s.

The &#x27;last light&#x27; for the original Isaac Newton Telescope was in May 1979. The new telescope for the island had so many new parts however, it was deemed possible in the mid-1980s to essentially fork the telescope design into two working telescopes with some rejuvenation. This would mean having another functioning telescope at Sussex; however, this project was terminated. One issue is that it would mean operating two telescopes, and the focus at that time had shifted to operating the new INT on the island. The old site would eventually be turned into a science museum with much of the old telescopes left as they were.

The old observatory buildings remain by the Castle, and it is the site of the Herstmonceux Science Centre (aka Observatory Science Centre at Herstmonceux).

==Technical detail since 1984==
The La Palma INT is a Cassegrain telescope, with a 2.54 m (100 in) diameter primary mirror and a focal length of 8.36 m (329 in). The mirror weighs 4361 kg (9614 lb), and is supported by a polar disc/fork type equatorial mounting. The total weight of the telescope is around 90 tons. The f/3.29 Prime focus, used with the WFC, allows an unvignetted field of view of 40 arcminutes (approximately 0.3 square degrees). There is also a secondary focal station, the f/15 Cassegrain focus, which possesses a 20 arcminute field of view and is the mount point for the IDS. The telescope&#x27;s second first light was done by video.

The new 100 inch Zerodur-glass mirror arrived at La Palma in December 1982.

The pointing accuracy of the telescope is around 5 arcseconds, but a sophisticated autoguider, which tracks a given guide star and makes small corrections to the telescope tracking, allows a guiding accuracy of better than an arcsecond on better than 20th magnitude guide stars in support of the typical 0.8–1.5 arcsec seeing at the INT.

==Contemporaries==
The Isaac Newton Telescope was a very large telescope for its day, and the largest in England. It was a little smaller in aperture than the 100-inch Hooker telescope in the United States, but much newer. It originally had a 98-inch mirror when in England, but was given a new, larger 100-inch mirror by Grubb Parsons after the move.

===1967===
The INT was inaugurated by Queen Elizabeth II in 1967. The largest optical telescopes in 1967 included:

===1984===
INT began its new life atop the Spanish island of La Palma in the Canary Islands in 1984, with a new mirror and dome. Large visible-light optical ground telescopes in 1984 included:

==HARPS3==

The High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher 3 (HARPS3) is a high resolution Echelle-type spectrograph that will be installed onto the telescope and aims to start observations in March 2025. It is being built as part of the Terra Hunting Experiment - a future 10 year radial velocity measurement program to discover Earth-like exoplanets. It has a goal to achieve 10 cm/s radial velocity precision.

<text>Molar refractivity, formula_1, is a measure of the total polarizability of a mole of a substance.

For a perfect dielectric which is made of one type of molecule, the molar refractivity is proportional to the polarizability of a single molecule of the substance. For real materials, intermolecular interactions (the effect of the induced dipole moment of one molecule on the field felt by nearby molecules) give rise to a density dependence.

The molar refractivity is commonly expressed as a sum of components, where the leading order is the value for a perfect dielectric, followed by the density-dependent corrections:

:formula_2

The coefficients formula_3 are called the refractivity virial coefficients. Some research papers are dedicated to finding the values of the subleading coefficients of different substances. In other contexts, the material can be assumed to be approximately perfect, so that the only coefficient of interest is formula_4.

The coefficients depend on the wavelength of the applied field (and on the type and composition of the material), but not on thermodynamic state variables such as temperature or pressure.

The leading order (perfect dielectric) molar refractivity is defined as
:formula_5
where formula_6 is the Avogadro constant and formula_7 is the mean polarizability of a molecule.

Substituting the molar refractivity into the Lorentz-Lorenz formula gives, for gasses
:formula_8

where formula_9 is the refractive index, formula_10 is the pressure of the gas, formula_11 is the universal gas constant, and formula_12 is the (absolute) temperature; the ideal gas law was used here to convert the particle density (appearing in the Lorentz-Lorenz formula) to pressure and temperature.

For a gas, formula_13, so the molar refractivity can be approximated by
:formula_14
The molar refractivity formula_4 does not depend on formula_16, formula_17 or formula_18, since they are not independent quantities.

In terms of density ρ and molecular weight M, it can be shown that:
:formula_19

<doc id="824448" wikidata="Q781983" url="?curid=824448" title="Spinal canal">
<text>In human anatomy, the spinal canal, vertebral canal or spinal cavity is an elongated body cavity enclosed within the dorsal bony arches of the vertebral column, which contains the spinal cord, spinal roots and dorsal root ganglia. It is a process of the dorsal body cavity formed by alignment of the vertebral foramina. Under the vertebral arches, the spinal canal is also covered anteriorly by the posterior longitudinal ligament and posteriorly by the ligamentum flavum. The potential space between these ligaments and the dura mater covering the spinal cord is known as the epidural space. Spinal nerves exit the spinal canal via the intervertebral foramina under the corresponding vertebral pedicles.

In humans, the spinal cord gets outgrown by the vertebral column during development into adulthood, and the lower section of the spinal canal is occupied by the filum terminale and a bundle of spinal nerves known as the cauda equina instead of the actual spinal cord, which finishes at the L1/L2 level.

== Structure ==
The vertebral canal is enclosed anteriorly by the vertebral bodies, intervertebral discs, and the posterior longitudinal ligament; it is enclosed posteriorly by the vertebral laminae and the ligamenta flava; laterally, it is incompletely enclosed by the pedicles with the interval between two adjacent pedicles on either side creating an intervertebral foramen (allowing the passage of the spinal nerves and radicular blood vessels).

The vertebral canal progressively narrows inferiorly. It is wider in the cervical region to accommodate the cervical enlargement of the spinal cord.

=== Contents ===

The outermost layer of the meninges, the dura mater, is closely associated with the arachnoid mater which in turn is loosely connected to the innermost layer, the pia mater. The meninges divide the spinal canal into the epidural space and the subarachnoid space. The pia mater is closely attached to the spinal cord. A subdural space is generally only present due to trauma and/or pathological situations. The subarachnoid space is filled with cerebrospinal fluid and contains the vessels that supply the spinal cord, namely the anterior spinal artery and the paired posterior spinal arteries, accompanied by corresponding spinal veins. The anterior and posterior spinal arteries form anastomoses known as the vasocorona of the spinal cord and these supply nutrients to the canal. The epidural space contains loose fatty tissue, and a network of large, thin-walled blood vessels called the internal vertebral venous plexuses.

== Clinical significance ==
Spinal stenosis is a narrowing of the canal which can occur in any region of the spine and can be caused by a number of factors. It may result in cervical myelopathy if the narrowed canal impinges on the spinal cord itself.

Spinal canal endoscopy can be used to investigate the epidural space, and is an important spinal diagnostic technique.

== History ==
The spinal canal was first described by Jean Fernel.

<doc id="824450" wikidata="Q553362" url="?curid=824450" title="Thomas Culpeper">
<text>Thomas Culpeper ( – 10 December 1541) was an English courtier and close friend of Henry VIII, and was related to two of his queens, Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard. He is known to have had many private meetings with Catherine during her marriage, though these may have involved political intrigue rather than sex. A letter to him was found, written by Queen Catherine and signed, &quot;Yours as long as life endures.&quot; Accused of adultery with Henry&#x27;s young consort, Culpeper denied it and blamed the Queen for the situation, saying that he had tried to end his friendship with her, but that she was &quot;dying of love for him&quot;. Eventually, Culpeper admitted that he intended to sleep with the queen, though he never admitted to having actually done so.

==Early life==
Thomas Culpeper was the second of the three sons of Alexander Culpeper (d. 1541) of Bedgebury in Kent, and his second wife, Constance Harper. His elder brother, also named Thomas, was a client of Thomas Cromwell. The brothers were known for collecting valuable items for the royal family during their time at court. He was distantly related to the Howard family, who were immensely powerful at the time, being a distant cousin of Joyce Culpeper, Catherine Howard&#x27;s mother.

==Royal service==
Having bought the Higham Park estate at Bridge in Kent in 1534, by 1535 Culpeper was acting for Viscount Lisle and his wife, Honor, during which time he collected a number of items for them. In 1538, Honor presented Culpeper with a hawk and during that same year, Culpeper worked with Richard Cromwell to obtain a hawk for King Henry VIII.

Culpeper was described as &quot;a beautiful youth&quot; and he was a great favourite of Henry. Culpeper had major influence with the King and was often bribed to use his influence on others&#x27; behalf. In 1539, a Thomas Culpeper was accused of raping a park-keeper&#x27;s wife and then murdering a villager. However, there is a possibility that the rapist was Culpeper&#x27;s elder brother, also called Thomas. Due to similar names, some confusion between the brothers is possible. However, his elder brother Thomas (born around 1501), may have received a knighthood, as referenced on the Culpeper family tree. Whoever was the guilty party, through influence on the King, a pardon was given. Culpeper was given the honour of being keeper of the armoury and Henry eventually made Culpeper a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber, giving him intimate access to the King, as the role involved dressing and undressing Henry and often sleeping in his bedchamber. He was part of the group of privileged courtiers who greeted Henry&#x27;s fourth wife Anne of Cleves when she arrived in England for her marriage.

From 1537–1541, Culpeper was given several gifts, including the office of keeper of the manor at Penshurst Palace and property in Kent, Essex, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire.

==Supposed affair with Catherine Howard==
In 1540, Culpeper caught the attention of Henry&#x27;s young new bride, Catherine Howard, and by 1541 they were spending time together, often alone and late at night, aided and abetted by Catherine&#x27;s lady-in-waiting, Lady Rochford, the widowed sister-in-law of Anne Boleyn. Culpeper had access to the Queen&#x27;s apartments and often came into contact with the Queen and her attendants. In March 1541 Henry went to Dover and left Catherine behind at Greenwich. At this time Culpeper began asking favours of Catherine. The private meetings between them are thought to have begun sometime around May of that same year. On these occasions only Lady Rochford and another lady-in-waiting, Katherine Tilney, were allowed entrance to the Queen&#x27;s chamber.

On 30 June, Catherine and Henry travelled north on progress with the intention of meeting James V of Scotland at York. They arrived at Lincoln on 9 August, where Culpeper met Catherine for another secret meeting in her bedchamber. These meetings continued in Pontefract Castle, after the court arrived there on 23 August. It is believed that the letter Catherine sent to Culpeper was sent at this time. In this letter she wished to know how he was, and is troubled that he is ill. Catherine also wrote: &quot;I never longed so muche for [a] thynge as I do to se you and to speke wyth you, the wyche I trust shal be shortely now,&quot; and &quot;my trust ys allway in you that you wolbe as you have promysed me...&quot;

These statements cause some to believe that their affair was not only one of passion, but also centred on Culpeper&#x27;s political agenda. With Henry in poor health and only his young son Edward to succeed him; being Catherine&#x27;s favourite would undoubtedly have put Culpeper in a very strong political position. As a well-liked member of the King&#x27;s privy chamber he enjoyed a close relationship with Henry. If the promise Catherine mentioned was in reference to his possible knowledge about her previous sexual relationships, Culpeper could have used this as leverage to gain power and control over the Queen herself. In this specific letter Catherine states that she longs to talk with Culpeper but does not mention any desire to be intimate with him, although she does sign off with the dedication, &quot;Yours as long as life endures&quot;.

Accounts of the Queen&#x27;s premarital indiscretions had meanwhile come to the attention of Thomas Cranmer, then Archbishop of Canterbury. During Cranmer&#x27;s investigations, he came across rumours of an affair between the Queen and Culpeper; Culpeper was soon arrested for questioning. Both he and the Queen denied the allegations, but the letter from Catherine to Culpeper, found during a search of Culpeper&#x27;s rooms, provided the evidence for which Cranmer was looking. Whether the association between Culpeper and the Queen was ever consummated is still debated by historians, but the letter seems to give evidence of Catherine&#x27;s feelings for Culpeper. Also in the letter was a reference to Lady Rochford.

The act of Parliament authorising the executions is the Bill of Atteynder of Mestres Katherin Hawarde late Quene of England, the Royal Assent by Commission Act 1541 (33 Hen. 8. c. 21). This says that, 

==Downfall and execution==
Culpeper was arrested on orders from King Henry and, in December 1541, was tried for adultery alongside Francis Dereham, who was separately accused of adultery with the Queen before her marriage to Henry. Catherine had not hidden the affair with Culpeper from members of her household, who now testified against her to protect themselves.

The Queen was portrayed as having seduced Culpeper at Chenies Palace in Buckinghamshire. With testimony given of private meetings at Hatfield House in Hertfordshire, and during the royal progress to the north of England, his fate was sealed.

Under interrogation, Culpeper admitted to intending to have sexual relations with Catherine and that she intended to sleep with him. Lady Rochford, however, stated in her interrogation that she believed that Culpeper had &quot;known the Queen carnally.&quot;

Both Culpeper and Dereham were found guilty and sentenced to death. They were both to be hanged, drawn and quartered. Both men pleaded for mercy; Culpeper, presumably because of his former closeness to the King, received a commuted sentence of simple beheading. Dereham did not.

Culpeper was executed along with Dereham at Tyburn on 10 December 1541, and their heads were put on display on London Bridge. Culpeper was buried at St Sepulchre-without-Newgate church in London. Queen Catherine and Lady Rochford were both executed on 13 February 1542, and were buried in the Church of St Peter ad Vincula, within the Tower of London.

==Portrayal==
Culpeper is referenced in nearly all biographies of Henry VIII and Catherine Howard. He is less well-represented in popular fiction, where he is often unrepresented except for his relationship with Catherine.

=== Literature ===
In Ford Madox Ford&#x27;s trilogy on Catherine Howard, entitled &quot;The Fifth Queen&quot;, Culpeper is portrayed as an intimate of Catherine&#x27;s who, early on in the novel, arrives with her in tow on a mule as the wedding with Anne of Cleves is about to take place. In dragging the mule forward as a riot is starting outside the King&#x27;s garden, he is described as &quot;a man in green at the mule&#x27;s head, [who] ... sprang like a wild cat under the beast&#x27;s neck. His face blazed white, his teeth shone like a dog&#x27;s, he screamed and struck his dagger through the butcher&#x27;s throat [someone trying to block his and Catherine&#x27;s way]. His motions were those of a wild beast&quot;. His introduction to court is brought about through Catherine. He is sent to Calais to keep him from getting in trouble at Court for his brawling. He is often mentioned as having sold property to buy his impoverished cousin Catherine a proper dress and is not at all consistent with the historical record.

=== On-screen portrayals ===
In the 1933 film &quot;The Private Life of Henry VIII&quot;, Culpeper was played by Robert Donat. In the 1970 BBC series &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot;, he was played by Ralph Bates, although Robin Sachs assumed the role in the subsequent 1972 film, &quot;Henry VIII and His Six Wives&quot;. In the 2003 TV film &quot;Henry VIII&quot;, Thomas Culpeper is portrayed by Joseph Morgan. In the Showtime TV series &quot;The Tudors&quot;, Thomas Culpeper is portrayed by Torrance Coombs; in this series, he is characterised as a cruel, arrogant man whose interest in Catherine is purely sexual; his relationship with her is facilitated by a pre-existing affair with Lady Rochford, something that has no known historical basis.

<text>Charles Bennett (9 December 1871 – 18 December 1948) was a British athlete, winner of the 1500 metres at the 1900 Summer Olympics and the first British track and field athlete to become Olympic champion. He was a member of Finchley Harriers (founded 1877) which was amalgamated into Hillingdon Athletic Club in 1966.

== Biography ==
Bennett, a train driver born in Shapwick, Dorset, was one of the top British middle-distance runners in his years, winning the British 4 miles title after winning the AAA Championships title at the 1897 AAA Championships and 1898 AAA Championships. Additionally, he won the cross country running title in 1899 and 1900. 

Also in 1900, the Olympic year, he won the British title in the mile at the 1900 AAA Championships, qualifying himself for the 1500 m in Paris. That distance had a rather weak field, and Bennett lead throughout the race, defeating local favourite Henri Deloge in 4:06.0. That time was an official world record.

Together with the combined British/Australian 5000 metres team, Bennett won a second Olympic title. Bennett finished first in the race, with an unofficial world record 15:29.2, beating teammate John Rimmer. His third event was the 4000 m steeplechase, in which he just failed to catch up with the same Rimmer in the final part of the race, settling for second place.

Bennett died in Bournemouth, aged 79.

His Olympic achievements were largely forgotten for more than 100 years until his grandson Chris Bennett found his abandoned and overgrown grave in the corner of St Andrew&#x27;s Churchyard in Kinson. In December 2011 Bennett was commemorated after Anthony Ives Memorials of Bournemouth donated a proper headstone to recognise his feat. The plinth, unveiled on the eve of the year of the 2012 London Olympics, reads: &quot;In loving memory of Charles Bennett 1870-1948. First British track and field athlete to become Olympic Champion. Bennett, known as the Shapwick Express, won two gold medals and a silver at the Paris Games in 1900.&quot; The new headstone also remembers Bennett&#x27;s wife Sarah Lena and reads: &quot;Until the day break.&quot;

<doc id="824490" wikidata="Q204920" url="?curid=824490" title="Crown of Aragon">
<text>The Crown of Aragon (, ) was a composite monarchy ruled by one king, originated by the dynastic union of the Kingdom of Aragon and the County of Barcelona and ended as a consequence of the War of the Spanish Succession. At the height of its power in the 14th and 15th centuries, the Crown of Aragon was a thalassocracy controlling a large portion of present-day eastern Spain, parts of what is now southern France, and a Mediterranean empire which included the Balearic Islands, Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia, Malta, Southern Italy (from 1442), and parts of Greece (until 1388).

The component realms of the Crown were not united politically except at the level of the king, who ruled over each autonomous polity according to its own laws, raising funds under each tax structure, dealing separately with each &quot;Corts&quot; or &quot;Cortes&quot;, particularly the Kingdom of Aragon, the Principality of Catalonia, the Kingdom of Majorca, and the Kingdom of Valencia. The larger Crown of Aragon must not be confused with one of its constituent parts, the Kingdom of Aragon, from which it takes its name.

In 1479, a new dynastic union of the Crown of Aragon with the Crown of Castile by the Catholic Monarchs, joining what contemporaries referred to as &quot;the Spains&quot;, led to what would become the Spanish composite monarchy under Habsburg monarchs. The Aragonese Crown continued to exist until it was abolished by the Nueva Planta decrees issued by King Philip V in 1707–1716 as a consequence of the defeat of Archduke Charles (as Charles III of Aragon) in the War of the Spanish Succession.

==Context==
Formally, the political centre of the Crown of Aragon was Zaragoza, where kings were crowned at La Seo Cathedral. The &#x27;de facto&#x27; capital and leading cultural, administrative and economic centre of the Crown of Aragon was Barcelona, followed by Valencia. Finally, Palma (Majorca) was an additional important city and seaport.

The Crown of Aragon eventually included the Kingdom of Aragon, the Principality of Catalonia (until the late 12th century the County of Barcelona and others), the Kingdom of Valencia, the Kingdom of Majorca, the Kingdom of Sicily, Malta, the Kingdom of Naples and Kingdom of Sardinia. For brief periods the Crown of Aragon also controlled Montpellier, Provence, Corsica, and the twin Duchy of Athens and Neopatras in Latin Greece.

In the Late Middle Ages, the southward territorial expansion of the Aragonese Crown in the Iberian Peninsula stopped in Murcia, which eventually consolidated as a realm of the Crown of Castile, the Kingdom of Murcia. Subsequently, the Aragonese Crown focused on the Mediterranean, governing as far afield as Greece and the Barbary Coast, whereas Portugal, which completed its southward expansion in 1249, would focus on the Atlantic Ocean. Mercenaries from the territories in the Crown, known as &quot;Almogavars&quot; participated in the creation of this Mediterranean empire, and later found employment in countries all across southern Europe.

The Crown of Aragon has been considered an empire which ruled in the Mediterranean for hundreds of years, with thalassocratic power to setting rules over the entire sea, (as documented, for instance, in the &quot;Llibre del Consolat del Mar&quot; or &quot;Book of the Consulate of the Sea&quot;, written in Catalan, is one of the oldest compilations of maritime laws in the world).

However, the different territories were only connected through the person of the monarch. A modern historian, Juan de Contreras y Lopez de Ayala, marquis of Lozoya, described the Crown of Aragon as being more like a confederacy than a centralised kingdom.

==History==
===Origin===
The Crown of Aragon originated in 1137, when the Kingdom of Aragon and the County of Barcelona (along with the County of Provence, Girona, Cerdanya, Osona and other territories) merged by dynastic union upon the marriage of Petronilla of Aragon and Raymond Berenguer IV of Barcelona; their individual titles combined in the person of their son Alfonso II of Aragon, who ascended to the throne in 1162. This union respected the existing institutions and parliaments of both territories. The combined state was initially known as &quot;Regno, Dominio et Corona Aragonum et Catalonie&quot; (only between 1286 and 1291), and later as &quot;Corona Regum Aragoniae&quot;, &quot;Corona Aragonum&quot; or simply &quot;Aragon&quot;.

Petronilla&#x27;s father King Ramiro, &quot;The Monk&quot; (reigned 1134–1137) who was raised in the Monastery of Saint Pons de Thomières, Viscounty of Béziers as a Benedictine monk was the youngest of three brothers. His brothers Peter I (reigned 1094–1104) and Alfonso I &quot;El Batallador&quot; (The Battler, reigned 1104–1134) had fought against Castile for hegemony in the Iberian peninsula. Upon the death of Alfonso I, the Aragonese nobility that campaigned close to him feared being overwhelmed by the influence of Castile. And so, Ramiro was forced to leave his monastic life and proclaim himself King of Aragon. He married Agnes, sister of the Duke of Aquitaine and betrothed his only daughter Petronilla of Aragon to Raymond Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The wedding agreement provided Berenguer with the title of &quot;Princeps Aragonum&quot; and &quot;Dominator Aragonensis&quot; (Ruler of the Kingdom and Commander of the Aragonese Military) but the title of King of Aragon was reserved for Ramiro II and Berenguer&#x27;s future sons.

Raymond Berenguer IV, the first ruler of the united dynasty, called himself Count of Barcelona and &quot;Prince of Aragon&quot;.

===Expansion===

Alfonso II inherited two realms and with them, two different expansion processes. The House of Jiménez looked south in a battle against Castile for the control of the middle valley of the Ebro in the Iberian peninsula. The House of Barcelona looked north to its origins, Occitania, where through family ties it had significant influence, especially in Toulouse, Provence and Foix, towards the south along the Mediterranean coast and towards the Mediterranean sea.

Soon, Alfonso II of Aragon and I of Barcelona committed to conquering Valencia as the Aragonese nobility demanded. Like his father, he gave priority to the expansion and consolidation of the House of Barcelona&#x27;s influence in Occitania.

Alfonso II signed the treaties of Cazorla, a multilateral treaty between Navarre, Aragon, León, Portugal, and Castile to redefine the frontiers and zones of expansion of each kingdom. Alfonso II assured Valencia by renouncing the Aragonese rights of annexing Murcia in exchange for securing the Aragonese frontier with Castile. This action should be seen as result of the aforementioned priority given over the Occitan and Catalan dominions of the Crown of Aragon.

From the ninth century, the dukes of Aquitaine, the kings of Navarre, the counts of Foix, the counts of Toulouse and the counts of Barcelona were rivals in their attempts at controlling the various counties of the Hispanic Marches and &quot;pays&quot; of Occitania. And the House of Barcelona succeeded in extending its influence to the area that is now south of France through strong family ties, in the areas of the County of Provence, County of Toulouse and County of Foix. The rebellion of the Cathars or Albigensians, who rejected the authority and teachings of the Catholic Church, led to the loss of these possessions in southern France. Pope Innocent III called upon Philip II of France to suppress the Albigensians—the Albigensian Crusade, which led to bringing Occitania firmly under the control of the King of France, and the Capetian dynasty from northern France.

Peter II of Aragon returned from the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in autumn 1212 to find that Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester, had conquered Toulouse, exiling Count Raymond VI of Toulouse, who was Peter&#x27;s brother-in-law and vassal. Peter&#x27;s army crossed the Pyrenees and arrived at Muret where they were joined by Raymond of Foix and Raymond of Toulouse&#x27;s forces, in September 1213 to confront Montfort&#x27;s army. The Battle of Muret began on 12 September 1213. The Catalan, Aragonese and Occitan forces were disorganised and disintegrated under the assault of Montfort&#x27;s squadrons. Peter himself was caught in the thick of fighting, and died as a result of a foolhardy act of bravado. Thus, the nobility of Toulouse, Foix and other vassals of the Crown of Aragon were defeated. The conflict concluded with the Treaty of Meaux-Paris in 1229, in which the Crown of Aragon agreed to renounce its rights over the south of Occitania with the integration of these territories into the dominions of the King of France.

King James I (13th century) returned to an era of expansion to the South, by conquering and incorporating Majorca, Ibiza, and a good share of the Kingdom of Valencia into the Crown. With the Treaty of Corbeil (1258), which was based upon the principle of natural frontiers, the Capetians were recognised as heirs of the Carolingian dynasty, and the Capetian king Louis IX renounced any historical claim of feudal overlordship over Catalonia. The general principle was clear, Catalan influence north of the Pyrenees, beyond the Roussillon, Vallespir, Conflent and Capcir, was to cease. James I had realized that wasting his forces and distracting his energies in attempts to keep a footing in France would only end in disaster. In January 1266, James I besieged and captured Murcia, then settled his own men, mostly Catalans, there; and handed Murcia over to Castile with the treaty of Cazorla.

The Kingdom of Majorca, including the Balearic Islands, and the counties of Cerdanya and Roussillon-Vallespir and the city of Montpellier, was held independently from 1276 to 1279 by James II of Majorca and as a vassal of the Crown of Aragon after that date until 1349, becoming a full member of the Crown of Aragon from 1349.

Valencia was finally made a new kingdom with its own institutions and not an extension of the Kingdom of Aragon as the Aragonese noblemen had intended since even before the creation of the Crown of Aragon. The Kingdom of Valencia became the third member of the Crown together with Aragon and the Principality of Catalonia. The Kingdom of Majorca had an independent status with its own kings until 1349.

In 1282, the Sicilians rose up against the second dynasty of the Angevins on the Sicilian Vespers and massacred the garrison soldiers throughout the island. Peter III responded to their call, and landed in Trapani to an enthusiastic welcome five months later. This caused Pope Martin IV to excommunicate the king, place Sicily under interdiction, and offer the kingdom of Aragon to a son of Philip III of France.

When Peter III refused to impose the &quot;Charters of Aragon&quot; in Valencia, the nobles and towns united in Zaragoza to demand a confirmation of their privileges, which the king had to accept in 1283. Thus began the Union of Aragon, which developed the power of the &quot;Justícia&quot; to mediate between the king and the Aragonese bourgeois. 

When James II of Aragon completed the conquest of the Kingdom of Valencia, the Crown of Aragon established itself as one of the major powers in Europe.

In 1297, to solve the dispute between the Anjevins and the Aragonese over Sicily, Pope Boniface VIII created &quot;ex novo&quot; a Kingdom of Sardinia and Corsica and entrusted it as a fief to the Aragonese King James II, ignoring already existing, indigenous states. In 1324, James II finally started to seize the Pisan territories in the former states of Cagliari and Gallura. In 1347 Aragon made war on the Genoese Doria and Malaspina houses, which controlled most of the lands of the former Logudoro state in north-western Sardinia, and added them to its direct domains. The Giudicato of Arborea, the only remaining independent Sardinian state, proved far more difficult to subdue. The rulers of Arborea developed the ambition to unite all of Sardinia under their rule and create a single Sardinian state, and at a certain point (1368–1388, 1392–1409) almost managed to drive the Aragonese out. The war between Arborea and Aragon was fought on and off for more than 100 years; this situation lasted until 1409, when the army of Arborea suffered a heavy defeat by the Aragonese army in the Battle of Sanluri; the capital Oristano was lost in 1410. After some years during which Arborean rulers failed to organise a successful resurgence, they sold their remaining rights for 100,000 gold florins, and by 1420 the Aragonese Kingdom of Sardinia finally extended throughout the island. The subduing of Sardinia having taken a century, Corsica, which had never been wrested from the Genoese, was dropped from the formal title of the Kingdom.

Through the marriage of Peter IV to Maria of Sicily (1381), the Kingdom of Sicily, as well as the duchies of Athens and Neopatria, were finally implemented more firmly into the Crown. The Greek possessions were permanently lost to Nerio I Acciaioli in 1388 and Sicily was dissociated in the hands of Martin I from 1395 to 1409, but the Kingdom of Naples was added finally in 1442 by the conquest led by Alfonso V.

The King&#x27;s possessions outside of the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands were ruled by proxy through local elites as petty kingdoms, rather than subjected directly to a centralised government. They were more an economic part of the Crown of Aragon than a political one.

The fact that the King was keen on settling new kingdoms instead of merely expanding the existing kingdoms was a part of a power struggle that pitted the interests of the king against those of the existing nobility. This process was also under way in most of the European states that successfully effected the transition to the Early Modern state. Thus, the new territories gained from the Moors—namely Valencia and Majorca—were given &quot;furs&quot; as an instrument of self-government in order to limit the power of nobility in these new acquisitions and, at the same time, increase their allegiance to the monarchy itself. The trend in the neighbouring kingdom of Castile was quite similar, both kingdoms giving impetus to the Reconquista by granting different grades of self-government either to cities or territories, instead of placing the new territories under the direct rule of nobility.

===Personal union with Castile===
In 1410, King Martin I died without living descendants or heirs. As a result, on the Compromise of Caspe, representatives from each Iberian state of the Crown, the kingdoms of Aragon, Valencia and the Principality of Catalonia, chose Ferdinand of Antequera from the Castilian dynasty of Trastámara as king of the Crown of Aragon as Ferdinand I of Aragon.

Later, his grandson King Ferdinand II of Aragon recovered the northern Catalan counties—Roussillon and Cerdagne—which had been lost to France as well as the Kingdom of Navarre, which had recently joined the Crown of Aragon but had been lost after internal dynastic disputes.

In 1469, Ferdinand married Infanta Isabella of Castile, half-sister of King Henry IV of Castile, who became Queen of Castile and León after Henry&#x27;s death in 1474. Their marriage was a dynastic union which became the constituent event for the dawn of the Monarchy of Spain. At that point both the Castile and the states of the Crown of Aragon remained distinct polities, each keeping its own traditional institutions, parliaments and laws. The process of territorial consolidation was completed when their grandson King Charles I, known as Emperor Charles V, in 1516 ruled over all of the kingdoms on the Iberian peninsula, save the Kingdoms of Portugal and the Algarve, under one monarch—his co-monarch and mother Queen Joanna I in confinement—thereby furthering the creation of the Spanish monarchy, albeit a composite and decentralized one.

===Dissolution===
The literary evocation of past splendour recalls correctly the great age of the 13th and 14th centuries, when Majorca, Valencia and Sicily were conquered, the population growth could be handled without social conflict, and the urban prosperity, which peaked in 1345, created the institutional and cultural achievements of the Crown.

The Aragonese crown&#x27;s wealth and power stagnated and its authority was steadily transferred to the new Spanish crown settled in Castile after that date—the demographic growth was partially offset by the expulsion of the Jews from Spain (1492), Muslims (1502) and the expulsion of the Moriscos (1609). It was unable to prevent the separation of Sicily and Naples due to the establishment of the Council of Italy, the loss of Roussillon in 1659 after the Reapers&#x27; War in the Principality of Catalonia, the loss of Minorca and its Italian domains in 1707–1716, and the imposition of French language on Roussillon (1700) and Castilian as the language of government in all the old Aragonese Crown lands in Spain (1707–1716).

The Crown of Aragon and its institutions and public law were abolished between 1707 and 1716 only after the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714) by the Nueva Planta decrees, issued by Philip V of Spain. The original political structure was swept away, the administration was subsumed into the Castilian laws, the states of the Crown of Aragon loss their status of separate entitites and were united formally with those of Castile to legally form a single state, the Kingdom of Spain, as it moved towards an absolutist centralized government under the new Bourbon dynasty.

===Nationalist revisionism===

Some of the nationalist movements in Spain consider the former kingdoms of the Crown of Aragon to be the foundation of their nations, the Catalan nationalist movement being the most prominent. Spanish nationalism, on the other hand, tends to place more importance on the later dynastic union with the Crown of Castile, considering it the origin of one Spanish nation.

The reprisals inflicted on the territories that had fought against Philip V in the War of Succession is given by some Valencian nationalists and Catalan nationalists as an argument against the centralism of Spanish nationalism and in favor of federalism, confederation, or even independence. Some Catalans associated their ancient political status with their Generalitat and resistance to Castile. Because restoration of &quot;fueros&quot; was one of its tenets, Carlism won support in the lands of the Crown of Aragon during the 19th century.

The Romanticism of the 19th century Catalan Renaixença movement evoked a &quot;Pyrenean realm&quot; that corresponded more to the vision of 13th century troubadours than to the historical reality of the Crown. This vision survives today as &quot;a nostalgic programme of politicised culture&quot;. Thus, the history of the Crown of Aragon remains a politically loaded topic in modern Spain, especially when it comes to asserting the level of independence enjoyed by constituents of the Crown, like the Principality of Catalonia, which is sometimes used to justify the level of autonomy (or independence) that should be enjoyed by contemporary Catalonia and other territories.

==Pennon==

The origin of Coat of arms of the Crown of Aragon is the familiar coat of the Counts of Barcelona and Kings of Aragon. The Pennon was used exclusively by the monarchs of the Crown and was expressive of their sovereignty. James III of Majorca, vassal of the Crown of Aragon, used a coat of arms with four bars, as seen on the Leges palatinae miniatures.

==Institutions==
As separate states united to the Crown under the &quot;aeque principaliter&quot; principle, Aragon, Catalonia and Valencia each had a legislative body, known as the &quot;Cortes&quot; in the Kingdom of Aragon (the Courts of Aragon) or &quot;Corts&quot; in the Principality of Catalonia (the Catalan Courts) and the Kingdom of Valencia (the Valencian Courts). A &quot;Diputación del General&quot; or &quot;Diputació del General&quot; was established in each, becoming known as a &quot;Generalidad&quot; in Aragon and &quot;Generalitat&quot; in Catalonia and Valencia.

From the 15th century onwards, every realm of the Crown was granted its own court of justice in the form of Royal Audience, resulting from the division of the Royal Court and the establishment of the Council of Aragon in its place. After the dynastic union with Castile and the establishment of the monarchs in that realm, the king began to be permanently represented in the realms of the Crown of Aragon by viceroys, one for each state, including Mallorca and Sardinia.

==Capital==
The house of the Crown was the Cathedral of the Savior of Zaragoza from Peter II (12th century). The General Courts of the Crown (the simultaneous meeting of the Courts of Catalonia, Aragon and Valencia) used to gather at Monzón (13th to 16th centuries), the remaining meetings took place at Fraga, Zaragoza, Calatayud and Tarazona. The councillor headquarters were located at Barcelona (13th to 16th centuries) and Naples during the kingdom of Alfonso V.

On the other hand, the General Archive of the Crown of Aragon (originally known as the Royal Archive of Barcelona), which was the official repository of royal documentation of the Crown since the reign of James II (14th century), has its seat in Barcelona, being founded in 1318, after the unification of the documentary deposits of the Kingdom of Aragon, located in the Monastery of Santa María de Sigena, and the one of the County of Barcelona, located in the house of the Knights Hospitaller of the city.

In the early 15th century, the de facto capital was Valencia until Alfonso V came to the throne.
During the 15th and the 16th centuries, the Crown&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; capital was Naples. After Alfonso V of Aragon, Ferdinand II of Aragon settled the capital in Naples. Alfonso, in particular, wanted to transform Naples into a real Mediterranean capital and lavished huge sums to embellish it further. Later the courts were itinerant until Philip II of Spain. The Spanish historian Domingo Buesa Conde has argued that Zaragoza ought to be considered the permanent political capital, but not the economic or administrative capital, owing to the obligation for kings to be crowned at the Cathedral of the Savior of Zaragoza.

== Culture ==
During the Crown of Aragon, the Catalan culture and language underwent a vigorous expansion. During the period of trade, Occitan-Catalan contributions to Maltese occurred.

King Fernando II and Queen Isabella, as the Catholic Monarchs who began the Inquisition, were contrary to the more plural development that preceded in the Crown of Aragon. The previous religious background was described as &quot;longstanding tradition of Mudejarism, the royal sanctioning and protection of subject Muslim populations within Christian realms.&quot; Aesthetic Mudéjar architecture of Aragon has been observed as demonstrating the influence of Andalusian and Arab culture in Aragon proper. Gothic architecture was also developed.

The Mediterranean Lingua Franca was a mixed language used widely for commerce and diplomacy and was also current among slaves of the bagnio, Barbary pirates and European renegades in precolonial Algiers. Among the speakers who created the language, also called Sabir, were Muslims from Aragon called &quot;Tagarins&quot; (a term mentioned by Miguel Cervantes). Historically, the first to use it were the Genoese and Venetian trading colonies in the eastern Mediterranean after the year 1000.

The similarities contribute to discussions of the classification of the Mediterranean Lingua Franca as a language. Although its official classification is that of a pidgin, some scholars adamantly oppose that classification and believe it would be better viewed as an interlanguage of Italian.

Linguist Steven Dworkin hypothesized that Catalan was the point of entry for Mediterranean Lingua Franca terms into Spain, arguably the source of several Italian and Arabic loanwords in Spanish, citing the DCECH.

==Composition==
The crown was made up of the following territories (which are nowadays parts of the modern countries of Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Malta, and Andorra).

<text>Xavier Sigalon (1787 – 18 August 1837) was a French painter. 
He was one of the few leaders of the romantic movement who cared more for treatment of form than of colour.

==Biography==

Xavier Sigalon was born in Uzès, Gard, towards the end of 1787, son of a poor rural schoolmaster.
With great difficulty he came to Paris and obtained admission to the studio of Pierre-Narcisse Guérin. 
He did not agree with the instruction he was given, and tried to train himself by studying the Italian masters in the gallery of the Louvre. 
In 1822 he exhibited &quot;The Young Courtesan&quot;, which at once attracted attention and was bought for the Luxembourg.

Sigalon continued to challenge himself, producing &quot;Locusta&quot; in 1824, and &quot;Athaliahs Massacre&quot; in 1827. 
Both these works showed incontestable power; but the &quot;Vision of St Jerôme&quot;, which appeared at the Salon of 1831, and the &quot;Crucifixion&quot;, were much the most individual of all his achievements.
In 1831 he received the cross of the Legion of Honour.
His paintings at this time, although powerful in their drawing and composition, were not colorful and did not sell. 
Sigalon found himself forced to earn a humble living by painting portraits.

In 1833 Adolphe Thiers, then minister of the interior, recalled Sigalon to Paris and entrusted him with the task of copying the Sistine fresco of &quot;The Last Judgement&quot; for a hall in the Palace of the Fine Arts. His friend François Souchon agreed to assist Sigalon in this huge task.
There was a dispute between the two artists, and Souchon returned to Paris.
He was replaced as Sigalon&#x27;s assistant by Numa Boucoiran.
When Sigalon exhibited his gigantic work in the Baths of Diocletian at Rome, he was visited in state by Gregory XVI.
Sigalon carried his copy back to Paris in February 1837.
He returned to Rome some time later to copy the pendants of the Sistine Chapel, but succumbed to an attack of cholera on 18 August 1837.

<text>Henry Denis Litton GBM, CBE, SC (Chinese: 烈顯倫; born 7 August 1934) is a retired judge in Hong Kong.

==Early life and education==
Born into a Eurasian family in Hong Kong, Henry Litton excelled in school during his early years first at the Diocesan Boys&#x27; School in Hong Kong and then in England which he was educated at King&#x27;s College, Taunton and Merton College, Oxford, where he graduated with honours in jurisprudence.

His father, John Letablere Litton (1903–1941), served as a gunner in the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps. He was killed in action on 18 December 1941 defending Hong Kong from Japanese attack, and was buried in Stanley Military Cemetery. His mother Enid Tak-ching Lo-Litton was a tennis player and won thirteen Hong Kong National Championships over a 24-year span. John&#x27;s maternal uncle was the lawyer Sir Lo Man-kam, part of a prominent Eurasian family.

Litton is linked to the Anglo-Irish / Huguenot Littons&#x27; clan from Dublin, whom came via Yorkshire and also to politician Edward Litton.

==Legal career==
After passing the Bar exam in 1959, Litton entered into private practice in Hong Kong where he was eminently successful as a trial lawyer. Litton was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1970 and co-founded the &quot;Hong Kong Law Journal&quot; with Gerald de Basto QC, another local barrister. He also served as Chairman of the Bar Association from 1971 to 1973, from 1977 to 1980 and again from 1983 to 1985.

Litton was appointed in 1987 an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for his contribution to the law and was elevated to the bench in 1992 as a Justice of Appeal. He rose steadily through the ranks, becoming Vice-President of the Court of Appeal in 1995 and a Permanent Judge of the Court of Final Appeal (Hong Kong&#x27;s court of last resort) in 1997, when British colonial rule in Hong Kong ended and China resumed its sovereignty over the region.

He assumed senior status three years later, citing personal reasons. Until 2015, he continued to hear cases on a part-time basis as a non-permanent judge of the Court he served.

In 2007, Litton was appointed a Judicial Commissioner, as well as a Justice of Appeal, of the Supreme Court of Brunei Darussalam.

==Post-judicial life==
In 2019, Litton released his book &quot;Is the Hong Kong Judiciary Sleepwalking to 2047?&quot;, in which he criticised numerous aspects of Hong Kong&#x27;s legal system, focusing particularly on the misuse of judicial reviews in recent years. He also argued that courts ought not serve as a “debating chamber” to challenge government policy.

Litton is known to be a great advocate of environmentalism; his wife Linda Siddall was a founder and Director of Friends of the Earth (HK) and Litton himself its patron. He is also an avid player of tennis. Litton&#x27;s son John continues the family&#x27;s legal eminence, practising at the London and Hong Kong bar since 1989, taking silk in 2010.

<text>Thomas Ponce Gill (April 21, 1922 – June 3, 2009) was a Hawaii politician. A member of the Democratic party, he served in the United States Congress from 1963 to 1965 and was the fourth lieutenant governor of Hawaii from 1966 to 1970. He unsuccessfully ran for governor twice, in 1970 and 1974.

==Early life==
Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, Gill attended public schools (Lincoln Elementary and Roosevelt High School). He was a decorated infantryman in the Pacific Theatre during World War II, earning a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart.

After the war, he attended law school at Boalt Hall at UC-Berkeley and began practicing law in Hawaii.

==Career==
Gill served in Hawaii&#x27;s territorial legislature and, after statehood in 1959, became a member of the first state house delegation, representing the 15th district until his time in Congress. He was elected to one of his state&#x27;s two Congressional seats in 1962 and served one term. In Congress, he was a staunch supporter of liberal causes, including civil rights. He then worked as the director of Hawaii&#x27;s Office of Economic Opportunity. In 1964, Gill chose not to seek reelection and instead ran unsuccessfully for U.S. Senator, losing to Republican incumbent Hiram Fong. In 1966, he was elected Lieutenant Governor with incumbent Governor John A. Burns.

During his term as Lieutenant Governor, Gill, considered outspoken and acerbic, developed differences with Burns, and was never shy about criticizing the incumbent, despite being part of his administration. In 1970, Gill challenged Burns in the Democratic primary. Gill ran as a reformer, campaigning against what he described as an entrenched, corrupt political machine. He narrowly lost, even though Burns significantly outspent him in a savvy campaign that included sophisticated use of expensive image-building television spots. Most in the state&#x27;s large Japanese population remained loyal to Burns, who had spearheaded their rise to political power during the 1950s. Before Governor Neil Abercrombie lost in 2014 this race stood as the closest anyone came to a primary defeat of an incumbent governor of Hawaii. Gill ran in the primary for governor again in 1974, but lost again in the primary to George Ariyoshi, who had succeeded him as lieutenant governor. After failing both campaigns, he resumed his career as a lawyer.

==Papers==

Thomas P. Gill donated 86 record center boxes of material to the University of Hawaii at Manoa Library in May 2001. The bulk of the papers cover Gill&#x27;s two years in Congress and four years in the Hawaii Lt. Governor&#x27;s office. The collection is rich in material documenting his enthusiastic political life and his concerns about nuclear power; the environment; land development, especially on the Big Island of Hawaii; social and economic justice; and the high cost of living in Hawaii. There is a smaller amount of material from his pre- and post-Congressional life.

The papers are arranged in five series: Political Offices (held by Gill), 1955–1970; Politics (Democratic Party, Hawaii and National), 1952–1972; Personal (election campaigns and biographical material), 1939–2001; Memorabilia (mostly election campaigns), 1940–2005 and bulk 1958–1980; Audiovisual (audiotapes, films, photographs; primarily election campaigns and Big Island development), 1958–1974.

The papers were arranged and described from July 2005 through March 2006 by archivist Ellen Chapman, and are available to researchers in the Library&#x27;s Archives &amp; Manuscripts Department by appointment. A Finding Aid, which provides a timeline, series descriptions, and list of specific topics covered in the collection is available at The Thomas P. Gill Papers web site.

==Personal life==
Gill was the son of Thomas Gill (born in New York in 1870) and Lorin Johnston Tarr (born in Kansas in 1889), and the grandson of Dr. Charles Robert Gill (born in New York in 1821) and María Dolores Ponce de León (born in Cuba in 1834 to Cuban parents).

Gill married Lois Hanawalt in 1947 and had six children, including three sons who have been involved in Hawaiian politics. His son Gary served on the Honolulu City Council, his son Tony is a labor lawyer who considered seeking the governorship in 2006, and his son Eric serves as an elected officer of UNITE HERE Local 5, representing workers at hotels and Kaiser Permanente.

Gill died in 2009 in Honolulu, aged 87.

<text>The Bayes factor is a ratio of two competing statistical models represented by their evidence, and is used to quantify the support for one model over the other. The models in question can have a common set of parameters, such as a null hypothesis and an alternative, but this is not necessary; for instance, it could also be a non-linear model compared to its linear approximation. The Bayes factor can be thought of as a Bayesian analog to the likelihood-ratio test, although it uses the integrated (i.e., marginal) likelihood rather than the maximized likelihood. As such, both quantities only coincide under simple hypotheses (e.g., two specific parameter values). Also, in contrast with null hypothesis significance testing, Bayes factors support evaluation of evidence &quot;in favor&quot; of a null hypothesis, rather than only allowing the null to be rejected or not rejected.

Although conceptually simple, the computation of the Bayes factor can be challenging depending on the complexity of the model and the hypotheses. Since closed-form expressions of the marginal likelihood are generally not available, numerical approximations based on MCMC samples have been suggested. A widely used approach is the method proposed by Chib (1995). Chib and Jeliazkov (2001) later extended this method to handle cases where Metropolis-Hastings samplers are used. For certain special cases, simplified algebraic expressions can be derived; for instance, the Savage–Dickey density ratio in the case of a precise (equality constrained) hypothesis against an unrestricted alternative. Another approximation, derived by applying Laplace&#x27;s approximation to the integrated likelihoods, is known as the Bayesian information criterion (BIC); in large data sets the Bayes factor will approach the BIC as the influence of the priors wanes. In small data sets, priors generally matter and must not be improper since the Bayes factor will be undefined if either of the two integrals in its ratio is not finite.

==Definition==
The Bayes factor is the ratio of two marginal likelihoods; that is, the likelihoods of two statistical models integrated over the prior probabilities of their parameters.

The posterior probability formula_1 of a model &quot;M&quot; given data &quot;D&quot; is given by Bayes&#x27; theorem:

:formula_2

The key data-dependent term formula_3 represents the probability that some data are produced under the assumption of the model &quot;M&quot;; evaluating it correctly is the key to Bayesian model comparison.

Given a model selection problem in which one wishes to choose between two models on the basis of observed data &quot;D&quot;, the plausibility of the two different models &quot;M&quot;1 and &quot;M&quot;2, parametrised by model parameter vectors formula_4 and formula_5, is assessed by the Bayes factor &quot;K&quot; given by

:formula_6

When the two models have equal prior probability, so that formula_7, the Bayes factor is equal to the ratio of the posterior probabilities of &quot;M&quot;1 and &quot;M&quot;2. If instead of the Bayes factor integral, the likelihood corresponding to the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter for each statistical model is used, then the test becomes a classical likelihood-ratio test. Unlike a likelihood-ratio test, this Bayesian model comparison does not depend on any single set of parameters, as it integrates over all parameters in each model (with respect to the respective priors). An advantage of the use of Bayes factors is that it automatically, and quite naturally, includes a penalty for including too much model structure. It thus guards against overfitting. For models where an explicit version of the likelihood is not available or too costly to evaluate numerically, approximate Bayesian computation can be used for model selection in a Bayesian framework,
with the caveat that approximate-Bayesian estimates of Bayes factors are often biased.

Other approaches are:
* to treat model comparison as a decision problem, computing the expected value or cost of each model choice;
* to use minimum message length (MML).
* to use minimum description length (MDL).

== Interpretation ==
A value of &quot;K&quot; &gt; 1 means that &quot;M&quot;1 is more strongly supported by the data under consideration than &quot;M&quot;2. Note that classical hypothesis testing gives one hypothesis (or model) preferred status (the &#x27;null hypothesis&#x27;), and only considers evidence &quot;against&quot; it. The fact that a Bayes factor can produce evidence &quot;for&quot; and not just against a null hypothesis is one of the key advantages of this analysis method. 

Harold Jeffreys gave a scale (Jeffreys&#x27; scale) for interpretation of formula_8:
! &quot;K&quot; !! dHart !! bits !! Strength of evidence
| &lt; 100 || &lt; 0 || &lt; 0 || Negative (supports &quot;M&quot;2)
| 100 to 101/2 || 0 to 5 || 0 to 1.6 || Barely worth mentioning
| 101/2 to 101 || 5 to 10 || 1.6 to 3.3 || Substantial
| 101 to 103/2 || 10 to 15 || 3.3 to 5.0 || Strong
| 103/2 to 102 || 15 to 20 || 5.0 to 6.6 || Very strong
| &gt; 102 || &gt; 20 || &gt; 6.6 || Decisive
|}

The second column gives the corresponding weights of evidence in decihartleys (also known as decibans); bits are added in the third column for clarity. The table continues in the other direction, so that, for example, formula_9 is decisive evidence for formula_10.

An alternative table, widely cited, is provided by Kass and Raftery (1995):
! log10 &quot;K&quot; !! &quot;K&quot; !! Strength of evidence
| 0 to 1/2 || 1 to 3.2 || Not worth more than a bare mention
| 1/2 to 1 || 3.2 to 10 || Substantial
| 1 to 2 || 10 to 100 || Strong
| &gt; 2 || &gt; 100 || Decisive
|}
According to I. J. Good, the just-noticeable difference of humans in their everyday life, when it comes to a change degree of belief in a hypothesis, is about a factor of 1.3x, or 1 deciban, or 1/3 of a bit, or from 1:1 to 5:4 in odds ratio.

==Example==
Suppose we have a random variable that produces either a success or a failure. We want to compare a model &quot;M&quot;1 where the probability of success is &quot;q&quot; = , and another model &quot;M&quot;2 where &quot;q&quot; is unknown and we take a prior distribution for &quot;q&quot; that is uniform on [0,1]. We take a sample of 200, and find 115 successes and 85 failures. The likelihood can be calculated according to the binomial distribution:

:formula_11

Thus we have for &quot;M&quot;1

:formula_12

whereas for &quot;M&quot;2 we have

:formula_13

The ratio is then 1.2, which is &quot;barely worth mentioning&quot; even if it points very slightly towards &quot;M&quot;1.

A frequentist hypothesis test of &quot;M&quot;1 (here considered as a null hypothesis) would have produced a very different result. Such a test says that &quot;M&quot;1 should be rejected at the 5% significance level, since the probability of getting 115 or more successes from a sample of 200 if &quot;q&quot; = is 0.02, and as a two-tailed test of getting a figure as extreme as or more extreme than 115 is 0.04. Note that 115 is more than two standard deviations away from 100. Thus, whereas a frequentist hypothesis test would yield significant results at the 5% significance level, the Bayes factor hardly considers this to be an extreme result. Note, however, that a non-uniform prior (for example one that reflects the fact that you expect the number of success and failures to be of the same order of magnitude) could result in a Bayes factor that is more in agreement with the frequentist hypothesis test.

A classical likelihood-ratio test would have found the maximum likelihood estimate for &quot;q&quot;, namely formula_14, whence 
:formula_15 
(rather than averaging over all possible &quot;q&quot;). That gives a likelihood ratio of 0.1 and points towards &quot;M&quot;2.

&quot;M&quot;2 is a more complex model than &quot;M&quot;1 because it has a free parameter which allows it to model the data more closely. The ability of Bayes factors to take this into account is a reason why Bayesian inference has been put forward as a theoretical justification for and generalisation of Occam&#x27;s razor, reducing Type I errors.

On the other hand, the modern method of relative likelihood takes into account the number of free parameters in the models, unlike the classical likelihood ratio. The relative likelihood method could be applied as follows. Model &quot;M&quot;1 has 0 parameters, and so its Akaike information criterion (AIC) value is formula_16. Model &quot;M&quot;2 has 1 parameter, and so its AIC value is formula_17. Hence &quot;M&quot;1 is about formula_18 times as probable as &quot;M&quot;2 to minimize the information loss. Thus &quot;M&quot;2 is slightly preferred, but &quot;M&quot;1 cannot be excluded.

<text>Charles Arthur Ching (, 7 October 1935–30 November 2000) was a judge in Hong Kong.

Born Charles Arthur Ching into an intellectual family in Hong Kong, Ching was educated in Hong Kong and England. He was a scholar both at King&#x27;s College, Taunton and at University College, Oxford, where he graduated with honours in jurisprudence.

After passing his bar exam in 1959, Ching commenced his practice of law in Hong Kong, and was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1974. During this period, he was regarded by some as the most successful barrister in Hong Kong&#x27;s history.

Ching was later appointed to the Court of Appeal in 1995 and the Court of Final Appeal in 1997, where he served with distinction. He resigned in 2000 for health reasons and died soon after. A scholarship named after him was set up by the Hong Kong Bar Association. Throughout his career both as advocate and as judge Mr. Justice Ching was an advocate for the merging of the legal professions in Hong Kong (barristers and solicitors).

Ngeny first came to international prominence by setting two world junior records in 1997—3:32.91 for 1500 m in Monaco and 3:50.41 for the Mile in Nice, and under the guidance of renowned manager and coach, the late Kim McDonald, his progression continued in 1998, improving his 1500 m time to 3:30.34 in Monaco.

On 7 July 1999, in Roma, Ngeny was second to Hicham El Guerrouj when the latter set the world record (3:43.13) for the mile run. Ngeny stayed close to El Guerrouj down the stretch to finish at 3:43.40, still the second-fastest mile ever run , and almost a full second inside the old world record (3:44.39) of Noureddine Morceli.

On 24 August 1999, Ngeny took the 1500 m silver medal (3:28.73) in the IAAF 1999 World Championships in Athletics in Seville, Spain, behind the reigning world champion El Guerrouj (3:27.65).

On 5 September 1999, Ngeny set the world record 2:11.96 over 1000 m in Rieti, Italy, breaking the 18-years-standing record 2:12.18 set by Sebastian Coe in 1981. Ngeny&#x27;s time of 2:11.96 still stands as the world record, where only 3 athletes (Taoufik Makhloufi, Jake Wightman, and Abubaker Kaki) have come within 2 seconds of the time since. The previous record had been the oldest standing record at the time and was the last remaining world record held by Sebastian Coe to be broken. It was also the last world record of any running distance that had not been previously held by an athlete of African descent.

In 1999 Ngeny recorded six sub 3:30 clockings for 1500 m and established himself as the closest rival to world champion and world record holder El Guerrouj.

On 11 August 2000, Ngeny finished second to El Guerrouj (3:27.21) in the 1500 m at the Weltklasse Zürich meet in a time of 3:28.12, making him the Kenyan record holder and third-fastest ever in the event. This record was surpassed by Bernard Lagat&#x27;s 3:26.34 in Brussels on 24 August 2001. Lagat achieved this record when he finished 2nd behind Hicham El Guerrouj (3:26.12).

===Sydney triumph===
On 29 September 2000, at the 1500 m final of 2000 Sydney Olympics, El Guerrouj, world record holder and twice world champion, had only been defeated once since the previous Olympics, and was the overwhelming favourite. The two rivals led the race going into the last lap of the final, El Guerrouj leading Ngeny. With less than 100 m to go, Ngeny started moving next to the leader, grabbing the lead with just 15 m to go. He held on until the finish line, causing one of the greatest upsets at the Sydney Olympics.

In the process, Ngeny set an Olympic record of 3:32.07, surpassing Sebastian Coe&#x27;s Olympic record of 3:32.53, set in 1984. El Guerrouj settled for silver in 3:32.32 and Ngeny&#x27;s compatriot Bernard Lagat, another Kenyan runner at that time, later a US citizen, took bronze in 3:32.44.

Ngeny became the third Kenyan to win the 1500 m crown following Kip Keino (1968 Mexico City Olympics) and Peter Rono (1988 Seoul Olympics).

The year 2000 was the highlight of Ngeny&#x27;s running career. He posted career bests of 1:44.49 for 800 m (28 July 2000 in Oslo) and 3:28.12 for 1500 m (at the Weltklasse Zürich on 11 August 2000), en route to his Olympic triumph (29 September 2000).

As of October 2019, his career best time of 3:28.12 at Zürich makes him the seventh-fastest 1500m runner of all time, behind El Guerrouj, Lagat, Noureddine Morceli, Jakob Ingebrigtsen, Silas Kiplagat and Asbel Kiprop.

===After Sydney===
Ngeny was dropped from the Kenyan team for the 2001 World Championships in Edmonton after defying instructions from the national federation to return home from Britain where he trained.

Ngeny returned to Australia in 2001 to win the Goodwill Games Mile in Brisbane. A car crash in Kenya in November of that year put him out of action for much of the winter. The injury sustained in the car accident (injury to the back and pelvis) dogged Ngeny ever since. He competed sparsely in 2003 and 2004 recording a best time of 3:33.38 but failing in his attempt to qualify for the Kenyan Olympic team, and was not able to defend his title in Athens. Ngeny did not run at the Kenyan trials for the 2003 World Championships because of the injuries.

Ngeny announced his official retirement from international athletics on 22 November 2006.

After retirement, he has been an athletics coach for Kenya Defence Forces.

Ngeny would eventually become an athletes&#x27; representative for Kenya. In 2016, he quit his post in protest of the poor response of Kenyan representatives to a doping crisis.

<text>Western Gunfighters is the name of two American Western-anthology comic book series published by Marvel Comics and its 1950s forerunner, Atlas Comics.

The initial Atlas series ran eight issues, from 1956 to 1957, and featured artists including Gene Colan, Reed Crandall, Joe Maneely, John Severin, Alex Toth, Al Williamson, and Wally Wood, with many stories written by Stan Lee.

Volume two, published by Marvel from 1970 to 1975, consisted mostly of Western reprints but also featured new material, including stories of the masked Old West hero Ghost Rider and the introductions of such short-lived Western features as &quot;Gunhawk&quot; and &quot;Renegades&quot;, by writers including Gary Friedrich and Superman co-creator Jerry Siegel, and artists including Dick Ayers and Tom Sutton.

==Publication history==

===Atlas Comics===
Marvel Comics&#x27; first comic book titled &quot;Western Gunfighters&quot; was an anthology series published by the company&#x27;s 1950s forerunner, Atlas Comics. It premiered with issue #20 (cover-dated June 1956), taking over the numbering of a previous Atlas series, &quot;Apache Kid&quot;, the star of which did not go on to appear in the revamped book. Atlas editor-in-chief Stan Lee wrote many of the stories, generally signing them. The artwork included at least two stories each by Dave Berg, Vic Carrabotta, Gene Colan, and Don Heck, and one story each from Reed Crandall, Russ Heath. Angelo Torres, Alex Toth, Al Williamson, Wally Wood, and George Woodbridge. Most covers were by John Severin or Joe Maneely. It ran through issue #27 (Aug. 1957).

The series was one of several Atlas Western anthologies that included &quot;Frontier Western&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke Western&quot;, &quot;Western Thrillers&quot;, and &quot;Wild Western&quot;; and two successor series that took over its numbering, &quot;Cowboy Action&quot; and &quot;Quick-Trigger Western&quot;.

===Marvel Comics===
Marvel&#x27;s second series of that name was a Western anthology that ran 33 issues (Aug. 1970 - Nov. 1975) and used an almost identical cover logo. Primarily consisting of reprints of Atlas / Marvel Western stories, it also ran new material through issue #7 (Jan. 1972), with the feature &quot;Ghost Rider&quot;, a continuation of Marvel&#x27;s 1967 series, headlining. These first seven issues were 68- or 52-page, 25¢ &quot;giants&quot;, relative to the typical 15¢ comics of the times, with #8-on published as standard 36-page comics at the prevailing price of 20¢, rising to 25¢ by the time it ended publication.

The premiere issue featured a 10-page Ghost Rider story by the character&#x27;s 1960s team of writer Gary Friedrich and penciler Dick Ayers, and introduced three new features:
*&quot;Gunhawk&quot;, created by writer Jerry Siegel, the co-creator of Superman, and penciler Werner Roth, starred an initially unnamed Old West bounty hunter. The 10-page story marked the first professional comic-book work of artist Sal Buscema, the inker. After Ghost Rider-Gunhawk team-up stories in issues #4-5, the &quot;Gunhawk&quot; feature ran in issues #5-7. After a 28-year hiatus, Gunhawk, his name now given as Lee Barnett, co-starred in the 2000 miniseries &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot;, where he is killed after murdering Kid Colt by shooting him in the back. Marvel predecessor Atlas Comics had published a short-lived Western title, &quot;The Gunhawk&quot;, from 1950-1951, starring an unrelated character named Red Larabee.
*&quot;Tales of Fort Rango&quot;, by writer Friedrich and artist Syd Shores, starred a post-Civil War U.S. Army officer, Major Brett Sabre, sent to instill order at an undisciplined fort in The Dakotas. The feature did not continue, though the locale of Fort Rango reappeared in the first six issues of &quot;Red Wolf&quot;, starring a Native American hero. Saber returned decades later in a single 10-page feature, &quot;The Man from Fort Rango!&quot;, in the one-shot &quot;Western Legends&quot; #1 (Sept. 2006).
*&quot;Renegades&quot;, created by writers Roy Thomas and Mike Friedrich (no relation to Gary Friedrich) and artist Tom Sutton, concerned a quartet sent out by Colonel William Travis from the Alamo to seek reinforcements, and unjustly branded as cowards. The foursome&#x27;s only subsequent appearances were in issues #4-5.
*In addition, issue #4 included the one-off &quot;The Outcast&quot;, about a &quot;half-breed&quot; Caucasian-Native American. According to a note at the story&#x27;s end, the feature was &quot;conceived by Roy Thomas and executed by [penciler Barry Windsor-]Smith and [writer Steve] Parkhouse nearly two years ago!&quot;

In issue #6, Marvel&#x27;s original Western Ghost Rider, Carter Slade, was killed saving his brother Lincoln, a U.S. marshal. In the following issue, his place was taken by his young friend and sidekick, Jaime Jacobs, who was almost immediately killed in action. In that same story, Lincoln Slade became the third Ghost Rider.

Reprinted backup features in the first seven issues variously starred the Apache Kid, the Western Kid, Wyatt Earp, and the Black Rider (renamed Black Mask). The series thereafter became all-reprint. Issues #8-9 featured Black Mask as the lead feature, plus the Apache Kid and the Outlaw Kid. Issues #10-15 swapped gunfighter Matt Slade for the Outlaw Kid. From #16 through the final issue, #33, the lineup was Kid Colt as the starring feature, plus the Apache Kid and the Western Kid, the latter dropping that handle and going by his regular name, Tex Dawson, in a feature called &quot;Gun-Slinger&quot;.

Herb Trimpe penciled most of the initial seven issues&#x27; covers, with Ayers supplying two and John Severin one. The bulk of the reprint issues&#x27; covers were by Gil Kane, with Severin drawing #8-10. The remainder were by a smattering of artists, including Jim Steranko (#14, March 1973).

<text>Victoria Lynn Rowell (born May 10, 1959) is an American actress, screenwriter, director, and producer. She began her career as a ballet dancer and model before making her acting debut in the 1987 comedy film &quot;Leonard Part 6&quot;. In 1990, Rowell joined the cast of the CBS daytime soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; as Drucilla Winters, her signature and longest role on television, for which she was nominated for three Daytime Emmy Awards. She departed from the show in 2007. Rowell is also well known for her role as Dr. Amanda Bentley in the CBS medical crime drama &quot;&quot; (1993–2001). From 1993 to 2000, she appeared on both series simultaneously.

Rowell has had a number of roles in feature films. She starred alongside Eddie Murphy in the 1992 comedy &quot;The Distinguished Gentleman&quot;, and later had roles in the films &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; (1994) and &quot;Barb Wire&quot; (1996). She is an 11-time NAACP Image Awards winner.

== Early life ==
Victoria Lynn Rowell was born in Portland, Maine, on May 10, 1959. Her biological mother, Dorothy Rowell, was of English descent and a &quot;Mayflower&quot; descendant, and her birth father, whose surname was Wilson, was of Jamaican descent. Rowell knew very little about her father. Dorothy, who suffered from schizophrenia, took a taxi to a hospital to give birth to Rowell, leaving a son and two small daughters unsupervised. When she was 16 days old, Rowell, along with her two sisters, Sheree and Lori, were surrendered to child services.

While living in Maine with foster parents Agatha C. and Robert Armstead, Rowell, then eight, began ballet lessons. She became a member of Sigma Gamma Rho sorority, an African-American Greek-lettered sorority. After dancing with the American Ballet Theater II and the Juilliard School of Music Dance Extension program with Antony Tudor, Rowell accepted guest-artist teaching posts in New England.

== Career ==
In the 1980s, Rowell became an in-demand runway and catalog model. Rowell made her film debut in the 1987 comedy film &quot;Leonard Part 6&quot; opposite Bill Cosby and later had a recurring role on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; In 1988, she also had the recurring role of Nella Franklin on the CBS daytime soap opera, &quot;As the World Turns&quot;.

In 1990, Rowell was cast as street urchin-turned-ballet dancer Drucilla Barber on the CBS daytime soap opera, &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. Rowell became a fan favorite and was nominated for three Daytime Emmy Awards in 1996, 1997, and 1998. She won 11 NAACP Image Awards for her portrayal of Drucilla. Rowell&#x27;s first run as Drucilla was from 1990 to 1998. She briefly returned in 2000, then returned on a regular basis from 2002 until early 2007. In 2007, Rowell became unhappy with the soap opera behind the scenes, labeling daytime television and &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; as racist for not having enough African-American cast and crew. She also argued the directions of her storylines which were not heard, prompting her to leave. Within the storyline, Drucilla fell off a cliff and was presumed dead as her body was never found. Rowell has openly expressed pleasure in returning, and due to the character&#x27;s strong appeal and popularity, viewers have begged the series to rehire her. However, CBS has stated that having Drucilla return is not the creative decision they are looking for, which has disappointed fans of the actress. In 2014, Rowell posted a series of tweets criticizing the show for not having enough African-Americans in decision-making positions. &quot;Young &amp; Restless on air for 40 years, loyally watched by their absolute competitive-edge audience (blacks) &amp; not one black Exec producer?&quot; – she tweeted. Her tweets coincided with the series&#x27; 41st anniversary.

From 1993 to 2001, Rowell starred as Dr. Amanda Bentley in the CBS primetime series &quot;Diagnosis: Murder&quot;, opposite Dick Van Dyke, replacing Cynthia Gibb from the original made-for-television movie. For much of Rowell&#x27;s stint on &quot;&quot;, she was working on that show and on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; simultaneously. One episode of &quot;Diagnosis Murder&quot; centered around murder on the set of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;; Rowell was featured as both Amanda and Drucilla in that episode. The series run from 1993 to 2001, producing 178 episodes and two television movies, aired after the series&#x27; cancellation. &quot;Diagnosis: Murder&quot; has also run in syndication as of 1997.

In 1990s, Rowell co-starred in several films. She had the role of Eddie Murphy&#x27;s character&#x27;s love interest in the 1992 comedy film, &quot;The Distinguished Gentleman&quot;. In 1994, she played FBI agent Beth Jordan in comedy film &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;. She co-starred opposite Mario Van Peebles in the science-fiction crime film &quot;Full Eclipse&quot; (1993), and had a major role in the box office failure action film &quot;Barb Wire&quot; (1996) with Pamela Anderson. In 1997 she appeared in the critically acclaimed drama film, &quot;Eve&#x27;s Bayou&quot;. In the 2000s, she appeared in the number of small films, such as &quot;Motives&quot; and &quot;A Perfect Fit&quot;. In 2006, she co-starred as Samuel L. Jackson&#x27;s character wife in &quot;Home of the Brave&quot;. She also had the recurring roles on &quot;Single Ladies&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;.

In spring 2009, Rowell signed a six-figure deal with Atria Books for a book about the world of daytime TV. She released her memoirs called &quot;The Women Who Raised Me: A Memoir&quot; in 2008. She later released &quot;Secrets of a Soap Opera Diva: A Novel&quot; (2010) &quot;The Young and the Ruthless: Back in the Bubbles&quot; (2013).

Rowell created, directed, produced and starred in the comedy series &quot;The Rich and the Ruthless&quot;. The series premiered in 2017 and ended in 2021. In 2018 she also created miniseries &quot;Jacqueline and Jilly&quot; for Urban Movie Channel. In 2020 she made her feature directorial debut with &quot;Everything Is Fine&quot;. She later directed films &quot;A Rich Christmas&quot; (2021) starring Bill Bellamy for BET+, &quot;Stranger Next Door&quot; (2022) starring Vicky Jeudy and Skyh Black for Lifetime, &quot;Montross: Blood Rules&quot; (2022) for TV One, &quot;Catfish Christmas&quot; (2022), and &quot;Blackjack Christmas&quot; (2022) for BET+. In 2022 she made her return to CBS with a recurring role in the medical drama &quot;Good Sam&quot;. In 2024 she co-starred alongside Diane Keaton, Kathy Bates and Alfre Woodard in the comedy film &quot;Summer Camp&quot;.

== Legal issues ==
In February 2015, Rowell filed a lawsuit against CBS, Sony Pictures Television, Bell Dramatic Serial Company, and Bell-Phillip Television Production Inc, alleging racial discrimination and retaliation. In the suit, Rowell alleges that since 2010 she had made several attempts to be re-employed at &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; or employed at sister soap, &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;, but was repeatedly denied due to her outspokenness regarding the lack of diversity both in front of and behind the cameras at CBS. The same day the suit was filed, CBS released a statement saying that Rowell left the cast of her own initiative, the suit was without merit, and they would vigorously defend the case. In June 2015, Rowell&#x27;s legal team filed a declaration in furtherance of the lawsuit. In the declaration, Rowell alleges that she was the target of racially motivated attacks on the set of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, at the hands of former co-stars, Michelle Stafford, Melody Thomas Scott, and Peter Bergman. In November 2015, the judge presiding over the case dismissed the suit without prejudice. Rowell&#x27;s legal team resubmitted an amended claim that included an allegation against Corday Productions and Sony Pictures Television alleging that she pursued a role on the Sony and Corday produced NBC soap &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, but was removed from the audition list. In June 2016, the judge again dismissed the previous claims against CBS and Bell-Phillip Television Production Inc., allowing Rowell to continue the suit against Corday Productions and Sony Pictures Television. In February 2017, it was reported the case had been settled.

In September 2018, in the wake of Les Moonves&#x27; resignation as the chairman and CEO of CBS due to sexual misconduct allegations, Rowell took to her Twitter account to directly accuse Moonves of hindering her career. Partially quoting Moonves&#x27; statement denying the accusations that he attempted to damage the careers of certain women, she tweeted: &quot;And I have never used my position to hinder the advancement or careers of women,&quot; Moonves responded. #LIAR. Your loafer heel has been on my neck for over 11 years all because I cited a lack of substantive of diversity at CBS behind the camera #MeToo #RetaliationIsIllegal #Bully 

== Personal life ==

Rowell&#x27;s first marriage was to Tom Fahey in 1989. They had a daughter, Maya, and divorced the following year. Rowell had a long-term relationship with musician Wynton Marsalis; and they had a son, Jasper. In May 2008, Rowell announced her engagement to Radcliffe Bailey, an Atlanta artist, at her annual High Tea at Noon fundraiser. Rowell and Radcliffe married on June 27, 2009, in Dublin, New Hampshire. On January 2, 2014, Bailey filed for divorce from Rowell.

=== Work with foster children ===
In 1990, Rowell founded the &quot;Rowell Foster Children Positive Plan,&quot; which gives emotional support and financial aid to foster children, especially to those who aspire to become actors and dancers – the road Rowell took. In 2004, she was a special guest on the talk show &quot;Dr. Phil&quot;, in which she gave an emancipated foster child a chance at a job with Sony, dental care, and a scholarship from her foundation.

In May 2006, Rowell was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters by the University of Southern Maine in recognition of her work for the benefit of foster children. In 2007, Rowell published a memoir of her life that focused on her time in foster care. Entitled &quot;The Women Who Raised Me&quot;, Rowell discusses all of the foster mothers who cared for her and for her sisters. She also pays tribute to the women in a documentary film, &quot;The Mentor,&quot; that she participated in. Rowell says that she began writing the book when &quot;Y&amp;R&quot; turned down her offer to write for the show. She began a national book tour in April 2007.

In March 2008, Rowell was the first recipient of the Gift of Adoption Celebration of Adoption Award, an award given to individuals or groups who are helping to unite children with adoptive families.

In March 2012, Rowell&#x27;s book, &quot;Tag, Toss &amp; Run: 40 Classic Lawn Games&quot;, co-authored with environmental activist Paul Tukey, was released.

<text>Joseph James Fern (August 25, 1872 – February 20, 1920) was the first Mayor of Honolulu from 1909 to 1915 and again from 1917 to 1920. During and after his tenure, Fern became one of the most beloved political figures in the Territory of Hawaii. He was one of the first members of the Hawai&#x27;i Democratic Party.

==Early years==
Fern was born on the Big Island of Hawaii to James Fern and Kaipua Kaipo Luahoomae on August 25, 1872. In 1885, Fern worked in the town of Kohala at the Union Mill Plantation. In 1892, he moved to the island of Oahu to work at the Hawaiian Tramways Company, driving trolleys and streetcars through downtown Honolulu. In 1894, Fern traded jobs to work as a ship&#x27;s master at the Wilder Steamship Company.

==Political career==
At the time the Democratic Party had been deadlocked with infighting although Fern could not be free from the feuds he preferred to avoid them. In 1907, Fern was influenced to run for a seat on the Honolulu Board of Supervisors. He won the election and served for two years before the creation of the office of Mayor of Honolulu. The office of mayor was created upon the insistence of Washington, D.C., despite the opposition of the Big Five oligarchy that dominated the economy of Hawaii. Fern was multilingual, speaking Hawaiian, English, Japanese, Chinese, and Portuguese and used it to his advantage throughout his political career. Another advantage he had was with his avoidance of the Democratic infighting he made few enemies which resulted in relatively united support by Democrats for Fern. On January 4, 1909, Fern won the special election for the newly created mayor&#x27;s office by a margin of 7 votes and re-elected in the regular elections in 1910 with a margin of less than 100 votes. In 1915, he lost a reelection bid against Hawaii Republican Party member John Lane. After leaving office Fern was appointed City Jailer by Sheriff Charles Rose. When Lane tried to run for reelection, Fern challenged his successor again and won by 300 votes.

==Family life==
He married Julia Natua in 1889 and had two children: Julia, James. In 1894, he married Sheba Kaiheku&#x27;i Alapai (died 1910) with whom he had twelve children: Joseph James, Mary K., Nancy K., George, Kaipo, Elizabeth, Marion, Mary, Keo, Santa Clara, Henry C., Esta. In 1910, he married Emma Keliikekukahilikaleleokalahikiolaokalani Smith. They had one child, Victoria Kukahilihiapoaliilani.

==Death and legacy==
Fern died from complications with diabetes, while still in office. At the beginning of 1920 Fern came down with a high fever and he took several sick leaves. On February 9 he was admitted to Queen&#x27;s Medical Center, Fern died there February 20, 1920. Evidence of his popularity among the people he served, Fern was granted a state funeral and was laid in the throne room of ʻIolani Palace. During the burial rites at the King Street Catholic Cemetery, the United States Army Air Corps presented a fly-over ceremony in a v-formation.

Fern Elementary school in the Kalihi neighborhood in Honolulu was named after him.

<text>Mutants &amp; Masterminds (abbreviated &quot;M&amp;M&quot; or &quot;MnM&quot;) is a superhero role-playing game written by Steve Kenson and published by Green Ronin Publishing based on a variant of the d20 System by Wizards of the Coast. The game system is designed to allow players to create virtually any type of hero or villain desired.

==History==
In the late 1990s, Steve Kenson had an idea for a superhero setting that he had been contracted to produce. Through a series of misfortunes, the project fell through, and he was left with a partially completed manuscript. Shopping it around to various publishers, none were interested (superhero game popularity had declined at that time) until he talked to Chris Pramas (President of Green Ronin Publishing) about the setting.

Pramas made the offer to publish the setting if Kenson would also create a superhero game system based on the d20 System. Kenson agreed and began work. Over time, it became clear to him that the game would need to be released only under the Open Game License. Releasing the game under the d20 Standard Trademark License, as originally planned, would have prohibited the inclusion of ability generation and character advancement rules. Presenting a complete game was seen as taking precedence over having a d20 logo on the product, so the decision was made to use the OGL without the d20 license.

&quot;Mutants &amp; Masterminds&quot; was published in 2002; the setting, which was once known as &quot;Century City&quot;, became &quot;Freedom City&quot;. The first edition of &quot;M&amp;M&quot; books featured graphic design and art direction by the design studio Super Unicorn, but other firms provide the artwork on all subsequent releases.

A second edition of the &quot;Mutants &amp; Masterminds&quot; system debuted at Gen Con in 2005 and saw wide release in October of that year.

A third edition of &quot;Mutants &amp; Masterminds&quot; was released in 2011 and it has also been translated to Italian by Kaizoku Press. In the previous year, Green Ronin Publishing had released another superhero role-playing game, &quot;DC Adventures&quot;. Both games have the same mechanical system and are fully compatible.

==System==
&quot;Mutants &amp; Masterminds&quot;&#x27; game mechanics use a highly modified version of the d20 System. Differences include changes to character creation, injury and damage, hit points, the addition of &quot;hero points&quot; and super powers, the elimination of character classes and attacks of opportunity, a modified skill list, a very different feat selection, and that any equipment possessed is considered a part of the character and purchased in a manner similar to powers.

===Power Level===
&quot;M&amp;M&quot; characters are not class-based nor do they technically have class levels. Instead, they have a Power Level (or &quot;PL&quot;), and typically a character begins at Power Level 10 instead of Level 1. This allows a character to begin as an already established superhero with incredible abilities. The power level represents the maximum rank of any combat abilities a character can purchase. Each power level typically grants a character an allotment of points to purchase attribute levels, base attack and defense bonuses, saving throws, feats, skill ranks and super powers, though the game encourages game masters to modify the number of points given per level up or down to reflect the style of game they wish to run. All aspects of the character, including abilities, feats, skills, powers, and equipment, are purchased from this pool of points.

The &quot;M&amp;M&quot; power level restricts the maximum bonus held by skill ranks, ability scores, and most feats and powers. Beyond limiting bonuses, power level does nothing to restrict a character&#x27;s power; a power level 10 character can have a maximum strength of 40.

===Toughness saves===
Damage in &quot;M&amp;M&quot; is handled differently as well. &quot;M&amp;M&quot; does not use hit points. Instead, characters have a fourth saving throw called the &quot;toughness save&quot; which is based on their Constitution scores, like the fortitude save. Weapons and powers that do lethal and subdual damage do not roll any dice to determine damage. Instead, damaging attacks are ranked based upon their overall power. For example, a fairly fit but normal human may throw a punch that inflicts +1N (non-lethal) damage, while an irradiated simian mastermind with enhanced strength and razor-sharp claws throws out +12L (lethal) damage. When a character is struck by an attack, they roll a toughness save against a target number equal to the rank of the attack plus 15. Success allows the character to shrug off the attack with minimal effect, while failure results in injury according to the degree of failure and the type of damage. Accumulated damage applies a penalty to further saves, increasing the chances of any given attack knocking out the character.

This system of damage is meant to model the nature of superhero comics, in which many characters can ignore most damage outright while still being susceptible to a lucky punch or superpowered blast. The &quot;Mastermind&#x27;s Manual&quot; rulebook includes notes for conversion to traditional hit points if desired.

===Advancement===
In &quot;M&amp;M&quot;, characters are awarded experience points, called &quot;power points&quot; (pp), that can do many beneficial things for the character. As described above, power points are used to purchase powers, feats, skills, abilities, and devices. The specific nature of power points was changed drastically with the 2nd edition of &quot;Mutants &amp; Masterminds&quot;. In the first edition, when a character accrues 15 pp, they advance a power level, thus raising the caps on power and skill ranks, as well as on power bonus stacking.

Under the second edition, power points and power levels are independent, the latter being set by the gamemaster as a function of the campaign. The 2nd edition version of power level determines only the maximum bonus that any power can give, and does not imply that a character does or does not have the points required to purchase enough levels in any power to reach this limit. Though the two are described as being entirely independent, the &quot;Mutants &amp; Masterminds&quot; manual recommends that the power level be increased by one with each 15 Power Points awarded.

===Hero points===
Like many other super-hero role-playing games, &quot;M&amp;M&quot; uses &quot;hero points&quot;, which allow an unlucky player to be able to hold their own in a battle, thus reducing the amount that luck plays into the gameplay. A hero point can do several things, like allow the reroll of a failed roll of any sort at a crucial moment, including toughness saves to avoid damage. On this reroll numbers under 11 have ten added to them, resulting in a range of 11-20, and a very slim chance of failing.

A player may also use a hero point to ignore fatigue, allowing them to use temporary feats without the negative effects of fatigue that normally occur with such feat usage.

Hero points are generally awarded to a player by the gamemaster when something bad befalls the character, such as the villain escaping without them having a chance of stopping him. This is particularly encouraged if the bad thing in question is something related to one of their disadvantages, and many disadvantages provide no other benefit aside from acting as a source of hero points.

==Settings==
No edition of the core &quot;M&amp;M&quot; book comes with a default setting, but 2E and 3E include an adventure that takes place in the &quot;Freedom City&quot; setting.

Settings published for the game include:
* Amazing Universe: A world where superheroes have existed publicly for the last 60 years. The laws and legal systems have evolved to handle the often ignored nuances of the comic book genre. The heroes work alongside law enforcement to protect the innocent and fight crime, but they also face challenges, both personal and professional. This is the world of the Amazing Universe, a campaign setting created by Louis Porter Jr. Design.
* Autumn Arbor: This setting, from Arbor Productions (purchased by Daring Entertainment in 2009 and re-released under the title &quot;Dawn of Legends&quot; with several new rules and character options), details a world where super-beings (called &quot;Neos&quot;) have existed publicly since World War II. Autumn Arbor takes place in a world where the laws and legal systems have evolved to handle the often ignored nuances of the comic book genre, and where the characters are depicted as real people beneath the costumes and powers, often with real-life issues such as parenting and addiction. The setting is also supported by a novel line, the first of which, &quot;Little Girl Lost&quot;, was written by Lee F. Szczepanik, Jr., Autumn Arbor co-creator. The Autumn Arbor Campaign Setting was a 2008 Origins Awards semi-finalist. The campaign world was further detailed in the Dawn of Legends sourcebook, which expanded the setting beyond the city of Autumn Arbor to include superhuman activities in nations such as China, Cuba, Germany, Japan, Mexico and others, including alterations in world history/world events outside the United States. The role of the federal government and the legal system in dealing with &quot;Neos&quot; is also given in greater depth.
* Bedlam: Designed by James Thomson for Plain Brown Wrapper Games, the setting harkens back to the Iron Age of Comics, with more mature-themed characters, situations, and scenarios. It is set in Bedlam, the City of Nowhere (AKA the City of Rust). Bedlam is a deeply troubled metropolis, riven by economic hardship, corruption, and dark occult activities. While much of the setting details street-level heroes and villains, more powerful &quot;four-color&quot; characters also exist within the city. Player character heroes may choose to play to type as ruthless vigilantes or defy the genre by becoming role-models for Bedlam&#x27;s downtrodden populace.
* DC Adventures: Published as a spin-off title based on the mainstream comic book universe published by DC Comics, its Hero&#x27;s Handbook introduced the third edition Mutants &amp; Masterminds rules. Additional books provided in game descriptions of the various heroes and villains populating the DC Universe (DC Adventures Heroes &amp; Villains, Volumes 1 and 2) as well as detailing the DC Universe itself (DC Adventures Universe).
* Freedom City: A four-color, city-based setting by Steve Kenson that is filled with elements that are similar to the great icons and concepts of classic comic books.
* Gestalt: Published by BlackWyrm Games, this hefty third party setting presents a campaign world where superhumans (&quot;gestalts&quot;) first appeared in 1989 with powers matching classical archetypes. A traditional superhero world is colored by surreal elements.
* Halt Evil Doer: A Marvel-esque setting by Phipps Gaming Studios that is similar to the Modern Age of comics. Despite having many iconic elements that spring from the Silver Age/Bronze Age of the classic Marvel Universe, the setting includes archetypes drawn from the DC comics as well, including a &quot;trinity&quot; of major heroes based loosely on Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. Despite drawing from earlier decades of superhero history, the characters and setting reflect the more mature, diverse, and nuanced comics of the current era. Halt Evil Doer has been extensively supported and expanded on Green Ronin&#x27;s Atomic Think Tank forums.
* META-4: This setting, by Erik Mona, Kyle Hunter, and Sean Glenn, is detailed in the &quot;Crooks!&quot; sourcebook. It has been compared to edgier 1990s comic books.
* The Infinite Universe: Presented in a three volume (with other volumes tentatively announced) series from Big Finger Games, the heroes, villains, and timeline of the Infinite Universe are covered in the books &quot;Adepts of the Arcane&quot;, &quot;Lords of Lightning&quot;, and &quot;Sons of the Gun&quot;. The campaign includes many black ops oriented characters, magically oriented heroes and villains, and secret organizations.
* Nocturnals: Based on Dan Brereton&#x27;s &quot;Nocturnals&quot; comic book series, the setting book was written by Mr. Brereton, with the assistance of Chris Pramas. It is a horror/pulp-based setting.
* Noir: Written by Christopher McGlothlin, &quot;Noir&quot; is based on classic film noir. The setting of &quot;Noir&quot; is a dark world where heroes are flawed and the friends may become greatest enemies.
* Nova City Heroes: Written and published by Verse Online, Nova City Heroes imagines a world where 95% of the existing heroes have vanished, leaving the fate of Nova City and the rest of the world in the hands of new unknown and untested heroes.
* Golden Age: A setting for adventures in the Golden Age of Comic Books published from 1938-55, it also details the Freedom City setting during that era.
* Hero High: A supplemental rulebook dealing with teenage heroes.
* Iron Age: Similar to Golden Age except that it deals with the Modern Age of Comic Books which is considered to roughly encompass the mid-1980s through early 1990s.
* Lockdown: A prison-based setting.
* Paragons: A generic and modular &quot;real-world&quot; setting that takes the recent trends in comic book films, the &quot;Ultimate Marvel&quot; line of comic books, and the television show &quot;Heroes&quot; as inspiration.
* Wild Cards: An adaption of the novels of the same name, edited by George R. R. Martin. The setting itself is a much stranger version of superheroes, opting for z-list types with only one power or mutation.

<doc id="824681" wikidata="Q212070" url="?curid=824681" title="Adrian Smith (musician)">
<text>Adrian Frederick Smith (born 27 February 1957) is an English guitarist and singer best known as a member of heavy metal band Iron Maiden, for whom he also writes songs and performs backing vocals both live and in the studio.

Smith grew up in London and became interested in rock music at 15. He soon formed a friendship with future Iron Maiden guitarist Dave Murray, who inspired him to take up the guitar. After leaving school at 16, he formed the band Urchin, which he led until their demise in 1980. He joined Iron Maiden in November 1980, replacing Dennis Stratton. Following a short-lived solo project called ASAP, he left Iron Maiden in 1990 and, after a year-long hiatus, formed the band The Untouchables which later became Psycho Motel. In 1997, Psycho Motel was put on hold when Smith joined the band of former Iron Maiden singer Bruce Dickinson. Smith and Dickinson would both return to Iron Maiden in 1999, after which the band gained new success. During his second tenure with Iron Maiden, Smith has also led the side projects Primal Rock Rebellion and Smith/Kotzen.

==Biography==
===Early years and Urchin: 1957–1980===
Born in Hackney, Smith grew up in Clapton. He purchased his first record, Deep Purple&#x27;s &quot;Machine Head&quot;, at the age of 15. This led him to befriend Dave Murray, with whom he formed a band called Stone Free, which comprised Murray on guitar, Smith on vocals and their friend Dave McCloughlin playing the bongos.

After seeing the attention Murray received from girls, Smith took up the guitar, starting with an old Spanish guitar once owned by his brother, before purchasing an old guitar of Murray&#x27;s for £5. His early influences included Johnny Winter and Pat Travers, which he claims made him a &quot;melodic player&quot; rather than a &quot;speed merchant or a shredder&quot; as he &quot;was inspired by blues rock rather than metal.&quot;

Leaving school after completing his O-levels, Smith formed the band Evil Ways, including Dave Murray on guitar, which was later renamed Urchin. Smith began writing his own material, including a song called &quot;Countdown&quot;, which evolved into &quot;22 Acacia Avenue&quot;, later included on Iron Maiden&#x27;s &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; (1982). For a period of 2 years, Smith had a job as a Water Bailiff and Fisheries Officer at the Walthamstow Reservoirs.

Murray left Urchin to join Iron Maiden. Urchin then signed with DJM Records and released a single, &quot;Black Leather Fantasy&quot;, in 1977. Shortly afterwards, Murray rejoined Urchin on their next single, &quot;She&#x27;s a Roller&quot;, as he had been sacked from Iron Maiden after an argument with singer Dennis Wilcock, although he would be reinstated six months later. Smith was also offered a place in Iron Maiden while they were in the process of signing with EMI in 1979, but turned them down to continue with his own band, a decision he later regretted as Urchin split up in 1980.

===First tenure in Iron Maiden: 1980–1990===

Shortly after Urchin split, Smith encountered Steve Harris and Dave Murray on a street in his neighborhood, and the two asked him to reconsider joining Iron Maiden as the replacement for guitarist Dennis Stratton. This time Smith accepted the offer, and debuted with the band on a West German TV show &quot;Rockpop in Concert&quot; in Munich on 8 November 1980, before setting out on a UK tour and recording the &quot;Killers&quot; album, released in 1981. Smith&#x27;s first song-writing contributions appeared on &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;, co-penning &quot;Gangland&quot; and &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, as well as the previously mentioned &quot;22 Acacia Avenue&quot;, after which he began co-writing many songs with singer Bruce Dickinson, on the following &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; album.

Smith and Dave Murray combined playing dual lead guitars, creating what AllMusic calls &quot;the most formidable twin-guitar attack in heavy metal, outside of Glenn Tipton and K. K. Downing.&quot; Smith, along with Steve Harris, also provides the band&#x27;s backing vocals, and sang lead on &quot;Reach Out&quot;, the B-side to the &quot;Wasted Years&quot; single, featuring Bruce Dickinson on backing vocals. Originally written by guitarist Dave &quot;Bucket&quot; Colwell, with whom he had worked on The Entire Population of Hackney project, Smith would later sing &quot;Reach Out&quot; again for Colwell&#x27;s solo album, &quot;Guitars, Beers &amp; Tears&quot;, released in 2010.

===Departure from Iron Maiden and other projects: 1989–1999===
While Iron Maiden were taking some time off in 1989, Smith released a solo LP with the band ASAP (Adrian Smith And Project), entitled &quot;Silver and Gold&quot;, which was a commercial failure in spite of a promotional club tour. Unhappy with the direction the band were taking for their next release, &quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot;, and feeling that he could not help enough in the creative work, Smith left Iron Maiden in 1990 during the album&#x27;s pre-production stages, and was replaced by Janick Gers. After releasing the more progressive &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; and &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot; albums in 1986 and 1988 respectively, Steve Harris had decided that the band should go for a &quot;stripped-down&quot; and &quot;street level&quot; approach, which Smith thought was a &quot;step backward&quot;. &quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot; contained one last Smith song, co-penned with Bruce Dickinson, entitled &quot;Hooks in You&quot;.

After leaving Maiden, Smith started a family with his Canadian wife, Nathalie, and also auditioned to replace Steve Clark in Def Leppard, a position which ultimately went to former Dio guitarist Vivian Campbell. Smith joined Iron Maiden onstage at Donington Park in 1992 to &quot;Running Free&quot;. That performance appeared on the live album &quot;Live at Donington&quot;. In the same year, after hearing King&#x27;s X for the first time, he decided that he would &quot;love to play in a band like that&quot; and formed The Untouchables, which later became Psycho Motel. The band recorded two albums, &quot;State of Mind&quot; in 1995 and &quot;Welcome to the World&quot; in 1997, during which they supported Iron Maiden on the British leg of The X Factour. The project was put on hold, however, when Smith joined Bruce Dickinson for his 1997 album, &quot;Accident of Birth&quot;, after which he became a full-time member of Dickinson&#x27;s solo outfit, embarking on two world tours and contributing to one further studio release, 1998&#x27;s &quot;The Chemical Wedding&quot;.

===Return to Iron Maiden: 1999–present===

In 1999, Smith rejoined Iron Maiden, along with vocalist Bruce Dickinson, who commented, &quot;When he (Smith) left the band in 1990, I think everybody was a bit surprised at how much we missed him and certainly, I don&#x27;t think anybody had realized how much the fans would miss him – big time. I wouldn&#x27;t have rejoined Iron Maiden if he wasn&#x27;t in the band. I just don&#x27;t think it would have been complete without Adrian, and now, it&#x27;s great having three guitarists.&quot; The band embarked on a short tour, after which the new line-up&#x27;s first album, &quot;Brave New World&quot;, was recorded with producer Kevin Shirley and released in 2000.

He remains in Iron Maiden, with whom he has released five further studio albums, 2003&#x27;s &quot;Dance of Death&quot;, 2006&#x27;s &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot;, 2010&#x27;s &quot;The Final Frontier&quot;, 2015&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Souls&quot; and 2021&#x27;s Senjutsu. Smith claims that his guitar playing improved after leaving the band in 1990, in particular while working with Roy Z, from whom he &quot;learned a lot about picking&quot; and became &quot;more disciplined&quot;. Since returning to Iron Maiden, he has also continued experimenting with tuning (which he began doing in Psycho Motel), stating that he has used drop D tuning in live renditions of &quot;Run to the Hills&quot;, &quot;Wrathchild&quot;, &quot;The Trooper&quot; and &quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name&quot;. Although Smith had previously been known to contribute shorter, more &quot;commercial&quot; tracks, since his return to the band he has penned many longer songs, beginning with &quot;Paschendale&quot; from &quot;Dance of Death&quot;.

====Side projects====
In 2011, Smith formed the side project Primal Rock Rebellion with Mikee Goodman. They released the album, &quot;Awoken Broken&quot;, in February 2012. In 2020, Smith collaborated with Richie Kotzen under the name Smith/Kotzen. &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; described the project&#x27;s sound as a mixture of blues, traditional R&amp;B, and hard rock. A video for teaser track, &quot;Taking My Chances&quot;, debuted in January 2021. Their self-titled debut album was released in March 2021.

Their second album, Black Light/White Noise, was announced in November 2024, to be released in April 2025.

==Personal life==
Adrian Smith was born in Hackney Hospital and grew up a few streets away from his childhood friend, and current bandmate, Dave Murray. Smith, whose father was a painter and decorator from Homerton, was the youngest of three, with an older brother and a sister. As a child, he was &quot;a Manchester United fanatic&quot;, although he would lose his interest in football once he got into music.

In his spare time, Smith is a keen angler, revealing that he used to take &quot;worms and maggots&quot; with him on tour, and was featured on the front cover of &quot;Angler&#x27;s Mail&quot; on 25 August 2009. Since 21 October 1988, he has been married to Nathalie Dufresne-Smith, who currently works for &quot;Maiden Flight&quot;, a cancer awareness/patient rights organisation, and the pair have three children.

In April 2020, ironmaiden.com announced Smith&#x27;s autobiography titled &quot;Monsters of River and Rock&quot; would be released in September 2020. The book primarily details Smith&#x27;s love of fishing, and relates anecdotes from his many decades of pursuing the hobby whilst touring and recording with Iron Maiden. Smith stated that around 70% of his book was focused upon fishing, with the remaining content discussing his music career. In its review of the publication, MetalTalk described the book as &quot;a prize catch amongst rock biographies – highly recommended.&quot;

In January 2025, he lost his Malibu house in the LA fires. 

==Equipment==
===Guitars===

Smith currently prefers to use his Jackson signature &#x27;San Dimas&#x27; Dinky, although he has used a variety of guitars over his career, including several different Dean models, various Jacksons (including the Randy Rhoads model), Fender Stratocasters (including three Fender Floyd Rose Classic Stratocasters; one with an added Roland midi pick-up), Gibson Les Pauls, Gibson Explorers, Gibson SGs, an Ibanez Destroyer, a Hamer Scarab, and Lado Guitars. On the &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; DVD, he says the first decent guitar he bought was a Deluxe Gold Top 1972 Gibson Les Paul, which he paid £235 for when he was 17, in 1974. He still uses it to this day, stating that &quot;it&#x27;s still probably the best guitar I&#x27;ve got&quot;.

As of 2010, his touring guitars included: Gibson Les Paul Deluxe Goldtop 1972 with DiMarzio Super Distortion in bridge position, his Jackson Superstrat 1986 prototype (which can be seen in the &quot;Maiden England&quot; video) with the pickguard changed to resemble his signature model, a Jackson Signature model with black scratchplate and maple neck, an early 70s Gibson SG, and another Jackson, inspired by his Les Paul Goldtop.

As of August 2007, Smith endorses Jackson Guitars, his first guitar company endorsement in over fifteen years. With Jackson he has released two signature models, a San Dimas Dinky and an SDX. Prior to his endorsement, he was seen using other Jackson guitars, such as a King V during his time in Bruce Dickinson&#x27;s solo band, before he went to Fender guitars. In August 2008, one of his Jackson guitars was stolen from backstage at a show in Greece.

<text>The Alabama cave shrimp (&quot;Palaemonias alabamae&quot;) is a species of shrimp in the family Atyidae, found only in caves in the state of Alabama.

==Conservation status==
&quot;Palaemonias alabamae&quot; is listed as an endangered species both on the IUCN Red List, and since September 7, 1988, under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.

==Distribution==
The Alabama cave shrimp is only known from five caves, all in Madison County, Alabama. Shelta Cave is the species&#x27; type locality, but viable populations have only been confirmed in Bobcat Cave and the complex comprising Hering Cave, Glover Cave and Brazelton Cave.

==Ecology==
&quot;P. alabamae&quot; occurs in cave pools with silty bottoms. Predators of the Alabama cave shrimp include the southern cavefish &quot;Typhlichthys subterraneus&quot;, the Tennessee cave salamander &quot;Gyrinophilus palleucus&quot;, various crayfish species, bullfrogs and raccoons.

==Taxonomy==
The closest relative of the Alabama cave shrimp is the Kentucky cave shrimp, &quot;Palaemonias ganteri&quot;, which lives in Mammoth Cave National Park, Kentucky. The two species can be distinguished by size (&quot;P. alabamae&quot; being larger than &quot;P. ganteri&quot;), the longer rostrum in &quot;P. alabamae&quot;, and the greater number of spines on the rostrum of &quot;P. alabamae&quot;.

<text>Joely Kim Richardson (born 9 January 1965) is a British actress. She is notable for her roles as Julia McNamara in the FX drama series &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot; (2003–2010) and Katherine Parr in the Showtime series &quot;The Tudors&quot; (2010).

==Early life==
Joely Kim Richardson was born in Marylebone, London, to the theatrical Redgrave family, the daughter of actress Vanessa Redgrave and director Tony Richardson (1928–1991), and the granddaughter of actors Sir Michael Redgrave (1908–1985) and Rachel Kempson, Lady Redgrave (1910–2003). Actress Natasha Richardson (1963–2009) was her sister and actor Liam Neeson is her brother-in-law. She is the aunt of Micheál and Daniel Neeson and the niece of actors Lynn Redgrave (1943–2010) and Corin Redgrave (1939–2010) and cousin of actress Jemma Redgrave, who is five days younger than Richardson.

Joely appeared as an extra at the age of three in the 1968 version of &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;, directed by her father. Richardson and her sister Natasha&#x27;s early education began at the independent St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School in Hammersmith. At age 14, Richardson moved to boarding school at the independent Harry Hopman Tennis School in Tampa, Florida. In 1983, she graduated from the Thacher School in Ojai, California, then returned to London to study at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and graduated in 1985.

==Career==
Possessing an early ambition to become a professional tennis player, she spent two years at a tennis academy in Florida. Richardson then turned to acting. In 1985, she portrayed, by flashbacks, the younger version of the leading character played by her mother in the film &quot;Wetherby&quot;. After a leading role in Peter Greenaway&#x27;s cult success &quot;Drowning by Numbers&quot; (1988), her first major role in front of a mass audience was as Joanna Farley in a 1989 television episode of &quot;Poirot&quot;, based on Agatha Christie&#x27;s detective series. In a 1989 episode of &quot;Jim Henson&#x27;s The Storyteller&quot;, she was cast as a princess. She portrayed a teacher on the verge of a nervous breakdown in the 1989 Channel 4 serial &quot;Behaving Badly&quot; and fictional Finnish Princess Anna (with &quot;a voice like a tuba&quot;) in the 1991 screen comedy &quot;King Ralph&quot;.

A year later she appeared in &quot;Shining Through&quot; alongside her future brother-in-law, Liam Neeson, with both actors playing Nazis.

In 1993, Richardson appeared in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Lady Chatterley&quot; opposite Sean Bean. In 1996, she played fashion designer Anita Campbell-Green in the Disney live-action remake of the animated &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; opposite Glenn Close as Cruella de Vil. In 1998, in the television drama &quot;The Echo&quot;, she played Amanda Powell. The next year, she played in the science fiction horror film &quot;Event Horizon&quot; as Lieutenant Starck, executive officer of the research and rescue ship &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot;, sent to rescue crew of the long-lost experimental ship &quot;Event Horizon&quot;.

One year later, Richardson appeared opposite Mel Gibson in the film &quot;The Patriot&quot;, an American film set in the American Revolution. Also in 2000, she appeared opposite Hugh Laurie in &quot;Maybe Baby&quot;, Ben Elton&#x27;s film adaptation of his book &quot;Inconceivable&quot;. She was cast in the 2001 film &quot;The Affair of the Necklace&quot; after director Charles Shyer noticed her resemblance to doomed 18th century French Queen Marie Antoinette.

In 2003, Richardson took on the role of Julia McNamara in the television drama &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;, based on the complicated lives of two plastic surgeons filled with romance in Miami. Her mother, Vanessa Redgrave, appeared in several episodes, playing her character&#x27;s mother.

In 2005, Richardson starred in &quot;Lies My Mother Told Me&quot;, based on a true story about a murderous con artist. In 2007, she played the mother in &quot;The Last Mimzy&quot; with Timothy Hutton and Chris O&#x27;Neil. She also starred in the television drama &quot;Wallis &amp; Edward&quot;, playing the lead role of Wallis Simpson, lover of Edward, Prince of Wales.

In 2009–10, Richardson appeared as Catherine Parr, sixth wife of Henry VIII, in the fourth (and final) season of Showtime&#x27;s hit period drama &quot;The Tudors&quot;. The role reunited her with her former husband Tim Bevan, who was part of the show&#x27;s production team.

Joely joined the cast of TV series &quot;&quot; in which she played the role of Countess Markievicz. In 2015 she co-starred alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger in the zombie thriller film &quot;Maggie&quot;.

==Personal life==

<text>Vampire Tales was an American black-and-white horror comics magazine published by Magazine Management, a corporate sibling of Marvel Comics. The series ran 11 issues and one annual publication from 1973 to 1975, and featuring vampires as both protagonists and antagonists.

A magazine rather than a comic book, it did not fall under the purview of the comics industry&#x27;s self-censorship Comics Code Authority, allowing the title to feature stronger content — such as moderate profanity, partial nudity, and more graphic violence — than the color comics of the time that featured Dracula stories.

==Publishing history==
&quot;Vampire Tales&quot; ran 11 issues cover-dated August 1973 to June 1975. With sister titles including &quot;Dracula Lives&quot;, &quot;Monsters Unleashed&quot; and &quot;Tales of the Zombie&quot;, it was published by Marvel Comics&#x27; parent company, Magazine Management, and related corporations, under the brand emblem Marvel Monster Group. Published bi-monthly, the magazine cost 75 cents.

The magazine starred Morbius the Living Vampire, in a feature written primarily by Don McGregor, with pencillers including Pablo Marcos, Rich Buckler, Tom Sutton, and Mike Vosburg, and later by writer Doug Moench, with artist Sonny Trinidad. The vampire hunter Blade the Vampire Slayer starred in two stories by writer Marv Wolfman and artist Tony DeZuniga, in issues #8-9 (Dec. 1974 - Feb. 1975). Steve Gerber contributed a Morbius story to issue #1 (Aug. 1973) and a story starring Lilith, Dracula&#x27;s daughter, to issue #6 (Aug. 1974).

Issue #2 (Oct. 1973) introduced Satana the Devil&#x27;s Daughter, in a four-page teaser by writer-editor Roy Thomas and artist John Romita Sr.; and detective Hodiah Twist and his assistant Conrad Jeavons, created by Don McGregor and penciller Carlos Garzon.

Writer Ron Goulart and Roy Thomas and artist Win Mortimer adapted the vampire short story &quot;The Vampyre&quot;, by John Polidori, in issue #1. Other adaptations included writer Don McGregor and artist Vicente Alcazar&#x27;s &quot;Bat&#x27;s Belfry&quot; in issue #3 (Oct. 1973) and writer Tony Isabella and artist Esteban Maroto&#x27;s &quot;The Drifting Snow&quot; in issue #4 (April 1974), both from August Derleth short stories.

Stories reprinted from Marvel&#x27;s 1950s predecessor Atlas Comics included pre-Comics Code Authority work by such artists as Bill Everett and Carmine Infantino. Other reprints included writer-artist Jim Steranko&#x27;s &quot;At the Stroke of Midnight&quot; from &quot;Tower of Shadows&quot; #1 (Sept. 1969) and the 11-page Morbius origin sequence from &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #102 (Nov. 1971).

&quot;Vampire Tales Super Annual&quot; was published in 1975, reprinting stories from the magazine. It lasted one issue.

&quot;Marvel Preview&quot; #3 (Sept. 1975) and 6 (Dec. 1975) concluded the four-part Blade story begun in &quot;Vampire Tales&quot; #8-9, of which the third part from issue #3 would have been in &quot;Vampire Tales&quot; #12 (as originally announced at the end of issue #11 (June 1975)) had that title not been cancelled.

<doc id="824692" wikidata="Q418348" url="?curid=824692" title="Perfluorooctanoic acid">
<text>Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; conjugate base perfluorooctanoate; also known colloquially as C8, for its 8-carbon chain structure) is a perfluorinated carboxylic acid produced and used worldwide as an industrial surfactant in chemical processes and as a material feedstock. PFOA is considered a surfactant, or fluorosurfactant, due to its chemical structure, which consists of a perfluorinated, &quot;n&quot;-heptyl &quot;tail group&quot; and a carboxylic acid &quot;head group&quot;. The head group can be described as hydrophilic while the fluorocarbon tail is both hydrophobic and lipophobic.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified PFOA as carcinogenic to humans. PFOA is one of many synthetic organofluorine compounds collectively known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). Many PFAS such as PFOS, PFOA are a concern because they do not break down via natural processes and are commonly described as persistent organic pollutants or &quot;forever chemicals&quot;. They can also move through soils and contaminate drinking water sources and can build up (bioaccumulate) in fish and wildlife. Residues have been detected in humans and wildlife.

PFOA is used in several industrial applications, including carpeting, upholstery, apparel, floor wax, textiles, fire fighting foam and sealants. PFOA serves as a surfactant in the emulsion polymerization of fluoropolymers and as a building block for the synthesis of perfluoroalkyl-substituted compounds, polymers, and polymeric materials. PFOA has been manufactured since the 1940s in industrial quantities. It is also formed by the degradation of precursors such as some fluorotelomers. PFOA is used as a surfactant because it can lower the surface tension of water more than hydrocarbon surfactants while having exceptional stability due to having perfluoroalkyl tail group. The stability of PFOA is desired industrially but is a cause of concern environmentally.

The primary manufacturer of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), 3M, began a production phase-out in 2002 in response to concerns expressed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Eight other companies agreed to gradually phase out the manufacturing of the chemical by 2015.

By 2014, EPA had listed PFOA and perfluorooctanesulfonates (salts of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, PFOS) as emergent contaminants:

== History ==
3M (then the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company) began producing PFOA by electrochemical fluorination in 1947. Starting in 1951, DuPont purchased PFOA from 3M for use in the manufacturing of specific fluoropolymers—commercially branded as Teflon, but DuPont internally referred to the material as C8.

In 1968, organofluorine content was detected in the blood serum of consumers, and in 1976 it was suggested to be PFOA or a related compound such as PFOS.

In 1999, EPA ordered companies to examine the effects of perfluorinated chemicals after receiving data on the global distribution and toxicity of PFOS. For these reasons, and EPA pressure, in May 2000, 3M announced the phaseout of the production of PFOA, PFOS, and PFOS-related products—the company&#x27;s best-selling repellent. 3M stated that they would have made the same decision regardless of EPA pressure.

Because of the 3M phaseout, in 2002, DuPont built its own plant in Fayetteville, North Carolina, to manufacture the chemical. The chemical has received attention due to litigation from the PFOA-contaminated community around DuPont&#x27;s Washington Works facility in Washington, West Virginia, along with EPA focus. In 2004, ChemRisk—an &quot;industry risk assessor&quot; that had been contracted by Dupont, reported that over 1.7 million pounds of C8 had been &quot;dumped, poured and released&quot; into the environment from Dupont&#x27;s Parkersburg, West Virginia-based Washington Works plant between 1951 and 2003.

Research on PFOA has demonstrated ubiquity, animal-based toxicity, and some associations with human health parameters and potential health effects. Additionally, advances in analytical chemistry in recent years have allowed the routine detection of low- and sub-parts per billion levels of PFOA in a variety of substances. In 2013, Gore-Tex eliminated the use of PFOAs in the manufacture of its weatherproof functional fabrics. Major companies producing PFOA signed with the Global PFOA Stewardship Program with the goal of elimination of PFOA by 2015. Since then it has been eliminated from the production of non-stick materials used in cookware. GenX has been introduced as a replacement for PFOA, but in a 2015 study which tested the effects on rats, GenX caused many of the same health problems as PFOA, but required much higher concentrations. This is because GenX (C3) is a short chain alternative to PFOA. GenX also has a significantly shorter half-life than PFOA so it is not as bio-persistent as PFOA or other long chain perfluorinated chemicals.

===Robert Bilott investigation===
In the Autumn of 2000, lawyer Robert Bilott, a partner at Taft Stettinius &amp; Hollister, won a court order forcing DuPont to share all documentation related to PFOA. This included 110,000 files, consisting of confidential studies and reports conducted by DuPont scientists over decades. By 1993, DuPont understood that &quot;PFOA caused cancerous testicular, pancreatic and liver tumors in lab animals&quot; and the company began to investigate alternatives. However, because products manufactured with PFOA were such an integral part of DuPont&#x27;s earnings, $1 billion in annual profit, they chose to continue using PFOA. Bilott learned that both &quot;3M and DuPont had been conducting secret medical studies on PFOA for more than four decades&quot;, and by 1961 DuPont was aware of hepatomegaly in mice fed with PFOA.

Bilott exposed how DuPont had been knowingly polluting water with PFOAs in Parkersburg, West Virginia, since the 1980s. In the 1980s and 1990s, researchers investigated the toxicity of PFOA.

For his work in the exposure of the contamination, lawyer Robert Bilott has received several awards including The Right Livelihood Award in 2017. This battle with DuPont is featured in the documentary &quot;The Devil We Know&quot;, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2018, and &quot;Dark Waters&quot;, directed by Todd Haynes.

Regarding a secretive agreement between 3M and the government of Jersey to not perform group testing of residents and to help 3M avoid a class action, he told The Guardian: “I’ve not seen something like this where there’s an agreement to try to help the company against claims by others, Particularly if it’s something affecting public health and safety or research.” 

== Synthesis ==

PFOA has two main synthesis routes, electrochemical fluorination (ECF) and telomerization. The ECF route sees octanoyl chloride (the acid chloride of octanoic acid) reacted with hydrofluoric acid. Multiple products are formed by ECF with the target acid fluoride F(CF2)7COF being produced as only 10–15% of the yield, while the main products are perfluorinated cyclic ether isomers, including FC-75. This acid fluoride is hydrolyzed to yield PFOA as a mixture of straight-chain (78%), terminally branched (13%), and internally branched (9%) molecules, because ECF induces rearrangements in the carbon tail of the acid chloride. ECF also results in production wastes. 3M synthesized ECF PFOA at their Cottage Grove, Minnesota facility from 1947 to 2002 and was the world&#x27;s largest producer. ECF production continues on a smaller scale in Europe and Asia.

PFOA is also synthesized by the telomerization represented below, where the telogen is the organoiodine compound and the taxogen is the tetrafluoroethylene. Each step is an addition reaction where the carbon-iodine bond of the telogen is added across the carbon-carbon double bond of the unsaturated taxogen, resulting in the formation of a new telogen.

:CF3CF2I + F2C=CF2 → CF3CF2CF2CF2I

:CF3(CF2)3I + F2C=CF2 → CF3(CF2)5I

:CF3(CF2)5I + F2C=CF2 → CF3(CF2)7I

The product is oxidized by SO3 to form PFOA. Since each addition produces a new teleomer, fluorotelomers like these form with varying length chains containing an even number of carbon atoms, depending on reaction conditions. Typically, most products within will contain between two and six taxogens (that is, from CF3(CF2)5I to CF3(CF2)13I). After oxidation, distillation is used to separate PFOA from the other perfluorinated carboxylic acids. The telomerization synthesis of PFOA was pioneered by DuPont, and is not well suited to the laboratory. PFOA formed by telomerization is completely linear, in contrast to the mixture of structures formed by ECF.

== Applications ==
PFOA has widespread applications. In 1976, PFOA was reported as a water and oil repellent &quot;in fabrics and leather and in the production of floor waxes and waxed papers&quot;; however, it is believed that paper is no longer treated with perfluorinated compounds, but with fluorotelomers with less than 0.1% PFOA. The compound is also used in &quot;insulators for electric wires, planar etching of fused silica&quot;, fire fighting foam, and outdoor clothing. As a protonated species, the acid form of PFOA was the most widely used perfluorocarboxylic acid used as a reactive intermediate in the production of fluoroacrylic esters.
As a salt, its dominant use is as an emulsifier for the emulsion polymerization of fluoropolymers such as PTFE, polyvinylidene fluoride, and fluoroelastomers. For this use, 3M subsidiary Dyneon has a replacement emulsifer despite DuPont stating PFOA is an &quot;essential processing aid&quot;. In the past PFOA was used in the production of Gore-Tex as it is PTFE-based. In PTFE processing, PFOA is in aqueous solution and forms micelles that contain tetrafluoroethylene and the growing polymer. PFOA can be used to stabilize fluoropolymer and fluoroelastomer suspensions before further industrial processing and in ion-pair reversed-phase liquid chromatography it can act as an extraction agent. PFOA also finds uses in electronic products and as an industrial fluorosurfactant.

In a 2009 EPA study of 116 products, purchased between March 2007 and May 2008 and found to contain at least 0.01% fluorine by weight, the concentrations of PFOA were determined. Concentrations shown below range from not detected, or ND, (with the detection limit in parentheses) to 6750 with concentrations in nanograms of PFOA per gram of sample (parts per billion) unless stated otherwise.

== Global occurrence and sources ==
PFOA contaminates every continent. Two of the most common types (PFOS and PFOA) were phased out of production in the United States (US) in 2002 and 2015 respectively, but are still present in some imported products. PFOA and PFOS are found in every American person&#x27;s blood stream in the parts per billion range, though those concentrations have decreased by 70% for PFOA and 84% for PFOS between 1999 and 2014, which coincides with the end of the production and phase out of PFOA and PFOS in the US. PFOA has been detected in the central Pacific Ocean at low parts per quadrillion ranges, and at low parts per trillion (ppt) levels in coastal waters. Due to the surfactant nature of PFOA, it has been found to concentrate in the top layers of ocean water. PFOA is detected widely in surface waters, and is present in numerous mammals, fish, and bird species. PFOA is in the blood or vital organs of Atlantic salmon, swordfish, striped mullet, gray seals, common cormorants, Alaskan polar bears, brown pelicans, sea turtles, sea eagles, Midwestern bald eagles, California sea lions and Laysan albatrosses on Sand Island, a wildlife refuge on Midway Atoll, in the middle of the North Pacific Ocean, about halfway between North America and Asia. Because PFAS are ubiquitous in households, consumer products, food, and the environment generally, some trace levels reflecting this ubiquitous broad use of these compounds will make their way into the wastewater and solid waste streams.

However, wildlife has much less PFOA than humans, unlike PFOS and other longer perfluorinated carboxylic acids; in wildlife, PFOA is not as bioaccumulative as longer perfluorinated carboxylic acids. Municipal wastewater and landfill leachates are considered as important sources of PFOA to the environment.

Most industrialized nations have average PFOA blood serum levels ranging from 2 to 8 parts per billion; the highest consumer sub-population identified was in Korea—with about 60 parts per billion. In Peru, Vietnam, and Afghanistan blood serum levels have been recorded to be below one part per billion. In 2003–2004 99.7% of Americans had detectable PFOA in their serum with an average of about 4 parts per billion, and concentrations of PFOA in US serum have declined by 25% in recent years. Despite a decrease in PFOA, the longer perfluorinated carboxylic acid PFNA is increasing in the blood of US consumers. PFAS are also found in paper mill residuals, digestates, composts, and soils. Given the ubiquity of PFAS, and the comparative background levels which may be found in wastewater, biosolids, and leachates, setting requirements near analytical detection limits on these sources may not provide a discernable benefit to protecting public health.

=== Industrial sources ===
PFOA is released directly from industrial sites. For example, the estimate for the DuPont Washington Works facility is a total PFOA emissions of 80,000 pounds (lbs) in 2000 and 1,700 pounds in 2004. A 2006 study, with two of four authors being DuPont employees, estimated about 80% of historical perfluorocarboxylate emissions were released to the environment from fluoropolymer manufacture and use. PFOA can be measured in water from industrial sites other than fluorochemical plants. PFOA has also been detected in emissions from the carpet industry, paper and electronics industries. The most important emission sources are carpet and textile protection products, as well as fire-fighting foams.

=== Precursors ===

PFOA can form as a breakdown product from a variety of precursor molecules. In fact, the main products of the fluorotelomer industry, fluorotelomer-based polymers, have been shown to degrade to form PFOA and related compounds, with half-lives of decades, both biotically and by simple abiotic reaction with water. It has been argued that fluorotelomer-based polymers already produced might be major sources of PFOA globally for decades to come. Other precursors that degrade to PFOA include 8:2 fluorotelomer alcohol (F(CF2)8CH2CH2OH), polyfluoroalkyl phosphate surfactants (PAPS), and possibly &quot;N&quot;-EtFOSE alcohol (F(CF2)8SO2N(Et)CH2CH2OH). When PTFE (Teflon) is degraded by heat (pyrolysis) it can form PFOA as a minor product. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has compiled a list of 615 chemicals that have the potential to break down into perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCA) including PFOA. However, not all 615 have the potential to break down to form PFOA.

A majority of waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) that have been tested output more PFOA than is input, and this increased output has been attributed to the biodegradation of fluorotelomer alcohols. A current PFOA precursor concern are fluorotelomer-based polymers; fluorotelomer alcohols attached to hydrocarbon backbones via ester linkages may detach and be free to biodegrade to PFOA.

=== Sources to people ===
Food, drinking water, outdoor air, indoor air, dust, and food packagings are all implicated as sources of PFOA to people. However, it is unclear which exposure routes dominate because of data gaps. When water is a source, blood levels are approximately 100 times higher than drinking water levels.

People who lived in the PFOA-contaminated area around DuPont&#x27;s Washington Works facility were found to have higher levels of PFOA in their blood from drinking water. The highest PFOA levels in drinking water were found in the Little Hocking water system, with an average concentration of 3.55 parts per billion during 2002–2005. Individuals who drank more tap water, ate locally grown fruits and vegetables, or ate local meat, were all associated with having higher PFOA levels. Residents who used water carbon filter systems had lower PFOA levels.

In Jersey, UK, 18% of residents of an area were found to have elevated levels of PFOA, downstream from 3M fire retardant tests in weekly fire-service practice from the 1960s to the mid 1990s. Bloodletting is used for these residents at a cost of $4500 per patient. The potatoes of the island were found to contain 10x the EU limit of PFOS. 

==== Food contact surfaces ====

PFOA is also formed as an unintended byproduct in the production of fluorotelomers and is present in finished goods treated with fluorotelomers, including those intended for food contact. Fluorotelomers are applied to food contact papers because they are lipophobic: they prevent oil from soaking into the paper from fatty foods. Also, fluorotelomers can be metabolized into PFOA. In a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) study, lipophobic fluorotelomer-based paper coatings (which can be applied to food contact paper in the concentration range of 0.4%) were found to contain 88,000–160,000 parts per billion PFOA before application, while the oil from microwave popcorn bags contained 6–290 parts per billion PFOA after heating. Toxicologists estimate that microwave popcorn could account for about 20% of the PFOA levels measured in an individual consuming 10 bags a year if 1% of the fluorotelomers are metabolized to PFOA.

In 2008 as news stories began to raise concerns about PFOA in microwaved popcorn, Dan Turner, DuPont&#x27;s global public relations chief, said, &quot;I serve microwave popcorn to my three-year-old.&quot; Five years later, journalist Peter Laufer wrote to Turner to ask if his child was still eating microwave popcorn. &quot;I am not going to comment on such a personal inquiry&quot;, Turner replied.

Fluorotelomer coatings are used in fast food wrappers, candy wrappers, and pizza box liners. PAPS, a type of paper fluorotelomer coating, and PFOA precursor, is also used in food contact papers.

Despite DuPont&#x27;s asserting that &quot;cookware coated with DuPont Teflon non-stick coatings does not contain PFOA&quot;, residual PFOA was also detected in finished PTFE products including PTFE cookware (4–75 parts per billion). However, PFOA levels ranged from undetectable (&lt;1.5) to 4.3 parts per billion in a more recent study. Also, non-stick cookware is heated—which should volatilize PFOA; PTFE products that are not heated, such as PTFE sealant tape, had higher (1800 parts per billion) levels detected. Overall, PTFE cookware is considered an insignificant exposure pathway to PFOA.

==== Potential path: sludge to food ====
PFOA and PFOS were detected in &quot;very high&quot; (low parts per million) levels in agricultural fields for grazing beef cattle and crops around Decatur, Alabama. The approximately 5000 acres of land were fertilized with &quot;treated municipal sewage sludge, or biosolids&quot;. PFOA was also detected in fodder grass grown in these soils and the blood of the cattle feeding on this grass. The water treatment plant received process wastewater from a nearby perfluorochemical manufacturing plant. 3M says they managed their own wastes, but Daikin America &quot;discharged process wastewater to the municipal waste treatment plant&quot;. If traced to meat, it would be the first time perfluorochemicals were traced from sludge to food. However, the USDA reported—with a detection limits of 20 parts per billion—non-detectable levels for both PFOA and PFOS in cattle muscle tissue.

==== Household dust ====
PFOA is frequently found in household dust, making it an important exposure route for adults, but more substantially, children. Children have higher exposures to PFOA through dust compared to adults. Hand-to-mouth contact and proximity to high concentrations of dust make them more susceptible to ingestion, and increases PFOA exposure. One study showed significant positive associations were recognized between dust ingestion and PFOA serum concentrations. However, an alternate study found exposure due to dust ingestion was associated with minimal risk.

====Menstrual pads====
In 2024 it was reported that a brand of menstrual pad was found to contain PFOA.

== Regulatory status ==

=== Drinking water and products ===
In the United States there are no federal drinking water standards for PFOA or PFOS as of early 2021. EPA began requiring public water systems to monitor for PFOA and PFOS in 2012, and published drinking water health advisories, which are non-regulatory technical documents, in 2016. The lifetime health advisories and health effects support documents assist federal, state, tribal, and local officials and managers of drinking water systems in protecting public health when these chemicals are present in drinking water. The levels of PFOS and PFOA concentrations under which adverse health effects are not anticipated to occur over a lifetime of exposure are 0.07 ppb (70 ppt). In March 2021 EPA announced that it would develop a National Primary Drinking Water Regulation for these contaminants.

The State of New Jersey published drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS in 2020. A standard for PFNA was published in 2018. This was the first state to publish PFAS standards in the absence of federal regulations. &quot;See&quot; U.S. state government actions.

In 2018 the State of New York adopted drinking water standards of 10 ppt for PFOA and 10 ppt for PFOS, the most stringent such standards in the United States. The standards apply to public water systems and took effect in 2019 after a public comment period.

Using information gained through a Freedom of Information Act request, in May 2018 it was learned that January 2018 emails between the EPA, the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Health and Human Services showed an effort to suppress the release of a draft report on the toxicology of PFOS and PFOA done by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. The report found that these chemicals endanger human health at a far lower level than EPA has previously called safe. After media accounts of the effort surfaced, the regional EPA administrator for Colorado denied that EPA had anything to do with suppressing the report. The report was finally released on June 21, 2018.

The new ATSDR analysis derives provisional Minimal Risk Levels (MRLs) of 3x10−6 mg/kg/day for PFOA and 2x10−6 mg/kg/day for PFOS during intermediate exposure. The European Food Safety Authority opinion sets a provisional tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of 6 x10−6 mg/kg body weight per week for PFOA.

=== California and food packaging ===
An attempt to regulate PFOA in food packaging occurred in the US state of California in 2008. A bill, sponsored by State Senator Ellen Corbett and the Environmental Working Group, was passed in the house and senate that would have banned PFOA, PFOS, and seven or more related fluorinated carbon compounds in food packaging starting in 2010, but the bill was vetoed by Governor Schwarzenegger. The bill would have affected fluorochemical manufacturers outside of the state. Schwarzenegger said the compound should be reviewed by the newly established, and more comprehensive, state program.

=== Fluorotelomers ===

Fluorotelomer-based products have been shown to degrade to PFOA over periods of decades; these studies could lead EPA to require DuPont and others to reformulate products with a value over $1 billion.

== Health effects ==

=== Toxicology ===
PFOA is a possible carcinogen, a possible liver toxicant, a possible developmental toxicant, and a possible immune system toxicant, and also exerts hormonal effects including alteration of thyroid hormone levels at very high concentrations Animal studies show developmental toxicity from reduced birth size, physical developmental delays, endocrine disruption, and neonatal mortality. PFOA alters lipid metabolism. 

PFOA has been described as a member of a group of &quot;classic non-genotoxic carcinogens&quot;. However, a provisional German assessment notes that a 2005 study found PFOA to be genotoxic via a peroxisome proliferation pathway that produced oxygen radicals in HepG2 cells, and a 2006 study demonstrated the induction and suppression of a broad range of genes; therefore, it states that the indirect genotoxic (and thus carcinogenic) potential of PFOA &quot;cannot&quot; be dismissed. As of November 2023, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified PFOA as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) based on “sufficient” evidence for cancer in animals and “strong” mechanistic evidence in exposed humans.

An additional study has shown PFOA to be developmentally toxic, hepatotoxic, immunotoxic, and to have negative effects of thyroid hormone production. Criteria have been proposed that would allow PFOA, and other perfluorinated compounds, to be classified as &quot;weakly non-specific genotoxic&quot;.

=== Human data ===
PFOA is resistant to degradation by natural processes such as metabolism, hydrolysis, photolysis, or biodegradation and has been found to persist in the environment. PFOA is found in environmental and biological fluids as the anion perfluorooctanoate. PFOA can be absorbed from ingestion and can penetrate skin. The acid headgroup of PFOA enables binding to proteins with fatty acid or hormone substrates such as serum albumin, liver fatty acid-binding protein, and the nuclear receptors PPARα and possibly CAR.

In animals, PFOA is mainly present in the liver, blood, and kidneys. PFOA does not accumulate in fat tissue, unlike traditional organohalogen persistent organic pollutants. In humans, PFOA has an average elimination half-life of about three years. Because of this long half-life, PFOA has the potential to bioaccumulate.

The levels of PFOA exposure in humans vary widely. While an average American might have 3 or 4 parts per billion of PFOA present in their blood serum, individuals occupationally exposed to PFOA have had blood serum levels over 100,000 parts per billion (100 parts per million or 0.01%) recorded. While no amount of PFOA in humans is legally recognized as harmful, DuPont was &quot;not satisfied&quot; with data showing their Chinese workers accumulated an average of about 2,250 parts per billion of PFOA in their blood from a starting average of around 50 parts per billion less than a year prior.

==== Consumers ====
Single cross-sectional studies on consumers have been published noting multiple associations. Blood serum levels of PFOA were associated with an increased time to pregnancy—or &quot;infertility&quot;—in a 2009 study. PFOA exposure was associated with decreased semen quality, increased serum alanine aminotransferase levels, and increased occurrence of thyroid disease. In a study of 2003–2004 US samples, a higher (9.8 milligram per deciliter) total cholesterol level was observed when the highest quartile was compared to the lowest. Along with other related compounds, PFOA exposure was associated with an increased risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in a study of US children aged 12–15. In a paper presented at the 2009 annual meeting of the International Society of Environmental Epidemiology, PFOA appeared to act as an endocrine disruptor by a potential mechanism on breast maturation in young girls. A C8 Science Panel status report noted an association between exposure in girls and a later onset of puberty.

Other impacts on exposure in utero

PFOA exposure on thyroid function has also been a topic of concern, and has found to negatively impact thyroid stimulating hormone even at low levels when exposed during fetal development. PFOA is also shown to have obesogenic effects, and an experimental study found a positive correlation to low-dose prenatal exposure of PFOA and prevalence of overweight and high waist circumference in females at age 20. A correlation between in utero PFOA exposure and mental performance has yet to be established, as many studies have resulted in insignificant results. For example, a study conducted near Parkersburg, West Virginia did not find a significant association between in utero PFOA exposure and performance of math skills or reading performance in children ages 6 to 12 living in the PFOA-contaminated water district. Based on a cohort study conducted in the Mid-Ohio Valley, no clear association was found between prenatal exposure to PFOA and birth defects, although a possible association with brain defects was observed and requires further research and assessment.

Extrapolated epidemiological data suggests a slight association between PFOA exposure and low birth weight. This was consistent based on blood levels of PFOA metabolites regardless of the geographic residence of subjects. Generally, the findings among human fetuses exposed to the chemical were considerably less drastic than what was seen in mice studies. Because of this, studies linking exposure to low birth weight can be considered inconclusive. PFOA exposure in the Danish general population was not associated with an increased risk of prostate, bladder, pancreatic, or liver cancer. Maternal PFOA levels were not associated with an offspring&#x27;s increased risk of hospitalization due to infectious diseases, behavioral and motor coordination problems, or delays in reaching developmental milestones.

==== Employees and DuPont exposed community ====
In 2010, the three members of the C8 Science Panel published a review of the epidemiological evidence on PFOA exposure in &quot;Environmental Health Perspectives&quot;. Insufficient evidence exists to conclude PFOA causes adverse health effects in humans, but consistent evidence exists on associations with higher cholesterol and uric acid. Whether or not these potential effects result in an increase in cardiovascular disease is unknown. Further data on the 69,030 member cohort that is being studied by the panel is scheduled for release through 2012. A 2011 epidemiological study demonstrated &quot;probable link&quot; between PFOA and kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, pre-eclampsia and ulcerative colitis.

Facial birth defects, an effect observed in rat offspring, occurred with the children of two out of seven female DuPont employees from the Washington Works facility from 1979 to 1981. Bucky Bailey is one of the affected individuals; DuPont, however, does not accept any liability from the toxicity of PFOA. While 3M sent DuPont results from a study that showed birth defects to rats administered PFOA and DuPont moved the women out of the Teflon production unit, subsequent animal testing led DuPont to conclude there was no reproductive risk to women, and they were returned to the production unit. However, data released in March 2009 on the community around DuPont&#x27;s Washington Works plant showed &quot;a modest, imprecise indication of an elevation in risk ... above the 90th percentile ... based on 12 cases in the uppermost category&quot;, which was deemed &quot;suggestive of a possible relationship&quot; between PFOA exposure and birth defects.

== Legal actions ==
=== International action: Stockholm Convention ===
PFOA was proposed for listing under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in 2015, and on May 10, 2019, PFOA, its salts, and PFOA-related compounds were added to Annex A of the Stockholm Convention by the Conference of the Parties. Several hundred salts and precursors of PFOA fall within the scope of the restriction. A few specific exemptions remained. Among them is a time-bound exemption for PFOA in fire-fighting foam.

=== Industry and legal actions ===
DuPont has used PFOA for over 50 years at its Washington Works plant. Area residents sued DuPont in August 2001 and claimed DuPont released PFOA in excess of their community guideline of 1 part per billion resulting in lower property values and increased risk of illness. The class was certified by Wood Circuit Court Judge George W. Hill. As part of the settlement, DuPont has paid for blood tests and health surveys of residents believed to be affected. Participants numbered 69,030 in the study, which was reviewed by three epidemiologists—the C8 Science Panel—to determine if any health effects are the likely result of exposure.

On December 13, 2005, DuPont announced a settlement with the EPA in which DuPont would pay US$10.25 million in fines and an additional US$6.25 million for two supplemental environmental projects without any admission of liability.

On September 30, 2008, Chief Judge Joseph R. Goodwin of the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia denied the certification of a class of Parkersburg residents exposed to PFOA from DuPont&#x27;s facility because they did not &quot;show the common individual injuries needed to certify a class action&quot;. On September 28, 2009, Judge Goodwin dismissed the claims of those residents except for medical monitoring. By 2015, more than three thousand plaintiffs have filed personal-injury lawsuits against DuPont. In 2017, DuPont reached a $670.7 million cash settlement related to 3,550 personal injury lawsuits tied to PFOA contamination of drinking water in the Parkersburg area. Chemours, which was spun off from DuPont in 2015, agreed to pay half the settlement. Both companies denied any wrongdoing.

Jersey

The government of Jersey has signed a confidential deal with 3M in 2005, agreeing to not pursue legal claims for £2.6m. Jersey must assist 3M in the defense of future claims.

A source told the Guardian that Jersey needed 3M’s permission to proceed with blood tests to avoid 3M punitive measures. “The state got an agreement to do individual blood tests, but not screening, as that could be the first step towards a possible class action lawsuit.” PFAS case Lawyer Rob Bylot stated: “I’ve not seen something like this where there’s an agreement to try to help the company against claims by others,” he said. “Particularly if it’s something affecting public health and safety or research.”

=== U.S. federal government actions ===
In 2002, a panel of toxicologists, including several from EPA, proposed a level of 150 ppb for drinking water in the PFOA contaminated area around DuPont&#x27;s Washington Works plant. This initially proposed level was much higher than any known environmental concentration and was over 2,000 times the level EPA eventually settled on for the drinking water health advisory.

In July 2004, EPA filed a suit against DuPont alleging &quot;widespread contamination&quot; of PFOA near the Parkersburg, West Virginia plant &quot;at levels exceeding the company&#x27;s community exposure guidelines;&quot; the suit also alleged that &quot;DuPont had—over a 20 year period—repeatedly failed to submit information on adverse effects (in particular, information on liver enzyme alterations and birth defects in offspring of female Parkersburg workers).&quot;

In October 2005, a USFDA study was published revealing PFOA and PFOA precursor chemicals in food contact and PTFE products.

On January 25, 2006, EPA announced a voluntary program with several chemical companies to reduce PFOA and PFOA precursor emissions by the year 2015.

On February 15, 2005, EPA&#x27;s Science Advisory Board (SAB) voted to recommended that PFOA should be considered a &quot;likely human carcinogen&quot;.

On May 26, 2006, EPA&#x27;s SAB addressed a letter to Administrator Stephen L. Johnson. Three-quarters of advisers thought the stronger &quot;likely to be carcinogenic&quot; descriptor was warranted, in opposition to EPA&#x27;s own PFOA hazard descriptor of &quot;suggestive evidence of carcinogenicity, but not sufficient to assess human carcinogenic potential&quot;.

On November 21, 2006, EPA ordered DuPont to offer alternative drinking water or treatment for public or private water users living near DuPont&#x27;s Washington Works plant in West Virginia (and in Ohio), if the level of PFOA detected in drinking water is equal to or greater than 0.5 parts per billion. This measure sharply lowered the previous action level of 150 parts per billion that was established in March 2002.

According to a May 23, 2007, &quot;Environmental Science &amp; Technology&quot; Online article, U.S. Food and Drug Administration research regarding food contact papers as a potential source of PFOA to humans is ongoing.

In November 2007, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published data on PFOA concentrations comparing 1999–2000 vs. 2003–2004 NHANES samples.

On January 15, 2009, EPA set a provisional health advisory level of 0.4 ppb in drinking water.

On May 19, 2016, EPA lowered the drinking water health advisory level to 0.07 ppb for PFOA and PFOS. In June 2022 the agency issued updated advisories, stating that &quot;some negative health effects may occur with concentrations of PFOA or PFOS in water that are near zero and below EPA&#x27;s ability to detect at this time.&quot; EPA also issued new health advisories for GenX and PFBS.

In October 2021 the EPA proposed to designate PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances in its PFAS Strategic Roadmap. In September 2022 the EPA proposed to designate as hazardous substances under the Superfund Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA).

In March 2023 EPA published a proposed rule for public water systems, covering PFOA and five other PFAS chemicals.

=== U.S. state government actions ===

==== New Jersey ====
In 2007 the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) announced that it found PFOA at &quot;elevated levels in the system&#x27;s drinking water near DuPont&#x27;s massive Chambers Works chemical plant&quot;.

In 2018 the state published a drinking water standard for PFNA. Public water systems in New Jersey are required to meet a maximum contaminant level (MCL) standard of 13 ppt.

In 2019 New Jersey filed lawsuits against the owners of two plants that had manufactured PFASs (the Chambers Works and the Parlin plant in Sayreville), and two plants that were cited for water pollution from other chemicals. The companies cited are DuPont, Chemours and 3M.

In 2020 the NJDEP set a PFOA standard at 14 ppt and a PFOS standard at 13 ppt.

==== New York ====
In 2018 the New York State Department of Health adopted drinking water standards of 10 ppt for PFOA and 10 ppt for PFOS, effective in 2019 after a public comment period.

==== Michigan ====
In November 2017, the Michigan PFAS Action Response Team (MPART) was created to address growing pollution concerns after multiple sites contaminated by PFAS were identified. MPART is a multi-agency team tasked with investigating PFAS contamination sites and sources in the state, protecting drinking water, enhancing interagency communication and keeping the public informed.

In January 2018, Michigan established a legally enforceable groundwater cleanup level of 70 ppt for both PFOA and PFOS. Two science advisory committees were also created and joined MPART to &quot;coordinate and review medical and environmental health, PFAS science and develop evidence-based recommendations&quot;.

In August 2020, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy adopted stricter drinking water standards in the form of MCLs, lowering acceptable levels from the 2018 enforceable groundwater cleanup levels of 70 ppt to 8 ppt for PFOA and 16 ppt for PFOS and adding MCLs for 5 previously unregulated PFAS compounds PFNA, PFHxA, PFHxS, PFBS, and HFPO-DA.

==== Minnesota ====
In 2007, the Minnesota Department of Health lowered its Health Based Value for PFOA in drinking water from 1.0 ppb to 0.5 ppb, where &quot;the sources are landfilled industrial wastes from a 3M manufacturing plant&quot;.

=== European action ===
PFOA contaminated waste was incorporated into soil improver and spread on agricultural land in Germany, leading to PFOA drinking water contamination of up to 0.519 parts per billion. The German Federal Environmental Agency issued guidelines for the sum of PFOA and PFOS concentrations in drinking water: 0.1 parts per billion for precaution and 0.3 parts per billion for a threshold. Residents were found to have a 6–8 factor increase of PFOA serum levels over unexposed Germans, with average PFOA concentrations in the 22–27 parts per billion range. An expert panel concluded that &quot;concentrations were considered too low to cause overt adverse health effects in the exposed population&quot;.

In the Netherlands, after questions by members of Parliament, the minister of Environment ordered a study into the potential exposure to PFOA of people living in the vicinity of the DuPont factory in Dordrecht. The report was published in March 2016 and concluded that &quot;prior to 2002 residents were exposed to levels of PFOA at which health effects could not be ruled out&quot;. As a result of this, the government commissioned several further studies, including blood tests and measurements in drinking water.

PFOA was identified as a PBT substance in the EU in 2013. It was then included in the candidate list of substances of very high concern. In 2017, PFOA, its salts and PFOA-related substances were added to annex XVII (restriction) of the REACH Regulation.

The EU adopted the listing of PFOA in Annex A of the Stockholm Convention with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/784 of 8 April 2020 and introduced a limit value of 0,025 mg/kg for PFOA including its salts, and at 1 mg/kg for the individual PFOA-related compounds or a combination of those compounds. They also included some specific exemptions. Among them is a time-bound exemption for PFOA in fire-fighting foam.

=== Australian action ===
On August 10, 2016, Australian litigation funder IMF Bentham announced an agreement to fund a class action led by the law firm Gadens against the Australian Department of Defence for economic losses to homeowners, fishers, and farmers resulting from the use of aqueous film forming foam (containing PFOA) at RAAF Base Williamtown.

<text>Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) (conjugate base perfluorooctanesulfonate) is a chemical compound having an eight-carbon fluorocarbon chain and a sulfonic acid functional group, and thus it is a perfluorosulfonic acid and a perfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS). It is an anthropogenic (man-made) fluorosurfactant, now regarded as a global pollutant. PFOS was the key ingredient in Scotchgard, a fabric protector made by 3M, and related stain repellents. The acronym &quot;PFOS&quot; refers to the parent sulfonic acid and to various salts of perfluorooctanesulfonate. These are all colorless or white, water-soluble solids. Although of low acute toxicity, PFOS has attracted much attention for its pervasiveness and environmental impact. It was added to Annex B of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in May 2009.

==History==
In 1949, 3M began producing PFOS-based compounds by electrochemical fluorination. In 1968, organofluorine compounds were detected in the blood serum of consumers, and in 1976, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) or a related compound such as PFOS were suggested as components. In 1997, 3M detected PFOS in blood from global blood banks, although the company&#x27;s internal documents indicate knowledge of this decades earlier, dating from the 1970s. In 1999, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency began investigating perfluorinated compounds after receiving data on the global distribution and toxicity of PFOS, the key ingredient in Scotchgard. For these reasons, and USEPA pressure, the primary American producer of PFOS, 3M, announced, in May 2000, the phaseout of the production of PFOS, PFOA, and PFOS-related products. Most other manufacturers (particularly, those in Europe) phased out the production of PFOS and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in 2000 and 2006, respectively. A shorter-chain PFOS (perfluorohexanesulfonic acid, PFHxS), was included in Annex A to the Stockholm Convention in 2022. 

Currently, most of PFOS and PFOS-related chemicals are produced in China.

==Chemistry==

The main method used for the industrial scale production of PFOS is electrochemical fluorination (ECF). ECF is an electrolysis method whereby the precursor of octanesulfonyl fluoride is electrolyzed in a solution of hydrogen fluoride to give perfluorooctanesulfonyl fluoride. This production method also results in shorter chain perfluoroalkyl substances being formed. PFOS predominates in the resultant mixture. A distinct isomer ratio has been observed in PFOS produced by ECF, in the order of 70% linear PFOS, 25% branched and 5% terminal; this is not a function of the production process but rather that the precursor also exhibits this isomer ratio. ECF was the means by which 3M produced PFOS up until May 2000 when the company announced a phaseout of fluorosurfactants.

Although 89 constitutional isomers of PFOS are possible, environmental samples usually consist of a mixture of the linear isomer and 10 branched isomers.

Telomerisation involves constructing the PFOS molecule using short chain (often 2-carbon) precursors and adding a sulfonate group as a final step. This production process results in 100% linear PFOS. This production method, whilst cleaner and resulting in a much purer product than ECF, is not known to have been widely used except for the production of reagent grade PFOS and analytical standards.

===Indirect routes===
Perfluorooctylsulfonyl compounds degrade to PFOS. Examples include (&quot;N&quot;-MeFOSE), a carpet stain repellent, and (&quot;N&quot;-EtFOSE), a paper treatment. Also perfluorooctanesulfonamide is a precursor. About 50 precursors were named in the 2004 proposed Canadian ban on PFOS.

===Degradation===
PFOS virtually does not degrade under environmental conditions and is thus highly persistent. Waste water treatment plants are also unable to degrade PFOS. On the other hand, precursors are transformed to PFOS in waste water treatment plants.

==Properties==
The C8F17 subunit of PFOS is hydrophobic and lipophobic, like other fluorocarbons, while the sulfonic acid/sulfonate group adds polarity. PFOS is an exceptionally stable compound in industrial applications and in the environment because of the effect of aggregate carbon–fluorine bonds. PFOS is a fluorosurfactant that lowers the surface tension of water more than that of hydrocarbon surfactants.

==Uses==
Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid is usually used as the sodium or potassium salts.

* PFOS was the key ingredient in Scotchgard, a fabric protector made by 3M, and numerous stain repellents.
* PFOS, together with PFOA, has also been used to make &quot;aqueous film forming foam&quot; (AFFF), a component of fire-fighting foams, and alcohol-type concentrate foams.
* PFOS compounds can also be found in some impregnation agents for textiles, paper, and leather; in wax, polishes, paints, varnishes, and cleaning products for general use; in metal surfaces, and carpets.
* In the semiconductor industry, PFOS is used in multiple photolithographic chemicals including: photoacid generators (PAGs) and anti-reflective coatings (ARCs). It has been phased out in the European Union semiconductor industry due to health concerns.
* PFOS is the key ingredient in Skydrol, a fire-resistant hydraulic fluid used in commercial aviation.

The most important emission sources of PFOS are metal plating and fire-fighting foams. Because of concerns about PFOS, F-53B has been used as a replacement for mist suppression in metal plating.

==Levels in humans==
Because of its chemical nature, PFOS will remain in the body for several years. It is estimated that it takes 4 years for half of this substance to be eliminated from the body.

PFOS is detected in the blood serum of almost all people in the U.S., but concentrations have been decreasing over time. In contrast, PFOS blood levels appear to be rising in China where PFOS production continues. A study of ca. 2000 teenagers from 9 European countries with most samples collected in years 2016-2018 found higher blood concentrations of several PFOS’s in those, who consumed more seafood, eggs or offal, as well as in those from North and West (versus the South and East) Europe. Within the same country, boys had a higher PFOS concentrations than girls. A typical PFOS blood concentration range in this study was 1,500–2,500 ppb.
Much higher levels of blood PFOS (12,830 ppb) have been reported in people with occupational exposure —or possibly 1,656 parts per billion—in a consumer. Occupationally exposed individuals may have an average level of PFOS over 1000 parts per billion, and a small segment of individuals in the upper range of the general population may be over the 91.5 parts per billion level.

PFOS exposure has been demonstrated as early as fetal development during pregnancy since PFOS can easily pass through the placenta. It has been shown that fetal exposure to PFOS is quite prevalent and has been shown to be detected in greater than 99% of umbilical cord serum samples.

PFOS has been detected in U.S. freshwater fish, as well as in municipal wastewater and drinking water samples, worldwide, at concentrations ranging between few ng/L and some μg/L.

==Levels in wildlife==
A variety of wildlife species have had PFOS levels measured in egg, liver, kidney, serum, and plasma samples and some of the highest recorded values as of January 2006 are listed below.
Despite the global wide-ranging restriction, PFOS concentrations in air continued to increase at many monitoring stations between 2009 and 2017.

==Health effects in humans and wildlife==
There is a growing body of research investigating the health effects of PFOS in humans and animals, including the reproductive, developmental, liver, kidney, thyroid, and immunological effects. According to a 2002 report by the Environmental Directorate of the OECD, &quot;PFOS is persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic to mammalian species.&quot;

=== Pregnancy outcomes ===
Several studies have focused on pregnancy outcomes in infants and mothers who are exposed to PFOS during pregnancy. For developing offspring, exposure to PFOS occurs through the placenta. While the impact of PFOS compounds on fetal development continues to be an ongoing investigation, findings have demonstrated a relationship between PFOS exposure in pregnant mothers and negative birth outcomes.

There has been some evidence to suggest that PFOS levels in pregnant women have been associated with preeclampsia, preterm labor, low birth weight and gestational diabetes. Although, the strongest association is between PFOS levels with preterm birth and preeclampsia. There has been some evidence to suggest that PFOS impairs fetal growth during pregnancy, although findings have been inconsistent.

The specific physiological mechanisms behind adverse pregnancy outcomes with PFOS exposure remain unclear. One proposed cause has to do with PFOS impairment on placental blood flow. This mechanism could help explain several of the pregnancy-related outcomes from PFOS exposure including such as intrauterine growth development, low birth weight, preterm birth labor, and preeclampsia. Additional physiological mechanisms may include disruption in inflammatory signals during pregnancy, decreased trophoblast signaling and trophoblast migration. Additionally, PFOS exposure has been shown to be related to the downregulation genes corresponding to growth factors, pregnancy-related signal transducers, and maternal hormones. PFOS impact on thyroid hormone regulation also has the potential to impact several birth outcomes.

=== Breastfeeding and lactation ===
PFOS has been measured in breastmilk and is estimated to contribute the greatest level of PFOS exposure in infants. Specifically, the duration of breastfeeding has been shown to be associated with increases in PFOS in infants. Some evidence has shown that breastmilk accounts for more than 94% of the PFOS exposure in infants up to six months old. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) concluded that breastfeeding benefits continue to outweigh potential risks associated with PFOS in breastmilk.

=== Thyroid disease ===
Increased levels of PFOS have been shown to accumulate in thyroid gland cells and have been associated with altered thyroid hormone levels in adults. Appropriate levels of thyroid hormone during pregnancy are critical for a developing fetus as this hormone is involved with brain development and body growth. Studies have demonstrated a relationship between PFOS exposure and thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy resulting in altered thyroid hormone levels in both the mother and the fetus.

=== Hypercholesterolemia ===
PFOS has been associated with increased risk of abnormal levels of cholesterol. Specifically, epidemiological studies in humans have reported an association between increased PFOS levels and the total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.

=== Chronic kidney disease ===
Serum levels of PFOS were found to be associated with increased risk of chronic kidney disease in the general US population. &quot;This association was independent of confounders such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, and serum cholesterol level.&quot;

=== Cancer ===
Research demonstrating the association between PFOS and cancer is still ongoing. A few studies have demonstrated an elevated risk for prostate and bladder cancer, however, there were notable limitations in the design and analysis of these studies. As of November 2023, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified PFOS as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2b) based on “strong” mechanistic evidence. The Division of Cancer Epidemiology &amp; Genetics (DCEG) is currently investigating the association of several PFAS compounds and cancers including kidney cancer, testicular cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian and endometrial cancer, thyroid cancer, non-hodgkins lymphoma, and childhood leukemia.

=== In wildlife ===
The levels observed in wild animals are considered sufficient to &quot;alter health parameters&quot;.

PFOS affects the immune system of male mice at a blood serum concentration of 91.5 parts per billion, raising the possibility that highly exposed people and wildlife are immunocompromised. Chicken eggs dosed at 1 milligram per kilogram (or 1 part per million) of egg weight developed into juvenile chickens with an average of ~150 parts per billion in blood serum—and showed brain asymmetry and decreased immunoglobulin levels.

==Regulation==
===Globally===
It was added to Annex B of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in May 2009. Originally, parties agreed on acceptable proposes (time-unlimited exemptions) for the following uses—in addition to a range of specific exemptions (time-limited):
* Photo-imaging
* Photo-resist and anti-reflective coatings for semi-conductors
* Etching agent for compound semi-conductors and ceramic filters
* Aviation hydraulic fluids
* Metal plating (hard metal plating) only in closed-loop systems
* Certain medical devices (such as ethylene tetrafluoroethylene copolymer (ETFE) layers and radio-opaque ETFE production, in-vitro diagnostic medical devices, and CCD colour filters)
* Fire-fighting foam
* Insect baits for control of leaf-cutting ants from &quot;Atta spp.&quot; and &quot;Acromyrmex spp.&quot;

In 2019, it was decided to only keep one acceptable purpose:
* Insect baits with sulfluramid (CAS No. 4151-50-2) as an active ingredient for control of leaf-cutting ants from &quot;Atta&quot; spp. and &quot;Acromyrmex&quot; spp. for agricultural use only

===Canada===
In 2023, the Government of Canada is considering addressing PFAS as a class rather than as individual substances or in smaller groups. A report to conclude that PFAS as a class are harmful to human health and the environment, and to define risk management aspects and alternatives to PFAs, is under development.&quot;Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)&quot;

===Europe===
Based on an OECD study on PFOS and a risk assessment by Europe&#x27;s Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks the European Union practically banned the use of PFOS in finished and semi-finished products in 2006 (maximum content of PFOS: 0.005% by weight). However, PFOS use for industrial applications (e.g. photolithography, mist suppressants for hard chromium plating, hydraulic fluids for aviation) was exempted.
In 2009 this directive was incorporated into the REACH regulation. In the summer of 2010 PFOS was added to the regulation on persistent organic pollutants and the threshold was lowered to max. 0.001% by weight (10 mg/kg).

===United States===
In 2018 the State of Michigan established a legally enforceable groundwater cleanup level of 70 ppt for both PFOA and PFOS.

In 2020 the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) adopted stricter drinking water standards in the form of maximum contaminant levels (MCLs), lowering acceptable levels from the 2018 enforceable groundwater cleanup levels of 70 ppt to 8 ppt for PFOA and 16 ppt for PFOS and adding MCLs for 5 previously unregulated PFAS compounds PFNA, PFHxA, PFHxS, PFBS, and HFPO-DA.

In 2020, a California bill was passed banning PFOS and the following salts as an intentionally added ingredient from cosmetics: ammonium perfluorooctane sulfonate, diethanolamine perfluorooctane sulfonate, lithium perfluorooctane sulfonate and potassium perfluorooctane sulfonate.

In March 2021 the U.S. EPA announced that it will develop national drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS.

In October 2021 the EPA proposed to designate PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances in its PFAS Strategic Roadmap. In September 2022 the EPA proposed to designate as hazardous substances under the Superfund Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA).

<text>Meru is a town in eastern Kenya. It is the headquarters of the Meru County, and the seventh largest urban centre in the country. Meru urban centre had a population of 80,191 residents during the 2019 census.

==Overview==

The town is located at 0.047035 degrees north and 37.649803 degrees east, on the northeast slopes of Mount Kenya. The Kathita River passes adjacent to the town. The main administrative part of the town is on the north side of the Kathita River. While the south side of the river is where residential areas are situated. Meru Town is situated about 8 km north of the equator, at an altitude of approximately 1500 m, in an area of mixed forest and clearings, small towns, villages and rural farms. The town is predominantly populated by the Ameru people, a Bantu ethnic group. In addition there are other people having different and diverse religions, cultures and all walks of life who live, trade and work in this agricultural and commercial town.

==History==
 first District Commissioner was Edward Butler Horne. The Meru nicknamed him Kangangi, meaning the little wanderer due to his short stature and the fact that he traveled around Meru a lot as he surveyed the District. This was at a time when the Meru community lived a fairly settled life in ridge-top communities. The city&#x27;s foundation in its present location was as a result of the military limitations of E. B. Horne&#x27;s original camp at Mwitari&#x27;s (homestead).

In 1912, according to Madeleine Laverne Platts, wife of W. A. F. Platts, Meru&#x27;s first Assistant District Commissioner:
&quot;Short [E. B.] Horne had laid out a nice little golf course. 500 local girls were paid to cut the grass by plucking it out with their fingers. Next to the golf course stood a large, handsome log house, in which the door opened to reveal mud floors on which a large hat-stand stood gaunt and proud within a pool of water.&quot;

As E.B. Horne was settling in Meru, Methodist leaders were seeking expansion. John B. Griffiths, a Welshman minister previously working at the Kenya coast, petitioned the colonial government to grant the entire Embu region to the Methodists as an exclusive religious sphere. The request was denied because the government considered it unsafe. Griffiths then applied a second time, requesting that the comparatively &quot;peaceful&quot; Meru district be regarded as the exclusive sphere of the United Methodist church. In December 1909 the government agreed.
Griffiths&#x27;s party arrived at &quot;Fort Meru&quot; in October 1909, to be met by E. B. Horne who allotted the Methodists a plot of land at Ka-Aga. This was then a spirit forest, known to the Meru as the “place of curse removers [Aga]”, less than two miles north east of his new administrative headquarters.

Griffiths&#x27;s subsequent report of his expedition described Meru as a land of &quot;hills, valleys, and innumerable streams.&quot; 
He found it

&quot;unlike any other area in Africa: Its hills are covered with ferns, hedges are thick with blackberry bushes, and in the streams watercress abounds . . . [and] mosquitoes are unknown. . . . We have been toiling for fifty years in the sweltering climate of the coast, contending with tremendous difficulties, bitter disappointments and deaths. We have been for years meditating upon seeking another and better country in which our men can live and labor and reap. SIR, HERE IT IS. THE FUTURE OF OUR EAST AFRICAN MISSION LIES HERE. I implore the committee to enter it”.

In January 1912, Griffiths and Reverend Frank Mimmack occupied the allotted site and begun construction of the first buildings. They were later joined by Rev. Reginald T. Worthington. This site in Kaaga has grown to be Meru&#x27;s Education Centre, with a National School, A leading school for students with special needs, two provincial schools and two Primary schools.

In 1956, The Methodist Mission approached the Meru County Council and requested to be allotted land. Their request was granted and they were allotted 50 acres of land where they established the Methodist Training Institute in 1958. This institute grew over the years and merged with two other colleges to become The Kenya Methodist University.

==Climate==
Meru has a cool subtropical highland climate (Csb) with heavy rainfall from March to May and from October to December. It has little rainfall in January and February and from June to September.
==Transport==
The town of Meru is linked to Nairobi by a tarmac road named B6, from the south around the east side of Mount Kenya, via Embu, or from the northwest around the west and north side of Mount Kenya, via Nanyuki and Timau. An international airport is situated at Isiolo, 35 Kilometres away, via a new tarmac road through Ruiri. Within the town, the roads have seen a lot of improvement after the maintenance of urban roads was transferred to the Kenya Urban Roads Authority, which in turn set up its Upper Eastern Regional Headquarters in Meru.

==Tourism and hospitality==
Meru town is a jumping-off place for Samburu and Buffalo Springs National Reserves and Lewa Conservancy, all some distance north of Meru, with Samburu and Buffalo Springs via Isiolo, and Meru National Park, to the northeast of Meru, via Maua in the Nyambene Hills.

The Meru Museum is housed in Meru&#x27;s first District Commissioner&#x27;s Office, built by E. B. Horne. It preserves the historical and cultural artifacts of the Meru people.

It is at Rutundu log cabins 20 Kilometre west of Meru City that Prince William proposed to the Duchess of Cambridge. The Meru side of Mt. Kenya National Park has tourist attractions of worth which include Vivvien Falls, Semwe Salt lick, Ithanguni, Lake Alice, Lake Ellis and Sacred Lake.

==Commerce==
Meru town is the Commercial capital of Northern and Eastern Kenya. It hosts a Central Bank of Kenya’s Currency Centre serving the North Eastern Half of Kenya. Meru has 22 bank branches. Kenya&#x27;s Banks, Equity, Postbank, Barclays, Standard Chartered Co-Operative, Diamond Trust, National Bank and Family Bank, CBA, Fina Bank, K-rep Bank, Eco-BAnk, CFC stanbic, NIC, Housing Finance, KCB, Bank of Baroda, have branches in the town while several micro-finance institutions are also available. Mwalimu Cooperative Savings &amp; Credit Society Limited, (Mwalimu Sacco), the largest Sacco in Kenya, maintains a branch in Meru. The town is the business and agricultural centre for north-eastern Kenya.

==Education==
Meru town is an educational centre for the northeast of Kenya. There are many primary and secondary schools, including the Meru Primary, Meru School, Kaaga Girls, Kaaga Boys just to name a few. There are also technical schools, the Meru Technical Institute being the major one. There are also teacher training colleges, campuses of various universities including [[Mount Kenya University], Nairobi, among others. Its main universities are, Meru University of Science and Technology (MUST) and Kenya Methodist University, both of which have their main campus within and near Meru town.

Some other institutions of higher learning in Meru town include:

*Kenya Medical Training College, Meru Campus
*Meru Technical Training Institute
*Nkabune Technical Institute
*Africa Nazarene University, Meru Campus
*University of Nairobi Extra Mural Centre situated in the Posta Building
*Kenya Institute of Management – Alexander House

<doc id="824767" wikidata="Q1463415" url="?curid=824767" title="Inverted microscope">
<text>An inverted microscope is a microscope with its light source and condenser on the top, above the stage pointing down, while the objectives and turret are below the stage pointing up. It was invented in 1850 by J. Lawrence Smith, a faculty member of Tulane University (then named the Medical College of Louisiana).

==Construction==
The stage of an inverted microscope is usually fixed, and focus is adjusted by moving the objective lens along a vertical axis to bring it closer to or further from the specimen. The focus mechanism typically has a dual concentric knob for coarse and fine adjustment.

Depending on the size of the microscope, four to six objective lenses of different magnifications may be fitted to a rotating turret known as a nosepiece. These microscopes may also be fitted with accessories for fitting still and video cameras, fluorescence illumination, confocal scanning and many other applications.

==Biological applications==
Inverted microscopes are useful for observing living cells or organisms at the bottom of a large container (e.g., a tissue culture flask) under more natural conditions than on a glass slide, as is the case with a conventional microscope.
An inverted microscope is also used for visualisation of the &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; bacteria in the technique called Microscopic Observation Drug Susceptibility assay (MODS).

==Micromanipulation==
Inverted microscopes are used in micromanipulation applications where space above the specimen is required for manipulator mechanisms and the microtools they hold, and in metallurgical applications where polished samples can be placed on top of the stage and viewed from underneath using reflecting objectives.

<doc id="824773" wikidata="Q44513" url="?curid=824773" title="Willy Sagnol">
<text>Willy David Frédéric Sagnol (born 18 March 1977) is a French professional football manager and former player who played as a defender. He is currently the manager of the Georgia national team.

Sagnol spent much of his professional career playing for Bayern Munich in Germany&#x27;s Bundesliga. He was also part of the French squad at the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship, 2002 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 2004, 2006 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2008.

As a manager, he had a two-year period in charge of Bordeaux before being appointed as coach of Georgia in 2021, subsequently leading them to their first ever major tournament by qualifying for UEFA Euro 2024.

==Club career==
Sagnol first made his way in the world of football at his father&#x27;s former club in Haute-Loire, Montfaucon-en-Velay where he developed his defensive game at right back, as well as performing exceptionally on the right side of midfield.

===Saint-Étienne===
From Montfaucon he progressed, eventually joining the region&#x27;s flagship club Saint-Étienne.

===Monaco===
An impressive two-year spell saw him earn a transfer to Monaco in 1997. With Monaco, he experienced his first taste of success, winning Division 1 in 2000. Sagnol also played in Jean Tigana&#x27;s talented Monaco team which knocked Manchester United out of the UEFA Champions League in 1998 on away goals after a 1–1 draw at Old Trafford. His form saw him pressing for a call up to represent France internationally, but he was initially overlooked by national coach Roger Lemerre.

===Bayern Munich===
In the summer of 2000, Sagnol transferred to German club Bayern Munich, and did not take long to break into the first team. A solid defender but also equally comfortable operating in attacking positions (often as a wing back), Sagnol&#x27;s superb crossing ability marked him out as a key player in Bayern&#x27;s attacking play. With the Bavarian club, he won the Bundesliga in 2001, 2003, 2005, 2006, and 2008; the UEFA Champions League in 2001; and the DFB-Pokal in 2003, 2005, 2006, and 2008.

Because of continuing problems with his Achilles tendon, Sagnol announced his retirement from playing on 1 February 2009.

==International career==
At international level, he had less success, often finding himself on the bench playing second fiddle to Lilian Thuram on the right side of the French defence. It was not until the retirement of Marcel Desailly and Thuram&#x27;s consequent move into the centre of the French defence that Sagnol finally became first-choice right back in 2004, and remained there for the next four years.

Sagnol was part of France&#x27;s squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, starting each of his country&#x27;s seven games en route to the final. His competent performances, aided by France&#x27;s progression to the final led to him being named as one of the outstanding defensive performers in the tournament. He saved his best display for the biggest stage of them all, the World Cup final, and was one of the better performers in a game largely remembered for off-the-ball events rather than on-the-field performances. Indeed, Sagnol&#x27;s name could have been immortalised had his strong effort on goal not been successfully repelled by Gianluigi Buffon. Nonetheless, his performance was notable for a solid defensive contribution as well as important involvement in several attacking moves, such as when he provided a cross for his captain Zinedine Zidane, whose header was again saved by Buffon. Sagnol also took and scored the final spot kick for France in the shoot-out, which they lost 5–3.

In the qualification campaign for UEFA Euro 2008, fans saw a completely new side of Sagnol. On several occasions, Sagnol had good efforts on goal as well as still supplying his trademark crosses for teammates like Thierry Henry against Scotland at Hampden Park on 7 October 2006. Sagnol was one of his country&#x27;s better performers in France&#x27;s shock loss, having three efforts on goal from his right back spot, one in particular forcing a save from Scottish goalkeeper Craig Gordon. The following match, against the Faroe Islands in Paris, was his 50th for his country. His displays in that qualification campaign once more provided proof that Sagnol could be counted on for his consistent defensive play and also to provide extra quality when joining the attack.

==Coaching career==
===Girondins de Bordeaux===
Sagnol was head coach of the France national under-21 team until he was appointed head coach of Girondins de Bordeaux on 23 May 2014. He signed a two-year contract which expired on 30 June 2016. Girondins de Bordeaux originally wanted Zinedine Zidane as their head coach. This was Sagnol&#x27;s first coaching job at club level. In Sagnol&#x27;s first season, Bordeaux finished sixth in Ligue 1, the round of 32 in the Coupe de France,&lt;ref name=&quot;Girondins Bordeaux » Fixtures &amp; Results 2014/2015&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the round of 16 in the Coupe de la Ligue. The season included a 4–1 win against Monaco, 3–2 win against Paris Saint-Germain, and a 5–0 loss to Olympique Lyonnais.

In the 2015–16 season, Bordeaux defeated AEK Larnaca and Kairat Almaty to qualify for the group stage of the UEFA Europa League.&lt;ref name=&quot;Girondins Bordeaux » Fixtures &amp; Results 2015/2016&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Bordeaux started the league season with a win, four draws, and a loss. On matchday seven, on 23 September 2015, Bordeaux lost to Nice 6–1.

Sagnol was dismissed on 14 March 2016 after a 4–0 loss to Toulouse in the Derby de la Garonne.

===Bayern Munich===
On 9 June 2017, Sagnol re-joined Bayern Munich as an assistant coach under Carlo Ancelotti. Ancelotti was dismissed by the club on 28 September 2017 and Sagnol was announced as interim manager. After managing Bayern for eight days and one match (a 2–2 draw against Hertha BSC), Sagnol left the club when permanent manager Jupp Heynckes and his assistants Peter Hermann and Hermann Gerland were announced.

===Georgia===
Sagnol was appointed the manager of the Georgia national team on 15 February 2021. In 2024, he led them to their first ever major international tournament, UEFA Euro 2024, after defeating Greece in the qualifying play-off final on penalties. He led Georgia to the knockout stage of the final tournament following a 2–0 victory against Portugal in the last group game.

==Personal life==
He is married and has four children.

<doc id="824781" wikidata="Q6237146" url="?curid=824781" title="John H. Wilson (Hawaii politician)">
<text>John Henry Wilson (December 15, 1871 – July 3, 1956), nicknamed Johnny Wilson, was an American Hawaiian civil engineer, insurgent, co-founder of the Democratic Party of Hawaii, and Mayor of Honolulu, Hawaii three times: from 1920 to 1927, from 1929 to 1931, and from 1946 to 1954.

== Early years ==
Wilson was born in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1871. His father was Charles B. Wilson (1850–1926), whose ethnic background was Scottish and Tahitian. C.B. Wilson was superintendent of the water works and fire chief under King Kalākaua, and was Marshal of the Kingdom under Queen Liliʻuokalani. His mother was three quarters of European descent and one quarter Native Hawaiian, Eveline M. &quot;Kitty or Kittie&quot; Townsend, granddaughter of Captain Henry Blanchard of the ship &quot;Thaddeus&quot; which had brought the first missionaries of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions to Hawaii in 1820.

Wilson attended the Fort Street School and St. Alban&#x27;s College. After graduating, he worked odd jobs on the West Coast, Hawaii, and Alaska. A construction job that he took in 1890 with Oahu Railway &amp; Land led him to pursue civil engineering as a career. With financial support from the Queen, he enrolled at Stanford University in 1891. However, lack of funds after the overthrow of the monarchy in 1893 forced him to leave Stanford in 1894. While on the mainland he was approached by revolutionaries looking for suppliers for the 1895 Counter-Revolution in Hawaii, and attempt to restore the monarchy. He took part in the smuggling of guns and ammunition to Maui as part of the arms buildup by rebel forces. After the failed revolution he spoke little about his role in fearing he would be arrested for treason. He admitted he smuggled guns and was of rank to participate in planning his mission. He planned to land a ship of insurgents from Maui to attack Honolulu, but was the mission was aborted after the revolution was exposed and martial law was activated.

In 1896 he once again joined Oahu Railway &amp; Land and worked on a survey for a carriage road over the Nuʻuanu Pali. Armed with this knowledge, he and fellow Stanford student Louis Whitehouse bid for and won the contract to build the road, completing the road in January 1898.

== Political career ==
Wilson served as roads engineer for both Maui and Honolulu counties. He was in a meeting on April 30, 1900 that organized the Democratic Party of Hawaii. He married hula practitioner Kini Kapahu on May 8, 1909. They moved to Molokaʻi and lived in the Pelekunu Valley before returning to Honolulu in 1919.

His first political campaign was for a seat in the Territorial Senate in 1918, which he lost. However, upon the death of Mayor Joseph J. Fern in 1920, Wilson was selected by the Board of Supervisors to succeed him.

Wilson served three times as mayor, from 1920 to 1927, 1929 to 1931, and from 1946 to 1954, a total of 19 years. As mayor, Wilson oversaw the completion of Honolulu Hale, which was completed in 1929 and consolidated the functions of the city&#x27;s government. He also served on some territorial commissions, including coordinating the state holiday, Kamehameha Day, until 1956.

Following World War II Wilson considered retirement he had been &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the Democratic Party of the original five founders only two remained. David Kawānanakoa died in 1908, John S. McGrew died in 1911, and Charles J. McCarthy died in 1929. Delbert E. Metzger was a Federal Judge and powerful Democrat but his judicial career reduced his participation in politics this left Wilson as leader. Wilson preferred to leave the party in good hands. An ambitious detective named John A. Burns emerged as a successor Wilson could pass the torch to.

In his 80s, Wilson was once again a revolutionary as a key member of a nonviolent revolution called the Democratic Revolution of 1954 that brought his party to power. The early Democrats held a dislike toward Asian-Americans as threats to Hawaiians and the social demographics of Hawaii. But unlike his colleagues, Wilson himself an early Democrat and part-Hawaiian, allowed passage of 442nd veterans into the party, such as Daniel Inouye and Spark Matsunaga. He lived long enough to see the party that had overthrown the monarchy be dethroned themselves, and to some extent accomplishing what he failed in 1895. During this turbulent time Democrats were divided between right-wing &quot;Walkouts&quot; led by Ingram Stainback and the left-wing &quot;Standpats&quot; led by Burns, Wilson was a Standpat. A damaging letter written by Wilson criticizing non-Hawaii-born Democrats alluding to Stainback was considered the major factor in his loss to Republican Neal Blaisdell.

During the late 1950s, Wilson advocated that the territorial government build a tunnel through the Koʻolau Mountains from Honolulu to Kaneohe through Kalihi Valley. The territorial government, however, opted to build the tunnel through the Nuʻuanu Pali. The city eventually proceeded with plans to build a second set of tunnels through Kalihi Valley, which opened in 1961, five years after Wilson&#x27;s death. The tunnels were named the John H. Wilson Tunnels in his honor.

<text>The Fort Victoria or Fort II class is a class of replenishment oiler of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, a role that combines the missions of a tanker and stores supply ship. As such they are designated auxiliary oiler replenisher (AOR). They are tasked with providing ammunition, fuel, food and other supplies to Royal Navy vessels around the world. There were two ships in the class, and ; the latter being taken out of service and despatched for scrapping at a Turkish breakers as a consequence of budgetary cutbacks.

==History==

Six ships were initially planned to supply the Type 23 frigates in their North Atlantic anti-submarine role. The Type 23 was at the time planned to be a low cost, lightly armed vessel and the Fort-class ships were therefore expected to defend themselves with the Sea Wolf vertical launch surface-to-air missile (SAM).

The lessons of the Falklands War meant the Type 23 developed as a much more potent, multi-role vessel carrying the Sea Wolf missile. The requirement for the Fort class was reduced from six to two.

&quot;Fort Victoria&quot; was built by Harland &amp; Wolff and &quot;Fort George&quot; by Swan Hunter and the ships entered service in 1994 and 1993 respectively. &quot;Fort Victoria&quot; was delayed when she was bombed by the IRA on 6 September 1990 and nearly sunk.

In the 2030s, the &quot;Fort Victoria&quot;-class will be succeeded by a new class of three solid support ships, under the Fleet Solid Support Ship Programme.

<doc id="824786" wikidata="Q282008" url="?curid=824786" title="TimeSplitters 2">
<text>TimeSplitters 2 is a first-person shooter video game, developed by Free Radical Design, published by Eidos Interactive, and released in October 2002 for PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameCube. The game&#x27;s story focuses on the efforts of a space marine who seeks to recover powerful time crystals from a race of alien mutants called TimeSplitters, which leads them to taking on the form of an individual dealing with their own problems across different time periods between the 19th and 25th century. The developers focused on expanding the story element following 2000&#x27;s &quot;TimeSplitters&quot;, and features influences from various film genres, including horror, action and science fiction.

Alongside the story mode, which can be played solo or co-operatively, players can also engage in multiplayer modes and create their own maps. The game received generally favorable reviews from critics, who praised its improvements on its predecessor as well as its multiplayer gameplay and graphics, though criticised its story and lack of online gameplay. &quot;TimeSplitters 2&quot; was later followed by a sequel, &quot;&quot;, in 2005.
It is possible to play the first two levels of TimeSplitter 2 in &quot;&quot;, and later levels can be unlocked through the use of a cheat code.

TimesSplitters 2, along with the other games in the trilogy, were rereleased on the PS4 and PS5 as a PS2 Classic in 2024, with trophy support, a rewind feature and improved loading times.

==Gameplay==
&quot;TimeSplitters 2&quot; is a first-person shooter that requires players to kill enemies and complete objectives using a variety of weapons and tactics in different predefined scenarios. Armour and health bars on the sides of the screen lower when the player is shot, which can be increased by walking over body armor and first aid kits.

The weapons of &quot;TimeSplitters 2&quot; include handguns, rifles, submachine guns, shotguns, rocket launchers, a grenade launcher, various explosives, a crossbow, a flamethrower, a fire extinguisher and a brick. They are of many different time periods, from the historical to the futuristic. Some weapons have an alternate fire which activates a feature such as launching a grenade or detonating a remote mine. It is possible to dual wield some weapons.

===Story mode===
The main story mode of &quot;TimeSplitters 2&quot; is divided into ten levels. Each level is in a different time period and contains a series of objectives that must be completed. Some objectives are present at the start of the level, while others are added during play. A few levels have secondary objectives, which are not required to complete unless on the normal or hard difficulty setting. Each level includes a single checkpoint in the middle where the player can restart if they die or fail to complete an objective (with the exception of the last level on any difficulty and the fourth level on easy). For each level, the player must choose from three difficulty levels. These difficulty levels not only change the strength of the enemies, but also increase the length of the level by adding additional objectives; for instance, in both easy and normal levels, there are optional secondary objectives, whereas in the hard levels, all secondary objectives are now primary and must be completed. At the end of every level, a time crystal must be recovered. After it is picked up, a time portal will appear which must be entered in order to complete the level. However, this is sometimes made more difficult by TimeSplitters that teleport to the player&#x27;s location. In secret places of certain levels, there are cartridges of old school arcade games such as &quot;Snake&quot;, that can be picked up and played on the player&#x27;s Temporal Uplink, the device that normally shows the map of the current level.

The game&#x27;s story mode can be played alone or cooperatively with another player. When playing co-op, in order to balance the game, the two players&#x27; health amounts are lowered.

Along with the story mode, there are two single-player modes: an Arcade mode and a Challenge mode where a player is given a scenario and must complete it within certain requirements. The objective ranges from collecting bananas to shooting heads off zombies. After the objective is completed, the game will end, and a medal will be awarded depending on the number of points obtained. Certain medals allow the player to play as new characters in multiplayer or use cheats. Cheats can be turned on in the options menu to activate features such as unlimited ammunition or the ability to shoot paintballs. Free Radical&#x27;s website implies that there are also controller-activated cheats that have never been released. They say they like to keep things &quot;as impossible as possible.&quot;

===Multiplayer===

Arcade mode is the main multiplayer section of &quot;TimeSplitters 2&quot;. It can normally be played with up to four players with each player using a division of the television&#x27;s screen. However, with a System Link, up to sixteen players can participate. System link was not included with the GameCube version. When a player is killed, they are respawned at a random location on the map with full health. Weapons, armour, and other items that enhance players&#x27; abilities are placed in several preset positions scattered about the map. The objective of the game depends on the mode selected. Four are available at the start: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Bag (a version of capture the flag) and BagTag (where a player must survive while in possession of the bag for the longest period of time). There are sixteen game modes in total, But twelve are unavailable until the player beats certain levels of the game.

Several aspects of multiplayer can be customised, such as the weapons, the number of points needed to win, the number of minutes until the end of the game, as well as the music that plays along with the level. There is also a variety of different characters the player can choose to play as, each with their own individual statistics. Some characters are from the Story mode, while there are other more humorous ones such as a dinosaur and an Elvis impersonator. Up to ten computer-controlled bots can be used. Their appearance, difficulty, and team can be customised. The bots can do some acrobatic moves that the player cannot do such as rolls and somersaults.

At the end of each match, the results of the game are shown. This includes the number of points each player or team scored, the weapon the player used most often, as well as awards the player earned. There are nearly 60 awards present in &quot;TimeSplitters 2&quot;. Players are given them based on what they did in the match. Awards are recorded in each player&#x27;s profile which also keeps track of a variety of other statistics.

There is also an Arcade League mode in which one player is placed in an Arcade match with pre-set bots and weapons. There are three difficulty levels of Arcade League: Amateur, Honorary, and Elite. Players must beat them in consecutive order. After a player beats an Arcade League level, a medal is awarded.

A MapMaker is also available that can create playable levels. Levels for Story mode can be made as well as levels for Arcade mode. Created Story levels, however, cannot be played co-operatively. Maps are created by selecting and placing different pre-made tiles and rooms onto a grid. Spawn points, weapons, bags, armour, and objectives can then be placed anywhere on the level. There is a bar in the left side of the screen, representing memory, that lowers each time a tile or item is placed. When the bar depletes completely, nothing else can be placed onto the map. However, items can be deleted to increase memory. A theme can be chosen for each map such as Victorian, Industrial, Alien, and Virtual, which changes how the rooms appear.

Only LAN networks are supported, but online play is possible with the use of PCs and third-party networking software.

==Plot==
In 2401, humanity is in the midst of a war against the TimeSplitters, a sadistic alien race intent on bringing about the destruction of mankind. With the war going against them, the surviving humans of Earth&#x27;s space marine army discover that the TimeSplitters are in possession of special objects called Time Crystals - green crystals that can provide power for time travel, allowing anyone to travel through time to any point in history. Discovering their enemy is attempting to use the Time Crystals to change the course of human history, thus bringing Earth to ruins, space marines Sergeant Cortez and Corporal Hart are sent to a space station overrun by TimeSplitters to retrieve the crystals.

However, the pair&#x27;s arrival forces the TimeSplitters to remove the crystals and scatter them across various moments in human history through a time portal, with the pair arriving just as the last crystal is removed. Sealing themselves into the portal&#x27;s chamber, Hart decides to stay behind and operate the device, while Cortez uses it to track down the crystals. Upon arriving in the first time period, Siberia in 1990, Cortez finds himself taking on the form of a female spy who was sent to investigate unusual activity in the area (in a similar manner to the TV series &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;). Undeterred, Cortez attempts to complete each person&#x27;s agenda in their respective time period, all while tracking down the crystals that have influenced events in that point of history ranging from Notre Dame in 1896, an Aztec temple in 1920, to a major conflict with robots in 2312.

Eventually, Cortez recovers the crystals and returns to 2401 to rendezvous with Hart. But by this time, the TimeSplitters regain access to the portal device and attack the pair, killing Hart in the process. Cortez, left with little time to react, sets the space station to self-destruct, and escapes with the crystals to bring back to Earth, moments before the station is destroyed.

==Development==
In February 1999, 15 months before the release of &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;, several members of Rare that were part of the &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; development team, including Steve Ellis, Karl Hilton, Graeme Norgate, and David Doak, left to form their own company called Free Radical Design. After they developed the first &quot;TimeSplitters&quot;, &quot;TimeSplitters 2&quot; went into development, trying to create a more fulfilling story mode alongside the Arcade and MapMaker modes. The game was developed over a 23-month period, with around half of that time devoted to creating the opening level.

It was also one of the first multi-platform games to be re-released on both the PlayStation 2 &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; and Xbox &quot;Classics&quot; labels.

The location of the health bar and other gameplay features are reminiscent of &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; and &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;. Some gameplay present in &quot;TimeSplitters 2&quot; is also very similar to &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;; both games contain a similar aiming system and both lack the ability to jump.

===Releases===
There are a few minor differences between the console versions of &quot;TimeSplitters 2&quot;. For example, the PlayStation 2 version has a smaller playing field for minigames such as &quot;Anaconda&quot;. This consequently makes high scores on the PlayStation 2 version lower than the Xbox and GameCube versions which both have bigger playing fields for the minigames.

There are four different versions of cover art for the North American release of the game. Some of the versions had a unique tag line for the GameCube and Xbox ports. The GameCube version displayed the quote &quot;Heir apparent to &quot;GoldenEye&quot;&quot;, by Electronic Gaming Monthly. The Xbox version said, &quot;First &quot;Halo&quot;, now this&quot;. Other versions include the Player&#x27;s Choice edition and the original release without the quotes.

Other release changes include removal of the map editor function and the renaming to &quot;Time Splitter: Invaders of the History&quot; on the Japanese release of the PlayStation 2 version. In addition, Europe, France, Japan, South Korea, and the United States each have different box art.

In &quot;PSM3&quot;, Doak expressed interest in remaking &quot;TimeSplitters 2&quot; with HD visuals and online multiplayer.

In an October 2012 interview, Free Radical co-founder Steve Ellis said, &quot;We had a &quot;HD&quot; downloadable version of &quot;TimeSplitters 2&quot; in development at Free Radical in 2008. I don&#x27;t know what happened to that but yes, I&#x27;d love to see it released at some point. Maybe it could be the catalyst that is required in order to raise enough interest in &quot;TimeSplitters 4&quot; that a publisher might want to fund it.&quot;

&quot;&quot;, a game developed by Dambuster Studios (the corporate successor to Free Radical Design in accordance with British business transfer law due to the closure of Crytek UK), contains an easter egg featuring two playable levels from the game, accessible via an arcade cabinet located in one of the main game&#x27;s locations. One of &quot;Homefront&quot; programmers, Matt Phillips, revealed in 2021 that he had placed the whole of &quot;Timesplitters 2&quot; at a 4K resolution as an Easter egg from one specific arcade cabinet, but had lost the code to trigger it. Shortly after announcing this on social media, one of the people that Phillips had shared the code with was able to provide it, proving the existence of the game.

The original Xbox version of &quot;TimeSplitters 2&quot; was made backwards compatible on Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S on November 15, 2021.

==Reception==
The PlayStation 2 version of &quot;TimeSplitters 2&quot; received &quot;universal acclaim&quot;, while the GameCube and Xbox versions received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. It won &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Shooter on GameCube&quot; award, and was nominated for &quot;Best Shooter on Xbox&quot;, which went to &quot;MechAssault&quot;.

In comparison to the first game in the series, &quot;GamePro&quot; called &quot;&quot;TimeSplitters 2&quot; [...] everything the original game was and more&quot; and &quot;outdoes most other PS2 shooters in the process&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; said that the game &quot;may very well be the best split-screen multiplayer-focused first-person shooter ever created.&quot; The publication later named it the best GameCube game of October 2002. IGN concluded that the game was &quot;clearly the best multiplayer first-person shooter on the PlayStation 2&quot;, but commented that it was not story-driven and little empathy was felt for the characters. GameSpy criticized the absence of online play, but complimented the game&#x27;s &quot;great deathmatching action&quot; and the game&#x27;s high frame rate. They also said the game is &quot;everything you could possibly want in a sequel.&quot; &quot;Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine&quot; praised it as &quot;easily one of the best first-person shooters out there—on any system&quot;, but called its lack of online play &quot;criminal.&quot;

During the 6th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;TimeSplitters 2&quot; for &quot;Console First-Person Action Game of the Year&quot;.

The game has also been compared to &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; because of its many similar game elements, shared developers and references to that game, such as both games beginning on a Siberian dam.

==Legacy==
The game features in the film &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; being played by the main characters Shaun and Ed.

The game is also playable within &quot;&quot; as an arcade machine within the Restricted Zone.

<text>Richard Galliano (born 12 December 1950, Cannes, Alpes-Maritimes) is a French accordionist of Italian heritage.

==Biography==

He was drawn to music at an early age, starting with the accordion at 4, influenced by his father Luciano, an accordionist originally from Italy, living in Nice.

After a long and intense period of study (he took up lessons on the trombone, harmony, and counterpoint at the Academy of Music in Nice), at 14, in a search to expand his ideas on the accordion, he began listening to jazz and heard records by the trumpet player Clifford Brown. &quot;I copied all the choruses of Clifford Brown, impressed by his tone and his drive, his way of phrasing over the thunderous playing of Max Roach&quot;. Fascinated by this new world, Richard was amazed that the accordion had never been part of this musical adventure. In this period, Galliano won twice the first prize in the &quot;world accordion cap competition&quot; which took place in Spain (1966) and France (1967). In the Spanish competition, the participants&#x27; duty work was &quot;Chaconne&quot; by the Israeli accordionist Yehuda Oppenheimer. Galliano and Oppenheimer kept up their musical collaboration and personal friendship until Oppenheimer&#x27;s death in 2012.

Some later collaborations include Astor Piazolla, George Mraz, Brigitte Fontaine, Al Foster, Juliette Gréco, Charles Aznavour, Ron Carter, Chet Baker, Enrico Rava, Stefano Bollani, Martial Solal, Miroslav Vitouš, Trilok Gurtu, Jan Garbarek, Michel Petrucciani, Michel Portal, Eddy Louiss, Biréli Lagrène, Sylvain Luc, Renaud Garcia-Fons, Ivan Paduart, Anouar Brahem, Wynton Marsalis, and Toots Thielemans. He was a key member of Claude Nougaro&#x27;s band for several years as a pianist and accordionist.

<doc id="824791" wikidata="Q548450" url="?curid=824791" title="Tripping Daisy">
<text>Tripping Daisy is a neo-psychedelic pop rock band that was formed in Dallas, Texas, by lead singer/guitarist Tim DeLaughter in 1990 along with Jeff Bouck (drums), Wes Berggren (guitar) and Mark Pirro (bass). 

The group disbanded in 1999 following the sudden death of Berggren. The remaining members reformed in 2017 for a reunion performance at the Homegrown Festival in Dallas, following which they played a number of concerts in Texas during 2017, 2019, and 2022. In June 2024, the band officially reformed, and have plans to tour and record a new album.

==History==
===First album===
After playing local gigs, the band released their first single, &quot;Lost and Found&quot;, which received moderate airplay on local radio station KDGE. The band incorporated a light show similar to The Joshua Light Show at the Fillmore East. It used effects such as hand made slide shows with multi layered 16 mm projections along with oil and water. This visual attention was present in their very first show and was the beginning of many multimedia attractions to come.

The band soon began recording what would become their first full-length album, &quot;Bill&quot;, released on the independent label Dragon Street Records. The album was a favorite on Dallas radio. The sound on &quot;Bill&quot; is characterized by the heavy use of vocal effects and unconventional riffs, both of which lend to a neo-psychedelic sound. &quot;Bill&quot; was re-released on major label Island Records, with a different mix and mastering from the Dragon Street version. It also excludes the cover song &quot;Green Tamborine&quot;.

In 1992 Bryan Wakeland replaced Jeff Bouck as the band&#x27;s drummer. The band released a live album in 1994 titled &quot;Get It On&quot;. The album closes with a cover of the Bad Religion song &quot;We&#x27;re Only Gonna Die&quot;. DeLaughter has been noted as saying in 1990s era interviews that the record label pushed the live album out to capitalize on the popularity of &quot;Bill&quot;, and it is not one of his favorite albums.

===Commercial breakthrough===
After signing a deal with Island Records, which re-released Bill (minus the cover song &quot;Green Tambourine&quot;), the band recorded their first major-label release, &quot;I Am an Elastic Firecracker&quot;. The music video for the song &quot;I Got a Girl&quot; received extended airplay on MTV. A segment of the video was used in a &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; episode, a show known to lampoon popular music videos of the time. Wakeland remained in the band until after the tour for &quot;I Am an Elastic Firecracker&quot; when he chose to leave, and was replaced by Mitch Marine and Cory Lemons. Phil Karnats joined the band on lead guitar soon after Wakeland&#x27;s departure, allowing DeLaughter more freedom to focus on lead vocal duty.

===Later albums===
The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Jesus Hits Like the Atom Bomb&quot;, was a mix of both creativity and experimentalism. DeLaughter has been quoted as saying that the album &quot;is the band at their best&quot;. The album has a fragmented style: from one vignette to another. While the album was not a commercial success, it was critically acclaimed; the &quot;Dallas Observer&quot; later ranked the album&#x27;s third track, &quot;Sonic Bloom&quot;, at number 100 on their &quot;100 Best Texas Songs of All Time&quot; list. Marine toured with the band until he was replaced by Ben Curtis, who drummed on &quot;Jesus Hit Like the Atom Bomb&quot; and their fourth album, the self-titled &quot;Tripping Daisy&quot;. Other releases during this period include &quot;Time Capsule&quot; (a mix of old demos, b-sides, and one new song – the only officially released studio recording to feature drummer Mitch Marine) and &quot;The Tops Off Our Heads&quot; (an impromptu &quot;jam&quot; EP recording that marked the band&#x27;s first post-major label release).

===Death of Wes Berggren and split===
Wes Berggren was found dead of a drug overdose in his apartment on October 27, 1999. The Dallas County Medical Examiner&#x27;s office found traces of cocaine, propoxyphene, and benzodiazepine in his body. With Berggren&#x27;s death, the band cancelled its upcoming tour dates and finished some minor recording sessions for the final album. The self-titled album was released posthumously, with Berggren&#x27;s father Don playing a Fender Rhodes electric piano on the unfinished song &quot;Soothing Jubilee&quot;. The album included a re-recording of &quot;One Through Four&quot;, a song originally featured on &quot;Bill&quot;. Tripping Daisy officially disbanded on December 14, 1999.

After the band disbanded, Tim DeLaughter, Mark Pirro, Bryan Wakeland and Jeff Bouck formed the chamber pop group The Polyphonic Spree. Ben Curtis went on to join brother Brandon Curtis in the progressive space rock trio called The Secret Machines and later, the dream pop trio School of Seven Bells. Curtis died on December 29, 2013, from complications of lymphoma.

===Reunion===
On January 5, 2017, the band&#x27;s official Facebook page teased a possible reunion event. News later confirmed the remaining members would perform at the Homegrown Festival in Dallas on May 13, 2017. On March 9, 2017, they announced four additional Texas dates, making it the first Tripping Daisy tour in nearly twenty years. Christopher Penn announced during Homegrown Fest 8 in Dallas, Texas, on May 13, 2017, that Tripping Daisy would be recording a live album during a concert July 7, 2017, during the NYTEX Summer Concert Series at the NYTEX Sports Centre in North Richland Hills, Texas. The band went idle again until reuniting in 2019 for the 10th Homegrown Festival. Shortly thereafter, the band played a &quot;secret&quot; show at the Dada in Dallas. Dylan Silvers filled in for Curtis during this concert. On August 28, 2022, the band played a surprise show at the Kessler Theater in Dallas.

On June 18, 2024, the &quot;Dallas Observer&quot; announced that Tripping Daisy had officially reformed, and that the band had plans to tour and record a new album. The band then played at The Factory in Deep Ellum, Dallas on June 29, 2024.

<text>Harry Meshel (June 13, 1924 – September 4, 2017) was an American Democratic politician. He served as the president of the Ohio State Senate and chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party. Meshel is noted for his legislative efforts on behalf of the disabled, economic development, and solid and hazardous waste disposal.

== Early years ==
He was born in Youngstown, Ohio on June 13, 1924, to Greek-American parents, Rubena (Markakis) and Angelo Michelakis, whose surname was Americanized to Meshel. Harry graduated from Youngstown&#x27;s East High School in 1941.

Meshel served in the Naval Construction Battalion, or SeeBees, during the Second World War from 1943 to 1946. He was awarded two Bronze Battle Stars for the battle of Leyte Gulf in 1944. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business from Youngstown College in 1949. As an undergraduate, he was Student Council president and vice president of the senior class. Meshel received a master&#x27;s degree in urban land economics from Columbia University in 1950. That same year he became a limited instructor at Youngstown College, while also working in investment, real estate, and insurance.

== Political career ==
In the 1960s, Meshel waged two unsuccessful campaigns for Mahoning County commissioner. He became an administrative assistant to Youngstown Mayor Anthony Flask in 1964, and served as urban renewal director in 1969. Meshel entered electoral politics in 1970, when he ran for a seat in the Ohio State Senate. In 1971, he was elected to the 33rd District of the Ohio Senate, and he was re-elected five times. Meshel became the Senate&#x27;s majority whip and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.

In 1980, Meshel ran for a seat in the United States House of Representatives but lost to Republican incumbent Lyle Williams. That same year, the Democrats lost the majority in the state Senate and Meshel replaced Oliver Ocasek, who had been president of the Ohio Senate, as the party&#x27;s leader in the senate. Meshel served as minority leader from 1981 to 1982.

During his five terms in the Ohio Senate, Meshel was credited with helping to secure almost $150 million in capital improvements for Youngstown State University. In addition, he secured more than $160 million in grants and loans from the Ohio Department of Development for economic development projects. Meshel also worked to create the Northeastern Universities College of Medicine, the College of Osteopathic Medicine at Ohio University, the Wright State University School of Professional psychology, and other programs.

==Boxing==
Meshel helped create the Ohio Boxing Commission, which eventually became the Ohio Athletic Commission.

From 1994, Meshel was also a supervisor for the International Boxing Council.

== Later years ==
In 1986, YSU named its new technology center Meshel Hall in his honor, as he helped secure funding for the project. In 1994, he received the YSU Distinguished Alumni Award.

In 1993, Meshel resigned from the Ohio Senate to become chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, a position he held until 1995. In May 2007, Ohio Governor Ted Strickland named Meshel to a nine-year term as a trustee of Youngstown State University. He also worked as a lobbyist.

He was honored for spearheading the creation of the Youngstown Historical Center of Industry and Labor, which celebrated its 15th anniversary in September 2007.

Meshel has a street, &quot;Meshel Way&quot; named after him in Struthers, Ohio. Meshel also has a hall named after him at NEOMED. Meshel died on September 4, 2017.

==Personal life==
Harry married the former Judy Lazich on July 25, 1948. They had two children, Barry and Melanie. He was a member of the Greek Orthodox Church.

<text>The [[2004 Tour de France]] first ten stages began with the Prologue individual time trial in Liège, Belgium and continued through Stage 9 (Saint-Léonard-de-Noblat to Guéret). The stages were mostly flat and most ended with the main field finishing together. However, Stage 4 was a team time trial with each team riding alone competing against the clock. Also, between Stages 8 and 9 the riders had a rest day where no stage occurred. 188 riders from 21 teams began the Prologue, but 16 dropped out of the race due to varying reasons leaving only 172 riders at the end of Stage 9. Five different riders had the overall lead in the race, including five-time defending champion Lance Armstrong. With a long breakaway in Stage 5, where a group of five riders had a 12-minute advantage over the main competitors, Frenchman Thomas Voeckler of the team took a 9-minute lead over all of the pre-race favorites. He held the lead through the rest of these ten stages and into the next group of stages.

==Jerseys==
The jerseys in the Tour de France are used to signify the leaders in each category during each stage. The overall leader in the general classification is given the &quot;maillot jaune&quot; (yellow jersey). Intermediate sprint points are placed throughout each stage with points given to the first set of riders to pass the point as well as points given to stage winners, with the points leader given the &quot;Maillot Vert&quot; (green jersey). Any classified mountain during stages are given a set of points for the first riders to crest the mountain with the leader in mountain points given the &quot;Maillot à Pois Rouges&quot; (polka-dot jersey). Any rider under the age of 26 on 1 January 2004 were eligible to win the young rider competition and the &quot;Maillot Blanc&quot; (white jersey) as the highest overall young rider in general classification. Additional awards are given for the best placed team and the most combative in each stage which are presented as colored numbers for the back of the riders jerseys. At the end of each stage the leaders/winners of each category for the day are awarded their jerseys/numbers and wear them for the next stage.

==Prologue==
3 July 2004 — Liège, (ITT)

The short time trial covered of the streets of Liège. The course was almost completely flat, with just a 5-metre peak at 4.3 km completed. The course was raced in cool, cloudy conditions and despite occasional light rain proved to be very fast, but it caused the fall of several riders.

The winner was Swiss Tour-debutant Fabian Cancellara who completed the course in 6&#x27;51&quot; at an average speed of 53.560 km/h, the third fastest in the race&#x27;s history. Cancellara was in his second year with the Fassa Bortolo and was junior and U23 world time trial champion in 1999 and 2000 respectively. Lance Armstrong finished second, just seconds behind Cancellara&#x27;s time, and impressively ahead of most of his major competitors in the general classification, and all the other expected challengers finished within 20&quot; of Cancellara, who after the prologue declared that he believed himself to be the world&#x27;s best rider in such short distances. Cancellara&#x27;s performance put him at the top of both the general classification and the race for sprinters points, which would give him both the yellow, white and green jerseys. Since one does not wear two jerseys, however, the green jersey is &quot;loaned&quot; to the racer in second place in that competition, which, in this case, had the unusual result of putting Lance Armstrong in green.

Prologue results and general Classification
==Stage 1==
4 July 2004 — Liège to Charleroi, 

The stage covered from Liège to Charleroi, heading south from Liège before looping back and heading west to the finish. The first third of the route included three cat-4 climbs and there were a cat-3 and a cat-4 climb around the middle of the course. For the Tour the course was almost flat and a mass sprint was expected at the finish. The weather was cool and cloudy at the start, later there was rain.

The race had a lively start with a breakaway barely 15 minutes from the start. With various contributors the small group led by less than 20 seconds over the first two climbs. Their lead extended to 1&#x27;10&quot; on the third climb and after the first hour of racing the five-strong group was almost 2&#x27;30&quot; clear. The main sprinter&#x27;s teams in the peloton were slow to organise as a number of crashes and other problems delayed their team leaders. The lead peaked at around 3&#x27;45&quot; but after 115 km in the lead the breakaways were reeled in by the main group. The sprint teams held the peloton together until the third intermediate sprint at Eghezee. An attack by Jakob Piil and Marc Wauters raced away and they stretched their advantage to over 1&#x27;50&quot;. But with around 25 km to go riders from Lotto, Fassa Bortolo and other sprinter&#x27;s teams took to the front of the peloton. The lead of Wauters and Piil was slowly reduced until they were caught with less than 2 km to the finish. In a mass sprint veteran Jaan Kirsipuu broke early and held off Robbie McEwen to win by the smallest of margins. It was his fourth career Tour win. After the time bonuses from intermediate sprints were counted Cancellara remained in yellow, four seconds clear of Hushovd and ten ahead of Armstrong.

==Stage 2==
5 July 2004 — Charleroi to Namur, 

The stage was 197 km. Namur, the Walloon capital, is to the east of Charleroi and only 30 km away. The route of the race described a rough square to the west, with both cities in the top east corner. Again the route was mostly flat, marked by only two cat-4 climbs, so a mass sprint finish was almost certain. The race started in clouds but ended in sunshine.

The race began with a number of early attacks and after the first climb at 7 km a group of six riders slipped away. Their lead grew quickly and by 40 km raced they were over four minutes clear and were working hard together. The lead peaked at 5&#x27;, but the sprinter teams Quick-Step and Crédit Agricole finally began to push the pace in the peloton. The lead group held on, their time falling slowly, but as other teams took a turn their advantage fell away and they were caught with 23 km to go. Despite the remaining distance the peloton was held together by Quickstep and later Fassa Bortolo. The mass sprint ended in a clear victory for Robbie McEwen, second – despite breaking his bike at 20 km to go – was Thor Hushovd. With the 12&quot; time bonus for his position the Norwegian National Champion took the &quot;maillot jaune&quot;, the first Norwegian to ever wear it. There were a number of crashes during the race and Gian Matteo Fagnini broke his collarbone and was forced to withdraw.

==Stage 3==
6 July 2004 — Waterloo to Wasquehal, 

This was another fairly flat stage, of 210 km, tending south before turning west and leading the Tour out of Belgium and into France. The two categorized climbs, a cat-3 and a cat-4, included the well-known Muur of Geraardsbergen of the Tour of Flanders. Part of the stage also included the notorious &quot;pavé&quot; of the Paris–Roubaix Classic for the first time on the Tour since 1983. The two stretches of narrow cobbled streets totaling just 4 km, but were certainly the most &#x27;ominous&#x27; feature of the course. The weather was warm and dry.

After another retirement, that of Frédéric Bessy (Cofidis), 185 riders started. As on the previous two days there was a very early attack, this time by Jens Voigt and Bram de Groot. Again as on the first two stages, the escapers quickly stretched their advantage, leading by 4&#x27;30&quot; at the 25 km mark. The lead rose to 6&#x27;10&quot; just after the first sprint (Meerbeke at 42 km). After the Muur de Geraardsbergen the peloton, led by Crédit Agricole, started to push the pace but the leaders held out and even increased their lead. As the &quot;pavé&quot; at Erre approached (146 km) and the race leaders held a 5&#x27;45&quot; advantage the &#x27;pushing&#x27; for the head of the peloton began. This led to a nasty crash involving Iban Mayo, considered one of Armstrong&#x27;s major competitors in this Tour, 2 km before the &quot;pavé&quot;. Armstrong used this opportunity to have his team launch an attack, and the peloton broke into two large groups. The push at Erre slashed at the lead of Voight and De Groot, it also put Armstrong, Ullrich, Zabel and ninety or so others in a group ahead of the main peloton and the yellow jersey. With 50 km to go the leading pair had 1&#x27; advantage over the nearest chasers, but almost 3&#x27; over the main pack. US Postal pushed hard to maximise their advantage and finally, at 163 km raced, Voight and De Groot were caught, the main group still lagging 1&#x27;50&quot; behind. The leading group rattled over the second section of &quot;pavé&quot; with trouble and took their lead over the yellow jersey to 2&#x27;30&quot;. There were a series of attacks off the front of the leading group but there were enough sprinter&#x27;s teams to close them down. In the final race for the line McEwen kicked early but Jean-Patrick Nazon and Erik Zabel slipped by to take first and second. The second group, with Mayo and Thor Hushovd, who wore the yellow jersey coming into the stage, came in 3&#x27;53&quot; behind – enough back to end Mayo&#x27;s hopes of a victory. With the time bonuses McEwen took over the yellow and green jerseys, the yellow for the first time in his career.

==Stage 4==
7 July 2004 — Cambrai to Arras, (TTT)

This 64.5 km stage was the team time trial, an event with some vociferous critics. This year, new rules were introduced for this stage to reduce the impact on the lighter-weight climbing teams. Under the new rules, the second place team would not receive a time penalty more than 20 seconds slower than the first place team for the purposes of the general classification. The third place team would not receive more than 30 seconds loss to that of the first, the fourth place 40 seconds, and so on to a maximum time deficit of three minutes. The course for the time trial had numerous gentle slopes, none of which merited a category. The day started dry but heavy rain quickly picked up.

As expected, despite a slow start (5th after first time check), US Postal won the stage – putting Armstrong in yellow, filling six of the top seven overall places with his colleagues, and, remarkably, giving the top three places in the general classification to Americans (Armstrong, George Hincaple, and Floyd Landis). The results were good news for Armstrong, giving him a 36-second lead on Tyler Hamilton, a 55-second lead on Jan Ullrich, and, of course, giving him a yellow jersey, albeit one he was not expected to try to defend in the short term. Their only stress was dropping Benjamin Noval, who was shaken up from a crash yesterday – the same one that had brought down Mayo. Noval finished within the minimum time, however, and the Postal squad notably broke off their press interviews to congratulate him at the finish line.

Hamilton&#x27;s Phonak team also did extremely well, especially considering that by the time they reached the finish line mechanical problems had whittled them down to five riders – the minimum number to receive a time in the team time trial (although all of their riders eventually did finish). Phonak was also hampered by the unusual decision to have Hamilton slow down and wait for Santos González when he had some mechanical trouble. Despite this, they finished second, ahead of Illes Balears in third, and Ullrich&#x27;s T-Mobile team in fourth.

Fasso Bortolo had a tough day, getting penalized two minutes for infractions – one for pacing themselves off of the team cars, and another for pushing each other for speed, adding another insult to what was shaping up to be a disappointing Tour for Alessandro Petacchi.

==Stage 5==
8 July 2004 — Amiens to Chartres, 

The bad storms from stage four continued, with fierce crosswinds, adding the potential for drama to a stage that was otherwise basically a straight, flat ride to Chartres. An early break at 12 km got 15&#x27; ahead, when a crash with around 90 km to go slowed the peloton as they let the fallen riders catch up. That let the breakaway get to 17&#x27;30&quot; ahead, and it was clear that they weren&#x27;t going to be caught. Another crash at 30 km to go took out Robbie McEwen, adding to an already lousy day for the Australian, who was losing a lot of ground to Stuart O&#x27;Grady, who was racking up points for the green jersey. The breakaway crossed the line well ahead of the peloton following a brutal series of attacks among the five riders, including Thomas Voeckler, who began the stage three minutes behind Armstrong, and who was thus clearly going to end up in the yellow jersey.

The peloton eventually closed the gap to 12&#x27;36&quot;. Voeckler, who came in fourth, moved from 59th to 1st in the general classification, taking the yellow jersey from Armstrong with a 9&#x27;35&quot; lead over Armstrong, and a 3 min 13 s lead over second place Stuart O&#x27;Grady, though this was not a particularly bad blow for Armstrong, since Voeckler, despite being the French National Champion, would not prove to be a climber until much later in his career. McEwen held onto the green jersey, but Stuart O&#x27;Grady managed an impressive 53 sprinters points, more than doubling his total to 81, and putting him in 6th place for the green.

Bradley McGee, who wore the yellow jersey for the first three days of the 2003 Tour de France, had a tough day, having never quite recovered from a crash on Stage 1. He got dropped off the back of the peloton and eventually dropped out of the tour.

==Stage 6==
9 July 2004 — Bonneval to Angers, 

With no hills at all, this was, from the start, clearly going to be a day for the sprinters. The day began with the announcement that both Alessandro Petacchi and Mario Cipollini had dropped out of the race, Petacchi due to injury on Stage 5, Cipollini due to an injury on Stage 3 that had reopened. Neither had won any stages.

Near the start of the stage, a number of riders crashed, including Lance Armstrong; however, all involved in this crash were able to rejoin the peloton. An early break got caught late, with the last rider being pulled back to the peloton with 2 km to go. A massive pileup at the 1 km mark, however, split the peloton, leaving only a handful of riders with any chance of winning. Young Belgian Tom Boonen took it clearly, with Stuart O&#x27;Grady in second. Robbie McEwen was hurt in the crash and limped in towards the finish, getting no sprinters points today. This meant that O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s second-place finish, with its associated 30 points, was enough to put him in green. The overall standings remained unchanged, save for O&#x27;Grady closing 12 seconds on Voeckler from his time bonus.

==Stage 7==
10 July 2004 — Châteaubriant to Saint-Brieuc, 

On the last day for the sprinters before the mountains get started, the major battle was set to be between McEwen and O&#x27;Grady for the green jersey, and it didn&#x27;t disappoint. The first hour or so of racing consisted of a series of failed breaks as the peloton rocketed along at an average speed of 50 km/h. After about an hour, a two-man break consisting of Erik Dekker, who had already won four Tour stages in previous years, and Thierry Marichal shot off and held on for most of the race. The two riders came to a sort of a compromise, with Marichal taking first in the sprint checkpoints, and Dekker taking first in both of the checkpoints for the King of the Mountains competition. Meanwhile, back in the peloton, Bobby Julich&#x27;s CSC team attacked with 50 km to go, splitting the peloton. The main contenders all managed to hold on in the front group, though, and eventually the peloton would reconvene.

The pair was finally brought in by the CSC-led chase around 31 km from the finish, and only a few kilometers later CSC led another attack when Jacob Piil broke off the front, joined by three other riders. With 8.5 km to go, they were brought in only to have another break of seven take off. That one survived to the end, but with 2 km to go three riders took off from that, and managed to hold it to the end, with the stage win going to Italian Filippo Pozzato. Back in the peloton, though, O&#x27;Grady managed to sneak in ahead of McEwen, making up for the four points McEwen took on him in the intermediate sprints, and holding onto the green jersey for another day, this time by a razor-thin one point. The overall standings remained unchanged among the major competitors.

==Stage 8==
11 July 2004 — Lamballe to Quimper, 

Today was a shorter stage, only 168 km, with more climbs than the past few days – three category four climbs and a category three. After yesterday&#x27;s constant attacks, though, the pack took it slower and easier. A three-man break took off at 16 km, containing, predictably, Jacob Piil, as well as Matteo Tosatto and Ronny Scholz. Karsten Kroon joined them, but early on got a flat tire and was swallowed by the peloton.

The breakaway was caught with 9 km to go, and the peloton remained solid through to the finish. As with many of the stages this year, there was a crash towards the end, this time at the back of the peloton, caused by a dog running across the road. It didn&#x27;t slow things down much, though, and the peloton continued to the line, Thor Hushovd taking the sprint. Robbie McEwen took fourth, ahead of O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s eighth, and claimed the green jersey. The general classification remained unchanged as the riders head into the first of two rest days before starting through the mountains in Stage 9.

==Stage 9==
13 July 2004 — Saint-Léonard-de-Noblat to Guéret, 

This 160.5 km stage was another with more hills after a two-day rest, although only two were categorized and a sprinters&#x27; finish was expected. This was the last stage before some big climbs so the balance was between &#x27;resting&#x27; for the following day and a last chance for sprinters. The weather was, at last, warm with temperatures up to 25 °C.

The race began with a few early escape attempts, with groups of from one and eight riders breaking and being caught within the first 20 km. The attacks continued but the peloton maintained a high pace with US Postal at the front. Jaan Kirsipuu was dropped from the peloton and abandoned the race. At about 38 km raced Iñigo Landaluze managed to get away, he was chased and caught by Filippo Simeoni and the duo pulled out their lead. A number of riders attempted to join them but none made it across the gap, although Karsten Kroon spent a long time alone between the two groups before giving up the solo chase on the
second climb, the Cote d&#x27;Aubusson.

With 100 km to the finish the two leaders were almost 2 min 30 s clear and the peloton slowed a little. The leaders&#x27; advantage rapidly increased, rising by over four minutes in the next 25 km and peaked at 10 min 05 s when the peloton reached the second climb. After the climb the riders of Crédit Agricole, Lotto–Domo and Quickstep came to the front of the peloton and raised the pace.

The lead fell slowly, with 44 km to go they were still 6 min 10 s ahead. With 25 km to the finish they still had a little under four minutes in hand, with 15 km just two minutes, 10 km 1 min 25 s, 5 km just 40 seconds. With just the final kilometre to race Landaluze and Simeoni were swept up, they had started playing tactical games for the final lead out and the sprinters just blew past them. In the sprint for the line Robbie McEwen just edged out Thor Hushovd and Stuart O&#x27;Grady. McEwen now had an 18-point lead in the green jersey clash.

<text>Charles Spencer Crane (January 4, 1869 – September 13, 1958) was a businessman and politician in Hawaii.

==Life==
Crane was born in Honolulu on January 4, 1869, the son of a whaler captain Ezra Dean Crane and Emma Ann Still Crane. He started working at the Honolulu telephone company. In February 1897 he worked in the business department of the Hawaiian Gazette Company, became assistant manager of the Gazette in 1900, and in November 1905 became manager of the publishing company.
From 1908 to 1919 he published a Hawaiian language newspaper called &quot;Ka Nupepa Kuokoa&quot;.
Crane married Emma Spurrell Thompson on October 16, 1922, at Hilo.
He eventually became executive vice president of what would become the &quot;Honolulu Advertiser&quot;.

After &quot;Advertiser&quot; owner Lorrin A. Thurston died, his son Lorrin Potter Thurston took over in October 1931, and Crane resigned from the newspaper to go into politics. He was elected to the board of supervisors for the City and County of Honolulu.
He was appointed Mayor of Honolulu July 15, 1938 upon the death of George F. Wright, and served until January 2, 1941.
He was elected to the Territory of Hawaii senate 3rd district in 1943 and 1945.
He retired for a while to California, and then returned to live with his son Ezra Crane who was editor of the &quot;Maui News&quot;.
He died on Maui September 13, 1958.

Crane is memorialized in Honolulu by Crane Playground in the Kaimukī section of Honolulu at .

<text>The Istanbul Film Festival () is the first and oldest international film festival in Turkey, organised by the Istanbul Foundation for Culture and Arts. It is held every year in April in movie theaters in Istanbul, Turkey. As mentioned in its regulations, the festival aims to encourage the development of cinema in Turkey and to promote films of quality in the Turkish cinema market.

The 40th edition of the festival was held from April 1 to June 29, 2021, in hybrid format.

==History==
The Istanbul International Film Festival was first organized in 1982, within the frame of the International Istanbul Festival as a &quot;Film Week&quot; consisting of six films. The theme of the films participating in the Festival was limited to &quot;Arts and Cinema&quot;, to keep the event within the context of the International Istanbul Festival. In 1983 the event was realized under the title of &quot;Istanbul Filmdays&quot;, taking place throughout the Festival within a span of a month.

Beginning from 1984, the event gained an identity as a separate activity; it was shifted to the month of April. In 1985, two competitive sections, one being national and the other international, were included in the festival program. From 1987 on, &quot;Cinema Honorary Awards&quot; began to be presented.

In the following years, The Istanbul International Filmdays firmly established its position and took its place among the major film festivals of the world with the large number of films shown and the quality and versatility of its program.

At the beginning of 1989 the event was recognized as &quot;a competitive specialized festival&quot; by International Federation of Film Producers Associations (FIAPF) and was accredited. Parallel to this development, &quot;Istanbul Filmdays&quot; was renamed as &quot;Istanbul International Film Festival&quot;.

Beginning from 1996, &quot;Lifetime Achievement Awards&quot; along with &quot;Cinema Honorary Awards&quot; began to be presented to international cineastes, actors and actresses. 
In 2006, celebrating its 25th year, the festival created a meeting platform for Turkish and European film professionals under the title &quot;Meetings on the Bridge&quot;, aiming to bring European film institutions with Turkish directors and producers to discuss funding possibilities.
Also in 2006, Azize Tan, the then assistant director of the festival replaced Hülya Uçansu as director.

In 2007, the Council of Europe, in collaboration with Eurimages, started to present the Film Award of the Council of Europe (FACE) to a film selected from the entries in the Human Rights and Cinema section of the festival. The Council of Europe and later Eurimages support for this award was discontinued in 2020.

With its 28th edition in 2009, the festival began to give its Golden Tulip Award also as a result of its National Competition.

The festival dropped the &quot;international&quot; from its title in 2011. 
Azize Tan was replaced by the assistant director of the festival, Kerem Ayan, in 2015. In 2016, the festival changed the theme of the international competition to &quot;new perspectives in cinema.&quot;

Since the beginning of the Festival, a total of 2,065,000 spectators have attended the screenings of 2,330 films from 72 different countries (2005 figures). The festival boasted an audience of 170,000 in 2007, breaking its own record.

==Censorship==

In 1988, government inspectors forced the withdrawal of 5 of 160 films that are to be screened at the festival. Jean-Jacques Beineix&#x27;s &quot;Betty Blue&quot; and &quot;Vedreba (The Plea)&quot; by Tengiz Abuladze were among these five works. &quot;Vedreba&quot; was being blocked on the grounds that it was &quot;anti-Islamic&quot; and cuts from the other four films were demanded because of erotic scenes.

Upon the notification by the censorship board that certain films on the program were to be banned, the then president of the Golden Tulip Jury, Elia Kazan, organised a protest march with the participation of Turkish filmmakers. The Turkish Ministry of Culture subsequently issued a decree holding all international film festivals exempt from censorship.

==Program==

The selection and programming of the festival films is conducted by the selection committee and the advisory board. The program consists of an international competition open only to feature and animated films on art and artists or literary adaptations, a national competition, non-competitive, informative sections on specific themes which can include documentaries, shorts and feature films.

<doc id="824846" wikidata="Q160108" url="?curid=824846" title="Eyelash">
<text>An eyelash (also called lash) (Neo-Latin: &quot;cilium&quot;, plural &quot;cilia&quot;) is one of the hairs that grows at the edges of the top and bottom eyelids, spanning outwards and away from the eyes. The lashes grow in up to six layers on each of the upper and lower eyelids. Eyelashes serve to protect the eye from debris, dust, and small particles, and are highly sensitive to touch, thus providing a warning that an object (such as an insect or lint) is near the eye, which then reflexively closes or flutters to rid the area of the object. The eyelid margin from which lashes grow is among the most sensitive parts of the human body, with many nerve endings enveloping the roots of the lashes, giving it sensitivity to very light tactile input even at the tips of the lashes, enabling it to trigger the blink reflex when touched. Eyelashes are also an important component of physical attractiveness, with long prominent lashes giving the illusion of large, gazing eyes, and drawing attention to the eyes.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;eyelash&quot; is a compound consisting of the words &quot;eye&quot;, referring to the eye which the lashes surround and protect; and &quot;lash&quot;, referring to the braided cord of a whip or to the act of stroking with a whip. This is in reference to both the individual lashes resembling whips, and the action of blinking the eyes causing the lashes to move in a stroking or whipping motion.

== Function ==
In humans, the eyelashes serve four main functions:

# Protect the eye from dust and debris by catching them before they can enter the eye
# Trigger the blink reflex in the case of a foreign body approaching the eye and touching the lashes
# Regulate or reduce evaporation of the tear film on the cornea
# Protect the conjunctivae from excessive light and ultraviolet radiation, by forming a filamentous curtain-like structure through their arrangement in multiple imperfect rows

==Structure==
===Development===
The eyelashes of the human embryo develop from the ectoderm between the 22nd and 26th week of pregnancy. Eyelashes take about seven to eight weeks to grow back if pulled out, but constant pulling may lead to permanent damage. Their color may differ from that of the hair, although they tend to be dark on someone with dark hair and lighter on someone with light hair. Eyelash hair is not androgenic and is therefore not affected by puberty. Lash follicles do not have an arrector pili muscle associated with them, making the lashes static.

=== Length ===
Human eyelash length is the subject of extensive studies, both for the effect on their functional efficacy, and for their effect on human physical attractiveness. This is also because lashes do not continually grow to long lengths like scalp hair, and the individual variability in their length is almost solely determined by genetics.

While there is considerable variation in the length of lashes between individuals (3 mm to 10 mm for upper lashes), lashes do not vary in length by sex or ethnicity, with the upper lashes of humans typically 7 to 8 mm in length regardless of sex, and generally do not exceed 10 mm in length. Thus, the lashes of humans are considered to be remarkably long when they are 10 mm or greater in length. Lower lashes average between 5 and 6 mm in length. In trichomegaly, the lashes may grow exceptionally long (occasionally 15 mm for the upper lashes). The longest lashes usually grow from the centre of the eyelid. Human eyelash length, thickness, and darkness decrease significantly with age, hence long and thick lashes are sometimes seen as a mark of fertility and youthfulness.

Eyelash length is closely linked to the width of the eye, with the lashes typically growing to one-third the width of the eye as an evolutionary adaptation to reduce tear film evaporation and dust deposition. Lashes longer or shorter than one-third the width of the eye have been shown to have reduced efficacy in serving their function. The typical width of the human eye is 24.2 mm, resulting in the average human eyelash length of 7 to 8 mm. This evolutionary trait is perhaps why lashes in humans rarely grow beyond 10 mm in length. However, longer lashes offer more protection against ultraviolet radiation than their shorter counterparts.

=== Thickness ===

Lashes grow thick at the roots, and have tapered ends. People of Asian ethnicities have significantly thicker lashes, with an average lash diameter of 71.7 μm, than people of Caucasian ethnicities, with have an average lash diameter of 61.0 μm. However, the number of lashes on the eyelids is fewer in Asians, who typically have 150 lash hairs on the upper lids, than in Caucasians, who typically have 170 lash hairs on the upper lid.

=== Curvature ===
Eyelashes grow outwards from both upper and lower eyelids, with varying degrees of curl. People of Caucasian ethnicities have lashes that are more curled than those of Asian ethnicities. However, the degree of curling varies significantly even within a population or ethnicity, where people of Asian ethnicities can also exhibit naturally highly curled lashes.

=== Density ===
The number of individual lashes on the upper eyelid is typically 90 to 160, and on the lower eyelid 75 to 80. The number of follicles and hence lashes cannot be increased after birth because all follicles develop during embryogenesis.

===Glands===
The follicles of eyelashes are associated with a number of glands known as the glands of Zeis and the glands of Moll.

==Clinical significance==

There are a number of diseases or disorders involving the eyelashes:
*Madarosis is the loss of eyelashes.
*Blepharitis is the irritation of the lid margin, where eyelashes join the eyelid. The eyelids are red and itching, the skin often becomes flaky, and the eyelashes may fall out.
*Distichiasis is the abnormal growth of lashes from certain areas of the eyelid.
*Trichiasis refers to ingrown eyelashes.
*Eyelashes may become infested with parasitic crab louse.
*An external hordeolum, or stye, is a purulent inflammation of infected eyelash follicles and surrounding sebaceous (Gland of Zeis) and apocrine (Moll&#x27;s gland) glands of the lid margin.
*Trichotillomania is a disorder that urges the sufferer to pull out scalp hair, eyelashes, etc.
*&quot;Demodex folliculorum&quot; (or the demodicid) is a small mite that lives harmlessly in eyelash and other hair follicles, and about 20% of people have these mites living on them. Occasionally they may cause blepharitis.
*People with vernal keratoconjunctivitis have longer eyelashes, with the increased growth likely a result of the occular inflammation accompanying the condition.
*Trichomegaly is the condition of abnormally long and/or lush lashes (the objective criteria being lashes of 12 mm or greater in length on the upper eyelids).

Eyelash transplant surgeries may help to reconstruct lost or damaged lashes. The procedure may also be employed to increase the number of lash follicles on the eyelid to enhance the prominence and fullness of the lashes. The transplanted hairs usually do not have the tapered structure of real lashes, and continue to grow at the same rate as hairs from the area the follicle was extracted from. As such, they require maintenance by means of trimming.

==Society and culture==
Prominent, luscious eyelashes have long been considered a sign of beauty in many cultures, almost universally, and as such are highly coveted, particularly by women. Having longer and thicker lashes can also have a positive psychological effect on women. Despite not varying by sex and not being a secondary sex characteristic, long, prominent lashes are frequently considered a feminine trait, with studies showing that women possessing longer lashes are perceived as healthier and more feminine. Nevertheless, long lashes are regarded as an attractive facial feature in both males and females. On the other hand, Hadza women are known to trim their own eyelashes. Nonetheless, an average length eyelash is considered the most attractive across Asian, Indian, Black and White faces.

Ancient Romans considered long eyelashes a component of aesthetically ideal eyes. Pliny the Elder wrote that eyelashes fell out from sexual excess, so women desired long lashes as a symbol of chastity. This may have had medical basis as a symptom of syphilis is often alopecia of the lashes, suggesting that individuals with short or sparse lashes were sexually promiscuous.

The traditional Meitei writing system has two letters (symbols), related to eyelashes. The letter &quot;ꯄ&quot; (&quot;Paa&quot;) symbolises the human eyelash, and its letter name &quot;Paa&quot; itself means &quot;eyelash&quot; in Meitei language. It has an additional form of letter, known as &quot;Pa Lonsum&quot; (&quot;ꯞ&quot;).
=== Nonverbal communication ===
The lashes and lids play a role in eye contact and nonverbal communication. Voluntarily blinking slowly or a few times in succession quickly is a feminine flirtatious behaviour commonly referred to as to &quot;bat an eyelash&quot;, &quot;bat/batting eyelashes&quot;, or &quot;flutter/fluttering eyelashes&quot;.

===Cosmetics===

Because long eyelashes are aesthetically pleasing and seen as a desirable trait that adds to physical attractiveness, some people seek to enhance their eyelash length artificially, by means of eyelash extensions, false lashes attached to the eyelid, cosmetics, or growth products. Additionally, eyelashes which are curled are also more prominent, being able to better display their length especially when viewed from the front. The enhanced appearance of curled eyelashes can be cosmetically achieved by use of eyelash curlers, or eyelash perms. However, these methods do not physically lengthen the lashes.
Kohl, a black putty (usually antimony sulfide or lead sulfide), has been worn as far back as the Bronze Age to darken the edge of the eyelid (just at the bottom of the eyelashes). In Ancient Egypt, it was used as well by the wealthy and the royal to beautify their eyes. Modern eye makeup includes mascara, eyeliner, eye putty, and eye shadow to emphasize the eyes. The twentieth century saw the beginning of convincing false eyelashes, popular in the 1960s.

Permanent eyelash tints and eyelash extensions have also become popular procedures, even in fairly basic salons. It is also possible to get eyelash transplants, which are similar in nature to hair transplantation often done on the head. Since the hair is transplanted from the hair on the head, the new eyelashes will continue to grow like head hair and will need to be trimmed regularly.

Latisse was introduced in the first quarter of 2009 by Allergan as the first drug to receive FDA approval for eyelash growth. Latisse is a solution of bimatoprost, a prostaglandin analog and the active component of the glaucoma medication Lumigan. According to Allergan, noticeable eyelash growth occurs within 16 weeks. Growth is reported to occur primarily on the upper eyelashes, with as much as a 25% increase in length. In addition, the past decade has seen the rapid increase in the development of eyelash conditioners. These conditioners are designed to increase the health and length of lashes. Many utilize seed extract, minerals, and other chemicals to achieve these results.

Cosmetic companies have recently relied on scientific research of prostaglandins and the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathways to develop eyelash products. Although bimatoprost is effective in promoting increased growth of healthy eyelashes and adnexal hairs, its effectiveness in patients with eyelash alopecia areata is debatable. Some cosmetic brands have begun using peptides in their formulation rather than prostaglandins because of regulatory rules in places like Canada and California.

==In other animals==

Lashes, being hair, are found in mammals. Camels&#x27; lashes are remarkably long and thick. Horses and cows feature eyelashes as well. Inherited eyelash problems are common in some breeds of dogs as well as horses.

Eyelashes are an uncommon but not unknown feature in birds. Hornbills have prominent eyelashes (vestigial feathers with no barbs), as do ostriches. Amongst the reptiles, only Eyelash vipers show a set of modified scales over the eyes which look much like eyelashes.

<doc id="824857" wikidata="Q2339911" url="?curid=824857" title="USS Experiment (1799)">
<text>USS &quot;Experiment&quot; was a schooner in the United States Navy during the Quasi-War with France.

&quot;Experiment&quot; was built in 1799 at Baltimore, Maryland; and first put to sea late in November 1799, Lieutenant William Maley in command. The ship was acuired by the Navy due to a need for small fast frigates. It was from a type of ship known as a Baltimore Clipper. 

&quot;Experiment&quot; joined the squadron commanded by Captain Silas Talbot on the Santo Domingo station, and for seven months, cruised against French privateers in the Caribbean, taking a number of valuable prizes. Action of 1 January 1800:On 1 January 1800, while becalmed in the Bight of Leogane with a convoy of four merchantmen, they were attacked by 11 armed pirate barges, flying French flags, manned by about four or five hundred buccaneers. In the seven hours of fighting that followed, the pirates boarded one of the merchantmen, killing her captain, and towed off two other ships of the convoy after their crews had abandoned them. But &quot;Experiment&quot; sank two of the attacking craft, and killed and wounded many of the pirates, suffering only one man wounded. 

On 12 January captured schooner &quot;Anne&#x27; (or Anna). She was sent to Philadelphia where the ship was released by the Court in July. On 2 February she captured a sloop.

<text>Voltamp was an early American manufacturer of toy trains based in Baltimore, Maryland. Voltamp released its first toy train product in 1903.

==Overview==
Founded by Manes Fuld (1863–1929), the son of a Baltimore stove dealer, Voltamp&#x27;s trains utilized the same 2-inch gauge metal track as Carlisle &amp; Finch, the inventor of the electric toy train. It is significant for its 1907 release of the first electric toy train that operated on household alternating current; earlier electric trains had used battery power.

Although Voltamp outlasted Carlisle &amp; Finch, its primary competitor, both companies were eclipsed in the marketplace by the Ives Manufacturing Company and Lionel Corporation, and Voltamp exited the market in 1922, selling its line to Boucher.

<text>419eater.com is a scam baiting website which focuses on advance-fee fraud. The name 419 comes from &quot;419 fraud&quot;, another name for advance fee fraud, and itself derived from the relevant section of the Nigerian criminal code. The website founder, Michael Berry, goes by the alias Shiver Metimbers. As of 2013, the 419 Eater forum had over 55,000 registered accounts. According to one member, &quot;Every minute the scammer I&#x27;m communicating with is spending on me is a minute he is not scamming a real potential victim.&quot;

==Concept==

The website chronicles various reverse scams, known as &quot;baits,&quot; with e-mail exchanges between the baiters and the scammers, and commentary by the participants. The site hosts photographs of individuals reported to be scammers in humorous poses, or holding signs such as &quot;I recommend 419eater&quot;. These photographs, according to the members who post them, were in most cases obtained during the process of a bait: the baiter, posing as an actual victim, will request the photos from the scammer, who will comply in the belief that the &quot;victim&quot; is about to fall for the scam and send money.

In some cases, the scambaiter claims to have had the scammers send &quot;them&quot; money with a ploy similar to the original flim flam. This is known informally as cash baiting. According to Berry as documented in some of his successful cash baits, the proceeds of such reverse scams were given to a local charity. Now however, cash-baiting is frowned upon and is against 419eater.com rules, which are rigorously enforced.

The website also includes a message forum and a bulletin board where scambaiters can post messages to communicate with each other. New scambaiters can request to be assigned a &quot;mentor&quot; to assist them in learning how to bait.

The 419eater community previously engaged in the activity of identifying and removing fake banks and other websites created by the scammers from the Internet, as well as shutting down bank accounts used by scammers in the process of their illegal scamming activities. It did this in cooperation with Artists Against 419, which hosts a large, publicly accessible database of fake banks and similar fraudulent websites. In 2020, Artists Against 419 severed its ties with 419eater.com and the Fake Site forum is now locked.

==Notable events in the timeline of the site==

Berry was a featured guest on BBC Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;The Jeremy Vine Show&quot; on November 1, 2006. Berry has also collected some of the scambaits shown on the website, in a book &quot;Greetings in Jesus&#x27; Name!: The Scambaiter Letters&quot;. In early 2008, Berry retired from active involvement in 419eater.com to concentrate on work and other projects, handing control over to one of the site&#x27;s long-running system administrators.

Beginning September 6, 2007, the 419eater.com website—among other &quot;scam warning&quot; websites—was subjected to a massive botnet DDoS attack which rendered the site unreachable. However, by September 18, 2007, the site and forums were both back online.

419eater and its operatives were profiled on the September 12, 2008 episode of Public Radio International&#x27;s &quot;This American Life&quot;, specifically one particular bait that ran for 100 days starting in April 2008 and involved sending a scammer named Adamu from Lagos, Nigeria to Abéché, Chad, a dangerous and politically unstable region.

419eater.com was quoted as saying &quot;When the scammer sends you a fake passport that looks like it was made by a blind hamster with a piece of charcoal in ten seconds, you praise it and say it really helps you to build trust&quot;. Several baiters &quot;talked a scammer into traveling from Port Harcourt, Nigeria to Darfur to pick up a nonexistent $500,000. The 3,000-mile roundtrip got the scammer stranded for two weeks before he managed to make it home&quot;. Although the work of 419eater.com baiters does put scammers in danger, &quot;the general consensus...was that they feel even the most dangerous of safaris is payback for all the scammers do. &#x27;The scammer makes the decision to put themselves in harm&#x27;s way; if something happens to them, so be it. Most of them would have no problem with you dying if it meant that they would make a dollar&#x27;&quot;. Another baiter was quoted as saying &quot;Whether he is wandering through the desert hundreds of miles from home, or making yet another fruitless trip to the Moneygram office, that&#x27;s all time he is not behind a computer scamming someone&#x27;s elderly parents.&quot;

In January 2014, members of 419eater.com appeared in two segments of the Channel 4 series &quot;Secrets of the Scammers&quot;. In the first segment, scambaiters persuaded a scammer to travel from London to a remote location in Cornwall by train and taxi, to meet a victim (played by a baiter) and collect payment for a gold deal. In the second segment, a female scammer met with two scambaiters posing as victims in Trafalgar Square, to pass them a fake check. This scammer was subsequently questioned by the police.

In November 2014, members of 419eater.com appeared in a segment of the CBC Television series &quot;Dot.Con&quot;. During the segment, a scambaiter persuaded a scammer to travel from Paris to a remote location in Cornwall by air and taxi, to meet a victim (played by a baiter) and collect payment for a gold deal. Following this, two scammers travelled from London and met with a scambaiter posing as a victim in Plymouth to collect upfront payment for delivery of a trunk box of cash.

<text>The Association for the Advancement of Civil Rights (AACR) was a political party in Gibraltar.

==History==
The AACR was established in 1942 by Joshua Hassan and Albert Risso, and sought to protect the interests of families evacuated during World War II. At the time, most of the Gibraltar population had been evacuated and only a small number of Gibraltarians remained on The Rock. Consequently, the colony was crowded with British soldiers, sailors and airmen. They received wide support from the Governor, General Mason-MacFarlane (later a Labour MP in the United Kingdom), who allowed them to fulfil the representative role that the Committee of the Exchange and the Commercial Library used to fill. The Governor also left the AACR with the responsibility of managing the leave scheme that allowed the Gibraltarians who remained on the Rock to visit their families in Britain. They also took a leading role in the repatriation of the Gibraltarian evacuees.

In 1945 the AACR became a political party, advocating improved pay and working conditions and the introduction of a democratic constitution. In August 1945, the first City Council elections since the war were held and the AACR won all the elected seats in the Council, with Hassan became its chairman. In the first elections to the new legislature in 1950, it won three of the five seats and was able to form a government. The party won successive elections in 1953 and 1956. The 1959 elections saw it win only three of the seven seats, but with the other four held by independents, it was able to continue in government. This was repeated after the 1964 elections, but the results of the 1969 elections (when it added &quot;Gibraltar Labour Party&quot; to its name) saw two new parties, the Integration with Britain Party and Isola Group win eight of the 15 seats between them, allowing them to form a government.

After a member of the Isola Group defected in 1972, early elections were called, which saw the AACR win eight of the 15 seats and return to government. The party won subsequent elections in 1976 and 1980.

After victory in the 1984 elections Hassan resigned without completing his term as Chief Minister in 1987 after an agreement on the shared use of Gibraltar Airport was signed by Spain and the United Kingdom, citing personal reasons. He was succeeded by the then Deputy Chief Minister, Adolfo Canepa. However, Canepa lost the 1988 election to Joe Bossano of the Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party (GSLP), winning only seven seats and forming the opposition in 1988. In 1992 they failed to return to power and were effectively dissolved thereafter. The last election with an AACR candidate was the 1998 by-election following the death of Robert Mor of the GSLP. The AACR candidate John Piris received only 337 votes and was defeated by Joseph Garcia of the Liberal Party of Gibraltar (LPG), backed by the GSLP.

==Ideology==
Until the 1960s the party was linked with the Gibraltar Confederation of Labour, which it had founded. However, the links with unions began to weaken thereafter. The party had a pragmatic and progressive policy platform, and aimed to strengthen relations with Britain, but also give the territory freedom. This was reflected in its campaign slogan &quot;With Britain, but not under Britain&quot;.

Like all other major Gibraltar political parties, it opposed transfer of sovereignty over Gibraltar from the United Kingdom to Spain.

==Gibraltar Award==
On 10 December 2007 the Self Determination for Gibraltar Group awarded the founding fathers of the AACR with the Gibraltar Award in recognition of their contribution to the political development, democratisation and emancipation of Gibraltar. The award was presented to Adolfo Canepa, the last AACR Chief Minister to hold office, in John Mackintosh Square on the 59th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

<text>The Road to Serfdom is a book by the Austrian-British economist and philosopher Friedrich Hayek. In the book, Hayek of the danger of tyranny that inevitably results from government control of economic decision-making through central planning.&quot; He further argues that the abandonment of individualism and classical liberalism inevitably leads to a loss of freedom, the creation of an oppressive society, the tyranny of a dictator, and the serfdom of the individual. Hayek challenged the view, popular among British Marxists, that fascism (including Nazism) was a capitalist reaction against socialism. He argued that fascism, Nazism, and state-socialism had common roots in central economic planning and empowering the state over the individual.

Since its publication in 1944, &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot; has been popular among liberal (especially classical liberal) and conservative thinkers. It has been translated into more than 20 languages and sold over two million copies (as of 2010). The book was first published in Britain by Routledge in March 1944, during World War II, and was quite popular, leading Hayek to call it &quot;that unobtainable book&quot;, also due in part to wartime paper rationing. It was published in the United States by the University of Chicago Press in September 1944 and achieved great popularity. At the arrangement of editor Max Eastman, the American magazine &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; published an abridged version in April 1945, enabling &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot; to reach a wider non-academic audience.

&quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot; was to be the popular edition of the second volume of Hayek&#x27;s treatise entitled &quot;The Abuse and Decline of Reason&quot;, and the title was inspired by the writings of the 19th century French classical liberal thinker Alexis de Tocqueville on the &quot;road to servitude&quot;. Initially written as a response to the report written by William Beveridge, the Liberal politician and dean of the London School of Economics where Hayek worked at the time, the book made a significant impact on 20th-century political discourse, especially American conservative and libertarian economic and political debate.

== Publication ==
While a professor at the London School of Economics in the early 1930s – in the era of the Great Depression, the rise of autocracies in Russia, Italy and Germany, and World War II – Hayek wrote a memo to William Beveridge, then the director there, to dispute the then-popular claim that fascism represented the dying gasp of a failed capitalist system. The memo grew into a magazine article, and he intended to incorporate elements of the article into a book much larger than &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot;. However, he ultimately decided to write &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot; as its own book.
The book was originally published for a British audience by Routledge Press in March 1944 in the United Kingdom. The book was subsequently rejected by three publishers in the United States, and it was only after economist Aaron Director spoke to friends at the University of Chicago that the book was published in the U.S by the University of Chicago Press on September 18, 1944. The American publisher&#x27;s expectation was that the book would sell between 900 and 3,000 copies. However, the initial printing run of 2,000 copies was quickly sold out, and 30,000 copies were sold within six months. , the University of Chicago Press estimated that more than 350,000 copies had been sold.

A 20-page version of the book was then published in the April 1945 issue of &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, with a press run of several million copies. A 95-page abridged version was also published in 1945 and 1946. In February 1945, a picture-book version was published in &quot;Look&quot; magazine, later made into a pamphlet and distributed by General Motors. The book has been translated into approximately 20 languages and is dedicated &quot;To the socialists of all parties&quot;. The introduction to the 50th anniversary edition is written by Milton Friedman (another recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economics 1976).

In 2007, the University of Chicago Press issued a &quot;Definitive Edition&quot;, Volume 2 in the &quot;Collected Works of F. A. Hayek&quot; series. In June 2010, the book achieved new popularity by rising to the top of the Amazon.com bestseller list following extended coverage of the book on &quot;The Glenn Beck Program&quot;. Since that date, it has sold another 250,000 copies in its print and digital editions.

== Summary ==
Hayek argues that Western democracies, including the United Kingdom and the United States, have &quot;progressively abandoned that freedom in economic affairs without which personal and political freedom has never existed in the past&quot;. Society has mistakenly tried to ensure continuing prosperity by centralized planning, which inevitably leads to totalitarianism. &quot;We have in effect undertaken to dispense with the forces which produced unforeseen results and to replace the impersonal and anonymous mechanism of the market by collective and &#x27;conscious&#x27; direction of all social forces to deliberately chosen goals.&quot; Socialism, while presented as a means of assuring equality, does so through &quot;restraint and servitude&quot;, while &quot;democracy seeks equality in liberty&quot;. Planning, because it is coercive, is an inferior method of regulation, while the competition of a free market is superior &quot;because it is the only method by which our activities can be adjusted to each other without the coercive or arbitrary intervention of authority&quot;.

Centralized planning is inherently undemocratic in Hayek&#x27;s view, because it requires &quot;that the will of a small minority be imposed upon the people&quot;. The power of these minorities to act by taking money or property in pursuit of centralized goals, destroys the Rule of Law and individual freedoms. Where there is centralized planning, &quot;the individual would more than ever become a mere means, to be used by the authority in the service of such abstractions as the &#x27;social welfare&#x27; or the &#x27;good of the community&#x27;&quot;. Even the very poor have more personal freedom in an open society than a centrally planned one. &quot;While the last resort of a competitive economy is the bailiff, the ultimate sanction of a planned economy is the hangman.&quot; Socialism is a hypocritical system because its professed humanitarian goals can only be put into practice by brutal methods &quot;of which most socialists disapprove&quot;. Such centralized systems also require effective propaganda, so that the people come to believe that the state&#x27;s goals are theirs.

Hayek argues that the roots of National Socialism lie in socialism, and then draws parallels to the thought of British leaders:
The increasing veneration for the state, the admiration of power, and of bigness for bigness&#x27; sake, the enthusiasm for &quot;organization&quot; of everything (we now call it &quot;planning&quot;) and that &quot;inability to leave anything to the simple power of organic growth&quot; ... are all scarcely less marked in England now than they were in Germany.

Hayek believed that after World War II, &quot;wisdom in the management of our economic affairs will be even more important than before and that the fate of our civilization will ultimately depend on how we solve the economic problems we shall then face&quot;. The only chance to build a decent world is &quot;to improve the general level of wealth&quot; via the activities of free markets. He saw international organization as involving a further threat to individual freedom. He concluded: &quot;The guiding principle that a policy of freedom for the individual is the only truly progressive policy remains as true today as it was in the nineteenth century.&quot;

=== Role of government ===
Although Hayek believed that government intervention in markets would lead to a loss of freedom, he recognized a limited role for government to perform tasks for which he believed free markets were not capable:
The successful use of competition as the principle of social organization precludes certain types of coercive interference with economic life, but it admits of others which sometimes may very considerably assist its work and even requires certain kinds of government action.

While Hayek is opposed to regulations that restrict the freedom to enter a trade, or to buy and sell at any price, or to control quantities, he acknowledges the utility of regulations that restrict legal methods of production, so long as these are applied equally to everyone and not used as an indirect way of controlling prices or quantities, and without forgetting the cost of such restrictions:
To prohibit the use of certain poisonous substances, or to require special precautions in their use, to limit working hours or to require certain sanitary arrangements, is fully compatible with the preservation of competition. The only question here is whether in the particular instance, the advantages gained are greater than the social costs they impose.

He notes that there are certain areas, such as the environment, where activities that cause damage to third parties (known to economists as &quot;negative externalities&quot;) cannot effectively be regulated solely by the marketplace:
Nor can certain harmful effects of deforestation, of some methods of farming, or of the smoke and noise of factories, be confined to the owner of the property in question, or to those willing to submit to the damage for an agreed compensation.

The government also has a role in preventing fraud:
Even the most essential prerequisite of its [the market&#x27;s] proper functioning, the prevention of fraud and deception (including exploitation of ignorance), provides a great and by no means fully accomplished object of legislative activity.

The government also has a role in creating a safety net:
There is no reason why, in a society which has reached the general level of wealth ours has, the first kind of security should not be guaranteed to all without endangering general freedom; that is: some minimum of food, shelter, and clothing, sufficient to preserve health. Nor is there any reason why the state should not help to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance in providing for those common hazards of life against which few can make adequate provision.

He concludes: &quot;In no system that could be rationally defended would the state just do nothing.&quot;

=== Clarifications ===
Since publication, Hayek has offered a number of clarifications on words that are frequently misinterpreted:
* &quot;Socialism&quot;, as Hayek used it, refers to state socialism and is used to mean state control of the economy, not a welfare state
* &quot;Classical liberal ideals&quot;, means liberty, freedom and individual rights, as Hayek understood them

== Reception ==
=== Impact ===
, the University of Chicago Press estimated that more than 350,000 copies of &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot; have been sold. It appears on Martin Seymour-Smith&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Most Influential Books Ever Written&quot;, and it made number 1 on Human Events: Top Ten Books Every Republican Congressman Should Read in 2006. It was influential enough to warrant mention during the 1945 British general election, when according to Harold Macmillan, Winston Churchill was &quot;fortified in his apprehensions [of a Labour government] by reading Professor Hayek&#x27;s &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot;&quot; when he warned in an election broadcast in 1945 that a socialist system would &quot;have to fall back on some form of Gestapo&quot;. The Labour leader Clement Attlee responded in his election broadcast by claiming that what Churchill had said was the &quot;second-hand version of the academic views of an Austrian professor, Friedrich August von Hayek&quot;. The Conservative Central Office sacrificed 1.5 tons of their precious paper ration allocated for the 1945 election so that more copies of &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot; could be printed, although to no avail, as Labour won a landslide victory.

Political historian Alan Brinkley had this to say about the impact of &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot;:
The publication of two books ... helped to galvanize the concerns that were beginning to emerge among intellectuals (and many others) about the implications of totalitarianism. One was James Burnham&#x27;s The Managerial Revolution ... [A second] Friedrich A. Hayek&#x27;s &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot; ... was far more controversial—and influential. Even more than Burnham, Hayek forced into public discourse the question of the compatibility of democracy and statism ... In responding to Burnham and Hayek ... liberals [in the statist sense of this term as used by some in the United States] were in fact responding to a powerful strain of Jeffersonian anti-statism in American political culture ... The result was a subtle but important shift in liberal [i.e. American statist] thinking.

=== Reviews ===
&quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot; has been the subject of much praise and much criticism. It was placed fourth on the list of the 100 best non-fiction books of the 20th century compiled by &quot;National Review&quot; magazine, was ranked number 16 in reader selections of the hundred best non-fiction book of the twentieth century administered by Modern Library, and appears on a recommended reading list for the libertarian right hosted on the Political Compass test website.

John Maynard Keynes said of it: &quot;In my opinion it is a grand book ... Morally and philosophically I find myself in agreement with virtually the whole of it: and not only in agreement with it, but in deeply moved agreement.&quot; However, Keynes did not think Hayek&#x27;s philosophy was of &quot;practical&quot; use; this was explained later in the same letter, commenting: &quot;What we need therefore, in my opinion, is not a change in our economic programmes, which would only lead in practice to disillusion with the results of your philosophy; but perhaps even the contrary, namely, an enlargement of them. Your greatest danger ahead is the probable practical failure of the application of your philosophy in the United States.&quot;

George Orwell responded with both praise and criticism, stating, &quot;in the negative part of Professor Hayek&#x27;s thesis there is a great deal of truth. It cannot be said too often – at any rate, it is not being said nearly often enough – that collectivism is not inherently democratic, but, on the contrary, gives to a tyrannical minority such powers as the Spanish Inquisitors never dreamt of.&quot; Yet he also warned, &quot;[A] return to &#x27;free&#x27; competition means for the great mass of people a tyranny probably worse, because more irresponsible, than that of the state.&quot;

Milton Friedman described &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot; as &quot;one of the great books of our time&quot;, and said of it:
I think the Adam Smith role was played in this cycle [i.e. the late twentieth century collapse of socialism in which the idea of free-markets succeeded first, and then special events catalyzed a complete change of socio-political policy in countries around the world] by Friedrich Hayek&#x27;s &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot;.

Herman Finer, a Fabian socialist, published a rebuttal in his &quot;The Road to Reaction&quot; in 1946. Hayek called Finer&#x27;s book &quot;a specimen of abuse and invective which is probably unique in contemporary academic discussion&quot;.

In his review (collected in &quot;The Present as History&quot;, 1953) Marxist Paul Sweezy joked that Hayek would have you believe that if there was an over-production of baby carriages, the central planners would then order the population to have more babies instead of simply warehousing the temporary excess of carriages and decreasing production for next year. The cybernetic arguments of Stafford Beer in his 1973 CBC Massey Lectures, &quot;Designing Freedom&quot; – that intelligent adaptive planning can increase freedom – are of interest in this regard, as is the technical work of Herbert A. Simon and Albert Ando on the dynamics of hierarchical nearly decomposable systems in economics – namely, that everything in such a system is not tightly coupled to everything else.

Mises Institute economist Walter Block has observed critically that while &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot; makes a strong case against centrally planned economies, it appears only lukewarm in its support of a free market system and &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism, with Hayek even going so far as to say that &quot;probably nothing has done so much harm to the liberal cause as the wooden insistence of some liberals on certain rules of thumb, above all the principle of laissez-faire capitalism&quot;. In the book, Hayek writes that the government has a role to play in the economy through the monetary system (a view that he later withdrew), work-hours regulation, social welfare, and institutions for the flow of proper information. Through analysis of this and many other of Hayek&#x27;s works, Block asserts that: &quot;in making the case against socialism, Hayek was led into making all sort of compromises with what otherwise appeared to be his own philosophical perspective – so much so, that if a system was erected on the basis of them, it would not differ too sharply from what this author explicitly opposed&quot;.

=== Criticism ===
Jeffrey Sachs argues that empirical evidence suggests welfare states, with high rates of taxation and social outlays, outperform the comparatively free-market economies. William Easterly wrote a rebuttal criticizing Sachs for misrepresenting Hayek&#x27;s work and for criticizing the book on issues it did not actually address, such as welfare programs for the elderly or sick, something Hayek did not oppose. Easterly noted that &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot; was about the dangers of centralized planning and nationalization of industry, including the media. In Sachs&#x27; counter-rebuttal, he argued that he was addressing Hayek&#x27;s foreword in the 1976 adaptation which stated that efforts to bring about large-scale welfare states would bring about serfdom, although much more slowly than under centralized planning. Sachs cited the Nordic states which remained economically free and relatively capitalist, despite a large welfare state that Hayek was wrong about such programs leading to serfdom.

Gordon Tullock has argued Hayek&#x27;s analysis incorrectly predicted governments in much of Europe in the late 20th century would descend into totalitarianism. He uses Sweden, in which the government at that time controlled 63 percent of GNP, as an example to support his argument that the basic problem with &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot; is &quot;that it offered predictions which turned out to be false. The steady advance of government in places such as Sweden has not led to any loss of non-economic freedoms.&quot; While criticizing Hayek, Tullock still praises the classical liberal notion of economic freedom, saying, &quot;Arguments for political freedom are strong, as are the arguments for economic freedom. We needn&#x27;t make one set of arguments depend on the other.&quot; However, according to Robert Skidelsky, Hayek &quot;safeguarded himself from such retrospective refutation&quot;. Skidelsky argues that Hayek&#x27;s argument was contingent, and that, &quot;By the 1970s there was some evidence of the slippery slope ... and then there was Thatcher. Hayek&#x27;s warning played a critical part in her determination to &#x27;roll back the state.&#x27;&quot;

Economic sociologist Karl Polanyi made a case diametrically opposed to Hayek, arguing that unfettered markets had undermined the social order and that economic breakdown had paved the way for the emergence of dictatorship.

Barbara Wootton wrote &quot;Freedom under Planning&quot; after reading an early copy of &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot;, provided to her by Hayek. In the introduction to her book, Wootton mentioned &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot; and claimed that &quot;Much of what I have written is devoted to criticism of the views put forward by Professor Hayek in this and other books.&quot; The central argument made in &quot;Freedom under Planning&quot; is that &quot;there is nothing in the conscious planning of economic priorities which is inherently incompatible with the freedoms which mean most to the contemporary Englishman or American. Civil liberties are quite unaffected. We can, if we wish, deliberately plan so as to give the fullest possible scope for the pursuit by individuals and social groups of cultural ends which are in no way state-determined.&quot; Wootton criticizes Hayek for claiming that planning &quot;must&quot; lead to oppression, when, in her view, that is merely one &quot;possibility&quot; among many. She argues that &quot;there seems hardly better case for taking for granted that planning will bring the worst to the top than for the opposite assumption that the seats of office will be filled with angels&quot;. Thus, Wootton acknowledges the possibility that planning may exist alongside tyranny but claims that it is equally possible to combine planning with freedom. She concludes that &quot;A happy and fruitful marriage between freedom and planning can, in short, be arranged.&quot; However, Frank Knight, founder of the Chicago school of economics, disputes the claim that &quot;Freedom under Planning&quot; contradicts &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot;. He wrote in a scholarly review of the Wootton book: &quot;Let me repeat that the Wootton book is in no logical sense an answer to &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot;, whatever may be thought of the cogency of Hayek&#x27;s argument, or the soundness of his position.&quot;

Eric Zencey wrote that the free market economy Hayek advocated is designed for an infinite planet, and when it runs into physical limits (as any growing system must), the result is a need for centralized planning to mediate the problematic interface of economy and nature. &quot;Planning is planning, whether it&#x27;s done to minimize poverty and injustice, as socialists were advocating then, or to preserve the minimum flow of ecosystem services that civilization requires, as we are finding increasingly necessary today.&quot;

<text>Astrid Benöhr (born 8 October 1957, in Bergisch Gladbach) is a German endurance athlete in Ultra-Triathlon. She holds the women&#x27;s world record in the quadruple ironman. She has also won women&#x27;s world championships in the double, quintuple and deca ironman in Ultra-Triathlon (also known as &quot;multiple Ironman&quot; disciplines), and held several other ultra-triathlon world records previously.

Benöhr began to run in her twenties, to aid her efforts to stop smoking. She started collecting ironman titles in 1987, working without a coach to this day. She is a housewife and has three children, born in 1980, 1981 and 1985. In an interview in 2003, she said that sex the night before a competition helps, as it relaxes and leads to deeper sleep.

Benöhr claims to have reached a better time than the men&#x27;s world record in Decatriathlon, in an own race against the watch but this can&#x27;t be verified. Her world records for females in triple, quadruple and quintuple triathlon are 6, 5.5 and 13.5 hours slower than the men&#x27;s world records. In the 1998 deca ironman race in Monterrey, Mexico, Astrid Benöhr was disqualified for taking significant shortcuts during the running segment.

<doc id="824924" wikidata="Q2470887" url="?curid=824924" title="USS Roper">
<text>USS &quot;Roper&quot; (DD-147) was a &quot;Wickes&quot;-class destroyer in the United States Navy, later converted to a high-speed transport and redesignated APD-20.

She was named for Lieutenant Commander Jesse M. Roper, commanding officer of , who died in 1901 while attempting to rescue a member of his crew. As of 2016, no other ships in the United States Navy have borne this name.

==Construction==
&quot;Roper&quot;&#x27;s keel was laid down on 19 March 1918 by William Cramp &amp; Sons, of Philadelphia. She was launched on 17 August 1918 sponsored by Mrs. Jesse M. Roper, widow of Lieutenant Commander Roper, and commissioned on 15 February 1919. &quot;Roper&quot; was the first United States Navy warship to sink a German submarine during World War II.

==Service history==

===Interwar period===
Following shakedown off the New England coast, &quot;Roper&quot; sailed east in mid-June 1919 and, after stops at Ponta Delgada, Gibraltar, and Malta, anchored in the Bosporus on 5 July. For the next month she supported Peace Commission and Relief Committee work in the Black Sea area, carrying mail and passengers to and from Constantinople, Novorossisk, Batum, Samsun, and Trebizond. On 20 August the destroyer returned to the United States, at New York City, only to sail again six days later. At the end of the month she transited the Panama Canal and moved north to San Diego.

&quot;Roper&quot; remained on the West Coast until July 1921. On 23 July, she departed San Francisco, for duty on the Asiatic Station. Arriving at Cavite, Philippine Islands, on 24 August, she remained in the Philippines into December. She then moved into Chinese waters and, into the summer, operated primarily from Hong Kong and Chefoo. On 25 August 1922, she headed back to California. Routed via Nagasaki, Midway, and Pearl Harbor she arrived at San Francisco on 13 October. Two days later she shifted to San Pedro, Los Angeles, thence proceeded to San Diego, where she was decommissioned on 14 December 1922 and berthed with the Pacific Reserve Fleet.

Recommissioned on 18 March 1930, &quot;Roper&quot; resumed operations in the Pacific. Operating primarily in the southern California area, in active and rotating reserve squadrons, for the next seven years, she deployed to Panama, to Hawaii and to the Caribbean for fleet problems and maneuvers in 1931, 1933, 1935, and 1936. During 1933, Lieutenant, junior grade Robert A. Heinlein, who would later gain fame as a science fiction author, transferred aboard &quot;Roper&quot;. In 1934 he was promoted to lieutenant, then &quot;invalided out,&quot; permanently disabled by tuberculosis. During January and February 1936, &quot;Roper&quot; moved north for operations in Alaskan waters.

In February 1937, &quot;Roper&quot; departed California and, after transiting the Panama Canal, joined the Atlantic Fleet. For the remainder of the year, through 1938, and into 1939, she conducted exercises primarily off the mid-Atlantic seaboard and, during part of each year, in the Caribbean. In November 1939, after the outbreak of World War II in Europe, she shifted from Norfolk, Virginia, to Key West, Florida, whence she patrolled the Yucatán Channel and the Florida Straits. In December, she returned to Norfolk. In January 1940, she moved south again, to Charleston, South Carolina, and in March she headed north for duty on the New England Patrol.

===World War II===
Through the prewar Neutrality Patrol period, &quot;Roper&quot; continued to range the waters off the East and Gulf Coasts. Off Cape Cod on 7 December 1941, it returned to Norfolk for an abbreviated availability at midmonth, and then steamed to NS Argentia, Newfoundland. In early February 1942, it completed a convoy escort run to Londonderry Port, then, in March, returned to the Norfolk area for patrol and escort duty.

&quot;Roper&quot; was one of several ships to rescue survivors of the SS &quot;City of New York&quot; that had been sunk by &quot;U-160&quot;. Desanka Mohorovic, one of the passengers, ended up giving birth in one of the lifeboats. She was picked up by &quot;Roper&quot;, and ended up naming her baby after the rescue vessel.

A month later, on the night of 13/14 April, it made contact with a surfaced U-boat off the coast of North Carolina. The ensuing chase ended with the sinking by artillery fire of , a unit of the 7th U-boat Flotilla. Thus the &quot;Roper&quot; sank the first German submarine by U.S. naval forces in WWII.

According to the after-action report, the attack occurred after midnight local time after &quot;Roper&quot; closed to identify an unknown contact (&quot;U-85&quot;) and was narrowly missed by a torpedo before opening fire. The commanding officer delayed rescue operations until daybreak and after the arrival of air support from a PBY Catalina and an airship due to concern of an attack by a second U-boat. No charges were filed against the crew of &quot;Roper&quot; and 29 sailors of &quot;U-85&quot; were buried with military honors at Hampton National Cemetery.

For their actions in sinking &quot;U-85&quot;, Destroyer Division 54 commander, Commander Stanley C. Norton, and the &quot;Roper&quot;″s captain, Lieutenant commander Hamilton W. Howe, were each awarded the Navy Cross.

Former commander of German U-boat &quot;U-802&quot; and author Helmut Schmoeckel suggested in a 2002 book that the failure of &quot;Roper&quot; to rescue the &quot;U-85&quot; crew after they abandoned the submarine and &quot;Roper&quot;″s subsequent depth charging of &quot;U-85&quot; should be investigated. He never used the phrase war crime, as is sometimes stated, and he relied on a very inaccurate American book as his source.

On 29 April, &quot;Roper&quot; rescued 14 survivors from the British merchantman , which had been torpedoed and sunk by five days earlier. On 1 May, it rescued another 13 survivors from &quot;Empire Drum&quot;. They were landed at Norfolk, Virginia, that day. At the end of May, &quot;Roper&quot; began a series of coastwise escort runs, from Key West to New York, which took her into 1943. In February of that year, it shifted to Caribbean–Mediterranean convoy work and remained on that duty until October when it entered the Charleston Navy Yard for conversion to a high-speed transport.

===Convoys escorted===
===Auxiliary service===
Reclassified and given hull classification symbol APD-20 (transport destroyer) on 20 October 1943, &quot;Roper&quot; departed Charleston in late November and trained in the Chesapeake Bay area and off the Florida coast into the new year, 1944. On 13 April, she steamed east and at the end of the month joined the 8th Fleet at Oran, Algeria. A unit of Transport Division 13, assigned to support the offensive in Italy, &quot;Roper&quot; landed units of the French Army on Pianosa on 17 June and, into July, plied between Oran and Naples and operated along the western coast of the embattled peninsula. In August, she shifted her attention to southern France. On 15 August, she arrived off that coast as part of the &quot;Sitka&quot; Force and landed troops on Levant Island. On 5 September she returned to Italy; resumed runs between Naples and Oran, and, in early December departed the latter port for Hampton Roads.

Arriving at Norfolk on 21 December, &quot;Roper&quot; sailed again on 29 January 1945. On transiting the Panama Canal, she reported to the Pacific Fleet, and, after stops in California and Hawaii, moved into the Mariana Islands.

====Okinawa====
On 11 May 1945, she departed Guam for the Ryukyu Islands. Arriving in Nakagusuku Wan on 22 May, she circled to the Hagushi anchorage off Okinawa the same day. Three days later, while on screening station off that transport area she was hit by a &quot;kamikaze&quot;.

Ordered back to the United States to complete repairs, she departed the Ryukyus on 6 June and reached San Pedro a month later. In August, she shifted to Mare Island, but with the cessation of hostilities repair work was halted.

==Fate==
Decommissioned on 15 September 1945, &quot;Roper&quot;″s name was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 11 October 1945, and her hulk was sold to the Lerner Company, Oakland, California. Removed in June 1946, she was scrapped in December 1946.

==Legacy==
&quot;Roper&quot;&#x27;s anchor is located outside of building 5 of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus.

==Awards==
* American Defense Service Medal
* American Campaign Medal with one battle star
* European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with two battle stars
* Asiatic–Pacific Campaign Medal with one battle star
* World War II Victory Medal

&quot;Roper&quot; was one a very few U.S. Navy ships to have received battle stars in all three theaters of operations during World War II.

==Notable crew==
* Ernest E. Evans – future MOH recipient. Served aboard &quot;Roper&quot; from 1932 to 1933 as an ensign.
* Robert A. Heinlein – served aboard &quot;Roper&quot; from 1933 to 1934 as a lieutenant.

<text>Jesse M. Roper (29 October 1851 – 31 March 1901) was an officer in the United States Navy during the Spanish–American War.

==Biography==
Born at Glasgow, Missouri, Roper was appointed midshipman in June 1868 and graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1872. Commissioned lieutenant commander in 1899, he assumed command of USS &quot;Petrel&quot; (PG-2) shortly thereafter. On 31 March 1901, while &quot;Petrel&quot; was moored at Cavite, Philippine Islands, fire broke out in the sail room, adjacent to the magazines. Lieutenant Commander Roper went down into the burning area twice to rescue trapped seamen. Lieutenant Commander Roper was overcome by smoke on his second descent and suffocated before help could reach him.

==Namesake==
The destroyer USS &quot;Roper&quot; (DD-147) was named in his honor.

<doc id="824942" wikidata="Q7263155" url="?curid=824942" title="Pyote Air Force Base">
<text>Pyote Air Force Base was a World War II United States Army Air Forces training airbase. It was on a mile from the town of Pyote, Texas, on U.S. Highway 80, 20 miles west of Monahans,` east of El Paso.
It was nicknamed &quot;Rattlesnake Bomber Base&quot; for the numerous rattlesnake dens that were uncovered during its construction.

At the height of its use in 1944, the base had over 6,000 officers and enlisted men, either permanently assigned or temporarily attached. In addition, hundreds of civilians came from all over the United States to work on the base.

After World War II, thousands of reserve aircraft were stored there, one of which was the B-29 &quot;Enola Gay&quot;.

Today, most of the base is gone. Other than the concrete runways, taxiways, and ramp, virtually nothing remains that would tell the casual observer that this was once a major training center responsible for turning out highly trained flying crews. In later years, the West Texas State School was situated on the site; it was closed in 2010. Located on I-20 at exit 66.

==Origins==
Pyote Army Air Field was established as a B-17 Flying Fortress crew-training base during World War II. Initially, newly established bomber groups were trained at Pyote, then it was switched to training replacement aircrew members who were deployed to combat units overseas. Initially, Pyote Army Air Field was assigned to Second Air Force, then in April 1944, to USAAF Continental Air Forces training command.
Two main runways, each about 8,000 ft long and 150 ft wide, and a taxiway formed a triangle pattern on the flat, arid land. Construction of the facilities, including five large hangars, shops, warehouses, and living quarters, began on 5 September 1942.

==World War II use==
The first troops were assigned within a month, well before the base was completed. Troops and civilian technicians poured in, and the population of the base grew steadily to a peak of over 6,500 in October 1944.

Within four months of its opening, the base had become the largest bomber installation in the country. Despite morale problems caused by isolation and the shortage of off-base recreation and of dependents&#x27; housing, Pyote achieved a distinguished record in molding inexperienced individuals into effective bomber crews.

After the arrival of the famed 19th Bombardment Group&#x27; on 1 January 1943, and the ceremonial inauguration of its training program on 5 January 1943, Pyote rapidly turned out crews proficient in hitting targets from the B-17 Flying Fortress until the summer of 1944, when it was switched to the B-29 Superfortress.

The 19th BG was the first air force unit to bomb Japanese targets. It flew to Pyote directly from combat in the Pacific. The base was redesignated the 19th Combat Crew Training School&#x27; late in 1943, and then replaced on 30 March 1944, by the 236th Army Air Forces Base Unit (Combat Crew Training School).

Known B-17 units trained at Pyote AAB were:
* 381st Bombardment Group (Heavy) 3 January - 5 April 1943
* 96th Bombardment Group (Heavy) January - March 1943

In June 1945, the base claimed records for the most B-29 training hours flown by any base in a single month (7,396), in a week (1,873), and in a day (321).

Known B-29 groups which trained at Pyote AAB were:
* 301st Bombardment Group (Very Heavy)
* 454th Bombardment Group (Very Heavy)

With the end of the war in the Pacific in August 1945, both of these groups were inactivated.

==Postwar use==

===Aircraft storage depot===

Control of Pyote was transferred from the Fourth Air Force to the Air Technical Service Command / San Antonio Air Technical Service Command on 15 November 1945, at the end of the war. The base became an aircraft storage depot. During the postwar years, the temporary tar-paper and wooden buildings were largely sold off, with the personnel using more substantial concrete structures for their duties along with the hangars and support buildings by the flightline ramp.

At its peak in 1948, Pyote Air Force Base&#x27; was maintained by the 4141st Army Air Forces (later Air Force) Base Unit, and housed 2,042 stored planes, mostly B-29s and B-17s, but including B-25s, A-26s, C-47s, P-63s, P-51s, AT-7s, L-5s, and L-4s.

Aircraft storage and the cocooning of some of these planes was the last major activity at Pyote Air Field, which was the responsibility of the 2753d Aircraft Storage Squadron. Storage included not only preserving planes for future use, but also transferring some of the stored planes to other Air Force units for their use.

Corrosion control crews removed, cleaned, and treated the turrets in all of the B-29s. The aircraft were &quot;cocooned&quot; to seal out the elements from the interior, and the aircraft were kept in flyable reserve storage.

Best known of all the aircraft stored at Pyote was the B-29 &quot;Enola Gay&quot;, from which the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. Arriving at Pyote on 12 January 1952, the ownership of the aircraft was transferred to the Smithsonian Institution. The &quot;Enola Gay&quot; was taken out of storage and flown to Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, on 2 December 1953, for preservation at the National Air and Space Museum. It was the last time she flew. Two other notable aircraft put in storage at Pyote were the B-17D &quot;Swoose&quot; (arrived 18 January 1952 - Departed December 1953), which was the only B-17 to survive the bombing of Clark Air Base on 8 December 1941 and manage to escape from the Philippines, and the XB-42 Mixmaster, a one-of-a-kind aircraft.

Beginning in 1950, the demands for B-29s to be used in the Korean War meant that nearly 100 of the aircraft stored at Pyote were refurbished and sent to active-duty units on Okinawa for use in combat, while some stored B-29s were authorized to be used for cannibalization to furnish spare parts to operational aircraft. Many of the B-29s stored at Pyote were flown by the men of the 19th Bomb Group. This is the same group that was the first to serve at Pyote in 1943. Air battles between the B-29s and Soviet MiG-15s, in the skies of North Korea made it clear that the age of the jet had arrived, which made most of the propeller-driven combat aircraft stored at Pyote obsolete.

After the 1953 Armistice in Korea, the Air Force ordered most of the remaining planes at Pyote to be scrapped, and activity on the base was sharply curtailed. Its mission became the reclamation and salvage of the stored aircraft. The B-29s stored at the base were very important, as the reclamation process consisted of removing all serviceable and reparable items to support the operational B-29s still in service. A smelter was installed on the base and as the aircraft were disassembled and parts removed, the remnants were recycled with the metal sold for scrap.

The last base commander, Lt. Col. Max A. Piper, was notified that the base was scheduled for deactivation on 31 December 1953, and the base went on standby status, leaving only a 27-man caretaker crew to maintain the facility. The last plane left Pyote AFB sometime in 1955, along with the standby crew. At that time, most of the permanent buildings and hangars remained, although abandoned.

===Air Defense Radar Station===

In April 1958, the base was reopened as Pyote Air Force Station (TM-186), a radar installation acting as one link in a chain of installations that were part of an early-warning network in case of Soviet air attack during the Cold War. The 697th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, an Air Defense Command 34th Air Division unit, operated a radar site about southwest of the main containment area . The 697th ACWS operated a Bendix AN/FPS-3 search radar with a range around 200 miles; it also operated a General Electric AN/FPS-6 height-finder radar with a range around 300 miles. The station functioned as a ground-control intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron&#x27;s role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit&#x27;s radar scopes.

In addition to the radar station, the Air Force built base housing and several support buildings. The NW/SE runway was also activated and used to fly crews in and out of the base and for logistical support.

In March 1963, the Air Force ordered the site to close. Operations at Pyote ceased on 1 August 1963. With the ADC facility closed, Pyote AFB was declared surplus, and turned over to the General Services Administration (GSA) for disposal.

==Current status==

Following the deactivation of the site in 1963, the facilities were disposed of by the GSA. The Air Defense Command support buildings along with the base family housing were provided to the West Texas Children&#x27;s Home, and the land and remaining buildings were turned over to the University of Texas at Austin. The Confederate Air Force used the runway and some of the remaining buildings on the flightline in the early 1960s, but the remoteness of the base led to it being closed by 1965 as uneconomical. The last of the original World War II support buildings on the base were gone by 1977.

Six huge hangars once fronted the concrete ramp. Five are visible in an aerial photo dated 1977. At some point after 1980, four of the hangars were apparently removed or destroyed. At least one of them was evidently intentionally destroyed in 1979 in the course of filming the movie &quot;Hangar 18&quot; (1980). By 1985, a single large hangar (the former 3d Echelon Maintenance Hangar) remained and slowly deteriorating runways and taxiways were all that marked the once-busy bomber base. At some point between 1989 and &#x27;96, the roof and most of the walls of the former 3d Echelon Maintenance Hangar were removed, leaving only a hollow grid of the side walls of the hangar standing.

The west side of the former AAF/AFB, where the actual airfield was, is deserted. Runways and taxiways, hardstands, and the flightline apron exist with tall weeds and other sparse vegetation slowly taking over the concrete areas. The Air Defense Command radar site southeast of the base is abandoned and full of junk vehicles; the buildings on it are still standing in a deteriorated state.
The property was being used by the Texas Youth Commission&#x27;s West Texas State School. The former AFB family housing (small, individual units) was used by the prison staff. The state school closed in 2010.

The original entrance has been refurbished, and today stands as a memorial to the men and women who worked and trained here, many of whom gave their lives while learning to effectively use the B-17 and B-29.

In the town of Pyote, about 15 miles west of Monahans, a museum honors the memory of the men and women who served there. Pyote Army Air Field played an important role in the local community during World War II. Base personnel had a long-lasting social relationship with the local citizens, and the base itself created jobs and great economic prosperity for the community. Pyote was quite literally transformed by the base. When the base finally closed for good in the early 1960s, it left a lasting impression on the local community.

<doc id="824975" wikidata="Q11420454" url="?curid=824975" title="List of members of the Diet of Japan">
<text>This is a list of members of the [[National Diet|Diet of Japan]]. The Diet has two chambers: the House of Councillors (upper house) and the House of Representatives (lower house). Councillors serve six year terms, with half being elected every three years. Representatives serve terms of up to four years, but the House of Representatives can be dissolved, causing a shorter term (snap election).

==House of Representatives==
Below are lists of representatives elected in Japanese general elections since 2003.

* Members of the House of Representatives elected in the 43rd general election (2003)
* Members of the House of Representatives elected in the 44th general election (2005)
* Members of the House of Representatives elected in the 45th general election (2009)
* Members of the House of Representatives elected in the 46th general election (2012)
* Members of the House of Representatives elected in the 47th general election (2014)
* Members of the House of Representatives elected in the 48th general election (2017)
* Members of the House of Representatives elected in the 49th general election (2021)
* Current list: Members of the House of Representatives elected in the 50th general election (2024)

===Composition===
List of members by parliamentary group and constituency. There are usually translations and abbreviations for used on the English pages of the House of Representatives website,
* LDP 
* Kōmeitō 
* CDP 
* DPFP 
* JCP 
* Nippon Ishin 
* Group of Independents 
* SDP 
* Independents

Notes:
* Not all members of a parliamentary group are necessarily members of the associated party/parties if any, and vice versa. For example, the Speaker and Vice-Speaker of the House of Representatives are independents in terms of parliamentary group membership, but not independents in terms of party membership.
* The count of terms as given by the House of Representatives follows the usual way of counting them in Japan by number of won elections &quot;(tōsen kaisū)&quot; which is not necessarily identical to election periods of the House of Representatives. For example, former member Nobutaka Machimura served for two terms as a member during the (2009–2012) 45th election period of the House of Representatives: one as member for the Hokkaidō proportional constituency from the general election in August 2009 to his resignation in September 2010, and one as member for constituency number 5 in Hokkaidō from the by-election in October 2010 to dissolution in November 2012. Among other things, the election count determines the seating within a parliamentary group, the more senior members by this measure sit in the back.
* Most proportional members of the House of Representatives have been deleted.

==House of Councillors==
=== Composition ===
List of members by parliamentary group and constituency. There are usually translations and abbreviations for parliamentary groups (会派 kaiha, current House of Councillors website translation: &quot;In-House Group&quot;) used on the English pages of the House of Representatives website
 The official caucus names are transcribed to Latin here:
* LDP 
* Kōmeitō 
* CDP 
* DPFP 
* Ishin 
* JCP 
* Reiwa 
* SDP 
* PPPNHK 
* Independents 
Notes:
* Not all members of a caucus are also members of the affiliated party, and sometimes even some members of a party are not member of the affiliated caucus.
* The N→S column allows to sort by prefecture from North to South in the order generally used in Japan (also used as number identifier for prefectures [JP-##] in ISO 3166-2).
* Due to a 2015 reapportionment, some districts are represented by an uneven number of members until the regular 2019 election, when it becomes effective in both halves.

<doc id="824982" wikidata="Q6224030" url="?curid=824982" title="John Burroughs School">
<text>John Burroughs School (JBS) is a private, non-sectarian college-preparatory school with 631 students in grades 7–12. Its 49-acre () campus is located in Ladue, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. Founded in 1923, it is named for U.S. naturalist and philosopher John Burroughs.

John Burroughs has long had a school philosophy of liberal and progressive education. It has been recognized as one of the nation&#x27;s premier preparatory schools. In 2007, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; ranked it among the top 50 schools in sending graduates to eight top universities.

As of 2020, the faculty includes 96 full-time and 32 part-time members. Since 2009, the head of school has been Andy Abbott, formerly an English teacher and the school&#x27;s head of college counseling. He replaced Keith Shahan, who served as headmaster for 23 years.

== History ==
In 1922, a group of St. Louisans announced their intention to open a private school in a suburb of St. Louis. &quot;This school is being established to meet a very definite demand for another country day school, and is an outgrowth of a condition whereby existing schools are unable to accept all pupils applying for entrance,&quot; the &quot;St. Louis Star and Times&quot; reported.

In &quot;executive charge&quot; of the campaign to build the school was Edna Fischel Gellhorn, a co-founder of the League of Women Voters. The 18-acre site, located on the streetcar line from Clayton, was purchased for $18,000 
($ today) and the initial campus buildings, including a gymnasium, were built for $180,000. Tuition was $500 per year, with scholarships available to up to 10 percent of students.

Classes began on Oct. 2, 1923, ahead of a formal cornerstone-laying ceremony the following week. The gym was completed in December at a cost of $38,000; the main speaker at its dedication ceremony was Branch Rickey, manager of the St. Louis Cardinals baseball team.

The school&#x27;s founders wrote, &quot;Burroughs was established upon the conviction that each child has latent possibilities of power, and that it is the chief purpose of the school to cooperate with parents in discovering, fostering and developing that power so that in adulthood he shall make his contribution to the improvement of human society. The child&#x27;s mind is not a tablet to be written upon or a cistern to be filled, but a living, growing entity to be guided, developed, trained and inspired.&quot;

In the 1930s, JBS participated in the Eight-Year Study, an experiment that tested how American progressive secondary schools would prepare their students for college when released from the curricular restrictions of college admissions requirements.

In April 2020, the school received $2.5 million in federally backed small business loans as part of the Paycheck Protection Program. The school received scrutiny over this loan, which was meant to protect small and private businesses, and returned the money to the Treasury Department the following month.

The school is fundraising to raise its endowment to $100 million by June 2026.

<doc id="824991" wikidata="Q11680643" url="?curid=824991" title="Cecil Turtle">
<text>Cecil Turtle is a fictional character in the Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series of films. Though he made only three theatrical appearances, Cecil has the unusual distinction that he is one of the very few characters who were able to outsmart Bugs Bunny, and the only one to do so three times in a row and at the rabbit&#x27;s own game. Cecil often gives Bugs the taunting nickname of &quot;Speedy&quot; when addressing the rabbit.

==History==
===&quot;Tortoise Beats Hare&quot;===
Animator Tex Avery introduced Cecil in the short &quot;Tortoise Beats Hare&quot;, released on March 15, 1941. Even from the cartoon&#x27;s opening titles, Avery lets on that Bugs Bunny is about to meet his match. Bugs wanders onto the screen munching his obligatory carrot and absent-mindedly begins reading the title card, grossly mispronouncing most of the credits, such as for &quot;Avery&quot; rather than the correct . When he finally gets to the title itself, he becomes outraged, tears apart the title card, and rushes to Cecil Turtle&#x27;s house. He then bets the little, sleepy-eyed turtle ten dollars that he can beat him in a race.

Cecil accepts Bugs&#x27; bet, and the race begins several days later. Bugs races away at top speed just before finishing the shout of, &quot;Get on your mark, get set, go!&quot; Cecil quickly (for him, anyway) goes to a public telephone and calls up Chester Turtle, one of his relatives. After talking to Chester about the bet, he tells him to call &quot;the boys&quot; (cousins), and tell them to be ready when he comes to their position, and to &quot;give him the works&quot;. Chester calls the relatives, all of whom look and sound like Cecil (some have deeper voices, some have higher voices), and relays the message. As Bugs runs relentlessly toward the finish line, Cecil and the other turtles take turns showing up at just the right moment to baffle the bunny. In the end, Bugs is convinced he has won, only to see Cecil (or one of his kin) across the finish demanding the money. Bugs suggests that he has been tricked, and all nine turtles approach and reply, &quot;It&#x27;s a possibility!&quot; Voice actor Mel Blanc supplies Cecil&#x27;s drowsy drawl, which is like a slowed-down version of Blanc&#x27;s later characterization of Barney Rubble.

&quot;Tortoise Beats Hare&quot; follows one of the many folk variants of the Aesop fable &quot;The Tortoise and the Hare&quot; in which the faster beast is deceived by look-alikes placed along the course. More directly, it is Avery&#x27;s parody of the 1935 Disney &quot;Silly Symphony&quot;, &quot;The Tortoise and the Hare&quot;. Avery left Warner Bros. before he could produce any new cartoons featuring Cecil. However, he introduced a similar character in 1943 named Droopy Dog. Droopy would even take some of his tricks from his slow-and-steady predecessor, such as using his relatives to help him outsmart a wolf.

===&quot;Tortoise Wins by a Hare&quot;===
Bob Clampett took Avery&#x27;s scenario and altered it for his film &quot;Tortoise Wins by a Hare&quot; released on February 20, 1943. The title is an appropriate pun on &quot;hair&quot;. Bugs again challenges Cecil to a race after viewing footage from their previous encounter two years earlier (which seems to depict Cecil as having won fairly instead of by cheating Bugs with his cousins). Bugs then goes to Cecil&#x27;s tree home disguised as an old man (a parody of Bill Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Old Timer&quot; character from the radio series &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot;) to ask the turtle his secret. Cecil, not in the least bit fooled by the disguise remarks, &quot;Clean livin&#x27;, friend. Clean livin&#x27;...&quot;. And then reveals his streamlined shell lets him win, and produces a set of blueprints for his &quot;air-flow chassis&quot;. The turtle ends the conversation with the comment, &quot;Oh, and another thing... Rabbits aren&#x27;t very bright, either!&quot; just before slamming the door in the enraged bunny&#x27;s face. Not getting the hint that the turtle&#x27;s story is a humbug, Bugs builds the device and prepares for the race.

Meanwhile, a bunny mob learns of the upcoming match-up and places all its bets on Bugs. (&quot;In fact, we don&#x27;t even think that the toitle will finish... Do we, boys?&quot; &quot;Duh, no, Boss, no!&quot;) The race begins, and Bugs still outpaces his reptilian rival. However, in his new get-up, the dim-witted gangsters mistake him for the turtle. Cecil reinforces this misconception by dressing in a gray rabbit suit and munching on some delicious carrots. The mobsters thus make the shelled Bugs&#x27; run a nightmare, ultimately giving the race to Cecil (in an aside to the audience, as the rabbits cheer him, Cecil remarks &quot;I &quot;told&quot; you rabbits aren&#x27;t very bright!&quot;). When Bugs angrily tears off the chassis, and shouts, &quot;You FOOLS! I&#x27;M the rabbit!&quot; the rabbit gangsters remark, in mock-Bugsy style, &quot;Ehhh, &quot;now&quot; he tells us!&quot; and commit suicide by shooting themselves with a single bullet that goes through the sides of all of their apparently soft heads. (The final gag is often cut when shown on basic cable television, but can be found uncut on the &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection&quot;: Volume 1.)

===&quot;Rabbit Transit&quot;===
Cecil and Bugs would have one final match up in Friz Freleng&#x27;s cartoon, &quot;Rabbit Transit&quot;, released on May 10, 1947. The title is a play of Rapid Transit. Unlike &quot;Tortoise Wins by a Hare&quot;, this cartoon presumes that Bugs and Cecil have never met before now. While relaxing in a steam bath, Bugs reads about the original fable and, as he did reading the credits of &quot;Tortoise Beats Hare&quot;, becomes incensed at the idea of a turtle outrunning a rabbit. Cecil, also in the steam bath, claims that he could outrun Bugs, prompting Bugs to challenge him to a race (again, as in &quot;Tortoise Beats Hare&quot;, although at least here Bugs receives some provocation). This time, Bugs and Cecil agree to no cheating. Cecil, however, quickly reveals that his shell is now rocket propelled, allowing him to go a surprising combination between fast &quot;and&quot; slow. Bugs does his best to steal, dismantle, and destroy the device, but all to little effect. In the end, however, Bugs does manage to top the turtle and crosses the finish line first. Nevertheless, it is Cecil who has the last laugh when he rooks the rabbit into confessing to &quot;doing 100 easy&quot;—in a 30-miles-per-hour zone. Bugs is taken away by the police to enjoy his victory — behind bars. Cecil closes out the cartoon by saying Bugs&#x27; famous line, &quot;Ain&#x27;t I um...a stinker?&quot; Iris-out.

==Other appearances==
The Warners directors retired Cecil after his third showdown with Bugs. Nevertheless, Cecil has made occasional cameos in later projects. He is seen briefly in the 1996 film &quot;Space Jam&quot; as an audience member during the game and its 2021 sequel &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot; in Bugs&#x27; flashback leaving Tune World in front of Charlie Dog. He also appears in the 2003 DVD &quot;Looney Tunes: Reality Check&quot;, voiced by Joe Alaskey. He also made a cameo in one episode of &quot;The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries&quot;, voiced by Frank Welker.

He features in some issues of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; comic book.

His only notable Warner Bros. Animation &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; short cameo came in 1954&#x27;s &quot;Devil May Hare&quot;, which was directed by Robert McKimson and pitted Bugs against the Tasmanian Devil, who made his debut here.

Cecil Turtle appears in &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot;, voiced by Jim Rash. He and Bugs are once again enemies like in the classic shorts, and he has a habit of mispronouncing Bugs&#x27;s name as &quot;Buges Buney.&quot; In Cecil&#x27;s appearances on this show, he is the one who gets outwitted by Bugs, the first time in Looney Tunes history. His next appearance was in the episode &quot;The Shell Game&quot;. Now working as a scammer, Cecil tricks both Bugs and Porky into thinking they damaged his shell. However, Bugs started seeing through Cecil&#x27;s con, and confronted him with Porky and took down his shell scam and sending him to prison, as well as scoring another victory over Cecil. Cecil also appears as one of the main antagonists in the spinoff film &quot;Looney Tunes: Rabbits Run&quot;, voiced again by Rash and appearing as a spy working for the Mexican general Foghorn Leghorn until the near climax reveals that he has been working for Marvin the Martian.

Cecil makes recurring appearances in &quot;New Looney Tunes&quot;, voiced by series producer Matt Craig. In the show he and Bugs have races against each other which ends with both of them losing.

Cecil appears in &quot;Looney Tunes Cartoons&quot;, voiced by Keith Ferguson. He appears in the episode &quot;Shell Shocked&quot;, where traveling from Bronx to Brooklyn, Bugs beats a Public Transit Train and comments how nobody is faster than him. However, Bugs becomes infuriated when he comes across advertisements showcasing Cecil Turtle as the &quot;actual fastest thing in New York City&quot;. Bugs runs into Cecil and challenges him to a footrace to a nearby lamppost. Bugs gains the early lead but Cecil ties the street Bugs is on to a taxi going to St. Louis, allowing Cecil to win. Bugs then challenges Cecil to see how fast they can multiply numbers, but Cecil wins again by multiplying himself. Bugs becomes enraged and has one more challenge for Cecil: how fast he can eat carrots. However, Bugs disguised a bomb as a carrot. When the bomb doesn&#x27;t go off, Bugs looks and sees all the carrots have been eaten by Cecil. Bugs looks into Cecil&#x27;s shell, coming face-to-face with the bomb that explodes right in his face. As Cecil proclaims victory, Bugs says there is one thing he&#x27;s better at than Cecil: losing and starts crying.

Cecil appeared in &quot;Bugs Bunny Builders&quot;, where he is voiced by Bob Bergen. Unlike his original short films and other television series, he and Bugs appear on friendly terms.

==Legacy==
Because of Cecil&#x27;s modest amount of popularity, Warner Bros. created a protégé of the character in &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; named Tyrone Turtle. Unlike Cecil and Bugs, however, Tyrone is on friendly terms with Bugs&#x27;s Tiny Toons counterpart, Buster Bunny.

<text>Kenneth Lerner (born May 27, 1948) is an American television, stage and film actor. He is known for playing Principal Flutie in the first episodes of the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, and earlier roles on &quot;Happy Days&quot;, along with numerous film and television guest-starring roles.

==Early life==
Lerner was born in Brooklyn, New York, of Romanian-Jewish descent. He is the youngest of three sons of Blanche and George Lerner, who was a fisherman and antiques dealer. His brother was actor Michael Lerner.

==Career==

Lerner is typically typecast as whiny or unlucky characters, including an agent who is stabbed in the back with a pen by Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s character Ben Richards in &quot;The Running Man&quot;. One of his first roles was as one of the Malachi Brothers in the television series &quot;Happy Days&quot; in 1975–76.

In 2011, Lerner was seen in an American nationally televised commercial for Wells Fargo Bank. In late 2013, Lerner starred in a commercial for T-Mobile USA. In 2016, Lerner played a small role as a corrupt business manager named Arthur in the HBO television series &quot;Silicon Valley&quot;. Lerner plays a recurring role on the series &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;, on which his son Sam Lerner stars.

<text>Commerce raiding is a form of naval warfare used to destroy or disrupt logistics of the enemy on the open sea by attacking its merchant shipping, rather than engaging its combatants or enforcing a blockade against them. Privateering is a form of commerce raiding conducted by independent operators.

==Privateering==
The first sort of commerce raiding was for nations to commission privateers. Early instances of this type of warfare were by the English and Dutch against the Spanish treasure fleets of the 16th century, which resulted in financial gain for both captain and crew upon capture of enemy vessels (&quot;prizes&quot;).

===17th and 18th centuries===
Privateers formed a large part of the total military force at sea during the 17th and 18th centuries. In the First Anglo-Dutch War, English privateers attacked the trade on which the United Provinces entirely depended, capturing over 1,000 Dutch merchant ships. During the subsequent war with Spain, Spanish and Flemish privateers in the service of the Spanish Crown, including the notorious Dunkirkers, captured 1,500 English merchant ships, which provided a major boost to the flagging Dutch trade. Dutch privateers and others also attacked English trade, whether coastal, Atlantic, or Mediterranean, in the Second and Third Anglo-Dutch wars.

During the Nine Years&#x27; War, French policy strongly encouraged privateers, including the famous Jean Bart, to attack English and Dutch shipping. England lost roughly 4,000 merchant ships during the war. In the following War of Spanish Succession, privateer attacks continued, Britain losing 3,250 merchant ships. Parliament passed an updated Cruisers and Convoys Act in 1708, allocating regular warships to the defence of trade.

In the War of Austrian Succession, the Royal Navy was able to concentrate more on defending British ships. Britain lost 3,238 merchantmen, a smaller fraction of her merchant marine than the enemy losses of 3,434. While French losses were proportionally severe, the smaller but better-protected Spanish trade suffered the least, and Spanish privateers enjoyed much of the best plunder of enemy merchantmen, particularly in the West Indies.

==Napoleonic Wars==
During Britain&#x27;s wars against Revolutionary and Napoleonic France, the Royal Navy dominated the seas. France adopted a &quot;guerre de course&quot; strategy by licensing civilian privateers to seize British shipping. British East Indiamen of the time were therefore heavily armed to protect themselves against such raids, at the cost of considerable speed and maneuverability. Some East Indiamen, such as , were successfully able to fend off these attacks in other parts of the world; others, such as when &quot;Kent&quot; met &quot;Confiance&quot; in 1800, were less fortunate.

U.S. and British privateers also actively raided each other&#x27;s shipping during the War of 1812.

==American Civil War==
During the American Civil War, the Confederate Navy operated a fleet of commissioned Confederate States Navy commerce raiders. These differed from privateers as they were state-owned ships with orders to destroy enemy commerce rather than privately owned ships with letters of marque. 

==Steel navies==
By the 1880s, the navies of Europe began to deploy warships made of iron and steel. The natural evolution that followed was the installation of more powerful guns to penetrate such warships, followed by specialized armor plating, followed by larger guns and the development of effective torpedoes (followed by armored belts below the waterline to protect against them). This &quot;arms spiral&quot; (which included the development of high explosive and armor-piercing shells) shifted focus from capture of &quot;prizes&quot; (that meant financial gain for captain and crew of the responsible vessel, and their government, when the prize and her cargo were auctioned) to destruction of enemy warships.

First seen at the Sinope in 1853, the change was little appreciated until 1905, when at Tsushima seven pre-dreadnoughts were sent to the bottom, and the only prizes were those that had voluntarily surrendered.

==World War I==
World War I saw Germany conducting a commerce war (&quot;Handelskrieg&quot;) against Britain and her allies, principally with U-boats, but also with merchant raiders and light cruisers, and even occasionally with naval airships.

==World War II==
During World War II, the Battle of the Atlantic saw Nazi Germany conducting commerce raiding against Britain and its allies, again using U-boats, auxiliary cruisers, and small groups of cruisers and battleships (surface raiders). The goal was to wage a tonnage war against the British Empire, destroying merchant shipping (and its cargoes) faster than they could be replaced, ultimately strangling the island nation by cutting off supplies it was inevitably dependent upon.

Limitations set by the Treaty of Versailles meant Germany had been unable to build a large battle fleet between the World Wars as she had in the time leading up to the World War I; instead, she chose to covertly develop her U-boat fleet. Submarines were cheaper and quicker to build than capital ships. This meant Germany was not able to fight battles between fleets, and relied on commerce raiding instead. The extreme early success of &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; U-boat wolfpacks led to the Allied development of an extensive and naval resource-straining convoy system.

In addition to U-boats Germany also deployed the small numbers of surface warships she possessed, such as the &quot;pocket battleships&quot;, her auxiliary cruisers, and a number of commercial vessels converted into merchant raiders, perhaps the most famous being .

During World War II, elements of the United States Navy based in Brazil conducted operations in the Atlantic against German commerce raiders and blockade runners. In the Pacific, the U.S. Navy operated against Japanese merchant shipping, as well as engaging in offensive operations against ships of the Japanese Imperial Navy. The bulk of the Japanese merchant marine was sunk by American submarines. By the end of the war, only 12% of Japan&#x27;s pre-war merchant tonnage was still afloat.

The Indian Ocean raid was a naval sortie by the Carrier Striking Task Force of the Japanese Navy from 31 March to 10 April 1942 against Allied shipping and bases in the Indian Ocean. It was an early engagement of the Pacific campaign of World War II.

The staff of the Imperial Japanese Navy decided to send some raiders to Indian Ocean waters during December 12, 1941 – July 12, 1942. The Germans had already been operating in the area and conducted mutual aid with Japanese submarines, in the form of re-supply and military intelligence. The Indian Ocean was the largest operating area involving direct contact between the two Axis partners, in which their primary objective was to keep pressure on the shipping lanes. The Japanese Navy participated in some commerce raiding, but concentrated its efforts toward a &quot;decisive battle&quot; in the Pacific, which never took place.

<doc id="825017" wikidata="Q440571" url="?curid=825017" title="Shōichi Nakagawa">
<text>was a Japanese conservative politician in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), who served as Minister of Finance from 24 September 2008 to 17 February 2009. He previously held the posts of Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry and Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in the cabinet of Junichiro Koizumi. He was regarded as one of Japan&#x27;s most attractive public figures. On 4 October 2009, he was found dead in his Tokyo apartment. The cause of his death is yet to be determined; although no suicide note was found, there was also no indication of foul play.

==Early life and education==
Nakagawa was born in Tokyo on 19 July 1953 and attended Azabu High School, graduated from the law faculty of the University of Tokyo and entered the Industrial Bank of Japan in 1978. His father, Ichiro Nakagawa, was a prominent Hokkaidō politician who committed suicide in 1983. The younger Nakagawa was elected to the Japanese House of Representatives in the same year.

==Political career==
In 1998, Nakagawa became Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries under Prime Minister Keizō Obuchi, and in 2003, he became Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry in the cabinet of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. He served as Agriculture Minister from October 2005 to September 2006, when incoming prime minister Shinzō Abe appointed Nakagawa as chairman of the Policy Research Council of the LDP.

In December 2006, Kyodo News Agency quoted Nakagawa as having said the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were &quot;truly unforgivable on humanitarian grounds&quot; and reported the politician&#x27;s concerns over the possession of nuclear weapons by North Korea.

Nakagawa&#x27;s views were close to those of Abe. In particular, both support nationalism in history education, a hard-line stance regarding North Korea and constitutional amendments. Abe has made efforts to relink ties with neighbouring China, while Nakagawa officially voiced his concern over the country&#x27;s growing military expenditure, claiming that, were the situation in Taiwan to deteriorate, Japan would become, by 2020, a Chinese colony. Despite the fact that most of mainstream conservative LDP politicians are usually known for their persistent pro-Americanism, Nakagawa was especially known for his pro-Taiwanism in Japan.

On 6 January 2007, in an interview with a reporter from the British newspaper &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Nakagawa stated &quot;Women have their proper place: they should be womanly ... They have their own abilities and these should be fully exercised, for example in flower arranging, sewing, or cooking. It&#x27;s not a matter of good or bad, but we need to accept reality that men and women are genetically different&quot;. The paper&#x27;s Editorial Information Executive could not confirm the source of this information because of the age of the article.

On 2 May 2008, Nakagawa had a discussion about market access of US beef and the Doha Round with Agriculture Secretary Ed Schafer.

In the Cabinet of Prime Minister Taro Aso, appointed on 24 September 2008, Nakagawa was appointed as Minister of Finance and Minister of State in charge of Financial Services. He was defeated in his constituency in the 2009 general election.

==Contribution to IMF==
On 10 October 2008, at G7 Nakagawa proposed in Washington a new emergency International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan program to help emerging and small economies such as Iceland, Brazil, Ukraine and Pakistan. The total size of the loans could be about US$200 billion (about 20 trillion yen) In some newly emerging economies and small and medium European countries, total assets in domestic financial institutions far exceed the national gross domestic products and those governments might be unable to raise necessary funds to help failing financial institutions through measures such as nationalisation. &quot;Nakagawa plan&quot; eased the concerns of small countries and emerging markets and reduced tension in international financial markets.

On 14 February 2009, Strauss-Kahn stated &#x27;This commitment is the single-largest supplemental financing contribution by an IMF member country ever, and it clearly demonstrates Japan&#x27;s leadership and continuing commitment to a multilateral approach to global economic and financial challenges.&#x27; Strauss-Kahn said he hoped other countries would join Japan in providing support to the 185-nation institution. Prime Minister Taro Aso told Japan was ready to lend up to $100 billion from our foreign reserves to the IMF if it finds itself with insufficient funds to help emergency economies. &quot;Nikkei Business Daily&quot; reported that selling U.S. government bonds held by Japan to provide cash to the IMF would affect U.S. bond yields so Tokyo may consider lending U.S. government bonds to the IMF as collateral for it to raise funds.

In a communiqué, G-7 ministers committed to acting jointly to support world growth and employment and strengthen the financial sector, while avoiding protectionism. The ministers met as the U.S. Senate voted in favor of a $787 billion economic stimulus plan—clearing the way for it to be signed into law by President Barack Obama. Strauss-Kahn emphasized &quot;The biggest concrete result of this summit is the loan by the Japanese... I want to thank the Japanese for having led the way... Now I will continue with the objective of doubling the (IMF) resources,&quot; he told reporters. &quot;It is the largest loan ever made in the history of humanity.&quot; Loans were made to a number of economies affected by the crisis, including Belarus, Hungary, Iceland, Latvia, Pakistan, Serbia, and Ukraine. It announced a precautionary loan for El Salvador last month and an IMF team has also been in negotiations with Turkey.

==Stance on the comfort women issue==

Affiliated to the openly revisionist organization Nippon Kaigi, Nakagawa expressed in July 1998 his skepticism about the fact that many schools in Japan taught about forced &quot;comfort women&quot; by the Japanese military during the World War II in history textbooks claiming that there was no evidence that the Japanese government and military were directory involved in recruiting or forcing women to work in the brothels.

:&quot;We admit that there were comfort women who traveled with the military,&quot; Nakagawa said. &quot;Poverty and other issues were behind this development, which is quite tragic and sad. It&#x27;s a sad fact that similar phenomena existed in other parts of the world, including the U.S.&quot;

Nakagawa had an opposing position to Yōhei Kōno&#x27;s statement that the Japanese government was directly involved in recruiting and forcing &quot;comfort women&quot; to work in the brothels. He stated in a radio program that he wouldn&#x27;t acknowledge Kōno&#x27;s statement as long as the current Japanese government concealed what he thought to be the truth. He added that Kōno had a masochistic view of history and that other countries would even fake their pride for their own countries. He suggested the government amend or withdraw Kōno&#x27;s statement about &quot;comfort women&quot; immediately.

==Alcohol controversy==
Nakagawa had been known for his extremely heavy drinking since a young age. A Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (Japan) bureaucrat, who was a fellow of Nakagawa&#x27;s, witnessed Nakagawa drunk frequently, especially before hosting big political conferences.

During the G7 meeting of finance ministers in Rome on 14 February 2009, where he signed an agreement to lend an extra $100 billion to the IMF that was described as the &quot;largest loan ever made in the history of humanity&quot;, Nakagawa was seen to be slurring his words. Nakagawa claimed that his drowsiness and slurred speech were the result of taking too much cold medicine before the meeting. In &quot;Who Governs The World&quot;, a book published in February 2010 by Takahiko Soejima, he suggest there were more than three people involved in this incident.
Despite calls for his resignation by opposition parties at the time, Nakagawa did not immediately resign; Prime Minister Taro Aso supported him and called for him to continue his duties as Finance Minister. However, on 17 February, Nakagawa announced that he had chosen to resign, and his resignation was accepted by Prime Minister Aso that evening.

==Death==
Shōichi Nakagawa died on 3 October 2009, aged 56 at his home in Tokyo. Japanese media reports said his body was found face down on the bed by his wife, with no external injuries. She alerted ambulance services at approximately 8:30 am. His death had taken place at least eight hours previously. An investigation was done to determine the cause of death. An autopsy was planned to determine the cause of death. A will has not been located. Taro Aso, the former Japanese Prime Minister, was rendered speechless by the news: &quot;I am so deeply shocked that I have no words.&quot; Hirohisa Fujii, his successor as Finance Minister, also commented: &quot;I want to express my heartfelt condolences. He was doing a fine job as a finance minister, so it is regrettable.&quot; &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; said his death had &quot;sent a shock wave throughout the nation.&quot;

After his death, his widow Yūko Nakagawa ran for his old seat in the 2012 election, which she won and held until 2017, before being reelected via the Hokkaido proportional representation block in 2021.

<text>Mikio Aoki (, Hepburn: ; 8 June 1934 – 11 June 2023) was a Japanese politician who served as the Chief Cabinet Secretary from 1999 to 2000, and was briefly acting prime minister following Keizō Obuchi&#x27;s coma. A member of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), he also served as the Chairman of the LDP in the House of Councillors.

==Early life and career==
Mikio Aoki was born on 8 June 1934, in Taisha in Shimane Prefecture, to a family of prosperous fishermen. After graduating from Shimane Prefectural Taisha High School, Aoki enrolled at Waseda University. He joined the Oratorical Society and became its secretary. He befriended Yoshiro Mori who was also in the Oratorical Society.

In the 1958 Japanese general election, Aoki volunteered for Noboru Takeshita, a Waseda alumni who was running to represent Shimane for the Liberal Democratic Party. When Takeshita was elected, Aoki dropped out of university to serve as his secretary.

Aoki was elected to the Shimane Prefectural Assembly in 1961. He was vice chairman from 1983 to 1984. Upon Takeshita&#x27;s request, Aoki ran in the 1986 House of Councillors election and was elected.

==Diet member==
Aoki joined the Keiseikai formed by Takeshita in 1987. Aoki was parliamentary secretary for the Ministry of Finance from 1991 to 1992 and chairman of the House of Councillors Committee on Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries from 1994 to 1995.

Following the 1998 House of Councillors election, Obuchi, who was then head of the Keiseikai, became Prime Minister and Aoki became Secretary-General for the LDP in the House of Councillors. The reshuffle in December of the following year made Aoki Chief Cabinet Secretary and Director-General of the Okinawa Development Agency.

===Acting prime minister===
Obuchi suffered a stroke in April 2000 and fell into a coma. Aoki took over as acting prime minister. Once it became clear Obuchi would not recover, Aoki met with the principal officers of the LDP at the time: Yoshiro Mori, Hiromu Nonaka, Shizuka Kamei and Masakuni Murakami. The five men wanted to ensure a swift succession and agreed to designate Mori as the next LDP President. This decision was endorsed by the party convention and Mori became prime minister on 5 April 2000.

Mori initially retained the entire Obuchi cabinet, including Aoki, but after the reshuffle in December, he returned to his post as Secretary-General for the LDP in the House of Councillors. Takeshita died in June 2000.

===Don of the House of Councillors===
The old Keiseikai, which had been renamed the Heisei Kenkyukai, was then led by former Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. Aoki and Hiromu Nonaka were prominent leaders in the faction at this time. When Junichiro Koizumi succeeded Mori as Prime Minister, Nonaka took a confrontational stance while Aoki was cooperative. In the 2003 LDP leadership election, Hiromu Nonaka endorsed Takao Fujii while Aoki supported the re-election of Koizumi. The votes of the faction were split and Koizumi was reelected.

After the 2004 House of Councillors election, Aoki was promoted from Secretary-General to chairman for the LDP in the House of Councillors. It was said that Koizumi trusted him with all matters regarding the House of Councillors, including nominating cabinet ministers from the house. Aoki began to be called the &quot;Don of the House of Councillors.&quot; Aoki resigned as chairman to take responsibility for the unsuccessful 2007 House of Councillors election.

Aoki intended to run for another term in the 2010 House of Councillors election. However, he suffered a mild stroke and was swiftly replaced as a candidate by his son Kazuhiko.

==Retirement==
Even in retirement, he remained influential, especially over the House and Councillors and the Heisei Kenkyukai. In the 2018 LDP leadership election he endorsed Shigeru Ishiba against the incumbent Shinzo Abe, and requested his old faction to do the same. However, Toshimitsu Motegi and Katsunobu Kato rallied faction members in support of Abe, who was successful.

After Fumio Kishida became Prime Minister, Aoki dined with him several times along with former Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori. They were reportedly consulted on personnel matters.

Aoki died on 11 June 2023, just three days after his 89th birthday.

<text>AARNet (Australian Academic and Research Network) provides Internet services to the Australian education and research communities and their research partners.

AARNet built the Internet in Australia. In 1995, the Australian Vice-Chancellors&#x27; Committee (AVCC) transferred AARNet1 as a going concern to Telstra who then operated it as the initial Telstra Internet. Today, AARNet is Australia&#x27;s National research and education network (NREN). It forms the Australian component of the global advanced research and education Internet network.

AARNet Pty Ltd, which owns and operates the AARNet, is a not-for-profit company limited by shares. The shareholders are 38 Australian universities and the Australian CSIRO. AARNet&#x27;s services in addition to Internet connectivity include Eduroam, voice, video and data storage services and a content mirror.

==History==

AARNet was initially built between the University of Melbourne in Melbourne, where the international Internet feed initially landed, and university and CSIRO facilities in all Australian state capital cities and the Australian National University in Canberra. AARNet was formed in 1989 by the Australian Vice-Chancellors&#x27; Committee (AVCC).

In 1989, Kevin Robert Elz established the first permanent Internet feed to Australia, at the University of Melbourne. Until this time, researchers within Australia had limited access to the ARPANET, due to the high expense of providing communications between Australia and the United States. The national network infrastructure generally consisted of groups of hosts connected throughout the country exchanging mail and files on a periodic schedule using the SUNIII software and protocols, with several international dial-up links around the country exchanging this information where required.

AARNet was initially built as a multi-protocol network, comprising Internet Protocol (IP) as well as DECnet and X.25 so as to accommodate pre-existing ACSnet and SPEARnet systems then in current use. With the rapid subsequent growth in popularity of the Internet, AARNet soon evolved into an IP-only network. In 1988, there were a number of popular network protocols, such as IBM&#x27;s SNA and the CCITT&#x27;s X.25, and the ARPANET&#x27;s IP protocol was only beginning to become favoured. Australian National University staff members Geoff Huston and Peter Elford were seconded by the AVCC in 1989 and tasked with technical management and build of the new network.

AARNet introduced its &#x27;value added reseller&#x27; program to allow Internet service providers (ISPs) to use its network, the first being Connect.com.au in May 1994. AARNet gradually became a wholesale backbone ISP, serving over 300 smaller ISPs by June 1995. At that point, about 20% of total AARNet traffic was from these other users, and AVCC decided to sell the AARNet commercial assets to Telstra, who currently operates it under the name Telstra Internet.

In early 1997, AARNet2 went into service, a network that used ATM links and Internet services under a contract with Cable &amp; Wireless Optus (CWO), now Optus. AARNet became a separate company from the AVCC in 1999.

In 2001 AARNet deployed its own international capacity by acquiring 310 Mbit/s of capacity from Sydney via Hawaii to Seattle. As of 2006, the current network is known as AARNet3, and the backbone uses a dark fibre network provided by Nextgen Networks.

==Chronology==

Major milestones in the development of AARNet include:

===Pre-AARNet – pre-internet===
*1963: CSIRONET established by the CSIRO&#x27;s Division of Computing Research
*1976: CSIRONET had grown to connect more than 50 computers spanning from Townsville to Hobart to Perth via a combination of dial-up and low speed leased line connections
*1979: ACSnet formed – used MHSnet to transfer files, email and newsgroups between computers in Australian universities and to the United States via low speed dialup connections
*1986: South Pacific Education and Research Network (SPEARnet) formed – used X.25-based Coloured Book protocols to interconnect 22 Australian and New Zealand universities
*1989: Internet brought to Australia via a NASA-subsidized 56 kbit/s dedicated satellite circuit between the University of Melbourne and the University of Hawaii

===The early years – building the Internet in Australia===
*1989: AARNet established by the Australian Vice-Chancellors&#x27; Committee
*1990: AARNet national backbone network built from Brisbane to Perth, each link initially at 48 kbit/s capacity, starring from a hub at the international Internet landing point at the University of Melbourne. AARNet national network was initially built as a multi-protocol layer 3 network, comprising Internet Protocol (IP) as well as DECnet and X.25 so as to accommodate the pre-existing ACSnet and SPEARnet networks. Connections to around 40 universities and CSIRO sites commissioned.
*1990–92: International capacity increased in several rapid increments from 56 kbit/s to 1.5 Mbit/s, at an average 6 month doubling rate. In 1991, the national backbone links were upgraded to 2 Mbit/s. By 1992, AARNet connected 40,000 computers.
*1991: &#x27;Affiliate membership&#x27; programme and Acceptable use policy (AUP) established for government and research groups to join the network. By the end of 1993, AARNet provided services to over 300 government agencies and companies, including early Australian Internet Service Providers (ISPs) Connect.com.au, Pegasus Networks and Internode.
*1993: Local links to major customer sites progressively upgraded from low capacity carrier leased lines to microwave links for more capacity, typically 10 Mbit/s, at lower costs
*1994: &#x27;Value-Added Reseller&#x27; programme established and AARNet&#x27;s AUP broadened to accommodate growing demand for Internet access from a wider range of users, including ISPs OzEmail and iiNet
*1995: The AVCC sold the then entire Australian Internet (AARNet1) as a going concern to Telstra, including staff, infrastructure (routers, etc.), intellectual property and the entire commercial customer base. Telstra then took over operating AARNet1 as its initial Telstra Internet.
*1996: AARNet2 tender awarded to Optus, accelerating the build of Optus&#x27; Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and Internet infrastructure, capabilities and services
*1997: AARNet2 ATM-based national network commissioned

===Building the present AARNet===
*1998: AARNet Mirror site commissioned
*1998: AARNet Pty Ltd established as a separate company
*1999: Ownership of AARNet Pty Ltd transferred from the AVCC to Australia&#x27;s universities and CSIRO
*1999: AARNet&#x27;s VoIP service commissioned
*2000: AARNet telecommunications carrier license granted by Australian Communications Authority
*2001: AARNet became the first research and education network to operate its own trans-oceanic optical-fibre capacity, initially comprising dual 155 Mbit/s links to Canada&#x27;s CANARIE network
*2002: GrangeNet built as a separate demonstration next generation network, through which various in the sector obtained their first exposure to then next generation gigabit Ethernet and long-haul optical fibre transmission systems. Later, when user institutions had operational need to interconnect their AARNet and GrangeNet services they also gained experience with the complexities of asymmetric routing.
*2003: AARNet negotiated purchase from Southern Cross Cable of multi-gigabit &#x27;SXTransPORT&#x27; trans-Pacific links via diverse paths
*2003: AARNet buys into Nextgen Networks ensuring its survival as an independent long-haul optical-fibre infrastructure provider
*2004: Dual 10 Gbit/s and dual 622 Mbit/s SXTransPORT trans-Pacific links commissioned
*2006: AARNet3 national network commissioned

===Up to the present===
*2007: Layer 1 point-to-point 1 Gbit/s transmission services (&#x27;EN4R&#x27;) introduced for high-end research data transfer applications between points reached by the AARNet3 national network
*2008: Direct link to Asia upgraded to 1 Gbit/s via diverse routes between Perth and Singapore, reducing latency (delay) to Asia, cf much commercial Internet traffic between Australia and Asia still traverses the Pacific Ocean twice via the USA.
*2011: High-capacity wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) link built from Perth via Geraldton to the Australian site of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory, and the various telescope facilities at the MRO in particular the initial Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope array at the site.
*2011: Second optical fibre path to Asia commissioned, from Sydney to Singapore via Guam, increasing AARNet&#x27;s direct capacity to Asia to 1.2 Gbit/s
*2012: International capacity increased to a total of 90 Gbit/s trans-Pacific plus a further 3.1 Gbit/s in two diverse routes to Asia
*2013: AARNet4 announced, which is upgrading the AARNet WDM national network capacity to multiple parallel 100 Gbit/s channels, ultimately 80 channels (total 8 Tbit/s).

==AARNet generations==

AARNet1 (1989–1997): Australia&#x27;s first Internet:
* AARNet-operated layer 3 routers; one point of presence (PoP) per capital city
* national backbone: carrier-provided (Telstra) inter-PoP transmission capacity
* carrier-provided trans-Pacific transmission capacity
* AARNet1 sold to Telstra in 1995

AARNet2 (1997–2006): Fostered the building of Optus&#x27; ATM and Optus&#x27; Internet networks:
* AARNet-operated layer 3 routers; one PoP per capital city
* national backbone: carrier-provided (Optus) inter-PoP ATM transmission capacity
* carrier-provided trans-Pacific transmission capacity

AARNet3 (2006–2013): The AARNet optical network:
* AARNet-operated layer 3 routers; two physically diverse PoPs in each capital city
* national backbone: AARNet-operated optical fibre transmission capacity
* AARNet-operated international fibre transmission capacity
* Also delivers enduser Layer 1 optical transmission and Layer 2 VLAN switching services

AARNet4 (2013–present): The AARNet optical network grows:
* entirely AARNet-operated
* national optical backbone: optical fibre transmission capacity ultimately 80 wavelengths each at 100 Gbit/s (total 8 Tbit/s)
* national IP network: 100 Gbit/s layer 3 routed network via diverse paths
* international connectivity: 240 Gbit/s of optical fibre transmission capacity, via six network interconnect points in USA and one in Singapore
* enduser services: layer 1 point-to-point optical transmission; layer 2 metro-Ethernet VLAN; layer 2 and layer 3 MPLS-based VPN services; high performance layer 3 routed access to global research and education (R&amp;E) networks and the public Internet

==AARNet Pty Ltd==
AARNet was established in 1989 originally as an activity under the auspices of the Australian Vice-Chancellors&#x27; Committee (AVCC).

AARNet was formed into a separate company on 22 December 1998.
AARNet Pty Ltd, ACN 084540518, ABN 54 084 540 518, is a not-for-profit company limited by shares.
The shareholders are 38 of Australia&#x27;s universities and the Australian CSIRO.

AARNet Pty Ltd became a licensed telecommunications carrier (Telco) under the Australian Telecommunications Act on 27 November 2000, becoming Australian carrier number 61.

==National network==

The AARNet4 national network comprises high capacity optical fibre transmission paths between switching centres in major cities from Cairns to Perth as well as branch lines to Darwin, Hobart and several other locations. Because optical fibre repair times are long, the backbone network follows two physically diverse paths. As at late 2013, capacity on each leg of the routed network was between 10 and 100 gigabit per second (Gbit/s). Starting with only 48 kbit/s national backbone capacity in 1990, this reflects a similarly rapid exponential growth rate as for AARNet&#x27;s international capacity.

The Network peers with external content providers and ISPs to increase performance and availability of the network. The organisation has a selective peering policy for peering with other providers. This policy applies to all requests for settlement-free interconnection with AARNet, either via dedicated connections or traffic via public internet exchanges.

AARNet provides the Internet to several million end-user devices at Australian universities, CSIRO, various other research and educational institutions, and some hospitals. Customer site connections are mostly at 1 to 10 Gbit/s rates, with most end-user Ethernet services at 1 Gbit/s, and Eduroam services at available Wi-Fi performance levels.

AARNet&#x27;s layer 3 services are usually delivered at the AARNet PoP sites. With the introduction of the AARNet3 optical fibre network (i.e. from 2006 onwards) AARNet progressively developed capability to extend services to customer sites in some locations, as well as providing layer 1 and layer 2 inter-campus connections in those areas. Prior to that, and at other locations, it is end-customer institutions&#x27; responsibility to extend services to site and to provision their own inter-campus network links. These are either operated directly by AARNet such as in Queensland or provided by companion networks such as SABRENet in South Australia and VERNet in Victoria.

Summary of AARNet national IP network performance levels as at 2013:
* National backbone links: mostly 10 to 100 Gbit/s
* Customer site connections: mostly 1 to 10 Gbit/s
* End-user services: mostly 1 Gbit/s Ethernet and available Wi-Fi rates
* Continues to sustain traffic growth rates of 50% per annum year on year over the preceding decade

==International connectivity==

AARNet provides the Australian component of the global advanced Research and Education Internet network. AARNet has high capacity interconnections with North American (Internet2),
European (GÉANT) and Asian (TEIN3) components of the global network.

As at late 2014, AARNet operated a total capacity of 120 Gbit/s to North America and a further 5 Gbit/s to Asia. This equates to a 2.2 million-fold increase over AARNet&#x27;s initial trans-Pacific capacity of 56 kbit/s in 1990 and represents an average doubling time of aggregate international capacity of only 14 months over the entire history of AARNet (cf. Moore&#x27;s Law).

In addition to providing high capacity Internet transmission and routing services and a comprehensive range of core Internet services including BGP, DNS, NTP and IPv6, AARNet also provides a variety of higher-layer network services including:
* Eduroam global federated authentication service, most often appearing as Eduroam Wi-Fi services on-campus and at associated locations
* VoIP IP telephony services
* AUCX unified voice and video communications exchange
* Cloud services including CloudStor file storage service
* AARNet mirror site to reduce load on international links due to repeated downloads of the same material.
To further optimise network traffic loads, AARNet operates high capacity peering links with various major content providers including the Australian ABC, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon.

==Supporting big science==

Throughout their life, a major driver for the very high capacities of advanced Research and Education Internet networks including AARNet has been to meet the needs of data-intensive research across a wide range of research disciplines in both the sciences and the humanities. For example, to interconnect major research instruments such as synchrotrons and telescopes in remote locations to high performance computer systems and researchers around the world, such as astronomers in Europe viewing the southern sky using telescopes in Australia or high resolution realtime video links between remote locations.

Most recently, AARNet has built a 100 Gbit/s WDM optical fibre transmission system from Perth to Geraldton and on to the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory (MRO) in Western Australia in support of Australia&#x27;s component of the international Square Kilometre Array project and the initial ASKAP telescope array at the MRO.

<text>The Seattle Sun was a free, monthly neighborhood newspaper in Seattle, Washington. Founded in 1997 by Clayton and Susan Brehme Park as the Jet City Maven, its first issue came out in March of that year. The next issue came out in May, and beginning in July, the paper went monthly. It originally covered only that part of Seattle north of N.E. 65th Street and east of Aurora Avenue N., but in September 1998 it was expanded to include all of the city north of the Lake Washington Ship Canal.

In January 2002 the &quot;Jet City Maven&quot; was renamed &quot;The Seattle Sun&quot;. The paper circulated 25,000 copies monthly with 5,000 copies direct mailed and featured neighborhood news, opinion, business, education, entertainment, home and garden, and health.

In August 2004, Wallis Bolz of Town Crier Publishing began operating the newspaper under a letter of intent to purchase it from Susan and Clayton Park. In January 2005, the &quot;Seattle Sun&quot; was officially sold to Town Crier.

With the May 18–31, 2005, issue, the &quot;Sun&quot; merged with the &quot;Seattle Star&quot; to form the &quot;Seattle Sun and Star&quot;.

In July 2005, citing a lack of advertising dollars, owner Wallis Bolz closed the newspaper. Bolz explained in an e-mail to the &quot;Beacon Hill News &amp; South District Journal&quot; published July 27, 2005: &quot;Faced with a choice of gutting the newspaper or closing the doors, we closed the doors.&quot;

<text>The second USS &quot;Experiment&quot; was a schooner in the United States Navy during the 1830s and 1840s.

&quot;Experiment&quot; was built in 1831 by the Washington Navy Yard; and sailed for tests in Chesapeake Bay in April 1832, Lieutenant William Mervine in command.

Until the middle of 1833, &quot;Experiment&quot; cruised the Atlantic coast between Boston, Massachusetts, and Charleston, South Carolina. After repairs at Norfolk, she sailed for the West Indies, returning to New York in June 1835. During the remaining three years of her cruising service, she was often used for surveying. From 1839 to 1848, when she was sold, she was in commission as a receiving ship at Philadelphia.

Kōno was born on 15 January 1937, in Hiratsuka, Kanagawa, the eldest son of politician Ichirō Kōno. His father served as deputy prime minister and was in charge of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. His younger uncle Kenzō Kōno served as the president of the House of Councillors from 1971 to 1977.

After graduating from Waseda University Senior High School, he studied Economics at Waseda University. Upon graduation, Kōno worked with the Marubeni company. In 1967, Kono&#x27;s political career began due to the death of his father.

== Political career ==

He was Deputy Prime Minister of Japan from 1994 to 1995 which he had strong influence in the Murayama Cabinet. He was Minister of Foreign Affairs under Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama and Yoshirō Mori (1993-1995, 1999-2001). He is a member of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). He was once President of the LDP from 1993 to 1995, and to date is one of two LDP leaders, along with Sadakazu Tanigaki, to have never served as Prime Minister of Japan. As he is one of the pro-China faction of the LDP, he came under pressure domestically in the spring of 2005 when anti-Japanese movements in China became intense due to then Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visited the Yasukuni Shrine which he opposed the visit to.

Kōno is known for his acknowledgement of comfort women. During his tenure as Chief Cabinet Secretary, in a speech titled the official statement he made in 1993, made after historian Yoshiaki Yoshimi announced he had discovered in the Defense Agency library in Tokyo documentary evidence that the Imperial Japanese Army established and ran comfort stations, he admitted that the Japanese Imperial Army had been involved, directly and indirectly, in the establishment of comfort stations, and that coercion had been used in the recruitment and retention of the women. His subsequent call for historical research and education aimed at remembering the issue became the basis for addressing the subject of forced prostitution in school history textbooks.

<doc id="825077" wikidata="Q3543845" url="?curid=825077" title="Apache Kid (comics)">
<text>The Apache Kid (Alan Krandal) is a fictional Old West character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character has been mostly seen in stories from Marvel&#x27;s 1950s precursor, Atlas Comics. This character was named after, but is unrelated to, the real-life Native American man known as The Apache Kid (Haskay-bay-nay-natyl).

==Publication history==
The Apache Kid (Alan Krandal) debuted as the cover feature, drawn by a young John Buscema, of &quot;Two-Gun Western&quot; #5 (cover-dated Nov. 1950). The writer co-creator is unknown. He received his own title the following month, premiering as &quot;The Apache Kid&quot;  #53 (Dec. 1950, picking up the numbering from &quot;Reno Browne, Hollywood&#x27;s Greatest Cowgirl&quot;) and then running as &quot;Apache Kid&quot;  #2-19 (Feb. 1951 - Jan. 1952; Dec. 1954 - April 1956).

Stories also ran in the omnibus titles &quot;Two-Gun Western&quot;  #5-9 (Nov. 1950 - Aug. 1951) and &quot;Wild Western&quot;  #15-22 (April 1951 - June 1952). After that initial Buscema story and at least two by Joe Maneely (who would also do many of the later covers), the bulk of the book&#x27;s run would be penciled and inked by future Silver Age &quot;X-Men&quot; artist Werner Roth.

After &quot;The Apache Kid&quot; ended with #19 (April 1956), its numbering continued as the anthology series &quot;Western Gunfighters&quot;, where the character did not appear.

Apache Kid reprints, however, did appear in Marvel&#x27;s 1970s omnibus series also titled &quot;Western Gunfighters&quot;. The Kid shared its pages with new Ghost Rider (also known as Phantom Rider) stories, as well as anthological and Western-hero reprints of a changing lineup that included Atlas&#x27; Black Rider (here renamed Black Mask), the Western Kid, Wyatt Earp, and later Kid Colt. Apache Kid reprints ran from  #2-33, the final issue (Oct. 1970 - Nov. 1975).

==Other versions==
The character returned in &quot;Apache Skies&quot; (2002), a four-issue miniseries starring the Rawhide Kid and two persons called the Apache Kid: Dazii Aloysius Kare, and his wife, Rosa. This was a sequel to the miniseries &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot; (2000), which specifically retconned that the past Marvel Western stories of the 50s were dime novel fictions of the characters&#x27; actual lives.

Unrelated characters called the Apache Kid appeared in Fox Comics&#x27; &quot;Western Outlaws&quot;  #21 (May 1949), and Youthful Comics&#x27; &quot;Indian Fighter&quot;  #5 (Jan. 1952).

==Fictional character biography==
Caucasian child Alan Krandal was raised by Apache chief Red Hawk and his wife after being orphaned. When grown, he took on a &quot;civilian&quot; identity as cowboy Aloysius Kare, changing to his warpaint outfit to fight outlaws both white and Native American, and generally protect both groups of people. Captain Bill Gregory of the nearby fort was his &quot;white brother&quot; who also respected the elder Red Hawk&#x27;s counsel. Krandal had an on-off relationshipwith the Apache maiden White Swan, who loved the Apache Kid and despised Krandal. Unlike many other Western comics of the 1950s, &quot;Apache Kid&quot; generally presented the indigenous Americans in the same light as Caucasians, and made distinctions among the various tribes.

In Apache Skies, it was retconned that Dazii Aloysius Kare was a mixed ancestry man, part caucasian and part apache. He also married another mixed-blood woman called Rosa, who continued his legacy when he was killed by a corrupt businessman.

<doc id="825082" wikidata="Q513317" url="?curid=825082" title="Katsuya Okada">
<text>is a Japanese politician who was Deputy Prime Minister of Japan from January to December 2012. A member of the House of Representatives of Japan, he was the President of the Democratic Party, and previously of the Democratic Party of Japan. He also served as Secretary-General of the DPJ three times. During the DPJ&#x27;s period in government he was Foreign Minister of Japan.

In 2016, he remained as leader when the Democratic Party of Japan merged with the Japan Innovation Party to become the Democratic Party.

==Early life and education==
Okada was born on 14 July 1953. He is the second son of Takuya Okada, who is a co-founder of AEON Group. His elder brother, Motoya Okada, is the President and CEO of AEON Group. He has a younger brother and a half-sister. A native of Yokkaichi, Mie, Okada graduated from the University of Tokyo with a degree in law, and entered the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. He also did a short course at Weatherhead Center for International Affairs in Harvard University.

== Political career ==

Okada ran for the House of Representatives at the 1990 general election from LDP, representing Mie Prefecture&#x27;s third district, and later joined the Takeshita faction of the Liberal Democratic Party, and followed faction leaders Tsutomu Hata and Ichirō Ozawa to join the Japan Renewal Party in 1993. Through a series of splits and mergers, Okada then became a member of the New Frontier Party, Sun Party, and Minseito, finally entering the DPJ upon its merger with Minseito in 1998.

He became president of the DPJ on 18 May 2004, and led the DPJ to one of its largest electoral victories in history during the 2004 House of Councillors election. However, he resigned after his party suffered dramatic losses in the September 2005 general election.

Okada ran for the presidency in 2009 but lost to Yukio Hatoyama. Following the success of the DPJ in the 2009 general election, Hatoyama selected Okada to be the foreign minister.

Okada was regarded as a possible successor of Hatoyama when Hatoyama announced his resignation as Prime Minister and DPJ leader in June 2010, but Okada gave his support to Finance Minister Naoto Kan, who quickly emerged as the likely successor to Hatoyama. Ichirō Ozawa, however, whose resignation had also been reported announced by Hatoyama, was still supporting another less well known possible successor, Shinji Tarutoko, 50, a legislator who leads the environmental policy committee in the lower house of Parliament, a day before the DPJ leadership elections. After being selected as the new prime minister, Kan reaffirmed Okada as foreign minister.

As foreign minister, Okada was one of the chief participants in negotiations with the United States (US) over the relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma on Okinawa. The Foreign Ministry under Okada also confirmed the existence of a long-rumored secret pact between Japan and US which had allowed the US military to carry nuclear weapons into Japanese territory in contravention of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan. The previous administration under the LDP had denied that such a pact existed.

In a September 2010 cabinet reshuffle, Okada was moved from foreign minister to secretary general of the DPJ. Okada, who is viewed as an intraparty ally of Prime Minister Naoto Kan, is believed to have been given the role of secretary general in order to secure Kan&#x27;s influence in the governing party, as well as to help force the passage of government bills in parliament.

Okada ran in the DPJ leadership election held in January 2015 after former president Banri Kaieda resigned after losing his seat. Okada won and returned as DPJ leader after a period of nine years.

In 2015, there were allegations made against Okada, saying that he had accepted 240,000 yen ($2,000) in donations from Nisshin Seifun Group Inc. in 2011 and 2012.

In 2016, he remained as leader when the Democratic Party of Japan merged with the Japan Innovation Party to become the Democratic Party. Following the party&#x27;s defeat at the House of Councillors election in July, he announced that he would not seek re-election as leader at the party&#x27;s annual meeting in September.

In 2022, Okada was appointed to be the secretary general of the CDP, replacing Chinami Nishimura. Okada currently holds the secretary general position to this day.

He was many times interviewed by Sekai Nippo, the official newspaper of the Unification Church, an anti-communism new religion.
He does not support marriage equality.

==Other interests==
Okada is said to be an avid collector of frog knick knacks, which decorate his office.

A native of Tokyo, Fujii was born on 24 June 1932. He graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1955 with a law degree. He began his career as a bureaucrat in the Ministry of Finance, which gave him authority on finance and tax system issues later in his legislative career. Toward the end of his time at the ministry, he served as an assistant to Chief Cabinet Secretaries Susumu Nikaido and Noboru Takeshita.

He was elected to the House of Councillors for the first time in the 1977 election as a member of the Liberal Democratic Party. After serving two terms, he declined to run in 1986 in order to plan a run for the House of Representatives, and won a seat representing Kanagawa Prefecture in the 1990 general election.

In 1993 he left the LDP and joined the formation of the Japan Renewal Party, which later became part of the DPJ. He served as Minister of Finance in the cabinets of Morihiro Hosokawa and Tsutomu Hata, and did not substantially change the previous LDP government&#x27;s financial policy objectives.

Fujii was a member of Ichiro Ozawa&#x27;s Liberal Party during the late 1990s, and served as its secretary-general and headed its financial committee while it was in a coalition government with the LDP. Fujii historically supported Ozawa in opposing any increase in the consumption tax.

Fujii lost his seat in the 2005 general election and planned to retire from politics. However, he returned to the Diet in 2007 with retroactive effect after two incumbent representatives resigned. In the run-up to the 2009 general election, he led a campaign to stop Ozawa from becoming the president and prime ministerial candidate of the DPJ. He initially intended to retire from the Diet following the election, and allowed another DPJ candidate to run for his district, but withdrew his resignation at the request of Yukio Hatoyama shortly before candidate lists were finalized. The DPJ won the election in a landslide, and Fujii maintained a seat in the House despite being ranked only 35th on the party&#x27;s candidate list.

=== DPJ government (2009–2012) ===
Fujii was named minister of finance after the election of Hatoyama as Prime Minister in September 2009. Shortly following his appointment, Fujii publicly opposed intervention to weaken the Japanese yen for the benefit of Japanese exporters, saying that other countries would be inclined to do the same thing. He later clarified that he did not favor a strong yen and was not pleased with its recent appreciation in value. Fujii also reversed his historical position on the consumption tax, and demanded the appointment of two vice ministers, Yoshihiko Noda and Naoki Minezaki, who were in favor of raising it. Ozawa told Fujii in December 2009 that he failed to demonstrate political leadership, and persuaded Hatoyama to change the party&#x27;s campaign promise on gasoline taxes over Fujii&#x27;s objections.

Fujii abruptly announced his resignation as finance minister on 5 January 2010, and it was reluctantly accepted by Prime Minister Hatoyama a day later. Fujii had been suffering from high blood pressure and exhaustion, so he claimed that his deteriorating health forced him to resign from the high-stress position of finance minister. However, some political analysts believed that Fujii resigned due to his power struggle with Ozawa.

On 7 January 2010, Naoto Kan replaced Fujii as finance minister. Fujii served in the Kan cabinet as Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary. Noda took over the finance portfolio under the Kan government, and succeeded Kan as prime minister in 2011. Fujii remained in regular contact with Noda throughout this time, but was careful to keep a low profile in doing so. He publicly maintained his position on yen intervention, stating in 2011 that it was more important for Japan to open its markets.

He announced his retirement from politics at the age of 80, shortly prior to the 2012 general election.

== Death ==
Fujii died on 10 July 2022 at his home in Tokyo, aged 90.

<doc id="825143" wikidata="Q7761218" url="?curid=825143" title="The Robot Ate Me">
<text>The Robot Ate Me is an experimental indie rock band formed by Ryland Bouchard in 2002. The band has been through many distinct phases incorporating aspects of folk, jazz, psychedelia and avant-garde rock. Their critically acclaimed albums alternated between accessible pop and obscure musical art projects. After releasing &quot;Good World&quot; in 2006, Babysue described the band as &quot;one of the most unpredictable and obtuse underground bands around.&quot;

==Biography==
In 2002 Ryland Bouchard released &quot;They Ate Themselves&quot;, his first record as The Robot Ate Me and played his first shows in San Diego opening for notable touring acts such as Daniel Johnston, Tegan and Sara, Metric, Stars and The Blackheart Procession. &quot;Skyscraper&quot; magazine described this release as &quot;Quite possibly the year&#x27;s most arresting experimental pop record, They Ate Themselves is a dizzyingly vibrant trip through death and multi-layered dissonance&quot;.

The controversial and highly experimental &quot;On Vacation&quot; was released in 2004. Adam Gnade declared &quot;It&#x27;s not even music outside the margins. Here the margins were never there, and if they were to encroach, The Robot Ate Me would probably up and croak. &quot; Punk Planet followed suit describing the album as &quot;A hypnotic two-disc record that will score your twisted nightmares and fanciful dreams.&quot; Splendid summarized &quot;It is impossible to understand a Robot Ate Me album from a written description.&quot; The band Oh No Oh My named themselves after the song &quot;Oh No! Oh My!&quot; from &quot;On Vacation&quot;.

After the release of &quot;On Vacation&quot; in 2004, he signed with Kill Rock Stars and toured the US heavily the next few years playing close to 600 shows in the following three years playing with countless bands including The Mae Shi, Barr, The Fall, Hella, Mount Eerie, Karl Blau, The Winks, Doveman, I Need Sleep, The Gossip, Oh No! Oh My!, Okkervil River, Emperor X, and Drew Danburry. His shows relied heavily on audience participation and were known for being fairly unpredictable. As part of his shows he would sometimes be dragged across the floor by attendees, wear masks, scream loudly, have the audience play the supporting instruments for his songs without rehearsal, or abruptly leave after playing one song.

The 2005 release of &quot;Carousel Waltz&quot; brought a set of minimal American folk songs. The album was lauded by Babysue as a &quot;strangely compelling and uplifting vision of how love affects a person. Soft and focused, these unusual tunes are simultaneously accessible and peculiar. The Robot Ate Me remains one of the most unique acts on the planet. Brimming with credible substance, Carousel Waltz is yet another killer album from an artist who just keeps getting better and better with time...&quot;

The avant-garde &quot;Good World&quot; was released in 2006; it was composed primarily of sparse clarinet lines mixed with minimal percussion and falsetto vocals by Bouchard. Pitchforkmedia asked &quot;Has someone bludgeoned frontman Ryland Bouchard?&quot;. And Tinymixtapes declared: &quot;Not since the glory days of punk has an album come and gone so fast and left one with more questions than answers.&quot;

In November 2011, after releasing several albums under his own name, Bouchard announced a new album by The Robot Ate Me would be released in 2012.

<text>King Ralph is a 1991 American comedy film written and directed by David S. Ward and starring John Goodman, Peter O&#x27;Toole, and John Hurt. The film is about a fired American lounge singer who becomes the unlikely King of the United Kingdom after an electrical accident wipes out the British Royal Family.

The story is loosely based on the 1980 novel &quot;Headlong&quot; by Emlyn Williams. Very little of the story survived the transition to the screen; characters were changed and the story made into a comedy. The film was a minor box office hit but was received negatively by critics.

==Plot==

The entire British Royal Family who are the house of Wyndham is electrocuted and killed in a freak accident outside Buckingham Palace while having a royal portrait taken following a rainstorm. Sir Cedric Willingham leads a search for any surviving heirs to whom to pass the crown. After days of searching, a living heir is found: American Ralph Jones.

Shortly after being fired from his job as a lounge singer in Las Vegas, Ralph is informed by Cedric&#x27;s assistant secretary Duncan Phipps that he has royal heritage. His grandmother Constance had a brief affair with the first Duke of Warren while a hotel waitress in the US. Constance had a son, Ralph’s father. Since he, his father and grandmother are dead and Ralph is sole heir to the throne. A ring is given as proof, a duplicate of the ring she used to wear that the Duke had given her.

Ralph is flown to London where Cedric gives him a crash course on royal etiquette. On his second day, he goes to a strip club and meets Miranda Greene, a timid exotic dancer and aspiring fashion designer. He dares her to go out on a date with him if the British press proves his claim to the monarchy.

Meanwhile, Lord Percival Graves is opposed to having an American on the throne and attempts to declare the reigning House of Wyndham at an end and replace it with the House of Stuart, of which he is patriarch. Prime Minister Geoffrey Hale states that Ralph&#x27;s succession is legitimate unless he commits a heinous act. With this in mind, Graves bribes Miranda to stir up controversy by having a public relationship with Ralph.

Despite warnings by Cedric not to commit a mistake similar to that of King Edward VIII, Ralph sneaks out of the Palace to have a date with Miranda in Hyde Park. The next day, she returns Graves&#x27; money, but he already has photographs of her with Ralph. To protect Ralph&#x27;s reputation, Miranda breaks up with him.

Despite Ralph&#x27;s inability to understand British culture and his awkwardness at formal affairs, he makes a positive impression on King Mulambon of Zambezi during his state visit. They share concerns about the role of leadership they have assumed and the economic interests of their nations. Ralph accumulates a small but loyal following.

It is arranged for Ralph to marry Princess Anna of Finland to continue the royal bloodline and guarantee jobs for the UK in Finland&#x27;s newly discovered oil reserves in the Baltic Sea. On the night of the Finnish Royal Family&#x27;s visit, Ralph is sickened by Princess Anna&#x27;s unusually deep voice, her bizarre sexual preferences, and her nonchalant acceptance of arranged royal marriage.

Miranda attends the royal ball as a set-up by Graves, and photos of her kiss with Ralph are shown to Anna&#x27;s father King Gustav. This, along with Ralph&#x27;s impromptu performance of &quot;Good Golly, Miss Molly&quot;, results in Finland turning down the UK in favor of Japan for the offshore equipment contract.

Ralph accepts a stern scolding from Cedric and plans to set things right. Miranda confesses her role in the scandal and he cuts off contact with her. Becoming suspicious about his situation, Phipps tells Ralph that Cedric is also an heir to the throne (his great-grand-mother, a parlor maid, had a one-night stand with a British prince), but had turned it down.

Ralph addresses Parliament, apologizing for his recent actions. He then informs them he has organized with King Mulambon for Zambezi to purchase £200 million worth of British mining equipment and open three car engine plants in Britain, ensuring jobs for Miranda&#x27;s family and thousands of other Britons. He then reveals Graves has been sabotaging his succession to the throne and has him arrested for violating the Treason Act 1702. Finally, Ralph announces he will abdicate and reveals Cedric as his successor. He accepts his duty as king, and makes Ralph the third Duke of Warren, with a lucrative annual stipend and his own recording studio in his country estate. Cedric warns that since he has no children, Ralph may have to be king again after Cedric dies.

Ralph marries Miranda and has a son (Ralph II) with her while fronting his own singing group Ralph and the Dukettes. They perform a cover of &quot;Duke of Earl&quot; as the credits roll.

Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert of &quot;At the Movies&quot; gave the film &quot;Two Thumbs Down&quot;, with Ebert commenting that &quot;it might have been funnier if John Goodman had played a sleazeball instead of a cuddly nice guy.&quot; William Thomas of &quot;Empire&quot; magazine gave the film two out of five stars, calling it &quot;Poor, even for a &#x27;funny because he&#x27;s fat&#x27; film.&quot;
