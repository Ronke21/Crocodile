<text>Sverker the Younger (before 1167 – 17 July 1210), also known as Sverker II or Sverker Karlsson, was King of Sweden from 1195 or 1196 to 1208 when he was defeated in the Battle of Lena by Erik Knutsson. Sverker died in the 1210 Battle of Gestilren where his forces battled those of King Erik Knutsson.

==Early life==
Sverker was a son of King Karl Sverkersson of Sweden and Queen Christina Hvide, a Danish noblewoman. Through his mother, he was a first cousin once removed of the Danish kings Canute VI and Valdemar Sejr. His parents&#x27; marriage has been dated to 1162 or more probably 1163.

When his father Karl had been murdered in Visingsö in 1167, apparently by minions of the next king Knut Eriksson, Sverker was taken to Denmark while a boy and grew up with his mother&#x27;s clan of Hvide, leaders of Zealand. Sverker also allied himself with the Galen clan leaders in Skåne who were close to the Hvide, by marriage through lady Benedicta Ebbesdatter. The Danish king supported him as claimant to Sweden, thus helping to destabilize the neighboring country. The troubled Danish-Swedish relations at this time can be seen from attempts by Knut Eriksson and his jarl Birger Brosa to support rebels against Valdemar I and Canute VI.

When King Knut Eriksson died in 1195 or 1196, his sons were young but not children. One of them had been appointed heir to the throne, but was passed over. Sverker was chosen as the next king of Sweden, surprisingly without quarrel. At some point he had returned to his native country, however being regarded quite Danish. His uncontested election probably owed much to Jarl Birger Brosa whose daughter, Ingegerd, Sverker married soon after his first wife had died. In his own letters he emphasized his birth-right to kingship: &quot;son of King Karl, King of the Swedes, possessor of the throne of the same kingdom according to hereditary right by the grace of God&quot;.

==Reign==

King Sverker confirmed and enlarged privileges for the Swedish church and Valerius, the Archbishop of Uppsala. The privilege document of 1200 is the oldest known ecclesiastical privilege in Sweden. &quot;Skáldatal&quot; names two of Sverker&#x27;s court skalds: Sumarliði skáld and Þorgeirr Danaskáld. In 1202 Earl Birger died and the late jarl&#x27;s grandson, Sverker&#x27;s one-year-old son John received the title of Jarl from his father. This was intended to strengthen him as heir of the crown, but led to much ridicule.

Desultory warfare with the peoples east of the Baltic Sea continued during Sverker&#x27;s reign. Birger Brosa undertook a sea-borne expedition that ended up in Wierland in eastern Estonia, either before or after Sverker&#x27;s accession. A certain &quot;Dux&quot; John (Johannes) flourished in the early 13th century; according his grave inscription, he was the &quot;terror of the pagans&quot;. He may be identified with a Jon Jarl who, according to later tradition, fought the Russians and Ingrians for nine years, but was killed at Askanäs by Lake Mälaren by Karelian pirates, immediately after his return. His widow supposedly gathered levies which killed the marauders at Estaskär. It has been suggested that this took place in 1206. In general, Estonian and Curonian raiders constituted a problem for the coasts of Sweden and Denmark in this era.

==Civil war==
Around 1203, Knut&#x27;s four sons, who had lived in Swedish royal court, began to claim the throne and Sverker exiled them to Norway. His position as king became insecure from this point forward. The sons of Knut returned with troops in 1205, supported by the Norwegian party of Birkebeiner. Sverker, however, attacked and defeated them in the Battle of Älgarås in Tiveden, where three of the sons fell. The only survivor, Erik, returned with Norwegian support in 1208. Sverker sought assistance from his Danish kinsmen, and such was provided. Popular tradition speaks of 12,000 Danish auxiliary troops, which is likely a gross exaggeration. The forces were commanded by Ebbe Sunesen, the father of his late first wife and brother of Andreas Sunesen, Archbishop of Lund. Apart from the forces of the Sunesen brothers, King Valdemar Sejr contributed with troops, even including Bohemian soldiers. The opponents met in the Battle of Lena in Västergötland, where Sverker was heavily defeated. Ebbe and his brother Lars were slain by the enemy together with a considerable part of their army. Sverker&#x27;s jarl Knut seems to have been killed as well. King Erik Knutsson drove Sverker to exile to Denmark.

==Death==
Pope Innocentius III&#x27;s attempt to have the crown returned to Sverker did not succeed. Sverker made a new military expedition, with Danish support, to Sweden, but was defeated and killed in the Battle of Gestilren in July 1210. The ancient sources state that &quot;the Folkung [party] took his life&quot;. Responsible for the killing was his brother-in-law Folke Jarl, head of the Folkungs, who also succumbed in the battle. The site of the battle has engendered some discussion; while it is usually taken to have taken place in the parish of Varv in Västergötland, Gästre in Uppland has also been suggested.

In spite of his hapless fate, Sverker II receives several kind words in the short chronicle included in the Västgöta Law: &quot;The sixteenth [ruler] was King Sverker, a wise and good fellow; the kingdom fared well from him. But the Folkungs took his life; his own brother-in-law did that to him at Gestilren. He rests in Alvastra, and the best things are always spoken about him&quot;.

==Family==
With his first wife, the Danish noble Benedicta Ebbesdatter (Galen branch of the Hvide family), b. , d. 1200), whom he married before 1190 when yet living in Denmark, Sverker had at least one well-attested daughter, Helena. There were possibly further children, such as Karl Sverkersson who according to Norwegian sources married a daughter of king Sverre of Norway and lost his life in 1198; his position is however doubtful, and if he was King Sverker&#x27;s son he died in adolescence at the latest. There were possibly even two other daughters, Margaret and Christina, married to Witzlav of Rügen and Henry II, Lord of Mecklenburg (&quot;Henry Borwin&quot; in some later texts), respectively. The genealogical reconstruction is based on vague contemporary statements – however, Margaret and Christina may just have been Sverker&#x27;s first wife&#x27;s kinswomen.

The second marriage in 1200 with Ingegerd, daughter of the Folkunge Jarl Birger Brosa, produced a son and heir, Johan (1201–1222), who was chosen king of Sweden 1216.

It has also been argued however that it is possible Ingegerd was in fact Sverker&#x27;s first wife, and Benedicta his second, and that possibly more of the evidence may point to this conclusion instead.

His attested daughter Helena Sverkersdotter married (earl) Sune Folkesson of the family of Bjälbo, justiciar of Västergötland. Their daughters Catherine and Benedicta became pawns in marriages to gain Swedish succession after 1222, when the Sverker dynasty became extinct in male line. Catherine was married to the rival dynasty&#x27;s heir King Erik Eriksson but they remained apparently childless. Benedicta married Svantepolk of Viby and had several daughters, who married Swedish noblemen. Several Swedish noble families claim descent from Benedicta.

<doc id="811903" wikidata="Q173146" url="?curid=811903" title="McLaren Group">
<text>McLaren Group Limited ( ) is a British holding company based in Woking, England, which is involved in Formula One and other motorsport and the manufacture of sports cars.

The group was founded by Ron Dennis shortly after his acquisition of the McLaren Formula One team in 1981, as the TAG McLaren Group due to a partnership with Mansour Ojjeh&#x27;s TAG Group. The Formula One team had been established by New Zealander Bruce McLaren in 1963.

McLaren Group was renamed McLaren Technology Group in 2015. In June 2017 it was announced that Dennis had sold his 25% shareholding in the company to the other shareholders, in addition to his shares in McLaren Automotive. The group then merged with McLaren Automotive to form a new company using the previous McLaren Group name.

==History==
Bruce McLaren started Bruce McLaren Motor Racing in 1963 and the team first entered Formula One in 1966. Teddy Mayer took over direction of the group following McLaren&#x27;s death while testing a Can-am series car in 1970. Mayer subsequently led McLaren to their first World Constructors&#x27; Championship in 1974 with Brazilian driver Emerson Fittipaldi, who also won the World Drivers&#x27; Championship that year.

Between 1998 and 2011 McLaren built both the McLaren Technology Centre, a new headquarters and factory for the Group, and the McLaren Production Centre, in Woking, England.

In late May 2020, McLaren Group announced the layoff of 25% of its workforce as part of a company restructure due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The group announced in December 2020 that American investment firm MSP Sports Capital had purchased 15% of McLaren Racing, as part of a deal that would see them grow their stake to 33% by the end of 2022. The £185 million investment valued the team at £560 million.

In April 2021, Global Net Lease announced that it had agreed to acquire the McLaren Technology Centre in Woking for £170 million.

The group sold McLaren Applied to Greybull Capital in August 2021.

In March 2024, Mumtalakat Holding Company, the sovereign wealth fund of the Kingdom of Bahrain acquired all outstanding shares of McLaren Group and took full control of the company.

In December 2024, Mumtalakat Holding Company sold 100% of McLaren Automotive to Abu Dhabi-based investment firm CYVN Holdings. The sale also included a non-controlling stake in the McLaren Group.

==Subsidiaries==

===McLaren Racing===

McLaren originally entered Formula One in 1966 under its founder Bruce McLaren. However, in 1970 he died in a crash. The team was saved by Teddy Mayer, who helped the team win their first Constructors and Drivers titles. After Mayer, Ron Dennis took over the McLaren Racing team and worked for the company until 2018. However, at the beginning of the 2009 season, Dennis handed over the F1 department to Martin Whitmarsh so Dennis could focus on expanding McLaren overall, and especially in the road car market.

In 1966, McLaren suffered with reliability with their Ford 4.2-litre engine, and only scored one point after changing to a Serenissima V8. In 1967 they tried two different BRM engines. For the 1968 season they switched to Cosworth Ford engines. These continued to 1983, apart from a couple of Alfa Romeo examples, and then the TAG-Porsche turbo came in. This was the start of the MP4 cars, and the first entire carbon-composite chassis.

Honda engines took over in 1988, and then in 1993 the MP4/8 had a Ford HB engine. The next year was a Peugeot V10, and then the Mercedes era began in 1995, ending after the 2014 season.

The team&#x27;s first F1 race win occurred in 1968 when Bruce McLaren won the non-championship Race of Champions at Brands Hatch driving a McLaren M7A Ford. Later that year the team scored its first Grand Prix win when Bruce McLaren took the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa Francorchamps. By the end of the season Denny Hulme had won two further Grands Prix—in Italy and Canada (the team&#x27;s first 1-2 finish in a World Championship race). Emerson Fittipaldi won the F1 world championship in 1974, and McLaren also took their first constructor&#x27;s title at the same time. The 1976 title was taken by James Hunt, and then there was a gap until 1984. Then, Lauda took the title, and Prost took it the next two years running. The team took the constructor&#x27;s title in 1984 and 1985.

In 1988, the McLaren MP4/4 had a very successful year. Not only did Senna win the title, but the car won 15 out of 16 races, and, apart from just 27 laps, led every single lap during the year. Prost won in 1989, and then left for Ferrari after clashing with Senna. Senna also won the title for McLaren in 1990 and 1991.

The partnership between McLaren and Mercedes began in 1995 with McLaren choosing to use Mercedes engines. McLaren and Mercedes announced their intention to part ways in November 2009 as Mercedes had bought the debut-season driver and constructor winning team Brawn. It was re-branded as Mercedes Grand Prix. Ron Dennis said one reason McLaren and Mercedes parted ways was because of his &quot;ambitious plans to turn McLaren into a car manufacturer.&quot; Dennis insisted that in the &quot;21st century to survive in F1 you need to have more than just a team&quot;. However Mercedes continued to supply engines to McLaren until 2014.

Vodafone&#x27;s title sponsorship deal, which began in 2007, ended at the finish of the 2013 season. In 2014, the team&#x27;s official title was McLaren Mercedes. In 2015, the team, under a new partnership with car manufacturer Honda changed its official title to McLaren Honda. In 2018, the team was powered by customer Renault power units until 2020, when the team switched from Renault back to Mercedes.

==Former subsidiaries==
Former subsidiaries of McLaren Group are:
==Ownership==
Ron Dennis initially owned all of McLaren after buying out the remaining original shareholders after Bruce McLaren&#x27;s death. In 1983 he offered Mansour Ojjeh the chance to purchase 50% of the team, with McLaren becoming a joint venture with Ojjeh&#x27;s TAG Group. In 2000, after supplying engines to the team through its Mercedes subsidiary for five years, Daimler AG exercised an option to buy 40% of the TAG McLaren Group. Dennis and Ojjeh each retained a 30% share.

In August 2006 it was reported that Daimler was considering acquiring the remaining 60% of the McLaren Group. However, it was announced in January 2007 that the Mumtalakat Holding Company had purchased 15% each from both Dennis and Ojjeh. In November 2009, Mercedes bought Brawn GP (renaming it Mercedes GP) and announced that McLaren would buy back Daimler&#x27;s 40% share of the group over a period of two years. The shares were divided evenly between the remaining shareholders, with the Mumtalakat Holding Company owning 50% and Dennis and Ojjeh each owning 25%.

Dennis had stepped down as CEO of McLaren in 2009, handing over the reins to Martin Whitmarsh, but returned to his post in 2014 under the condition that he would seek investment to take a controlling interest in the company. His attempts to do so ultimately failed, and in November 2016 he lost a court case against his fellow shareholders that saw him suspended from his position as chairman. Dennis&#x27; contract with McLaren expired in January 2017, and in June 2017 it was announced that he had agreed to sell his remaining shares in both the McLaren Technology Group and McLaren Automotive. McLaren Automotive then became a subsidiary of the McLaren Technology Group, merging the shareholding of the two companies and seeing the group revert to its original McLaren Group name.

In May 2018, it was announced that Canadian businessman Michael Latifi had purchased approximately 10% of the group with an investment of £200 million. This left the shareholding at: Mumtalakat Holding Company 56.4%, TAG Group Limited 14.32%, Nidala (BVI) Limited (Michael Latifi) 9.84%, Favorita Limited 5.78%, Perlman Investments Limited 5.77%, McKal Holdings Ltd 5.24%, Acanitt Limited 2.65%. In 2024, Mumtalakat bought 100% of the company.

<doc id="811905" wikidata="Q1041116" url="?curid=811905" title="Generally recognized as safe">
<text>Generally recognized as safe (GRAS) is a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) designation that a chemical or substance added to food is considered safe by experts under the conditions of its intended use. An ingredient with a GRAS designation is exempted from the usual Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) food additive tolerance requirements. The concept of food additives being &quot;generally recognized as safe&quot; was first described in the Food Additives Amendment of 1958, and all additives introduced after this time had to be evaluated by new standards. The FDA list of GRAS notices is updated approximately each month, as of 2021.

==History==
On 6 September 1958, the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 was signed into law, with a list of 700 food substances that were exempt from the then-new requirement that manufacturers test food additives before putting them on the market. On August 31, 1960, William W. Goodrich, assistant general counsel of the FDA, addressed the annual meeting (16 Bus. Law. 107 1960–1961) of the FFDCA. The purpose of the meeting was the forthcoming March 6, 1961, effective date of the enforcement provisions of the &quot;Food Additives Amendment of 1958&quot;, referred to as GRAS.

==Designation and list==
A GRAS determination can be self-affirmed or the FDA can be notified of a determination of GRAS by qualified non-governmental experts:
* Self-affirmed. The manufacturer of this chemical or substance had performed all necessary research, including the formation of an expert panel to review safety concerns, and is prepared to use these findings to defend its product&#x27;s GRAS status.
* FDA Response to GRAS notification. The manufacturer has performed all the aforementioned due diligence, and submitted a GRAS notification to inform the FDA of a determination that the use of a substance is GRAS. Following evaluation, the FDA provides three possible responses: 1. FDA does not question the basis for the notifier&#x27;s GRAS determination, 2. the notification does not provide a sufficient basis for GRAS determination, or 3. the FDA has, at the notifier&#x27;s request, ceased to evaluate the GRAS notice.

 (beginning in 1998), 955 ingredient or food substances have been filed with the FDA. These petitions, submitted by sponsors or manufacturers, are reviewed for the safety evidence contained in the document. FDA posts status of the review as either without further questions (as a position of &quot;no objection&quot;) or the petition is withdrawn by the applicant.

For substances used in food prior to January 1, 1958, a &quot;grandfather clause&quot; allows experience based on common use in food to be used in asserting an ingredient is safe under the conditions of their intended use.

The FDA can also explicitly withdraw the GRAS classification, as it did for trans fat in 2015.

===List of GRAS notices===
The list of GRAS notices is updated approximately each month by the FDA.

==&quot;Code of Federal Regulations&quot;==
The &quot;Code of Federal Regulations&quot;, revised , includes (CFR) title 21 170.30(b) that provides general recognition of safety through scientific procedures requires the same quantity and quality of scientific evidence needed to obtain approval of the substance as a food additive. and ordinarily is based upon published studies, which may be corroborated by unpublished studies and other data and information.

==Intended use==
The substance must be shown to be &quot;generally recognized&quot; as safe under the conditions of its intended use. For new proposals, the proponent of the exemption usually a food manufacturer or ingredient supplier wishing to highlight a food ingredient in its manufactured product has the burden of providing rigorous scientific evidence that use of the substance in an edible consumer product is safe. To establish GRAS, the proponent must show that there is a consensus of expert opinion that the substance is safe for its intended use. For existing GRAS items, new uses should not substantially exceed historical occurrence levels of the substance in the diet.

==Enforcement==
When use of a substance does not qualify for the GRAS exemption, it is subject to the premarket approval mandated by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. In such circumstances, the FDA can take enforcement action to stop distribution of the food substance and foods containing it on the grounds that such foods are not deemed GRAS or contain an unlawfully added ingredient.

An example of a non-GRAS ingredient requiring enforcement actions in the form of FDA warning letters to 15 companies in 2019 was cannabidiol, which, as of 2021, had not been established with sufficient scientific evidence of safety as a GRAS ingredient.

<doc id="811932" wikidata="Q3673184" url="?curid=811932" title="Equal Employment Opportunity Commission">
<text>The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is a federal agency that was established via the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to administer and enforce civil rights laws against workplace discrimination. The EEOC investigates discrimination complaints based on an individual&#x27;s race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including sexual orientation, pregnancy, and gender identity), age, disability, genetic information, and retaliation for participating in a discrimination complaint proceeding and/or opposing a discriminatory practice.

The commission also mediates and settles thousands of discrimination complaints each year prior to their investigation. The EEOC is also empowered to file civil discrimination suits against employers on behalf of alleged victims. The Commission cannot adjudicate claims or impose administrative sanctions. Since 2025, the acting chair of the EEOC is Andrea R. Lucas.

== Process and enforcement ==

=== Authority ===
The EEOC has the authority to investigate and prosecute cases against most organizations, including labor unions and employment agencies, employing 15 workers or more, or, in the case of age discrimination, 20 or more workers. The commissioner of the EEOC can issue charges without a complainant, referred to as a &quot;commissioner&#x27;s charge.&quot; Discrimination complaints can be based on hiring, firing, promotions, harassment, training, wages, and/or benefits, and responsibility covers:

* Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
* Sections 102 and 103 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991
* Pregnancy Discrimination Act
* Equal Pay Act of 1963
* Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990
* Sections 501 and 505 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973
* Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967
* Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act
* Pregnant Workers Fairness Act

=== Process ===
The EEOC investigation is confidential until the charge is filed, when the EEOC has 10 days to notify the employer of the charge. Charges may be filed on behalf of someone else to maintain some anonymity, for example, a parent may file a charge on behalf of a minor child.

==== Alternative dispute resolution ====
Because all federal agencies are required to offer an alternative dispute resolution, the EEOC offers mediation with external or internal professional mediators as a voluntary alternative to litigation, which typically results in faster resolutions. In the 2020 fiscal year (FY), the EEOC reported more than 6,000 mediations conducted recovering nearly half of the $333.2 million in relief from mediation, conciliation, and settlement. Mediation is offered, or can be requested, prior to investigation, or after a finding of discrimination has been issued, during conciliation. If the EEOC does not find merit in the charge, they will not offer, nor allow for a request, for mediation. The average mediation with the EEOC takes three months.

==== Respondent&#x27;s position statement and investigation ====
Employers have 30 days from receipt of a charge to respond to allegations prior to any investigation or mediation offering, or if voluntary mediation was used, but unsuccessful. Charging parties have 20 days to respond to the respondent&#x27;s position statement. The EEOC may ask the employer for additional information such as witness interviews, an on-site interview, or personnel files and policies. An investigator will determine whether or not there is reasonable cause to determine whether or not discrimination has occurred. In FY 2020, the EEOC found 17.4% of charged cases to have merit. The EEOC says investigations typically take 10 months or longer.

==== Right to sue ====
A right to sue gives claimants the right to file a lawsuit in federal court. Right-to-sue notices are granted when the agency does not pursue litigation, because the claimant requests the notice after 180 days have elapsed into an investigation; the EEOC finds merit following an investigation, but declines to prosecute; or the agency is unable to determine if there is reasonable cause that the law may have been violated.

Charges filed under the Equal Pay Act or Age Discrimination in Employment Act do not require a right to sue. Age discrimination lawsuits may be filed 60 days after the charge has been filed with the EEOC, while lawsuits due to wage discrimination based on sex may be within two years from the last discriminatory paycheck.

==== Litigation ====
The Office of General Counsel, which is led by an appointee of the president that has been confirmed by the Senate for a four-year term, prosecutes EEOC cases to recover relief for complainants the agency has found to be victims of discrimination. The EEOC does not have the resources to file a lawsuit in every case where discrimination has been found and weighs the seriousness and potential impact on determining whether or not to litigate. In FY 2020, the EEOC recovered $106 million in relief through litigation of 93 meritorious lawsuits, 13 of which were systemic, accounting for $69.9 million of the relief. The EEOC defines systemic cases as &quot;pattern or practice, policy and/or class cases where the discrimination has a broad impact on an industry, profession, company or geographic location,&quot; and all cases are investigated as potentially systemic.

=== Remedies ===
When a finding of discrimination is found by the EEOC, the goal of the agency is injunctive relief, both to put the victim in the position they would have been in had the discrimination not occurred, and to stop and prevent the discriminatory behavior. This could include back-pay, job reinstatement, attorney&#x27;s fees, expert witness fees, court costs, other compensatory damages, and punitive damages. Age-based discrimination and gender-based wage discrimination are not eligible for compensatory or punitive damages, but instead are limited to liquidated damages equal to the amount of back pay. Pecuniary future damages and non-pecuniary damages are limited per employee by the size of the employer:

* For employers with 15–100 employees, the limit is $50,000.
* For employers with 101–200 employees, the limit is $100,000.
* For employers with 201–500 employees, the limit is $200,000.
* For employers with more than 500 employees, the limit is $300,000.

=== Investigative compliance policy ===
EEOC applies an investigative compliance policy when respondents are uncooperative in providing information during an investigation of a charge. If a respondent fails to turn over requested information, field offices are to subpoena the information, file a direct suit on the merits of a charge, or use the legal principle of adverse inference, which assumes the withheld information is against the respondent.

== History ==
In 1941, the precursor of the EEOC was set up with Executive Order 8802 of FDR: Fair Employment Practice Committee (FEPC).

On March 6, 1961, President John F. Kennedy signed Executive Order 10925, which required government contractors to &quot;take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.&quot; It established the President&#x27;s Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity, which then Vice President Lyndon Johnson was appointed to head. This was the forerunner of the EEOC.

The EEOC was established on July 2, 1965. Management directive 715 is a regulatory guidance document from the commission to all federal agencies regarding adherence to equal opportunity employment laws and reporting requirements.

The EEOC&#x27;s first complainants were female flight attendants. However, the EEOC at first ignored sex discrimination complaints, and the prohibition against sex discrimination in employment went unenforced for the next few years. One EEOC director called the prohibition &quot;a fluke... conceived out of wedlock.&quot;

In 2005, the EEOC established the Systemic Task Force (STF) to evaluate how the agency combats systemic discrimination. In March 2006, the STF determined that the agency could not effectively address system discrimination without a nationwide system, but that the EEOC was uniquely prepared to fight systemic discrimination because the EEOC&#x27;s broad authority, commissioner&#x27;s charges, access to data, exemption from Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, focus on injunctive relief, and nationwide coverage. As a result, the commission created the role of Systemic Coordinator and Lead Systemic Investigator, and implemented programs that resulted in improved systemic expertise in the agency and all charges being investigated as potential systemic cases.

In 2008, disability-based charges handled by the EEOC rose to a record 19,543, up 10.2 percent from the prior year and the highest level since 1995. That may again be showing that because the EEOC has not adjusted many of their initial 1991 fines for inflation, the backlog of EEOC cases illustrates erosion of deterrence.

In 2011, the Commission included &quot;sex-stereotyping&quot; of lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals, as a form of sex discrimination illegal under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In 2012, the Commission expanded protection provided by Title VII to transgender status and gender identity. In 2015, it concluded that for Title VII, sex discrimination includes discrimination based on sexual orientation. The Supreme Court upheld this position in &quot;R.G. &amp; G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission&quot; in 2020.

In 2012, the EEOC achieved a second consecutive year of a significant reduction in the charge inventory, something not seen since FY 2002. Due to a concerted effort, the EEOC reduced the pending inventory of private sector charges by 10 percent from FY 2011, bringing the inventory level to 70,312. This inventory reduction is the second consecutive decrease of almost ten percent in charge inventory.

During FY 2020, the EEOC secured a record amount of recovery, more than $535 million, for victims of discrimination in the workplace. Also, the agency reduced the private sector charge inventory by nearly 4 percent to the lowest level in 14 years. Notably, the agency increased the percentage of charges resolved and those with an outcome favorable to the charging party increased by nearly two percent, to 17.4 percent.

In February 2025, the EEOC moved to dismiss six of its own pending cases alleging gender identity discrimination: One in Alabama, one in California, three in Illinois and one in New York. It cited President Donald Trump&#x27;s January 20, 2025, executive order, &quot;Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government&quot;, which defines sex as binary.

==Staffing, workload, and backlog==
In 1975, when the backlog reached more than 100,000 charges to be investigated, President Gerald Ford&#x27;s full requested budget of $62 million was approved. A &quot;Backlog Unit&quot; was created in Philadelphia in 1978 to resolve the thousands of federal equal employment complaints inherited from the Civil Service Commission. In 1980, Eleanor Holmes Norton began re-characterizing the backlog cases as &quot;workload&quot; in her reports to Congress, thus fulfilling her promise to eliminate the backlog.

In June 2006, civil rights and labor union advocates publicly complained that the effectiveness of the EEOC was being undermined by budget and staff cuts and the outsourcing of complaint screening to a private contractor whose workers were poorly trained. In 2006, a partial budget freeze prevented the agency from filling vacant jobs, and its staff had shrunk by nearly 20 percent from 2001. A Bush administration official stated that the cuts had been made because it was necessary to direct more money to defense and homeland security. By 2008, the EEOC had lost 25 percent of its staff over the previous eight years, including investigators and lawyers who handle the cases. The number of complaints to investigate grew to 95,400 in fiscal 2008, up 26 percent from 2006.

The outsourcing to Pearson Government Solutions in Kansas cost the agency $4.9 million and was called a &quot;huge waste of money&quot; by the president of the EEOC employees&#x27; union in 2006.

== Race and ethnicity ==

The EEOC requires employers to report various information about their employees, in particular their racial/ethnic categories, to prevent discrimination based on race/ethnicity. The definitions used in the report have been different at different times.

In 1997, the Office of Management and Budget gave a Federal Register Notice, the &quot;Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity,&quot; which defined new racial and ethnic definitions. As of September 30, 2007, the EEOC&#x27;s EEO-1 report must use the new racial and ethnic definitions in establishing grounds for racial or ethnic discrimination. If an employee identifies their ethnicity as &quot;Hispanic or Latino&quot; as well as a race, the race is not reported in EEO-1, but it is kept as part of the employment record.

A person&#x27;s skin color or physical appearance can also be grounds for a case of racial discrimination. Discrimination based on national origin can be grounds for a case on discrimination as well.

==Successes==

On May 1, 2013, a Davenport, Iowa jury awarded the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commissission damages totaling $240 million—the largest verdict in the federal agency&#x27;s history—for disability discrimination and severe abuse. The jury agreed with the EEOC that Texas-based Hill County Farms, doing business in Iowa as Henry&#x27;s Turkey Service, subjected a group of 32 men with intellectual disabilities to severe abuse and discrimination for a period between 2007 and 2009, after 20 years of similar mistreatment. This victory received international attention and was profiled in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

On June 1, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court held in an 8–1 decision written by Justice Antonin Scalia that an employer may not refuse to hire an applicant if the employer was motivated by avoiding the need to accommodate a religious practice. Such behavior violates the prohibition on religious discrimination contained in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. EEOC General Counsel David Lopez hailed the decision. &quot;At its root, this case is about defending the quintessentially American principles of religious freedom and tolerance,&quot; Lopez said. &quot;This decision is a victory for our increasingly diverse society and we applaud Samantha Elauf&#x27;s courage and tenacity in pursuing this matter.&quot;

== Criticism ==
Some employment-law professionals criticized the agency after it issued advice that requiring a high school diploma from job applicants could violate the Americans with Disabilities Act. The advice letter stated that the longtime lowest common denominator of employee screening must be &quot;job-related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity.&quot; A Ballard Spahr lawyer suggested, &quot;There will be less incentive for the general public to obtain a high school diploma if many employers eliminate that requirement for job applicants in their workplace.&quot;

The EEOC has been criticized for alleged heavy-handed tactics in their 1980 lawsuit against retailer Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. Based on a statistical analysis of personnel and promotions, EEOC argued that Sears both was systematically excluding women from high-earning positions in commission sales and was paying female management lower wages than male management. Sears, represented by lawyer Charles Morgan, Jr., counter-argued that the company had encouraged female applicants for sales and management, but women preferred lower-paying positions with more stable daytime working hours, as compared to commission sales, which demanded evening and weekend shifts and featured drastically varying paychecks, depending on the numbers of sales in a given pay period. In 1986, the court ruled in favor of Sears on all counts and noted that the EEOC had neither produced a single witness who alleged discrimination nor identified any Sears policy that discriminated against women.

In a 2011 ruling against the EEOC, Judge Loretta A. Preska declared that the agency relied too heavily on anecdotal claims rather than on hard data, in a lawsuit against Bloomberg, L.P. that alleged discrimination against pregnant employees. In a ruling described in the &quot;New York Times&quot; as &quot;strongly worded,&quot; Preska wrote, &quot;the law does not mandate &#x27;work–life balance&#x27; and added that while Bloomberg had expected high levels of dedication from employees, the company did not treat women who took pregnancy leave differently from those who took leave for other reasons.

During the first Donald Trump administration, the EEOC came under criticism for being ineffective. The budget allocated to the EEOC by Congress has forced it to downsize, cutting its original staffing levels by over 40%.

==Commissioners==
The commission is composed of five members, appointed by the president of the United States with the consent of the United States Senate. They serve terms of five years. They may continue to serve until their successor are appointed and qualified, though not longer than 60 days when the Senate is in session without a nomination having been submitted, or after the adjournment sine die of the session of the Senate in which such nomination was submitted. No more than three members of the commission may be members of the same political party.

The President designates one member to serve as chairman, and one member to serve as vice chairman. Three members of the commission constitutes a quorum.

<doc id="811938" wikidata="Q320977" url="?curid=811938" title="Knut Eriksson">
<text>Knut Eriksson (; born before 1150 – died 1195/96), also known as Canute I, was King of Sweden from 1173 until his death (rival king since 1167). He was a son of King Erik the Saint and Queen Christina, who was a granddaughter of the Swedish king Inge the Elder.

==Youth and ascension==

Knut was born no later than the 1140s, thus before his father had yet gained power over parts of Sweden. As a young man he was betrothed to a lady, sister of another Knut. Her name is not revealed, but her equal could supposedly not be found in the land. When Erik the Saint was killed in Uppsala in 1160, Knut was defeated and forced to flee, while his fiancée hid in a monastery for reasons of safety. According to late medieval sources he lived in exile in Norway for three years, a piece of information that is highly unreliable. He later returned to reclaim the throne. The killer of his father, Magnus Henriksen, was slain in 1161 by another pretender, Karl Sverkersson, who took the throne and resided in Näs Castle at the southern point of Visingsö, an island in Lake Vättern. Knut came over and slew Karl on 12 April 1167. The sources do not allow us to tell if it was a regicide or if Karl was killed in battle. The deed did not immediately secure the throne for Knut, who started fighting for power against Sverker the Elder&#x27;s sons or grandsons Kol and Burislev. As the chronicle states, &quot;he fought many battles against Sweden and had the victory in them all, and had great effort before he gained Sweden with peace.&quot; According to later sources Kol fell in fighting at Bjälbo in 1169, while Burislev underwent the same fate in about 1172–73. Only from this time could Knut call himself king of the whole country. According to the short chronicle included in the &quot;Västgöta Law&quot;, he ruled as a good king for 23 years after his victories.

==Rule==

After 1174, Knut was ably supported in his rule by the jarl (earl) Birger Brosa who died in 1202. In many ways, the long reign of Knut brought Sweden closer to a Catholic-European state model. The power of the king was consolidated, concomitantly with an emerging central bureaucracy where the written word was increasingly important. The issuing of royal written documents began at this time; nine such are preserved, mostly dealing with the affairs of the monastery of Viby at Sigtuna. There had not been any coinage in Sweden from about 1030 to 1150, when minting once again started in Lödöse. King Knut supported the initiative and issued royal coins after c. 1180 with the inscription KANVTVS REX or KANVTVS. The coins are of German type, and minting may be connected to Knut&#x27;s relationship with North Germany. Some time before 1180 he concluded a commercial treaty with Henry the Lion of Saxony. It is the first such treaty in Swedish history and may indicate the emergence of towns. He also sent three envoys to Henry II of England in c. 1185 and received pieces of armour in return.

==Relations with Scandinavian and Baltic neighbours==

Within Scandinavia, Knut and his jarl Birger Brosa entertained good relations with the Norwegian king Sverre, who married the sister of the king, Margareta. The pretender Erling Steinvegg, who was the enemy of Sverre, was arrested by Knut on behalf of his brother-in-law and imprisoned on Visingsö. On the other hand, relations with Denmark were rocky. Danish rebels found refuge in Sweden in 1176 and 1191, and in 1182 Knut and Birger Brosa supported the pretender Harald Skraeng who fomented a rising in Skåne but was defeated by the Danish royal troops.

During his reign Knut was reportedly occupied fighting pagans for the sake of dissemination of the Christian faith. A fleet of pagan Karelians entered Lake Mälaren in 1187 and ravaged the coasts. The marauders burned Sigtuna and killed Archbishop Johannes at Almarestäket. It seems that Knut built a defensive tower on the island of Stockholm after this event, one of many such fortifications made necessary by heathen incursions from the Baltic lands. Other such towers were constructed in Skå, Stegeborg, Stenså, Kalmar, Strömsrum and Borgholm. Immediately after the attack, a sea-borne expedition to the east was organized. The chronicles of Novgorod report that Varyags and &quot;Germans&quot; from Gotland attacked its territory in 1188. The Nordic attackers won victories at Khoruzhka and Novotorzhek and stayed over winter. In the next spring they were defeated by the Novgorodians, however. Birger Brosa seems to have led another fleet of Germans and men from Gotland across the Baltic Sea in the 1190s - either before or after Knut&#x27;s death. The expedition was aimed for Curland but was driven to the coast of eastern Estonia whose inhabitants were defeated and forced to pay tribute.

&quot;Skáldatal&quot; names two of King Knut&#x27;s skalds: Hallbjörn hali and Þorsteinn Þorbjarnarson.

==Death and succession==

Knut Eriksson died in Eriksberg in Västergötland, either in the autumn of 1195 or on 8 April 1196. On balance he was the first successful ruler of Sweden for a long time, being the first king since Philip (d. 1118) to die a natural death. He was buried in Varnhem Abbey. His sons were reportedly grown up at his demise, but he was nevertheless succeeded by Sverker Karlsson, son of his former rival Karl Sverkersson. The House of Sverker had sufficient support among the church and grandees to regain power, apparently without shedding blood.

== Family ==

Knut married his cloistered fiancée after his ascension to power. The name of his wife is unknown but sometimes taken to be Cecilia Johansdotter. She gave birth to several children of which one was appointed heir to the throne with the consent of the grandees of the kingdom. At a later time she became seriously ill. In her agony she promised before God to observe celibacy if she recovered. Knut agreed in order to console her. In fact she survived and entered a monastery. However, Knut wrote a letter to Pope Celestine III in 1193, asking to be allowed to take up married life. The reason was that he must cooperate with his wife&#x27;s relative to fight the pagans, and evade the libel of his enemies. The outcome of his request is not clear.

With his wife, Knut had four sons. Three were slain in November 1205 at Battle of Älgarås. The fourth was Erik Knutsson, who would defeat Sverker Karlsson and become King of Sweden in 1208.

They are said to have had a daughter, whose name was possibly Sigrid or Karin, and who is said to have married either jarl Knut Birgersson (and become mother of Magnus Broka), or married Magnus Broka himself (and with Magnus had a son Knut Magnusson, or, Knut Katarinason, claimant of Swedish throne and killed in 1251). Existence of this daughter is based on unclear mentions in old saga and chronicle material, especially the Norwegian Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar. It is to an extent accepted in research literature, to explicate Knut Magnusson&#x27;s hereditary claim to the throne. This daughter was by necessity born in the 1170s or 1180s. She is also proposed by old romantical-looking genealogies as mother of a Duke&#x27;s daughter Cecilia Knutsdotter (by necessity born near 1208 at earliest), whose parentage however is fully shrouded in mists of history.

<text>Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (Alexandra Louise Olga Victoria; 1 September 1878 – 16 April 1942) was the fourth child and third daughter of Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia. As the wife of Ernst II, she was Princess consort of Hohenlohe-Langenburg. She was a granddaughter of both Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Tsar Alexander II of Russia.

== Early life ==

Alexandra was born Princess Alexandra of Edinburgh on 1 September 1878 at Rosenau Castle, Coburg. Her father was Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, the second-eldest son of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Her mother was Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia, the only surviving daughter of Alexander II of Russia and Marie of Hesse and by Rhine. She was baptised &quot;Alexandra Louise Olga Victoria&quot; on 2 October 1878 at Edinburgh Palace, Coburg, presumably by her mother&#x27;s chaplain. Her godparents included her maternal uncle Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia.

During Alexandra&#x27;s formative years, her father, occupied with his career in the Navy and later as a ruler in Coburg, paid little attention to his family. It was Alexandra&#x27;s mother who was the domineering presence in their children&#x27;s life. Alexandra had four siblings: Alfred, Marie, Victoria Melita, and Beatrice (her only younger sibling). Throughout her life, Alexandra was usually overshadowed by her elder sisters; she was considered less beautiful and more subdued than Marie and Victoria Melita.

Nicknamed &#x27;Sandra&#x27; by her family, She spent her early years in England, where the family lived at Eastwell Park, which Maria Alexandrovna loved and preferred to the couple&#x27;s official London residence, Clarence House. The Duke of Edinburgh was rarely at home, constantly serving in the navy. When he came home, he played a lot with the children, inventing new entertainments. All the children studied French, which they hated and rarely spoke.In 1886, Duke Alfred was appointed commander of the Mediterranean Fleet. The family moved to Malta, where they settled in the San Anton Palace. The palace always had rooms reserved for Prince George of Wales, the future King George V, who often visited them and called his cousins &quot;three dear sisters&quot;.
That year, the entire family moved to Coburg and settled in Rosenau Castle the family moved as her father was the heir apparent to the duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Maria Alexandrovna hired a German governess for her daughters, who bought the girls simple clothes and taught them the Lutheran faith In Coburg, the education of the young princesses was expanded: they were taught painting and music.On Thursdays and Sundays, Alexandra and her sisters attended the theatre, which they all loved very much.She was a bridesmaid at the 1885 wedding of her aunt Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom to Prince Henry of Battenberg, and at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of York in 1893. That year, her great-uncle, The Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (brother of her paternal grandfather, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha) died without issue. As Prince Albert had passed away, and her uncle the Prince of Wales had renounced his claim to the duchy, the ducal throne fell to the Duke of Edinburgh. Following her father&#x27;s succession, though Alexandra remained a British princess, she took the title of Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.

== Marriage ==
Alexandra&#x27;s mother, Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna, believed in marrying her daughters young, before they began to think for themselves.

In 1893, the dukes&#x27; eldest daughter, Marie, married the heir to the Romanian throne, Crown Prince Ferdinand. The following year, Victoria Melita, the second daughter, married her cousin, Grand Duke Ernst Ludwig of Hesse. Maria Alexandrovna herself looked for suitable candidates for her daughters. At the end of 1895, she arranged the engagement of Alexandra to the German aristocrat Ernst of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, the son and heir of Prince Hermann of Hohenlohe-Langenburg and Princess Leopoldine of Baden.

Alexandra&#x27;s grandmother, Queen Victoria, complained that she was too young to marry at 17 and Alexandra&#x27;s father objected to the status of his future son-in-law, who was lower than Alexandra in rank. The House of Hohenlohe-Langenburg was mediatized a formerly ruling family who had ceded their sovereign rights to others while (in theory) retaining their equal birth. It was not considered a brilliant match.

=== Issue ===
They had five children:
* Prince Gottfried, 8th Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg (24 March 1897 – 11 May 1960); married Princess Margarita of Greece and Denmark, the eldest sister of the future Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and had issue.
* Princess Marie Melita of Hohenlohe-Langenburg (18 January 1899 – 8 November 1967); married Wilhelm Friedrich, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein and had issue.
* Princess Alexandra Beatrice Leopoldine of Hohenlohe-Langenburg (2 April 1901 – 26 October 1963)
* (4 July 1902 – 8 March 1986)
* Prince Alfred Christian of Hohenlohe-Langenburg (16 April 1911 – 18 April 1911)

== Life in Hohenlohe-Langenburg ==

=== First World War ===
After the wedding, Alexandra lived in Germany for the rest of her life. In 1900, the Duke of Edinburgh and Saxe-Coburg and Gotha died. His wife and daughters were by his side during his last days. Alexandra&#x27;s cousin Prince Karl Eduard, For the next five years, he ruled under the regency of Alexandra&#x27;s husband, the Hereditary Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg. Upon reaching the age of majority on 19 July 1905, Karl Eduard assumed all constitutional powers of the head of the Saxe-Coburg and Gotha state. During the First World War, Alexandra worked as a nurse for the Red Cross. After the November Revolution in Germany in 1918, which overthrew the power of the German dynasties, the Kingdom of Württemberg, which had mediatized the Principality of Hohenlohe since 1806, ceased to exist. Ernst lost his seat in the Württemberg parliament. From that time on, the couple bore the nominal title of Princes of Hohenlohe-Langenburg. In 1920, her mother Maria Alexandrovna died in Zurich.

Alexandra lived for the rest of her life in Germany. At the death of her father in 1900, Alexandra&#x27;s husband was appointed regent of the duchy of Saxe-Coburg during the minority of the new Duke, who was her first cousin. Alexandra&#x27;s only brother, Alfred, had died in 1899. During World War I, she worked as a Red Cross nurse. In February 1916 her eldest daughter Marie Melita was married in Coburg to Prince Wilhelm Friedrich, the future Duke of Schleswig-Holstein, and Alexandra became a grandmother when the couple&#x27;s first child Prince Hans was born in May 1917. On her thirty-fifth wedding anniversary in April 1931, her eldest son Gottfried married Princess Margarita of Greece and Denmark, elder sister of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and future sister in law to future Queen Queen Elizabeth II.

<doc id="811987" wikidata="Q656769" url="?curid=811987" title="Zadok the Priest">
<text>Zadok the Priest (HWV 258) is a British anthem that was composed by George Frideric Handel for the coronation of George II in 1727. Alongside &quot;The King Shall Rejoice&quot;, &quot;My Heart is Inditing&quot;, and &quot;Let Thy Hand Be Strengthened&quot;, &quot;Zadok the Priest&quot; is one of Handel&#x27;s coronation anthems. One of Handel&#x27;s best-known works, &quot;Zadok the Priest&quot; has been sung prior to the anointing of the sovereign at the coronation of every British monarch since its composition and has become recognised as a British patriotic anthem.

==Text==

Part of the traditional content of British coronations, the texts for all four anthems were picked by Handel—a personal selection from the most accessible account of an earlier coronation, that of James II in 1685. The text is a translation of the traditional antiphon, &quot;Unxerunt Salomonem&quot;, itself derived from the biblical account of the anointing of Solomon by the priest Zadok (1 Kings 1:38-40).

These words have been used in every English, and later British, coronation since that of King Edgar at Bath Abbey in 973. An earlier setting is thought to have been written by Thomas Tomkins for the coronation of King Charles I in 1626, the text of which has survived but not the music.

Henry Lawes wrote another for the coronation of King Charles II in 1661. This was also sung at James II&#x27;s in 1685, although the music may have been amended to accommodate changes to the text made by Archbishop William Sancroft.

At the coronation itself on 11 October 1727, the choir of Westminster Abbey sang &quot;Zadok the Priest&quot; in the wrong part of the service; they had earlier entirely forgotten to sing one anthem and another ended &quot;in confusion&quot;.

===Lyrics===
The lyrics of the piece are biblical, being a distillation of 1 Kings 1:34-45:

==Structure==
&quot;Zadok the Priest&quot; is written for SS-AA-T-BB chorus and orchestra (two oboes, two bassoons, three trumpets, timpani, strings with three violin parts rather than the usual two, and continuo), in the key of D major. The music prepares a surprise in its orchestral introduction through the use of static layering of soft string textures followed by a sudden rousing &quot;forte tutti&quot; entrance, augmented by three trumpets.

The middle section, &quot;And all the people rejoic&#x27;d, and said&quot;, is a dance form in time, with the choir singing chordally and a dotted rhythm in the strings.

The final section, &quot;God save the King&quot;, etc., is a return to common time (), with the &quot;God save the King&quot; section heard chordally, interspersed with the Amens incorporating long semiquaver runs, taken in turn through the six voice parts (SAATBB) with the other parts singing quaver chords accompanying it. The chorus ends with a largo plagal cadence on &quot;Alleluia&quot;.

==In other contexts==
Tony Britten rearranged &quot;Zadok the Priest&quot; in 1992, using it as the basis for the &quot;UEFA Champions League Anthem&quot;. 

The song was played during the wedding processional of Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark and Mary Donaldson. Their wedding took place on 14 May 2004 at Copenhagen Cathedral.

<text>William Henry Avery (August 11, 1911 – November 4, 2009) was an American Republican Party politician who served as the 37th governor of Kansas from 1965 until 1967.

==Life and career==
Born on August 11, 1911, near Wakefield, Kansas, Avery graduated from the University of Kansas in 1934. While attending KU, he joined Delta Upsilon fraternity. He was a member of the Wakefield School Board, and served in the Kansas House of Representatives from 1951 to 1955, and in the Congress for the Republican Party from 1955 to 1965.

Avery&#x27;s parents were both college graduates; his father from Kansas State University and his mother from Emporia State University. Although very many school children did not attend school in that day, there was a strong push from both of Avery&#x27;s parents to get an education. Although his family had a history with Kansas State, and it was the closest college – he declined the Wildcats and enrolled at the University of Kansas in Lawrence.

Avery &quot;served as the state&#x27;s thirty-seventh chief executive, from January 11, 1965, to January 9, 1967. Although his gubernatorial service was short, Avery&#x27;s outgoing personality and ability to win elections made him a central figure in Kansas Republican Party politics throughout the 1950s and 1960s.&quot;

Avery is remembered as the governor who sanctioned the executions of Perry Smith and Richard Hickock, the murderers of the Clutter family, made notorious by the Truman Capote book &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;. Capote describes the governor as &quot;a wealthy farmer&quot; conscious of public opinion. Also as governor, he dedicated a memorial in Delphos, Kansas, for Abraham Lincoln and Grace Bedell, the eleven-year-old girl who suggested to presidential candidate Lincoln to grow his famous beard.

After losing the governorship to Robert Docking in the 1966 election, Avery attempted but failed to win a seat in the U.S. Senate, losing in the primary to future presidential candidate Bob Dole. Following his retirement from politics, he worked for Clinton Oil Company and became president of Real Petroleum Company. In 1990, Avery was elected to the Common Cause National Governing Board.

Avery was one of five former governors interviewed for the documentary &quot;The Kansas Governor&quot;, in which he proudly stated that in his many years of politics he had never played a round of golf. Avery was married to Hazel Bowles (January 4, 1914 – August 17, 2004) from 1940 until her death.

Avery died on November 4, 2009, at age 98. Flags in the state were ordered lowered until November 14 in his honor.

==Entrance into politics==
William Avery&#x27;s political career started on the Milford Reservoir. &quot;I came right back from college and took over the farm. I evolved as kind of a spokesman for the lower part of the Republican Valley as opposing the reservoir and being in that group I became acquainted with a lot of people over at Tuttle Creek who were opposing Tuttle Creek [Dam]. So when it began to get heated up some, why I knew that group and we worked together rather effectively.&quot;

What that group was trying to do was stop the Dam from being built. There had been a flood in 1935 and people in the Tuttle Creek area were much more concerned about losing their houses and land opposed to a water shortage. Due to his work in Tuttle Creek, Avery was pushed to run for office in the state legislature. He believed that the local citizens believed they could have better representation, and Avery thought it was his job to fill that void. His opportunity came when citizens from Clay Center, Kansas sought him out to run for the Kansas House of Representatives. Avery said he would do it, as long as he did not have to go through a primary. &quot;They gave a lot of reasons why they thought I should run. I said, &quot;Okay, I&#x27;ll make a deal. If you will guarantee I won&#x27;t have a primary I&#x27;ll probably consider to run, but I don&#x27;t want to have to campaign at a primary and then possibly campaign in the general election.&quot; They came back in about a week and said, &quot;We got it fixed; you won&#x27;t have a primary.&quot;

Avery had the advantage of being a Republican running in one of the largest Republican counties in the state of Kansas. He was also a third generation farmer who had attended college and came back to take over the family farm. These two factors helped in his attempt at becoming a legislator. &quot;Clay County is one of the strongest Republican counties in Kansas, I think number one, two, or three, so I didn&#x27;t even have an opponent in the general election, and I didn&#x27;t have an opponent when I ran for my second term.&quot;

Avery did have an opponent in his Clay County primary. He defeated prohibition candidate Ed Woellhof by 1983 votes to enter the Republican Party&#x27;s 1954 primary. The incumbent of the first district was Democrat Howard Miller who had defeated incumbent Albert Cole. Cole had gotten some signs crossed with Avery in regards to the Milford Reservoir. &quot;In the Blue Valley and Republican Valley action, he&#x27;s opposed to Tuttle Creek and he&#x27;s opposed to Milford, and that made him pretty solid in this area. Then after the 1942 flood that came along, why there was a lot of damage downstream, and that revived the downstream support for the reservoirs. I knew Albert and I didn&#x27;t interrogate him very seriously on this, but he gave me the impression he voted against putting this money in for Milford and Tuttle Creek. But he didn&#x27;t get up and oppose it.&quot;

This meant there would be a new representative from the First Congressional District of Kansas. For that man to be William Avery, he had to win the primary. Avery&#x27;s biggest competition in the primary was Doral Hawks, a Republican who had a strong hold on Topeka. The First Congressional District of Kansas consists of 13 counties which also encompass Shawnee Country; which is the county Topeka is located in. After the floods of 1935 and 1942 caused much damage to the city of Topeka, many citizens wanted the reservoirs built to help protect the city. Hawks was running under the platform of creating the reservoirs – an issue that seemed to impact the voting significantly. &quot;The Republican Party&#x27;s 1954 primary, a five-way contest for what was then the Kansas First Congressional District, was quite close. Avery won a plurality with 40 percent of the votes cast (22,077), and Hawks came in second, receiving almost 37 percent (19,952).&quot;

Now, William Avery was up against the incumbent. Howard Miller had been receiving much credit for accomplishments that he had not actually achieved. &quot;These Blue Valley Belles got a lot of publicity by campaigning for Howard Miller, saying he stopped Tuttle Creek. He didn&#x27;t, Dwight Eisenhower took it out of the budget, that&#x27;s what stopped it. He got the credit and was there and opposed it and Albert lost it.&quot;

It did not matter; Avery defeated Miller and became the Representative to the First Congressional District of Kansas in 1955. Many of the Republican members in the United States House of Representatives were inexperienced, which allowed Avery to climb up the ranks quickly. In just his second term, William Avery was able to work in the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee and the Rules Committee. Avery believed that he was seen more as a vote than a member, in regards to many of the older Congressmen. &quot;They all said nice things and said they were glad I was there and that gave the Republicans one nearer to the majority than it was before. I don&#x27;t know whether my physical presence meant much to them but my being there meant something to them.&quot; Avery voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, and 1964, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

Eisenhower had taken the Milford Reservoir out of the budget. Now, President Harry Truman had re-appropriated budget money to the project. Avery felt it was his obligation to get this taken out of the budget. He wrote and elegant speech and delivered it to Congress; to no avail. &quot;Cliff Hope was the only congressman from Kansas that voted with me. The other four – Errett P. Scrivner, Edward H. Rees, Wint Smith, and Myron V. George – all voted for the reservoir. I was kind of mad at the time.&quot;

==Running for Governor==
Representative William Avery was ready to run for the Governorship in 1965. In an early 
campaign speech, Avery told Kansas what he wanted to be as their Governor. &quot;I want to be the number one salesman for Kansas.&quot; I tied that to, &quot;A job for every young lady and young man graduating from our Kansas schools.&quot;

Avery also backed a plan that would give statutory state aid to elementary and secondary schools. &quot;The state aid has been a lifesaver for them because they were strictly relying on an ad valorem tax and they had about reached their limit on that. Now they are providing an educational opportunity for lots of students that never would have had a chance to go to an institution of higher learning. I say that the principal decision I made [as governor] was state aid to education.&quot;

Not only had Avery helped state aid to elementary and secondary schools, but also helped establish new help for community colleges. The &quot;war babies&quot; were coming to the age where they would be attending college, many were worried if there would be enough resources to accommodate these students. Avery met with Kansas State University President Jim McCain to discuss the topic. McCain said, &quot;Bill [Avery], we need state support for junior colleges. The war babies, they are just hitting the college level now. We&#x27;re out of space, we&#x27;re out of teachers. And some of these students are coming here before they are ready for a four-year college. And instead of opposing that I think you should support junior colleges so they can prepare some of these students for leaving home and adjusting to the curriculum that we have on the collegiate level in Kansas.&quot;

Avery was very proud of what his reform did, and how it has weathered the test of time. Avery said, &quot;They didn&#x27;t repeal any of them. They didn&#x27;t repeal the withholding tax and didn&#x27;t repeal the increase in the sales tax. That provided the support for the education programs. Even though none where repealed, that did not change public sentiment towards the raising of their taxes.&quot;

==Bid for reelection==
Governor William Avery&#x27;s bid for reelection took place in 1966. Avery was the Republican incumbent to the Governorship and was seeking reelection during a time where he had raised taxes, a big no-no to the Kansas citizens.

His opponent was Democrat Robert Docking. Seeing as Avery&#x27;s tax hike was controversial, Docking ran on a tax reduction platform. Docking&#x27;s running strategy focused less on what his policies were, and more on the unpopular policies of Avery. During the summer before the election, Avery&#x27;s approval rating was 46%.

Towards the end of his campaign, Avery began coming up with gimmicks for reelection. &quot;At the end of the campaign the incumbent governor was looking for anything to help, including doing two hours of &quot;Ask Avery&quot; TV five days before the election, where he took questions from viewers across the state.&quot;

Avery lost his bid for reelection, 380,030 to 304,325. There were many reasons Avery believed he lost the election. &quot;On election night Avery blamed the tax issues for his loss, but also noted that voters were frustrated over national problems such as inflation, rising crime rates, the Vietnam War, and student protests. Avery also believed that Kansans continued to be frustrated by school district unification which occurred during Governor John Anderson&#x27;s term, but which Avery believed had a strong negative lingering effect on him.&quot;

==Legacy==
At the time of his death, he was the second oldest living governor of any state behind Albert Rosellini of Washington and was the oldest living former U.S. Representative following the September 25, 2008, death of Glenn Andrews of Alabama. Avery&#x27;s death left former New York Representative William F. Walsh as the oldest living former House member.

<text>The 104th Infantry Division was an infantry division of the United States Army. Today, it is known as the 104th Training Division (Leader Training) and based at Fort Lewis, Washington, as a training unit of the United States Army Reserve.

Activated in 1921 and deployed during World War II, the division saw almost 200 days of fighting in northwestern Europe as it fought through France, Netherlands, Belgium, and western Germany, fighting back several fierce German counterattacks as it advanced through the theater throughout late 1944 and 1945. This was the only combat duty that the 104th Infantry Division has served during its history. At the end of the fighting on 7 May 1945 (V-E Day), this division was in central Germany opposite the troops of its allies from the Soviet Army.

After World War II, this division was reorganized primarily as a training division for Reserve forces. After several decades, the division then expanded its role to conducting entry-level training for soldiers of all branches of the Army in the northwestern United States. Its role and size have expanded over that time due to the consolidation of other training commands, and the division subsequently took charge of a number of brigades specializing in various entry-level training for soldiers of all types.

==History==

===Interwar period===

The 104th Division was constituted in the Organized Reserve on 24 June 1921, allotted to the Ninth Corps Area, and assigned to the XIX Corps. The division was allocated to the states of Utah, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming as its home area, although the 2nd Battalion, 413th Infantry was organized at Reno, Nevada. The division headquarters was organized on 7 October 1921 at Fort Douglas, Utah, and relocated in May 1923 to Room 312 in the Commercial Building in Salt Lake City. The headquarters was moved on 30 September 1926 to the Vermont Building where it remained until activated for World War II. To maintain communications with the officers of the division, the division staff published a newsletter titled “Frontier Division,” which was reflective of the unit&#x27;s geographical area. The newsletter informed the division&#x27;s members what the division&#x27;s summer training quotas were, where the camps were to be held, and which units would be assigned to help conduct the Citizens Military Training Camps (CMTC).

For the few summers when the division headquarters was called to duty for training as a unit, the 104th Division usually trained with the staff of the 3rd Division&#x27;s 6th Infantry Brigade at Fort Douglas. The subordinate infantry regiments of the division held their summer training primarily with the units of the 3rd Division at Fort Douglas and Fort Missoula, Montana, and some years with the 2nd Division&#x27;s 4th Infantry Brigade at the Pole Mountain Military Reservation, Wyoming. Other units, however, such as the special troops, artillery, engineers, aviation, medical, and quartermaster, trained at various posts in the Ninth Corps Area with Regular Army units of the same branch. For example, the 329th Engineer Regiment usually trained with elements of the 3rd Division&#x27;s 6th Engineer Regiment at Camp Lewis, Washington, and the 329th Medical Regiment trained at the post hospital at Fort Francis E. Warren, Wyoming. In addition to the unit training camps, the infantry regiments of the division rotated responsibility to conduct the CMTC held at Camp Lewis each year.

On a number of occasions, the division participated in Ninth Corps Area and Fourth Army command post exercises in conjunction with other Regular Army, National Guard, and Organized Reserve units. These training events gave division staff officers’ opportunities to practice the roles they would be expected to perform in the event the division was mobilized. Unlike the Regular and Guard units in the Ninth Corps Area, however, the 104th Division did not participate in the various Ninth Corps Area maneuvers and the major Fourth Army maneuvers of 1936 and 1940 as an organized unit due to lack of enlisted personnel and equipment. Instead, the officers and a few enlisted reservists were assigned to the Regular and Guard units to fill vacant slots and bring the units up to full peace strength for the exercises. Additionally, some officers were assigned duties as umpires or as support personnel.

===World War II===

Before Organized Reserve infantry divisions were ordered into active military service, they were reorganized on paper as &quot;triangular&quot; divisions under the 1940 tables of organization. The headquarters companies of the two infantry brigades were consolidated into the division&#x27;s cavalry reconnaissance troop, and one infantry regiment was removed by inactivation. The field artillery brigade headquarters and headquarters battery became the headquarters and headquarters battery of the division artillery. Its three field artillery regiments were reorganized into four battalions; one battalion was taken from each of the two 75 mm gun regiments to form two 105 mm howitzer battalions, the brigade&#x27;s ammunition train was reorganized as the third 105 mm howitzer battalion, and the 155 mm howitzer battalion was formed from the 155 mm howitzer regiment. The engineer, medical, and quartermaster regiments were reorganized into battalions. In 1942, divisional quartermaster battalions were split into ordnance light maintenance companies and quartermaster companies, and the division&#x27;s headquarters and military police company, which had previously been a combined unit, was split. The 104th Infantry Division was ordered into active military service on 15 September 1942 under the command of Major General Gilbert R. Cook, and was reorganized as the 104th Infantry Division at Camp Adair, Oregon. The division earned its nickname &quot;Timberwolf Division&quot; from its time in the northwest.

The 104th was the first U.S. Army division to be trained to fight in nighttime conditions. After training at Camp Adair, the division participated in the Oregon Maneuver combat exercise in the fall of 1943. On 15 October 1943, Major General Terry de la Mesa Allen Sr. took command of the division. He had previously commanded the 1st Infantry Division, &quot;The Big Red One&quot;, in North Africa and Sicily and would command the 104th during most of its time in combat. On 7 December 1943, the division moved to, and began 13 weeks of desert training at Camp Hyder, Arizona. The division concluded training on 9 February 1944, and next moved to Camp Granite, California. One last move in March to Camp Carson, Colorado, aboard 24 trains was followed with a cross-county move to Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, arriving on 20 August 1944.

====Europe====
The 104th Infantry Division sailed for the Western Front on 27 August 1944. It landed in France on 7 September 1944. The division was assigned to III Corps of the Ninth United States Army, part of the Twelfth United States Army Group. The division then organized and assembled at Manche, France before heading into combat.

Joining the Battle of the Scheldt, the division moved into defensive positions in the vicinity of Wuustwezel, Belgium on 23 October 1944. The Timberwolves were then assigned to Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery&#x27;s Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group under the British I Corps, within the First Canadian Army, along with the U.S. 7th Armored Division, in order to clear out the Scheldt Estuary and open the port of Antwerp. While the U.S. 7th Armored Division was assigned static duty holding the right flank of the gains made during the failed Market Garden operation, the 104th Infantry Division was to participate in the First Canadian Army&#x27;s taking of the Scheldt. The Timberwolves travelled across France by train and debarked near the Belgian-Dutch border and waited for word to take part in a new allied offensive, Operation Pheasant, taking the place of the experienced British 49th Infantry Division on the left flank and the Polish 1st Armored Division on the right.

The Americans were given responsibility for taking 22 miles of wet, low country from the Belgian border to the Meuse (&quot;Maas&quot;). The width of their front was approximately 8,000 yards. General Allen planned to employ all three of his regiments at the same time, shoulder to shoulder. The 104th began combat operations on 25 and 26 October and began to attack the Germans, who offered varying levels of resistance. Along the division&#x27;s front, the Germans were spread thinly and did not have continuous lines of defense. However, they did possess deadly strong points and endeavored to make the Timberwolves&#x27; progress as time-consuming and costly as possible, making heavy use of mines, booby traps, and roadblocks. Despite this, the advance was steady, though paid for in the lives of the 104th Division soldiers. Conditions were rainy, chilly, wet, and muddy. Moisture seemed to grip everything and everyone. Sleet beat down on the troops, who went for days soaked to the skin and slimy with mud. On 30 October, after five days of continuous operations the division had pushed about 15 miles to within sight of the Mark River and had liberated Zundert, gained control of the Breda-Roosendaal Road, and overrun the Vaart Canal defenses. Leur and Etten fell as the division advanced to the Mark River, arriving there by 31 October. A coordinated attack over the Mark River at Standdaarbuiten on 2 November established a bridgehead and the rest of the division crossed the river. With the Allies firmly on the north side of the Mark River, German resistance collapsed. For the next two days, the Timberwolves pursued enemy remnants north to the Meuse. Zevenbergen was captured and the Meuse was reached on 5 November. That same day, General Allen received orders from the U.S. First Army, releasing it from Canadian control. While the bulk of the division moved near Aachen, Germany, elements remained to secure Moerdijk until 7 November, when they were relieved. During this time, the division was reassigned to VII Corps of the U.S. 1st Army, also part of the Twelfth Army Group. By 7 November, the fighting in the Netherlands cost the Timberwolves 1,426 casualties, including 313 killed and 103 missing. Montgomery and the Canadian commanders sent their congratulations, and General Allen disseminated copies of their letters to his regiments and wrote a personal letter of thanks to everyone in the division, concluding with his favorite motto, &quot;Nothing in Hell must stop the Timberwolves!&quot; As a result of the actions of the 104th and their Allied counterparts, the Scheldt Estuary was cleared. The Royal Navy took three weeks to sweep the estuary waters clear of mines, and in early December 1944, the port of Antwerp was open to Allied shipping.

While under American command on 16 November 1944, the division went on another offensive in support of Operation Queen, taking Stolberg and pushing on against heavy resistance. Eschweiler fell on 21 November and the enemy was cleared from the area west of the Inde River, including Inden by 2 December 1944. Lucherberg was held against enemy counterattacks on 3 December, and all strongholds west of the Roer River were captured by the 23rd. It took temporary command of the 60th Infantry Regiment of the 9th Infantry Division. During the Battle of the Bulge, the 104th actively defended its sector near Duren and Merken (in German only) from 15 December 1944 to 22 February 1945. During that time, it was reassigned to XIX Corps of the Ninth United States Army. It then moved across the Roer taking Huchem-Stammeln, Birkesdorf, and North Duren.

On 5 March, after heavy fighting, it entered Köln. After defending the west bank of the Rhine River, the division crossed the river at Honnef on 22 March 1945, and attacked to the east of the Remagen bridgehead. During this time, some of the division&#x27;s assets fell under command of the 1st Infantry Division and the 3rd Armored Division.

After a period of mopping up and consolidation, it participated in the trap of enemy troops in the Ruhr pocket. The 104th repulsed heavy attacks near Medebach and captured Paderborn on 1 April 1945. After regrouping, it advanced to the east and crossed the Weser River on 8 April, blocking enemy exits from the Harz Mountains. On 11 April 1945 the Division was involved in the liberation of a large German concentration camp at Nordhausen. The division then crossed the Saale River and took Halle in a bitter five-day struggle from 15 to 19 April. The sector to the Mulde River was cleared by 21 April, and after vigorous patrolling, contacted the Red Army at Pretzsch on 26 April. The division took temporary command of assets from the 69th Infantry Division in early May.

The division returned to the United States on 3 July 1945, where it began making preparations for deployment to the Pacific Theater. After Japan surrendered, the division began the process of demobilization. The division was inactivated at Camp San Luis Obispo, California on 20 December 1945.

During World War II, soldiers of the division were awarded two Medals of Honor, 14 Distinguished Service Crosses, one Distinguished Service Medal, 642 Silver Star Medals, six Legion of Merit medals, 20 Soldier&#x27;s Medals, 2,797 Bronze Star Medals, and 40 Air Medals. The division received 9 Distinguished Unit Citations and three campaign streamers during 200 days of combat.

===Training Division===
The division was reactivated on 1 December 1946 in the organized reserves in Portland, Oregon. It began taking on the responsibility of holding training programs for new soldiers of the US Army Reserve. In July 1948, the division held its first session of summer training. By the end of the training, it had turned out 300 new reservists. By 1952, the division was turning out 1,500 new reservists per training camp. The division was reorganized specifically as a training division in 1959. In 1961, the division was relocated to Vancouver Barracks, Washington.

In 1967, the division was reorganized. As part of an army-wide initiative known as the Reorganization Objective Army Division plan, the division&#x27;s regiments were disbanded and replaced with larger and more versatile brigades. The 1st Brigade, 104th Division, activated at Vancouver Barracks, and the 2nd Brigade, 104th Division activated at Pasco, Washington. Meanwhile, the 3rd Brigade, 104th Division, as well as the 4th Brigade, 104th Division both activated at Fort Lawton, Washington. Each of these brigades carried the history of other historic units which fought under the 104th Infantry Division in World War II. The 104th Division was then assigned the mission of conducting One Station Unit Training, Basic Combat Training, Advanced Individual Training, and Combat Support training. 1st Brigade took on basic combat training, while 3rd Brigade undertook combat support training, 4th Brigade conducted combat service support training.

In 1996, three more brigades were added to the division&#x27;s structure. The 5th Brigade, 104th Division was activated at Salt Lake City, Utah. The 6th Brigade, 104th Division was activated at Aurora, Colorado. The 7th Brigade, 104th Division activated at Vancouver, Washington. The 5th Brigade conducted health services training, 6th Brigade took charge of professional development training and 7th Brigade provided training support to the other brigades. These units were redesignated from other training commands and put under the command of the division.
Two additional provisional brigades were created under the 104th Division in 1999; the 8th Brigade, 104th Division was created at Fort Lewis as a unit for training Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps cadets, and the 4690th US Army Reserve Forces School at Fort Shafter, Hawaii was redesignated as the 4690th Brigade, 104th Division, for service as a multifunctional training unit. In 2005, the Base Realignment and Closure suggestions included the closure of the Vancouver Barracks, and the 104th Division was subsequently relocated to Fort Lewis, Washington. In 2005, the current Distinctive Unit Insignia was designed under the direction of Major General Terrill K. (TK) Moffett. The 104th received its new distinctive unit insignia in 2006.

In October 2007, the division was renamed the 104th Training Division (Leader Training). This change reflected a change in the division&#x27;s mission, specifically training officer and non-commissioned officer candidates in their assigned fields.

<text>The Bhimbetka rock shelters are an archaeological site in central India that spans the Paleolithic and Mesolithic periods, as well as the historic period. It exhibits the earliest traces of human life in India and evidence of the Stone Age starting at the site in Acheulian times. It is located in the Raisen District in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, about south-east of Bhopal. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that consists of seven hills and over 750 rock shelters distributed over . At least some of the shelters were inhabited more than 100,000 years ago. 

The rock shelters and caves provide evidence of human settlement and the cultural evolution from hunter-gatherers to agriculture, and expressions of prehistoric spirituality.

Some of the Bhimbetka rock shelters feature prehistoric cave paintings and the earliest are dated to 10,000 BCE, corresponding to the Indian Mesolithic. These cave paintings show themes such as animals, early evidence of dance and hunting from the Stone Age as well as of warriors on horseback from a later time (perhaps the Bronze Age). The Bhimbetka site has the oldest-known rock art in India, as well as is one of the largest prehistoric complexes.

== Location ==
The Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka are 45 kilometers south-east of Bhopal and 9  km from Obedullaganj city in the Raisen District of Madhya Pradesh at the southern edge of the Vindhya Range. South of these rock shelters are successive ranges of the Satpura hills. It is inside the &quot;Ratapani Wildlife Sanctuary&quot;, embedded in sandstone rocks, in the foothills of the Vindhya Range. The site consists of seven hills: Vinayaka, Bhonrawali, Bhimbetka, Lakha Juar (east and west), Jhondra and Muni Babaki Pahari.

== Background ==

=== Etymology ===

Bhimbetka meaning &quot;Bhima&#x27;s resting place&quot; or &quot;Bhima&#x27;s lounge&quot;, is compound word made of &quot;Bhima&quot; (second brother among the five Pandavas of Mahabharata) and &quot;Baithaka&quot; (seat or lounge). According to the native belief, Bhima during his exile used to rest here to interact with the locals. Bhima Worshiped Mata Vaishavi at this location and blessed for concurring the forthcoming war. There is a famous Mata Vaishavi Temple existing at this place since long. 

=== History ===

W. Kincaid, a British India era official, first mentioned Bhimbetka in a scholarly paper in 1888. He relied on the information he gathered from adivasis (tribals) about Bhojpur lake in the area and referred to Bhimbetka as a Buddhist site. The first archaeologist to visit a few caves at the site and discover its prehistoric significance was V. S. Wakankar, who saw these rock formations and thought these were similar to those he had seen in Spain and France. He visited the area with a team of archaeologists and reported several prehistoric rock shelters in 1957.

It was only in the 1970s that the scale and true significance of the Bhimbetka rock shelters was discovered and reported. Since then, more than 750 rock shelters have been identified. The Bhimbetka group contains 243 of these, while the Lakha Juar group nearby has 178 shelters. According to Archaeological Survey of India, the evidence suggests that there has been a continuous human settlement here from the Stone Age through the late Acheulian to the late Mesolithic until the 2nd century BCE in these caves. This information is based on the findings from the excavation of the site, the unearthed artifacts and goods, pigments present in deposits, as well as the rock paintings.

The site contains the world&#x27;s oldest stone walls and floors.

The origin of the raw materials utilized in certain monoliths uncovered at Bhimbetka has been traced back to Barkheda.

The site consisting of 1,892 hectares was declared as protected under Indian laws and came under the management of the Archaeological Survey of India in 1990. It was declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2003.

== Auditorium cave ==
Of the numerous shelters, the Auditorium cave is one of the significant features of this site. Surrounded by quartzite towers which are visible from several kilometres&#x27; distance, the Auditorium rock is the largest shelter at Bhimbetka. Robert G. Bednarik describes the prehistoric Auditorium cave as one with a &quot;cathedral-like&quot; atmosphere, with &quot;its Gothic arches and soaring spaces&quot;. Its plan resembles a &quot;right-angled cross&quot; with four of its branches aligned to the four cardinal directions. The main entrance points to the east. At the end of this eastern passage, at the cave&#x27;s entrance, is a boulder with a near-vertical panel that is distinctive, one visible from distance and all directions. In archaeology literature, this boulder has been dubbed as &quot;Chief&#x27;s Rock&quot; or &quot;King&#x27;s Rock&quot;, though there is no evidence of any rituals or its role as such. The boulder with the Auditorium cave is the central feature of the Bhimbetka, midst its 754 numbered shelters spread over few kilometres on either side, and nearly 500 locations where rock paintings can be found, states Bednarik.

== Rock art and paintings ==

The rock shelters and caves of Bhimbetka have a large number of paintings. Some of the oldest paintings are dated to 10,000 BCE, but some of the geometric figures date to as recently as the medieval period. The drawings and paintings can be classified under seven different periods. V. S. Wakankar classified the drawings and paintings into seven different periods and dated the earliest paintings to have belonged to the upper Palaeolithic to be as early as 40,000 years ago. The colours used are vegetable colours which have endured through time because the drawings were generally made deep inside a niche or on inner walls.

Period I – (Upper Paleolithic): These are linear representations in green of humans dancing and hunting.

Period II – (Mesolithic): Comparatively small in size the stylised figures in this group show linear decorations on the body. In addition to animals there are human figures and hunting scenes, giving a clear picture of the weapons they used: barbed spears, pointed sticks, bows and arrows. Some scenes are interpreted as depicting tribal war between three tribes symbolised by their animal totems. The depiction of communal dances, birds, musical instruments, mothers and children, pregnant women, men carrying dead animals, drinking and burials appear in rhythmic movement.

Period III – (Chalcolithic) Similar to the paintings of the Mesolithic, these drawings reveal that during this period the cave dwellers of this area were in contact with the agricultural communities of the Malwa plains, exchanging goods with them.

Period IV &amp; V – (Early historic): The figures of this group have a schematic and decorative style and are painted mainly in red, white and yellow. The association is of riders, depiction of religious symbols, tunic-like dresses and the existence of scripts of different periods. The religious beliefs are represented by figures of yakshas, tree gods and magical sky chariots.

Period VI &amp; VII – (Medieval): These paintings are geometric linear and more schematic, but they show degeneration and crudeness in their artistic style. The colors used by the cave dwellers were prepared by combining black manganese oxides, red hematite and charcoal.

One rock, popularly referred to as &quot;Zoo Rock&quot;, depicts elephants, barasingha (swamp deer), bison and deer. Paintings on another rock show a peacock, a snake, a deer and the sun. On another rock, two elephants with tusks are painted. Hunting scenes with hunters carrying bows, arrows, swords, and shields also find their place in the community of these pre-historic paintings. In one of the caves, a bison is shown in pursuit of a hunter while his two companions appear to stand helplessly nearby; in another, some horsemen are seen, along with archers. In one painting, a large wild bovine (possibly a gaur or bison) is seen.

Yashodhar Mathpal has conducted a very careful study of the various animals depicted in these rock shelters. He has identified sloth bear, wolf, hyaena, rhinoceros, wild cattle, deer, antelopes, hare, monkeys, anteater, rats, fish, turtle, peafowl, some birds without any details among the wild animals and a domesticated dog. Deer and antelope are amongst the most numerous of the wild animals depicted. The pictures include groups of hunters;  one such group is depicted as running away from a rhinoceros. Other groups are engaged in hunting deer, antelopes and other prey. Spear and bow and arrow are the main weapons of hunt; fish and turtle are being caught in a net, and rats are being driven out of their burrows to be caught. The paintings are classified largely in two groups, one as depictions of hunters and food gatherers, and in others as fighters, riding on horses and elephant carrying metal weapons. The first group of paintings date to prehistoric times while second one dates to historic times. Most of the paintings from the historic period depict battles between rulers carrying swords, spears, bows and arrows.

In one of the desolate rock shelters, the painting of a man holding a trident-like staff and dancing has been nicknamed &quot;Nataraj&quot; by archaeologist V. S. Wakankar. It is estimated that paintings in at least 100 rock shelters might have eroded away.
== &quot;&quot;Dickinsonia&quot; fossils&quot; ==
Fossils of &quot;Dickinsonia tenuis&quot;, an early animal from the Ediacaran Period, were reported from Bhimbetka; they were said to be identical with &quot;D. tenuis&quot; fossils from the Ediacara Member of Ediacara Hills in South Australia. From this, several paleogeographic conclusions were made, such as the formation of Gondwanaland by 550 million years ago. However, later examination showed that the purported fossil material was simply decayed remnants of a beehive.

== Similar sites in India==
Some Mesolithic sites with cave art, tools, paintings, etc are Anangpur caves (Faridabad) and Mangar Bani Caves (Gurugram) in Delhi NCR, and Pahargarh caves (Morena) in Madhya Pradesh.

<text>In ancient times, trade between the Indian subcontinent and Greece flourished with silk, spices and gold being traded. The Greeks invaded South Asia several times, starting with the conquest of Alexander the Great and later with the Indo-Greek Kingdom.

==Legend of the God Bacchus in Ancient India==
A legendary account states that when the Greek God Bacchus/Dionysus grew up, he discovered the culture of the vine and the mode of extracting its precious juice, being the first to do so; but Hera struck him with madness, and drove him forth a wanderer through various parts of the earth. In Phrygia the goddess Cybele, better known to the Greeks as Rhea, cured him and taught him her religious rites, and he set out on a progress through Asia teaching the people the cultivation of the vine. The most famous part of his wanderings is his expedition to the Indian subcontinent, which is said to have lasted several years fighting a king known as Deriades. According to a legend, when Alexander the Great reached a city called Nysa near the Indus River, the locals said that their city was founded by Dionysus in the distant past and their city was dedicated to the god Dionysus. These travels took something of the form of military conquests; according to Diodorus Siculus he conquered the whole world except for Britain and Ethiopia. Returning in triumph (he was considered the founder of the triumphal procession) he undertook to introduce his worship into Greece, but was opposed by some princes who dreaded its introduction on account of the disorders and madness it brought with it (e.g. Pentheus or Lycurgus).

==Conquests of Alexander the Great (327–326 BC)==


In 327 BC Alexander the Great began his foray into Punjab. King Ambhi, ruler of Taxila, surrendered the city to Alexander. Many people had fled to a high fortress/rock called Aornos. Alexander took Aornos by storm after a successful siege. Alexander fought an epic battle against the ancient Indian monarch Porus in the Battle of Hydaspes (326). 

East of Porus&#x27; kingdom, near the Ganges River, was the powerful kingdom of Magadha, under the Nanda Dynasty.

According to Plutarch, at the time of Alexander&#x27;s Battle of the Hydaspes River, Magadha&#x27;s army further east numbered 200,000 infantry, 80,000 cavalry, 8,000 chariots, and 6,000 war elephants, which was discouraging for Alexander&#x27;s men and stayed their further progress into the Indian subcontinent:
As for the Macedonians, however, their struggle with Porus blunted their courage and stayed their further advance into India. For having had all they could do to repulse an enemy who mustered only twenty thousand infantry and two thousand horse, they violently opposed Alexander when he insisted on crossing the river Ganges also, the width of which, as they learned, was •thirty-two furlongs, its depth •a hundred fathoms, while its banks on the further side were covered with multitudes of men-at‑arms and horsemen and elephants. For they were told that the kings of the Ganderites and Praesii were awaiting them with eighty thousand horsemen, two hundred thousand footmen, eight thousand chariots, and six thousand fighting elephants. And there was no boasting in these reports. For Androcottus, who reigned there not long afterwards, made a present to Seleucus of five hundred elephants, and with an army of six hundred thousand men overran and subdued all India.
&lt;br&gt; --&quot;Plutarch, Parallel Lives, &quot;Life of Alexander&quot; &quot;

Exhausted and frightened by the prospect of facing another giant Indian army at the Ganges River, his army mutinied at the Hyphasis (modern Beas), refusing to march further east. Alexander, after meeting his officer Coenus, was convinced that it was better to return.

Alexander was forced to turn south, conquering his way down the Indus to the Arabian Sea. He sent much of his army to Carmania (modern southern Iran) with his general Craterus, and commissioned a fleet to explore the Persian Gulf shore under his admiral Nearchus, while he led the rest of his forces back to Persia by the southern route through Gedrosia (modern Makran in southern Pakistan).

Alexander left behind Greek forces which established themselves in the city of Taxila, now in Pakistan. Several generals, such as Eudemus and Peithon governed the newly established province until around 316 BC. One of them, Sophytes (305–294 BC), was an independent Indian prince in the Punjab.

==Seleucid (305 BC)==

Alexander&#x27;s army mutinied along the Hyphasis, as Alexander died before he could make a conquest in fighting the Nanda Empire, making the Beas River the eastern border of the Macedonian Empire.

Following Alexander&#x27;s death, Seleucus I Nicator, founder of the Seleucid dynasty and former Diadochi, gained control over Mesopotamia and the eastern satraps of the former Macedonian Empire. Seleucus unsuccessfully tried to campaign in India by invading what is now Punjab in northern India and Pakistan in 305 BC.

Meanwhile, in India, Chandragupta Maurya, the founder of the Maurya Empire with the help of Chanakya his mentor and political advisor, rose to power by overthrowing the Nanda Empire in Pataliputra. His next course of action was to lead his armies into the Indus to battle with the Seleucid Empire and annex the satraps. The Seleucid-Mauryan War waged on for over two years, resulting in significant territorial and political change in the region. To resolve the conflict both parties finally settled upon a marriage alliance. Chandragupta annexed the Greek satraps, while also gaining the daughter of Seleucus in marriage. In exchange Basileus Seleucus received 500 prized war elephant from the Indian Emperor, an asset which was used to decisively win the Battle of Ipsus.
Seleucus also sent an ambassador named Megasthenes to Chandragupta&#x27;s court, who repeatedly visited Chandragupta&#x27;s capital of Pataliputra (modern Patna in Bihar state). Megasthenes wrote detailed descriptions of India and Chandragupta&#x27;s reign.

Continued diplomatic exchanges and good relations between the Seleucids and the Mauryan emperors are then documented throughout the duration of the Mauryan empire.

==Indo-Greek rule (180 BC – 10 AD)==

In 180 BC, the Indo-Greeks, invaded parts of northwest and northern India and ruled in the Punjab region. They are an extension of the Greco-Bactrian dynasty of Greek kings (the Euthydemids) located in neighbouring Bactria.

The invasion of northern India followed the destruction of the Mauryan dynasty by the general Pushyamitra Shunga, who then founded the new Indian Shunga dynasty (185 BC-78 BC). The Indo-Greek king Menander may have campaigned as far as the capital Pataliputra in eastern India (today Patna): &quot;Those who came after Alexander went to the Ganges and Pataliputra&quot; (Strabo, XV.698 ).

The Indo-Greeks ruled various parts of north-western South Asia until the end of the 1st century BC, when they were conquered by the Scythians and Kushans.

==Legacy==

Buddhism flourished under the Indo-Greeks, leading to the Greco-Buddhist cultural syncretism. The arts of the Indian sub-continent were also quite affected by Hellenistic art during and after these interactions.

<doc id="812025" wikidata="Q2090584" url="?curid=812025" title="Siege of Mafeking">
<text>The siege of Mafeking was a 217-day siege battle for the town of Mafeking (now called Mahikeng) in South Africa during the Second Boer War from October 1899 to May 1900. The siege received considerable attention as Lord Edward Cecil, the son of the British prime minister, was in the besieged town, as also was Lady Sarah Wilson, a daughter of the Duke of Marlborough and aunt of Winston Churchill. The siege turned the British commander, Colonel Robert Baden-Powell, into a national hero. The Relief of Mafeking (the lifting of the siege), while of little military significance, was a morale boost for the struggling British.

== Prelude ==
Shortly before the outbreak of the Second Boer War in 1899, Lord Wolseley, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army, who had failed to persuade the British government to send troops to the region, instead sent Colonel Robert Baden-Powell, accompanied by a handful of officers, to the Cape Colony to raise two regiments of mounted rifles from Rhodesia. Their aims were to maintain a mobile cavalry force on the frontier with the Boer republics of Transvaal and the Orange Free State.

Like the British government, politicians in South Africa feared that increased military activity might provoke a Boer attack, so the British officers were provided with rifles and ammunition, but no artillery or horses – in those days, generally regarded as quite important for a mobile column. They decided to obtain many of their own stores, organise their own transport and recruit in secret. Although the two regiments were raised in Rhodesia, Baden-Powell chose Mafeking to store supplies for his forces due to its location – both near the border and on the railway between Bulawayo and Kimberley – and because of its status as a local administrative centre. Also, the town had good stocks of food and other necessities. However, Mafeking was isolated, exposed and close to Boer-controlled areas. Baden-Powell, whose orders were to command a highly mobile field force of cavalry, chose to immobilise half his force to hold Mafeking against a Boer attack. Many of Baden-Powell&#x27;s recruits were untrained and he was aware of the Boers&#x27; greatly superior numbers, commando tactics and the failure of the earlier Jameson Raid and decided that the best way to tie down Boer troops would be through defence rather than attack. In August 1899, Baden-Powell started recruiting (in secret, to avoid negative political effects) and many of his recruits were untrained, many had never ridden before, so were unsuited for a &quot;mobile column&quot;. His forces that remained outside the besieged town were well trained, had their own horses, and they performed remarkably well in their intended mobile role.

The forces defending Mafeking totalled about 2,000, including the Protectorate Regiment of about 500 men, about 300 from the Bechuanaland Rifles and the Cape Police and a further 300 men from the town. The British garrison armed 300 African natives with rifles, these were nicknamed the &quot;Black Watch&quot; and used to guard the perimeter. Prior to the siege, Lord Edward Cecil formed the Mafeking Cadet Corps of boys aged 12 to 15 who acted as messengers and orderlies and released men to fight (later claimed to be one of the inspirations for the Boy Scouts).

== Siege ==

Work to build defences around the perimeter of Mafeking started on 19 September 1899; the town would eventually be equipped with an extensive network of trenches and gun emplacements. President Kruger of the Boer South African Republic declared war on 12 October 1899. Under orders of General Piet Cronje the Mafeking railway and telegraph lines were cut the same day, and the town began to be besieged from 13 October. Mafeking was first shelled on 16 October after the British commanders ignored Cronje&#x27;s 9 o’clock deadline to surrender.

Although usually considerably outnumbered by Boer troops, the garrison withstood the siege for 217 days, defying the predictions of the politicians on both sides. In reality, the Boers risked little to tie up Baden-Powell&#x27;s force and stores and for most of the time the number of Boers actively engaged in the siege were few. While at one time the Boer troops numbered over 8,000 and more artillery was briefly brought up, most of these were merely moving through the siege camp. The Boers were able to take control of the railway and roads just outside the town and used the siege camp as a staging post. Baden-Powell remained invested in the town despite repeated orders and, for most of the time until he ate his own horses, having the capacity to break out. But he would still have needed a base from which to operate. With few soldiers, no modern artillery and little risk, the defenders kept as many as 8,000 Boers from deploying to other war fronts in Natal and the Orange Free State. Some authors believe that this has been overattributed to cunning deceptions instituted by Baden-Powell. Fake landmines were laid around the town in view of the Boers and their spies within the town, and his soldiers were ordered to simulate avoiding barbed wire (non-existent) when moving between trenches; guns and a searchlight (improvised from an acetylene lamp and biscuit tin) were moved around the town to increase their apparent number. A howitzer was built in Mafeking&#x27;s railway workshops, and even an old cannon (dated 1770, it coincidentally had &quot;B.P. &amp; Co.&quot; engraved on the barrel) was pressed into service. Noticing that the Boers had failed to remove any of the rails, the British commanders had an armoured train from the Mafeking railyard loaded with sharpshooters, armed with the Martini-Henry Mark IV rifle, sent up the rail line in a daring attack right into the heart of the Boer camp, followed by a return to Mafeking. However, the casualties made this Baden-Powell&#x27;s only attempt at such an attack and, again, it raised questions as to why Baden-Powell did not mount a break-out. Often British soldiers had to dress as women just to undertake normal activities such as fetching water and sewing to deceive the enemy.

The morale of the civilian population was given attention, and Sunday ceasefires were negotiated so that sports, competitions and theatrical performances could be held. Notable were the cricket matches held on a Sunday. Initially, the religious sensibilities of General Jacobus Philippus Snyman (in command after Cronje departed) were offended, and he threatened to fire upon the players if they continued. Eventually Snyman relented and even invited the British to a game. Baden-Powell replied that first he had to finish the present match, in which the score was &quot;200 days, not out&quot;!

As in the case of the nearby siege of Kimberley, the Boers decided that the town was too heavily defended to take. On 19 November 1899, 4,000 Boers were redeployed elsewhere, although the siege remained and shelling of Mafeking continued. Aware of the approaching British relief columns, the Boers launched a final major attack early in the morning of 12 May that succeeded in breaching the perimeter defences and setting fire to some of the town, but were finally beaten back.

===Boer attack===

On 12 May, at about 4 a.m., Field Cornet S. Eloff led a force of 240 Boers in a daring assault on Mafeking. Covered by a feint attack on the east side of the town, the attackers slipped between the Hidden Hollow and Limestone forts on the western face of the defences. Guided by a British deserter, they followed a path beside the Molopo River to where it enters the stadt, the village where the native Africans lived. Eloff&#x27;s party burst into the stadt unopposed and set fire to the huts in order to signal the attack&#x27;s progress to Snyman. By about 5:30 a.m., the Boers seized the police barracks on the outskirts of Mafeking, killing one and capturing the garrison&#x27;s second-in-command, Colonel C. O. Hore and 29 others. Eloff picked up the telephone connected with the British garrison headquarters and boasted to Baden-Powell of his success.

The fire had, however, already alerted Mafeking&#x27;s garrison, which responded rapidly to the crisis. The African police (of the Barolong tribe) had wisely stayed out of the way when Eloff&#x27;s party roared through the stadt. As soon as the Boers moved on, the 109 armed Barolong cut off Eloff&#x27;s escape route. Snyman, &quot;the most stolid and supine of all the Boer generals in the war&quot;, failed to support Eloff. Meanwhile, the elaborate telephone network of the town defences provided timely and accurate information. Major Alick Godley and B Squadron (Protectorate Regiment) were sent to smother the attack and along with D Squadron, some armed railway employees and others. Eloff&#x27;s men were soon isolated into three groups.

With two squadrons, Godley first surrounded a group of Boers holed up in a stone kraal in the stadt. These men surrendered after a sharp fusillade. Godley drove the second group off a kopje and they mostly managed to escape. All day long, Eloff and the third group held out in the police barracks, finally capitulating in the night. The British lost 12 dead and 8 wounded, mostly Africans. Boer losses were 60 dead and wounded, plus a further 108 captured.

===Stamps and currency===
One curious factor that was unexpected was that the Post Office ran out of stamps, and there was a shortage of bank notes for the people to use in everyday dealings. The Postmaster suggested to Baden-Powell that he commission the local printer to print stamps, for use within the town. Baden-Powell agreed to this, but the printer, not wishing to encroach on the Royal Mail&#x27;s prerogative, decided to use a picture of the Commanding Officer, Baden-Powell, instead of that of Queen Victoria. This was the first occasion where a non-royal&#x27;s picture was used on a British postage stamp. Two stamps were issued,
* a one-penny, with a photograph of Cadet Sgt. Major Goodyear on a bicycle, designed by Dr W. A. Hayes, and

Similarly, to ease the problems caused by the lack of genuine banknotes, in late 1899 Baden-Powell authorised the issue of siege banknotes. Made by Townshend &amp; Son, Printers () using woodcut printing, notes were backed by the Standard Bank of South Africa and issued in denominations of one-, two-, three- and 10-shilling coupons as well as £1 notes, of which 620 were printed. The intention was that, after the siege was over, these could be exchanged for genuine currency, but in practice few were; most were kept as souvenirs. The printer believed that perhaps only 20 would be cashed in, making a £600 profit for the Imperial exchequer. They currently sell for around £1500 each but are rarely sold.

Each note has the facsimile signatures of Robert Urry, the manager of the Mafeking branch of the Standard Bank of South Africa. and Captain Herbert Greener, Chief Paymaster of the British South Africa Police. Redemption of the notes ended in 1908.

=== Relief ===
The siege was finally lifted on 17 May 1900, when a flying column of some 2,000 British soldiers, including many South African volunteers from Kimberley, commanded by Colonel B. T. Mahon of the army of Lord Roberts with Prince Alexander of Teck as his Aide-de-camp, relieved the town after fighting their way in.

==Aftermath==

Until reinforcements landed in February 1900, the war was going poorly for the British. The resistance to the siege was seen as one of the positive highlights in the media, and it and the eventual relief of the town excited the liveliest sympathy in Britain. There were immense celebrations in the country at the news of its relief, described humorously as &#x27;mafficking&#x27; and creating the verb &quot;to maffick&quot;, as a back-formation from the place-name (meaning to celebrate both extravagantly and publicly). Promoted to the youngest major-general in the army, and awarded the CB, Baden-Powell was also treated as a hero when he finally returned to Britain in 1903.

However, the remaining stores that Baden-Powell had amassed in Mafeking were so great that they were able to re-supply Mahon&#x27;s force and operations in the area for some time. While a sorely needed publicity victory for the British, the British commanders believed Baden-Powell had been foolish to risk so many supplies and allow himself to be besieged and had made no effort to break out and had overstated the number of Boer forces tied up while in fact tying up considerably more British forces. For Baden-Powell, and in the British media, the siege was thought of as a victory, but for the more practical Boers it had been a strategic success. For no significant achievement, the townspeople and garrison suffered 212 killed and over 600 wounded. For the British Army commanders, it was a distraction and nuisance and, after Baden-Powell&#x27;s further poor combat performance in completely abandoning the mostly Rhodesian soldiers and Australian diggers at Elands River, Baden-Powell was removed from any combat command.

Three Victoria Crosses were awarded as a result of acts of heroism during the siege, to Sergeant Horace Martineau and Trooper Horace Ramsden for acts during an attack on the Boer &quot;Game Tree Fort&quot;, and to Captain Charles FitzClarence for Game Tree and two previous actions.

In September 1904 Lord Roberts unveiled an obelisk at Mafeking bearing the names of those who fell in defence of the town.
The siege established Baden-Powell as a celebrity in Britain, and when he wrote &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot; in 1908, his fame contributed to the rapid growth of the Boy Scout Movement.

<text>Karl Sverkersson or Charles VII ( – 12 April 1167) was the ruler of Götaland, and then King of Sweden from to 1167, when he was assassinated in a military attack by Knut Eriksson who then succeeded him as king.

==Pretender to the throne==
Karl was the son of King Sverker the Elder, who was assassinated in December 1156, by first wife Ulvhild Håkansdotter. A pretender from another family, Erik Jedvardsson (whom later generations dubbed martyr and saint), ruled over parts of Sweden in the following years. However, Karl was chosen king by the people of Östergötland in , apparently in opposition to Erik. A letter from pope Hadrianus IV () knows him as ruler of &quot;regnum Gothorum&quot; although Erik is known to have held power in Västergötland. It is claimed in a late medieval chronicle that Erik&#x27;s murder by minions of their rival Magnus Henriksen in 1160 was also backed by Karl.

Magnus Henriksen had a brief reign after killing Erik, but was himself killed by Karl Sverkersson, probably in 1161 during the battle at Örebro. After the fall of Magnus, Karl received general recognition in Sweden as king. In fact he is the first Swedish ruler to be expressly titled &quot;rex Sweorum et Gothorum&quot; (King of the Swedes and Geats) in a papal letter from 1164.

==Reign==
The brief reign of Karl Sverkersson is important from a number of aspects. The early medieval Swedish kingdom resembled a network of shifting aristocratic alliances rather than a state, but during the second half of the 12th century, it slowly began to converge with the Catholic-European state model. It was during his time that the Archbishop of Uppsala was established, although Sweden was still ecclesiastically subordinated to the Danish archbishop in Lund. After a request by the king, his jarl Ulf, and the Swedish bishops, the pope appointed Stefan, a former monk in Alvastra Abbey, as the first archbishop. Shortly afterwards, the people of Värend at the border to Denmark offered money to the king if he supported the installation of a particular bishop in Växjö. He is also known to have donated land and privileges to Vreta Abbey and Nydala Abbey. The donations suggest that his main interests lay in the provinces of Östergötland and Småland, while the provinces around Lake Mälaren may have been supervised by Ulf Jarl. The first known non-epigraphic document was issued in his time, which also contains the earliest known royal seal.

Swedish relations with the Russian lands had been quite good up to the early 12th century. However, this changed into a state of intermittent hostility during the 12th century. The chronicles of Novgorod relate a sea-borne Swedish invasion in 1164. The invading forces attacked Ladoga, which however received Novgorodian relief forces after five days. The Swedes were thoroughly beaten outside Ladoga on 28 May and lost 43 out of 55 boats. The remnants withdrew.

==Assassination==
In the spring of 1167, King Karl was killed on the island of Visingsö by supporters of Knut Eriksson, head of the rival Eric dynasty. &quot;But his son Sverker was carried to Denmark in the lap, and his journey was miserable.&quot; Knut usurped the throne. Karl Sverkersson was buried in Alvastra monastery. Like the other kings of the House of Sverker, he is lauded by the short chronicle in &quot;Västgöta Law&quot;: &quot;As king, he had his father&#x27;s dignity. He ruled Sweden with gentleness and benevolence.&quot;

Starting from Karl Sverkersson&#x27;s death, his kinsmen (either half-brothers or possibly nephews) &quot;Burislev&quot; and &quot;Kol&quot; together opposed Knut&#x27;s kingship and were rival kings recognized in parts of Götaland. However, the last of them was killed around 1172–1173, after which Knut&#x27;s rule was fully recognized.

== Family ==
Karl&#x27;s wife was Christina Hvide, a Danish lady, daughter of &quot;Stig Hvitaleder&quot;, a magnate from Zealand, and his wife who was sister of Valdemar I of Denmark.

Their sole historically attested child was Sverker Karlsson, a young boy when Karl died, and who later was elected king of Sweden (1195–1208/10) after the death of King Knut Eriksson.

<doc id="812032" wikidata="Q382375" url="?curid=812032" title="Monkey saddle">
<text>In mathematics, the monkey saddle is the surface defined by the equation 
:formula_1
or in cylindrical coordinates
:formula_2

It belongs to the class of saddle surfaces, and its name derives from the observation that a saddle used by a monkey would require two depressions for its legs and one for its tail. The point on the monkey saddle corresponds to a degenerate critical point of the function at . The monkey saddle has an isolated umbilical point with zero Gaussian curvature at the origin, while the curvature is strictly negative at all other points.

One can relate the rectangular and cylindrical equations using complex numbers formula_3

:formula_4

By replacing 3 in the cylindrical equation with any integer one can create a saddle with depressions.
Another orientation of the monkey saddle is the &quot;Smelt petal&quot; defined by formula_5 so that the &quot;z-&quot;axis of the monkey saddle corresponds to the direction in the Smelt petal.

Another function, which has not three but four areas - in each quadrant of the formula_6, in which the function goes to minus infinity, is given by formula_7.

== Horse saddle ==

The term &quot;horse saddle&quot; may be used in contrast to monkey saddle, to designate an ordinary saddle surface in which &quot;z&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) has a saddle point, a local minimum or maximum in every direction of the &quot;xy&quot;-plane.

<text>Varteg () is a village in the county borough of Torfaen in Wales.

== Location ==

It lies near Abersychan on the hills above the valley of the Afon Llwyd, between Pontypool and Blaenavon.

== History and amenities ==
Varteg owes its origin to the fact that the land lease for the Blaenavon Ironworks was too big, and portions were sublet to the Nantyglo Company and part taken up by a partnership called Knight and Company which opened an iron furnace in 1802. By 1825 the Varteg works was taken over by Kenrick and Company which had three blast furnaces, by 1839 there were five furnaces in operation. In 1847 it was owned by Williams and Co with a total of eight furnaces at Varteg, Golynos and Pentwyn. From 1854 to closure in 1868 it was owned by the Golynos Iron Co. After the end of iron making, coal mining became the biggest employer.
Varteg has one of the three Welsh language medium primary school in Torfaen, namely Ysgol Bryn Onnen. The others are Ysgol Gymraeg Cwmbrân, in Cwmbrân, and Ysgol Panteg, in Griffithstown.

It also has a cemetery which dates back to the 18th century.

In 2013, a controversy erupted when Glamorgan Power chose a site for open coal mining 120 metres away from the village&#x27;s primary school, Ysgol Bryn Onnen. The Torfaen council previously rejected the company&#x27;s plans to mine more than 256,000 tonnes of coal from the area, citing Welsh environmental regulations requiring a buffer zone of at least 500 metres around any planned open-cast mining operations. The headmaster of Ysgol Bryn Onnen school, Ryan Parry, spoke against the proposal, citing health concerns and impact on learning.

Also in 2013, the village made international headlines when it was reported the Welsh Language Commissioner had proposed changing the official spelling of the town&#x27;s name to &#x27;Y Farteg&#x27; in-line with Welsh orthography.

<text>A dustcap is a small cover used on the valve stem of a bicycle or car tire to prevent dust or other small particles from entering the valve and damaging it. Dustcaps are usually made from plastic but may occasionally be made of metal. The dustcap is internally threaded and is secured by screwing it onto the end of the stem. To prevent corrosion due to electrolysis and malfunction of the electronics in a direct TPMS and avoid costly repairs, metal valve caps without insulating plastic linings should not be used on direct-TPMS-equipped tire valve stems.

A dustcap may also refer, on a bicycle, to the crankarm bolt cover. It is usually a piece of metal or plastic that, on the crankarm, is snapped or screwed into the threaded counterbore, which houses the bolt that holds the crankarm to its axle, the bottom bracket spindle. The dustcap serves to protect the threads (on the inside of the counterbore), which are used with a crankarm puller to remove the crankarm from the spindle.

A dustcap may also refer, on a bicycle, to the metal ring that covers the bearings in a cup-and-cone ball-bearing hubset.

<text>The minister of external affairs (or simply, the external affairs minister &quot;Hindi:&quot; Videsh Mantri) is the head of the Ministry of External Affairs of the Government of India. One of the senior-most offices in the union cabinet, the chief responsibility of the minister of external affairs is to represent the government of India in the international community and advance its interests on the global stage. As such, the minister plays an important role in shaping and directing the country&#x27;s foreign policy. Typically, the minister is assisted by one or more junior ministers, known as Ministers of State (MoS) for External Affairs.

India&#x27;s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, simultaneously held the post of External Affairs Minister throughout his 17-year premiership and remains the longest-serving External Affairs Minister, followed by S. Jaishankar, the currently serving External Affairs Minister. Several other Prime Ministers have since held the additional charge as the Minister of External Affairs, but never has any other cabinet minister held additional charge of the office - although during Nehru&#x27;s premiership V. K. Krishna Menon was acknowledged as &quot;de facto&quot; minister of external affairs beyond his official designation as defence minister. There have been a number of external affairs ministers who went on to become the prime minister like Atal Bihari Vajpayee, P. V. Narasimha Rao and I. K. Gujral. Two former career-diplomats have served as ministers of external affairs, including K. Natwar Singh (20042005) who served as India&#x27;s ambassador to Poland and as high commissioner to Pakistan, and the current minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar who retired as the foreign secretary. Two other ministers, M. C. Chagla and I. K. Gujral also served as ambassadors, with Chagla serving as India&#x27;s ambassador to the United States and high commissioner to the United Kingdom, while Gujral served as ambassador to the Soviet Union.

The current minister of external affairs is Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, who succeeded Sushma Swaraj of the Bharatiya Janata Party on 30 May 2019.

<doc id="812084" wikidata="Q4236634" url="?curid=812084" title="Kochari">
<text>Kochari (; ; ; ) is a folk dance originating in the Armenian Highlands. It is performed today by Armenians, while variants are performed by Assyrians, Azerbaijanis, and Pontic Greeks. It is a form of circle dance.

Each region in the Armenian Highlands had its own Kochari, with its unique way of both dancing and music.

==Etymology==
*In Armenian, &quot;Kochari&quot; literally means &quot;knee-come&quot;. Գուճ (gudj or goudj) means &quot;knee&quot; and արի (ari) means &quot;come&quot;.
*In Azerbaijani Turkish, &quot;köç&quot; means &quot;to move&quot; used both as a verb and as a noun, with the latter used more in the context of nomads&#x27; travelling. &quot;Köçəri&quot; is also both an adjective and a noun, meaning a &quot;nomad&quot; and &quot;nomadic&quot; simultaneously.
*In Pontic Greek, from the Greek &quot;κότσι&quot; (in Pontic Greek &quot;κοτς&quot;) meaning &quot;heel&quot; (from Medieval Greek &quot;κόττιον&quot; meaning the same) and &quot;αίρω&quot; meaning &quot;raise&quot;, all together &quot;raising the heel&quot;, since the Greeks consider the heel to be the main part of the foot which the dancer uses.

==Versions==
John Blacking describes Kochari as follows:
=== Armenian ===

Armenians have been dancing Kochari for over a thousand years. The dance is danced by both men and women and is intended to be intimidating. More modern forms of Kochari have added a &quot;tremolo step&quot;, which involves shaking the whole body. It spread to the eastern part of Armenia after the Armenian genocide. The Armenian Kochari has been included to the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding of UNESCO in 2017.

=== Azerbaijani ===
Today this dancing is played in the Nakhchivan land of which Sharur, Sadarak, Kangarli, Julfa and Shahbuz regions&#x27; folklore collectives and it is performed at weddings. Kochari along with tenzere has been included to the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding of UNESCO in November 2018 as versions of Yalli dance.

=== Pontic Greek Kόtsari ===
The Pontic Greeks and Armenians have many vigorous warlike dances such as the Kochari.

Unlike most Pontic dances, the Kotsari is in an even rhythm (), originally danced in a closed circle.

<text>The Research and Analysis Wing (R&amp;AW) is the foreign intelligence agency of India. The agency&#x27;s primary function is gathering foreign intelligence, counter-terrorism, counter-proliferation, advising Indian policymakers, and advancing India&#x27;s foreign strategic interests. It is also involved in the security of India&#x27;s nuclear programme.

During the nine-year tenure of its first Secretary, Rameshwar Nath Kao, R&amp;AW quickly came to prominence in the global intelligence community, playing a role in major events such as accession of the state of Sikkim to India in 1975. Headquartered in New Delhi, R&amp;AW&#x27;s current chief is Ravi Sinha. The head of R&amp;AW is designated as the Secretary (Research) in the Cabinet Secretariat, and is under the authority of the Prime Minister of India without parliamentary oversight. Secretary reports to the National Security Advisor on a daily basis. In 1968, upon its formation, the union government led by the Indian National Congress (INC) adopted the motto &quot;Dharmo Rakshati Rakshitah&quot;.

==History==
===Background (1923–69)===
Prior to the inception of the Research and Analysis Wing, overseas intelligence collection was primarily the responsibility of the Intelligence Bureau (IB), which was created by the Government of India during British Raj. In 1933, sensing the political turmoil in the world which eventually led to the Second World War, the Intelligence Bureau&#x27;s responsibilities were increased to include the collection of intelligence along India&#x27;s borders.

In 1947, after independence, Sanjeevi Pillai took over as the first Indian Director of the IB. Having been depleted of trained manpower by the exit of the British after Indian independence, Pillai tried to run the bureau on MI5 lines. In 1949, Pillai organised a small foreign intelligence operation, but the Indian debacle in the Sino-Indian War of 1962 showed it to be ineffective. Foreign intelligence failure during the 1962 Sino-Indian War led then-Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to order a dedicated foreign intelligence agency to be established. After the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965, the Chief of Army Staff, General Joyanto Nath Chaudhuri, also called for more intelligence-gathering. Around the end of 1966 the concept of a separate foreign intelligence agency began to take concrete shape.

===Formation of R&amp;AW in 1968 to present===
The Indira Gandhi administration decided that a full-fledged second security service was needed. R. N. Kao, then a deputy director of the Intelligence Bureau, submitted a blueprint for the new agency. Kao was appointed as the chief of India&#x27;s first foreign intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing. The R&amp;AW was given the responsibility for strategic external intelligence, human as well as technical, plus concurrent responsibility with the Directorate-General of Military Intelligence for tactical trans-border military intelligence up to a certain depth across the Line of control (LOC) and the international border.

From its inception R&amp;AW has been criticised for being an agency not answerable to the people of India (R&amp;AW reports to Prime Minister only). Fears arose that it could turn into the KGB of India. Such fears were kept at bay by the R&amp;AW&#x27;s able leadership (although detractors of R&amp;AW and especially the Janata Party have accused the agency of letting itself be used for terrorising and intimidating opposition during the 1975–1977 Emergency). The main controversy which has plagued R&amp;AW in recent years is over bureaucratisation of the system with allegations about favouritism in promotions, corruption, ego clashes, no financial accountability, inter-departmental rivalry, etc. Noted security analyst and former Additional Secretary B. Raman has criticised the agency for its asymmetric growth; &quot;while being strong in its capability for covert action it is weak in its capability for intelligence collection, analysis and assessment. Strong in low and medium-grade intelligence, weak in high-grade intelligence. Strong in technical intelligence, weak in human intelligence. Strong in collation, weak in analysis. Strong in investigation, weak in prevention. Strong in crisis management, weak in crisis prevention.&quot;

R&amp;AW started as a wing of the main Intelligence Bureau with 250 employees and an annual budget of 2 crore. In the early seventies, its annual budget had risen to 30 crore while its personnel numbered several thousand. In 2007, the budget of R&amp;AW is speculated to be as high as 150 million to as low as 100 million.

===Additional child agencies===
Slowly other child agencies such as the Radio Research Center and the Electronics and Technical Services (ETS) were added to R&amp;AW in the 1970s and 1990s. In 1971, Kao had persuaded the Government to set up the Aviation Research Centre (ARC). The ARC&#x27;s main purpose was aerial reconnaissance. It replaced the Indian Air Force&#x27;s old reconnaissance aircraft, and by the mid-1970s, R&amp;AW, through the ARC, had high quality aerial pictures of the installations along the Chinese and Pakistani borders.

In the 1970s, the Special Frontier Force (SFF) moved under R&amp;AW from Intelligence Bureau (IB) and was tasked to train Bengali rebels. In 1977, R&amp;AW&#x27;s operations and staff were dramatically cut under the premiership of Morarji Desai, which hurt the organisation&#x27;s capabilities with the shutting of entire sections of R&amp;AW, like its Information Division. These cuts were reduced following Gandhi&#x27;s return. In 2004, National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) was setup by Government of India as a super-feeder agency for technical intelligence.

While the exact nature of the operations conducted by NTRO is classified, it is believed that it deals with research on imagery and communications using various platforms.
==Objectives==
The present R&amp;AW objectives include:

* Monitoring the political, military, economic and scientific developments in countries which have a direct bearing on India&#x27;s national security and the formulation of its foreign policy.
* Moulding international public opinion and influence foreign governments.
* Covert Operations to safeguard India&#x27;s national interests.
* Anti-terror operations and neutralising elements posing a threat to India.

In the past, following the Sino-Indian war of 1962 and due to India&#x27;s volatile relations with Pakistan, R&amp;AW&#x27;s objectives had also consisted of the following:
* To watch the development of international communism and the schism between the two big communist nations, the Soviet Union and China. As with other countries, both these powers had direct access to the communist parties in India.
* To control and limit the supply of military hardware to Pakistan, from mostly European countries, America and more importantly from China.

==Structure and organisation==

The head of R&amp;AW is designated Secretary (R) in the Cabinet Secretariat. Most of the previous chiefs have been experts on either Pakistan or China. They also have the benefit of training in either the USA or the UK, and more recently in Israel. R&amp;AW works directly under the command of the Prime Minister. Its structure and operations are classified. On a daily basis, the Secretary (R) reports to the National Security Adviser. The purview of the Cabinet Secretary over the R&amp;AW is limited to administrative and financial matters. The Secretary (R) reports on an administrative basis to the Cabinet Secretary, who reports to the Prime Minister. Reporting to the Secretary (R) are:
* An Additional Secretary responsible for the Office of Special Operations and intelligence collected from different countries processed by large number of Joint Secretaries, who are the functional heads of various specified desks with different regional divisions/areas/countries: Area one – Pakistan; Area two – China and Southeast Asia; Area three – the Middle East and Africa; and Area four – other countries. Two Special Joint Secretaries, reporting to the Additional Secretary, head the Electronics and Technical Department which is the nodal agency for ETS and the Radio Research Center.
* The Directorate General of Security has important sections – the Aviation Research Centre is headed by one Special Secretary.
The internal structure of the R&amp;AW is a matter of speculation, but brief overviews of the same are present in the public domain. Attached to the Headquarters of R&amp;AW at Lodi Road, New Delhi are different regional headquarters, which have direct links to overseas stations and are headed by a controlling officer who keeps records of different projects assigned to field officers who are posted abroad. Intelligence is usually collected from a variety of sources by field officers and deputy field officers; it is either preprocessed by a senior field officer or by a desk officer. The desk officer then passes the information to the Joint Secretary and then on to the Additional Secretary and from there it is disseminated to the concerned end user. R&amp;AW personnel are called &quot;Research Officers&quot; instead of the traditional &quot;agents&quot;. There is a sizeable number of female officers in R&amp;AW even at the operational level. In recent years, R&amp;AW has shifted its primary focus from Pakistan to China and have started operating a separate desk for this purpose.

The Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), under the Cabinet Secretariat, is responsible for coordinating and analysing intelligence activities between R&amp;AW, the Intelligence Bureau and the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA). In practice, however, the effectiveness of the JIC has been varied. Director of R&amp;AW is a member of the JIC Steering Committee and is authorized to brief the Prime Minister. With the establishment of the National Security Council in 1999, the role of the JIC has been merged with the NSC. R&amp;AW&#x27;s legal status is unusual, in that it is not an &quot;Agency&quot;, but a &quot;Wing&quot; of the Cabinet Secretariat. Hence, R&amp;AW is not answerable to the Parliament of India on any issue, which keeps it out of reach of the Right to Information Act. This exemption was granted through Section 24 read with Schedule II of the act. However, information regarding the allegations of corruption and human rights violations has to be disclosed.

===Field formations===

R&amp;AW has 10 field formations all over India, known as Special Bureaus. These Bureaus have an area of responsibility targeted towards the countries that share land border with India. They are largely located in major cities near or along the borders:

== Recruitment ==

Initially, R&amp;AW relied primarily on trained intelligence officers who were recruited directly. These belonged to the external wing of the Intelligence Bureau. Candidates are mostly recruited from the IPS and few other civil services along with candidates from armed forces of India, the latter being in lesser number though. Later, it began directly recruiting graduates from universities. However owing to allegations of nepotism in appointments, in 1983 R&amp;AW created its own service cadre, the Research and Analysis Service (RAS) to absorb talent from other Group A Civil Services, under the Central Staffing Scheme.

Direct recruitment at Class I executive level is from Civil services officers undergoing Foundation course at Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration. At the end of the course, it conducts a campus interview. Based on a selection of psychological tests and the interview, candidates are inducted for a lien period of one year. During this period, they have an option of rejoining their parent service (if they wish to) after which they can be permanently absorbed into the Research and Analysis Service. Delhi-based security think tank Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses noted in one of its reports that R&amp;AW suffered from the &#x27;tail-end syndrome&#x27; where the &#x27;bottom of the entrance lists&#x27; of those qualifying the UPSC examinations were offered jobs. Additionally, recruitment is also by lateral deputation from the Officer corps of Armed Forces or Group A Civil Service Officers. The Civil and Defence Service Officers permanently resign their cadre and join the RAS. However, according to recent reports, officers can return to their parent cadre after serving a specific period in the agency if they wish to.

Most of the secretaries have been officers from the IPS and other posts are held by IRS and IFS officers. R&amp;AW also employs a number of linguists and other experts in various fields. The service conditions of R&amp;AW officers are governed by the Research and Analysis Wing (Recruitment, Cadre and Service) Rules, 1975.

===Training===
;Basic training
Basic training commences with &#x27;pep talks&#x27; to boost the morale of the new recruit. This is a ten-day phase in which the inductee is familiarised with the real world of intelligence and espionage, as opposed to the spies of fiction. Common usages, tradecraft techniques and classification of information are taught. Financial and economic analysis, space technology, information security, energy security and scientific knowledge is imbibed to the trainees. The recruit is made to specialise in a foreign language and introduced to Geostrategic analysis. Case studies of other agencies like CIA, KGB, ISI, Mossad and MI6 are presented for study. The inductee is also taught that intelligence organisations do not identify who is friend and who is foe, the country&#x27;s foreign policy does. Basic classroom training in tactics and language are imparted to R&amp;AW officers at the residential Training and Language Institute in Gurgaon. A multi-disciplinary school of economic intelligence is also being set up in Mumbai to train intelligence officers in investigating economic crimes like money laundering for terror purposes etc.

;Advanced training
After completing &#x27;Basic Training&#x27; the recruit is now attached to a Field Intelligence Bureau (FIB). Their training here lasts for 1–2 years. They are given firsthand experience of what it was to be out in the figurative cold, conducting clandestine operations. During night exercises under realistic conditions, they are taught infiltration and exfiltration. They are also instructed to avoid capture and if caught, how to face interrogation. They will learn the art of reconnoitre, making contacts, and, the numerous skills of operating an intelligence mission. At the end of the field training, the new recruit is brought back to the school for final polishing. Before their deployment in the field, they will be given exhaustive training in the art of self-defence mainly Krav Maga, and the use of technical espionage devices. They are also drilled in various administrative disciplines so that they could take their place in the foreign missions without arousing suspicion. They are now ready to operate under the cover of an Embassy to gather information, set up their own network of informers, moles or operatives as the task may require. Field and arms training is provided in the Indian Military Academy Headquarters at Dehradun. The training model has been criticised as being &#x27;archaic and too police-centric&#x27; and not incorporating &#x27;modern technological advances in methods of communication&#x27; etc.

===Shortage of staff===
R&amp;AW has a severe shortage of employees. The number of personnel in 2013 was estimated to be 5,000 personnel. This represents a staff deficit of 40% below sanctioned strength. In 2013, The Hindu reported the organisation was short on management level staff by 130 and in specialized areas like technology there was also a huge shortage. In number of cryptanalysts, it was short by approximately 33%.

==Functions and methods==
The primary mission of R&amp;AW includes intelligence collection via HUMINT, psychological warfare, subversion, sabotage. R&amp;AW maintains active liaison with other agencies and services in various countries. Those agencies include SVR of Russia, Afghanistan&#x27;s NDS, Israel&#x27;s Mossad, Germany&#x27;s BND, the CIA and MI6 have been well-known, a common interest being Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear programme.

===Stations abroad===
R&amp;AW has been active in obtaining information and operating through third countries. R&amp;AW offices abroad have limited strength and are largely geared to the collection of military, economic, scientific, and political intelligence. R&amp;AW monitors the activities of certain organisations abroad only insofar as they relate to their involvement with narco terrorist elements and smuggling arms, ammunition, explosives, etc. into India. It does not monitor the activities of criminal elements abroad, which are mainly confined to normal smuggling without any links to terrorist elements.

R&amp;AW officers are posted to Indian diplomatic missions under official cover as diplomats, frequently in the consular wing. The relationship between R&amp;AW and the Ministry of External Affairs has been unstable because they &quot;inhabit different worlds&quot; according to the Times of India.

A task force report prepared by a New Delhi-based security think tank highlighted that R&amp;AW operatives have inadequate non-official cover for overseas operations which &#x27;limits access to spot real targets&#x27; and causes issues on handling &#x27;high-value assets&#x27;.

==Operations and activities==
The known activities and operations of R&amp;AW, by country:

===Africa===
====South Africa and Namibia====
R&amp;AW trained the intelligence officers of many independent African countries and assisted the anti-apartheid struggles in South Africa and Namibia. Retired R&amp;AW officers were deputed to work in training institutes of intelligence agencies of some African states.

====Senegal====
R&amp;AW was one of the primary agencies that provided the information about Ravi Pujari, being located in Senegal. This information was then provided to Senegalese authorities, who arrested Pujari and deported him to India. He was formally arrested at Kempegowda International Airport by Karnataka Police.

===Asia===
====Afghanistan====
During the Soviet War in Afghanistan, R&amp;AW had recruited three powerful warlords, including Ahmad Shah Massoud.

In 1996, R&amp;AW had built a 25-bed military hospital at the Farkhor Air Base. This airbase was used by the Aviation Research Centre, the reconnaissance arm of R&amp;AW, to repair and operate the Northern Alliance&#x27;s aerial support. This relationship was further cemented in the 2001 Afghan war.

After the September 11, 2001 attacks, R&amp;AW provided the intelligence to western countries that there were over 120 training camps operating in Afghanistan and Pakistan, run by a variety of militant groups.

After the Overthrow of Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001, R&amp;AW was the first intelligence agency to determine the extent of the Kunduz airlift.

In 2017, R&amp;AW undertook counter-terrorism operation, described as “unprecedented in its scale and scope”, foiled a major terrorist attack by an Islamic State - Khorasan suicide bomber in New Delhi. The CIA was also involved in this Operation. The militant was later transferred to a US base in Afghanistan for further questioning. The operation spanned 3 countries and involved 80 Research officers.

In November–December 2019, a special exfiltration operation was undertaken by R&amp;AW. At least four Indian nationals working in various parts of Afghanistan, that had been abducted by the Haqqani network, were successfully rescued.

In 2020, 10 MSS Operatives from Xinjiang State Security Department (XSSD) were arrested in Kabul by the Afghan NDS. During Questioning, one of operative told the interrogators that they were gathering information about al-Qaeda, Taliban and Turkistan Islamic Party in Kunar and Badakhshan provinces, and wanted to assassinate high-level members of TIP. This counter-intelligence operation was undertaken based on a tip from R&amp;AW.

====Bangladesh====

In the early 1970s, the army of Pakistan launched military crackdown in response to the Bangladesh independence movement. Nearly 1 crore (10 million) refugees fled to India. R&amp;AW was instrumental in the formation of the Bangladeshi guerrilla organisation Mukti Bahini and responsible for supplying information, providing training and heavy ammunition to this organisation. It is also alleged that R&amp;AW planned and executed the 1971 Indian Airlines hijacking as a false flag operation to ban overflight by Pakistani aircraft and disrupt Pakistani troop movement in East Pakistan. Special Frontier Force, then under R&amp;AW actively participated in military operations especially in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. After the war ended in the successful creation of Bangladesh. However, four years later Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was assassinated on 15 August 1975 at his residence. R&amp;AW operatives claimed that they had advance information about Mujibur Rahman&#x27;s assassination but Sheikh Mujib tragically ignored inputs. He was killed along with much of his family. Later, R&amp;AW successfully thwarted plans of assassinating Sheikh Hasina Wazed, daughter of Mujibur Rahman, by Islamist extremists.

In 1990, R&amp;AW had helped engineer and support a democratic uprising against Mohammed Ershad, thus leading to his resignation. His Pro-Pakistan and Anti-Hindu policy decisions had been considered a threat by Indian government.

In 1991, after Khaleda Zia had won election, India was alarmed over increased harassment of pro-India politicians, large-scale radicalisation and meticulously planned infiltration of trained extremists into Indian territory by Jamaat-e-Islami. JeI had set-up several terror training camps located along the border. So in order to stop all this activity, R&amp;AW spontaneously bombed several of its camps and a major ISI safe house, thus dismantling JeI&#x27;s terror network.

In 1977–97, India took active part in Chittagong Hill Tracts conflict. R&amp;AW trained and financed the rebels of Shanti Bahini.

====China====

After China tested its first nuclear weapons on 16 October 1964, at Lop Nur, Xinjiang, India and the USA shared a common fear about the nuclear capabilities of China. Owing to the extreme remoteness of Chinese testing grounds, strict secrecy surrounding the Chinese nuclear programme, and the extreme difficulty that an Indian or American would have passing themselves off as Chinese, it was almost impossible to carry out any HUMINT operation. So, the CIA in the late 1960s decided to launch an ELINT operation along with R&amp;AW and ARC to track China&#x27;s nuclear tests and monitor its missile launches. The operation, in the garb of a mountaineering expedition to Nanda Devi involved Indian climber M S Kohli who along with operatives of Special Frontier Force and the CIA – most notably Jim Rhyne, a veteran STOL pilot – was to place a permanent ELINT device, a transceiver powered by a plutonium battery, that could detect and report data on future nuclear tests carried out by China. The monitoring device was near successfully implanted on Nanda Devi, when an avalanche forced a hasty withdrawal. Later, a subsequent mountain operation to retrieve or replant the device was aborted when it was found that the device was lost. Recent reports indicate that radiation traces from this device have been discovered in sediment below the mountains.

In February 2020, Indian Customs officials detained a Chinese ship from Shanghai Port, at Kandla Port. The ship was bound for Port Qasim in Karachi. It was seized for wrongly declaring an autoclave, which can be used in the launch process of ballistic missiles, as an industrial dryer. This seizure was done on an intelligence tip-off by R&amp;AW.

In late 2020, during India-China Standoff, R&amp;AW was able obtain the decoded PLA WTC cryptography. A Chinese Technician recruited by R&amp;AW had passed the decryption data.

==== Fiji ====

In Fiji, where Fijians with Indian ancestry were being persecuted by Sitiveni Rabuka, R&amp;AW launched 
an operation involving informants in Australia, New Zealand and UK to successfully oust him from power.

====Iran====
In August 1991, R&amp;AW undertook a physical surveillance and tracking operation of Indian nationals from Jammu and Kashmir that were taking weapons training in Qom.

====Malaysia====
Since 2014, R&amp;AW has undertaken numerous identification, physical surveillance and tracking operations, in Malaysia, targeted towards Khalistani organisations. 
It is only of because such operations that many high-ranking Khalistani militants like Harminder Singh Mintoo, Tara Singh, Kulbir Kaur, Ramandeep Singh etc. have been arrested and deported to India.

====Maldives====

In November 1988, the People&#x27;s Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE), composed of about 200 Tamil secessionist rebels under Abdullah Luthufi, invaded Maldives. At the request of the president of Maldives, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, the Indian Armed Forces, with assistance from R&amp;AW, launched a military campaign to throw the mercenaries out of Maldives. On the night of 3 November 1988, the Indian Air Force airlifted the 6th parachute battalion of the Parachute Regiment from Agra and flew them over 2,000 km to Maldives. The Indian paratroopers landed at the airstrip of Hulhule island and restored the Government rule at Malé within a day. The operation, labelled Operation Cactus, also involved the Indian Navy. Swift operation by the military and precise intelligence by R&amp;AW quelled the insurgency.

In 2018–19, R&amp;AW undertook many operations that crippled ISI and MSS intelligence network in Maldives. 

In December 2024 &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that R&amp;AW tried (but later dropped the plan altogether as relations started to improve between India and Maldives) to oust Maldivian government because Government of India perceived Maldivian government to be Pro-China. After the publication of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; report the Maldivian Foreign Minister in an interview to WION said (regarding &quot;The Washington Post&quot; story) &quot;very short answer for that. It is totally, something that is untrue, unfounded. There is no truth in that. So it is as simple as that.&quot; 

====Mauritius====

In February 1983, Mauritian Prime Minister Anerood Jugnauth requested assistance from Mrs Indira Gandhi in the event of a coup by rival politician Paul Bérenger. In March 1983, Gandhi ordered the Indian Army and Navy to prepare for a military intervention against a possible coup against the Jugnauth government. But the military intervention was put off by Mrs. Gandhi, after a squabble between the Indian Navy and Army, on who would lead the operation. Instead, she chose to task the Research and Analysis Wing&#x27;s then chief, Nowsher F. Suntook, with supervising a largely intelligence-led operation to reunite the Indian community of Mauritius whose fracturing along ideological and communal lines had allowed Mr. Berenger to mount a political challenge.

====Myanmar====
During the 1990s, R&amp;AW cultivated Burmese rebel groups and pro-democracy coalitions, especially the Kachin Independence Army (KIA). India allowed the KIA to carry a limited trade in jade and precious stones using Indian territory and even supplied them weapons. It is further alleged that KIA chief Maran Brang Seng met the Secretary(R) in Delhi twice. However, when the KIA became the main source of training and weapons for militant groups in Northeast India, R&amp;AW initiated an operation, code named &quot;Operation Leech&quot;, to assassinate the leaders of the Burmese rebels as an example to other groups. in 1998, six top rebel leaders, including military wing chief of National Unity Party of Arakans (NUPA), Khaing Raza, were shot dead and 34 Arakanese guerrillas were arrested and charged with gunrunning.

In 1995, in Mizoram along the India–Myanmar border, the 57th Mountain Division of the Indian Army carried out the Operation Golden Bird. The operation was launched because R&amp;AW had provided information that a huge consignment of arms for northern eastern had reached to Cox&#x27;s Bazar (Bangladesh) and was to be sent to insurgents in Manipur. The arms, as per intelligence were meant for groups in Nagaland and Isak-Muivah group in Manipur. Forces were deployed for counterinsurgency in the states of Manipur and Nagaland. Radio sets and other technological instruments were used to intercepts insurgents messages. On 5 April 1995, the Indian troops captured an insurgent named Hathi Bsrvah, trained by Pakistani ISI near Karachi. By 21 May 1995, the operation was finally called off.

In 2015, R&amp;AW and Military Intelligence of Indian Army provided the intelligence support to 21 Para (SF), for their counter-insurgency operation in Myanmar.

==== Nepal ====
In 1998, Mirza Dilshad Beg, a Nepalese parliamentarian and an ISI informant was assassinated by R&amp;AW.

Raju Pargai &amp; Amit Arya was shot dead in 2011, who was running Mirza Dilshad Beg entire network in Uttarakhand.
Despite the accusation and arrest of Lucky Bisht, there was not enough evidence to convict him in the murder case, leading to his eventual acquittal.

During 1997–2013, R&amp;AW along with IB carried out multiple operations, in which many militant leaders like Yasin Bhatkal of Indian Mujahideen; Bhupinder Singh Bhuda of Khalistan Commando Force; Tariq Mehmood, Asif Ali, Syed Abdul Karim Tunda, Abu Qasim  of Lashkar-e-Taiba; Fayaz Ahmed Mir of Jaish-e-Mohammed were secretly brought to India.

In 2014, R&amp;AW along with DGFI tracked down Indian Mujahideen&#x27;s top commander, Zia Ur Rehman in Nepal. The operation was executed by DGFI after formal request from India&#x27;s R&amp;AW and Nepal&#x27;s law enforcement agencies.

In 2017, it was reported that R&amp;AW had kidnapped a mid-level ISI officer Lt. Col. Mohammed H Zahir from Lumbini. There were reports that Zahir was among the ISI team that had taken part in kidnapping and smuggling of former Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav from Chabahar, Iran to Meshkal Pakistan.

In September 2022, Mohammad Lal, who was a huge supplier of counterfeit Indian currency was shot dead by two unidentified armed men in Kathmandu. The assailants immediately fled the scene after shooting Lal. R&amp;AW had been looking for Lal for a long time for his alleged connections with ISI and D-Company.

====Pakistan====
During the late 1960s, R&amp;AW had infiltrated the highest levels of Pakistani military and political leadership. It even had a Mole inside General Yahya Khan&#x27;s Office. This mole had also alerted the Indian armed forces, a week before about impending Pakistani Air attack. This alert was correct as Pakistan attacked India on December 3, thus starting the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.

R&amp;AW&#x27;s most successful spy Ravindra Kaushik spied in Pakistan in the 1970s. He was from Rajasthan&#x27;s Sri Ganganagar, Kaushik was a student and an aspiring actor, he used to do acting on stage. He was acting in a patriotic play in a theatre in Lucknow when R&amp;AW recruiter spotted this young boy. He joined R&amp;AW in 1975 at the age of 23. They trained him, made a disguise identity and sent to Pakistan. He did an LLB in Karachi university and joined the Pakistani army, eventually he was promoted to the rank of major. Amid 1979-83 he passed valuable information to R&amp;AW. Due to his feats the then Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi gave him title of &quot;The Black Tiger&quot;.

Kahuta is the site of the Khan Research Laboratories (KRL), Pakistan&#x27;s main nuclear weapons laboratory as well as an emerging centre for long-range missile development. The primary Pakistani missile-material production facility is located at Kahuta, employing gas centrifuge enrichment technology to produce Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU). R&amp;AW first confirmed Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear programs by analysing the hair samples snatched from the floor of barber shops near KRL; which showed that Pakistan had developed the ability to enrich uranium to weapons-grade quality. R&amp;AW operatives knew about Kahuta Research Laboratories from at least early 1978, when the then Indian Prime Minister, Morarji Desai, accidentally exposed R&amp;AW&#x27;s operations on Pakistan&#x27;s covert nuclear weapons program. In an indiscreet moment in a telephone conversation one day, Morarji Desai informed the then Pakistan President, Zia-ul-Haq, that India was aware of Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear weapons program. According to later reports, acting on this &quot;tip-off&quot;, Pakistan&#x27;s ISI and army eliminated most of R&amp;AW&#x27;s assets in and around Kahuta.

R&amp;AW received information from one of its informants in a London-based company, which had supplied Arctic-weather gear to Indian troops in Ladakh that some Pakistan paramilitary forces had bought similar Arctic-weather gear. This information was shared with Indian Army which soon launched Operation Meghdoot to take control of Siachen Glacier with around 300 acclimatised troops were airlifted to Siachen before Pakistan could launch any operation resulting in Indian head start and eventual Indian domination of all major peaks in Siachen.

In the mid-1980s, R&amp;AW set up two special units, &quot;Counterintelligence Team-X(CIT-X)&quot; and &quot;Counterintelligence Team-J(CIT-J)&quot;, the first directed at Pakistan and the second at Khalistani groups. Rabinder Singh, the R&amp;AW officer who later defected to the United States in 2004, helped run CIT-J in its early years. Both these covert units used the services of cross-border traffickers to ferry weapons and funds across the border, much as their ISI counterparts were doing. According to former R&amp;AW official and noted security analyst B. Raman, the Indian counter-campaign yielded results. &quot;The role of our cover action capability in putting an end to the ISI&#x27;s interference and support of khalistani militants in Punjab, thus completely stopping years of violence and insurgency&quot;, he wrote in 2002, &quot;by making such interference prohibitively costly is little known and understood.&quot; These covert groups were disbanded during the tenure of IK Gujral and were never restarted. As per B Raman a former R&amp;AW Additional Secretary, these covert groups were successful in keeping a check on ISI and were &quot;responsible for ending the Khalistani insurgency&quot;.

During the mid-1990s, R&amp;AW undertook an operation to infiltrate various ISI-backed militant groups in Jammu and Kashmir. R&amp;AW operatives infiltrated the area, collected military intelligence, and provided evidence about ISI&#x27;s involvement in training and funding separatist groups. R&amp;AW was successful not only in unearthing the links, but also in infiltrating and neutralising the terrorism in the Kashmir valley. It is also credited for creating a split in the Hizb-ul-Mujahideen. Operation Chanakya also marked the creation of pro-Indian groups in Kashmir like the Ikhwan-ul-Muslimeen, Muslim Mujahideen etc. These counter-insurgencies consist of ex-militants and relatives of those slain in the conflict. Ikhwan-ul-Muslimeen leader Kokka Parrey was himself assassinated by separatists.

During the Kargil War, R&amp;AW was also successful in intercepting a telephonic conversation between Pervez Musharraf, the then Pakistan Army Chief who was in Beijing and his chief of staff Lt. Gen. Mohammed Aziz in Islamabad. This tape was later published by India to prove Pakistani involvement in the Kargil incursion.

In 2004, it had come to light that a timely tip-off by R&amp;AW helped foil a third assassination plot against Pakistan&#x27;s former president, General Pervez Musharraf.

About 2–6 months before 26/11 Mumbai attacks, R&amp;AW had intercepted several telephone calls through SIGINT which pointed at impending attacks on Mumbai Hotels by Pakistan-based terrorists, however there was a coordination failure and no follow up action was taken. Few hours before the attacks, a R&amp;AW technician monitoring satellite transmissions picked up conversations between attackers and handlers, as the attackers were sailing toward Mumbai. The technician flagged the conversations as being suspicious and passed them on to his superiors. R&amp;AW believed that they were worrying and immediately alerted the office of the National Security Advisor. However the intelligence was ignored. Later, just after the terrorists had attacked Mumbai, the technicians started monitoring the six phones used by the terrorists and recorded conversations between the terrorists and their handlers.

In March 2016, Kulbhushan Jadhav, an Indian naval officer who working as a R&amp;AW agent, was arrested in Balochistan and charged with espionage and sabotage. He was accused of operating a covert terror network within Balochistan. In 2017, he was sentenced to death by a Field General Court Martial in Pakistan. While held by Pakistani authorities, Jadhav had confessed in a video recording that he was tasked by R&amp;AW, “to plan and organise espionage and sabotage activities” in Balochistan and Karachi.

During the 2016 Line of Control strike, R&amp;AW played an important role by providing real time and accurate intelligence to operational advisors and planners. It had deployed its human assets closest to the 8 demarcated launch-pads in Pakistan administered Kashmir. It also started Physical Surveillance of Chief of Pakistan army, 10 Corps commander and force commander of Northern Areas.

During 2019 Balakot airstrike, R&amp;AW played an important role by identifying and providing intelligence on Markaz Syed Ahmad Shaheed training camp, to operational planners. It had HUMINT that a large number of terrorists had congregated in the camp.

On 1 March 2022, one of the hijackers of Flight IC 814 flight, Zahoor Mistry, was killed by two bike-borne assailants in Karachi. It was Mistry who had killed one of the passengers, 25-year-old Rupin Katyal, on the flight. It is widely believed he was assassinated by R&amp;AW.

On 20 February 2023, Hizbul Commander Bashir Ahmad Peer alias Imtiyaz Alam who was India&#x27;s most wanted designated terrorist under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act was shot dead outside a store by unknown assailants in Rawalpindi. It is widely believed that R&amp;AW was behind this.

On May 6, 2023, Paramjit Singh Panjwar, the Chief of Khalistan Commando Force was gunned down by two unidentified bike-borne gunmen in Johar Town of Lahore while he was out for a morning walk near his residence. Most likely it is believed he was assassinated by R&amp;AW operative.

On April 4, 2024, The Guardian reported that the Indian government had allegedly ordered the killings of individuals in Pakistan. Up to 20 assassinations had taken place since 2020, targeting individuals who were either linked to known terrorist organizations or were former members of these organizations.

==== Philippines ====

In March 2023, with the help of Indian intelligence inputs, officers from the Philippine Bureau of Immigration, the Cybercrime Investigation and Coordinating Center and the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency arrested three suspected members of the Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF) in the central Philippine city of Iloilo.

The suspects were deported back to India in May 2023.

====Saudi Arabia====
Since the 1990s, given its position as the largest source of funds and promoter of Salafist ideology and being considered major security challenge for India. R&amp;AW has greatly expanded its activities and operation in Saudi Arabia. Abdul Karim Tunda was captured in Saudi Arabia and was secretly brought to India.

Since 2012, R&amp;AW has carried out numerous operations in Saudi Arabia. It is only because of such operations that dozens of high-ranking terrorists like Zabiuddin Ansari, Habibur Rahman, Sabeel Ahmed, Muhammed Gulnawaz etc. have been deported and arrested in India.

In April 2023 the Saudi cabinet gave approval for joint cooperation with Indian intelligence agencies. It also approved Riyadh&#x27;s status as a dialogue partner for SCO as India prepares to host the SCO summit in July. India-Saudi defence and security partnership has been steadily growing. Last year, there were a number of high-level bilateral visits and meetings, beginning in February with the first-ever official visit to India by Lt Gen Fahd bin Abdullah Mohammed Al-Mutair, commander of Royal Saudi Land Forces.

====Sri Lanka====
In the late 1980s, R&amp;AW allegedly started funding and training LTTE to keep a check on Sri Lanka, which had helped Pakistan in the Indo-Pak War by allowing Pakistani ships to refuel at Sri Lankan ports. However, when LTTE created a lot of problems and complications for India, R&amp;AW switched sides and started providing intelligence support to Sri Lanka. When Prime Minister of India Rajiv Gandhi was forced to send the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) under Operation Pawan in 1987 to restore normalcy in the region. The disastrous mission of the IPKF was blamed by many on the lack of coordination between the IPKF and R&amp;AW. Its most disastrous manifestation was the Heliborne assault on LTTE HQ in the Jaffna University campus in the opening stages of Operation Pawan. The dropping paratroopers became easy targets for the LTTE. A number of soldiers were killed. The assassination of Rajiv Gandhi ended India&#x27;s involvement in Sri Lankan Civil war.

In 2010, R&amp;AW carried out a snatch operation in Sri Lanka, in which a top HuJI militant Sheikh Abdul Khawaja – handler of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attackers was captured and secretly taken away to India.

In 2015, it was allegedly reported by the Sri Lankan newspaper The Sunday Times, that R&amp;AW had played a role in uniting the opposition, to bring about the defeat of Mahinda Rajapaksa. There had been growing concern in the Indian government, on the increasing influence of economic and military rival China in Sri Lankan affairs. Rajapaksa further upped the ante by allowing 2 Chinese submarines to dock in 2014, without informing India, in spite of a stand still agreement to this effect between India and Sri Lanka. The growing Chinese tilt of Rajapaksa was viewed by India with unease. Further, it was alleged, that R&amp;AW&#x27;s Chief of Station in Colombo, helped coordination of talks within the opposition, and convincing former PM Ranil Wickremasinghe not to stand against Rajapaksa, but to choose a common opposition candidate, who had better chances of winning. The Station chief was also alleged to have been in touch with Chandrika Kumaratunga, who played a key role in convincing Maithripala Sirisena to be the common candidate. However these allegations were denied by the Indian Government and the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera.

Before the 2019 Easter bombings, R&amp;AW had issued precision intelligence warnings to its Sri Lankan counterpart about an impending terrorist attack. All of these warnings were based on HUMINT gathered by it.

In 2019, R&amp;AW was also able to infiltrate PLA communication through the Chinese military to Sri Lanka. It was because of this that the post was vacant for nearly 8–9 months; the attache was called back after Chinese had learned of this infiltration.

====Tajikistan====
In the mid-1990s, after the rise of Pakistan backed Taliban in Afghanistan, India started supporting the Northern Alliance. In order to provide support, India had acquired Farkhor Air Base. This airbase was used by R&amp;AW, along with M.I., as a base of operations for all their activities directed to Afghanistan like covert paramilitary operations and HUMINT gathering. The airbase was also used by ARC and Directorate of Air Intelligence (DAI), to provide aerial reconnaissance to Northern Alliance.

====Turkey====
During the 2015 G20 Antalya summit, the R&amp;AW station in Ankara increased its strength in order to provide additional security cover for visiting PM Modi, along with SPG. Officers from MI5 and Mossad were also deployed to provide Security as part of liaison agreement.

=== Australia ===
A detailed report from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; revealed R&amp;AW&#x27;s deep operations in the country. Australian authorities expelled two Indian intelligence operatives in 2020 for being members of an elaborate “nest of spies” that attempted to steal sensitive information about defence technology, major airport security and trade relationships.

ASIO Director-General Mike Burgess revealed in 2021 that ASIO had uncovered a “nest of spies” from R&amp;AW, whose operations included grooming politicians and a foreign embassy as informants and R&amp;AW had also recruited an Australia government official with security clearance.

===Europe===
====Belgium====
In 2021, R&amp;AW is reported to have foiled an assassination plot hatched by Khalistan Commando Force militants from Belgium and United Kingdom, to target farmers&#x27; leader protesting at Delhi.

====Germany====
Since 2014, R&amp;AW has undertaken numerous physical surveillance, identification and tracking operations in Germany, targeted towards Khalistani militants and Islamic fundamentalists. It has aggressively recruited agents inside pro-Khalistan circles all across Germany, in cities like Frankfurt and Berlin.

The latest surveillance operation was undertaken in 2019, with target being Gurmeet Singh Bagga, co-leader of the Khalistan Zindabad Force and a fugitive wanted for the Punjab drone Arms drop Case.

====Italy====
After 26/11, it was uncovered that Pakistan&#x27;s ISI had not only laundered large amount of money for the attack but also arranged VOIP calls that allowed the handlers to talk to the militants through the Italian city of Brescia.

So in order to counter these activities, R&amp;AW established a new station in Rome.
Since then, it has undertaken hundreds of operations, directed towards Sleeper cells/operatives of Pakistan-based Islamic and Khalistani militant organisations. It has also aggressively recruited agents inside Pro-Khalistan circles all across Italy

====United Kingdom====

During the 1980s, R&amp;AW launched an extensive operation in London to neutralise UK-based Pakistani national Abdul Khan, who had played an instrumental role in sheltering extremists and planning attacks in India.

Since the suppression and defeat of Khalistani insurgency in the late 1990s, R&amp;AW has greatly expanded its informant network inside Khalistani circles and associations in the UK. Wanted Khalistanis like Paramjeet Singh Pamma and Kuldeep Singh Chaheru have been living in UK since they fled in 1992, thus necessitating increased R&amp;AW presence.

On 15 June 2023, Avtar Singh Khanda, the UK-based chief of the Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF) was suddenly admitted to the hospital with a case of blood cancer, and later died. His followers in the UK believe that Indian intelligence had him poisoned and are demanding the full medical report.

===North America===

====Canada====
Kanishka Bombing case: On 23 June 1985 Air India&#x27;s Flight 182 was blown up near Ireland and 329 people died. On the same day, another explosion took place at Tokyo&#x27;s Narita airport&#x27;s transit baggage building where baggage was being transferred from Cathay Pacific Flight No CP 003 to Air India Flight 301 which was scheduled for Bangkok. Both aircraft were loaded with explosives from Canadian airports. Flight 301 got saved because of a delay in its departure. This was considered as a major setback to R&amp;AW for failing to gather enough intelligence about the Khalistani militants.

In April 2020, it was reported that R&amp;AW and IB had launched an extensive operation in 2009–2015, to influence the Canadian government and politicians into supporting India&#x27;s interests.
Canada has long being accused by India for being a safe haven for Khalistani separatists.

In July 2020, Canada put two Sikh men on Passenger Protect, the Canadian no-fly list, after Canadian Security Intelligence Service had received information from R&amp;AW that both intended to travel to Pakistan and carry out an ISI-backed terrorist attack inside India. One of the men was identified as the son of Lakhbir Singh Rode, a well-known Khalistani separatist.

On 19 June 2023, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a prominent Khalistani leader and alleged chief of the Khalistan Tiger Force was shot to death outside the parking lot of Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia. Nijjar was accused of training and funding members of the separatist group and had been declared a terrorist by India, who put a bounty of for information leading to his arrest. This was heavily seen as an R&amp;AW assassination operation by not only followers of Nijjar, but also from Canadian officials. On 18 September 2023, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau formally accused the Indian government of the killing and acknowledged the expulsion of a prominent Indian diplomat responsible for R&amp;AW activities in the country. India rejected Canada&#x27;s allegations of involvement in Nijjar&#x27;s murder, calling the Canadian government&#x27;s allegations &quot;absurd and motivated&quot;, and expelled numerous Canadian diplomats.

==== United States ====
On 23 November 2023, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported that the United States had foiled a plan to assassinate Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Sikh separatist, on American soil. Following this, the US requested India to hold accountable those responsible for the plot. The plot in the United States coincided with the June 18 shooting death of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey, B.C., near Vancouver — an operation also linked to R&amp;AW. Experts and officials say that the foiled assassination is part of an escalating campaign of aggression by R&amp;AW against alleged Sikh Separatists in Asia, Europe, USA and Canada. 

On 10 December 2023, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that an R&amp;AW officer established a fake news site to spread disinformation against critics of the Modi government. 

On 20 March 2024, &quot;Bloomberg&quot; reported that an Indian investigation had found &quot;rogue operative&quot; who were not authorized by the government to be involved in the plot. Additionally, at least one person who was directly involved in the alleged assassination attempt is no longer employed by R&amp;AW. However, India has not initiated any criminal action against them. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, it is the U.S. intelligence agencies assessment that the operation targeting Pannun was approved by Samant Goel, the R&amp;AW chief at the time.

On 15 October 2024 &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; reported that India has conveyed to the United States that it (India) has arrested the &quot;rogue operative&quot;. The &quot;rogue operative&quot; had made bail in April 2024 according to &quot;The&quot; &quot;Indian Express&quot;&quot;.&quot; The &quot;rogue operative&quot; was arrested in an extortion case. 

On 18 November 2024 &quot;The New Indian Express&quot; reported that the &quot;rogue operative&quot; had sought exemption &lt;bdi&gt;from physical appearance in the court citing threat to his life.&lt;/bdi&gt;

On 15 January 2025 &quot;The Indian Express&quot; reported that an inquiry committee which was formed after US allegation regarding Gurpatwant Singh Pannun came to light had recommended legal action against an unnamed individual and the committee also recommended &quot;&quot;functional improvements in systems and procedures as well as initiation of steps that could strengthen India’s response capability, ensure systematic controls and coordinated action in dealing with matters like this&quot;.”

===Corruption cases===
* In the edition of 8 February 2010 &quot;Outlook Magazine&quot; reported on former R&amp;AW Chief, Ashok Chaturvedi, using Government of India funds to take his wife along on international trips. After retirement, Chaturvedi had a diplomatic passport issued for himself and his wife. Per &quot;Outlook Magazine&quot;: &quot;Only grade &#x27;A&#x27; ambassadors—usually IFS officers posted in key countries like the UK and US—are allowed to hold diplomatic passports after retirement. The majority, who do not fit that bill, hold passports issued to ordinary citizens. In fact, all former R&amp;AW chiefs Outlook spoke to confirmed they had surrendered their diplomatic passports the day they retired. And their spouses weren&#x27;t entitled to diplomatic passports even while they were in service.&quot;
* In September 2007, R&amp;AW was involved in a controversy due to a high-profile CBI raid at the residence of Major General (retired) V K Singh, a retired Joint Secretary of R&amp;AW who has recently written a book on R&amp;AW where it was alleged that political interference and corruption in the intelligence agency has made it vulnerable to defections. One of the instances of corruption mentioned in the book was the preference given by R&amp;AW departments towards purchasing intelligence from the Rohde and Schwarz company. A reason for such corruption as explained by the author is that &quot;...R&amp;AW was not answerable to any outside agency – the control of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office was perfunctory, at best – many officers thought that they were not only above the law but a law unto themselves.&quot; A case under the Official Secrets Act has also been filed against V K Singh.
* On 19 August 2008 the R&amp;AW Director (Language) who was also head of the R&amp;AW Training Institute in Gurgaon from 2005 tried to commit suicide in front of Prime Minister&#x27;s Office, alleging inaction and wrong findings to a sexual harassment complaint filed against a Joint Secretary, who was on deputation to R&amp;AW. She was discharged from duty on the ground that she was mentally unfit and that her identity was disclosed. She was later separately charged with criminal trespass, human trafficking and for her repeated attempts to commit suicide. The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) ordered R&amp;AW to reinstate her however R&amp;AW filed an appeal against the CAT order which is pending before Delhi High Court. On 20 January 2011 she was sent for psychological evaluation and medical detention by a Delhi High Court judge when she tried to strip herself in the court protesting over the slow pace of her trial. The psychological evaluation report stated that &#x27;she may be suffering a mental problem due to loss of job and her continuous run-ins at the courts, but she was certainly not suffering from any permanent or grave mental disorder.&#x27; On 15 December 2014, the Supreme Court of India quashed the 2008 media release, which proclaimed Ms. Bhatia as mentally unstable, on the ground that it affected the &quot;dignity, reputation and privacy of a citizen&quot;.
* A senior technical officer was arrested by CBI on graft charges, on 4 February 2009. The scientist, a Director level employee, worked in the division that granted export licenses to companies dealing in &quot;sensitive&quot; items, including defence-related equipment. He was accused of demanding and accepting a bribe of ₹ 100,000 from a Chennai based manufacturer for obtaining an export license.
* In September 2009, seven Additional Secretaries from the RAS cadre had gone on protest leave after A. B. Mathur, an IPS officer, superseded them to the post of Special Secretary. Over the years the tussle between the RAS cadre and officers on deputation from IPS cadre has caused friction in the working of the agency.

===Defections and spy scandals===
* In the early 1980s, K.V. Unnikrishnan, a 1962 batch IPS officer, who was posted at R&amp;AW station in Colombo was honey-trapped by CIA. Between 1985 and 1987 when he was deputed as the station chief at Chennai, coordinating Sri Lanka operations, he gave away information to his handler on training and arming Tamil groups including LTTE, the Indian government&#x27;s negotiating positions on the peace accord with Sri Lanka and the encryption code used by the agency. He was caught by IB counterintelligence in 1987, spent a year in Tihar jail and was dismissed from IPS cadre.
* In 2004, there was a spy scandal involving the CIA. Rabinder Singh, Joint Secretary and the head of R&amp;AW&#x27;s South-East Asia department, defected to America on 5 June 2004. R&amp;AW had already become suspicious about his movements, and he was under surveillance for a very long time. Soon he was confronted by Counterintelligence officials on 19 April 2004. Despite all precautions, Rabinder Singh managed to defect with &#x27;sensitive files&#x27; he had allegedly removed from R&amp;AW&#x27;s headquarters in south New Delhi. This embarrassing fiasco and national security failure were attributed to weak surveillance, shoddy investigation, and lack of coordination between the Counterintelligence and Security, Intelligence Bureau (IB) and R&amp;AW. According to unconfirmed reports, Singh has surfaced in Virginia, USA. Recently in an affidavit submitted to the court, R&amp;AW deposed that Singh has been traced in New Jersey. It has been speculated in the book &quot;Mission R&amp;AW&quot; that although the CIA was found directly involved in compromising Singh and Unnikrishnan, at least eight other R&amp;AW officers managed to clandestinely migrate and settle in foreign countries like the US and Canada with the help of their spy agencies.
* In 2007, there was a spy scandal involving Bangladesh. A Bangladeshi DGFI agent concealed his nationality before joining R&amp;AW, and was known by the name of Diwan Chand Malik in the agency. He was known to have some important intel which was damaging for the national security. He joined the agency in 1999 and used to live in East Delhi. A case of cheating and forgery was filed against him at the Lodhi Colony police station on the basis of a complaint by a senior R&amp;AW official.
* On 25 March 2016, Pakistan claimed that they arrested a R&amp;AW operative by the name of Kulbhushan Jadhav who was operating in Balochistan province under the cover name Hussain Mubarak Patel. Pakistan claimed that he was carrying a passport under that fake identity and used to operate a jewelry shop in Chahbahar, Iran. He is believed to be a serving commander-ranked officer in Indian Navy. According to a section of Pakistani media, he was involved in terrorist incidents in Karachi and Balochistan, most notably the terrorist attack on a bus full of Shia passengers in Safoora Goth, Karachi. However, Indian MEA said that though Jadhav was an Indian Navy officer who retired prematurely, he has no link with the government. The Indian High Commission has also sought consular access to Jadhav, but Pakistan has not agreed to it and Pakistan leaked some information without realising glaring loopholes in the same. The Iranian President Hassan Rouhani also dismissed Pakistan&#x27;s claim and stated them as mere rumors. According to an Indian official, Jadhav owns a cargo business in Iran and had been working out of Bandar Abbas and Chabahar ports. &quot;It appears that he strayed into Pakistani waters. But there is also a possibility that he was lured into Pakistan sometime back and fake documents were created on him.

==List of R&amp;AW Secretaries==
Most of the Secretaries of Research and Analysis Wing have been Indian Police Service (IPS) officers. R. N. Kao and K. Sankaran Nair belonged to the Imperial Police (IP), of the British colonial days which was renamed as the Indian Police Service after Indian Independence in 1947. N. F. Suntook had served in the Indian Navy, then in the Indian Police Service and in the Indian Frontier Administration Service. Vikram Sood was from the Indian Postal Service (IPoS) and was later permanently absorbed in the Research and Analysis Service (RAS) cadre. Now he acts as Advisor to Fair Observer. A. S. Dulat was an Indian Police Service officer deputed from the Intelligence Bureau. All the chiefs have been experts on China or Pakistan except for Ashok Chaturvedi, who was an expert on Nepal.

== In popular culture ==
Films in the 1960s and 1970s, such as &quot;Aankhen&quot; (1968), starring Dharmendra and Mala Sinha, &quot;Prem Pujari&quot; starring Dev Anand in 1970, and &quot;Hindustan Ki Kasam&quot; (1973) starring Raaj Kumar and Priya Rajvansh referenced &quot;agents&quot; and &quot;espionage&quot;. However, since the late 1990s and early 2000, Bollywood and other regional films have openly mentioned R&amp;AW and its allied units, with the intelligence agencies at the center of the plot. In &quot;The Hero&quot; (2003) film Sunny Deol played a RAW spy, who eliminates Pakistani terrorists who tried to gain bombs to use against India. In &quot;Romeo Akbar Walter&quot; (2019), John Abraham played the role of a spy recruited by the Research and Analysis Wing. In the film &quot;Mission Majnu&quot; (2023), Siddharth Malhotra played a secret raw field agent, Parmeet Sethi portrayed R.N. Kao while Sharib Hashmi, Kumud Mishra also played the role of undercover raw agents.
Ravindra Kaushik is RAW&#x27;s most celebrated spy. RAW selected him when he was a college student in his hometown Sri Ganganagar. Epic TV broadcast his biography in &quot;Adrishya,&quot; a documentary show dedicated to India&#x27;s legendary spies. In another episode India&#x27;s current NSA, former RAW agent Ajit Doval story was featured. The popular Malayalam film Highway, starring Suresh Gopi and Bhanupriya, is a major example for a South Indian film featuring R&amp;AW, and is the only Malayalam film to be so.

In 2023 film Khufiya directed by Vishal Bharadwaj actress Tabu played a role of RAW operative as Krishna Mehra &#x27;KM&#x27;. The movie was released on 5 October 2023 on Netflix.

In television channels in India, &quot;2612&quot; which used to air on Life OK, featured Cabir Maira as a R&amp;AW agent Anand Swami who helps an STF officer Randeep Rathore to save the country from a terrorist attack. &quot;Time Bomb 9/11&quot;, a series aired on Zee TV, featured Rajeev Khandelwal in the role of a R&amp;AW field officer who attempts to defuse a nuclear bomb set in India, as well as saving the life of the Indian prime minister. Zee Bangla featured a serial named &quot;Mohona&quot; where the chief protagonist is a R&amp;AW officer. &quot;Sajda Tere Pyar Mein&quot; a series on Star Plus, features Shaleen Bhanot in the role of a R&amp;AW officer who asks a young woman named Aliya for help in catching a spy named Mahendra Pratap. The Indian version of &quot;24&quot; has a host of characters affiliated with R&amp;AW. The 2018 web series &quot;Sacred Games&quot; has a R&amp;AW agent played by Radhika Apte. Foreign films which have actors playing R&amp;AW agents include Pakistan-based-films such as &quot;Waar&quot; (2013). is a Hindi-language war drama streaming television series directed by Santosh Singh for JioCinema. The series stars Ashutosh Rana, Ashish Vidyarthi, Jimmy Shergill, Lara Dutta, Aakanksha Singh, Mir Sarwar, Prasanna, Sikandar Kharbanda and others. The series was premeiered on 25 April 2024 on JioCinema.

Some academic commentators have linked the increasing surfeit of Indian films and TV series on espionage thriller genre, where an Indian hero staves off impending global catastrophe, as a marker of an aspirational &quot;Pax Indica&quot; not based on &#x27;older paradigms of internationalism based on universal brotherhood and non-violent pacifism associated with Gandhi and Nehru&#x27; but on the motif of an increasingly assertive potential superpower.

<text>The Purification Rundown, also known as the Purif or the Hubbard Method, is a pseudoscientific procedure that advocates of Scientology claim is a detoxification program. There is no evidence for its efficacy in detoxification, and significant evidence from clinicians that it is dangerous. It involves heat exposure for up to 5 hours a day and can exceed 4 weeks in length. It can potentially cause heatstroke damage, which includes brain injury, heart problems, organ failure, and death. It was developed by Scientology&#x27;s founder L. Ron Hubbard and used by the Church of Scientology as an introductory service. Numerous individuals have been hospitalised as a result of taking part in the process.

It has no known clinical use in treating drug addiction, but followers of Scientology believe it to be the only effective way to deal with the long-term effects of drug abuse or toxic exposure. It forms the basis for programs operated by groups affiliated with the Scientology organization, widely considered to be recruitment fronts, such as Narconon, Criminon, Second Chance, and the International Academy of Detoxification Specialists. The Scientology organization markets these as drug rehabilitation and detoxification programs. The program combines exercise, dietary supplements and long stays in a sauna (up to five hours a day for five weeks). It is promoted variously as religious or secular, medical or purely spiritual, depending on context. Hubbard put forward his ideas about niacin in a book called &quot;All About Radiation&quot;. He claimed to have discovered that large doses of vitamins could both alleviate and prevent radiation sickness. He marketed this anti-radiation mixture in the form of a tablet, calling it &quot;Dianazene&quot;. Twenty-one thousand such tablets were seized and destroyed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1958.

The 1979 predecessor of the Purification Rundown was known as the &quot;Sweat Program&quot; and was similarly designed to remove traces of LSD which, according to Hubbard, remained for long periods in the body. The participant had a restricted diet, including large doses of vitamins and a teaspoon of salt, and spent at least an hour a day jogging in a rubberised suit. For some, this regimen lasted for months.

The program was developed for use in Narconon, and was published in Hubbard&#x27;s &quot;Technical Bulletins of Dianetics and Scientology&quot; as well as the book &quot;Clear Body, Clear Mind&quot;. Two other books describe the procedure, &quot;Purification: An Illustrated Answer to Drugs&quot; and &quot;Narconon New Life Detoxification Program: the effective purification program by L. Ron Hubbard.&quot; The term &quot;Purification Rundown&quot; is a trademark of the Religious Technology Center (the governing body of the Church of Scientology), though an RTC spokesman has denied any licensing arrangement with Narconon.

== Process ==
The Purification Rundown usually takes several weeks. As well as spending time in saunas, people are required to do light exercise including calisthenics, treadmills, and other similar activities.

The program consists of a course of doses of vitamins (niacin in particular), long periods in a sauna, exercise, and consumption of a blend of vegetable oils, in the belief that the subject will sweat out the toxins and replace the oils in the body&#x27;s fatty tissues with the vegetable oil. &quot;Clear Body, Clear Mind&quot; recommends that participants maintain their normal diet throughout the procedure, supplemented with fresh vegetables.

The program requires its participants to ingest the following at regular intervals:
* A multi-vitamin cocktail, the main ingredient of which is niacin. &quot;Clear Body, Clear Mind&quot; recommends initial doses of 100 mg, increasing to 5,000 mg over the course of the program. This contrasts with the medically recommended level of about 15 mg: larger doses can have severe, even potentially fatal side effects. The participant is told to expect toxic symptoms due to the release of poisons or radiation from their body fat. Thus the effects of niacin overdose, which include skin irritation, flushing, dizziness and headache, are interpreted as a positive effect of the program.
* Mineral supplements, including calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, manganese, copper, iodine and potassium.
* Up to half a cupful of pure oils per day.
* &quot;CalMag&quot;, a drink which &quot;Clear Body, Clear Mind&quot; describes as a solution of calcium gluconate, magnesium carbonate and vinegar in water, in such proportions that the mix has twice as much elemental calcium as magnesium. This is taken up to three times per day.
* Enough liquids to replace the fluids lost in the sauna.

Hubbard specified that each participant must complete a daily report form, listing the amounts of vitamins, minerals, Cal-Mag and other fluids taken, which is reviewed to make sure they are complying with every aspect of the program.

The cost of the program was reported as about US$2,000 in 1990 $1,790 &quot;with discounts&quot; in 1996 (though another 1996 source claims around $4,000 for a four-week programme), $1,200 in 1998 and $5,200 in 2009.

&quot;Clear Body, Clear Mind&quot; contains a disclaimer which states that the program is not a medical treatment. A similar disclaimer appears in the Hubbard Communication Office Bulletins, noting that the treatment is not a medical process but a purely spiritual activity. Hubbard recommends that the participant should sign a waiver noting that the program is not medical treatment.

== Promotion ==
The Purification Rundown is promoted as having physical and mental benefits such as lowering cholesterol, relieving pain, and improving memory. Scientology&#x27;s promotional materials claim it can boost IQ by up to 15 points. Scientologists are strongly encouraged to take part in the program as a necessary step in their spiritual progress. Scientology promotes the Purification Rundown to the public as a detoxification program, while it also works with non-religious Scientology-affiliated groups such as Narconon to offer this program as a treatment for addiction and high levels of stress. Conditions that are claimed by Scientologists to respond to the program include cancer, AIDS, heart problems, kidney failure, liver disease and obesity.

In a January 1980 announcement, Hubbard told his followers that a nuclear war was an imminent threat and that the program would enable them to deal with heavy nuclear fallout. He warned that those who completed the program would stand better chances of survival.

The Church of Scientology unsuccessfully tried to have the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Hubbard for his invention of the program.

In California, two organizations were set up by Scientologists to try to give scientific legitimacy to the detoxification program—Foundation for Advancements in Science and Education (FASE) and HealthMed Clinic. Bill Franks, prior Executive Director International of the Church of Scientology, said he was involved in creating FASE and later described it as one of Scientology&#x27;s front groups. FASE funded research and published articles by Scientologists hailing the effectiveness of Hubbard&#x27;s procedures. HealthMed, an ostensibly independent organization, used this material to promote Hubbard&#x27;s detoxification methods to public agencies all over the state. Both bodies were strongly criticized by a group of physicians from the California Department of Health Services.

The program, as delivered by HealthMed, is heavily promoted in the book &quot;Diet for a Poisoned Planet&quot; by journalist David Steinman, who denies any connection with the Church of Scientology. The book was the subject of a paper from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration which accused Steinman of distorting facts. C. Everett Koop, the former Surgeon General of the United States, also criticized the book, recommending that the public stay away from Hubbard&#x27;s &quot;detoxification&quot; procedure.

==Reception==
===Theoretical basis===
The theory behind the Purification Rundown is that toxins, drugs, and radioactive particles are stored in body fat, which are released through the exchange of fats (thus the oil consumption) and exercise, and then finally released via perspiration and other normal mechanisms such as body waste. Independent scientific evaluations report that the concentration of toxins or drugs in the sweat is negligible, as they are primarily removed from the body through the liver, the kidneys and the lungs. The notion that toxins from fatty tissue can be sweated out is categorically denied by toxicology experts. Evidence offered has not demonstrated that detoxification is actually taking place.

A 1995 review at a medical conference described the massive doses of niacin as inappropriate, especially since they cause the release of histamine, which is counterproductive when dealing with chemical sensitivity. Psychologist Herman Staudenmayer describes the program as part of a trend for diagnosing and treating a Multiple Chemical Sensitivity disorder which does not correspond to any known disease and is likely to be psychophysiological. He adds, &quot;The position statements of medical societies [...] are unambiguous about the lack of scientific evidence for these practices.&quot;

In January 2005, a group of five doctors and nine health education experts acting on behalf of the California Department of Education issued a report examining Narconon and its materials. The report described the key assumptions of the program as unscientific and inaccurate. Three experts consulted by &quot;The Buffalo News&quot; criticised the weak evidence and dubious assumptions behind the program.

David Emerson Root, a medical doctor affiliated with Narconon, has administered the program for twenty years and stands by the theory behind it. A non-Scientologist, he denies that the program collects money or new members for Scientology.

===Effectiveness and safety===
An investigation by the &quot;New York Press&quot; asked a number of independent doctors about the evidence for the Purification Rundown. None of them endorsed the program&#x27;s effectiveness and some explicitly described it as dangerous. Several said that no peer-reviewed research on the program had been published in any medical journal. Some apparently supportive studies have been published, but these lack control groups and have other scientific failings.

&quot;Newkirk Herald Journal&quot; editor Robert W. Lobsinger solicited a number of medical experts&#x27; opinions on the program in 1989. James Kenney of the National Council Against Health Fraud condemned those administering the &quot;unproven&quot; treatment as guilty of health fraud. He wrote that &quot;[...] the scientific evidence shows the exact opposite of what Hubbard&#x27;s theory predicts&quot;, warning that large doses of niacin could cause liver damage, gout, gastritis, and other serious side-effects. Dr. David Hogg of Toronto said that the program may be detrimental to participants&#x27; health. Dr. C. Mark Palmer of Ponca City, Oklahoma rebutted the theory that sweating would clear out drugs, stating that &quot;No matter how much a patient were made to sweat, it could not significantly increase his clearing of most drugs.&quot;

After reviewing materials published by Narconon, University of Oklahoma biochemistry professor Bruce Roe described the program as &quot;a scam&quot; based on &quot;half-truths and pseudo-science.&quot; In a 1988 report, Dr. Ronald E. Gots, a toxicology expert from Bethesda, Maryland, called the regimen &quot;quackery&quot;, and noted that &quot;no recognized body of toxicologists, no department of occupational medicine, nor any governmental agencies endorse or recommend such treatment.&quot; In 1991, the Board of Mental Health in Oklahoma refused to certify the program for use in a Narconon facility on the grounds of potential danger from its high vitamin and mineral doses. A report on Narconon for the Department of Health in California described the mega-doses of vitamins as &quot;hazardous&quot; and &quot;in some cases lethal&quot;. Prof. Michael Ryan, a pharmacologist at University College Dublin, testified in a 2003 court case that the program is scientifically unverified and medically unsafe.

Those who market the program insist that it has been proven safe and effective. The marketing materials present testimonials for its effectiveness. Some doctors who have observed the treatment have been impressed by the testimonials but asked for evidence that improvements are caused by the program itself rather than suggestion, delusion or the placebo effect. In 2007, psychopharmacology expert John Brick said of his visit to a Manhattan clinic, &quot;Whether it&#x27;s from some mysterious combination of vitamins or just good diet and exercise, I can&#x27;t say. But the bottom line is that it helped the patients I talked to.&quot; He emphasized the importance of independently verifying the validity of the program, conceding that no causal relationship between the results and the program had been demonstrated.

In a 1999 French court case, five staff members of the Church of Scientology were convicted of fraud for selling the program and other Scientology procedures. In Russia, the program has been banned by officials as a threat to public health.

==Adverse outcomes==
Paride Ella and Giuseppe Tomba, clients of Narconon in Taceno, Italy, died in 1995 during the vitamin phase of the
program, suffering kidney problems and a heart attack respectively.

In 1996, journalist Mark Ebner described the case of a woman who had suffered heatstroke and anemia while on the program. 

In 1997, two emergency room doctors reported treating a 45-year-old man who had participated in the Purification Rundown. Previously healthy, he had developed tremors while on the program, for which the Church of Scientology recommended further Purification as treatment. Put back in the sauna, he developed seizures and was taken to hospital in an incoherent state. He was diagnosed with severe hyponatremia and required three days of medical treatment. In a similar case, a woman from Medina, Ohio required hospitalization after losing sleep and developing hallucinations during the program. In 2004, a former participant in the UK told reporters that the program had gravely worsened his physical condition, and that he had been denied medical treatment.

A 25-year-old man in Portland, Oregon died from liver failure after having participated in the Purification Rundown. His parents sued the Church of Scientology and the case was settled out of court. Scientology officials blamed the death on prior medical problems.

==Adoption by public bodies==
The City Council of Shreveport, Louisiana approved 20 firefighters to take the program via HealthMed in the late 1980s. The city&#x27;s insurers commissioned an evaluation from toxicologist Ronald E. Gots, who dismissed the program as &quot;quackery&quot;, saying it &quot;served no rational medical function.&quot; As a consequence, Shreveport ended its support.

In 1994, the London Borough of Tower Hamlets covered costs for an alcoholic to go to Narconon for detoxification, but the council withdrew funding when the Church of Scientology connection was revealed. The woman stayed on, funded by Narconon&#x27;s trustees.

===Second Chance===

&quot;Second Chance&quot; is a program administering the Purification Rundown to substance abuse offenders. Its first center was set up in Ensenada in 1995 with a mix of state and private funding. In October 2001, two officials from Erie County Holding Center in Buffalo, New York visited the Mexican center at a Scientology patron&#x27;s expense. They were impressed enough to appeal for $700,000 to introduce Second Chance to their own prison, although lack of funds put the project on hold.

In September 2006 a Second Chance project was set up in Albuquerque, New Mexico. This center took in hundreds of referrals in its first year but ran into financial trouble. Some judges, unconvinced of its effectiveness, refused to refer offenders. In October 2008, Curry County commissioners ended their contract with the project, after an independent study revealed the center had inflated its success rates. In the two years prior, the center had received $1.57 million in federal and state funding. In December 2008, the center was forced to close down after Mayor Martin Chavez accused it of &quot;misrepresentation and deceit&quot;.

===New York Rescue Workers Detoxification Project===
The New York Rescue Workers Detoxification Project is an initiative in New York City, co-founded by celebrity Scientologist Tom Cruise, which provides Purification Rundowns for public-sector employees who were exposed to toxins in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks. Its president claimed to have administered the program to over 800 rescue workers. Many participants have claimed positive results, and some local government figures have supported the project, which was awarded public funding. However, it has drawn criticism for exposing rescue workers to the potential dangers of the program, for encouraging them to give up conventional medical treatments, for recruiting into Scientology and for channeling funding to Scientology-related bodies.

===Utah Meth Cops Project===
Inspired by the New York project, a center in Orem, Utah administers the Purification Rundown to Salt Lake City police who complain of health effects from exposure to meth lab toxins. The process is administered under the name of Bio-Cleansing Centers of America and has received public money in addition to private donations. Many police who have taken part claim to have benefited, though a medical doctor associated with the Utah clinic acknowledged in 2007 that there were no studies of the program&#x27;s effect on people who had been exposed to meth labs.

The major supporter of the clinic has been State Attorney General Mark Shurtleff. In 2007 and 2008, his office spent $140,000 to pay for 20 police to take the program, and requested a total of $440,000 from the Utah State Legislature. The legislature advanced $240,000 of this further funding. In 2009, Republicans in the State Legislature approved an additional $100,000 for the project in the closing days of a session, bypassing a committee which would have reviewed the payment.

==Other endorsements==
Scientologist actress Kelly Preston endorsed the program and credited it for helping the health of her son Jett.

In a 1998 interview, Heber Jentzsch, president of the Church of Scientology International, credited the program with curing radiation sickness that he allegedly suffered as a result of childhood exposure to nuclear testing in Utah. No cases of radiation sickness have ever been reported in Utah, due to the low level of fallout involved, although some cases of leukemia may have been associated with the tests.

<text>The Pentozali or Pentozalis () is the trademark folk dance of the island of Crete. It takes its name from the fifth (&quot;pente&quot;) attempt or step (ζάλος being a Cretan Greek word for &quot;step&quot;) of the Cretan people to liberate Crete from the Ottoman Empire. It can thus be translated as &quot;five-steps&quot;. The name also contains an element of wordplay, as ‘ζάλη’ () means dizziness, and so it may also be interpreted as a dance that can make its dancers dizzy five times over (&quot;five-dizzy&quot;). In fact the dance has ten steps in total.

The Cretan violinist Stefanos Triantafillakis (1715–1800) is credited with composing the music for the dance in 1770–1771.

The Pentozali is a war dance, vigorous, with high jumping movements and allows for much improvisation. It starts either at a fast pace or at a moderate pace and accelerates progressively. The dancers hold each other by the shoulders and form an incomplete circle, which rotates counterclockwise very slowly, or sometimes not at all, because most of the lively steps are semi-stationary. The first dancer is expected to improvise whilst engaging in acrobatics: they and the second dancer link hands (as opposed to laying their arms over each other&#x27;s shoulders, as the other dancers in the line do) and the second dancer stands still and rigid, so that the first dancer is provided a more stable base from which to perform. Once the first dancer has finished their part, they are expected to break ranks and slowly dance their way towards the back of the line, yielding their place to the second dancer, and so on. This is thought to represent the line of succession of command in battle, if the leader is killed. Both men and women perform the dance, but the steps of the women&#x27;s dance were traditionally more restrained, because their long dress did not allow for high jumps. Traditional Cretan menswear, on the other hand, facilitates acrobatic dancing as it includes the black βράκα (), a variant of breeches that are worn tight around the waist and thighs and extremely baggy and loose around the hips.

Legend has it that when Turkish armies sailed to Crete in order to crush popular rebellions there, the Cretans would dance Pentozali and the Turkish would flee, fearing the dancers were demonic because of the speed and ferocity of their movement. It was even thought that it was a dance sent from god. Before battle, the Cretans danced it in order to demoralize opposing armies.

Pentozali music is instrumental: the main tune is played either on the violin or on the pear-shaped, bowed Cretan Lyra, to the accompaniment of a Laouto, played not in a melodic but in a more percussive or rhythmic fashion. It is the soloist who usually directs the flow of the dance: he improvises to signal the first dancer to improvise too, and resumes the main tune when it is time for the first dancer to yield his place to another.

Dances vary from island to island and it has become an everyday staple of Greek culture. Every island has their own version and their own style. A version of it is also popular in the Dodecanese islands in the Aegean sea.

<text>Ikariotikos () or Kariotikos (, sometimes written with an apostrophe as &#x27;Καριώτικος) is a traditional dance and accompanying song originating in Ikaria a Greek island in the North Eastern Aegean Sea. Some specialists say that the traditional Ikariotikos was slow, and that the quick &quot;version&quot; of it is a Ballos. The name Kariotikos is mostly used by the locals of Ikaria.

Is first danced with the arms in the basket weave hold then as the dance speeds up it is danced by the hand hold on the shoulders. There are three parts to the dance, In the first part of the dance we have slow moving walking steps (similar to a &quot;Sta Tria&quot;), while the second, part we move into a dance similar in steps to the Issios of Kalymnos and then in the third part we move into the quick steps with the mobility of both legs and body.

The most famous song that accompanies the Ikariotikos dance is called &quot;My love of Ikaria&quot;, lyrics and music are by Giorgos Konitopoulos. Music and dancing are major forms of entertainment in Ikaria. Throughout the year Ikarians host baptisms, weddings, parties and religious festivals where one can listen and dance to live traditional Ikarian music.

<text>Evolvability is defined as the capacity of a system for adaptive evolution. Evolvability is the ability of a population of organisms to not merely generate genetic diversity, but to generate &quot;adaptive&quot; genetic diversity, and thereby evolve through natural selection.

In order for a biological organism to evolve by natural selection, there must be a certain minimum probability that new, heritable variants are beneficial. Random mutations, unless they occur in DNA sequences with no function, are expected to be mostly detrimental. Beneficial mutations are always rare, but if they are too rare, then adaptation cannot occur. Early failed efforts to evolve computer programs by random mutation and selection showed that evolvability is not a given, but depends on the representation of the program as a data structure, because this determines how changes in the program map to changes in its behavior. Analogously, the evolvability of organisms depends on their genotype–phenotype map. This means that genomes are structured in ways that make beneficial changes more likely. This has been taken as evidence that evolution has created fitter populations of organisms that are better able to evolve.

== Alternative definitions ==

Andreas Wagner describes two definitions of evolvability. According to the first definition, a biological system is evolvable:
* if its properties show heritable genetic variation, and
* if natural selection can thus change these properties.

According to the second definition, a biological system is evolvable:
* if it can acquire novel functions through genetic change, functions that help the organism survive and reproduce.

For example, consider an enzyme with multiple alleles in the population. Each allele catalyzes the same reaction, but with a different level of activity. However, even after millions of years of evolution, exploring many sequences with similar function, no mutation might exist that gives this enzyme the ability to catalyze a different reaction. Thus, although the enzyme&#x27;s activity is evolvable in the first sense, that does not mean that the enzyme&#x27;s function is evolvable in the second sense. However, every system evolvable in the second sense must also be evolvable in the first.

Massimo Pigliucci recognizes three classes of definition, depending on timescale. The first corresponds to Wagner&#x27;s first, and represents the very short timescales that are described by quantitative genetics. He divides Wagner&#x27;s second definition into two categories, one representing the intermediate timescales that can be studied using population genetics, and one representing exceedingly rare long-term innovations of form.

Pigliucci&#x27;s second definition of evolvability includes Altenberg&#x27;s quantitative concept of evolvability, being not a single number, but the entire upper tail of the fitness distribution of the offspring produced by the population. This quantity was considered a &quot;local&quot; property of the instantaneous state of a population, and its integration over the population&#x27;s evolutionary trajectory, and over many possible populations, would be necessary to give a more global measure of evolvability.

==Generating more variation==
More heritable phenotypic variation means more evolvability. While mutation is the ultimate source of heritable variation, its permutations and combinations also make a big difference. Sexual reproduction generates more variation (and thereby evolvability) relative to asexual reproduction (see evolution of sexual reproduction). Evolvability is further increased by generating more variation when an organism is stressed, and thus likely to be less well adapted, but less variation when an organism is doing well. The amount of variation generated can be adjusted in many different ways, for example via the mutation rate, via the probability of sexual vs. asexual reproduction, via the probability of outcrossing vs. inbreeding, via dispersal, and via access to previously cryptic variants through the switching of an evolutionary capacitor. A large population size increases the influx of novel mutations in each generation. 

==Enhancement of selection==
Rather than creating more phenotypic variation, some mechanisms increase the intensity and effectiveness with which selection acts on existing phenotypic variation. For example:

* Mating rituals that allow sexual selection on &quot;good genes&quot;, and so intensify natural selection.
* Large effective population size increasing the threshold value of the selection coefficient above which selection becomes an important player. This could happen through an increase in the census population size, decreasing genetic drift, through an increase in the recombination rate, decreasing genetic draft, or through changes in the probability distribution of the numbers of offspring.
* Recombination decreasing the importance of the Hill-Robertson effect, where different genotypes contain different adaptive mutations. Recombination brings the two alleles together, creating a super-genotype in place of two competing lineages.
* Shorter generation time.

== Robustness and evolvability ==
The relationship between robustness and evolvability depends on whether recombination can be ignored. Recombination can generally be ignored in asexual populations and for traits affected by single genes.

=== Without recombination ===

Robustness in the face of mutation does not increase evolvability in the first sense. In organisms with a high level of robustness, mutations have smaller phenotypic effects than in organisms with a low level of robustness. Thus, robustness reduces the amount of heritable genetic variation on which selection can act. However, robustness may allow exploration of large regions of genotype space, increasing evolvability according to the second sense. Even without genetic diversity, some genotypes have higher evolvability than others, and selection for robustness can increase the &quot;neighborhood richness&quot; of phenotypes that can be accessed from the same starting genotype by mutation. For example, one reason many proteins are less robust to mutation is that they have marginal thermodynamic stability, and most mutations reduce this stability further. Proteins that are more thermostable can tolerate a wider range of mutations and are more evolvable. For polygenic traits, neighborhood richness contributes more to evolvability than does genetic diversity or &quot;spread&quot; across genotype space.

=== With recombination ===
Temporary robustness, or canalisation, may lead to the accumulation of significant quantities of cryptic genetic variation. In a new environment or genetic background, this variation may be revealed and sometimes be adaptive.

=== Factors affecting evolvability via robustness ===

Different genetic codes have the potential to change robustness and evolvability by changing the effect of single-base mutational changes. 

== Exploration ahead of time ==
When mutational robustness exists, many mutants will persist in a cryptic state. Mutations tend to fall into two categories, having either a very bad effect or very little effect: few mutations fall somewhere in between. Sometimes, these mutations will not be completely invisible, but still have rare effects, with very low penetrance. When this happens, natural selection weeds out the very bad mutations, while leaving the others relatively unaffected. While evolution has no &quot;foresight&quot; to know which environment will be encountered in the future, some mutations cause major disruption to a basic biological process, and will never be adaptive in any environment. Screening these out in advance leads to preadapted stocks of cryptic genetic variation.

Another way that phenotypes can be explored, prior to strong genetic commitment, is through learning. An organism that learns gets to &quot;sample&quot; several different phenotypes during its early development, and later sticks to whatever worked best. Later in evolution, the optimal phenotype can be genetically assimilated so it becomes the default behavior rather than a rare behavior. This is known as the Baldwin effect, and it can increase evolvability.

Learning biases phenotypes in a beneficial direction. But an exploratory flattening of the fitness landscape can also increase evolvability even when it has no direction, for example when the flattening is a result of random errors in molecular and/or developmental processes. This increase in evolvability can happen when evolution is faced with crossing a &quot;valley&quot; in an adaptive landscape. This means that two mutations exist that are deleterious by themselves, but beneficial in combination. These combinations can evolve more easily when the landscape is first flattened, and the discovered phenotype is then fixed by genetic assimilation.

==Modularity==
If every mutation affected every trait, then a mutation that was an improvement for one trait would be a disadvantage for other traits. This means that almost no mutations would be beneficial overall. But if pleiotropy is restricted to within functional modules, then mutations affect only one trait at a time, and adaptation is much less constrained. In a modular gene network, for example, a gene that induces a limited set of other genes that control a specific trait under selection may evolve more readily than one that also induces other gene pathways controlling traits not under selection. Individual genes also exhibit modularity. A mutation in one cis-regulatory element of a gene&#x27;s promoter region may allow the expression of the gene to be altered only in specific tissues, developmental stages, or environmental conditions rather than changing gene activity in the entire organism simultaneously.

==Evolution of evolvability==

While variation yielding high evolvability could be useful in the long term, in the short term most of that variation is likely to be a disadvantage. For example, naively it would seem that increasing the mutation rate via a mutator allele would increase evolvability. But as an extreme example, if the mutation rate is too high then all individuals will be dead or at least carry a heavy mutation load. Short-term selection for low variation most of the time is likely to be more powerful than long-term selection for evolvability, making it difficult for natural selection to cause the evolution of evolvability. Other forces of selection also affect the generation of variation; for example, mutation and recombination may in part be byproducts of mechanisms to cope with DNA damage.

When recombination is low, mutator alleles may still sometimes hitchhike on the success of adaptive mutations that they cause. In this case, selection can take place at the level of the lineage. This may explain why mutators are often seen during experimental evolution of microbes. Mutator alleles can also evolve more easily when they only increase mutation rates in nearby DNA sequences, not across the whole genome: this is known as a contingency locus.

The evolution of evolvability is less controversial if it occurs via the evolution of sexual reproduction, or via the tendency of variation-generating mechanisms to become more active when an organism is stressed. The yeast prion [PSI+] may also be an example of the evolution of evolvability through evolutionary capacitance. An evolutionary capacitor is a switch that turns genetic variation on and off. This is very much like bet-hedging the risk that a future environment will be similar or different. Theoretical models also predict the evolution of evolvability via modularity. When the costs of evolvability are sufficiently short-lived, more evolvable lineages may be the most successful in the long-term. However, the hypothesis that evolvability is an adaptation is often rejected in favor of alternative hypotheses, e.g. minimization of costs.

==Applications==
Evolvability phenomena have practical applications. For protein engineering we wish to increase evolvability, and in medicine and agriculture we wish to decrease it. Protein evolvability is defined as the ability of the protein to acquire sequence diversity and conformational flexibility which can enable it to evolve toward a new function.

In protein engineering, both rational design and directed evolution approaches aim to create changes rapidly through mutations with large effects. Such mutations, however, commonly destroy enzyme function or at least reduce tolerance to further mutations. Identifying evolvable proteins and manipulating their evolvability is becoming increasingly necessary in order to achieve ever larger functional modification of enzymes. Proteins are also often studied as part of the basic science of evolvability, because the biophysical properties and chemical functions can be easily changed by a few mutations. More evolvable proteins can tolerate a broader range of amino acid changes and allow them to evolve toward new functions. The study of evolvability has fundamental importance for understanding very long term evolution of protein superfamilies.

Many human diseases are capable of evolution. Viruses, bacteria, fungi and cancers evolve to be resistant to host immune defences, as well as pharmaceutical drugs. These same problems occur in agriculture with pesticide and herbicide resistance. It is possible that we are facing the end of the effective life of most of available antibiotics. Predicting the evolution and evolvability of our pathogens, and devising strategies to slow or circumvent the development of resistance, demands deeper knowledge of the complex forces driving evolution at the molecular level.

A better understanding of evolvability is proposed to be part of an Extended Evolutionary Synthesis.

<text>The television industry in India is very diverse and produces thousands of programmes in many Indian languages. Nearly 87% of Indian households own a television. As of 2016, the country had over 900 channels of which 184 were pay channels. National channels operate in Hindi and English, in addition to channels in several other languages including Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, Bengali, Marathi, Odia, Punjabi, Assamese, Gujarati, Urdu, Bhojpuri, Kashmiri, Konkani and Haryanvi, among others. The Hindi, Telugu and Tamil language television industries are by far the largest television industries in India.

The national television broadcaster is Doordarshan, owned by Prasar Bharati. There are several commercial television broadcasters such as Culver Max Entertainment (Sony Pictures Networks), Disney Star, Viacom18 (owned by Reliance Industries through Network18 Group), Warner Bros. Discovery India and Zee Entertainment Enterprises, at the national level, and Sun TV Network and ETV Network at the regional level.

Currently, the major Hindi national general entertainment channels (GECs) that dominate pay television are StarPlus, Sony SAB, Sony Entertainment Television, Zee TV and Colors TV. Since 2019, free-to-air Hindi channels like Dangal and Goldmines have drastically increased in popularity due to their availability on DD Free Dish. Regional-language channels like Sun TV and Star Vijay (Tamil), Star Maa and Zee Telugu (Telugu), Asianet (Malayalam) and Star Pravah (Marathi) are also among the most popular television channels by viewership.

Unlike most other countries, major Indian entertainment channels do not air news, with some exceptions in South India like Sun TV and ETV. This is partly due to Indian media regulations prohibiting Foreign Direct Investment of more than 26% in print and broadcast news, and foreign-owned broadcasters like Star have exited news broadcast. Some broadcasters (such as ABP Group, India Today Group, TV9 and ITV Network) operate only news channels, while others (like NDTV and The Times Group) have both news and non-news channels, while Zee Media Corporation and Network18 Group operate independently of the Zee and Viacom18 entertainment channels, which have foreign shareholdings.

==History==
In January 1950, The Indian Express reported that a television was put up for demonstration at an exhibition in the Teynampet locality of Chennai (formerly Madras) by B. Sivakumaran, a student of electrical engineering. A letter was scanned and its image was displayed on a cathode-ray tube screen. The report said that &quot;It may be this is not the whole of television but it is certainly the most significant link in the system&quot; and added that the demonstration of the sort could be the &quot;first in India&quot;.

The first TV transmitter in India was installed in the Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering Department of the Jabalpur Engineering College on 24 October 1951.

In Srinagar, television was first used in the house of the Jan family, which was a huge milestone for industrialisation.

In 1952, the government&#x27;s Scientific Advisory Committee for Broadcasting recommended the creation of a pilot station to showcase television&#x27;s potential to viewers. A television demonstration was held in Bombay from 10 to 12 October 1954. In 1955, an officer of All India Radio went to the United States to study telecommunications. The trip would give stamina to AIR&#x27;s first experimental television station. An experiment was conducted at the American Pavillion of the 1955 Indian Industries Fair, which opened on 29 October 1955, with PM Nehru being the first face to appear on television in India. Existing radio networks were open to start a television network.

Terrestrial television in India officially started with the experimental telecast starting in Delhi on 15 September 1959 with a small transmitter and a makeshift studio. Daily transmission began in 1965 as a part of Akashvani (formerly All India Radio AIR). Television service was later extended to Mumbai (formerly Bombay) and Amritsar in 1972. Up until 1975, only seven Indian cities had television services. Satellite Instructional Television Experiment (SITE) was an important step taken by India to use television for development. The programmes were mainly produced by Doordarshan (DD) which was then a part of AIR. The telecast happened twice a day, in the mornings and evenings. Other than information related to agriculture, health and family planning were the other important topics dealt with in these programmes. Entertainment was also included in the form of dance, music, drama, folk and rural art forms. Television services were separated from radio in 1976. The national telecast was introduced in 1982. In the same year, colour television was introduced in the Indian market. The introduction of colour television was sluggish compared to other countries, taking into account rampant poverty, the cost of conversion and the late arrival of television to cities such as Bengaluru, whose television station switched on in November 1981. By contrast, both Pakistan and Bangladesh already had colour television. The return of Indira Gandhi to government also enabled the improvement of radio and television infrastructure. In 1983, Minister H.K.L. Bhagat suggested that the conversion to colour television would be complete by 1985, by then with a possible 17-hour daily schedule, as well as a project to launch 70 new low-powered transmitters to increase its reach to virtually every city and city cluster.

Indian small-screen programming began in the early 1980s. During this time, there was only one national channel, the government-owned Doordarshan. Mythological TV series Ramayan and Mahabharat, both based on the Indian epics of the same names, were the first major television series produced. They notched up a world record in viewership numbers. By the late 1980s, more people began to own television. Though there was a single channel, television programming had reached saturation. Hence, the government initiated another service, which had part national programming and part regional. The channel, known as DD Metro (formerly DD 2) was broadcast terrestrially along with DD National. In 1997, Prasar Bharati, a statutory autonomous body was established. Doordarshan along with AIR were converted into government corporations under Prasar Bharati. The Prasar Bharati Corporation was established to serve as the public service broadcaster of the country which would achieve its objectives through AIR and Doordashan. This was a step towards greater autonomy for Doordarshan and AIR. However, Prasar Bharati has not succeeded in shielding Doordarshan from government control.

The transponders of the American satellites PAS-1 and PAS-4 helped in the transmission and broadcast of Doordarshan&#x27;s television services. An international channel called DD International was launched in 1995 and it broadcast programmes for 19 hours a day to foreign countries via PAS-4 to Europe, Asia and Africa and PAS-1 to North America.

The 1980s was the &quot;Golden Era of Doordarshan&quot; with various shows like Hum Log (1984–1985), Wagle Ki Duniya (1988), Buniyaad (1986–1987) and comedy shows like Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi (1984) glued millions to Doordarshan and later on Chandrakanta (1994–1996). Hindi film songs-based programmes like Chitrahaar, Rangoli, Superhit Muqabla and crime thrillers like Karamchand, Byomkesh Bakshi. Shows targeted at children included Divyanshu Ki Kahaniyan, Vikram Aur Betaal, Malgudi Days, and Tenali Rama. It is also noted that Bengali filmmaker Prabir Roy had the distinction of introducing colour television coverage in India in February–March 1982 during the Nehru Cup, a football tournament which was held at Eden Gardens, Kolkata, with five on-line camera operation, before Doordarshan started the same during the 1982 Asian Games in November that year.

The central government, under the leadership of the Congress, launched a series of economic and social reforms in 1991 under the then-Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao. Under the new policies, the government allowed private and foreign broadcasters to engage in limited operations in India. This process has been pursued consistently by all subsequent federal administrations. Foreign broadcasters like CNN, the BBC and Disney Star and private domestic broadcasters such as ZEEL, ETV Network, Sun TV and Asianet started satellite broadcasts. Starting with 41 sets in 1962 and one channel, by 1995, television in India had covered more than 70 million homes giving a viewing population of more than 400 million individuals through more than 100 channels.

==Broadcast media==

There are at least five basic types of television in India: broadcast or &quot;over-the-air&quot; television, unencrypted satellite or &quot;free-to-air&quot;, Direct-to-Home (DTH), cable television, IPTV and OTT. Over-the-air terrestrial and free-to-air TV (such as DD Free Dish) is free with no monthly payments while cable, DTH, and IPTV require a subscription that varies depending on how many channels a subscriber chooses to pay for and how much the provider is charging for the packages. Channels are usually sold in groups or a la carte. All television service providers are required by law to provide the a la carte selection of channels. India is the second largest pay-TV market in the world in terms of subscribers after China and has more than doubled from 32% in 2001 to 66% in 2018.

===Terrestrial television===
In India, the broadcast of free-to-air television is governed through a state-owned Prasar Bharati corporation, with the Doordarshan group of channels being the only broadcaster. As such, cable television is the primary source of TV programming in India.

===Broadcast cable and satellite television===
As per the TAM Annual Universe Update – 2015, India had over 167 million households (out of 234 million) with televisions, of which over 161 million have access to cable or satellite television, including 84 million households which are DTH subscribers. Digital TV households have grown by 32% since 2013 due to migration from terrestrial and analogue broadcasts. TV-owning households have been growing at between 8–10%. Digital TV penetration is at 64% as of September 2014. India now has over 850 TV channels (2018) covering all the main languages spoken in the nation and whereby 197 million households own televisions.

The growth in digital broadcast has been due to the introduction of a multi-phase digitization policy by the Government of India. An ordinance was introduced by the government regarding the mandatory digitisation of cable services. According to this amendment made in Section 9 of the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Amendment Ordinance, 1995, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting is in the process of making the Digital Addressable System mandatory. As per the policy, viewers would be able to access digital services only through a set-top box.

Starting in December 1991, Star TV introduced four major television channels into the Indian broadcasting space that had so far been monopolised by the Indian government-owned Doordarshan: MTV, STAR Plus, Star Movies, BBC World Service Television and Prime Sports. In October 1992, India saw the launch of Zee TV, the first privately owned Indian channel to broadcast over cable followed by the Asia Television Network (ATN). A few years later CNN, Discovery Channel and National Geographic made their foray into India. Later, Star TV Network expanded its bouquet with the introduction of STAR World, STAR Sports, ESPN, Channel V and STAR Gold.

With the launch of the Tamil Sun TV in 1993, South India saw the birth of its first private television channel. With a network comprising more than 20 channels in various South India languages, Sun TV network recently launched a DTH service and its channels are now available in several countries outside India. Following Sun TV, several television channels sprung up in the south. Among these are the Tamil channel Raj TV (1993) and the Malayalam channel Asianet launched in 1993 from Asianet Communications, which was later acquired by Disney Star. Asianet Cable Network and Asianet Broadband were from Asianet Communication Ltd. These three networks and their channels today take up most of the broadcasting space in South India. In 1994, industrialist N. P. V. Ramasamy Udayar launched a Tamil channel called &quot;GEC&quot; (Golden Eagle Communication), which was later acquired by Vijay Mallya and renamed as Vijay TV. In Telugu, Telugu daily newspaper Eenadu started its television division called ETV Network in 1995 and later diversified into other Indian languages. The same year, another Telugu channel called Gemini TV was launched which was later acquired by the Sun TV Network in 1998.

Throughout the 1990s, along with a multitude of Hindi-language channels, several regional and English-language channels flourished all over India. By 2001, international channels HBO and The History Channel started providing service. In 1995–2003, other international channels such as Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, VH1 and Toon Disney entered the market. Starting in 2003, there has been an explosion of news channels in various languages; the most notable among them are NDTV 24x7, NDTV India, CNN-News18, Times Now and Aaj Tak.

==== Conditional Access System ====
CAS, or conditional access system, is a digital mode of transmitting TV channels through a set-top box (STB). The transmission signals are encrypted and viewers need to buy a set-top box to receive and decrypt the signal. The STB is required to watch only pay channels.

The idea of CAS was mooted in 2001, due to a furore over charge hikes by channels and subsequently by cable operators. Poor reception of certain channels; arbitrary pricing and increase in prices; bundling of channels; poor service delivery by Cable Television Operators (CTOs); monopolies in each area; lack of regulatory framework and redress avenues were some of the issues that were to be addressed by implementation of CAS

It was decided by the government that CAS would be first introduced in the four metros. It has been in place in Chennai since September 2003, where, until very recently, it had managed to attract very few subscribers. It has been rolled out recently in the other three metros of Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata.

 Only 25 per cent of the people have subscribed to the new technology. The rest watch only free-to-air channels. As mentioned above, the inhibiting factor from the viewer&#x27;s perspective is the cost of the STB.

===Analogue switchover===
The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting issued a notification on 11 November 2011, setting 31 March 2015 as the deadline for complete shift from analogue to digital systems. In December 2011, Parliament passed the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Amendment Act to digitise the cable television sector by 2014. Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai had to switch by 31 October 2012. The second phase of 38 cities, including Bangalore, Chandigarh, Nagpur, Patna, and Pune, was to switch by 31 March 2013. The remaining urban areas were to be digitised by 30 November 2014 and the rest of the country by 31 March 2015.
†

====Phase I====
From midnight on 31 October 2012, analogue signals were switched off in Delhi and Mumbai. Pirated signals were available in parts of Delhi even after the date. In Kolkata, on 30 October 2012, the state government refused to switch off analogue signals citing low penetration of set-top boxes (STBs) required for receiving digital signals. The Ministry did not push for switching off of analogue signals in Kolkata. After approximately the Centre estimated that 75% of Kolkata households had installed STBs, the ministry issued a directive to stop airing analogue channels in some parts of the city beginning 16 December and completely switch off analogue signals after 27 December. On 17 December 2012, the West Bengal government openly defied the directive and stated that it would not implement it. The state government then announced that it would extend the deadline to 15 January 2013. The Ministry had initially threatened to cancel the licence of multi system operators (MSOs) in Kolkata if they did not switch off all analogue channels. However, the ministries softened their stand following a letter from MSOs, explaining how they were sandwiched between divergent orders from the Central and State Governments.

In Chennai, the deadline was extended twice to 5 November by the Madras High Court. The extension was in response to a petition filed by the Chennai Metro Cable TV Operators Association (CMCOA), who argued at the beginning of November that only 1,64,000 homes in Chennai had the proper equipment, and three million households would be left without service. When a week later only a quarter of households had their set-top boxes, the Madras High Court further extended the deadline to 9 November. The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting stated that it would allow an additional extension to 31 December. As of March 2013, out of 3 million subscribers, 2.4 million continued to be without set-top boxes.

A similar petition, filed by a local cable operator (LCO), to extend the deadline in Mumbai was rejected by the Bombay High Court on 31 October 2012.

====Phase II====
In the second phase, 38 cities in 15 states had to digitise by 31 March 2013. Of the 38, Maharashtra has 9 cities, Uttar Pradesh has 7 and Gujarat has 5.

About 25% of the 16 million households covered did not have their equipment installed before the deadline. Secretary Uday Kumar Varma extended a 15-day grace period. The Ministry estimated that as of 3 April 2013, 25% of households did not have set-top boxes. Enforcement of the switchover varied from city to city. Vishakhapatnam had the lowest rate of conversion to the new system at 12.18 per cent. Other cities that had low figures included Srinagar (20 per cent), Coimbatore (28.89 per cent), Jabalpur (34.87 per cent) and Kalyan Dombivli (38.59 per cent).

===Satellite television===
As of 2016, over 1600 TV satellite television channels are broadcast in India. This includes channels from the state-owned Doordarshan, Disney India owned Star, Sony owned Sony Entertainment Television, Zee TV, Sun TV Network and Asianet. Direct To Home service is provided by Airtel Digital TV, DD Free Dish, DishTV, Sun Direct, Tata Play and Videocon D2H. Dish TV was the first one to come up in Indian Market, others came only years later.

These services are provided by locally built satellites from ISRO such as INSAT 4CR, INSAT 4A, INSAT-2E, INSAT-3C and INSAT-3E as well as private satellites such as the Dutch-based SES, Global-owned NSS-6, Thaicom-2 and Telstar 10.

DTH is defined as the reception of satellite programmes with a personal dish in an individual home. As of December 2012, India had roughly 54  million DTH subscribers.

DTH does not compete with CAS. Cable TV and DTH are two methods of delivery of television content. CAS is integral to both systems in delivering pay channels.

Cable TV is through cable networks and DTH is wireless, reaching direct to the consumer through a small dish and a set-top box. Although the government has ensured that free-to-air channels on cable are delivered to the consumer without a set-top box, DTH signals cannot be received without the set-top box.

India currently has 6 major DTH service providers and a total of over 54  million subscriber households as of December 2012. DishTV (a ZEE TV subsidiary), Tata Play, d2h, Sun Network owned &#x27; Sun Direct DTH&#x27;, Bharti Airtel&#x27;s DTH Service &#x27;Airtel Digital TV&#x27; and the public sector DD Free Dish. As of 2012, India has the most competitive Direct-broadcast satellite market, with 7 operators vying for more than 135  million TV homes. India overtook the US as the world&#x27;s largest Direct-broadcast satellite market in 2012.

The rapid growth of DTH in India has propelled an exodus from cabled homes, and the need to measure viewership in this space is more than ever; aMap, the overnight ratings agency, has mounted a people meter panel to measure viewership and interactive engagement in DTH homes in India.

===Internet Protocol Television (IPTV)===
There are IPTV Platforms available for subscription in India in the main cities as broadband in many parts of the country, they are
*iControl IPTV A joint venture between MTNL and BSNL also in association with Aksh Optifiber a company that also provides FTTH and VoIP services available in some of the main cities in India such as Mumbai which has about 200 television channels on offer with time shifting in several basic and premium Packages including Movies on Demand offered at various basic, premium and pay-per-view rates and other services such as an interactive karaoke channel, The IPTV operator uses the UTStarcom Rolling Stream IPTV Solution as its end-to-end Delivery Platform.
*Airtel IPT is available in some of the main cities in India such as New Delhi and Bangalore which have about 175 television channels on offer with time shifting in several TV packages and a small number of television channels offered on premium subscription rates including Movies on Demand offered at premium and pay-per-view rates SVOD and other services such as Digital Radio and Games, The IPTV Operator uses the UTStarcom RollingStream IPTV Solution as its end-to-end delivery platform.

*APSFL is an IPTV service provider. It was launched in 2016 and offers over 250 channels, out of which 49 are in HD. It is currently only available in Andhra Pradesh.

==Programming==
Indian television drama is by far the most common genre on Indian television. Fiction shows (including thriller dramas and sitcoms) are extremely popular among Indian audiences. There are thousands of television programmes in India, all ranging in length, air time, genre and language.

Major sports networks include Star Sports, Sony Sports Network, Eurosport, 1Sports and DD Sports.

==Advertising==
India has a huge advertising industry. In 2021, India&#x27;s advertising sector generated revenue worth ₹74,600 crore, which included type types advertising. Traditionally organisations and manufacturing industries used to advertise through Television due to its vast reach. Indian TV and print media frequently run advertisements are often types of Surrogate advertisings, False advertisings etc. Alcohol advertising is illegal in India but brands frequently run surrogate advertising campaigns. The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA), the consumer rights protection body of the Consumer Affairs Ministry issued guidelines against surrogate advertising.

==Audience metrics==
Television metrics in India have gone through several phases in which it fragmented, consolidated and then fragmented again. One key difference in Indian culture is that families traditionally limit themselves to owning only one screen. 

===DART===
During the days of the single-channel Doordarshan monopoly, DART (Doordarshan Audience Research Team) was the only metric available. This used the notebook method of recordkeeping across 33 cities across India. DART continues to provide this information independent of the Private agencies. DART is one of the rating systems that measure audience metrics in Rural India.

===TAM and INTAM===
In 1994, claiming a heterogeneous and fragmenting television market ORG-MARG (Operations Research Group - Multiple Action Research Group) introduced INTAM (Indian National Television Audience Measurement). Ex-Doordarshan officials claimed that INTAM was introduced by vested commercial interests who only sought to break the monopoly of DD and that INTAM was significantly weaker in both sample size, rigour and the range of cities and regions covered.

In 1997, a joint industry body appointed TAM (backed by Nielsen Corporation) as the official recordkeeper of audience metrics. Due to the differences in methodology and samples of TAM and INTAM, both provided differing results for the same programmes.

In 2001, a confidential list of households in Mumbai that were participating in the monitoring survey was released, calling into question the reliability of the data. This subsequently led to the merger of the two measurement systems into TAM. For several years after this, despite misgivings about the process, sample and other parameters, TAM was the de-facto standard and monopoly in the audience metrics game.

===AMAP===
In 2004, a rival ratings service funded by American NRI investors, called Audience Measurement Analytics Limited (AMAP) was launched. Although initially, it faced a cautious uptake from clients, the TAM monopoly was broken.

What differentiates aMap is that its ratings are available within one day as compared to TAM&#x27;s timeline of one week.

===BARC India===
Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) India is an industry body set up to design, commission, supervise and own an accurate, reliable and timely television audience measurement system for India. It currently measures the TV Viewing habits of 183 million TV households in the country, using 30,000 sample panel homes. This will go up to 50,000 in the next couple of years, as mandated by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB).

As per the Broadcast Audience Research Council&#x27;s Broadcast India (BI) 2018 Survey released in July 2018, based on a sample of 3 lakh homes in the country, TV homes in the country have seen a 7.5% jump, outpacing the growth of homes in India which grew at 4.5%. India currently boasts 298 million homes, of which 197 million have a TV set, having an opportunity to almost 100 more TV homes in the country.

Guided by the recommendations of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) and Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) notifications of January 2014, BARC India brings together the three key stakeholders in television audience measurement – broadcasters, advertisers, and advertising and media agencies, via their apex bodies.

BARC India is committed to establishing a robust, transparent and accountable governance framework for providing data points that are required to plan media spending more effectively.

The role of television media was especially crucial in 2020 as citizens were asked to stay home to fight the pandemic in India. Talking about how media was used as a tool to instil fear and discipline among the public in India during the lockdown, an article in the Doing Sociology blog discusses how television has so become part and parcel of life, the audio-visual platform was used for image-building and influence by the ruling dispensation on one hand, and utilized by popular brands for keeping the consumer culture up on the other.

==Effect of OTT on the Indian television industry ==
Online video streaming, also known as Over-the-top (OTT) services gained popularity in India after 2015. It created a threat to the Indian television industry. TV viewers have to follow the schedule of TV channels to watch their favourite programmes. On the other hand, OTT service providers allow their users to watch their favourite content whenever they want. Moreover, penetration of Internet access in India helps OTT users to access content from anywhere. This convenience of OTT has helped it to gain popularity among young internet users in India. The usage of OTT significantly increased during the national lockdown period (From March 2020 onwards) after the COVID-19 pandemic in India. More people began to watch OTT platforms for foreign content and their spending on TV was significantly reduced.

<text>Worsbrough Mill, also known as Worsbrough Corn Mill and Worsbrough Mill Farm is a complex of buildings including a seventeenth-century water-powered mill and a nineteenth-century steam-powered mill in Worsbrough, Barnsley, England. The mill is open to the public and takes its water from the River Dove, but is hydraulically separate from Worsbrough Reservoir.

Note that &quot;Worsbrough&quot; refers to an area that includes today&#x27;s Worsbrough Bridge, Worsbrough Dale, and Worsbrough Village etc.

==Worsbrough Mill Country Park==
Worsbrough Mill is located in the 240-acre Worsbrough Country Park, about 2 miles south of Barnsley on the A61, close to the M1 motorway. It includes the 60-acre Worsbrough Reservoir, which was built for the opening of the Dearne and Dove Canal in 1804.

The park includes footpaths and cyclepaths that meander through Willow Carr and around the circumference of the reservoir. Fishing is available in the upper pond and canal basin.

==History==
&quot;A&quot; Worsbrough Mill was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 and the first Curator, [Rob Shorland-Ball – 1975 to 1979] researched the history and states that a &quot;tenuous but continuous documentary record can be traced from then to 1625 which is the likely date for the building of the existing Old Mill. Whether the pre-1625 mill(s) were on the same site is not known. However, a mill was a very important part of the feudal pattern of life and settlement and thus tended to remain on the same site if that site was a satisfactory one&quot;.

==Buildings==
The oldest building (the &quot;Old Mill&quot;) is a two-storey watermill with massive lintels over the doors; it is operational and mills a small amount of grain. There is some doubt over the date of construction; there are no dates on or in the buildings (with one exception) but 1625 has been stated (by Shorland-Ball) to be &quot;acceptably representative&quot;.

The New Mill was originally steam-driven and contained a Watt-type beam engine which was scrapped in 1922. During the restoration of the mill buildings in the 1960s and early 1970s, a 1911 model Hornsby hot bulb oil engine originally from Sykehouse Windmill was installed by Geoff Hatfield (Millwright). The engine still functions, but is not linked to the millstones in the New Mill. The building is known to have been completed 1843 but was not present on a detailed map of 1840.

<doc id="812156" wikidata="Q5196412" url="?curid=812156" title="Custom wheel">
<text>The term custom wheel refers to the wheels of a vehicle which have either been modified from the vehicle manufacturer&#x27;s standard or have replaced the manufacturer&#x27;s standard.

==Uses==
Custom wheels are one of the most common ways in which automobile enthusiasts customize their vehicles. Competition-oriented enthusiasts typically switch to lighter, stronger, or larger wheels, while appearance-oriented enthusiasts more often choose larger and more visually distinctive wheels.

The most-desirable characteristics of custom wheels vary with owner&#x27;s goals:

==Popularity==
Custom wheels are increasing in popularity year after year. Nearly one-third of all new-vehicle buyers customize their vehicles with custom wheels. Custom wheel spinners for custom wheels then came about in the late 1990s and got extremely popular in the new millennium. The popularity has even grown further by the introduction of larger wheel and spinner diameters such as 18&quot; / 20&quot; / 22&quot; / 24&quot; / 26&quot; and even up to 30&quot; inch wheels diameters.

==Custom wheel spinners==

Custom wheel spinners also known as &quot;Tru-Spinners&quot; and &quot;free-spinning spinners&quot; were a decorative kinetic attachment to the center of the wheel of an automobile that would continue to rotate after the wheel had stopped. Many were normal sized to the center of the wheel and then some were enlarged spinners as the wheel market experienced a demand for larger and larger diameter wheels and spinners. Some would also cover the entire wheel rim on some applications, hence the name &quot;spinner rims&quot;. They operated when the automobile wheel stopped rotating the Tru-Spinners would continue to stay in motion spinning. Then once Tru-Spinners had stopped spinning and were in a stationary position, they would not start to spin again until the wheel started rotating and again picking up momentum from the rotating wheel itself. They were designed to independently rotate and spin by using one or more roller bearings to isolate the spinner from the wheel, enabling it to spin while the wheel is at rest. In the early stages of the invention during the mid 1990s, the Tru-Spinners invention was only used on custom cars and on show cars in competitions which continued on into the 2000s. The spinner wheels were invented by American inventor James J.D. Gragg of the United States who was awarded spinner patent, United States Patent #5,290,094 on March 4, 1994 with foreign patents to follow.

Later at the turn of the new millennium the popularity grew worldwide and other patents were issued within the United States. On April 29, 2003, David Fowlkes was issued a United States patent for a free-spinning spinner wheel patent #6,554,370. When Fowlkes could not get a booth at the Los Angeles Car Show, he asked Latrell Sprewell to allow him to showcase them there in his booth. This is where many people started to mistakenly believe that Latrell Sprewell, professional NBA basketball player, had invented them and so went the nickname in the rap music community calling them &quot;Sprewells&quot; as some rap music even included nickname in the lyrics of rap songs.

==Finishes==
Custom wheels come in many different finishes. The most common custom wheel finishes are Chrome, Polished and Painted. Chrome wheels consist of traditional chrome plating as well as the new process of PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) Chrome. PVD chrome wheels are protected with a clear coat and are now being introduced by several wheel companies. Polished wheels are simply aluminum wheels that have been polished to a shine. Polished wheels may or may not be protected by a clear coat. Polished wheels that do not have a clear coat are prone to oxidation and may require periodic polishing to maintain its finish. Painted wheels come in many different colors and may also have a machined surface incorporated into it. Silver and black painted wheels are the most common painted finishes. Painted wheels are protected with a clear coat.

==Physics==
At some point, the performance advantage of larger wheels and reduced-profile tires meets the performance disadvantage of increased inertia and increased unsprung weight. This point varies depending on the vehicle, style of wheel, and driving style; however, most vehicles do not see a performance increase when rims are more than two sizes larger than original-equipment specifications. Appearance-oriented enthusiasts may feel that decreased performance and an increased risk of road damage from the use of oversized rims is a worthwhile price to pay for the look they want.

== Weight ==
Beyond upsizing aimed at attractive looks, some educated consumers, along with racing professionals and motorsports hobbyists, are customizing their wheels primarily for the purpose of weight reduction. True-forged wheels are up to 30% lighter than regular/standard OEM cast wheels. An additional 20% in weight can be saved by upgrading to forged magnesium wheels, such as those employed by F1 and MotoGP teams.

Three companies are known to produce true-forged magnesium wheels:

* BBS Japan
* Tan-ei-sya (TWS)
* SMW Wheels
Those aficionados who employ Mg wheels confirm improved handling, especially during turns, as well as tangible lap-time reduction on a circuit.

==Theft==
Newer aftermarket rims may be worth thousands of dollars. Owners use special lug nuts, called wheel locks, to secure them, although it renders the vehicle difficult to service, and there are doubts as to how well the locks thwart determined thieves.

She was well known for her distinctive voice and imperious enunciation. She featured on the BBC World Service for Africa, which was broadcast in the UK. She became popular in the United Kingdom, appearing on television, where she was the first black woman to appear on British television as well as being the first African to appear on &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot; in 1972. She also appeared on television dramas such as &quot;The Professionals&quot;, &quot;The Bill&quot; and &quot;Casualty&quot;. She performed on British television, radio, stage and films for more than four decades.

Edwards appeared in cameo roles in many British television comedy programmes, including &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot;, &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;, &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, &quot;Black Books&quot;, &quot;Spaced&quot; and &quot;Little Britain&quot;, in which she had been planned to appear in the second series before her death.

As well as acting she was a school governor and owned a restaurant called Auntie J&#x27;s in Brixton.

In the early 1970s, she married a Ghanaian, Edmund Clottey, and they had a daughter and two sons.

Jeillo Edwards died in London on 2 July 2004, at the age of 61. She had suffered chronic kidney problems.

<text>The Atractaspididae (atractaspidids) are a family of venomous snakes found in Africa and the Middle East, commonly calledmole vipers, stiletto snakes, or burrowing asps. Currently, 12 genera are recognized.

==Description==
This family includes many genera formerly classed in other families and subfamilies, on the basis of fang type. It includes fangless (aglyphous), rear-fanged (opisthoglyphous), fixed-fanged (proteroglyphous), and viper-like (solenoglyphous) species. Early molecular and physiological data linking this subfamily to others were ambiguous and often contradictory, which means the taxonomy of this subfamily has been highly contentious. The nominate family, Atractaspididae, has itself been moved to and from other taxa, such as potentially forming a trichotomy with Elapidae and Colubridae, reinforcing the ambiguity of this subfamily.

==Geographic range==
This subfamily is found in Africa and the Middle East.

==Venom==
Many of these snakes are inoffensive or far too small to envenomate a person effectively. However, some can inflict severe tissue necrosis; e.g. if the victim&#x27;s thumb is bitten, the tip of that digit may be lost. Relapses may occur long after the bite. The bites of stiletto snakes are often exceptionally painful.

Very few deaths have resulted from accidents with these snakes, although large individuals of &quot;Atractaspis microlepidota&quot; and other long-glanded species are very likely to be dangerous. Some of the long-fanged species are able to stab their prey (or an unfortunate human) even while their mouths are closed, and the typical grasp used by herpetologists to securely hold venomous snakes is not safe for this group. This ability to stab sideways even with a closed mouth is the basis for an English name used for some of them: &quot;side-stabbing snakes&quot; or &quot;side-stabbers&quot;.

==Genera==
==Taxonomy==
This family was previously classified as a subfamily of the Colubridae: the Aparallactinae.

<text>Poison dart frog (also known as dart-poison frog, poison frog or formerly known as poison arrow frog) is the common name of a group of frogs in the family Dendrobatidae which are native to tropical Central and South America. These species are diurnal and often have brightly colored bodies. This bright coloration is correlated with the toxicity of the species, making them aposematic. Some species of the family Dendrobatidae exhibit extremely bright coloration along with high toxicity — a feature derived from their diet of ants, mites and termites— while species which eat a much larger variety of prey have cryptic coloration with minimal to no amount of observed toxicity. Many species of this family are threatened due to human infrastructure encroaching on their habitats.

These amphibians are often called &quot;dart frogs&quot; due to the aboriginal South Americans&#x27; use of their to poison the tips of blowdarts. However, out of over 170 species, only four have been documented as being used for this purpose (curare plants are more commonly used for aboriginal South American darts) all of which come from the genus &quot;Phyllobates&quot;, which is characterized by the relatively large size and high levels of toxicity of its members.

== Characteristics ==
Most species of poison dart frogs are small, sometimes less than in adult length, although a few grow up to in length. They weigh 1 oz. on average. Most poison dart frogs are brightly colored, displaying aposematic patterns to warn potential predators. Their bright coloration is associated with their toxicity and levels of alkaloids. For example, frogs of the genus &quot;Dendrobates&quot; have high levels of alkaloids, whereas &quot;Colostethus&quot; species are cryptically colored and are not toxic.

Poison dart frogs are an example of an aposematic organism. Their bright coloration advertises unpalatability to potential predators. Aposematism is currently thought to have originated at least four times within the poison dart family according to phylogenetic trees, and dendrobatid frogs have since undergone dramatic divergences – both interspecific and intraspecific – in their aposematic coloration. This is surprising given the frequency-dependent nature of this type of defense mechanism.

Adult frogs lay their eggs in moist places, including on leaves, in plants, among exposed roots, and elsewhere. Once the eggs hatch, the adult piggybacks the tadpoles, one at a time, to suitable water: either a pool, or the water gathered in the throat of bromeliads or other plants. The tadpoles remain there until they metamorphose, in some species fed by unfertilized eggs laid at regular intervals by the mother.

== Habitat ==
Poison dart frogs are endemic to humid, tropical environments of Central and South America. These frogs are generally found in tropical rainforests, including in Bolivia, Costa Rica, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Suriname, French Guiana, Peru, Panama, Guyana, Nicaragua, and Hawaii (introduced).

Natural habitats include moist, lowland forests (subtropical and tropical), high-altitude shrubland (subtropical and tropical), moist montanes and rivers (subtropical and tropical), freshwater marshes, intermittent freshwater marshes, lakes and swamps. Other species can be found in seasonally wet or flooded lowland grassland, arable land, pastureland, rural gardens, plantations, moist savanna and heavily degraded former forest. Premontane forests and rocky areas have also been known to hold frogs. Dendrobatids tend to live on or close to the ground, but also in trees as much as from the ground.

== Taxonomy ==

Dart frogs are the focus of major phylogenetic studies, and undergo taxonomic changes frequently. The family Dendrobatidae currently contains 16 genera, with about 200 species.

=== Color morphs ===

Some poison dart frogs species include a number of conspecific color morphs that emerged as recently as 6,000 years ago. Therefore, species such as &quot;Dendrobates tinctorius&quot;, &quot;Oophaga pumilio&quot;, and &quot;Oophaga granulifera&quot; can include color pattern morphs that can be interbred (colors are under polygenic control, while the actual patterns are probably controlled by a single locus). Differing coloration has historically misidentified single species as separate, and there is still controversy among taxonomists over classification.

Variation in predation regimens may have influenced the evolution of polymorphism in &quot;Oophaga granulifera&quot;, while sexual selection appears to have contributed to differentiation among the Bocas del Toro populations of &quot;Oophaga pumilio&quot;.

== Toxicity and medicine ==
The chemical defense mechanisms of the Dendrobates family are the result of exogenous means. Essentially, this means that their ability to defend has come through the consumption of a particular diet – in this case, toxic arthropods – from which they absorb and reuse the consumed toxins. The secretion of these chemicals is released by the granular glands of the frog. The chemicals secreted by the Dendrobatid family of frogs are alkaloids that differ in chemical structure and toxicity. 

Many poison dart frogs secrete lipophilic alkaloid toxins such as allopumiliotoxin 267A, batrachotoxin, epibatidine, histrionicotoxin, and pumiliotoxin 251D through their skin. Alkaloids in the skin glands of poison dart frogs serve as a chemical defense against predation, and they are therefore able to be active alongside potential predators during the day. About 28 structural classes of alkaloids are known in poison dart frogs. The most toxic of poison dart frog species is &quot;Phyllobates terribilis&quot;. It is believed that dart frogs do not synthesize their poisons, but sequester the chemicals from arthropod prey items, such as ants, centipedes and mites – the diet-toxicity hypothesis. Because of this, captive-bred animals do not possess significant levels of toxins as they are reared on diets that do not contain the alkaloids sequestered by wild populations. Nonetheless, the captive-bred frogs retain the ability to accumulate alkaloids when they are once again provided an alkaloidal diet. Despite the toxins used by some poison dart frogs, some predators have developed the ability to withstand them. One is the snake &quot;Erythrolamprus epinephalus&quot;, which has developed immunity to the poison.

Chemicals extracted from the skin of &quot;Epipedobates tricolor&quot; may have medicinal value. Scientists use this poison to make a painkiller. One such chemical is a painkiller 200 times as potent as morphine, called epibatidine; however, the therapeutic dose is very close to the fatal dose. A derivative, ABT-594, developed by Abbott Laboratories, was named as Tebanicline and got as far as Phase II trials in humans, but was dropped from further development due to dangerous gastrointestinal side effects. Secretions from dendrobatids are also showing promise as muscle relaxants, heart stimulants and appetite suppressants. The most poisonous of these frogs, the golden poison frog (&quot;Phyllobates terribilis&quot;), has enough toxin on average to kill ten to twenty men or about twenty thousand mice. Most other dendrobatids, while colorful and toxic enough to discourage predation, pose far less risk to humans or other large animals.

=== Conspicuousness ===
Conspicuous coloration in these frogs is further associated with diet specialization, body mass, aerobic capacity, and chemical defense. Conspicuousness and toxicity may be inversely related, as polymorphic poison dart frogs that are less conspicuous are more toxic than the brightest and most conspicuous species. Energetic costs of producing toxins and bright color pigments lead to potential trade-offs between toxicity and bright coloration, and prey with strong secondary defenses have less to gain from costly signaling. Therefore, prey populations that are more toxic are predicted to manifest less bright signals, opposing the classical view that increased conspicuousness always evolves with increased toxicity.

=== Aposematism ===
Skin toxicity evolved alongside bright coloration, perhaps preceding it. Toxicity may have relied on a shift in diet to alkaloid-rich arthropods, which likely occurred at least four times among the dendrobatids. Either aposematism and aerobic capacity preceded greater resource gathering, making it easier for frogs to go out and gather the ants and mites required for diet specialization, contrary to classical aposematic theory, which assumes that toxicity from diet arises before signaling. Alternatively, diet specialization preceded higher aerobic capacity, and aposematism evolved to allow dendrobatids to gather resources without predation. Prey mobility could also explain the initial development of aposematic signaling. If prey have characteristics that make them more exposed to predators, such as when some dendrobatids shifted from nocturnal to diurnal behavior, then they have more reason to develop aposematism. After the switch, the frogs had greater ecological opportunities, causing dietary specialization to arise. Thus, aposematism is not merely a signaling system, but a way for organisms to gain greater access to resources and increase their reproductive success.

=== Other factors ===
Dietary conservatism (long-term neophobia) in predators could facilitate the evolution of warning coloration, if predators avoid novel morphs for a long enough period of time. Another possibility is genetic drift, the so-called gradual-change hypothesis, which could strengthen weak pre-existing aposematism.

Sexual selection may have played a role in the diversification of skin color and pattern in poison frogs. With female preferences in play, male coloration could evolve rapidly. Sexual selection is influenced by many things. The parental investment may shed some light on the evolution of coloration in relation to female choice. In &quot;Oophaga pumilio&quot;, the female provides care for the offspring for several weeks whereas the males provides care for a few days, implying a strong female preference. Sexual selection increases phenotypic variation drastically. In populations of &quot;O. pumilio&quot; that participated in sexual selection, the phenotypic polymorphism was evident. The lack of sexual dimorphism in some dendrobatid populations however suggests that sexual selection is not a valid explanation.

Functional trade-offs are seen in poison frog defense mechanisms relating to toxin resistance. Poison dart frogs containing epibatidine have undergone a 3 amino acid mutation on receptors of the body, allowing the frog to be resistant to its own poison. Epibatidine-producing frogs have evolved poison resistance of body receptors independently three times. This target-site insensitivity to the potent toxin epibatidine on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors provides a toxin resistance while reducing the affinity of acetylcholine binding.

== Diet ==
The diet of Dendrobatidae is what gives them the alkaloids/toxins that are found in their skin. The diet that is responsible for these characteristics consists primarily of small and leaf-litter arthropods found in its general habitat, typically ants. Their diet, however, is typically separated into two distinct categories. The first is the primary portion of Dendrobatidae&#x27;s diet which include prey that are slow-moving, large in number, and small in size. This typically consists of ants, while also including mites, small beetles, and minor litter-dwelling taxa. The second category of prey are much rarer finds and are much larger in body size, and they tend to have high palatability and mobility. These typically consist of the orthopteroids, lepidopteran larvae, and spiders. The natural diet of an individual dendrobatid depends on its species and prey abundance in its location, amongst other factors. 

== Behavior ==

=== Aggressive behavior and territoriality ===
The Dendrobatidae are a family of species very well known for their territorial and aggressive behavior not only as tadpoles, but as adults too. These aggression behaviors are not only limited to males, as many female Dendrobatidae also are known to defend their own native territory very aggressively. Dendrobatidae are especially aggressive in defending regions that serve as male calling sites. Males wrestle with intruders of their territory in order to defend their calling sites as well as their vegetation. While vocalization and various behavioral displays serve as a way of exhibiting one&#x27;s strength or fitness, territorial disputes and fights often escalate to physical combat and aggression. Physical violence and aggression are particularly common at times of calling. If it an intruder is detected making calls in the territory of a Dendrobatidae frog, the resident frog attempts to eliminate the competition to claim the territory and the females in it for himself. The resident frog initially makes its presence known by the means of vocalization and various behavioral displays as a way to exert dominance, but if this does not scare away the intruder, then the resident frog moves towards the intruder and strikes them. These encounters immediately escalate into a full on fight where both strike each other and grasp each other&#x27;s limbs. Similarly, the females also often get into fights and display aggressive behaviors in disputes over territory or a mating conflict. It has also been observed that females who are going after the same male, after hearing their call, chase each other down and wrestle to fight for the male. After a female courts with a male, they are also very likely to exhibit aggressive behavior towards any females that approach that male. Both the males and females bout their own respective sexes for each other in a fairly similar fashion.

=== Reproduction ===
Many species of poison dart frogs are dedicated parents. Many poison dart frogs in the genera &quot;Oophaga&quot; and &quot;Ranitomeya&quot; carry their newly hatched tadpoles into the canopy; the tadpoles stick to the mucus on the backs of their parents. Once in the upper reaches of the rainforest trees, the parents deposit their young in the pools of water that accumulate in epiphytic plants, such as bromeliads. The tadpoles feed on invertebrates in their nursery, and their mother will even supplement their diet by depositing eggs into the water. Other poison frogs lay their eggs on the forest floor, hidden beneath the leaf litter. Poison frogs fertilize their eggs externally; the female lays a cluster of eggs and a male fertilizes them afterward, in the same manner as most fish. Poison frogs can often be observed clutching each other, similar to the manner most frogs copulate. However, these demonstrations are actually territorial wrestling matches. Both males and females frequently engage in disputes over territory. A male will fight for the most prominent roosts from which to broadcast his mating call; females fight over desirable nests, and even invade the nests of other females to devour competitor&#x27;s eggs.

The operational sex ratio in the poison dart frog family is mostly female biased. This leads to a few characteristic behaviors and traits found in organisms with an uneven sex ratio. In general, females have a choice of mate. In turn, males show brighter coloration, are territorial, and are aggressive toward other males. Females select mates based on coloration (mainly dorsal), calling perch location, and territory.

==== Mating behavior ====
Observations of the Dendrobatidae family suggest that males of the species typically make their mating call in morning between the times of 6:30 am to 11:30 am. The males are usually on average one meter above the ground on limbs, trunks, and stems, or logs of trees so that their call travels further and so they can be seen by potential mates. The calls are signaled towards the stream where females are located. After the call is received, the female makes its way to the male and fertilization occurs. This observed fertilization is not accomplished through amplexus. Upon meeting, courtship is generally initiated by the female. The female strokes, climbs, and jumps on the male in tactile courtship and are by far the more active sex. The duration of courtship in poison frogs is long and females may occasionally reject males, even after an entire day of active pursuit. In the majority of cases, the males choose the oviposition site and lead the females there. In some Dendrobatidae species, such as strawberry poison frog, visual cues under high light intensity are also used to identify individuals from the same population. Different species use different cues to identify individuals from their same population during mating and courtship.

==== Post-mating behavior ====
Typically in many species the larger portion of parental investment falls on the shoulders of the female sex, whereas the male sex has a much smaller portion. However, it has been studied that in the family of Dendrobatidae, many of the species exhibit sex role reversal in which the females are competing for a limited number of males and the males are the choosers and their parental investment is much larger than the females. This theory also says that the female will typically produce eggs at an exceedingly fast rate that the males cannot possibly take full care of them which then leads to some of the males becoming unreceptive. Dendrobatidae also exhibit the parental quality hypothesis. This is where the females mating with the males try to ensure that their male mates with as few individuals as possible so that their number of offspring is limited, and thus each individual offspring receives a larger portion of care, attention, and resources. However, this creates an interesting dynamic of balance as there is a limited number of males available, and with many females competing for a limited number of males for courtship this makes it difficult to limit the number of individuals a male mates with. Whereas in many species, the competition is flipped in that the competition is prominent among the males, among the Dendrobatidae it is the opposite as the females seem to have a great deal of competition among themselves for males. Females will even take the drastic measures and resort to the destroying of other female&#x27;s eggs in order to make sure that the male they mated with is receptive and that it scares the male from mating with other females.

==== Behavior as tadpoles ====
The poison dart frog is known for its aggressive and predatory behavior. As tadpoles, the individuals of the genus &quot;Dendrobates&quot; exhibit some unique cannibalistic tendencies, along with many other forms of predatory behavior. &quot;Dendrobates&quot; tadpoles that either consumed three or more conspecific tadpoles and/or relatively large larvae of the mosquito &quot;Trichoprosopon digitatum&quot; common in their environment led them to having a much higher growth rate and typically lived much longer lives. Reasons for this behavior could be that predation and aggression was selected for and favored for a few reasons. One reason is to eliminate predators, and the second reason is that it serves as a source of food in habitats that were low in resources. This predation could have evolved over time and led to cannibalism as another form of predatory behavior that had benefitted individuals survival fitness. However, one observation has been noted in the general characteristic of &quot;Dendrobates&quot; tadpoles including &quot;D. arboreus&quot;, &quot;D. granuliferus&quot;, &quot;D. lehmanni&quot;, &quot;D. occultator&quot;, &quot;D. pumilio&quot;, &quot;D. speciosus&quot;, and many other &quot;Dendrobates&quot; species is that they have reduced mouth parts as young tadpoles which limits their consumption typically to unfertilized eggs only. Thus, it can be assumed that the cannibalistic tendencies of &quot;Dendrobates&quot; is limited to their lifetime as a tadpole and does not cross over into their adult life.

== Captive care ==

All species of poison dart frogs are Neotropical in origin. Wild-caught specimens can maintain toxicity for some time (which they obtain through a form of bioaccumulation), so appropriate care should be taken when handling them. While scientific study on the lifespan of poison dart frogs is scant, retagging frequencies indicate it can range from one to three years in the wild. However, these frogs typically live for much longer in captivity, having been reported to live as long as 25 years. These claims also seem to be questionable, since many of the larger species take a year or more to mature, and &quot;Phyllobates&quot; species can take more than two years.

In captivity, most species thrive where the humidity is kept constant at 80 to 100% and where the temperature is around to during the day and no lower than to at night. Some species tolerate lower temperatures better than others.

== Conservation status ==

Many species of poison dart frogs have recently experienced habitat loss, chytrid diseases, and collection for the pet trade. Some are listed as threatened or endangered as a result. Zoos have tried to counteract this disease by treating captive frogs with an antifungal agent that is used to cure athlete&#x27;s foot in humans.

== Threats ==
=== Parasites ===
Poison dart frogs suffer from parasites ranging from helminths to protozoans.

=== Diseases ===
Poison dart frogs suffer from chytridiomycosis, which is a deadly disease that is caused by the fungus &quot;Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis&quot; (Bd). This infection has been found in frogs from &quot;Colostethus&quot; and &quot;Dendrobates&quot;.

<text>Virgin Snow is the ninth Cantonese-language studio album by Hong Kong singer Leslie Cheung. It was released by Cinepoly Records on 5 February 1988. The album is the second album that Cheung released after he joined Cinepoly Records in Hong Kong.

== Background and development ==
Cheung composed the song &quot;Missing You&quot; and performed it in his Final Encounter of the Legend concert series of 1989. &quot;Hot&quot; was performed by Cheung in his World Tour 97 concert series, with Shu Qi acting as the Hot girl in the song of the dance track. &quot;Run to the Future Days&quot; is the theme song of the film &quot;A Better Tomorrow II&quot;. 

&quot;Love in the Snow&quot; is also part of the compilation in Cheung&#x27;s 1989&#x27;s album &quot;Salute&quot;, which is a dedication album by the singer to his fellow composers, singers and lyricists whom he has held in high esteem up to that time in his career.

== Songs ==
Popular songs from &quot;Virgin Snow&quot; include &quot;Love Killer (爱的凶手)&quot;, &quot;Hot (热辣辣)&quot; (which is a Cantopop version of the song &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;), &quot;Love in the Snow (雪中情)&quot;, &quot;Missing You (想你)&quot;, &quot;Burning My Eyes (烧毁我眼睛)&quot;, &quot;You Are the Half of Me (你是我一半)&quot; and &quot;Most Beloved (最爱)&quot;.

<text>IBM Aptiva is a line of personal computers that was produced by IBM. It was designed primarily for home use and offered a range of models with varying specifications and features. It was introduced in September 1994 as the replacement for the IBM PS/1.

The first Aptiva models were based on the Intel 80486 CPU. Later models used the Pentium and AMD CPUs. All systems were developed in-house except for the later E series which was developed by Acer.

Aptiva computers were typically sold as a bundle which included monitor, speakers, keyboard and mouse. First-generation models came with IBM PC DOS 6.3 and Windows 3.1. Pentium-generation Aptivas came with Windows 95 and OS/2 &#x27;select-a-system&#x27; (PC DOS 7/Windows 3.1 and OS/2 Warp) on selected models. Most Aptiva models included a modem and a standby/hibernation feature called &quot;Rapid Resume&quot;.

Sound and modem functionality was provided on M, A, C and S models by an IBM Mwave adapter. The Mwave adaptor had multiple compatibility and performance issues and was eventually replaced by standard modems and sound cards. IBM settled a lawsuit for Mwave owners by refunding Aptiva Mwave owners a small monetary fee so that those owners could purchase industry standard devices.

The last Aptiva system was withdrawn from sale in May 2001 without a direct replacement when IBM decided to exit the home market. Customers were directed to the IBM NetVista, which was more targeted to business desktops.

==Market history==
Among other things, IBM&#x27;s development and marketing of Lotus SmartSuite and OS/2 placed it in direct competition with Microsoft Office and Microsoft Windows, respectively. As a result, Microsoft &quot;punished the IBM PC Company with higher prices, a late license for Windows 95, and the withholding of technical and marketing support.&quot;

IBM was not granted OEM rights for Windows 95 until 15 minutes prior to the release of Windows 95, on August 24, 1995. Because of this uncertainty, IBM machines were sold without Windows 95, while Compaq, HP, and other companies sold machines with Windows 95 from day one.

The Aptiva never managed to recapture IBM&#x27;s early 1980s PC dominance from Compaq, Dell, or HP. IBM&#x27;s PC Group had higher costs than its competitors which made it impossible to match them on prices. Throughout the 1990s, IBM lost the most market share in PCs during that decade compared to its rivals, and only the ThinkPad laptop remained a stronghold. Most desktop and laptop sales were with longstanding corporate customers that already used IBM mainframe computers. Despite IBM&#x27;s continued decline in hardware, that was more than offset by the company shifting focus to the more lucrative e-business (integrated e-commerce and Internet technology solutions).

== Models ==

The series to which a Pentium-based Aptiva belongs is encoded in the first letter of the three-character model number (so a 2168-M40 is an M Series). The word in quotes relates to the internal development name for the computer.

* A Series Followed the M series Aptiva. Also used Mwave adaptor and Windows 95.
* C Series &quot;Courageous&quot; There were two model types and followed A series Aptiva.
* E Series &quot;Entry&quot; Low-end models developed by Acer alongside the ThinkPad i Series. 
* L Series
* M Series &quot;Magic&quot; First Aptiva series preloaded with Windows 95. Also used Mwave adaptor
* S Series &quot;Stealth&quot; This model appeared during the C series introduction and used Mwave also.

Aptiva machine types:
* 2136, 2137, 2138, 2139
* 2140, 2142, 2144
* 2151-89E, 2151-90E, 2153, 2156, 2158, 2159
* 2161, 2162, 2163, 2164, 2168, 
* 2170 (AMD K6-2), 2171, 2172, 2173, 2174, 2176, 2178
* 2193, 2194, 2196, 2197, 2198
* 2255
* 2270, 2274
* 6832
* 6864

The first generation of Aptivas used the 2144 desktop and 2168 tower unit form factors. 
The 2159 &quot;stealth&quot; series was a unique all black design that had the monitor resting on a metal stand with a &#x27;console&#x27; located underneath which contained the floppy and CD drive. The console connected to the main unit via a 6-foot cable. Later in the production life, all Aptivas used tower unit form factors. Originally the 2144 and 2168 machine types referred to the amount of open slots and drive bays. Later machine type numbers did not have the same nomenclature.

== User groups ==
Various Aptiva user and fan groups emerged. One of the most notable and tenured was run by Don Schneider, &quot;DON5408&#x27;s Unofficial Aptiva Support Site&quot;, now available on aptivasupport.com. The site had much information on topics such as how to open the computer case, drivers and upgrade tips. The site included a user chat group on Friday nights for users to help each other with PC issues. The site was removed when AOL discontinued its web hosting services, but some pages still remain on ptd.net. The site ran from 4/4/1997 to 10/31/2008, bringing in just under a million views on the home page.

<doc id="812228" wikidata="Q13168" url="?curid=812228" title="Textpattern">
<text>Textpattern is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) for PHP and MySQL. It was originally developed by Dean Allen and now developed by Team Textpattern. While it is typically listed among weblogging tools, its aim is to be a general-purpose content management system. The current stable version is Textpattern .

==History==

Textpattern grew out of the system used to publish Textism, Allen&#x27;s personal site, and an unnamed version was announced as available to alpha testers in 2001. In 2003, Textpattern was formally announced. The early alpha versions were followed by a series of beta releases which saw more widespread use, and which were themselves superseded by a series of &quot;gamma&quot; releases which expanded and refined Textpattern&#x27;s capabilities. Since the final gamma version (1.19), Textpattern has been distributed under the GNU General Public License.

The next version, in September 2004, was Release Candidate 1 for Textpattern 1.0. In a somewhat unorthodox move, Textpattern continued to accumulate features as the second, third, fourth and fifth release candidates were made public. During this time the official development team expanded to include several contributors from the Textpattern community: with Release Candidate 3 Alex Shiels and Pedro Palazón joined the development team, and Sencer Yurdagül was brought into the fold as Textpattern&#x27;s release manager with Release Candidate 4.

Due to a development process that extended much longer than originally envisioned, the first stable release of Textpattern was version 4.0 on August 14, 2005.

==Release history==

The 4.2.0 release (), which was the next major release following 4.0.8, in September 2009 was a major update. The most notable new features were administrative-side enhancements and hooks for creating administrative plugins and themes.

The 4.3.0 release () in November 2010 introduced new features and improvements, notably more advanced image handling, and administrative updates in preparation for modernising and streamlining the core code.

The 4.5.0 release () in August 2012 brought many improvements, including a new HTML5 public theme and extensive modernisation of the administration area of the system.

The 4.6.0 release () in September 2016 is one of the most significant releases to-date. Two years in the making, the update from v4.5.7 to v4.6.0 saw almost as many new commits to the code base as there had been in the entire previous project. The result was modernized code, an improved parser, and many new features.

The 4.7.0 release () in May 2018 added support for themes, which had been one of the noted deficiencies of the platform compared to other software. This release was dedicated in honor of creator Dean Allen who died in January 2018.

The 4.8.0 release () in February 2020 contained over 800 changes to Textpattern&#x27;s code to add new functionality, enhance existing features, resolve some issues from previous Textpattern releases and lay more foundations for extending the capabilities of Textpattern in future.

==Developers==

All of the original developers have departed the project: Allen and Palazón in 2006, Shiels in 2007, and Yurdagül in 2009. As of March 2022, the current developers are Stef Dawson, Phil Wareham, Pete Cooper, and Oleg Loukianov.

==Features==

Textpattern offers a number of features and conveniences to designers, users, site administrators and developers, including:
* Ease of publishing using Textile, a text-to-HTML converter which permits users to publish content without learning HTML.
* Preview of both the final &quot;look&quot; of content and of its HTML.
* Theme templates that permit both live and in-development layouts to operate side-by-side using the same live data. Development templates can be previewed and made live instantly without need for a staging environment.
* A tag-based template system which allows the creation of reusable blocks of content and code, referred to as &quot;forms&quot;, and a built-in &quot;tag builder&quot; to automate their creation.
* Tags can be used as values of other tags&#x27; attributes (&quot;tags in tags&quot;).
* Tags can be used to set up variables in order to verify whether certain conditions are met.
* A privilege-based user hierarchy, allowing for an organized structure of writers, editors and publishers to aid collaboration and content publishing workflows.
* A commenting system, including measures to combat spam.
* Syndication of site content via RSS and Atom.
* A robust plugin architecture which allows the addition of features to any part of the system, including the administrative backend.
* An integrated link management system.
* An integrated image management system which allows the association of images with particular pieces of content.
* An integrated file management system which allows files to be offered for download.
* Separation of content from presentation with a concept of &quot;sections&quot; defined for presentation and &quot;categories&quot; for content organization.
* An arbitrary number of custom data fields per article.
* UTF-8 publishing and support for many languages, including English, French, Italian, German, Czech, Japanese, Estonian, Latvian, Dutch, Norwegian, Danish, Portuguese, Catalan, Polish, Slovenian, Indonesian, Swedish, Icelandic, Russian, Arabic, Persian, and Greek (including support for polytonic).

<doc id="812231" wikidata="Q709373" url="?curid=812231" title="Morgan Earp">
<text>Morgan Seth Earp (April 24, 1851 – March 18, 1882) was an American sheriff and lawman. He served as Tombstone, Arizona&#x27;s Special Policeman when he helped his brothers Virgil and Wyatt, as well as Doc Holliday, confront the outlaw Cochise County Cowboys in the gunfight at the O.K. Corral on October 26, 1881. All three Earp brothers had been the target of repeated death threats made by the Cowboys who were upset by the Earps&#x27; interference in their illegal activities. The lawmen killed Cowboys Tom and Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton. All four lawmen were charged with murder by Billy&#x27;s older brother, Ike Clanton, who had run from the gunfight. During a month-long preliminary hearing, Judge Wells Spicer exonerated the men, concluding they had been performing their duty.

Friends of the slain outlaws retaliated, and on December 29, Cowboys ambushed Virgil, leaving him maimed. Two and a half months later, on March 18, 1882, they ambushed Morgan, shooting him at night through the window of a door while he was playing billiards and killed him. The Cowboys suspected in both shootings were let off on technicalities or lack of evidence. Wyatt Earp felt he could not rely on the criminal justice system and decided to take matters into his own hands. He concluded the only way to get justice for his murdered brother was to avenge his death. Wyatt assembled a that included their brother Warren Earp and set out on a vendetta to kill those they felt were responsible.

Morgan married Louisa Alice Houston sometime in the 1870s. They lived in Montana before joining his brothers in Tombstone. Louisa was staying with his parents in California when Morgan was murdered.

== Early life ==
Morgan Earp was born in Pella, Iowa, to Nicholas Porter Earp (1813–1907), a cooper and farmer, and his second wife Virginia Ann Cooksey (1821–1893).

=== Brothers&#x27; Service in Civil War and Later ===

When elder brothers Newton, James, and Virgil went off to the American Civil War, they left their young teenage brothers Wyatt and Morgan to tend the family farm. James and Morgan grew up close, with a shared wish for adventure and a dislike of farming. Before adulthood, teen-aged Morgan followed James Earp to Montana for a couple of years. Later he was with Wyatt on the Western frontier.

In spring 1868, his father Nicholas Porter Earp and his siblings Ginnie, Warren, and Adelia returned to the mid-west and Lamar, Missouri, where Nick became the local constable. By November 17, 1869, Nick resigned to become Justice of the Peace. Wyatt, who had followed them to Missouri, was appointed constable in place of his father. In early 1870, Wyatt married Urilla Sutherland, but she died later that year shortly before she was due to have a baby. Shortly afterward, Wyatt, James, Virgil, and Morgan got into what witnesses described as a &quot;20-minute street fight&quot; with Urilla&#x27;s brothers and other relatives over the alleged bootlegging activities of both families.

Sometime between 1871 and 1877, Morgan met Louisa Alice Houston, the daughter of H. Samuel Houston and Elizabeth Waughtal. Louisa (born January 24, 1855) was the second eldest of 12 children.

In 1875, Morgan left Wichita, Kansas and became a deputy marshal under Charlie Bassett at Dodge City.

=== Move to Butte, Montana ===

In late 1877, Morgan and Louisa moved to Miles City, Montana, where they bought a home. Shortly after Wyatt and Virgil headed for Tombstone, Arizona, Morgan and Louisa sold their home in Montana and headed west. Morgan apparently didn&#x27;t think the wild mining town of Tombstone was suitable for Louisa, who was a petite woman and suffered from rheumatoid arthritis. He took her instead to stay with his parents in Colton, California, in March 1880. Morgan set out to meet his older brothers in Tombstone on July 20, 1880. Louisa followed him in early December.

In 1878, the July 25 &quot;Daily Pioneer&quot; reported that Morgan had joined prospectors pursuing gold in the Bear Paw mountains on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation in northern Montana Territory, &quot;Mr. Morgan Earpt arrived last evening from the Tongue River, which he left about three weeks ago.&quot; General John Gibbon had brought troops to the Teton River to keep prospectors from being &quot;slaughtered by Indians.&quot; Morgan remained in Montana for an unknown amount of time. On December 16, 1879, he was selected as a policeman in Butte, Montana. A story has circulated that Morgan and Billy Brooks competed for the job of a policeman. During a confrontation over the job, they got in a gunfight. Some accounts say Earp killed Brooks, and that Earp was wounded. But other accounts report that Brooks later died at the hands of a lynch mob, but no contemporary documentation of the shootout has been found. Morgan served for only three months, until March 10, 1880.

=== Arrival in Tombstone, Arizona Territory ===

Morgan&#x27;s wife, Lou, wrote a letter to her sister Agnes on March 5, 1880: &quot;We arrived in San Bernardino on Wednesday evening, and Thursday we came by train to the Temescal Mountains Warm Springs.… I suppose I will have to live here now for some time, for there is no way to make enough money to get away.&quot; Morgan is listed in the June 1880 census for Temescal. In a July 19, 1880, letter, Lou wrote, &quot;My husband starts for Arizona in the morning.&quot;

At different times in Arizona, both Wyatt and Morgan worked as shotgun messengers for Wells Fargo &amp; Co., deputy sheriffs for Pima County, and as deputies under Tombstone&#x27;s town Marshal, Virgil Earp, their older brother. During December 1881, Wyatt was appointed by U.S. Marshal Crawley Dake as deputy U.S. marshal after Virgil was wounded. Wyatt appointed his brother Morgan as a deputy.

== Gunfight at the OK Corral ==
On Wednesday, October 26, 1881, the tension between the Earps and the Cowboys came to a head. Ike Clanton, Billy Claiborne, and other Cowboys had been threatening to kill the Earps for several weeks. Tombstone town Marshal Virgil Earp learned that the Cowboys were armed in violation of a city ordinance and had gathered near the O.K. Corral. Morgan was a deputy to his brother Virgil and on October 26, 1881, responded with Virgil and Wyatt to reports that Cowboys were armed on the streets of Tombstone. Ike Clanton had repeatedly threatened the Earps and he was backed up by Cowboys Tom McLaury, Frank McLaury, and Billy Clanton. Virgil asked Wyatt and Morgan and Doc Holliday to assist him, as he intended to disarm them. At approximately 3:00 p.m. the Earps headed towards Fremont Street where the Cowboys had been reported to be gathering.

They confronted five Cowboys on Fremont Street in an alley between the Harwood House and Fly&#x27;s Boarding House and Photography Studio, the two parties were initially only about apart. Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne fled the gunfight. Tom and Frank McLaury, along with Billy Clanton, were killed. Morgan was clipped by a shot across his back that nicked both shoulder blades and a vertebra, although he was able to continue firing his weapon. Virgil was shot through the calf and Holliday was grazed by a bullet.

== Assassination ==
The Earp brothers moved into the Cosmopolitan Hotel for safety and hired several men to help protect the family. Two months after the gunfight at the O.K. Corral, in December 1881, Virgil Earp was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt that left him with a permanently crippled left arm. By February 1882, Morgan grew wary of the danger to the Earps in Tombstone and sent Louisa to live with his parents in Colton, California. Morgan remained in Tombstone to support his brothers.

=== Ambush and murder ===

At 10:50 p.m. on Saturday, March 18, 1882, after returning from a musical at Schieffelin Hall, Morgan was ambushed. He was playing a late round of billiards at the Campbell &amp; Hatch Billiard Parlor against owner Bob Hatch. Dan Tipton, Sherman McMaster, and Wyatt watched, having received threats that same day.

The assailant shot Morgan through the upper half of a four-pane windowed door. The bottom two windows had been painted over. The door opened onto a dark alley that ran through the block between Allen and Fremont Streets. Morgan, about from the door, was struck by a bullet in the back which injured his spine then exited his front and entered the thigh of mining foreman George A. B. Berry. Another bullet lodged in the wall near the ceiling over Wyatt&#x27;s head. Several men rushed into the alley but found the shooter had fled.

After Morgan was shot, his brothers tried to help him stand, but Morgan said &quot;Don&#x27;t, I can&#x27;t stand it. This is the last game of pool I&#x27;ll ever play.&quot; They moved him to the floor near the card room door. Dr. William Miller arrived first, followed by Drs. Matthews and George Goodfellow. They all examined Morgan. Goodfellow, who would earn recognition in the United States as the nation&#x27;s leading expert at treating abdominal gunshot wounds, concluded that Morgan&#x27;s wounds were fatal.

Goodfellow described Morgan&#x27;s wounds:

In the book &quot;Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal&quot;, author Stuart Lake wrote that Wyatt said that Morgan, before dying, whispered to Wyatt, &quot;I can&#x27;t see a damned thing.&quot; Wyatt said that they had promised each other to report visions of the next world when at the point of death. They moved him to a lounge and Morgan&#x27;s family—Wyatt, Virgil, and James, along with Allie and Bessie—gathered around him. Morgan&#x27;s wife Louisa was in Colton with his parents, and Warren Earp was out of town. Morgan died less than an hour after he was shot.

=== Burial ===

After his death, Morgan was laid out in a blue suit belonging to Doc Holliday. The family held his funeral in the Cosmopolitan Hotel. Wyatt learned that Frank Stilwell and others were waiting for them in Tucson, and assembled several deputies who guarded Virgil, Maddie, Ally and James. The Earps took Morgan&#x27;s body by wagon the next day to Benson, where they hired a wagon to get to the New Mexico and Arizona railroad station in Contention. From Contention, they caught a train to Tucson. While waiting for the next train in Tucson, they saw Stilwell apparently lying in wait and killed him. From Tucson, James accompanied Virgil, Maddie, Ally and Morgan&#x27;s body to Colton, California where Morgan&#x27;s wife and parents were waiting. Morgan was first buried in the old city cemetery of Colton, near Mount Slover. When the cemetery was moved in 1892, Morgan&#x27;s body was reburied in the Hermosa Cemetery in Colton.

== Aftermath ==

While Wyatt was out of town, Coroner Dr. D.M. Mathew held an inquest into Morgan&#x27;s death. Pete Spence&#x27;s wife, Marietta Duarte, was ready to talk to the Coroner&#x27;s Jury. She had been abused by her husband and may have had motivation to implicate him. She implicated her husband and four other men in Morgan&#x27;s murder.

She testified that the day before, her husband and Indian Charlie were on the front porch, when they saw Morgan Earp walk by. She said Pete Spence told Indian Charlie; (Florentino Cruz) &quot;That&#x27;s him; that&#x27;s him,&quot; and the Indian walked ahead of Earp to get a good look at him. The night of the shooting, her husband was away. Around midnight, Cruz and Frank Stilwell showed up, armed with pistols and carbines, and her husband arrived soon after with Freis (Frederick Bode) and a fifth unidentified man (later identified as Hank Swilling), all carrying rifles. They talked in low and excited tones. The next morning, her husband struck both her and her mother, and threatened to shoot Marietta if she told what she knew. Witnesses said they saw Frank Stilwell running from the scene.

The Coroner&#x27;s jury concluded that Spence, Stilwell, Frederick Bode, and &quot;Indian Charlie&quot; were the prime suspects in Morgan Earp&#x27;s death.

When the prosecution called Marietta Duarte to testify at the preliminary hearing, the defense objected because her testimony was hearsay and because a spouse could not testify against her husband. The judge agreed and the charges were dismissed.

On May 27, 1882, a &quot;strong Democrat&quot; was quoted in a letter in the Yuma, Arizona newspaper &quot;The Arizona Sentinel&quot; describing the events following the &quot;murder of the noted desperado Frank Stilwell.&quot; Readers may want to know &quot;how these so-called Republican outlaws are regarded by decent, law-abiding people in Tombstone, regardless of politics.&quot; The writer was of the opinion that Cochise County Sheriff Behan wanted the warrant from Governor Fremont with the &quot;object was to have them assassinated... Neither the Sheriff nor any of his deputies have ever turned a hand to find the murderers&quot; of Morgan Earp. &quot;There is no hope for any honest man to get justice here against these scoundrels as long as Behan is in office.&quot;

=== Wyatt seeks personal justice ===

Wyatt Earp finally concluded that he could not rely on the court system for justice and decided to take matters into his own hands. He concluded that the only way to deal with Virgil&#x27;s shooters and Morgan&#x27;s murderers was to find and kill the Cowboys he believed were responsible. He gathered a band of loyal men and deputized them. They rode out to find those responsible.

=== Cowboys in jail ===

Unknown to Wyatt, three of the Cowboys he sought were in Behan&#x27;s jail. After the Coroner&#x27;s Jury ended, Spence immediately turned himself in, protected in Behan&#x27;s jail. On the day of the inquest, two of Behan&#x27;s deputy sheriffs arrested two of the suspects for other reasons. Cochise County Deputy Sheriff William Bell brought Indian Charlie from Charleston and placed him under arrest in the Tombstone jail for shooting a man in Charleston. Separately, Cochise County Deputy Sheriff Frank Hereford arrested &quot;John Doe&quot; Freeze. They were all later released.

While accompanying his brother Virgil to the rail head in Tucson, Wyatt spotted Frank Stilwell lying in wait. He was a suspect in Morgan&#x27;s assassination. Wyatt and others pursued Stilwell and killed him. Earp then assembled and deputized a federal posse. They set out to track down others they believed responsible for shooting Virgil and killing Morgan. During the Earp Vendetta Ride, the federal posse looked for Pete Spence but found he was already in jail. They killed Florentino &quot;Indian Charlie&quot; Cruz, who had been identified by Pete Spence&#x27;s wife as taking part in ambushing Virgil. They also accidentally came upon Curly Bill Brocius at a spring and Wyatt killed him with a single shotgun blast. Wyatt shot Johnny Barnes in the same gunfight and he died soon after.

=== Remaining suspects ===

Wyatt and his brothers were unable to apprehend or kill the other suspects in Morgan&#x27;s death.

<doc id="812240" wikidata="Q198908" url="?curid=812240" title="Card scraper">
<text>A card scraper or cabinet scraper is a woodworking shaping and finishing tool. It is used to manually remove small amounts of material and excels in tricky grain areas where hand planes would cause tear out. Card scrapers are most suitable for working with hardwoods, and can be used instead of sandpaper. Scraping produces a cleaner surface than sanding; it does not clog the pores of the wood with dust, and does not leave a fuzz of torn fibers.

== Types ==

Card scrapers are available in a range of shapes and sizes, the most common being a rectangular shape approximately and with a thickness of . Another common configuration is the &quot;gooseneck&quot; scraper, which has a shape resembling a french curve and is useful for scraping curved surfaces. For scraping convex shapes such as violin fingerboards, small flexible rectangular scrapers are useful.

Similarly, a card scraper can be used to manufacture complex mouldings by cutting the negative of the desired moulding into the steel, e.g. through filing or die cutting.
A scratch stock is a profiled card scraper that is held in an adjustable stop.

Scrapers are normally made from high carbon steel. There are many manufacturers who provide scrapers in a wide variety of styles. Many woodworkers prefer to make their own card scrapers by cutting them from old hand saw blades.

Card scrapers are sometimes used in working with ceramics, where they may substitute for the more traditional wooden rib. The scraper is also useful for trimming damp or dry clay. Such a scraper, the nearest one to the camera, is shown in the image at right.

==Turning the burr==
The cutting component of a card scraper is the burred edge of the scraper. The burr is a sharp hook of metal which is turned on the edge of the scraper by burnishing with a burnisher or steel rod. A file or sharpening stone is used to joint the edge of the scraper before burnishing. Cabinet makers typically joint the edge square, or at a right angle to the face of the scraper, which allows a fine burr to be turned on both sides. Luthiers often use a beveled edge, which allows a more aggressive burr, but on one side only.

There are a number of variations in the process of turning the burr, the choice of which is down to personal preference. However the basic concept is that the burnishing rod is held against the edge of the scraper at a slight angle and drawn along the edge a number of times until the burr is created. One variation involves holding the rod flat against the side of the scraper for the first few passes to create a burr pointing away from the edge and this is then rolled back down by drawing the rod along perpendicular to the scraper.

With the burr properly turned, a scraper will produce miniature shavings resembling those from a plane. If only dust is produced, either the scraper is not sharp, or not being used correctly.

==Use==
In use, the card scraper is grasped by the fingers, one hand on either side, and tilted in the direction of travel. The degree of tilt controls the effective angle of the cutting edge, which is the burr. Practice is required to find the correct angle. In addition to the tilt, the user will usually flex the scraper slightly by holding it at the edges with the fingers and pressing in the centre with the thumbs. The slight flex causes the corners of the scraper to lift slightly thus preventing them from marring the workpiece.

The scraper may be drawn towards the user or pushed away, although some woodworkers claim that pulling the scraper towards one can cause it to dip, resulting in an uneven surface.

The main drawback of a card scraper is that the usage is a difficult skill to master. It takes a bit of practice to turn the burr correctly and then the scraper must be presented to the work in the correct fashion. Also, due to the friction created in use, the card scraper can become hot enough to burn fingers.

Some woodworkers use the term &quot;cabinet scraper&quot; instead of &quot;card scraper&quot; for this tool. While this is widely accepted a separate tool also exists, called a cabinet scraper, which differs from the card scraper in that it has a beveled edge like a plane. Calling a card scraper a cabinet scraper could cause confusion between these tools.

A variation of the card scraper is the scraper plane which consists of a hand plane body in which a card scraper is mounted. There are also various styles of holder which can be used for this purpose. These simplify the use of the card scraper and alleviate the problems associated with heat.

Burnishing jigs and other accessories are available to assist in turning the burr, which makes the card scraper more accessible to the novice.

<text>All&#x27;s Well, Ends Well or abbreviated as AWEW () is a 1992 Hong Kong comedy film directed by Clifton Ko. The film stars Leslie Cheung, Stephen Chow, Raymond Wong, Maggie Cheung, Sandra Ng, and Teresa Mo.

&quot;All&#x27;s Well, Ends Well&quot; was a Lunar New Year film, where a film&#x27;s release was timed to coincide with the larger movie audience at that time of year. The movie is also one of Stephen Chow&#x27;s trademark &#x27;mo lei tau&#x27; films of little sense but much good-natured humour, and is still considered to be a cult classic by most Hong Kong audiences.

The film was followed by seven sequels:
*&quot;All&#x27;s Well, Ends Well Too&quot; (1993)
*&quot;All&#x27;s Well, Ends Well 1997&quot; (1997)
*&quot;All&#x27;s Well, Ends Well 2009&quot; (2009)
*&quot;All&#x27;s Well, Ends Well 2010&quot; (2010)
*&quot;All&#x27;s Well, Ends Well 2011&quot; (2011)
*&quot;All&#x27;s Well, Ends Well 2012&quot; (2012)
*&quot;&quot; (2020)

==Plot==
&quot;All&#x27;s Well, Ends Well&quot; is a comic romance of three hapless brothers who eventually learn, through their amorous exploits and misadventures, that love is only won through gradual nurturing, and quickly lost through the quick, dishonest, selfish ways which they have always taken for granted.

Moon (Raymond Wong) is the eldest brother and head of the family. The film begins on his 7th wedding anniversary with his devoted, but unattractive wife, Leng (Sandra Ng), a celebration which he deserts, instead preferring the company of his more attractive mistress, Sheila (Sheila Chan). He turns up at home with her later, forcing his wife (whom he calls &#x27;hag&#x27;) to leave the house in dismay. Leng finds work as a party entertainer in a karaoke bar where she improves her looks and her singing ability. The family household devolves into chaos following Leng&#x27;s departure and when Moon encounters her one night at the bar, he falls in love once again, which causes his relationship with Sheila to deteriorate. Moon attempts to reconcile with Leng on several occasions but is rebuffed repeatedly.

So (Leslie Cheung) is the effeminate middle brother, a floral arranger and lecturer at an art school, who is good at cooking and enjoys women&#x27;s hobbies. His second cousin Mo-seung (Teresa Mo), who possesses masculine traits, comes to the family home on the evening of the anniversary and entirely devours an elaborate gourmet banquet which So had intended as a gift for Leng on her otherwise disastrous celebration day. She works at the same school as So as an acupuncture massage teacher, whose methods leave many of her clients in physical pain. So and Mo-seung are constantly at odds over trivial issues, which intensifies after So forces Mo-seung out of her position at the school. Their pettiness is highlighted when they irreconcilably insult each other with vulgar metaphors during a mahjong game session. Sheila causes a power outage at the family residence, which So and Mo-seung attempt to fix together, but electrical shocks they receive in the kitchen cause them to temporarily fall in love with one another.

Foon (Stephen Chow) is the youngest brother and a local radio DJ who flirts shamelessly while on air and is well-known among his legion of female fans for his impressive kissing technique. A listener named Holli-yuk (Maggie Cheung) calls him on air one day and arranges a date with him. She is an avid Hollywood movie lover who enjoys re-enacting particular love-scenes from movies. She is convinced that Foon shares her romantic outlook and they soon become lovers. Foon, however, is a notorious playboy not eager to settle down. Predictably, Holli-yuk catches him in an act of infidelity. After a freak accident leaves Foon suffering from a mildly debilitating mental illness, Holli-yuk offers to become a nurse for him. Taking advantage of her role as his nurturer, she gleefully devises methods to punish him for his callous behaviour. Her efforts fail when her feelings for him repeatedly overpower her attempts at vengeance. They reconcile when she discovers a Styrofoam statue Foon makes in her name.

During a birthday party at the family home, Sheila leaves Moon due to her dissatisfaction with his yearning for Leng, coupled with her own apparent yearning for her previously selfish, concubine lifestyle. So and Mo-seung each invite their own love interests to the home for the party. However, So and Mo-seung are both dismayed and heartbroken to find that their love interests are looking to marry each other as opposed to them, which prompts them to break down crying together in So&#x27;s bedroom. Remembering the incident from the kitchen, they both shock themselves and form their own romantic relationship. Holli-yuk shows up at the party and is dismayed to see Foon partying heavily with other women, but he sustains another head injury and is brought to clarity upon seeing her. Holli-yuk storms out of the party, but she once again reconciles with Foon when he rides up to her in a motorcycle dawning a look resembling the Terminator. Leng reconciles with Moon when he sings a song for her at the karaoke bar with the rest of the family in attendance.

With their love lives now secured; the film ends with the family participating in a wedding ceremony with their respective lovers.

<text>Horsforth is a town and civil parish in the City of Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, five miles north-west of Leeds city centre. Historically a village within the West Riding of Yorkshire, it had a population of 18,895 at the 2011 Census. It became part of the City of Leeds metropolitan borough in 1974. In 1999, a civil parish was created for the area, and the parish council voted to rename itself a town council. The area is within the Horsforth ward of Leeds City Council, which also includes the southern part of Rawdon.

==History==
Horsforth was recorded in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 as &quot;Horseford&quot;, &quot;Horseforde&quot;, &quot;Hoseforde&quot;; but late-ninth-century coins with the legend &quot;ORSNA FORD&quot; and &quot;OHSNA FORD&quot; may have come from Horsforth. The name derives from Old English &quot;hors&quot; or, to judge from the coins, *&quot;horsa&quot; (&#x27;horse&#x27;) in the genitive plural form &quot;horsa&quot;/&quot;horsna&quot; + &quot;ford&quot; &#x27;ford&#x27;, thus meaning &#x27;horses&#x27; ford&#x27;. This refers to a river crossing on the River Aire (possibly at Newlay), that was subsequently used to transport woollen goods to and from Pudsey, Shipley and Bradford. The original ford was situated off Calverley Lane, but was replaced by a stone footbridge at the turn of the 19th century.

The three unnamed Saxon thegns who held the land at the Conquest gave way to the king who granted it to lesser Norman nobles, but not long after most of the village came under the control of Kirkstall Abbey, a Cistercian house founded in 1152 on the bank of the River Aire downstream of Horsforth.

After the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539, Horsforth was partitioned and sold to five families, one of them – the Stanhopes – achieved supremacy and controlled the village for the next 300 years. The estate record of the Stanhopes is regarded as one of the most extensive and important collections of its kind, complementing the extensive medieval record associated with Kirkstall Abbey.

Until the mid 19th century, Horsforth was an agricultural community but it expanded rapidly with the growth of the nearby industrial centre of Leeds. A tannery business was founded at Woodside in about 1820 by the Watson family. It was on the eastern edge of their small farm, and memorialised by &quot;Tanhouse Hill Lane&quot;. The business became a soap manufacturer and moved to Whitehall Road in Leeds in 1861 and under the chairmanship of Joseph Watson junior, created Baron Manton in 1922, as Joseph Watson &amp; Sons Ltd, became the largest soap supplier to the northeast of England, second in size nationally only to Lever Brothers. Industrially, Horsforth has a history of producing high-quality stone from its quarries. Not only did it supply Kirkstall Abbey with building materials and millstones in the medieval period, it provided the stone for Scarborough&#x27;s seafront and sent sandstone from Golden Bank Quarry as far afield as Egypt. Situated on Horsforth Beck (Oil Mill Beck) were mills serving the textile trade.

Between 1861 and 1862, there was an outbreak of typhoid.

Horsforth was historically a township in the parish of Guiseley. It became a separate civil parish in 1866. In the late-19th century it achieved note as the village with the largest population in England. Railways, turnpike roads, tramways and the nearby canal made it a focus for almost all forms of public and commercial transport and it became a dormitory suburb of Leeds. The civil parish became Horsforth Urban District in 1894. The parish and urban district were abolished in 1974 and merged into the new City of Leeds metropolitan district. In 1999 Horsforth became a civil parish and a parish council was created, which exercised its right to declare Horsforth a town.
Horsforth Village Museum has collections and displays illustrating aspects of life set against the backdrop of the changing role of the village.

During the Second World War the £241,000 required to build the corvette HMS &quot;Aubrietia&quot; was raised entirely by the people of Horsforth. In 2000 the US President Bill Clinton acknowledged Horsforth&#x27;s contribution to the war effort in a letter sent to MP Paul Truswell. The letter is in the museum. The Scout and Guide hut on New Road Side was requisitioned during the war as an emergency mortuary for the factories based around what is now Leeds Bradford Airport (Yeadon Aerodrome at the time), but it was never needed. The building was later used as a cafe, serving as a popular stop-off on the way out to Otley, Ilkley and the Dales, before being purchased by the scouts and guides.

In October 2020 Horsforth was named the most musical village in Britain as it was revealed that 22 home-grown acts were in the running for the charts with their latest singles.

==Transport==

===Rail===
Horsforth railway station is on the Harrogate line between Harrogate and Leeds. The station is just outside the Horsforth parish boundary, on the Cookridge side of Moseley Beck.

Kirkstall Forge railway station is located in Kirkstall near the boundary with Horsforth, around two miles from Horsforth station. It is on the Leeds to Bradford Line between Leeds City and Shipley and was opened on 19 June 2016, near the site of an earlier station with the same name.

Newlay station, which was built by the Midland Railway, was renamed &quot;Newlay &amp; Horsforth&quot; station in 1889. It was situated south of the River Aire and was accessible from Horsforth on Pollard Lane which connects Horsforth to Bramley. The station on the Airedale line was renamed Newlay station in 1961. It closed on 22 March 1965, along with other stations on the Airedale line: Armley Canal Road, Kirkstall, Calverley &amp; Rodley and Apperley Bridge.

==Education==

Leeds Trinity University, formerly Leeds Trinity University College, is an independent university after a period as an accredited college of the University of Leeds. The residential campus is located off Brownberrie Lane, Horsforth.

The further education college Leeds City College has a former site in Horsforth which was called the Horsforth Campus which has lain redundant since it closed in June 2017. Housing has now been built on the site. It was previously part of Park Lane College.

The main secondary school is Horsforth School. Horsforth&#x27;s state sector primary schools are West End Lane Primary School, St Margaret&#x27;s Primary School, Newlaithes Primary School, Westbrook Lane Primary School, Broadgate Lane Primary School, St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Primary School and Featherbank Primary School.

Featherbank School opened in 1911 as a primary school, replacing the Grove Day School. The school&#x27;s infant department was moved to the Grove Methodist Church on Stanhope Drive in 1933, but in 1960 transferred to the Featherbank School annexe. In 1972 Featherbank juniors (7–11 years) were allocated places at the newly built Newlaithes Junior School, at which point Featherbank became purely an infants&#x27; school (4–7 years). In September 2011 Featherbank reverted to being a full primary school.

There is a private primary school, The Froebelian School.

==Architecture==
Horsforth has a large percentage of sandstone buildings sourced from local quarries, more than any other part of Leeds. A draft design statement was produced in 2010, which summarises much of the architectural and historical character.

<text>Albert George Hill (24 March 1889 – 8 January 1969) was a British track and field athlete. He competed at the 1920 Olympics and won gold medals in the 800 m and 1500 m and a silver medal in the 3000 m team race.

== Biography ==
Hill started out as a long-distance runner, winning the British AAA championships over 4 miles at the 1910 AAA Championships.

During World War I he served with the Royal Flying Corps in France, and after the war changed to middle-distance running. Coached by Sam Mussabini (coach of 100 m Olympic Champions Reggie Walker and Harold Abrahams), he won the 880 yd national title and 1 mile national title at the 1919 AAA Championships and then equalled the British record of 4:16.8 for 1 mile. He nearly was not selected for the Olympics the following year, the selectors considering the 31-year-old Hill too old. Finally, he was allowed to take part at the Olympics, which were held in Antwerp, Belgium. He made the final in the 800m, which was a closely contested race. In the end, the 31-year-old Hill beat American Earl Eby for the gold, setting a British record of 1:53.4 on a slow track.

Two days later, Hill completed the middle distance double by winning the 1500 m as well, thus completing a &quot;double&quot; not replicated by a British athlete until Kelly Holmes at the 2004 Olympics. Helped by his compatriot, Philip Baker (who would receive the Nobel Peace Prize in 1959), he won comfortably, with Baker in second in a time of 4:01.8. Hill also competed in the 3000 m team race event, in which the British team finished second, earning Hill&#x27;s third Olympic medal.

Hill won the 1921 AAA mile championship in a British record of 4:13.8, at the 1921 AAA Championships, this was 1.2 seconds outside the world record and the second fastest amateur time ever.

Hill ended his running career in 1921 and became a coach himself, his most famous protégé being Sydney Wooderson. He emigrated to Canada shortly after World War II, and died there in 1969.

In 2010, he was inducted into the England Athletics Hall of Fame.

<text>Louis Cukela (May 1, 1888 – March 19, 1956) was a Croatian American United States Marine numbered among the nineteen two-time recipients of the Medal of Honor. Cukela was awarded the Medal by both the United States Army and the United States Navy for the same action during the Battle of Soissons in World War I. He was also awarded decorations from France, Italy, and Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

==Biography==
Vjekoslav Cukela was born on May 1, 1888, in the Dalmatian city of Split, today&#x27;s Croatia (at the time Kingdom of Dalmatia, Austro-Hungarian Empire). His family soon moved from Split to Šibenik. His parents were Đuro Cukela, from the village of Koljane near Vrlika, and Ivanica nee Bubrić from Kaštel Lukšić, and he was the oldest of four siblings, having three sisters. His mother died in 1900. He was educated in the grade schools of Split, then attended the Merchant Academy and later, the Royal Gymnasium, both for two year courses. Between 1907 and 1911 he served in the Austro-Hungarian Army.

In 1911, Cukela emigrated to the United States. He settled in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
On September 21, 1914, he enlisted in the United States Army. He was serving as a corporal in Company H, 13th Infantry Regiment in the Philippines. He was honorably discharged on June 12, 1916.

In a 1931 &quot;Politika&quot; interview with , Cukela said he had heard that his father back home had been imprisoned by the Austrian authorities at the start of World War I. Believing that the Marine Corps would be deployed to Europe sooner than the Army, he paid 175 dollars to be discharged so he could transfer.

===World War I===

Seven months after his discharge, on January 31, 1917, prior to the United States entry into World War I, Cukela enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. He became a member of the 66th Company, 1st Battalion, Fifth Marine Regiment.

He was deployed to France in 1918 and fought in all the engagements in which the 5th Marines participated, from Belleau Wood to the Meuse River Crossing. Along the way he earned a commission as a second lieutenant, as well as the Medal of Honor and four Silver Star citations. From the French, there was the Légion d&#x27;honneur, the Médaille militaire (the first award of this prestigious decoration to a Marine officer) and the Croix de guerre 1914–18 with two palms and one silver star. Italy decorated him with the Croce al Merito di Guerra, while Yugoslavia weighed in with the Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Royal Order of the Crown of Yugoslavia.

He was awarded the Medal of Honor by both the Army and the Navy (in the &quot;Tiffany Cross&quot; pattern) for the same action on the morning of July 18, 1918, near Villers-Cotterêts, France, during the Soissons engagement. The 66th Company, 5th Marines, in which Cukela was then a gunnery sergeant, was advancing through the Forest de Retz when it was held up by an enemy strong point. Despite the warnings of his men, the gunnery sergeant crawled out from the flank and advanced alone towards the German lines. Getting beyond the strong point despite heavy fire, &quot;Gunny&quot; Cukela captured one gun by bayoneting its crew. Picking up their hand grenades, he then demolished the remaining portion of the strong point from the shelter of a nearby gun pit. He took four prisoners and captured two undamaged machine guns.

Cukela was wounded in action twice but since there is no record of either wound at the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, he was never awarded the Purple Heart. The first wound was suffered at Jaulny, France, on September 16, 1918, during the St. Mihiel engagement. Cukela was wounded again during the fighting in the Champagne sector. Neither wound was serious.

In addition to the two Medals of Honor, Cukela was awarded the Silver Star by the Army; the Médaille militaire (he was the first Marine officer ever to receive this medal), the Legion of Honour in the rank of Chevalier, the Croix de guerre with two palms, another Croix de guerre with Silver Star, all by France; the Croce al Merito di Guerra by Italy; and Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Royal Order of the Crown of Yugoslavia. He also received three Second Division citations.

Cukela received a field appointment to the rank of second lieutenant in the Marine Corps Reserve on September 26, 1918, and was selected for a commission in the regular Marine Corps on March 31, 1919. Promoted to first lieutenant on July 17, 1919, he was advanced to the rank of captain on September 15, 1921. His promotion to major was effected on the day of his retirement, June 30, 1940.

===After World War I===

After the war, Cukela served at overseas bases in Haiti, Santo Domingo, the Philippines, and Tianjin, China, and at domestic stations in Quantico, Virginia; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Norfolk, Virginia; Hampton Roads, Virginia; Mare Island, California; Washington, D.C.; Nashville, Indiana, and Fort Knox, Kentucky.

Cukela served as a second lieutenant of United States Marine Corps stationed at Maissade, Republic of Haiti in the times of the Second Caco War of 1919–1920. By 1919, Haitian Charlemagne Péralte had organized more than a thousand armed guerrillas (called cacos), to militarily oppose the United States Marine occupation. The Marines responded to the resistance with a counterinsurgency campaign that razed villages, killed thousands of Haitians, and destroyed the livelihoods of even more. Cukela was one of the US military personnel questioned by a US Senate committee for the atrocities he committed and abuse of power. Cukela executed a group of prisoners in the middle of a Marine camp there. For this atrocity he was not court martialed rather transferred to another camp.

General Barnett, Marine Corps Commandant in 1920 set up a board headed by Colonel John H. Russell Jr. to decide which wartime temporary officers would be retired, demoted, or discharged. Educated men of good family were preferred over formerly enlisted men with little formal education. As a consequence of those criteria Cukela was demoted from first lieutenant to second lieutenant despite his wartime heroism. 

By 1927 Cukela was a captain of the 75th Company of Marines serving in Tianjin, China.

From June 1933 to January 1934, Cukela served as a company commander with the Civilian Conservation Corps. His last years in the Marine Corps were spent at Norfolk, where he served as the post quartermaster. Retired as a major on June 30, 1940, he was recalled to active duty on July 30, of the same year.

During World War II the major served at Norfolk and Philadelphia. 

===Retirement and death===
Cukela finally returned to the inactive retired list on May 17, 1946. Cukela served a few days less than 32 years of active duty in the army and Marines.

On March 19, 1956, he died at the U.S. Naval Hospital, Bethesda, Maryland. Following services at St. Jane Frances de Chantel Church, Bethesda, he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

==Legacy==

He was famous for his broken English, best exemplified by his unforgettable saying, &quot;If I want[ed] to send a goddamned fool, I&#x27;d go myself&quot; (when a messenger came back with a stupid garbled reply).

Cukela was profiled in the August 2018 issue of &quot;Naval History&quot; magazine.

===Medal of Honor citations===
Navy citation:
For extraordinary heroism while serving with the 66th Company, 5th Regiment, during action in Forest de Retz, near Viller-Cottertes, France, 18 July 1918. Sgt. Cukela advanced alone against an enemy strong point that was holding up his line. Disregarding the warnings of his comrades, he crawled out from the flank in the face of heavy fire and worked his way to the rear of the enemy position. Rushing a machine-gun emplacement, he killed or drove off the crew with his bayonet, bombed out the remaining part of the strong point with German hand grenades, and captured two machineguns and four men.

Army citation:

When his company, advancing through a wood, met with strong resistance from an enemy strong point, Sgt. Cukela crawled out from the flank and made his way toward the German lines in the face of heavy fire, disregarding the warnings of his comrades. He succeeded in getting behind the enemy position and rushed a machinegun emplacement, killing or driving off the crew with his bayonet. With German hand grenades he then bombed out the remaining portion of the strong point, capturing 4 men and 2 damaged machineguns.

==Personal life==

Cukela visited his childhood home of Šibenik in 1925, publicly displaying his many decorations. He also visited Yugoslavia in 1931 for a congress of expatriates that toured several major cities, and he was also granted an audience with King Alexander. In 1938, he learned of the Yugoslav training ship &quot;Jadran&quot; visiting Boston, so he went out there to greet them as well.

In 1952, a Yugoslav military delegation visited the United States, and a colonel who was a cousin of Cukela&#x27;s visited him in his home in Bethesda, where Major Cukela had also had an old gusle on display.

Cukela was married to Minnie Myrtle Strayer of Mifflintown, Pennsylvania, on December 22, 1923, in Washington, D.C. Mrs. Cukela died on August 10, 1956, just months after Major Cukela. At the time of his death, Major Cukela was also survived by a sister, Mrs. Zorka Cukela Dvoracek, of Šibenik, Croatia.

<text>EuroBasket, also commonly referred to as the European Basketball Championship, is the main international basketball competition that is contested quadrennially, by the senior men&#x27;s national teams that are governed by FIBA Europe, which is the European zone within the International Basketball Federation.

The competition was first held in 1935. The former Soviet Union holds the record for most gold medals with a total of 14. The tournament is generally held in August or September, in the offseason of major club competitions. The current defending champion is Spain, who won the 2022 title.

==History==
===Beginning===

The first championships was held three years after the establishment of FIBA, in 1935. Switzerland was chosen as the host country, and ten countries joined. Only one qualifying match was played between Portugal and Spain. With a complicated formula, the final would see Latvia as champions. According to the rule at the time, the winner had to hold the following games. The following two tournaments would be won by Lithuania and would see the introduction of Egypt who would compete in EuroBasket until 1953 winning one championship at home in 1949 along the way. The 1941 edition of the tournament was scheduled be held in Lithuania as well, but was cancelled due to WWII.

===Soviet dominance===
After the 1946 edition saw the first jump shot performed by Italian player Giuseppe Stefanini, the following edition would see the Soviet Union compete in their first edition in the 1947 edition and would see the Soviets win the first of eleven out of the next thirteen European championships. During the 50s, the Soviet Union won four of the five competitions held during the decade with the only tournament that they did not win being the 1955 edition. This was won by Hungary as they finished top while the Soviets finished in third place. It was also during that edition that the thirty-second shot clock was introduced, which changed the style of basketball.

The Soviets would win all championships of the 60s. They had a fifty-five game winning streak which would be broken by Yugoslavia in 1969. The 1960s would see also a change in how the competition was viewed and run with FIBA putting a limit on the number of countries that entered to 16 with qualifiers being the way to bring them down to that number as it first appeared in 1963. The following edition would see the competition not be held in one city with Tbilisi joining Moscow in hosting games and in 1967 the first modern games were held, because the games were televised and international media were present.

===Rise of Yugoslavia===
The 1970s were the competition between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. During the decade Yugoslavia won three gold medals and the Soviet Union taking out the remaining two. After the Soviets won 1971, the 1973 edition would finally see Yugoslavia win their first championship after Spain defeated the Soviets in the semi-finals to qualify for their first final since the first edition way back in 1935. Yugoslavia would finally have a chance to defeat the Soviets as at home, they would get the chance to defeat them and they did as they won by six points to take home 1975 edition. After following that up in 1977, the Soviets would get their revenge in the final round at EuroBasket 1979 when they defeated them 96–77 to qualify through to the final where they would defeat Israel who shocked the basketball world as they defeated Yugoslavia in the opening round by a point.

Brewing under the Soviets and Yugoslavs, Western Europe was starting to appear with the 1980s seeing the change happen. In 1983, the Western side of Europe tasted success with Italy defeating Spain in the final to record their first of two titles. An important development happened in the following edition which was held in Germany. That edition saw the first three-point arc being used.

===New winners emerge and Spanish dominance===
Greece would win the next edition in 1987 at home after remarkable victory over heavily favored Soviet Union, with a 103–101 score in a gripping final decided in overtime. At the 1989 edition, Greece beat the Soviet team again in the semifinals with a one-point margin but then lost to hosts Yugoslavia in the final. EuroBasket 1991 was the first EuroBasket tournament in which currently active NBA players, that had also already played in an official NBA regular season game were allowed to participate. It would also be the first edition where the Soviets weren&#x27;t entered into the competition, as the USSR didn&#x27;t qualify for the main tournament and afterwards collapsed. Yugoslavia would take the title, but afterwards war would split the country up with Jure Zdovc being a &quot;casualty&quot; after Slovenia declared independence, two days into the tournament. 1993 saw a shock winner, with Germany taking the championship at home with a one-point victory over Russia. After being suspended in 1993, FR Yugoslavia came back and took the trophy after defeating Lithuania who was making its first appearance, since it had been a Soviet Republic. But politics came into play with the crowd protesting &quot;Lithuania is the champions&quot;, while the Croatian team who had defeated Greece for bronze step down from the podium in protest of the war that was happening at the time. Nevertheless, FR Yugoslavia managed to repeat their success in 1997 after victory over Italy in the final match.

Italy managed to win the last title of the 20th century, defeating Spain in the 1999 final. In 2001, FR Yugoslavia regained European title but it was their last victory at the EuroBasket. In 2003, Lithuania defeated Spain in the final match and won their first European trophy since 1939. In 2005, Greece repeated success of 1987 after beating Germany in the final match.

2007 saw a shock winner, with Russia taking their first EuroBasket title since the dissolution of the Soviet Union with a one-point victory over heavily favored Spanish hosts in Madrid. However, the next tournaments were dominated by Spain who finally gained their maiden European title in 2009 and then won 3 of 5 next editions. In 2013, France won their first European title. In 2017, Slovenia won the trophy, becoming the 14th country to win the EuroBasket. But in general, the first decades of the 21st century have been characterized by the dominance of Spanish team who has reached at least the semifinals of the 11 last tournaments, obtaining at these editions a total of four gold, three silver and three bronze medals, including the current title of 2022.

==Qualification==
24 European teams take part in the final competition. The qualification format that existed until the 2011 EuroBasket permitted 16 teams to compete. Eight spots were determined by the host nation and the top seven finishers of the previous EuroBasket. The remaining Division A teams compete in a qualification tournament. There, they were divided into four groups. Each group played a double round-robin. The top team in each group qualified for EuroBasket. The best three of the four runners-up also qualified.

Of the ten teams that did not qualify in the qualification tournament, the six best got another chance in the additional qualification round. The remaining four competed in a relegation round, with two being sent to Division B for the next qualification cycle (and replaced by the two best teams from Division B).

The final spot was determined by the additional qualifying round. The six teams were divided into two groups of three, with each group playing a double round-robin. The top team in each group played in the final against the other group&#x27;s top team; the winner of that game received the final EuroBasket qualification spot.

In 2015, the national team of Iceland became the smallest nation to ever qualify for a EuroBasket final stage at the population of around 330.000 people. The team was led by the former Dallas Maverick, Jón Arnór Stefánsson followed by a great performance which drove them through the qualifiers. In 2017, Iceland made back to back qualification to a EuroBasket final stage, then led by the young Martin Hermannsson.

==Competition format==
EuroBasket has used a number of different formats, ranging from the simple round-robin used in 1939, to a three-stage tournament, and now a two-stage tournament that is currently in use.

The current format begins with a preliminary round. The twenty-four qualified teams are placed into four groups of six, and each group plays a round-robin tournament. The top four teams in each group (16 overall) advance to the knockout stage. The knockout stage is a 16-team single-elimination tournament, with a bronze medal game for semi-final losers and classification games for the quarterfinal losers to determine fifth to eighth places.

<text>The Korean Service Medal (KSM) was a military award for service in the United States Armed Forces and was established November 8, 1950, by executive order of President Harry Truman. The Korean Service Medal is the primary US military award for service or participation in operations in the Korean area during the Korean War between June 27, 1950, and July 27, 1954.

==Medal devices==
===Service stars===
The United States Department of Defense declared thirteen official campaigns of the Korean War, all of which are annotated by service stars on the Korean Service Medal. Some campaigns apply to all branches of the US military, while others are branch specific. The Korean Service Medal is authorized a 3/16&quot; bronze or silver (indicates five campaigns) service star to denote participation in any of the following campaigns:

* North Korean Aggression (USMC, Navy): June 27 to November 2, 1950
* United Nations Defensive (Army, USAF): June 27 to September 15, 1950
* Inchon Landing (USMC, Navy): September 13 to 17, 1950
* United Nations Offensive (Army, USAF): September 16 to November 2, 1950
* Chinese Communist Forces Intervention (Army, USAF): November 3, 1950, to January 24, 1951
* Communist China Aggression (USMC, Navy): November 3, 1950, to January 24, 1951
* First United Nations Counteroffensive (USMC, Army, Navy, USAF): January 25 to April 21, 1951
* Chinese Communist Forces Spring Offensive (USMC, Army, Navy, USAF): April 22 to July 8, 1951
* United Nations Summer-Fall Offensive (USMC, Army, Navy, USAF): July 9 to November 27, 1951
* Second Korean Winter (USMC, Army, Navy, USAF): November 28, 1951, to April 30, 1952
* Korean Defense Summer-Fall, 1952 (USMC, Army, Navy, USAF): May 1 to November 30, 1952
* Third Korean Winter (USMC, Army, Navy, USAF): December 1, 1952, to April 30, 1953
* Korea, Summer 1953 (USMC, Army, Navy, USAF): May 1 to July 27, 1953

===Arrowhead device===
An arrowhead device is authorized for US Army or Air Force personnel to denote participation in each of the following:
* Amphibious landing at Inchon
* Airborne attacks on Sukch&#x27;on-Such&#x27;on and Munsan-Ni

===Fleet Marine Force combat operation insignia===
* The Fleet Marine Force Combat Operation Insignia is authorized for US Navy personnel who served with the Marine Corps at any time during the Korean War.

==History==
Although the Korean War Armistice ended combat operations in Korea on 27 July 1953, the Korean Service Medal was issued until June 1954 due to the tense nature of the occupation and garrison duty immediately after the armistice, as well as the high possibility of a renewed attack by North Korea. After 1954, the Korean Service Medal was no longer issued although the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal was authorized for Korean area service between October 1, 1966, to June 30, 1974. As of 2004, a new medal known as the Korea Defense Service Medal was authorized for members of the armed forces who served in the defense of the Republic of Korea from July 28, 1954, to a date to be determined.

The KSM was designed by the Army Heraldic Section. The color scheme of the ribbon is derived from the Flag of the United Nations, as it was under the auspices of the United Nations (United Nations Security Council Resolution 82) that the war was conducted. The medal itself features a &quot;Korean gateway,&quot; most likely an iljumun, on the front, and a taegeuk on the reverse.

The United Nations Service Medal for Korea was usually issued alongside the Korean Service Medal. Beginning in 1999, the Republic of Korea War Service Medal was also awarded to United States service members who received the Korean Service Medal. The Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation is retroactively authorized to any United States Army veteran who served in Korea during the War.

<text>DIIS (direct inversion in the iterative subspace or direct inversion of the iterative subspace), also known as Pulay mixing, is a technique for extrapolating the solution to a set of linear equations by directly minimizing an error residual (e.g. a Newton–Raphson step size) with respect to a linear combination of known sample vectors. DIIS was developed by Peter Pulay in the field of computational quantum chemistry with the intent to accelerate and stabilize the convergence of the Hartree–Fock self-consistent field method.

At a given iteration, the approach constructs a linear combination of approximate error vectors from previous iterations. The coefficients of the linear combination are determined so to best approximate, in a least squares sense, the null vector. The newly determined coefficients are then used to extrapolate the function variable for the next iteration. 

== Details ==

At each iteration, an approximate error vector, , corresponding to the variable value, is determined. After sufficient iterations, a linear combination of previous error vectors is constructed

:formula_1

The DIIS method seeks to minimize the norm of under the constraint that the coefficients sum to one. The reason why the coefficients must sum to one can be seen if we write the trial vector as the sum of the exact solution () and an error vector. In the DIIS approximation, we get:
:formula_2
We minimize the second term while it is clear that the sum coefficients must be equal to one if we want to find the exact solution.
The minimization is done by a Lagrange multiplier technique. Introducing an undetermined multiplier , a Lagrangian is constructed as

:formula_3

Equating zero to the derivatives of with respect to the coefficients and the multiplier leads to a system of linear equations to be solved for the coefficients (and the Lagrange multiplier). 

:formula_4 

Moving the minus sign to , results in an equivalent symmetric problem.
:formula_5 
The coefficients are then used to update the variable as

:formula_6

<text>Royal Air Force Silverstone or more simply RAF Silverstone is a former Royal Air Force (RAF) station, built during the Second World War, and used by the RAF from 1943 until 1947. It straddles the Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire border south west of Northampton, and is named after the nearby village of Silverstone.

In 1948 the Royal Automobile Club hosted the first British Grand Prix at this location, and the site is now a racing circuit known simply as &#x27;Silverstone&#x27;.

==RAF use 1943–1947==

The station was the base for No. 17 Operational Training Unit RAF operating the Vickers Wellington bomber.

==Since 1948==

Today the airfield is a major racing circuit known as Silverstone. Private aircraft and helicopters have continued to use this location, particularly in 2009 for the World Aerobatic Championships, but mostly it is now helicopters in connection with motor racing events. The airfield&#x27;s three runways, in a standard World War II era triangle, lie within the outline of the classic racetrack, but have either been removed, or re-purposed and are no longer available as dedicated runways. In 2010 the main straight between turn 5 and turn 6, following the line of one of the runways, was renamed the &#x27;Wellington Straight&#x27;.

The circuit is also home to the Silverstone Heliport.

<text>The Responsible Government League was a political movement in the Dominion of Newfoundland.

The Responsible Government League of Newfoundland, led by Peter Cashin, was formed in February 1947 by anti-Confederation delegates to the Newfoundland National Convention on the future of the colony. It was one of several Anti-Confederation movements which suffered intermittent popularity between 1865 and 1948 as the issue of Confederation between the colonies of Newfoundland and Canada was debated.

The purpose of the RGL was to ensure that Newfoundland and Canada remain separate countries.

==Background==

In the 19th century, various Anti-Confederates were strengthened in their resolve by outspoken figures such as Charles Fox Bennett who successfully championed Responsible Government&#x27;s cause in an election on the confederation issue in 1869. Bennett was opposed to Confederation because he feared the Québécois: he thought that if Newfoundland joined in Confederation with Quebec, then the Canadian Parliament would be dominated by Canada East (Quebec); he feared there would be a whole dynasty of French-Canadian statesmen who would centralize power in Ottawa and ignore the people of Newfoundland; he feared a National Unity Crisis within Canada and believed that Newfoundland would lose control of its natural resources to the new federal government. Both before and during the Confederation debates of the 1860s, there was a &quot;Native Newfoundlanders&quot; movement: The Newfoundland Natives&#x27; Society was formed in 1840 to lobby for more labour and employment rights in the forestry and fishery for Newfoundland residents. Also, songs such as &quot;The Anti-Confederation Song&quot; and &quot;The Antis of Plate Cove&quot; were popular at the time.

In 1869, the people of the Colony of Newfoundland voted in a General Election against Confederation with Canada. The Confederation debates were furious and sometimes ludicrous: Anti-Confederates charged Newfoundland children would be drafted into the Canadian Army and die to be left unburied in distant sandy, dry Canadian deserts. There was also vague, xenophobic, anti-French sentiment. Because Newfoundland did not join Canada in 1869, it would remain a separate political entity for a further four generations. During the 1890s the question of Confederation again arose but Canadian diplomats were cold to the idea.

The colony was granted dominion status at the same time as New Zealand.

During World War I, Newfoundland mustered its own Regiment, and sent it to both Gallipoli, Turkey and the Western Front, France. In return for this contribution, the Prime Minister of Newfoundland was appointed to Britain&#x27;s House of Lords. Newfoundland was granted dominion status and was as independent as Australia, Canada, or New Zealand in this Period. This was confirmed in the Balfour declaration and in The Statute of Westminster, 1931. The Great Depression hit the Newfoundland economy hard causing the dominion government to collapse in bankruptcy.

==Commission of Government==

Newfoundland&#x27;s economy experienced many cycles of recession. Its government&#x27;s finances collapsed completely in the early 1930s due in part to considerable debts incurred by the government in its aid of the Allied effort during the First World War and the large government debt acquired in constructing a railway across the island. Economic collapse led to political crisis. In 1932, due to economic dislocations brought about by the Great Depression, government corruption and a resulting riot and the lingering effects of a large public debt noted above, the Newfoundland economy collapsed and the government was forced out of office. A new government led by Frederick C. Alderdice came to power after promising to ask the British Government to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into the possibility of suspending responsible government. That Royal Commission recommended a &quot;rest from politics,&quot; after which the Newfoundland legislature requested that the British appoint a Commission of Government. In February 1934 the island reverted to something similar to crown colony status. A Commission of Government was established to govern the Dominion.

==Confederation debate==

Calls for a return to a system of democracy in Newfoundland had been quiet during the Second World War, but the question of Newfoundland&#x27;s constitution was reawakened by Clement Attlee in the British Parliament. In 1946, a &quot;National Convention&quot; was called by the Governor of Newfoundland and the Commissioners of Government. In September 1947 the assembly was convened. The mandate of the National Convention was to debate the various forms of government that the people were to choose from.

While almost all members of the National Convention advocated change, two strong factions soon developed. One called for Confederation with Canada. The other called for the restoration of responsible government for Newfoundland, and for it to revert to its previous status. Since the pro-Confederation forces in the Convention seemed to have the upper hand, a group of business and professional men and women outside the Convention formed a sort of political party, the RGL, to counter the effective pro-Confederation propaganda.

The RGL suffered a split on March 20, 1948 when a number of younger delegates and supporters, fearing that the League was poorly run and would lose the referendum, left to form the Party for Economic Union with the United States with Chesley Crosbie as its leader.

The RGL tended to draw its support from The Avalon peninsula, Bonavista South, and from Roman Catholics in Eastern Newfoundland. There were two referendums held in 1948 as the first vote on June 3 was inconclusive with responsible government receiving 44.6%, confederation 41.1% and Commission of Government 14.3%.

A second referendum was held with only confederation and responsible government on the ballot. The Economic Union Party and Responsible Government League tried to reunite the opposition to Joey Smallwood&#x27;s Confederate Association but relations between Crosbie and Cashin&#x27;s parties were tense allowing the Confederate League to benefit from better funding and a united organization. The Responsible Government League lost the second referendum held on July 22 with 47.7% of the vote compared to 52.3% for confederation.

The RGL attempted to scuttle or delay confederation through a petition to the British government, signed by 50,000 Newfoundlanders, demanding the immediate restoration of the Newfoundland House of Assembly arguing that only it had the authority to enact Confederation. The petition was ignored and a legal challenge by six members of the pre-1934 House of Assembly that argued that the National Convention Act and the Referendum Act were both unconstitutional was quashed when Justice Dunfield ruled that with the reversion of Newfoundland to Crown Colony status in 1934, the British Parliament was free to do as it saw fit.

Having lost the fight against Confederation, the Responsible Government League decided to join with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada and form the Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland with H. G. R. Mews as the new party&#x27;s first leader and RGL leaders Cashin and Malcolm Hollett leading the party through the 1950s.

<text>George Edward Peter Thorneycroft, Baron Thorneycroft, (26 July 1909 – 4 June 1994) was a British Conservative Party politician. He served as Chancellor of the Exchequer between 1957 and 1958.

==Early life==
Born in Dunston, Staffordshire, Thorneycroft was the son of Major George Edward Mervyn Thorneycroft and Dorothy Hope Franklyn. He was the grandson of Sir William Franklyn and nephew of Sir Harold Franklyn. He was educated at Eton and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He was commissioned into the Royal Artillery as a second lieutenant on 29 August 1929 but resigned his commission on 1 July 1931. In 1933, he was called to the bar for the Inner Temple.

==Political career==
He entered Parliament in the 1938 Stafford by-election, for the borough of Stafford. He was re-commissioned into the Royal Artillery in his previous rank on 30 August 1939. During the Second World War, he served with the Royal Artillery and the general staff. Along with other members of the Tory Reform Committee, Thorneycroft pressed his party to support the Beveridge Report.

He served in the Conservative caretaker Government 1945 as Parliamentary Secretary at the Ministry of War Transport. In the 1945 general election, he lost his seat to his Labour opponent, Stephen Swingler, but he returned in the 1945 Monmouth by-election for Monmouth a few months later.

Throughout the late 1940s Thorneycroft worked assiduously to refurbish the Conservative Party after its disastrous defeat in the 1945 general election. His opposition to the Anglo-American loan in the Commons earned him a reputation as a parliamentary debater, and when the Conservatives returned to power after the general election of 1951, he was appointed President of the Board of Trade. He was instrumental in persuading the government in 1954 to abandon the party&#x27;s support for protectionism and accept the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

=== Chancellorship and resignation ===
Thorneycroft&#x27;s support for Harold Macmillan in Macmillan&#x27;s successful 1957 leadership contest for the premiership led to his appointment as Chancellor of the Exchequer, one of the most senior positions in the government. He resigned in 1958, along with two junior Treasury Ministers, Enoch Powell and Nigel Birch, because of increased government expenditure. Macmillan, himself a former chancellor, made a famous and much-quoted remark that the resignations were merely &quot;little local difficulties&quot;. (In reality, Macmillan was deeply concerned about the possible effects of Thorneycroft&#x27;s resignation.)

In retrospect, Thorneycroft questioned the wisdom of his resignation, saying that &quot;we probably made our stand too early.&quot;

=== Later political career ===
Thorneycroft returned to the Cabinet in 1960, when he was appointed Minister of Aviation by Macmillan. In 1962, he was promoted to be Minister of Defence. He retained the post upon Macmillan&#x27;s replacement by Sir Alec Douglas-Home; then in April 1964 the post was combined with the First Lord of the Admiralty, Secretary of State for War and Secretary of State for Air as the Secretary of State for Defence. At Defence, Thorneycroft played a pivotal role in the Sunda Straits Crisis, first supporting and then opposing the passage of the aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Victorious&quot; through the Indonesian-claimed Sunda Strait during the height of the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation in August and September 1964.

After the Government was defeated in 1964, Thorneycroft first served as Shadow Secretary of State for Defence under Alec Douglas-Home, before being made Shadow Home Secretary by Edward Heath the next year. Thorneycroft lost his seat at the 1966 general election, and was raised to the peerage as a life peer as Baron Thorneycroft, of Dunston in the County of Stafford on 4 December 1967.

==Later life==
Thorneycroft was a strong supporter of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s monetarist policies and she made him Chairman of the Conservative Party in 1975, succeeding his third cousin William Whitelaw. He held the position until 1981.

He was notable as an amateur watercolourist and held exhibitions. Winston Churchill, when told of Thorneycroft&#x27;s interest, had said, &quot;Every minister must have his vice. Painting shall be yours&quot;.

He was appointed to the Order of the Companions of Honour as a Member (CH) in the 1980 New Year Honours. During his time as M.P. for Monmouth, Thorneycroft lived at Machen House, in the hamlet of Lower Machen, to the west of the City of Newport.

==Family==

His grandfather was the Victorian Colonel Thomas Thorneycroft, a Wolverhampton industrialist, eccentric, landowner and well-known Conservative; he was asked to stand for election by Benjamin Disraeli. Colonel Thorneycroft owned or leased various houses in Staffordshire and Shropshire including Tettenhall Towers and Tong Castle.

His great-grandfather was George Benjamin Thorneycroft, an ironfounder, JP, Deputy Lord Lieutenant of Staffordshire and first Mayor of Wolverhampton. His grandfather&#x27;s cousin was John Isaac Thorneycroft who founded Vosper Thorneycroft. Siegfried Sassoon and novelist Ellen Thorneycroft Fowler were Peter Thorneycroft&#x27;s second cousins, while William Whitelaw was his third. His great uncle was Lord Wolverhampton.

After Thorneycroft&#x27;s first marriage, to Sheila Wells Page, and divorce, he married Carla, Contessa Roberti (later known as Lady Thorneycroft, DBE) in 1949. He had a son by his first wife and a daughter by his second wife.

<text>Petaling Jaya (), colloquially referred to as &quot;PJ&quot;, is a city in Petaling District, in the state of Selangor, Malaysia. Originally developed as a satellite township for Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia, it is part of the Greater Kuala Lumpur area. Petaling Jaya was granted city status on 20 June 2006. It has an area of approximately .

Petaling Jaya is surrounded by Kuala Lumpur to the east, Sungai Buloh to the north, Shah Alam, the capital of Selangor, and Subang Jaya to the west, and Bandar Kinrara (Puchong) to the south.

== History ==
Under plans developed by Francis McWilliams, the city was developed during post-war British Malaya on a piece of rubber estate, the &quot;Effingham Estate&quot;, around Old Klang Road to address the overpopulation of the capital Kuala Lumpur in the 1950s. Since 1952, PJ witnessed a dramatic growth in terms of population size and geographical importance. The development of Petaling Jaya commenced in 1952 with the construction of 800 houses centred on the area known as &quot;Old Town&quot; today.

Lieutenant-General Sir Gerald Templer (then the British High Commissioner of Malaya and Petaling District council chairman) planned for Petaling Jaya to be a satellite town to prevent people from assisting the communists; the earlier housing areas were fenced off from the surrounding area. The first two main roads built in Petaling Jaya were simply called &quot;Jalan 1&quot; or Road 1 and &quot;Jalan 2&quot; or Road 2. Road 1 was later named Jalan Templer while Road 2 was named Jalan Othman after Othman Mohamad, former Menteri Besar (Chief Minister) of Selangor.

Until the end of 1953, the town was administered by the Kuala Lumpur district officer. The Petaling Jaya Town Authority headed by N.A.J. Kennedy commenced administering Petaling Jaya in 1954. On 24 August 1959, Encik Abdul Aziz bin Haji Mohd Ali became the first Malayan to head the PJ Authority. Administratively and historically, it was considered part of Kuala Lumpur. However, Petaling Jaya ceased to be part of Kuala Lumpur when the latter became a Federal Territory on 1 February 1974. It then became a township in its own right within the state of Selangor.

Petaling Garden Berhad was the pioneer private development company, responsible for the development of some areas of Petaling Jaya. It was started in 1957 by a group of Chinese businessmen including Ang Toon Chew, Robert Kuok, Tan Kim Yeow, Tan Chin Nam, Ho Yeow Khoon and Low Boon Chian. The company went on to develop &quot;thousands of acres&quot; in Petaling Jaya more specifically, Section 5, 6 and 17, to become the townships Taman Petaling Klang and Sri Petaling to name a few. Petaling Garden was brought to the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange and became one of the first publicly listed Property Development Companies in Malaysia. The company was bought over by Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB) in the year 2007, it was valued at RM 964 million at time of purchase.

Southern Petaling Jaya, from Section 8 to PJ Old Town, had the first settlements that were established around 1953. As development progressed, Northern Petaling Jaya, on the other side of the Federal Highway was developed. The first shopping complex in Petaling Jaya was Jaya Shopping Centre (better known as Jaya Supermarket). Built in 1974, it is located in Section 14.

On 1 January 1977, following the passing of the Local Government Act the previous year, the Petaling Jaya Town Authority was reorganised to become Petaling Jaya Municipal Council or Majlis Perbandaran Petaling Jaya (MPPJ). Petaling Jaya progressed rapidly due to the massive rural-urban migration. As more people from rural areas immigrated, Sungai Way and Subang districts along with areas such as Subang Jaya, Seksyen 52 (New Town or colloquially known as &quot;State&quot;, the name of the first, former cinema in the area) developed in areas under the jurisdiction of the municipality.

Following a boundary realignment exercise in January 1997, parts of Petaling Jaya including Subang Jaya, USJ, Putra Heights, and Bandar Sunway were ceded to the newly formed Subang Jaya Municipal Council or MPSJ at the time. In exchange, the MPPJ annexed Bandar Utama, Sungai Buloh, Bukit Lanjan, and Kota Damansara from the Petaling District Council (&quot;Majlis Daerah Petaling&quot;, MDP), which disestablished itself after the cession.

Due to the proximity of the city to the capital of Malaysia, Petaling Jaya had and have been the headquarters of many federal government departments such as the Jabatan Pendaftaran Negara (National Registration Department, 1958–2004), the Jabatan Arkib Negara Malaysia (Malaysian National Archive Department, 1961–1982), and the Jabatan Kimia Malaysia (Malaysian Chemistry Department, 1957–).

===COVID-19 pandemic===

In 2020, the city was part of the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown, or the movement control order (MCO), where residents were confined to their homes and only allowed out for essential purposes.

On April 27, the market in the city&#x27;s oldest quarter, Old Town, was shut down down after a seafood trader there tested positive for the virus, prompting health authorities to call for customers to get themselves screened.

Less than two weeks later, large parts of Old Town came under a full government lockdown on May 10 after the discovery of 26 COVID-19 cases from the market area. Over 2,900 people in the quarter were fenced in and prevented from leaving the area, as authorities cordoned off 40ha of the area with barb wire from the rest of the city. Scheduled to last until May 23, the lockdown was eventually lifted on May 21.

After a lull in cases thanks to a nationwide lifting of restrictions, the city began to see a rise in cases in October following a spike in virus infections after infections rose in the eastern state of Sabah, where elections were held in September.

Over 800 people working at the Tropicana Golf and Country Resort were barred from leaving their hostel, as authorities put the compound under a total lockdown. Five people there tested positive for Covid 19, including two who had just returned from the eastern state of Sabah.

In the first two weeks of the month, at least four malls in the city reported COVID-19 infections. This included the 1Utama shopping mall, which was ordered to close for seven days from October 12.

Meanwhile, a teacher at the Taman Sea secondary school also tested positive for the virus on October 7, leading students and staff members there to self-quarantine. A few days later, education authorities in the country ordered 298 schools in Selangor state&#x27;s Petaling district, which include Petaling Jaya, Shah Alam and Subang Jaya, to shut down from Oct 12 to Oct 25 as COVID-19 cases in the country rose.

== Climate ==
Petaling Jaya is one of the wettest cities in Malaysia. It is warm with an average maximum of 30 degrees Celsius and receives heavy rainfall all year round, roughly more than of average rainfall annually. The city has no particular true dry season, but June and July are the driest months. Mostly each month average rainfall receives more than . Thunderstorms and extreme rainstorms are common, and it is one of the highest lightning strike areas in the world. But due to normal global temperature variations, Petaling Jaya is experiencing severe drought with frequent water rationing among neighbourhoods.

==Governance==
The local administration of Petaling Jaya is carried out by Petaling Jaya City Council (Majlis Bandaraya Petaling Jaya, MBPJ), formerly known as Petaling Jaya Authority from 1954 until 1977 and Petaling Jaya Municipal Council (Majlis Perbandaran Petaling Jaya, MPPJ) from 1977 until 2006. Six mayors have been appointed since Petaling Jaya was awarded city status on 20 June 2006. The current mayor is Mohamad Azhan Md. Azmir, who has been in office since 21 October 2021.

The residents of Petaling Jaya are served by four Members of Parliament from Pakatan Harapan, which is DAP&#x27;s Gobind Singh Deo in , PKR&#x27;s Lee Chean Chung in , PKR&#x27;s Ramanan Ramakrishnan in and PKR&#x27;s Wong Chen in .

==City sections==
Petaling Jaya is divided into several sections. Some are subdivided into smaller neighbourhoods (&quot;kejiranan&quot;), for example SS5D. Some sections have their own names (SS1 as Kampung Tunku), while other sections are grouped together (SS3, SS4, SS5, SS6 and SS7 as part of Kelana Jaya). Besides that, Petaling Jaya also comprises the affluent township of Damansara. SS is not the same as Seksyen but as the short acronym for Sungai Way-Subang instead.

==Demographics==
, Petaling Jaya claimed 613,977 residents living in the area of . The actual population by 2015 would have been a little over 550,000 residents without taking into account the total population of the Kuala Lumpur-Petaling Jaya conurbation which would have resulted in a total population of 1.5 million.

==Landmarks==

A prominent landmark in PJ is the Kota Darul Ehsan arch which symbolically marks the boundary between Kuala Lumpur and Petaling Jaya. This arch straddled the Federal Highway (Lebuhraya Persekutuan) which was originally the only highway link between Petaling Jaya and Kuala Lumpur. However, many links now exist as alternatives to the congested Federal Highway.

Close to the Kelana Jaya Line&#x27;s Taman Jaya station is the Petaling Jaya Museum, as well as the Thai Wat Chetawan temple. This ornate building is very popular amongst the Buddhist community. A short drive ahead is PJ State, the nickname for the Central Business District of Petaling Jaya with the landmark Menara MBPJ as a focal point. PJ State is more formally referred to as PJ New Town.

==Economy==

The 1980s saw the establishment of shopping malls like The Atria in Damansara Jaya and Subang Parade in the nearby suburb or satellite town of Subang Jaya. The Atria provided the opportunity for residents to patronise either the Japanese Kimisawa or the French Printemps department stores, as well as a Burger King restaurant.

In 1995, 1 Utama commenced operations at Bandar Utama. Jaya Jusco, a Japanese department store which had operated since 1984 at Taman Tun Dr Ismail later relocated as one of the anchor tenants of 1 Utama.

Lotus&#x27;s (formerly Tesco) supermarket commenced operations in Mutiara Damansara in 2003. This was quickly followed by the Ikano Power Centre (now renamed as IPC Shopping Centre) in 2004 and The Curve in 2005. At about the same time, the 1 Utama new wing had commenced operations, which then became the largest shopping mall in Malaysia (or currently 12th largest shopping mall in the world).

In 2004, Giant Hypermarket commenced operations in Kelana Jaya. This complex houses the Giant Hypermarket and some shops to create a more shopping centre style. It was easily accessed off the Damansara–Puchong Expressway. It was eventually closed down permanently on 26 November 2023 as the land was bought by a developer to make way for a new condominium. Located right opposite across the LDP is Paradigm Mall, which opened in mid-2012. Paradigm Mall was developed by WCT on the former Kelana Jaya garbage landfill.

Cambridge Analytica claimed to have an office in Kota Damansara; checks shown that the reported address was used for residential purpose.

==Properties in Petaling Jaya==
Active property developers in Petaling Jaya are PKNS, Sunway Bhd, Tropicana Bhd, AmCorp, Mah Sing Group and Guocoland as well as many others. Due to the size of Petaling Jaya township, property development in the area also includes small to medium-sized developers such as Sri Aman Development and Nusmetro.

Before the rapid development and commercialisation of Petaling Jaya, there were only a handful of residential developments that comprises mostly low to medium-cost apartments as well as terrace houses. By 2005, luxurious condominiums, semi-detached houses, and bungalows are a common sight within the area. These high-end properties are mostly located at Bukit Gasing, Section 16 &amp; 17, SS7 Kelana Jaya, and more recent ones such as Tropicana, and Ara Damansara.

==Transport==

===Bus===
Bus services were initially provided by Sri Jaya between the early 1950s until the early 1990s. Some SEA Park residents may recall the old Sri Jaya Leyland Albion buses on the No. 241 service struggling to climb the relatively steep Jalan 21/1.

The introduction of the IntraKota bus system by DRB-HICOM saw the replacement of Sri Jaya and the mini-buses by the early 1990s. Around the same time, some of the Petaling Jaya-Kuala Lumpur bus routes were serviced by Metrobus.

The introduction of the PUTRA-LRT light rapid transit service in 1998 saw the addition of the Putraline feeder bus services.

The ownership of the PUTRA-LRT and its Putraline feeder bus services, as well as the IntraKota bus system, were taken over by Prasarana Malaysia in 2002 and 2004 respectively, eventually transferring all rail and bus operations to the Rapid KL system. Today, most of the public transportation in the form of busses in Petaling Jaya is operated by Rapid Bus under the Rapid KL brand, which also operates bus services in Kuala Lumpur and the rest of the Klang Valley area. Rapid Bus also operates the PJ City Bus, a free bus service funded by the Petaling Jaya City Council.

===Rail===

There are currently three rapid transit lines and one commuter rail line serving Petaling Jaya. These lines also provide connections to a bus rapid transit line and a inter-city rail service.

The PUTRA-LRT line, subsequently renamed LRT Kelana Jaya Line and currently operated by Rapid Rail under the Rapid KL brand, has a total of seven stations serving central and southern Petaling Jaya, which are the , , , , , and stations.

The newly constructed MRT Kajang Line and MRT Putrajaya Line, which opened in 2017 and 2022 respectively, serve the northern part of Petaling Jaya&#x27;s municipal area, also known as Damansara. The lines call at , , and on the Kajang Line, and the , , and stations on the Putrajaya Line.

<text>Hugh II of Cyprus (or Hugues II de Lusignan) (June–August, 1252 or 1253 – November or December 5, 1267) was king of Cyprus and, from the age of 5 years, also Regent of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

==Biography==
On January 18, 1253, at the age of two months, he succeeded his father Henry I as king of Cyprus, with his mother, Queen Plaisance, acting as regent, and was crowned at Santa Sophia, Nicosia, later in that year. Although he had only a weaker claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, many felt that he was a better candidate (living in a Crusader state close to the Palestinian coast) than Conradin, the Hohenstaufen claimant who was also a child but absent in Europe (Hugh II was second in order of succession, right after Conradin himself, since he was the son of the only surviving son of Alice of Champagne, the second surviving daughter of Queen Isabella I of Jerusalem and thus Conradin&#x27;s great-grandaunt). In 1258 John of Ibelin, lord of Jaffa, and Bohemund VI of Antioch brought Hugh and Plaisance to Acre, where Hugh was set up as regent for Conradin, and Plaisance was chosen to carry out Hugh&#x27;s regency while he remained underage, becoming Lord of Jerusalem.

In 1261, Plaisance died and the regency of Cyprus passed to Hugh of Antioch-Lusignan, Hugh II&#x27;s 25-year-old first cousin. His mother, Hugh II&#x27;s younger aunt Isabella of Lusignan became acting regent of Jerusalem in Acre. Hugh II died in Nicosia in November 1267 at the age of 14 and was buried in the Dominican Church in Nicosia. He had been betrothed and was possibly married at Nicosia in 1264/1265 to Isabella of Ibelin (ca. 1252 – Beirut, 1282/1283 and buried there), Lady of Beirut 1264, but the marriage was never consummated. He was succeeded by Hugh of Lusignan-Antioch (son of his younger aunt Isabella) as Hugh III of Cyprus, though his heir-general was another first cousin, Hugh of Brienne (c. 1240–1296), son of Mary of Cyprus, the eldest aunt of the deceased Hugh II. This claim fell to his son Walter V of Brienne and his descendants. They are the heirs-general of King Amalric I of Cyprus.

It has often been claimed that 1266 Thomas Aquinas dedicated his work &quot;De regimine principum&quot; (&quot;On the Government of Rulers&quot;) to Hugh II, but in view of the strong argument by Christoph Flüeler (Rezeption und Interpretation der Aristotelischen “Politica” im späten Mittelalter, Bochumer Studien zur Philosophie, 19 (Amsterdam and Philadelphia: B.R. Grüner, 1992), 2v.; v.1, 23–29.) for redating the work to 1271–73, it now seems likely that it was written for his successor Hugh III (1267–84). Later works, such as Panos Leventis&#x27; &quot;Twelve Times in Nicosia. Nicosia, Cyprus, 1192-1570: Topography, Architecture and Urban Experience in a Diversified Capital City&quot; (Nicosia: Cyprus Research Center, 2005, pp. 49, 51) argue for the earlier dating and the work&#x27;s dedication to Hugh II, based on a perceived &quot;formative&quot; understanding of Aristotelian works by Aquinas, i.e. prior to 1265.

<text>Rad is a comic book supervillain in the Femforce comic published by AC Comics.

Rad possesses superhuman strength, together with the ability to fly (although only over short distances). Her true identity was Jennifer Burke, daughter of the original Miss Victory, who in the 1940s developed the &quot;V-formula&quot; to increase the strength/stamina of allied troops. The initial formula, V-45, turned Dan Barton, crack covert agent and boyfriend of Laura Wright, into the supervillain Black Commando. Joan Wayne was able to alter the formula, creating V-47, which only worked on herself and only for a short period of time, and she became the superheroine &quot;Miss Victory&quot;.

In the 1980s, the Black Commando force-fed some of the V-45 to Joan. In addition to permanent super strength and youth, she developed the same paranoia and narcissism that the Black Commando had. She took the name &quot;Rad&quot; and became a ruthless mercenary. Eventually, Femforce was able to expunge the V-45 from her system and restore Joan&#x27;s normal personality.

In the meantime, Joan Wayne was replaced by her grown-up daughter Jennifer Burke (the only other person on whom the V-47 would work) becoming the second Miss Victory. After the return of Joan Wayne to the Miss Victory codename, Jennifer Burke left Femforce and was chosen to lead the New Sentinels of Justice under the name of Paragon which was objected to by the original Paragon. The combined stress of replacing her mother in Femforce, her son being killed by a villain, losing her husband in an affair with a team member, and then being replaced by her mother left Jennifer vulnerable to the machinations of the Shroud. Once again, she followed in her mother&#x27;s footsteps, taking the V-45 and becoming the new Rad.

<text>Music engraving is the art of drawing music notation at high quality for the purpose of mechanical reproduction. The term &quot;music copying&quot; is almost equivalent—though &quot;music engraving&quot; implies a higher degree of skill and quality, usually for publication. The name of the process originates in plate engraving, a widely used technique dating from the late sixteenth century. The term &quot;engraving&quot; is now used to refer to any high-quality method of drawing music notation, particularly on a computer (&quot;computer engraving&quot; or &quot;computer setting&quot;) or by hand (&quot;hand engraving&quot;).

== Traditional engraving techniques ==

=== Elements of music engraving style ===
Mechanical music engraving began in the middle of the fifteenth century. As musical composition increased in complexity, so too did the technology required to produce accurate musical scores. Unlike literary printing, which mainly contains printed words, music engraving communicates several different types of information simultaneously. To be clear to musicians, it is imperative that engraving techniques allow absolute precision. Notes of chords, dynamic markings, and other notation line up with vertical accuracy. If text is included, each syllable matches vertically with its assigned melody. Horizontally, subdivisions of beats are marked not only by their flags and beams, but also by the relative space between them on the page. The logistics of creating such precise copies posed several problems for early music engravers, and have resulted in the development of several music engraving technologies.

=== Movable type ===
Similar to book printing, music printing began in the fifteenth century with the use of movable type. The central problem posed to early music engravers using moveable type was the proper integration of notes, staves, and text. Often, staff lines were hand drawn prior to printing, or added to the printed music afterward. Ottaviano Petrucci, one of the most innovative music printers working at the turn of the sixteenth century, used a triple impression technique that printed staves, text, and notes in three separate steps.

=== Plate engraving ===

Although plate engraving had been used since the early fifteenth century for creating visual art and maps, it was not applied to music until 1581. In this method, a mirror image of a complete page of music was engraved onto a metal plate. Ink was then applied to the grooves, and the music print was transferred onto paper. Metal plates could be stored and reused, which made this method an attractive option for music engravers. Copper was the initial metal of choice for early plates, but by the eighteenth century pewter became the standard material due to its malleability and lower cost.

At first, plates were engraved freely by hand. Eventually, music engravers developed a number of tools to aid in their process, including:
* A rastrum to draw staff lines
* Scorers for staves and bar lines, the use of which inspired the term musical score
* Flat gravers for ledger lines and crescendos and diminuendos
* Elliptical gravers for ties
* Punches for noteheads, clefs, accidentals, and letters

Plate engraving was the methodology of choice for music printing until the late nineteenth century, at which point its decline was hastened by the development of photographic technology. Nevertheless, the technique has survived to the present day, and is still occasionally used by select publishers such as G. Henle Verlag in Germany.

=== Hand copying ===
Historically, a musician was required to draw their own staff lines (staves) onto blank paper. Eventually, staff paper was manufactured pre-printed with staves as a labor-saving technique. The musician could then write music directly onto the lines in pencil or ink.

In the twentieth century, music staff paper was sometimes printed on vellum or onionskin—a durable, semi-transparent material that made it easier for the musician to correct mistakes and revise the work, and also made it possible to reproduce the manuscript through the ozalid process. Also at this time, a music copyist was often employed to hand-copy individual parts (for each performer) from a composer&#x27;s full score. Neatness, speed, and accuracy were desirable traits of a skilled copyist.

=== Other techniques ===
* Lithography: Similar to metal plate engraving, the music was etched onto limestone and then burned onto the surface with acid to preserve the stone plates for future use.
* Stencils, stamps, and dry transfers, including the Notaset, a system inspired by the Letraset used in the twentieth century. Brushing ink through stencils was a high-quality technique used by Amersham-based company Halstan &amp; Co.
* Music typewriters: Originally developed in the late nineteenth century, this technology did not become popular until the mid-1900s. The machines required the use of pre-printed manuscript paper. This technique produced low-quality results and was never widely used.

== Computer music engraving ==
With the advent of the personal computer since the 1980s, traditional music engraving has been in decline, as it can now be accomplished by computer software designed for this purpose. There are various such programs, known as scorewriters, designed for writing, editing, printing and playing back music, though only a few produce results of a quality comparable to high-quality traditional engraving. One such program was SCORE for MS-DOS. Scorewriters have many advanced features, such as the ability to extract individual parts from an orchestral/band score, to transcribe music played on a MIDI keyboard, and conversely to play back notation via MIDI.

Beginning in the 1980s, WYSIWYG software such as Sibelius, Mozart, MusicEase, MuseScore, Finale, and Dorico first let musicians enter complex music notation on a computer screen, displaying it just as it will look when eventually printed. Such software stores the music in files of proprietary or standardized formats, usually not directly readable by humans.

Other software, such as GNU LilyPond and Philip&#x27;s Music Writer, reads input from ordinary text files whose contents resemble a computer macro programming language that describes bare musical content with little or no layout specification. The software translates the usually handwritten description into fully engraved graphical pages to view or send for printing, taking care of appearance decisions from high level layout down to glyph drawing. The music entry process is iterative and is similar to the edit-compile-execute cycle used to debug computer programs.

Beside ready-made applications there are also some programming libraries for music engraving, such as Vexflow (Javascript library), Verovio (C++, Javascript and Python), Guido Engine (C++ library), and Manufaktura Controls (.NET libraries). The main purpose of these libraries is to reduce time required for development of software with score rendering capabilities.

<text>Thomas Hampson (28 October 1907 – 4 September 1965) was an English athlete, winner of the 800 metres at the 1932 Summer Olympics and the first man to run 800 metres in under 1 minute 50 seconds.

== Biography ==
Hampson, a native of Clapham (London), didn&#x27;t take up running seriously until the last year of his studies at Oxford University. After completing his education, he became a teacher in 1930 (at St Albans School). That same year, he became the national 880 yards champion after winning the British AAA Championships title at the 1930 AAA Championships. 

Also a winner at the inaugural British Empire Games, he retained his title at the 1931 AAA Championships.

Hampson was one of the world&#x27;s leading runners in the 800 metres and half-mile event and won the 880 yards title again at the 1932 AAA Championships, as well as finishing second behind Crew Stoneley in the 440 yards. 

Shortly afterwards he was selected to represent Great Britain at the 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles and was one of the favourites for the 800 metre gold. In the final, Hampson fought off Canadian Alex Wilson to break the tape in 1.49.7, a new world record.

He added a second Olympic medal with the British 4 × 400 metres relay team, which came second to the United States. Hampson ended his sports career later that year. Several years later, he left his teaching job to become an educator in the Royal Air Force, a job he kept until after World War II.

In 1954, Hampson moved to Stevenage, Hertfordshire, and joined the Stevenage Development Corporation as Social Relations Officer. He was a warden at the church of St Mary in the town, and after he died at the age of 57, he was buried there. Hampson Park in the town was later named after him.

<text>Secure Terminal Equipment (STE) is the U.S. government&#x27;s current (), encrypted telephone communications system for wired or &quot;landline&quot; communications. STE is designed to use ISDN telephone lines which offer higher speeds of up to 128 kbit/s and are all digital. The greater bandwidth allows higher quality voice and can also be utilized for data and fax transmission through a built-in RS-232 port. STE is intended to replace the older STU-III office system and the KY-68 tactical system. STE sets are backwards compatible with STU-III phones, but not with KY-68 sets.

STE sets look like ordinary high-end office desk telephones and can place unsecured calls to anywhere on the public switched telephone network (PSTN), as well as secured calls on it via the phone&#x27;s backwards compatible STU-III mode. There is a PC Card slot in the STE that allows a Fortezza Plus (KOV-14) Crypto Card or KSV-21 Enhanced Crypto Card to be inserted. When an NSA configured Crypto Card is present, secure calls can be placed to other STE phones. STE phones are &quot;releasable&quot; (unlike STU-III sets). All cryptographic algorithms are in the crypto card.

Newer STE sets can communicate with systems that use the Secure Communications Interoperability Protocol (SCIP) (formerly Future Narrowband Digital Terminal (FNBDT)). There are upgrade kits available for older units.

==Models==
* Office: The Office STE is the most widely used STE and provides voice and data access to ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) and PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) telecommunications systems.
* Tactical: The Tactical STE is similar to the Office STE but can also access the TRI-TAC (TRI Service TACtical) network and has a serial EIA-530A/EIA-232 BDI (Black Digital Interface) port.
* Data: The Data STE provides remote access for voice, fax, data and video-conferencing. This model has two serial EIA-530A/EIA-232 BDI ports and allows for data transfers to multiple destinations.
* C2: The C2 STE is similar to the Tactical STE but C2 has modified software for use with its Tactical Terminal Locking Handset mechanism.
* STE-R: Similar to the Data STE, the STE-R&quot;emote&quot; provides dial-in access to the Defense Red Switch Network (DRSN).
* VoIP: The STE now has Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) capability, available as an upgrade to the current models, or built into some new models.

As of 2007, a typical STE terminal cost about $3,100, not including the crypto card.

<text>Dylan Dog is an Italian horror comics series created by Tiziano Sclavi and published by Sergio Bonelli Editore since 1986.

The series features the eponymous character, a paranormal investigator who takes on cases involving supernatural elements such as ghosts, demons, vampires, undeads, werewolves and other creatures, but also horrifying sociopathic criminals and serial killers. It defies the whole preceding horror tradition with a vein of surrealism and an anti-bourgeois rhetoric. Dylan is supported mainly by his trusty sidekick Groucho (a Groucho Marx lookalike) who adds humour to this grisly genre and Dylan&#x27;s sombre temperament. The series is mainly set in London, where the protagonist lives, though he occasionally travels elsewhere.

Dark Horse Comics has published the English version of &quot;Dylan Dog&quot; in the United States in 1999, 2002 and 2009; a new edition was published by Epicenter Comics as of 2017. Sergio Bonelli Editore also released a limited English variant edition in 2018. The series has sold over 60 million copies worldwide, and is the second best-selling comic book in Italy after the &quot;Tex&quot; series, another publication by Sergio Bonelli Editore, with over 120,000 copies sold each month.

The film &quot;Cemetery Man&quot; (original title: &quot;Dellamorte Dellamore&quot;, 1994) starring Rupert Everett, was loosely based on the comics, but its main reference was Tiziano Sclavi&#x27;s novel &quot;Dellamorte Dellamore&quot;. A direct American film adaptation, &quot;Dylan Dog: Dead of Night&quot;, starring Brandon Routh, was instead released in 2011, although it was significantly different from the source material. A television series based on the comics is also in development.

==Publication history==

Dylan Dog was created by Tiziano Sclavi, a comics and novel writer, while the graphic representation of the character was elaborated mainly by Angelo Stano, who was its first cover artist too, taking the inspiration from the English actor Rupert Everett, as he saw in the movie &quot;Another Country&quot;. The character was named for poet Dylan Thomas, while his surname derives from &quot;&quot;Dog figlio di...&quot;, the Italian title of Mickey Spillane&#x27;s 1972 book &quot;Erection Set&quot;&quot;, which was the provisional name Scalvi gave to his characters during the creation phase of his books before completing them.

&quot;Dylan Dog&quot; series debuted in October 1986 with a comic book entitled &quot;L&#x27;alba dei morti viventi&quot; (&quot;Dawn of the Living Dead&quot;), plotted and scripted by Tiziano Sclavi and illustrated by Angelo Stano; it proved to be a huge publishing success in the years to come. May 2003 saw the publication of Issue 200, entitled &quot;Il numero duecento&quot; (&quot;The Number Two-Hundred&quot;), plotted and scripted by Paola Barbato and drawn by Bruno Brindisi. In August 2011, the series has reached the number 300, entitled &quot;Ritratto di famiglia&quot; (&quot;Family Portrait&quot;).

===Annuals===

In August 1987 a special annual release was added to the monthly series, called &quot;Numero Speciale&quot; (&quot;Special Issue&quot;), with one story longer than usual and, in addition, small extra books on various horror-related subjects.

Another annual release was added in March 1991, &quot;L&#x27;almanacco della paura&quot; (&quot;The Almanac of Fear&quot;): together with Dylan Dog stories, it includes articles and curiosities about film, literature, and other topics, all related to the horror theme.

January 1993 saw the appearance of a new annual book, the &quot;Dylan Dog Gigante&quot; (&quot;Giant-Size Dylan Dog&quot;), so called because it was much larger than the monthly book and because it contained more stories.

&quot;Dylan Dog maxi&quot; came out in July 1998. This was another annual release that collected together three previously unpublished stories.

===Specials===

In October 1990 an irregularly numbered issue came out: &quot;Dylan Dog e Martin Mystère – Ultima Fermata: l&#x27;incubo!&quot; (&quot;Dylan Dog and Martin Mystère – Last Stop: Nightmare!&quot;). It presented an unpublished story in which the nightmare investigator teamed up with another famous Bonelli character, Martin Mystère. Alfredo Castelli and Tiziano Sclavi wrote and plotted this story, and Angelo Stano did the drawings. The story had a sequel in 1992.

===Reprints===

The first reprint series came out in July 1990, the second in June 1991, and the third in June 1996, this time called &quot;Collezione Book&quot; (&quot;Collection Book&quot;); in October 2006 the bi-monthly reprint &quot;Grande ristampa&quot; was released.

February 1997 saw the release of the &quot;Super Book&quot;, a tri-monthly release that reprinted the special annual issues that had come out ten years before.

===Dylan Dog Color Fest===

In August 2007, a new annual was released. Containing 4 new stories, the new comic book was called &quot;Dylan Dog Color Fest&quot; because it contained only stories full colored and not black and white like the regular series. In 2010 it became bi-annual (coming out in April and August every year). By 2016, each album would contain 3 colored stories – even though some albums also contain one individual story – and it would get published each number every three months. In November 2018, the 27th album will be released.

==Colored issues==
&quot;Dylan Dog&quot; (like all Sergio Bonelli comic books) is printed in black and white. However, there are some issues that came out full colored to celebrate certain anniversaries. These include numbers that are multiple of 100, decade anniversaries of the series and other rare occasions.

The first full colored issue was # 100, titled &quot;La storia di Dylan Dog&quot; (&quot;The Story of Dylan Dog&quot;), which told the final chapter of the adventure of Dylan. It was written by Tiziano Sclavi with drawings by Angel Stano. Color issue 121, &quot;Finché morte non vi separi&quot; (Till Death Do Us Part) celebrated the 10th birthday. Issue number 200 &quot;Il Numero 200&quot; (&quot;The Number 200&quot;), written by Paola Barbato with art by Bruno Brindisi, was also full colored and was the &quot;sequel&quot; of number 121 and the &quot;prequel&quot; of the very first issue (&quot;Dawn of the Living Dead&quot;). It tells what happened after Dylan&#x27;s wife dies and how he became the &quot;nightmare investigator&quot;. Issue 241 and 242 celebrated the 20th birthday of the series. Also in color was Sclavi and Brindisi&#x27;s #250, &quot;Ascensore per l&#x27;inferno&quot; (literally &quot;Elevator to Hell&quot;). The next full colored issue would be #300, &quot;Ritratto di famiglia&quot; (&quot;Family Picture&quot;). Other coloured issues are number #131 &quot;Quando cadono le stelle&quot; (&quot;When the Stars Fall&quot;, only final pages not in black and white), #224 &quot;In nome del padre&quot; (In Father&#x27;s Name), #350 &quot;Lacrime di pietra&quot; (&quot;Tears of Stone&quot;), #361 &quot;Mater Dolorosa&quot; and #375 &quot;Nel Mistero&quot; (&quot;To Mystery&quot;), which celebrates the return of Tiziano Sclavi in writing the script.

==Characterisation==

Dylan Dog is a penniless &quot;nightmare investigator&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;indagatore dell&#x27;incubo&quot;) who defies the whole preceding horror tradition with a vein of surrealism and an anti-bourgeois rhetoric.

His clothes are one of his defining characteristics: he always dresses the same way, in a red shirt, black jacket, and blue jeans; he bought twelve identical outfits after the death of his lover Lillie Connolly. Even during the worst weather, he never wears an overcoat or even carries an umbrella, since, according to him, an overcoat &quot;would ruin his look&quot;, and he thinks that an umbrella is a &quot;useless invention. Especially when it doesn&#x27;t rain.&quot;

One of the principal supporting characters in the series is his assistant (or rather, comic relief), Groucho, a punning double of Groucho Marx. Another supporting character is Inspector Bloch, who was his superior when he worked at Scotland Yard and remains his father figure (in fact he calls Dylan &quot;Old boy&quot;) even after Dylan struck out on his own to become a private investigator specializing in the supernatural.

Dylan lives with Groucho at 7 Craven Road in a cluttered apartment with a doorbell that screams. His hobbies include playing the clarinet (he only knows to play Devil&#x27;s Trill, but plays it often) and constructing a model ship which he apparently never manages to finish; he has many phobias, including claustrophobia, fear of bats and acrophobia. Dylan is also particularly susceptible to motion sickness, which is one of the reasons why he rarely travels, and anyway never by plane. Once an alcoholic, he now never drinks. He is a vegetarian and animal rights supporter. Dylan cares little for many aspects of modern life. He hates cellphones and to record his memories, he still uses a feather-pen and an inkpot. Naturally, he loves literature (poetry in particular), music (his tastes range from classical to heavy metal), and horror films. Though perpetually penniless, he does not seem to be interested in money. In fact, the usual first piece of advice he gives to numerous clients who have found themselves in his study over the years is to go to a psychiatrist or psychologist. He does not believe in coincidences.

He is also a hopeless romantic who loves and loses a new woman in nearly every issue. In fact, in a majority of his cases, his clients are women, with whom he often has a sexual relationship.

==Setting==
The series is mainly set in London, where the protagonist lives, though he occasionally travels elsewhere, such as imaginary realms such as &quot;La zona del crepuscolo&quot; (Twilight Zone). His address is 7 Craven Road, London, in reference to director Wes Craven.

The Cafe at 7 Craven Road, Paddington, London, was renamed Cafe Dylan Dog in 2013. In 2012, the cafe offered &quot;Dylan Dog Meal&quot; with beef or pork included, even though Dylan himself is a vegetarian.

==Supporting characters==

* Inspector Bloch, Dylan&#x27;s superior when he worked at Scotland Yard, remained his friend and father figure even after our hero quit the force. Bloch and Dylan often help out in each other&#x27;s cases. Bloch is more rational and grounded than Dylan and often disregards supernatural explanations. He is an old but competent officer who dreams of retirement. Though Dylan causes enough trouble on his own, Bloch is also plagued by his hapless underling, Jenkins, whom he constantly threatens to sentence to a life of directing traffic. His graphic representation was inspired by English actor Robert Morley and is named for crime, horror and science fiction author Robert Bloch.
* Groucho was a Groucho Marx impersonator whose character became his permanent personality. Now he lives and works with Dylan Dog as his professional sidekick. Like his famous namesake, Groucho enjoys cracking puns and women, though he does not share his employer&#x27;s luck with the ladies. Groucho&#x27;s goofy, off-beat personality helps temper Dylan&#x27;s moodiness. He also reminds his boss when their finances are in dire straits (almost always), shows up with a pistol in the nick of time and throws it in Dylan&#x27;s hand right on time, and makes tea. At some point in every issue Groucho makes one or two jokes that annoy Dylan and the person listening to the joke (often a client of Dylan&#x27;s). An example: &quot;...once, I had a dog which could utter its own name. It was named Woof.&quot;
* Lord H.G Wells is an eccentric inventor who helps Dylan in some of his cases. Named after the author H. G. Wells.

==Crossovers==

Some crossover stories combining Dylan Dog with characters from different comics were published, including, with &quot;Martin Mystere&quot;, &quot;Mister No&quot;, &quot;Ken Parker&quot;, &quot;Nathan Never&quot;, and &quot;Dampyr&quot;Rupert Mike.

In October 2019, DC Comics and Sergio Bonelli Editori announced a crossover series between Dylan Dog and Batman. Issue #0 of the crossover, titled &quot;Relazioni pericolose&quot; (&quot;Dangerous liaisons&quot;), script by Roberto Recchioni with art by Gigi Cavenago and Werther Dell&#x27;Edera, was published in December 2019. As well as Batman, the series heavily features John Constantine. It was published in English by DC Comics on 12 March 2024.

==Cultural influence==
Italian author Umberto Eco said: &quot;I can read the Bible, Homer, or &quot;Dylan Dog&quot; for several days without being bored.&quot;

==Sales==

&quot;Dylan Dog&quot; is the second most widely sold comic book in Italy (the first one is another publication of Sergio Bonelli Editore, &quot;Tex&quot;): including both reprints and new stories, it sells over 120,000 copies each month. As of 2017, the series has sold over 60 million copies worldwide.

The series is also published in Croatia by Ludens, in Serbia by Veseli Četvrtak and Expik Publications, in North Macedonia by M-comics, in Denmark by Shadow Zone Media, in the Netherlands by Silvester, in Poland by Tore, in Spain by Aleta Ediciones, in Sweden by Ades Media, in Turkey by Rodeo and Hoz Comics, in Greece by Mamouth Comix, Jemma Press and Mikros Iros Publications and in Mexico by Panini Comics.

==English translation ==
American publisher Dark Horse Comics released an English translation of a selection of &quot;Dylan Dog&quot; stories in 1999. This six-issue miniseries was later completed by a one-shot released in 2002. To avoid legal complications regarding Groucho Marx&#x27;s estate, the art was altered so that Groucho no longer sports the Marx brother&#x27;s signature moustache, and was renamed &quot;Felix&quot;. Every cover in the six-issue mini featured art by American comics artist Mike Mignola.

As of 2016, Epicenter Comics published a new English version of some Dylan Dog stories.

In 2018 and 2019, Sergio Bonelli Editore published a limited English variant edition. DC Comics published the Batman/Dylan Dog crossover series in March 2024.

==Adaptations==
===Films===
====&quot;Cemetery Man&quot;====
In 1994 Italian director Michele Soavi directed the film &quot;Dellamorte Dellamore&quot; (known abroad as &quot;Cemetery Man&quot; or &quot;Of Death and Love&quot;), with a screenplay written by Giovanni Romoli and based on Tiziano Sclavi&#x27;s similarly titled novel.
Francesco Dellamorte (his mother&#x27;s surname was Dellamore) – a sort of Italian alter ego for Dylan Dog – appears for the first time in the third special issue of Dylan Dog, &quot;Orrore nero&quot; (&quot;Black Horror&quot;), released July 1989, in which he met the Nightmare Detective, but Sclavi&#x27;s novel was written before the special issue.

Francesco Dellamorte also appears in a short (comic book) sequel to Orrore nero, entitled &quot;Stelle cadenti&quot; (&quot;Falling stars&quot;), where Dylan, Groucho, Francesco and Gnaghi are walking together during saint Lawrence&#x27;s night, watching shooting stars and talking about life and death.

English actor Rupert Everett, who inspired Dylan Dog&#x27;s design, played the protagonist, Francesco Dellamorte, while Italian model and actress Anna Falchi played the female lead. Although having Everett in the main role, the Dylan Dog character did not appear in the movie.

====&quot;Dylan Dog: Dead of Night&quot;====
Kevin Munroe has directed &quot;Dylan Dog: Dead of Night&quot;, an official American film adaptation of Dylan Dog starring actor Brandon Routh as the title character.

Differences between the comic result in the film being set in New Orleans instead of London, the character of Groucho being replaced by an un-dead sidekick called Marcus due to issues for the production to acquire the rights to use the Groucho Marx name and style, another difference is Dylan Dog&#x27;s Volkswagen Beetle being black with a white hood instead of the opposite like in the comic. The film also appears to be much lighter in tone and more action-oriented, lacking the surreal feeling, the black humour and the melancholy of the comic book, and the Dylan character is portrayed like more of a scientist-adventurer in the vein of Indiana Jones, rather than the romantic loner he is in the comics. Accordingly, Dylan&#x27;s physical appearance changes to that of a muscular action hero rather than the slightly built in the comics.

It was originally going to premiere on Halloween 2010 in Italy but was since pushed back to a 29 April 2011 release. The film has been produced by the independent company Platinum Studios.

===Television series===
A television series based on the comics, produced by James Wan and his production company Atomic Monster, was announced by Sergio Bonelli Editore in August 2018. In December 2022, Wan stated that the series was still in development, and that he was also working with the publishing house to find investors. On 2 June 2023, Michele Masiero, editorial director of Sergio Bonelli Editore, said that the series will be faithful to the comics, and that they were preparing the casting.

<text>The Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment) was a line infantry regiment of the British Army in continuous existence for 283 years. It was known as the 7th Regiment of Foot until the Childers Reforms of 1881.

The regiment served in many wars and conflicts throughout its long existence, including the Second Boer War, the First World War and the Second World War. In 1968, the regiment was amalgamated with the other regiments of the Fusilier Brigade – the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, the Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers and the Lancashire Fusiliers – to form a new large regiment, the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers.

The Royal Fusiliers War Memorial, a monument dedicated to the almost 22,000 Royal Fusiliers who died during the First World War, stands on Holborn in the City of London.

==History==
===Formation===
It was formed as a fusilier regiment in 1685 by George Legge, 1st Baron Dartmouth, from two companies of the Tower of London guard, and was originally called the Ordnance Regiment, later the Royal Regiment of Fuziliers (a variety of spellings of the word &quot;fusilier&quot; persisted until the 1780s, when the modern spelling was formalised). Most regiments were equipped with matchlock muskets at the time, but the Ordnance Regiment were armed with flintlock &quot;fusils&quot;. This was because their task was to be an escort for the artillery, for which matchlocks would have carried the risk of igniting the open-topped barrels of gunpowder. The regiment was also known by the names of its colonels until 1751.

The regiment went to Holland in February 1689 for service in the Nine Years&#x27; War and fought at the Battle of Walcourt in August 1689 before returning home in 1690. It embarked for Flanders later that year and fought at the Battle of Steenkerque in August 1692 and the Battle of Landen in July 1693 and the Siege of Namur in summer 1695 before returning home.

The regiment took part in an expedition which captured the town of Rota in Spain in spring 1702 and then saw action at the Battle of Vigo Bay in October 1702 during the War of the Spanish Succession. The regiment served as Marines aboard Royal Navy ships in 1703 (and again in 1718–18, April 1742 (details only), and 1756–57). 

In 1747 the regiment was known as the Royal English Fuziliers and was given the precedence of 7th in the Infantry of the Line. On 1 July 1751 it was redesignated as the 7th Regiment of Foot (Royal Fusiliers). When county titles were added in August 1782 the subtitle &#x27;(Derbyshire)&#x27; was added, but this was never used and was later given to a different regiment. 

===American War of Independence===
The Royal Fusiliers were sent to Canada in April 1773. The regiment was broken up into detachments that served at Montreal, Quebec, Fort Chambly and Fort St Johns (Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu). In the face of the American invasion of Canada in 1775/76, the 80 man garrison of Fort Chambly attempted to resist a 400-man Rebel force but ultimately had to surrender, losing its regimental colours as a result. The bulk of the regiment was captured when St John&#x27;s fell. A 70-man detachment under the command of Captain Humphrey Owens assisted with the Battle of Quebec in December 1775.

The men taken prisoner during the defence of Canada were exchanged in British held New York City in December 1776. Here, the regiment was rebuilt and garrisoned New York and New Jersey. In October 1777, the 7th participated in the successful assaults on Fort Clinton and Fort Montgomery and the destruction of enemy stores at Continental Village. In late November, 1777 the regiment reinforced the garrison of Philadelphia. During the British evacuation back to New York City, the regiment participated in a diversionary raid in the days leading up to the Battle of Monmouth in June 1778. The 7th participated in Tryon&#x27;s raid in July 1779.

In April 1780, the Royal Fusiliers took part in the capture of Charleston. Once Charleston fell, the regiment helped garrison the city. Three companies were sent to Ninety-Six to assist with the training of Loyalist militia companies. An 80-man detachment also sent to Camden, South Carolina to help build that town&#x27;s defences. The detachments were recalled to Charleston for refitting in late August 1780. They were then mounted and sent to join Charles Cornwallis&#x27;s Army as it advanced towards Charlotte, North Carolina in early September 1780. The 7th, mounted on horses, along with two regiments of Loyalist militia, cleared the region north of Georgetown, South Carolina of partisans while en route. The Royal Fusiliers turned the horses over to Lieutenant Colonel Banastre Tarleton&#x27;s British Legion upon uniting with Cornwallis in late September and then served as the Army&#x27;s rearguard.

Between October 1780 and early January 1781, the regiment, having lost about one third of its officers and men to sickness and disease, protected the communication and supply lines between Camden and Winnsboro, South Carolina. On 7 January 7, 1781, a contingent of 171 men from the Royal Fusiliers was detached from Cornwallis&#x27;s Army and fought under the command of Tarleton at the Battle of Cowpens in January 1781. The Royal Fusiliers were on the left of the line of battle: Tarleton was defeated and the regiment&#x27;s colours were once again captured, stored in the baggage wagons. A 19-man detachment from the regiment fought through North Carolina participating in the Battle of Guilford Court House in March 1781 and ultimately the Siege of Yorktown, where it served with the regiment&#x27;s Light Infantry Company. There was another detachment, composed largely of men recovered from the hospital and recruits, which remained in the South under the command of Lt Col. Alured Clarke: these men remained in garrison in Charleston, until they were transferred to Savannah, Georgia in December 1781. The regiment returned to England in 1783.

===Napoleonic Wars===

The regiment embarked for Holland and saw action at the Battle of Copenhagen in August 1807 during the Gunboat War. It was then sent to the West Indies and took part in the capture of Martinique in 1809. It embarked for Portugal later that year for service in the Peninsular War and fought at the Battle of Talavera in July 1809, the Battle of Bussaco in September 1810. and the Battle of Albuera in May 1811.

The regiment then took part in the Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo in January 1812, the Siege of Badajoz in spring 1812 and the Battle of Salamanca in July 1812 as well as the Battle of Vitoria in June 1813. It then pursued the French Army into France and fought at the Battle of the Pyrenees in July 1813, the Battle of Orthez in February 1814 and the Battle of Toulouse in April 1814. It returned to England later that year before embarking for Canada and seeing action at the capture of Fort Bowyer in February 1815 during the War of 1812.

A 2nd Battalion was formed in 1804 and also took part in the Peninsular Campaign from 1809 to 1811. Both battalions took part in the 1811 Battle of Albuera. The 2nd Battalion was disbanded after the war.

===Victorian and Edwardian eras===
The single-battalion Regiment embarked for Scutari for service in the Crimean War on 5 April 1854 (with the Depot at Winchester), and saw action at the Battle of Alma in September 1854, the Battle of Inkerman in November 1854 and the Siege of Sebastopol in winter 1854. It returned to Britain from the Crimea on 27 June 1856, embarked for India on 21 July 1857, and took part in the Ambela Campaign in 1863. In 1865 it was at Ferozepore. It returned to Britain from India on the 27 December 1870. It embarked for Gibraltar in 1885, and in 1886 and 1887 was at Egypt. From 1888 &#x27;til 1901, it was posted to various locations in India, including Poona, Karachi (now in Pakistan), Mhow, Nusseerabad, Bombay, Quetta, Bengal, Neemuch, and Nusserabad.

The newly re-formed 2nd battalion, which had been at Preston, embarked for Gibraltar on 27 May 1858 (the Depot at this point was at Chatham, moving to Walmer). It was deployed from Malta to Upper Canada in October 1866 and helped suppress the Fenian raids and then embarked for India on 1 October 1873, and saw action at the Battle of Kandahar in September 1880 during the Second Anglo-Afghan War. It was subsequently stationed at various locations in India, including Cannanore, Madras, Wellington, before returning to Britain from India on 29 March 1889, when it was posted to Dover. In 1892 it moved to Woolwich. In 1894 it was posted to Guernsey, and in 1896 to Belfast, Ireland. In 1898 it moved to the Curragh, Ireland.
The regiment was not fundamentally affected by the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, which gave it a depot at Hounslow Barracks from 1873, or by the Childers reforms of 1881 – as it already possessed two battalions, there was no need for it to amalgamate with another regiment. Under the reforms, the regiment became The Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment) on 1 July 1881. The regiment was now organised into the following:

Regulars

* 1st Battalion, in 1881 based at Defensible Barracks, Pembroke Dock
* 2nd Battalion, in 1881 based in Madras

Militia

* 3rd (later 5th) (Militia) Battalion based in Brentford, formerly 3rd Royal Westminster Middlesex Militia
* 4th (later 6th) (Militia) Battalion based in Finsbury, formerly Royal London Militia
* 5th (later 7th) (Militia) Battalion based in Hounslow, formerly 4th Royal South Middlesex Militia

Volunteer Infantry

* 10th Middlesex Rifle Volunteer Corps based in Bloomsbury, formerly under command of The King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps, but transferred in 1883, and subsequently renamed as 1st Volunteer Btn
* 23rd Middlesex Rifle Volunteer Corps based in Westminster renamed 2nd Volunteer Btn in 1883

In 1901 the 1st Battalion moved from India to Mandalay, Burma.

The regiment&#x27;s 2nd regular battalion took part in the Second Boer War from 1899 to 1902. The battalion, which had previously been stationed the Curragh in Ireland, embarked for South Africa on the 22 October 1899, and served there throughout the war, which ended with the Peace of Vereeniging in June 1902. Four months later 350 officers and men of the 2nd battalion left Cape Town on the SS &quot;Salamis&quot; in late September 1902, arriving at Southampton in late October, when the battalion was posted to Aldershot.

A 3rd regular battalion was formed on 6 April 1898 at Dover and embarked for the Imperial fortress of Malta on 1 December 1898, then moved to Crete, the Imperial fortress of Gibraltar in 1900, and Egypt and Sudan in 1901. It was subsequently posted to the Bermuda Garrison, with 16 officers, 1 warrant officer, and 937 NCOs and men arriving at the Imperial fortress of Bermuda under Lieutenant-Colonel R. B. Gaisford, CMG, from Egypt aboard the , and Majors CJ Stanton, FMF Scoones, Lieutenant F. Moore, and Second-Lieutenant GE Hawes arriving aboard the SS Dominion, in the week ending Saturday, 5 December 1903. the battalion replaced the Royal Warwickshire Regiment at Boaz Island, and departed Bermuda again for Cape Town, South Africa, aboard the HMT Soudan on the 18 December 1905 (minus Private David FW Dobson, absent without leave). The battalion was in South Africa and Mauritius until the First World War.

A 4th regular battalion was formed on 31 February 1900 at Dover, and received colours from the Prince of Wales (Colonel-in-Chief of the regiment) in July 1902. In 1903 it was at Woolwich.

In 1908, the Volunteers and Militia were reorganised nationally, with the former becoming the Territorial Force and the latter the Special Reserve. The Royal Fusiliers&#x27; 1st to 4th Volunteer Battalions were transferred to the new all-territorial London Regiment, with the Royal Fusiliers itself now consisting of: 

Regulars

* 1st Battalion in 1908 based at Albany Barracks, thereafter sent to Kinsale.
* 2nd Battalion in 1908 based in Jubbulpore
* 3rd Battalion formed in 1898, in 1908 based in Mauritius and South Africa, thereafter sent to Meerut.
* 4th Battalion formed in 1900, in 1908 based at Columb Barracks. Thereafter sent to Aldershot, then garrisoned Albany Barracks at Parkhurst from 27 January 1913.

Special Reserve

* 5th (Reserve) Battalion, based in Hounslow, former 5th (Militia) Battalion
* 6th (Reserve) Battalion, based in Hounslow, former 7th (Militia) Battalion
* 7th (Extra Reserve) Battalion, based in Finsbury, former 6th (Militia) Battalion

Members of the Battalion won the first two Victoria Crosses of the war near Mons in August 1914 (Lieutenant Maurice Dease and Private Sidney Godley).

====New Armies====

The 8th and 9th (Service) Battalions landed in France; they both saw action on the Western Front as part of the 36th Brigade of the 12th (Eastern) Division. The 10th (Service) Battalion, better known as the Stockbrokers&#x27; Battalion, was formed in August 1914 when 1,600 members of the London Stock Exchange and others from the area joined up: 742 were killed or missing in action on the Western Front. The battalion was originally part of the 54th Brigade of the 18th (Eastern) Division, transferring to the 111th Brigade, 37th Division. The 11th, 12th, 13th and 17th (Service) Battalions landed in France; all four battalions saw action on the Western Front: the 11th Battalion being part of the 54th Brigade, 18th (Eastern) Division, the 12th with the 73rd Brigade, later the 17th Brigade, 24th Division, the 13th with the 111th Brigade, 37th Division and the 17th with the 99th Brigade, 33rd Division, later transferring to the 5th and 6th Brigades of the 2nd Division.

The 18th–21st (Service) Battalions (1st–4th Public Schools) of the regiment were recruited from public schools; all four battalions saw action on the Western Front, all originally serving with the 98th Brigade in the 33rd Division, the 18th and 20th Battalions transferring to the 19th Brigade in the same division. The 22nd (Service) Battalion, which was recruited from the citizens of Kensington, also landed in France and saw action on the Western Front. The 23rd and 24th (Service) Battalion, better known as the Sportsmen&#x27;s Battalions, also landed in France and saw action on the Western Front: they were among the Pals battalions and were both part of the 99th Brigade of the 33rd Division, later transferring to command of the 2nd Division, with the 24th Battalion joining the 5th Brigade in the same division. The 25th (Frontiersmen) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers, formed in February 1915, served in East Africa.

The 26th (Service) Battalion was recruited from the banking community; it saw action on the Western Front as part of the 124th Brigade of the 41st Division. The 32nd (Service) Battalion, which was recruited from the citizens of East Ham, also landed in France and saw action on the Western Front as part of the 124th Brigade of the 41st Division. The 38th through 42nd Battalions of the regiment served as the Jewish Legion in Palestine; many of its surviving members went on to be part of the founding of the State of Israel in 1948. The Royal Fusiliers War Memorial, stands on High Holborn, near Chancery Lane Underground station, surmounted by the lifesize statue of a First World War soldier, and its regimental chapel is at St Sepulchre-without-Newgate.

===Russian Civil War===

The 45th and 46th Battalions of the Royal Fusiliers were part of the North Russia Relief Force, which landed in early 1919 to support the withdrawal of international forces assisting &quot;White&quot; (anti-Bolshevik) Russian forces during the Russian Civil War. The understrength 45th Battalion was composed mainly of former members of the Australian Imperial Force – many of them veterans of the Western Front – who had volunteered for service in Russia.

===Interwar===
The 3rd and 4th Battalions were disbanded at Aldershot on 15 July 1922. The London Regiment having fallen into abeyance, the 1st–4th Londons reverted to their Royal Fusiluers affiliation. When the London Regiment was formally abolished they became the 8th (1st City of London), 9th (2nd City of London) and 10th (3rd City of London) Battalions (the 4th Londons had already been converted into 60th (City of London) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery). In the period of rearmament before the outbreak of World War II, the 8th and 9th Battalions each formed a duplicate battalion (11th and 12th respectively) while 10th Battalion was converted into 69th (3rd City of London) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery.

===Second World War===

For most of the Second World War, the 1st Battalion was part of the 17th Indian Infantry Brigade, 8th Indian Infantry Division. It served with them in the Italian Campaign.

The 2nd Battalion was attached to the 12th Infantry Brigade, 4th Infantry Division and was sent to France in 1939 after the outbreak of war to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). In May 1940, it fought in the Battle of France and was forced to retreat to Dunkirk, where it was then evacuated from France. With the brigade and division, the battalion spent the next two years in the United Kingdom, before being sent overseas to fight in the Tunisia Campaign, part of the final stages of the North African Campaign. Alongside the 1st, 8th and 9th battalions, the 2nd Battalion also saw active service in the Italian Campaign from March 1944, in particular during the Battle of Monte Cassino, fighting later on the Gothic Line before being airlifted to fight in the Greek Civil War.

The 8th and 9th Battalions, the two Territorial Army (TA) units, were part of the 1st London Infantry Brigade, attached to 1st London Infantry Division. These later became the 167th (London) Infantry Brigade and 56th (London) Infantry Division. Both battalions saw service in the final stages of the Tunisian campaign, where each suffered over 100 casualties in their first battle. In September 1943, both battalions were heavily involved in the landings at Salerno, as part of the Allied invasion of Italy, later crossing the Volturno Line, before, in December, being held up at the Winter Line. Both battalions then fought in the Battle of Monte Cassino and were sent to the Anzio beachhead in February 1944.

The duplicate TA battalions, the 11th and 12th, were both assigned to 4th London Infantry Brigade, part of 2nd London Infantry Division, later 140th (London) Infantry Brigade and 47th (London) Infantry Division respectively. Both battalions remained in the United Kingdom on home defence duties. In 1943, the 12th Battalion was transferred to the 80th Infantry (Reserve) Division and later to the 47th Infantry (Reserve) Division.

The regiment raised many other battalions during the war, although none of them saw active service overseas in their original roles, instead some were converted. The 20th Battalion, for example, formed soon after the Dunkirk evacuation, was sent to India in the summer of 1942 and later became part of the 52nd Infantry Brigade, acting in a training capacity to train British troops in jungle warfare for service in the Burma Campaign. The 21st and 23rd Battalions, also created in June/July 1940, were later converted into 54th and 46th Battalions, Reconnaissance Corps, assigned to the 54th (East Anglian) and 46th Infantry Divisions respectively; the 54th later formed the bulk of 15th Scottish Reconnaissance Regiment, while the 46th servied with its parent division for the rest of the war. 14th (Overseas Defence) and 22nd Battalions became 107th Light Anti-Aircraft and 94th Anti-Tank Regiments respectively of the Royal Artillery.

===Korean War===
In August 1952, the regiment, now reduced to a single Regular battalion, served in the Korean War as part of the 28th Commonwealth Infantry Brigade. A 19-year-old Michael Caine served with the battalion during the conflict; on several occasions his unit had to defend itself from Chinese human wave attacks.

===Amalgamation ===
On 23 April 1968, the regiment was merged with the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers (5th Foot), the Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers (6th Foot) and the Lancashire Fusiliers (20th Foot) to form the 3rd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Fusiliers.

The Fusilier Museum is located in the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers Headquarters at HM Tower of London. It also represents World War One soldiers of six London Regiment battalions (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 29th and 30th) which had been attached to the Royal Fusiliers prior to 1908.

<text>The Special Forces Tab is a service school qualification tab of the United States Army, awarded to any soldier completing the Special Forces Qualification Course at the U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School, Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Soldiers who are awarded the Special Forces Tab are authorized to wear it, as well as the green beret for the remainder of their military careers, even when not serving in a Special Forces command.

Because it is longer than the other qualification tabs, it is called the &quot;long tab&quot;. Personnel who have earned it are nicknamed &quot;long tabbers&quot;.

==Description and history==
The Special Forces Tab was created in 1983 and is an embroidered quadrant patch worn on the upper left sleeve of a military uniform. The cloth tab is 3 inches wide, 3/4-inch high, and is teal blue with gold-yellow embroidered letters. A metal Special Forces Badge is authorized for wear on mess/dress (1&quot; wide) and class-B uniforms (1&quot; wide). The metal badge is teal blue with a gold edge and gold letters.

At the time of its creation, the Special Forces Tab was retroactively awarded to any Army soldiers previously Special Forces-qualified. In addition, as set forth in Army regulations, veterans of certain categories of former wartime service are also eligible for retroactive awards of the tab. Among these are:

* Personnel who served with a Special Forces unit during wartime between 1942 and 1973 and were either unable to or not required to attend a formal program of instruction but were awarded the proper Special Qualification Identifier by a competent authority. U.S. Army Warrant Officers are excluded.
* Personnel with at least 120 days&#x27; wartime service prior to 1955 in certain units, including the 1st Special Service Force, OSS Detachment 101, OSS Jedburgh teams, OSS Operational Groups, and the Sixth Army Special Reconnaissance Unit (&quot;Alamo Scouts&quot;) and 8240th Army Unit.
* Officer or Enlisted personnel of rank O-3 and below awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge or Combat Medical Badge while serving at least 120 consecutive days between 1955 and 1975 in a Special Forces Operational Detachment-Alpha (A-Team), Mobile Strike Force, SF Reconnaissance Team or SF Special Project Unit. Does not apply to U.S. Army Warrant Officers. 
Before the creation of the Special Forces Tab, Special Forces qualification was indicated by wearing a full-size unit specific beret flash on their green beret. A support soldier (such as military intelligence, signals, parachute riggers, vehicle mechanics, etc.) assigned to a Special Forces unit wore a 1/4&quot; high recognition bar (nicknamed a &quot;half flash,&quot; &quot;striker bar,&quot; or &quot;candy stripe&quot;) below the Special Forces Distinctive Unit Insignia (DUI), officer rank insignia, or chaplain branch insignia on their green beret. The bar was designed to matched the colors and design of their unit&#x27;s full-size beret flash. After the creation of the tab in 1983 and until January 1993, all personnel in a Special Forces unit wore the same beret and beret flash. Today, only Special Forces-qualified soldiers wear the green beret with support soldiers wearing maroon berets, making the need for the recognition bar moot.

==Award Eligibility==

* 1) Basic Eligibility Criteria. Any person meeting one of the criteria below may be awarded the Special Forces (SF) tab:
** 1.1)Successful completion of U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School (SWCS) approved Active Army (AA) institutional training leading to SF qualification.

<text>Gordon Maclean Williams (20 June 1934 – 20 August 2017) was a British author of more than 20 novels. He also worked as a ghostwriter and a scriptwriter for films.

==Biography==
Born in Paisley, Renfrewshire, Williams was the son of a police constable who had moved south from Aberdeenshire. He was educated at the John Neilson Institution, leaving aged 16 to become a cub reporter for the &quot;Johnstone Advertiser&quot;. Following national service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) in Germany, he moved to London to work as a journalist. He wrote for television and was the author of several novels, including &quot;From Scenes Like These&quot; (1968), shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1969, &quot;Walk Don&#x27;t Walk&quot; (1972) and &quot;Big Morning Blues&quot; (1974). Other early novels include &quot;The Camp&quot; (1966), &quot;The Man Who Had Power Over Women&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Upper Pleasure Garden&quot; (1970).

He was a ghostwriter for the autobiographies of association footballers Bobby Moore, Terry Venables and manager Tommy Docherty.

Williams&#x27; experiences in the RAF informed his second published novel, &quot;The Camp&quot;. In 1971, his novel &quot;The Siege of Trencher&#x27;s Farm&quot; was controversially filmed as &quot;Straw Dogs&quot;. Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s cinematic treatment marked a watershed in the depiction of sexual violence in the cinema though the most controversial scenes are absent from the book. Other film work includes &quot;The Man Who Had Power Over Women&quot;, from his own novel, and &quot;Tree of Hands&quot;, as scriptwriter from a Ruth Rendell novel. Williams also wrote the book of Ridley Scott&#x27;s film &quot;The Duellists&quot;.

In 1976, film producer Harry Saltzman employed Williams to rewrite the script for &quot;The Micronauts&quot;. Although the film was never made, Williams&#x27; novelisation was published in 1977; he subsequently wrote two sequels.

While working as commercial manager of association football club Chelsea, he renewed his collaboration with Venables, resulting in four co-written novels. From the novels grew the 1978 TV series &quot;Hazell&quot;, which the pair co-wrote under the shared pseudonym P. B. Yuill. Under the name Jack Lang, Williams also wrote paperbacks &quot;for £300 a time&quot;.

Williams declined director Bill Forsyth&#x27;s invitation to write the script for the 1981 film &quot;Gregory&#x27;s Girl&quot;.

He died on 20 August 2017 at the age of 83.

<doc id="812442" wikidata="Q4720156" url="?curid=812442" title="Alexander Stewart Herschel">
<text>Alexander Stewart Herschel, DCL, FRS (5 February 1836 – 18 June 1907) was a British astronomer.

Although much less well known than his grandfather William Herschel or his father John Herschel, he did pioneering work in meteor spectroscopy. He also worked on identifying comets as the source of meteor showers. The Herschel graph, the smallest non-Hamiltonian polyhedral graph, is named after Herschel due to his pioneering work on Hamilton&#x27;s Icosian game.

==Early life and education==
The second son and fifth child of Sir John and Lady Margaret Herschel&#x27;s twelve children, Herschel was born on 5 February 1836 at Feldhausen, near Cape Town, South Africa, where they had been since 1834 for John&#x27;s astronomical work. His older brother was Sir William Herschel, 2nd Baronet, and his younger brother John Herschel the Younger was born in 1837. The family left for England on 11 March 1838, returning a few weeks before Queen Victoria&#x27;s coronation.

After some private education, Alexander was sent to Clapham Grammar School in London in 1851, of which Charles Pritchard, who would later become Savilian Professor of Astronomy, was headmaster. In 1855, he proceeded to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. as twentieth wrangler in 1859, proceeding M.A. in 1877. While an undergraduate he helped James Clerk Maxwell with his illustrations of the mechanics of rotation by means of the apparatus known as &quot;the devil on two sticks.&quot; From Cambridge Herschel passed in 1861 to the Royal School of Mines in London, and began the observation of meteors which he continued to the end of his life. He early wrote, chiefly on meteorological subjects, papers for the British Meteorological Society, and between 1863 and 1867, he contributed many articles to the &quot;Intellectual Observer&quot;.

==Career==
From 1866 to 1871, Herschel was lecturer on natural philosophy, and professor of mechanical and experimental physics in the Andersonian University of Glasgow. From 1871 to 1886, he was the first professor of physics and experimental philosophy in the University of Durham College of Science, Newcastle upon Tyne. At the Durham College, Herschel provided, chiefly by his personal exertions, apparatuses for the newly installed laboratory, some being made by his own hands. When the college migrated as Armstrong College to new buildings, the new Herschel Physical Laboratory was named after him.

Herschel made accurate records of his observations of shooting stars in a long series of manuscript notebooks. He also accomplished important work in the summation, reduction, and discussion of the results of other observers with whom he corresponded in all parts of the world. With Robert P. Greg he formed extensive catalogues of the radiant points of meteor streams, the more important of these being published in the &quot;Reports&quot; of the British Association for 1868, 1872, and 1874. A table of the radiant points of comets computed by Herschel alone is in the &quot;Report&quot; for 1875. He was reporter to the committee of the British Association on the &#x27;observations of luminous meteors,&#x27; and from 1862 to 1881 drew up annually complete reports of the large meteors observed, and of the progress of meteoric science. For the British Association (1874–81) he prepared reports of a committee, consisting of himself, his colleague at Newcastle, George A. Lebour, and John T. Dunn, which was formed to determine the thermal conductivities of certain rocks. For the &quot;Monthly Notices&quot; of the Royal Astronomical Society, he prepared the annual reports on meteoric astronomy each February from 1872 to 1880 and contributed many other important papers to the &quot;Notices&quot;. In a June 1872 paper, he showed the connection between meteors (the Andromedids) and comets (Biela&#x27;s Comet), and he predicted the shower which recurred on 27 November of that year. Herschel acquired great precision in noting the paths of meteors among the stars. From his determination of the radiant point of the November Leonids, Giovanni Schiaparelli deduced the identity of their orbit with that of Tempel&#x27;s Comet of 1866, 55P/Tempel–Tuttle. In 1864 and 1873 he observed the bright green colour of two respective Geminid meteors.

Besides meteoric astronomy, Herschel was interested in many branches of physical science, and became a member of the Physical Society of London in 1889 and of the Society of Arts in 1892. He contributed frequently to &quot;Nature,&quot; an article on &quot;The Matter of Space&quot; in 1883 being specially noteworthy. He worked much at photography, and in 1893 the Amateur Photographic Association presented an enlarged carbon print portrait of Alexander Herschel to the South Kensington Museum for the British Museum Portrait Gallery.

Herschel became fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1867, and on 12 June 1884 was elected Fellow of the Royal Society, an honour already conferred on his grandfather, his father, and his younger brother John. In 1886, he gave up his professorship, and was made Doctor of Civil Law of Durham University. In 1888, with other members of his family, he reoccupied the house in Slough, now called Observatory House, where his grandfather, Sir William Herschel, had lived. Here he resided until his death, absorbed in study, but late in life he made a journey to Spain to observe the solar eclipse of 1905.

==Death==

He died unmarried at Observatory House on 18 June 1907 and was buried in Church of St Laurence, Upton-cum-Chalvey, in the chancel of which his grandfather lies.

<doc id="812443" wikidata="Q4908501" url="?curid=812443" title="Bill Clinton 1992 presidential campaign">
<text>The 1992 presidential campaign of Bill Clinton, the then-governor of Arkansas, was announced on October 3, 1991, at the Old State House in Little Rock, Arkansas. After winning a majority of delegates in the Democratic primaries of 1992, the campaign announced that then-junior U.S. senator from Tennessee, Al Gore, would be Clinton&#x27;s running mate. The Clinton–Gore ticket defeated Republican incumbent President George H. W. Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle in the presidential election on November 3, 1992, and took office as the 42nd president and 45th vice president, respectively, on January 20, 1993.

==Candidate background==
Bill Clinton was the governor of a traditionally conservative Southern state, Arkansas. He had been viewed as a viable presidential candidate before his actual bid in 1992. During the 1988 Democratic Party presidential primaries, where George H. W. Bush, the incumbent vice president, seemed all but inevitable as the president, many turned to Clinton as the next Southern leader of the party. Clinton was seen as a potential candidate as he was a popular Democratic governor in a state that had voted for Republicans in four of the last five presidential elections. Breaking with the traditional left wing platform of the Democratic Party, Clinton espoused the ideas of the Third Way. A former chairman of the DLC, he ran as a New Democrat.

==Timeline==
===Primaries===
In the wake of President George H.W. Bush&#x27;s sky-high approval ratings after Operation Desert Storm, American media gave the Democratic Party little chance of winning the presidency in 1992. Early Democratic front-runners included Bill Bradley, a New Jersey senator; Jesse Jackson, who finished second in 1988; Dick Gephardt, a Missouri representative and then House Majority Leader; Al Gore, then a senator from Tennessee; and Jay Rockefeller, a senator from West Virginia. But each bowed out early; neither Bradley nor Rockefeller considered themselves ready to run, Gephardt seemed to accept Bush&#x27;s re-election as a sure thing, and Gore had opted to spend more time with his family in the wake of a tragic accident that threatened the life of his young son. The most notable front-runner, Mario Cuomo, decided not to run on December 20, 1991, the final day to apply to run in the New Hampshire primary.

In the lead-up to the 1992 New Hampshire Democratic primary, the Clinton campaign was rocked by scandal when Gennifer Flowers accused Clinton of having a 12-year sexual affair. At the same time, Clinton was accused of misleading the U.S. Army Reserve to avoid service in the Vietnam War. Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton addressed the sexual misconduct allegations in an interview by Steve Kroft on an episode of &quot;60 Minutes&quot; aired after the Super Bowl XXVI. Although at that time the Clintons denied an affair, they admitted to have known Flowers and Bill admitted that he had caused problems in their marriage. Although Clinton lost to Paul Tsongas in the New Hampshire primary and suffered from persistent criticism over his character for the rest of the election, he won the Super Tuesday primaries. He ultimately secured the Democratic nomination after winning primaries in Illinois and Michigan, earning him the nickname &quot;The Comeback Kid.&quot; At the same time, Bush&#x27;s lead waned due to his administration&#x27;s handling of the early 1990s recession and the 1992 Los Angeles riots.

=== &quot;Arsenio Hall Show&quot; appearance ===
Clinton was a guest on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; on Wednesday June 3, 1992, the day after he secured the Democratic Party nomination. He played &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; on the saxophone. The appearance is often considered an important moment in Clinton&#x27;s political career, helping build his popularity amongst minority and young voters. Clinton&#x27;s appearance on the show and subsequent media coverage of it, catapulted him ahead of Bush in the polls.

===Running mate selection===

In June and July 1992, speculation grew about who Clinton was going to pick as his running mate. Possible candidates included Kerrey, Indiana congressman Lee Hamilton, Missouri congressman Dick Gephardt, Tennessee senator Al Gore, New Jersey senator Bill Bradley, Florida senator Bob Graham and Pennsylvania senator Harris Wofford. On July 9, 1992, Clinton selected Gore as his running mate in the Arkansas State Mansion at Little Rock.

===Convention===

During the 1992 Democratic Convention, the convention hall was plagued by the fact that independent candidate Ross Perot was tied with or beating Clinton in opinion research polls. This caused a moderate turn of events at the convention to win back Perot voters from the Perot campaign. This led to the selection of such speakers such as Representative Barbara Jordan from Texas to deliver a bipartisan keynote address to the convention delegates. Also speaking was the vice-presidential nominee Al Gore who appealed to the center as he was, at the time, a Southern moderate Democrat from Tennessee.

However, on the last day the convention convened on July 16, 1992, Ross Perot dropped out of the presidential race and left a gap for both Bush and Clinton to scramble for newly undecided voters. This greatly led to the advantage of Bill Clinton who gave his nomination acceptance speech that night.

===Election night===
Throughout election night, Clinton over performed in rural areas of the country such as in the mountain west, winning Montana, Colorado, and New Mexico (16 electoral votes). Clinton also won rural voters in the south and mid-west, carrying states such as Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, Louisiana, Georgia, and Iowa (57 electoral votes).

==Campaign strategy==
===The Southern lock===
A source of frustration for Democrats after the adoption of Richard Nixon&#x27;s Southern strategy was the increasing Republican lock on the electoral votes of the Southern United States. Clinton&#x27;s home of Arkansas gave Democrats hope that they could carry some Southern states and ultimately win the election. Clinton then made what even his opponents acknowledged was a master stroke by choosing Al Gore, a senator from Tennessee, as his running mate. This choice blunted a major strategy of the Bush campaign to paint Clinton and Gore as &#x27;Northern liberals&#x27; in the mold of previous candidates George McGovern, Walter Mondale, Michael Dukakis, and, to a lesser extent, Hubert Humphrey. Additionally, Gore&#x27;s prior military record removed much of the criticism Clinton had received earlier.

Besides Gore, several names were rumored to be in contention for the second spot, including Florida senator and former governor of Florida Bob Graham, Indiana congressman Lee H. Hamilton, Nebraska senator and former governor Bob Kerrey, Iowa senator Tom Harkin, and newly elected Pennsylvania senator Harris Wofford.

=== Courting white voters ===
According to Princeton politics professor Paul Frymer, Clinton&#x27;s campaign successfully exploited the &quot;Democratic capture&quot; of African American votes to the detriment of African Americans. Frymer argues that the open hostility of the Republican Party towards minorities allowed Clinton to pursue the votes of white &quot;Reagan Democrats&quot; with sub-textually racist messages without losing support among the African American community.

One way in which Clinton courted white votes was by associating closely with the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), an organization created by southern conservative Democrats with the intent to bring white voters back to the Democratic party after the failure of the Mondale campaign in 1984. To that end, the DLC adopted Republican positions on race-related issues like crime, welfare, and affirmative action. Clinton served as the DLC national chairman from 1990 to 1991, and he aligned his rhetoric closely with that of the DLC during his campaign. For example, he advocated to &quot;end welfare as we know it&quot; and failed to mention race at all in his campaign book &quot;Putting People First&quot;, except while denouncing racial quotas.

Clinton, while serving as governor of Arkansas, refused to pardon a brain-damaged black man on death row named Rickey Ray Rector who had been convicted of killing a police officer. This was a widely publicized event that may have been influenced by Clinton&#x27;s desire to not be painted &quot;soft on crime,&quot; as failed Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis had been by the notorious Willie Horton ad.

Clinton also visited the Stone Mountain Correctional Facility in Georgia shortly before Super Tuesday to promote his &quot;tough on crime&quot; message. The location of the prison, Stone Mountain, Georgia is notable for its ties to white supremacist movements. Stone Mountain was the birthplace of the second rendition of the KKK and was a &quot;white supremacist mecca.&quot; It is home to Stone Mountain Park which features a massive monument to the Confederacy carved onto the face of Stone Mountain. Clinton&#x27;s press conference at the prison was organized to have a group of inmates, mostly black, present in the background. The image of &quot;white political leaders in business suits in front of subjugated black male prisoners in jumpsuits&quot; conveyed a message summed up by another contender for the Democratic nomination, former California governor Jerry Brown: &quot;Two white men and forty black prisoners, what&#x27;s he saying? He&#x27;s saying we got &#x27;em under control, folks, don&#x27;t worry.&quot;After the Los Angeles riots of 1992, Clinton attended a summit conference of Jesse Jackson&#x27;s Rainbow Coalition. During Clinton&#x27;s speech, Clinton strongly criticized Jackson, who was sitting next to Clinton, for hosting Sister Souljah at the event. Clinton claimed that the comments Sister Souljah made were anti-white. The shocking denunciation was carried extensively by the media and gave Clinton&#x27;s campaign a boost at a time when he was trailing Bush and Perot. Mary Matalin, Bush&#x27;s campaign director, called Clinton&#x27;s speech &quot;a stroke of genius&quot; by dealing with &quot;the Jesse Jackson factor&quot; by &quot;publicly humilat[ing] him.&quot;

===President Bush&#x27;s approval ratings===
For most of 1991, the incumbent president, George H.W. Bush, was extremely popular after the Persian Gulf War, with approval rating at times reaching as high as 90 percent. That war had helped erase the Vietnam Syndrome America had felt since the 1960s, restoring confidence in the country&#x27;s ability to assert itself militarily abroad. But because of a growing public perception of an economic downturn, Bush&#x27;s popularity began falling throughout late 1991, and by February 1992, his approval rating fell below 40%. Bush&#x27;s approval would stay low for the rest of the campaign season.

===Reasons for victory===
Clinton&#x27;s charisma, combined with a talented campaign staff and skilled campaign strategy, led to victory. Organizational theorists have proposed that his campaign structure adopted an effective blend of informality with clear goal definition, which allowed for structured creativity. There was also the Ross Perot factor, as he took many votes from the angry base due to Bush&#x27;s breaking of the no tax pledge. Bill Clinton also focused on the economy in 1992 due to the recession and ran on school choice, balanced budget amendment, opposition to illegal immigration and support for NAFTA.

<text>Joaquim Carvalho Cruz (born 12 March 1963) is a Brazilian former middle-distance runner, winner of the 800 meters at the 1984 Summer Olympics. He is one of only ten men, and in August 1984 became the second man, to run the 800 metres in less than 1 minute 42 seconds.

==Biography==
Joaquim Cruz was born in Taguatinga, Federal District. The son of a steel worker, he began running as a 13-year-old, and showed great promise as a junior. At the age of 15 his personal best over 800 m stood at 1:51 min. After setting a junior world record of 1:44.3 min in 1981, he received a scholarship for the University of Oregon in 1983. The move immediately paid off, and Cruz won the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championships over 800 m that same year. He also competed in the inaugural World Championships in 1983, winning the bronze.

The following year at the 1984 NCAA Track and Field Championships, Cruz became one of only a handful of people to win the 800/1500 m double (a feat that would not be repeated until Andrew Wheating achieved it in 2010). Cruz is the co-holder of University of Oregon 1,500 m school record of 3:36.48 along with A.J. Acosta. Later that summer, he ran a time of 2:14.09 min over 1000 m in Nice which is still the current South American record over that distance.

The 1984 Summer Olympic Games were held in Los Angeles, and Cruz was considered to be one of the 800 m favorites, along with world record holder Sebastian Coe of Great Britain. In the last turn of the 800 meter final, Cruz started a sprint from second place and took the lead, never losing it. He crossed the line in 1:43.00, breaking Alberto Juantorena&#x27;s Olympic Record and making him the first Brazilian Olympic athletics gold medalist since triple jumper Adhemar Ferreira da Silva won both in 1952 and 1956.

Later that week, after winning his first round heat of the Olympic 1500 m, Cruz did not start in the semi-finals due to a cold. After recovering from the cold, Cruz had a five-day stretch of racing a few weeks after the Olympic Games in which he set several extremely fast times. First, he ran a new Brazilian 800 m record of 1:42.34 at the Weltklasse meet in Zurich, becoming only the second runner in history to break 1:43. Two days later he ran a 1:42.41 at the Memorial Van Damme meet in Brussels, and then two days after that, at a meeting in Cologne, Cruz ran the second fastest 800 meters in history at the time, his time of 1:41.77 being only four hundredths of a second outside Coe&#x27;s world record from June 1981. He is the tenth fastest athlete in the history of the event. By the end of the year, he was the NCAA champion, the Olympic champion, undefeated in all seven of his 800-meter finals, had run the 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 6th fastest 800 meter times in history, and easily ranked as #1 in the world for 800 meters in 1984 by Track &amp; Field News magazine.

In 1985 Cruz won six of his eight 800 meter races, the last three of which were won under 1:43: 1:42.98 at ISTAF, 1:42.53 in Cologne (beating Sebastian Coe), and 1:42.49 in Koblenz. His record was good enough to earn him a World #1 ranking by &quot;Track &amp; Field News&quot; magazine for the second year in a row. He also ran the world&#x27;s 3rd fastest 1,000 meter time for 1985, a 2:15.11. In the following two years he struggled with injuries and raced little, though he did manage to win the gold medal in the 1,500 meters at the 1987 Pan American Games, defeating both Jim Spivey (who within the next month would win a bronze medal at the World Championships) and American mile record holder Steve Scott.

During the 1988 Summer Olympics, Cruz appeared to be on his way to retaining his Olympic 800 m title when he was passed by Kenyan runner Paul Ereng, leaving Cruz with the silver medal. Troubled by Achilles&#x27; tendon injuries, Cruz was never again able to reach the international top level. In 1993, he tried to make a comeback and started over 1500 m at various Grand Prix races in Europe but failed to make a major impact. His last victory of significance came in the 1500 meters at the 1995 Pan American Games. One year later, taking part at his third Olympics at the 1996 Summer Olympics, Cruz was the Brazilian flag-bearer and ran the 1500 meters without reaching the finals.

Cruz competed at the 2001 Masters West Region Track and Field Championship winning the 5000 meter run at age 38.

Cruz was the last torchbearer and lit the flame cauldron at the 2007 Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro, on 13 July 2007. After retiring from competitions he became a running coach at the Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, California. He guides David Brown and Shaquille Vance, among other Paralympic athletics.

<text>Étienne Jérôme Rouchouze SS.CC. (; 1798–1843) was a French Catholic missionary in the Eastern Pacific Ocean (including the Kingdom of Hawaii in the Hawaiian Islands chain, also known as the former Sandwich Islands).

== Biography ==
A member of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, he was appointed by the Holy See Vicar Apostolic and Titular Bishop of Nilopolis from 1833 to 1843 of the Vicariate Apostolic of Oriental Oceania, from which were derived the Archdiocese of Papeete, the Diocese of Honolulu and the Diocese of Taiohae or Tefenuaenata in the Marquesas Islands. As a missionary bishop, Msgr. Rouchouze resided in Valparaíso, Chile and in Honolulu; he was responsible for the evangelization efforts of the Picpus Fathers in the Hawaiian Islands and eastern Pacific. His motto was &quot;Per aspera in astera&quot; (from hardship to the stars).

Prior to his episcopal ministry, Pope Gregory XVI, on 27 November 1825, created the Prefecture Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands. Father Alexis Bachelot was subsequently appointed its first prefect on 3 December 1825.

Msgr. Rouchouze was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Eastern Oceania and Titular Bishop of Nilopolis on 14 June 1833 with ordinary jurisdiction over the Hawai‘i prefecture apostolic. He was subsequently consecrated to the episcopate in Rome, on 22 December 1833 by the Prefect of the &quot;Propaganda Fide&quot;, Cardinal Carlo Maria Pedicini. On 29 June 1834, in Golden Square in London, Msgr. Rouchouze served as principal co-consecrator in the episcopal ordination of Msgr. John Bede Polding, O.S.B., Titular Bishop of Hierocaesarea and Vicar Apostolic elect of New Holland.

Rouchouze left Le Havre on 29 October 1834 and arrived in Valparaíso, Chile on 19 February 1835. After staying a few months, he went on to Mangareva in the Gambier Islands on 9 May 1835. He baptized the island&#x27;s king Maputeoa and his family on 25 August 1836. On 4 April 1839, Msgr. Rouchouze returned to blessed the first stone for the St. Michael&#x27;s Cathedral, Rikitea in Mangareva. He said the first pontifical Mass in the Marquesas at Tahuata on 6 February 1839. He arrived in Honolulu on 14 May 1840.

On 8 December 1842 the ship &quot;Marie-Joseph&quot; was blessed in Saint Malo in Brittany. Shortly thereafter, Msgr. Rouchouze, accompanied by six priests, one sub-deacon, seven lays brothers and ten sisters, left Saint Malo for Oceania on the &quot;Marie-Joseph&quot;. Sister Caliste Le Gris died at sea. Unwilling to bury her at sea, they put into Island of Saint Catherine near Florianópolis in Brazil and buried her there. On 19 February 1843 Rouchouze and his remaining missionaries left the island. Evaristo, a Mangarevan youth, fell ill and also died while they were in Brazil. The ship was last sited off the Falkland Islands on 13 March 1843. Rouchouze and his companions were never seen again and were presumed to have perished at sea.
