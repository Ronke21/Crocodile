<text>Little Joe II was an American rocket used from 1963 to 1966 for five uncrewed tests of the Apollo spacecraft launch escape system (LES), and to verify the performance of the command module parachute recovery system in abort mode. It was named after a similar rocket designed for the same function in Project Mercury. Launched from White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, it was the smallest of four launch rockets used in the Apollo program.

== Background ==

Man-rating of the Apollo launch escape system was planned to be accomplished at minimum cost early in the program. Since there were no reasonably priced launch vehicles with the payload capability and thrust versatility that could meet the requirements of the planned tests, a contract was awarded for the development and construction of a specialized launch vehicle. The rocket&#x27;s predecessor, Little Joe, had been used in testing the launch escape system for the Mercury spacecraft from 1959 to 1960.

The program was originally planned to be conducted at the U.S. Air Force Eastern Test Range at Cape Kennedy, Florida. However, because of a heavy schedule of high-priority launches at that facility, other possible launch sites were evaluated including Wallops Flight Facility, Wallops Island, Virginia, and Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. Launch Complex 36 at White Sands Missile Range, previously used for Redstone missile tests, was selected as the most suitable for meeting schedule and support requirements. White Sands also allowed land recovery which was less costly and complicated than the water recovery that would have been required at the Eastern Test Range or at the NASA Wallops Island facility.

The program was conducted under the direction of the Manned Spacecraft Center (now Johnson Space Center), Houston, Texas, with joint participation by the prime contractors for the launch vehicle (General Dynamics/Convair) and spacecraft (North American Rockwell). The White Sands Missile Range administrative, range, and technical organizations provided the facilities, resources, and services required. These included range safety, radar and camera tracking, command transmission, real-time data displays, photography, telemetry data acquisition, data reduction, and recovery operations.

== Design ==
Little Joe II was a single-stage, solid-propellant rocket which used a booster motor developed for the Recruit rocket, and a sustainer motor developed for the Algol stage of the Scout rocket family. It could fly with a variable number of booster and sustainer motors, but all were contained within a single airframe.

== Development ==
Fabrication of the detail parts for the first vehicle started in August 1962, and the final factory systems checkout was completed in July 1963. There was an original fixed-fin configuration and a later version using flight controls.
The vehicle was sized to match the diameter of the Apollo spacecraft service module and to suit the length of the Algol rocket motors. Aerodynamic fins were sized to assure that the vehicle was inherently stable. The structural design was based on a gross weight of 220,000 pounds (100,000 kg), of which 80,000 pounds (36,000 kg) was payload. The structure was also designed for sequential firing with a possible 10-second overlap of four first-stage and three second-stage sustainer motors. Sustainer thrust was provided by Algol solid-propellant motors. The versatility of performance was achieved by varying the number and firing sequence of the primary motors (capability of up to seven) required to perform the mission. Recruit rocket motors were used for booster motors as required to supplement lift-off thrust.

A simplified design, tooling, and manufacturing concept was used to limit the number of vehicle components, reduce construction time, and hold vehicle cost to a minimum. Because overall weight was not a limiting factor in the design, over designing of primary structural members greatly reduced the number and complexity of structural proof tests. Whenever possible, vehicle systems were designed to use readily available off-the-shelf components that had proven reliability from use in other aerospace programs, and this further reduced overall costs by minimizing the amount of qualification testing required.

The Little Joe II launch vehicle proved to be very acceptable for use in this program. Two difficulties were experienced. The &quot;Qualification Test Vehicle&quot; (QTV) did not destruct when commanded to do so because improperly installed primacord did not propagate the initial detonation to the shaped charges on the Algol motor case. The fourth mission (A-003) launch vehicle became uncontrolled about 2.5 seconds after lift-off when an aerodynamic fin moved to a hard over position as the result of an electronic failure. These problems were corrected and the abort test program was completed.

==Flights==

The Qualification Test Vehicle launch, on 28 August 1963, carried a dummy payload consisting of an aluminum shell in the basic shape of the Apollo command module, with an inert LES attached, and demonstrated the rocket would work for the A-001 launch. This occurred on 13 May 1964, with a boilerplate BP-12 command module, and performed the first successful abort using a live LES. A third launch on 8 December 1964, using BP-23, tested the effectiveness of the LES when the pressures and stresses on the spacecraft were similar to what they would be during a Saturn IB or Saturn V launch. The fourth flight, with BP-22 on 19 May 1965, was designed to test the escape system at a high altitude (although the abort actually occurred at low altitude due to a failure of the Little Joe II booster). The final launch, on 20 January 1966, carried the first production spacecraft, CSM-002.

Minor spacecraft design deficiencies in the parachute reefing cutters, the drogue and main parachute deployment mortar mountings, and the command and service module umbilical cutters were found and corrected before the crewed Apollo flights began. However, all command modules flown achieved satisfactory landing conditions and confirmed that, had they been crewed spacecraft, the crew would have survived the abort conditions.

In addition, two pad abort tests were conducted in which the launch escape system was activated at ground level.

<doc id="806474" wikidata="Q75792" url="?curid=806474" title="Petrashevsky Circle">
<text>The Petrashevsky Circle was a Russian literary discussion group of progressive-minded intellectuals in St. Petersburg in the 1840s. It was organized by Mikhail Petrashevsky, a follower of the French utopian socialist Charles Fourier. Among the members were writers, teachers, students, minor government officials and army officers. While differing in political views, most of them were opponents of the tsarist autocracy and Russian serfdom. Like that of the Lyubomudry group founded earlier in the century, the purpose of the circle was to discuss Western philosophy and literature that was officially banned by the Imperial government of Tsar Nicholas I.
Among those connected to the circle were the writers Dostoevsky and Saltykov-Shchedrin, and the poets Aleksey Pleshcheyev, Apollon Maikov, and Taras Shevchenko.

Nicholas I, alarmed at the prospect of the revolutions of 1848 spreading to Russia, saw great danger in organisations like the Petrashevsky Circle. In 1849, members of the Circle were arrested and imprisoned. A large group of prisoners, Dostoevsky among them, were sent to Semyonov Place for execution. As they stood in the square waiting to be shot, a messenger interrupted the proceedings with notice of a reprieve. As part of a pre-planned intentional deception, the Tsar had prepared a letter to general-adjutant Sumarokov, commuting the death sentences to incarceration. Some of the prisoners were sent to Siberia, others to prisons. Dostoevsky&#x27;s eight-year sentence was later reduced to four years by Nicholas I.

== Origins and activities of the circle ==

In the early 1840s, Petrashevsky had attended Viktor Poroshin&#x27;s lectures on socialist systems at the University of St Petersburg. He was particularly impressed by the utopian ideas of Charles Fourier, and &quot;devoted himself to propagating his new faith&quot;. He began accumulating a large library of forbidden books and invited friends to visit for the purpose of discussing the new ideas. By 1845 the circle had grown considerably, and Petrashevsky became a well-known figure in Petersburg social and intellectual life. Dostoevsky began attending the Petrashevsky &#x27;Fridays&#x27; in 1847, at the time seeing the discussions as ordinary social occasions with nothing particularly conspiratorial about them. There was a wide diversity of points of view, from atheistic socialists influenced by Hegel and Feuerbach to deeply-religious poets and literary artists, but all held in common a desire for greater freedom in Russian social life and a passionate opposition to the enslaved status of the Russian peasantry.

As Tsar Nicholas had made it clear that he too opposed enslavement, there was not much sense of political conspiracy in the circle at that time. That changed after the 1848 revolutions in Europe, when it became apparent that the kinds of social transformation occurring there would be aggressively stifled by the ruling classes in Russia. Membership of the circle increased, but discussions became more serious, formal and secretive. Petrashevsky, who had always tended to flaunt his iconoclasm, had for some time been a person of interest to the secret police, but they now decided to place him under close surveillance. An agent, Antonelli, was deployed in Petrashevsky&#x27;s department in January 1849, ingratiated himself, began attending the meetings of the circle and reported to his superiors.

===Speshnev&#x27;s secret society===
The government&#x27;s concerns were not without foundation. The aristocrat Nikolay Speshnev, who began attending the Fridays in early 1848, was resolutely in favour of promoting the socialist cause by any means possible, including terrorism, and sought to form his own secret society within the circle. According to Speshnev, infiltration, propaganda and revolt should be the three methods of illegal action for a secret society. He and Petrashevsky held meetings with a charismatic Siberian figure, Rafael Chernosvitov, to discuss the possibility of co-ordinated armed revolts. Speshnev&#x27;s associate, the army lieutenant Nikolay Mombelli, initiated a series of conversations promoting the idea of organised infiltration of the bureaucracy to counter government measures. Mombelli suggested that all members should submit their biography and that traitors be executed.

Petrashevsky, though party to the conversations, consistently urged against the adoption of violent methods. Speshnev, therefore, continued the formation of the society without him and succeeded in recruiting a number of talented members, including Dostoevsky. Although no real action was taken by the group, Dostoevsky had no doubt that there was a &quot;conspiracy in intent&quot;, which included promoting dissatisfaction with the current order and establishing connections with already discontented groups such as religious dissidents and serfs. Found among Speshnev&#x27;s papers after his arrest was a prototype &quot;oath of allegiance&quot; in which the signer would pledge obedience to a central committee and a willingness to be available at any time for whatever violent means were deemed necessary for the success of the cause. Speshnev&#x27;s secret society was never discovered by the authorities, but under threat of torture he confessed to the original discussions within the Petrashevsky Circle.

===Palm-Durov circle===
The growth of the circle led to the formation of a number of satellite groups, most notably the Palm-Durov Circle which met at the shared apartment of the writers Alexander Palm and Sergey Durov. According to Dostoevsky, the original purpose of this group had been to publish a literary almanac. Speshnev follower Pavel Filippov convinced them to actively produce and distribute anti-government propaganda, and two works of this kind were in fact produced, both of which were later discovered by the police. The first—a sketch entitled &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s conversation&quot;—was an exhortation of the popular uprising in France aimed at a peasant audience, and was written by another Speshnev associate, the army officer Nikolay Grigoryev. The second, by Filippov, was a rewriting of the Ten Commandments that characterized various acts of revolt against oppression as being in conformity with the will of God.

When a plan was made to reproduce the articles on a lithograph, Palm and Durov became anxious about continuing the circle, and its activities wound down. When Petrashevsky heard about the plans he too voiced his opposition, arguing that revolts could lead to despotism and that judicial reform should be their primary goal. The conflict brought into the open a clear division in the circle between activists and moderates.

===Belinsky&#x27;s letter to Gogol===
Two of the best-known writers associated with the Petrashevsky Circle, Valerian Maykov and Vissarion Belinsky, died before it was broken. Maykov was very close to Petrashevsky and took a large part in the compilation of Kirillov&#x27;s work &quot;Dictionary of Foreign Words&quot;, which became part of the &quot;corpus delicti&quot; of the trial process. Belinsky, the author of &quot;Letter to Gogol&quot;, would have been classified as a dangerous criminal since many of the Petrashevsky Circle members&#x27; only fault had been participation in the dissemination of the text of the letter. The letter was a passionate and extreme denunciation of Nikolai Gogol&#x27;s loyalty to the autocracy and the Russian Orthodox Church. It claimed, for example, that the church &quot;has always served as the prop of the knout and the servant of despotism.&quot; The letter was read aloud by Dostoevsky and produced a response of universal approval and excitement that transcended the deepening divisions within the circle. Filippov and Mombelli made copies and began distributing them, but Petrashevsky again tried to calm the rising sense of urgency by insisting that judicial reform was the best way forward for the peasantry.

== Arrest and trial ==
Shortly after the meetings centering on Belinsky&#x27;s letter, the arrests began. All those associated with the letter were treated harshly, some merely for &#x27;failure to report&#x27; on those who took part in publishing it. Among these was the poet Pleshcheyev who, according to the verdict, &quot;for distributing Belinsky&#x27;s letter, was deprived of all rights of the state and sent to hard labor in factories for 4 years.&quot; Some members escaped prosecution. These included V. A. Èngel (later an active participant in Herzen&#x27;s &quot;Polar Star&quot;), Dostoevsky&#x27;s brothers Andrey and Mikhail (who had strenuously opposed the publication of provocative material), well-known Slavophile theorist Nikolai Danilevsky, writer Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin, and the poet Apollon Maykov (Valerian&#x27;s brother).

After the arrests on April 22, 1849, the members of the circle were at first detained at the Peter and Paul Fortress. The Commission of Inquiry headed by General Nabokov questioned the prisoners individually on the basis of information supplied by Antonelli, and documents confiscated at the time of the arrest. The trial was to take place according to military law rather than the far more lenient civil law. Of the sixty men originally arrested, fifteen were sentenced to execution by firing squad, others to hard labour and exile. Reviewing the decision the highest military court, the General-Auditariat, ruled that a judicial error had been made and that all the remaining prisoners should be executed. However, when submitting the sentence to the Tsar they included a plea for mercy and a list of lesser sentences.

== Mock execution and exile ==
The Tsar agreed to the lesser sentences, but gave explicit instructions that only after the entire ritual of preparation for execution had been completed should the prisoners be told that their lives had been spared by an act of imperial grace. On the morning of December 22 the prisoners were taken from their cells without explanation and transported to Semonovsky Square. The sentence of death by firing squad was read out over them, and the first three prisoners—Petrashevsky, Mombelli and Grigoryev—were seized and tied to stakes in front of the firing squad. A minute elapsed before the drum roll indicating retreat was heard and the soldiers lowered their rifles. Grigoryev, who in prison had been showing signs of derangement, completely lost his senses, and spent the remainder of his days as a helpless mental invalid. Dostoevsky, who had been next in line, recalled the experience twenty years later in &quot;The Idiot&quot;: &quot;The uncertainty and feeling of aversion for the new thing which was going to overtake him immediately, was terrible&quot;. An aide-de-camp arrived carrying the Tsar&#x27;s pardon and the commuted sentences. Swords were broken over the heads of the prisoners, signifying exclusion from civilian life henceforth. They were placed in shackles, and preparations began for their transport to Siberia.

After serving four to six years of imprisonment and hard labour, the prisoners&#x27; sentences were commuted to exile and service in the army. The members of the circle exiled to Siberia and the Kazakh steppe influenced the nascent Kazakh intelligentsia. One of the most notable interlocutors of Dostoevsky during his time of exile was the Kazakh scholar and military officer Chokan Valikhanov. Speshnev edited a newspaper in Irkutsk from 1857 to 1859. Some, such as Petrashevsky, died in exile, but both Speshnev and Dostoevsky were allowed to return to Petersburg in late 1859, exactly ten years after their departure. In 1860 Dostoevsky published &quot;Notes From the House of the Dead&quot;, a novel based on his experiences in katorga and exile. In 1871 he published &quot;Demons&quot;, a novel that drew to some extent on his experiences with the Petrshevsky Circle and Speshnev&#x27;s conspiratorial group. The central character of the novel, Nikolai Stavrogin, was inspired by Speshnev.

<text>DATEM (diacetyl tartaric acid ester of mono- and diglycerides, also E472e) is an emulsifier primarily used in baking to strengthen the gluten network in dough. It is added to crusty breads, such as rye, to impart a springy, chewy texture. It is also used in the production of biscuits, coffee whiteners, salsa con queso, ice cream, and salad dressings.

==Chemistry==
Although the exact mechanism is not well understood, DATEM appears to interact with the hydrophobic parts of gluten, helping its proteins unfold and form cross-linked structures. DATEM is composed of mixed esters of glycerin in which one or more of the hydroxyl groups of glycerin have been esterified by diacetyl tartaric acid and by fatty acids. The ingredient is prepared by the reaction of diacetyl tartaric anhydride with mono- and diglycerides that are derived from edible sources. The major components are a glycerol molecule with a stearic acid residue, a diacetyl tartaric acid residue, and a free secondary hydroxyl group.

Unlike other commercially used dough emulsifiers, DATEM does not form starch complexes. Its main function is as a strengthener. Typically, DATEM is 0.375 to 0.5% of the total flour weight in most commercial baking.

==Manufacture==
DATEM is derived from tartaric acid and monoglycerides and diglycerides.

==Approval==
In the United States, DATEM is generally recognized as safe by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as specified in the Code of Federal Regulations (21CFR184.1101).

DATEM is approved by the European Food Safety Authority for use as food additive with the E number E472e.

<text>Charles Edward Burton (16 September 1846 – 9 July 1882) was a British-born Irish astronomer.

==Early life==
He was born to Irish parents in Barnton, Cheshire, where his father, Reverend Edward. W. Burton, held a church benefice. Suffering from ill-health, he was privately educated. By the age of 15 he had become very interested in astronomy, experimenting with celestial photography. The family returned to Ireland, where Rev. Burton was appointed curate of Rathmichael Church, Loughlinstown, County Dublin.

==Career==
He joined Lawrence Parsons&#x27;s (Lord Rosse) observatory in February 1868 as an assistant astronomer, using a small transit telescope and learning to grind mirrors up to 15 inches (38 cm) in diameter for telescopes; in the 1840s, William Parsons (3rd Earl) had built the world&#x27;s largest telescope at Parsonstown (Birr from 1899), a 72-inch (183 cm) reflector. The mirrors ground by Burton were regarded as beyond compare. Later in 1868, Burton gained a B.A. from Trinity College Dublin.

He resigned his post as Rosse&#x27;s assistant on account of poor health in March 1869. The following year, he went on the expedition to Augusta (also Austa/Agosta), Sicily, to observe the total solar eclipse of 22 December, and he read his paper about the event on 13 February 1871 to the Royal Irish Academy. Between 1870 and 1874, he reported from ten observations of the shadow of the Jovian moon Ganymede that the shadows appeared to be more elongated than one might expect. He travelled, in the role of a photographer, on one of the five official British expeditions to observe the transit of Venus in 1874, his expedition being to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean, near Mauritius. Using a 12-inch (30 cm) silvered-glass reflector that he had built, he observed nebulae only visible from the southern hemisphere. He spent nearly a year at the Greenwich Observatory taking measurements of the photographic plates of the transit, followed by two years at Dunsink Observatory near Dublin, again retiring because of ill-health in August 1878. His observations of the transit led him to suggest that the fuzzy limb apparent in the imaging of Venus was evidence of a planetary atmosphere.

He continued to work from his father&#x27;s parsonage at Loughlinstown, County Dublin where he built his own observatory with 8-inch (20 cm) and 12-inch reflectors. In 1879, with Mars at its closest point to Earth (in opposition, he validated Giovanni Schiaparelli&#x27;s 1877 observation of the appearance of &#x27;canals&#x27; on Mars, and indeed drew different ones [&#x27;canals&#x27; had been mistranslated from the Italian &quot;canali&quot; and was meant to mean &#x27;channels&#x27;]. His sketches of the canals, and also two sketches from John Dreyer the Danish-Irish astronomer working at Dunsink, were included on a Mercator projection map in the fourth edition of. Webb&#x27;s &quot;Celestial Objects&quot; (1881). However, Burton stated very clearly that astronomers should be circumspect over the permanence of the features:

:&#x27;Considering the difficulty of the objects… [interpretations] given these streaks by different observers hardly afford grounds for surprise. Great caution is necessary in asserting that any &quot;canal&quot; is a recent formation, considering our present almost total ignorance of the conditions.&#x27;

Definitive proof of the absence of linear features was only provided in the 1960s by the NASA/JPL Mariner 4 probe.

Burton also provided the first scientific evidence of clouds on Mars, in notes from 5 January 1880, which he attributed to ground mists and the long exposure of the ice at the south pole to the Sun&#x27;s energy. The Greek astronomer E. M. Antoniadi, who became known particularly for his study of Mars, referred to this historical observation as &quot;genius&quot;.
Preparations for further British expeditions to watch the next transit of Venus (1882), this time to Durban, Cape Colony, and to set up a permanent observatory, interrupted Burton&#x27;s experiments at lunar photography. Weeks into this preparation, he succumbed to the heart disease at the root of his poor constitution, suffering a fatal heart-attack in the church at Castleknock, on Sunday 9 July 1882. Despite his sickly nature, some attributed his early death to repeated exposure to cold nights while observing the heavens.

==Legacy==
Colleagues of his time deplored the loss of such an outstanding astronomer at the age of 35. His colleague and friend, Wentworth Erck, wrote in the &quot;Astronomical Register&quot;:
:&#x27;His loss will be deeply felt by those who knew him well, for these laud him for his blameless life and courteous manners, as much as they respected him for his high scientific attainments and unsurpassed powers as an astronomical observer&#x27;.

In 1973, Burton&#x27;s astronomical work was honoured by the International Astronomical Union which named a crater on Mars after him.

<doc id="806505" wikidata="Q2252914" url="?curid=806505" title="Skibo Castle">
<text>Skibo Castle (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Caisteal Sgìobail&quot;) is located to the west of Dornoch in the Highland county of Sutherland, Scotland overlooking the Dornoch Firth. Although largely of the 19th century and early 20th century, when it was the home of industrialist Andrew Carnegie, its origins go back much earlier. Thomas Chirnside and his brother, Andrew Spencer Chirnside, bought the castle and the surrounding 20,000 acres for £125,000 in 1868 and lived there until they sold it in 1871 for £130,000.

It is now operated as The Carnegie Club, a members-only residential club, offering members and their guests accommodation in both the castle and estate lodges, a private links golf course and a range of activities including clay pigeon shooting, tennis and horse riding.

==Etymology==
According to William J. Watson, Skibo is the anglicisation of Scottish Gaelic &quot;Sgìobal&quot;, which in turn comes from an Old Norse name meaning either firewood-steading or Skithi&#x27;s steading.

==History==
The first record of Skibo Castle is a charter from 1211. From its early history, the castle was a residence of the Bishops of Caithness. Skibo Castle remained the residence of subsequent bishops until 1545, when the estate was, as a tactical measure by the church, given to John Gray in order to reinforce its alliance with a powerful family as the threat of a Protestant uprising spread towards the north.

In 1745, Robert Gray surrendered the estate. It was later bought by a relative who built a modern house before 1760. Its ownership changed frequently until 1872, when it was bought by Evan Charles Sutherland-Walker, who extended the house and improved the grounds. However, the condition of the building had declined by 1897, when wealthy industrialist Andrew Carnegie took a one-year lease, with an option to buy. In 1898 he exercised that option for £85,000. However its condition had declined so much by this time that a further £2 million was spent on improvements, including an increase in area from to over , plus the creation of Loch Ospisdale, an indoor swimming pavilion and a 9-hole golf course. Carnegie employed Alexander Ross of Inverness to carry out major upgrading works including full electrical services served by a private power station.

Skibo stayed with the Carnegie family until 1982. It was later purchased by businessman Peter de Savary and used as the foundation of a private members club, The Carnegie Club. Establishment of the club required restoration of the castle to recreate the luxury of an Edwardian sporting estate. Similar renovation was undertaken on the many lodges located amongst the castle grounds to provide additional accommodation for club members. De Savary sold the club to Ellis Short in 2003, for £23 million. Following the Shorts&#x27; purchase of the club, some £20 million has been invested in the refurbishment and restoration of the 8,000 acre estate. Aware of the historic significance of the category-A listed castle and its contents, the Club have undertaken a programme of conservation over the last decade with the aim of preserving as much as possible of the building whilst improving the existing facilities on the estate. This includes the redevelopment of the golf course, a sympathetic restoration of Carnegie&#x27;s magnificent swimming pool, ongoing restoration of the Mackenzie and Moncur glasshouses and the refurbishment of all bedrooms in the castle and lodges.

==The Carnegie Club==

The Carnegie Club is a members-only club, with its accommodation and facilities available to its members and their guests. Non-members who wish to be considered for membership are invited to apply to the club&#x27;s committee for a one-off visit before deciding whether to apply or not.

The Carnegie links golf course has fewer than 4000 rounds played on it per annum. As it is so quiet, residents of the club do not need to book tee times and can play whenever they wish. A limited number of public tee times are available to non-members/non-residents throughout the summer from May to October.

The funds raised from membership fees and accommodation are reinvested into the upkeep of the estate.

The Carnegie Club hosted Madonna&#x27;s wedding to Guy Ritchie on 22 December 2000. In 1995, it had hosted the marriage of golfer Sam Torrance and actress Suzanne Danielle. On 28 December 1997 it hosted the marriage of actor Robert Carlyle and Anastasia Shirley.

On 3 December 2006, the BBC Television programme &quot;Landward&quot; featured the Burnett family who for several generations had been tenants of a farm on Skibo estate. The programme highlighted their search for a new farm following their eviction by the estate. The farmhouse is now part of guest accommodation on the estate.

==Castle grounds==
The grounds include Lake Louise, a very small artificial lake, and one of only a few bodies of water in Scotland known as lakes. The estate is listed on the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland, the list of nationally significant designed landscapes.

<doc id="806507" wikidata="Q2308635" url="?curid=806507" title="Prolation canon">
<text>In music, a prolation canon (also called a mensuration canon or proportional canon) is a type of canon, a musical composition wherein the main melody is accompanied by one or more imitations of that melody in other voices. Not only do the voices sing or play the same melody, they do so at different speeds (or &quot;prolations&quot;, a mensuration term that dates to the medieval and Renaissance eras). Accompanying voices may enter either simultaneously or successively.

If voices extend the rhythmic values of the leader (for example, by doubling all note values), a procedure known as augmentation, the resulting canon can be called an augmentation canon or canon by augmentation (&quot;canon per augmentationem&quot;) or sloth canon (recalling the slow movement of the sloth). Conversely, if they reduce the note values in diminution, it can be called a diminution canon or canon by diminution (&quot;canon per diminutionem&quot;).

== Examples ==
Prolation canons are among the most difficult canons to write, and are relatively rare in the repertory, though they are most common in the early Renaissance and from the 20th century to the present. Examples of prolation canons from the Renaissance include &quot;Le Ray Au Soleyl&quot; by Johannes Ciconia (late 14th century); the entire &quot;Missa prolationum&quot; by Johannes Ockeghem (mid-15th century), in which each separate section of the mass explores a different prolation (or different gap between entries and relative speed of each voice); the Agnus Dei from the &quot;Missa L&#x27;homme armé super voces musicales&quot; by Josquin des Prez (late 15th century); and the Agnus Dei from the &quot;Missa L&#x27;homme armé&quot; by Pierre de la Rue (early 16th century).

In this example, the first 12 bars of the Agnus Dei II of the earlier of the two masses Josquin wrote based on the &quot;L&#x27;homme armé&quot; tune, each voice sings the same music, but at different speeds. The top voice is barred in 3/4 meter for clarity. The slowest voice is the one in the middle. The lowest voice sings the same music at twice the speed of the slowest, and the highest voice sings the same music at three times the speed of the slowest. In the original score, only one part is given: a notation over the single line of music indicates the three prolations to be used, and a second notation over the line indicates where each voice should end if sung correctly.

Johann Sebastian Bach is known for his &quot;Canon a 4 per Augmentationem et Diminutionem&quot;, the last in a set of 14 canons written as an appendix to the &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot;.

In the 20th century, one such canon is the &quot;Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten&quot; by Arvo Pärt (1976). Additionally, Larry Polansky has written numerous four-voice prolation canons whose melodies are permutations of a limited number of elements, and Mark Alburger, in &quot;Immortality&quot; from &quot;San Rafael News&quot;, directly maps a new melody into the framework of the aforementioned Josquin. A particularly striking example of prolation canon occurs twice in the opening movement of Shostakovich&#x27;s Symphony No. 15 (1971), first in the strings (Rehearsal Figure 27) and later in the woodwind at Rehearsal Figure 47. A more recent example of a prolation canon in contemporary music is &quot;rindenmotette&quot; (2011) by Austrian composer Klaus Lang.

<text>Oran Henry Pape (March 10, 1904 – April 30, 1936) was a member of the Iowa State Patrol in the United States. He is the first member of the Patrol to have been murdered in the line of duty. Prior to joining the Patrol, Pape played professional American football.

==Football career==
Pape played high school football at Dubuque Senior High School, where he was part of the 1924 state championship football team. He then played college football at the University of Iowa. Following college, he played in the National Football League for the Green Bay Packers, the Minneapolis Red Jackets, the Providence Steam Roller, the Boston Braves, and the Staten Island Stapletons. Pape was a member of the 1930 Green Bay Packers NFL Championship team. Pape left the NFL in 1934, and returned to Iowa.

==Police career and death==
Pape attended the State Police Academy at Camp Dodge. He was appointed to the newly formed Iowa Highway Patrol (later Iowa State Patrol) in August 1935, one of the first men to become an officer in the Patrol. On April 28, 1936, Pape was patrolling U.S. Highway 61 near Muscatine, Iowa. He noticed a car that had been reported stolen. After pulling the car over, Pape approached the car. The driver, Roscoe Barton, pointed his gun at Pape and ordered him into his car. Barton drove away with Pape as his hostage. A short while later, Pape saw an opportunity to overpower Barton, and the two began struggling. During the struggle, Barton was shot in the head, and Pape was shot in the abdomen.

Both men were taken to Hershey Hospital in Muscatine. Barton died from his injuries soon after arriving at the hospital. Pape was treated for his gunshot wound, however his condition eventually took a turn for the worse. Doctors were unable to transfuse blood into him because of his collapsed veins. Pape died at 2:40pm on April 30. He was buried at Linwood Cemetery in Dubuque. His badge number 40 was retired from service.

==Legacy==
Pape&#x27;s murder is one of the main reasons the Patrol began the practice of &quot;cross drawing&quot; guns. In this practice, officers wear their guns opposite their strong arm. In theory, an officer would be able to hold on to a person with their strong arm and be able to draw their weapon at the same time. This practice is no longer used, with troopers now carrying their sidearms on their strong side. The I-80 bridges over the Cedar River in Cedar County, Iowa are named in his honor (Trooper Oran Pape Memorial Bridge).

<text>The State Historical Museum () of Russia is a museum of Russian history located between Red Square and Manege Square in Moscow. The museum&#x27;s exhibitions range from relics of prehistoric tribes that lived in the territory of present-day Russia, to priceless artworks acquired by members of the Romanov dynasty. The total number of objects in the museum&#x27;s collection numbers in the millions.

== Description ==
The place where the museum now stands was formerly occupied by the Principal Medicine Store, built by order of Peter the Great in the Moscow Baroque style. 

The museum was founded in 1872 by Ivan Zabelin, Aleksey Uvarov and several other Slavophiles interested in promoting Russian history and national self-awareness. The board of trustees, composed of Sergey Solovyov, Vasily Klyuchevsky, Uvarov, and other leading historians, presided over the construction of the museum building. After a prolonged competition, the project was handed over to Vladimir Osipovich Shervud (or Sherwood, 1833–97).

The present structure was built based on Sherwood&#x27;s neo-Russian design between 1875 and 1881. The first 11 exhibit halls officially opened in 1883 during a visit from the tsar and his wife. Then in 1894, Tsar Alexander III became the honorary president of the museum and the following year, 1895, the museum was renamed the Tsar Alexander III Imperial Russian History Museum. Its interiors were intricately decorated in the Russian Revival style by such artists as Viktor Vasnetsov, Henryk Siemiradzki, and Ivan Aivazovsky. During the Soviet period, the murals were proclaimed gaudy and were plastered over.

== Current activities ==
Since spring 2007, for the first time in the history of The State Historical Museum, all 40 halls have been open to the public. The museum covers the period from ancient times to the early 20th century and over 1.2 million people visit its exhibitions. The museum is also a major centre for research, science and education. The department&#x27;s host lectures and seminars, internships, and awards in research and restoration activities.

Since the end of 2016, it has been possible to view the exhibition through a virtual tour, which is accessible on the museum&#x27;s official website.

About 30-40 exhibition projects are held annually based on exhibits from the museum&#x27;s collection throughout Russia. For the 500th anniversary of the Novodevichy Convent, the museum plans to open an exhibition dedicated to the Russian Orthodox Church. For 2018–2023, a series of exhibitions of the project &quot;National Museums of the World to the Historical Museum&quot; is planned, in which European museums will take part.

From March to July 2020, the museum was closed to the public due to quarantine amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="806532" wikidata="Q6896086" url="?curid=806532" title="Moleosophy">
<text>Moleosophy or moleomancy is a technique of divination and fortune telling based upon the observation and interpretation of bodily marks—primarily those of the &quot;melanocytic nevus&quot; condition (i.e. moles).

Although divination by moles, birthmarks and blemishes has been practiced in many societies throughout history, it has never achieved the status of dream divination, astrology, or even palmistry. As such, it has generally been classed a species of superstition or folklore, rather than a pseudo-science.

==Classical mole divination==
Despite a cultural predeliction for physiognomy, which developed in a considerable literature, mole divination was not a major feature of Greco-Roman culture, and references to the practice are rare. Birthmarks enjoyed a somewhat higher status, and are mentioned. Seleucus I Nicator, the first Macedonian king of Syria, was said to have received from Apollo an anchor-shaped birthmark on his thigh, which was also borne by his descendants.

A short Greek manual of mole interpretation survives from antiquity, appended to the end of a much longer work on divination by twitches ascribed to the legendary Greek seer Melampus. Although the treatise on moles lacks an author, and differs in style from the work on twitches, it is customarily also referred to as by pseudo-Melampus. The text is titled &quot;Peri Elaion tou Somatos&quot; &quot;On the Olives of the Body&quot;, the term presumably being applied to moles because of their similarity in shape and color. There are indications, however, that the text also covers birthmarks, as &quot;fiery&quot; red &quot;olives&quot; are mentioned.

In general, the work relies on fairly straightforward analogical association. A mark on the back of the throat portends beheading. One on the lips portends overeating. A mark on the nose—which the Greeks like many other cultures associated with the privates—portends the recipient will be &quot;insatiate in lovemaking&quot;. Some distinctions are made between men and women, left and right.

A later Turkish translation of the Ps-Melampus text, ascribed to &quot;Leo the Wise&quot;, was translated into French by Jean Nicolaides (, 1889).

CPI is the cost or expense incurred for each potential customer who views the advertisement(s), while CPM refers to the cost or expense incurred for every thousand potential customers who view the advertisement(s). CPM is an initialism for cost per mille, with &quot;mille&quot; being Latin for thousand.

In recent years, to address the potential issue of advertisers getting charged for low-value ad impressions, a new metric has become an industry standard: viewable CPM. With this an ad is counted as &#x27;viewable&#x27; when at least 50 per cent of a display ad is shown for one second or longer, or a video ad plays continuously for two seconds or more.

==Purpose==

Cost per impression, along with pay-per-click (PPC) and cost per order, is used to assess the cost-effectiveness and profitability of online advertising. Cost per impression is the closest online advertising strategy to those offered in other media such as television, radio or print, which sell advertising based on estimated viewership, listenership, or readership. CPI provides a comparable measure to contrast internet advertising with other media.

=== Impression versus pageview ===
An impression is the display of an ad to a user while viewing a web page. A single web page may contain multiple ads. In such cases, a single would result in one impression for each ad displayed. To count the impressions served as accurately as possible and prevent fraud, an ad server may exclude certain non-qualifying activities such as page refreshes or other user actions from counting as impressions. When advertising rates are described as CPM or CPI, this is the amount paid for every thousand qualifying impressions served at cost.

==Construction==

Cost per impression is derived from advertising costs and the number of impressions.
:Cost per impression ($) = Advertising cost ($) / Number of Impressions (#)
Cost per impression is often expressed as Cost per Thousand Impressions (CPM) to make the numbers easier to manage.

<text>Contemporary philosophy is the present period in the history of Western philosophy beginning at the early 20th century with the increasing professionalization of the discipline and the rise of analytic and continental philosophy.

The phrase &quot;contemporary philosophy&quot; is a piece of technical terminology in philosophy that refers to a specific period in the history of Western philosophy (namely the philosophy of the 20th and 21st centuries). However, the phrase is often confused with modern philosophy (which refers to an earlier period in Western philosophy), postmodern philosophy (which refers to some philosophers&#x27; criticisms of modern philosophy), and with a non-technical use of the phrase referring to any recent philosophic work.

==Professionalization==
===Process===
Professionalization is the social process by which any trade or occupation establishes the group norms of conduct, acceptable for membership of the profession, a professional body or association to oversee the conduct of members of the profession, and some degree of demarcation of the qualified from unqualified amateurs. The transformation into a profession brings about many subtle changes to a field of inquiry, but one more readily identifiable component of professionalization is the increasing irrelevance of &quot;the book&quot; to the field: &quot;research communiqués will begin to change in ways [...] whose modern end products are obvious to all and oppressive to many. No longer will [a member&#x27;s] researches usually be embodied in books addressed [...] to anyone who might be interested in the subject matter of the field. Instead they will usually appear as brief articles addressed only to professional colleagues, the men whose knowledge of a shared paradigm can be assumed and who prove to be the only one able to read the papers addressed to them.&quot; Philosophy underwent this process toward the end of the 19th century, and it is one of the key distinguishing features of the contemporary philosophy era in Western philosophy.

Germany was the first country to professionalize philosophy. At the end of 1817, Hegel was the first philosopher to be appointed professor by the State, namely by the Prussian Minister of Education, as an effect of Napoleonic reform in Prussia. In the United States, the professionalisation grew out of reforms to the American higher-education system largely based on the German model. James Campbell describes the professionalisation of philosophy in America as follows:

Professionalization in England was similarly tied to developments in higher-education. In his work on T.H. Green, Denys Leighton discusses these changes in British philosophy and Green&#x27;s claim to the title of Britain&#x27;s first professional academic philosopher:

The result of professionalization for philosophy has meant that work being done in the field is now almost exclusively done by university professors holding a doctorate in the field publishing in highly technical, peer-reviewed journals. While it remains common among the population at large for a person to have a set of religious, political or philosophical views that they consider their &quot;philosophy&quot;, these views are rarely informed or connected to the work being done in professional philosophy today. Furthermore, unlike many of the sciences for which there has come to be a healthy industry of books, magazines, and television shows meant to popularize science and communicate the technical results of a scientific field to the general populace, works by professional philosophers directed at an audience outside the profession remain rare. Philosopher Michael Sandel&#x27;s book &quot;Justice: What&#x27;s the Right Thing to Do?&quot; and Harry Frankfurt&#x27;s &quot;On Bullshit&quot; are examples of works that hold the uncommon distinction of having been written by professional philosophers but directed at and ultimately popular among a broader audience of non-philosophers. Both works became New York Times best sellers.

===Professional philosophy today===
Not long after their formation, the Western Philosophical Association and portions of the American Psychological Association merged with the American Philosophical Association to create what is today the main professional organization for philosophers in the United States: the American Philosophical Association. The association has three divisions: Pacific, Central and Eastern. Each division organises a large annual conference. The biggest of these is the Eastern Division Meeting, which usually attracts around 2,000 philosophers and takes place in a different east coast city each December. The Eastern Division Meeting is also the USA&#x27;s largest recruitment event for philosophy jobs, with numerous universities sending teams to interview candidates for academic posts. Among its many other tasks, the association is responsible for administering many of the profession&#x27;s top honors. For example, the Presidency of a Division of the American Philosophical Association is considered to be a professional honor and the American Philosophical Association Book Prize is one of the oldest prizes in philosophy. The largest academic organization devoted to specifically furthering the study of continental philosophy is the Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy.

Concerning professional journals today, a 2018 survey of professional philosophers asked them to rank the highest quality &quot;general&quot; philosophy journals in English, yielding the following top 20:
Concerning continental philosophy specifically, a 2012 survey of mostly professional philosophers asked them to rank the highest quality &quot;continental tradition&quot; philosophy journals in English. Listing the survey&#x27;s top 6 results:

The Philosophy Documentation Center publishes a well-known Directory of American Philosophers which is the standard reference work for information about philosophical activity in the United States and Canada. The directory is published every two years, alternating with its companion volume, the International Directory of Philosophy and Philosophers (the only edited source for extensive information on philosophical activity in Africa, Asia, Australasia, Europe, and Latin America).

Since the start of the 21st century, philosophers have also seen the growing utilization of blogs as a means of professional exchange. A few notable milestones in this development include an informal listing of philosophy blogs begun by philosopher David Chalmers which has since become a widely used resource by the profession, the establishment of a partnership between ethics blog PEA Soup and the prominent journal Ethics to post featured articles for online discussion on the blog, and the role of blogs like What is it Like to be a Woman in Philosophy? in bringing attention to the experience of women in the profession.

==Analytic–continental divide==

===Beginning of the divide===
Contemporary continental philosophy began with the work of Franz Brentano, Edmund Husserl, Adolf Reinach, and Martin Heidegger and the development of the philosophical method of phenomenology. This development was roughly contemporaneous with work by Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell inaugurating a new philosophical method based on the analysis of language via modern logic (hence the term &quot;analytic philosophy&quot;).

Analytic philosophy dominates in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and the English speaking world. Continental philosophy prevails in Europe, including Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and parts of the United States.

Some philosophers, such as Richard Rorty and Simon Glendinning, argue that this &quot;analytic–continental&quot; divide is inimical to the discipline as a whole. Others, such as John Searle, claim that continental philosophy, especially post-structuralist continental philosophy, should be expunged, on grounds that it is &quot;BS&quot;.

Analytic and continental philosophy share a common Western philosophical tradition up to Immanuel Kant. Afterwards, analytic and continental philosophers differ on the importance and influence of subsequent philosophers on their respective traditions. For instance, the German idealism school developed out of the work of Kant in the 1780s and 1790s and culminated in Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, who is viewed highly by many continental philosophers. Conversely, Hegel is viewed as a relatively minor figure for the work of analytic philosophers.

===Analytic philosophy===

The analytic program in philosophy is ordinarily dated to the work of English philosophers Bertrand Russell and G.E. Moore in the early 20th century, building on the work of the German philosopher and mathematician Gottlob Frege. They turned away from then-dominant forms of Hegelianism (objecting in particular to its idealism and purported obscurity) and began to develop a new sort of conceptual analysis based on recent developments in logic. The most prominent example of this new method of conceptual analysis is Russell&#x27;s 1905 paper &quot;On Denoting&quot;, a paper that is widely seen to be the exemplar of the analytic program in philosophy.

Although contemporary philosophers who self-identify as &quot;analytic&quot; have widely divergent interests, assumptions, and methods—and have often rejected the fundamental premises that defined the analytic movement between 1900 and 1960—analytic philosophy, in its contemporary state, is usually taken to be defined by a particular style characterized by precision and thoroughness about a narrow topic, and resistance to &quot;imprecise or cavalier discussions of broad topics.&quot;

Some analytic philosophers at the end of the 20th century, such as Richard Rorty, have called for a major overhaul of the analytic philosophic tradition. In particular, Rorty has argued that analytic philosophers must learn important lessons from the work of continental philosophers. Some authors, such as Paul M. Livingston and Shaun Gallagher contend that there exist valuable insights common to both traditions while others, such as Timothy Williamson, have called for even stricter adherence to the methodological ideals of analytic philosophy:

The &quot;crude stereotypes&quot; that Williamson refers to in the above passage are these: that analytic philosophers produce carefully argued and rigorous analyses of trivially small philosophic puzzles, while continental philosophers produce profound and substantial results but only by deducing them from broad philosophical systems which themselves lack supporting arguments or clarity in their expression. Williamson himself seems to here distance himself from these stereotypes, but does accuse analytic philosophers of too often fitting the critical stereotype of continental philosophers by moving &quot;too fast&quot; to reach substantial results via poor arguments.

===Continental philosophy===

The history of continental philosophy is taken to begin in the early 1900s because its institutional roots descend directly from those of phenomenology. As a result, Edmund Husserl has often been credited as the founding figure in continental philosophy. Although, since analytic and continental philosophy have such starkly different views of philosophy after Kant, continental philosophy is also often understood in an extended sense to include any post-Kant philosophers or movements important to continental philosophy but not analytic philosophy.

The term &quot;continental philosophy&quot;, like &quot;analytic philosophy&quot;, marks a broad range of philosophical views and approaches not easily captured in a definition. It has even been suggested that the term may be more pejorative than descriptive, functioning as a label for types of western philosophy rejected or disliked by analytic philosophers. Nonetheless, certain descriptive rather than merely pejorative features have been seen to typically characterize continental philosophy:
* First, continental philosophers generally reject scientism, the view that the natural sciences are the best or most accurate way of understanding all phenomena.
* Second, continental philosophy usually considers experience as determined at least partly by factors such as context, space and time, language, culture, or history. Thus continental philosophy tends toward historicism, where analytic philosophy tends to treat philosophy in terms of discrete problems, capable of being analyzed apart from their historical origins.
* Third, continental philosophers tend to take a strong interest in the unity of theory and practice, and tend to see their philosophical inquiries as closely related to personal, moral, or political transformation.
* Fourth, continental philosophy has an emphasis on metaphilosophy (i.e. the study of the nature, aims, and methods of philosophy). This emphasis can also be found in analytic philosophy, but with starkly different results.

Another approach to approximating a definition of continental philosophy is by listing some of the philosophical movements that are or have been central in continental philosophy: German idealism, phenomenology, existentialism (and its antecedents, such as the thought of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche), hermeneutics, structuralism, post-structuralism, deconstruction, French feminism, and the critical theory of the Frankfurt School and some other branches of Western Marxism.

===Bridging the divide===
An increasing number of contemporary philosophers have contested the value and plausibility of distinguishing analytic and continental philosophy. Some philosophers, like Richard J. Bernstein and A. W. Moore have explicitly attempted to reconcile these traditions, taking as a point of departure certain themes shared by notable scholars in each tradition.

<doc id="806565" wikidata="Q6922565" url="?curid=806565" title="Mount Olivet Cemetery (Dubuque, Iowa)">
<text>Mount Olivet Cemetery is a Catholic cemetery located at 10378 Military Road in Key West, Iowa approximately south of Dubuque. It is one of the two large Catholic cemeteries located in the Dubuque area. The cemetery is located near Saint Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Church in Key West, but is operated independently.

The cemetery offers in-ground burial, as well as columbarium and mausoleum entombment.

==History==
The cemetery began in 1856 and was known as the &quot;Key West Burying Ground&quot;. In 1901, the Mt. Olivet Cemetery Association was formed and the cemetery was renamed Mount Olivet. Though a newspaper article from 1901 indicates that the board of 11 trustees planned to relocate graves from the Third Street Cemetery, adjacent to St. Raphael&#x27;s Cathedral (Dubuque, Iowa), to Mt. Olivet, there is no record that these disinterments ever took place. At least 11 graves encountered during development of the Third Street property in the 1940s were moved to the Third Street Cemetery section of Mt. Olivet, as were two sets of remains disturbed in the 1970s and four discovered in 1994. Over 900 graves were archaeologically excavated from the Third Street Cemetery between 2007 and 2011. The remains of these individuals were also reburied in the Third Street Cemetery section of Mt. Olivet.

The board then hired O. C. Simonds to improve the cemetery grounds. Simmonds, who was the superintendent of Graceland Cemetery in Chicago, Illinois and was widely recognized as a landscape gardener, set about to improve the cemetery which was inaccessible to those not on-foot.

Former Dubuque Archbishops James Keane and John Keane are both buried in the cemetery. While the men shared the same last name, they were not related. Kenneth Mott, owned a Dubuque music store, was buried at the cemetery following his death in an airplane accident with a marker shaped like a Grand Piano.

St Joseph&#x27;s Chapel Mausoleum is located at the northwest corner of the cemetery. The mausoleum was built in 1989, and was later expanded. This building has crypts for mausoleum entombment, columbarium niches for cremated remains and a small chapel for the final committal ceremonies.

<doc id="806566" wikidata="Q815" url="?curid=806566" title="Gabriel González Videla">
<text>Gabriel Enrique González Videla (; 22 November 1898 – 22 August 1980) was a Chilean politician and lawyer who served as the 24th president of Chile from 1946 to 1952. He had previously been a member of the Chamber of Deputies from 1930 to 1941 and senator for Tarapacá and Antofagasta from 1945 to 1946. A long-time member and leader in the Radical Party, he left the party in 1971 over its support for socialist president Salvador Allende. From 1973 until his death in 1980 he became an active participant in the government of Augusto Pinochet, acting as vice president of the Council of State from 1976 onwards. As vice president of the council, he helped draft the current Chilean constitution of 1980.

== Early life ==
González was born in the coastal city of La Serena on 22 November 1898, to parents Gabriel González Castillo and Teresa Videla Zepeda. He was the oldest of eighteen children. After graduating from the &quot;Liceo de La Serena&quot;, González went on to study law at the University of Chile. He graduated in 1922, the same year his father became paralyzed. As a result of his father&#x27;s paralysis, González returned to La Serena to help his family. He became a freemason in 1924.

In 1915, González joined the youth wing of the Radical Party, later becoming a member of the Radical Assembly of La Serena. González was involved in protests against the military government established in 1924 by Luis Altamirano. In 1927, he made declarations against President Carlos Ibáñez and had to go into hiding. Once Ibáñez&#x27;s government fell in 1931, González was able to resume his political activities and was president of the Radical Party from 1931 to 1937.

González was elected deputy for the district comprising La Serena, Coquimbo, Elqui, Ovalle, Combarbalá, and Illapel in 1930. However, the coup led by socialist Marmaduque Grove in 1932 dissolved Congress. González was once again elected deputy for this same area in 1933 and reelected in 1937. In 1939 he resigned because President Pedro Aguirre Cerda named him ambassador to France first, then to Portugal (1940), and finally to Brazil (1942).

=== 1942 presidential campaign ===

In 1941, due to his rapidly escalating illness, President Aguirre Cerda appointed his minister of the Interior, Jerónimo Méndez as vice-president and died soon after, on 25 November 1941. Presidential elections were called for 1 February 1942. Two days before the internal primaries of the Radical Party, Gabriel González Videla, who represented the Radical Party&#x27;s more leftist faction, returned to Chile to dispute the nomination to Juan Antonio Ríos. The results were too close to call, so a &quot;tribunal of honor&quot; (electoral commission) was constituted, and Juan Antonio Ríos was finally proclaimed the candidate of the left-wing coalition.

This Democratic Alliance () was formed by the Radical Party, the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the Democratic Party and the Workers&#x27; Socialist Party. Ríos went on to win the general election with 56% of the votes and took office on 2 April.

In 1945, González Videla was elected senator for the provinces of Tarapacá and Antofagasta and represented Chile at the United Nations conference in San Francisco.

=== 1946 presidential campaign ===

González Videla finally won the Radical Party primaries in 1946. He attempted to revive the Democratic Alliance that brought Juan Antonio Ríos to power in 1942 but was unsuccessful in this endeavor, as the Socialist Party denounced the offer of alliance, refused to join and the popular front could not be reconstituted. In the end, González only gained a plurality with the support of his own Radical Party and the Communist Party.

In the presidential elections, González won 40% of the vote, defeating right-wing candidates Eduardo Cruz-Coke and Fernando Alessandri and socialist Bernardo Ibáñez. Since González did not reach the necessary 50%, the election went to Congress. He was duly confirmed on October 24 that year.

== Presidency ==
Gabriel González Videla&#x27;s first cabinets, between 1946 and 1948, included Communist ministers; but the international Cold War and Chile&#x27;s internal troubles soon pushed González Videla toward the right. Chile quickly became enmeshed in the Cold War, as Moscow and especially Washington meddled in its affairs. That friction resulted in the splitting of the CTCh (the Worker&#x27;s union) in 1946 into Communist and Socialist branches and then the outlawing of the Communist Party. The Socialists were now opposed to the Communists and aligned with the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) having grown closer to United States labor interests during World War II.

Once in the presidency, González Videla had a fallout with his Communist allies. They demanded more cabinet seats, which González Videla refused to grant. The Communist Party then withdrew their support for him. In response, he first expelled them from his cabinet and then banned them completely under the 1948 &quot;Law of Permanent Defense of Democracy&quot; (), which banned communist and like-minded parties. He also broke relations with the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact countries. Many key communist figures decided to flee the country, including poet Pablo Neruda, who had decried González Videla on the Senate Floor for &quot;selling out to the United States.&quot; The communists that remained were arrested, but were not subjected to torture or execution. A pro-communist miners&#x27; strike in Lota was brutally suppressed. Demonstrations against what the communists called &quot;la ley maldita&quot; (&quot;the damned law&quot;) led to the declaration of martial law, but were successfully repressed.

In 1948, González Videla also learned of a plot by some members of the Armed Forces to lead a coup against him and install Carlos Ibáñez as president. He immediately ordered an investigation and the arrest of the coup leaders, including the head of the operation, General Ramón Vergara. Ibáñez, however, was absolved of all responsibility. This plan became known as the Pig trotters&#x27; plot (), because the coup leaders met in a restaurant which specialized in this Chilean dish.

After outlawing the Communists, he ruled with the support of the two right-wing parties, the conservatives and the liberals, which approved of his anti-communist stance. He constructed a new cabinet made up of conservatives, liberals, radicals, some socialists, and members of the small Democratic Party. The Communist Party remained illegal until 1958.

Controversy still swirls around the reasons for his aboutface. According to González Videla and his sympathizers, the repression of the Communists was necessary to thwart their plots against his government, but no evidence has been found to substantiate that claim. According to the Communists and other critics of González Videla, he acted under pressure from the United States and out of a desire to forge closer economic and military bonds with the dominant superpower. Historians have established that the president wanted to appease the United States, the United States encouraged a crackdown on Chilean Communists, and the US government appreciated González Videla&#x27;s actions and thereafter expanded the scope of its loans, investments, and technical missions to Chile. The US and Chile also agreed to a military assistance pact while González Videla was president. However, no conclusive evidence has come to light that the US directly pushed him to act.

Although González Videla feared Communist intentions and respected the wishes of the US government, he also turned against the PCCh for other reasons. He hoped to mollify right-wing critics of his government, especially landowners to whom he guaranteed a continuing moratorium on peasant unionization. He sought to remove any ideological justification for a military coup. He also wanted to weaken the labor movement in a time of economic uncertainties, slow growth, and rising inflation while the PCCh was promoting strikes. González Videla&#x27;s banning of the Communists coincided with his movement away from social reform in favor of the promotion of industrial growth.

Economic links with the United States, which had grown after the economic crisis of the 1930s, were strengthened after World War II; U.S. investments in Chile increased from $414,000,000 in 1945 to $540,000,000 in 1950, largely in copper production. By 1952 the United States had loaned $342,000,000 to the Chilean government. The exchange of technicians and professors helped tighten technical and cultural links between the two countries.

The presidency of González Videla saw the strong political recovery of the right. Between 1940 and 1952, Chile&#x27;s population rose from 5,000,000 to 6,350,000, with the strongest increase in urban areas, which accounted for 52 percent of the total population in 1940 and 60 percent in 1952. Production rose by a rate very close to the rise in population. Social inequities were not reduced significantly, however, although some reforms were carried out, with social security extended to more Chileans, and women granted the right to vote in 1949.

In the parliamentary elections of 1949, the pro-government parties triumphed. However, the unity between right-wing parties and radicals and socialists did not last long. Radicals were unhappy with the economic policies of the right-wing Finance Minister, Jorge Alessandri, no matter how successful they were in controlling inflation. When a protest by government employees broke out in 1950, the radicals immediately declared their support for the protesters&#x27; demands. The right-wingers responded by resigning from González&#x27;s cabinet.

By losing both liberal and conservative support, González lost the pro-government majority in Congress. He was unable to achieve much thereafter, but he managed to make significant improvements on women&#x27;s rights. González&#x27;s cabinet had the first woman minister in Latin America (Adriana Olguín), and he appointed the first woman ambassador and created the &quot;Oficina de la Mujer&quot;.

During his presidency, he became the first chief of state of any nation to visit Antarctica. The Chilean Gonzalez Videla Antarctic Base is named after him.

== Retirement and death ==

After his term ended in 1952, his name was mentioned in the party primaries in 1958, though he announced he would not seek the presidency. In 1964, he actively campaigned for radical presidential candidate Julio Durán, who was also anti-communist. González&#x27;s influence in a now more left-leaning Radical Party was decreasing, and in 1971 he resigned from the party, angered by its support for socialist Salvador Allende. González undertook a significant role in the opposition to Allende and supported Augusto Pinochet&#x27;s 1973 coup which deposed Allende.

González was vice president of the Council of State which drafted a new Constitution of Chile during Pinochet&#x27;s presidency. When his work there was finished, González completely retired from politics and died of cardiac arrest on 22 August 1980, in Santiago.

<text>The Turia or Túria is a river in Spain, which has its source in the Montes Universales in the mountain ranges of the northwesternmost end of the Sistema Ibérico, Teruel province. From its source to roughly the city of Teruel, it is called &quot;Guadalaviar&quot; river. It runs through the provinces of Teruel, Cuenca and Valencia, and discharges into the Mediterranean Sea near the city of Valencia. The river formerly ran through the center of the city but was diverted south of the city to prevent flooding.

==Name==
The Latin name &quot;Tūria&quot; (also recorded as &quot;Tyrius&quot;) has been connected with the Celtic root *&quot;dubr-&quot;, &quot;river&quot;; the river would thus share a root with the Douro.

== Diversion project ==
The river is notorious for its floods. The flood which occurred on 14 October 1957, known as the Great Flood of Valencia, flooded large parts of the city of Valencia, and caused a great deal of damage to both life and property. To prevent this from happening in the future, a diversion project was devised ( in Valencian; in Spanish), completed in 1969, and the river was divided in two at the western city limits near Quart de Poblet. During floods, most of the water is diverted southwards along a new course that skirts the city, until it meets the Mediterranean. The old course of the river has been turned into a central green-space for the city, a cultural attraction known as the Garden of the Turia.

Not unlike the Los Angeles River, the man-made diversion channel south of the city is often found dry, since water primarily flows during periods of flooding. Under ordinary flow rates the water is directed through irrigation channels to help cultivate the fertile plain of Valencia. Throughout history the water of the River Turia has been used to irrigate the region. In modern times, a complex network of irrigation has been created, with the main axis centred on the diversion project. Beyond irrigation, these channels also take runoff and surplus water from the Turia to the wetlands and marshes around Valencia.

== Attractions along the old course ==

The old riverbed is now a verdant sunken park that allows cyclists and pedestrians to traverse much of the city without the use of roads. The park, called the &#x27;Garden of the Turia&#x27; (&quot;Jardí del Túria/Jardín del Turia&quot;) boasts numerous ponds, paths, fountains, flowers, football pitches, cafés, artworks, climbing walls, an athletics track, a zen garden and more. The many bridges overhead carry traffic across the park.

Towards the park&#x27;s eastern end of the river course is the Valencian Music Palace (&quot;el Palau de la Música Valenciana&quot;). Also towards the eastern end is the Gulliver Park (&quot;Parc Gulliver/Parque Gulliver&quot;) (), a children&#x27;s adventure playground featuring a huge fibreglass model of Lemuel Gulliver tied to the ground with ropes. The model is constructed such that the ropes are climbable. In addition, Gulliver&#x27;s clothes form slides and ladders on which to play.

Marking the park&#x27;s eastern extreme is Valencia&#x27;s neo-futuristic architectural and cultural complex, the City of Arts and Sciences, featuring the opera house Palau de les Arts Reina Sofia, an cinemax/panetarium L&#x27;Hemisfèric, the science museum Museu de les Ciències Príncipe Felipe, and an oceanographic park L&#x27;Oceanogràfic.

Two Metrovalencia stations lie beneath the riverbed, with entrances on either bank: Túria and Alameda.

<text>The Wildlife Trust for Birmingham and the Black Country is a wildlife trust covering Birmingham and the Black Country in the West Midlands of England. It covers five of the seven districts of the West Midlands county: Birmingham, Dudley, Sandwell, Walsall and Wolverhampton.
==History==
Created in 1980, by Chris Baines and others, it was formerly known as the &quot;Urban Wildlife Group&quot;, and then the &quot;Urban Wildlife Trust&quot;, the United Kingdom&#x27;s first urban Wildlife Trust. It was responsible for the first ever International Dawn Chorus Day event, held at Moseley Bog in 1984. In the mid-1980s it established Plants Brook Nature Reserve in Birmingham.

The Trust was the first UK Wildlife Trust to become a member of Countdown 2010 the European initiative to halt the decline in biodiversity by 2010.

Black Country Living Landscape was a major initiative of the Trust that aimed to be the first practical application of the principles of landscape scale conservation to an urban area.

In 2012 the Trust built a partnership that was successful in getting Birmingham and the Black Country declared as one of the UK&#x27;s first tranche of Nature Improvement Areas.

==Description==
The organisation had a 40 hectare reserve at Park Hall near Minworth but despite opposition this was taken possession of by HS2 under powers granted by the High Speed Rail (London - West Midlands) Act 2017.
Other nature reserves include Portway Hill, Deer&#x27;s Leap Wood, Peascroft Wood, Richmond Garden in Soho, Birmingham and Hill Hook Local Nature Reserve. The Trust also manages Moseley Bog and has a close involvement with reserves such as Moorcroft Wood Local Nature Reserve. The Trust operates a number of environmental centres including the Centre of the Earth and the Birmingham EcoPark.

It is a full member of the Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts, (one of 46 covering the whole United Kingdom), and was the first urban Wildlife Trust and has a membership of over 11,000.

The trust carries out a wide range of activities to protest and develop biodiversity and engage with local people and various nature conservation, community and education projects. They carry out research, surveys and campaigns. Each year it co-ordinates International Dawn Chorus Day.

The Trust is managed by a council of trustees drawn from the membership. The Trust has about twenty full, part-time and contract staff and many active volunteers. They produce a regular magazine, Wildlife Focus, which provides coverage of their activities and a range of urban wildlife issues.

<text>Botolph of Thorney (; also called Botolph, Botulph or Botulf; later known as Saint Botolph; died ) was an English abbot and saint. He is regarded as the patron saint of boundaries, and by extension, of trade and travel, as well as various aspects of farming. His feast day is celebrated either on 17 June (England) or 25 June (Scotland).

== Life and works ==

Little is known about the life of Botolph, other than doubtful details in an account written four hundred years after his death by the 11th-century monk Folcard. Botolph was born sometime in the early 7th century to noble Saxon parents who were Christians. He and his brother Adulph were educated by Saint Fursey at Cnobheresburg monastery. They were then sent to study on the Continent, where they became Benedictines. Adulph remained abroad, where he is said to have become a Bishop.

Botolph, returning to England, found favour with a certain &quot;King of the southern Angles&quot;, whose sisters he had known in Germany, and was by him permitted to choose a tract of desolate land upon which to build a monastery. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records for the year 654: &quot;The Middle Angles, under earldorman Peada, received the true faith. King Anna was killed and Botolph began to build the church at Ikanho&quot;. 

Botolph founded the monastery of Icanho. Icanho, which means &#x27;ox hill&#x27;, has been identified as Iken, located by the estuary of the River Alde in Suffolk; a church still remains on top of an isolated hill in the parish. At the time, the site was a tidal island all but surrounded by water, but Botolph attracted other monks and hermits and together they turned areas of marsh and scrub into productive grazing and farm land. The monks built several structures, and the monastery grew. Botolph also worked as an itinerant missionary in East Anglia, Kent and Sussex. 

The Life of St Ceolfrith, written around the time of Bede by an unknown author, mentions an abbot named Botolph in East Anglia, &quot;a man of remarkable life and learning, full of the grace of the Holy Spirit&quot;. Ceolfrith visited him about the year 670.

Botolph is supposed to have been originally buried at his foundation of Icanho, but in 970 Edgar I of England gave permission for the remains of Botolph to be transferred to Burgh, near Woodbridge, to prevent them from being destroyed by invading Danes. They remained for some fifty years before being transferred to their own tomb at Bury St Edmunds Abbey on the instructions of Cnut. The saint&#x27;s relics were later transferred again, along with those of his brother Adulph, to Thorney Abbey, although his head was transferred to Ely Abbey and various body parts to other houses, including Westminster Abbey.

==Church dedications==
Many English churches are dedicated to Botolph. According to the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Saints&quot;, 64 ancient English churches were dedicated to him, but later research has suggested the true number may have been as high as 71, with a high concentration of dedications in East Anglia. St Botolph&#x27;s Church in Boston, Lincolnshire, known locally as &quot;The Stump&quot;, is one of the most famous. Boston, or &#x27;Botolph&#x27;s town&#x27; also gave Boston, Massachusetts its name.

St Botolph&#x27;s Priory in Colchester, Essex, the first Augustinian monastery in England, was built on an earlier Anglo-Saxon church dedicated to Botolph. St Botolph&#x27;s Church in Hardham, West Sussex, houses some of the most ancient surviving wall paintings in Britain, including the earliest known depiction of St. George in England.

In Botolph&#x27;s role as a patron saint of travellers, four City of London churches were dedicated to him, all of which were close to gates in the City walls: St Botolph Billingsgate, which was destroyed in the Great Fire and never rebuilt; St Botolph&#x27;s, Aldersgate, St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate, where the poet John Keats was baptised, and St Botolph&#x27;s Aldgate. It is believed that these dedications were made because the churches provided places for incoming travellers to give thanks for their safe arrival and for outgoing travellers to pray for a safe journey. An alternative possibility is that the churches were dedicated to the saint because his relics came through the four gates when Edgar moved them from Iken to Westminster Abbey. 

Beyond the North Sea, Budolfi Church (&quot;Sankt Budolfi kirke&quot;) in Aalborg, Denmark, originally a smallish building, grew to be the major church of the town by the late Middle Ages and is now the cathedral church of the diocese of Aalborg.

== Secular connections ==
Botolph is remembered in the names of the market town of Boston, Lincolnshire in the United Kingdom and Boston, Massachusetts, in the United States. Boston was originally &quot;Botolphston&quot; (from &quot;Botolph&#x27;s stone&quot; or &quot;Botolph&#x27;s town&quot;).

In Boston, Massachusetts, Botolph gives his name to the St Botolph Club, a private club, a street in Boston&#x27;s Back Bay neighborhood, and the President&#x27;s House at Boston College.

The University of Cambridge&#x27;s poetry journal in the 1950s was called &quot;St Botolph&#x27;s Review&quot;. It was named for St Botolph&#x27;s Church, Cambridge as one of its founders, Lucas Myers, lived at the rectory of St Botolph&#x27;s Church in Cambridge. A second edition of the journal was published in 2006. &quot;St Botolph&#x27;s College&quot; has been used as a hypothetical college in Cambridge University communications and Tripos examinations.

The parish of Buttsbury in Essex was initially called &quot;Botolfvespirie&quot;, meaning Botolph&#x27;s Pear Tree. It is sometimes surmised that the name refers to a tree under which St Botolph preached.

There is a St Botolph&#x27;s Brook on the boundary between Colchester and the village of West Bergholt. Despite there being a St Botolph&#x27;s church in Colchester, J. Horace Round, the Victorian historian, agreed with the earlier theory that in this case Botolph is a corruption of Godulf, an Anglo-Saxon name.

<text>Warwickshire Wildlife Trust is a Wildlife Trust and Registered Charity covering the county of Warwickshire and Solihull and Coventry in the county of West Midlands, England. The Trust aims to protect and enhance wildlife, natural habitats and geology throughout Warwickshire, Coventry and Solihull. (Solihull and Coventry, were formerly in Warwickshire and are now in the West Midlands county.)

==Trust==
The Trust headquarters are at Brandon Marsh Nature Reserve near Brandon in Warwickshire. Brandon Marsh is one of 65 reserves that the Trust oversees, including Bubbenhall Wood and Meadow near Coventry, Wappenbury Wood by Princethorpe, Ufton Fields near Southam and the River Arrow Nature Reserve in Alcester.

The trust was founded on 6 June 1957 and was originally called The West Midlands Trust for Nature Conservation Limited which split into the Staffordshire Nature Conservation Trust, Worcestershire Nature Conservation Trust and Warwickshire Nature Conservation Trust between 1968 and 1971. It was popularly known as WARNACT from warn-act over this period, until changing its name to Warwickshire Wildlife Trust in the 1990s. From 1980, together with the other two county Trusts, it withdrew from Birmingham and the Black Country when the Urban Wildlife Group was established.

<doc id="806636" wikidata="Q758251" url="?curid=806636" title="Authorization certificate">
<text>In computer security, an attribute certificate, or authorization certificate (AC) is a digital document containing attributes associated to the holder by the issuer. When the associated attributes are mainly used for the purpose of authorization, AC is called authorization certificate. AC is standardized in X.509. RFC 5755 further specifies the usage for authorization purpose in the Internet.

The authorization certificate works in conjunction with a public key certificate (PKC). While the PKC is issued by a certificate authority (CA) and is used as a proof of identity of its holder like a passport, the authorization certificate is issued by an attribute authority (AA) and is used to characterize or entitle its holder like a visa. Because identity information seldom changes and has a long validity time while attribute information frequently changes or has a short validity time, separate certificates with different security rigours, validity times and issuers are necessary.

==Comparison of attribute and public key certificates==
An AC resembles a PKC but contains no public key because an AC verifier is under the control of the AC issuer, and therefore, trusts the issuer directly by having the public key of the issuer preinstalled. This means that once the AC issuer&#x27;s private key is compromised, the issuer has to generate a new key pair and replaces the old public key in all verifiers under its control with the new one.

The verification of an AC requires the presence of the PKC that is referred as the AC holder in the AC.

As with a PKC, an AC can be chained to delegate attributions. For example, an authorization certificate issued for Alice authorizes her to use a particular service. Alice can delegate this privilege to her assistant Bob by issuing an AC for Bob&#x27;s PKC. When Bob wants to use the service, he presents his PKC and a chain of ACs starting from his own AC issued by Alice and then Alice&#x27;s AC issued by the issuer that the service trusts. In this way, the service can verify that Alice has delegated her privilege to Bob and that Alice has been authorized to use the service by the issuer that controls the service. RFC 3281, however, does not recommend the use of AC chains because of the complexity in administering and processing the chain and there is little use of AC in the Internet.

==Usage==
To use a service or a resource that the issuer of an AC controls, a user presents both the PKC and the AC to a part of the service or resource that functions as an AC verifier. The verifier will first check the identity of the user using the PKC, for example, by asking the user to decrypt a message encrypted by the user&#x27;s public key in the PKC. If the authentication is successful, the verifier will use the preinstalled public key of the AC issuer to check the validity of the presented AC. If the AC is valid, the verifier will check whether or not the PKC specified in the AC matches the presented PKC. If it matches, the verifier will check the validity period of the AC. If the AC is still valid, the verifier can perform additional checks before offering the user a particular level of service or resource usage in accordance to the attributes contained in the AC.

For example, a software developer that already has a PKC wants to deploy its software in a computing device employing DRM like iPad where software can only be run in the device after the software has been approved by the device manufacturer. The software developer signs the software with the private key of the PKC and sends the signed software to the device manufacturer for approval. After authenticating the developer using the PKC and reviewing the software, the manufacturer may decide to issue an AC granting the software the basic capability to install itself and be executed as well as an additional capability to use the Wi-Fi device following the principle of least privilege. In this example, the AC does not refer to the PKC of the developer as the holder but to the software, for example, by storing the developer&#x27;s signature of the software in the holder field of the AC. When the software is put into the computing device, the device will verify the integrity of the software using the developer&#x27;s PKC before checking the validity of the AC and granting the software access to the device functionalities.

A user may also need to obtain several ACs from different issuers to use a particular service. For example, a company gives one of its employees a company-wide AC that specifies engineering department as the work area. To access engineering data, however, the employee also needs a security clearance AC from the head of the engineering department. In this example, the resource of engineering data needs to be preinstalled with the public keys of both the company-wide and the engineering department AC issuers.

==Contents of a typical attribute certificate==
Version: the version of the certificate.

Holder: the holder of the certificate.

Issuer: the issuer of the certificate.

Signature algorithm: the algorithm by which the certificate is signed.

Serial number: the unique issuance number given by the issuer.

Validity period: the validity period of the certificate.

Attributes: the attributes associated to the certificate holder.

Signature value: the signature of the issuer over the whole data above.

==Benefits==
Using attribute certificate, the service or resource host does not need to maintain an access control list that can potentially be large or to always be connected to a network to access a central server like when using Kerberos. It is similar to the idea of capabilities in which the permission (or permissions) to use a service or resource is not stored in the service or resource itself but in the users using a tamper resistance mechanism.

<text>Jacob of Juterbogk (c. 1381 – 30 April 1465) was a German monk and theologian. Benedict Stolzenhagen, known in religion as Jacob, was born at Jüterbog in Brandenburg of poor peasant stock. He became a Cistercian at the monastery of Paradiz in Poland, and was sent by the abbot to the University of Kraków, where he became master in philosophy and doctor of theology. He returned to his monastery, of which he became abbot. In 1441, however, he was discontented with the absence of strict discipline in his community, he obtained the leave of the papal legate at the council of Basel to transfer himself to the Carthusians, entering the monastery of Salvatorberg near Erfurt, of which he became prior. He lectured on theology at the University of Erfurt, of which he was rector in 1456, and wrote around eighty treatises. Like many men of his time, he promoted Conciliarism, the idea that a general council should be above the pope.

Jacob&#x27;s main preoccupation was the reform of monastic life, the disorders of which he deplored, and to this end he wrote his . Another work, , was directed against the neglect of their duties by the higher clergy, and he addressed a petition for the reform of the church () to Pope Nicholas V. This having no effect, he issued the most outspoken of his works, , in which he reviewed the work of the reforming councils of his time, and, without touching the question of doctrine, championed a drastic reform of life and practice of the church on the lines laid down at the Councils of Constance and Basel.

<doc id="806643" wikidata="Q1503335" url="?curid=806643" title="Ode for the Birthday of Queen Anne">
<text>Ode for the Birthday of Queen Anne (HWV 74) is a secular cantata composed by George Frideric Handel to a libretto by Ambrose Philips, of which the first line, &quot;Eternal source of light divine&quot;, provides an alternative title for the work. It was probably composed during January 1713 for a performance on 6 February 1713, although there is no record of the performance having actually taken place. Other catalogues of Handel&#x27;s music have referred to the work as HG xlvi A; and HHA i/6.

==Overview==
The cantata celebrates Queen Anne&#x27;s birthday, and the accomplishment of the Treaty of Utrecht (negotiated by the Tory ministry of Anne in 1712) to end the War of the Spanish Succession. It is scored for 3 solo voices, choir and chamber orchestra.

Queen Anne was said by the Duke of Manchester to be &quot;too careless or too busy to listen to her own band, and had no thought of hearing and paying new players however great their genius or vast their skill.&quot; Nevertheless, and whether or not she ever heard this ode for her birthday, she granted Handel a &quot;pension&quot; (subsidy for living expenses) of two hundred pounds a year, for life.

== Structure ==


Each of the seven stanzas of the ode concludes with the following words sung by the chorus:

: &quot;The day that gave great Anna birth&quot;,
: &quot;Who fix&#x27;d a lasting peace on Earth&quot;.

* (Alto solo with solo trumpet over sustained strings)
:Eternal source of light divine
:With double warmth thy beams display
:And with distinguish&#x27;d glory shine
:To add a lustre to this day.

*(Alto solo, then chorus with orchestra)
:The day that gave great Anna birth
:Who fix&#x27;d a lasting peace on earth.

*(Soprano solo, then chorus with orchestra)
:Let all the winged race with joy
:Their wonted homage sweetly pay
:Whilst towr&#x27;ing in the azure sky
:They celebrate this happy day.
:The day that gave great Anna birth
:Who fix&#x27;d a lasting peace on earth.

*(Alto solo, then alto and soprano solo with chorus and orchestra)
:Let flocks and herds their fear forget
:Lions and wolves refuse their prey
:And all in friendly consort meet
:Made glad by this propitious day.
:The day that gave great Anna birth
:Who fix&#x27;d a lasting peace on earth.

*(Bass and alto duet, then chorus with orchestra. The ground bass of this movement with octave leaps was reused by Handel in his &quot;Concerto a due cori&quot;.)
:Let rolling streams their gladness show
:With gentle murmurs whilst they play
:And in their wild meanders flow
:Rejoicing in this blessed day.
:The day that gave great Anna birth
:Who fix&#x27;d a lasting peace on earth.

* (Soprano and alto duet with solo oboe and orchestra)
:Kind Health descends on downy wings
:Angels conduct her on the way.
:T&#x27;our glorious Queen new life she brings
:And swells our joys upon this day.

* (Alto and soprano, then chorus with orchestra)
:The day that gave great Anna birth
:Who fix&#x27;d a lasting peace on earth.

* (Bass solo, then chorus with orchestra)
:Let envy then conceal her head
:And blasted faction glide away.
:No more her hissing tongues we&#x27;ll dread
:Secure in this auspicious day.
:The day that gave great Anna birth
:Who fix&#x27;d a lasting peace on earth.

* (Alto solo then chorus with echo effects, solo trumpet and orchestra)
:United nations shall combine
:To distant climes their sound convey
:That Anna&#x27;s actions are divine
:And this the most important day!
:The day that gave great Anna birth
:Who fix&#x27;d a lasting peace on earth.

==Notable performances==
On 23 August 2007, Kate Royal performed the aria &quot;Eternal source of light divine&quot; at the Proms.

On 19 May 2018, Elin Manahan Thomas performed the aria &quot;Eternal source of light divine&quot; as the bridal entry music for the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, accompanied by the event&#x27;s orchestra and with David Blackadder playing the trumpet obbligato.

<text>Dalia is the goddess of fate in the Lithuanian mythology. She is the giver and taker of goods and property. Dalia is often confused with and hard to distinguish from Laima, another goddess of fate. Sometimes Dalia is thought of as a different manifestation of Laima. However, Laima is more involved in predicting the length of a person&#x27;s life while Dalia is more concerned with material wealth a person would earn during the lifetime – allotting a proper share (Lithuanian: &quot;dalis&quot;) to everyone. According to myths, just as a father divides his estate among the children, so Dievas Senelis (manifestation of supreme god Dievas) allots each newborn with a proper share. Dalia is seen more as an enforcer of Dievas&#x27; will rather than a decision-maker. She can appear as a woman, lamb, dog, swan, or duck.

<text>Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin (; September 25, 1843 – November 15, 1928) was an American geologist and educator. In 1893 he founded the &quot;Journal of Geology&quot;, of which he was editor for many years.

==Biography==
Chamberlin was born September 25, 1843, in Mattoon, Illinois. When he was three years old his family moved north to near Beloit, Wisconsin. His father was a Methodist circuit minister and farmer. He attended a preparatory academy before entering Beloit College, where he received a classical education in Greek and Latin, while becoming interested in natural science. While a student at Beloit he directed a church choir and participated in athletics and debate.

After graduation from Beloit College in 1866, Chamberlin worked for two years as a teacher and later principal in a high school near Beloit. He was married to Alma Wilson in 1867.

In 1868–1869, Chamberlin spent a year taking graduate courses, including geology, at the University of Michigan to strengthen his scientific background. Subsequently (1869–1873), he became professor of natural science at Whitewater Normal School in Wisconsin. He joined the Beloit faculty in 1873, where he was professor of geology, zoology, and botany. In 1873 he also became one of several part-time participants in conducting a comprehensive geological survey of Wisconsin. His geologic mapping work in southeastern Wisconsin, a region mantled with thick glacial deposits, led him to recognize multiple episodes of glaciation during the Pleistocene. His terminology for glacial stages in North America is still in use, with minor modifications.

In 1875 he started a business with his brother and sold spring water, a popular brand at the time.

In 1876 Chamberlin became chief geologist for the Wisconsin geological survey, supervising the completion of the survey and the publication of the four-volume report, for which he authored sections on glacial deposits, Paleozoic and Precambrian bedrock geology, lead-zinc ore deposits, artesian wells, and soils. The project brought him national attention and led to his appointment as head of the glacial division of the US Geological Survey in 1881. He later was president of the University of Wisconsin (1887 to 1892).

In 1890, and again in 1897, Chamberlin wrote &quot;The method of multiple working hypotheses&quot;, in which he advocated the importance of simultaneously evaluating several hypotheses, rejecting those that conflict with available data, and ending with the one hypothesis supported by the data. This stood in contrast to what he called the &quot;single ruling theory&quot;, which encouraged scientists to find supporting data and not challenge it with difficult tests. The paper is considered a landmark on the scientific method, was an inspiration for the approach called strong inference, and was reprinted in 1965.

In 1892 Chamberlin accepted the offer to organize a department of geology at the new University of Chicago, where he remained as a professor until 1918. From 1898 to 1914 he was president of the Chicago Academy of Sciences.

In 1899 Chamberlin wrote, &quot;An Attempt to Frame a Working Hypothesis of the Cause of Glacial Periods on an Atmospheric Basis&quot;, and developed at length the idea that changes in climate could result from changes in the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and wrote about climate actions:
Chamberlin was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1901 and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1903.

In 1905, Chamberlin and Forest Ray Moulton developed a theory of the formation of the Solar System that challenged the Laplacian nebular hypothesis. Their theory, the Chamberlin-Moulton planetesimal hypothesis, received favorable support for almost a third of a century, but passed out of favor by the late 1930s. It ultimately was discarded in the 1940s by the realization it was incompatible with the angular momentum of Jupiter. A portion of the theory stating that smaller objects — planetesimals — gradually collided to build the planets by accretion is still well-regarded. From his theories and other geological evidence he concluded that Earth was much older than assumed by Lord Kelvin (ca 100 million years) at the time. His speculations about the source of energy for such a long-lived Sun were prescient, involving the ability of the Sun to somehow extract energy from the inner structures of the atom.

In 1905, Chamberlin was elected to the American Philosophical Society.
In 1909, he and his son Rollin Thomas Chamberlin traveled to the East as members of the Oriental Educational Investigation Commission led by Ernest DeWitt Burton, and supported by John D. Rockefeller to reconnoiter the Eastern world as a potential site for the humanitarian projects of the nascent Rockefeller Foundation.

Chamberlin was awarded the inaugural Penrose Gold Medal of the Society of Economic Geologists in 1924, and the inaugural Penrose Medal of the Geological Society of America in 1927. He was president of the Geological Society of America in 1894.

Chamberlin remained active professionally up until his death in Chicago on November 15, 1928.

His papers are housed at the University of Chicago archives and the Beloit College archives. The Beloit College archives also contain the papers of his son, Rollin T. Chamberlin (1881-1948), who was also a geologist, and later chaired the geology department at the University of Chicago. There are buildings named for him on the Beloit College and University of Wisconsin–Madison campuses as well as a house in Burton-Judson Courts at The University of Chicago. The lunar crater Chamberlin and a crater on Mars are named in his honor. He is the namesake of Mount Chamberlin in California.

<text>Upper Holloway is a station on the Suffragette line of the London Overground in Holloway, north London. It is from (measured via Kentish Town and Mortimer Street Junction) and is situated between and . The current level of service is one train every 15 minutes in each direction except late evenings when it is half-hourly. The line is now electrified, and services are operated by 4 car Class 710 EMUs.

The station is a short walk along Holloway Road from on the Northern line. This is currently the most convenient interchange between the two lines, given as on the tube map and maps inside London Overground trains.
==Connections==
London Buses routes 17, 43, 263 and night routes N41 and N271 serve the station.

==Design==
Station facilities are basic with little at street level other than a few signs to indicate the presence of a station. Holloway Road passes over the line and steps and ramps for wheelchair users, buggies, bikes etc. on either side of the bridge lead directly down to the platforms. There are information points, CCTV cameras, information screens and loudspeakers. There are brick-built shelters on each platform and the station staff operate out of a small portable office.

Signs of the station&#x27;s past remain. The building which used to be the ticket office can be seen beside the south entrance (for trains towards Gospel Oak). A footbridge over the track remains, though this is closed and the only way over the track is via Holloway Road. The platforms were originally built to accommodate longer trains; the unused sections of platform remain, but are closed and in a poor state of repair. The signal box at the end of the platform is still in use.

In summer 2008, the station was repainted and re-signed in London Overground colours, with the green-painted staircase railings (for example) of the former Silverlink franchise giving way to Overground orange.

The station was formerly located between and station, which both closed in 1943. The cause of the closures was in part related to their close proximity to Upper Holloway station.

The station is in Travelcard Zone 2.

==Services==
All services at Upper Holloway are operated by London Overground using EMUs.

The typical off-peak service is four trains per hour in each direction between and . During the late evenings, the service is reduced to three trains per hour in each direction.

<text>[[Baseball]] at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] was held on two separate diamonds within the Helliniko Olympic Complex, from 15 to 25 August. For the second time in Olympic competition, professional baseball players were eligible to participate, though no active players from Major League Baseball were available.

The competition consisted of a preliminary round with each team playing all the other teams once, for a total of seven games. The top four teams at the end of this round advanced to the medals round. The medals round consisted of two semifinal games with the winners advancing to the gold medal game. The losing teams of the semifinals would play in the bronze medal game.

==Controversy==
Despite being the defending gold medalists, the United States did not make it to Athens after losing a qualifying game to Mexico, 1–0. The Americas Tournament, which decided which two teams from North America, South America and the Caribbean went to Athens, was single-elimination, when almost all other baseball tournaments are double-elimination. Canada eventually defeated Mexico to advance to the Olympics. The qualifying rounds were also scheduled in such a way that the United States could not even use minor-leaguers and had to rely on collegians instead. Many American ballplayers made it to Athens anyway, as members of the nascent Greek team, which featured only one player actually born in Greece.

Others took issue with the fact that three of the eight slots in the Olympics (including the hosts) were European, while the Americas and Asia (with much stronger baseball nations) got only two slots apiece. The absence of such teams as the USA, Mexico, the Dominican Republic and South Korea led to much media discussion.

The 2008 tournament changed the qualifying procedure; the United States qualified, as did Cuba and the host country, China.

==Results==
===Preliminary round===
The top four teams (Japan, Cuba, Canada and Australia) advanced to the semifinals. To determine the seed ranking of teams tied in the standings, the result of the two teams&#x27; game against each other was used. Japan therefore received first place due to the win over Cuba. In the semi-finals, Japan (#1) played Australia (#4) and Cuba (#2) played Canada (#3). The higher ranked team in each game was the home team.

<doc id="806727" wikidata="Q68209" url="?curid=806727" title="Johann Georg Jacobi">
<text>Johann Georg Jacobi (September 2, 1740 – January 4, 1814) was a German poet.

==Biography==
The elder brother of the philosopher Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, Johann Georg was born at Pempelfort near Düsseldorf. He studied theology at Göttingen and jurisprudence at Helmstedt, and in 1766 was appointed professor of philosophy in Halle. That year he made the acquaintance of J. W. L. Gleim, who, attracted by the young poet&#x27;s &quot;Poetische Versuche&quot; (1764), became his friend. A lively literary correspondence ensued between Gleim in Halberstadt and Jacobi in Halle. In order to have Jacobi near him, Gleim succeeded in procuring for him a prebendal stall at the cathedral of Halberstadt in 1769, and here Jacobi issued a number of anacreontic lyrics and sonnets that were not at all appreciated by the intellectuals of his time. Herder called Jacobi&#x27;s anacreontic poetry tasteless nonsense, Goethe criticised the jingling verses as only impressing women, and Lichtenberg ridiculed Jacobi as a &quot;doctorem jubilatum&quot;.

From 1774 to 1776, Gleim and Jacobi edited &quot;Iris&quot;, to which Goethe, Heinse, Lenz, and Sophie La Roche were contributors.
In 1784, Emperor Joseph II appointed Jacobi as professor of belles lettres at the university of Freiburg, the first Protestant professor of that institution. The city&#x27;s Catholic population and the teaching staff considered this a provocation, but Joseph was known for his erratic acts of forced Enlightenment.

Freiburg&#x27;s educated ladies appreciated the new professor for fine arts and science particularly during afternoon tea circles. At times more female admirers than students followed his lectures at the university. In 1791 the opposition of his male Catholic colleagues eventually vanished. They elected him as the first Protestant rector of the university. This happened again in 1803 during Napoleonic domination of the Breisgau when Jacobi&#x27;s excellent knowledge of French helped to overcome differences with the authorities.

Following Napoleon&#x27;s defeat Freiburg and the Breisgau were not restored to the Habsburgs but remained under the rule of the Grand Duchy of Baden. To make this acceptable to the local populace, Jacobi said of the grand dukes, who were descendants of the old Zaehringen dynasty, &quot;Now the two coat of arms during hundreds of years separated become one again and the Duke&#x27;s kindness will not only unite the territories but marry the souls of the good citizens alike.&quot;

When Jacobi died in 1814, an enormous crowd of dignitaries, students and citizens attended his funeral.

<doc id="806737" wikidata="Q8014340" url="?curid=806737" title="William Laurence Sullivan">
<text>William Laurence Sullivan (November 15, 1872—October 5, 1935) was an American Unitarian clergyman, prolific author and literary critic, whose &quot;Letters to His Holiness, Pope Pius X&quot; (1910), was the last work by a U.S. author to have been placed on Vatican&#x27;s list of prohibited books (&quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot;).

== Early life and education ==

A native of East Braintree, Massachusetts, Sullivan was born only a year after his parents, Patrick and Joanna (Desmon) Sullivan, had emigrated from the Irish town of Bandon in County Cork. The family subsequently moved to Quincy, Massachusetts. His father died when William was fourteen. He chose the confirmation name &quot;Laurence&quot; in honor of Lawrence of Rome, deacon and martyr. Intent on becoming a priest, he studied, between 1892 and 1896, at Boston College and St. John&#x27;s Seminary in the Brighton section of Boston, where he took the degree of Ph.B.

== Career ==
===Catholic priest===
He joined the Paulist community at Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. and received degrees of S.T.B. and S.T.L. He was ordained a priest in 1899. From 1899 to 1901 Sullivan served as a Paulist mission-preacher in Tennessee but returned to Washington due to poor health. He was assigned to parish work, teaching and writing for the &quot;Catholic Word&quot;. For several years he was Professor of Sacred Scripture and Theology at St. Thomas&#x27;s College.

He also contributed articles to the &quot;New York Sun&quot; and the &quot;New York Review&quot;, usually under a pseudonym. Under threat of dismissal for liberalism in his scripture courses, Sullivan requested to be relieved of his teaching duties and in 1908 was transferred back to parish ministry and mission work. In 1910 he resigned his pastorate in Austin, Texas, severed his ties with the Church, and wrote a polemic on papal authority, &quot;Letters to His Holiness Pope Pius X&quot;.

===Unitarian minister===

In October 1910, while living in Cleveland, Sullivan affiliated with the American Unitarian Association. From 1911 to 1912 he taught English and history at Felix Adler&#x27;s Ethical Culture School in New York. In 1912, he became a Unitarian minister, and served at All Souls Church in Schenectady, New York, moving, the following year, to New York City&#x27;s All Souls Church in Manhattan, where he remained for the next nine years, until 1922.

During this period he also spent six years as a book reviewer for one of the most prestigious of the city&#x27;s many daily newspapers, &quot;The Herald Tribune&quot;. Known for the eloquence of his sermons, he was much in demand as a speaker, especially after another of the city&#x27;s papers, &quot;The Evening Post&quot;, started publishing his sermons. An indefatigable preacher, he delivered over forty sermons during a single month in 1916, while traveling in the West Coast for the Church. In 1917 he received a D.D. from Meadville Theological School. Also in 1917 he was the Dudleian lecturer at Harvard.

At the close of his service in New York, he spent the following two years, 1922–24, preaching in 23 missions across the U.S. and Canada. During the 1920s, he led and participated in numerous theological discussions, disagreements and controversies regarding theism and the encroachment of humanism, which he opposed. From 1924 to 1928 he served as pastor in Missouri at St. Louis&#x27; Church of the Messiah, taught at Meadville Theological School and traveled as a lecturer.

William Laurence Sullivan married Frances Estelle Throckmorton in 1913, the daughter of Hugh William Throckmorton and Rebecca Ellen Upton, and the granddaughter of U.S. Representative Charles Horace Upton (R-VA), all of Washington, DC. The marriage lasted twenty-two years, until his death, in Germantown, Pennsylvania, six weeks prior to his 63rd birthday. In 1929 he had accepted the Germantown ministry, his final one, where, after six years as a pastor, he was memorialized as &quot;...towering in his ability to lift and to lead, yet warmly near in his tender concern for the smallest human suffering; a man oppressed by the problems of this world&#x27;s evil, but radiant in his faith in a Kingdom yet to be&quot;.

He was born in England, became a naturalized American citizen in 1809, and lived most of his life in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, including in the Thomas Sully Residence. He studied painting in England under Benjamin West. He painted in the style of Thomas Lawrence and has been referred to as the &quot;Sir Thomas Lawrence of America&quot;.

He produced over 2,300 paintings over his 70 year career. His subjects included United States presidents Thomas Jefferson, John Quincy Adams, and Andrew Jackson; Revolutionary War hero General Marquis de Lafayette, and Queen Victoria. In addition to portraits of wealthy patrons, he painted landscapes and historical pieces such as the 1819 &quot;The Passage of the Delaware&quot;. His work was adapted for use on United States coinage.

==Early life==
Sully was born in Horncastle, Lincolnshire, England in 1783 to actors Matthew Sully and Sarah Chester. In March 1792, the Sullys and their nine children emigrated to Charleston, South Carolina, where Thomas&#x27;s uncle Thomas Wade West managed a theater. Sully made his first appearance in the theater as a tumbler at the age of 11. After a brief apprenticeship to an insurance broker, who recognized his artistic talent, at about age 12 Sully began painting. He went to school with Charles Fraser and received informal instruction from him. He studied with his brother-in-law Jean Belzons (active 1794–1812), a French miniaturist, until they had a falling-out in 1799. Between 1801 and 1802, Sully lived in Norfolk, Virginia, the city from which his aunt Margaretta Sully West ran her theater and opera company.

==Career==

Sully became a professional painter at age 18 in 1801, while living in Norfolk, Virginia, with his brother Lawrence. By 1802, he and elder brother Lawrence Sully changed their base to Richmond, Virginia, where they continued to work together. In 1805, Thomas Sully married his brother&#x27;s widow, Sarah (Annis) Sully. He took on the rearing of Lawrence&#x27;s children.

Sully moved to New York in 1806. The next year, he studied portrait painting under Gilbert Stuart in Boston for three weeks. By 1808, he had settled in Philadelphia, where he resided for the remainder of his life. He received his American citizenship on May 17, 1809, and soon after traveled to London for nine months of study under Benjamin West, who had established his painting career in London. Sully also befriended the portrait painter Charles Bird King who was also studying under West in London.

West had stopped painting portraits and encouraged Sully to study the work of portrait artists he admired. Sully formed a friendship with Thomas Lawrence, whose influence was so profound that Sully came to be known as the &quot;Sir Thomas Lawrence of America.&quot; Sully returned to the U.S. in 1810.

Sully&#x27;s 1824 portraits of John Quincy Adams, who became President within the year, and the general Marquis de Lafayette, brought him widespread recognition. His Adams portrait is held in the National Gallery of Art, Washington. Many notable Americans of the day had their portraits painted by him. In 1837–1838, he was in London to paint Queen Victoria at the request of the St. George Society of Philadelphia. His daughter Blanche assisted him as the Queen&#x27;s &quot;stand-in,&quot; modeling the Queen&#x27;s costume when she was not available. One of Sully&#x27;s portraits of Thomas Jefferson is owned by the Jefferson Literary and Debating Society at the University of Virginia and hangs in that school&#x27;s rotunda. Another Jefferson portrait, this one head-to-toe, hangs at West Point, as does his portrait of General Alexander Macomb.

Sully taught portrait painting to Marcus Aurelius Root, who later became an internationally successful daguerreotypist. Other students of his included Jacob Eichholtz, Charles Robert Leslie and John Neagle.

Sully was a prolific artist and produced more than 2,300 paintings over the course of his seventy year career. His style resembles that of Thomas Lawrence.(cf. Rilla Evelyn Jackman &quot;AMERICAN ARTS&quot; 1928 pg. 61) Though best known as a portrait painter, Sully also made historical pieces and landscapes. An example of the former is the 1819 &quot;The Passage of the Delaware&quot;, now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

==Professional Connections and Honors==
Sully was one of the founding members of The Musical Fund Society in Philadelphia. He painted the portraits of many of the musicians and composers who were also members. In 1812, he was elected as an honorary member of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and served in multiple roles including as a member of the board of directors until 1831. In 1835, Sully was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society.

==Death and legacy==

Sully died in Philadelphia on November 5, 1872, and was interred in Laurel Hill Cemetery.

His book &quot;Hints to Young Painters&quot; was published posthumously.

His paintings are held and displayed permanently in many of the world&#x27;s leading art museums. Two of Sully&#x27;s portraits hang in the chambers of the Dialectic and Philanthropic societies of the University of North Carolina. Portraits, including that of President James K. Polk, were commissioned of notable alumni from the Societies. The obverse design of the United States Seated Liberty coinage, which began with the Gobrecht dollar in 1836 and lasted until 1891, was based on his work. The Sully painting &quot;Portrait of Anna and Harriet Coleman&quot; was sold at auction in 2013 for $145,000.

==Personal life==
Thomas and Sarah Sully had nine children together. Among the children were Alfred Sully, Mary Chester Sully (who married Sully&#x27;s protégé, the painter John Neagle), Jane Cooper Sully (who married a Mr. Darley), Blanche Sully, Rosalie Sully, and Thomas Wilcocks Sully.

His son, Alfred Sully, served as a brigadier general in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Through Alfred, Thomas Sully is the great-grandfather of Ella Deloria, the noted Yankton Dakota ethnologist and writer; the great-grandfather of artist Mary Sully (also known as Susan Mabel Deloria, 1896–1963); and the great-great-grandfather of Vine Deloria, Jr., Standing Rock Dakota scholar and author of &quot;Custer Died For Your Sins&quot; (1969), an American Indian civil-rights manifesto.

Sully was a great-uncle of Thomas Sully (1855–1939), the New Orleans–based architect who was named for him.

The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor.

<doc id="806789" wikidata="Q1754094" url="?curid=806789" title="Live in London (The Beach Boys album)">
<text>Live in London is a live album by American rock band the Beach Boys released by EMI in the UK in May 1970. When released in the US on November 15, 1976, the album was renamed Beach Boys &#x27;69 (The Beach Boys In London) via Capitol Records.

==History==
1968 was a difficult year for the Beach Boys in the USA, where their reputation had soured considerably. Yet enthusiasm for the group in Europe was still strong, as evidenced by the performance recorded in December while the group were finishing their &quot;20/20&quot; album.

After the surprise success of the &quot;Endless Summer&quot; and &quot;Spirit of America&quot; hits packages in 1974 and 1975, the Beach Boys had a resurgence of popularity in America, especially on the concert circuit. It was during this time that Capitol decided to issue a renamed edition of the album for the first time in the US. The reissue had art by rock artist Jim Evans, and a new title, Beach Boys &#x27;69. Besides the fact that the live performance was recorded in December 1968, the LP&#x27;s appearance added confusion to the marketplace as the group had recently issued a new, live double album—&quot;The Beach Boys in Concert&quot;—on their own Brother Records label, as part of a distribution deal with their new label, Reprise. Despite this, the record became a small chart success in the US, following the Top 10 placing of &quot;15 Big Ones&quot;, reaching #75 in the Fall of 1976 during a US chart stay of 10 weeks. The UK edition failed to chart.

Beach Boys observers believe that the group owed Capitol one more album (this may have been offered to fill such a role, instead of the &quot;Fading Rock Group Revival/Reverberation&quot; project), and that this release ended their relationship with that record label. When the Beach Boys&#x27; albums were remastered for CD in 1990 (and again in 2001), &quot;Live in London&quot; was paired with their 1964 live release &quot;Beach Boys Concert&quot;.

<text>Garfield and Friends is an American animated television series based on the comic strip &quot;Garfield&quot; by Jim Davis. The show aired on CBS as part of its Saturday morning children&#x27;s lineup from September 17, 1988, to December 10, 1994.

The show features animated story lines adapted from the comic strip &quot;Garfield&quot; and Davis&#x27;s other comic strip &quot;U.S. Acres&quot;. Mark Evanier was the show&#x27;s head writer. Lorenzo Music provided the voice of Garfield the cat, the strip&#x27;s title character, as he had done since &quot;Here Comes Garfield&quot; in 1982. Other voices present on the show included Thom Huge as Jon Arbuckle, Garfield&#x27;s human owner, and Gregg Berger as Odie the dog, also returning from prior &quot;Garfield&quot; animated media. Berger and Huge also respectively voiced Orson Pig and Roy Rooster in the &quot;U.S. Acres&quot; segments. 121 episodes were made, each consisting of two &quot;Garfield&quot; segments and one &quot;U.S. Acres&quot; segment and a &quot;Garfield Quickie&quot; at the end. All episodes have been released in the U.S. on five DVD sets by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment.

==Content==

&quot;Garfield&quot; is an American comic strip created by Jim Davis and started in 1978. The comic strip was first adapted into animated form in 1980 for the special &quot;The Fantastic Funnies&quot;, but reached a wider audience in 1982 with the television movie &quot;Here Comes Garfield&quot; on CBS. &quot;Garfield&quot; was adapted into eleven more television movies for the network, ending with &quot;Garfield Gets a Life&quot; in 1991. &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot; was also made for CBS, and debuted on the network in 1988. The network first announced in April 1988 that the show would be joining the network&#x27;s Saturday morning cartoon lineup alongside &quot;The Adventures of Raggedy Ann and Andy&quot; and &quot;Superman&quot;.

For most of its original run, &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot; was broadcast in a full-hour block. These episodes were later split into half-hour blocks for reruns, syndication, and home video. Each half-hour episode of the show typically consists of two segments adapted from &quot;Garfield&quot; and one adapted from &quot;U.S. Acres&quot;, a comic strip also created by Davis which began in 1986. These segments featured original story lines written using the characters from each strip, although both segments featured original characters not present in the source material as well. Nearly every episode of the show was written or co-written by Mark Evanier.

== Segments ==
=== &quot;Garfield&quot; ===
The segments adapted from &quot;Garfield&quot; feature the same primary characters as the comic strip. The title character, Garfield (voiced by Lorenzo Music), is a greedy and laid-back orange tabby cat. His owner is a human named Jon Arbuckle (voiced by Thom Huge), whose story lines include his failed attempts to date women and his frustrations of dealing with Garfield&#x27;s mischief. Jon is also the owner of Odie (voiced by Gregg Berger), a yellow dog who is often the subject of Garfield&#x27;s pranks. Other human characters in the &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot; segments include Dr. Liz Wilson (voiced by Julie Payne), who is Garfield&#x27;s veterinarian; Herman Post (voiced by Gregg Berger), a postal worker; and Binky the Clown (voiced by Thom Huge), the star of his own television show within the series. Non-human characters include Nermal (voiced by Desirée Goyette), a young kitten who often visits Garfield to antagonize him; the Buddy Bears (voiced by Howard Morris, Gregg Berger, and Thom Huge), three bears who are also the star of their own television show; Penelope Pussycat (voiced by Victoria Jackson), Garfield&#x27;s love interest who lives in an Italian restaurant; and Floyd (voiced by Gregg Berger), a mouse Garfield interacts with regularly.

=== &quot;U.S. Acres&quot; ===
The second comic strip adapted for the series, &quot;U.S. Acres&quot;, is set on a farm with various animals. The lead character is Orson (voiced by Gregg Berger), an imaginative pig who enjoys reading books. Accompanying him in these segments are Roy (voiced by Thom Huge), a loud-mouthed rooster who enjoys pranking the others; Wade (voiced by Howard Morris), a cowardly duck; Bo (voiced by Frank Welker) and Lanolin (voiced by Julie Payne), a pair of sheep who are brother and sister; and Booker and Sheldon (both voiced by Frank Welker), a pair of juvenile chickens. Orson&#x27;s brothers Mort, Gort, and Wart (respectively voiced by Frank Welker, Thom Huge, and Howard Morris) regularly serve as antagonists within the &quot;U.S. Acres&quot; segments. These segments would go by alternate titles internationally. In most of the world, these segments would be known as Orson&#x27;s Farm, however in Canada, the segments would be known as Orson&#x27;s Place.

==Production and cancellation==
Although the series was a success in the ratings at the time, it had become expensive to make and the Saturday morning cartoon format was in decline by the mid-1990s. Additionally, CBS as a whole was a distant third behind NBC and ABC for much of the series&#x27; run, and was in the middle of its cost-cutting by Laurence Tisch that resulted in CBS losing broadcasting rights to the National Football League for four years starting in 1994 and subsequently losing many longtime affiliates to Fox, which had outbid CBS for its NFL package. As a result, CBS proposed renewing the show for another season, albeit with significant budget cuts. Since the show did well in syndication, producers ended the series in 1994 with its seventh season.

==Episodes==

&quot;Garfield and Friends&quot; consists of 121 episodes (and 363 segments) spanning seven seasons in total.
==Reception and legacy==
At the time of the series&#x27; release, critical reviews on it were generally negative. Charles Solomon of &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote in 1988, &quot;Garfield has lost all his feline qualities and become a crabby little man in a cat suit. With more than 3,500 &quot;Garfield&quot; products on the market, does anyone really need to see more of the character?&quot; Gene Seymour of &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot; rated the show &quot;D−&quot;, saying that the show &quot;tries too hard to be hip&quot; and &quot;the jokes are flat.&quot;

However, retrospective reviews of the series have been much more favorable. The quality of &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot; when compared with other animated television series from the 1980s is considered by animation historian Jerry Beck to &quot;foreshadow the higher quality animation boom coming in the next decade.&quot; Hal Erickson says that &quot;&quot;Garfield and Friends&quot; rapidly became the hub around which the rest of CBS&#x27; morning lineup was built,&quot; and it &quot;seemed to get better with each passing season.&quot;

==Home media==
===Region 1===
In response to the financial success of &quot;&quot;, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released all seven seasons of &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot; to Region 1 DVD in five volume box sets, with each set having 24–25 episodes on three discs. Each set features an image of Garfield with a &quot;U.S. Acres&quot; character. These DVD sets show the original telecast versions, rather than the edited versions once seen in syndication and on cable networks. As of October 2013, these releases have been discontinued and are out of print.

On May 25, 2016, 9 Story Media Group announced that they had acquired worldwide distribution rights to &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot; and planned to remaster the series in HD and re-release it on DVD. On January 15, 2019, 9 Story Media Group (distributed by Public Media Distribution through its SkipRope label) released a best-of set entitled &quot;20 Garfield Stories&quot; on DVD in Region 1. They have subsequently begun re-releasing the series on DVD in Region 1 in complete season sets, season 1 was released on July 16, 2019, season 2 was released on November 5, 2019, and season 3 was released on October 27, 2020. A 6-disc set titled &quot;The Grumpy Cat Collection&quot;, containing the first three remastered seasons, was released on June 15, 2021.

==Syndication history==
&quot;Garfield and Friends&quot; has been syndicated on television around the world, beginning in the late 1980s and remaining on air in present day. In Latin America, it played on Cartoon Network from 1993 to 2005, on Boomerang from 2005 to 2008, on Warner Channel from 1998 to 2002, and on Tooncast from 2008 to 2016. Currently, all four of these networks have lost the rights to the show. Televisa&#x27;s Canal 5 also played the show for many years, from the mid-1990s to early 2000s.

In Australia, &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot; began syndication on Network Ten from 1988 to 1995. For the duration of its original run, it aired on cable television on Nickelodeon. Most recently it played on FOX8 from 2004 to 2006. But it came back and it was played on Eleven (Australian TV channel) from 2011 to 2014.

The United Kingdom and the United States remain the highest syndicators of the show. In the UK, it appeared on CITV from 1989 through 2002 (10 minutes per episode), on Sky1 from 1998 to 2002 (also 10 minutes per episode), and on Boomerang from 2003 to 2006 with Season 1 and 2 only. It also appeared on The Children&#x27;s Channel from 1993 to 1996 in reruns.

In Ireland, &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot; aired on RTÉ TWO Monday to Friday at 6pm (followed by &quot;Home and Away&quot;); it replaced RTÉ teen magazine programme &quot;Jo Maxi&quot; and was eventually replaced by &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

In the United States, the series appeared in syndication on local stations, distributed by The Program Exchange, between 1993 and 2006 (with broadcast stations running it into 2001). Only 73 of the 121 episodes were acquired by The Program Exchange. This was due to the producers selling syndication rights when the show was still on air and CBS wanting to keep the rights for certain episodes. Since the 73-episode syndication package performed well enough on stations already airing the show, acquiring the later episodes were deemed unnecessary. This syndication package also aired on TBS, TNT, and Cartoon Network from 1995 to 1997, and Nickelodeon from 1997 to 2000. In 2001, it appeared on Fox Family Channel (and later, ABC Family) until January 2002. Toon Disney aired it from 2003 to 2005. Boomerang carried it from 2006 to 2007, and again from 2019 to 2021. As of November 2018, Boomerang&#x27;s subscription video on demand site offers over 50 episodes of the series. Starz Encore also aired it on its family channel. The series later gained its own 24/7 Pluto TV channel on September 7, 2021.

&quot;Garfield and Friends&quot; aired in Canada on the cable TV channel YTV from 1993 to 2001. The show was broadcast on Teletoon&#x27;s 24-hour classic-animation network, Teletoon Retro, until the channel&#x27;s shutdown on September 1, 2015.

&quot;Garfield and Friends&quot; was also broadcast in New Zealand in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It aired on TV3 as part of a wrapper programme for children called &quot;The Early Bird Show&quot; by airing on weekday mornings and then on Saturday mornings when the show was shifted to only airing on weekend mornings. &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot; aired on that show up until its cancellation in 1992.

The series was played on television in Singapore first airing on Channel 5 from 1990 to 1992 and later on Kids Central from 2004 to 2005.

&quot;Garfield and Friends&quot; aired in South Africa on M-Net as part of their children&#x27;s block &quot;K-T.V.&quot; and was frequently shown numerous times. &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot; later aired on e.tv in the late 2000s.

==&quot;The Garfield Show&quot;==

A new CGI series premiered in 2009. Much of the creative team on &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot; also worked on this series, such as executive producer/creator Jim Davis and co-writer/voice director Mark Evanier.

Frank Welker replaced Lorenzo Music as the voice of Garfield due to Music&#x27;s death in 2001 (Welker was chosen due to being able to approximate Music&#x27;s voice well enough to fill in when Music was unable to provide Garfield&#x27;s voice), while Wally Wingert replaced Thom Huge as the voice of Jon Arbuckle due to Huge&#x27;s retirement in the same year. Other familiar voice actors have also appeared, some of them reprising their roles (such as Gregg Berger as Odie and Herman Post).

The series does not include the &quot;U.S. Acres&quot; series and characters, as well as other main characters from &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot;. In one episode, Binky the Clown is mentioned, to which Garfield then replies, &quot;My contract says he&#x27;s not allowed to be in this series.&quot;

<doc id="806802" wikidata="Q15524777" url="?curid=806802" title="Hilda Murrell">
<text>Hilda Murrell (3 February 1906 – on or before 24 March 1984) was a British rose grower, naturalist, diarist and campaigner against nuclear power and nuclear weapons. She was abducted and found murdered five miles from her home in Shropshire. Decades later there was a conviction based on DNA and fingerprint evidence and a confession. The case remains however controversial and subject to conspiracy theories that she was murdered by elements in the British government.

==Life==
Hilda Murrell was born on 3 February 1906 in Shrewsbury, in the county of Shropshire, England, and lived there all her life. The elder of two daughters, she came from a family of nurserymen, seedsmen and florists going back to 1837. Her grandfather Edwin Murrell established and ran Portland Nurseries until his death in 1908.

A gifted pupil at Shrewsbury Girls&#x27; High School where she was head girl, Murrell won a scholarship to Newnham College, Cambridge (1924–27). She graduated with an MA in English and French literature, and Modern and Mediaeval Languages.

===Rose growing===
Having no brothers, in 1928 Hilda was persuaded by her father Owen to join what was by then a successful and well-known family rose nursery and seed shop business run by him and his elder brother Edwin Foley Murrell. She quickly developed outstanding horticultural and business skills and took over as Director in 1937.

Her energy and organisational flair proved assets during World War II in her voluntary work for the care and resettlement of refugee children in Shropshire foster homes and schools, making lifelong friends of some of those she helped. Her fund-raising efforts included arranging recitals in Shrewsbury by such world-famous performers as the pianist Dame Myra Hess and violinist Jelly d&#x27;Arányi.

Under her management, Edwin Murrell Ltd enjoyed its final golden years from 1949 to 1970. She had become an internationally respected rose-grower and authority on rose species, old-fashioned varieties and miniature roses. The firm regularly won top awards at Chelsea and Southport Flower Shows as well as at the oldest annual flower show in the world in Shrewsbury. She sold roses to the Queen Mother and the Churchills and helped Vita Sackville-West design her White Garden at Sissinghurst Castle in Kent. Her annual rose catalogue was widely known and respected both for its information and elegant writing; and she also designed many gardens. In a final tribute, David C.H. Austin gained her approval to name a rose after her just three weeks before she was murdered.

===Environmental activism===
Walking, especially in hill country, was one of Murrell&#x27;s favourite leisure activities from an early age; and she had a passion for mountaineering and even rock climbing until arthritis limited her in later life. With this she developed a deep concern to preserve the countryside and wildlife of the Welsh Marches. She was a founder-member of the national Soil Association promoting organic horticulture, and of what is now the Shropshire Wildlife Trust; and in the 1970s she worked unpaid with her customary energy for the Shropshire branch of the Council for the Protection of Rural England.

On her retirement in 1970, the rose business was sold, and she had time and resources to devote to emerging environmental problems and threats to Shrewsbury&#x27;s rich architectural heritage. She also indulged her love affair with the Welsh Marches by building a Canadian cedarwood chalet high up on the Welsh side of Llanymynech Hill near Oswestry with a stunning view up the Tanat Valley to the Berwyn Mountains, where eventually her ashes were scattered.

She became an expert botanist, and extracts from her nature diaries were published in 1987 illustrated with her coloured photographs and botanical drawings. She was also deeply knowledgeable about megalithic monuments and the history of the British landscape. Other enthusiasms included antiques, spinning and weaving, and birdwatching; and she was a skilled cook and dressmaker, and a voracious reader.

Murrell&#x27;s central concern in later life was for the growing pollution crisis in the environment. She brought together carefully researched knowledge, a deep love of the natural world, and an ability to anticipate threats to it. She was also an indefatigable and fearless campaigner to bring these issues to the attention of those who had the power and responsibility to effect solutions.

===Anti-nuclear activism===
Having predicted the 1973 oil crisis, Murrell became increasingly concerned by the hazards posed by nuclear energy and weapons. She began to research this highly technical field. In 1978, she wrote a paper entitled &quot;What Price Nuclear Power?&quot; in which she challenged the economics of the civil nuclear industry. After the 1979 US accident at Three Mile Island, she turned her attention to safety aspects, and homed in on the problem of radioactive waste, the disposal of which she concluded was the industry&#x27;s Achilles&#x27; heel. In 1982, the Department of the Environment published a white paper (Cmnd 8607) on the British Government&#x27;s policy on radioactive waste management. Murrell, now in her late 70s, wrote a critique of it, which she developed into her submission &quot;An Ordinary Citizen&#x27;s View of Radioactive Waste Management&quot; to the first formal planning inquiry into a nuclear power plant in Britain, the Sizewell B Pressurised Water Reactor in Suffolk.

==Murder==
Murrell was scheduled to present her paper &quot;An Ordinary Citizen&#x27;s View of Radioactive Waste Management&quot; at the Sizewell B Inquiry, the first public planning inquiry into a new British nuclear power plant. On 21 March 1984 her home in Shrewsbury was burgled and a small amount of cash was taken. She was abducted in her own car, a white Renault 5, which many witnesses reported seeing being driven erratically through the town and past the police station during the lunch hour. The vehicle was soon reported abandoned in a country lane five miles outside Shrewsbury.

The West Mercia Police took another three days to find her body in a copse across a field from her car. She had been beaten and stabbed multiple times, but did not die from her injuries, instead succumbing to hypothermia. Her post-mortem was performed by Peter Acland who, together with the detective leading the case, Detective Chief Superintendent David Cole, wrote about this and other cases in &quot;The Detective and the Doctor: A Murder Casebook&quot;.

One theory put forward was that Murrell was murdered by the British intelligence service MI5 during an operation against nuclear protesters. Hilda was the aunt of Commander Robert Green, Royal Navy (Retired), a former naval intelligence officer who was one of a handful of people privy to details of the sinking of the Argentine ship the &quot;General Belgrano&quot;, by the nuclear submarine during the 1982 Falklands War.

Labour MP Tam Dalyell, pursuing Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher about the controversial sinking, added a second controversial theory about Murrell&#x27;s death when he announced in Parliament early on 20 December 1984 that British Intelligence had been involved. Until then, only her anti-nuclear work had been suspected as a political motive. Dalyell raised the issue in the Commons again in June 1985, having originally been prompted to take an interest in the murder by an anonymous phone call asking him to read an article by Judith Cook in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; of 9 November 1984, which discussed the case. Cook later wrote two books about Murrell&#x27;s murder, &quot;Who Killed Hilda Murrell?&quot; (1985) and &quot;Unlawful Killing&quot; (1994).

Her &quot;Times&quot; obituary, by Charles Sinker, ended: &quot;Her close friends remember her as a fierce but fundamentally gentle warrior, a Bunyan-like soul on a lonely and constant quest for the real path of the spirit. She died in tragic circumstances, alone in the empty countryside. It is an almost intolerable irony that a life so dedicated to peaceful pursuits, and to the pursuit of peace, should have been terminated by an act of mindless violence.&quot; She was cremated, nearly 5 months after her death, at Emstrey Crematorium, Shrewsbury and her ashes scattered at Maengwynedd, in Wales. A commemorative stone was unveiled in Tan-y-bryn, Llanrhaeadr in 2004 in a birch grove planted on the twentieth anniversary of her death. She is also commemorated on her family headstone in Longden Road Cemetery, Shrewsbury (section 149).

===Trial of Andrew George===
Local labourer Andrew George, who was 16 when Murrell was murdered, was arrested in June 2003 after a cold case review of the murder uncovered DNA and fingerprint evidence linking him with the crime.

In court, George admitted participating in the crime, but asserted that he had broken into the house with his brother, who had been responsible for the sexual assault and the killing. In May 2005, George was found guilty of kidnapping, sexually assaulting, and murdering Murrell. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a recommended minimum term of 15 years, that was likely to keep him in prison until at least 2018 and the age of 51. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; quoted the investigating officer as saying &quot;I told you so&quot;, but Tam Dalyell as saying it stretched the imagination to breaking point to suppose that the body, dumped on a Wednesday, could have lain undiscovered until the following Saturday, despite a search of the copse on the Thursday by a farmer and his dog: &quot;The two would have had no problem finding a dead rabbit, let alone the body of Hilda Murrell&quot;. The farmer (landowner) himself has always maintained that if the body had already been there the day after the kidnapping, he would have seen it. Furthermore, Robert Green was quoted as saying, &quot;There are many unanswered questions. I believe that the conviction may be unsafe.&quot; In June 2006, the Court of Appeal upheld the murder conviction, saying there was nothing unsafe about the verdict returned against George.

Green, however, disagreed, saying, &quot;There is evidence that Andrew George was in Hilda&#x27;s house; however, he could not drive and did not match the description of the driver of her car. Since the trial, which I sat through, I have found evidence that would have acquitted him, and that others were involved. Meanwhile, break-ins to my home in New Zealand and continuing interference with my phone and mail suggest that the British state security authorities fear what I might reveal about the case.&quot;

A former cellmate of George&#x27;s has claimed George admitted to committing the crime but said that he was not the only person involved, alleging that the burglary was committed by a gang of youths in search of money for drugs. In March 2012, Michael Mansfield QC called for an inquiry into what MI5 knew about the case.

==In culture==
Her murder was the subject of a song, &quot;The Rose Grower&quot; by the English group Attacco Decente. It can be found on their album &quot;The Baby Within Us Marches On&quot;.

She is mentioned in Ian Rankin&#x27;s novel &quot;The Impossible Dead&quot;.

&quot;Grace&quot;, the 1988 novel by Maggie Gee, implicates the British secret state in its fictional parallel to the murder of Hilda Murrell.

&quot;Resist the Atomic Menace&quot;, from Oi Polloi&#x27;s debut EP is also about her death.

David Peace&#x27;s novel &quot;GB84&quot; refers to the murder.

Robert Green&#x27;s book &quot;A Thorn in Their Side: The Hilda Murrell Murder&quot; was released in October 2011, which he claims, &quot;provides enough new evidence, known to both prosecution and defence but not put to the jury or Appeal Court judges in 2006, to re-open the coroner&#x27;s inquest into her death.&quot; In August 2013, John Blake Publishing released a new UK edition, with an additional penultimate chapter covering developments since the first NZ edition was published. It also featured a new foreword by Michael Mansfield QC and colour illustrations.

<text>Pierre Gringore (; 1475? – 1538) was a popular poet and playwright during the Renaissance in France.

== Biography ==

Pierre Gringore was born in Normandy, at Thury-Harcourt, but the exact date and place of his death are unknown. His first work was &quot;Le Chasteau de Labour&quot; (1499), an allegorical poem.

His birth name, that Pierre Gringore himself chose to modify, was Gringon.

From 1506 to 1512, he worked as an actor-manager and playwright in Paris. He is best known for the satirical plays he wrote during this period for the &quot;Confrérie des Enfants Sans Souci&quot; or &quot;Sots&quot;, a famous comedic acting troupe. While in Paris he became a favorite of Louis XII, who employed the troupe to poke fun at the Papacy. Tension between France and Rome, including a revival of the Investiture Controversy, was building during this period, eventually resulting in the Italian Wars and the formation of the Catholic League in 1511. Gringore wrote several scathing indictments of Pope Julius II, for example, &quot;La Chasse du cerf des cerfs&quot; (1510) and the trilogy &quot;Le Jeu du Prince des Sots et Mère Sotte&quot;.

Following his Parisian period, he wrote a verse drama mystery play about the life of his patron&#x27;s ancestor St Louis IX, &quot;Vie Monseigneur Sainct Loys par personnaiges&quot; (1514), for the Paris guild of stonemasons and carpenters. Some scholars consider this to be his masterpiece.

== Personal life ==
After Francis I took the throne, he put severe restrictions on plays and playwrights in place. Gringore moved to Lorraine in 1518, where he married Catherine Roger.

=== Religion ===
Despite the various works in which he attacked the papacy, Gringore was a devout Catholic. One of his later works, &quot;Blazon des hérétiques&quot; (1524), attacks heretics and leaders of the Protestant Reformation, up to and including Martin Luther.

== In popular culture ==
=== &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot; ===
A loosely fictionalized vision of Gringore, referred to as Pierre Gringoire, appears as an important character in Victor Hugo&#x27;s novel &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot; and films based on it, except the 1996 animated Disney film (in which his character is combined with Captain Phoebus) and its 2002 direct-to-video sequel. He is probably best known from Hugo&#x27;s book, in which he was inspired by and bears some resemblance to the historical Gringore.

==== In Victor Hugo&#x27;s original novel ====

During the Feast of Fools, which is when the story begins, a crowd of people arrive at the Grand Hall of the Palace of Justice where Gringoire introduces them to a play written by him, but is soon interrupted by Clopin Trouillefou, the King of Truands. When the crowd leaves the play and celebrate the crowning of Quasimodo as the Pope of Fools, Gringoire feels disappointed. Later, when he sees Esmeralda dancing near the fire, he forgets about his failed play and falls in love with her.

Later that night, Gringoire follows Esmeralda walking until he witnesses Quasimodo attempting to kidnap her under Archdeacon Claude Frollo&#x27;s orders, followed by her being saved and the hunchback being captured by Captain Phoebus and his guards. Later, he sees some Truands come toward him and accidentally trespasses into the Court of Miracles, the home of the Truands. Clopin accuses him of entering the Court without permission, and gives him a test in order to save his life: to take a purse from the pocket of a suspended dummy hung all over with tiny bells without making the bells sound. When Gringoire fails the test, he is about to be hanged under Clopin&#x27;s orders until Clopin gives him another option to save his life: to marry a Roma woman present in the Court. Esmeralda comes to Gringoire&#x27;s rescue and accepts him as her husband.

Afterwards, Gringoire and Esmeralda have a wedding night together, during which he finds out that Esmeralda doesn&#x27;t truly love him and merely tolerates him, and that he cannot touch her ever. In fact, the one whom Esmeralda truly loves is Captain Phoebus. Likewise, Gringoire becomes more fond of Esmeralda&#x27;s pet goat, Djali, than of Esmeralda herself.

Later in the story, Gringoire breaks into the cathedral and rescues Esmeralda along with Frollo, whose identity is hidden behind a cloak. The trio leaves Notre Dame by boat to look for safety from the guards who are after Esmeralda. When the trio hear the voice of a guard, Gringoire abandons Esmeralda and instead saves her goat Djali, resulting in Frollo&#x27;s capturing Esmeralda and her death. At the end of the story, Gringoire becomes a writer of tragedies and is able to receive better attention from audiences.

==== Adaptations ====
Among the actors who have played Gringoire over the years in each adaptation of the novel are:
=== Other ===
Gringoire is also the main character in the short drama &quot;Gringoire&quot; (1866) by Théodore de Banville.

The short story &quot;La chèvre de M. Seguin&quot; appearing in &quot;Lettres de mon moulin&quot; (1869) by Alphonse Daudet takes the form of a letter addressed to Gringoire. The story within the letter is written as an object lesson intended to convince Gringoire to accept the post of journalist for a Parisian newspaper.

<doc id="806837" wikidata="Q940425" url="?curid=806837" title="Surf's Up (album)">
<text>Surf&#x27;s Up is the 17th studio album by American rock band the Beach Boys, released on August 30, 1971 on Brother/Reprise. It received largely favorable reviews and reached number 29 on the U.S. record charts, becoming their highest-charting LP of new music in the U.S. since 1967. In the UK, &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; peaked at number 15, continuing a string of top 40 records that had not abated since 1965.

The album&#x27;s title and cover artwork (a painting based on the early 20th-century sculpture &quot;End of the Trail&quot;) are an ironic, self-aware nod to the band&#x27;s early surfing image. Originally titled &quot;Landlocked&quot;, the album took its name from the closing track &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;, a song originally intended for the group&#x27;s unfinished album &quot;Smile&quot;. Most of &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; was recorded from January to July 1971. In contrast to the previous LP &quot;Sunflower&quot;, Brian Wilson was not especially active in the production, which resulted in thinner vocal arrangements.

Lyrically, &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; addresses environmental, social, and health concerns more than the group&#x27;s previous releases. This was at the behest of newly recruited co-manager Jack Rieley, who strove to revamp the group&#x27;s image and restore their public reputation following the dismal reception to their recent albums and tours. His initiatives included a promotional campaign with the tagline &quot;it&#x27;s now safe to listen to the Beach Boys&quot; and the appointment of Carl Wilson as the band&#x27;s official leader. The record also included Carl&#x27;s first major song contributions: &quot;Long Promised Road&quot; and &quot;Feel Flows&quot;.

Two singles were issued in the U.S.: &quot;Long Promised Road&quot; and &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;. Only the former charted, when it was reissued with the B-side &quot;Til I Die&quot; later in the year, peaking at number 89. In 1993, &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; was ranked number 46 in &quot;NME&quot;″s list of the &quot;Top 100 Albums&quot; in history. In 2000, it ranked number 230 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. Session highlights, outtakes, and alternate mixes from the album were collected for the 2021 compilation &quot;Feel Flows&quot;.

==Background==

On the evening of July 29, 1970, Brian Wilson, accompanied by Mike Love and Bruce Johnston, granted his first-ever full-length radio interview to KPFK DJ John Frank, also known as Jack Rieley. In the interview, Wilson mentioned that although he is &quot;proud of the group and the name&quot;, he felt that &quot;the clean American thing has hurt us. And we&#x27;re really not getting any kind of airplay today.&quot; Among other topics, Wilson stated that the group was not &quot;putting enough spunk in our production and I don&#x27;t know who to blame. ... Another thing is that we haven&#x27;t done enough to change our image, though. ... we sort of operate a democracy thing in our productions. Maybe that&#x27;s the problem. I don&#x27;t know.&quot; The subject eventually turned to &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;, an unreleased song from the band&#x27;s unfinished album &quot;Smile&quot;. Brian said he did not want to release the song because it was &quot;too long&quot;.

On August 8, Rieley sent the band a six-page memo that explained how to stimulate &quot;increased record sales and popularity&quot;. At the end of August, the group&#x27;s latest record &quot;Sunflower&quot; was released as their first album on Reprise Records. It became the worst-selling album in the group&#x27;s history. Band promoter and co-manager Fred Vail remembered one meeting with the band in which &quot;we were talking about ... &quot;Sunflower&quot; not charting, and they were wondering why. I said to them, &#x27;Listen, this is a phase right now. If you stay the course, your real audience won&#x27;t forget you. They won&#x27;t desert you.&#x27; But the Beach Boys really didn&#x27;t believe in themselves.&quot; Vail was soon replaced by Rieley, primarily at the instigation of Love and Johnston.

Some of Rieley&#x27;s earliest initiatives were to end the group&#x27;s practice of wearing matching stage uniforms and to appoint Carl Wilson as the band&#x27;s official leader. The group spent the majority of September and October rehearsing for upcoming concerts. On October 3, at the invitation of Van Dyke Parks, the band performed two sets at the eighth annual Big Sur Folk Festival in California to an audience of 6,000. According to music historian Keith Badman, the performances &quot;help[ed] to establish the group&#x27;s image in the eyes of the rock hierarchy, and they were subsequently &#x27;rediscovered&#x27; as an important live act.&quot; Biographer David Leaf wrote that the concert inspired what was effectively an apologetic review from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; co-founder Jann Wenner, who previously criticized the band for pulling out of the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival. A rumor circulated among news outlets that Brian was then writing music with Parks for an upcoming Beach Boys television special, &quot;H-2-0&quot;.

In early November, Brian temporarily rejoined the touring band in playing four dates at the Whisky a Go Go. The group had not played a concert in Los Angeles since 1966, while Brian had not performed with the touring group since early 1970, when he briefly filled in for Love. These performances served as a warm-up to the band&#x27;s second major tour of the year, which lasted from November 19 to December 20, around the UK and Europe. Guitarist Ed Carter and keyboardist Daryl Dragon accompanied the band on this tour, along with supporting act the Flame. Reports from this period suggested that the group was planning to move from Los Angeles to Britain once their recording commitments were finished. From January to early April 1971, they worked intermittently on their second album for Reprise.

==Production and style==
&quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; was recorded between January and July 1971, with the exception of a few tracks. After the release of &quot;Sunflower&quot;, band engineer Stephen Desper assembled a collection of songs consisting mostly of outtakes deemed suitable for a follow-up LP, which he labelled &quot;Second Brother Album&quot;. Rieley later called these selections &quot;forgettable&quot; and said that he was &quot;totally perplexed ... I met with [Warner executive] Mo Ostin, a true Brian Wilson fan, at Warner Brothers, who listened to the songs, and he declared: &#x27;No way.&#x27;&quot;

Rieley encouraged them to write songs with more socially conscious and topical lyrics, although he stated in a 2013 interview, &quot;It was not part of a master plan. ... We never had any &#x27;What are we gonna write about?&#x27; meeting. Never once did anything like that ever occur.&quot; He assigned the project the brief working title of &quot;Landlocked&quot; to represent &quot;a demarcation line, separating striped-shirted bullshit that had become irrelevant, an object of public scorn, from artistry, creativity and great new songs.&quot; An album cover was designed with this title, featuring white sans-serif letters printed atop a photograph of a dark field.

The &quot;Landlocked&quot; cover was ultimately discarded in favor of a different design. Rieley said that the final cover &quot;was something that caught my eye at an antique record shop near Silver Lake. It was a painting and I bought it. It reminded me a bit of the Brother Records logo, but it was different.&quot; Conversely, Desper recalled that a print of a painting of the &quot;End of the Trail&quot;, &quot;use[d] to hang in Murry Wilson&#x27;s office behind his desk, as Brian recalls from his childhood. Brian always like[d] the painting as it was part of Denny&#x27;s, Carl&#x27;s and his youth.&quot; &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; was the first album for which the group printed the lyrics of each song on the record sleeve.

In 1974, Rieley stated that his growing involvement with the songwriting process attracted the ire of Love, Johnston, and Al Jardine, who &quot;tried to force me to march into Mo Ostin&#x27;s and sell him on their 1969 track &#x27;Loop De Loop&#x27;&quot;. I refused and Brian, Dennis, and Carl backed me up.&quot; Due to Brian&#x27;s reduced involvement, the vocal arrangements were not as dense as those for &quot;Sunflower&quot;. Johnston recalled, &quot;It was strange to be doing vocal arrangements to make it sound like the Beach Boys when we were the Beach Boys. That&#x27;s a little weird to me.&quot;

==Songs==
&quot;Long Promised Road&quot; and &quot;Feel Flows&quot; were Carl&#x27;s first significant solo compositions and were recorded almost entirely by himself. &quot;Student Demonstration Time&quot; (a topical reworking of Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller&#x27;s R&amp;B classic &quot;Riot in Cell Block Number 9&quot;) and the environmental anthem &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Near the Water&quot; found Love and Jardine embracing the group&#x27;s new socially conscious direction.

&quot;Til I Die&quot; was a song Brian had been working on since mid-1970. It was written while he was suffering from an existential crisis, and he took weeks to refine the arrangement, using an electronic drum machine and crafting a harmony-driven, vibraphone and organ-laden background. &quot;A Day in the Life of a Tree&quot;, written by Brian and Rieley, is about a tree succumbing to the effects of environmental pollution; the accompaniment includes harmonium, an antique pump organ, and a smaller pipe organ.

Johnston said that he wrote &quot;Disney Girls (1957)&quot; &quot;because I saw so many kids in our audiences being wiped out on drugs&quot; and wanted to capture the feeling of an era in which people were &quot;a little naive but a little healthier.&quot; Jardine also contributed &quot;Take a Load Off Your Feet&quot;, a &quot;Sunflower&quot; outtake, and &quot;Lookin&#x27; at Tomorrow (A Welfare Song)&quot;, both co-written with longtime friend Gary Winfrey. Biographer Timothy White wrote that the latter song was &quot;a poignant mini-soliloquy from a jobless rounder, seems like a coda to &#x27;Long Promised Road,&#x27; the pioneer busted in his starry-eyed ambitions but still &#x27;looking at tomorrow&#x27; for fresh potential.&quot; Jardine said that it was &quot;actually an old folk song&quot; to which he &quot;rewrote the lyrics to reflect the times&quot;.

Rieley had asked Brian about including &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; on &quot;Landlocked&quot;, and in early June, Brian suddenly gave approval for Carl and Rieley to finish the song. Carl overdubbed a new vocal in the song&#x27;s first part, the original backing track dating from November 1966. The second movement consisted of a December 1966 solo piano demo recorded by Brian, augmented with vocal and Moog synthesizer overdubs. Johnston recalled, &quot;We ended up doing vocals to sort of emulate ourselves without Brian Wilson, which was kind of silly.&quot; With the song completed, &quot;Landlocked&quot; was given the new title of &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;.

==Leftover material==

Dennis Wilson&#x27;s songs &quot;4th of July&quot; and &quot;(Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Nice to) Live Again&quot; were recorded in early 1971 but left off the record. In a September 1971 interview, Dennis stated, &quot;I have a belief in my music. And it sounds nothing like it should on the album – it should have a flow from one song to another ... It didn&#x27;t sound like The Beach Boys. They thought it did. I said ‘Bullshit’ and pulled my songs off.&quot; According to Rieley, the absence of any Dennis songs on &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; was for two reasons: to quell political infighting within the group concerning the album&#x27;s share of Wilson-brother songs, and because Dennis wanted to save his songs for a solo album, projected for release in 1971.

In 1993, &quot;4th of July&quot; was included on the box set &quot;Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys.&quot; &quot;(Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Nice to) Live Again&quot; was written with Stanley Shapiro. According to Beach Boys biographer Jon Stebbins, Dennis had wanted the song to close the record, following Til I Die&quot;, but Carl objected. In 2013, it was released on the box set &quot;Made in California&quot;, along with a 1974 recording of &quot;Barnyard Blues&quot;, a song that Dennis had composed during the &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; sessions. Dennis also recorded &quot;Barbara&quot;, a piano demo named after his then-girlfriend, and a track called &quot;Old Movie&quot;. &quot;Barbara&quot; was released in 1998 for the &quot;Endless Harmony Soundtrack&quot; while &quot;Old Movie would be released on the 2021 box set &quot;Feel Flows.&quot;

Other outtakes include Brian&#x27;s &quot;My Solution&quot; and &quot;H.E.L.P. Is On the Way&quot;.&quot;H.E.L.P. Is On the Way&quot; would later be reused for the unreleased 1977 album &quot;Adult/Child&quot; and saw release on the 1993 box set &quot;Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys.&quot; According to singer Terry Jacks, the group asked him to be their producer for a session. On July 31, 1970, they attempted a rendition of the Jacques Brel/Rod McKuen song &quot;Seasons in the Sun&quot;, but the session went badly, and the track was never finished. Jacks later had a hit with his own version of the song in 1974. Afterward, Mike Love told an interviewer: &quot;We did record a version [of &#x27;Seasons&#x27;] but it was so wimpy we had to throw it out. ... It was just the wrong song for us. I&#x27;m glad Terry had a hit with it.&quot; Love&#x27;s &quot;Big Sur&quot;, recorded in August 1970, was later remade in a different time signature for the 1973 album &quot;Holland&quot;. In March 1971, Carl recorded a Moog synthesizer sound collage titled &quot;Telephone Backgrounds (On a Clear Day)&quot;. &quot;My Solution&quot;, &quot;Seasons in the Sun&quot;, and the original version of &quot;Big Sur&quot; was released on the 2021 box set &quot;Feel Flows&quot;. “Telephone Backgrounds” was partially released on a separate digital download in 2021.

==Release==

Rieley arranged for the group to appear in a series of commercials with the tagline &quot;It&#x27;s now safe to listen to the Beach Boys.&quot; He also arranged a guest appearance at a Grateful Dead concert at Bill Graham&#x27;s Fillmore East in April 1971 to foreground the band&#x27;s transition into the counterculture. For their performances this year, the Beach Boys enlisted a full horn section and additional percussionists. A journalist who attended the show later reported that Bob Dylan, who was watching from the sound booth, remarked aloud, &quot;You know, they&#x27;re pretty fucking good.&quot; Contrary to what is later written of the show, the Grateful Dead&#x27;s audience was unfavorable toward the Beach Boys&#x27; appearance. On May 1, the band performed at &quot;The Peace Treaty Celebration Rock Show&quot;, an anti-war rally concert organized by the Mayday Collective, with approximately 500,000 people in attendance. Footage of the band performing &quot;Student Demonstration Time&quot; later appeared in the 1985 documentary &quot;An American Band&quot;.

On May 24, &quot;Long Promised Road&quot; (B-side &quot;Deirdre&quot;) was issued as the lead single, becoming their sixth consecutive U.S. single that failed to chart. That same month, Dennis accidentally punched his hand through a glass window, severing nerves and tendons. The injury left him unable to play drums for the band, and so he was replaced by the Flame&#x27;s Ricky Fataar. Dennis continued to make occasional appearances at concerts, singing or playing keyboards. In July, the American music press rated the Beach Boys &quot;the hottest grossing act&quot; in the country, alongside Grand Funk Railroad. On July 7, the film &quot;Two-Lane Blacktop&quot;, co-starring Dennis, made its worldwide premier in New York City. Despite critical acclaim, the film was largely unnoticed by cinema-goers.

&quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; was released on August 30 to more public anticipation than the Beach Boys had had for several years. Aided by some FM radio exposure, it outperformed &quot;Sunflower&quot; commercially and was their best selling album in years. On September 6, &quot;Time&quot; reported that the album was &quot;doing well enough. Barely out, it is fast approaching $250,000 in sales.&quot; From September 22 to October 2, the band toured the eastern US, but the performances received mixed reviews. Their setlists included every song from the album except Til I Die&quot; and &quot;A Day in the Life of a Tree&quot;. Dennis also played solo piano renditions of his unreleased songs &quot;Barbara&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot;.

On October 28, the Beach Boys were the featured cover story on that date&#x27;s issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. It included the first part of a lengthy two-part interview, titled &quot;The Beach Boys: A California Saga&quot;, conducted by journalists Tom Nolan and David Felton. Unusually, the story devoted minimal attention to the group&#x27;s music, and instead focused on the band&#x27;s internal dynamics and history, particularly around the period when they fell out of step with the 1960s counterculture. At the end of the month, &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; peaked on the U.S. charts at number 29, becoming their highest-charting album there since &quot;Wild Honey&quot; (1967).

In the UK, &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; was released by EMI&#x27;s Stateside label in October and peaked at number 15. Rieley was unhappy with the delay, remarking that the album &quot;sold more import copies than they sold of British pressings.&quot; The UK singles, &quot;Long Promised Road&quot; (B-side &quot;Deirdre&quot;) and &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Near the Water&quot; (B-side &quot;Student Demonstration Time&quot;), failed to chart. In November, &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; (B-side &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Near the Water&quot;) was released as the last U.S. single and failed to chart.

==Contemporary reviews==
&quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; received generally favorable reviews. &quot;Time&quot;″s reviewer described it as &quot;one of the most imaginatively produced LPs since last fall&#x27;s &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; by George Harrison and Phil Spector&quot;. A &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer stated: &quot;the Beach Boys stage a remarkable comeback ... an LP that weds their choral harmonies to progressive pop and which shows youngest Wilson brother Carl stepping into the fore of the venerable outfit.&quot; In his review for the magazine, Arthur Schmidt was effused with the record, highlighting &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; and &quot;Disney Girls&quot; as his favorite songs, and wrote: &quot;This is a good album, probably as good as &quot;Sunflower&quot;, which is terrific ... It is certainly the most original in that it has contributed something purely its own.&quot; Richard Williams of &quot;The Times&quot; called the record &quot;mostly very good&quot; in his review;&quot; in another review of the album from 1972, he wrote that it &quot;won&#x27;t disappoint anyone at all ... they&#x27;ve produced an album which fully backs up all that&#x27;s recently been written and said about them.&quot; &quot;NME&quot;″s Richard Green called it a &quot;very good album, very different from anything they&#x27;ve done before.&quot;

Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; was less impressed. While highlighting &quot;Take a Load Off Your Feet&quot; and &quot;Disney Girls (1957)&quot;, he found most of the other songs forgettable and the album the group&#x27;s worst since 1968&#x27;s &quot;Friends&quot;, before writing, &quot;Van Dyke Parks&#x27;s wacked-out lyricist meandering is matched by the sophomoric spiritual quest of Jack Rieley, and the music drags hither and yon.&quot; In &quot;The Rag&quot;, Metal Mike Saunders lamented that most of the press furor over the Beach Boys&#x27; reputed comeback &quot;has been rubbish&quot; and opined that &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; suffered from the same issues as &quot;Sunflower&quot;, namely &quot;horrendous production and engineering&quot; and a lack of &quot;focus&quot;. He wrote, &quot;At any rate, the Brian Wilson Enigma remains unanswered, and the Beach Boys without him are just another rock group.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Geoffrey Cannon felt that the album was inconsistent.

In a 1971 interview, Paul McCartney praised the album, commenting while discussing contemporary releases, &quot;Have you got the new Beach Boys album, &quot;Surf’s Up&quot;? That&#x27;s good, too.&quot;

==Aftermath==
&quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; was the last Beach Boys album recorded with Bruce Johnston until 1979&#x27;s &quot;L.A. (Light Album)&quot;. He later criticized the record: &quot;To me, &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; is, and always has been, one hyped up lie! It was a false reflection of The Beach Boys and one which Jack [Rieley] engineered right from the start. ... It made it look like Brian Wilson was more than just a visitor at those sessions. Jack made it appear as though Brian was really there all the time.&quot; In another interview, Johnston said: &quot;All I can say is that at the beginning, I thought that what he was trying to do was absolutely right on the money. He helped the band become aware of what our niche was in pop music.&quot;

==Retrospective assessments==

Music critic John Bush wrote &quot;[Most of the] songs are enjoyable enough, but the last three tracks are what make &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; such a masterpiece.&quot; &quot;Mojo&quot; critic Ross Bennett regarded &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; as &quot;the definitive version&quot; of the &quot;Smile&quot; recordings, &quot;with those crystalline vocals imbuing Parks&#x27; cryptic verses with a grace and simplicity missing from the 2004 reboot&quot;. Keith Phipps from &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; called it &quot;the darkest album of the group&#x27;s career, a record that also spotlighted a growing social conscience&quot;.

In 1974, the staff of &quot;NME&quot; ranked &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; number 96 in their list of the &quot;Top 100 Albums&quot; of all time. When the magazine surveyed its writers again in 1993, the album&#x27;s position rose to number 46. In 2000, the record was voted number 230 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. The record is also listed in the musical reference book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2004, &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; was ranked number 61 on &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s list of &quot;The Top 100 Albums of the 1970s&quot;. Contributor Dominique Leone wrote: 

Conversely, Scott Schinder wrote in &quot;Icons of Rock&quot; (2006) that &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; &quot;lacked the solid group dynamic that had elevated &quot;Sunflower&quot;&quot; despite two &quot;impressive songwriting contributions from Carl&quot;. James E. Perone, writing in &quot;The 100 Greatest Bands of All Time&quot; (2015), opined that &quot;the album&#x27;s lyrical themes are so wide ranging that the social commentary tended to get somewhat lost, and the year 1971 was late enough in the counterculture era that &#x27;Student Demonstration Time&#x27; and &#x27;A Day in the Life of a Tree&#x27; seem like a case of too little, too late.&quot; Stebbins opined that the album suffered from a lack of Dennis songs and was not as strong as &quot;Sunflower&quot; in its totality. &quot;Record Collector&quot;″s Jamie Atkins said that the lack of Dennis songs was balanced by the strong offerings from Carl, although Rieley&#x27;s &quot;awkward wordplay ... was rather less clever than he had perhaps intended. Happily, they did not detract from the quality of the songs:&quot;

John Wetton named &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; his favorite prog album of all-time, elaborating: &quot;The summer of &#x27;71 had so many musical milestones ... but &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; was a revelation. I was in Family, a major player in the first wave of British progressive bands, but this collection from the iconic California surf-pop band shifted my parameters, blurring all the boundaries of my musical vocabulary. ... And the cover? Mega prog!&quot;

==&quot;Feel Flows&quot;==

In 2021, expanded editions of &quot;Sunflower&quot; and &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; were packaged within &quot;Feel Flows&quot;, a box set that includes session highlights, outtakes, and alternate mixes drawn from the two albums. The set also includes the first ever releases of the &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;-era outtakes &quot;Big Sur&quot; (1970 version), &quot;Sweet and Bitter&quot;, &quot;My Solution&quot;, &quot;Seasons in the Sun&quot;, &quot;Baby Baby&quot;, &quot;Awake&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s a New Day&quot;.

<text>was a Japanese Buddhist monk and businessman credited with founding the eponymous Sumitomo Group. He was an 8th generation descendant of Sumitomo Tadashige. Sumitomo Tadashige said to be 22nd generation descendant of Taira no Takamochi from Kanmu Heishi clan who was a grandson of 50th Emperor of Japan, Emperor Kanmu. Originally, he was a Buddhist monk. During his lifetime, there were mainly two sects of Buddhist monks in Japan. Masatomo belonged to one of the two which later ceased to exist. Reluctant to join the other group of Buddhist monks, he turned to business to make a living. He started his business by selling books and medicines at first in a bookshop in Kyoto circa 1615.

<text>Hydrodamalis is a genus of extinct herbivorous sirenian marine mammals. It included the Steller&#x27;s sea cow (&quot;Hydrodamalis gigas&quot;), the Cuesta sea cow (&quot;Hydrodamalis cuestae&quot;), and the Takikawa sea cow (&quot;Hydrodamalis spissa&quot;). The fossil genus &quot;Dusisiren&quot; is regarded as the sister taxon of &quot;Hydrodamalis&quot;: together, the two genera form the dugong subfamily Hydrodamalinae. They were the largest member of the order Sirenia, whose only extant members are the dugong (&quot;Dugong dugon&quot;) and the manatees (&quot;Trichechus&quot; spp.). They reached up to in length, making the Steller&#x27;s sea cow among the largest mammals other than whales to have existed in the Holocene epoch. Steller&#x27;s sea cow was first described by Georg Wilhelm Steller,

Cuesta by Daryl Domning, and Takikawa by Hitoshi Furusawa. The Steller&#x27;s sea cow was the only member of the genus to survive into modern times, and, although had formerly been abundant throughout the North Pacific, by the mid 1700s, its range had been limited to a single, isolated population surrounding the uninhabited Commander Islands. It was hunted for its meat, skin, and fat by fur traders, and was also hunted by aboriginals of the North Pacific coast, leading to its and the genus&#x27; extinction 27 years after discovery. The Cuesta sea cow along with the Takikawa sea cow were probably extinct at the end of the Pliocene due to the onset of the Ice Ages and the subsequent recession of seagrasses—their main food source.

<text>Christian Friedrich Wilhelm Jacobs (October 6, 1764 – March 30, 1847) a German classical scholar, was born at Gotha. After studying philology and theology at Jena and Göttingen, in 1785, Friedrich Jacobs (as he is known), became a teacher in the gymnasium of his native town, and in 1802 was appointed to an office in the public library. In 1807 he became classical tutor in the lyceum of Munich, but, disgusted at the attacks made upon him by the old Bavarian Catholic party, who resented the introduction of north German teachers, he returned to Gotha in 1810 to take charge of the library and the numismatic cabinet. He remained in Gotha till his death on 30 March 1847.

Jacobs was an extremely successful teacher; he took great interest in the affairs of his country, and was a publicist of no mean order. But his great work was a huge critical commentary to the &quot;Greek Anthology&quot; in 13 volumes (1798–1814), followed by the first modern edition based on the &quot;Codex Palatinus&quot; (1814–1817). He published also notes on Stobaeus, Euripides, Athenaeus and the &quot;Iliaca&quot; of John Tzetzes; translations of Aelian (&quot;History of Animals&quot;); many of the Greek romances (Philostratus); poetical versions of much of the &quot;Greek Anthology&quot;; miscellaneous essays on classical subjects; and some very successful school books. His translation of the political speeches of Demosthenes was undertaken with the express purpose of rousing his country against Napoleon, whom he regarded as a second Philip of Macedon.

In 1809 he became correspondent of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands. Four years later, in 1813, he became associated member.

Friedrich Jacobs was the great-great-great-grandfather of the philosopher Ruth Anna Putnam (wife of Hilary Putnam).

<doc id="806892" wikidata="Q271044" url="?curid=806892" title="Mahanadi">
<text>The Mahanadi River is a major river in East Central India. It drains an area of around and has a total length of . Mahanadi is also known for the Hirakud Dam which was the first major multipurpose river valley project after India&#x27;s independence in 1947. The river flows through the states of Chhattisgarh and Odisha, before finally ending in the Bay of Bengal.

== Etymology ==
The word Mahanadi is a compound of the Sanskrit words &quot;maha&quot; (&quot;great&quot;) and &quot;nadi&quot; (&quot;river&quot;).

== Course ==
=== Source and Upper Course ===
Like many other seasonal Indian rivers, the Mahanadi too is a combination of many mountain streams and thus its precise source is impossible to pinpoint. However its farthest headwaters lie from Pharsiya village in Nagri Sihawa above sea level about 11 km, in a dense patch of forest, south of Sihawa town in Dhamtari district of Chhattisgarh. The hills here are an extension of the Eastern Ghats and are a source of many other streams which then go on to join the Mahanadi.

For the first of its course, the Mahanadi flows in a northerly direction and drains the Raipur district and touches eastern portions of Raipur city. It is a rather narrow river at this stage and the total width of its valley does not exceed 500–600 metres.

=== Middle course ===
After being joined by the Shivnath, the river flows in an easterly direction through the remaining part of its journey. It is joined by the Jonk and Hasdeo rivers here before entering into Odisha after covering about half of its total length. Near the city of Sambalpur, it is dammed by the longest earthen dam in the world, the Hirakud Dam. A composite structure of the earth, concrete and masonry, the dam measures including the Dykes. It spans two hills; the Lamdungri on the left and the Chandili Dunguri on the right. It also forms the biggest artificial lake in Asia, with a reservoir holding at full capacity, with a shoreline of over .

After the formation of Chhattisgarh State, the major portion of Mahanadi basin now lies in Chhattisgarh. Presently, only basin area of Hasdeo River in Anuppur District lies in Madhya Pradesh.

Before the construction of the dam in 1953, the Mahanadi was about a mile wide at Sambalpur and carried massive amounts of silt, especially during the monsoon. Today, it is a rather tame river after the construction of the dam and is joined by the Ib, Ong, Tel and other minor streams. It then skirts the boundaries of the Baudh district and forces a tortuous way between ridges and ledges in a series of rapids until it reaches Dholpur, Odisha. The rapids end here and the river rolls towards the Eastern Ghats, forcing its way through them via the long Satkosia Gorge. The Satakosia Gorge ends at Badamul of Nayagarh. Dense forests cover the hills flanking the river here. The river enters the Odisha plains at Naraj, about from Cuttack, where it pours down between two hills that are a mile apart. A barrage has been constructed here to regulate the river&#x27;s flow into Cuttack.

=== Lower Course ===

The river traverses the Cuttack district from west to east. Just before entering Cuttack, it gives off a large distributary called the Kathjori. The city of Cuttack stands on the spit separating the two channels. The Kathjori then throws off many streams like the Kuakhai, Devi and Surua which fall into the Bay of Bengal after entering the Puri district. The Kathjori itself falls into the sea as the Jotdar. Other distributaries of Mahanadi include the Paika, Birupa River, Chitroptala river, Genguti and Lun. The Birupa then goes on to join the Brahmani River at Krushnanagar and enters the Bay of Bengal at Dhamra. The Mahanadi proper enters the sea via several channels near Paradeep at False Point, Jagatsinghpur. The combined delta of the Mahanadi&#x27;s numerous distributaries and the Brahmani is one of the largest in India.

== Navigation ==
Prior to the construction of Hirakud Dam, the Mahanadi was navigable from its mouth up to Arrang, about from its source. However numerous barrages apart from the Hirakud have put an end to that. Today, boats are restricted to the delta region and the Hirakud reservoir. Fresh water crocodiles, Ganges and Bull sharks frequent Mahanadi.

== Trade and agriculture ==
The Mahanadi is an important river in the state of Odisha. This river flows slowly for about and deposits more silt than any other river in the Indian subcontinent.

The cities of Cuttack and Sambalpur were prominent trading places in the ancient world and the river itself has been referred to as the Manada in Ptolemy&#x27;s works. However today the Mahanadi valley is best known for its fertile soil and flourishing agriculture.

== Water ==

Average annual surface water potential of 66.9 km3 has been assessed in this basin. Out of this, 50.0 km3 is usable water. Culturable area in the basin is about , which is 4% of the total culturable area of the country.

Present use of surface water in the basin is 17.0 km3. Live storage capacity in the basin has increased significantly since independence. From just about 0.8 km3 in the pre-plan period, the total live storage capacity of the completed projects has increased to 8.5 km3. In addition, a substantial storage quantity of over 5.4 km3 would be created on completion of projects under construction. Additional storage to the tune of over 11.0 km3 would become available on execution of projects under consideration. The hydropower potential of the basin has been assessed as 627 MW at 60% load factor.

At its peak during the monsoon, the Mahanadi has a discharge rate of per second, almost as much as the much larger Ganges. However owing to its seasonal nature the river is mostly a narrow channel flanked by wide sand banks for most of the year.

== Floods ==
The Mahanadi was notorious for its devastating floods for much of recorded history. Thus it was called &#x27;the sorrow of Orissa&#x27;. However the construction of the Hirakud Dam has greatly altered the situation. Today a network of canals, barrages and check dams keep the river well in control. However heavy rain can still cause large-scale flooding as evidenced in September 2008 when 16 people died as the river breached its banks.

In September 2011, heavy downpour caused flash flood and many mud dwellings in more than 25 villages above Hirakud Dam in Chhattisgarh and Odisha, which were never affected before, collapsed due to back water that could not pass through the river.

Sexsmith was seventeen when he started playing at a bar, the Lion&#x27;s Tavern, in his hometown. He gained a reputation as &quot;The One-Man Jukebox&quot; for his aptitude in playing requests. However, he gradually began to include original songs and more obscure music, which his audience did not favour. He decided to start writing songs after the birth of his first child in 1985. That same year, still living in St. Catharines, he collaborated on recording and releasing a cassette, &quot;Out of the Duff&quot;, with a singer-songwriter friend named Claudio. Side one of the cassette contained five songs written and performed by Sexsmith; side two featured Claudio.

A year later, Sexsmith and his family moved to Toronto, living in an apartment in the Beaches neighbourhood. Sexsmith recorded and released the full-length cassette &quot;There&#x27;s a Way&quot;, which was produced by Kurt Swinghammer. Meanwhile, he worked as a courier and befriended Bob Wiseman, whom he met at an open stage. They became friends, and Wiseman agreed to produce and arrange Sexsmith&#x27;s next release in between his tours with the band Blue Rodeo. Because of Wiseman&#x27;s busy schedule, work on the album stretched out over several years.

After the album &quot;Grand Opera Lane&quot; was rejected by several Canadian labels, the pair released it independently in 1991. &quot;Grand Opera Lane&quot; was credited to &quot;Ron Sexsmith and the Uncool&quot;; the backing band including Don Kerr and Steve Charles, and also featured Sarah McElcheran (horn arrangements) and Kim Ratcliffe on electric guitar. Attention garnered by the song &quot;Speaking with the Angel&quot;, Sexsmith earned a contract that led to his self-titled album in 1995. The record was praised by Elvis Costello, for whom Sexsmith later opened.

Between 1997 and 2001, Sexsmith released three more albums, and then &quot;Cobblestone Runway&quot; in 2002. &quot;Retriever&quot;, his next album, is a more pop-oriented album and is dedicated to Elliott Smith and Johnny Cash. Sexsmith performed in the Toronto area in support of these albums.

On May 1, 2001, Sexsmith performed &quot;Just My Heart Talkin on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot; musical showcase, alongside R.E.M., Orbital, India.Arie, and Clearlake. Holland backed him on piano. It was his second appearance on the show. He began to have some radio success, particularly on Canadian adult-oriented radio.

In 2002, Sexsmith recorded a cover version of &quot;This Is Where I Belong&quot;, the title track for a tribute album called &quot;This Is Where I Belong – The Songs of Ray Davies and the Kinks&quot;, which included contributions from Damon Albarn, Bebel Gilberto, and Queens of the Stone Age, among others. In 2006, he performed at the Halifax Pop Explosion. In 2004, he performed at the RuhrTriennale in the concert series &quot;Century of Song&quot; hosted by Bill Frisell.

On June 16, 2011, Sexsmith and his band performed The Kinks&#x27; song &quot;Misfits&quot; with Ray Davies at the Meltdown Festival in London, England. The same year, he won a songwriter of the year Juno Award for &quot;Whatever It Takes&quot; and a Canadian Indy Award. The album &quot;Long Player Late Bloomer&quot; was shortlisted for the Polaris Music Prize. Sexsmith&#x27;s 14th full-length album, &quot;Carousel One&quot;, was released in March 2015.

In 2017, Sexsmith published his debut novel, &quot;Deer Life&quot;, through Dundurn Press. It was well received and &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; wrote that the &quot;novel has much the same effect as his music, conveying uncertainty with fearlessness and heart.&quot;

In February 2024, Sexsmith staged a retrospective concert at Toronto&#x27;s Massey Hall.

He performed garrison duty in California from 1893 to 1895, then served at Fort Hamilton, New York from 1895 to 1898. During the Spanish–American War, he was assigned to the Department of the Gulf as aide to the commander, Major General William Montrose Graham, and as an engineer officer in 1898 to 1899, receiving promotion to first lieutenant in March 1899.

Summerall participated with his unit in the Philippine Insurrection in 1899 to 1900, and was a member of the China Relief Expedition in 1900 to 1901, participating in the attack on Peking. He was promoted to captain and assigned to the 106th Coast Artillery Company in July 1901. He served at Forts Walla Walla and Lawton, in Washington state, commanding the latter post in 1901 to 1902.

He commanded Fort Flagler in 1902 to 1903, and then was transferred to the 3rd Field Artillery Battery with duty at Camp Thomas and Fort Myer in 1903 to 1905.

Summerall was the senior instructor of artillery tactics at West Point from 1905 to 1911. He was promoted to major in March 1911, and commanded the field artillery of the Maneuver Division at San Antonio, Texas. He commanded the summer camps of instruction for army and National Guard artillery in 1912 to 1914, was assistant chief of the Militia Bureau and in charge of National Guard artillery in 1915 to 1917. He was engaged in purchasing artillery ranges, and was a member of the Ordnance Board from 1915 to 1916, the commission to investigate the manufacture of munitions in 1916, the Board of Ordnance and Fortification in 1917, and the military mission to British and French armies in 1917. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1916, colonel in 1917, and brigadier general in the National Army in August 1917.

==World War I==
Summerall commanded the 67th Field Artillery Brigade and the 1st Field Artillery Brigade in operations in France in 1917, was promoted to major general in the National Army, and successively commanded his brigade, the 1st Division, and V Corps, in the Cantigny, Soissons, St. Mihiel, and Meuse-Argonne operations in 1918. &quot;Late on November 9th, instructions from the Allied Commander-In-Chief were transmitted by G.H.Q., A.E.F., directing a general attack, which was executed by the First Army on November 10th–11th. Crossings of the Meuse were secured by General Summerall&#x27;s (V) Corps during the night of November 10th–11th and the remainder of the army advanced on the whole front.&quot; Summerall&#x27;s actions on November 10–11 resulted in over eleven hundred American casualties. Some have criticized the allied operations in the final days of the war, including those ordered by Summerall, as causing unnecessary loss of life, but they are more understandable in the context of previous failed peace attempts and rumors. Marshal Ferdinand Foch, the Allied Supreme Commander, warned General John Joseph &quot;Blackjack&quot; Pershing, Commander-in-Chief of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) on the Western Front, on November 5: &quot;It can happen that the enemy may spread rumors that an armistice is signed in order to deceive us. There is none. Let no one cease hostilities of any sort without information from the Marshal, Commander-In-Chief.&quot;

According to historian Niall Ferguson, Major General Summerall was equally capable of issuing orders that violated the laws and customs of war, as when he ordered U.S. Marine Corps officer Elton Mackin, &quot;Way up there to the north is a railhead... Go cut it for me. And when you cut it, you will go hungry if you try to feed the prisoners you will take... Now I say, and you remember me on this, on those three ridges, take no prisoners.&quot;

Later, Summerall commanded IX and IV Corps and served on the American Peace Commission at the Peace Conference in 1919.

==Leadership and character==
General John J. Pershing, in a hand-written dedication to the official Report of the First Army, wrote in 1924: &quot;To Major General Charles P. Summerall, whose loyal and distinguished services as Brigade, Division, and Corps Commander during Allied operations of the American Expedition army forces in the World War will ever remain the pride of his associates and will ever mark him as one of the outstanding figures of that great struggle. Especially will his name be linked with the wonderful achievements of the First Division which exemplifies his character as a soldier and a leader.&quot;

Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt Jr. wrote in a letter to future Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall: &quot;in my humble opinion, General Summerall was the biggest troop leader we had in the American army and you were the best tactician. I have quite often expressed this view to people whom I know and you would be pleased and surprised to know how many agree with me.&quot; General Thomas T. Handy, discussing the impact of &quot;real leaders&quot;, said &quot;I remember old man Summerall, 5th Corps, way back in World War I. His personality was felt all the way down through it.&quot;

War correspondent Thomas Johnson wrote: &quot;To command the V Corps in the place of General Cameron, came the epitome of a military leader, daring and careful, ruthless and inspiring, a Christian and a fighter, whose officers and men worshipped him, Major-General Charles P. Summerall of the 1st Division.&quot; He later observes &quot;Summerall was spiritually a Civil war corps commander, mentally a scientific modern soldier, a twentieth-century Stonewall Jackson. He could deliver an exhortation to make men cry and curse and beg to get at the Germans.&quot;

In World War I, Summerall became embittered by General Joseph T. Dickman. During an attempted attack on Sedan in early November 1918, based on misleading orders by General Pershing, Summerall failed to coordinate with Dickman&#x27;s I Corps and ordered his subordinate, Brigadier General Frank Parker, who had succeeded him in command of the 1st Division, to attack the city. During the attack, Parker&#x27;s 1st Division entered Dickman&#x27;s sector and mixed with two of his divisions and a French unit, causing confusion, delays and friendly fire incidents. Although the episode had no relevant military consequences, Gary Nichols reports, that even after Summerall became chief of staff, he attributed all criticism or resistance he encountered to supporters of Dickman, so &quot;it became almost impossible to criticize him without incurring his wrath.&quot;

==Post-war career==

Summerall commanded the 1st Division in 1919 to 1921, receiving promotion to brigadier general of the regular army in February 1919 and to major general in April 1920. He commanded the Hawaiian Department from August 1921 to August 1924. Colonel William &quot;Billy&quot; Mitchell visited Summerall during his command in Hawaii, and criticized the lack of air defenses for the islands. This angered Summerall, who attempted to preside over Mitchell&#x27;s 1925 court-martial. Summerall testified against Mitchell, who was convicted and sentenced to a five-year suspension from duty.

After commanding the Eighth and Second Corps Areas from 1924 to 1926, Summerall was appointed Chief of Staff of the United States Army. He served from 21 November 1926 until 20 November 1930, and was promoted to general in February 1929. During his tenure he directed the formation of a mechanized force and recommended an integrated mobile force of tank, artillery, engineer, and quartermaster elements. In 1927, Summerall joined the South Carolina Society of the Sons of the American Revolution, and he later became its president.

Summerall retired from active service in March 1931, and was president of The Citadel from 1931 until 1953. He died in Washington, D.C., on 14 May 1955. Summerall is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

The elite rifle drill team at The Citadel is named The Summerall Guards in his honor. The Citadel&#x27;s parade field, edged by the cadet barracks and most of the main buildings on campus, is named after him. The Summerall Chapel on the campus of The Citadel, built in 1936, is named for Summerall as well. Summerall Field is the main parade ground on Fort Myer, Virginia, where change of command ceremonies, retirements, the twilight tattoo and other major events are held featuring the 3d Infantry Regiment.

<doc id="806950" wikidata="Q709193" url="?curid=806950" title="Arthur Summerfield">
<text>Arthur Ellsworth Summerfield (March 17, 1899 – April 26, 1972) was a U.S. political figure who served as the 57th Postmaster General of the United States from 1953 to 1961. As Postmaster General, he was an ardent opponent of obscenity.

==Early life and career==
Summerfield was born in Pinconning, Michigan, on March 17, 1899, the son of Cora Edith Ellsworth, (Born in Indiana on April 11, 1877 - Died in Flint, Michigan, on January 18, 1933) and William Henry Summerfield, (Born in Zilwaukee, Michigan, in 1876 - Died in Flint, Michigan, in 1938).

Before embarking on his political career, Summerfield had become well known in Michigan as the owner of one of the largest General Motors automobile dealerships in the state; and one of the largest in the Midwest. On July 22, 1918, Summerfield married the former Miriam Wealthy Graim, (Born in Alma, Michigan, on September 7, 1898 - Died in Flint, Michigan, on February 12, 1987). They had two children:

* Gertrude Miriam Summerfield MacArthur, (Born in Flint, Michigan, on November 26, 1920 - Died in Flint, Michigan, on July 17, 2008).
* Arthur Ellsworth Summerfield Jr.

==Political career==
Summerfield served as the chairman of the Republican National Committee between 1952 and 1953. At the 1952 Republican National Convention he played a key role in winning the GOP presidential nomination for General Dwight Eisenhower. As Michigan&#x27;s delegate chairman Summerfield convinced the large, uncommitted Michigan delegation to support Eisenhower, thus providing &quot;Ike&quot; with a major boost before the voting.

In December 1952, President-Elect Eisenhower chose Summerfield as the federal Postmaster General; he served in that post from 1953 until 1961. His assistant postmaster was former U.S. Representative Ben H. Guill of Texas.

As postmaster general, Summerfield oversaw attempts to reform and modernize the Post Office and the U.S. mail system, which was still conducting many sorting and processing operations by hand. Summerfield called for an increase in postage rates to subsidize the purchase of new mechanized mail processing and sorting equipment. Some of this equipment was adopted, including the &quot;Hamper-Dumper&quot; internal mail sorting/transport system and the &quot;Mail-Flo Letter Processing System&quot;, which used conveyors to speed mail processing. However, rapidly increasing mail volume and postal deficits prevented the Post Office from completely modernizing and mechanizing all of its many post offices. To improve the Post Office&#x27;s image with the public, Summerfield began a promotional campaign designed to showcase Post Office achievements.

On July 4, 1955, in order to highlight its new image as a modern organization, the Post Office adopted a new red, white, and blue color scheme for all Post Office collection boxes, trucks, delivery vans, and equipment, as well as new technology and procedures for mail delivery. As part of that effort, Summerfield supported experiments with rocket-delivered mail, using the missile mail carrier. The first and only flight of the missile mail carrier occurred on June 8, 1959, when a letter-stuffed Regulus cruise missile was successfully launched from the U.S. Navy submarine USS &quot;Barbero&quot;.

===Opposition against obscenity===
As Postmaster General, Summerfield was a vigorous opponent of the mailing of obscene materials through the postal system. In 1955, postal inspectors seized a rare volume of the 2,400-year-old play &quot;Lysistrata&quot; by Aristophanes, which Summerfield described as &quot;obscene, lewd and lascivious&quot;. When the first unexpurgated edition of &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; was published in the US in 1959 by Grove Press, Summerfield moved to ban it from being sent by mail, saying that &quot;any literary merit the book may have is far outweighed by the pornographic and smutty passages and words&quot;.

Under Summerfield, the post office targeted not only producers of obscene materials, but also recipients. Among the best known was Newton Arvin, an esteemed professor of English at Smith College, who was disgraced as a result of his prosecution for possessing &quot;obscene photographs&quot; in the form of physique magazines such as &quot;Grecian Guild Pictorial&quot; which contained homoerotic photographs of scantily dressed men. Arvin&#x27;s story was made into an opera, &quot;The Scarlet Professor&quot;, which featured Summerfield as a character.

In January 1961, toward the end of his tenure as Postmaster General, Summerfield oversaw the indictment in Chicago of more than fifty members of the &quot;Adonis Male Club&quot;, a gay pen pal service, for conspiracy to send obscene materials through the mail. The accused men had their information printed in local newspapers, and many lost their jobs and were disgraced in their community. One man committed suicide, and another attempted suicide. All defendants eventually pled guilty or were found guilty. A government spokesperson said that many more white-collar men would have been prosecuted, but were instead allowed to be sent for psychiatric treatment by their employers.

==Death and legacy==
Summerfield died in West Palm Beach, Florida, on April 26, 1972, at the age of 73. Summerfield is interred in Sunset Hills Cemetery in Flint, Michigan.
Summerfield&#x27;s book, &quot;U.S. Mail The Story of the United States Postal Service&quot; (By Summerfield as told to Charles Hurd) was published in 1960.

<doc id="806996" wikidata="Q7866413" url="?curid=806996" title="USF Track and Field Stadium">
<text>The USF Track and Field Stadium (formerly known as the USF Soccer Stadium from 1978 to 1991 and the USF Soccer and Track Stadium from 1991 to 2010) is a track and field stadium that was built in 1978. The stadium is currently home to the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track and field teams from the University of South Florida in Tampa, Florida.

It also hosted the school&#x27;s men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer programs from 1978 and 1995 respectively through the end of their 2010 seasons, when they moved to Corbett Stadium.

== History ==
The 4,000-seat stadium was built in 1978 on the site of the USF Soccer Field, which from 1965–1978 was only a field and did not have any permanent bleachers. The stadium was renovated to add a running track in 1991, when USF&#x27;s men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track and field programs were founded.

The configuration of the track was slightly altered in 1998.

In 2008, the stadium was remodeled again. The renovations included new lighting, a new state-of-the-art Mondo track surface (the same type of surface that is used in the Olympics), a new electronic scoreboard, and some aesthetic features.

In the fall of 2010, USF began construction on a new soccer stadium. The new Corbett Soccer Stadium hosted its first match on August 23, 2011, as the Bulls men&#x27;s team defeated the crosstown rival University of Tampa Spartans 2–1 in the annual preseason Rowdies Cup. The original stadium remains in use as a track and field facility and for other events.

Another new track surface was installed in 2022 to replace the one installed in 2008. For the first time, the track was made to be USF&#x27;s green and gold instead of red, which had been the color since the track was added to the facility in 1991.

== Events hosted ==
The 4,000 capacity stadium has hosted several events throughout the years including Lamar Hunt US Open Cup matches, the NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Soccer Championship final twice, the C-USA soccer tournaments for men and women, the men&#x27;s Big East soccer tournament, the C-USA track and field championships once, and the American Athletic Conference track and field championships twice.

In 1984, when Tampa hosted Super Bowl XVIII at Tampa Stadium, the Washington Redskins practiced at the stadium. Concerned about the lack of privacy at the stadium, the Redskins purchased a green tarpaulin that was attached to the fence around the stadium. The Redskins donated the tarp to the university and it remained in use for many years.

In the mid-1980s the stadium hosted preseason training for the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League (USFL), including stars Herschel Walker and Brian Sipe. The Generals&#x27; players stayed and dined at nearby Fontana Hall.

The 1990 and 1991 NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Soccer Tournament semifinal and championship games were hosted at the stadium.

The Tampa Bay Rowdies played one 1990 playoff game there before using the facility full-time in 1991 and 1992 for home games while playing in the American Professional Soccer League. The Tampa Bay Cyclones of the USISL played most of their home games there in 1995 and 1996 before moving to Jacksonville.

USF&#x27;s football spring game was played at the stadium from 1998 until 2011.

<doc id="807003" wikidata="Q426664" url="?curid=807003" title="Calcium phosphate">
<text>The term calcium phosphate refers to a family of materials and minerals containing calcium ions (Ca2+) together with inorganic phosphate anions. Some so-called calcium phosphates contain oxide and hydroxide as well. Calcium phosphates are white solids of nutritional value and are found in many living organisms, e.g., bone mineral and tooth enamel. In milk, it exists in a colloidal form in micelles bound to casein protein with magnesium, zinc, and citrate–collectively referred to as colloidal calcium phosphate (CCP). Various calcium phosphate minerals, which often are not white owing to impurities, are used in the production of phosphoric acid and fertilizers. Overuse of certain forms of calcium phosphate can lead to nutrient-containing surface runoff and subsequent adverse effects upon receiving waters such as algal blooms and eutrophication (over-enrichment with nutrients and minerals).

==Orthophosphates, di- and monohydrogen phosphates==
These materials contain Ca2+ combined with , , or :
* Monocalcium phosphate, E341 (CAS# 7758-23-8 for anhydrous; CAS#10031-30-8 for monohydrate: Ca(H2PO4)2 and Ca(H2PO4)2(H2O)
* Dicalcium phosphate (dibasic calcium phosphate), E341(ii) (CAS# 7757-93-9): CaHPO4 (mineral: monetite), dihydrate CaHPO4(H2O)2 (mineral: brushite) and monohydrate CaHPO4(H2O)
* Tricalcium phosphate (tribasic calcium phosphate or tricalcic phosphate, sometimes referred to as calcium phosphate or calcium orthophosphate, whitlockite), E341(iii) (CAS#7758-87-4): Ca3(PO4)2
* Octacalcium phosphate (CAS# 13767-12-9): Ca8H2(PO4)6·5H2O
* Amorphous calcium phosphate, a glassy precipitate of variable composition that may be present in biological systems.

==Di- and polyphosphates==
These materials contain Ca2+ combined with the polyphosphates, such as  and triphosphate :
* Dicalcium diphosphate (CAS#7790-76-3]: Ca2P2O7
* Calcium triphosphate (CAS# 26158-70-3): Ca5(P3O10)2

==Hydroxy- and oxo-phosphates==
These materials contain other anions in addition to phosphate:
* Hydroxyapatite Ca5(PO4)3(OH)
* Apatite Ca10(PO4)6(OH,F,Cl,Br)2
* Tetracalcium phosphate (CAS#1306-01-0): Ca4(PO4)2O

==Clinical significance==
Calcium phosphate stones account for approximately 15% of kidney stone disease. Calcium phosphate stones tend to grow in alkaline urine, especially when &quot;Proteus&quot; bacteria are present. It is the most common type in pregnant women.

Calcium phosphate is the usual constitution of microcalcifications of the breast, particularly dystrophic calcifications. Microcalcifications as can be seen on mammography can be an early sign of breast cancer. Based on morphology, it is possible to classify by radiography how likely microcalcifications are to indicate cancer.

<text>A mattress is a large, usually rectangular pad for supporting a person lying down, especially for sleeping. It is designed to be used as a bed, or on a bed frame as part of a bed. Mattresses may consist of a quilted or similarly fastened case, usually of heavy cloth, containing materials such as hair, straw, cotton, foam rubber, or a framework of metal springs. Mattresses may also be filled with air or water.

Mattresses are usually placed on top of a bed base which may be solid, as in the case of a platform bed, or elastic, such as an upholstered wood and wire box spring or a slatted foundation. Popular in Europe, a divan incorporates both mattress and foundation in a single upholstered, footed unit. Divans have at least one innerspring layer as well as cushioning materials. They may be supplied with a secondary mattress or a removable &quot;topper&quot;. Mattresses may also be filled with air or water, or a variety of natural fibers, such as in futons. Kapok is a common mattress material in Southeast Asia, and coir in South Asia.

==History==

A third-century BCE papyrus mentions a man named Krotos who is &quot;waiting in Jaffa for an opportunity of exporting... and mattresses.&quot;

The word &quot;&quot; derives from the Arabic مَطْرَحٌ (&quot;maṭraḥ&quot;) which means &quot;something thrown down&quot; or &quot;place where something is thrown down&quot; and hence &quot;mat, cushion&quot;. During the Crusades, Europeans adopted one of the Middle Eastern methods of sleeping on cushions on the floor since sleeping on beds in the Middle East was for the wealthy. The word &quot;materas&quot; eventually descended into Middle English through the Romance languages. The oldest known mattress dates to around 77,000 years ago from South Africa and consisted of layers of twigs and leaves, notably including the leaves from Cryptocarya woodii which serves as a natural insect repellent and is believed to have served the additional purpose of repelling mosquitos. Preventing or reducing the number of mosquito bites would have reduced the chance malaria, which continues to be spread by mosquitos throughout Africa to this day and has been estimated to be the single most common cause of death among humans historically, estimated to have caused the death of roughly half of humans that have ever lived throughout history.

Early mattresses contained a variety of natural materials including straw, feathers or horsehair. In the first half of the 20th century, a typical mattress sold in North America had an innerspring core and cotton batting or fiberfill. Modern mattresses usually contain either an inner spring core or materials such as latex, viscoelastic or other flexible polyurethane foams. Other fill components include insulator pads over the coils that prevent the bed&#x27;s upholstery layers from cupping down into the innerspring, as well as polyester fiberfill in the bed&#x27;s top upholstery layers. In 1899 James Marshall introduced the first individually wrapped pocketed spring coil mattress now commonly known as Marshall coils.

In North America, the typical mattress sold today is an innerspring; however, there is increasing interest in all-foam beds and hybrid beds, which include both an innerspring and high-end foams such as viscoelastic or latex in the comfort layers. In Europe, polyurethane foam cores and latex cores have long been popular. These make up a much larger proportion of the mattresses sold in the continent.

==Construction==
A conventional mattress consists of two primary sections – a &quot;core&quot; or &quot;support layer&quot; and the &quot;upholstery&quot; or &quot;comfort layer&quot; – wrapped in a thick fabric called the &quot;ticking&quot;.

Upholstery layers cover the mattress and provide cushioning and comfort. The upholstery layer consists of three parts: the insulator, the middle upholstery, and the quilt.

==Sizes==
Mattresses are typically made to conform to bed sizing standards that vary by market. The size of mattress varies between national standards in width and height and depth. Many countries use non-numeric labels such as &quot;King&quot;, &quot;Queen&quot;, &quot;Double&quot;, &quot;Full&quot; or &quot;Single&quot; to represent these dimensions.

===Mattress topper===
A &quot;mattress topper&quot; is a thin mattress, usually thick. Stand-alone mattresses of this size exist (see futon and Bed base#Floor beds; traditional European beds were made of a stack of mattresses of this size). But &quot;mattress topper&quot;s are usually sold for use on top of boxsprings (secured with straps or elasticated cloth corners). They are used to extend the life of the more-expensive boxspring, make a bed warmer or cooler (with airflow, or heat-conductive materials), make a firm bed softer, and for travel and dorms, as they are portable, especially if they are low-density.

Like a mattress protector/mattress pad/mattress cover (a thin, generally unpadded layer not designed to improve comfort), mattress toppers can be used to protect the mattress from the sleeper or vice versa. Some mattress toppers are machine-washable; covers and fillings are made from a range of materials.

==Types==
===Tick mattress===
A tick mattress is a bag made of ticking (a type of cloth), filled with some suitable material. A paillasse or a featherbed is a tick mattress, as are most futons. They are simply constructed and were traditionally homemade. Because they are fairly thin and light, they are layered to form a bed.

===Innerspring===
Innerspring mattresses commonly consist of just the spring core, and the top and bottom upholstery layers.

====Core====
The core of the mattress supports the sleeper&#x27;s body. Modern spring mattress cores, often called &quot;innersprings&quot; are made up of steel coil springs, or &quot;coils&quot;.

The gauge of the coils is one factor which determines firmness and support. Coils are measured in quarter increments. The lower the number, the thicker the spring. In general, higher-quality mattress coils have a 14-gauge (1.63 mm) diameter. Coils of 14 to 15.5-gauge (1.63 to 1.37 mm) give more easily under pressure, while a 12.5-gauge (1.94 mm) coil, the thickest typically available, feels quite firm.

Connections between the coils help the mattress retain its shape. Most coils are connected by interconnecting wires; encased coils are not connected, but the fabric encasement helps preserve the mattress shape.

There are four types of mattress coils:

* Bonnell coils are the oldest and most common. First adapted from buggy seat springs of the 19th century, they are still prevalent in mid-priced mattresses. Bonnell springs are a knotted, round-top, hourglass-shaped steel wire coil. When laced together with cross wire helicals, these coils form the simplest innerspring unit, also referred to as a Bonnell unit.
* Offset coils are an hourglass type coil on which portions of the top and bottom convolutions have been flattened. In assembling the innerspring unit, these flat segments of wire are hinged together with helical wires. The hinging effect of the unit is designed to conform to body shape. LFK coils are an unknotted offset coil with a cylindrical or columnar shape.
* Continuous coils (the Leggett &amp; Platt brand name is &quot;Mira-coil&quot;) is an innerspring configuration in which the rows of coils are formed from a single piece of wire. They work in a hinging effect similar to that of offset coils.
* Marshall coils, also known as wrapped or encased coils or pocket springs, are thin-gauge, barrel-shaped, knot-less coils individually encased in fabric pockets—normally a fabric from man-made, non-woven fiber. Some manufacturers pre-compress these coils, which makes the mattress firmer and allows for motion separation between the sides of the bed. As the springs are not wired together, they work more or less independently: the weight on one spring does not affect its neighbors. More than half the consumers who participated in a survey had chosen to buy pocket spring mattresses.

====Upholstery layers====
Upholstery layers cover the mattress and provide cushioning and comfort. Some manufacturers call the mattress core the &quot;support layer&quot; and the upholstery layer the &quot;comfort layer&quot;. The upholstery layer consists of three parts: the insulator, the middle upholstery, and the quilt.

The insulator separates the mattress core from the middle upholstery. It is usually made of fiber or mesh and is intended to keep the middle upholstery in place.

The middle upholstery comprises all the material between the insulator and the quilt. It is usually made from materials which are intended to provide comfort to the sleeper, including flexible polyurethane foam (which includes convoluted &quot;egg-crate&quot; foam), viscoelastic foam, latex foam, felt, polyester fiber, cotton fiber, wool fiber and non-woven fiber pads. In Europe and North America, mattress makers have begun incorporating gel-infused foams, soft-solid gels layered over foam, and poured gels in the top comfort layer of the bed.

The quilt is the top layer of the mattress. Made of light foam or fibers stitched to the underside of the ticking, it provides a soft surface texture to the mattress and can be found in varying degrees of firmness.

====Foundation====
There are three main types of foundation or bed base:

* A traditional box spring consists of a rigid frame containing extra heavy duty springs. This foundation is often paired with an innerspring mattress, as it extends the life of the spring unit at the mattress&#x27;s core.
* An all-wood foundation usually has seven or eight support slats disposed below paperboard or beaverboard. This foundation, variously called a &quot;no-flex&quot;, &quot;low-flex&quot; or &quot;zero-deflection&quot; unit, as well as an &quot;ortho box&quot;, provides support similar to a platform foundation. All-wood foundations have become increasingly prevalent as U.S. mattress makers shifted to super-thick, one-sided mattresses.
* A grid-top foundation bed base is a type of bed foundation that features a grid-like structure made of metal or wood slats. The slats are spaced apart to provide support for a mattress and improve airflow to keep the mattress cool and dry.

This type of bed base is often used as an alternative to traditional box springs, which may be less durable and may not provide adequate support for heavier mattresses. Grid-top foundation bed bases are typically more durable and may offer greater stability for the mattress.

The grid-top design also allows for better weight distribution and can reduce pressure points, which can be beneficial for people with back pain or joint issues. Additionally, the open design of the foundation can make it easier to move and store compared to bulkier box springs.

Typically the measurements of a foundation will be about 1–2″ shorter than the measurement of a mattress.

====Fabric cover====
Ticking is the protective fabric cover used to encase mattresses and foundations. It is usually designed to coordinate with the foundation border fabric and comes in a wide variety of colors and styles. Mattress fabrics can be knits, damask or printed wovens, or inexpensive non-wovens. During the past decade, along with the rise in popularity of all-foam beds, stretchy knit ticking on the bed&#x27;s top panel has become a standard look on both innerspring and foam beds. Most ticking is made with polyester yarns. More expensive mattress fabrics may contain a combination of polyester with rayon, cotton, silk, wool or other natural yarns.

Up until the early 2000s, beds were normally upholstered with a single fabric. This was usually a damask ticking or, for inexpensive bedsets, a non-woven fabric covering all surfaces of the mattress and foundation. Today&#x27;s bedsets are covered with up to six different fabrics: A better quality circular knit or woven damask on the top panel—the bed&#x27;s sleeping surface; a matching or contrasting (usually woven) fabric on the border of the mattress; a matching or contrasting (usually woven) fabric on the foundation side panels; a &#x27;non-skid&#x27; woven or non-woven fabric on the surface of the foundation and reverse side of the mattress; and a non-woven dust cover on the under side of the foundation. Some North American mattress producers are beginning to use furniture upholstery fabrics on the bed&#x27;s borders giving beds a more European, home furnishings look.

===Foam mattress===
All-foam mattresses use different weights and densities of petrochemical-based flexible polyurethane foams and viscoelastic foams or memory foam, and latex rubber foams. A number of mattress manufacturers have incorporated polyurethane and visco-elastic foams with a portion of plant-based content. All-foam mattresses are often paired with platform bases.

; Latex foam: Latex foam in mattresses is generally a blend of the latex of the &quot;Hevea brasiliensis&quot; tree and synthetic latex, which is derived from petrochemicals and other substances and fillers. There are, however, natural latex mattresses that leave out polyurethane-based chemicals. Latex foam is produced using either the Talalay or the Dunlop process.
; Memory foam: Memory foam mattresses use conforming viscoelastic foam over firmer polyurethane base foam. Some innerspring mattresses have memory foam in their upholstery layer. Different feels and comfort levels are achieved by varying the thickness, weight and formulation of the viscoelastic foams and the base foams. Latex and memory foam mattresses each provide a unique feel. This type of mattress is good at relieving pressure on painful joints. Many memory foam mattresses are more expensive than standard spring mattresses. Memory foam is affected by temperature. In a cool bedroom, a memory foam mattress will feel firmer than it does in a warm bedroom. Memory softens and conforms to the sleeper in response to body temperature and body weight. Traditional memory foam molds to the body creating a depression the sleeper must roll out of when changing sleep positions. Mattress manufacturers have responded to this issue by using &quot;faster response&quot; memory foams. They spring back more quickly when the sleeper moves. Foam mattresses are also known to generally &quot;sleep warmer&quot; than innerspring mattresses. Mattress makers have addressed the issue with &quot;open-cell&quot; memory foams, pinhole cored memory foam, gel-infused memory foams, channel-cut foam cores, reticulated foam support layers and other technologies to improve air circulation through all-foam beds.
; High density foam: Similar to memory foam mattresses, a high density foam mattress uses a more compact foam typically made from polyurethane. This kind of foam is made largely from open cells that are packed together tightly. High density foam mattresses offer comfort and longevity because they are more dense than a traditional foam mattress. High density foam mattresses that have an innerspring system last even longer and eliminate mattress sagging.

===Bladder mattresses===
Mattresses can also be made from bladders of some fluid, notably water or air. These date to antiquity – goatskin bladders filled with water were used in Persia at least as early as 3600 BCE – and gained increased popularity in the 20th century with improved manufacturing.

; Air mattress: Air mattresses use one or more air chambers instead of springs to provide support. Quality and price can range from inexpensive ones used occasionally for camping, to high-end luxury beds. Air mattresses designed for typical bedroom use cost about the same as inner-spring mattresses with comparable features. Air bladder construction varies from a simple polyethylene bag to internally baffled, multiple chambers of latex (vulcanized rubber) or vinyl with bonded cotton exteriors. Mattresses may have a layer of foam above the air chambers for added cushioning, and may be enclosed in a cover. Some such beds are termed soft-sided air beds. Permanent use adjustable-firmness &quot;airbeds&quot; became popular particularly after market leader Select Comfort (now Sleep Number) began a major marketing campaign around 2001. The original airbed was manufactured by Comfortaire in 1981, which was later purchased by Select Comfort. There are several other manufacturers. Some allow independent adjustment of each side of the bed. They are made in a variety of models from basic, no-frills ones that measure about 7″ in height, to high-profile, 15″ tall hybrids that contain several types of foam, pillow tops, and digital pumps with memory for individual pressure settings. Studies suggest that adjustable-firmness beds are better for back pain. Adjustable-firmness mattresses for medical use have special control mechanisms. In the 1990s self-adjusting air beds that automatically change their pressure periodically, or inflate and deflate several air chambers alternately, were introduced. The intention of these periodic changes is to reduce problems with decubitus ulcers (bed sores), though the effectiveness of these techniques was still being researched. Air mattresses for camping are available which are filled with foam which itself provides little support, but expands when the air valve is opened allowing air to enter, so the mattress (nearly) inflates by itself. This is especially useful for campers who carry their equipment as, unlike with normal air mattresses, no pump is needed for inflating. Available brands include Aerobed, Coleman, Therm-a-Rest and others. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission advises consumers not to let infants sleep on air mattresses. This is motivated by reports of deaths, mostly infants younger than 8 months of age, who were placed to sleep on air mattresses, and either suffocated in a face down position on an air mattress or died due to suffocation after falling into gaps between the mattress and bed frame, or the mattress and adjacent furniture or wall.
; Waterbeds: A waterbed is a mattress with water in its interior instead of metal coils or air. Waterbeds can be lined with different layers of fiber to achieve the level of firmness the user desires. Waterbeds are well known for providing support to the spine and other body parts, similar to the other mattress types. There are several options of support which range up to 100% waveless, where the user does not notice that they are lying upon a waterbed.

==Quality==
Many parameters determine the quality of a mattress. Laboratory test methods have been established for some of these parameters, such as pressure distribution, skin microclimate, hygiene, edge support, and long-term stability. Some of these have been developed by Duncan Bain, working on behalf of the UK&#x27;s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.

Other parameters, such as firmness, are more specific to the sleeper. In general, firm mattresses are recommended for stomach and some back sleepers, soft mattresses are recommended for side sleepers, and medium mattresses are recommended for the majority of back sleepers. Double mattresses are available with a softer and a firmer part, or with adjustable firmness levels, to accommodate sleepers with different preferences who share a bed.

===Ergonomics===
In 2003, a randomized-controlled trial found that medium-firm mattresses assessed using the Hs scale from the European Committee for Standardization were associated with less pain; this study has been cited by clinical practice guidelines on lower back pain. In 2015, a systematic review of studies concluded that medium-firm, custom-inflated mattresses were best for pain and neutral spinal alignment.

==Lifespan==
The term mattress lifespan refers to the duration in which all types of mattress can retain their original support and comfort. Mattresses deteriorate over time, and the lifespan of a mattress depends on a variety of factors, notably materials, manufacturing quality, care, and the rigorousness of use. A poor quality foam comfort layer can deteriorate noticeably in 1 year, while a quality latex core can last 20 years or more; innerspring cores typically last around 10 years. The comfort layer is almost invariably the first area to fail, which is why mattresses are often double-sided, to extend the lifespan. A separate topper may be used instead of or in addition to a comfort layer, which reduces wear and is replaceable without replacing the entire mattress. The majority of high-end mattresses have a lifespan of between 7–10 years but it can last beyond 10 years and more depending on the level of care.

In the United States, mattress warranties are typically for 10 years or 20 years, sometimes 25 years, though this specifically addresses manufacturing defects and faster-than-normal deterioration, not expected deterioration with time. In the United States, there is a general expectation that mattresses should last about 10 years, and this is the average number of years Americans keep mattresses, though this varies by age group. This expectation is based on a number of factors, including sales pitches; the expectation that mattresses will last the length of their warranty, hence 10 years or 20 years, accordingly; and comparison with other household items.

The mattress replacement cycle is a key driver of income and profits for the mattress industry – a five-year replacement cycle yields double the sales of a 10-year replacement cycle, for instance – so the mattress industry has a financial incentive to shorten the replacement cycle. Notably, the International Sleep Products Association (ISPA) established the Better Sleep Council (BSC) in 1979 with the stated goal to &quot;shorten the mattress replacement cycle&quot;, in addition to encouraging people to &quot;invest in better bedding&quot;.

An industry-funded 2006 study by researchers at Oklahoma State University (funded by the BSC) of 59 people with poor sleep who received free new replacement mattresses for their existing mattresses 5 years or older (average age 9.5 years) found improved sleep, particularly when the existing mattresses were cheap. A follow-up paper by some of the same authors with additional statistical analysis reinforced these conclusions. The BSC has subsequently cited this study in the ISPA-published news magazine for mattress manufacturers, BedTimes, to advocate a more frequent replacement cycle, specifically to &quot;consider replacing a mattress every five to seven years&quot;; the recommendation is based largely on this study.

==Maintenance and care==
Wear problems occur with most mattresses and can include sagging, mildew, and staining. These are prevented by proper support, rotation and flipping, keeping it dry, and using a mattress pad or protector. Some symptoms of a broken or worn-out mattress include springs which can be felt poking through the upholstery layer, visible permanent sagging or deformity, lumpiness, and excessive squeaking.

Mattresses require a solid foundation which does not itself sag – a sagging foundation, such as by weak slats on a wide bed, will in turn cause the mattress to sag. Consistently sleeping in the same place and body position causes excessive wear, and thus rotating or flipping mattresses is used to reduce this: double-sided mattresses can be alternately flipped width-wise (about the long axis) and length-wise (about the shorter axis), or alternately flipped and rotated; while single-sided mattresses are only rotated, which is simpler but less effective. Flipping/rotation schedules vary between materials and manufacturers, but typically recommended is monthly for the first six months and every two or three months thereafter. Foundations should also be rotated, if possible, though less frequently – rotating box springs twice a year is recommended. While sagging is undesirable, some level of indentation (about ) is natural if natural materials are used in a comfort layer.

Excessive wear on mattresses can occur when folding and bending takes place, placing heavy objects in one spot, or excess force on the handles, will also cause more rapid deterioration. Care should particularly be taken during transport or storage.

Mattresses require ventilation to remain dry and prevent mildew, and thus should not be placed directly on the floor or on a solid surface – slats or a box spring provide space for airflow, while solid wood or plywood (as in cheap bunkie boards) does not. Additional ventilation is recommended for natural materials, in which case leaving the mattress &quot;naked&quot; after stripping sheets (for example while laundering) is recommended. If a mattress is allowed to become damp, for example by wet cleaning, mildew may develop inside the upholstery; cleaning with a vacuum cleaner or mild surface cleanser and a slightly damp cloth avoids this.

Mattresses absorb fluids and stains readily, notably from nightly sweating (which results in a yellow stain), seminal (or Cowper) stains which are darker, menstrual fluids which are dark red, and other bodily fluids in addition to accidental spills. These visibly stain the ticking and seep through into lower layers. In addition to being unhygienic, hard to launder, and unsightly, such stains typically void a warranty. Thus a mattress protector is suggested to protect the mattress; this can be removed and cleaned separately, and replaced if damaged.

==Industry==
Companies often specialize in a particular type of mattress, such as innerspring, latex, and airbed, although as latex and airbeds have become more popular, they have become more common.

===United States of America===
Mattresses which are mostly the same are often sold under different brand names; two of the largest brands, Serta and Simmons, became owned by the same company after a private equity buyout. Simmons, founded in the late 1800s, was bought and sold multiple times and faced bankruptcy after a major decline in the bedding industry in the 2000s. The International Sleep Products Association was founded in 1915 and releases a report on U.S. mattress sales. Another association, Specialty Sleep Association, represents companies such as Innomax and Boyd Specialty focused on latex, waterbeds, and airbeds. However, Select Comfort, which produces airbeds (a specialty bed), is a member of the ISPA.

Originally founded in 1881, the Sealy Corporation was purchased by Tempur-Pedic in 2012, which had introduced an all foam (TEMPUR-Material) brand into the United States in 1992.

Adjustable beds have become a trend and are more compatible with certain types of mattresses such as latex or memory foam. These are particularly popular in Europe, and for one business accounted for 25% of beds in Sweden in 2010 and 70% of beds in the Netherlands.

In the 2010s, affiliate marketing became a major part of the business model for direct-to-consumer online mattress companies such as Amerisleep. Later, companies like Casper and Purple, with venture capital and funding followed and helped grow the global mattress industry to $28.5 billion dollar in 2018. According to experts, there are over 175 bed-in-a-box mattress companies in the United States. Mattress suggestion methods are emerging in response to the crowded retail marketplace.

Another large company, Spring Air, went bankrupt in 2009 and was purchased by one of its former executives.

Comfortaire, founded in 1981, was the first to specialize in airbeds. It was later bought by Select Comfort.

===Spain===
Pikolin, founded in 1948, is one of the largest manufacturers of mattresses.

<doc id="807041" wikidata="Q1145416" url="?curid=807041" title="Satpura Range">
<text>The Satpura Range is a range of hills in central India. The range rises in eastern Gujarat running east through the border of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh and ends in Chhattisgarh. The range parallels the Vindhya Range to the north, and these two east–west ranges divide Indian Subcontinent into the Indo-Gangetic plain of northern India and the Deccan Plateau of the south. The Narmada River originates from north-eastern end of Satpura in Amarkantak, and runs in the depression between the Satpura and Vindhya ranges, draining the northern slope of the Satpura range, running west towards the Arabian Sea. The Tapti River originates in the eastern-central part of Satpura, crossing the range in the center and running west at the range&#x27;s southern slopes before meeting the Arabian Sea at Surat, draining the central and southern slopes of the range. Multai, the place of Tapti river origin is located about 465 kilometer far, south-westerly to Amarkantak, separated across by the hill range. The Godavari River and its tributaries drain the Deccan plateau, which lies south of the range, and the Mahanadi River drains the easternmost portion of the range. The Godavari and Mahanadi rivers flow into the Bay of Bengal. At its eastern end, the Satpura range meets the hills of the Chotanagpur Plateau. The Satpura Range is a horst mountain and is flanked by Narmada Graben in the north and much smaller but parallel Tapi Graben in the south.

==Geography==
The eastern portion of the range receives more rainfall than the western portion, and the eastern range, together with the Eastern Ghats, constitute the eastern highlands moist deciduous forests ecoregion. The seasonally dry western portion of the range, together with the Narmada valley and the western Vindhya Range, are within the Narmada valley dry deciduous forests ecoregion.

This mountain range serves as a natural border between Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh state.

The Narmada and the Tapti are major rivers that drain into the Arabian Sea. The Narmada originates in eastern Madhya Pradesh ( India) and flows west across the state, through a narrow valley between the Vindhya Range and spurs of the Satpura Range. It flows into the Gulf of Khambhat. The Tapi (also known as Tapti) follows a shorter, parallel course, between south of the Narmada, flowing through the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat to drain into the Gulf of Khambhat.

==Ecology==
Most of the Satpura range was heavily forested; but the area has been subject to gradual deforestation in recent decades, although significant stands of forests remain. These forest enclaves provide habitat to several at risk and endangered species, including the Bengal tiger (&quot;Panthera tigris tigris&quot;), Barasingha, gaur (&quot;Bos gaurus&quot;), dhole (&quot;Cuon alpinus&quot;), sloth bear (&quot;Melursus ursinus&quot;), chousingha (&quot;Tetracerus quadricornis&quot;), and blackbuck (&quot;Antilope cervicapra&quot;).

However, Satpura is now famous for numerous tiger reserves. Once upon a time, it was ruled by wild Indian elephants and lion and Asiatic cheetahs.

Several protected areas have been earmarked in the area, including the Kanha, Pench, Gugamal and Satpura National Parks, Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve, Melghat Tiger Reserve and the Bori Reserve Forest.

The Satpura Foundation is a grass-roots organization that coordinates conservation efforts in the area, which continue to face challenges from development and infrastructure projects, logging and poaching.

== Tourism ==
The national parks, hill stations, reserves and towns in the Satpura range attract hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. Places listed here are from East to west

*Amarkantak (NLK &quot;Amarakaṇṭaka&quot;), also called &quot;Teerthraj&quot; (the king of pilgrimages) is a pilgrim town and a Nagar Panchayat in Anuppur, Madhya Pradesh, India. The Amarkantak region is a unique natural heritage area and is the meeting point of the Vindhya and the Satpura Ranges, with the Maikal Hills being the fulcrum. This is where the Narmada River, the Son River and Johila River emerge. Popular 15th-century Indian mystic and poet Kabir is said to have meditated on &quot;Kabir Chabutra&quot;, also called the platform of Kabir situated in the town of Amarkantak.
*Bandhavgarh National Park, is one of the popular national parks in Madhya Pradesh located near satpura range in the Umaria district of Madhya Pradesh, located north of Amarkantak. Bandhavgarh was declared a national park in 1968, with an area of 105 km2. The buffer is spread over the forest divisions of Umaria and Katni and totals 437 km2. The park derives its name from the most prominent hillock of the area, which is said to be given by Hindu Lord Rama to his brother Lakshmana to keep a watch on Lanka (Ceylon). Hence the name Bandhavgarh (Sanskrit: Brother&#x27;s Fort). This park has a large biodiversity. The density of the tiger population at Bandhavgarh is one of the highest known in India. The park has a large breeding population of leopards, and various species of deer. Maharaja Martand Singh of Rewa captured the first white tiger in this region in 1951. This white tiger, Mohan, is now stuffed and on display in the palace of the Maharajas of Rewa.
*Kanha National Park is a national park and a tiger reserve near the range in Mandla and Balaghat districts of Madhya Pradesh, India.

<doc id="807049" wikidata="Q1041306" url="?curid=807049" title="Carl and the Passions – &quot;So Tough&quot;">
<text>Carl and the Passions – &quot;So Tough&quot; is the 18th studio album by American rock band the Beach Boys, released May 15, 1972 on Brother/Reprise. The album is a significant musical departure for the band and is the first to feature the Flames&#x27; Blondie Chaplin and Ricky Fataar as additions to their official line-up. It sold poorly and was met with lukewarm reviews, but later gained stature as a cult favorite among fans.

The album peaked at number 50 in the U.S. and number 25 in the UK. It produced two singles, &quot;You Need a Mess of Help to Stand Alone&quot; and &quot;Marcella&quot;, both of which failed to chart in the U.S. Initial American pressings of the album included the band&#x27;s 1966 release &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; as a bonus record. Band member Bruce Johnston left the group during the album&#x27;s recording. In 2022, an expanded version of the album was packaged within the compilation &quot;Sail On Sailor – 1972&quot;.

==Background==

In June 1969, Carl Wilson attended a nightclub performance by the South African band the Flames in London. Impressed by what he saw, he later invited the group to the United States to sign with the Beach Boys&#x27; record label, Brother Records. From 1970 to 1971, the Flames were the Beach Boys&#x27; supporting act. Carl also produced the group&#x27;s first album, &quot;The Flame&quot;, released in March 1971 as the only non-Beach Boys album ever issued by Brother. After Dennis Wilson injured his hand, leaving him unable to play drums for a period, he was substituted onstage by the Flames&#x27; Ricky Fataar (and briefly touring musician Mike Kowalski).

The Beach Boys&#x27; second album on Reprise Records, &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;, was released in August 1971 to critical acclaim and reached the U.S. and UK top 40. In late 1971, some reports stated that Dennis had left the group to work on his first solo album. According to biographer David Leaf, &quot;Dennis was [at that time] constantly quitting [the band] or getting fired and then rejoining.&quot; By then, Fataar and the Flames&#x27; guitarist Blondie Chaplin were participating in the Beach Boys&#x27; recording sessions, and at Carl&#x27;s and manager Jack Rieley&#x27;s behest, soon became official members. Writing in &quot;The Beach Boys Diary&quot;, music historian Keith Badman states,

On February 29, 1972, the group held a press conference in London, where they announced the new additions in their line-up, as well as the imminent release of the album &quot;Smile&quot;, which had been shelved since 1967. &quot;Smile&quot; was never delivered; Leaf writes that the purpose of the latter announcement may have been to mislead Reprise into allowing the group more time to prepare the album that became &quot;Carl and the Passions&quot;. Bruce Johnston, who had joined the group in 1965, left the Beach Boys in April 1972 due to creative differences between him and his bandmates.

==Production==
Sessions for the Beach Boys&#x27; third Reprise album lasted from December 4, 1971 to April 13, 1972, and were held largely at the band&#x27;s private studio. Most of the basic tracks were recorded in December 1971, with the remainder of the album finished during the following April. The members worked in three separate factions: Carl, Fataar, and Chaplin; Love and Jardine; and Dennis with touring musician Daryl Dragon. Fataar stated, &quot;It was just all done very piecemeal. Somebody would be cutting a track over at Village Recorders and somebody else would be recording at Sunset [...] It was an &#x27;in between touring&#x27; kind of an album. [...] We kept changing studios all the time. Perhaps that&#x27;s why it sounds so bad.&quot;

During this time, Brian Wilson, who had reduced his contributions to the group, was largely preoccupied with hanging out with Tandyn Almer. Wilson was absent for most of the sessions, and was more involved with producing the 1972 self-titled debut album by Spring, a collaboration with David Sandler. Chaplin stated, &quot;We recorded some tracks in the studio at Brian&#x27;s home. But most of the time he was up in his bedroom while we were working downstairs.&quot; In an interview held shortly after the release of &quot;Carl and the Passions&quot;, Johnston said: &quot;I spoke to Brian a couple of weeks ago and he told me that he really didn&#x27;t have too much to do with this album. [...] I don&#x27;t hear his voice very much on this album.&quot; Wilson&#x27;s participation on the album&#x27;s songs was limited to the three that he had co-written.

==Songs and outtakes==
Brian&#x27;s three song contributions were &quot;You Need a Mess of Help to Stand Alone&quot; (co-written with Rieley and co-produced with Carl), &quot;Marcella&quot; (co-written with Rieley and Almer), and &quot;He Come Down&quot; (co-written with Al Jardine and Love). &quot;Marcella&quot; was written about a masseuse from the Circus Maximus, a Santa Monica Boulevard massage parlor that Brian had frequented. &quot;You Need a Mess of Help to Stand Alone&quot; was originally written with Almer as &quot;Beatrice from Baltimore&quot; before the lyrics were revised by Rieley. &quot;He Comes Down&quot; was influenced by gospel and features Brian on keyboards and backing vocals. Love said, &quot;On that one we&#x27;re singing like a whole black church choir and it&#x27;s a lot of fun. Basically it underscores the teachings of Jesus and Krishna and the Maharishi.&quot;

Dennis&#x27;s two song contributions – &quot;Make it Good&quot; and &quot;Cuddle Up&quot; (originally titled &quot;Old Movie&quot;) – were written with Daryl Dragon and originally intended for a cancelled solo album. Both of the songs are in a heavy orchestral style that is unlike any of the other songs on the largely R&amp;B-based record. &quot;All This Is That&quot; (written by Carl, Jardine, and Love) was inspired by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi&#x27;s Transcendental Meditation teachings and the Robert Frost poem &quot;The Road Not Taken&quot;.

The Fataar–Chaplin team contributed two rock songs, &quot;Here She Comes&quot; and &quot;Hold On Dear Brother&quot;. Biographer Mark Dillon writes, &quot;The piano on their groovy cut &#x27;Here She Comes&#x27; sounds like Traffic and the harmonies are in the Crosby, Stills and Nash vein. [...] Blondie sings the lead, as he does on [...] &#x27;Hold On Dear Brother,&#x27; to which Ricky adds haunting steel guitar.&quot;

Unused tracks include &quot;Oh Sweet Something&quot;, &quot;Out in the Country&quot;, &quot;Spark in the Dark&quot;, &quot;Rooftop Harry&quot;, &quot;Body Talk (Grease Job)&quot; and a medley of &quot;Gimme Some Lovin&#x27;&quot; / &quot;I Need Your Love&quot;, all of which were released on the 2022 compilation &quot;Sail On Sailor – 1972&quot;. &quot;Rooftop Harry&quot; is an instrumental that features Brian playing piano, electric bass, toy piano, and a calliope. Bruce Johnston recorded a discarded track, &quot;Ten Years Harmony&quot; , with a re-recording by the supergroup California Music later released in 1974. The song later evolved into &quot;Endless Harmony&quot; from &quot;Keepin&#x27; the Summer Alive&quot; (1980). Still-unreleased material that was recorded during the album&#x27;s sessions include &quot;Funky Fever&quot; and a cover version of Stephen Stills&#x27; &quot;Change Partners&quot;.

==Packaging and bonus disc==
Rieley recalled, &quot;The original concept was to do an album called &quot;Landlocked&quot;, but they were under pressure to tour. There wasn&#x27;t time to develop the depth that album would have required.&quot; Instead, the band went with the title &quot;Carl and the Passions – &quot;So Tough&quot;&quot; as a nod toward Carl&#x27;s increased leading role in the Beach Boys.

Some reports, including from the Wilsons&#x27; mother, state that &quot;Carl and the Passions&quot; had been a high school band formed by Brian, Mike Love, Carl, and another friend. Brian said that he had named the early band &quot;Carl and the Passions&quot; as a way to entice his unwilling brother into the group. However, Carl himself denied that such a group ever existed.

The inner sleeve included a group portrait featuring all the members together, including Brian. However, owing to his absence during much of the album&#x27;s recording, his visage had to be doctored into the photo.

In the U.S., &quot;Carl and the Passions&quot; was originally packaged as a two-disc set, paired with &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; (1966), at no additional cost to consumers. Mike Love explained that the group had recently bought the rights to five of their out-of-print Capitol albums for seven years. Love said, &quot;The thing we want to do is a combination of bringing everyone up to date and giving everyone a chance to get an old collectors&#x27; item that has been discontinued by the record company. Americans have to write to England if they want copies of albums like &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;.&quot; He credited the idea to Warner/Reprise.

Music journalist Peter Doggett states that the bonus record was originally planned to have been &quot;Smile&quot;. &quot;That threat brought Brian Wilson down from his bedroom, and &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; was reissued instead.&quot;

==Release==

Released on May 15, 1972, &quot;Carl and the Passions – &quot;So Tough&quot;&quot; reached number 50 in the U.S. The release was accompanied by lead single &quot;You Need a Mess of Help to Stand Alone&quot;, which failed to chart. A second single, &quot;Marcella&quot;, released on June 26, also failed to chart. According to music historian Keith Badman, the &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; pairing provoked &quot;an unfavourable comparison with the landmark 1966 LP and contribute[d] to the album stalling [...] in the US charts.&quot; It became the band&#x27;s worst-selling on Reprise. In the UK, where &quot;Carl and the Passions&quot; was issued as a standalone disc, the album reached number 25.

From May 5 to June 3, the group toured Europe and the UK. The core members were supported onstage by guitarists Ed Carter and Billy Hinsche, keyboardists Daryl Dragon and Toni Tennille, as well as a horn section and two additional percussionists. Their set list included &quot;Here She Comes&quot; and &quot;You Need a Mess of Help to Stand Alone&quot;. They appeared on &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; on May 16 and &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on May 31 (aired June 8). Elton John and Keith Moon joined them onstage at a concert in London. At the end of the tour, the band reconvened at their new headquarters in Holland and recorded what became the &quot;Holland&quot; album.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Carl and the Passions – &quot;So Tough&quot;&quot; failed to impress most critics. According to Leaf, the &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; pairing in America &quot;helped make &quot;So Tough&quot; seem like the Beach Boys&#x27; worst album ever. Long-time Beach Boys fans were incensed that two of the eight cuts were by &#x27;outsiders&#x27; (Blondie and Ricky), and nobody was particularly stimulated by the preachy tone of the TM tunes.&quot; General consensus holds &quot;Marcella&quot; to be the LP&#x27;s finest song.

Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called the album &quot;[f]airly pleasant, but even the highlights aren&#x27;t all that hot.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Stephen Davis felt that only four tracks were &quot;acceptable&quot;, and that Brian&#x27;s lack of genuine involvement hurt the album. &quot;NME&quot;″s Josh Ingham called it &quot;probably the least successful of the Beach Boys&#x27; albums.&quot; Conversely, in his review for &quot;The San Diego Door&quot;, Cameron Crowe wrote, &quot;&quot;So Tough&quot; finds some excellent music with no trace of anything left over from the &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; days. I coulda sworn &#x27;Hold On Dear Brother&#x27; was the Band.&quot;

Retrospectively, AllMusic&#x27;s John Bush wrote, &quot;The songwriting was neither as solid as 1970&#x27;s &quot;Sunflower&quot; nor as idiosyncratic as 1971&#x27;s &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up &quot;though, and the few fans left from the &#x27;60s were undoubtedly turned off – if not by the weak songs, then certainly by the muddy sound. Still, there are a few moments of beauty&quot;. Doggett opined, &quot;There were sublime moments [...] But unlike &quot;Sunflower&quot; and &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; it sounded nothing like the work of a coherent band.&quot; He noted that Dennis&#x27; contributions were &quot;magnificent epics, explorations of the heart in sound&quot; that showed &quot;his vision was way out of kilter the rest of the band&quot;

Among biographers, John Tobler decreed in 1978 that &quot;Carl and the Passions&quot; was &quot;generally accepted as being the lamest Beach Boy album since the fragmented &quot;20/20&quot; [and] bears the mark of a project with too little thought behind it.&quot; Peter Ames Carlin found the album to be &quot;a schizophrenic affair&quot; and &quot;stylistically meandering&quot;. Jon Stebbins writes that apart from &quot;Marcella&quot;, &quot;Cuddle Up&quot;, and &quot;Make It Good&quot;, the album &quot;is forgettable&quot;.

In his 2016 memoir, &quot;Good Vibrations: My Life as a Beach Boy&quot;, Mike Love referred to &quot;Carl and the Passions&quot; as &quot;a disjointed rush job, hastily assembled between live gigs, that even Carl admitted was weak overall [...] More than anything, the album emphasized how confused we were about our brand.&quot;

==Influence and legacy==
&quot;Carl and the Passions&quot; has since become a &quot;cult favorite&quot; among some fans. Elton John penned liner notes for the 2000 CD reissue, writing: &#x27;This is an album which I have loved for a long time... &quot;Carl and the Passions: So Tough&quot; has moments of breathtaking genius and experimentation. When this record was released, I remember how different and fresh it sounded. It still does&#x27;. In 1993, the band Saint Etienne titled their album &quot;So Tough&quot; as an homage to the Beach Boys. Likewise, they also named their compilation of the same year, &quot;You Need a Mess of Help to Stand Alone&quot;, after the Beach Boys song.

<text>Dover Publications, also known as Dover Books, is an American book publisher founded in 1941 by Hayward and Blanche Cirker. It primarily reissues books that are out of print from their original publishers. These are often, but not always, books in the public domain. The original published editions may be scarce or historically significant. Dover republishes these books, making them available at a significantly reduced cost.

==Classic reprints==
Dover reprints classic works of literature, classical sheet music, and public-domain images from the 18th and 19th centuries. Dover also publishes an extensive collection of mathematical, scientific, and engineering texts. It often targets its reprints at a niche market, such as woodworking. Starting in 2015, the company branched out into graphic novel reprints, overseen by Dover acquisitions editor and former comics writer and editor Drew Ford.

Most Dover reprints are photo facsimiles of the originals, retaining the original pagination and typeset, sometimes with a new introduction. Dover will usually add new and more colorful cover art to its paper-bound editions. They retitle some books to reflect modern dialect and categories. For example, the book &quot;Woodward&#x27;s National Architect&quot; was retitled &quot;A Victorian Housebuilder&#x27;s Guide&quot;.

==History==
The Cirkers started the business selling remaindered textbooks by mail. The company published its first book, &quot;Tables of Functions with Formulas and Curves&quot;, when the German copyright was voided by the United States as a result of World War II. The book was an unexpected success and established the Dover business model of publishing esoteric works at a low price. One of Dover&#x27;s best sellers was Albert Einstein&#x27;s &quot;The Principle of Relativity&quot;, which Einstein reluctantly agreed to republish despite his concerns that it was outdated.

Dover helped to transform the paperback book market. In 1951 it issued some of the earliest standard-sized paperbacks, a format that became known as a trade paperback. Since the 1960s, the vast majority of Dover&#x27;s titles have been paper-bound books of various sizes. Dover paperbacks had sewn pages, unlike most paperbacks which were held together with glue and subject to page drop-out.

Beginning in the 1950s Dover also issued a series of &quot;Listen &amp; Learn&quot; language courses prepared primarily using teachers from Columbia University.

For a time, Dover also published a catalog of LP phonograph records. Some, such as selected recordings of Schubert&#x27;s solo and chamber works featuring pianist Friedrich Wührer, were reissues of earlier monaural releases from other labels. Noteworthy among Dover&#x27;s original issues was an extensive series documenting pianist Beveridge Webster in literature ranging from Beethoven&#x27;s Hammerklavier sonata to the second piano sonata by Roger Sessions. In keeping with its thrifty philosophy, by using lower recording levels, leading to narrower grooves, Dover was able to include more minutes than usual on each LP; however, the lower recording levels meant more noise and more vulnerability to scratches. Dover&#x27;s foray into recordings was not as successful as its core business of book republication, and the company eventually abandoned it.

Starting in the 1990s Dover has published a specialized line of low-cost reprints of public domain literature known as &quot;Dover Thrift Editions&quot;, which are generally priced at US$5 or less. They also have several lines of foreign language books.

Hayward Cirker died in 2000 at the age of 82. In that same year, Dover Publications was acquired by Courier Corporation.

Courier was acquired by RR Donnelley in 2015. RR Donnelly split into three in 2016; Dover became part of LSC Communications. 

In 2020, LSC Communications, Inc. and 21 affiliated debtors filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The company was purchased in December 2020 by the private equity holding company Atlas Holdings.

Blanche Cirker died in 2022.

<doc id="807060" wikidata="Q2602885" url="?curid=807060" title="Crossley Motors">
<text>Crossley Motors was an English motor vehicle manufacturer based in Manchester, England. It produced approximately 19,000 cars from 1904 until 1938, 5,500 buses from 1926 until 1958, and 21,000 goods and military vehicles from 1914 to 1945.

Crossley Brothers, originally manufacturers of textile machinery and rubber processing plant, began the licensed manufacture of the Otto internal combustion engine before 1880. The firm started car production in 1903, building around 650 vehicles in their first year.

The company was established as a division of engine builders Crossley Brothers, but from 1910 became a stand-alone company. Although founded as a car maker, they were major suppliers of vehicles to British Armed Forces during World War I, and in the 1920s moved into bus manufacture. With re-armament in the 1930s, car-making was run down, and stopped completely in 1936. During World War II output was again concentrated on military vehicles. Bus production resumed in 1945 but no more cars were made. The directors decided in the late 1940s that the company was too small to survive alone and agreed to a takeover by AEC. Production at the Crossley factories finally stopped in 1958.

==Overview==
Crossley Motors Ltd was first registered on 11 April 1906 (and re-registered with a different company number in 1910) as the vehicle manufacturing arm of Crossley Brothers. The first car was actually built in 1903 to a design by James S. Critchley, who had been with Daimler and exhibited at the Society of Motor Manufacturers&#x27; Exhibition at Crystal Palace in February 1904, but the parent company saw a future for these new machines and decided a separate company was required.

Critchley left the company in 1906 and was replaced by the team of Walter James Iden, A. W. Reeves and Hubert Woods who introduced the 12-14hp (later 15hp) and 20hp models. 

In 1920, Crossley Motors bought 34,283 (68.5%) of the 50,000 issued shares of the nearby firm of Avro. Crossley took over Avro&#x27;s car manufacturing business and Avro continued its aircraft manufacturing operations independently. In 1928, Crossley had to sell its shares in Avro to Armstrong Siddeley to pay for the losses incurred by the Willys Overland Crossley venture.

After World War II, the directors decided that the company was not large enough to prosper and looked for a partner. This resulted in a take over by Associated Equipment Company (AEC) in 1948. AEC&#x27;s parent company changed its name to Associated Commercial Vehicles and Crossley became a division of it. Production of the Crossley range of vehicles continued at the Stockport plant until 1952. After that date, production turned to badge-engineered AEC designs and bus bodywork, until the factory was closed in 1958 and sold in 1959.

Although no longer trading, the company was never formally wound up. In 1969, AEC&#x27;s new owner, British Leyland, restarted the company with a new name – Leyland National – and production of single-decker buses recommenced.

==Factories==
Production was originally in the Crossley Brothers factory in Openshaw, Manchester but in 1907 moved to a nearby site in Napier Street, Gorton. (Napier Street was later renamed Crossley Street).

With the steady increase in vehicle production, the limits of the Gorton site were in turn soon reached, and in 1914 a further 48 acre (194,000 m2) site was bought in Heaton Chapel, Stockport which became the Errwood Park Works. Construction of the new factory started in 1915, and although intended to relieve congestion on the old site, it was rapidly given over to war work. The western half of the site, built in 1917, but only managed by Crossley Motors, became National Aircraft Factory No. 2. In 1919, this factory was bought from the government and became the Willys Overland Crossley plant, but was eventually sold to Fairey Aviation in 1934. In 1938, the eastern side became another aircraft factory, this time managed by Fairey, and after World War II, it became the final home of Crossley Motors. Re-armament work caused the search for more space and in 1938 a factory was opened in Greencroft Mill, Hyde, about east of Errwood Park.

==Labour activism==
Jack Munro was a shop steward at Crossley Motors during the First World War. He was also active in the shop stewards movement in Manchester.
He played leading role in the 1917 strike at the factory. As well as Munro, Harry Ingle, Jack Halstead and Fred Flood were active in the Plebs League and part of the Crossley Shop Stewards Committee. They organised a class of 109 students studying economics from a marxist perspective. Munro and Ingle went on to play a part in the Manchester Labour College.

==Vehicles==



Production of the first cars was on a small scale but from 1909 when a new range was introduced it rapidly built up. In that year the 20 hp was introduced (later called the 20/25) and this was taken up by the War Office and from 1913 it was ordered for the new Royal Flying Corps (RFC). The outbreak of World War I resulted in a rapid expansion of the RFC, and by 1918 they had over 6,000 of the vehicles with staff car, tender (light truck), and ambulance bodies.

Crossley 25/30 hp Tenders were used by British paramilitary police (&quot;Black and Tans&quot; and the Auxiliary Division) in Ireland during the Irish War of Independence (19191922). The National Army of the new Irish Free State continued to use them for troop transport throughout the Civil War period, but they were worked hard: of 454 originally supplied, only 57 were in service by 1926 with a further 66 being overhauled or repaired. The 20/25 model was also the first vehicle to be supplied to London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police Flying Squad in 1920, some of which were fitted with radio equipment.

Car production resumed after World War I and a new model, the 19.6, was launched in 1921 and joined in 1922 by the smaller 2.4 litre 14 hp model that would become the company&#x27;s best seller. The 19.6 was replaced by the 2.7 litre 18/50 in 1925 fitted with Crossley&#x27;s first six-cylinder engine and this was enlarged in 1927 to 3.2 litres in the 20.9. Crossley were the first British car company to offer a factory fitted car radio in 1933. Although the large cars would continue to be available, a range of small models fitted with Coventry Climax engines was announced in 1931 but sales of the cars slowly declined and the last ones were made in 1937.

By the late 1920s the market for hand-made cars began to disappear and the company moved into the bus market and launched its first model, the Eagle single decker in 1928. Although some double deck bodies were fitted to the Eagle, the Condor launched in 1930 was the first chassis to be designed for double decker bodies. The Condor could also be ordered with a diesel engine, made by Gardner at first, and became the first British double deck bus to be offered with diesel power. The big selling pre-war bus was the Mancunian with first deliveries in 1933. This was available as both a double and single decker.

In addition to cars and buses the company also made goods and military vehicles. At first these were conversions of the car models but starting with the BGT1 in 1923 specialised chassis designs were produced. Two Crossley trucks based on the 25/30 car chassis were from 1924 to 1926 the first vehicles to be driven from Cape Town to Cairo by the Court Treatt expedition. A range of heavy goods vehicles starting with the 1931 diesel-powered 12-ton payload Atlas was announced but only a few were made as the factory was by then gearing up to concentrate on buses and military orders. From 1936 military production was rapidly ramped up with British re-armament at first with &quot;IGL&quot; models but from 1940 with a four-wheel drive &quot;FWD&quot; chassis in both tractor unit and truck form. By 1945 over 10,000 FWDs had been made.

After World War II there was a boom in the bus industry as wartime losses needed to be replaced. A new range of bus chassis was launched, comprising the DD42 and SD42 models, suitable for double- and single-deck bodywork respectively. Crossley won what was then the largest ever British export order for buses with a contract with the Dutch government (150 complete SD42 buses plus 775 supplied as chassis only). By the late 1940s bus orders were decreasing and it became clear that the company was too small to continue as an independent manufacturer and in 1948 they were sold to AEC. The last Crossley chassis was made in 1952, but body production continued at Erwood Park until 1958.

<text>Paradroid is a Commodore 64 computer game written by Andrew Braybrook and published by Hewson Consultants in 1985. It is a shoot &#x27;em up with puzzle elements and was critically praised at release. The objective is to clear a fleet of spaceships of hostile robots by destroying them or taking over them via a minigame. It was remade as &quot;Paradroid 90&quot; for the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST home computers and as Paradroid 2000 for the Acorn Archimedes. There exist several fan-made remakes for modern PCs. In 2004, the Commodore 64 version was re-released as a built-in game on the C64 Direct-to-TV, and in 2008 for the Wii Virtual Console in Europe.

==Gameplay==

Enemy forces have hijacked a space fleet by turning its robot consignment against the crew. The goal is to neutralize all the robots, thereby rescuing the humans. The players control a prototype influence device that allows them to move the hostile robots.

The game is set on a spaceship viewed from a top-down perspective. The ship consists of numerous rooms and levels, each one populated by hostile robots or &quot;androids&quot;. The player, in control of a special droid called the &quot;Influence Device&quot;, must destroy all the other droids on the ship. Each droid (including the player) is represented as a circle around a three-digit number. The numbers roughly correspond to the droid&#x27;s &quot;power&quot; or &quot;level&quot;, in that higher-numbered droids are tougher to destroy; there are 24 droid types.

The Influence Device is numbered &quot;001&quot;. The primary way in which the Influence Device destroys other droids is by &quot;linking&quot; with them, effectively taking over them. When the player takes over another droid, the previously controlled droid is destroyed.

Taking over a droid is done via a minigame involving basic circuit diagrams and logic gates. Each droid has one side of the screen, with a series of logic gates and circuits connected together. The droids have a number of &quot;power supplies&quot; that can apply power to one circuit. Higher-numbered droids have more power supplies. At the end of a short time period, the droid supplying the most power to the circuit &quot;wins&quot;. The logic gates are the key to allowing lower-numbered droids to beat higher-numbered droids. There is also a strategy in timing when power is applied to a circuit (as two supplies of power to the same circuit result in the later supplier of power gaining control of the circuit). It is possible for the transfer game to end in a draw. A replay will take place If this occurs.

In either case, the droid being controlled by the player is destroyed. If the player beats the droid in this minigame, they take control of that droid. If not, either the droid is destroyed and the player is returned to the game simply as the Influence Device (if they were previously controlling a different droid), or the player is killed, ending the game, if they were not already controlling another droid before the takeover attempt.

While in control of another droid, the player effectively acts as that droid, meaning the player has access to its maneuverability, armor, weapons and &quot;power supplies&quot; (used during the droid-control minigame). If the droid has weapons, the player can destroy other droids by shooting them instead of taking them over, though higher-numbered droids can require several shots to destroy and might fire back. The player has control of a droid only for a limited amount of time (which is inversely proportional to the droid&#x27;s number). If that time elapses, the controlled droid self-destructs and the player reverts to the Influence Device (001).

The spaceship has 20 decks, each with many rooms; the game has more than 400 screens. Doors and elevators connect the rooms and the decks. Only droids in the player&#x27;s line of sight are visible, although doors being operated by out-of-sight droids can be seen moving. Many rooms have computer terminals that provide access to maps of the current deck and the entire ship as well as droid information. Each droid can access information about itself and all lower-numbered droids (this access is available to the player based on the droid being controlled).

===Goals and challenges===
As well as achieving a high score, &quot;Paradroid&quot; players can aim to completely clear one or more ships of robots and to attain a successful transfer from the 001 Influence Device to the unstable 999 droid. Despite the instructions referring to a finite fleet, the Commodore 64 game never ends. When clearing the eighth ship called &quot;Itsnotardenuff&quot;, the players are just placed back on the ship with higher-ranking droids on each deck.

==History==
===Development===
During the development of the original game, Andrew Braybrook kept a diary that was published in &quot;Zzap!64&quot; magazine, in which he stated:

The game was influenced by several different computer games and movies, and was built on top of a previous game, &quot;Survive&quot;, developed by GEC Marconi. Author Andrew Braybrook said in a Retro Gamer interview that the droid-swapping idea came from an arcade game, &quot;Front Line&quot;, where the player could enter a tank and had to leave it when it got hit. In another Retro Gamer feature, Braybrook stated that the cover of the Black Sabbath album &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot; influenced him, where two droids &quot;interfacing&quot; can be observed, along with the corridors of the film &quot;Aliens&quot;. Development started right after Braybrook finished his previous game &quot;Gribbly&#x27;s Day Out&quot; and even shared some code with &quot;Gribbly&#x27;s&quot;. Later when Braybrook was working on &quot;Morpheus&quot;, he did another diary for Zzap!64 where he revealed that the then recently released Competition Edition of &quot;Paradroid&quot; was 50% faster than the original. In the same series, he revealed that they had redone the &quot;Paradroid&quot; graphics in the new (&quot;Morpheus&quot;) style, which was later released as &quot;Heavy Metal Paradroid&quot;. Andrew Braybrook did another diary during the development of &quot;Paradroid 90&quot; for &quot;Amiga Action&quot;.

===Versions===
* 1985 – &quot;Paradroid&quot;
* 1986 – &quot;Paradroid Competition Edition&quot; – Released as a double pack at Christmas with &quot;Uridium+&quot;, plays faster than the original, mainly due to scroll code enhancements.
* 1987 – &quot;Heavy Metal Paradroid&quot; – &quot;Paradroid&quot; with &quot;Morpheus&quot; style graphics (budget release in 1989).
* 1990 – &quot;Paradroid 90&quot; (Commodore Amiga, Atari ST)
* 1993 – &quot;Paradroid 2000&quot; (Acorn Archimedes)

===Reception===
The game has been heralded as one of the best original games to appear on the Commodore 64, as can be seen when the readers of &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; selected it as the best game on the platform:
 In 1993, &quot;Commodore Force&quot; ranked the game at number 14 on its list of the top 100 Commodore 64 games. Also in a 2002 Zzap!64 tribute publication, &quot;Paradroid&quot; via a community vote was ranked the best C64 game ever with the comment &quot;there is something about &quot;Paradroid&quot; that sets it apart from other C64 games&quot;.

When it originally came out, it received 97 out of 100 in the &quot;Zzap!64&quot; November 1985 issue with the comment &quot;THE classic shoot em up&quot;. It also received a &quot;Gold Medal&quot; where 98% is the highest score ever given in the magazine, once again 97 out of 100 with the remark &quot;A game no C64 gamer should be without&quot;, in 1989 for the re-issued &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; Edition. In November 1988, it was selected the second best Shoot &#x27;em up on the C64 and in December the same year, it was selected the third best game by &quot;Zzap!64&quot; magazine.

&quot;Info&quot; rated &quot;Paradroid&quot; four-plus stars out of five. Praising how all of the large game fit into the Commodore 64&#x27;s memory, the magazine concluded that &quot;if you like science fiction, arcade games, inspiring graphics, and intricate gameplay, you will LOVE &quot;Paradroid&quot;!&quot;.

&quot;Paradroid 90&quot; received &quot;C+VG Hit&quot; with a score of 93% in &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; and was ranked the 22nd best game of all time by &quot;Amiga Power&quot;.

==Other clones and games inspired by &quot;Paradroid&quot;==

Several Freeware or free and open source software clones of the game have been published:
* &quot;Nighthawk&quot; for Linux.
* &quot;Paradroid&quot; for Windows and Linux, current version 1.3 (March 2004), which garnered favourable reviews at the Home of the Underdogs.
* &quot;Freedroid Classic&quot; for Windows, Linux, OS X and Sharp Zaurus, current version 1.0.2 (2004)
* &quot;Project Paradroid&quot; for Windows, current version 2 (2006)
* &quot;Paradroid Redux&quot; is a reimplementation of the original Commodore 64 code, fixing bugs and adding features.
* &quot;Freedroid RPG&quot; is a Diablo-style role-playing video game based on &quot;Freedroid Classic&quot;, inheriting only the main theme of fighting hostile robots, the takeover-game, and the robot models.
* &quot;Urbanoids&quot;

===Quazatron===
Andrew Braybrook&#x27;s Graftgold partner, Steve Turner, wrote a version of &quot;Paradroid&quot; for the ZX Spectrum called &quot;Quazatron&quot; in 1986, also published by Hewson. Gameplay was similar, but on an isometric playing field, and based in cities rather than spacecraft.

<text>Alabama Public Television (APT) is a state network of PBS member television stations serving the U.S. state of Alabama. It is operated by the Alabama Educational Television Commission (AETC), an agency of the Alabama state government which holds the licenses for all of the PBS member stations licensed in the state. The broadcast signals of the nine stations cover almost all of the state, as well as parts of Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and Tennessee. The network produces public affairs, cultural, natural history, and documentary programming; broadcast and online education programs for classroom use and teacher professional development; and electronic field trips serving K-12 students.

APT&#x27;s offices and network operations center are located in Birmingham. The network also maintains studios adjacent to Patterson Field in the state capital of Montgomery, as well as a small secondary studio in the basement of the Alabama State House (not to be confused with the capitol building). APT also operated a studio in Washington, D.C., in partnership with the Folger Shakespeare Library. The AETC has operated a single public radio station, WLRH (89.3 FM) in Huntsville, since 1977.

==History==
Alabama was one of the earliest states to enter into educational television broadcasting when the Alabama General Assembly created the Alabama Educational Television Commission in 1953. In an unusual move at the time, the Commission requested allocations for four stations that would air the same programming at all times, fed from a central studio in Birmingham. At the time, it was apparent that much of the state outside of Birmingham, Montgomery, and Mobile was too poor and too rural to support stand-alone educational stations. The Commission thus wanted to ensure that all of the state&#x27;s children would have access to educational television.

After two years of preparation, the AETC began the nation&#x27;s ninth educational television station, WEDM in Munford, serving the eastern central part of the state. The transmitter was located atop Cheaha Mountain, the highest point in Alabama. When WBIQ in Birmingham came online in April 1955, Alabama became the first state in the nation with an educational television network. Alabama Educational Television made its first broadcast as a network shortly after WBIQ signed on. Since then, 25 other states have started public television networks, most based on Alabama&#x27;s model. The network changed its name to the Alabama Public Television Network in the late 1960s, and shortened the name to simply Alabama Public Television in 1988.
WAIQ in Andalusia (now WDIQ in Dozier) went on the air in August 1956, bringing APT to southern Alabama for the first time before being reassigned to Montgomery in December 1962. WAAY-TV (channel 25) was issued a construction permit in Huntsville in 1962, but never signed on the air (the owners at the time would buy WAFG-TV, on channel 31, instead in 1963). Channel 25 in Huntsville would later become WHIQ in 1965. WAIQ was the first APT station to broadcast a digital signal in 2003, on UHF channel 14, but that signal was later moved to channel 27 on account of Montgomery station WSFA airing its digital signal on channel 14. Commercially licensed station WALA-TV in Mobile donated its former transmitter in Spanish Fort to APT in 1964, allowing WEIQ to bring the network to Alabama&#x27;s Gulf Coast counties that November. WEIQ&#x27;s transmitter power was increased during the 1980s.

AETC eventually built a network of nine transmitters covering the state for 16 years ending in 1970. In the 1970s and 1980s, several stations in the metropolitan areas of Alabama aired weekly &quot;cutaway&quot; programs, produced by local entities instead of APT, of interest to their particular viewing areas, but those were eliminated in the 1990s. Since then, all APT stations air the same programming at all times.

The AETC took over the operation of Huntsville public radio station WLRH in 1977, assuming control from the public library system, which had started the station the previous year but found itself unable to manage or fund it properly.

In January 1982, a major ice storm caused the collapse of the WCIQ tower, which was then rebuilt.

In August 2004, APT began datacasting on its digital broadcast signals to distribute digital multimedia content to ten elementary and secondary schools, in a pilot program. The datacasting model was replaced by APTPLUS, an online distribution of multimedia content that became available to every school in Alabama via the Internet. Every public school in Alabama registered to use APTPLUS within its first year of operation. Many private school teachers and home-schooling families are also registered users.
For more than a quarter century, Alabama Public Television aired a nightly public affairs program, &quot;For the Record&quot;, covering statewide news and Alabama politics. The longest-running program of its kind on a PBS member station or regional or state network, it won an award for Best Local News Program from the National Educational Telecommunications Association (NETA), an organization of public television stations. &quot;Capitol Journal&quot; succeeded &quot;For the Record&quot; in 2008 and is produced at APT&#x27;s State House studio in Montgomery.

APT began broadcasting a high definition channel (APT HD) in 2005. In December 2006 it launched a digital &quot;how-to&quot; channel featuring established cooking, gardening, decorating, crafts, and sewing programs called APT Create. A third digital channel, APT IQ, debuted in March 2007. Originally called APT IQ, the channel became APT World in October 2012 and offers news and documentary programming. 2017 brought the addition of PBS Kids statewide.

==Board members==
The members of the Alabama Educational Television Commission Board as of 2012 are Ferris W. Stephens, chairman, Birmingham (6th congressional district), Gregory O. Griffin Sr., Vice-chairman, Montgomery (2nd congressional district), Dr. Rodney D.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
Although the DTV Delay Act extended the mandatory deadline to June 12, 2009, APT shut down the analog signals of all ten stations as originally scheduled on February 17, 2009.
* WAIQ shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 26; the station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 27. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station&#x27;s virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 26.
* WBIQ shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 10; the station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 53, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to its analog-era VHF channel 10.
* WCIQ shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 7; the station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 56, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to its analog-era VHF channel 7.
* WDIQ shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 2; the station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition VHF channel 11 to channel 10. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station&#x27;s virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 2.
* WEIQ shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 42; the station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 41. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station&#x27;s virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 42.
* WFIQ shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 36; the station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 22. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station&#x27;s virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 36.
* WGIQ shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 43; the station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 44. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station&#x27;s virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 43.
* WHIQ shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 25; the station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 24. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station&#x27;s virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 25.
* WIIQ shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 41; the station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 19. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station&#x27;s virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 41.

On July 29, 2010, WBIQ received a construction permit to move its digital channel from channel 10 to channel 39. The station has returned to its analog-era VHF channel 10 during the 2019 television repack.

During the 2019 television repack, WCIQ moved to VHF channel 12, while WEIQ and WGIQ relocated to UHF channel 30.

*&quot;Bookmark with Don Noble&quot;, literary discussion program airing since 1988
*&quot;Capitol Journal&quot;, political discussion show hosted by journalist Don Daley for 24 years until 2021
*&quot;Discovering Alabama&quot;, natural history show airing since 1985

*&quot;Journey Proud&quot;, a show about the cultural history of Alabama

==Controversies==
In 1976, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) delayed the renewal of, then briefly revoked, AETC&#x27;s licenses due to APT&#x27;s refusal to air programs about the Vietnam War or the African-American community. APT management feared that airing these types of programs would cause angry public officials to cut the network&#x27;s funding and put the network&#x27;s future in jeopardy. Therefore, APT followed orders by state officials not to air certain programming during the 1960s and 1970s. However, it has taken a more independent stance over the last 40 or so years.

In May 2019, APT became one of two PBS state networks, along with the Arkansas Educational Television Network, to decline to broadcast an episode of the animated children&#x27;s series &quot;Arthur&quot; because it features a same-sex wedding; APT opted to air a rerun of an earlier episode instead. The program director, Mike McKenzie, said that it would be &quot;a violation of trust&quot; for the station to broadcast the episode, and said that the decision was made because some children might watch the episode without their parents, and some children younger than the episode&#x27;s target demographic might watch the segment. Alabama Public Television had also rejected an episode of the spin-off &quot;Postcards from Buster&quot; that depicted a same-sex couple in 2005. PBS offered free online streaming of the episode for a limited time to families desiring to view it.

<doc id="807098" wikidata="Q4167671" url="?curid=807098" title="Sport in Latvia">
<text>[[Sport]] in [[Latvia]] includes basketball, football, ice hockey, athletics (track), rugby, tennis, cycling, and others. Ice hockey is the most popular of the Latvian sports and is closely followed by basketball. Some of Latvia&#x27;s most notable athletes include hockey player Sandis Ozoliņš, football player Māris Verpakovskis, Olympic javelin thrower Jānis Lūsis, two-time Olympic BMX champion Maris Strombergs, and basketball player Kristaps Porziņģis. The national sport of Latvia is ice hockey.

==Ice hockey==

Ice hockey is the most popular sport in Latvia. Its professional league is the Latvian Hockey Higher League, held since 1931. In Latvia there are also several amateur hockey leagues. Ice hockey has been played in Latvia since the 1920s. Latvia is a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), its national team has participated in several World Championships and the 1936 Winter Olympic Games. After Latvia was occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940, its membership in the IIHF was interrupted. Latvians had a significant role in establishing ice hockey in the Soviet Union. Latvia&#x27;s Dinamo Rīga team was one of eleven teams which played in the first Soviet championship tournament in the winter of 1946/1947. The Latvian Harijs Mellups was the goaltender for the Soviet Union National team in its first international game in 1948.

Latvian hockey experienced a decline in the 1960s, with Dinamo Rīga being relegated from the Soviet High League (&quot;vysshaya liga&quot;) to the first league and then even to the second league. It began a comeback in the 1970s, under the coach Viktor Tikhonov who would later go on to coach CSKA Moscow and the Soviet national team. In the 1973/1974 season, Dinamo Rīga returned to the Elite League where it stayed until the end of Soviet Union in 1991.

In 1975, Viktor Hatulev of Dinamo Rīga became the first ice hockey player from the Soviet Union drafted by the National Hockey League (NHL) but never had a chance to play, as Soviet players were not allowed to play for foreign teams. Helmuts Balderis was the brightest Latvian hockey star of the 1970s and 1980s, and achieved all-time scoring records (scoring 333 goals in Soviet championships) for Latvian forwards. He was the leading scorer in the Soviet Elite League twice (1977 and 1983) and the Player of the Year once (1977). Balderis also played for the Soviet National team, being on the losing side of the Miracle on Ice game in 1980 but winning the World Championships on other occasions (1978, 1979 and 1983). Balderis was named the best forward of the 1977 Ice Hockey World Championship. Despite his continuing high scoring results, he was not selected for the Soviet National team for the 1984 Winter Olympics, possibly because of political or national reasons (in those years the Soviet team consisted of sportsmen only from Moscow ice hockey teams, any other Soviet cities or Soviet republics were not represented). Thus Balderis became the all-time top scorer among those Soviet ice hockey forwards who played for the national team but had never been awarded the Olympic gold medal. Goaltenders Vitālijs Samoilovs and Artūrs Irbe also starred for the Soviet team in the 1980s, Irbe was the best goaltender of the 1990 Ice Hockey World Championship. Samoilovs was the backup goaltender on the gold medal-winning Soviet team at the 1988 Winter Olympic Games.

The best season for Dinamo Rīga came in 1987/1988, the first season when the Soviet Elite League instituted an NHL-style playoff system. Dinamo Rīga finished third in the regular season and upset Dynamo Moscow in the semi-finals, before losing to CSKA Moscow, the perennial Soviet champions of the 1980s, in the finals.

After Latvia regained independence in 1991, Latvia restored its membership in the IIHF and the Latvian national team returned to international competitions. As a new team, they were initially placed in the C Pool (third division) of the World Championships and had to qualify for the higher level competitions. They debuted in the B Pool in 1994 and the top-level A Pool in 1997. Latvia has played in the A Pool championship since then. The best results were three 7th-place finishes in 1997, 2004 and 2009, before winning their first medal as hosts of the 2023 tournament, where Latvia finished 3rd. The Latvian team has produced some upsets over the top teams in World Championships, defeating the USA thrice (in 1998, 2001, and 2023), Sweden in 2023, and arch-rival Russia twice (in 2000 and 2003). Latvia competed in the 2002 Winter Olympics, the 2006 Winter Olympics and the 2010 Winter Olympics.

, twenty four Latvian ice hockey players have played in NHL. The first of them was Helmuts Balderis, who came to play in Minnesota North Stars team at the age of 36 in the 1989–90 season. Sandis Ozoliņš, Artūrs Irbe, Sergejs Žoltoks and Kārlis Skrastiņš have arguably been the most successful ones. Ozoliņš is the only Latvian to win the Stanley Cup, in the 1995–96 season with the Colorado Avalanche. Ozoliņš and Irbe have played in NHL All-Star Games. Other Latvian players who have played in NHL include Aleksandrs Kerčs, Grigorijs Panteļejevs, Pēteris Skudra, Viktors Ignatjevs, Herberts Vasiļjevs, Kaspars Astašenko, Raitis Ivanāns, Jānis Sprukts, Harijs Vītoliņš, Mārtiņš Karsums, Oskars Bārtulis, Artūrs Kulda, Kaspars Daugaviņš, Zemgus Girgensons, Kristers Gudļevskis, Ronalds Ķēniņš, Rūdolfs Balcers, Teodors Bļugers and Elvis Merzļikins.

The 2006 Men&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championships was held in Latvia.

==Basketball==

In Latvia, basketball is the second most popular sport. Latvia has a long basketballing tradition. Latvia won the first European championship in 1935 and hosted the second championship in 1937.

In the Soviet period, the Latvian men&#x27;s basketball team, Rīgas ASK was dominant in the Soviet League in the 1950s and early 1960s, winning several Soviet league championships and three European Champion&#x27;s Cups, in 1958, 1959 and 1960. In the 1960 Summer Olympics, four Latvians, Jānis Krūmiņš, Valdis Muižnieks, Cēzars Ozers and Maigonis Valdmanis were a part of the silver medal-winning Soviet team. The Soviet Olympic teams in 1956 and 1964 Summer Olympics had three Latvian players each. The Soviet team in 1952 Summer Olympics had one Latvian.

The women&#x27;s team, TTT Riga was very successful in the 1970s and 1980s, winning the European Champion&#x27;s Cup 18 times, more than any other team in any team sport. 2.12 m (7 ft) tall Uljana Semjonova was the women&#x27;s key player in this period. She was also very dominant with the Soviet team in international games, never losing a game in international competitions and winning 2 Olympic and 3 World Championships.

For men&#x27;s basketball, the guard Valdis Valters was the most highly acclaimed player of the 1980s. He won a European Championship with the Soviet team in 1981 and was recognized as the most valuable player of the tournament, but did not get a chance to play in Olympics, because of the Soviet boycott of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles which coincided with Valter&#x27;s best playing years. Another Latvian, Igors Miglinieks won gold with the Soviet team four years later, in the 1988 Summer Olympics.

Latvia returned to international competition as an independent country in 1992. The qualifiers of the 1992 Summer Olympics were the first tournament for Latvia&#x27;s team. A major controversy was caused by two Latvian players, Igors Miglinieks and Gundars Vētra. They had a choice of either playing for the Unified Team which was certain to qualify for the Olympics or the Latvian national team which had a chance but was not certain to qualify. The two players chose to play for the Unified Team. The Latvian team, playing without them, failed to qualify for Olympics. This caused a great deal of resentment in Latvia and the two players never played for Latvia in an international game.

After the country regained independence, the most successful tournament for Latvia was the 2001 European Championships when the Latvian team finished in 8th place. The centre/power forward Kaspars Kambala was Latvia&#x27;s best player in this tournament. Latvia&#x27;s national championship, &quot;Latvijas Basketbola Līga&quot;, was dominated by &quot;Brocēni&quot; team in 1990s and &quot;Ventspils&quot; team in the 2000s. In 2006, Ventspils team won its seventh consecutive championship.

Gundars Vētra became the first Latvian in the NBA when he briefly played for Minnesota Timberwolves for 13 games in 1993. Andris Biedriņš was drafted in the 2004 NBA draft with the 11th pick by the Golden State Warriors and had already played three seasons, becoming the second Latvian to play in the NBA. He was the youngest player in the 2004-05 NBA season. In the 2015 NBA draft, the New York Knicks selected Kristaps Porziņģis, at the time playing for Spanish club Baloncesto Sevilla, with the fourth selection.

In EuroBasket Women 2007, the national women&#x27;s basketball team reached the semi-finals, the best results of the first national basketball team since gaining independence from The Soviet Union, and faced Russia. Struggling with injuries, most notably key players Gunta Baško and Anete Jēkabsone-Žogota, Latvia eventually lost and reached 4th place, losing to Belarus. Latvia will co-host the Women&#x27;s EuroBasket 2019 alongside Serbia. And, in 2022, the national team qualified for the first time to the FIBA Basketball World Cup.

<text>Boxing at the 2004 Summer Olympics took place in the Peristeri Olympic Boxing Hall. The event was only open to men and bouts were contested over four rounds of two minutes each. Five judges scored the fighters in real time and the boxer with the most points at the end was the winner.

Three days before the Games opening ceremony the International Olympic Committee announced that Kenyan boxer David Munyasia had tested positive for cathine and has been excluded from the event.

Several medalists at the 2004 Olympics, including Amir Khan, Andre Ward, Gennady Golovkin, Yuriorkis Gamboa, and Guillermo Rigondeaux, later went on to become world champions in professional boxing. However, Cuban and Russian boxers do not typically turn pro as their government provides them with extensive funding which allows them to keep their “amateur” status and compete at multiple Olympics. The tournament was also Mario Kindelán&#x27;s final Olympic event before retirement, with a second lightweight gold medal after beating Amir Khan.

==Test event==
The pre-Olympic test event, better known as the 25th Acropolis Cup, was held from 26 to 30 May 2004 in the Peristeri Olympic Boxing Hall in Athens, Greece.

<doc id="807119" wikidata="Q194335" url="?curid=807119" title="15 Big Ones">
<text>15 Big Ones is the 20th studio album by the American rock band the Beach Boys, released July 5, 1976, by Brother/Reprise. It includes a mix of original songs and renditions of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and R&amp;B standards. The LP was the band&#x27;s first album with production credited solely to Brian Wilson since &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; (1966). As such, its release was accompanied by a controversial media campaign that declared his comeback as an active member of the Beach Boys&#x27; recording and touring group.

Following their previous album, &quot;Holland&quot; (1973), the band had focused on touring and attracting bigger concert audiences, especially after the unexpected success of their greatest hits compilation &quot;Endless Summer&quot; (1974). They attempted to record a new album at Caribou Ranch studio in late 1974, but it was soon abandoned, partly due to Wilson being unable or unwilling to participate. At the end of 1975, his bandmates and manager Stephen Love prevailed upon him to produce the group&#x27;s next release, hoping that a new album bearing his production label credit would prove lucrative.

Most of &quot;15 Big Ones&quot; was hastily recorded in early 1976 at the band&#x27;s Brother Studios. The project was marred by creative disputes, time constraints, health issues among the band members, and interference from Brian&#x27;s psychologist, Eugene Landy. One of the proposed titles, &quot;Group Therapy&quot;, was rejected in favor of a title that referred to both the number of tracks and the group&#x27;s 15th anniversary. To support the album, Brian joined his bandmates on a major concert tour for the first time since 1964. The group also commissioned an NBC television special, titled &quot;The Beach Boys&quot;, that aired in August.

Despite mixed reviews, &quot;15 Big Ones&quot; was the Beach Boys&#x27; best-selling album of new material since 1965, earning a gold certification from the RIAA. It peaked at number 8 in the U.S. and number 31 in the UK. Three singles were issued: a cover of Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot; (number 5) and the originals &quot;It&#x27;s OK&quot; (number 29) and &quot;Everyone&#x27;s in Love with You&quot;. The former two were their only top 30 hits in this decade. Brian later referred to &quot;15 Big Ones&quot; and its 1977 follow-up, &quot;The Beach Boys Love You&quot;, as his favorite and most artistically representative work.

==Background==
In January 1973, the Beach Boys&#x27; previous album, &quot;Holland&quot;, was released amid generally favorable reviews and top 40 entries in the U.S. and UK charts. Early copies of the LP were packaged with a bonus EP, &quot;Mount Vernon and Fairway&quot;, that was produced by Brian and Carl Wilson. Brian&#x27;s original concept for &quot;Mount Vernon and Fairway&quot; was to be &quot;much more ambitious&quot;, consisting of renditions of 1950s songs like &quot;A Casual Look&quot;. His bandmates took issue with the space it would have taken on the LP, and he subsequently lost interest, leaving Carl to finish the project.

The group maintained a touring regimen, but recorded very little in the studio for the next two years. Several months earlier, they had announced that they would complete their unfinished album &quot;Smile&quot;, but this never came to fruition, and plans for its release were once again abandoned. Following the June 1973 death of the Wilsons&#x27; father and former band manager Murry, Brian retreated into his bedroom and withdrew further into drug abuse, alcoholism, chain smoking, and overeating. He reflected, &quot;I used my room as my little castle. Added to that, I was very depressed with the Beach Boys. I couldn&#x27;t talk to them and nobody in the band could relate to me. This went on for about two and a half years. But, on and off, I&#x27;d sometimes go and record.&quot;

In October 1973, the band fired their manager, Jack Rieley. By his account, he had &quot;pulled away&quot; from the band due to &quot;terribly complex, complicated and horribly distasteful situations involving aspects of their business and financial management.&quot; Rieley&#x27;s position was succeeded by Mike Love&#x27;s brother Steve and Chicago manager James William Guercio. Blondie Chaplin and Ricky Fataar, who had joined the Beach Boys as official members in 1972, left the band in December 1973 and November 1974, respectively.

The Beach Boys&#x27; greatest hits compilation &quot;Endless Summer&quot; was released in June 1974 to unexpected success, becoming the band&#x27;s second number-one U.S. album in October. The LP had a 155-week chart run, selling over 3 million copies, and led the group to reclaim themselves as the number-one act in the U.S. amid a new generation of fans. Guercio prevailed upon the group to swap out newer songs with older material in their concert setlists, partly to accommodate their growing audience and the demand for their early hits. Later in the year, members of the band appeared as guests on Chicago&#x27;s hit &quot;Wishing You Were Here&quot;. At the end of 1974, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; proclaimed the Beach Boys &quot;Band of the Year&quot; based on the strength of their live performances.

==Early recording history (1974–1975) ==


To capitalize on their sudden resurgence in popularity, the Beach Boys accepted Guercio&#x27;s invitation to record their next Reprise album at his Caribou Ranch studio, located around the mountains of Nederland, Colorado. These October 1974 sessions marked the group&#x27;s return to the studio after a 21-month period of virtual inactivity, but the proceedings were cut short after Brian had insisted on returning to his home in Los Angeles. Guercio remembered, &quot;From the day he got here, he said, &#x27;I want to go home.&#x27;&quot; Further complicating matters, a fire broke out in the studio and destroyed some of the tapes, after which the band resumed recording in November at their newly-constructed Brother Studios in Santa Monica.

Only four songs have been documented as being recorded at Caribou: &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;, &quot;Good Timin″&quot;, &quot;Ding Dang&quot;, and &quot;Child of Winter (Christmas Song)&quot;. Wilson had resumed his songwriting collaboration with poet Stephen Kalinich (who did not accompany the band to Colorado), resulting in such songs as &quot;Child of Winter&quot;, &quot;California Feelin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Riding High on the Music&quot; (written for John Kay) and &quot;Lucy Jones&quot; (intended for an unrealized Wilson-produced Kalinich rock album). &quot;You&#x27;re Riding High on the Music&quot; was never recorded. &quot;Lucy Jones&quot;, as described by Kalinich, &quot;was just a funky song, and Brian and I were having fun.&quot; Long believed to have been written by Wilson and Kalinch in 1974, &quot;Grateful Are We for Little Children&quot; dates from their earlier collaboration in the late 1960s.

In November 1974, Mike Love told &quot;Melody Maker&quot; that the band had completed &quot;about 40 tracks&quot; and that their next album would be completed by January 1975. Love reported, &quot;Brian is very involved with the LP. [...] The album&#x27;s a combination between &quot;Sunflower&quot; and &quot;Holland&quot;. It&#x27;s got some of the feel that &quot;Holland&quot; had, but also sounds a bit like &quot;Sunflower&quot; in certain respects.&quot; The material was written by himself (&quot;about ten&quot; of the songs), Brian (five), Carl and Dennis (&quot;about five&quot; each), and Jardine (&quot;a couple&quot;). The group had actually completed only a few tracks, abandoning the rest. Additional songs recorded in 1974 had included &quot;River Song&quot;, &quot;Our Life, Our Love, Our Land&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Go&quot;, &quot;Barnyard Blues&quot;, an early version of &quot;It&#x27;s OK&quot;, and a rendition of &quot;Honeycomb&quot;. &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Go&quot; is a song composed by Carl with lyrics by Love, while &quot;Our Life, Our Love, Our Land&quot; is a song written by Love that he described as an &quot;ethnic&quot; thing that had resembled &quot;The Trader&quot; from &quot;Holland&quot;. &quot;Honeycomb&quot; featured Brian&#x27;s wife Marilyn on lead vocal.

Released as a single at the end of December 1974, &quot;Child of Winter&quot; was the first Beach Boys record since 1965 to have displayed the label credit &quot;Produced by Brian Wilson&quot;. The band toured for most of 1975, playing college football stadiums and basketball arenas. Meanwhile, Brian produced California Music&#x27;s covers of &quot;Jamaica Farewell&quot; and &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love?&quot;. Over the summer, the touring group played a co-headlining series of concert dates with Chicago, a pairing that was nicknamed &quot;Beachago&quot;. The tour was massively successful and restored the Beach Boys&#x27; profitability to what it had been in the mid-1960s.

In a July 1975 article for &quot;NME&quot;, Nick Kent reported that Carl Wilson had cited &quot;Rollin&#x27; Up to Heaven&quot; (retitled from &quot;Ding Dang&quot;), &quot;California Feelin″&quot;, and &quot;Good Timing&quot; as &quot;titles to new Brian Wilson songs recorded for the next Warner/Reprise album&quot;. Carl told Kent that the new songs demonstrated Brian&#x27;s new &quot;funky&quot; approach. In September, the band recorded an unreleased version of the Del-Vikings&#x27; &quot;Come Go with Me&quot;. In October, Wilson recorded a rendition of Van Dyke Parks&#x27; &quot;Come to the Sunshine&quot;, also intended for the band&#x27;s forthcoming album, but a dispute prevented the track&#x27;s inclusion.

Although another joint tour with Chicago had been planned for the summer of 1976, the Beach Boys&#x27; association with Guercio and his Caribou Management company ended early in the year. Stephen Love subsequently took over as the band&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; business manager.

==Main production (January–May 1976)==
===Overview===

By the time &quot;15 Big Ones&quot; was recorded, the Beach Boys had fallen three albums behind schedule in their contract with Warner Bros. In late 1975, Wilson volunteered himself into psychologist Eugene Landy&#x27;s 24-hour therapy program. Encouraged by the positive results of Landy&#x27;s treatment, Stephen Love and Wilson&#x27;s bandmates requested that Wilson produce the album that became &quot;15 Big Ones&quot;. He had not been credited as the sole producer on a Beach Boys LP since &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; (1966). 

The principal &quot;15 Big Ones&quot; sessions lasted from January 30 to May 15, 1976 at Brother Studios. Studio staff engineers Stephen Moffitt and Earle Mankey, the latter a former member of Sparks, were enlisted for the project. Carl and Dennis assisted Brian with the instrumental tracks, while Al Jardine and Mike Love contributed just vocals. Group meetings were supervised by Landy. Band road manager Rick Nelson acknowledged that Landy had attempted to exert unwelcome artistic control over the group. Landy remarked in a 1988 interview, &quot;Brian and I did that [album] together.&quot;

In the assessment of biographer Peter Ames Carlin, one of the &quot;more distressing&quot; characteristics of the recordings is the quality of Wilson&#x27;s singing. Carlin writes that Wilson&#x27;s &quot;powerful but tender falsetto&quot; had degenerated into &quot;a baritone croak.&quot; In his 2016 memoir, &quot;I Am Brian Wilson&quot;, it is stated that he suffered from a bout of laryngitis during the sessions, adding that his hoarse voice on the album was not his &quot;normal voice [...] It was an assumed voice.&quot;

&quot;15 Big Ones&quot; is distinguished for its use of Moog and ARP synthesizers, played by Wilson himself, signaling a more electronic-heavy sound compared to his past productions. Mankey surmised that Wilson had employed synthesizers &quot;to fake string parts [...] and not have to worry about anything else. He was in there to play the part and get out.&quot;

===Original concept===
As a warm-up exercise, Brian first recorded a batch of oldies with many of the session musicians that he had worked with during the mid-1960s. Initially, Wilson was to have produced one or two albums of all-original material after finishing these oldies exercises. &quot;Crawdaddy&quot; journalist Timothy White, an observer of much of the album&#x27;s recording, explained that the premise &quot;represented a compromise at a stage when the Boys had felt stymied as a unit and reluctant to commit their own recent or stockpiled individual compositions to a communal album that didn&#x27;t mainly feature Brian&#x27;s work.&quot; 

Wilson recalled, &quot;It was a little scary because [the other Beach Boys and I] had drifted apart, personality-wise. A lot of the guys had developed new personalities through meditation. It was a bit scary and shaky. But we went into the studio with the attitude that we had to get it done.&quot; Stephen observed that the band &quot;had mixed feelings about [Brian&#x27;s comeback] because they knew it would frustrate their own designs for their own music. But they probably liked it economically, because they knew it was going to get them a bigger record deal.&quot; According to biographer Keith Badman, discussions over each potential album track had lasted up to eight hours.

According to Dennis, the group &quot;couldn&#x27;t agree on enough&quot; with regards to the songs that they had stockpiled. Shortly before the sessions had commenced, Dennis explained that the fate of the band&#x27;s wealth of unreleased material depended on the individual songwriters, noting that the pressure to release songs had detracted from the creative enjoyment. He reported that the group had planned to issue one album of oldies and a potential double album consisting of &quot;all-new material that stretches from hard rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll to these wordless vocals we&#x27;ve been doing that sound like the Vienna Boys Choir.&quot;

===Session difficulties===

Following two days in the studio, during which the band recorded &quot;Palisades Park&quot; and &quot;Blueberry Hill&quot;, the sessions temporarily halted due to disagreements regarding the album&#x27;s direction. According to Brian, &quot;I started to change my mind [about producing the album], and they said, &#x27;Come on, come on, Brian. You can&#x27;t stop.&#x27;&quot; Mankey said, &quot;It was really tense in the studio. Brian would come in around nine or ten in the morning. One day, they would get something done, and the next day they would do nothing except fight.&quot; He remembered that Wilson had also run into difficulty engaging with musicians he was unfamiliar with, calling it &quot;the fastest sessions ever. [...] At the end of the song Brian would say, &#x27;That sounded great, guys!&#x27; and head for the door.&quot;

The other band members struggled to accommodate Brian&#x27;s now-haphazard approach to music production. Carl said, &quot;I believe that Brian was consciously under-producing the album and that was his choice – we deferred to him. But when we voted to do it that way with those particular songs, I left the studio right there on the spot because I was very disenchanted.&quot; Without Brian&#x27;s knowledge, members of the band later refined the mixes in opposition to his preferred &quot;dry&quot; production aesthetic. Jardine reported that he and his bandmates had felt that Brian, at this time, had lacked the competence to singlehandedly produce the album. 

A &quot;Newsweek&quot; journalist reported that Jardine and Mike Love were &quot;all for letting Brian take full charge, even though Love makes no secret of resenting him.&quot; Mankey remembered that everybody in the studio had felt sorry for Brian and offered their assistance in bettering his work, with the exception of Love and Jardine, who &quot;just thought it was crap. They&#x27;d show up and say it was terrible.&quot;

Dennis later complained that he had been &quot;unhappy with the oldies – absolutely&quot;, advocating for all-original content given ample Brian Wilson compositions had been available. He said, &quot;Steve Love, Mike Love and Alan Jardine were pushing to get it out – it was just a big push. [...] Carl and I were really upset.&quot; Stephen countered by emphasizing the necessity of timely releases to meet business demands and market momentum, even if it meant artistic compromises. Mike did not believe that time constraints was to blame for the album&#x27;s &quot;rough sections&quot;, explaining that it was not publicly disclosed that Carl had suffered &quot;a debilitating back injury&quot; and had been &quot;self-medicating and drinking&quot;.

Sessions resumed in early March. Ultimately, a compromise was reached, with the album including a mix of covers and originals. Brian told an interviewer, &quot;&quot;15 Big Ones&quot; started out as an album of nothing but oldies, but then we ran out of them. Halfway through, Mike Love decided to make the record half old and half new. I didn&#x27;t like the idea at first, but he literally forced us to do it his way. I resented that.&quot; The group had recorded about two dozen different songs, mostly cover versions, by the time the sessions had wrapped.

==Songs==

===Originals===
&quot;It&#x27;s OK&quot;, written by Brian and Mike, is an upbeat song about celebrating summer fun. &quot;Had to Phone Ya&quot; was written by Wilson while his wife Marilyn was away in Europe. &quot;Everyone&#x27;s in Love with You&quot;, written about the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, was Mike Love&#x27;s second ever solo contribution to a Beach Boys album. &quot;That Same Song&quot; was described by Carlin as &quot;a whimsical history of world music that came close to sparking the gospel fire it set out to ignite&quot;. &quot;T M Song&quot; begins with a mock argument between the band members, possibly based on the real life arguments that had been occurring among themselves.

Two of the songs predated the album by several years. The first, &quot;Susie Cincinnati&quot;, is Al Jardine&#x27;s only writing contribution to the album. It was recorded in 1969 during the sessions for the album &quot;Sunflower&quot; (1970). Brian included it on &quot;15 Big Ones&quot; &quot;because it&#x27;s a good song&quot;, although Dennis felt that it was a &quot;silly piece of shit&quot;. &quot;Back Home&quot; was originally written in 1963 by Brian and his roommate Bob Norberg. It is semi-autobiographical; Brian sings in the chorus of wanting to return to Ohio, which happened to be the homestate of his great-grandparents. Carlin notes the &quot;15 Big Ones&quot; version for featuring &quot;a throbbing bass, bouncing organ riffs, and a spirited vocal from Brian.&quot;

===Cover versions===

According to Wilson, &quot;We thought about songs that were standards and, since they were acceptable once, we figured they would be acceptable again. [...] We figured it was a safe way to go.&quot; The eight selections included on the album were &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot; (originally by Chuck Berry), &quot;Chapel of Love&quot; (originally by Darlene Love), &quot;Talk to Me&quot; (originally by Little Willie John), &quot;Palisades Park&quot; (originally by Freddy Cannon), &quot;A Casual Look&quot; (originally by the Six Teens), &quot;Blueberry Hill&quot; (originally by Fats Domino), &quot;In the Still of the Night&quot; (originally by the Five Satins), and &quot;Just Once in My Life&quot; (originally by the Righteous Brothers).

&quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot; was chosen, according to Love, because he felt that the band could possibly repeat the success they had with covering Berry&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Little Sixteen&quot; as &quot;Surfin&#x27; U.S.A.&quot; (1963). Dennis was originally slated to sing the lead on &quot;Blueberry Hill&quot;, but Wilson gave the part to Love so that Love would not feel left out. &quot;Palisades Park&quot; had been the source of inspiration for the Beach Boys&#x27; songs &quot;County Fair&quot; (1962) and &quot;Amusement Parks U.S.A.&quot; (1965). Carl recorded his vocal in one take. Brian praised Carl&#x27;s performance and ranked it as &quot;one of my top five Beach Boys vocals. He nailed it.&quot;

In the assessment of musicologist Philip Lambert, most of the covers remained faithful to the originals, however, &quot;Blueberry Hill&quot;, &quot;Talk to Me&quot;, and &quot;Palisades Park&quot; were the exceptions in which the listener gets &quot;more of a sense of the younger Brian Wilson, not just reproducing originals but dignifying them with his own personal flavorings&quot;.

===Outtakes===
Although they were not included on the album, the band also recorded versions of &quot;Sea Cruise&quot;, &quot;On Broadway&quot;, &quot;Mony, Mony&quot;, &quot;Running Bear&quot;, &quot;Shake, Rattle and Roll&quot;, &quot;Secret Love&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Fight the Sea&quot;, &quot;Peggy Sue&quot;, &quot;Michael Rowed the Boat Ashore&quot;, and &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;. Other discarded tracks included the originals &quot;Short Skirts&quot; (Brian), &quot;Gold Rush&quot; (Jardine), &quot;Lisa&quot;, &quot;Glow, Crescent, Glow&quot; (Mike), &quot;10,000 Years Ago&quot;, and &quot;Rainbows&quot; (Dennis).

==Packaging and artwork==

&quot;Group Therapy&quot; was a title for the album that had been proposed by either Dennis or Brian. Brian&#x27;s 2016 memoir states, &quot;That was the name of a band Ray Kennedy was in back in the &#x27;60s, and that might have been in the back of my mind, but mainly I thought of it because it summed up everything that was happening at the time.&quot; The title was rejected in favor of Dean Torrence&#x27;s suggestion, &quot;15 Big Ones&quot;, which referred to both the number of tracks and the group&#x27;s 15th anniversary.
&quot;15 Big Ones&quot; was packaged with cover artwork that showed photos of the individual band members inside five interlocking rings, resembling the logo for the Olympic Games. This was an intentional reference to the fact that 1976 had been an Olympic year. A logo that displayed the band&#x27;s name, designed by Torrence, was introduced with this release, becoming the Beach Boys&#x27; official logo until the 2010s.

Mike Love reflected, &quot;The images of Brian, Dennis, Carl, Al, and me in five interlocking circles could have been a metaphor for five bandmates united in common purpose, or five guys living in their separate worlds. With us, it was both.&quot;

==Release==
===Publicity campaign===
To highlight Brian&#x27;s recovery and his return to writing and producing, Stephen Love devised a promotional campaign with the tagline &quot;Brian Is Back!&quot;, and paid the Rogers &amp; Cowan publicity agency $3,500 per month to implement it (equivalent to $ in ). In Gaines&#x27; description, the resultant &quot;media coverage was enormous&quot;, appearing across &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;New West&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Crawdaddy&quot;, the &quot;New York Times&quot;, and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. It marked the highest level of press attention that Wilson had received since Derek Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Brian Wilson is a genius&quot; campaign from 1966.

In June 1976, Brian gave his first press interviews in several years, and in July, the band produced a six-hour documentary retrospective for U.S. radio. At the centerpiece of the &quot;Brian Is Back!&quot; campaign was the release of &quot;15 Big Ones&quot; on July 5. On August 5, NBC premiered a Lorne Michaels-produced television special about the band, called simply &quot;The Beach Boys&quot;. It included live performances of &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s OK&quot; (both drawn from their July 5 concert at Anaheim Stadium), and &quot;That Same Song&quot; (filmed with the 75-piece Double Rock Baptist Choir). On August 23, the band were given a five-page cover story on that week&#x27;s issue of &quot;People&quot; magazine.

On September 17, Brian appeared as a guest presenter on Don Kirshner&#x27;s &quot;Annual Rock Music Awards&quot; program, where he was nominated for the Hall of Fame category and lost to the Beatles. Carl and Dennis accompanied him to the podium. On November 16, BBC-2 premiered an episode of &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; that included host Bob Harris&#x27; interview with Brian, which had been filmed on September 21. Wilson made his first talk show appearance on November 23, on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;, followed by an appearance on &quot;NBC&#x27;s Saturday Night&quot;, on November 26. Both appearances included a performance of &quot;Back Home&quot;. That month, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; published David Felton&#x27;s feature story, &quot;The Beach Boys: The Healing of Brother &quot; .

Despite its success, the &quot;Brian Is Back&quot; promotion proved controversial. Felton&#x27;s cover story had presented unfavorable depictions of the band and their entourage of family and friends. Landy involved himself by openly discussing Wilson&#x27;s condition and other aspects of his personal life to reporters. Wilson often solicited drugs from his interviewers, possibly in jest, and remarked on one occasion that he had &quot;felt like a prisoner&quot;,

Writing in 1980, &quot;Sounds&quot; journalist Sandy Robertson reflected on earlier optimistic coverage of Wilson, noting that the small, troubling details—such as Wilson&#x27;s denial of access to his funds, demeaning treatment by Landy, and a controlling teenage bodyguard—marked a sharp contrast from Wilson&#x27;s past as a creator of hits such as &quot;California Girls&quot; and &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Alexis Petridis concurred that the coverage had been &quot;heartbreaking and horrifying in equal measure, depicting a halting, visibly terrified man&quot;.

===Concert tours===
Starting on July 2, 1976, Wilson made regular concert appearances with his bandmates for the first time since December 1964, singing and alternating between bass guitar and piano. Some reports erroneously state that it was the first time Wilson had appeared onstage with the band since 1964; in fact, Wilson had last done so in 1973.

From July 3 to August 15, 1976, the group embarked on a string of major stadium concert dates across the U.S. Supporting musicians included Billy Hinsche (guitar), Ed Carter (guitar, bass), Ron Altbach (keyboards), and Carlos Muñoz (keyboards). The setlists for these dates included the &quot;15 Big Ones&quot; selections &quot;Susie Cincinnati&quot;, &quot;Palisades Park&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s OK&quot;, &quot;A Casual Look&quot;, &quot;Back Home&quot;, and &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot;.

In his review of the Beach Boys&#x27; concert at Anaheim, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; reporter Harvey Kubernick wrote that Wilson &quot;seemed uncomfortable on stage&quot; and &quot;shouldn&#x27;t be subjected to being propped up on stage for video purposes or group/media examination. His contributions this afternoon were nil! Following the tour, the Beach Boys played a further dozen concert dates at stadiums and basketball arenas, this time without Brian&#x27;s participation.

===Commercial performance and singles===
&quot;15 Big Ones&quot; peaked at number 8 in the U.S., becoming their first top 10 album of new material since &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, and their highest-charting studio album since &quot;Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)&quot; (1965). It also became their second Warner Bros. release to be certified gold.

On May 24, 1976, lead single &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot; (backed with &quot;T M Song&quot;) was released as the band&#x27;s first new single in 16 months, peaking in the U.S. at number 5, their highest chart position for a single since &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; (1966). The second single, &quot;It&#x27;s OK&quot; (backed with &quot;Had to Phone Ya&quot;), was issued in the U.S. on August 30 and peaked at number 29. On November 8, the third and last single, &quot;Susie Cincinnati&quot; (backed with &quot;Everyone&#x27;s in Love with You&quot;) was issued in the U.S. and failed to chart.

==Critical reception==
&quot;15 Big Ones&quot; received mixed reviews and was largely disliked by the group&#x27;s fanbase. Much of the criticism centers around the cover songs, Dennis&#x27; and Brian&#x27;s rough vocal performances, and the record&#x27;s perceived unfinished, forced, and rushed quality.

White wrote in his &quot;Crawdaddy&quot; review that the album was a disappointment; although it &quot;does boast several bright moments – but no brilliant ones.&quot; Less favorably, a reviewer for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; described the album as &quot;the kind of music one might expect to find at a rock star&#x27;s funeral.&quot; According to Carlin, most other reviewers &quot;gave &quot;15 Big Ones&quot; gentle treatment&quot;, such as in &quot;Newsweek&quot;, which described the album as &quot;fascinating [...] a curiously unshakable unity.&quot; Similarly, Jim Miller of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; decreed that it was &quot;the most idiosyncratic — and flaky — record I have heard in some time, and it fascinates me.&quot;

Among retrospective reviews, AllMusic&#x27;s John Bush felt that most of the covers were &quot;simply too well known to be reworked effectively, by anyone&quot;, but favorably compared &quot;It&#x27;s OK&quot; and &quot;Had to Phone Ya&quot; to &quot;Brian&#x27;s odd pop songs on late-&#x27;60s albums like &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;20/20&quot;.&quot; Robert Christgau bemoaned the selection of covers and their lack of a &quot;playful, goofy vocal intensity&quot;. &quot;Blender&quot;″s Douglas Wolk wrote that the album is &quot;[o]verwhelmed by clunky covers and bored performances&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Eric Kempfe described the album as &quot;muddy and confused&quot; and highlighted &quot;Had to Phone Ya&quot; and &quot;Back Home&quot; as the best originals. Kempfe added that, with the exception of &quot;Just Once in My Life&quot;, the covers &quot;are notable only for the morbid fascination they hold [...] Brian&#x27;s once-sweet falsetto is reduced to a hoarse crackle; as a result, Mike Love&#x27;s painful nasal whine is the dominant voice on the record.&quot;

In his book &quot;Icons of Rock&quot;, Scott Schinder called &quot;15 Big Ones&quot; &quot;largely a letdown, largely of lackluster remakes of rock and roll oldies, along with a handful of lightweight but charming new songs by Brian. Rock critic Nick Kent called it &quot;utterly uninspired and weary-sounding [...] clearly intended only as therapy for Wilson&#x27;s long dormant production talents.&quot; Musician Dennis Diken of the Smithereens, who wrote the liner notes to the album&#x27;s 2000 reissue, acknowledged such criticisms and opined, &quot;If you can accept all these points and put it behind you that this isn&#x27;t &quot;Smile&quot;, &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; or even &quot;Wild Honey&quot;, give &quot;15 Big Ones&quot; a spin and dig on what is a very cool and fun Beach Boys album.&quot;

==Aftermath and legacy==

At the time, Brian described the album as &quot;nothing too deep&quot; and promised that his next effort would be as ambitious as &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;. He mentioned that he felt &quot;15 Big Ones&quot; was &quot;a good album&quot; and &quot;if you listen to it, you can see where all the work went&quot;, adding that if it had been disliked by &quot;the kids&quot;, then it &quot;would have wrecked me and I&#x27;d probably have hidden out again.&quot; In a 1998 interview, he referred to &quot;15 Big Ones&quot; and the band&#x27;s next release, &quot;The Beach Boys Love You&quot; (1977), as his favorite Beach Boys albums. &quot;That&#x27;s when it all happened for me. That&#x27;s where my heart lies.&quot;

Other members of the band, including Carl and Dennis, disparaged the album in the press when it was released. Dennis felt that it was &quot;a great mistake to put Brian in full control&quot; and that the &quot;whole process was a little bruising.&quot; He admitted, &quot;We were heartbroken. People have waited all this time, anticipating a new Beach Boys album, and I hated to give them this.&quot; Mike Love declined to comment on the album when asked by a reporter. In White&#x27;s belief, the troubled sessions &quot;precipitated the abrupt solo career decisions by Dennis and Carl Wilson&quot;, and what he had witnessed convinced him that &quot;the greatest obstacle the Beach Boys face is that of five divergent personalities, fraught with jealousies, fears, foibles, conflicting interests and basic stylistic disagreements.&quot;

Matijas-Mecca argued that &quot;15 Big Ones&quot; marked the beginning of a one-and-a-half-year period in which &quot;Brian produced some of his most creative and interesting (if not necessarily commercial) music since he abandoned &quot;SMiLE&quot;.&quot; Journalist Brian Chidester similarly described the era as the end of &quot;Wilson&#x27;s full retreat as leader of the Beach Boys&quot;, although Wilson &quot;never returned to the form that saw him produce groundbreaking works like &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and &quot;Smile&quot;.&quot; Diken wrote, &quot;One might also view the album as Brian&#x27;s salvation from a goal-less downward spiral and an imminent crash landing.&quot;

<doc id="807127" wikidata="Q7278640" url="?curid=807127" title="Rabbit punch">
<text>A rabbit punch is a blow delivered to the back of the head or to the base of the skull, notorious for its potential to cause severe and irreversible injuries, including spinal cord injury or even instant death.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;rabbit punch&quot; dates back to the early 20th century, which derives from a hunting technique where a quick, sharp strike to the back of a rabbit&#x27;s head was used to ensure a swift kill without damaging the fur, considered a humane method for killing injured or trapped rabbits.

==Legality and risks==
Rabbit punches are illegal across all major combat sports, including boxing, MMA, and other combat sports that involve striking due to the significant risk they pose to the spinal cord and brain stem. Such strikes can lead to catastrophic injuries, including paralysis, severe brain damage, or death, due to the vulnerability of the back of the head and neck area. The only exceptions are no-holds-barred events such as the International Vale Tudo Championship (prior to rule changes in mid-2012).

==Notable incidents==
Several high-profile incidents have underscored the dangers of rabbit punches:
* On 17 October 2015, Prichard Colón, a well known boxer, was rabbit punched on the back of the head multiple times by his opponent, Terrel Williams, during a boxing match in the United States. During the match, Colón experienced dizziness as a result of the illegal punches. After the match ended, Colón began to tremble from his legs and started to vomit. He was rushed to the hospital where he was diagnosed with brain bleeding and underwent surgery. He was in a coma for 221 days (7 months, 1 week) until he was transferred to his mother&#x27;s house. As a result of the injuries he sustained, Colón fell into a persistent vegetative state where he no longer could move or talk. As of July 2021, 6 years after the fight, Colón is making more progress and is getting treatment for his condition, but is still expected to remain in a vegetative state.
* Francisco Leal died from severe brain and brain stem damage in 2013 after a match with Raul Hirales, where a rabbit punch was involved.

* On 29 June 2014, soccer referee John Bieniewicz was punched in the neck by Baseel Abdul Amir Saad, an upset player in an amateur match he was officiating in Livonia, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. Bieniewicz died two days later of his injuries, and Saad was charged with second-degree murder. Bieniewicz&#x27;s autopsy showed that the force of the impact on the left side of his neck just below the base of his skull had resulted in a rare injury with twisted and torn arteries around the base of his skull, knocking him out before he hit the ground. In 2015, Saad pleaded guilty to manslaughter and received a sentence of 8 to 15 years in prison.

* Lin Yu-Ting Incident (2024 Summer Olympics). On 8 August 2024, during the women&#x27;s featherweight semifinal at the Paris Olympics, Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-ting was involved in a controversy for allegedly using a rabbit punch against Turkish opponent Esra Yildiz Kahraman. Lin reportedly struck Kahraman in the back of the head repeatedly while Kahraman was turned and on the ropes, an action viewed by some as a clear rabbit punch.

==Penalties and enforcement==
In boxing,the referee may warn against using the blow, deduct points for continuous violations, or disqualify the fighter completely and stop the fight.

<text>The Zamorin&#x27;s Guruvayurappan College is an aided college in Kozhikode, Kerala, India offering graduation and post-graduation courses. It is affiliated to the University of Calicut.

== History ==
The original institution was founded by the Zamorin of Eranad, HH Shri. Manavikraman Maharaja Bahadur, as an English school in June 1877, to impart English education to the young members of the Zamorin&#x27;s family. In 1878, it came to be known as &quot;Kerala Vidyasala&quot; and was thrown open to Hindu boys of all castes.

In 1879, the institution was affiliated to the University of Madras as a second grade college. In 1900, the institution was renamed &quot;The Zamorin&#x27;s College&quot;. In 1904, the Zamorin constituted a Board of Management for the administration of the college. The present site of the college at Pokkunnu was purchased with the help of a grant from the Guruvayur Devaswom.

In recognition of this gift, the institution was renamed &quot;The Guruvayurappan College&quot;. In 1955, the college moved to its present site, at Pokkunnu. In 1958, the college was affiliated to the University of Travancore, which later came to be known as the University of Kerala. Later in 1968, when the University of Calicut was formed, the college was affiliated to it.

The college acquired its present name &quot;The Zamorin&#x27;s Guruvayurappan College&quot; in 1981.

<doc id="807150" wikidata="Q343769" url="?curid=807150" title="Increase Sumner">
<text>Increase Sumner (November 27, 1746 – June 7, 1799) was an American lawyer, jurist, and politician from Massachusetts. He was the fifth governor of Massachusetts, serving from 1797 to 1799. Trained as a lawyer, he served in the provisional government of Massachusetts during the American Revolutionary War, and was elected to the Confederation Congress in 1782. Appointed to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court the same year, he served there as an associate justice until 1797.

He was elected governor of Massachusetts three times by wide margins, but died shortly after the start of his third term. His descendants include his son William H. Sumner, for whom the Sumner Tunnel in Boston, Massachusetts, is named, and 20th-century diplomats Sumner Welles and Sumner Gerard.

==Early life==
Increase Sumner was born on November 27, 1746, in Roxbury, Province of Massachusetts Bay, one of eight children of Increase Sumner and Sarah Sharp. The elder Increase Sumner was a successful farmer descended from early settlers of Dorchester; he held a number of public offices including coroner for Suffolk County, and selectman of Roxbury.

In 1752 Sumner enrolled in the grammar school in Roxbury, now Roxbury Latin School, where the headmaster was William Cushing, future justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Sumner excelled at school, and over the resistance of his father (who envisioned his son&#x27;s future to be in agriculture) was enrolled at Harvard College in 1763. He graduated in 1767.

==Legal career==
After graduating from Harvard, Sumner took charge of the Roxbury school, where he taught for two years while he apprenticed law under Samuel Quincy, the provincial solicitor general. He sought to study under John Adams, but the latter had enough students. Adams wrote that Sumner &quot;was a promising genius, and a studious and virtuous youth.&quot; Sumner was admitted to the bar in 1770 and opened a law office in Roxbury that year.
Sumner was chosen a member of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress in 1776 where he represented the town of Roxbury. In 1777 he participated in a state convention to draft a new constitution, whose result was not adopted. He continued to serve in the provincial congress until the state constitution was adopted in 1780, when he was elected state senator for Suffolk County. This post he held for two years. In June 1782 he was elected to the Confederation Congress by the state legislature, replacing Timothy Danielson, who resigned, but Sumner never actually took the seat. In August 1782 Governor John Hancock nominated him as an associate justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court to replace James Sullivan. He accepted this position instead of the senate seat, and served from 1782 to 1797. Details on his judicial record are sparse, in part because few official court records survive from the time, and decisions were usually oral (the court did not begin formal record keeping with written decisions until 1805). Sumner did take detailed notes of many of the cases he heard; these notes, preserved at the Massachusetts Historical Society, now form a valuable repository of early Massachusetts judicial history.

The period when he served in the Supreme Judicial Court included a time of great turmoil in Massachusetts. Following the American Revolutionary War the value of the paper currency then in circulation fell significantly leaving many citizens in financial difficulties. The administration of James Bowdoin in 1786 raised taxes to pay the public debt which had run up during the war, and stepped up collection of back taxes. These economic pressures led to outbreaks of civil unrest which culminated in Shays&#x27; Rebellion, an uprising in central and western Massachusetts lasting from 1786 to 1787. Sumner sat on the criminal cases in which participants of the rebellion were tried. Many participants were pardoned, but eighteen were convicted and sentenced to death. Most of these sentences were commuted; two men were hanged.

Sumner sat on the court when it heard the appeals in the Quock Walker cases in 1783, concerning a former slave who was seeking confirmation of his freedom. A ruling in one of these cases confirmed that the state constitution had effectively abolished slavery. In 1785 he was chosen by the legislature to sit on a committee which revised the laws of the state, to modernize them and remove references to British authority. In 1789 he was a member of the state convention that met to ratify the United States Constitution, in which he explained to the convention the meaning and importance of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1791.

==Governor of Massachusetts==
In 1795 some factions of the Federalist Party sought to promote Sumner as a candidate for governor, but he was not formally nominated, and Governor Samuel Adams was reelected. The following year Sumner was actively promoted by the Federalists, but Adams was able to prevail by a comfortable margin. The campaign was not very divisive: Sumner was presented as comparatively youthful alternative to the aging Adams. Sumner wrote afterwards that Adams &quot;has waded through a sea of political troubles and grown old in labors for the good of his country.&quot;

Adams&#x27; popularity, however, was declining, and he decided not to run for reelection in 1797. A number of popular figures were raised as nominees, and in that year&#x27;s election, Sumner won the vote with 15,000 out of a total of 25,000 votes cast against a divided opposition. On June 2 Sumner rode from his home in Roxbury accompanied by 300 citizens on horseback to the State House in Boston, where the Secretary of the Commonwealth proclaimed his governorship from the eastern balcony. Sumner was the last governor to preside in what is now called the Old State House as the seat of government was moved to the New State House the following year.

Sumner was reelected in 1798 and 1799 against minimal opposition. His popularity as governor was seen by his garnering a larger share of the vote for his third term, where he won 17,000 out of 21,000 votes cast, receiving unanimous votes in 180 towns out of 393 in the state. During Sumner&#x27;s period in office the state was principally preoccupied with the threat of attack by France as a result of the ongoing naval Quasi-War. Comparatively younger and more vigorous than his predecessors, Sumner actively built up the state militia and worked to ensure its preparedness in case of attack.
Sumner never assumed the duties of office after winning the 1799 election as he was sick on his death bed at the time. In order to avoid constitutional issues surrounding the succession to the governor&#x27;s office, he managed to take the oath of office in early June. He died in office from angina pectoris, aged 52 on June 7, 1799. His funeral, with full military honors, took place on June 12, and was attended by United States President John Adams. The funeral procession which included four regiments of militia ran from the governor&#x27;s Roxbury mansion to a service at the Old South Meeting House. He is interred at the northerly corner of Boston&#x27;s Granary Burying Ground. The brass epitaph indicates:

Here repose the remains of Increase Sumner. He was born at Roxbury, November 27, 1746, and died at the same place, June 7, 1799 in the 53rd year of his age. He was for sometime a practitioner at the bar; and for fifteen years an associate judge of the supreme judicial court; was thrice elected governor of Massachusetts in which office he died. As a lawyer he was faithful and able. As a judge, patient, impartial and decisive. As a chief magistrate, accessible, frank and decisive. In private life, he was affectionate and mild. In public life was dignified and firm. Party feuds were allayed by the correctness of his conduct. Calumny was silenced by the weight of his virtues and rancour softened by the amenity of his manners in the vigour of intellectual attainments and in the midst of usefulness. He was called by Divine Providence to rest with his fathers and went down to the chambers of death in the full belief that the grave is the pathway to future existence.

The lieutenant governor, Moses Gill, became acting governor and ran the state until elections were held in 1800.

==Family and legacy==

Sumner was married on September 30, 1779, to Elizabeth Hyslop, daughter of William Hyslop. Upon his father-in-law&#x27;s death, Sumner inherited a sizable estate which allowed him to maintain a dignified lifestyle during his public service. The couple had three children; his son William H. Sumner is well known for his efforts to develop what is now East Boston and for whom Boston&#x27;s Sumner Tunnel is named. His later descendants include Sumner Welles, a 20th-century diplomat and advisor to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and Sumner Gerard, a 20th-century diplomat, Montana politician, and U.S. Ambassador to Jamaica. Sumner, Maine, incorporated while he was governor in 1798, was named in his honor.

Sumner was described by his son as a talented and practical farmer and an excellent horseman. He was fond of agriculture and personally grafted an entire orchard of fruit trees on his farm. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and president of the board of trustees of the Roxbury Latin School.

At his confirmation hearings in 2017, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch recalled being moved by reading Sumner&#x27;s gravestone as a law student at Harvard. Gorsuch closed his opening statement by reading a portion of Sumner&#x27;s epitaph and adding &quot;[T]hose words stick with me. I keep them on my desk. They serve for me as a daily reminder of the law&#x27;s integrity, that a useful life can be led in its service, of the hard work it takes, and an encouragement to good habits when I fail and when I falter. At the end of it all, I can ask for nothing more than to be described as he was. And if confirmed, I pledge to you that I will do everything in my power to be that man.&quot;

<doc id="807165" wikidata="Q7886826" url="?curid=807165" title="Unionist Party of Northern Ireland">
<text>The Unionist Party of Northern Ireland was a political party founded by Brian Faulkner in September 1974.

==Formation==
The party emerged following splits in the Ulster Unionist Party in 1973 and 1974 over the British government&#x27;s white paper &quot;Northern Ireland Constitutional Proposals&quot;, the 1973 Northern Ireland Assembly election, and the Sunningdale Agreement. Faulkner had led the majority of the UUP into a power-sharing coalition but in January 1974 he was deposed as leader as the anti-Sunningdale faction of the party won control. In the February 1974 general election a number of Faulkner&#x27;s followers (including several sitting MPs) stood as Pro-Assembly Unionists against a coalition of the Ulster Unionist Party, the Vanguard Progressive Unionist Party and the Democratic Unionist Party. They failed to win a single seat at Westminster, and this defeat contributed to the downfall of the power-sharing Executive established by Sunningdale. However they remained active and in September constituted themselves as the Unionist Party of Northern Ireland, committed to a return to power-sharing as a settlement for Northern Ireland.

==Electoral history==
The party did not prosper. In the October 1974 general election they again failed to make much ground. The weakness of Faulkner&#x27;s position within Unionism was reflected in the fact that only about a dozen of the approximately 250 local councillors elected for the UUP in 1973 chose to join the new party. The 1975 elections to the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention were another blow to the party. Of 13 UPNI candidates elected as UUP members in 1973, only five succeeded in holding their seats, compared to 47 seats won by other Unionist candidates. The five UPNI members included Faulkner who suffered a personal setback in his South Down constituency. He finished in 7th place with 6,000 first preference votes in an area where he had topped the poll with 16,000 votes just two years earlier. Consequently the influence of both the UPNI and Faulkner waned.

In 1976 Faulkner stepped down as leader of the party (and withdrew from active politics) and was succeeded by Anne Dickson, the first woman to lead a political party in Northern Ireland. However the party continued to make little ground. In 1977 UPNI won just six local council seats. The 1979 Westminster election proved to be a further disappointment, as the main consequence of the party standing seemed to be to split the centre vote. In North Belfast, Dickson&#x27;s 4,000 votes were greater than the DUP majority of 1,000 over the UUP. Similarly in East Belfast the DUP finished 64 votes ahead of the UUP and 900 ahead of the Alliance party with Norman Agnew taking 2,000 votes for UPNI.

In 1981 the party admitted the weakness of its own position during the local government election campaign and that power-sharing on the 1973 model was no longer a viable option. The party fought the 1981 local elections in an electoral pact with the Ulster Popular Unionist Party but only won two seats. As a result in autumn 1981 the UPNI was formally dissolved. William Bailie, their last remaining councillor, joined the Alliance Party and was re-elected as an Alliance councillor in North Down.

==Leadership==
Faulkner himself died in a riding accident in 1977. Anne Dickson replaced him as leader of the party. However, the party had poor showings at the 1977 local elections and also the 1979 general election. The party was dissolved soon afterwards.

<doc id="807173" wikidata="Q6151058" url="?curid=807173" title="Jane (magazine)">
<text>Jane was an American magazine created to appeal to the women who grew up reading &quot;Sassy&quot; magazine; Jane Pratt was the founding editor of each. Its original target audience (pitched to advertisers) was aged 18–34, and was designed to appeal to women who did not like the typical women&#x27;s magazine format. Pratt originally intended the magazine to be named &quot;Betty&quot;, but she was voted down by everyone else involved in the making of the magazine.

==History and profile==
&quot;Jane&quot; was launched in September 1997; the final issue was dated August 2007. The events surrounding the magazine&#x27;s folding were chronicled through the experiences of two assistants on the Soapnet series &quot;The Fashionista Diaries&quot;. The magazine was published on a monthly basis.

&quot;Sassy&quot;, created by Pratt in 1987, was intended to appeal to adolescent girls, but because of its sexual candor and coverage of topics other teen magazines did not touch, such as the riot grrrl movement, its popularity exploded beyond its intended audience. When &quot;Sassy&quot; ended its New York editorial run in 1994, readers were left heartbroken and waiting for something to take its place. In September 1997, Jane Pratt&#x27;s new magazine, &quot;Jane&quot;, published by the Disney-owned Fairchild Publications, hit the stands with Drew Barrymore as its maiden cover girl. Fairchild Publications was purchased by Condé Nast Publications in 1999 and later sold to Penske Media in 2014.

On 25 July 2005, Pratt announced that she was resigning from her position as editor-in-chief of &quot;Jane&quot; and would be leaving the company on September 30, 2005, exactly eight years after the magazine&#x27;s debut.

In August 2005, Brandon Holley, editor in chief of &quot;Elle Girl&quot;, was named to take Pratt&#x27;s place. Stephanie Trong, who had been with the magazine since 1999, would remain as executive editor. Christina Kelly, managing editor of &quot;Elle Girl&quot;, as well as a rumored favorite to take over &quot;Jane&quot; because of her decades-long friendship with Jane Pratt, took over &quot;Elle Girl&quot;.

When &quot;Jane&quot; announced that it was ceasing publication, the magazine notified its readers that they would receive one of a number of sister magazines (&quot;Glamour&quot;, &quot;Allure&quot; or &quot;Lucky&quot;) for their remaining subscription durations. &quot;Glamour&quot;, &quot;Allure&quot;, and &quot;Lucky&quot; were all Condé Nast publications that were suffering from lower circulation. Subscribers who did not wish to receive these publications in lieu of the cancelled magazine could call Condé Nast and request any of the other magazines that they published, including the popular &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;.

The magazine appeared to be on a winning streak; however, the young target audience had moved on to digital and left print behind. &quot;Jane&quot; had the youngest average reader age of the women&#x27;s magazines, and the demise of &quot;Jane&quot; was seen by some as a sign of what was to come to the other women&#x27;s magazines. The millennial woman had moved to digital and were not going to &quot;age up&quot; to their magazine. This has proven to be true, as magazine circulation continues to erode in the double digits every year.

An episode of the MTV animated show &quot;Daria&quot; titled &quot;The Lost Girls&quot;, from Season 3, would poke fun at Pratt&#x27;s image and magazine. In the episode, an over-the-top name-dropping fashionista named Val, editor of &quot;Val&quot; magazine, visits Lawndale High after Daria wins an essay contest. Ultimately, Daria confronts Val about the unrealistic expectations that these fashion magazines force on young girls and about the mass-marketing of popular culture.

<doc id="807186" wikidata="Q548256" url="?curid=807186" title="Aristotele Fioravanti">
<text>Ridolfo &quot;Aristotele&quot; Fioravanti (also spelled Fieraventi; ; – ) was an Italian Renaissance architect and engineer. He was active in Moscow from 1475, where he designed the Dormition Cathedral during 1475–1479.

==Biography==

Little is known about Fioravanti&#x27;s early years. He was born in Bologna around 1415 into a family of architects and hydraulic engineers.

He became renowned for the very innovative devices he used for the rebuilding of the towers belonging to the noble families of the city. Between 1458 and 1467, he worked in Florence for Cosimo de&#x27; Medici the Elder and in Milan, before returning to his native city. There, he created the plans for the Palazzo Bentivoglio, but the edifice was not finished (by Giovanni II Bentivoglio) until 1484–1494. In 1467, he worked for King Matthias Corvinus in Hungary.

In 1475, at the invitation of Ivan III, he went to Moscow where he built the Dormition Cathedral during 1475–1479, taking inspiration from the Dormition Cathedral of Vladimir. This is the work for which he is best remembered.

According to some accounts, he was thrown into prison by Ivan III when he asked to return to Italy, and died in captivity. According to other accounts, he participated as a military engineer and artillery commander in the campaigns against Novgorod (1477–1478), Kazan (1482) and Tver (1485).

<text>Sherwood Louis Boehlert (September 28, 1936September 20, 2021) was an American politician from New York. He represented a large swath of central New York in the United States House of Representatives from 1983 until 2007. Boehlert, a Republican, was considered to be a member of the party&#x27;s moderate wing. He served as Chairman of the Science Committee from 2001 to 2006.

==Early life, education, and early political career==
Sherwood Louis Boehlert was born on September 28, 1936, in Utica, New York, to Elizabeth Monica ( Champoux) and Sherwood Boehlert, and graduated from Utica College. He was a practicing Roman Catholic. He served two years in the United States Army (1956–1958) and then worked as a manager of public relations for Wyandotte Chemical Company. After leaving Wyandotte, Boehlert served as Chief of Staff for two upstate Congressmen, Alexander Pirnie and Donald J. Mitchell; following this, he was elected the county executive of Oneida County, New York, serving from 1979 to 1983. After his four-year term as county executive, he ran successfully for Congress in the elections of 1982. He was re-elected to every Congress subsequent until his retirement.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
Mitchell did not run for reelection in 1982. Boehlert entered the Republican primary to succeed him in the district, which had been renumbered from the 31st to the 25th in redistricting. He won the primary with 56% of the vote. He won the general election by defeating Democrat Anita Maxwell 56%–42%.

After that, he won re-election every two years until he decided to retire and not seek re-election, in 2006. His district number changed twice, each time after redistricting—from the 25th (1983–1993) to the 23rd (1993–2003) to the 24th (2003- 2007). He was challenged in the Republican primary five times: 1986 (67%), 1996 (65%), 2000 (57%), 2002 (53%), and 2004 (60%). His lowest re-election winning percentage in the general election was 57%, in his last re-election in 2004, when he defeated Democrat Jeff Miller 57%–34%.

=== Tenure ===

Boehlert is best known for his work on environmental policy. Beginning in the 1980s with the acid rain crisis, Boehlert became a prominent voice in the Republican party for the environment. He was a major contributor to the acid rain provisions of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. He pushed continually to increase Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for light trucks and automobiles and was the lead GOP sponsor of numerous CAFE amendments. Due to Boehlert&#x27;s constant battles over environmental legislation, often putting him at odds with his party&#x27;s leadership, &quot;National Journal&quot; dubbed Boehlert the &quot;Green Hornet&quot; and featured him as one of the dozen &quot;key players&quot; in the House of Representatives. Due to his centrist views, &quot;Time Magazine&quot; also recognized Boehlert as a &quot;power center&quot; on Capitol Hill and &quot;Congressional Quarterly&quot; named him one of the 50 most effective Members of Congress. Boehlert was a member of several national moderate GOP groups including the Republican Main Street Partnership and the Ripon Society.

On the Science Committee, Boehlert championed investments in the National Science Foundation, science and math education programs and the Department of Energy&#x27;s Office of Science. As chairman he pushed for measures to increase cybersecurity research and the creation of a Science and Technology Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security. After 9/11 and the 2001 anthrax attacks, Boehlert crafted legislation establishing the DHS S&amp;T Directorate to oversee development of technologies to secure against terrorist attacks. This homeland security S&amp;T bill reported out of the Science Committee was ultimately accepted by the congressional leadership and President Bush and enacted as part of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. Boehlert was one of the first Members of Congress to call for a competitiveness agenda, culminating with a major National Academy of Sciences report Rising Above the Gathering Storm on retaining U.S. leadership in science and engineering, as well as the American Competitiveness Initiative introduced by President Bush in 2006.

Boehlert was an active promoter of first responder legislation, a strong champion for volunteer firefighters and original member and Chairman of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus.

On March 17, 2006, at a press conference Boehlert announced that he would not seek a thirteenth term in office. Several important landmarks are named for Boehlert that reflect his work on transportation and science issues. These include the renovated Union Station in Utica and the new science facilities of the Air Force Research Laboratory—Information Directorate in Rome, New York.

=== Committee assignments ===
Boehlert served on the Science Committee for his entire congressional career. In addition, he was the third-ranking member of the Transportation Committee; from 1995 to 2000, he served as the chairman of its Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment. He was also a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, serving as interim chairman in 2004.

==Post-congressional career==
After 2007, Boehlert remained active promoting environmental and scientific causes. He served on the Board of the bipartisan Alliance for Climate Protection chaired by former Vice President Al Gore. Boehlert served as a Senior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center. He was a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

In 2016, Boehlert endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for president, and in 2018, he endorsed Democratic candidate Anthony Brindisi for New York&#x27;s 22nd congressional district, which contained much of Boehlert&#x27;s former district.

==Death==
Boehlert died from complications of dementia at a hospice care facility in New Hartford, New York, on September 20, 2021, at age 84. His Funeral Mass was held at Our Lady of Lourdes, Utica, New York, on September 27, 2021.

<text>Gustav Jäger (June 23, 1832 – May 13, 1917) was a German naturalist and hygienist.

==Biography==
He was born at the historic Pfarrhaus in the village of Bürg, Neuenstadt am Kocher in Württemberg. After studying medicine at Tübingen, he became a teacher of zoology in Vienna. In 1868, he was appointed professor of zoology at the academy of Hohenheim, and subsequently he became teacher of zoology and anthropology at Stuttgart Polytechnic and professor of physiology at the Veterinary School. In 1884, he abandoned teaching and started practice as a physician in Stuttgart. He wrote various works on biological subjects, including &quot;Die Darwinsche Theorie und ihre Stellung zu Moral und Religion&quot; (1869), and &quot;Lehrbuch der allgemeinen Zoologie&quot; (1871–1878). Jäger was an early supporter of Darwinism.

In 1876, he suggested a hypothesis in explanation of heredity, resembling the germ plasm theory subsequently elaborated by August Weismann, to the effect that the germinal protoplasm retains its specific properties from generation to generation, dividing in each reproduction into an ontogenetic portion, out of which the individual is built up, and a phylogenetic portion, which is reserved to form the reproductive material of the mature offspring.
In &quot;Die Entdeckung der Seele&quot; (&quot;The Discovery of The Soul&quot;, 1878), Jäger advanced the first crude version of the pheromone concept. His postulated skin, &quot;anthropines,&quot; popularly dubbed as &quot;lust compounds,&quot; came astoundingly close to reality but the idea was too far ahead of the possibilities of chemistry and the life sciences at this time to be corroborated by experiments.

The system of clothing associated with his name originates from &quot;Die Normalkleidung als Gesundheitsschutz&quot; (&quot;Standardized Apparel For Health Protection&quot; (1880)), wherein he advocated the wearing of rough fabrics, such as wool, &quot;close to the skin,&quot; objecting especially to the use of any kind of plant fibre. The teachings of Jäger inspired the creation of the Jaeger clothing brand.

From the 1860s on, Jäger immersed himself in popularizing science through print media, associations, and the founding of a public aquarium and small zoo in Vienna. In 1881, he founded his own magazine devoted to spreading his idea about health reform (&quot;Prof. Dr. G. Jägers Monatsblatt&quot;).

He also was a very active entomologist specialising in beetles particularly Buprestidae and Scarabaeidae. He wrote with Carl Gustav Calwer &quot;Käferbuch-Naturgeschichte der Käfer Europas&quot; (&quot;Beetle Book: Natural History of Europe&#x27;s Beetles&quot;). This very popular work was successively reprinted until 1916. His beetle collection is in the Stuttgart Natural History Museum.

<doc id="807209" wikidata="Q207778" url="?curid=807209" title="Second Dynasty of Egypt">
<text>The Second Dynasty of ancient Egypt (or Dynasty II, – ) is the latter of the two dynasties of the Egyptian Archaic Period, when the seat of government was centred at Thinis. It is most known for its last ruler, Khasekhemwy, but is otherwise one of the most obscure periods in Egyptian history.

Though archaeological evidence of the time is very scant, contrasting data from the First and Third Dynasties indicates important institutional and economic developments during the Second Dynasty.

== Rulers ==
For the first three pharaohs, sources are fairly close in agreement and the order is supported by an inscription on the statuette of Hetepdief, who served in the mortuary cults of these three kings.
But the identity of the next few rulers is unclear. Surviving sources might be giving the Horus name or the Nebty name and the birth names of these rulers. They may also be entirely different individuals, or could be legendary names. This might never be resolved.

It has been theorised that following the reign of Nynetjer, the country was split and ruled by two successors due to the overly complex state administration of the whole of Egypt.

The following list contains various king names from different sources:
With the last ruler, the sources return to an agreement:
Manetho states Thinis was the capital, as in the First Dynasty, but the first three kings were buried at Saqqara, suggesting the center of power had moved to Memphis. Beyond this, little can be said about the events during this period as the annual records on the Palermo stone only survive to the end of the reign of Nebra and for parts of Nynetjer&#x27;s. One important event, the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, might have occurred during the reign of Khasekhemwy as many Egyptologists read his name as &quot;the Two Powers arise&quot;.

<text>Sir Edward Guildford (alternative spelling Guilford; c. 1474 – 1534) was an English courtier and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports and Marshal of Calais in 1519. Upon his father&#x27;s death in 1506, he inherited his father&#x27;s position as Master of the Armoury for life. He was knighted on 25 September 1513.

==Family==
Edward Guildford was born at Offington in the parish of Broadwater (now part of Worthing), the son of Sir Richard Guildford and Anne Pympe.

Guildford married firstly, before 1496, Eleanor West, daughter of Thomas West, 8th Baron De La Warr (d. 11 October 1525), by whom he had a son, Richard, and a daughter, Jane, who married John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, with whom she had 13 children. His second wife was Joan, daughter of Stephen Pitlesden, by whom he had no issue.

His son Richard having predeceased him, Edward Guildford caused considerable strife with the family legacy when his daughter Jane inherited Haldon Manor rather than his nephew, John Guildford, Member of Parliament for Gatton, who was (arguably) instead intended to inherit with no nearer male heir.

<doc id="807221" wikidata="Q150502" url="?curid=807221" title="Muggsy Bogues">
<text>Tyrone Curtis &quot;Muggsy&quot; Bogues (born January 9, 1965) is an American former basketball player. The shortest player ever to play in the National Basketball Association (NBA), the Bogues played point guard for four teams during his 14-season career in the NBA. Although best known for his ten seasons with the Charlotte Hornets, he also played for the Washington Bullets, Golden State Warriors, and Toronto Raptors.

Bogues finished in the top seven in assists in six consecutive seasons (1989–1995), and in the top ten in steals in three of those seasons. He had 146 career NBA double-doubles. After his NBA career, he served as head coach of the now-defunct Charlotte Sting of the WNBA. Bogues also had a surprising defensive ability. He blocked 39 shots throughout his NBA career, including one from 7-foot-tall Patrick Ewing.

==Early life==
Bogues was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and grew up in the Lafayette Court housing projects. His mother was and his father was . He had three older siblings.

Bogues&#x27;s childhood was troubled. At five years old, he was hit by stray buckshot in his neighborhood and had to be hospitalized. As a child, he witnessed a man get beaten to death with a baseball bat, a sight that haunted him into adulthood. When Bogues was 12 years old, his father was sentenced to twenty years in prison for armed robbery. Around the same time, his brother Chuckie began using hard drugs.

In addition to basketball, Bogues was a standout wrestler and baseball player growing up. As a child playing basketball on playgrounds, he was nicknamed &quot;Muggsy&quot; after a diminutive character from The Bowery Boys.

Bogues initially attended and played basketball at Southern High School in Baltimore. Because Bogues aspired to be a dental technician, he transferred to Baltimore&#x27;s Dunbar High School which offered healthcare classes. At Dunbar, he was coached by Bob Wade, later the head coach at the University of Maryland. He was a teammate of future NBA players David Wingate, Reggie Williams, and Reggie Lewis (the latter two of whom were in his graduating class). The Dunbar Poets finished the 1981–82 season at 29–0 during Bogues&#x27;s junior year and finished 31–0 during his senior year in 1982–83, and were ranked first in the nation by &quot;USA Today&quot;.

Bogues received scholarship offers to play college basketball for several schools including Virginia, Penn State and Seton Hall.

==College==
Bogues attended Wake Forest University and played college basketball for the Wake Forest Demon Deacons for four years. He averaged 11.3 points, 8.4 assists and 3.1 steals per game in his junior year. He followed with a senior campaign in which he averaged 14.8 points, 9.5 assists, 3.8 rebounds and 2.4 steals per game. In 1986–87, he led the Atlantic Coast Conference in steals and assists and received the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award. As a senior, he received the Arnold Palmer Award as Wake Forest&#x27;s most valuable athlete. When his collegiate career ended, he was the ACC career leader in steals and assists.

Wake Forest retired his number within a few years of his leaving the program. In 2001, he was inducted into the Wake Forest Sports Hall of Fame. , he remains Wake Forest&#x27;s all-time leader in both steals and assists.

Bogues played for the USA national team in the 1986 FIBA World Championship and won the gold medal. Under head coach Lute Olson, Bogues played in all ten of the team&#x27;s games and led them in assists and steals.

==Professional career==

===Rhode Island Gulls (1987)===
Bogues was selected second overall in the 1987 United States Basketball League draft by the Rhode Island Gulls. Bogues was a fan favorite in the USBL and the Gulls led the league in attendance. In his only season in the league, he averaged 22.2 points and 8.4 assists per game and led the league in minutes per game before an ankle injury ended his season.

===Washington Bullets (1987–1988)===
Bogues was drafted twelfth overall in the 1987 NBA draft by the Washington Bullets, and was part of a talent-laden draft class that also included David Robinson, Reggie Miller, Scottie Pippen, and Kevin Johnson. Bogues made his NBA debut on November 6, 1987, against the Atlanta Hawks at Omni Coliseum; he started and led the team in assists. At the time of his debut, he was shorter than the average NBA player. In his rookie year, Bogues was a teammate of Manute Bol who stood tall. They were the tallest and shortest players in NBA history at the time, with difference between them. Bol and Bogues appeared on three magazine covers together. Bogues&#x27;s playing time dropped dramatically when coach Kevin Loughery was fired and replaced with Wes Unseld. On March 4, 1988, Bogues recorded seven steals (and scored 10 points) during a 95–88 win over the Indiana Pacers. Despite starting only fourteen games as a rookie, Bogues led the Bullets in both steals and assists.

===Charlotte Hornets (1988–1997)===
The following season, the Bullets left Bogues and Jay Murphy unprotected in the 1988 NBA expansion draft and he was selected by the Charlotte Hornets. Bogues told the &quot;Washington Post&quot; that he had &quot;no quarrel&quot; with the Bullets for leaving him unprotected and his agents reported that he was excited to start anew in Charlotte.

In Charlotte&#x27;s first season, head coach Dick Harter confined Bogues to the bench, preferring to use him to provide short bursts of energy as a substitute. Harter was fired during the following season and Bogues began to flourish in the up-tempo offenses run by his successors, Gene Littles and Allan Bristow. Bogues went on to play parts of ten seasons with the Hornets, spending the vast majority of his time as a starter and becoming one of the faces of the Hornets alongside Alonzo Mourning and Larry Johnson.

During his time in Charlotte, the Hornets rose from mediocrity to a serious contender; Bogues three times led the team to the playoffs. During this time, Bogues was wildly popular among basketball fans, as were the Hornets. In all six seasons between 1989 and 1995, he finished in the top ten in the league in assists, only once finishing worse than fourth. In 1992–93, Bogues had the NBA&#x27;s best assist-to-turnover ratio. One of his best seasons came in 1993–94 when he averaged a double-double, including a second-place finish in assists per game. In the 1994–95 season, he set a career high with 10.8 points per game. However, in August 1995, after six consecutive seasons of an increasing scoring average, he underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee. The recovery and repeated setbacks saw him placed on the injured list at least three separate times in the 1995–96 season. He finished the season with only fourteen points in six games. Bogues returned to action in earnest the following season but missed 17 games and his production had dropped off slightly across the board.

Bogues&#x27;s relationship with the team soured considerably in 1997. In June, coach Dave Cowens suggested that Bogues should consider retiring due to his nagging knee injury. Only a week later, the Hornets signed point guard David Wesley, his presumptive replacement. In August, owner George Shinn assured Bogues that he would be able to finish his playing career with the team. However, the team later requested that he undergo a preseason MRI on his injured knee. On November 7, Bogues was traded, along with Tony Delk, to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for B. J. Armstrong. At the time, he was the NBA&#x27;s all-time leader in assist-to-turnover ratio and the franchise leader in steals and assists. After the trade, he severed ties with the organization. The trade made Dell Curry, Bogues&#x27; closest friend on the team, the last remaining original member of the Hornets.

===Golden State Warriors (1997–1999)===
Bogues led the Warriors in assists in the 1997–98 season despite starting in fewer than half of the team&#x27;s games. He appeared in 36 games in the lockout-shortened following season, missing time due to hamstring and knee injuries as well as chickenpox.

===Toronto Raptors (1999–2001)===
Prior to the 1999–2000 season, Bogues signed with the Toronto Raptors for the veterans&#x27; minimum, reuniting him with longtime teammate Dell Curry. With the Raptors in 1999–2000, he played 80 games in a season for the first time since 1992–93, though he started in only five of those games. At 35 years old on March 3, 2000, he tied a career high with 24 points in a victory over the Boston Celtics.

Due to his chronic knee injury, Bogues appeared in only three games in the 2000–01 season, which would be his final. His last game came on January 27, 2001, against the Chicago Bulls, a scoreless outing. On February 22, 2001, he was traded with Mark Jackson to the New York Knicks for Chris Childs and a 2002 first round draft pick. He was included in the trade for salary cap reasons and never reported to New York during his stint with them. At the end of the last season in which he played, Bogues ranked twelfth all-time in assists and thirteenth all-time in assists per game in NBA history.

On August 10, 2001, Bogues was traded to the Dallas Mavericks in a three-team deal involving Shandon Anderson, Howard Eisley and Glen Rice. He told the team that he intended to step away from basketball to care for his mother who was fighting cancer. New Mavericks owner Mark Cuban decided to waive Bogues and fully guarantee the remaining three years on his contract; had he retired before being waived, he would not have been owed any money.

In July 2002, after his mother&#x27;s death, Bogues told &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; that he was hoping to play again.

==Career after the NBA==
His autobiography, &quot;In the Land of Giants&quot;, was released in 1994 and recounts the struggles of growing up in inner-city Baltimore and achieving success in the NBA.

After leaving the NBA, Bogues worked in the real estate business until August 3, 2005, when he was named head coach of the Charlotte Sting in the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association, despite a lack of coaching experience. He was shorter than all of his players—at , Helen Darling was the shortest Sting player. Bogues led the Sting to a 14–30 record before the team folded in January 2007.

In 2011, he became the head coach of United Faith Christian Academy boys&#x27; high school basketball team in Charlotte, North Carolina, after serving as an assistant to former head coach Shaun Wiseman. The school produced six all-state players during his three seasons as head coach. Despite being offered a new contract, he stepped down in 2014 to pursue other opportunities.

On March 18, 2014, Bogues was named the Charlotte Hornets&#x27; Ambassador, participating in the team&#x27;s rebranding.

In 2018, Bogues invested in Ash &amp; Erie, a clothing company for short men, after watching an episode of &quot;Shark Tank&quot; and reaching out to &quot;Shark Tank&quot; panelist Mark Cuban who had also invested in the company.

Bogues remarried his ex-wife, Kim, in 2015.

On June 21, 1991, Bogues and Hornets teammate Dell Curry appeared in a Minor League Baseball game for the Gastonia Rangers of the South Atlantic League. George Shinn, as owner of both teams, arranged the publicity stunt. Bogues and Curry were scheduled to play the entire nine-inning game but it was shortened by rain. Bogues played second base and was hitless in both of his at bats.

In August 1993, Bogues&#x27;s father died in Baltimore of pneumonia. He had been released early from prison but had resumed using drugs, often with Bogues&#x27;s brother, Chuckie.

Bogues&#x27;s sister, Sherron, worked for the Baltimore Department of Recreation and Parks for 32 years until her death from cancer at age 55 in 2015. Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake named June 27 &quot;Sherron Bogues Day&quot; in her honor.

Bogues&#x27;s grandson, Samartine, is a youth basketball player who received media attention for his play while still in elementary school and received his first college basketball scholarship offer in 2020 while still a high school freshman.

==Origins==
The name &quot;Jack Sprat&quot; was used of people of small stature in the 16th century. This rhyme became an English proverb from at least the mid-17th century. It appeared in John Clarke&#x27;s collection of sayings in 1639 in the form:

Like many nursery rhymes, &quot;Jack Sprat&quot; may have originated as a satire on a public figure. History writer Linda Alchin suggests that Jack was King Charles I, who was left &quot;lean&quot; when parliament denied him taxation, but with his queen Henrietta Maria he was free to &quot;lick the platter clean&quot; after he dissolved parliament—Charles was a notably short man. An alternative explanation comes from the popular Robin Hood legend, applying it to the disliked King John and his greedy queen Isabella.

The saying entered the canon of English nursery rhymes when it was printed in &quot;Mother Goose&#x27;s Melody&quot; around 1765, but it may have been adopted for use with children much earlier.

<doc id="807243" wikidata="Q1754010" url="?curid=807243" title="The Beach Boys Love You">
<text>The Beach Boys Love You is the 21st studio album by American rock band the Beach Boys, released April 11, 1977, on Brother/Reprise. Sometimes called the band&#x27;s &quot;punk&quot; or &quot;synth-pop&quot; album, &quot;Love You&quot; is characterized for its pioneering use of synthesizers and its juxtaposition of adolescent-oriented lyrics with the adult band members&#x27; gravelly vocals.

The album was largely recorded in late 1976 at the band&#x27;s Brother Studios. Originally planned as &quot;Brian Loves You&quot;, it is essentially a solo project by Brian Wilson, who wrote almost all of the material and played nearly every instrument on the record, including keyboards, synthesizers, and drums. He later referred to &quot;Love You&quot; as his life-defining work, and his most creatively fulfilling since &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; (1966). Engineer Earle Mankey described the album as &quot;serious&quot;, &quot;autobiographical&quot;, and &quot;frighteningly accurate&quot; to Wilson&#x27;s personality.

The subject matter of the 14 songs ranges from the Solar System and roller skating to adolescent sexuality and babies. Wilson also included tributes to his wife, daughters, and mistress, as well as his idols Phil Spector and Johnny Carson. Although &quot;Love You&quot; was met with near-unanimous critical acclaim, some listeners found the album&#x27;s bizarre, childlike quality to be a detriment. The record sold poorly, peaking at number 53 in the U.S. and number 28 in the UK.

&quot;Love You&quot; has since been recognized for presaging synth-pop and new wave. A follow-up, &quot;Adult/Child&quot;, was completed by the group, but left unreleased. It was the last album Wilson wrote and produced until his first solo LP, &quot;Brian Wilson&quot; (1988), and his last that was created without significant interference from outsiders.

==Background==

Following a period of semi-inactivity, in late 1975, Wilson became a patient under psychologist Eugene Landy&#x27;s radical 24-hour therapy program. Under Landy&#x27;s care, he became more stable and socially engaged, with his productivity increasing once again. During the latter half of 1976, Wilson became a regular member of the band&#x27;s touring line-up for the first time since 1964. The tagline &quot;Brian&#x27;s Back!&quot; became a major promotional tool for the group&#x27;s concert tours, as well as their July release &quot;15 Big Ones&quot;, the first Beach Boys LP that reached the U.S. top 10 with new material since &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; (1966), and their first that credited Wilson as the sole producer since &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;.

&quot;15 Big Ones&quot;, which had consisted of an equal share of cover songs and originals, came as a disappointment for most fans and the group members themselves. In a contemporary interview, Wilson acknowledged that the album was &quot;nothing too deep&quot;, but promised that the band&#x27;s next release would be &quot;a masterpiece&quot; on par with &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; (1966). It was to be the second-to-last album owed to their record company, Warner Bros., as their contract had been set to expire in July 1977.

From July to August 1976, Wilson joined his bandmates on a U.S. tour, after which he produced a large collection of studio recordings, largely by himself while the other Beach Boys were preoccupied with their own personal and creative affairs. Dennis Wilson worked on his first solo album &quot;Pacific Ocean Blue&quot; (1977), Carl Wilson produced Ricci Martin&#x27;s &quot;Beached&quot; (1977), Mike Love taught Transcendental Meditation, and Al Jardine spent time with his family. Landy was dismissed as Brian&#x27;s psychologist in early December, amid concerns of his raising fees and controversial treatment methods. 

At the time, Wilson had considered issuing his new material under his own name. Asked in a December 1976 interview about his feelings on a solo career, Brian responded that he would like to release a solo album, however, he did not want to deal with the inner-band politics that would result from him becoming a solo artist. He said, &quot;They want to keep the material for the Beach Boys, too&quot;. Later in the interview, he remarked that he had recently left the band temporarily, citing a wish to have &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;to do my own album&quot;, and was undecided on whether he would stay as their producer or instead pursue a solo career.

==Production and style==

&quot;Love You&quot; was largely recorded in October and November 1976 at the band&#x27;s Brother Studios in Santa Monica, California. Demo recordings, in which Wilson previewed his new songs for his bandmates, were captured at a Brother Studios session in fall 1976. The demoed songs were &quot;Airplane&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Bet He&#x27;s Nice&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Over Now&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Put Our Hearts Together”, &quot;Love Is a Woman&quot;, &quot;Little Children”, &quot;Mona&quot;, and &quot;Still I Dream of It”. In 2021, five of these demo recordings were officially released as downloadables on Wilson&#x27;s official website.

The &quot;Love You&quot; sessions marked the first time that Brian was given free rein on a new Beach Boys album since the &quot;Smile&quot; sessions in 1967. He wrote almost the entire album and performed nearly every instrument, including keyboards, synthesizers, and drums. Carl and Dennis contributed some instrumentation, while Jardine and Love were rarely present for the sessions, and ultimately every member of the band sang several lead vocals. In biographer Peter Ames Carlin&#x27;s estimation, &quot;it was essentially [Brian&#x27;s] solo album&quot;, while biographer Christian Matijas-Mecca concurred that it was effectively &quot;a Brian Wilson solo album with only brief contributions by other members of the band who added their parts after the bulk of the work was finished.&quot; Conversely, Jardine said, &quot;In a way, [&quot;Love You&quot;] was Carl&#x27;s tribute to Brian... Carl wanted Brian to feel appreciated. He had the most to do with that album, him and Dennis, paying tribute to their brother.&quot; Biographer Jon Stebbins similarly viewed it as &quot;pretty much a Wilson brothers album&quot;, adding that &quot;it&#x27;s clear that Dennis and Carl willingly checked their egos to help Brian get this one out.&quot;

Contrasting his earlier records, which had used orchestras of organic instruments, electronic sounds pervade &quot;Love You&quot;, with Brian more reliant on the Moog synthesizer than he had been on &quot;15 Big Ones&quot;. All of the bass lines were performed by himself with ARP and Moog synthesizers. Biographer Mark Dillon attributed the record&#x27;s &quot;oddball sound&quot; directly to Wilson&#x27;s use of these instruments. Jardine acknowledged, &quot;The Minimoogs are all over the place.&quot; Wilson said his use of synthesizers was partly influenced by Wendy Carlos&#x27; &quot;Switched-On Bach&quot; (1969). Like on &quot;15 Big Ones&quot;, Dennis&#x27; and Brian&#x27;s vocals appeared rough and strained. Carlin describes Brian&#x27;s singing style on &quot;Love You&quot; as a &quot;gravelly, messed-up baritone and often slightly off-key. .. in some ways it almost feels like a suicidal gesture.&quot;

Brother staff engineer Earle Mankey, who had also worked on &quot;15 Big Ones&quot;, recalled that Wilson appeared to exert more self-discipline during the &quot;Love You&quot; sessions, working typically from 10 or 11 A.M. to the early afternoon. He said that, unlike prior occasions, Wilson took the initiative to record in the studio &quot;instead of being forced into it.&quot; Carl was credited on the &quot;Love You&quot; liner notes as &quot;mixdown producer&quot;. According to Mankey, &quot;Carl took his productions seriously and did really careful mixes. When Brian came in, he&#x27;d say, &#x27;Let&#x27;s mix this,&#x27; and after one pass, like five minutes later, he&#x27;d say, &#x27;That&#x27;s good!&#x27; Or maybe he&#x27;d say, &#x27;More bass! More vocal!&#x27; But that was it.&quot;

==Themes==
The first side of the album consists of uptempo songs, with the other side contains song that reflect a more adult perspective. The lyrical content ranged from Wilson&#x27;s stream-of-conscious (such as on &quot;Solar System&quot;) to adolescent concerns (such as &quot;roller skating&quot;, schoolmate infatuations, and fraternizing with the family of one&#x27;s girlfriend). Wilson went in this direction because he believed that these were the type of lyrics that fans had wanted from the Beach Boys.

Relative to &quot;15 Big Ones&quot;, Wilson stated that he had wanted &quot;Love You&quot; to be &quot;more creative, more original&quot; and &quot;lyrically much more interesting.&quot; His 2016 memoir, &quot;I Am Brian Wilson&quot;, compared the lyrical approach to &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. &quot;I wrote some songs that were about how I felt in my thirties, the same way that &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; was about how I felt in my twenties.&quot; Mankey surmised, &quot;Brian Wilson lyrics maybe weren&#x27;t as familiar to the public as [his past co-written lyrics] were, and so &quot;The Beach Boys Love You&quot; songs might have seemed odder because no one knew what Brian was really like.&quot;

Carlin characterizes the total effect as having reframed the themes of past Beach Boys hits through Wilson&#x27;s &quot;warped&quot; adult perspective, as well as &quot;a tour through the cracked fun-house mirror of [his] imagination&quot;. Dillon acknowledged that, given the age of the band members, the fact that they &quot;sing these teenage ditties made the tunes a little creepy&quot;. Stebbins felt that the album &quot;revealed more than the listener wanted to know&quot;, containing songs with &quot;unsettling, pedophilic overtone[s]&quot; such as &quot;Roller Skating Child&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Pick You Up&quot;. According to biographer Timothy White, it was a &quot;portrait of a man trying to redefine his shattered personality.&quot;

==Songs==

===Side one===
&quot;Let Us Go On This Way&quot; is a rock song in which the narrator, a young man, expresses to his object of affection, &quot;To get you babe, I went through the ringer / ain&#x27;t gonna let you slip through my finger&quot;, followed by a plea for God to &quot;let us go on this way&quot;. Wilson said he wrote the song with Mike Love when they found that the rest of the album sounded too &quot;deadpan and we needed something uptempo&quot;.

&quot;Roller Skating Child&quot; elaborates on the themes of &quot;Let Us Go On This Way&quot; except, as Carlin writes, &quot;with a grown-up perspective that made it sound like a kind of musical interpretation of Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s novel &quot;Lolita&quot;, complete with vivid descriptions of adolescent sexuality... careless parenting [and] lust-fueled escape&quot;.&quot; Wilson said the song was a tribute to his daughters Carnie and Wendy. He clarified, &quot;Carnie actually goes &quot;ice&quot;-skating but I called it &#x27;Roller skating child, with a ribbon in her hair.&#x27; We all go out to a skating rink in Santa Monica.&quot;

&quot;Mona&quot; is a 1950s-style love song with only four chords. The lyrics discuss some of Wilson&#x27;s favorite songs by Phil Spector, including his 1963 productions of the Crystals&#x27; &quot;Da Doo Ron Ron&quot; and the Ronettes&#x27; &quot;Be My Baby&quot;.

&quot;Johnny Carson&quot; similarly expresses admiration for the host of the late-night television talk show, &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. Carlin refers to the track as the album&#x27;s &quot;pivot point&quot;, one that &quot;separates the normal from the freakishly bizarre.&quot;

&quot;Good Time&quot; is a song about a man who declares of his various girlfriends, &quot;Maybe it won&#x27;t last but what do we care / My baby and I just want a good time&quot;. The track had already been released, albeit with different vocals, as the second single by American Spring from their 1972 album &quot;Spring&quot;, which Wilson had produced. Wilson explained that he had recycled the song for &quot;Love You&quot; because he did not want the song to languish in obscurity. His voice had deteriorated significantly in the years since, making it the only track on &quot;Love You&quot; in which his singing is not coarse.

&quot;Honkin&#x27; Down the Highway&quot; is a rock and roll song about a man driving to a woman, at her father&#x27;s behest, for an engagement that the narrator states will conclude with himself &quot;Takin&#x27; one little inch at a time, now / &#x27;Til we&#x27;re feelin&#x27; fine, now&quot;. Wilson said that the theme of driving on a highway was inspired by country music. 

&quot;Ding Dang&quot; is a short song, consisting of a single verse and chorus, that Wilson had written with the Byrds&#x27; Roger McGuinn in the early 1970s. Wilson had recorded and reworked the song in the studio on numerous occasions during the mid-1970s, and Mankey noted that &quot;everybody who showed up [to the &quot;Love You&quot; sessions] got subjected to &#x27;Ding Dang&#x27;.&quot; It appeared on the album with a less than one-minute runtime, virtually unaltered from how Wilson and McGuinn originally left it.

===Side two===

&quot;Solar System&quot; discusses the Solar System in a similar vein as the band&#x27;s 1965 hit &quot;California Girls&quot;. In the song, the narrator asks, &quot;What do the planets mean? / And have you ever seen / sunrise in the mornin&#x27;? / It shined when you were born&quot;.

&quot;The Night Was So Young&quot;, according to Carlin, revels in &quot;traditional shades of self-pity, jealousy, and loneliness&quot;. It was written about Wilson&#x27;s mistress, Debbie Keil, and her nightly visits to his home. Stebbins called it &quot;a direct descendent of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; in both sound and attitude.&quot;

&quot;I&#x27;ll Bet He&#x27;s Nice&quot;, which is in a similar vein to &quot;The Night Was So Young&quot;, features lead vocals shared between the three Wilson brothers, with Brian and Dennis on the verses and Carl on the bridge section.

&quot;Let&#x27;s Put Our Hearts Together&quot; is a duet between Wilson and his first wife Marilyn. In the song, they discuss the insecurities that they feel for each other before coming together to &quot;see what we can cook up between us&quot;. Wilson said that he enlisted Marilyn as a vocalist because he had inadvertently composed the song in a key outside of his vocal range.

&quot;I Wanna Pick You Up&quot;, in Carlin&#x27;s description, concerns an &quot;object of desire&quot; that is &quot;either a disturbingly sexualized infant or a dismayingly infantilized adult.&quot; At the end of the song, the singer instructs the listener to &quot;pat, pat, pat her on her butt, butt / She&#x27;s gone to sleep, be quiet&quot;. Wilson explained that the lyrics are about a man pretending that a woman is &quot;small like a baby&quot; and &quot;really wants to pick her up!&quot;

&quot;Airplane&quot; is a love song written from the perspective of someone flying on an airplane.

&quot;Love Is a Woman&quot; concludes the album with an instrumental palette of saxophones and flutes. Wilson wrote of the song, &quot;It&#x27;s just about everybody, about anything, about how things are. It&#x27;s an idea that a woman is love. A baby is love, too, of course. It&#x27;s just an experience, you know? &#x27;Love is a Baby&#x27; would have been a better title.&quot;

===Leftover===
Several songs that were recorded or worked on during the &quot;Love You&quot; sessions were passed over for inclusion on the album. Among these were the originals &quot;That Special Feeling&quot;, &quot;11th Bar Blues&quot;, &quot;Clangin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Hey Little Tomboy&quot;, &quot;Lazy Lizzie&quot;, &quot;Sherry She Needs Me&quot;, &quot;Marilyn Rovell&quot;, &quot;My Diane&quot;, &quot;Hey There Momma&quot;, and &quot;We Gotta Groove&quot;. &quot;Sherry She Needs Me&quot; dated from the band&#x27;s &quot;Summer Days (and Summer Nights!!)&quot; era, with Wilson overdubbing a new lead vocal onto the backing track from 1965. &quot;Lazy Lizzie&quot; includes a melody recycled from Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Mount Vernon and Fairway&quot; (1973). Biographer David Leaf referred to the song as &quot;a fully realized production as well as a strong example of Brian&#x27;s songwriting ability.&quot;

In addition, Wilson worked on cover versions of the Drifters&#x27; &quot;Ruby Baby&quot; and the Righteous Brothers&#x27; &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;&quot;. According to band archivist Alan Boyd, the &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;&quot; cover &quot;is very dark and it&#x27;s very raw. It almost has kind of a punk edge to it... He plays everything on it, did all the vocals. Everything was pretty much done in one take.&quot;

&quot;Hey Little Tomboy&quot; and &quot;My Diane&quot; were completed for &quot;M.I.U. Album&quot; (1978). &quot;Hey There Momma&quot; was reworked into &quot;I Saw Santa (Rockin&#x27; Around the Christmas Tree)&quot;; the reworking was released on the 1998 compilation &quot;Ultimate Christmas&quot;. &quot;Sherry She Needs Me&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;&quot; were released on the box set &quot;Made in California&quot; (2013). &quot;11th Bar Blues&quot;, &quot;Clangin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Lazy Lizzie&quot;, &quot;Marilyn Rovell&quot;, &quot;We Gotta Groove&quot;, &quot;That Special Feeling&quot;, and &quot;Hey There Momma&quot; remain unreleased.

==Packaging==
Wilson originally intended to title the album &quot;Brian Loves You&quot;, with the &quot;you&quot; referring to the group&#x27;s fanbase. He said that he chose the name &quot;Love You&quot; because he &quot;thought it would be a good sound people could feel secure with&quot;. To make the album seem more democratic, its title was changed to &quot;The Beach Boys Love You&quot;. Reflective of the new title, the inner sleeve included a dedication to Wilson from his bandmates, &quot;To Brian, whom we love with all our hearts...&quot;, written below a photo of him at a party with Marilyn. Jardine later commented, &quot;The title of that album is really &quot;The Beach Boys Love Brian&quot;.&quot; The dedication continues,
 
Dean Torrence designed the cover illustration, which was intended to resemble a Navajo rug, and had suggested titling the album &quot;Cowabunga&quot;, inspired by Chief Thunderball&#x27;s catch-phrase on the children&#x27;s television show &quot;Howdy Doody&quot;. According to Dillon, the cover &quot;inadvertently suggests a Lite-Brite toy, which suits the childlike wonder of the record&#x27;s contents.&quot;

Jardine had an unfavorable opinion of the design: &quot;[I]t&#x27;s a shame that the [&quot;Love You&quot;] album cover is so crummy. Everything about that thing is home made. I think they [Warner Bros.] thought it was our last album. They didn&#x27;t spend a penny on the album because they knew that we weren&#x27;t coming back. They used real cheap cardboard on it.&quot; Torrence contended that expensive paper was used to simulate the record sleeve&#x27;s stitched texture.

==Release==
On November 27, 1976, Wilson appeared as the featured musical guest on &quot;NBC&#x27;s Saturday Night&quot;, during which he performed &quot;Love Is a Woman&quot;, &quot;Back Home&quot;, and &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;. It was his first solo television appearance since 1967&#x27;s &quot;Inside Pop: The Rock Revolution&quot;. Producer Lorne Michaels had insisted that Wilson appear without his bandmates, who were playing their third night of sold-out concerts at nearby Madison Square Garden. Another solo appearance on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;, which included an interview with Wilson about his past drug use, was filmed days earlier, but was not broadcast until December 8. On December 31, the band played a fifteenth anniversary celebration concert at the Los Angeles Forum, a performance that included &quot;Airplane&quot;. 
By 1977, the media hype ahead of the &quot;Brian&#x27;s Back&quot; campaign from the previous year had dissipated. As &quot;Love You&quot; approached completion, band manager Stephen Love had arranged negotiations for the group to change labels with CBS Records once they had fulfilled their contractual obligations to Warner Bros. Gaines writes, &quot;Warner Brothers knew of the CBS deal by January 1977... Warner was so disgusted with the Beach Boys at this point that the group members were convinced the company was doing very little to promote the album.&quot;

&quot;The Beach Boys Love You&quot; was released on April 11 and peaked at number 53 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart during a seven-week stay. One single, &quot;Honkin&#x27; Down the Highway&quot;, was issued several weeks later with no chart showing. Members of the group, including Mike Love, attributed the album&#x27;s poor sales to Warner&#x27;s lackluster promotional efforts. Gaines countered that, despite what the group thought of the company, &quot;the best promotional campaign in the world couldn&#x27;t have helped &quot;The Beach Boys Love You&quot;&quot;.

==Contemporary reactions==
&quot;Love You&quot; was met with polarized reactions from the public. Schinder cited a &quot;sharp divide&quot; between fans and critics, some of whom saw the album as a work of &quot;eccentric genius&quot; whereas others &quot;dismissed it as childish and trivial&quot;. However, the reactions from record reviewers were generally positive. In his 1978 biography of the band, John Tobler wrote that &quot;Love You&quot; was &quot;in the author&#x27;s estimation and that of several critics... the best released by the group since the &#x27;60s.&quot; Some listeners viewed the album as a near-punk rock statement, as well as a subversion of the well-worn trends in popular music of that era. Patti Smith, herself known as the &quot;godmother of punk&quot;, submitted a review in &quot;Hit Parader&quot; that was written in the form of a poem. 

Favorable reviews were penned by numerous esteemed critics, including &quot;Circus&quot;″ Lester Bangs, &quot;Creem&quot;″s Mitchell Cohen, &quot;NME&quot;″s Nick Kent, &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Robert Christgau, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Billy Altman. Bangs said it was the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;best album ever&quot; and described them affectionately as a &quot;diseased bunch of motherfuckers&quot; who exhibit &quot;a beauty so awesome that listening to them at their best is like being in some vast dream cathedral decorated with a thousand gleaming American pop culture icons.&quot; Altham called the album a &quot;flawed but enjoyable&quot; comeback for Wilson, who delivered the finest compositions he had written in &quot;the past few years&quot;, albeit without &quot;singing as well as he used to&quot;. &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s reviewer decreed, &quot;This album can appear insubstantial on early acquaintance, but further attention yields many riches.&quot;

Casual listeners generally found the album&#x27;s idiosyncrasies to be a detriment, and a contingent of the group&#x27;s fanbase took issue with the production style and rough vocals. Peter Ames Carlin, then a junior high school student who had eagerly anticipated the album&#x27;s release, recalled of his reaction, &quot;This was his big return — all original songs; a complete Brian production. And you listen to it and you were like, ″&quot;What the hell is this&quot;?&#x27; It&#x27;s so different.&quot; Wilson himself reviewed the album in the May 1977 issue of &quot;Crawdaddy!&quot;. His conclusions: &quot;I like the new album better than the last one... It&#x27;s a cleaner album; the tracks and the songs seem to come off cleaner.&quot;

One of the few negative reviews of the album, written by Michael Tearson, was published in David Leaf&#x27;s fanzine &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. In another negative review, by a writer for &quot;Audio&quot;, the album was named &quot;a real disappointment... patronizing and disastrous, the kind of record to get out of a contract with. And that they have done.&quot; The writer accused other critics of writing inauthentic positive feedback toward the album, and praised Tearson for being &quot;the only record reviewer who &quot;told it like it is&quot;. It took guts.&quot;

==Cancelled follow-up and aftermath==
Early in 1977, Wilson completed a follow-up album, &quot;Adult/Child&quot;, but its release was vetoed by his bandmates, partly because of the poor sales of &quot;Love You&quot;. He did not write and produce another LP until his first solo album, &quot;Brian Wilson&quot; (1988), and, according to Carlin, would not compose material that represented his true musical, emotional, and intellectual interests to the same degree until the aborted Andy Paley sessions from the 1990s. 

&quot;Love You&quot; marked the last Beach Boys album in which Wilson actively led its production. Critic Erik Kempke writes that it &quot;stands in sharp contrast to the albums that preceded and followed it, because it was a product of genuine inspiration on Brian Wilson&#x27;s part, with little outside interference.&quot; Matijas-Mecca characterized Wilson, embittered by the band&#x27;s lack of support for his new music, as choosing &quot;the path of least, or no, resistance when working with the Beach Boys&quot; for the next several decades.

Among the band members, Brian later referred to &quot;Love You&quot; as his favorite Beach Boys album on repeated occasions, explaining in a 1998 interview, &quot;That&#x27;s when it all happened for me. That&#x27;s where my heart lies. &quot;Love You&quot;, Jesus, that&#x27;s the best album we ever made.&quot; In a 2000 interview, he said, &quot;My favorites are &#x27;I Wanna Pick You Up&#x27; and &#x27;Ding Dang&#x27;... One of the shortest records we have ever made.&quot; Asked in 2009 for the records in his catalog that he felt had been underrated, he listed &quot;Love You&quot; and the tracks &quot;Ding Dang&quot;, &quot;Johnny Carson&quot;, &quot;The Night Was So Young&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ll Bet He&#x27;s Nice&quot;. Mike Love commented in his 2016 memoir that the album was &quot;undeniably original but fragmented and just plain odd&quot;. In a 2013 interview, Al Jardine expressed enthusiasm for performing the entire &quot;Love You&quot; album in concert, going on to note, &quot;those are some of the best songs we ever did.&quot;

==Retrospective assessments==

In the decades since its release, &quot;Love You&quot; has remained divisive among fans. It has developed a cult following, and it is regarded by some as one of the band&#x27;s best albums. Writing in his 2017 book &quot;The Words and Music of Brian Wilson&quot;, Christian Matijas-Mecca called it &quot;extraordinary in its sheer originality and its rejection of contemporary trends in popular music&quot;, likening it to &quot;the &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; of 1977&quot;. Matijas-Mecca added that &quot;Love You&quot; was &quot;the most unexpected album&quot; of 1977 and unlike anything else released that year, concluding that it &quot;remains as surprising and refreshing today as it did upon its original release.&quot; AllMusic reviewer John Bush praised the album and believed that &quot;The Night Was So Young,&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ll Bet He&#x27;s Nice,&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Put Our Hearts Together&quot; form a suite during side two that possesses a breadth of emotional attachment to rival &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;.

&quot;Musician&quot; magazine&#x27;s Geoffrey Himes wrote in 1981: &quot;In the bargain bins [the album] collected dust. That 1977 release is Brian Wilson&#x27;s most ambitious and successful work of the decade. It ranks with Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;Tusk&quot;, Steely Dan&#x27;s &quot;Katy Lied&quot;, and Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Zuma&quot; as the best California rock albums of the decade.&quot; Referring to &quot;naysayers&quot; of &quot;Love You&quot;, the underground fanzine &quot;Scram&quot; wrote &quot;fuck [them]... [the album showcases] a truly original mix of humor and sadness. The original numbers always dance just a step away from the cliché, dealing with simple lyrical themes that make you wonder why they had never been explored before.&quot; &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Keith Phipps relented: &quot;there&#x27;s something not-quite-right about men on the cusp of middle age hungering after a &#x27;roller-skating child&#x27;—but its failure reveals a touching vulnerability beneath the sunny good-times image of an American institution&quot;, going on to say that &quot;more often than not, &quot;Love You&quot; has a winning, human directness.&quot;

In 2023, &quot;Love You&quot; was ranked number 26 in &quot;Paste&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the greatest synth-pop albums in history. Contributor Matthew Mitchell pointed to &quot;I&#x27;ll Bet He&#x27;s Nice&quot;, &quot;The Night Was So Young&quot;, and &quot;Roller Skating Child&quot; as among the band&#x27;s &quot;purest compositions&quot;.

==Influence==
According to Dillon, &quot;Love You&quot; is considered to have influenced the development of new wave, while Clay Patrick McBride of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that Wilson &quot;helped invent synth-pop&quot; with the album. Journalist Adam Theisan wrote that the album&#x27;s &quot;prescience&quot; is one of its striking elements, having anticipated &quot;new wave experiments, arty bands like Talking Heads and synth-pop in general years before they hit the mainstream.&quot; Wilson remarked in a 2000 interview, &quot;It&#x27;s funny because now people are beginning to see that album as a classic – it was quite revolutionary in its use of synthesizers.&quot; 

Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s Lindsey Buckingham, an admirer of the album&#x27;s arrangements, bemoaned the LP&#x27;s poor sales. Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth first discovered the Beach Boys through Patti Smith&#x27;s review of &quot;Love You&quot;. R.E.M.&#x27;s Peter Buck praised the record as &quot;a window into the heart of one of the greatest composers of the twentieth century.&quot; He named it his favorite Beach Boys album. Producer Alan Boyd opined, &quot;It&#x27;s a fascinating record. I&#x27;ve never heard a record before or since that sounded like it. It&#x27;s got its own sonic texture that no one has ever tried to do before... Some of those songs and chord progressions are among the richest and the deepest that Brian ever did.&quot;

Alex Chilton recorded a cover of &quot;Solar System&quot; that was included on his &quot;Electricity by Candlelight&quot; (2013), and he contributed his version of &quot;I Wanna Pick You Up&quot; to the multi-artist tribute album &quot;Caroline Now!&quot; (2000). Other songs covered in the compilation were &quot;Honkin&#x27; Down the Highway&quot; (Radio Sweethearts), &quot;Good Time&quot; (Stevie Jackson of Belle and Sebastian), and &quot;Let&#x27;s Put Our Hearts Together&quot; (duet between Chip Taylor and Evie Sands). In 1997, Darian Sahanaja released a cover of &quot;I Wanna Pick You Up&quot; as a single. Yo La Tengo&#x27;s live rendition of &quot;Ding Dang&quot; was released on the 2006 compilation &quot;Yo La Tengo Is Murdering the Classics&quot;.

<text>MUSC Health Stadium was a soccer-specific stadium located in the Daniel Island area of Charleston, South Carolina that served as the home of the Charleston Battery of the USL Championship.

Originally named &quot;Blackbaud Stadium&quot;, the stadium was opened in 1999. At the time, Blackbaud was the first modern-era stadium in the United States designed for specifically soccer, as Columbus Crew Stadium opened after Blackbaud later that the same year. The stadium was originally named after Blackbaud, a software company founded by Battery majority owner Tony Bakker. The company&#x27;s headquarters were adjacent to the stadium.

The stadium seated 5,100 people, mostly in two large stands on either side of the field. The stadium is modeled after lower-division English soccer stadiums and featured an on-site pub, called &quot;The Three Lions&quot;.

The stadium regularly hosted sporting events besides Battery matches, including United States women&#x27;s national soccer team soccer, and United States national rugby union team matches. The stadium also hosts concerts and other festivals, including several editions of the Southern Ground Music and Food Festival headlined by the Zac Brown Band.

In early 2008, the Battery announced a plan to convert much of the stadium to solar energy. The panels could offset up to 12 tons of carbon dioxide per year.

On July 30, 2015, the Battery sold naming rights for the stadium to the Medical University of South Carolina through 2019, in an expansion of a partnership between the university&#x27;s hospital system and the team.

In August 2018, the stadium hosted the Major League Lacrosse league championship game. It was the first MLL game held in South Carolina.

The Southern Ground Music and Food Festival was hosted in 2011: Zac Brown Band, Clay Cook, Eric Church, Warren Haynes, Blue Dogs (from Charleston), Moon Taxi, My Morning Jacket, Train, and Fitz and the Tantrums. In 2012, the festival had: Gregg Allman Band, The Avett Brothers, Charlie Daniels Band, Grace Potter &amp; the Nocturnals, and Michael Franti &amp; Spearhead. In 2013, the festival had Band of Horses, Jason Mraz, Willie Nelson, and Kenny Rogers. In 2016, it had Thomas Rhett, A Thousand Horses, Kacey Musgraves, The Marshall Tucker Band (from Spartanburg), and Bruce Hornsby. Zac Brown Band played at the festival every year from 2011–2016.

On May 29, 2019, MUSC Health Stadium was sold to an affiliate of Atlanta-based Holder Properties Inc for $6.475 million. After the 2019 USL Championship season, the stadium was demolished to make way for commercial redevelopment. The final Battery game at the stadium took place on October 19, 2019 against Bethlehem Steel FC.

<doc id="807258" wikidata="Q1139999" url="?curid=807258" title="La Fée aux Choux">
<text>The 1896 version of La Fée aux Choux (The Fairy of the Cabbages) is a lost short fantasy film directed by Alice Guy-Blaché (then known as Alice Guy) that, according to her, featured a honeymoon couple, a farmer, pictures of babies glued to cardboard, and one live baby. The 1900 &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot; and the 1902 &quot;Sage-Femme de Première Classe&quot; (originally titled &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot;) are frequently confused with the original lost film, which is arguably the world&#x27;s first narrative film, and the first film directed by a woman.

Alice Guy-Blaché reported that she had to remake the film at least twice and this accounts for the two films dated 1900 and 1902 that are available to view online. Guy-Blaché&#x27;s 1900 version employed one actress (the fairy), two live babies, and a number of dolls. Her 1902 version, later retitled &quot;Sage-femme de première classe&quot; (&quot;Midwife First Class&quot;, which refers to a diploma for a mid-wife, not the class she caters to), employed a honeymoon couple and a female baby merchant along with numerous babies and dolls. In a still photograph from the 1902 version, Guy-Blaché appears, wearing a &quot;costume of Normandy&quot;. She does not play the husband in the film, but said that she &quot;for fun pulled on the peasant clothes&quot; for the photograph.

There has been a hundred years of controversy over &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot;, starting in 1922, when Étienne Arnaud wrote in his memoirs that Alice Guy was the “first to have the idea of staging a dramatic scene in front of the cinematographic lens.” He wrote that the film was &quot;Les Mefaits d’une Tête de Veau&quot;, creating more controversy and confusion. Léon Gaumont cemented the confusion when he reportedly said in 1935 that he himself directed the first film that was “trying to tell a story to the audience,” in front of “a painted canvas that naively represented the rue de Belleville. His feminine star was Alice Guy, and two mechanics from the studio were the first screen actors.” He also claimed his “first” film was called &quot;Les Mefaits d’une Tête de Veau&quot;.

In the evidence that has been coming in piecemeal for over a century, there are multiple points of confirmation that there were three &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot; and that the first was filmed in the spring and early summer of 1896.

== The Original Scenario ==
The scenario Alice Guy wrote for her first film begins with “a pair of newlyweds” walking in the fields during their honeymoon. “They come upon a field of cabbages where a farmer is working.” Then “the young man leans into the ear of his young wife and asks if she would like a baby. She agrees, lowering her eyes…the young man asks permission of the farmer,” who gives the couple permission to search his field. 
The young husband discovers a baby made of cardboard, but both he and his bride are disappointed in it. Then the young bride “hears a cooing behind a more distant cabbage. She runs and discovers a beautiful, live baby and brings it in triumph to her husband.” After compensating the farmer, the newlyweds “leave excitedly” while the farmer returns to his field with a shrug.

This scenario has no fairy which has caused some confusion. Alice Guy explained in her memoirs: &quot;As actors, my friends, a screaming baby, an anxious mother leaping to and fro into the field of focus, and my first film, &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot;, was born.” 
Since that one-minute length of film cost as much as Alice’s salary for a week, she apparently decided not to reshoot after the mother jumped in. Since fairies do not like to be seen by mortal eyes, the leaping mother was a happy accident. 
Those in the audience who saw the 1896 original were charmed by the leaping mother who had appeared only for a few seconds at the end. Following this, the 1900 version is all about the fairy, dovetailing perfectly with the 1896 version and carrying forward the pleasant fantasy.

==The 1896 Baby Incubator Exposition==

In February 1896, on the boulevard Poissonnière leading to the cabarets of Montmartre, Dr. Alexandre Lion opened an exposition, a “boutique fully operational,” of baby incubators, filled with live, premature infants. The baby incubator was a new invention, modeled after chicken incubators, serving to keep the babies warm. An art nouveau poster was designed by Adolfo Hohenstein to advertise the Paris Couveuses d’Enfants. A nurse holding three babies is framed by a vine sprouting baby’s heads in place of flowers. Faint white lines—drawings of babies growing on vines—fill in the background.
Alice Guy went to this exposition and saw the babies in their enclosures. She later told her granddaughter, Regine Blaché-Bolton, that she was inspired to create &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot; because she had seen the babies in the glass and metal boxes at an exposition.

== Other Theories ==
Cited sometimes is the theory that other people, namely Georges Hatot (or perhaps some camera men at Gaumont), could have directed the 1896 or the 1900 &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot;. 
During an interview with the Cinémathèque Française in 1948, Georges Hatot was asked an imprecise question about “the first films at Gaumont.” When Georges Hatot answered, he was talking about the films he directed as an independent contractor for Gaumont in the summer of 1898. 
Léon Gaumont hired the director Georges Hatot and the actor Gaston Breteau in early 1898 to increase Gaumont’s catalogue of offerings. Hatot and Breteau economized on their productions for Gaumont by recycling the backdrops, props, and costumes they had used for the Lumière brothers in the 1897 series of films, &quot;La Vie du Christ&quot;. When Léon Gaumont discovered what they had done, he felt short-changed.
Georges Hatot described his final confrontation with Léon Gaumont and Alice Guy in the fall of 1898:

“I made the &quot;Passion&quot; for Gaumont. I gave him six pictures and then we broke the contract. We broke the contract because I made a cutting remark to Mademoiselle Alice. She already wanted to busy herself with anything that was disputed. It pissed me off. And in a gesture of impatience, I said to her, ‘Don&#x27;t you have any socks to darn?’&quot; “Gaumont turned red,” Hatot observed. “He said to himself, ‘He&#x27;s a guy I need to get rid of’…. I never went to Gaumont again.” 
Léon Gaumont rescinded his contract with Georges Hatot and Gaston Breteau in the fall of 1898. 
By then, Alice Guy had been employed by L. Gaumont et Cie for over four years. Her busying “herself with anything that was disputed” suggests she was already defending her own position. As she said, “I had a hard time keeping my job.”

Since Hatot said he only made six pictures for Gaumont and then never went back after this confrontation in the fall of 1898, it is not possible that Georges Hatot directed the 1900 &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot;. Neither is it possible that he directed the original &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot; in 1896 since he got his start later, in 1897. He was only 20 years old in 1896, three years younger than Alice Guy, and was doing his military service that year. More important, he never claimed that &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot; was his work. He never demonstrated personal knowledge of any such film. 
Since Alice Guy described her first version of &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot; in 1939 long before any version of it was identified in any of the film archives or surviving catalogues, there is no justification for attributing it to Georges Hatot or to anyone else.

== The Photograph ==
There is a photo of Alice Guy standing between Yvonne and Germaine Sérand. 
“In the photo of &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot;,” Alice writes, “are my friends, Germaine and Yvonne Sérand…and myself.” Yvonne played the fairy in the 1900 version; both Yvonne and Germaine played in the 1902 &quot;Sage-femme&quot;. Since Alice Guy called this photo &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot;, there has been some confusion because the painted scene behind the three women is from &quot;Sage-femme&quot;.

Alice Guy claimed that she would never even have used the words &quot;Sage-femme&quot;.
The newspapers of 1902 and 1903 support her claim. &quot;Sage-femme&quot; was titled &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot; when it was released in December 1902. The title change came later in the September 1903 catalogue. 
Before the 1900 version of &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot; was discovered by Alison McMahan in a Swedish archive in 1996, this photo was the basis for the theory that the 1902 &quot;Sage-femme&quot; was Alice Guy’s debut film.
The 1900 &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot;, with a single character, challenged this assumption. It is also hard to argue that the 1900 &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot; is a copy of Alice Guy’s first film because it doesn’t match her description either. It has no cardboard babies, no farmer, and its backdrop, which Alice Guy said “shivered in the wind,” is secured by the fence standing on its lower edge.

Since Alice Guy reported that her 1896 &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot; had to be remade at least twice, the most straight-forward explanation is that there was a third film that came first, and that the 1900 and 1902 versions are the remakes. Since all three films are apparently different, we should probably call them a series.

== What Happened After ==
Alice Guy repeatedly recounted that she was put in charge of production in 1897 after the success of the 1896 &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot;. She writes that Léon Gaumont remodeled a residence for her on his property in Belleville to induce her to move six miles away from her delightful apartment on Quai Malaquais, about a mile from the Gaumont office. 
The City of Paris records Alice Guy’s residence at Quai Malaquais from 1896 to 1898. She said she moved from there to Belleville. In February 1897, Léon Gaumont obtained a permit to remodel 14, rue Alouettes, “pavilion pour concierge,” for an employee or caretaker of the property. Thus, two government records support Alice Guy’s accounts.

== &quot;Sage-femme de Première Classe&quot; ==

&quot;Sage-femme de Première Classe&quot; is pointed to by some archivists and historians as Alice Guy&#x27;s first film, but &quot;Sage-femme&quot; doesn&#x27;t correspond to her descriptions. There are three characters in &quot;Sage-femme&quot;, but four characters in Alice&#x27;s descriptions of the 1896 &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot;, including a couple, a male farmer, children in costume, and a mother who &quot;leaped into the field of focus.&quot;
Alice Guy said she couldn’t &quot;remember the name of the man who played the farmer&quot; in the 1896 &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot;. But there are no male players in either &quot;Sage-femme&quot; or the 1900 &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot;.

== The Fan ==
Alice Guy reported that the backdrop for her 1896 original &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot; was painted by a ladies’ fan-painter.
Pamela Green’s research for &quot;Be Natural, The Untold Story of Alice Guy-Blaché&quot;, turned up a hand-painted ladies’ fan that was given to Alice Guy as a gift. It was signed by René Sérand (Yvonne Mugnier-Sérand’s older brother). The painting on the fan looks like René Sérand painted it to commemorate the 1896 &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot;. A woman, her arms in the air, is surrounded by little ones. A young woman approaches her from the right. This painting fits the descriptions Alice Guy gave for her first film: “We got the kids all dressed up,” “the mother leaped into the field of focus,” and the bride “ran to a distant part of the cabbage field.”

== 58 Millimeter ==
Neither the 1900 nor the 1902 version has a bride running to a “distant part of the cabbage field” or a woman jumping into the field of focus. The words “running” and “distant” suggest the 1896 version was shot on a larger format film, such as the 58-millimeter which allowed for a scene in wide-screen.

== The Catalogues ==
There are three Gaumont catalogue entries that correspond to 1) Alice Guy’s 1896 descriptions, 2) the 1900 version of &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot;, and 3) the 1902 &quot;Sage-Femme&quot;. The first entry Alice Guy supplied to Victor Bachy and fits the 1896 version, but doesn’t fit either the 1900 or 1902 remake:

“A loving couple walks through a vegetable garden in search of a baby. A fairy deposits live babies which she then removes from the cabbages to the delight of the young couple who are overjoyed.”

This catalogue that Alice Guy had in her possession appears to be lost because the earliest description we have is from the 1901 Gaumont catalogue which carries the following description and fits the 1900 version:

“A fairy deposits live babies which she then removes from the cabbages. Very big success.”
The text of this description appears to have been abbreviated from the previous text that Alice Guy gave to Victor Bachy. It uses the exact same words, but the phrases about the young couple are deleted.
&quot;Sage-femme&quot;, released in December 1902, got a much more detailed description, two paragraphs long, in the September 1903 Gaumont catalogue.

== Georges Sadoul and Henry Gallet ==
Henry Gallet, when he was interviewed in the mid-1940s, told Georges Sadoul that &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot; was “his first film.” Georges Sadoul misinterpreted this to mean that Henry Gallet directed &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot;. Henry Gallet, on seeing Sadoul’s error, contacted him to correct it. In a later edition, Sadoul added a footnote to the text that said Henry Gallet “was content to be the actor of the films made by Alice Guy, who claims all the Gaumont production in the early years.”
Since neither the 1900 &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot; nor the 1902 &quot;Sage-femme&quot; had any male actors, only the 1896 version can fulfill this specific detail. Henry Gallet lived near the Gaumont property at his parents’ house until at least 1900, and was only 19 in 1896. He most likely played the young husband.

== The Subtitle ==
There are only two or three films before 1900 in the Gaumont catalogue that have a subtitle. &quot;La Fee aux Choux ou La Naissance des Enfants&quot; in 1900 is one of them. 
The Lumière films that were shown on December 28, 1895, and in the months that followed, took their titles from the action in the film: &quot;Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat&quot;, &quot;Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory&quot;, etc. These titles were purely descriptive. There was no artistic consideration given to the titles of the earliest films. Alice Guy likely followed this pattern, giving her first film a descriptive title such as &quot;La Naissance des Enfants&quot;, and then she added an artistic title for the 1900 version, and kept the earlier title as a subtitle because it referred to the first version.

== Gil Blas, July 30, 1896 ==
There is a reference in an 1896 newspaper that refers to a “chaste fiction of children born under the cabbages in a wonderfully framed chromo landscape” that requires explanation.

== The Backdrop ==
Photographic evidence of the 1896 &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot; can be found in seven extant Gaumont films. When the painted panels from these films are put together, the size of the backdrop, at least 40 feet long, indicates it was painted for a larger format film such as the 58-millimeter that was used at Gaumont only in 1896 and the first half of 1897. Portions from the 1896 backdrop appear in both the 1900 &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot; and behind the door in &quot;Sage-femme&quot;.

Some of the panels connect along their edges and some are connected by specifics in the painting. One of the witnesses of the painted backdrop said it was used for &quot;Les Mefaits d’une Tête de Veau&quot;. Based on the figures of the Normandy wedding in the painting, it was used for &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot; first.

== Pop Culture ==
&quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot; inspired the children&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Rabbit&#x27;s Gift&quot;, written by Jessica Vitalis and published by Greenwillow/HarperCollins on October 25, 2022. In the story, human babies are grown in cabbage-like plants called Chou and delivered to humans by rabbits in exchange for the purple carrots the rabbits need to survive.

<text>&quot;Christmas Is Coming&quot; is a traditional nursery rhyme and Christmas song frequently sung as a round. It is listed as number 12817 in the Roud Folk Song Index.

== Lyrics ==
The following are common representative lyrics: 
:Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat
:Please [do] put a penny in the old man&#x27;s hat
:If you haven&#x27;t got a penny, [then] a ha&#x27;penny will do
:If you haven&#x27;t got a ha&#x27;penny, [then] God bless you!

Although the lyrics begin appearing in print in 1885 and 1886, they are presented without an author and in a way of cataloging something that was already mostly common knowledge of the time. Some sources have variants of these lyrics and additional verses. 

== Music ==
The common melody paired with the lyrics is usually simply listed as a traditional English carol, while some sources curiously list the author Edith Nesbit Bland as its composer.

Another common melody, usually listed as a traditional English carol, is differentiated by an arrangement of it made by Walford Davies, published in 1914. The lyrics have also been paired with the melody of the English dance tune &quot;Country Gardens&quot;. 

== Traditional collected versions ==
A few field recordings were made of traditional versions of the song, including one sung by Jack Elliot of Birtley, Durham to Reg Hall in the early 1960s, which is archived within the British Library Sound Archive.

==Popular recordings==
The Kingston Trio recorded the song as &quot;A Round About Christmas&quot;, on their album &quot;The Last Month of the Year&quot; released in 1960. A calypso sounding version was featured on the 1979 album &quot;John Denver and the Muppets: A Christmas Together&quot; and a loose, jazzy piano-based arrangement was featured in the musical score of &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;.

The rhyme also became the basis for the song &quot;Christmas Is a-Comin&#x27;&quot;, written by Frank Luther and performed by Bing Crosby, among others.

<text>The Vindhya Range (also known as Vindhyachal) () is a complex, discontinuous chain of mountain ridges, hill ranges, highlands and plateau escarpments in west-central India.

Technically, the Vindhyas do not form a single mountain range in the geological sense. The exact extent of the Vindhyas is loosely defined, and historically, the term covered a number of distinct hill systems in central India, including the one that is now known as the Satpura Range. Today, the term principally refers to the escarpment and its hilly extensions that runs north of and roughly parallel to the Narmada River in Madhya Pradesh. Depending on the definition, the range extends up to Gujarat in the west, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in the north, and Chhattisgarh in the east. The average elevation of the Vindhyas is also dependent on different sources.

The word Vindhya is derived from the Sanskrit word &quot;vaindh&quot; (to obstruct) and is in reference to a mythological story. The Vindhya range is also known as &quot;Vindhyachala&quot; or &quot;Vindhyachal&quot;; the suffix &quot;achala&quot; (Sanskrit) or &quot;achal&quot; (Hindi) refers to a mountain.

The Vindhyas have a great significance in Indian mythology and history. Several ancient texts mention the Vindhyas as the southern boundary of the &quot;Āryāvarta&quot;, the territory of the ancient Indo-Aryan peoples. Although today Indo-Aryan languages are also spoken south of the Vindhyas, the range continues to be considered as the traditional boundary between north and south India. The former Vindhya Pradesh was named after the Vindhya Range.

== Etymology and names ==

According to the author of a commentary on &quot;Amarakosha&quot;, the word Vindhya derives from the Sanskrit word &quot;vaindh&quot; (to obstruct). A mythological story (see below) states that the Vindhyas once obstructed the path of the sun, resulting in this name. The Ramayana states that the great mountain Vindhya that was growing incessantly and obstructing the path of the Sun stopped growing any more in obedience to Agastya&#x27;s words. According to another theory, the name &quot;Vindhya&quot; means &quot;hunter&quot; in Sanskrit, and may refer to the tribal hunter-gatherers inhabiting the region.

The Vindhya range is also known as &quot;Vindhyachala&quot; or &quot;Vindhyachal&quot;; the suffix &quot;achala&quot; (Sanskrit) or &quot;achal&quot; (Hindi) refers to a mountain. In the Mahabharata, the range is also referred to as &quot;Vindhyapadaparvata&quot;. The Greek geographer Ptolemy called the range Vindius or Ouindion, describing it as the source of Namados (Narmada) and Nanagouna (Tapti) rivers. The &quot;Daksinaparvata&quot; (&quot;Southern Mountain&quot;) mentioned in the Kaushitaki Upanishad is also identified with the Vindhyas.

== Extent ==

The Vindhyas do not form a single range in the proper geological sense: the hills collectively known as the Vindhyas do not lie along an anticlinal or synclinal ridge. The Vindhya range is actually a group of discontinuous chain of mountain ridges, hill ranges, highlands and plateau escarpments. The term &quot;Vindhyas&quot; is defined by convention, and therefore, the exact definition of the Vindhya range has varied at different times in history.

=== Historical definitions ===

Earlier, the term &quot;Vindhyas&quot; was used in a wider sense and included a number of hill ranges between the Indo-Gangetic plain and the Deccan Plateau. According to the various definitions mentioned in the older texts, the Vindhyas extend up to the Godavari in the south and the Ganges in the north.

In certain Puranas, the term Vindhya specifically covers the mountain range located between the Narmada and the Tapti rivers; that is, the one which is now known as the Satpura Range. The Varaha Purana uses the name &quot;Vindhya-pada&quot; (&quot;foot of the Vindhyas&quot;) for the Satpura range.

Several ancient Indian texts and inscriptions (e.g. the &quot;Nasik Prasasti&quot; of Gautamiputra Satakarni) mention three mountain ranges in Central India: Vindhya (or &quot;Vindhya proper&quot;), Rksa (also Rksavat or Riksha) and Pariyatra (or Paripatra). The three ranges are included in the seven &quot;Kula Parvatas&quot; (&quot;clan mountains&quot;) of Bharatavarsha, that is, India. The exact identification of these three ranges is difficult due to contrasting descriptions in the various texts. For example, the Kurma, Matsya and Brahmanda Puranas mention Vindhya as the source of Tapti; while Vishnu and Brahma Puranas mention the Rksa as its source. Some texts use the term Vindhyas to describe all the hills in Central India.

In one passage, Valmiki&#x27;s Ramayana describes Vindhya as being situated to the south of Kishkindha (Ramayana IV-46. 17), which is identified with a part of the present-day Karnataka. It further implies that the sea was located just to the south of the Vindhyas, and Lanka was located across this sea. Many scholars have attempted to explain this anomaly in different ways. According to one theory, the term &quot;Vindhyas&quot; covered a number of mountains to the south of the Indo-Aryan territories at the time Ramayana was written. Others, such as Frederick Eden Pargiter, believe that there was another mountain in South India, with the same name. Madhav Vinayak Kibe placed the location of Lanka in Central India.

The Barabar Cave inscription of the Maukhari ruler Anantavarman mentions the Nagarjuni hill of Bihar as a part of the Vindhyas.

=== Present-day definition ===

Today, the definition of the Vindhyas is primarily restricted to the Central Indian escarpments, hills and highlands located to the north of the Narmada River. Some of these are actually distinct hill systems.

The western end of the Vindhya range is located in the state of Gujarat, near the state&#x27;s border with Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, at the eastern side of the Kathiawar peninsula. A series of hills connects the Vindhya extension to the Aravalli Range near Champaner. The Vindhya range rises in height east of Chhota Udaipur.

The principal Vindhya range forms the southern escarpment of the Central Indian upland. It runs roughly parallel to the Naramada river in the east-west direction, forming the southern wall of the Malwa plateau in Madhya Pradesh.

The eastern portion of the Vindhyas comprises multiple chains, as the range divides into branches east of Malwa. A southern chain of Vindhyas runs between the upper reaches of the Son and Narmada rivers to meet the Satpura Range in the Maikal Hills near Amarkantak. A northern chain of the Vindhyas continues eastwards as Bhander Plateau and Kaimur Range, which runs north of the Son River. This extended range runs through what was once Vindhya Pradesh, reaching up to the Kaimur district of Bihar. The branch of the Vindhya range spanning across Bundelkhand is known as the Panna range. Another northern extension (known as the Vindhyachal hills) runs up to Uttar Pradesh, stopping before the shores of Ganga at multiple places, including Vindhyachal and Chunar (Mirzapur District), near Varanasi.

The Vindhyan tableland is a plateau that lies to the north of the central part of the range. The Rewa-Panna plateaus are also collectively known as the Vindhya plateau.

== Elevation ==

Different sources vary on the average elevation of the Vindhyas, depending on their definition of the range. M. C. Chaturvedi mentions the average elevation as . Pradeep Sharma states that the &quot;general elevation&quot; of the Vindhyas is , with the range rarely going over during its extent.

The highest point of the Vindhyas is the Sad-bhawna Shikhar (&quot;Goodwill Peak&quot;), which lies above the sea level. Also known as the Kalumar peak or Kalumbe peak, it lies near Singrampur in the Damoh district, in the area known as Bhanrer or Panna hills. Historical texts include Amarkantak (+) in the Vindhyas, but today, it is considered a part of the Maikal Range, which is considered as an extension of the Satpuras.

== Cultural significance ==
The Vindhyas are regarded as the traditional geographical boundary between northern and southern India, and have a distinguished status in both mythology and geography of India. In the ancient Indian texts, the Vindhyas are seen as the demarcating line between the territories of the Indo-Aryans and that of the others. The most ancient Hindu texts consider it as the southern boundary of Aryavarta. The Mahabharata mentions that the Nishadas and other Mleccha tribes reside in the forests of the Vindhyas. Although the Indo-Aryan languages (such as Marathi and Konkani) spread to the south of Vindhyas later, the Vindhyas continued to be seen as the traditional boundary between the north and the south of India.

Vindhyas appear prominently in the Indian mythological tales. Although the Vindhyas are not very high, historically, they were considered highly inaccessible and dangerous due to dense vegetation and the hostile tribes residing there. In the older Sanskrit texts, such as the Ramayana, they are described as the unknown territory infested with cannibals and demons. The later texts describe the Vindhya range as the residence of fierce form of Shakti (goddess Kali or Durga), who has lived there since slaying the demons. She is described as Vindhyavasini (&quot;Vindhya dweller&quot;), and a temple dedicated to her is located in the Vindhyachal town of Uttar Pradesh. The Mahabharata mentions the Vindhyas as the &quot;eternal abode&quot; of Kali.

According to one legend, the Vindhya mountain once competed with the Mount Meru, growing so high that it obstructed the sun. The sage Agastya then asked Vindhya to lower itself, in order to facilitate his passage across to the south. In reverence for Agastya, the Vindhya lowered its height and promised not to grow until Agastya returned to the north. Agastya settled in the south, and the Vindhya mountain, true to its word, never grew further.

The Kishkindha Kanda of Valmiki&#x27;s Ramayana mentions that Maya built a mansion in the Vindhyas. In &quot;Dashakumaracharita&quot;, the King Rajahamsa of Magadha and his ministers create a new colony in the Vindhya forest, after being forced out of their kingdom following a war defeat.
The Vindhyas are one of the only two mountain ranges mentioned in the national anthem of India, the other being the Himalayas.

== Rivers ==

Several tributaries of the Ganga-Yamuna system originate from the Vindhyas. These include Chambal, Betwa, Dhasan,Sunar, Ken, Tamsa, Kali Sindh and Parbati. The northern slopes of the Vindhyas are drained by these rivers.

Narmada and Son rivers drain the southern slopes of the Vindhyas. Both these rivers rise in the Maikal hills, which are now defined as an extension of the Satpuras, although several older texts use the term Vindhyas to cover them (see Historical definitions above).

== Geology and palaeontology ==
The &quot;Vindhyan Supergroup&quot; is one of the largest and thickest sedimentary successions in the world.

The earliest known multicellular fossils of eukaryotes (filamentous algae) have been discovered from Vindhya basin dating back to 1.6 to 1.7 billion years ago. Shelled creatures are documented to have first evolved at the start of the Cambrian &#x27;explosion of life&#x27;, about 550 million years ago.

<text>The Devon Wildlife Trust is a member of The Wildlife Trusts partnership covering the county of Devon, England. It is a registered charity, established in 1961 as the Devon Naturalists Trust, and its aim is to safeguard the future of the county&#x27;s urban, rural and marine wildlife and its environment.

==The trust==
Twenty percent of Devon is unspoilt wildlife habitat, and the county contains all or part of two national parks (Dartmoor and Exmoor), one UNESCO biosphere reserve (North Devon Biosphere Reserve), five Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (Blackdown Hills, East Devon, North Devon Coast, South Devon and the Tamar Valley) and part of the Jurassic Coast, the only natural World Heritage Site in England. Devon Wildlife Trust campaigns on a number of regional and national wildlife issues, and also looks after some 58 nature reserves including Sites of Special Scientific Interest such as Bystock, Dawlish Warren, Bovey Heath, Chudleigh Knighton Heath, and Dunsford.

The trust has about 37,000 members which help fund its work and it is aided by around 300 volunteers which help with running local groups and habitat management work on the charity&#x27;s nature reserves. There are also some 100 full-time staff working for the Trust.

The Trust&#x27;s headquarters and visitor centre is located at the historic Cricklepit Mill in Exeter. The building features a working 19th-century water-powered flour mill and displays information about the Trust&#x27;s reserves and activities. Outside is a wildlife garden, an oasis of calm in the middle of the city. The Trust&#x27;s other visitor centre is Wembury Marine Centre on the coast in Wembury. The trust also manages Woodah Farm, near Doddiscombsleigh, which is situated in a wildlife reserve and provides groups with research facilities.

<text>Somerset Wildlife Trust (SWT) is a wildlife trust covering the county of Somerset, England.

The trust, which was established in 1964, aims to safeguard the county&#x27;s wildlife and wild places for this and future generations and manages almost 80 nature reserves. Examples include Westhay Moor, Long Wood and Langford Heathfield. It has over 20,500 members and 500 volunteers.

The Somerset Wildlife Trust is part of the Wildlife Trusts partnership of 46 wildlife trusts in the United Kingdom.

In 2010 the organisation won a Biffa Award for their &quot;Restoring Habitat for Dormice in Somerset&quot; scheme.

In 2011 the Trust appealed for £100,000 from local residents and businesses to restore former peat diggings on the Somerset Levels.

<text>Wiltshire Wildlife Trust is a conservation charity based in Devizes, England which owns and manages 40 nature reserves in Wiltshire and Swindon. It also works to encourage Wiltshire&#x27;s communities to live sustainable lifestyles that protect the environment.

It is one of 46 Wildlife Trusts across the United Kingdom, which together form the largest voluntary organisation dedicated to protecting wildlife and wild places everywhere – at land and at sea.

It issues a variety of publications including a members magazine, Wiltshire Wildlife. Its digital presence includes social networking, such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and LinkedIn.

==History==
Formed in 1962 as The Wiltshire Trust for Nature Conservation Ltd, with just seven members contributing £1 per year, the trust was incorporated under the Companies Act on 23 July 1962. Involved in the creation of the trust was acclaimed author and poet John Buxton. The inaugural meeting was held at County Hall, Trowbridge with some 160 people attending.

The trust began creating nature reserves in 1963 with the purchase of Blackmoor Copse. Within a decade, the trust owned nine more reserves, had received its first legacy gift and membership had grown to 800. As it reached its 20th anniversary, the trust owned 30 nature reserves and had 2,000 members. In 1989, the first Sarsen Trail &amp; Neolithic Marathon was held, raising £21,500 which was used to buy Morgan&#x27;s Hill nature reserve.

For its 30th anniversary, in 1992, the trust formally changed its name to Wiltshire Wildlife Trust. In 1994, the trust employed its first otter habitat project officer; at that time, there were no known otters in the county. In 2012, Wiltshire Wildlife Trust featured three reserves in the &quot;Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts&#x27;s Guide to Otters&quot;, a testament to the success of the project.

In its 50th year, 2012, the trust owned and managed 37 nature reserves.

As of 2022, its 60th year, the trust owns and manages over 40 nature reserves, including three farming operations, and has over 20,000 members.

==Programmes and projects==
The trust undertakes a wide variety of projects to engage local residents with its work, and to develop an understanding and love for the natural environment. As of 2022, these activities include:
* &quot;Action for Insects -&quot; increasing the biodiversity of invertebrates on its nature reserves.
* &quot;Bay Meadows&quot; - Creating a haven for nature in Marlborough.
* &quot;Braydon Forest Marsh Fritillary Project&quot; - supporting the marsh fritillary butterfly.
* &quot;Building Bridges&quot; supporting people across Swindon and Wiltshire by helping them develop skills, access education and move back into work.
* &quot;Lakeside and The Willows Care Farms&quot; offering children, young people and adults with individual needs with meaningful education and work-based experiences.
* &quot;Green Living&quot;
* &quot;Swindon Forest Meadows&quot; - A joint project with Swindon Borough Council to restore wildflower meadows.
* &quot;Wild Landscapes&quot; – the team works to create green spaces for wildlife and people.
* &quot;Well-being&quot; focuses on helping people experiencing mental health issues such as stress and depression by using nature to promote well-being.
* &quot;Unaccompanied Asylum Seeking Children&quot;
* &quot;Protecting Wiltshire&#x27;s Rivers&quot;: Wiltshire is home to a number of nationally and internationally important chalk streams, such as the Salisbury Avon. This programme operates the &quot;Wessex Chalk Streams Project&quot; which restores sections of the River Avon and its tributaries that have been affected by dredging and straightening. It recreates the natural course of the river, putting back meanders and riffles and creating habitats for threatened species such as European otter and European water vole. The &quot;Source to Sea&quot; and &quot;Wiltshire Invasive Species&quot; projects proactively seek out areas affected by invasive species, such as Himalayan balsam and Japanese knotweed, removing and disposing of these damaging non-native plants.
Wiltshire has a large military population and the trust runs community-based programmes that encourage military families to get outside and connect with nature and local residents. It is also working with the charity Help for Heroes, aiding injured service personnel to recover through carrying out conservation tasks at Tedworth House.

<doc id="807293" wikidata="Q364295" url="?curid=807293" title="Spud Webb">
<text>Anthony Jerome &quot;Spud&quot; Webb (born July 13, 1963) is an American former professional basketball player. A point guard, Webb played college basketball at Midland College and at North Carolina State University. He then played for four teams in the National Basketball Association (NBA) in a professional career that spanned from 1985 to 1998. Webb also played professional basketball in the United States Basketball League, in the Continental Basketball Association, and in Italy.

Webb is one of the shortest players in NBA history. He is known for having won the 1986 NBA Slam Dunk Contest. Webb has served as president of basketball operations for the Texas Legends, the NBA G League affiliate of the Dallas Mavericks, since 2010.

== Early years ==
Webb was born into poverty in Dallas, Texas.

He received his nickname when he was a newborn baby in the hospital and a visitor remarked to his parents that his round head resembled the Sputnik satellite. By the time he was brought home from the hospital, &quot;Sputnik&quot; had been shortened to &quot;Spud.&quot;

Webb was raised in a small two-bedroom home and saw basketball as an inspiration. Webb was not tall, but he used his quickness and jumping ability to outplay bigger kids. Starting in the seventh grade, Webb was told that he was too short to play basketball. He got a chance to play on his junior high team only after two players did not complete physical exam requirements in time for the first game. Webb scored 22 points in his first game. He could dunk the ball when he was tall. At Wilmer-Hutchins High School, he played on the junior varsity team and made a large impact; when he made the varsity team, he averaged 26 points per game as a senior.

== College career ==
=== Midland College ===
Despite his impressive high school record, Webb attracted little interest from colleges. He was recruited by North Texas Basketball Coach Bill Blakeley (who would later become his agent throughout his NBA career) but received his first opportunity to play on a college basketball team at Midland College (in Midland, Texas), where he led the Chaparrals to the junior college national title in 1982. In the championship game, Midland defeated top-ranked and previously unbeaten Miami-Dade North of Florida, 93–88, in double overtime. Webb led all scorers in with 36 points, shooting 10–15 from the floor and 16–18 from the line. His performance at the tournament earned Webb a write-up in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; and national attention. In 1983, he was named an NJCAA All-American by the National Junior College Athletic Association.

=== North Carolina State University ===
Webb was planning to transfer to North Texas to play for Bill Blakeley, but Blakeley was fired in May 1983. Webb prepared to go work with his dad at Webb&#x27;s Soul Mart near Fair Park in Dallas. Coach Blakeley reached out to his friend, Tom Abatemarco, an assistant coach at North Carolina State University, and took him to watch Webb play in a summer league game at MLK Recreation Center. Abatemarco was impressed and arranged for Webb to meet head coach Jim Valvano, who offered Webb a scholarship. In college, his vertical leap was measured at . He played for NC State in the 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons, averaging 10.4 points and 5.7 assists.

== Professional career ==

=== Atlanta Hawks (1985–1991) ===
Most scouts predicted that Webb would end up playing in either Europe or for the Harlem Globetrotters because of his height (). However, Webb was drafted in the 4th round of the 1985 NBA draft by the Detroit Pistons. After the guard-loaded Pistons released Webb before the preseason even started, his agent, Bill Blakeley, arranged for a tryout with the Atlanta Hawks where Webb beat out several seasoned guards to make the opening roster.

On March 5, 1991, Webb scored a then-career-best 32 points to lead the Hawks to a 139–127 win over the Denver Nuggets.

====1986 NBA Slam Dunk Contest====
Webb was the shortest person to compete in the NBA Slam Dunk Contest, winning the event in 1986 at Dallas&#x27; Reunion Arena. His participation surprised the media; including his teammate and defending dunk champion Dominique Wilkins, who had &quot;never seen me dunk before&quot;, Webb said. His dunks included the elevator two-handed double pump dunk, the off-the-backboard one-handed jam, a 360-degree helicopter one-handed dunk, a reverse double-pump slam, and finally, the reverse two-handed strawberry jam from a lob bounce off the floor. He defeated Wilkins with two perfect 50-point scores in the final round. Atlanta coach Mike Fratello said, &quot;Spud kind of duped him. He told Wilkins he never had anything prepared, didn&#x27;t practice for it. So, Wilkins maybe thought his normal assortment would be good enough to get through&quot;.

The 1986 Slam Dunk victory, along with his play as a rookie and fan favorite, helped Webb to garner dozens of national endorsements from companies such as Pony Shoes, Coca-Cola, Church&#x27;s Fried Chicken, Baden Basketball, Hardee&#x27;s Hamburgers, Sunkist Oranges, Southland Corp and Chips Ahoy!

=== Sacramento Kings (1991–1995) ===
Webb played his first six seasons with the Atlanta Hawks before he was traded to the Sacramento Kings for Travis Mays, where he had his best years statistically and played as a starter from 1992 to 1995. Webb posted career highs of 16.0 points and 7.1 assists per game in his first season with the Kings. He also led the NBA in free throw shooting in his last season in Sacramento, shooting 93.4 percent in 1994–95 (after shooting 81.3 percent the previous season).

=== Return to Atlanta (1995–1996) ===
In 1995, Webb was traded back to the Atlanta Hawks for Tyrone Corbin.

=== Minnesota Timberwolves (1996) ===
Webb played half of the 1995–96 season with the Hawks before he was traded with Andrew Lang to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Christian Laettner and Sean Rooks.

=== Orlando Magic (1998) ===
Webb finished his career after one season with the Orlando Magic, ultimately retiring from professional basketball in 1998.

=== Career accomplishments and legacy ===
Webb had over 50 games with 20 points or more, including a career high 34 points against the Golden State Warriors on April 21, 1993, while on the Kings and a career high 18 assists against the Detroit Pistons on April 19, 1986, while on the Hawks. Webb played 814 games in his 12-year NBA career, averaging 9.9 points per game, scoring 8,072 points, and registering 4,342 assists.

As of 2021, Webb is tied with Mel Hirsch for being the third-shortest player in NBA history. Only two NBA players have been shorter than he is: Muggsy Bogues and Earl Boykins.

==Later endeavors==
Twenty years after Webb&#x27;s victory in the Slam Dunk contest, he trained New York Knicks point guard Nate Robinson (who stands at 5 feet 9 inches tall) to win the event. Webb tossed the ball to Robinson, who leaped over Webb and dunked, earning 50 points from the judges. Robinson went on to win, making him and Webb the only two people in NBA history under six feet tall to win a slam dunk contest.

Webb was a judge for the 2010 Dunk contest in Dallas, held at the American Airlines Center. The 2010 dunk contest marked the first time the event had been held in Dallas since Webb&#x27;s victory in 1986.

In February 2010, the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; reported that Webb had been hired as president of basketball operations by a new NBA Development League team to be based in Frisco, Texas. That team would become known as the Texas Legends. As of December 2023, Webb remains the president of basketball operations for the Legends, who compete in the NBA G League and are affiliated with the Dallas Mavericks of the NBA.

<doc id="807297" wikidata="Q5298872" url="?curid=807297" title="Dorset Wildlife Trust">
<text>Dorset Wildlife Trust (DWT) is a wildlife trust covering the county of Dorset, United Kingdom. The trust was founded in 1961 as Dorset Naturalists&#x27; Trust, to protect and conserve the wildlife and natural habitats of the county.

DWT is one of 46 local independent Wildlife Trusts that make up The Wildlife Trusts. DWT is headquartered at Brooklands Farm, just north of Dorchester. DWT is led by a Council of Trustees, has 27,000 members, 65 staff and over 850 active volunteers. The current chair of DWT is Mark Kibblewhite. Mark is one of Europe&#x27;s leading soil scientists and an Emeritus Professor at Cranfield University. Former Chair Jo Davies, a trustee of over 20 years serves as vice-chair alongside Jim White, leading Dorset naturalist and former team leader for Natural England in Dorset. Notable former chairs include Prof. Nigel Webb, one of the UK&#x27;s leading experts on heathlands and author of Collins New Naturalist No. 72 Heathlands, and Tony Bates, who was awarded an MBE in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours 2015 for his outstanding contribution to nature conservation in Dorset. The Chief Executive of Dorset Wildlife Trust is Brian Bleese who was appointed on 1 April 2020 after a short period as acting CE. Bleese has been with Dorset Wildlife Trust since 1998 and has held various roles with the Trust most recently that of Director of Operations and Development.

Best known for its suite of high quality nature reserves, the conservation, education, and community partnership work of the Dorset Wildlife Trust extends well beyond the designated nature reserves. DWT also runs a series of special projects led by conservation staff working with groups of volunteer members and supporter groups throughout the county. They are involved in monitoring and improving habitats for wildlife not only in the open countryside, rivers and coastal waters but also in urban and suburban environments, churchyards, and roadside verges.

A core aim of the trust, in conjunction with wildlife trusts throughout Britain, is to establish and promote living landscapes and living seas, wildlife corridors, nectar-rich links, etc. Living Landscapes are large areas in which both people and wildlife can prosper.

DWT has also taken a lead role in drawing together partnerships to establish Nature Parks, large areas managed for the benefit of people and wildlife. One such example of this is Holes Bay Nature Park on the edge of Poole. Holes Bay Nature Park is a partnership involving DWT, Borough of Poole and Poole Harbour Commissioners.

==History==

=== Origins ===
In the 1950s and 1960s considerable heathland, downland and other habitats were lost, nationally and in Dorset. The county&#x27;s heaths in the mid-eighteenth century extended to over 40,000 hectares, and had been reduced to about 10,000 hectares by 1960. The losses of chalk downland were even more drastic with vast areas converted to arable farming and cereal growing.

These losses led to increasing concerns that natural habitats of scientifically interesting plants and animals were fast disappearing. It was in response to this rising tide of habitat loss that the Dorset Naturalists&#x27; Trust was formed. The inaugural meeting of the new trust was held on Tuesday 28 March 1961 and chaired by leading Dorset naturalist and historian Prof. Ronald Good. The Trust&#x27;s key founder and supporter from its beginnings in 1961 was Helen Brotherton, who would serve Dorset Wildlife Trust for the rest of her life as Honorary Secretary, Chairman and President.

=== Dorset Wildlife Trust and Brownsea Island ===
Mary Bonham-Christie owned Brownsea Island in Poole Harbour, Dorset, and being a recluse she had forbidden access to the Island for many years. In effect, the island had been abandoned to nature. In April 1961, Bonham-Christie died. This was the trigger that set in motion moves to &quot;rescue&quot; Brownsea Island, and preserve it &quot;for the Nation&quot; as a wildlife reserve. At the same time the Dorset Wildlife Trust was being formed with an inaugural meeting in March 1961. The island was handed over to HM Treasury in lieu of death duties, and HM Treasury then came to dispose of this asset. The Dorset Wildlife Trust (then The Dorset Naturalists Trust) was in no position to pay the £100,000 asking price. However, led by Helen Brotherton, an arrangement was made between the National Trust, the Dorset Wildlife Trust, the Boy Scouts Association and the John Lewis Partnership whereby each would provide £25,000 to the National Trust, who would then buy the island, with the other three parties as &quot;partners&quot;, each taking care of their own interests. This partnership has stood the test of time.

== Nature reserves and visitor facilities ==
The trust runs 45 nature reserves totalling over 12 square kilometres, which include 25 Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Most of the reserves are owned by the trust, but some are also leased under agreements with landowners. The reserves represent 1,300 hectares of prime habitat managed for the benefit of wildlife and supporting local and regional biodiversity. The trust&#x27;s diverse collection of reserves reflect the natural diversity of the geologically and habitat rich southern English county of Dorset. The wide variety of landscapes includes chalk grasslands, ancient meadows, prime woodland, internationally important rare heathland, valuable wetlands, and a section of the World Heritage listed Jurassic Coast. According to the trust, more than 200,000 people visit their reserves each year.

The trust also has seven wildlife education and outreach centres in the county:- 

* Fine Foundation Wild Seas Centre, Kimmeridge, 
* The Kingcombe Centre, Lower Kingcombe, Toller Porcorum 
* Lorton Meadows Wildlife Centre, Weymouth, 
* The Villa Wildlife Centre, Brownsea Island 
* Urban Wildlife Centre, Corfe Mullen, Poole
* Fine Foundation Wild Chesil Centre, Portland and 
* Brooklands Farm itself, DWT&#x27;s HQ.

== Rewilding ==
In 2021 the trust acquired 170 hectares of the land of Court Farm, near Bere Regis, Dorset, for £3.8 million, utilising a grant of £3.12m from Dorset Council and Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council with Dorset Wildlife Trust providing the balance of the required funding. The grant from the councils was to mitigate the flow of nitrates into the Poole Harbour catchment and a condition of the grant was the removal of the land from intensive, environmentally damaging agriculture. Utilising natural regeneration methods the trust started the process of rewilding the land. The initiative has received significant support from local community volunteers and Bere Regis Parish Council.

The Trust was supported in the purchase by philanthropist Julia Davies of &#x27;We have the Power&#x27;. Following consultation with Dorset Wildlife Trust members and the local community the site was renamed &#x27;Wild Woodbury&#x27; to reflect the area&#x27;s history and future aspirations.

== The Great Heath ==
In 2013 DWT led the development of the Great Heath Living Landscape project, a partnership involving Borough of Poole, The Erica Trust, Amphibian and Reptile Conservation (ARC), Poole Harbour Commissioners and Dorset County Council. The project was initiated to enable the purchase of almost 1500 acres of heathland and other habitats from Canford Estate. During its development phase the project expanded to include a three-year access and engagement programme and a suite of sites owned and managed by partners. The project was funded by a grant of £2.7m from the Heritage Lottery Fund and a further £2.1m from partners, other funding bodies and through community fundraising.

== Nature parks ==
A key initiative of Dorset Wildlife Trust is the establishment of Nature Parks. DWT describes Nature Parks as a partnership of landowners and stakeholders that have come together to manage an area for its special features and its value to both people and wildlife.

The first Nature Park to be launched was Holes Bay Nature Park located in Poole Harbour is a partnership of DWT, Poole Harbour Commissioners and Borough of Poole together with a range of stakeholders including local businesses and community groups. Holes Bay Nature Park was launched in 2015.

Corfe Barrows Nature Park, which opened in June 2016 is a partnership of landowners including Dorset Wildlife Trust, Borough of Poole, Christchurch and East Dorset Councils, Amphibian and Reptile Conservation and the Erica Trust. Access improvements, signage and information panels were funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and SITA Trust (Landfill Communities Fund).
