<text>Douglas Ross, M.D. is a fictional character from the NBC medical drama series &quot;ER,&quot; portrayed by American actor George Clooney. He is a pediatric fellow, employed by the pediatric service, but works in the ER. He is later promoted to a pediatric attending in the ER. He appears from the pilot episode before departing in the fifth season episode &quot;The Storm - Part II&quot;. Clooney later made guest appearances in the sixth season episode &quot;Such Sweet Sorrow&quot; and in the fifteenth season episode &quot;Old Times&quot;.

==Character biography==
Doug Ross was raised by his mother, Sarah, after his father, Ray, abandoned their family. In Season 1, Ross revealed to a patient that he had a son, and he tells nurse Wendy Goldman that he doesn&#x27;t know his son&#x27;s name as he&#x27;s never seen him. Not much else is known about Doug&#x27;s past.

Doug&#x27;s estranged son was a large part of the reason that he became a pediatrician. In 2019, &quot;ER&quot; executive producer John Wells shared, &quot;Part of the reason why he wanted to become a pediatrician and be around children and care for children is because of his guilt that he wasn&#x27;t the person he wanted to be when he had a child as a young man. That was always meant to be part of who was, but we didn&#x27;t want to turn it into a Hallmark movie.&quot;

Despite his jumbled personal life, Ross is shown to be a dedicated ER pediatrician, no matter the rules or the consequences. In Season 2, Doug rescued a boy trapped in a flooding storm drain during a rainstorm. His heroic efforts were broadcast live on a local news station, making him a media star. This event helped him earn back his job at County General, because his supervisor in pediatrics originally wasn&#x27;t going to renew his fellowship due to his repeated disrespect for authority.

During Season 2, Doug&#x27;s father tries to reconcile with Doug, who has difficulty reconnecting with the man who abandoned him and his mother. Ray owns a ritzy hotel in Chicago, and Doug lets his guard down a little, but is disappointed when his father offers to take him to a Chicago Bulls game and then stands him up. Ross later reveals that he and his mother were abused by his father. Doug later has an affair with Ray&#x27;s girlfriend, a woman from whom Ray stole money, but ends the relationship when it becomes clear that she has many problems.

Initially, Ross is portrayed as a womanizer who dates and leaves many women throughout the course of his time on the show. At one point, he has a one-night-stand with Harper Tracy, a medical student who had been tentatively pursued by Dr. John Carter; this leads to a rift between Ross and Carter for a time. His womanizing days abruptly end after an epileptic woman he picks up in a bar has a seizure while he drives her home and eventually dies in the ER. Ross learns her name only after her death, which prompts him to stop sleeping around and make an effort to get back together with Carol Hathaway, the head nurse of the ER at County General.

The relationship between Doug and Carol, which had previously ended on bad terms prior to the pilot episode, is rekindled in fits and starts over the course of the first five seasons. Doug leaves Chicago for Seattle during season five.

In the show&#x27;s sixth season episode, &quot;Such Sweet Sorrow,&quot; Carol flies to Seattle to get back together with Doug. Warner Bros. Television, the studio which produces &quot;ER&quot; for NBC, kept secret from the network the return of Dr. Ross. Instead, &quot;Such Sweet Sorrow&quot; was promoted as Carol Hathaway&#x27;s goodbye, with no mention of Ross&#x27; appearance. The original version of &quot;Such Sweet Sorrow&quot; that Warner Bros. sent to NBC ended after the scene where viewers see Hathaway on the plane to Seattle. At the eleventh hour, Warner Bros. sent an &quot;edited&quot; version of the episode by messenger to NBC headquarters in New York for broadcast. NBC was unhappy that it was kept in the dark as it could have generated valuable ad revenue if it had aired promos that the episode marked the return of George Clooney.

Clooney cited the fans of the show for his reason for making the cameo (he wanted Hathaway&#x27;s and Ross&#x27;s characters to get back together, which many fans hoped for). Clooney reportedly only asked to be paid scale for the cameo.

In the season 15 episode &quot;Old Times&quot;, Ross is working as an attending physician at the University of Washington Medical Center alongside his wife, Carol Hathaway, who is now a transplant coordinator at the hospital. Together, they help a grieving grandmother (Susan Sarandon) whose grandson was gravely injured in a bicycle accident, convincing her to donate the boy&#x27;s organs.

In the episode, Doug chats with Sam and Neela after finding out that they are from County, asking them whether any of his old colleagues still work there. Doug and Carol are responsible for getting the kidney for Carter and a heart for another County patient, though they never learn the identities of the recipients.

===Career===
In the pilot episode, which takes place on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day 1994, Ross is brought into the ER not long before his shift, to be &quot;treated&quot; for drunkenness by his longtime friend, Dr. Mark Greene. Viewers also see Doug&#x27;s reaction to the near-death of his ex-girlfriend, nurse Carol Hathaway, after she is brought into the ER as a patient following a suicide attempt.

Throughout the next few seasons, Ross is shown to be compassionate, though not always using the best judgment. His love of children is best seen during darker situations, such as when a child is in danger. When Peter Benton talks about how surgeons deal with emotionally charged cases and ER doctors have it easy, Ross leaves him speechless by describing cases that include a young girl who beat her mother to death, a kid who is going to lose his leg to cancer and another kid who is dying from a life of homelessness. His brashness leads him to confront parents he thinks are irresponsible, and in one instance he publicly assaults a man who had abused his daughter; Ross&#x27;s counseling in that case just consists of a shrink telling him not to do that again.

He is a passionate doctor who puts the welfare of his patients, especially children, above his medical career. In the Season 2 episode &quot;Hell and High Water,&quot; Dr. Ross saves a young boy who nearly drowns in a flooded storm drain and commandeers a news helicopter to take him to County General, with much of his attempts to save the child being shown on live TV. This garners him much attention, earns him an award, and saves his job. Ross doesn&#x27;t handle authority well, even when Mark is his boss. Despite being a pediatrician, in several episodes he&#x27;s asked to perform medical procedures on adults, usually when the other doctors are busy.

In another episode, he tries to do an ultra-rapid detox on a drug-addicted baby without the mother&#x27;s consent. Hathaway assists, but when Greene and Dr. Kerry Weaver discover that the procedure is being done in violation of hospital policy and the law, Doug is punished. He is left on probation for 30 days and is supervised by Drs. Weaver and Greene, who have to co-sign his charts. Doug&#x27;s attitude toward patient treatment often has consequences for his coworkers and supervisors, who have received reprimands from their superiors for his actions.

In Season 4 he vies to be an attending physician for emergency pediatrics. He eventually gets the job, even though Greene and Weaver oppose his promotion because the position isn&#x27;t necessary and the funds are needed elsewhere. Greene is ultimately happy for Ross, but Weaver is aghast and campaigns against his new position.

He resigns in Season 5 following a scandal in which he shows a mother how to bypass the lockouts on a Dilaudid PCA, enabling her to give a lethal dose of medication to her terminally ill son. Ross had earlier stolen Dilaudid from a pain-medication study and given it to the mother, only to be discovered by Weaver and Greene, who reprimand him but kept the incident private. The incident prompts the closure of Hathaway&#x27;s free clinic in the hospital, since it supplied the PCA to this mother, and Ross faces suspension from work and possible criminal charges.

A friend of Ross, who is the Chief of Genetics, stands up for him and the charges against him are dropped, but Ross resigns from the hospital and moves to Seattle. When Ross leaves, he and Hathaway are on poor terms until she discovers that she&#x27;s pregnant with his twin girls. Her clinic is later re-opened, but she has to report to her former assistant there.

Ross was written out of the series because Clooney wished to focus on his expanding film career. He also said that there wasn&#x27;t any strong story in place for his character after Season 5. He appeared at the end of the penultimate episode of season 6, when Carol leaves Cook County to reunite with Ross in Seattle. He was reportedly asked to return briefly in season 8, to make an appearance in Anthony Edwards&#x27;s last episode during Greene&#x27;s funeral, but Clooney declined because he did not want his cameo appearance to overshadow the departure of a beloved character on the show.

Clooney returned to &quot;ER&quot; for its 15th and final season in 2009 in a story arc beginning with Episode 328, titled &quot;Old Times&quot;, with Julianna Margulies also returning as Hathaway. In the episode, the two are now married and work to help convince a grieving grandmother to donate her grandson&#x27;s organs. During the process, Doug talks with Neela Rasgotra and learns that nearly everyone he knows has since departed County with Anspaugh being the only one left. At the end of the episode they receive word of the success of their efforts, unaware that the doctor who got the kidney was their old friend John Carter.

==Character development==
===Casting and creation===
George Clooney did not receive a casting call for the television series. He received a draft of the script from a friend; he read it and became interested in the part. He said: &quot;I like the flaws in this guy. I can play him.&quot;

===Characterization===
The character was described as &quot;a complicated children&#x27;s doctor who could be self-centered, quick-tempered, and giving, hitting the bottle to avoid dealing with consequences of his actions.&quot;

&quot;ER&quot; executive producer John Wells originally intended for Doug Ross&#x27; relationship with an unknown son to be a bigger part of his character, saying in 2019, &quot;There are people among us who lose track of their children. [George and I] talked about it at the time. We both know people, know men, who had children that they have no contact with for whatever reason. That&#x27;s what we were trying to play with.&quot; However, Doug&#x27;s son is only mentioned in one episode of &quot;ER&quot;.

Until he restarts and strengthens his relationship with head nurse Carol Hathaway, Doug is shown to be a womanizing character who is involved with many women.

==Reception==
The character of Doug Ross is an iconic and popular character. In 2004, Ross was listed in Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest TV Characters&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; placed Ross in its list of the &quot;30 Great TV Doctors and Nurses&quot;. The character was also included in Fox News&#x27; list of &quot;The Best TV Doctors For Surgeon General&quot; and in &quot;Philadelphia Magazine&quot; 10 Best Doctors on Television.

Ross was listed in Wetpaint&#x27;s &quot;10 Hottest Male Doctors on TV&quot; and in BuzzFeed&#x27;s &quot;16 Hottest Doctors on Television&quot;. His relationship with Carol Hathaway was included in AOL TV&#x27;s list of the &quot;Best TV Couples of All Time&quot; and in the same list by &quot;TV Guide&quot;.

For his work on the series, Clooney received two Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Lead Actor In A Drama Series in 1995 and 1996. He was also nominated for three Golden Globe Awards for Best Actor – Television Series Drama in 1995, 1996, and 1997 (losing to co-star Anthony Edwards).

<doc id="809389" wikidata="Q3542563" url="?curid=809389" title="FYI (Canadian TV channel)">
<text>FYI (stylized as fyi,) was a Canadian English language specialty channel owned by Discovery Health Canada, ULC, a subsidiary of Corus Entertainment. Based on the American cable network of the same name, the channel featured lifestyle programming, with a mix of reality, culinary, home renovation and makeover series.

The channel was launched on September 7, 2001, as Discovery Health Channel by a joint venture of Alliance Atlantis and Discovery Communications, which focused on health and wellness-oriented programming. Discovery Health was acquired by Canwest in 2008 which rebranded the network as Twist TV in 2010 before being taken over by Shaw Media. As Twist TV, the channel shifted to reality programming aimed at a female demographic.

After being rebranded to FYI in 2014 and acquired by Corus in 2016, the channel ended its operations on December 31, 2019.

==History==

===As Discovery Health===

In January 2000, Alliance Atlantis brokered a deal with Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation and several Canadian television providers, including both national satellite companies Bell ExpressVu and Star Choice, to distribute News Corporation&#x27;s cable channel, The Health Network, in Canada. The deal would mark the first time The Health Network would be available in Canada.

The deal struck to sponsor The Health Network&#x27;s distribution in Canada was a prelude to the fact that Alliance Atlantis and News Corporation would eventually launch a Canadian version of the channel for the domestic market and remove the American channel from the Canadian market. On November 24, 2000, Alliance Atlantis (which would hold 80% majority interest in the channel) and News Corporation (which would hold the remaining 20% interest) were granted a broadcasting licence for The Health Network Canada by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).

Prior to the launch of the network, in September 2001, Discovery Communications (owners of Discovery Health Channel in the U.S.) bought The Health Network from News Corporation for US$255 million. Through that transaction, Discovery Communications would also acquire News Corporation&#x27;s 20% interest in The Health Network Canada.
As a result of Discovery Communications&#x27; newly acquired interest in the service, the network was launched that same month on September 7, 2001, as the &quot;Discovery Health Channel&quot;. On the same day as the Canadian channel&#x27;s launch, the American service, The Health Network, was removed from all Canadian television providers. In February 2002, The Health Network was removed from the CRTC&#x27;s list of foreign satellite services eligible for carriage on Canadian pay television providers, by request of The Health Network&#x27;s owners.

On January 18, 2008, a joint venture between Canwest and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, known as CW Media, bought Alliance Atlantis and through that transaction, acquired Alliance Atlantis&#x27; interest in Discovery Health. In 2009, CW Media purchased the remaining interest in the channel from Discovery Communications, bringing its ownership to 100%.

===As Twist TV===

Two deals were announced in late 2009 and early 2010 that affected the future of the Canadian channel. First, Discovery Communications announced that the flagship Discovery Health channel in the U.S. would be replaced by the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN) in January 2011. OWN later reached an agreement with Corus Entertainment to launch a Canadian version of that channel shortly after the U.S. version&#x27;s debut. Later in April 2010, Discovery Communications announced an expanded long-term agreement with Bell Media (then CTVglobemedia, Discovery&#x27;s Canadian partner for most of its other channels) under which Bell holds Canadian broadcast rights to most of the Discovery Communications programming library, including Discovery Health programs, and the right to launch new Discovery-branded channels.

On September 15, 2010, Canwest announced Discovery Health Canada would rebrand as &quot;Twist TV&quot; on November 1. The rebranded channel would focus on reality shows about &quot;people facing extraordinary situations&quot; aimed at a female demographic including such shows as &quot;Nanny 911&quot;, &quot;Raising Sextuplets&quot;, &quot;Dad Camp&quot;, and &quot;Little Miss Perfect&quot;. The name came from the narrative &quot;twist&quot; trope common with reality and non-fiction programming. On October 27, 2010, the channel&#x27;s ownership changed again as Shaw Communications gained control of Discovery Health as a result of its acquisition of Canwest and Goldman Sachs&#x27; interest in CW Media. The channel officially rebranded five days later. The network was wholly unrelated to the American Twist network with the same format launched in 2021.

===Rebrand as FYI===
In June 2014, it was reported that Twist TV, along with sister network Mystery TV, would be rebranded as Canadian versions of FYI and the Crime &amp; Investigation Network under a licensing agreement with A+E Networks. A+E Networks and Shaw Media had previously partnered to rebrand History Television, Showcase Diva and The Cave as Canadian versions of History, Lifetime and H2 in 2012.

The launch of FYI (as well as CI) was intended to draw in more female viewers, the primary audience of Shaw Media&#x27;s lifestyle networks. In addition to programming from the U.S. service, as well as other Shaw Media-owned channels, the new channel will air shows from other sources. The channel was relaunched on the morning of September 1, 2014 with a free preview to last the rest of the month. A month prior, a Canadian version of the FYI website went online. Over time, the website was updated to include information pertaining to the channel.

A YouTube channel went online August 28, 2014; on that day, sneak peeks of FYI programming aired on Lifetime and Slice. On April 1, 2016, Shaw Media was sold to Corus Entertainment.

===Closure===
In June 2019, at the Corus Entertainment upfronts, Corus Entertainment announced its Fall 2019 schedules of its top-performing specialty channels. However, FYI was not included in the upfronts.

In October 2019, Corus announced that FYI would be shut down at midnight on December 31, 2019, after which the channel space created in 2001 by Discovery Health Channel ceased to exist. The channel&#x27;s license was surrendered to the CRTC on February 4, 2020.

Some of its programming such as &quot;Storage Wars&quot;, which aired on this channel, are also available on Disney+ which is accessible in Canada.

==FYI HD==
In late 2016, Corus launched FYI HD, a 1080i high definition simulcast of the standard definition feed. The HD feed was available on Bell Fibe TV, Bell MTS and Optik TV. On August 8, 2018, it launched on Shaw Direct. The HD feed shut down on December 31, 2019.

<doc id="809444" wikidata="Q5684607" url="?curid=809444" title="Hawaiian hibiscus">
<text>Hawaiian hibiscus are seven species of hibiscus native to Hawaii. The yellow hibiscus is Hawaii&#x27;s state flower. Most commonly grown as ornamental plants in the Hawaiian Islands are the non-native Chinese hibiscus (&quot;Hibiscus rosa-sinensis&quot;) and its numerous hybrids, though the native &quot;Hibiscus arnottianus&quot; is occasionally planted.

The native plants in the genus &quot;Hibiscus&quot; in Hawaii are thought to have derived from four independent colonization events for the five endemic species (four closely related species plus the yellow-flowered species) and one each for the two indigenous species.

==Native species==
The native hibiscus found in Hawaii are:

*Hibiscus arnottianus – &quot;kokio keokeo&quot; (&quot;&quot;kokio&quot; that is white like the shine of silver&quot;) is an endemic species of hibiscus with white flowers. Three subspecies are recognized: &quot;H. arnottianus&quot; ssp. &quot;arnottianus&quot; found in the Waianae Range of western Oahu; &quot;H. a.&quot; ssp. &quot;immaculatus&quot; which is very rare (listed as endangered) on Molokai; and &quot;H. a.&quot; ssp. &quot;punaluuensis&quot; from the Koolau Range on Oahu. Perhaps only a dozen plants of &quot;H. a.&quot; ssp. &quot;immaculatus&quot; exist in nature in mesic and wet forests. This species is closely related to &quot;H. waimeae&quot;, and the two are among the very few members of the genus with fragrant flowers. It is sometimes planted as an ornamental or crossed with &quot;H. rosa-sinensis&quot;. In the Hawaiian language, the white hibiscus is known as the &quot;pua aloalo&quot;.
* Hibiscus brackenridgei – &quot;mao hau hele&quot; (&quot;&quot;hau&quot; most similar to &quot;mao&quot;&quot;) is a tall shrub (up to ) with bright yellow flowers, closely related to the widespread &quot;H. divaricatus&quot;. Two subspecies are recognized: &quot;H. b.&quot; ssp. &quot;brackenridgei&quot;, a sprawling shrub to an erect tree found in dry forests and low shrublands at elevations of above sea level on Molokai, Lanai, Maui, and the island of Hawaii; and &quot;H. b.&quot; ssp. &quot;mokuleianus&quot;, a tree from dry habitats on Kauai and the Waianae Range on Oahu. This species is listed as an endangered species by the USFWS. The yellow flower of this species was made the official state flower of Hawaii on 6 June 1988, and although endangered in its natural habitats, has become a moderately popular ornamental in Hawaiian yards.
*Hibiscus clayi is an endemic shrub or small tree with bright red flowers, generally similar to &quot;H. kokio&quot;, and found in nature on Kauai in dry forests. It is listed as endangered by USFWS.
* Hibiscus furcellatus is a pink-flowered hibiscus considered an indigenous species, typically found in low and marshy areas of the Caribbean, Florida, Central and South America, and Hawaii, where it is known as &quot;akiohala&quot;, &quot;akiahala&quot;, &quot;hau hele&quot;, and &quot;hau hele wai&quot; (&quot;entirely puce &quot;hau&quot;&quot;).
*Hibiscus kokio , &quot;kokio&quot; or &quot;kokio ula&quot; (&quot;red &quot;kokio&quot;) is a shrub or small tree () with red to orangish (or rarely yellow) flowers. This endemic species is not officially listed, but considered rare in nature. Two subspecies are recognized: &quot;H. kokio&quot; ssp. &quot;kokio&quot; found in dry to wet forests on Kauai, Oahu, Maui, and possibly Hawaii at elevations of ; and &quot;H. k.&quot; ssp. &quot;saintjohnianus&quot; from northwestern Kauai at elevations of .
* Hibiscus tiliaceus , &quot;hau&quot;, is a spreading shrub or tree common to the tropics and subtropics, especially in coastal areas. This species is possibly indigenous to Hawaii, but may have been introduced by the early Polynesians.
* Hibiscus waimeae , &quot;kokio keokeo&quot; or &quot;kokio kea&quot; (&quot;kokio&quot; that is white as snow&quot;), is a Hawaiian endemic, gray-barked tree, tall, with white flowers that fade to pink in the afternoon. Two subspecies are recognized: &quot;H. waimeae&quot; ssp. &quot;hannerae&quot; (rare and listed as endangered) found in northwestern valleys of Kauai, and &quot;H. w.&quot; ssp. &quot;waimeae&quot; occurring in the Waimea Canyon and some western to southern valleys on Kauai. This species closely resembles &quot;H. arnottianus&quot; in a number of characteristics.

== Other Malvaceae ==
In addition to the species of &quot;Hibiscus&quot; listed above, flowers of several other related Hawaiian plants of the family Malvaceae resemble &quot;Hibiscus&quot; flowers, although are generally smaller. The endemic genus, &quot;Hibiscadelphus&quot;, comprises seven species described from Hawaii. Three of these are now thought to be extinct and the remaining four are listed as critically endangered or extinct in the wild. Another endemic genus, &quot;Kokia&quot;, comprises four species of trees. All but one (&quot;K. kauaiensis&quot;) are listed as either extinct or nearly extinct in the wild.

Three endemic species of the pantropical genus, &quot;Abutilon&quot; occur in Hawaii: &quot;A. eremitopetalum&quot;, &quot;A. menziesii&quot;, and &quot;A. sandwicense&quot;; all are listed as endangered. Cotton plants (&quot;Gossypium&quot; spp.), whose bright yellow flowers are certainly hibiscus-like, include one endemic: &quot;G. tomentosum&quot;, uncommon but found in dry places on all the main islands except Hawaii. The widespread &quot;milo&quot; (&quot;Thespesia populnea&quot;) is an indigenous tree with yellow and maroon flowers.

South Korea&#x27;s national flower is the Hibiscus syriacus which is widely found in Hawaii, too.

<doc id="809460" wikidata="Q225654" url="?curid=809460" title="Kazuhiko Inoue">
<text>is a Japanese actor, voice actor, narrator and singer. His notable works include Anthony Brown in &quot;Candy Candy&quot;, Joe Shimamura in the 1979 iteration of &quot;Cyborg 009&quot;, Jerid Messa in &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot;, Kakashi Hatake in &quot;Naruto&quot;, Kars in &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot;, Toichirou Suzuki in &quot;Mob Psycho 100&quot;, Gildarts Clive in &quot;Fairy Tail&quot;, Yoriichi Tsugikuni in &quot;Demon Slayer&quot;, and Neuras in &quot;&quot;.

==Biography==
Since his debut in 1973, he became one of Japan&#x27;s most well established voice actors. His early roles from the 1970s include Anthony in &quot;Candy Candy&quot;, and later as Joe in the 1979 iteration of &quot;Cyborg 009&quot;. In the 1980s, Inoue&#x27;s work ranged from the adult-oriented &quot;Oishinbo&quot; (The Gourmet) to the popular &quot;Legend of Heavenly Sphere Shurato&quot; for the younger generation. More recently, he is known internationally for roles such as Kars in JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure, Kakashi Hatake in &quot;Naruto&quot;, Eiri Yuki in &quot;Gravitation&quot;, Aion in &quot;Chrono Crusade&quot;, Hatori Sohma in &quot;Fruits Basket&quot;, and Nyanko-sensei/Madara in &quot;Natsume Yūjin Chō&quot;. His voice performance is often described as natural and relaxed.

This wide and versatile vocal range allows Inoue to voice roles of varying personality types: hot-blooded, righteous main characters such as Joe in &quot;Cyborg 009&quot; and Akira Kogane in &quot;Golion&quot;; coolly arrogant bishōnen typified by Eiri Yuki; the amusingly fussy yet powerful mazoku (demon), Guenter in &quot;Kyo Kara Maoh!&quot;; seductive, manipulative villains like Aion; and bloodthirsty killers (e.g. Kars and Gotou). Inoue is also well known for more unusual roles such as the crossdresser Nagisa Sawa in &quot;Haru wo Daiteita&quot;, and Shiron the Windragon in &quot;Legendz&quot;, who spends half his time as a screeching hamster.

Inoue does voices for anime, video games, drama CDs, Japanese-dubbed movies, and audio books. He has put out many LP and CD albums and has sung in various anime character albums. His most well-known songs are the ones related to the &quot;Harukanaru Toki no Naka de Hachiyō Shō&quot; series, which he performs live on stage at the annual NeoRomance voice acting events in Japan. In recent years, Inoue has also tried his hand in backstage work such as sound directing. He has set up his own voice acting agency and school, B-Box, to teach the next generation voice talents. He is also the official dubbing roles for Matthew Fox and Mads Mikkelsen.

Being a second-generation A-bomb survivor, he feels strongly against wars. In his autobiographical piece, &quot;Ai ni Tsuite&quot;, (愛について About Love, from his CD album &quot;Ai&quot;, 2003) Inoue expresses his longings for world peace and his love and respect for the ocean and Mother Earth. He was also a close friend of the late fellow voice actor Daisuke Gori. Recently, Inoue won as &quot;Best Supporting Actor&quot; in the Third Seiyu Awards for his role as Nyanko-sensei in &quot;Natsume Yūjin Chō&quot;.

==Personal life==
Inoue has married and divorced three times. His first marriage was with manga artist Yumiko Igarashi. Together, they have a son named Keiichi Igarashi (born 1980 or 1981), known professionally as Nanami Igarashi, who is a former idol trainee at Johnny &amp; Associates and later published a comic essay about his experiences as an &quot;otokonoko&quot;. His second marriage was with voice actress . He had a relationship with actress , from 2001 to 2012.

<doc id="809484" wikidata="Q746743" url="?curid=809484" title="Ricercar">
<text>A ricercar ( , ) or ricercare ( , ) is a type of late Renaissance and mostly early Baroque instrumental composition. The term &quot;ricercar&quot; derives from the Italian verb , which means &quot;to search out; to seek&quot;; many ricercars serve a preludial function to &quot;search out&quot; the key or mode of a following piece. A ricercar may explore the permutations of a given motif, and in that regard may follow the piece used as illustration. The term is also used to designate an etude or study that explores a technical device in playing an instrument, or singing.

In its most common contemporary usage, it refers to an early kind of fugue, particularly one of a serious character in which the subject uses long note values. However, the term has a considerably more varied historical usage.

Among the best-known ricercars are the two for harpsichord contained in Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Musical Offering&quot; and Domenico Gabrielli&#x27;s set of seven for solo cello. The latter set contains what are considered to be some of the earliest pieces for solo cello ever written.

==Terminology==
In the sixteenth century, the word ricercar could refer to several types of compositions. Terminology was flexible, even lax then: whether a composer called an instrumental piece a toccata, a canzona, a fantasia, or a ricercar was clearly not a matter of strict taxonomy but a rather arbitrary decision. Yet ricercars fall into two general types: a predominantly homophonic piece, with occasional runs and passagework, not unlike a toccata, found from the late fifteenth to the mid-sixteenth century, after which time this type of piece came to be called a toccata; and from the second half of the sixteenth century onward, a sectional work in which each section begins imitatively, usually in a variation form. The second type of ricercar, the imitative, contrapuntal type, was to prove the more important historically, and eventually developed into the fugue. Marco Dall&#x27;Aquila (c. 1480–after 1538) was known for polyphonic ricercars.

Examples of both types of ricercars can be found in the works of Girolamo Frescobaldi, e.g. in his &quot;Fiori musicali&quot;.

<doc id="809507" wikidata="Q4688858" url="?curid=809507" title="Affairs of the Mind">
<text>Affairs of the Mind is a radio documentary made by Melbourne, Australia, audio producer Kyla Brettle.

The piece is a personal and confronting story exploring the nature of jealousy and the perimeters of infidelity. In an observational style we follow private detective Steve Murray through a marital investigation and track his client&#x27;s transition from doubt to certainty. Along the way we examine why Steve himself is drawn to this line of work and what his client is really getting for her money.

&quot;Affairs Of The Mind&quot; was first broadcast on ABC Radio National as part of the &quot;Radio Eye&quot; series on 21 July 2001 and subsequently by Radio New Zealand National on 29 June 2003 as well as by Chicago Public Radio.

Brettle won the Best New Artist Award for the piece at the 2002 Third Coast International Audio Festival.

<doc id="809513" wikidata="Q2924290" url="?curid=809513" title="Breeders' Cup Classic">
<text>The Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic is a Grade I Weight for Age thoroughbred horse race for 3-year-olds and older run at a distance of on dirt. It is held annually at a different racetrack in the United States as part of the Breeders&#x27; Cup World Championships in late October or early November. All of the races to date have been held in the United States except for the 1996 edition held at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Canada.

The Classic is considered by many to be the premier thoroughbred horse race of the year in the U.S., although the Kentucky Derby is more widely known among casual racing fans. Once the richest race in the world, in more recent years, only the Saudi Cup, Dubai World Cup, The Everest and Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe have had consistently higher purses. Often, the winner of the Classic goes on to win U.S. Horse of the Year honors, including the four winners of the race between 2004 and 2007—respectively Ghostzapper, Saint Liam, Invasor, and Curlin. Due to the extremely high quality of horses in the event, the race is notoriously hard to predict. One notable example of an underdog winning the Classic is the victory of Arcangues in 1993. This was the biggest upset in Breeders&#x27; Cup history and his $269.20 payoff for a $2 wager remains a Breeders&#x27; Cup record.

The Classic is now regarded as the fourth leg of horse racing&#x27;s Grand Slam of Thoroughbred racing — the traditional Triple Crown (Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes, and Belmont Stakes) plus the Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic. After American Pharoah&#x27;s Triple Crown win earlier in 2015, the term became popular; the colt became the first horse to ever accomplish this feat.

==Notable renewals==

===1980s===
The first running of the Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic in 1984 produced an exciting finish between 30–1 longshot Wild Again on the inside, Gate Dancer on the outside and favorite Slew o&#x27; Gold in between. The three battled down the stretch with Wild Again shifting his path away from the rail and Gate Dancer &quot;lugging in&quot; towards the rail, squeezing out Slew O&#x27; Gold. Wild Again finished a neck in front of Gate Dancer with Slew o&#x27; Gold less than a length behind. After a 10-minute stewards&#x27; inquiry, Wild Again was left in first place but Gate Dancer was disqualified to third.

The 1987 renewal featured the face-off between two Kentucky Derby winners, Ferdinand and Alysheba. Ferdinand, who won the Derby in 1986, reached the lead in mid-stretch, then struggled to hold off the late charge of Alysheba. In a photo finish, Ferdinand prevailed by a nose and would later be named Horse of the Year. Alysheba came back in 1988 to win the Classic, becoming the then-leading money earner in history.

In the 1989 renewal, Sunday Silence and Easy Goer faced off for the last time in one of racing&#x27;s most famous rivalries. Sunday Silence had beaten Easy Goer in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes but Easy Goer turned the tables in the Belmont. Easy Goer then won the Whitney, Travers, Woodward and Jockey Club Gold Cup, making him the 1–2 favorite in the Classic. Sunday Silence raced five lengths behind the early leaders, with Easy Goer six lengths further behind. Easy Goer made a move down the backstretch and got next to Sunday Silence, who then made his own move as they rounded the final turn. Sunday Silence opened up a three-length lead, but Easy Goer again started closing down the stretch. At the wire, Sunday Silence prevailed by a neck, earning him Horse of the Year honors.

===1990s===
The 1993 renewal saw the biggest upset in Breeders&#x27; Cup history when the French-based Arcangues won at odds of 133–1. California-based horses had dominated at Santa Anita in the preceding races, and Bertrando was expected to continue the trend. He set the early pace and had a comfortable lead coming down the stretch, only to be caught near the wire. Arcangues&#x27; jockey Jerry Bailey had timed the run perfectly, even though he had never ridden the horse before. &quot;I couldn&#x27;t understand the instructions the trainer (André Fabre) gave me in the paddock&quot;, he said. &quot;I don&#x27;t even know how to pronounce the horse&#x27;s name. But sometimes a horse runs best when he is ridden by someone who has never been on him before.&quot;

In 1995, Cigar came into the Classic having won seven straight Grade I races and was made the 3–5 favorite. On a muddy track, he scored a length victory in the excellent time of 1:59, then the fastest Classic ever run. When calling the race, track announcer Tom Durkin referred to him as the &quot;unconquerable, invincible, unbeatable&quot; Cigar – a phrase that would be associated with the horse for the rest of his life.

===2000s===
Although Tiznow won the Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic and Horse of the Year honors in 2000, he is best known for his effort in the 2001 renewal. Tiznow experienced a variety of physical problems throughout the year and came into the Classic with only two wins in five starts. Facing him was an exceptionally strong European contingent that included Galileo and Sakhee. The 2001 Breeders&#x27; Cup took place at Belmont Park in New York and was the first major sporting event since 9–11, so security was exceptionally heavy. Europeans won many of the early races on the card and looked set to take the Classic when Sakhee hit the lead in mid-stretch. Tiznow fought back and won the race by a nose, with Tom Durkin calling, &quot;Tiznow wins it for America!&quot; Tiznow became the first and to-date only two-time winner of the Classic.

In the 2009 Classic, Zenyatta came into the Breeders&#x27; Cup with a perfect record of 13 wins from 13 starts. Rather than trying to defend her title in the Ladies Classic (now known as the Distaff), her connections decided to enter her in the Classic against male horses. The race was run on Santa Anita&#x27;s Polytrack synthetic dirt surface, which attracted several turf competitors including Gio Ponti (Man o&#x27; War, Arlington Million), Twice Over (Champion Stakes) and Rip Van Winkle (Sussex, Queen Elizabeth II), who hoped to repeat Raven&#x27;s Pass upset victory in the 2008 Classic. The field also included Mine That Bird (Kentucky Derby), Summer Bird (Belmont and Travers) and Einstein (Santa Anita Handicap), but Quality Road (Florida Derby) was scratched when he refused to load in the starting gate. When the race finally got underway, Zenyatta broke poorly and on the wrong lead. As was her custom, she dropped far back in the early running then started her move around the far turn. Jockey Mike Smith guided her between horses near the rail, then swung the mare wide as they entered the stretch. Zenyatta quickly regained stride and closed on the early leaders, winning by a length over Gio Ponti. Mike Smith believed she would have won by more if she had not slowed when the crowd started to react. &quot;She started pricking her ears and looking at the crowd&quot;, he said. &quot;And she still went, believe it or not, well within herself. She was pricking her ears and galloped out. She didn&#x27;t even take a breath after the race was over. It&#x27;s just incredible.&quot; Zenyatta became the first and still the only female horse to win the Classic.

==Automatic berths==

Beginning in 2007, the Breeders&#x27; Cup developed the Breeders&#x27; Cup Challenge, a series of races in each division that allotted automatic qualifying bids to winners of defined races. Each of the fourteen divisions has multiple qualifying races. Note though that one horse may win multiple challenge races, while other challenge winners will not be entered in the Breeders&#x27; Cup for a variety of reasons such as injury or travel considerations.

In the Classic division, runners are limited to 14 and there are up to eight automatic berths. The 2022 &quot;Win and You&#x27;re In&quot; races were:
# The February Stakes, a Grade 1 race run in February at Tokyo Racecourse in Japan
#The Stephen Foster Handicap, a Grade 2 race run in June at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky
#The Haskell Invitational, a Grade 1 race run in July at Monmouth Park in New Jersey
#The Whitney Handicap, a Grade 1 race run in August at Saratoga Race Course in upstate New York
#The International Stakes, a Group One race run in August at York Racecourse in England
#The Pacific Classic, a Grade 1 race run in September at Del Mar Racetrack in San Diego, California

==Records==
Most wins:
* 2 – Tiznow (2000, 2001)

Stakes record:
* The fastest time recorded in the Breeders Cup Classic belongs to Skip Away, who set the mark of 1:59 under Mike Smith in 1997 at Hollywood Park. Because the Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic is run at different racetracks each year, some of which are faster than others, there is no official stakes record. Note though that Authentic&#x27;s revised time of 1:59.60 set a record at Keeneland, Ghostzapper&#x27;s time of 1:59.02 set a track record at Lone Star Park and Alphabet Soup&#x27;s time of 2:01.0 set a track record on Woodbine&#x27;s old dirt track.

Largest winning margins:
* 8 1/4 lengths - Flightline (2022)

Most wins by a jockey:
* 5 – Chris McCarron (1988, 1989, 1996, 2000, 2001)
* 5 – Jerry Bailey (1991, 1993, 1994, 1995, 2005)

Most wins by a trainer:
* 4 – Bob Baffert (2014, 2015, 2016, 2020)

Most wins by an owner:

<doc id="809517" wikidata="Q7887563" url="?curid=809517" title="Breeders' Cup Juvenile">
<text>The Breeders&#x27; Cup Juvenile is a Thoroughbred horse race for 2-year-old colts and geldings raced on dirt. It is held annually in late October or early November at a different racetrack in the United States or Canada as part of the Breeders&#x27; Cup World Championships. The current purse is US$2,000,000 making it the most valuable race for two-year-olds in North America. It is normally run at a distance of miles.

The Breeders&#x27; Cup Juvenile is typically the first time that the best colts from the various racing circuits across North America (in New York, Kentucky and California in particular) meet up with each other. The winner often earns the Eclipse Award for Champion Two-Year-Old Male Horse, and becomes one of the early favorites for the next year&#x27;s Kentucky Derby.

In 2006, the National Thoroughbred Racing Association (NTRA) wrote in Part 2 of their special series titled &quot;Spiraling To The Breeders&#x27; Cup&quot; that &quot;Arazi turned in what many still consider to be the single-most spectacular performance in Breeders&#x27; Cup history.&quot;

Timber Country was the first Breeders&#x27; Cup Juvenile winner to win an American Triple Crown race when he went on to win the 1995 Preakness Stakes. The 2006 winner, Street Sense, became the first to capture the Kentucky Derby. In 2016, Nyquist won the Kentucky Derby as well.

== Automatic berths ==
Beginning in 2007, the Breeders&#x27; Cup developed the Breeders&#x27; Cup Challenge, a series of &quot;Win and You&#x27;re In&quot; races that allot automatic qualifying bids to winners of defined races. Each of the fourteen divisions has multiple qualifying races, which change somewhat from year to year. Note that one horse may win multiple challenge races, while other challenge winners will not be entered in the Breeders&#x27; Cup for a variety of reasons such as injury or travel considerations.

In the Juvenile division, the number of runners is limited to 14. The 2022 &quot;Win and You&#x27;re In&quot; races were:
# the American Pharoah Stakes, a Grade 1 race run in October at Santa Anita Park in California 
# the Champagne Stakes, a Grade 1 race run in October at Aqueduct Racetrack in New York
# the Breeders&#x27; Futurity, a Grade 1 race at Keeneland in Kentucky

<text>The Breeders&#x27; Cup Mile is a Grade 1 Weight for Age stakes race for thoroughbred racehorses three years old and up, run on a grass course. It has been conducted annually as part of the Breeders&#x27; Cup World Championships since the event&#x27;s inception in 1984. All Breeders&#x27; Cups to date have been held in the United States except for the 1996 event in Canada.

The purse was raised from $1.5 million US to $2 million in 2007.

Freddy Head has won this race twice as a jockey and three times as a trainer.

There is no official stakes record for the Breeders&#x27; Cup Mile as it is run on different racecourses each year, some of which are significantly faster than others. In 2012, Wise Dan set a then-course record at Santa Anita with his time of 1:31.78. Although Tourist ran faster than this with a time of 1:31.71 in 2016, he just missed the current Santa Anita course record of 1:31.69.

<text>The NBA conference finals are the Eastern and Western Conference championship series of the National Basketball Association (NBA), a professional basketball league in North America. The NBA was founded in 1946 as the Basketball Association of America (BAA). The NBA adopted its current name at the start of the 1949–50 season when the BAA merged with the National Basketball League (NBL). The league currently consists of 30 teams, of which 29 are located in the United States and 1 in Canada. Each team plays 82 games in the regular season. After the regular season, eight teams from each of the league&#x27;s two conferences qualify for the playoffs. At the end of the playoffs, the top two teams play each other in the conference finals, to determine the conference champions from each side, who then proceed to play in the NBA Finals. Trophies were given to each conference winner starting in 2001. In 2022, the league started naming an NBA Conference Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) for each conference.

==Overview==
Initially, the BAA teams were aligned into the Eastern Division and the Western Division. The Divisional Finals were first played in , the league&#x27;s third season. The first two seasons used a playoffs format where Eastern and Western Division teams would face each other before the BAA Finals. Hence, there were no divisional finals. In the , the league realigned itself to three divisions, with the addition of the Central Division. However, the arrangement was only used for one season, and the league returned to the two-division format in . The two divisions&#x27; format remained until when the NBA realigned itself into two conferences with two divisions each, which led to the renaming to conference finals. 

The finals were a best-of-3 series from 1949 to 1950, a best-of-5 series from 1951 to 1956, and a best-of-7 series since 1957. The conference finals are currently played in a best-of-7 series like the NBA playoffs and Finals. The two series are played in late May each year after the first and second rounds of the Playoffs and before the Finals. After the conference finals, winners are presented with a silver trophy, caps, and T-shirts and advance to the NBA Finals.

The Los Angeles Lakers have won the most conference titles with 19. They have also made 24 appearances in the conference finals, more than any other team, which included eight consecutive appearances in the Western Conference finals from 1982 to 1989. The Boston Celtics have won 11 conference championships, the second most of any team. 23 of the 30 active franchises have won at least one conference title. The Minnesota Timberwolves, Atlanta Hawks, Sacramento Kings, Memphis Grizzlies and Los Angeles Clippers have each played in at least one conference finals, but have failed to win their respective conference title. Two other franchises, the Charlotte Hornets and New Orleans Pelicans, have never appeared in the conference finals.

==Conference trophies==
The NBA first awarded conference championship trophies in 2001. In 2022, both were redesigned, and named the Bob Cousy Trophy for the Eastern Conference and the Oscar Robertson Trophy for the Western Conference, in honor of two men who were instrumental in developing and advancing the players&#x27; labor union, the National Basketball Players Association. The two redesigned trophies each feature a silver basketball with its respective conference finals logo on the underside. The trophies also have a slightly different base for each conference to help distinguish one from the other; the silver basketball on the Eastern Conference trophy sits on three pegs, while the Western Conference trophy has the basketball on intercrossing circular rings. The silver basketball is quartered into four sections, representing the winning team first qualifying for the playoffs and then advancing through the three playoff rounds. In that same year, the NBA began awarding Conference Finals MVPs to the best-performing player of each Conference Finals: the Larry Bird Eastern Conference Finals Most Valuable Player Award and the Magic Johnson Western Conference Finals Most Valuable Player Award, named for the two players credited for building the league up to greater popularity in the 1980s. The MVP trophies follow a design similar to that of the Bill Russell NBA Finals MVP trophy, only smaller, and the ball on each trophy is silver, instead of gold, and follows the Conference Championship trophies in how it sits on the base.

<doc id="809534" wikidata="Q1058887" url="?curid=809534" title="Breeders' Cup Turf">
<text>The Breeders&#x27; Cup Turf is a Weight for Age Thoroughbred horse race on turf for three-year-olds and up. It is held annually at a different racetrack in the United States or Canada as part of the Breeders&#x27; Cup World Championships. The race&#x27;s current title sponsor is Longines.

The race is run at the European Classic distance of miles, making it one of the most internationally appealing races on the Breeders&#x27; Cup lineup. One of the biggest moments in the race&#x27;s history came in 2018 when Enable became the first horse to win both the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe and Breeders&#x27; Cup Turf in the same year.

The forerunner for this race was the Washington, D.C. International Stakes at Laurel Park Racecourse. Inaugurated in 1952, it was raced on turf at miles and drew the best horses from North America and Europe.

== Automatic berths ==
Beginning in 2007, the Breeders&#x27; Cup developed the Breeders&#x27; Cup Challenge, a series of races in each division that allotted automatic qualifying bids to winners of defined races. Each of the fourteen divisions has multiple qualifying races. Note though that one horse may win multiple challenge races, while other challenge winners will not be entered in the Breeders&#x27; Cup for a variety of reasons such as injury or travel considerations.

In the Turf division, runners are limited to 14 and there are up to 11 automatic berths. The 2022 &quot;Win and You&#x27;re In&quot; races were:
# the Gran Premio Internacional Carlos Pellegrini, a Grade 1 race run in December at Hipódromo de San Isidro in Argentina
# the Grande Prêmio Brasil, a Grade 1 race run in June at Hipódromo da Gávea in Brazil
# the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Stakes, a Group I race run in June at Royal Ascot in England
# the Takarazuka Kinen, a Grade 1 race run in June at Hanshin Racecourse in Japan
# the King George VI &amp; Queen Elizabeth Stakes, a Group 1 race run in July at Ascot Racecourse in England
# the Del Mar Handicap, a Grade 2 race run in August at Del Mar Racetrack in California
# the Sword Dancer, a Grade 1 race run in August at Saratoga Race Course in upstate New York 
# the Irish Champion Stakes, a Group 1 race run in September at Leopardstown Racecourse in Ireland
# the Kentucky Turf Cup, a Grade 2 race run in September at Kentucky Downs in Kentucky
# the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe, a Group 1 race run in October at Longchamps in France

<doc id="809539" wikidata="Q609336" url="?curid=809539" title="Taproot">
<text>A taproot is a large, central, and dominant root from which other roots sprout laterally. Typically a taproot is somewhat straight and very thick, is tapering in shape, and grows directly downward. In some plants, such as the carrot, the taproot is a storage organ so well developed that it has been cultivated as a vegetable.

The taproot system contrasts with the adventitious- or fibrous-root system of plants with many branched roots, but many plants that grow a taproot during germination go on to develop branching root structures, although some that rely on the main root for storage may retain the dominant taproot for centuries—for example, &quot;Welwitschia&quot;.

== Description ==

Dicots, one of the two divisions of flowering plants (angiosperms), start with a taproot, which is one main root forming from the enlarging radicle of the seed. The tap root can be persistent throughout the life of the plant but is most often replaced later in the plant&#x27;s development by a fibrous root system. A persistent taproot system forms when the radicle keeps growing and smaller lateral roots form along the taproot.
The shape of taproots can vary but the typical shapes include:
*Conical root: this type of root tuber is conical in shape, i.e. widest at the top and tapering steadily towards the bottom: e.g. carrot.
*Fusiform root: this root is widest in the middle and tapers towards the top and the bottom: e.g. radish.
*Napiform root: the root has a top-like appearance. It is very broad at the top and tapers suddenly like a tail at the bottom: e.g. turnip.
Many taproots are modified into storage organs.
Some plants with taproots:
*Beetroot
*Burdock
*Carrot
*Sugar beet
*Dandelion
*Parsley
*Parsnip
*Poppy mallow
*Radish
*Sagebrush
*Turnip
*Common milkweed
* trees such as oaks, elms, pines and firs

== Development ==
Taproots develop from the radicle of a seed, forming the primary root. It branches off to secondary roots, which in turn branch to form tertiary roots. These may further branch to form rootlets. For most plants species the radicle dies some time after seed germination, causing the development of a fibrous root system, which lacks a main downward-growing root. Most trees begin life with a taproot, but after one to a few years the main root system changes to a wide-spreading fibrous root system with mainly horizontal-growing surface roots and only a few vertical, deep-anchoring roots. A typical mature tree 30–50 m tall has a root system that extends horizontally in all directions as far as the tree is tall or more, but as much as 100% of the roots are in the top 50 cm of soil.

Soil characteristics strongly influence the architecture of taproots; for example, deep and rich soils favour the development of vertical taproots in many oak species such as &quot;Quercus kelloggii&quot;, while clay soils promote the growth of multiple taproots.

==Horticultural considerations==

Many plants with taproots are difficult to transplant, or even to grow in containers, because the root tends to grow deep rapidly and in many species comparatively slight obstacles or damage to the taproot will stunt or kill the plant. Among weeds with taproots dandelions are typical; being deep-rooted, they are hard to uproot and if the taproot breaks off near the top, the part that stays in the ground often resprouts such that, for effective control, the taproot needs to be severed at least several centimetres below ground level.

<text>Sundance Channel was a Canadian English language Category B specialty channel owned by Corus Entertainment that aired various films.

The channel was founded in 2001 as Drive-In Classics by CHUM Limited, the owner of Citytv, that aired Drive-In B films and other programming related to it. Drive-In Classics was acquired by CTVglobemedia in 2007 and was resold to Corus Entertainment in 2009. 
In March 2010, Drive-In Classics became Sundance Channel which aired programming focused on independent films, documentaries, music series, dramas and more. The channel closed its doors on March 27, 2018.

==History==
===As Drive-In Classics===
In June 2001, CHUM Limited was given approval from the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to launch a national category 2 specialty channel known as &quot;The Drive-In Channel&quot;, with programming described as being centred on &quot;Drive-In B movies and series, as well as occasional magazine-style shows focusing on the genre&quot;. 

The channel was launched only three months later, on September 7, 2001 at 9:00 p.m. EST under the name &quot;Drive-In Classics&quot;, which focused on showing primarily films from the B movie genre, focusing on films popular at the drive-in theatres in the 1950s to 1970s, and a number of television series including &quot;The Hilarious House of Frightenstein&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

Programming on Drive-In Classics were organized into themes including: Martial Arts Mondays - fight-themed movies, Western Wednesdays - Western movies, Steamy Windshields (Fridays) - teenage-themed movies, Horror Marathon (Saturdays) - horror films and Salem&#x27;s Lot, various films picked by host Rob Salem, which was ended on August 30, 2009.

In July 2006, Bell Globemedia announced that it would purchase CHUM for an estimated $1.7 billion CAD, included in the sale was Drive-In Classics. The sale was approved by the CRTC in June 2007, with the transaction completed on June 22, 2007 while the Citytv stations were sold to Rogers Media.

On July 14, 2009, CTVglobemedia announced the sale of Drive-In Classics and to Corus Entertainment for $40 million CAD. Before the sale was approved, Corus announced in late September that they planned to rebrand the channel, but did not give any specific details regarding the rebranding. The sale was approved by the CRTC on November 19.

===As Sundance Channel===
On December 8, 2009, Corus announced that Drive-In Classics would be rebranded as a Canadian version of Sundance Channel (now known as SundanceTV) on March 1, 2010 under an agreement with the American channel&#x27;s owner, AMC Networks (formerly known as &quot;Rainbow Media Holdings, LLC&quot;, a subsidiary of Cablevision), which would not own any stake in the Canadian channel. The channel was rebranded on March 1, 2010 as planned, focusing its programming on independent films, documentaries, scripted drams and comedies, and musical performances.

In February 2018, a notice was posted on Sundance Channel&#x27;s website that the channel was closed on March 1, 2018. Shortly after this, the channel space that was created by Drive-In Classics in 2001 simply ceased to exist. The CRTC revoked the channel&#x27;s broadcast license on March 27, 2018.

<doc id="809560" wikidata="Q1566435" url="?curid=809560" title="Marina Oswald Porter">
<text>Marina Nikolayevna Oswald Porter (; born July 17, 1941) is a Russian–American former pharmacist who was the wife of Lee Harvey Oswald. Born in the Soviet Union in 1941, she immigrated to the United States after marrying United States Marine Corps veteran Lee Harvey Oswald during his temporary defection to the Soviet Bloc. After the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy and Oswald&#x27;s murder, Marina testified against Oswald for the Warren Commission and married American electronics worker Kenneth Jess Porter, becoming a naturalized United States citizen. She has a son with Porter and two daughters from her previous marriage with Oswald. Although Marina initially supported the Warren Commission&#x27;s findings, she ultimately expressed doubts and advocated for Oswald&#x27;s innocence.

==Early life and education==
Porter was born Marina Nikolayevna Prusakova () in the city of Molotovsk (now Severodvinsk), at the time in the Russian SFSR of the Soviet Union and today in the Arkhangelsk Oblast of the Russian Federation. She lived there with her mother and stepfather until 1957, when she moved to Minsk in the Byelorussian SSR to live with her uncle Ilya Prusakov, who was a colonel in the country&#x27;s Ministry of Internal Affairs. While in Minsk, she studied pharmacy.

==Marriage to Lee Harvey Oswald==

Marina met Lee Harvey Oswald (a former U.S. Marine who had defected to the Soviet Union) at a dance on March 17, 1961. They married six weeks later and had a daughter, June Lee Oswald, born the following year. In June 1962, the family immigrated to the United States and settled in Dallas, Texas. At a party in February 1963, George de Mohrenschildt introduced the couple to Ruth Paine, a Quaker and Russian language student.

In January 1963, Oswald mail-ordered a Smith &amp; Wesson .38 revolver and then, in March, a Mannlicher–Carcano, the John F. Kennedy assassination rifle. Later that month, as Marina told the Warren Commission, she took photographs of Oswald dressed in black and holding his weapons along with an issue of &quot;The Militant&quot; newspaper, which named ex-general Edwin Walker as a &quot;fascist.&quot;

These photos became known as the &quot;backyard photos&quot; of Lee Oswald, which some conspiracy theorists dismiss as fake. Two photographs were later found in the garage of the Paine household. A third one was in the possession of George de Mohrenschildt. 

The photo that had been given to de Mohrenschildt was signed and dated by Lee Oswald on April 5, 1963, five days before the attempted assassination of General Walker. de Mohrenschildt eventually revealed this photograph to the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) in 1977, shortly before committing suicide. It is similar to the photo published by &quot;LIFE&quot; magazine in early 1964, except that it has a much more extensive background. The image also has a quote in Russian, the translation of which reads, &quot;Hunter of Fascists, Ha-Ha-Ha!!!&quot; 

In April 1963, Marina and her daughter moved in with Ruth Paine (who had recently separated from her husband, Michael). Lee Oswald rented a separate room in Dallas and briefly moved to New Orleans during the summer of 1963. He returned to Dallas in early October, eventually renting a room in a boarding house in the Oak Cliff neighborhood of Dallas.

Ruth Paine learned from a neighbor that employment was available at the Texas School Book Depository, and Oswald was hired and began working there on October 16, 1963, as an order filler. On October 18, Marina and Ruth Paine had planned a birthday party for Oswald. They put up some decorations and got a birthday cake and wine. Oswald was so moved by the gesture that he had tears in his eyes. He remained emotional throughout the evening, crying and apologizing to Marina for everything he had put her through. On October 20, Marina gave birth to a second daughter, Audrey Marina Rachel Oswald at Parkland Memorial Hospital. Her husband continued to live in Oak Cliff on weekdays, but stayed with her at the Paine household in Irving on weekends, an arrangement that continued until Oswald was arrested for the assassination of President Kennedy.

=== Assassination of John F. Kennedy ===
Marina learned of the assassination of John F. Kennedy from the media coverage of the event and, later, of the arrest of her husband. That afternoon, Dallas Police Department detectives arrived at the Paine household, and when asked if Lee owned a rifle, Marina gestured to the garage, where Oswald stored his rifle rolled up in a blanket; no rifle was found. She was subsequently questioned both at the Paine household and later at Dallas Police Department headquarters about her husband&#x27;s involvement in the death of John F. Kennedy and the murder of Dallas police officer J. D. Tippit. Marina and Oswald&#x27;s mother Marguerite Oswald arrived at Dallas City Hall in the evening. Marina was shown the rifle by Carl Day and said in her statement that she was not sure whether the rifle shown to her was Lee&#x27;s. Captain J. W. Fritz of the Homicide and Robbery Bureau stated in a report that Marina did not positively ID the rifle. On the afternoon of November 23, Marina and Marguerite talked to Lee. Marina said that when she saw her husband, he was calm, but &quot;by his eyes I could tell that he was afraid. He said goodbye to me with his eyes. I knew that.&quot;

Marina was widowed at age 22, on November 24, when Oswald was murdered by Jack Ruby. Marina asked to go to Parkland Hospital to see Oswald&#x27;s body. She opened his eyelids and said, &quot;He cry, he eye wet.&quot; 

Marina came to live in a hotel with business adviser, James H. Martin, who said that were &quot;a few threats on her life mixed with the thousands of letters of sympathy she has received&quot;. After the assassination of Kennedy and the arrest of her husband, Marina was under Secret Service protection until she completed her testimony before the Warren Commission. She testified that she &quot;had never heard anything bad about Kennedy from Lee&quot; and that while in Russia, Oswald told her he would vote for Governor John Connally when he returned to the United States. In her testimony, she stated her belief that her husband was guilty, an opinion she reiterated in testimony before the House Select Committee on Assassinations in 1978, where she claimed that Oswald&#x27;s motivation was not political.

==Later life==
Following the assassination, Marina rented a house in Richardson, Texas, a suburb of Dallas, where she also found work as a drugstore clerk. Donations sent to her by anonymous donors totaled about $70,000, roughly . She sold Lee&#x27;s Russian diary for $20,000 and a picture of him holding the rifle for $5,000. She also attempted, but failed, to gain possession of the gun to sell it. Marina refused to change her name and received various marriage proposals. She worried about her children and said her sympathy lay with Mrs. Kennedy, stating, &quot;It&#x27;s hard enough to lose a bad husband...I wonder how it is to lose a good one.&quot; In November 1964, Marina Oswald became increasingly tense and morose, and she checked into a hospital for nervous exhaustion.

In January 1965, Marina enrolled at the University of Michigan, but she later returned to the Dallas area and bought a house in Richardson. In 1981, Marina had Oswald&#x27;s body exhumed to refute a claim that a look-alike Russian Soviet agent was buried in place of Oswald. In 1989, she became a naturalized United States citizen.

=== Marriage to Kenneth Jess Porter ===
On June 1, 1965, she and electronics worker Kenneth Jess Porter travelled to Fate, Texas, and were wed by a justice of the peace. They had a son. She later accused Kenneth of domestic violence. Marina moved to Rockwall, Texas, with her husband and family, and they generally avoided publicity. On October 8, 2024, Kenneth died in their family home at the age of 86.

===Support for Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories===
Though she has not formally recanted any of her Warren Commission testimony, stating that she wanted to initially deny the possibility of her husband&#x27;s guilt, Marina has said, in various interviews since the late 1980s, that she came to believe that Oswald was completely innocent of the murders of President Kennedy and Officer Tippit, and that she believed Oswald worked for the government. Jim Martin, her manager, said that he felt that despite her testifying against him, he felt that she did not &quot;really think she thought he was guilty&quot;. Jim Leavelle, the Dallas Police detective who was handcuffed to Oswald when Ruby shot him, had several meals from time to time with Marina and said that Marina would &quot;sound him out&quot; to see if he had any doubts on Oswald&#x27;s guilt. In 2018, Marina was contacted for the theory that the unidentified &quot;prayer man&quot; filmed on the steps of the Texas School Book Depository during the assassination by Dave Wiegman, Jr., of NBC, and James Darnell, of WBAP-TV, was Oswald. Ed Ledoux phoned Marina after Stan Dane had sent enlargements of the Darnell and Wiegman films showing the &quot;prayer man&quot; figure. An unprompted Marina volunteered, &quot;It&#x27;s Lee&quot;. She maintains her belief that Oswald was the &quot;prayer man&quot;.

Marina&#x27;s daughters also gave a few interviews, in which they expressed scepticism regarding Oswald&#x27;s guilt though they also say they just want to know the truth. In a 1995 interview with the New York Times, June Oswald, the Oswald&#x27;s oldest child, said when asked on the matter of her father&#x27;s guilt or innocence: &quot;It would make a difference in the sense of justice being served. If the truth can be found that shows Lee had nothing to do with the assassina­tion, I would feel better in that there have been a lot of things said and done regarding my family that all proceeded from an erroneous per­ception of what he did or didn&#x27;t do.&quot;

<text>Linklaters LLP is a British multinational law firm, headquartered in London, England. Founded in 1838, it is one of the four prestigious &quot;Magic Circle&quot; law firms known for their corporate and financial expertise. It currently employs over 3100 lawyers across 31 offices in 21 countries.

In financial year 2023-24, Linklaters achieved revenues of £2.1 billion and average profits per equity partner of £1.9 million. In the UK, the firm has top-tier rankings across many practice areas, including corporate/M&amp;A, capital markets, litigation, banking and finance, restructuring and insolvency, antitrust and tax. In 2021, Linklaters was ranked second for the number of FTSE 100 clients. For direct deals by institutional investors in the first half of 2016, Linklaters tied for first place. In the 2021 Global Law Firm Brand Index, Linklaters was named as having the world&#x27;s fourth strongest brand.

==History==
Linklaters was founded in London in 1838 when John Linklater entered into a partnership with Julius Dods. The firm, initially known as Dods &amp; Linklater, developed a practice in corporate law, including advising on the creation of the Metropolitan Water Board.

On 4 May 1920, the firm, then known as Linklater &amp; Co, merged with another renowned London firm, Paines Blythe &amp; Huxtable, which had been founded by a descendant of Thomas Paine.

For most of the twentieth century, Linklaters &amp; Paines was predominately a domestic corporate law firm, with only a small number of overseas offices. However, in 1998, Linklaters &amp; Alliance was created in partnership with many of Europe&#x27;s leading law firms, including De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek in Amsterdam, De Bandt van Hecke Lagae in Brussels, Loesch &amp; Wolter in Luxembourg, Lagerlöf &amp; Leman in Stockholm and Oppenhoff &amp; Rädler in Germany. Over the next five years, Linklaters &amp; Paines merged with the last four of these Alliance firms, as well as several other European firms, in Belgium, Luxembourg, Sweden, Germany, Czech Republic and Poland. The firm opened new offices in Amsterdam, Bangkok, Beijing, Budapest, Bucharest, Bratislava, Lisbon, Madrid, Milan, Rome, São Paulo, and Shanghai. In 1999, amid this global expansion, the firm shortened its name to Linklaters.

On 1 April 2005, after Japan enacted laws to allow certain international law firms to open offices in the country, Linklaters created Japan&#x27;s first fully merged law firm practising Japanese, English and US law.

Linklaters spun off its offices in Bratislava, Bucharest, Budapest and Prague into a separate firm, Kinstellar (an anagram of Linklaters) in 2007. In the aftermath of the credit crunch in 2008, Linklaters cut 270 jobs in London, consisting of around 120 lawyers and 150 other staff. This was reported to be part of managing partner Simon Davies&#x27; plan to become a smaller, more profitable organisation. By 2008, Linklaters had the highest gross revenue of any firm in the world, $2.4 billion, buoyed by work including the firm&#x27;s role as advisor to Lehman Brothers and its world number one ranking for deals by total value.

On 1 May 2012, Linklaters entered into an integrated alliance with Australian law firm Allens. Allens and Linklaters operate two joint ventures in Asia: one focused on energy, resources and infrastructure services, and another on Indonesia in collaboration with domestic firm Widyawan &amp; Partners. On 1 February 2013, the firm entered into an alliance with leading South African law firm Webber Wentzel.

Linklaters also has a best-friend arrangement with Talwar Thakore &amp; Associates, a leading Indian law firm. Furthermore, since 2017 the firm has operated in Saudi Arabia in agreement with Zamakhchary &amp; Co. In 2018, the firm partnered with newly established Zhao Sheng Law Firm in order to practise mainland Chinese law. The joint operation currently has offices in the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone and in Beijing.

In 2021, Linklaters opened an office in Dublin, structured as a separate partnership called &quot;Linklaters &amp; Co&quot;, which provides advice on EU law but not Irish domestic law.

By 2022, Linklaters had advised on more mergers and acquisitions involving Russian groups than any other major law firm. After Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the firm was the first major law firm to announce it would end its business in Russia.

==Offices==
Linklaters was founded and remains headquartered in London. As of 2021, the firm has 30 offices across 20 countries throughout Asia, the Middle East, North America, South America, and Europe.

<doc id="809625" wikidata="Q3005427" url="?curid=809625" title="Documentary Channel (Canadian TV channel)">
<text>Documentary Channel (stylized as &quot;documentary channel&quot;) is a Canadian English language Category A specialty channel owned by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the National Film Board of Canada and four other independent producers. Its programming is devoted to featuring primarily documentary films along with documentary-style television series.

==History==
Licensed as &quot;The Canadian Documentary Channel&quot; on November 24, 2000 by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), it was launched as the Documentary Channel on September 7, 2001 under the majority ownership of Corus Entertainment through their YTV Canada Inc. subsidiary (53%), the CBC (29%), the NFB (14%), and the following film producers at 1% each: Omni Film Productions, Cinenova Productions, Barna-Alper Productions, and Galafilm.

On May 11, 2006, Corus Entertainment announced that it would sell its 53% majority stake in the service to the CBC, bringing the CBC&#x27;s interest to 82% from its former 29%. Corus decided to sell its interest in the service because it stated documentaries were considered a non-core asset and it wanted to further focus its attention on core assets: kids and family, women&#x27;s lifestyle, and films. On June 22, 2007, the CRTC approved the deal and the transaction was completed.

On March 27, 2008 at 12:01 a.m. EST, the Documentary Channel changed its name to simply documentary, along with a new logo and on-air graphics.

In October 2013, Neil Tabatznik purchased eOne Television&#x27;s interest (who gained ownership in the channel when it purchased Barna-Alper Productions in January 2008) in the channel.

In 2016, the CBC rebranded the channel again, slightly modifying the logo to introduce the word &quot;channel&quot;, renaming it back to documentary Channel.

==Documentary Channel HD==
On April 1, 2011 the CBC launched a high definition feed of Documentary Channel, simulcasting the standard definition feed. It is available on Bell Satellite TV, Cogeco, Rogers Cable, EastLink, Bell Fibe TV, Bell MTS, Optik TV, SaskTel, and Shaw Direct.

<doc id="809629" wikidata="Q917440" url="?curid=809629" title="Renaissance philosophy">
<text>The designation &quot;Renaissance philosophy&quot; is used by historians of philosophy to refer to the thought of the period running in Europe roughly between 1400 and 1600. It therefore overlaps both with late medieval philosophy, which in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries was influenced by notable figures such as Albert the Great, Thomas Aquinas, William of Ockham, and Marsilius of Padua, and early modern philosophy, which conventionally starts with René Descartes and his publication of the &quot;Discourse on Method&quot; in 1637.

== Continuities ==
The structure, sources, method, and topics of philosophy in the Renaissance had much in common with those of previous centuries.

=== Structure of philosophy ===
Particularly since the recovery of a great portion of Aristotelian writings in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, it became clear that, in addition to Aristotle&#x27;s writings on logic, which had already been known, there were numerous others roughly having to do with natural philosophy, moral philosophy, and metaphysics. These areas provided the structure for the philosophy curriculum of the emerging universities. The general assumption was that the most &#x27;scientific&#x27; branches of philosophy were those that were more theoretical and therefore more widely applicable. During the Renaissance too, many thinkers saw these as the main philosophical areas, with logic providing a training of the mind to approach the other three.

=== Sources of philosophy ===
A similar continuity can be seen in the case of sources. Although Aristotle was never an unquestioned authority (he was more often than not a springboard for discussion, and his opinions were often discussed along those of others, or the teaching of Holy Scripture), medieval lectures in physics consisted of reading Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Physics&quot;, lessons in moral philosophy consisted of examinations of his &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; (and often his &quot;Politics&quot;), and metaphysics was approached through his &quot;Metaphysics&quot;. The assumption that Aristotle&#x27;s works were foundational to an understanding of philosophy did not wane during the Renaissance, which saw a flourishing of new translations, commentaries, and other interpretations of his works, both in Latin and in the vernacular. After the Reformation, Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; continued to be the main authority for the discipline of ethics at Protestant universities until the late seventeenth century, with over fifty Protestant commentaries published on the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; before 1682.

In terms of method, philosophy was considered during the late Middle Ages as a subject that required robust enquiry on the part of people trained in the subject&#x27;s technical vocabulary. Philosophical texts and problems were typically approached through university lectures and &#x27;questions&#x27;. The latter, similar in some ways to modern debates, examined the pros and cons of particular philosophical positions or interpretations. They were one of the cornerstones of the &#x27;scholastic method&#x27;, made students who proposed or responded to questions quick on their feet, and required a deep familiarity with all of the known philosophical tradition, which would often be invoked in support of or against specific arguments. This style of philosophy continued to have a strong following in the Renaissance. Pico della Mirandola&#x27;s &quot;Disputations&quot;, for instance, depended directly on this tradition, which was not at all limited to university lecture halls.
=== Topics in philosophy ===

Given the remarkable range of Aristotelian philosophy, it was possible to discuss all kinds of issues in medieval and Renaissance philosophy. Aristotle had treated directly problems such as the trajectory of missiles, the habits of animals, how knowledge is acquired, the freedom of the will, how virtue is connected with happiness, the relationship of the lunar and the sublunar worlds. Indirectly he had stimulated discussion on two points that were particularly of concern to Christians: the immortality of the soul and the eternity of the world. All of these continued to be of considerable interest to Renaissance thinkers, but we shall see that in some cases the solutions offered were significantly different because of changing cultural and religious landscapes.

==Discontinuities ==
Having established that many aspects of philosophy were held in common during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, it will now be useful to discuss in what areas changes were afoot. The same outline as above will be used, to show that within trends of continuity one can also find surprising differences.

=== Sources of philosophy ===
It is therefore useful to reconsider what was mentioned above about philosophical sources. The Renaissance saw a significant broadening of source material. Plato, known directly only through two and a half dialogues in the Middle Ages, came to be known through numerous Latin translations in fifteenth century Italy, culminating in the hugely influential translation of his complete works by Marsilio Ficino in Florence in 1484. Petrarch was not able to read Plato directly, but he greatly admired him. Petrarch was also a great admirer of Roman poets such as Virgil and Horace and of Cicero for Latin prose writing. Not all Renaissance humanists followed his example in all things, but Petrarch contributed to a broadening of his time&#x27;s &#x27;canon&#x27; (pagan poetry had previously been considered frivolous and dangerous), something that happened in philosophy as well. In the sixteenth century anyone who considered himself &#x27;au fait&#x27; read Plato as well as Aristotle, trying as much as possible (and not always very successfully) to reconcile the two with each other and with Christianity. This is probably the main reason why Donato Acciaiuoli&#x27;s commentary on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Ethics&quot; (first published in 1478) was so successful: it blended the three traditions beautifully.

Other movements from ancient philosophy also re-entered the mainstream. While this was seldom the case for Epicureanism, which was largely caricatured and considered with suspicion, Pyrrhonism and Academic Skepticism made a comeback thanks to philosophers such as Michel de Montaigne, and Neostoicism became a popular movement due to the writings of Justus Lipsius. In all of these cases it is impossible to separate the pagan philosophical doctrines from the Christian filter through which they were approached and made legitimate.

=== Structure of philosophy ===

While generally the Aristotelian structure of the branches of philosophy stayed in place, interesting developments and tensions were taking place within them. In moral philosophy, for instance, a position consistently held by Thomas Aquinas and his numerous followers was that its three subfields (ethics, economics, politics) were related to progressively wider spheres (the individual, the family and the community). Politics, Thomas thought, is more important than ethics because it considers the good of the greater number. This position came under increasing strain in the Renaissance, as various thinkers claimed that Thomas&#x27;s classifications were inaccurate, and that ethics were the most important part of morality.

Other important figures, such as Francesco Petrarca (Petrarch) (1304–1374), questioned the whole assumption that the theoretical aspects of philosophy were the more important ones. He insisted, for instance, on the value of the practical aspects of ethics. Petrarch&#x27;s position, expressed both strongly and amusingly in his invective &quot;On His Own Ignorance and That of Many Others&quot; (&quot;De sui ipsius ac multorum ignorantia&quot;) is also important for another reason: it represents the conviction that philosophy should let itself be guided by rhetoric, that the purpose of philosophy is therefore not so much to reveal the truth, but to encourage people to pursue the good. This perspective, so typical of Italian humanism, could easily lead to reducing all philosophy to ethics, in a move reminiscent of Plato&#x27;s Socrates and of Cicero.

=== Method of philosophy ===
If, as mentioned above, scholasticism continued to flourish, the Italian humanists (i.e., lovers and practitioners of the humanities) challenged its supremacy. As we have seen, they believed that philosophy could be brought under the wing of rhetoric. They also thought that the scholarly discourse of their time needed to return to the elegance and precision of its classical models. They therefore tried dressing philosophy in a more appealing garb than had their predecessors, whose translations and commentaries were in technical Latin and sometimes simply transliterated the Greek. In 1416–1417, Leonardo Bruni, the pre-eminent humanist of his time and chancellor of Florence, re-translated Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Ethics&quot; into a more flowing, idiomatic and classical Latin. He hoped to communicate the elegance of Aristotle&#x27;s Greek while also making the text more accessible to those without a philosophical education. Others, including Nicolò Tignosi in Florence around 1460, and the Frenchman Jacques Lefèvre d&#x27;Étaples in Paris in the 1490s, tried to please the humanists either by including in their commentaries on Aristotle appealing historical examples or quotations from poetry, or by avoiding the standard scholastic format of questions, or both.
The driving conviction was that philosophy should be freed of its technical jargon so that more people would be able to read it. At the same time, all kinds of summaries, paraphrases, and dialogues dealing with philosophical issues were prepared, in order to give their topics a wider dissemination. Humanists also encouraged the study of Aristotle and other writers of antiquity in the original. Desiderius Erasmus, the great Dutch humanist, even prepared a Greek edition of Aristotle, and eventually those teaching philosophy in the universities had to at least pretend that they knew Greek. Humanists were not, however, great fans of the vernacular. There is only a handful of examples of dialogues or translations of Aristotle&#x27;s works into Italian during the fifteenth century. Once it had been determined, however, that Italian was a language with literary merit and that it could carry the weight of philosophical discussion, numerous efforts in this direction started to appear, particularly from the 1540s onward. Alessandro Piccolomini had a programme to translate or paraphrase the entire Aristotelian corpus into the vernacular.

Other important figures were Benedetto Varchi, Bernardo Segni and Giambattista Gelli, all of them active in Florence. Efforts got underway to present Plato&#x27;s doctrines in the vernacular as well. This rise of vernacular philosophy, which quite predated the Cartesian approach, is a new field of research whose contours are only now beginning to be clarified.

=== Topics in philosophy ===
It is very hard to generalize about the ways in which discussions of philosophical topics shifted in the Renaissance, mainly because to do so requires a detailed map of the period, something we do not yet have. We know that debates about the freedom of the will continued to flare up (for instance, in the famous exchanges between Erasmus and Martin Luther), that Spanish thinkers were increasingly obsessed with the notion of nobility, that duelling was a practice that generated a large literature in the sixteenth century (was it permissible or not?).

Earlier histories gave perhaps undue attention to Pietro Pomponazzi&#x27;s pronouncements on the immortality of the soul as a question that could not be resolved philosophically in a way consistent with Christianity, or to Pico della Mirandola&#x27;s &quot;Oration on the Dignity of Man&quot;, as if these were signals of the period&#x27;s increasing secularism or even atheism. In fact, the most successful compendium of natural philosophy in the period (&quot;Compendium philosophiae naturalis&quot;, first published in 1530) was authored by Frans Titelmans, a Franciscan friar from the Low Countries whose work has a very strong religious flavour. We must not forget that most philosophers of the time were at least nominal, if not devout, Christians, that the sixteenth century saw both the Protestant and the Catholic reformations, and that Renaissance philosophy culminates with the period of the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648). In other words, religion had a massive importance in the period, and one can hardly study philosophy without remembering this.
This is true among others for the philosophy of Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499), who reinterpreted Plato in the light of his early Greek commentators and also of Christianity. Ficino hoped that a purified philosophy would bring about a religious renewal in his society and therefore transformed distasteful aspects of Platonic philosophy (for instance, the homosexual love exalted in the Symposium) into spiritual love (i.e., Platonic love), something later transformed by Pietro Bembo and Baldassare Castiglione in the early sixteenth century as something also applicable to relationships between men and women. Ficino and his followers also had an interest in &#x27;hidden knowledge&#x27;, mainly because of his belief that all of ancient knowledge was interconnected (Moses, for instance, had received his insights from the Greeks, who in turn had received them from others, all according to God&#x27;s plan and therefore mutually consistent; Hermeticism is relevant here). Although Ficino&#x27;s interest in and practice of astrology was not uncommon in his time, one should not necessarily associate it with philosophy, as the two were usually considered to be quite separate and often in contradiction with each other.

In conclusion, like any other moment in the history of thought Renaissance philosophy cannot be considered to have provided something entirely new nor to have continued for centuries to repeat the conclusions of its predecessors. Historians call this period the &#x27;Renaissance&#x27; in order to indicate the rebirth that took place of ancient (particularly classical) perspectives, sources, attitudes toward literature and the arts. At the same time, we realize that every re-appropriation is constrained and even guided by contemporary concerns and biases. It was no different for the period considered here: the old was mixed with and changed by the new, but while no claims can be made for a revolutionary new starting point in philosophy, in many ways the synthesis of Christianity, Aristotelianism, and Platonism offered by Thomas Aquinas was torn apart in order to make way for a new one, based on more complete and varied sources, often in the original, and certainly attuned to new social and religious realities and a much broader public.

<text>The Sukhoi Su-15 (NATO reporting name: Flagon) is a twinjet supersonic interceptor aircraft developed by the Soviet Union. It entered service in 1965 and remained one of the front-line designs into the 1990s. The Su-15 was designed to replace the Sukhoi Su-11 and Sukhoi Su-9, which were becoming obsolete as NATO introduced newer and more capable strategic bombers.

==Development==
Recognizing the limitations of the earlier Su-9 and Su-11 in intercepting the new Boeing B-52 Stratofortress, particularly in terms of radar and aircraft performance, the Sukhoi OKB quickly began the development of a heavily revised and more capable aircraft. A variety of development aircraft evolved, including the Sukhoi T-49, which shared the fuselage of the Su-9 (including its single engine), but used cheek-mounted intakes to leave the nose clear for a large radome for the RP-22 Oryol-D (&quot;Eagle&quot;) radar (NATO &quot;Skip Spin&quot;), and the T-5, essentially a heavily modified Su-11 with a widened rear fuselage containing two Tumansky R-11 engines.

These led to the T-58, which combined the twin engines with a modified version of the T-49&#x27;s nose, but with side inlets further back, behind the cockpit. It was approved for production on 5 February 1962, as the Su-15, and the prototype first flew on 30 May 1962. It entered service testing 5 August 1963, but its service entry was delayed by political infighting with the Yakovlev OKB over production line capacity in Novosibirsk, which was also building the Yak-28P. The Su-15 proved to be superior in most respects other than range, and it was officially commissioned on 3 April 1965. Series production began the following year, and it entered service with the PVO in 1967, replacing Su-9s, Su-11s, and Yakovlev Yak-25s. The initial Su-15 received the NATO reporting name &quot;Flagon-A&quot;. A simplified trainer version, the Su-15UT (NATO &quot;Flagon-C&quot;), with no radar or combat capability, entered service in 1970.

Initial delta-winged Su-15s had poor take-off and landing characteristics, and so Sukhoi investigated a new wing design with extended wingtips (increasing wing area) and boundary layer control. Su-15s with the new wing went into production in 1969. They were dubbed &quot;Flagon-D&quot; by NATO, although the Soviet designation was unchanged.

Also in 1969 testing began of the upgraded Su-15T with the Volkov Taifun (&quot;Typhoon&quot;) radar, which was based on the MiG-25&#x27;s powerful RP-25 Smerch-A (&quot;Tornado&quot;) radar (NATO &quot;Foxfire&quot;). The Taifun proved troublesome, however, and ceased production after only 10 aircraft had been built. It was followed in December 1971 by the Su-15TM (NATO &quot;Flagon-E&quot;), with the improved Taifun-M radar (NATO &quot;Twin Scan&quot;) and provision for UPK-23-250 gun pod or R-60 (AA-8 &quot;Aphid&quot;) short-range air-to-air missiles. Aerodynamic demands forced a redesign of the radome with an ogival shape, earning a new NATO reporting name, &quot;Flagon-F&quot;, although again the Soviet designation did not change. A comparable combat-capable trainer, the Su-15UM (NATO &quot;Flagon-G&quot;), followed from 1976. The final Su-15UMs, the last Su-15s produced, came off the line in 1979.

Various OKB proposals for upgraded Su-15s with better engines and aerodynamics to satisfy a VVS requirement for a long-range tactical fighter were rejected in favour of the Mikoyan MiG-23 fighter.

==Design==

Although many components of the Su-15 were similar or identical to the previous Su-9 and Su-11, including Sukhoi&#x27;s characteristic rear-fuselage air brake, the Su-15 abandoned the shock-inlet cone nose intake for side-mounted intake ramps with splitter plates feeding two powerful turbojet engines, initially the Tumansky R-11F2S-300. The change allowed room in the nose for a powerful search radar, initially the RP-22 Oryol-D (NATO &#x27;Skip Spin&#x27;). The early Su-15 (&quot;Flagon-A&quot;) had pure delta wings like its predecessors, but these were replaced from the 11th production series onward by a new double-delta wing of increased span and area, with a small wing fence above each outer pylon and blown flaps to improve landing characteristics. This was accompanied by a new tail of greater anhedral and a vertical fin of reduced height.

The Su-15 had maximum speed of Mach 2.5 and a rate of climb of 228 m/s (750 ft/s, 45,000 ft/min), a very important parameter for an interceptor aircraft. Take-off and landing speeds were comparatively high, with a take-off speed of for early delta-winged &#x27;Flagon-A&#x27;s and for the larger-winged &#x27;Flagon-F&#x27;. While the controls were responsive and precise, the aircraft was unforgiving of pilot error.

Despite its powerful radar, the Su-15, like most Soviet interceptors before the late 1980s, was heavily dependent on ground control interception (GCI), with aircraft vectored onto targets by ground radar stations. It was fitted with the Lazur-S datalink system, which transmitted instructions to the pilot to accomplish the interception. The later Su-15TM had a Vozdukh-1M datalink and SAU-58 (&quot;sistema automaticheskogo upravleniya&quot;, automatic control system) capable of carrying out completely automatic, &#x27;hands-off&#x27; interceptions until the last moments of the interception.

Primary armament of the Su-15 was the R-8/K-8 (AA-3 &quot;Anab&quot;; later R-98) air-to-air missile. Early models carried two missiles, but &#x27;Flagon-D&#x27; and later versions could carry four. Like most Soviet missiles, the R-98 was made in both infrared and semi-active radar homing versions, and standard practice was to fire the weapons in pairs (one semi-active radar homing, one IR homing) to give the greatest chance of a successful hit. The IR homing missile was normally fired first in order to prevent the possibility of the IR missile locking on to the radar homing missile. Later &#x27;Flagon-F&#x27; models often carried two R-98s and one or two pairs of short-range R-60 (AA-8 &#x27;Aphid&#x27;) missiles. Late-model &#x27;Flagons&#x27; also sometimes carried a pair of UPK-23-250 23 mm gun pods on the fuselage pylons, each containing a two-barrel GSh-23L cannon.

==Operational history==
The Su-15 formed a significant part of the V-PVO&#x27;s interceptor force, and was designed to intercept easier targets such as the American B-52 and U-2 and the British V bombers, leaving the more difficult targets such as the XB-70 and B-58 to the faster MiG-25P. The Taifun radar of the Su-15TM was optimised for counter-countermeasure operation, as opposed to range. As an interceptor, the task of the Su-15TM was to fly under autopilot, using GCI commands sent through the datalink. The radar would only be turned on as the interceptor approached the target in order to provide targeting parameters for the radar homing K-8/R-8/R-98 missiles, the high power of the radar allowing it to &#x27;burn through&#x27; enemy ECM signals. If all else failed, IR homing versions of the K-8 would provide a last opportunity to shoot down the intruder, along with any gun pods the Su-15 might be carrying.

The Su-15 was optimised for the high-altitude interception role with its fast climb-rate and high speed at high altitude but lacked look-down/shoot-down capability, even with the Su-15TM&#x27;s more sophisticated Taifun radar. This eventually led to the MiG-23P, which did have look-down/shoot-down capability, becoming the preferred asset of the V-PVO, especially once NATO switched to low-level penetration tactics. Even so, the Su-15 remained an important part of the V-PVO until the fall of the Soviet Union.

As one of the V-PVO&#x27;s principal interceptors, the Su-15 was involved in several attacks on foreign aircraft that inadvertently crossed into Soviet airspace: 
* In 1978, Korean Air Lines Flight 902 veered into Soviet airspace and was attacked over Murmansk by a PVO Su-15. Although the civilian aircraft survived the missile hit, two passengers were killed, and the damaged plane subsequently made a forced landing on a frozen lake.
* In 1981, a Soviet Su-15, from a base in Georgia, collided with a Canadair CL-44 of Transporte Aéreo Rioplatense (TAP; Argentinian airline), killing the three Argentinians and one Briton on board. The TAP aircraft was allegedly transporting weapons bought secretly from Israel by Iran, when it allegedly strayed into Soviet airspace. While some aviation experts believed the collision was accidental, the Soviet Su-15 pilot claimed that he had been deliberately rammed.
* In the Korean Air Lines Flight 007 incident in 1983, a South Korean Boeing 747 was fired upon near Moneron Island, after it veered into restricted Soviet airspace, by a Su-15TM based on Sakhalin, with the 747&#x27;s control surfaces having been disabled as a result of a direct hit to the aircraft&#x27;s tail. The crippled airliner then crashed into the Sea of Japan off the coast of Moneron, killing all 246 passengers and 23 crew.

The Su-15 was also credited with shooting down five reconnaissance balloons sent to spy on Soviet territory in 1975.

Although it was produced in large numbers (1,290 of all types), the Su-15, like other highly sensitive Soviet aircraft, was never exported to the Warsaw Pact or any other country due to its sophisticated systems. Some Su-15 were reported to be deployed in Egypt in 1972 but were used with Soviet crews. At one point, the Su-15 was considered for use as a strike fighter, but proved to be too specialised as an interceptor to be used in that role.

After the fall of the Soviet Union, the Su-15 was abruptly retired from the new Russian Air Force in 1993 to comply with the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. Most were hastily scrapped in favour of more advanced interceptors, including the Su-27 and MiG-31, but some are in reserve storage for emergency use. In Ukraine, the last Su-15s (at Kramatorsk and Belbek) were withdrawn from use in 1996.

<doc id="809643" wikidata="Q6530303" url="?curid=809643" title="Leschi, Seattle">
<text>Leschi is a neighborhood in the city of Seattle, Washington, United States. Located on the western shore of Lake Washington, the residential neighborhood was named by its 19th-century developer for Chief Leschi of the Nisqually tribe, who was executed by territorial authorities in 1858 in Pierce County, Washington.

== Location ==
The Leschi neighborhood is bordered by Lake Washington on the east, Interstate 90 on the south, beyond which is Mount Baker, Martin Luther King Jr. Way on the west, beyond which is the Central District and East Cherry Street on the north, beyond which is Madrona.

== Homes ==
Residences in Leschi include condominiums (especially along the lake), refurbished bungalows and craftsman, contemporary styles, bricks, Tudors and mid-century ramblers. Curvy streets wind away up the hill from the lakefront, which means many residences get at least a partial lake view. The &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; described Leschi as &quot;not an exclusive enclave for the rich, despite its million-dollar lakefront homes&quot; and a &quot;home to a racially and economically diverse group of people.&quot; The area &quot;mix[es] stately turn-of-the century houses with far more modest homes&quot;.

== Parks ==

There are many parks, including the popular Leschi lakeside park and other pocket parks spread throughout the neighborhood. Notable neighborhood parks include Frink Park, Flo Ware Park, Powell Barnett Park, and the &quot;String of Pearls&quot;, which refers to a &quot;series of mini parks along Lake Washington at the end of east/west streets that run right to the lake.&quot;

According to legend, Leschi Park was a campsite of Chief Leschi of the Nisqually tribe. Chief Leschi was executed for his participation in the Battle of Seattle and the Yakima Wars (1855-1858). The 1854 treaty which took away native lands led to an attack on the settlement in 1856. Many tribe members and two settlers were killed, and Leschi was subsequently tortured and hanged.

In 1889, the site was developed as an amusement park, at the eastern end of the Lake Washington Cable Railway&#x27;s trolley line. The attractions included a casino, gardens, boat rentals, and a zoo. The zoo animals were donated to the City in 1903, and the site itself was sold to the City in 1909. It was adapted as one of Seattle&#x27;s earliest parks. Today, Leschi Park is a well-manicured, rolling hillside of grass planted with exotic trees and gardens of roses. Pathways follow an undulating terrain to restrooms above. One path leads to a tennis court, and another goes on up to a playground with slides and a sand box. A grassy spot under willows on the east side of Lakeside S. has a view of acres of moored sailboats and an old-time ferry.

Since the earliest days of Seattle history, Frink Park served as a natural woodland park where city residents could enjoy mountain and sound views. Set aside as a &quot;private&quot; park in 1883, the main portion of the park was later purchased by Seattle parks commissioner John M. Frink and his wife Abbie H. Frink and donated to the City on October 25, 1906.

In 1908 the City authorized the Board of Park Commissioners to acquire additional land adjacent southeast to the Frink park property. Other lands were given as gifts; however, the City condemned several lots just south of today’s Frink Boulevard to make room for the parkway connecting Leschi and Frink parks. Today, Friends of Frink Park work to preserve the natural urban forest unique to the Park. These local stewards are united in ensuring the Park’s continued importance to the local residents and the city that visionaries John Frink and the Olmsted brothers foresaw.

Flo (Florasina) Ware (1912-1981) was the quintessential activist, known in Seattle for raising a voice on behalf of children, the elderly, and the poor. In 1982, a Seattle Parks playfield at 28th &amp; Jackson was named in her honor. The park received a $540,000 renovation in 2002 which included art installations commemorating her life work. In recent years, it has been the site of free music events sponsored by the Leschi Community Council.

Powell Barnett Park was originally selected by the City Planning Commission as the &quot;east Junior High School Site&quot; and was developed as a running track and athletic field by nearby Garfield High School. Upon the acquisition and development of a playfield at the school, the &quot;Garfield Track&quot; was abandoned in 1962. It was sold to the Department of Parks in 1966. Playground improvements were accomplished in 1967 by the community through the Central Area Motivation Program. Upon suggestion of the Leschi Improvement Council (renamed the Leschi Community Ccouncil) in 1969, the playground was named in honor of Powell Barnett. He was a man of many interests and great energy, much of which was directed toward improving race relations and civic unity. Barnett organized the Leschi Improvement Council and became its first president in 1958, led in organizing the East Madison YMCA, served as chairman of its board, and chaired a committee that revised the Seattle Urban League, thus saving its membership in the Community Chest. On May 19, 2006, the community, Starbucks and the City of Seattle celebrated the completion of an Ultimate Parks Makeover of Powell Barnett Park.

== Seattle Municipal Street Railway cable car ==
Between September 27, 1888, and August 10, 1940, a Seattle Municipal Street Railway cable car ran along Yesler Way from Pioneer Square to Lake Washington.

<doc id="809650" wikidata="Q1426303" url="?curid=809650" title="Fibrous root system">
<text>A fibrous root system is the opposite of a taproot system. It is usually formed by thin, moderately branching roots growing from the stem. A fibrous root system is universal in monocotyledonous plants and ferns. The fibrous root systems look like a mat made out of roots when the plant has reached full maturity.

==Description==
Most trees begin life with a taproot, but after one to a few years change to a wide-spreading fibrous root system with mainly horizontal surface roots and only a few vertical, deep anchoring roots. A typical mature tree 30–50 m tall has a root system that extends horizontally in all directions as far as the tree is tall or more, but well over 95% of the roots are in the top 50 cm depth of soil.

A few plants with fibrous root systems:
* Coconut palm
* Grass
* Rosemary

Fibrous roots grow fairly close to the surface of the ground.
Leaves with parallel venation have fibrous roots.

Forages have a fibrous root system, which helps erosion by unanchoring the plants to the top layer of the soil, and covering the entirety of the field, as it is a non-row crop. In a fibrous root system, the roots grow downwards into the soil, and also branch off sideways throughout the soil. This forms a mass of fine roots, with no distinct tap root, because the embryonic root dies back while the plant is still young and growing.

<doc id="809669" wikidata="Q4740808" url="?curid=809669" title="Amazing Heroes">
<text>Amazing Heroes was a magazine about the comic book medium published by American company Fantagraphics Books from 1981 to 1992. Unlike its companion title, &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;, &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot; was a hobbyist magazine rather than an analytical journal.

== Publication history ==
Fantagraphics decided to publish &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot; as another income stream to supplement &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;. As long-time Fantagraphics co-publisher Kim Thompson put it: &quot;If you want to look at it cynically, we set out to steal &quot;The Comic Reader&quot;&#x27;s cheese. Which we did.&quot;

&quot;Amazing Heroes&quot;&#x27; first editor was Fantagraphics&#x27; head of promotion and circulation, Michael Catron. His inability to meet deadlines led to his being replaced after issue #6 by &quot;Comics Journal&quot; editor Kim Thompson.

The magazine was initially published under the Fantagraphics imprint Zam Inc., through issue #6. Beginning with #7, the publishing imprint became Redbeard Inc. It remained under Redbeard through at least issue #61, but by issue #68 was being published directly by Fantagraphics Books, Inc.

The magazine began as a monthly, then appeared twice a month for many years, and then went monthly again beginning in 1989. The magazine ran for 204 issues, folding with its July 1992 issue. The final issue was released as a flip book, with issue #203 on the front and issue #204 inverted on the back. It also released a number of special issues, such as &quot;Amazing Heroes Preview Special&quot; #1–5, 10, &amp; 11 (1985–1990), &quot;Amazing Heroes Swimsuit Special&quot; #1–5 (1990–1993), and &quot;The Best of Amazing Heroes Swimsuit Special&quot; (1993).

In February 1993, Fantagraphics announced that the publisher Personality Comics had bought the rights to &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot;, and planned to revive the magazine. Nothing came of it, however, as Personality itself folded later that year, and by 1994 the rights had reverted back to Fantagraphics.

== Format and content ==
&quot;Amazing Heroes&quot;&#x27; first 13 issues were magazine-sized, while the rest were comic book-sized.

The regular content included industry news, comics creator interviews, histories of comic book characters and reviews. Features included &quot;Hero Histories&quot; of various characters/features, previews of upcoming series, and letters page. Other regular features were a column called &quot;Doc&#x27;s Bookshelf&quot; by Dwight Decker (which ran from 1987–1989), and a question-and-answer feature called &quot;Information Center&quot;, which ran from 1986–1989.

There were regular special editions presenting previews of all comics slated to appear over the next six months, with &quot;Amazing Heroes Preview Special&quot; appearing twice a year, beginning with the Summer 1985 issue #1. These were extra-sized issues (often square-bound), and many issues also contained joke entries. The editors fluctuated between publishing these as separately numbered specials and special issues of the regular series itself, with issues #133, 145, 157, and 170 of the regular series (released in 1988 and 1989) taking the place of specials six through nine.

The &quot;Amazing Heroes Swimsuit Special&quot;, featuring pin-ups of characters in bikinis and similar beach apparel by various artists, debuted with a June 1990 edition. It was preceded by annual swimsuit issues of &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot;: #115 (April 1987), #138 (April 1988), and #164 (May 1989).

&quot;Amazing Heroes&quot; #200 (Apr. 1992) contained an extended preview of Scott McCloud&#x27;s &quot;Understanding Comics&quot;; the issue was later awarded a Don Thompson Award for Best Non-Fiction Work.

== The Jack Kirby Award ==
From 1985 to 1987, the magazine presented The Jack Kirby Award for achievement in comic books, voted on by comic-book professionals and managed by &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot; managing editor Dave Olbrich. After a dispute in 1987 over who owned them, the Kirby Awards were discontinued. Starting in 1988, the Kirby Award was discontinued and two new awards were created: the Eisner Award, managed by Olbrich, and the Fantagraphics-managed Harvey Award.

== Awards ==
&quot;Amazing Heroes&quot; won the U.K.&#x27;s Eagle Award for Favourite Specialist Comics Publication four years in a row, from 1985 to 1988: 
* 1985: Eagle Award — Favourite Speciality Comics Publication
* 1986: Eagle Award — Favourite Specialist Comics Publication
* 1987: Eagle Award — Favourite Specialist Comics Publication
* 1988: Eagle Award — Favourite Specialist Comics Publication
* 1992: Compuserve Comics and Animation Forum Award — Best Non-Fiction Work

<doc id="809686" wikidata="Q3046141" url="?curid=809686" title="ESPN Classic (Canadian TV channel)">
<text>ESPN Classic was a Canadian English language discretionary sports specialty channel owned by CTV Specialty Television Inc., a joint venture between Bell Media (80%) and ESPN (20%). Intended as the Canadian equivalent of the American channel of the same name, it broadcast a range of archive sports coverage, talk shows, documentaries and films.

==History==
ESPN Classic was licensed as Classic Sports in November 2000 by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), and was launched on September 7, 2001 as ESPN Classic Canada. A few years after its launch, &quot;Canada&quot; was dropped from its name and logo to &quot;ESPN Classic&quot;. ESPN Classic was the only ESPN-branded channel broadcasting in Canada, although in addition to owning a stake in the Canadian version of ESPN Classic, ESPN is part-owner of TSN (which uses on-air branding similar to the flagship ESPN channel in the U.S.), along with Bell Media.

The European version of the channel closed in 2013 and the American version of the channel ceased operations at the end of 2021, leaving the Canadian iteration as the last active vestige of the ESPN Classic brand.

In September 2023, TV providers Hay Communications and MNSi Telecom announced that the channel would shut down at midnight Eastern Time on October 31, 2023. On September 25, the CRTC confirmed it had revoked the channel&#x27;s licence at the owner&#x27;s request.

==Programming==
The channel&#x27;s programming consisted primarily of archived sporting events associated with TSN-owned event rights, including hockey (particularly IIHF events), the CFL and NFL, basketball, and curling, as well as &quot;SportsCentre&quot;-branded highlights compilations and countdowns originating from the main TSN network.

<text>Fashion Television, also known as Fashion Television Channel, was a Canadian English language specialty channel owned by Bell Media.

It was originally established in 2001 by CHUM Limited as a brand extension of the Citytv series &quot;FashionTelevision,&quot; airing programming related to fashion, modelling, photography, art, architecture and design. Under Bell Media ownership and after the cancellation of its namesake, the network abandoned its original format and shifted primarily to airing Bell Media library programming with little relevance to its original format.

Amid declining investments in the channel, Fashion Television shut down on February 21, 2021.

==History==
On November 24, 2000, CHUM Limited was granted approval by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to launch &quot;Fashion Television: The Channel&quot;, described as &quot;a national English-language specialty television service dedicated to fashion, beauty, style, art, architecture, photography and design.&quot;

The channel was launched on September 7, 2001, as &quot;FashionTelevisionChannel&quot;.

In July 2006, Bell Globemedia (later called CTVglobemedia) announced that it would purchase CHUM for an estimated $1.7 billion CAD. The sale was approved by the CRTC in June 2007, and the transaction was completed on June 22, 2007, with the Citytv stations were being sold to Rogers Media on October 31, 2007.

BCE (a minority shareholder in CTVglobemedia) announced on September 10, 2010, that it planned to re-acquire 100% interest in CTVglobemedia for a total debt and equity transaction cost of $3.2 billion CAD. The deal which required CRTC approval, was approved on March 7, 2011 and closed on April 1 of that year, at which time CTVglobemedia was renamed Bell Media.

The &quot;FashionTelevision&quot; series ended production in 2012, but repeats of that program and related series continued to air on the channel for a time. Along with BookTelevision, the channel later abandoned its original format and began to primarily air reruns of library programming from other Bell Media networks with little relevance to fashion. The channel ceased investments in original Canadian programming and was rarely promoted by Bell. In January 2021, the CRTC approved a request by Bell to revoke Fashion Television and BookTelevision&#x27;s licenses, stating that it planned to shut both channels down on February 21.

<doc id="809774" wikidata="Q1372190" url="?curid=809774" title="Torquetum">
<text>The torquetum or turquet is a medieval astronomical instrument designed by persons unknown to take and convert measurements made in three sets of coordinates: horizon, equatorial, and ecliptic. It is characterised by R. P. Lorch as a combination of Ptolemy&#x27;s astrolabon () and the plane astrolabe. In a sense, the &quot;torquetum&quot; is an analog computer.

==Invention==
The origins of the &quot;torquetum&quot; are unclear. Its invention has been credited to multiple figures, including Jabir ibn Aflah, Bernard of Verdun and Franco of Poland.

Jabir ibn Aflah of Al-Andalus in the early 12th century has been assumed by several historians to be the inventor of the &quot;torquetum&quot;, based on a similar instrument he described in his &quot;Islah Almajisti&quot;. However, while his device is similar in function, it has not been identified as a &quot;torquetum&quot;, but evidence suggests it inspired the torquetum.

The earliest explicit accounts of the &quot;torquetum&quot; appear in the 13th century writings of Bernard of Verdun and Franco of Poland. Franco of Poland&#x27;s work was published in 1284; however, Bernard of Verdun&#x27;s work does not contain a date. Therefore, it is impossible to know which work was written first. Franco&#x27;s work was more widely known and is credited with the distribution of knowledge about the &quot;torquetum&quot;.

The instrument was first created sometime in the 12th or 13th century. However, the only surviving examples of the &quot;torquetum&quot; are dated from the 16th century. In the middle of the 16th century, the &quot;torquetum&quot; had numerous structural changes to the original design. The most important change was by instrument-maker, Erasmus Habermel. His alteration allowed for astronomers to make observations to all three of the scales.

A &quot;torquetum&quot; can be seen in the famous portrait &quot;The Ambassadors&quot; (1533) by Hans Holbein the Younger. It is placed on the right side of the table, next to and above the elbow of the ambassador clad in a long brown coat or robe. The painting shows much of the details of the inscriptions on the disk and half disk, which make up the top of this particular kind of torquetum.

A 14th century instrument, the rectangulus, was invented by Richard of Wallingford. This carried out the same task as the torquetum, but was calibrated with linear scales, read by plumb lines. This simplified the spherical trigonometry by resolving the polar measurements directly into their Cartesian components.

== Notable historic uses ==
Following the conception of the &quot;torquetum&quot;, the device had been put through many of the following uses. The astronomer, Peter of Limoges, used this device for his observation of what is known today as Halley&#x27;s Comet at the turn of the 14th century. In the early 1300s, John of Murs mentions the &quot;torquetum&quot; as his defence &quot;of the reliability of observational astronomy&quot;, thus further solidifying its practicality and viability in ancient astronomy. Additionally, Johannes Schoner built a torquetum model for his own personal use in the observation of Halley&#x27;s Comet in the 1500s.

The best-documented account of the &quot;torquetum&quot; was done by Peter Apian in 1532. Peter Apian was a German humanist, specializing in astronomy, mathematics, and cartography. In his book &quot;Astronomicum Caesareum&quot; (1540), Apian gives a description of the &quot;torquetum&quot; near the end of the second part. He also details how the device is used. Apian explains that the &quot;torquetum&quot; was used for astronomical observations and how the description of the instrument was used as a basis for common astronomical instruments. He also notes the manufacturing process of the instrument and the use of the torquetum for astronomical measurements.

== Components ==
The torquetum is a complex medieval analog computer that measures three sets of astronomical coordinates: the horizon, equatorial, and ecliptic. One of the defining attributes of the torquetum is its ability to interconvert between these three sets of coordinate dimensions without the use of calculations, as well as to demonstrate the relationship between the same coordinate sets. However, it is a device that requires a thorough understanding of the components and how they work together to make relative positional measurements of certain celestial objects. 

The anatomy of the torquetum involves many different components, which can be grouped into subdivisions of the torquetum structure, those being: the base, the midframe, and the upperframe. The base starts with the tabula orizontis, which is the bottommost rectangular piece in contact with the ground, and this component represents the horizon of the Earth, relative to the point of measurement. Hinged to the tabula orizontis is a similarly shaped component, the tabula equinoctialis, which represents the latitude of the Earth. This piece can rotate up to 90 degrees, coinciding with the latitudinal lines of the Earth from the equator to the poles. This angle of rotation is created by the stylus, which is an arm mechanism that pins to the slotted holes, which are part of the tabula orizontis.

The midframe of the torquetum consists of a free-spinning disk (unnamed) that can be locked into place, and the tabula orbis signorum, directly hinged to it above. The angle between these two pieces is defined by the basilica, a solid stand piece, which is used to either set the draft angle at 0 degrees (Where the basilica is removed) or 23.5 degrees, representing the off-set of the axis of rotation of the Earth. Whether or not the basilica is included depends on the point of measurement either below or above the tropical latitudinal lines. Inscribed on the tabula equinoctialis along, although separate from, the outer perimeter of the bottom disk is a 24-hour circle, which is used to measure the angle between the longitudinal line facing the poles, and the line to the object being measured.

Lastly, the upper frame is made up of the crista, the semis and the perpendiculum. The base of the crista is joined to another free-spinning disk directly above the tabula orbis signorum.

Similarly, on the outer edge of the tabula orbis signorum is a zodiacal calendar and degree scale, with each of the 12 signs divided amongst it. This scale measures the zodiacal sector of the sky the object being measured is in. The crista itself is a circular piece that corresponds with the meridian of the celestial sphere, which has four quadrants inscribed along the edges, each starting at 0 degrees along the horizontal, and 90 degrees along the vertical. Adjacent, and locked with the crista at 23.5 degrees angle is the semis, which is a half-circle composed of two quadrants starting at 0 degrees along the vertical (relative to 23.5-degree placement) and 90 degrees at the horizontal. Finally, the last major component is the perpendicular, a free-hanging pendulum which measures the angle between the radial line of the Earth and the measured object using the semis.

== Parts and configurations ==

The base of the instrument represents the horizon and is built on a hinge and a part known as the stylus holds the instrument up to the viewer&#x27;s complementary latitude. This represents the celestial equator and the angle varies depending on where the view is located on Earth. The several plates and circles that make up the upper portion of the instrument represent the celestial sphere. These parts are built on top of the base and above the basilica, which rotates on a pin to represent the axis of the Earth. The zodiac calendar is inscribed on the tabula orbis signorum this is part of the mechanical aspects of the instrument that take away the tedious calculations required in previous instruments.

The versatility of the &quot;torquetum&quot; can be seen in its three possible configurations for the measuring. The first method used lays the instruments flat on a table with no angles within the instrument set. This configuration gives the coordinates of celestial bodies as related to the horizon. The basilica is set so that 0 degree mark faces north. The user can now measure altitude of the target celestial body as well as use the base as a compass for viewing the possible paths they travel. The second configuration uses the stylus to elevate the base set at co-latitude of 90 degrees. The position of the celestial bodies can now be measured in hours, minutes, and seconds using the inscribed clock on the almuri. This helps give the proper ascension and decline coordinates of the celestial bodies as they travel through space. The zero point for ascension and decline coordinates of the celestial bodies as they travel through space. The zero point for ascension is set to the vernal equinox while the end measurement (decline) is the equator, this would put the North Pole at the 90 degree point. The third and most commonly seen configuration of the &quot;torquetum&quot; uses all its assets to make measurements. The upper portion is now set at an angle equal to the obliquity of the ecliptic, which allows the instrument to give ecliptic coordinates. This measures the celestial bodies now on celestial latitude and longitude scales which allow for greater precision and accuracy in making measurements. These three differing configurations allowed for added convenience in taking readings and made once tedious and complicated measuring more streamlined and simple.

<text>The MS &quot;Theofilos&quot; was a passenger/vehicle ferry built at the Nobiskrug shipyard in Rendsburg, Germany in 1975.

== History ==

MS &quot;Theofilos was a passenger/vehicle ferry that was built at Nobiskrug in Rendsburg for the TT-Line as the &quot;Nils Holgersson&quot; (3) for the Travemünde - Trelleborg route in 1975 along with her sister &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (2). In 1985 it was purchased and renamed Abel Tasman&quot; by TT-Line Company and after the Australian National Line (ANL) announced they would be pulling out of the Bass Strait run, so the federal government gave the Tasmanian Government the capital required to buy a suitable ferry, in compensation for placing the environmentally-sensitive Gordon River off-limits to Hydro Tasmania power generation schemes. This ship turned out to be the &quot;Nils Holgersson&quot; (3) from the TT-Line, which also came with an option to buy her sister ship &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (2) one year later (which never came to pass).

The ship was named after Abel Tasman, the first known European to reach the islands of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (now Tasmania). She first went back to her builder&#x27;s yard for a refit, and for a large box-like structure to be added to the stern of the ship for the crew, because the Australian maritime union rules did not allow the crew to be under the car deck, which is where the crew cabins were. She left Rendsburg on 22 April 1985, but two days later she was stopped by an industrial dispute with the stewards. She first went to Brunsbuttel, but had to continue through the Kiel Canal, and into Kiel where she docked. The Tasmanian Government sent police to West Germany to end the dispute and get the ship underway, but on arrival the police were powerless in West Germany. So the Tasmanian Government had to change laws to empower them to resolve the problem, and she resumed her trip and left Kiel on 18 May 1985.

She then sailed to Australia, going straight to Devonport and not via Queensland and New South Wales as had been planned. She started on the Devonport–Melbourne route on 1 June 1985 from Melbourne. Her former Captain Rudolf Schonfeldt, sailed with the ship to Australia from Germany to advise the crew, unfamiliar with the new ship.

In 1993, she was laid up following the arrival of the much larger &quot;Spirit of Tasmania&quot;. In 1994, she was sold to Ventouris Ferries and renamed the Pollux. In 1995 she was again sold, this time to the Maritime Company of Lesvos and operated by Nel Lines, renamed Theofilos for the Piraeus–Chios–Mytilini route with calls sometimes in Thessaloniki and Limnos.

On 28 June 2008, &quot;Theofilos&quot; ran aground on a reef of rocks of the island of Oinousses about 10 nm from the island of Chios. She suffered serious damage to her port side hull, a 15–20 metres slash causing flooding of a water tight compartment, she subsequently developed a 2.5 degree list. The ship was repaired, with an estimated cost to Nel Lines underwriter, The West of England Shipowners of €5 million. Once the repairs were completed, she returned to normal service on 16 May 2009.

Since January 2018 Theofilos has been laid up at Elefsina Greece (Near Athens) following her owners declaring bankruptcy. Since January 2020 she is under the flag of Togo. The ship was laid-up in terrible condition since 2020 in Perama, Greece and after two years of laid-up the ship sold for scrap in Aliaga, Turkey under the name &quot;Ilos&quot; in 2022.

==Sister ship==
In 1986 the M/S &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (2) was renamed &quot;Robin Hood&quot; to free the name for the larger &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (3) (later &quot;Spirit of Tasmania&quot;). In 1987, she was sold to Minoan Lines and renamed &quot;Fedra&quot;. In 2004 she was transferred over to Hellas Ferries, then sold to Sea Hawk Marine, operated by Comanav. Later that year she was renamed &quot;Guido&quot; for a short time. She was then bought by El Salam Maritime and renamed &quot;Ouzoud&quot;. She then operated under Comanav for six years on the 48-hour route from Genoa (Italy) – Tangier (Morocco). In January 2010, it was reported that &quot;Ouzoud&quot; has been sold to India for demolition.

<text>is a Japanese voice actress affiliated with Aoni Production. She mainly voices young girls and young boys. She is known for voicing Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prower in the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series.

==Biography==
Hirohashi was born in Niigata Prefecture, her family&#x27;s home being a Buddhist temple. Due to family reasons, she attended Ryukoku University in Kyoto, a Buddhist university, but in the middle of her first year, she was told by her parents that she could do what she liked even if it wasn&#x27;t related to Buddhism, so she sought out what she wanted to do. During her second year, she remembered a radio show she used to listen to in junior high school and became interested in voice acting, so she attended the Aoni Coaching School Osaka while attending university at the same time. The radio personality she had listened to in junior high school was a voice actor, so upon learning that such a job exists, she decided to become a voice actor herself.

She graduated from the 16th class of Aoni Coaching School Osaka and made her debut as a voice actor in &quot;Aquarian Age: Sign for Evolution&quot; in 2002. In February 2007, her profile was posted on the list of graduates page on the official website of Aoni Coaching School Osaka.

<doc id="809832" wikidata="Q325325" url="?curid=809832" title="Bertram Goodhue">
<text>Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue (April 28, 1869 – April 23, 1924) was an American architect celebrated for his work in Gothic Revival and Spanish Colonial Revival design. He also designed notable typefaces, including Cheltenham and Merrymount for the Merrymount Press. Later in life, Goodhue freed his architectural style with works like El Fureidis in Montecito, California, one of three estates he designed.

== Early career ==
Goodhue was born in Pomfret, Connecticut, to Charles Wells Goodhue and his second wife, Helen Grosvenor (Eldredge) Goodhue. Due to financial constraints, he was educated at home by his mother until, at age 11 years, he was sent to Russell&#x27;s Collegiate and Commercial Institute. Finances prevented him from attending university. In lieu of formal training, in 1884 he moved to Manhattan, New York City, to apprentice at the architectural firm of Renwick, Aspinwall and Russell (one of its principals, James Renwick Jr., was the architect of Grace Church and St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, both in New York City). Goodhue&#x27;s apprenticeship ended in 1891 when he won a design competition for St. Matthew&#x27;s in Dallas.

== Cram and Goodhue ==
After completing his apprenticeship, Goodhue moved to Boston, Massachusetts, where he was befriended by a group of young, artistic intellectuals involved in the founding of the Society of Arts and Crafts – Boston in 1897. This circle included Charles Eliot Norton of Harvard University and Ernest Fenollosa of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. It was also through this group that Goodhue met Ralph Adams Cram, who would be his business partner for almost 25 years. Cram and Goodhue were members of several societies, including the &quot;Pewter Mugs&quot; and the &quot;Visionists&quot;. In 1892–1893 they published a quarterly art magazine called &quot;The Knight Errant&quot;. The multitalented Goodhue was also a student of book design and type design. In 1896, he created the Cheltenham typeface for use by a New York printer, Cheltenham Press. This typeface came to be used as the headline type for &quot;The New York Times&quot;.
In 1891, Cram and Goodhue formed the architectural firm of Cram, Wentworth, and Goodhue, renamed Cram, Goodhue and Ferguson in 1898. The firm was a leader in Neo-Gothic architecture, with significant commissions from ecclesiastical, academic, and institutional clients. The Gothic Revival Saint Thomas Church was designed by them and built-in 1914 on Manhattan&#x27;s Fifth Avenue in New York City. In 1904, Goodhue built a townhouse at 106 East 74th Street, pushing the front to the building line and redesigning it in a mix of Gothic and Tudor styles. In 1915, Goodhue accepted membership to what is known now as the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 1917, Goodhue was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1923.

== Independent practice ==
=== Early projects ===
When Goodhue left to begin his own practice in 1914, Cram had already created his dreamed-of Gothic Revival commission at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City, and continued to work in the Gothic style mode for the rest of his career.

Goodhue departed into a series of radically different stylistic experiments over his independent career. His first was the Byzantine Revival style for St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Episcopal Church on New York City&#x27;s Park Avenue, built on a new platform just above the Grand Central Terminal railyards.

=== Spanish Colonial Revival projects ===

In California, in 1915, Bertram Goodhue re-interpreted masterful Spanish Baroque and Spanish Colonial architecture complete with the latter&#x27;s traditional Churrigueresque detailing into what became known as the Spanish Colonial Revival Style of architecture. This was for the significant commission of the &quot;El Prado&quot; Quadrangle&#x27;s layout and buildings at the major 1915 Panama–California Exposition, located in San Diego&#x27;s Balboa Park. He was the lead architect, taking over from Irving Gill, with Carleton Winslow Sr. and Lloyd Wright assisting. The Panama–California Exposition&#x27;s style was seen by many and widely published, becoming extremely influential in California and the Southern and Southwestern United States. It led to California&#x27;s assimilation of Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture as its dominant historical regional style, which continues to this day. The singular style for the rebuilding of Santa Barbara after its 1925 destruction by a major earthquake was drawn from the local Mission Revival and Goodhue&#x27;s Panama–California Exposition Spanish Colonial Revival style trends. Examples of influential private Californian commissions, both extant registered landmarks now, are his 1906 J. Waldron Gillespie Estate, El Fureidis; and 1915 Dater – Wright Ludington Estate, Dias Felices — Val Verde in Montecito. Goodhue and Gillespie had done a six-month research and acquisitions tour together through Egypt, Persia, and the Arabian Peninsula before collaborating on the classic Persian gardens layout and Roman and Spanish Colonial Revival residence at El Fureidis. Goodhue&#x27;s Spanish Colonial Revival style work went on to dominate the Hawaiian architecture of public buildings and estate residences during the 1920s building boom in the Territory of Hawaii.
=== Later projects ===

Later Goodhue&#x27;s architectural creations became freed of architectural detail and more Romanesque in form, although he remained dedicated to the integration of sculpture, mosaic work, and color in his surface architectural details. Towards the end of his career, he arrived at a highly personal style, a synthesis of simplified form and a generalized archaic quality, and those innovations paved the way for others to transition to modern architectural idioms. This style is seen in his last major projects: the 1926 Mediterranean revival and Egyptian revival Los Angeles Public Library; the Nebraska State Capitol; and in his 1922 entry for the Chicago Tribune Tower competition.

== Influence ==

Goodhue died in 1924 in New York City. He was interred within a wall vault in the north (left-hand) transept of his Church of the Intercession, at his request in the building he considered his finest. Architectural sculptor Lee Lawrie created a Gothic styled tomb for him there, featuring Goodhue recumbent, crowned by a carved halo of some of his buildings. He received the AIA Gold Medal in 1925.

=== Collaboration ===
Throughout his career, Goodhue relied on frequent collaborations with several significant artists and artisans. These included architectural sculptor Lee Lawrie, and mosaicist and muralist Hildreth Meiere. Their work is central to the aesthetic power and social messages implicit in Goodhue&#x27;s best work. Lee Lawrie worked with Cram and Goodhue on: the Chapel at West Point, the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer, St. Bartholomew&#x27;s, and the reredos at the Church of St. Thomas. Lawrie worked after 1914 with Goodhue&#x27;s independent practice on: the Los Angeles Public Library, the Nebraska State Capitol, the Rockefeller Chapel at the University of Chicago, the National Academy of Sciences Building in Washington, D.C., and the Christ Church Cranbrook completed after Goodhue&#x27;s death at the Cranbrook Schools in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. Edward Ardolino was a frequent collaborating sculptor.

After Goodhue&#x27;s unexpected death in 1924, many of his designs and projects were brought to completion by architect Carleton Winslow Sr. in California, the successor firm of Mayers Murray &amp; Phillip in New York, and other former associates. Goodhue&#x27;s offices had employed before they established their own independent practices and reputations, designers and architects such as Raymond Hood, Carleton Winslow Sr., Clarence Stein, and Wallace Harrison. Thematic consultant Hartley Burr Alexander, Lee Lawrie, and Hildreth Meiere reassembled in the 1930s for the Rockefeller Center project collaboration with Raymond Hood.

=== Legacy ===
In a dissertation on American regional architecture in California and Hawaii, Goodhue is credited with creating a distinctive interpretation of Spanish Colonial architecture into the Spanish Colonial Revival Style as a dominant Californian regional vernacular. He also directly influenced the dominance of the Spanish Colonial Revival style in major public and private architecture of 1920s Hawaii.

Along with Paul Cret and others, Goodhue is sometimes credited with being part of popularizing the art deco style in America, as in his design for the Nebraska State Capitol building, by which some may retroactively classify him as an early American Modernist. However, his dedication to the integration of art and architecture was contrary to the spirit of Modernism design, and at least partly accounts for the academic and critical neglect of his work.

A significant archive of Goodhue&#x27;s correspondence, architectural drawings, and professional papers is held by the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University in New York City.

James Perry Wilson, an architect and painter responsible for many of the Natural History dioramas at the American Museum of Natural History, was employed by Bertram Goodhue Associates before transitioning to museum work.

<text>Libby as a feminine given name is typically a diminutive form of Elizabeth, which is less commonly spelled &#x27;Libbie&#x27; or &#x27;Libi&#x27;.

In recent years, it has been used as a shortened version of the name Liberty.

The name means &quot;my heart&quot; in Hebrew. It became popular in Israel due to a character in a series of novels for young teenagers by author Hadas Leibowitz and due to its use in the Israeli song &quot;Achoti Haktana&quot; or &quot;My Little Sister&quot;.

As a surname, it can also be spelled &#x27;Libbey&#x27;.

<text>Fox Sports World Canada was a Canadian pay television channel. The channel&#x27;s programming primarily featured soccer and covered other world sports such as rugby. Although its original Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) licence called for Fox Sports World Canada to carry soccer, cricket and rugby as their core sports, cricket and rugby matches almost disappeared from the channel after the first few years. Fox Sports World Canada&#x27;s flagship program was the &quot;Fox Soccer Report&quot;, which comprised most of its Canadian content.

On October 27, 2010, Shaw Communications gained control of Fox Sports World Canada as a result of its acquisition of Canwest; which subsequently was renamed Shaw Media.

On March 6, 2012, Shaw Media released a statement announcing that they would cease the broadcast of Fox Sports World Canada on midnight of April 30 of that year. The company had been examining the possibility of launching a mainstream sports channel in competition with TSN and Sportsnet, but ultimately decided against it. Shaw claimed the channel &quot;no longer makes strategic and economic sense for Shaw Media going forward&quot; in light of that decision. The channel officially shut down on April 30, 2012, while its license was officially revoked on April 19, 2016, nearly four years after the channel went off the air.

<doc id="809866" wikidata="Q945548" url="?curid=809866" title="Jordan-Hare Stadium">
<text>Pat Dye Field at Jordan–Hare Stadium (properly pronounced as ) is an American football stadium in Auburn, Alabama on the campus of Auburn University. It primarily serves as the home venue of the Auburn Tigers football team. The stadium is named for Ralph &quot;Shug&quot; Jordan, who owns the most wins in school history as a head coach, and Cliff Hare, a member of Auburn&#x27;s first football team as well as Dean of the Auburn University School of Chemistry and President of the Southern Conference. On November 19, 2005, the playing field at the stadium was named in honor of former Auburn coach and athletic director Pat Dye, giving the venue the moniker Pat Dye Field at Jordan–Hare Stadium.

The stadium reached its current seating capacity of 88,043 as of 2023, good for 12th largest among NCAA stadiums, and ranks 13th largest in the country and 21st largest in the world. For years, it has been a fixture on lists of the best collegiate gameday atmospheres and one of the most intimidating places for visiting teams to play.

==History==
===Early years===
Before 1939, Auburn played its home games under Coach Jack Meagher at Drake Field, a bare-bones facility seating only 700 people in temporary bleachers. With such a tiny capacity, Auburn was only able to play one game on campus per year, and frequently had to play many of its &quot;home&quot; games at neutral sites. From 1934 to 1942, Jack Meagher was the head football coach at Auburn University, where he compiled a 48–37–10 record. Shug Jordan was his assistant coach. During his nine seasons coaching the Auburn Tigers, they played in their first bowl game ever, the Bacardi Bowl. The game was held in Havana, Cuba. In 1935, Meagher was named the SEC Coach of the Year. He joined the Navy during World War II and served as a lieutenant commander in the United States Navy. By the 1930s, school officials realized that Auburn had long since outgrown Drake Field, and felt chagrin at having to play &quot;home&quot; games at Birmingham&#x27;s Legion Field, Montgomery&#x27;s Cramton Bowl, and even Memorial Stadium in Columbus, Georgia. Head coach, Jack Meagher, was a driving force to raising funds and building a permanent stadium at Auburn. 

The stadium, then known as Auburn Stadium, hosted its first game on November 10, 1939, between the Auburn and Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football freshmen teams. While the school was officially known as Alabama Polytechnic Institute until 1960, it had been popularly known as &quot;Auburn&quot; for years, and the decision to name the stadium as such reflected this. The stadium was dedicated on Thanksgiving Day (November 30) 1939 before the first varsity game played in the stadium, a 7–7 tie with the University of Florida under Auburn head coach Jack Meagher. The Gators had to dress at their hotel in Opelika because the stadium&#x27;s adjoining field house was still under construction. The Auburn-Florida game was originally scheduled for December 2, 1939 in Montgomery. The game was rescheduled in order for the stadium to be dedicated on Thanksgiving Day, Auburn officials seemingly wanting the significance of the occasion to dovetail with America&#x27;s established Thanksgiving Day football tradition, a plan nearly thwarted by Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;Franksgiving&quot; decree. Had Alabama not chosen to observe Thanksgiving on its original date, the stadium would have instead been dedicated on December 2, 1940.

The stadium is frequently said to have opened with a capacity of 7,500; however, that was only the number of seats in the west grandstand (the lower half of the current facility&#x27;s west stands). This is usually cited as the stadium&#x27;s original capacity because the west grandstands were the only permanent portion of the original facility. The actual original capacity of the stadium, taking into account the wooden east stand as well as bleachers behind each end zone, was approximately 15,000—a figure that was actually quoted by a number of official Auburn sources of the day. The official attendance of 7,290 for the dedication game, as quoted by then-athletics business manager and future athletic director Jeff Beard, came from the number of tickets printed for the game. However, a thanks-for-coming note from Meagher cited the actual attendance as 11,095, and newspaper accounts reported that anywhere from 12,000 to 14,000 people were in attendance.

In the fall of 1947, Auburn students lobbied to rename the stadium Petrie Stadium in honor of Dr. George Petrie, Auburn&#x27;s first football coach, who died in October that year. The first major expansion came in 1949, when the wooden bleachers on the east side were replaced with permanent seats and more seats were added to the west grandstand. This brought capacity to 21,500, and the stadium was renamed Cliff Hare Stadium.

===Expansion===

Shug Jordan became head coach of the Tigers in 1951. He was still coaching when his name was added to the stadium in 1973, making it the first stadium in the United States to be named for an active coach. The stadium&#x27;s capacity more than tripled via three expansions during his 25 years at Auburn; it seated 61,261 when he retired in 1975. Under Jordan&#x27;s watch, the stadium became a horseshoe in 1960, and a bowl in 1970.

With the addition of the west upper deck in 1980 and the east upper deck in 1987, the stadium became the largest in the state of Alabama until the 2006 and 2010 expansion of Bryant–Denny Stadium (capacity 101,821) at Alabama.

For much of its history, Auburn played home football games against their traditional rivals at neutral sites. This was partially due to the larger capacity and better amenities available at other stadiums but also due to the lack of accommodations and relative difficulty in traveling to Auburn before the city&#x27;s explosive growth in the past few decades. For instance, at the time the stadium opened, there were only two gas stations in town with public restrooms. In its first decade after the stadium opened, Auburn only played a total of 12 true home games. Until 1960, all games against Georgia continued to be played at Memorial Stadium in nearby Columbus. Until the 1970s, Auburn played all home games against Tennessee and Georgia Tech at Legion Field in Birmingham. Georgia Tech first came to the Plains in 1970, while Tennessee came to Auburn for the first time in 1974.

===The Iron Bowl Comes Home===

As Auburn became more accessible and the stadium expanded in capacity, the Tigers gradually moved their more important games to Jordan–Hare. By the 1980s, Alabama was Auburn&#x27;s last major rival to have never played a true road game in Auburn. The yearly Iron Bowl clash between Alabama and Auburn had been played at Legion Field since it was renewed on a permanent basis in 1948. Initially, it made sense to play the Iron Bowl at Legion Field, since neither school&#x27;s home stadium at the time had nearly enough seats to accommodate the crowds attending the game. At its height, Legion Field seated over 20,000 more people than Jordan-Hare.

From the 1970s onward, however, Auburn fans increasingly felt chagrin at facing Alabama in Birmingham, particularly after the 1980s expansions allowed Jordan-Hare&#x27;s capacity to eclipse that of Legion Field by over 2,000 seats. Legion Field had long been associated with Alabama football, even though Auburn played some home games there well into the 1970s. Indeed, until the 1980s, most of Alabama&#x27;s &quot;home&quot; football history took place in Birmingham, which was only 45 minutes east of Alabama&#x27;s campus in Tuscaloosa.

By the time Dye became head coach and athletic director at Auburn in 1981, calls to make the Iron Bowl a home-and-home series had grown to a fever pitch. Years later, Dye recalled that almost as soon as he sat down for the first time as head coach with his former mentor, legendary Crimson Tide head coach Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant, Bryant mused, &quot;Well, I guess you&#x27;re going to want to take that game to Auburn.&quot; Dye confirmed that hunch, saying, &quot;We&#x27;re going to take it to Auburn.&quot; Bryant noted that Alabama and Auburn&#x27;s contract with the city of Birmingham ran through 1988, prompting Dye to reply, &quot;Well, we&#x27;ll play &#x27;89 in Auburn.&quot; Dye would have been well within his rights to move Auburn&#x27;s home games for the Iron Bowl to Jordan-Hare as early as 1983. However, he knew that Bryant adamantly opposed playing &quot;any&quot; games in Auburn. Bryant&#x27;s standing in the state was such that Dye knew it would be folly to attempt making the Iron Bowl a home-and-home series as long as Bryant was still alive.

After years of negotiations, the two schools agreed to play the Iron Bowl in Auburn in odd-numbered years. Alabama first came to the Plains on December 2, 1989—a game that saw #11 Auburn upend undefeated and #2 Alabama 30–20. The 1991 game was played at Legion Field but has been played at Auburn in every odd-numbered year since. Alabama continued to play its home games for the rivalry at Legion Field until 1998. In 2000, the Iron Bowl became a true home-and-home series as it was played in Tuscaloosa for the first time in 99 years. The 17th-ranked Tigers won that game, shutting out the then-unranked Crimson Tide 9-0.

===Modern era improvements===

Jordan-Hare has undergone four modest expansions in the 21st century. Small areas of additional seating were added in 2000 and 2001, bringing the stadium capacity to 85,612 and 86,063 respectively. In 2004, an additional section was added to each end of the east upper deck as well as more luxury suites and additional general seating, giving the stadium a capacity of 87,451. Additional premium seats were added in 2023, expanding the stadium&#x27;s capacity to its current 88,043.

In 1998, artist Michael Taylor was commissioned to paint ten large murals on the east-side exterior of the stadium. The paintings depicted the greatest players, teams, and moments from Auburn&#x27;s football history to that date. Auburn updated the murals in 2006 and again in 2011 after the team&#x27;s national championship in 2010.

Before the 2007 season, a $2.9 million, high by wide HD Daktronics LED video display was installed in the south end zone of Jordan–Hare Stadium. Auburn was the first Southeastern Conference school to install an HD video display and the second in the NCAA (after Texas&#x27; Godzillatron). In August 2015, a new LED video board that is , or , was unveiled and is currently the largest video board in college athletics and among the largest in the world.

In 2015, Auburn considered a complete reconstruction of the north end-zone section, which would have included new premium club seating and lounges, as well as establishing a new home locker room to replace the existing facility in the south end zone. The cost of this project was estimated at $145 million. After surveying donors and the fan base at large, the university did not move forward with those plans, deciding instead to build a $28 million gameday support facility in the southwest corner of the stadium. The project includes renovation and expansion of the existing home locker room, relocation of the press box, a new player recruiting lounge, and a new premium fan club providing overviews of the end of Tiger Walk. In 2018, additional premium club seating and a lounge area was added to the existing press box in the west upper deck, and the coaches&#x27; boxes and television broadcast box in the same area underwent a renovation, all at a cost of $12 million.

The 2023 stadium upgrade not only added new premium seats but added new concession updates, a new team field entrance, and stadium WiFi improvements.

In 2024, construction started on a new videoboard behind the north endzone. It will be about 2/3 the size of the existing videoboard and is expected to be completed in the summer of 2025.

===Capacity history===

==Other uses==
Although Jordan-Hare Stadium is known primarily as a venue for football, it has hosted a handful of other events including an appearance by Billy Graham and concert appearances by James Brown, The Beach Boys, Miranda Lambert, Kenny Chesney, and Blake Shelton.

From 2010 to 2022, the stadium played host to the Alabama High School Athletic Association&#x27;s football state championships, known as the &quot;Super 7&quot; since 2014 and formerly as the &quot;Super 6&quot; for the number of classifications in the state. However, in June 2024, the AHSAA announced its football championship games would no longer be played at Jordan-Hare or Bryant-Denny stadiums, citing the expanded format of the College Football Playoff that could potentially see either school host a first-round playoff game in December.

<doc id="809897" wikidata="Q466582" url="?curid=809897" title="John William Inchbold">
<text>John William Inchbold (29 August 1830 – 23 January 1888) was an English painter who was born in Leeds, Yorkshire. His style was influenced by the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. He was the son of a Yorkshire newspaper owner, Thomas Inchbold.

==Biography==
Inchbold was born 29 April 1830 at Leeds, Yorkshire, where his father, Thomas Inchbold, was the proprietor and editor of the &quot;Leeds Intelligencer&quot;. Having shown an early talent for drawing he moved to London and became a draughtsman in the lithographic works of Day and Haghe.

Inchbold became a pupil of Louis Haghe, the water-colour painter, and was a student at the Royal Academy in 1847. He exhibited at the Society of British Artists in 1849, at the Academy from 1851. At first he worked in watercolour in a free style, but his first exhibited oil painting, shown at the Academy in 1852 showed the influence of the Pre-Raphaelite movement, and in 1855 he gained the enthusiastic praise of John Ruskin for &quot;The Moorland&quot;, which he painted to illustrate a passage from Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Locksley Hall&quot;.

Inchbold spent much of the later part of his life abroad, mainly in Switzerland, where he had spent some time with Ruskin in the mid-1850s. His best-known works are probably &quot;On the Lake of Thun&quot; (1860), &quot;Tintagel&quot; (1862), &quot;Gordale Scar&quot; (1876) and &quot;Drifting&quot; (1883); the last named was once in the possession of Coventry Patmore. Tennyson, Browning, Lord Houghton, and Sir Henry Thompson were among his admirers and supporters, and in Dr Russell Reynolds he found a liberal and discriminating patron. A year or two before his death he had returned from Algeria with a large collection of sketches, in which the ordinary defects of his manner were less apparent. He died suddenly of heart disease at Headingley in Leeds, on 23 January 1888. His memory was honoured by Swinburne in a funeral ode.

Inchbold published a book of sonnets called &quot;Annus Amoris&quot; in 1876.

<doc id="809953" wikidata="Q827362" url="?curid=809953" title="2004 Japanese House of Councillors election">
<text>House of Councillors elections were held in Japan on 11 July 2004. The House of Councillors consisted of 242 members who served six-year terms. Approximately half the members are elected every three years. At these elections 121 members were elected. Of these 73 were elected from the 47 prefectural districts and 48 were elected from a nationwide list by proportional representation.

==Contesting parties==
; Government
* Liberal Democratic Party (conservative)
* New Komeito (theocratic Buddhist, conservative)

; Opposition
* Democratic Party (social-democratic/liberal)
* Japanese Communist Party (communist)
* Social Democratic Party (social-democratic)

==Results==
The opposition Democratic Party won a plurality of the popular vote and seats contested in the election, sweeping the liberal urban areas. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party failed to win in its strongholds but once more received most of its support from the agrarian areas. New Komeito did well, reaching its goals, as did the Social Democratic Party. The Japanese Communist Party did not reach its goals, while independents won the rest of the seats. The Liberal League and Green Political Assembly failed to win any seats.

===By prefecture===
Elected candidates in bold

Compiled from JANJAN&#x27;s &quot;The Senkyo&quot; and MIC official results.

&quot;Notes:&quot;
* &quot;All incumbents not running for re-election in their prefectural electoral district are counted as retirements even if they ran in the nationwide proportional representation.&quot;
* &quot;In a multi-member district, there is no difference between Councillors elected with the highest and lower vote shares. Yet, &quot;top tōsen&quot;, i.e. being elected with the highest vote, is considered a special achievement and thus noted where changed from the previous election for the same class of Councillors (1998).&quot;
* &quot;Niigata is counted as an SDP hold because the elected Councillor joined the SDP parliamentary group.&quot;

<doc id="809976" wikidata="Q2785145" url="?curid=809976" title="Supreme Court of Pennsylvania">
<text>The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania is the highest court in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Unified Judicial System. It also claims to be the oldest appellate court in the United States, a claim that is disputed by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania began in 1684 as the Provincial Court, and casual references to it as the &quot;Supreme Court&quot; of Pennsylvania were made official in 1722 upon its reorganization as an entity separate from the control of the colonial governor.

The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania maintains a discretionary docket, meaning that the Court may choose which cases it accepts, with the exception of mandatory death penalty appeals, and certain appeals from the original jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court. This discretion allows the Court to wield powerful influence on the formation and interpretation of Pennsylvania law.

==History==


The original Pennsylvania constitutions, drafted by William Penn, established a Provincial Court under the control of his British governors. The General Assembly, however, espoused the principle of separation of powers and formally called for a third branch of government starting with the 1701 Judiciary Bill. In 1722, the appointed British governor needed the House to raise revenues. House leaders agreed to raise taxes in return for an independent Supreme Court. Until 1776, legislation and judicial decisions in Pennsylvania, as in various American colonies, were subject to review by the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in London.

Between 1780 and 1808, a Pennsylvania High Court of Errors and Appeals existed, which was the court of last resort in Pennsylvania. After that court&#x27;s dissolution in 1808, the Commonwealth&#x27;s Supreme Court became, and remains, the court of last resort in the Pennsylvania judiciary.

The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania predates the United States Supreme Court by more than 100 years. Interpreting the Pennsylvania Constitution, it was one of the first appellate courts in the United States to claim the power to declare laws made by an elected legislative body unconstitutional (&quot;Respublica v. Duquet&quot;, 2 Yeates 493 (1799)).

==Composition and rules==
The court meets in three cities: Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Harrisburg.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court consists of seven justices, each elected to ten year terms. Supreme Court judicial candidates may run on party tickets. The justice with the longest continuous service on the court automatically becomes Chief Justice. Justices must step down from the Supreme Court when they reach the age of 75 (at the end of the calendar year), but they may continue to serve part-time as &quot;senior justices&quot; on panels of the Commonwealth&#x27;s lower appellate courts until they reach 78, the age of mandatory retirement.

Prior to 2002, judicial candidates in Pennsylvania were prohibited from expressing their views on disputed legal or political issues. However, after a similar law in Minnesota was struck down as unconstitutional (&quot;Republican Party of Minnesota v. White&quot;), the Pennsylvania rules were amended, and judicial candidates may now express political viewpoints as long as they do not &quot;commit or appear to commit the candidate with respect to cases, controversies or issues that are likely to come before the court.&quot; (PA Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 7 (B)(1)(c))

After the ten-year term expires, a statewide yes or no vote for retention is conducted. A judge who is retained serves another ten-year term. If the judge is not retained, the governor, subject to the approval of the State Senate, appoints a temporary replacement until a special election can be held. As of 2005, only one judge has failed to win retention. After the 2005 Pennsylvania General Assembly pay raise controversy, Justice Russell M. Nigro received a majority of no votes in the election of 2005. He was replaced by Justice Cynthia Baldwin, who was appointed by Governor Rendell in 2005.

Only one Supreme Court Justice, Rolf Larsen, has been removed from office by impeachment. In 1994, the State House of Representatives handed down articles of impeachment consisting of seven counts of misconduct. A majority of the State Senate voted against Larsen in five of the seven counts but only one charge garnered the two-thirds majority needed to convict.

Under the 1874 Constitution and until the Pennsylvania state constitution of 1968, Supreme Court justices were elected to 21-year terms. At the time, it was the longest term of any elected office in the United States.

==Justices==

<text>A blink comparator is a viewing apparatus formerly used by astronomers to find differences between two photographs of the night sky. It permits rapid switching from viewing one photograph to viewing the other, &quot;blinking&quot; back and forth between the two images taken of the same area of the sky at different times. This allows the user to more easily spot objects in the night sky that have changed position or brightness. It was also sometimes known as a blink microscope. It was invented in 1904 by physicist Carl Pulfrich at Carl Zeiss AG, then constituted as Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung.

In photographs taken a few days apart, rapidly moving objects such as asteroids and comets would stand out, because they would appear to be jumping back and forth between two positions, while all the distant stars remained stationary. Photographs taken at longer intervals could be used to detect stars with large proper motion, or variable stars, or to distinguish binary stars from optical doubles.

The most notable object in our solar system to be found using this technique is Pluto, discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930.

The Projection Blink Comparator (PROBLICOM), invented by amateur astronomer Ben Mayer, is a low-cost version of the professional tool. It consists of two slide projectors with a rotating occluding disk that alternately blocks the images from the projectors. This tool allowed amateur astronomers to contribute to some phases of serious research.

== Modern replacements ==
In modern times, charge-coupled devices (CCDs) have largely replaced photographic plates, as astronomical images are stored digitally on computers. The blinking technique can easily be performed on a computer screen rather than with a physical blink comparator apparatus as before.

The blinking technique is less used today, because image differencing algorithms detect moving objects more effectively than human eyes can. To measure the precise position of a known object whose direction and rate of motion are known, a &quot;track and stack&quot; software technique is used. Multiple images are superimposed such that the moving object is fixed in place; the moving object then stands out as a dot among the star trails. This is particularly effective in cases where the moving object is very faint and superimposing multiple images of it permits it to be seen better.

<doc id="809982" wikidata="Q1258935" url="?curid=809982" title="Common potoo">
<text>The common potoo, or poor-me-ones (Nyctibius griseus), or urutau is one of seven species of birds within the genus &quot;Nyctibius&quot;. It is notable for its large, yellow eyes and a wide mouth. Potoos are nocturnal and are related to nightjars and frogmouths. They lack the characteristic bristles around the mouths of true nightjars.

==Taxonomy==
The common potoo was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with all the nightjar-like species in the genus &quot;Caprimulgus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Caprimulgus griseus&quot;. Gmelin based his description on &quot;L&#x27;engoulevent gris&quot; from Cayenne that had been described from a preserved specimen in 1779 by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon. The common potoo is now one of the seven potoos placed in the genus &quot;Nyctibius&quot; that was introduced in 1816 by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot. The genus name is from the Ancient Greek &quot;nuktibios&quot; meaning &quot;night-feeding&quot;, from &quot;nux&quot; night and &quot;bios&quot; &quot;life&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;griseus&quot; is Medieval Latin meaning &quot;grey&quot;.

The common potoo was formerly considered to be conspecific with the northern potoo (&quot;Nyctibius jamaicensis&quot;). The species were split by the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union in 1995 based mainly on the differences in vocalization.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;N. g. panamensis&quot; Ridgway, 1912 – east Nicaragua to west Panama, west Colombia, and west Ecuador
* &quot;N. g. griseus&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1789) – north, central South America east of the Andes

==Description==
Common potoos are long with mottled red-brown, white, black, and grey cryptic plumage. This disruptive coloration allows the potoo to camouflage into branches. The sexes appear similar, and cannot be distinguished upon observation. The eyes can appear as giant black dots with a small yellow ring, or as giant yellow irises with small pupils due to voluntary pupil constriction. The potoo has two or three slits in the eyelid so that it can see when the eyelids are closed; these notches are always open. The upper and lower eyelids can be moved independently and rotated over the eye into the desired position so that the bird may adjust its field of vision. The common potoo has an unusually wide mouth with a tooth in its upper mandible for foraging purposes.

It has a haunting melancholic song, a &quot;BO-OU, BO-ou, bo-ou, bo-ou, bo-ou, bo-ou, bo-ou, bo-ou&quot; dropping in both pitch and volume. When seized, this bird produces a squeaky sound not unlike that of a crow. This call greatly differs from that of much deeper and more dramatic northern potoo.

==Distribution and habitat==
The nominate subspecies of the common potoo is found in Trinidad and Tobago and every mainland South American country except Chile, though it has been recorded in that country as a vagrant. There it ranges from the Andes to the Atlantic Ocean. &quot;N. g. panamensis&quot; is found from eastern Nicaragua south through Costa Rica and Panama and west of the Andes from northwestern Venezuela through Colombia and Ecuador into northwestern Peru.

The common potoo is a resident breeder in open woodlands and savannah. It avoids cooler montane regions; it is rarely observed over above mean sea level even in the hottest parts of its range. It tends to avoid arid regions but was recorded in the dry Caribbean plain of Colombia in April 1999. It has many populations in the gallery forest-type environment around the Uruguayan-Brazilian border. A bit further south, where the amount of wood-versus grassland is somewhat lower, it is decidedly rare, and due west, in the Entre Ríos Province of Argentina with its abundant riparian forest, it is likewise not common. The birds at the southern end of their range may migrate short distances northwards in winter.

==Behavior and ecology==
===Cryptic behavior===
The common potoo seeks to mimic the perch on which it rests, using a technique called masquerading. Adult and juvenile potoos choose perches that are similar in diameter to their own bodies so that they can better blend in with the stump. Most potoos choose stumps and other natural materials on which to rest, but some adults have been spotted perching on human-made items. These birds adjust their perching angle to best mimic the stump where they are.

The potoo sits with its eyes open and its bill horizontal while awake, but if disturbed, assumes an alert &quot;freezing&quot; posture. This entails sticking its beak vertically up in the air, closing its eyelids (through which it can still see via slits), and remaining still. If disturbed by larger animals, such as common marmosets (&quot;Callithrix jacchus&quot;), it may break its camouflage and try to chase the threat away. If disturbed by a human being, its behaviors can be quite variable - quickly flying away, intimidation via beak-opening, or remaining still even when being touched.

===Feeding===
This nocturnal insectivore hunts from a perch like a shrike or flycatcher. It uses its wide mouth to capture insects such as flies and moths, but also ants, other hymenopterans, termites, grasshoppers, locusts, and crickets. It has a unique tooth in its upper mandible to assist in foraging but swallows its prey whole.

===Breeding===
The common potoo chooses a stump high to occupy. It normally chooses a branch stump as a nest and adds no sort of decorative or insulative material. It ejects feces from its perch to keep the nest clean. If breeding, the potoo chooses a stump with a small divot where an egg can be laid.

Common potoos are monogamous. After mating, the female lays a single white egg with lilac spots directly into the depression in a tree limb. Parents normally care for one egg at a time. The male and female alternate brooding the egg while the other forages for insects. They divide brooding time evenly.

Potoos lay their eggs in December to begin their roughly 51-day nesting period, one of the longest nesting periods for birds their size. Young potoos hatch after about 33 days, using their egg tooth to break free and emerge as downy individuals with pale brown and white stripes. The hatchling is fed by regurgitation. Parents gradually decrease their presence in the nest with the juvenile as it matures. While the parents are away from the nest, the fledgling begins to feed on nearby flies and preen itself. Around 14 days old, the juvenile begins wing exercises and takes gradual steps toward leaving the nest. It ventures out on several flights, then returns to the nest with its parents, before departing for good about 25 days after hatching. Juveniles display disruptive coloration like adults, so they can also camouflage into a branch. Apart from flying away, chicks respond to disturbances in a similar manner to adults.

==Status==
The IUCN has assessed the common potoo as being of Least Concern. It has an extremely large range and a population of at least 500,000 mature individuals. However, the population is declining, probably due to habitat destruction.

<doc id="809990" wikidata="Q230863" url="?curid=809990" title="Ankhesenamun">
<text>Ankhesenamun (, &quot;Her Life Is of Amun&quot;; c. 1348 or c. 1342 – after 1322 BC) was an ancient Egyptian queen who lived during the 18th Dynasty of Egypt. Born Ankhesenpaaten (, &quot;she lives for the Aten&quot;), she was the third of six known daughters of the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten and his Great Royal Wife Nefertiti. She became the Great Royal Wife of Tutankhamun. The change in her name reflects the changes in ancient Egyptian religion during her lifetime after her father&#x27;s death. Her youth is well documented in the ancient reliefs and paintings of the reign of her parents. 

Ankhesenamun was well documented as being the Great Royal Wife of Pharaoh Tutankhamun. Initially, she may have been married to her father and it is possible that, upon the death of Tutankhamun, she was married briefly to Tutankhamun&#x27;s successor, Ay, who is believed by some to be her maternal grandfather.

DNA test results on mummies discovered in KV21 were released in February 2010, which has given rise to speculation that one of two late 18th Dynasty queens buried in that tomb could be Ankhesenamun. Because of their DNA, both mummies are thought to be members of that ruling house.

==Early life==

Ankhesenpaaten was born in a time when Egypt was in the midst of an unprecedented religious revolution (c. 1348 BC). Her parents had abandoned the principal worship of old deities of Egypt in favor of the Aten, hitherto a minor aspect of the sun-god, characterised as the sun&#x27;s disc.

She is believed to have been born in Thebes, around year 4 of her father&#x27;s reign, but probably grew up in the city of Akhetaten (present-day Amarna), established as the new capital of the kingdom by her parents. Her three eldest sisters – Meritaten, Meketaten, and Ankhesenpaaten – became the &quot;senior princesses&quot; and participated in many functions of the government and religion alongside their parents.

==Later life==
Following her mother’s death, she is believed to have been married first to her own father, which was not unusual for Egyptian royal families. She is thought to have been the mother of the princess Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit (possibly by her father or by Smenkhkare), although the parentage is unclear.

After her father&#x27;s death and the short reigns of Smenkhkare and Neferneferuaten, she became the wife of Tutankhamun. Following their marriage, the couple honored the deities of the restored religion by changing their names to Tutankhamun and Ankhesenamun. The couple appear to have had two stillborn daughters. As Tutankhamun&#x27;s only known wife was Ankhesenamun, it is highly likely the fetuses found in his tomb are her daughters. Some time in the 9th year of his reign, about the age of 18, Tutankhamun died suddenly, leaving Ankhesenamun alone and without an heir at about the age of 21.

A blue glass ring of unknown provenance obtained in 1931 depicts the prenomen of Ay and the name of Ankhesenamun enclosed in cartouches. This indicates that Ankhesenamun married Ay shortly before she disappeared from history, although no monuments show her as great royal wife to him. On the walls of Ay&#x27;s tomb it is Tey (Ay&#x27;s senior wife), not Ankhesenamun, who appears as his great royal wife. She probably died during or shortly after his reign and no burial has been found for her yet.

==Hittite letters==
A document was found in the ancient Hittite capital of Hattusa dating back to the Amarna period. The document—part of the so-called &quot;Deeds&quot; of Suppiluliuma I—relates that Hittite ruler, Suppiluliuma I, while laying siege to Karkemish, received a letter from the Egyptian queen. The letter reads:

My husband has died and I have no son. They say about you that you have many sons. You might give me one of your sons to become my husband. I would not wish to take one of my subjects as a husband... I am afraid.

This document is considered extraordinary, as Egyptians traditionally considered foreigners to be inferior. Suppiluliuma I was amazed and exclaimed to his courtiers:

Nothing like this has happened to me in my entire life!

Suppiluliuma sent an envoy to investigate and eventually did send one of his sons, Zannanza, but the prince died en route, perhaps being murdered.

The identity of the queen who wrote the letter is uncertain. In the Hittite annals, she is called Dakhamunzu, a transliteration of the Egyptian title, &quot;Tahemetnesu&quot; (The King&#x27;s Wife). Possible candidates for the author of the letter are Nefertiti, Meritaten, and Ankhesenamun. Ankhesenamun once seemed likely since there were no royal candidates for the throne on the death of her husband, Tutankhamun, whereas Akhenaten had at least two legitimate successors. But this was based on a 27-year reign for the last 18th dynasty, pharaoh Horemheb, who is now accepted to have had a shorter reign of only 14 years. Since Nefertiti was depicted as powerful as her husband in official monuments smiting Egypt&#x27;s enemies, researcher Nicholas Reeves believes she might be the Dakhamunzu in the Amarna correspondence. That would make the subject deceased Egyptian king appear to be Akhenaten rather than Tutankhamun. As noted, Akhenaten had potential heirs, including Tutankhamun, to whom Nefertiti could be married. Other researchers focus upon the phrase regarding marriage to &#x27;one of my subjects&#x27; (translated by some as &#x27;servants&#x27;) as possibly a reference to the Grand Vizier Ay or a secondary member of the Egyptian royal family line, however, and that Ankhesenamun may have been being pressured by Ay to marry him and legitimize his claim to the throne of Egypt (which she eventually did).

==Mummy KV21A==

DNA testing announced in February 2010 has generated speculation that Ankhesenamun is one of two 18th Dynasty queens recovered from KV21 in the Valley of the Kings.

The two fetuses found buried with Tutankhamun have been proven to be his children, and the current theory is that Ankhesenamun, his only known wife, is their mother. However, not enough data was obtained to make more than a tentative identification. Nevertheless, the KV21a mummy has DNA consistent with the 18th Dynasty royal line.

==KV63==
After excavating the tomb KV63, it is speculated that it was designed for Ankhesenamun due to its proximity to the tomb of Tutankhamun, KV62. Also found in the tomb were coffins (one with an imprint of a woman on it), women&#x27;s clothing, jewelry, and natron. Fragments of pottery bearing the partial name Paaten were also in the tomb. The only royal person known to bear this name was Ankhesenamun, whose name was originally Ankhesenpaaten. However, no mummies were found in KV63.

==Damnatio memoriae==
Ankhesenamun is believed to have married king Ay, Tutankhamun&#x27;s successor after her husband&#x27;s unexpected death. However, Ay and his army chief, Horemheb became political rivals at court during Ay&#x27;s reign. Ay attempted to sideline Horemheb from the royal succession by naming General Nakhtmin as the &quot;King Son&quot;. As Nozomu Kawai writes: &quot;This title is undoubtedly superior to Horemheb’s status. Therefore, King Ay intended to relegate Horemheb to a less important position and replace him with Nakhtmin to carry out his functions. We do not know exactly when Nakhtmin was promoted, but this must have created Horemheb’s strong hostility against King Ay.&quot; 
When Horemheb instead came to power as Ay&#x27;s successor and became the final king of the 18th dynasty of Egypt, he carried out a damnatio memoriae campaign against his rival Ay by usurping Ay&#x27;s mortuary temple, desecrating Ay&#x27;s WV23 royal tomb and erased as many inscriptions and depictions of Ay as possible in revenge. Ay&#x27;s royal sarcophagus in his tomb was smashed into numerous fragments. However, Ankhesenamun also fell victim to Horemheb&#x27;s anger at Ay&#x27;s actions. As Nozomu Kawai writes:
: &quot;At the same time, Ankhesenamun became the target of a damnatio memoriae by Horemheb. The evidence indicates that she was persecuted severely. On the lunette of the restoration stela of Tutankhamun, which was usurped by Horemheb, her figures were completely erased and replaced by an inscription instead of changing her image to that of his [ie. Horemheb&#x27;s] wife, Queen Mutnodjmet. An inlaid stela of Tutankhamun at Karnak shows a large, sharp, rectangular cavity containing some perforations behind the king who presents offering to Amun and Mut. The presence of the perforations indicates that there was a figure behind him. Since the figure of the queen is regularly behind the king, it is probable that the figure of Ankhesenamun was deliberately removed by Horemheb. These extreme acts of damnatio memoriae against Ankhesenamun were probably due to some historical events that rankled Horemheb.&quot;

Horemheb, therefore, attempted to erase all memory of Ay, Ay&#x27;s allies and Ankhesenamun when he became pharaoh.

==Popular culture==
Ankhesenamun&#x27;s name has entered popular culture as the secret love of the priest Imhotep in the 1932 film &quot;The Mummy&quot;. The 1999 remake, its sequel and its spin-off television series used the name Anck-su-namun, while other movies like &quot;The Mummy&#x27;s Hand&quot; (1940) and the 1959 remake named the character Ananka.

Ankhsenpaaten/Ankhsenamun is the heroine protagonist of the novel &quot;The Lost Queen of Egypt&quot; written by Lucille Morrison in 1937 detailing a fictionalized version of the princess&#x27; life before and after marriage to Tutankhamen.

Ankhesenamun is the protagonist of the 1988 French novel &quot;La Reine Soleil&quot; by Christian Jacq, as well as its 2007 animated adaptation&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="810001" wikidata="Q945172" url="?curid=810001" title="Carter–Finley Stadium">
<text>Wayne Day Family Field at Carter–Finley Stadium is a college football stadium located in Raleigh, North Carolina. It has been home to the NC State Wolfpack football team of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) since 1966 and has a current seating capacity of 56,919 seats.

==History==
As early as the 1950s, State was looking to replace its on-campus facility, Riddick Stadium. The concrete-and-wood stadium had been built in 1907 and was showing signs of decline. It never held more than 23,000 seats (14,000 permanent) at any time. Partly because of this, many of longtime coach Earle Edwards&#x27; teams played more games on the road than at home. At Edwards&#x27; urging, school officials began a concerted effort to build a more modern facility

The new stadium finally opened in 1966. It was originally named Carter Stadium, in honor of Harry C. &amp; Wilbert J. &quot;Nick&quot; Carter, both graduates of the university. They were major contributors to the original building of the stadium. The name of Albert E. Finley, another major contributor to the university, was added in September 1979.

While located on University land, the stadium is a few miles to the west of the academic campus on Trinity Road, just off Hillsborough Street.

Carter–Finley Stadium&#x27;s season tickets have been sold out for nine straight years.

Carter–Finley Stadium has the smallest clearance between the stands and the sidelines of any stadium in the ACC.

Honored numbers displayed on the west facade of Carter–Finley Stadium include those of Roman Gabriel (18), Torry Holt (81), Philip Rivers (17), Bill Yoest (63), Dennis Byrd (77), Dick Christy (40), Jim Ritcher (51), Ted Brown (23), Mario Williams, Bradley Chubb (9), Russell Wilson (16), and Payton Wilson (11). Gabriel, Ritcher, Christy, Brown, Holt, Byrd, Yoest, and Rivers&#x27; numbers are retired. Carter–Finley also displays banners from NC State&#x27;s bowl appearances which include the Gator Bowl, Peach Bowl, and Liberty Bowl.

On November 25th, 2024, NC State University Athletics announced a partnership with Independent Sports and Entertainment (ISE) to seek a potential naming rights partner for the stadium, citing &quot;...the blessing of the Carter and Finley families&quot; for the process.

===Renovations===
Prior to the 2001 season, the university began a program of modernization of the stadium by enclosing the southern end zone with seats, and the state-of-the-art Murphy Center (named for Wendell Murphy) was built behind it. Following the 2004 football season, Carter–Finley was again expanded with the completion of the &quot;Vaughn Towers&quot;, a complex of luxury boxes, club seats, and media facilities which opened for the 2005 football season.

For the 2006 season, a new north end zone grandstand was added consisting of 5,730 new chairback, bench, and handicap-accessible seating with another 1,630 permanent bleacher seats built underneath the video scoreboard making Carter–Finley a bowl and giving it a capacity of 57,583 spectators. Additional upgrades to the stadium included a new north end zone plaza with concession stands and the addition of two video screens in each corner of the south end zone.

Renovations done before the 2023 season included a new north end videoboard that was more than double the size of the previous screen and sound system upgrades for better performance for concerts and musical performances. Construction commenced after the completion of the 2023 NHL Stadium Series game between the Carolina Hurricanes and the Washington Capitals on February 18.

==Notable events==
===Concerts===

===Soccer===

On July 28, 2011, the World Football Challenge held an exhibition match between Juventus of Italy&#x27;s Serie A, and Guadalajara Chivas of Mexico&#x27;s Primera Division at the stadium.

=== Hockey ===

The National Hockey League announced on February 15, 2020, that the Carolina Hurricanes would host a Stadium Series game at Carter–Finley Stadium on February 20, 2021. The NHL announced on December 23, 2020, that the game had been postponed. On February 4, 2022, the NHL announced the game would take place in February 2023. On March 3, 2022, the NHL announced the game would take place on February 18, 2023, between the Hurricanes and the Washington Capitals.

The Hurricanes defeated the Capitals 4–1 with 56,961 fans in attendance.

Following the stadium series game, NC State&#x27;s club hockey program, the IcePack, defeated the North Carolina Tar Heels 7–3 in front of an estimated 24,000 fans.

===Other events===
*Carter-Finley served as the primary venue for the 1999 Special Olympics World Summer Games from June 26 to July 4, 1999.

<text>Nyctibius is a genus of potoos, nocturnal birds in the family Nyctibiidae.

== Etymology ==
The genus &quot;Nyctibius&quot; was introduced in 1816 by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot to accommodate a single species, Comte de Buffon&#x27;s &quot;Le Grande Engoulevent de Cayenne&quot;, the great potoo, which thus becomes the type species. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;nuktibios&quot; meaning &quot;night-feeding&quot;, from &quot;nux&quot; night and &quot;bios&quot; &quot;life&quot;.

== Distribution ==
They are found throughout much of Mexico, Central America, South America, and parts of the Caribbean.

== Taxonomy ==
They are one of two genera in the family, the other being the monotypic genus &quot;Phyllaemulor&quot; (containing only the rufous potoo). Prior to 2018, they were considered the only extant genus within the Nyctibiidae; however, a study that year found a deep divergence between the rufous potoo and all other species in the genus, leading it to be described in a new genus and expanding the number of genera within the family. This was followed by the International Ornithological Congress in 2022.
The genus &quot;Nyctibius&quot; contains six species:

<doc id="810040" wikidata="Q143660" url="?curid=810040" title="East Greenland Current">
<text>The East Greenland Current (EGC) is a cold, low-salinity current that extends from Fram Strait (~80N) to Cape Farewell (~60N). The current is located off the eastern coast of Greenland along the Greenland continental margin. The current cuts through the Nordic Seas (the Greenland and Norwegian Seas) and through the Denmark Strait. The current is of major importance because it directly connects the Arctic to the Northern Atlantic, it is a major contributor to sea ice export out of the Arctic, and it is a major freshwater sink for the Arctic.

==Water properties==
The EGC is composed of a mixture of three distinct water masses. The water masses are Polar Water, Atlantic Water, and Deep Water. These water masses can be clearly seen throughout the EGC&#x27;s tract southward, however, the upper layer water masses do change some due to atmospheric interaction along with inflow from other water sources in the Nordic Seas. The top 150 meters of the EGC is considered polar water and it is cold and low in salinity. The lowness in salinity has a lot to do with freshwater run off from sea ice melting, river runoff, and Pacific water flux and it is cold due to air-sea interactions while in the Arctic. Typical characteristics for the EGC Polar water are a temperature between 0 °C and –1.7 °C (e.g. freezing point of low-salinity sea water), and the salinity varies greatly from 30 psu (near the surface) to 34 psu at a 150-meter depth. The layer beneath the Polar Water is known as the Atlantic Water layer. It extends down to about 1000 m. This layer is defined as having relatively warm temperatures and saline waters. The temperatures are normally above 0 °C and have a salinity of 34 psu at 150 meters and it increases to about 35 psu at 1000 meters. The Atlantic water that is seen in the EGC comes from two different sources. The first source of Atlantic Water originates from westward directed Atlantic water in the West Spitsbergen Current. This current sends Atlantic water (AW) into the Fram Strait, and because it is more dense than the surface Polar water it sinks to an intermediate depth. The second source of AW in the EGC originates from recirculated AW in the Arctic. This is AW that has entered the Arctic via the North Atlantic and has been circulating in the Arctic and is now being pushed out of the Arctic via the EGC. The layer beneath the Atlantic Water is simply referred to as the Deep Water where the salinity and temperatures are relatively constant. This level typically extends from 1000 meters to the bottom of the ocean. The temperatures in this bottom level are normally below 0 °C and the salinity is around 34.9 psu.

The deep water masses (&gt;1600 m) are recirculated within the Greenland Sea due to the Jan Mayen fracture zone. Here, the deep water encounters the Jan Mayen Ridge and are deflected eastward towards the interior of the Greenland Sea Gyre. The upper layers are able to pass into the waters north of Iceland unhindered. It is important to note that these recirculated deep water masses in the Greenland Sea Gyre will be recirculated into the EGC once again in the future near Fram Strait.

==Dynamics==
The general movement of the EGC is southward along the eastern Greenland continental margin. The currents are quite strong with annual averages of 6–12 cm/s in the upper part of the EGC (&lt;500 m) with inter-annual maximums of 20–30 cm/s. It was estimated in 1991 by Hopkins &quot;et al.&quot; that the transport of water southward ranged from 2–32 sverdrups. That is quite a large variation that they attributed to the widely varying strength of the Atlantic Water flow at intermediate depths. More recent estimations of water transport in the top layers (&lt;800 m) of the EGC is between 3 and 4 sverdrups.

==Export of Arctic Sea ice==
One of the most important aspects of the East Greenland Current is the amount of sea ice it exports into the North Atlantic Ocean. It is a major pathway for sea ice to leave the Arctic. It is estimated that more than 90% of the Arctic Sea Ice exported from the Arctic takes place within the East Greenland Current. The volume of ice exported on an annual scale is a strong function of multiple atmospheric variables (wind, temperature, etc.) and oceanic variables and dynamics. There is a maximum of ice-flux export from October through December and a minimum from January to March. This interannual variability occurs because during the summer months the sea ice melts back quite a bit, and it results in a lot of drifting sea ice that can be easily exported through Fram Strait during the windy times of October through December. During the winter months, the sea ice refreezes together and thus the ability to have numerous sea ice drifts decreases due to the increase in overall sea ice extent. Essentially open water drifting decreases substantially during the winter months. The volume export ranges greatly from year to year. It can be as high as 5000 km3/year and as low as 1000 km3/year.

Atmospheric forcings also have a strong impact on Arctic Sea Ice export through the EGC. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)/Arctic Oscillation (AO) has a profound impact on the wind field over the Arctic. During high NAO/AO indexes the cyclonic wind field over the Arctic becomes very strong, this transports more ice out through Fram Strait and into the EGC. During low NAO/AO indexes the cyclonic wind field is quite small and thus the transport out of the Fram Strait diminishes greatly.

==Current research==
Current research in the EGC is largely focused on freshwater fluxes (in the ocean and also as sea ice). Because the EGC runs through the Greenland Sea and eventually through the Labrador Sea (as the West Greenland Current) it can have strong implications for the strengthening and or weakening of deep water formation in the Greenland and Labrador Seas. The Meridional Overturning Circulation is a density driven circulation in which a small perturbation in the density field could easily slow down or speed up the deep water formation in the Nordic Seas. Jones &quot;et al.&quot; note that there are three different freshwater sources for the EGC: Pacific water, river runoff, and sea-ice meltwater. They find that the biggest contributor to the freshening of the EGC is due to river runoff, followed by Pacific water, and a distant last is sea-ice meltwater (nearly negligible). They find that even though these sources freshen the EGC, these specific sources do not penetrate very well into the central Greenland Sea where the deep convection takes place. They then decide that there must be some other freshwater influence in the central Greenland Sea. They believe it may be from solid sea ice being transported to the central Greenland Sea and then melting. Solid sea ice is very mobile, and winds can easily direct its flow along with ocean currents. Previous thoughts were that the recirculation of the EGC in the Greenland Sea via the Jan Mayen Fracture Zone helps lead to a freshening of the central Greenland Sea, however, Rudels &quot;et al.&quot; disproved this theory and said it must be due to solid sea ice melt and precipitation in the central Greenland Sea.

<text>MS &quot;Mikhail Lermontov&quot; was an ocean liner owned by the Soviet Union&#x27;s Baltic Shipping Company, built in 1972 by V.E.B. Mathias-Thesen Werft, Wismar, East Germany. It was later converted into a cruise ship. On 16 February 1986 it collided with rocks near Port Gore in the Marlborough Sounds, New Zealand, and sank, claiming the life of one of its crew members.

==MS &quot;Mikhail Lermontov&quot;==

MS &quot;Mikhail Lermontov&quot;, launched in 1972, was the last of the five &quot;poet&quot; ships: , , (later became &quot;Marco Polo&quot;), and &quot;Mikhail Lermontov&quot;, named after famous Ukrainian, Georgian and Russian writers (Ivan Franko and Taras Shevchenko being Ukrainian, and Shota Rustaveli being Georgian), built to the same design at V.E.B. Mathias-Thesen Werft, Wismar, East Germany. Mikhail Lermontov, born 1814 and died 1841, was known as the &quot;poet of Caucasus.&quot;

MS &quot;Mikhail Lermontov&quot; was originally used as an ocean liner on the Leningrad–New York run. However, the Soviet government realised that there was more money to be made by converting it to a cruise ship, and the accommodation and facilities on board were significantly upgraded in 1982 to meet the expectations of western customers.

===Background===
On 16 February 1986 &quot;Mikhail Lermontov&quot; was cruising in New Zealand for the CTC cruise company. On that day it left Picton for the Marlborough Sounds, carrying mostly elderly Australian passengers. The Picton pilot, Don Jamison (who was also a Picton harbourmaster), piloted the ship out of Picton. His presence, and his knowledge of the area, should have assured the safety of MS &quot;Mikhail Lermontov&quot;.

Hugging the shoreline to give the Australian passengers a good view of the area, Jamison continued towards the cape. About one mile from Cape Jackson, Jamison made the decision to take MS &quot;Mikhail Lermontov&quot; through the passage. A Russian officer questioned the decision, but the harbour-master assured him it would be a safe course, and at the time the decision was made the ship was still within the harbour limits.

Little more is known of the circumstances of the wrecking, even to the retirement of Jamison in 2006.

===Disaster===
On 6 February 1986, &quot;Mikhail Lermontov&quot; sailed from Sydney on the beginning of a two-week cruise around New Zealand, carrying 372 passengers and a crew of 348, which combined to a total of 743 people. On the evening of 16 February, &quot;Mikhail Lermontov&quot; was sailing past Cape Jackson, on the northeastern shore of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, about northwest of Picton. At 5:37 pm, travelling at , &quot;Mikhail Lermontov&quot; struck rocks about below the waterline on its port side.

By 8:30 pm, passengers began to abandon ship, with the aid of the crew and local rescue vessels. The passengers were transferred to several ships in the area, including the LPG tanker (Captain Reedman) and the SeaRail road-rail ferry (Capt John Brew).
As darkness set in MS &quot;Mikhail Lermontov&quot; listed further to starboard. Within 20 minutes of the last passenger being rescued, the ship had disappeared completely, sinking at approximately 10:27pm, 4 hours and 50 minutes after running aground. The sinking resulted in one casualty, 33-year-old crew engineer Pavel Zagladimov, who went down with the ship. The coroner&#x27;s report lists his official cause of death as &#x27;unknown&#x27;, as his remains were never found. Eleven of those rescued had minor injuries.

==Wreck==

MS &quot;Mikhail Lermontov&quot; rests where it sank, lying on its starboard side in depths reaching up to a maximum of about . It is popular with scuba divers and the site is served by local dive shops in Picton and Kaikōura.
It is also one of the biggest, easily accessible, diveable ship wrecks in the world. The dives range from an easy depth at the top of the wreck, through to deep penetration and decompression dives to depths of . It is possible to enter the wreck, especially in the open public areas accessible from the port side windows near the top of the wreck, although care must be taken and guides familiar with the wreck are highly recommended, especially for enclosed overhead environments and where entanglement hazards may exist. Closed circuit diving is recommended to avoid causing reduced visibility when entering enclosed areas such as restaurants, crew messes, and shopping arcades. Three divers are known to have died while exploring the ship, including one diver whose body is still possibly trapped inside.

===Cause as established by New Zealand inquiry===
The New Zealand preliminary inquiry report found that;
&quot;at the time of the grounding the ship&#x27;s courses and speeds were being directed by Captain D.I. Jamison in the employ of the Marlborough Harbour Board as Harbourmaster and chief pilot.&quot;

&quot;The decision to direct the ship through the channel was made by Captain Jamison without consulting any other person at the time the ship was in position Lat 41˚ 01&#x27; 04&quot; S Long 174 19&#x27; 30&quot; E.&quot;

&quot;When Captain Jamison observed the passage between Cape Jackson and the Cape Jackson light house, to open up, he made a sudden decision to navigate the ship through that passage.&quot;

The 1986 New Zealand Minister of Transport Richard Prebble later stated of the captain&#x27;s actions, &quot;why he decided to guide the ship over a passage that he actually knew was too shallow, I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;ll ever be able to answer.&quot;

===Cause as established by Soviet inquiry===
The Soviet commission of inquiry concluded that;
&quot;Pilot Don Jamieson took a decision which was not justified by anything and gave a command to steer the ship through the dangerous for navigation passage between Cape Jackson and Jackson Head which must not be passed through because of insufficient depths for a ship of such draught.&quot;
Nevertheless, the Russian navigator, chief officer Sergey Stepanishchev was sent to prison for 4 years &quot;with labor&quot; and fined $US30,000 because he did not overrule the pilot. New Zealand Prime Minister at the time of the sinking, David Lange, called the sentence &quot;totally absurd; it&#x27;s an instance of totalitarian justice being meted out to a man who had no ... responsibility for steering the ship anywhere near Port Jackson. In fact, he&#x27;d been stood down in favour of Captain Jamison.&quot; As harsh as it may seem - &quot;The presence of a pilot on board does not relieve the master or officer in charge of the watch from their duties or obligations for the safety of the ship&quot; 

==Court case==

The disaster was the subject of the celebrated Australian restitution case &quot;Baltic Shipping Company v Dillon&quot; (The Mikhail Lermontov) (1993) 176 CLR 344, in which Mrs Dillon, having already been awarded damages for loss to both her possessions and person, as well as a pro-rata refund on her cruise ticket, claimed restitution for the remaining value of her ticket on the basis of failure of consideration. Rejecting proposed analyses of the cruise as an entire obligation, and alternatively as a payment conditional on performance, the High Court re-affirmed the rule that failure of consideration must be total in order for a claim for restitution to be sustained. Simply put, Mrs Dillon could not deny the benefit she received during her first eight days on the cruise. Furthermore, the court, following earlier English authority, held that full damages and complete restitution will not be given for the same breach of contract. The now-abolished forms of action cast a long shadow: a claim for money had and received evolved from the writ of indebitatus assumpsit, a legal fiction that the parties had an implied agreement that upon discharge for breach or frustration that the subject matter of the original agreement would be returned. An alternative form of action lay in debt. In &quot;Holmes v Hall&quot; (1677) 2 Mod 260, it was recognised that where concurrent claims existed and a claim in assumpsit indebitatus was available, the claim in assumpsit operated to exclude other claims. In the &#x27;modern&#x27; language of &quot;Dutch v Warren&quot; (1720) 1 Stra 406, &#x27;[the defendant] has given the plaintiff an option to disaffirm the contract, and recover the consideration he was paid for it in the same manner as if it had never existed...but then the contract must be totally rescinded...;since otherwise, the contract is affirmed by the plaintiff&#x27;s having received part of that equivalent for which he has paid his consideration, and it is then reduced to a mere question of damages proportionate to the extent to which it remains unperformed.&#x27;

<text>Cattle Decapitation is an American deathgrind band formed in San Diego, California, in 1996. The band&#x27;s current lineup includes vocalist Travis Ryan, guitarists Josh Elmore and Belisario Dimuzio, bassist Olivier Pinard, and drummer David McGraw. Since 2001, none of the founding members remain with the band. Despite not being in the original lineup, Ryan and Elmore are the only constant members on all of Cattle Decapitation&#x27;s eight studio albums.

==History==
Cattle Decapitation was formed in 1996 by singer Scott Miller, guitarist Gabe Serbian, and drummer Dave Astor. The band put out their first material in 1996 with a demo called &quot;Ten Torments of the Damned.&quot; Scott Miller left the band in circa 1997 and Travis Ryan joined the band. In 1999 their first EP Human Jerky was recorded and in 2000 their second EP Homovore was recorded. The two EPs were both recorded at Double Time Studios with recording engineer Jeff Forrest. Guitarist Gabe Serbian ended up leaving the band 2001 to focus on The Locust. Guitarist Josh Elmore and bassist Troy Oftedal joined the band right after. 

Cattle Decapitation&#x27;s first album &quot;To Serve Man&quot; came out in 2002 and saw controversy in Germany, where distribution company SPV refused to handle the album due to its graphic cover. The cover of the 2004 album &quot;Humanure&quot;, featuring a cow excreting human remains, was reportedly censored without permission from the label in some outlets. Record store owners did not display the album, making it difficult for customers to find and buy it.
In August 2009, Cattle Decapitation parted ways with long-time bassist Troy Oftedal because of &quot;musical and personal differences&quot;. Cattle Decapitation&#x27;s album &quot;Monolith of Inhumanity&quot; was released in 2012. It received positive reviews upon release.

Cattle Decapitation has toured with extreme metal acts including Suffocation, Cryptopsy, The Black Dahlia Murder, Deicide, Behemoth, Hate Eternal, Krisiun, Revocation, and Job for a Cowboy. The band also participated in Metal Blade Records&#x27; Scion A/V Showcase in late 2012.

The band spent the majority of 2014 writing &quot;The Anthropocene Extinction&quot;. Alongside the announcement of the album title in May 2015, the band released the first song of the record, titled &quot;Manufactured Extinct&quot;. It was released through Metal Blade on August 7, 2015.

On April 30, 2018, two Native American teens were pulled out of a Colorado State University tour by the police for being &quot;too quiet&quot; and wearing &quot;dark clothing.&quot; When the band found out that one of the brothers was wearing Cattle Decapitation T-shirts, they offered the brothers &quot;free guest list spots for life.&quot;

In August 2018, the band announced the addition of Cryptopsy bass player Olivier Pinard, as well as the promotion of touring rhythm guitarist Belisario Dimuzio to being a full time member, thus making the group a five piece for the first time. The recording of the seventh studio album &quot;Death Atlas&quot; began in May 2019, and was released on November 29, 2019.

In November 2022, the band announced at a concert in Las Vegas that they planned on releasing a new album in May 2023. At the show, they played the new song &quot;We Eat Our Young&quot; from the upcoming, then unnamed album.

The band released their eighth album, &quot;Terrasite&quot;, on May 12, 2023, which currently stands as their most popular album.

==Lyrical themes==
Cattle Decapitation&#x27;s songs protest the exploitation and consumption of animals, the abuse of the environment and subjects such as misanthropy and genocide of the human race. Much of the band&#x27;s music is based on putting humans in the situations that animals are subjected to, for example animal testing, slaughter, etc. The band&#x27;s lyrics are largely concerned with human impact on the environment, the ethics of eating meat and animal rights. 

Ryan comments: &quot;Josh and I are what you would call &quot;vegetarian&quot;. We&#x27;ve tried and tried to be as up front about that as possible but the entire media world thinks we are hardline vegan, which in turn trickled down to fans and we&#x27;re just not. I&#x27;ve been vegan at points but I try to be as correct as possible and point blank, there&#x27;s times on tour where I just don&#x27;t know if what I&#x27;ve been given to eat has eggs or dairy in it and the road is rather unfriendly to us. We aren&#x27;t afforded the luxury of going to a Whole Foods at 3 am after a show. At that point it&#x27;s fucking Taco Bell or something disgusting. You&#x27;re driving down the road burning fossil fuels and your vehicle is covered in the carcasses of insects and sometimes birds and other animals. So how far does one take it? This is why I can&#x27;t claim vegan. I live my life with as much compassion as I can for others, the environment and the animals though. At home it&#x27;s much easier.&quot;

Metal author and journalist Garry Sharpe-Young once acknowledged the band as &quot;one of the few metal bands whose message hits as hard as their music&quot;.

Members of Cattle Decapitation have cited Carcass, Cryptopsy, and Suffocation as influences.

<doc id="810053" wikidata="Q908712" url="?curid=810053" title="The Black Dahlia Murder (band)">
<text>The Black Dahlia Murder is an American melodic death metal band from Waterford, Michigan, formed in 2001. Their name is derived from the 1947 unsolved murder of Elizabeth Short, often referred to as Black Dahlia. , the band consists of lead vocalist Brian Eschbach, bassist Max Lavelle, drummer Alan Cassidy, and guitarist Ryan Knight. The Black Dahlia Murder has undergone various lineup changes, with Trevor Strnad and Eschbach remaining the only constant members, until the former&#x27;s death in 2022, which then saw Eschbach take over lead vocals and Knight (who was the band&#x27;s lead guitarist from 2009 to 2016) replacing him on rhythm guitar.

Following the release of a 2001 demo album and a 2002 EP, the Black Dahlia Murder signed to Metal Blade Records in 2003, who released their debut studio album &quot;Unhallowed&quot; that same year. Out of the nine studio albums the band have released to date, the last eight have charted on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with their fifth album &quot;Ritual&quot; peaking at No. 31 in 2011, marking them as one of the most popular contemporary American extreme metal bands. Their tenth and latest album, &quot;Servitude&quot;, was released on September 27, 2024.

==History==
===Formation, &quot;Unhallowed&quot; and &quot;Miasma&quot; (2001–2006)===

The Black Dahlia Murder began its inception during late 2000 and gained the final band lineup in January 2001. The group released their demo entitled &quot;What a Horrible Night to Have a Curse&quot;, and a four-track EP, &quot;A Cold-Blooded Epitaph&quot;, the latter of which the group released on Lovelost Records. After appearing in concerts such as the Milwaukee Metal Fest, the Black Dahlia Murder signed to Metal Blade Records in 2003.

Bassist Ryan &quot;Bart&quot; Williams left his former band, Detroit&#x27;s Today I Wait, to tour with the Black Dahlia Murder. After touring with the band on their co-headlining gig with Throwdown and their European dates with Liar, he joined the group full-time, replacing former bassist David Lock. Frontman Trevor Strnad said that Lock was fired for incompetency. Williams was one of two engineers (the other being Walls of Jericho&#x27;s Mike Hasty) on the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Unhallowed&quot;. The band then went on a tour in late 2004 supporting Unearth alongside Terror and Remembering Never throughout the United States.

The band&#x27;s second album &quot;Miasma&quot; was released on July 12, 2005, and peaked at No. 118 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. After touring for &quot;Miasma&quot;, drummer Zach Gibson left the band along with Pierre Langlois. While Gibson went on to join Abigail Williams, Langlois left the band for a more secure lifestyle, and the band finished their search for a replacement drummer when they found former All That Remains drummer, Shannon Lucas. The group played at Ozzfest 2005.

===&quot;Nocturnal&quot; and &quot;Deflorate&quot; (2006–2010)===

Their third album, entitled &quot;Nocturnal&quot;, was released on September 18, 2007. The album debuted at No. 72 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The Black Dahlia Murder announced via their MySpace profile that they were going on a U.S. tour with Cannibal Corpse to promote their new album &quot;Nocturnal&quot; and celebrate the 25 years that Metal Blade Records had been in business. They were joined by label-mates The Red Chord, Aeon, The Absence, and Goatwhore. In January/February 2008, the band embarked on a U.S. headlining tour with 3 Inches of Blood, Hate Eternal, and Decrepit Birth, followed by another alongside Brain Drill and Animosity. They were on Hot Topic&#x27;s &quot;Summer Slaughter Tour&quot; with Kataklysm, Cryptopsy, Vader, Whitechapel, and Despised Icon.

Their longtime lead guitarist, John Kempainen left the band and was replaced by Ryan Knight during the beginning of 2009. In May 2009, the Black Dahlia Murder released their first DVD, &quot;Majesty&quot;. The DVD contains a documentary and live footage from the Summer Slaughter tour and their tour supporting Children of Bodom in late 2008. The DVD also contains all of their music videos and behind the scenes footage.

The Black Dahlia Murder released &quot;Deflorate&quot; on September 15, 2009, via Metal Blade Records. The album sold 12,000 copies in the United States in the first week of the release, debuted at position No. 43 &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top 200 charts, No. 5 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Independent Albums chart, No. 4 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Hard Music Albums chart, and No. 50 on HITS Top 50 Albums chart. They toured with Children of Bodom and Skeletonwitch in support of the album. After their 2010 headlining tour with Goatwhore and Arkaik, the band began writing and recording their next full-length album.

===&quot;Ritual&quot; and member changes (2011–2013)===
In February 2011, the Black Dahlia Murder completed the songwriting process for their fifth studio album, entitled &quot;Ritual&quot;. It was released on June 21, 2011, in North America. The band supported Amon Amarth on their May 2011 European tour, as well as headlined the 2011 Summer Slaughter tour, both in support of &quot;Ritual&quot;. Before the record&#x27;s release, the track &quot;Moonlight Equilibrium&quot; was posted to the Metal Blade Records website on April 29, 2011, to critical and fan acclaim. A music video for &quot;Moonlight Equilibrium&quot; was released on February 20, 2012. In April 2012 during the New England Metal and Hardcore Festival on the first night performance, Trevor Strnad officially welcomed new bassist Max Lavelle into the band after former bassist Ryan Williams parted ways. On November 7, Shannon Lucas announced via a YouTube video that he would be stepping down as drummer of the Black Dahlia Murder to pursue other aspirations. Alan Cassidy of Abigail Williams filled in for Shannon&#x27;s touring duties.

===&quot;Everblack&quot; and &quot;Abysmal&quot; (2013–2016)===
In early 2013, despite the news of the departure of two band members (drummer Shannon Lucas and bassist Bart Williams), plans were announced for an upcoming album release, to be entitled &quot;Everblack&quot;. Tentative plans estimated its release to be early summer 2013, likely June. On April 10, 2013, the iTunes Store was updated with official release and availability information, including cover art, a full track listing, and an official U.S. release date of June 11, 2013. The album has 10 tracks in total. On the same day, the band&#x27;s first single from &quot;Everblack&quot; was made available for purchase and download, titled &quot;Into The Everblack&quot;. The album itself was then released on June 11 and peaked at No. 32 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

On November 28, 2014 (the day after Thanksgiving), the Black Dahlia Murder released a 7-inch EP titled &quot;Grind &#x27;Em All&quot; featuring 3 short grindcore covers of punk rock songs: a cover of &quot;Ripped Up&quot; by Left for Dead, of &quot;Rebel Without a Car&quot; by Sedition and of &quot;Populous&quot; by Gyga. The covers were originally recorded almost 10 years earlier during the era of &quot;Miasma&quot;. The EP was released as part of Record Store Day&#x27;s Black Friday event via A389 Recordings (rather than the band&#x27;s label, Metal Blade Records), made available for purchase on the band&#x27;s online merchandise store and also streamed in its entirety via Exclaim!. The album art for &quot;Grind &#x27;Em All&quot; was designed by Szymon Siech.
Lead guitarist Ryan Knight confirmed in early 2015 that the band will deliver a seventh studio release that year, followed by extensive touring, and that he is planning to start working on a solo album afterwards. Vocalist Trevor Strnad stated that the band&#x27;s new album, titled &quot;Abysmal&quot;, will be &quot;more raw and natural sounding&quot; and feature &quot;more dynamic and developed songs&quot; than their previous work. &quot;Vlad, Son of the Dragon&quot;, the first song from the album, was released online on June 24, followed by &quot;Receipt&quot; on July 22 and &quot;Threat Level No. 3&quot; on August 19. &quot;Abysmal&quot; was produced by Mark Lewis and Ryan Williams and released worldwide through Metal Blade on September 18. In early February 2016, it was announced that Knight had left the band. He was replaced on lead guitar by Brandon Ellis of Arsis.

===&quot;Nightbringers&quot;, &quot;Verminous&quot;, Strnad&#x27;s death and &quot;Servitude&quot; (2017–present)===
The band&#x27;s 8th album &quot;Nightbringers&quot; was released on October 6, 2017, to critical and commercial acclaim, charting at 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

The Black Dahlia Murder released their ninth studio album, &quot;Verminous&quot;, on April 17, 2020.

On May 11, 2022, it was announced that the band&#x27;s frontman Trevor Strnad had died. While no official cause of death has been given, the phone number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline was provided at the end of the statement.

On September 14, 2022, the Black Dahlia Murder announced a tribute concert taking place for Trevor Strnad on October 28 at Saint Andrew&#x27;s Hall in Detroit, supported by Darkest Hour and Plague Years. It was also announced that Brian Eschbach would be stepping down from guitar and taking over vocals, as Eschbach himself said in an interview with &quot;Decibel&quot; magazine: &quot;I know Trevor would keep this band going if I went down a deep, dark path and weren&#x27;t here.&quot; In Eschbach&#x27;s place, Ryan Knight returned to the band as their rhythm guitarist.

In November 2023, The Black Dahlia Murder entered the studio to begin recording their tenth studio album for a 2024 release.

On June 13, 2024, the band released the single, &quot;Aftermath&quot;, from their tenth studio album, &quot;Servitude&quot;, which was released on September 27.

On February 20, 2025, Brandon Ellis announced he had departed the band.

==Tours==

The Black Dahlia Murder headlined the 2008 Summer Slaughter Tour with Kataklysm, Vader, Cryptopsy, The Faceless, Despised Icon, Aborted, Born of Osiris, Psycroptic, and Whitechapel.
In late 2008, they joined a U.S. tour with Finland&#x27;s Children of Bodom and Raleigh, NC&#x27;s Between the Buried and Me. They were initially announced as &quot;... with special guests&quot; at the start of the tour, though it was later confirmed by Revolver Magazine that they were on tour. They appeared on the Hot Topic Stage in the 2009 Rockstar Energy Mayhem Festival. In late 2009, they embarked on a U.S. tour with Finland&#x27;s Children of Bodom and Skeletonwitch. The band headlined the Bonecrusher Fest tour of Europe in Spring 2010 alongside 3 Inches of Blood, Necrophobic, Obscura, The Faceless, Carnifex and Ingested. In August 2010 they played at the Hevy Music Festival near Folkestone, UK. The band played the entire Warped Tour 2013. As a tribute to the 10th anniversary of the &quot;Nocturnal&quot; album, they headlined the 2017 Summer Slaughter Tour, performing the album in its entirety.

==Musical style and influences==

The Black Dahlia Murder has been described as melodic death metal, or simply death metal. Their 2001 demo &quot;What a Horrible Night to Have a Curse&quot; has been described as metalcore.

Influences for the band include heavy metal bands such as Carcass, At the Gates, Darkane, Dissection, Darkthrone, Morbid Angel, The Haunted, In Flames, Dimension Zero, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Metallica, Pantera and Megadeth.

<text>Nic Endo (born January 7, 1976) is a Japanese-German-American noise musician who plays with the German digital hardcore group Atari Teenage Riot. The daughter of a Japanese mother and a German father, Endo was born in Wichita Falls, Texas.

==Background==
Endo lived in Frankfurt from 1994 to 1996 and later moved to Berlin. Nic Endo joined ATR while they were on tour in 1997 and was involved with the production of their final album &quot;60 Second Wipe Out&quot;.

After ATR effectively broke up in 2000, Endo released an experimental solo album entitled &quot;Cold Metal Perfection&quot; through Fatal Recordings, an explicitly feminist offshoot of Digital Hardcore Recordings. It was named as one of the top 20 albums of 2001 by &quot;Alternative Press&quot;.

In 2001, Endo assisted in the production of Alec Empire&#x27;s solo album, &quot;Intelligence and Sacrifice&quot;. She has also since been a part of Empire&#x27;s touring band, and she was also involved with his follow-up album &quot;Futurist&quot; (2005). In 2010, ATR reformed, and Endo replaced Hanin Elias as the band&#x27;s female vocalist. Her trademark style is her black leather and white face paint overlaid by the characters 抵抗, meaning &quot;resistance&quot;.

== Influences ==
Endo has spoken about her appreciation for Alice Coltrane, James Chance, Miles Davis, Jimi Hendrix, Destroy All Monsters, Freddie Hubbard, Led Zeppelin, Maya Deren, John Coltrane, Brainticket, the Velvet Underground, the Doors, Neu!, and Sun Ra.

<doc id="810077" wikidata="Q2979836" url="?curid=810077" title="X-ray pulsar">
<text>X-ray pulsars or accretion-powered pulsars are a class of astronomical objects that are X-ray sources displaying strict periodic variations in X-ray intensity. The X-ray periods range from as little as a fraction of a second to as much as several minutes.

== Characteristics ==
An X-ray pulsar is a type of binary star system consisting of a typical star (stellar companion) in orbit around a magnetized neutron star. The magnetic field strength at the surface of the neutron star is typically about 108 Tesla, over a trillion times stronger than the strength of the magnetic field measured at the surface of the Earth (60 μT).

Gas is accreted from the stellar companion and is channeled by the neutron star&#x27;s magnetic field on to the magnetic poles producing two or more localized X-ray hot spots, similar to the two auroral zones on Earth, but far hotter. At these hotspots the infalling gas can reach half the speed of light before it impacts the neutron star surface. So much gravitational potential energy is released by the infalling gas, that the hotspots, which are estimated to about one square kilometer in area, can be ten thousand times, or more, as luminous as the Sun.

Temperatures of millions of degrees are produced so the hotspots emit mostly X-rays. As the neutron star rotates, pulses of X-rays are observed as the hotspots move in and out of view if the magnetic axis is tilted with respect to the spin axis.

== Gas supply ==
The gas that supplies the X-ray pulsar can reach the neutron star by a variety of ways that depend on the size and shape of the neutron star&#x27;s orbital path and the nature of the companion star.

Some companion stars of X-ray pulsars are very massive young stars, usually OB supergiants (see stellar classification), that emit a radiation driven stellar wind from their surface. The neutron star is immersed in the wind and continuously captures gas that flows nearby. Vela X-1 is an example of this kind of system.

In other systems, the neutron star orbits so closely to its companion that its strong gravitational force can pull material from the companion&#x27;s atmosphere into an orbit around itself, a mass transfer process known as Roche lobe overflow. The captured material forms a gaseous accretion disc and spirals inwards to ultimately fall onto the neutron star as in the binary system Cen X-3.

For still other types of X-ray pulsars, the companion star is a Be star that rotates very rapidly and apparently sheds a disk of gas around its equator. The orbits of the neutron star with these companions are usually large and very elliptical in shape. When the neutron star passes nearby or through the Be circumstellar disk, it will capture material and temporarily become an X-ray pulsar. The circumstellar disk around the Be star expands and contracts for unknown reasons, so these are transient X-ray pulsars that are observed only intermittently, often with months to years between episodes of observable X-ray pulsation.

== Spin behaviors ==
Radio pulsars (rotation-powered pulsars) and X-ray pulsars exhibit very different spin behaviors and have different mechanisms producing their characteristic pulses although it is accepted that both kinds of pulsar are manifestations of a rotating magnetized neutron star. The rotation cycle of the neutron star in both cases is identified with the pulse period.

The major differences are that radio pulsars have periods on the order of milliseconds to seconds, and all radio pulsars are losing angular momentum and slowing down. In contrast, the X-ray pulsars exhibit a variety of spin behaviors. Some X-ray pulsars are observed to be continuously spinning faster and faster or slower and slower (with occasional reversals in these trends) while others show either little change in pulse period or display erratic spin-down and spin-up behavior.

The explanation of this difference can be found in the physical nature of the two pulsar classes. Over 99% of radio pulsars are single objects that radiate away their rotational energy in the form of relativistic particles and magnetic dipole radiation, lighting up any nearby nebulae that surround them. In contrast, X-ray pulsars are members of binary star systems and accrete matter from either stellar winds or accretion disks. The accreted matter transfers angular momentum to (or from) the neutron star causing the spin rate to increase or decrease at rates that are often hundreds of times faster than the typical spin down rate in radio pulsars. Exactly why the X-ray pulsars show such varied spin behavior is still not clearly understood.

== Observations==
X-ray pulsars are observed using X-ray telescopes that are satellites in low Earth orbit although some observations have been made, mostly in the early years of X-ray astronomy, using detectors carried by balloons or sounding rockets. The first X-ray pulsar to be discovered was Centaurus X-3, in 1971 with the Uhuru X-ray satellite.

== Anomalous X-ray pulsars ==

Magnetars, isolated and highly-magnetised neutron stars, can be observed as relatively slow x-ray pulsars with periods of a few seconds. These are referred to as anomalous X-ray pulsars, but are unrelated to binary X-ray pulsars.

<doc id="810086" wikidata="Q2719873" url="?curid=810086" title="Turgo turbine">
<text>The Turgo turbine is an impulse water turbine designed for medium head applications. Operational Turgo turbines achieve efficiencies of about 87%. In factory and lab tests Turgo turbines perform with efficiencies of up to 90%. It works with net heads between 15 and 300 m.

Designed in 1919 by Gilkes as a modification of the Pelton wheel, the Turgo has some advantages over Francis and Pelton designs for certain applications. 

First, the runner is less expensive to make than a Pelton wheel. Second, it doesn&#x27;t need an airtight housing like the Francis. Third, it has higher specific speed and can handle a greater flow than the same diameter Pelton wheel, leading to reduced generator and installation cost.

Turgos operate in a head range where the Francis and Pelton overlap. While many large Turgo installations exist, they are also popular for small hydro where low cost is very important.

Like all turbines with nozzles, blockage by debris must be prevented for effective operation.

==Theory of operation==

The Turgo turbine is an impulse type turbine; water does not change pressure as it moves through the turbine blades. The water&#x27;s potential energy is converted to kinetic energy with a nozzle. The high speed water jet is then directed on the turbine blades which deflect and reverse the flow. The resulting impulse spins the turbine runner, imparting energy to the turbine shaft. Water exits with very little energy. Turgo runners are extremely efficient 

A Turgo runner looks like a Pelton runner split in half. For the same power, the Turgo runner is one half the diameter of the Pelton runner, and so twice the specific speed. The Turgo can handle a greater water flow than the Pelton because exiting water doesn&#x27;t interfere with adjacent buckets.

The specific speed of Turgo runners is between the Francis and Pelton. Single or multiple nozzles can be used. Increasing the number of jets increases the specific speed of the runner by the square root of the number of jets (four jets yield twice the specific speed of one jet on the same turbine).

<doc id="810090" wikidata="Q1881042" url="?curid=810090" title="Chota Nagpur Plateau">
<text>The Chota Nagpur Plateau is a plateau in eastern India, which covers much of Jharkhand state as well as adjacent parts of Chhattisgarh, Odisha, West Bengal and Bihar. The Indo-Gangetic plain lies to the north and east of the plateau, and the basin of the Mahanadi river lies to the south. The total area of the Chota Nagpur Plateau is approximately .

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Nagpur&quot; is probably taken from Nagavanshis, who ruled in this part of the country. &quot;Chhota&quot; (&quot;small&quot; in Hindi) is the misunderstood name of &quot;Chuita&quot; village in the outskirts of Ranchi, which has the remains of an old fort belonging to the Nagavanshis.
==Geology==

===Formation===

The Chota Nagpur Plateau is a continental plateau—an extensive area of land thrust above the general land.The plateau is composed of Precambrian rocks (i.e., rocks more than about 540 million years old). The plateau has been formed during the Cenozoic by continental uplift due to tectonic forces. The Gondwana substrates attest to the plateau&#x27;s ancient origin. It is part of the Deccan Plate, which broke free from the southern continent during the Cretaceous to embark on a 50-million-year journey that was interrupted by the collision with the Eurasian continent. The northeastern part of the Deccan Plateau, where this ecoregion sits, was the first area of contact with Eurasia. The history of metamorphism, granitic activities and igneous intrusions in the Chotanagpur area continued for a period from over 1000 Ma to 185 Ma.

===Fossil record===

The Chota Nagpur region has a notable fossil presence. The fossil-rich sedimentary units host fossilized remains across a range of biota, such as angiosperm leaves, fruits, flowers, wood, and fish. This stratigraphy has been associated with the Neogene, specifically the Pliocene epoch, despite a lack of conclusive evidence. Earlier studies identified vertebrate fossils in these sediments, with reported fish fossils with affinities to modern families, linking these deposits to recent ichthyofauna adaptations.

==Divisions==
The Chota Nagpur Plateau consists of three steps. The highest step is in the western part of the plateau, where &quot;pats&quot; as a plateau is locally called, are above sea level. The highest point is . The next part contains larger portions of the old Ranchi and Hazaribagh districts and some parts of old Palamu district, before these were broken up into smaller administrative units. The general height is . The topography in undulating with prominent gneissic hills, often dome-like in outline. The lowest step of the plateau is at an average level of around . It covers the old Manbhum and Singhbhum districts. High hills are a striking part of this section – Parasnath Hills rise to a height of and Dalma Hills to . The large plateau is subdivided into several small plateaus or sub-plateaus.

===Pat region===
The western plateau with an average elevation of above mean sea level merges into the plateau of the Surguja district of Chhattisgarh. The flat topped plateau, locally known as &quot;pats&quot; are characterized by level surface and accordance of their summit levels shows they are part of one large plateau. Examples include Netarhat Pat, Jamira Pat, Khamar Pat, Rudni Pat and others. The area is also referred to as Western Ranchi Plateau. It is believed to be composed of Deccan basalt lava.

===Ranchi Plateau===

The Ranchi Plateau is the largest part of the Chota Nagpur Plateau. The elevation of the plateau surface in this part is about and gradually slopes down towards south-east into the hilly and undulating region of Singhbhum (earlier the Singhbhum district or what is now the Kolhan division). The plateau is highly dissected. The Damodar River originates here and flows through a rift valley. To the north it is separated from the Hazaribagh plateau by the Damodar trough. To the west is a group of plateaus called &quot;pat&quot;.

There are many waterfalls at the edges of the Ranchi plateau where rivers coming from over the plateau surface form waterfalls when they descend through the precipitous escarpments of the plateau and enter the area of significantly lower elevation. The North Karo River has formed the high Pheruaghaugh Falls at the southern margin of the Ranchi plateau. Such falls are called scarp falls. Hundru Falls (75 m) on the Subarnarekha River near Ranchi, Dassam Falls (39.62 m) on the Kanchi River, east of Ranchi, Sadni Falls (60 m) on the Sankh River (Ranchi plateau) are examples of scarp falls. Sometimes waterfalls of various dimensions are formed when tributary streams join the master stream from great heights forming hanging valleys. At Rajrappa (10 m), the Bhera River coming over from the Ranchi Plateau hangs above the Damodar River at its point of confluence with the latter. The Jonha Falls (25.9 m) is another example of this category of falls. The Ganga River hangs over its master stream, the Raru River (to the east of Ranchi city) and forms the said falls.

===Hazaribagh Plateau===
The Hazaribagh plateau is often subdivided into two parts – the &quot;higher plateau&quot; and the &quot;lower plateau&quot;. Here the higher plateau is referred to as Hazaribagh plateau and the lower plateau as Koderma plateau. The Hazaribagh plateau on which Hazaribagh town is built is about east by west and north by south with an average elevation of . The north-eastern and southern faces are mostly abrupt; but to the west it narrows and descends slowly in the neighbourhood of Simaria and Jabra where it curves to the south and connects with the Ranchi Plateau through Tori pargana. It is generally separated from the Ranchi plateau by the Damodar trough.

The western portion of Hazaribagh plateau constitutes a broad watershed between the Damodar drainage on the south and the Lilajan and Mohana rivers on the north. The highest hills in this area are called after the villages of Kasiatu, Hesatu and Hudu, and rise fronting the south above the general level of the plateau. Further east along the southern face a long spur projects right up to the Damodar river where it ends in Aswa Pahar, elevation . At the south-eastern corner of the plateau is Jilinga Hill at . Mahabar Jarimo at and Barsot at stand in isolation to the east, and on the north-west edge of the plateau Sendraili at and Mahuda at are the most prominent features. Isolated on the plateau, in the neighbourhood of Hazaribagh town are four hills of which the highest Chendwar rises to . On all sides it has an exceedingly abrupt scarp, modified only on the south-east. In the south it falls almost sheer in a swoop of to the bed of Bokaro River, below Jilinga Hill. Seen from the north the edge of this plateau has the appearance of a range of hills, at the foot of which (on the Koderma plateau) runs the Grand Trunk Road and NH 2 (new NH19).

===Koderma Plateau===
The Koderma plateau is also referred to as the Hazaribagh lower plateau or as the Chauparan-Koderma-Girighi sub-plateau.

The northern face of the Koderma plateau, elevated above the plains of Bihar, has the appearance of a range of hills, but in reality it is the edge of a plateau, from the level of the Gaya plain. Eastward this northern edge forms a well-defined watershed between heads of the tributaries of Gaya and those of the Barakar River, which traverses the Koderma and Giridih districts in an easterly direction. The slope of this plateau to the east is uniform and gentle and is continued past the river, which bears to the south-east, into the Santhal Parganas and gradually disappears in the lower plains of Bengal. The western boundary of the plateau is formed by the deep bed of the Lilajan River.The southern boundary consists of the face of the higher plateau, as far as its eastern extremity, where for some distance a low and undistinguished watershed runs eastward to the western spurs of Parasnath Hills. The drainage to the south of this low line passes by the Jamunia River to the Damodar.

===Damodar trough===
The Damodar basin forms a trough between the Ranchi and Hazaribagh plateaus resulting from enormous fractures at their present edges, which caused the land between to sink to a great depth and incidentally preserved from denudation by the Karanpura, Ramgarh and Bokaro coalfields. The northern boundary of the Damodar valley is steep as far as the southeastern corner of the Hazaribagh plateau. On the south of the trough the Damodar keeps close to the edge of the Ranchi plateau till it has passed Ramgarh, after which a turn to the north-east leaves on the right hand a wide and level valley on which the Subarnarekha begins to intrude, south of Gola till the Singhpur Hills divert it to the south. Further to the east the Damodar River passes tamely into the Manbhum sector of lowest step of the Chota Nagpur plateau.

===Palamu===
The Palamu division generally lies at a lower height than the surrounding areas of Chota Nagpur Plateau. On the east the Ranchi plateau intrudes into the division and the southern part of the division merges with the Pat region. On the west are the Surguja highlands of Chhattishgarh and Sonbhadra district of Uttar Pradesh. The Son River touches the north-western corner of the division and then forms the state boundary for about . The general system of the area is a series of parallel ranges of hills running east and west through which the North Koel River passes. The hills in the south are the highest in the area, and the picturesque and isolated cup-like Chhechhari valley is surrounded by lofty hills on every side. Lodh Falls drops from a height of from these hills, making it the highest waterfall on the Chota Nagpur Plateau. Netarhat and Pakripat plateaus are physiographically part of the Pat region.

===Manbhum-Singhbhum===

In the lowest step of the Chota Nagpur Plateau, the Manbhum area covers the present Purulia district in West Bengal, and Dhanbad district and parts of Bokaro district in Jharkhand, and the Singhbhum area broadly covers Kolhan division of Jharkhand. The Manbhum area has a general elevation of about and it consists of undulating land with scattered hills – Baghmundi and Ajodhya range, Panchakot and the hills around Jhalda are the prominent ones. Adjacent Bankura district of West Bengal has been described as the &quot;connecting link between the plains of Bengal on the east and Chota Nagpur plateau on the west.&quot; The same could be said of the Birbhum district and the Asansol and Durgapur subdivisions of Bardhaman district.

The Singhbhum area contains much more hilly and broken country. The whole of the western part is a mass of hill ranges rising to in the south-west. Jamshedpur sits on an open plateau, above mean sea level, with a higher plateau to the south of it. The eastern part is mostly hilly, though near the borders of West Bengal it flattens out into an alluvial plain. In the Singhbhum area, there are hills alternating with valleys, steep mountains, deep forests on the mountain slopes, and, in the river basins, some stretches of comparatively level or undulating country. The centre of the area consists of an upland plateau enclosed by hill ranges. This strip, extending from the Subarnarekha River on the east to the Angarbira range to the west of Chaibasa, is a very fertile area. Saranda forest is reputed to have the best Sal forests in Asia.

==Climate==
The Chota Nagpur Plateau has an attractive climate. For five to six months of the year, from October onward the days are sunny and bracing. The mean temperature in December is . The nights are cool and temperatures in winter may drop below freezing point in many places. In April and May the day temperature may cross but it is very dry and not sultry as in the adjacent plains. The rainy season (June to September) is pleasant. The Chota Nagpur Plateau receives an annual average rainfall of around , which is less than the rainforested areas of much of India and almost all of it in the monsoon months between June and August.

==Ecology==

The &quot;Chota Nagpur dry deciduous forests&quot;, a tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests ecoregion, encompasses the plateau. The ecoregion has an area of , covering most of the state of Jharkhand and adjacent portions of Odisha, West Bengal, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh.

The ecoregion is drier than surrounding ones, including the Eastern Highlands moist deciduous forests that covers the Eastern Ghats and Satpura Range to the south, and the Lower Gangetic Plains moist deciduous forests in the lowlands to the east and north.

The plateau is covered with a variety of various habitats of which Sal forest is predominant. The plateau is home to the Palamau Tiger Reserve and other large blocks of natural habitat which are among the few remaining refuges left in India for large populations of tiger and Asian elephants.

=== Flora ===
The flora of the Chota Nagpur Plateau ranges from dry to wet forests, with trees reaching heights of up to . Some areas are swampy, while others feature bamboo grasslands and shrubs like &quot;Holarrhena&quot; and &quot;Dodonaea&quot;.
Key species include sal (&quot;Shorea robusta&quot;), which provides valuable timber and supports diverse wildlife, and mahua (&quot;Madhuca longifolia&quot;), known for its fragrant flowers used to make a traditional alcoholic beverage and as a food source for animals. Other significant plants include bamboo (&quot;Bambusa&quot;), teak (&quot;Tectona grandis&quot;),and wild mango (&quot;Mangifera indica&quot;), flame of the forest (&quot;Butea monosperma&quot;).

=== Fauna === 
The region is home to diverse wildlife, including apex predators like the tiger (&quot;Panthera tigris&quot;) and large herbivores such as the Asian elephant (&quot;Elephas maximus&quot;). Ungulates such as the four-horned antelope (&quot;Tetracerus quadricornis&quot;), blackbuck (&quot;Antilope cervicapra&quot;), and chinkara (&quot;Gazella bennettii&quot;) are also common, alongside predators like the dhole (&quot;Cuon alpinus&quot;) and the sloth bear (&quot;Melursus ursinus&quot;). Bird species include the threatened lesser florican (&quot;Sypheotides indicus&quot;), various hornbills including the Indian grey hornbill (&quot;Ocyceros birostris&quot;), and a variety of raptors and migratory birds.

===Conservation===
The Chota Nagpur Plateau was once extensively forested, but today over half of its natural forest cover has been removed, largely for grazing land and increasingly intense mining activities. These disruptions pose significant ecological threats. Mining for minerals like coal, iron ore, and bauxite has led to large-scale deforestation, soil erosion, and habitat fragmentation, which critically affects the survival and movement of native wildlife, particularly larger species such as elephants, tigers, and leopards that require extensive, undisturbed areas.

Some conservation efforts are underway, including the establishment of protected areas and wildlife corridorsaimed at reconnecting fragmented habitats. However, challenges remain due to limited enforcement of conservation policies and the economic dependence of local communities on mining and agriculture, which places continual pressure on the plateau’s ecological resources.

====Protected areas====
About 6 percent of the ecoregion&#x27;s area is within protected areas, comprising in 1997. The largest are Palamau Tiger Reserve and Guru Ghasidas - Tamor Pingla Tiger Reserve.

* Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary, Jharkhand (630 km2)
* Gautam Buddha Wildlife Sanctuary, Bihar (110 km2)
* Hazaribag Wildlife Sanctuary, Jharkhand (450 km2)
* Koderma Wildlife Sanctuary, Jharkhand (180 km2)
* Lawalong Wildlife Sanctuary, Jharkhand (410 km2)
* Palamau Tiger Reserve, Jharkhand (1,330 km2)

* Semarsot Wildlife Sanctuary, Chhattisgarh (470 km2)
* Tamor Pingla Wildlife Sanctuary, Chhattisgarh (600 km2)
* Topchanchi Wildlife Sanctuary, Jharkhand (40 km2)

==Culture==

The Chota Nagpur region is a culturally rich area with a diverse population comprising various indigenous ethinic group of Sadan and tribes. The region is home to tribes like the Santhal, Munda, Oraon, and Ho, alongside non-tribal groups. These groups have distinct traditions, languages, and spiritual practices, often tied closely to nature and ancestral worship. Festivals like Sarhul, Holi and Karam are central to their culture, celebrating harvests and nature with traditional music, dance, and rituals. Craftsmanship is a strong aspect, with communities creating intricate beadwork, pottery, and metalwork. 

Human habitation in the region dates back to the Mesolithic-Chalcolithic period, as evidenced by various ancient cave paintings. Stone tools from the Chota Nagpur Plateau indicate human activity dating back to the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods. Additionally, ancient cave paintings at Isko in Hazaribagh district date to the Meso-Chalcolithic period (9000–5000 BCE). Large-scale extraction industries in coal and iron mining dominate the economy, alongside growing steel production, power generation, and related infrastructure developments. However, agriculture remains important, with rice, maize, and pulses as staple crops.

==Mineral resources==

Chota Nagpur plateau is a store house of mineral resources such as mica, bauxite, copper, limestone, iron ore and coal. The Damodar valley is rich in coal, and it is considered as the prime centre of coking coal in the country. Massive coal deposits are found in the central basin spreading over . The important coalfields in the basin are Jharia, Raniganj, West Bokaro, East Bokaro, Ramgarh, South Karanpura and North Karanpura.

<doc id="810092" wikidata="Q1416981" url="?curid=810092" title="Dark Side of the Moon (2002 film)">
<text>Dark Side of the Moon is a French mockumentary by director William Karel. It originally aired on the Franco-German television network Arte in 2002 with the title Opération Lune.

The mockumentary&#x27;s basic premise is that the television footage from the Apollo 11 Moon landing was faked and recorded in a studio by the CIA with help from director Stanley Kubrick.

== Plot==
The mockumentary begins with the premise that NASA loaned a unique and secret lens to Kubrick for the purpose of creating a faked Moon landing in a studio. In reality, the Carl Zeiss Planar 50mm f/0.7 lens was designed by Zeiss in 1966 on special request for NASA for the Apollo program, and a batch of ten were made. Kubrick bought three left over lenses from this batch for the filming of &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; and had them extensively modified to make them usable on his 35 mm camera.

The first part tells of the inception of the NASA&#x27;s lunar program, emphasizing the issues related to its funding and the necessary public support to the program. NASA regards Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; as the prototype of the show that the space program needs to be in order to gain this support, leading them to design the spacesuits and vessels in a &quot;Hollywood&quot; fashion and even to hire 700 Hollywood technicians, making all of Hollywood stop working on other projects. But the outcome of Apollo 11 is disappointing: although the landing is successful, Neil Armstrong makes a fool of himself and not a single shot of the moonwalk is usable.
The incapability of shooting images on the Moon had been anticipated by Richard Nixon and his staff who decided to fake the pictures on the Moon, using the set of &quot;2001&quot; that was still available in London. Kubrick had refused, then accepted and finally directed the fake footage himself, appalled by the lack of skills of the CIA crew. The KGB soon realized that &quot;the whole thing was a hoax&quot;, that Apollo 11 had indeed landed but it was physically impossible to make pictures in the lunar environment. Besides, they had found a photo showing a portrait of Kubrick lying on the false lunar soil in the studio.
After the success of the fake footage, Nixon gets scared that the truth might be discovered, and in a drunken state asks CIA Colonel George Kaplan to dispose of the whole film crew. The next morning he tries to cancel the order, but it is too late: meanwhile Kaplan has gone mad, sent his killers and disappeared. The death squad goes to Vietnam where the film crew has sought refuge, but is immediately caught by the villagers: despite a perfect accent and disguise, their commanding officer was black. Nixon reacts by sending 150,000 men and a half of the 6th Fleet to find and kill the four members of the crew. They fail, and the CIA takes over and assassinates all but one of them, who takes shelter in a yeshiva in Brooklyn where he dies ten years later. Only Kubrick is spared.
Five years after Apollo 11, Kubrick calls NASA to borrow the top-secret wide-aperture Zeiss lens he needs to make &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;. As a result, Nixon&#x27;s successor decides to get rid of him as the last witness of the conspiracy. Informed of the threat to his life, Kubrick locks himself up in his home and never leaves it until his death.
As a conclusion, General Vernon Walters agrees to reveal the secret of Kubrick&#x27;s demise, but unexpectedly dies the next evening: he had agreed to break the CIA rule of silence and anonymity.
It is finally revealed that this is a mockumentary as the end credits roll over a montage of blooper reels, with the main participants laughing over their lines or over their inability to remember them.

==Production==

===Development===
William Karel had just completed &quot;Hollywood&quot;, a film based on lying, when he and the documentary unit of Arte had the idea of making a mockumentary, to play with the serious tonality of Arte but also for pleasure, and to make a funny film based on the idea that one must not believe everything that one is told, that witnesses can lie, archives can be tricked, and that any subject can be twisted by misleading subtitling or dubbing. They looked for a topic that would be universal and historical but not sensitive like a war. Hence the choice of the Moon landing, which had for more than 30 years been a topic of debate regarding the reality of these images. They found it was a fairly funny topic.

Karel took care to avoid any conspiracist tonality. In particular, at no point is it said that Armstrong did not walk on the Moon. The script just hypothesizes that the US might have wanted a contingency plan in case the first steps could not be filmed. The arguments regarding the impossibility to operate a camera on the Moon were found in websites.
Since it was impossible to know at what point of the film the spectators would start having doubts, parodic bloopers were added in the end credits to make the hoax obvious, in case someone would believe it until the end.

===Elements===
The film uses four main types of elements:

* Karel interviewed Kubrick&#x27;s widow, Christiane Kubrick, and his brother-in-law, Jan Harlan, pretending he was making a documentary on Kubrick, his film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, the Moon or NASA, and asking intentionally vague questions. Karel also interviewed Vernon Walters, Buzz Aldrin, his wife and some NASA personnel, under the same pretext of making a bona fide documentary.
* He used footage of staff of President Richard Nixon, including Donald Rumsfeld, Henry Kissinger, Alexander Haig, Lawrence Eagleburger and CIA director Richard Helms, recycled from his earlier documentary &quot;Les hommes de la Maison Blanche&quot; and edited in order to twist their words.
* Other &quot;witnesses&quot; are played by actors to make the connections between the sentences pronounced by &quot;real witnesses&quot; and make a credible story. Among many giveaways (mainly in the second half) that the entire film is a hoax in jest, these &quot;staging&quot; witnesses are named after characters in Kubrick and Hitchcock films, for instance an astronaut named &quot;David Bowman&quot; (&quot;2001: A Space Odyssey (film)&quot;), a film producer named &quot;Jack Torrance&quot; (&quot;The Shining&quot;) or Nixon&#x27;s secretary called &quot;Eve Kendall&quot; (&quot;North by Northwest&quot;).
* Other elements appearing in the second half are &quot;borrowed&quot; from various documentaries that are mentioned in the end credits. These are the only parts of the film in which deceptive subtitling is used: &quot;Australie, la route de Tanami&quot; (Arnaud Mansir, Hervé Rébillon, 1999), &quot;L&#x27;archipel aux savants&quot; (Laurence Graffin, 1997), &quot;Philippine : la vallée des rizières éternelles&quot; (Patrick Boitet, Jacques Massart, 1994), &quot;Cambodge : Païlin, le refuge des criminels&quot; (Hubert Dubois, 1999), &quot;Chine : union furtive&quot; (Fang Wui Wang, 2000), and &quot;Laos : les montagnards de l&#x27;opium&quot; (Eric Pierrot, 1997).

===Special effects===
The photo showing a portrait of Kubrick on the lunar soil is the only image in which a special effect was used.

== Giveaways ==
In addition to the increasingly incredible claims made as the film progresses, several factual errors of note are introduced by the narrator:
* John F. Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;We choose to go to the Moon&quot; speech was in 1962, not 1961 as was claimed.
* Luna 9 landed on the Moon in February 1966, but the narrator states it was in January.
* The narrator states that Apollo 11 was launched on 17 July 1969, when in fact it was launched the day before on July 16.
* Korolev died following surgery to remove a polyp from his intestines, not from a tonsillectomy as is claimed.
* Lyndon Johnson is said to have been the Governor of Texas – an office he never held.
* Likewise, Richard Nixon is erroneously stated as having once been the Governor of California.
* The narrator implies the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station was selected in part due to the George H. W. Bush family influence in Florida, yet no Bush had any connection with Florida until 1980 when Jeb Bush moved his family there. The Cape, however, had become the new missile test facility by 1950.
* The premiere of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; was in April 1968 and Richard Nixon was inaugurated as president in January 1969, so the latter could not possibly take advantage of the filming of &quot;2001&quot; as the narrator says.
* Farouk El-Baz is presented as NASA technical director, a position he never held.

Most of the fictitious witnesses are named after characters from movies directed by Stanley Kubrick or Alfred Hitchcock. &quot;W.A. Koenigsberg&quot; is named after Woody Allen, who was born &quot;Allan Koenigsberg&quot;. They are listed in the credits along with the names of the actors portraying them.

The film crew member who takes shelter in a yeshiva in Brooklyn is said to be an &quot;acidic&quot; Jew. In the original French version the giveaway is more obvious: it is said that &quot;he didn&#x27;t work anymore, he checked in with the Hasidic&quot;, (&quot;Il ne travaillait plus, il pointait aux Hassidiques&quot;, which does not make sense in French but is an obvious pun between a branch of Judaism and ASSEDIC which was the French employment office at the time the film was made).

The soundtrack also includes the song &quot;The American Dream&quot; from &quot;Wag the Dog&quot; by Barry Levinson, a fiction feature about a secretly government-commissioned Hollywood production of a fake war. At one point, footage featuring the military boarding a plane is underscored by the &quot;right, left, right, left&quot; of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) from Kubrick&#x27;s own film, &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;.

The giveaway also appears in the closing credits with blooper reels showing the characters, real and fictitious alike, laughing over their lines or over their inability to remember them. But there is a final trick here, a &quot;hoax within a hoax&quot;: the real characters are shown joking, giving the false impression that they are voluntarily part of the hoax. In fact at least one of these &quot;jokes&quot; - Kissinger saying that he would do it all over again - appears in &quot;Les hommes de la Maison Blanche&quot; where he turns out to be actually talking quite seriously about the war in Vietnam.

==Cast==

===As themselves===
* Christiane Kubrick is Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s widow.
* Jan Harlan is the executive producer for all Kubrick&#x27;s films from &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; on. He also is Christiane Kubrick&#x27;s brother: they both appear discussing the &quot;plot&quot; of the film on the same couch.
* Henry Kissinger, Donald Rumsfeld, Alexander Haig, and Lawrence Eagleburger were members of Richard Nixon&#x27;s cabinet while the latter was president.
* Edwin &quot;Buzz&quot; Aldrin was the second man to walk on the Moon as Apollo Lunar Module pilot of Apollo 11. The alcoholism and depression problems mentioned in the film are not fictitious: he discussed them in his autobiographic book &quot;Magnificent Desolation: The Long Journey Home from the Moon&quot;.
* Lois Aldrin was Aldrin&#x27;s wife when the film was shot. They divorced in 2012.
* David Scott and Jeffrey A. Hoffman are both retired NASA astronauts. Scott walked on the Moon as commander of Apollo 15.
* Farouk El-Baz is an Egyptian American scientist who worked with NASA on the Apollo programme, on the training of the astronauts in observations and photography, the analysis of data returned from the Moon, and the supervision of the work of geoscientists and engineers in fields related to lunar exploration. Since 1986 he has been a professor and the director of the Center for Remote Sensing at Boston University. He was never technical director of NASA as said in the film.
* Richard Helms was director of the CIA during the Nixon presidency, from June 1966 to February 1973.
* Vernon Walters has a particular importance in the film because of his involvement in the Moon race, and the competition with the Soviet Union. He was interviewed because of his in-depth knowledge of these aspects. He died a week after the first interview he gave to William Karel, preventing a scheduled second interview from taking place. The sentence in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, saying that he appeared in a French television documentary, is a fake: the actual obituary available on the web site of the &quot;New York Times&quot; says:

&quot;He was great as our James Bond, getting us in and out secretly, even giving us code names,&quot; said Winston Lord, former president of the Council on Foreign Relations, who accompanied Mr. Kissinger to the secret talks with the Vietnamese.

Whereas the paper shown in the film says:

General Walters&#x27; last known public appearance was on a French Television documentary in which he talked about the White House&#x27;s with the Apollo program in the late 1960s. Both the producer and director noted that Walters was in perfect shape.

===Fictional characters===

The names of the fictitious witnesses and of the actors impersonating them appear in the end credits. Moreover, Arte (co-producer and original broadcaster of the film) accompanied the airing in France by a web site featuring a quiz in which the player was led to guess in which films the characters having those names originally appeared. The following list reproduces the correct answers of the quiz.

* Jack Torrance is a fictional character in Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;The Shining&quot;, not a Hollywood producer, and is played by David Winger.
* David Bowman is a fictional character in Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey (film)&quot;, not a real astronaut, and is played by Tad Brown.
* Maria Vargas (lead character in &quot;The Barefoot Contessa&quot;) is played by Jacquelyn Toman and is not Buzz Aldrin&#x27;s sister.
* Eve Kendall is a fictional character in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;North by Northwest&quot; and was not Nixon&#x27;s secretary (whose name was Rose Mary Woods), and is played by Barbara Rogers.
* Dimitri Muffley is a play on the names from Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; (Soviet Premier Dimitri Kisov and American President Merkin Muffley) and is not a &quot;former KGB agent.&quot; He is played by Bernard Kirschoff.
* Ambrose Chapel is the name of a place in Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot;, not an &quot;ex-CIA agent&quot;, and is played by John Rogers.
* George Kaplan (mentioned by narrator) is a fictional character within a fictional character in the Hitchcock film, &quot;North By Northwest&quot;.
* W. A. Koenigsberg (&quot;W. A.&quot; stands for &quot;Woody Allen&quot;, as Koenigsberg is Woody Allen&#x27;s true name) is played by Binem Oreg.

==Reception==
Arte aired the film for the first time on 16 October 2002, and a second time on 1 April 2004, followed by a debate and accompanied by a web site including an interview of William Karel and a quiz demonstrating some of the giveaways including the fake witnesses and out-of-context quotes from interviews. At the press screening before the first airing, some people who had missed the beginning left the screening room infuriated.

The producer proposed the film to the BBC, who liked it but rejected it because they perceived it as being part of an &quot;anti-American campaign&quot; in French documentaries.

===Moon landing conspiracy theories===
When the film was shown to a group of sociology students studying conspiracy theories, many mistakenly believed that this was a sincere and serious film. Furthermore, Moon-landing hoax advocate Wayne Green cited the film as evidence for his views, apparently believing the out of context footage of Nixon staff was really about a Moon landing hoax, as discussed on Jay Windley&#x27;s &quot;clavius.org&quot; site defending the reality of the Moon landings. Extracts ranging from a few minutes to the whole film stripped of the credits and key sequences have been posted on YouTube by conspiracy theorists as &quot;proof&quot; that, either the images on the Moon are fake, or the Moon landing itself never happened. Karel himself received e-mails congratulating him for &quot;exposing the Moon landing hoax&quot;, which amused him.

==Awards==
* Adolf-Grimme-Preis (Germany / 2002) for best script &amp; director 

==Influences==
William Karel indicated that he found inspiration in Orson Welles&#x27; radio broadcast &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, &quot;Capricorn One&quot;, and the docudramas by Peter Watkins. He refers to &quot;Dark side of the Moon&quot; as a &quot;documenteur&quot;, a French portmanteau word meaning &quot;liar documentary&quot; (from &quot;documentaire&quot; &quot;documentary&quot; + &quot;menteur&quot; &quot;liar&quot;), after the title of a film made by Agnès Varda in 1980–1981.

Other influences are the staging of well-known historical events for the camera, such as the raising of the flags at Iwo-Jima and at the Reichstag, the American landing in Somalia which was remade a couple of times for the cameras, exemplifying the influence of cinema on news coverage.

<text>Crioceris, or asparagus beetle, is a genus of the family Chrysomelidae of beetles. The name is Neo-Latin from Greek , ram and , horn.
 Not all species in the genus &quot;Crioceris&quot; feed on asparagus (e.g., &quot;C. nigropicta&quot;). Some studies have found low genetic diversity among groups of isolated Chrysomelidae, and use &quot;Wolbachia&quot; species as a genetic marker.

<doc id="810097" wikidata="Q7760830" url="?curid=810097" title="The Rip">
<text>The Rip, also known as The Heads, is the narrow waterway entrance connecting the Bass Strait to the bay of Port Phillip in southern Victoria, Australia, and is the only route of maritime transport into Port Phillip and thus seaport access into Melbourne and Geelong, Victoria&#x27;s two largest cities. Because of large tidal flows through the relatively narrow channel from the bay to the ocean, and a high rocky seabed, The Rip is a dangerous stretch of water and has claimed numerous ships and many lives. Geographically, it is the roughly triangular area of water between the land points of Point Nepean on the Mornington Peninsula, Shortlands Bluff and Point Lonsdale on the Bellarine Peninsula, with these three forming &quot;The Heads&quot;.

==Geography==
The Rip is generally considered to be located in the triangular area of water between the land points of Point Nepean, Shortlands Bluff and Point Lonsdale. The entrance between Point Lonsdale and Point Nepean is 3.5 km wide but the reefs projecting from these points reduce the navigable width to about 1 km. Within 800 m outside the Heads, there is a shallow rocky flat known as the Rip Bank. The water deepens outside this flat to 30m and inside the Heads to as much as 90 m. This inequality of depth combined with tidal streams running up to 6 knots, causes the world-renowned dangerous conditions. The variation in seafloor depth within the rip itself can be anywhere from 100 m to less than 5 m amongst the rocky reefs and shoals.

==Navigation==
The area of The Rip is a navigation hazard for recreational and small commercial vessels, due to strong tidal movements, unpredictable waves and proximity to active shipping lanes. Vessels are also prohibited from landing at Point Nepean on the southern central border of The Rip.

Control of shipping movements through the heads is managed by the Point Lonsdale Signal Station. Large ships may only enter Port Phillip with a qualified pilot aboard to help them navigate through the heads.
The heads are very narrow, having a width of about . When entering, large ships must follow a precise S-shaped course through the heads. The Queenscliff Low Light (&quot;white lighthouse&quot;) and Queenscliff High Light (&quot;black lighthouse&quot;) form a leading line to guide ships through the main channel, in conjunction with the Hume and Murray Towers that show red and green lights respectively.
Numerous vessels have been wrecked after getting into difficulties in the strong current in The Rip. They include the sailing ship &quot;Sacramento&quot; in 1853, cutter &quot;Corsair&quot; in 1874, steamship &quot;Formosa&quot; in 1875, barque &quot;Eliza Ramsden&quot; in 1875, steamship in 1887, and cutter &quot;Thistle&quot; in 1945. &quot;Corsair&quot; gave her name to Corsair Rock, on which she ran aground. In 1955, the cargo ship struck Corsair Rock, freed herself, and then ran aground half-sunk in Port Phillip as a result of the damage.

==Vehicular crossings==
There are no bridges or tunnels that allow for vehicular traffic to cross the bay. Searoad Ferries operates a vehicular ferry service across the mouth of the bay between Queenscliff and Sorrento using two roll-on roll-off vessels.

Various bridge and tunnel projects have been proposed to link the heads of Port Phillip Bay, but none, so far, have got beyond the proposal stage. In an opinion piece published in the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; in 2018, Peter Mitchell asserted that no project would be approved in the near future because homes would have to be compulsorily acquired on both sides of the crossing, and no politician would be &quot;prepared to bite that bullet.&quot;

In March 2023, the Mayor of Mornington Peninsula Steve Holland supported an idea for the bridge.

==Swim crossing==
Douglas Mew was the first person to swim across the Rip, on 13 June 1971. He completed the swim without a cage, in a time of 61 minutes. This achievement is commemorated by a plaque on the Point Lonsdale side of the Rip.
The date of the first double crossing of the Rip is not recorded. A group of swimmers from the Brighton Icebergers did this double crossing.
The first triple Rip crossing occurred on 11 February 2017. Grant Cameron, Fran Johnson and Esther McDonald took 5 hours and 45 minutes (moving time) to complete the crossing. Flows at the heads (tides) had a significant effect on the swim that commenced at Point Lonsdale and ended on Point Nepean.

Swimming across the Rip has often been frowned upon by authorities and considered reckless, but the body of water can now be swum safely under the guidance of The Rip Swim organisation. This project began in 2014 and after 6 years, has taken 472 swimmers across safely. The total number of swimmers officially recorded now stands at 518 as there were several groups of swimmers (predominantly from the Brighton Icebergers) who made the crossing around the late 1990s and after the year 2000.

There have been two races across the Rip, organised by The Rip Swim organisation. The first one was in 2015 and Sam Sheppard and Naantali Marshall were the winners. The next race, which took place in 2018, was the single biggest crossing of the Rip so far. On that day, 142 swimmers crossed in what was a combination of racing and group swimming. The Rip Swim organisation now focuses their efforts on taking small groups across, each accompanied by a kayaker and boats to ensure their safety.

<text>Painkiller () is China&#x27;s first heavy music magazine. It is a legally registered enterprise for print media productions by Chinese State Authority.

Based in Beijing, it was founded in September 2000 and started off publishing quarterly; the frequency in 2006, is one issue every two months.

Their current average circulation is 40,000 copies; sold in all major cities of mainland China (Beijing, Chengdu, Xi&#x27;an, etc.), as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan.

The magazine&#x27;s language is Chinese, and has correspondents, foreign editors and contributors in the USA, UK, and Germany for interviews, foreign news, and features. The magazine has a front cover with the title in Chinese and a back cover with the title in English; normal publication is 204 pages in full color with a fold out color poster.

Every issue also has a cover CD and a &#x27;Metal In China&#x27; section which promotes and introduces bands on the local Chinese heavy metal scene in which several city scenes are presented and Chinese heavy metal is explained including its function as a &#x27;rebellion of denial&#x27; due to the new sound movement.

The content focuses on articles and interviews, photographs of live concerts from around the world and in China, CD reviews, and posters – mainly with foreign metal bands from the genres: heavy metal, power metal, progressive metal, nu metal, hard rock, metalcore, darkwave/gothic/industrial, hard core, thrash metal, death metal, black metal, grindcore, etc.

Further activities include the support of the local metal underground, the organization of concerts, CD distribution throughout China, and certain internet activities. &quot;Painkiller&quot; co-promoted the German band, Edguy, for a concert in Beijing in March 2006 which marked the begin of &quot;Painkiller&quot; as promoter and live show producer in China.

<text>This is a list of important publications in chemistry, organized by field.

Some factors that correlate with publication notability include:
*Topic creator – A publication that created a new topic.
*Breakthrough – A publication that changed scientific knowledge significantly.
*Influence – A publication that has significantly influenced the world or has had a massive impact on the teaching of chemistry.


==Foundations==

===The Sceptical Chymist===
* The Sceptical Chymist - Robert Boyle 1661

Description: Boyle, in the form of a dialogue, argued that chemical theories should be firmly grounded in experiment before their acceptance, and for the foundation of chemistry as a science separate from medicine and alchemy.

Importance: Topic Creator, Influence. Boyle, in this book, became the first to argue that experiment should form the basis of all theory, a common practice in chemistry today. He also expounded on a rudimentary atomic theory and the existence of chemical elements beyond the classic earth, fire, air, and water. He is seen as the father of chemistry, and this is his most celebrated book, with continued relevance to the present day.

===Traité Élémentaire de Chimie===
* Traité Élémentaire de Chimie (Elementary Treatise of Chemistry) - Antoine Lavoisier
* &quot;Traité Élémentaire de Chimie&quot;, 1789, available in English as &quot;Elementary Treatise of Chemistry&quot;

Description: This book was intended as an introduction to new theories in chemistry and as such, was one of the first Chemistry textbooks.

Importance: Introduction, Influence. Aside from being one of the first chemistry textbooks, the book was one of the first to state the Law of conservation of mass, define a chemical element, and contain a list of known elements.

=== &quot;Méthode de Nomenclature Chimique&quot; ===
* Guyton de Morveau, L. B.; Lavoisier, A. L.; Berthollet, C. L.; de Fourcroy, A. F.
* &quot;Méthode de Nomenclature Chimique&quot;, Paris, 1787, available in English as &quot;Chymical Nomenclature&quot;.
* Some details and a picture available at IUPAC nomenclature#History

Description: This publication laid out a logical system for naming chemical substances (mainly chemical elements and inorganic compounds).

Importance: Prior to this publication, a multitude of names were often used for the same substance. This publication led to an international consensus on how to name chemical substances.

===&quot;A New System of Chemical Philosophy&quot;===
* &quot;A New System of Chemical Philosophy&quot; - John Dalton, 1808–1827

Description: This book explained Dalton&#x27;s theory of atoms and its applications to chemistry.

Importance: The book was one of the first to describe a modern atomic theory, a theory that lies at the basis of modern chemistry. It is the first to introduce a table of atomic and molecular weights. Surprisingly, given the period in which the book was written, of the five properties of atoms that Dalton listed, only two have been shown to be incorrect.

===&quot;The Dependence Between the Properties of the Atomic Weights of the Elements&quot;===
*&quot;The Dependence Between the Properties of the Atomic Weights of the Elements&quot; - Dmitri Mendeleev
* Zeitschrift für Chemie 12, 405–406 (1869)

* Nature 171, 737–738 (1953) © Macmillan Publishers Ltd.
* Downloadable PDF

Description: In this paper the structure of DNA was proposed. It consisted of a double helix with a phosphate backbone, unlike Linus Pauling and R.B. Corey&#x27;s double helix where the backbone consisted of the bases. They conclude with the sly remark: &quot;It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material.&quot;

Importance: Topic creator, Breakthrough, Influence

===&quot;The Structure of the Potassium Channel: Molecular Basis of K+ Conduction and Selectivity&quot;===
* Declan A. Doyle, João Morais Cabral, Richard A. Pfuetzner, Anling Kuo, Jacqueline M. Gulbis, Steven L. Cohen, Brian T. Chait and Roderick MacKinnon 
* Science 280(5360), 69–77 (1998) © American Association for the Advancement of Science
* Online version

Description: The structure of the potassium channel is determined by X-ray crystallography. Access to the structure provided answers to central questions in biology, regarding the movement of ions across the cell membrane. In particular, the structure revealed the mechanism with by which these channels move potassium ions both quickly and selectively, reliably preventing similarly sized sodium ions from passing through.

Importance Breakthrough, Influence

==Analytical chemistry==

===Statistics for Experimenters: An Introduction to Design, Data Analysis, and Model Building===
* George E.P. Box, J. Stuart Hunter &amp; William G. Hunter
* John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1st Edition 1978, 2nd Edition 2005 ()
Description: Starting with examples comparing two sets of experimental data, this text explains variance and the calculation of standard deviations, degrees of freedom, the null hypothesis and the &quot;Student&#x27;s&quot; t-Test by William J. Gosset. Further chapters discuss the importance of randomization and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) using F distributions before delving into the use of statistically designed experiments including block and factorial designs. The book finishes with least squares regression analysis along with response surface and mechanistic modeling.

Importance: Although almost devoid of classical chemistry, this is the definitive text for any experimentalist. This is particularly true for any chemist measuring or studying the properties or effects of chemical compounds, mixtures or other substances.

Though chemical examples were few, it should be mentioned that co-author William G. Hunter, George Box&#x27;s protégé, had a Bachelor&#x27;s and a master&#x27;s degree in Chemical Engineering with the book written in such a manner that its concepts would easily apply to chemical investigations.

==Polymer chemistry==

===Principles of Polymer Chemistry===
* Flory, Paul J. (1953)
* Cornell University Press. 1953, .
Description: Discusses structure and stereochemistry of synthetic polymers, polymerization kinetics, behaviour of polymers in solution, chain dimensions.

Importance: First major text on polymer chemistry; presents both organic and physical chemistry aspects. Written by a chemist who made major contributions to the physical chemistry of polymers, for which he won the Nobel prize in 1974.

==Environmental chemistry==

===Aquatic Chemistry, Chemical Equilibria and Rates in Natural Waters===
* Stumm, Werner and James J. Morgan.
* John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1st Edition 1970, 3rd Edition 1996, .

Description. This book covers the full spectrum of the discipline including acid/base equilibria, carbonate chemistry, mass transfer, complexation, sorption phenomenon, oxidation/reduction, colloid chemistry, and flocculation/coagulation. The authors generally present the material using a ground up approach that emphasizes fundamental principles of thermodynamics and kinetics.

Importance. The publication is one of the most widely cited texts in environmental chemistry. In 1999, Stumm and Morgan received the Stockholm Water Prize for their contributions in the field. The citation specifically mentioned Aquatic Chemistry where it was described as a &quot;seminal book&quot; that is &quot;used in education all over the world&quot;.

===Stratospheric sink for chlorofluoromethanes: chlorine atom-catalysed destruction of ozone===
Mario J. Molina and F. S. Rowland, Nature 249, 810–812 (1974)

Description: This paper warned of the danger of ozone depletion due to man-made chlorofluorocarbons. The main atmospheric sink for these compounds was identified as ultraviolet photolysis, liberating chlorine atoms which catalyze the destruction of stratospheric ozone and have the potential to significantly deplete the ozone layer.

Importance: Influence, as described in the presentation speech for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1995: “The findings presented by this year&#x27;s laureates in chemistry have had an enormous political and industrial impact. This was because they clearly identified unacceptable environmental hazards in a large, economically important sector.” 

==Chemical thermodynamics==

===On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances===
*Gibbs, Willard
*Trans. Conn. Acad., Vol. III, pp. 108–248, 1876; pp. 343–524, 1878.

Description: Paper applied the thermodynamic theory of steam engines to atomic level chemical reactions; i.e., it established equilibrium criteria necessary to predict the thermodynamic tendency of chemical reactions at constant temperature and pressure.

Importance: Topic creator; historian Bill Bryson states, in his &quot;A Short History of Nearly Everything&quot;, that Gibbs’ &quot;Equilibrium&quot; paper is &quot;the &quot;Principia&quot; of thermodynamics&quot;. In addition, this paper, in many ways, functions as the mathematical foundation of physical chemistry.

==Electrochemistry==

===&quot;Electrochemical Methods: Fundamentals and Applications&quot;===

<text>Bruce Russell (born 1960) is a New Zealand experimental musician and writer.

He is a founding member and guitarist of the noise rock trio The Dead C and the free noise combo A Handful of Dust (with Alastair Galbraith). He has released solo albums featuring guitar and tape manipulation, and has contributed articles to British music magazine &quot;The Wire&quot;.

He established the Xpressway record label, which was active from 1985 until the early 1990s, releasing mostly cassettes and a few records. Russell then founded the Corpus Hermeticum record label. Xpressway released only music by New Zealanders, usually song-based. Corpus Hermeticum releases, in contrast, may feature New Zealand or international artists, and they eschew song forms in favour of free-form, experimental, usually improvised sounds.

In summer of 2013, Bruce Russell&#x27;s daughter Olive Russell uploaded a documentary of her father that she shot and edited herself called &quot;27 Minutes with Mr. Noisy: A Documentary about Bruce Russell&quot; to Vimeo.com.

==Trivia==
During his time at the University of Otago, Bruce Russell was a member of that university&#x27;s champion team in the television quiz &quot;University Challenge&quot;.

During the South African Springbok rugby team&#x27;s controversial 1981 tour of New Zealand, Russell received two police convictions as a student leader of protests against the tour.

For a period Russell worked as an archivist in Radio New Zealand&#x27;s Sound Archives.

Russell climbed Mount Fuji for a retired librarians charity in 1994.

<text>Sir Russell Coutts (born 1 March 1962) is a world champion New Zealand yachtsman. He won an Olympic gold medal and skippered three Americas Cup victories in 1995, 2000, and 2003.

== Early life ==
Coutts was educated at Otago Boys&#x27; High School (1975–1979) and is a Life Member of Paremata Boating Club, where he learned to sail in a P class, and the Ravensbourne Boating Club. At the age of 17, he became national champion of New Zealand in the Laser class.

== Career ==
Coutts&#x27; achievements include a gold medal in the Finn class in the 1984 Olympic Games, winning the America&#x27;s Cup five times, the ISAF World Youth championships, three World Match Racing Championships, numerous international match race wins and IOR, IMS and One Design World Championship victories. As skipper/helmsman in America&#x27;s Cup racing, he has a perfect record with 15 wins and no losses (1995, 2000, 2003). He was CEO of the Oracle Team when it won the America&#x27;s Cup twice with 14 wins and 16 losses (2010, 2013 and 2017 each time with James Spithill as skipper/helmsman).

===RC44 series===
In 2005 Slovenian designer Andrej Justin designed with input from him a new boat called the RC44, a high-performance one-design racer created for top-level racing in international regattas under strictly controlled Class Rules. The concept and the design features of the RC44 are dedicated to the amateur helmsmen racing in fleet racing sailing events.

===SailGP series===
Coutts along with American billionaire businessman Larry Ellison co-founded the SailGP professional series in October 2019.

In mid-March 2024, Coutts announced that SailGP would not return to Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2025 after the presence of endangered Hector&#x27;s dolphins on the Lyttelton course led local authorities to cancel racing on 23 March. SailGP organisers had been expecting 22,000 people to attend the event. Coutts criticised &quot;minority interests&quot; particularly the Lyttelton harbourmaster, Department of Conservation, ECan (Environment Canterbury and local Māori iwi (tribe) Ngāti Wheke for what he called &quot;extremely restrictive&quot; protocols on racing. In response to Coutt&#x27;s remarks, Te Hapū o Ngāti Wheke and the host city agency ChristchurchNZ defended their marine mammal management plan, with the former saying that SailGP had &quot;knew what they signed up for when they decided to hold the event within a marine mammal sanctuary.&quot; University of Otago zoologist Professor emeritus Liz Slooten said it was normal for Hector&#x27;s dolphins to swim in harbours in autumn and criticised the organisers for not hosting the race in winter. Similar sentiments were echoed by Auckland City Councillor Josephine Bartley and Greenpeace Aotearoa New Zealand Executive Director Russell Norman. By contrast, Coutts was defended by former National Party leader and Auckland Business Chamber CEO Simon Bridges who said that interest groups were opposing major events such as the SailGP race across the country. &quot;The Platform&quot; broadcaster Sean Plunket also made controversial remarks describing Hector&#x27;s dolphins as the &quot;Down syndrome kids of marine mammals.&quot;

In early May 2024, Newsroom reported that Coutts&#x27; SailGP was negotiating with the economic development agency ChristchurchNZ over future SailGP events being hosted by Lyttelton. The website also reported that an evening call with Coutts had led to an urgent board meeting at ChristchurchNZ.

===America&#x27;s Cup===
*1995 – 1995 Louis Vuitton Cup / Black Magic / San Diego / Winner (37 victories, 1 loss) – Skipper &amp; Helmsman – 1995 America&#x27;s Cup / Black Magic (Challenger) / San Diego / Winner (5 to 0) – Skipper &amp; Helmsman

*2013 2013 America&#x27;s Cup / Oracle Racing (Defender) / San Francisco, USA / Winner (9 to 8) – Team Chief Executive Officer

In July 2007, Coutts was named CEO and skipper of BMW Oracle Racing, sponsored by Golden Gate Yacht Club (GGYC), the United States Challenger to the 2010 America&#x27;s Cup. He was involved in the pre-match litigation between the challengers Golden Gate Yacht Club and Société Nautique de Genève (SNG), in which the court decided that the GGYC was the rightful Challenger of Record. Cup Defender SNG&#x27;s team was Alinghi. Coutts&#x27; yacht USA beat the defending yacht Alinghi 5 by considerable margins in both races.

Most observers stated that USA 17&#x27;s rigid wing sail had given it a decisive advantage.

Coutts again led the Oracle Team as CEO in the next America&#x27;s Cup match against Emirates Team New Zealand. This match took place in the bay of San Francisco in September 2013. Oracle managed to come back from 8 races to 1 by winning the following 8 races and to defend the cup in the longest America&#x27;s cup match ever. Both skipper James Spithill and team owner Larry Ellison praised Coutts&#x27; role in the defense of the oldest trophy in sports history.

===World Championships===
===Olympic Games===
He competed twice at the Olympics:
*In the 1984 Olympic Games held in Los Angeles, USA he sailed the Finn class winning a Gold Medal

== Personal life ==
Coutts has been married twice and has four children. His son, Grayson, was previously in a relationship with journalist David Farrier.

In 2021, Coutts criticised the New Zealand government&#x27;s response to COVID-19 and suggested that the government was acting like a dictatorship by establishing vaccine mandates and enforcing managed isolation. In 2022, he announced that he would be attending the anti-mandate protest in Wellington.

==Awards==
In New Zealand, Coutts was honoured with appointment as a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1985 New Year Honours and then elevation to the rank of Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1995 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, in both instances for services to yachting. He was made a Distinguished Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit (DCNZM) in the 2000 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours &quot;for services to yachting, especially the 2000 America&#x27;s Cup challenge&quot;, and redesignated as a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit (KNZM) in August 2009.

<doc id="810119" wikidata="Q7558969" url="?curid=810119" title="Solutia">
<text>Solutia Inc. was an American manufacturer of materials and specialty chemicals including polyvinyl butyral (PVB), ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) interlayers for laminated glass, aftermarket window films, protective barrier and conductive films, and rubber processing chemicals. The company was formed on September 1, 1997, as a divestiture of the Monsanto Company chemical business. In July 2012, the company was acquired by Eastman Chemical Company.

Solutia&#x27;s worldwide headquarters were located in Town and Country, Missouri, United States, with regional headquarters located in Zaventem, Belgium; São Paulo, Brazil; and Shanghai, China.

Solutia was known as the world&#x27;s leading manufacturer of PVB, EVA, and TPU interlayers, custom-coated window and performance films, and chemicals for the rubber industry. In 2009, the company completed the sale of its nylon division, with closure of the sale in the second quarter 2009. In 2010, the company purchased Etimex-Solar and Novomatrix, further enhancing its portfolio of interlayer and film products.

==History==
The company was formed on September 1, 1997, as a divestiture of the Monsanto Company chemical business. Solutia filed for bankruptcy on December 17, 2003, in response to significant litigation surrounding various products, unsustainable debt structure, and a downturn in the economy. Solutia emerged from bankruptcy on February 28, 2008.

Solutia employed approximately 3,400 people in more than 50 locations worldwide, and reported $1.67 billion in annual revenues for 2009, and $984 million in revenues through June 30, 2010, for its continued operations (nylon revenue not included in figures; new acquisitions included in figures for 2010 only).

Solutia was bought by Eastman Chemical Company in 2012 for $4.8 billion.

==Businesses and products==
As of April 26, 2010, Solutia reported its businesses in three segments: Advanced Interlayers, Performance Films, and Technical Specialties. The products within these segments are as follows:

== Environmental and health record ==
Solutia and its parent company Monsanto agreed in 2003 to pay $700 million to settle claims by 20,000 Anniston, Alabama residents over PCB contamination. Monsanto documents indicate that the company routinely dumped PCBs in the land and water supply of Anniston and covered up its behavior for more than 40 years. In 2008, PCBs were found outside Anniston High School.

Solutia&#x27;s Springfield, Massachusetts plant ranks as #4 on the EPA&#x27;s top five facilities that reported the largest quantity of on- and off-site environmental releases in Massachusetts under the Toxics Release Inventory for 2007.

Solutia&#x27;s Delaware River Plant is responsible for contaminating the soil and the groundwater with three old hazardous-waste disposal areas, a phenol equalization lagoon, two sludge lagoons, a raw-waste lagoon, a process sewer system, a storm-water drainage ditch, and a closed Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulated hazardous waste landfill.

The Solutia AES Property Site near the Kanawha River in Nitro, West Virginia, was found by the EPA to have 18 buried, deteriorating drums containing dioxin. EPA determined that a threat to public health or welfare or the environment existed due to the release or threat of release of dioxin at the site.

The Solutia facility in Sauget, Illinois is responsible for emitting PCBs, benzene, chlorobenzene, lead, and mercury. Solutia completed an interim remedy in 2004 to contain, intercept, and collect contaminated groundwater discharging and causing environmental impacts to the Mississippi River.

In 2006, the EPA filed suit against Solutia, Shell Oil, and Mallinckrodt over hazardous materials found at the Great Lakes Container Corp. in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1995, a fire alerted officials to the potential dangers of the site, and environmental investigations turned up buried drums of hazardous materials, asbestos and high levels of lead and polychlorinated biphenyls. According to the consent decree, 61,650 tons of soil contaminated with PCBs and lead was removed from the site as were more than 800 buried drums.

Solutia&#x27;s Chocolate Bayou Alvin facility ranked #1 in the EPA&#x27;s top ten facilities in Texas for total on-site and off-site releases of all chemicals in 2009.

In May 2009, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality approved a penalty of $117,048 assessed against Solutia for 14 air violations that occurred over a year and a half period.

<doc id="810120" wikidata="Q752374" url="?curid=810120" title="Ring galaxy">
<text>A ring galaxy is a galaxy with a circle-like appearance. Hoag&#x27;s Object, discovered by Arthur Hoag in 1950, is an example of a ring galaxy. The ring contains many massive, relatively young blue stars, which are extremely bright. The central region contains relatively little luminous matter. Some astronomers believe that ring galaxies are formed when a smaller galaxy passes through the center of a larger galaxy. Because most of a galaxy consists of empty space, this &quot;collision&quot; rarely results in any actual collisions between stars. However, the gravitational disruptions caused by such an event could cause a wave of star formation to move through the larger galaxy. Other astronomers think that rings are formed around some galaxies when external accretion takes place. Star formation would then take place in the accreted material because of the shocks and compressions of the accreted material.

==Formation theories==
All of the processes that form ring galaxies appear to cause significant effects on stellar populations. Based on observations of the spectrum of the ring structures, there appears to be very high star formation rates caused by the outwards pressure wave. The regions also have very high metallicities, supporting the idea of a significant amount of evolution of the stellar population within the ring. The methods ring galaxies are theorized to be formed through include, but are not limited to, the scenarios listed below: 

===Bar instability===

A phenomenon where the rotational velocity of the bar in a barred spiral galaxy increases to the point of spiral spin-out. Under typical conditions, gravitational density waves would favor the creation of spiral arms. When the bar is unstable, these density waves are instead migrated out into a ring-structure by the pressure, force, and gravitational influence of the baryonic and dark matter furiously orbiting about the bar. This migration forces the stars, gas and dust found within the former arms into a torus-like region, forming a ring, and often igniting star formation.

Galaxies with this structure have been found where the bar dominates, and essentially &quot;carves out&quot; the ring of the disc as it rotates. Oppositely, ring galaxies have been found where the bar has collapsed or disintegrated into a highly-flattened bulge. 

Other instabilities have been predicted due to asymmetries caused by spiral arms, which creates a net torque depending on the pattern of the bar. This torque creates a resonance instability that drives matter from the arms both outwards and inwards towards the core, creating the distinct ring and core structure. 

Despite this, observations suggest that bars, rings and spiral arms have the ability to fall apart and reform over the span of hundreds of millions of years, particularly in dense intergalactic environments, such as galaxy groups and clusters, where gravitational influences are more likely to play a role in the morphological and physical evolution of a galaxy without the influence of collisions and mergers.

===Galactic collisions===

Another observed way that ring galaxies can form is through the process of two or more galaxies colliding. The Cartwheel Galaxy, galaxy pair AM 2026-424, and Arp 147 are all examples of ring galaxies thought to be formed by this process. 

In pass-through galactic collisions, or bullseye collisions, an often smaller donor galaxy will pass directly through the disc of an often larger spiral, causing an outward push of the arms from the gravity of the smaller galaxy, as if dropping a rock into a pond of still water. These collisions can either launch the bulge and core away from the main disk, creating an almost empty ring appearance as the shockwave pushes the spiral arms out, or shove the core out towards the disk, often creating an oval-shaped ring with the bulge still somewhat intact. In side-swipe and head-on collisions, the appearance of a perfect ring are less likely, with chaotic and warped appearances dominating. In these collisional galaxy systems, the individual galaxies that made up the ring system are often still observable. 

Rings formed through collision processes are believed to be transient features of the affected galaxies, lasting only a few ten to hundred million years (a relatively short timeframe considering some mergers can take over a billion years to complete) before disintegrating, reforming into spiral arms, or succumbing to further disturbance from gravitational influence. 

===Ring Accretion===

==== Intergalactic Medium Accretion ====
This method has been inferred through the existence of Hoag&#x27;s object, along with UV observations of several other large and ultra-large super spiral galaxies and current formation theories of spiral galaxies. 

UV-light observations show several cases of faint, ring-like and spiral structures of hot young stars that have formed along the network of cooled inflowing gas, extending far from the visible luminous galactic disc. If conditions are favorable, a ring can form in the place of a spiral structure. Polar-ring galaxies may form through cold accretion, as gas from the galaxy filament flows into the disk and halo regions of a galaxy early in evolution. Resulting star formation interferes with the formation of spiral structures in the stellar disk, and a stable ring structure is created. Similarly, pre-existing elliptical galaxies may also experience cold accretion and result in polar-ring galaxies. 

Since some spiral galaxies are theorized to have formed from massive clouds of intergalactic gas collapsing and then rotationally forming into a disc structure, one could assume that a ring disc could form in place of a spiral disc if, as mentioned before, conditions are favorable. This holds true for protogalaxies, or galaxies just throughout to be forming, and old galaxies that have migrated into a section of space with a higher gas content than its previous locations.

==== Tidal Accretion ====
Besides intergalactic medium accretion, tidal interactions between a gas-rich host galaxy and a donor galaxy in a polar orbit may lead to the formation of polar-ring galaxies. Observations indicate that rings formed through accretion have a greater inclination angle, compared to rings formed through merging galaxies, as some angular momentum from the gas of the donor galaxy is lost through dispersion; consequentially, the inclination angle is allowed to deviate from the donor. The accretion model is particularly insightful for galaxies with rings that intersect with the central portion&#x27;s poles, as opposed to lying along the same orbital plane.

<text>The 6th Marine Division was a United States Marine Corps World War II infantry division formed in September 1944. During the invasion of Okinawa it saw combat at Yae-Take and Sugar Loaf Hill and was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation. The 6th Division had also prepared for the invasion of Japan before the war ended. After the war it served in Tsingtao, China, where the division was disbanded on April 1, 1946, being the only Marine division to be formed and disbanded overseas and never set foot in the United States.

==World War II==
===Formation on the Solomon Islands===
The 6th Marine Division was activated on Guadalcanal in the southern Solomon Islands on September 7, 1944. The 6th Division was formed from three infantry regiments, the 4th, 22nd, and 29th Marines and other units such as engineer, medical, pioneer, motor transport, tank, headquarters, and service battalions. The core cadre around which the division was formed was the former 1st Provisional Marine Brigade which included the 4th and 22nd Marine Regiments, plus their supporting artillery battalions; these artillery battalions were later consolidated into the 15th Marine Regiment.

The Battle of Guam ended in August 1944 and the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was called to Guadalcanal along with the 1st Battalion, 29th Marines, which had served with the 2nd Marine Division in the Battle of Saipan on the Mariana Islands. With a core of all these veterans incorporated into the new division, the 6th was not considered &quot;green&quot; despite being a new formation; most of the men were veterans of at least one campaign and many were serving a second combat tour, half the forces in the three Infantry Regiments were all veterans, and some units even consisted of 70% veterans. The 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 29th Marines, disembarked from the United States on 1 August 1944, and landed on Guadalcanal on 7 September 1944 to further augment the division. The now fully manned 6th Division underwent &quot;rugged&quot; training on Guadalcanal between October and January before it shipped 6,000 miles to land as part of the III Amphibious Corps on Okinawa on 1 April 1945.

===Okinawa===

The division&#x27;s initial objectives in the amphibious landing were the capture of Yontan Airfield and protection of the left (north) flank. Despite a Japanese battalion in their zone the division met only light resistance. By the third day, the division was approaching Iskhikawa, twelve days ahead of schedule. By 14 April, the division had swept all through the northern Ishikawa Isthmus, 55 miles from the original landings. The division&#x27;s rapid advance continued until eventually they encountered prepared and dug-in defenders at Yae-Take, where the majority of the &quot;Udo Force&quot; was entrenched. The &quot;Udo Force&quot;, or Kunigami Detachment, under Colonel Takehiko Udo was built around the 2nd Infantry Unit of the 44th Independent Mixed Brigade—reinforced by having absorbed both former sea-raiding suicide squadrons and remnants of the Battalion earlier destroyed by the 6th—was responsible for defense of the Motobu Peninsula and Ie Shima. The 6th Division&#x27;s drive captured most of northern Okinawa and the Division won praise for its fast campaign – Brigadier General Oliver P. Smith wrote: &quot;The campaign in the north should dispel the belief held by some that Marines are beach-bound and are not capable of rapid movement.&quot;

After heavy fighting in the south, the division was ordered to replace the Army 27th Infantry Division on the western flank. The 6th division advanced south to partake in the assault against the strong Japanese defense line, called the Shuri Line, that had been constructed across the southern coastline. The Shuri Line was located in hills that were honeycombed with caves and passages, and the Marines had to traverse the hills to cross the line. The division was ordered to capture the Sugar Loaf Hill Complex, 3 hills which formed the western anchor of the Shuri Line defense. The Marines that had assaulted the line were attacked by heavy Japanese mortar and artillery fire, which made it more difficult to secure the line. After a week of fighting, the hill had been taken.


After Sugarloaf the Division advanced through Naha, conducted a shore-to-shore amphibious assault on, and subsequent 10-day battle to capture, the Oroku peninsula (defended by Admiral Ōta&#x27;s forces), and partook in mop-up operations in the south. The battle on Okinawa ended on 21 June 1945. The Sixth division was credited with over 23,839 enemy soldiers killed or captured, and with helping to capture of the island, but at the cost of heavy casualties, including 576 casualties on one day (May 16) alone, a day described as the &quot;bitterest&quot; fighting of the Okinawa campaign where &quot;the regiments had attacked with all the effort at their command and had been unsuccessful&quot;.

For its actions at Okinawa, the 6th Marine Division (and reinforcing units) earned a Presidential Unit Citation. The citation reads:

During the war, the 6th Marine Division had two Seabee Battalions posted to it. The 53rd Naval Construction Battalion (NCB) was a component of the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade. Later the 58th NCB replaced them for the invasion of Okinawa. (see: Seabees)

===Guam and China===
In July 1945, the 6th division was withdrawn from Okinawa to the island of Guam to prepare for Operation Coronet, the planned invasion of Honshū, Japan that was supposed to occur in March 1946 but the Japanese surrendered in August 1945. While the 4th Marines were sent for brief occupation duty in Japan, the rest of the 6th spent September in Guam preparing for duty in China.

The division arrived in Tsingtao, China on 11 October 1945 where it remained until it was disbanded on April 1, 1946, being replaced by the 3d Marine Brigade. In its time at Tsingtao the division not only accepted the surrender of local Japanese forces (on October 25) but also oversaw their subsequent repatriation to Japan; prevented the communists from attacking the surrendered Japanese forces and dissuaded communist forces from advancing on the city, restored and maintained order, and came to be seen as the protector of minority groups in the former German concession.

<doc id="810126" wikidata="Q3431550" url="?curid=810126" title="Rick Griffin">
<text>Richard Alden &quot;Rick&quot; Griffin (June 18, 1944 – August 18, 1991) was an American artist and one of the leading designers of psychedelic posters in the 1960s. He was a key figure in the underground comix movement as a fouding member of the &quot;Zap Comix&quot; collective. Griffin was closely identified with the Grateful Dead, designing some of their best-known posters and album covers including &quot;Aoxomoxoa&quot;. His work within the surfing subculture included both film posters and his comic strip, &quot;Murphy&quot;.

==Early life==
Griffin was born near Palos Verdes amidst the surfing culture of southern California. Griffin biographer Tim Stephenson notes:
:&quot;His father was an engineer and amateur archaeologist and as a boy Rick accompanied him on digs in the Southwest. It was during this time that Rick was exposed to the Native American and ghost town artifacts that were to influence his later work. Rick was taught to surf by Randy Nauert at the age of 14 at Torrance Beach. The pair had met at Alexander Jr. High, and were to become lifelong friends, Rick producing much of the artwork for Randy&#x27;s future band, the Challengers.&quot;

While attending Nathaniel Narbonne High School in the Harbor City area of Los Angeles, he produced numerous surfer drawings, which led to his surfing comic strip, &quot;Murphy&quot; for &quot;Surfer&quot; magazine in 1961, with Griffin&#x27;s character featured on the front cover the following year. In 1964, he left &quot;Surfer&quot; and briefly attended Chouinard Art Institute (now CalArts), where he met his future wife, artist Ida Pfefferle as well as the Jook Savages, a group of artist-musicians with whom he took part in Ken Kesey&#x27;s Watts Acid Tests on February 12, 1966. Griffin was intrigued by the psychedelic rock posters being designed by Stanley Mouse and Alton Kelley so after taking time out for a Mexican surfing trip, Rick and Ida headed to San Francisco to check out the scene.

==Career==
===Posters===
Griffin and the Jook Savages arranged an art show, celebrating the one-year anniversary of the Psychedelic Shop on Haight Street for which Griffin designed his first psychedelic poster. Organizers for the Human Be-In saw his work and asked him to design a poster for their January 1967 event. Chet Helms was also impressed by Griffin&#x27;s work and asked him to design posters for the Family Dog dance concerts at the Avalon Ballroom, and later for The Family Dog Denver ballroom in Denver, CO.. In 1967, Griffin, Kelley, Mouse, Victor Moscoso and Wes Wilson teamed with photographer Bob Seidemann as the founders of Berkeley Bonaparte, a company that created and marketed psychedelic posters. In February 1968 Griffin began to design posters for Bill Graham shows, first at The Fillmore Auditorium and later at the Fillmore West. The first of these posters was to become one of his best known works, the &quot;Flying Eyeball&quot; poster for Jimi Hendrix.

=== Comics ===
Griffin was a key figure and founding member of the &quot;Zap Comix&quot; collective. &quot;Man from Utopia&quot; (1972), &quot;Tales from the Tube&quot; (1972), and his Zap pages are considered to be his most notable comic works.

===&quot;The Gospel of John&quot;===
Griffin became a born again Christian in November 1970, which led to fundamental changes in his lifestyle and in the style and content of his art. His 1973 painting &quot;Sail on Sailor&quot; for the band Mustard Seed Faith is an example of his fine art painting from this period. His most significant 1970s project was the creation of hundreds of paintings and drawings for &quot;The Gospel of John&quot;, published by the Christian record label Maranatha! Music. He also produced much album art for Maranatha! during the 1970s and 1980s.

==Death and legacy==
Rick Griffin died shortly after a motorcycle accident on August 15, 1991, in Petaluma, California. He was thrown from his Harley-Davidson motorcycle when he collided with a van that suddenly turned left as he attempted to pass it. He was not wearing a helmet and sustained major head injuries. He died three days later, on August 18, in nearby Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital, at the age of 47.

His work has been cited as an inspiration by well-known artist Roger Dean, known for his designs for bands such as Yes and Asia, and by Mark Wilkinson, known for his designs for bands such as Marillion, Judas Priest and Iron Maiden.

<text>Cathy Anne McMorris Rodgers (born May 22, 1969) is an American politician who served from 2005 to 2025 as the United States representative for , which encompasses the eastern third of the state and includes Spokane, the state&#x27;s second-largest city. A Republican, McMorris Rodgers previously served in the Washington House of Representatives. From 2013 to 2019, she chaired the House Republican Conference.

McMorris Rodgers was appointed to the Washington House of Representatives in 1994. She became the minority leader in 2001. In 2004, she was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. She eventually became the highest-ranking Republican woman in Congress in 2009, when she ascended to leadership as vice chair of the House Republican Conference, and later, chair of the House Republican Conference. She gained national attention in 2014, when she delivered the Republican response to President Barack Obama&#x27;s 2014 State of the Union Address.

In February 2024, she announced she would not seek reelection for the 2024 elections. Republican Michael Baumgartner was elected to her seat and succeeded her in the 119th Congress.

==Early life and education==
Cathy McMorris was born May 22, 1969, in Salem, Oregon, the daughter of Corrine (née Robinson) and Wayne McMorris. Her family had come to the American West in the mid-19th century as pioneers along the Oregon Trail. In 1974, when McMorris was five years old, her family moved to Hazelton, British Columbia, Canada. The family lived in a cabin while they built a log home on their farm. In 1984, the McMorrises settled in Kettle Falls, Washington, and established the Peachcrest Fruit Basket Orchard and Fruit Stand. McMorris worked there for 13 years.

In 1990, McMorris earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in pre-law from Pensacola Christian College, a then-unaccredited Independent Baptist liberal arts college. She earned an Executive MBA from the University of Washington in 2002.

== Career ==
===Washington House of Representatives, 1994–2005===
After completing her undergraduate education, McMorris was hired by state representative Bob Morton in 1991 as his campaign manager, and later as his legislative assistant. She became a member of the state legislature when she was appointed to the Washington House of Representatives in 1994. Her appointment filled the vacancy caused by Morton&#x27;s appointment to the Washington State Senate. After being sworn into office on January 11, 1994, she represented the 7th Legislative District (parts or all of Ferry, Lincoln, Okanogan, Pend Oreille, Spokane, and Stevens Counties). She retained the seat in a 1994 special election.

In 1997, she co-sponsored legislation to ban same-sex marriage in Washington State.

In 2001, she blocked legislation &quot;to replace all references to &#x27;Oriental&#x27; in state documents with &#x27;Asian&#x27;&quot;, explaining, &quot;I&#x27;m very reluctant to continue to focus on setting up different definitions in statute related to the various minority groups. I&#x27;d really like to see us get beyond that.&quot;

She voted against a 2004 bill to add sexual orientation to the state&#x27;s anti-discrimination law, and was a vocal opponent of same-sex marriage. She is credited for sponsoring legislation to require the state reimburse rural hospitals for the cost of serving Medicaid patients, and for her work overcoming opposition in her own caucus to pass a controversial gas tax used to fund transportation improvements.

From 2002 to 2003, she served as House minority leader, the top House Republican leadership post. She chaired the House Commerce and Labor Committee, the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee, and the State Government Committee. She stepped down as minority leader in 2003 after announcing her candidacy for Congress. During her tenure in the legislature, she lived in Colville; she has since moved to Spokane.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
In 2004, McMorris ran for the United States House of Representatives in the 5th District; she already represented much of the district&#x27;s northern portion. She received 59.7% of the vote for an open seat, defeating the Democratic nominee, hotel magnate Don Barbieri. The seat had become vacant when five-term incumbent George Nethercutt retired to run for the U.S. Senate.

===Tenure===
McMorris Rodgers is a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership, the Congressional Constitution Caucus, and the Congressional Western Caucus.
In November 2006, McMorris Rodgers was reelected with 56.4% of the vote, to Democratic nominee Peter J. Goldmark&#x27;s 43.6%. In 2007, she became the Republican co-chair of the Congressional Caucus for Women&#x27;s Issues, which pushed for pay equity, tougher child support enforcement, women&#x27;s health programs, and laws protecting victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.

In 2008, McMorris Rodgers received 211,305 votes (65.28%), to Democratic nominee Mark Mays&#x27;s 112,382 votes (34.72%). On November 19, 2008, she was elected to serve as vice chair of the House Republican Conference for the 111th United States Congress, making her the fourth-highest-ranking Republican in her caucus leadership (after John Boehner, Minority Whip Eric Cantor, and conference chair Mike Pence) and the highest-ranking Republican woman. In 2009, she became vice chair of the House Republican Conference, and served until 2012, when she was succeeded by Lynn Jenkins.
McMorris Rodgers won the 2010 general election with 150,681 votes (64%), to Democratic nominee Daryl Romeyn&#x27;s 85,686 (36%). Romeyn spent only $2,320, against McMorris Rodgers&#x27;s $1,453,240. On November 14, 2012, she defeated Representative Tom Price to become chair of the House Republican Conference.
In the 2012 general election, McMorris Rodgers defeated Democratic nominee Rich Cowan, 191,066 votes (61.9%) to 117,512 (38.9%).

McMorris Rodgers sponsored legislation that would speed the licensing process for dams and promote energy production. According to a Department of Energy study, retrofitting the largest 100 dams in the country could produce enough power for an additional 3.2 million homes. The legislation reached President Obama&#x27;s desk without a single dissenter on Capitol Hill.

In January 2014, it was announced that McMorris Rodgers would give the Republican response to President Barack Obama&#x27;s 2014 State of the Union Address. House speaker John Boehner and Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell made the decision. McMorris Rodgers is the 12th woman to give the response, and the fifth female Republican, but only the third Republican to do so alone, after New Jersey governor Christine Todd Whitman in 1995 and the Spanish response by Florida representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the most senior female Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives, in 2011. Ros-Lehtinen also gave the Spanish response that year, which was largely a translation of McMorris Rogers&#x27; remarks.

In 2014, the Office of Congressional Ethics recommended that the United States House Committee on Ethics initiate a probe into allegations by a former McMorris Rodgers staff member that McMorris Rodgers had improperly mixed campaign money and official funds to help win the 2012 GOP leadership race against Price. McMorris Rodgers denied the allegations. In September 2015, Brett O&#x27;Donnell, who worked for McMorris Rodgers, pleaded guilty to lying to House ethics investigators about how much campaign work he did while being paid by lawmakers&#x27; office accounts, becoming the first person to be convicted of lying to the House Office of Congressional Ethics. The OCE found that McMorris Rodgers improperly used campaign funds to pay O&#x27;Donnell for help in her congressional office, and improperly held a debate prep session in her congressional office. A lawyer for McMorris Rodgers denied that campaign and official resources had ever been improperly mixed. The House Ethics Committee did not take any action on the matter.

In 2014, McMorris Rodgers faced Democratic nominee Joe Pakootas, the first Native American candidate to run for Congress in Washington state. McMorris Rodgers defeated Pakootas, 135,470 votes (60.68%) to 87,772 (39.32%).
In 2016, McMorris Rodgers defeated Pakootas again, 192,959 votes (59.64%) to 130,575 (40.36%).

In 2018, McMorris Rodgers faced Democratic nominee Lisa Brown, a former majority leader of the state senate and former chancellor of WSU Spokane. In the August blanket primary, McMorris Rodgers received 49.29% of the vote to Brown&#x27;s 45.36%. As of early August, McMorris Rodgers had raised about $3.8 million, and Brown about $2.4 million. McMorris Rodgers and Brown participated in a September 2018 debate. Both said they would oppose any cuts to Medicare or Social Security. Both said they supported the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution. An audience member asked how old the candidates believed the earth is; Rodgers said she believed the account in the Bible, and &quot;Brown said she believed in science, but didn&#x27;t provide a specific age&quot;. McMorris defeated Brown with 55% of the vote. Shortly after the election, McMorris Rodgers announced she would stand down from her position as conference chair. Liz Cheney of Wyoming was elected in January 2019 to succeed her.

On February 8, 2024, McMorris Rodgers announced her intent to not run for reelection.

==Political positions==
===Health care===
McMorris Rodgers opposes the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and has voted repeatedly to repeal it. In late 2013, she wrote a letter accusing Democrats of being &quot;openly hostile to American values and the Constitution&quot;, and citing the Affordable Care Act and immigration as evidence that Obama &quot;rule[s] by decree&quot;. She blamed the ACA for causing unemployment, and when FactCheck.org reported studies that proved the opposite and asked her office for evidence to support her claims, &quot;McMorris Rodgers&#x27;s office got back to us not with an answer, but with a question&quot;.

McMorris Rodgers responded in 2014 to reports that Obama&#x27;s program had provided coverage to over 600,000 Washington residents by acknowledging that the law&#x27;s framework would probably remain, and that she favored reforms within its structure. In May 2017, she voted in favor of the American Health Care Act, a Republican health-care plan designed to repeal and replace large portions of the ACA. McMorris Rodgers was the only member of Washington&#x27;s congressional delegation to vote for the bill, which passed the House by a 217–213 vote. The bill would have eliminated the individual mandate, made large cuts to Medicaid, and allowed insurers to charge higher rates to people with preexisting conditions.

In her 2018 reelection campaign, McMorris Rodgers did not mention the Affordable Care Act.

In 2023, McMorris Rodgers led on a health care bill that aimed to increase transparency in health care pricing and ultimately reduce medical costs. The bipartisan piece of legislation passed the House of Representatives with 320-71

=== LGBT rights ===
McMorris Rodgers opposes same-sex marriage, and co-sponsored legislation in 1997 that would ban same-sex marriage in Washington state. She co-sponsored the &quot;Marriage Protection Amendment&quot;, an amendment to the Constitution to prohibit same-sex marriage that failed to pass the House in 2006.

When a bill was introduced in the state legislature in 2004 that would ban discrimination based on sexual orientation, she voted against it; another bill was introduced in 2006, one year after she entered the House of Representatives. This bill was subsequently passed and signed into law by Governor Christine Gregoire.

During an interview with Nick Gillespie in 2014, McMorris Rodgers stated her belief that marriage should be between a man and a woman and her belief that marriage is a state, not federal, issue.

In 2015, McMorris Rodgers voted against upholding Obama&#x27;s 2014 executive order banning federal contractors from making hiring decisions that discriminate based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

In 2016, McMorris Rodgers voted against the Maloney Amendment to H.R. 5055 which would prohibit the use of funds for government contractors who discriminate against LGBT employees.

In 2019 and 2021, McMorris Rodgers voted against the Equality Act. The bill would prohibit &quot;discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity in areas including public accommodations and facilities, education, federal funding, employment, housing, credit, and the jury system.&quot; She issued a statement claiming that the bill &quot;did not do enough to protect religious liberty.&quot;

In 2022, McMorris Rodgers voted against the Respect for Marriage Act, which would establish federal protections for same-sex and interracial marriages.

===Foreign policy===
In 2019, McMorris Rodgers was appointed as the Republican Representative to the United Nations General Assembly

In 2020, McMorris Rodgers voted against the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021, which would prevent the president from withdrawing soldiers from Afghanistan without congressional approval.

In 2022 during the prelude to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, McMorris Rodgers stated that she opposed sending American soldiers into Ukraine as a means to deter Russia. McMorris Rodgers was also the only Washington representative to vote against providing $14 billion in humanitarian aid to the government of Ukraine. McMorris Rodgers voted in support of sending aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, a bipartisan effort bill aimed at helping U.S. allies

In 2022, McMorris Rodgers helped establish the bipartisan, bicameral Abraham Accords Caucus to support peace in the Middle East.

===Marijuana legalization===
McMorris Rodgers has expressed support for the enforcement of federal law in states that have legalized marijuana, saying in 2017: &quot;I think about access to marijuana and the other drugs that I believe it leads to. Right now, it&#x27;s against the law at the federal level, and until it&#x27;s changed at the federal level, I would support [Jeff Sessions&#x27;s] efforts.&quot; She later walked back her position, saying that she &quot;lean[s] against&quot; Sessions&#x27;s move to rescind the 2013 Cole Memorandum. McMorris Rodgers also repeatedly voted against the Rohrabacher–Farr amendment, legislation that limits the enforcement of federal law in states that have legalized medical cannabis.

===School safety===
In 2018, McMorris Rodgers co-sponsored the STOP (Students, Teachers, and Officers Preventing) School Violence Act, which established a federal grant program to &quot;provide $50 million a year for a new federal grant program to train students, teachers, and law enforcement on how to spot and report signs of gun violence&quot;, and authorize $25 million for new physical security measures in schools, such as &quot;new locks, lights, metal detectors, and panic buttons&quot;. A separate spending bill would be required to provide money for the grant program. The House voted 407–10 to approve the bill.

===Donald Trump===
After Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, McMorris Rodgers became the vice-chair of his transition team. She was widely considered a top choice for Secretary of the Interior. Several papers went so far as to announce she had been chosen. Instead, Montana congressman Ryan Zinke was nominated.

McMorris Rodgers supported Trump&#x27;s 2017 executive order to block entry to the United States to citizens of seven predominantly Muslim nations, calling the order necessary &quot;to protect the American people&quot;.

In December 2020, McMorris Rodgers was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of &quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania&quot;, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.

In January 2021, McMorris Rodgers announced her intention to object to the certification of the Electoral College results in Congress, citing allegations of fraud. She reversed her position after pro-Trump rioters stormed the United States Capitol, and said she would vote to certify Biden&#x27;s win.

She was the only member of Washington&#x27;s congressional delegation to vote against the impeachment of Donald Trump for his actions stoking the January 6, 2021 assault on the Capitol.

=== Creationism ===
McMorris Rodgers rejects the theory of evolution, saying, &quot;the account that I believe is the one in the Bible, that God created the world in seven days.&quot;

=== Women&#x27;s rights ===
In March 2013, McMorris Rodgers did not support the continuation of the 1994 Violence Against Women Act, but sponsored a clean reauthorization of the bill. Ultimately, her bill failed, and the House adopted the Senate version of the bill.

=== Broadband ===
In 2021, McMorris Rodgers introduced legislation to prohibit municipalities from building their own broadband networks.

=== Immigration ===
McMorris Rodgers voted against the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 which authorizes DHS to nearly double the available H-2B visas for the remainder of FY 2020.

McMorris Rodgers voted against Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1158) which effectively prohibits ICE from cooperating with Health and Human Services to detain or remove illegal alien sponsors of unaccompanied alien children (UACs).

=== Big tech ===
In July 2021, McMorris Rodgers introduced draft legislation that would allow users of Big Tech platforms to sue companies if they think the companies censored speech protected by the First Amendment.

In 2024, McMorris Rodgers voted in favor of banning TikTok for their ties to the Communist China Party and posing as a national security threat. McMorris Rodgers would lead the Energy and Commerce Committee in a hearing with the TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who testified on TikTok&#x27;s consumer privacy and data security practices, the platforms&#x27; impact on kids, and its relationship with the Chinese Communist Party.

== Electoral history ==
==Personal life==
Cathy McMorris married Brian Rodgers on August 5, 2006, in San Diego. Brian Rodgers is a retired Navy commander and a Spokane native. He is a U.S. Naval Academy graduate, and the son of David H. Rodgers, the mayor of Spokane from 1967 to 1977. In February 2007, she changed her name to Cathy McMorris Rodgers. Having long resided in Stevens County—first Colville, then Deer Park—she now lives in Spokane.

In April 2007, McMorris Rodgers became the first member of Congress in more than a decade to give birth while in office, with the birth of a son. The couple later announced that their child had been diagnosed with Down syndrome. A second child, a daughter, was born in December 2010, and a second daughter in November 2013.

According to the Official Congressional Directory, she is a member of Grace Evangelical Free Church in Colville.

<doc id="810140" wikidata="Q917560" url="?curid=810140" title="USS Mississinewa (AO-59)">
<text>USS &quot;Mississinewa&quot; (AO-59) was the first of two United States Navy ships of the name. She was a T3-S2-A1 auxiliary oiler of the US Navy, laid down on 5 October 1943 by the Bethlehem Sparrows Point Shipyard, Inc., Sparrows Point, Maryland; launched on 28 March 1944; sponsored by Miss Margaret Pence; and commissioned on 18 May 1944. &quot;Mississinewa&quot; was commanded by Captain Philip G. Beck. The ship is named for the Mississinewa River of eastern Indiana.

==World War II==
&quot;Mississinewa&quot; began her brief but active wartime service on 18 May 1944. Having completed shakedown in the Chesapeake Bay, she sailed for Aruba, Netherland West Indies, to take on her first cargo. Filling her cargo tanks on 23–24 June she continued on to the Pacific Ocean, arriving Pearl Harbor on 10 July. As a unit of Service Squadron 10 (ServRon 10), she then steamed to Eniwetok where she first fueled ships of the 3rd Fleet. On 25 August, she got underway for Manus where she supplied fuel and stores and delivered mail to ships of TF 38, the fast carrier force, 32 and 31 during the assault and occupation of the Palaus.

Returning to Manus on 30 September, she replenished her tanks and again headed north to refuel TF 38 as that force struck at Japanese shipping and shore installations in the Philippines, on Taiwan, and in the Ryukyus in preparation for the Philippine campaign. On 19 October, having emptied her tanks into ships scheduled to take part in the landings at Leyte, she sailed to Ulithi in the Caroline Islands, her new base. In early November, &quot;Mississinewa&quot; sailed her last fueling at sea assignment, returning on the 15th.

The next day, she replenished her cargo tanks, filling them almost to capacity with of aviation gas, of diesel fuel, and of fuel oil. Four days later, 20 November, she was still anchored in berth No. 131. At 05:47, shortly after reveille, a heavy explosion rocked the oiler. Seconds later, fumes in an aviation gas cargo tank ignited, causing a second explosion. Massive flames immediately burst from midship forward. Bunker C oil immediately engulfed the ship, with aviation gas on top of that. The aviation gas acted like a wick. Fanned by a light wind, the fire spread aft quickly. A few minutes later the fires reached the after magazine and caused yet another explosion to tear through the ship. The ship was abandoned and soon enveloped in flames over high. Fleet tugs were immediately brought in to try to extinguish the fire, but in spite of their efforts, at about 09:00 the ship slowly turned over and disappeared. Fifteen minutes later, the fire on the water was out and Ulithi anchorage was again quiet. This ship was the first to be hit by a Japanese &quot;Kaiten&quot; manned torpedo. The ship sank with a loss of 63 hands as well as the &quot;kaiten&quot; pilot.
Of the five &quot;kaiten&quot; sent against US ships, only one was successful, but the explosion and fire from &quot;Mississinewa&quot; was so great that the Japanese Naval Command back in Tokyo were erroneously informed that three aircraft carriers were hit. This resulted in an expansion of the &quot;kaiten&quot; program, even though it would not significantly affect the war.
&quot;Mississinewa&quot; was hit in the front starboard bow area, the &quot;kaiten&quot; probably released by Japanese submarine &quot;I-47&quot; just outside Ulithi lagoon.

&quot;Mississinewa&quot; received four battle stars for World War II service.

==Discovery of shipwreck==
The &quot;Mississinewa&quot; remained undiscovered in a tropical lagoon of Yap State for over 56 years. On 6 April 2001, the hulk of the shipwreck was found by adventure divers at a depth of roughly north of Mogmog Island, Ulithi, Micronesia. For two months, from July 2001 to August, the sunken wreck leaked oil into the Ulithi lagoon. Officials estimated that 18,000 to 24,000 gallons of oil had been released over the course of two months, threatening coral reefs, sea turtle breeding grounds, and local fishing. Following a typhoon, the island&#x27;s beaches and the lagoon were contaminated by heavy fuel oil leaking from the wreck.

A state of emergency was declared by the Governor of Yap. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Yap Marine Resources Department imposed a ban on fishing in the lagoon. In September 2001, a dive team and contractors hired by the U.S. Navy led a survey to determine the status of the wreck and the potential for environmental damage from the deteriorating hulk. Divers confirmed leaks, finding cracks in two of the &quot;Mississinewa&#x27;s&quot; tanks. A second oil leak from the oiler was reported in December 2001 and leaks were plugged in February 2002. An investigation by the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme found that the estimated 5,000,000 gallons of oil remaining in the wreck constituted an &quot;unacceptable and ever present risk&quot;. The potential for a large release of the tanker&#x27;s cargo fuel made a recovery attempt necessary.

In February 2003, a US Navy salvage team led an expedition to recover as much oil as possible. Divers used &quot;hot taps&quot; to drill into the oil tanks and removed all accessible oil, nearly , rendering the wreck safer. The recovered oil was barged back to Singapore, where it was sold for $0.50/gallon to help cover the $11 million salvage costs.

The ship was featured on the television shows &quot;The Sea Hunters&quot;, &quot;Deep Sea Detectives&quot;, and &quot;Dogfights&quot;.

<text>A Torah database (מאגר תורני or מאגר יהדות) is a collection of classic Jewish texts in electronic form, the kinds of texts which, especially in Israel, are often called &quot;The Traditional Jewish Bookshelf&quot; (ארון הספרים היהודי); the texts are in their original languages (Hebrew or Aramaic). These databases contain either keyed-in digital texts or a collection of page-images from printed editions. Given the nature of traditional Jewish Torah study, which involves extensive citation and cross-referencing among hundreds of texts written over the course of thousands of years, many Torah databases also make extensive use of hypertext links.

A Torah database usually refers to a collection of primary texts, rather than translations or secondary research and reference materials.

==Digital Text Software Packages==

===The Bar-Ilan Responsa Project===
The very first such database was the Bar Ilan Responsa Project, which began in 1963 at the Weizmann Institute in Israel, migrated to Bar-Ilan University soon thereafter, and was up and running by 1967. It became available in time-sharing mode from university terminals in 1979, was transferred to CD-ROM in 1990 and in the mid 2000s to flash drive, and version 1.0 was offered for sale to the public in 1992. The current version is number 32 or 32+ (the &quot;plus&quot; version contains an important secondary reference called the Encyclopedia Talmudit).

The Responsa Project tries to base its electronic texts on the most accurate printed editions (though it seems that it is sometimes prevented from doing so because of copyright considerations), and it has a reputation for relatively error-free electronic texts based upon those editions. It also features approximately 360,000 hypertext links between the various collections within the database, as well as a topical halakhic index for the Shulchan Aruch and selected responsa. Since its early years it has employed a sophisticated search-engine specifically designed for Hebrew language texts.

In recent years (at least since version 10 in 2002), the Responsa Project has made updates available once a year, usually between the Passover and Shavuot holidays, although this varies considerably. Sometimes they release an update after the holiday of Chanukah or after the holiday of Purim. It depends on how much they have completed.

In January, 2007, the responsa project became available in an online edition.

In April, 2007 the Responsa Project won the Israel Prize for Jewish studies.

Currently (as of 2024, version 32+) according to their list the number of seforim listed is over 1,000 (excluding the Chazon Ish which is only available for searching). The Kabbalah section includes only the Zohar, and a few works listed under Otzar HaMidrashim. However, the other sections contain many essential and important seforim.

===DBS Master Library===
DBS rivals the Bar-Ilan Responsa project in size. It has less in the overall area of Halakha and fewer responsa, but rivals Bar Ilan&#x27;s Reponsa project in: Jewish philosophy and Mussar. To date, the latest Bar Ilan and the latest DBS versions are comparable mostly, in terms of number of texts in these areas. Bar Ilan surpasses DBS in the commentaries on Talmud Bavli, the Reponsa, commentaries on the Mishneh Torah etc. DBS surpasses Bar Ilan in the area of Hasidut and Kabbalah. In recent years, Bar Ilan has included a great number of texts that considered to be mostly accurate, and mostly error free and has become the gold standard of any Torah database. DBS has lagged behind, although its Kabbalah section is fantastic, it is not clear which texts were used as well as their accuracy and whether the text presented is accurate.

DBS contains a good number of Hebrew texts with vowels (niqqud); see below. Criticisms: It does not have extensive hypertext links between its various large collections, the texts are considered to be inaccurate and may have some errors in them. It is not as comprehensive in many areas, compared with Bar Ilan.

=== Soncino Classics Collection ===

Produced by Davka corporation, Soncino Classics Collection includes
# Soncino English translations of the Tanach, Babylonian Talmud, Midrash Rabbah, and Zohar;
# Hebrew and Aramaic texts of the Tanach, Babylonian Talmud, Midrash Rabbah and Zohar, as well as Rashi&#x27;s commentary on Talmud.

Soncino Classics Collection is a commercial software.

===The Torah Bookshelf (&quot;Halamish&quot;)===
&quot;Otzar ha-Poskim&quot; (also see below) produces &quot;The Torah Bookshelf,&quot; a large digital collection of basic texts called &quot;Halamish&quot; (Ha-Sifriyah ha-Toranit) in Hebrew, currently in version 3.0.

===Ariel===
Ariel (currently version 2.1) uses the same software as Otzar ha-Poskim&#x27;s &quot;Torah Bookshelf&quot; and is similar to it in scope (a large basic collection), but many of the titles in the two collections are not the same.

===Mikra&#x27;ot Gedolot Haketer===
Bar-Ilan University&#x27;s project to produce an entirely new critical edition of the Mikra&#x27;ot Gedolot is also being made available in electronic form in addition to the printed volumes, The project contains four main elements:
*The biblical text (based on the Aleppo codex and a careful reconstruction of its missing parts) is keyed-in, including vowels and cantillation signs, allowing for sophisticated research on details of grammar.
*The masorah is also keyed in (also based on the Aleppo codex and supplemented by a special commentary).
*The Targum is included with vowels, based on manuscripts of the Yemenite &quot;Taj&quot;.
*The biblical commentaries are also keyed-in as fresh new editions based on manuscripts.

The CD-ROM is currently in version 2.0 (beta).

&quot;(Note: Although also under the auspices of Bar-Ilan University, this project is unrelated to the Bar-Ilan Responsa Project.)&quot;

===Digital Hebrew Texts with Vowels (Niqqud)===

====Tanakh====
Tanakh is available as a keyed-in digital Hebrew text with vowels (niqqud) in &quot;all&quot; of the above software packages.

Tanakh with both vowels and cantillation signs is available in the Mikra&#x27;ot Gedolot Haketer package and as online freeware from Mechon Mamre, Hebrew Wikisource and Base HaSefer (see the latter three below). All of these versions are based on the Aleppo codex, but Mechon Mamre&#x27;s edition is based on the editing method of Rabbi Mordecai Breuer, which differs slightly from the Mikra&#x27;ot Gedolot Haketer edition in some small details. Hebrew Wikisource is similar to both of these versions (see a full description) and the text at Base HaSefer is based on that of Hebrew Wikisource.

====Targum====
Both Targum Onkelos on the Torah and Targum Jonathan on Nevi&#x27;im are vowelized (based on Yemenite manuscripts) in the digital texts of Mikra&#x27;ot Gedolot Haketer. Targum Onkelos is vowelized in the Judaic Bookshelf package and as online freeware from Mechon Mamre, Hebrew Wikisource, Al Hatorah and Base HaSefer; most of these edition are taken from the first edition of the Taj.

====Mishnah====
The Mishnah is included as a keyed-in digital Hebrew text with vowels in all of the general software packages above. The vowels in the &quot;Halamish&quot; package seem to be based upon the Albeck edition of the Mishnah (see Mishnah).

====Siddur and liturgy====
Siddur: Digital with vowels (according to various customs) are included in DBS (Ashkenaz, Sefard, Sefaradi/Edot Mizrah), Judaic Bookshelf (Ashkenaz, Sefard), and Ariel (Ashkenaz, Sefard, Sefaradi/Edot Mizrah). The latest version of DBS (version 10) also includes , , and the Passover .

Al Hatorah includes a siddur and a haggadah with many commentaries, but it is less useful as a siddur to use for prayers.

====Popular ethical works (musar)====
Popular ethical works are normally vowelized in published editions. DBS&#x27;s collection of such works includes vowels in the electronic editions.

====Popular halakhic works====
Some of these are also vowelized in DBS.

==Page-Image software packages==

===Otzar HaHochma===
This project is based on page-images of 128,200 scanned Jewish books. It is possible to add additional libraries (Mosad Harav Kook, Machon Yerushalayim Publications, Ahavat Shalom Publishers, and Kehot Publication Society). Additionally, the user can find books by topic. The system has features which turns it to a learning tool.

===Otzar ha-Shut===
&quot;Otzar ha-Poskim&quot; produces &quot;Otzar ha-Shut&quot; (hyperlinked images of individual responsa indexed according to the order of the Shulhan Arukh). This package also includes &quot;Halamish&quot; (see above).

===The Steinzaltz Talmud on CD-ROM===
The Steinsaltz Talmud is available as searchable PDF images on CD-ROM. All material from the printed edition is included, but it can be copied and pasted only as images and not as digital text.

==Wikimedia Torah study projects==
Text study projects at Wikisource allow contributors to help build free content Torah databases at Wikimedia through volunteer typing and editing. Please note that in most instances, these projects proceed much faster in Hebrew than in English.
*Mikraot Gedolot (Rabbinic Bible) in Hebrew (sample) and English (sample).
*Cantillation at the &quot;Vayavinu Bamikra&quot; Project in Hebrew (lists nearly 200 recordings) and English.
*Mishnah in Hebrew and English (sample).
*Shulchan Aruch in Hebrew and English (Hebrew text with English translation).
*Aruch HaShulchan is available in a newly formatted, digital Hebrew version at Hebrew Wikisource (over 600 chapters are currently available). See also Orach Chaim index.

==Free Torah libraries==
There are also some online projects that make either digital texts, or public domain images of old books, available to the public for free:
*Hebrew Wikisource – thousands of Torah texts in a digital library that is continually being expanded and improved by volunteers
*HebrewBooks.org – was founded to preserve old American Hebrew books that are out of print or circulation, but it expanded its mission &quot;to include all Torah Seforim (=books) ever printed&quot;. Over 60,000 out-of-print books and journals may be downloaded as PDF images on the main site and on its beta version. Additionally, there are also many copyrighted works that have been submitted by the original authors or their families for inclusion within this website. They have begun to work on OCRing the scans and making the full-text searchable.
*Mechon Mamre – provides free access to Tanakh, Mishnah, Tosefta, Jerusalem Talmud, Babylonian Talmud, Mishneh Torah of Maimonides
*The Daat Library – variety of primary texts, including many of R&#x27; Yosef Qafih&#x27;s (&quot;Kapach&quot;) and other more critical editions
*Genizah – Textual variants of every page of Talmud Bavli
*Sefaria – includes interactive bilingual texts collected from public sources or created by volunteer translators
*Sages of Ashkenaz – provides various Ashkenazi seforim, site no longer up 
*Seforim Online – provides PDF images of several hundred classic rabbinic texts; all are in the public domain
*Sifrei Kodesh Search – Firefox add-on for searching texts
*Base Hasefer – enables search and analysis of &quot;Sifrei Kodesh&quot; as if the content implicitly forms a relational database. It contains the full text of the Tanach and Targum Onkelos. It can search for vowels, cantillation marks, word roots, anagrams, regular expressions, gematria and word positions with an unlimited use of wildcard characters.  Analysis tools include: original Hebrew text viewed with parallel columns including Targum and other related content; a powerful lexicon; an interactive parse-tree of verses broken down by cantillation rules; tag-clouds for viewing frequencies; a tool for comparing and analyzing two different selections of Tanach.
* Al Hatorah - This started as a database for Bible and commentaries, but it has now been expanded to include Talmud, Shulchan Aruch, the siddur, and several works on Jewish thought, all presented with commentaries.

<text>The Mercedes-Euklid is a German-invented calculator from the early twentieth century. It was built by &quot;Mercedes Büro-Maschinen Werke AG&quot; in Thuringia, Germany in 1905. The first manual mechanical models utilized a proportional-lever design invented by Christel Hamann in 1903.

An electric model, the Mercedes Euklid 30, was released circa 1945, though it may not have been the company&#x27;s first electric calculator. In the 1960s, another electric model was released under the name &quot;Cellatron.&quot;

<text>The Frazier lens is a special camera lens designed by Australian photographer Jim Frazier. The Frazier lens provides an appearance of a massive depth of field, allowing the foreground and background of an image to be in focus. Frazier&#x27;s lenses have been widely used in Hollywood and wildlife cinematography. In addition to its unique depth of field properties, the Frazier lens is significantly smaller than previous deep focus lenses allowing more versatility and flexibility to cinematographers. The main feature of the lens, an extended tube with a rotating prism, allows cinematographers to place the camera in a variety of positions for a given shot. Cinematographers then rotate the prism to correct the horizon. This feature allows directors and camera operators to achieve shots in minutes that previously took cinematographers hours in rigging and designing special sets to accommodate shooting positions.

== Patent claims ==
A United States patent was issued on 10 March 1998 for the lens and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded a Technical Achievement Award to Frazier for his lenses. The patent was licensed to Panavision for production and marketing of the lens. In 2003, Panavision and Frazier brought suit against Roessel Cine Photo Tech, Inc. for violating the patent.

At the trial, it was discovered that the 60-minute Panavision educational video that the Frazier lawyers had submitted (&quot;in the interests of demonstrating to the Examiner the features and uniqueness of the optical system of this patent application&quot;) had eight seconds of a shot that had been created with a different lens. Although Frazier reshot the footage in question with the Frazier Panavision lens the patent was declared unenforceable for inequitable conduct and attorney&#x27;s fees were awarded to the defendants.

<doc id="810178" wikidata="Q5500522" url="?curid=810178" title="Freedom Downtime">
<text>Freedom Downtime is a 2001 documentary film sympathetic to the convicted computer hacker Kevin Mitnick, directed by Emmanuel Goldstein and produced by 2600 Films.

The documentary centers on the fate of Mitnick, who is claimed to have been misrepresented in the feature film &quot;Takedown&quot; (2000) produced by Miramax and adapted from the book by the same name by Tsutomu Shimomura and John Markoff, which is based on disputed events. The film also documents a number of computer enthusiasts who drive across the United States searching for Miramax representatives and demonstrating their discontent with certain aspects of the bootleg script of &quot;Takedown&quot; they had acquired. One of their major points of criticism was that the script ended with Mitnick being convicted to serve a long-term prison sentence, while in reality, at the time the film&#x27;s production, Mitnick had not yet even had a trial but nonetheless was incarcerated for five years without bail in a high-security facility. Freedom Downtime also touches on what happened to other hackers after being sentenced. The development of the Free Kevin movement is also covered.

Several notable and iconic figures from the hacking community appear in the movie, including Phiber Optik (Mark Abene), Bernie S (Ed Cummings), Alex Kasper, and director Emmanuel Goldstein (Eric Corley). &quot;Freedom Downtime&quot; tries to communicate a different view of the hacker community from that usually shown by the mainstream media, with hackers being depicted as curious people who rarely intend to cause damage, driven by a desire to explore and conduct pranks. The film questions the rationality of placing computer hackers who went &quot;over the line&quot; in the same environment as serious felons.

It also contains interviews with people related to Mitnick and hacker culture in general. The authors of &quot;Cyberpunk: Outlaws and Hackers on the Computer Frontier&quot;, ex-couple Katie Hafner and John Markoff, appear in very different roles. While Hafner&#x27;s empathy for Mitnick is shown to have grown, Markoff continues to defend his critical book and articles in The New York Times newspaper about the hacker. Markoff is ridiculed as the narrator, director Goldstein (a hacker himself), points out his factual errors during the interview. Reba Vartanian, Mitnick&#x27;s grandmother, also appears in a number of interview segments. Furthermore, lawyers, friends, and libertarians give their view of the story. Footage and interviews from the DEF CON and Hackers on Planet Earth conventions try to dispel some hacker myths and confirm others.

The film premiered at H2K, the 2000 H.O.P.E. convention. After that the film saw a limited independent theatrical release and was shown at film festivals. It was released on VHS and sold via the &quot;2600&quot; website.

In June 2004, a DVD was released. The DVD includes a wealth of extra material spread over two discs, including three hours of extra footage, an interview with Kevin Mitnick in January 2003 (shortly after his supervised release ended), and various DVD eggs. It also includes subtitles in 20 languages, provided by volunteers.

<doc id="810183" wikidata="Q228327" url="?curid=810183" title="Access network">
<text>An access network is a type of telecommunications network which connects subscribers to their immediate service provider. It is contrasted with the core network, which connects local providers to one another. The access network may be further divided between feeder plant or distribution network, and drop plant or edge network.

==Telephone heritage==
An access network, also referred to as an outside plant, refers to the series of wires, cables and equipment lying between a consumer/business telephone termination point (the point at which a telephone connection reaches the customer) and the local telephone exchange. The local exchange contains banks of automated switching equipment which direct a call or connection to the consumer. The access network is perhaps one of the oldest assets a telecoms operator would own.

In 2007–2008 many telecommunication operators experienced increasing problems maintaining the quality of the records which describe the network. In 2006, according to an independent Yankee Group report, globally operators experience profit leakage in excess of $17 billion each year.

The access network is also perhaps the most valuable asset an operator owns since this is what physically allows them to offer a service.

Access networks consist largely of pairs of copper wires, each traveling in a direct path between the exchange and the customer. In some instances, these wires may even consist of aluminum, which was commonly used in the 1960s and 1970s following a massive increase in the cost of copper. The price increase was temporary, but the effects of this decision are still felt today as electromigration within the aluminum wires can cause an increase in on-state resistance. This resistance causes degradation which can eventually lead to the complete failure of the wire to transport data.

Access is essential to the future profitability of operators who are experiencing massive reductions in revenue from plain old telephone services, due in part to the opening of historically nationalized companies to competition, and in part to increased use of mobile phones and voice over IP (VoIP) services. Operators offered additional services such as xDSL based broadband and IPTV (Internet Protocol television) to guarantee profit. The access network is again the main barrier to achieving these profits since operators worldwide have accurate records of only 40% to 60% of the network. Without understanding or even knowing the characteristics of these enormous copper spider webs, it is very difficult, and expensive to &#x27;provision&#x27; (connect) new customers and assure the data rates required to receive next-generation services.

Access networks around the world evolved to include more and more optical fiber technology. Optical fiber already makes up the majority of core networks and will start to creep closer and closer to the customer, until a full transition is achieved, delivering value-added services over fiber to the home (FTTH).

==Access process==

The process of communicating with a network begins with an access attempt, in which one or more users interact with a communications system to enable initiation of user information transfer. An access attempt itself begins with issuance of an access request by an access originator.

An access attempt ends either in successful access or in access failure - an unsuccessful access that results in termination of the attempt in any manner other than initiation of user information transfer between the intended source and destination (sink) within the specified maximum access time.

Access time is the time delay or latency between a requested access attempt and successful access being completed. In a telecommunications system, access time values are measured only on access attempts that result in successful access.

Access failure can be the result of access outage, user blocking, incorrect access, or access denial. Access denial (system blocking) can include: 
*Access failure caused by the issuing of a system blocking signal by a communications system that does not have a camp-on busy signal feature. 
*Access failure caused by exceeding the maximum access time and nominal system access time fraction during an access attempt.

==Charging for access==
An access charge is a charge made by a local exchange carrier for use of its local exchange facilities for a purpose such as the origination or termination of network traffic that is carried to or from a distant exchange by an interexchange carrier.

Although some access charges are billed directly to interexchange carriers, a significant percentage of all access charges are paid by the local end users.

==Mobile access networks==

* GERAN
* UTRAN
* E-UTRAN
* CDMA2000
* GSM
* UMTS
* 1xEVDO
* voLTE
* Wi-Fi in* WiMAX

==Optical distribution network==
A passive optical distribution network (PON) uses single-mode optical fiber in the outside plant, optical splitters and optical distribution frames, duplexed so that both upstream and downstream signals share the same fiber on separate wavelengths. Faster PON standards generally support a higher split ratio of users per PON, but may also use reach extenders/amplifiers where extra coverage is needed. Optical splitters creating a point to multipoint topology are also the same technology regardless of the type of PON system, making any PON network upgradable by changing the optical network terminals (ONT) and optical line terminal (OLT) terminals at each end, with minimal change to the physical network.

Access networks usually also must support point-to-point technologies such as Ethernet, which bypasses any outside plant splitter to achieve a dedicated link to the telephone exchange. Some PON networks use a &quot;home run&quot; topology where roadside cabinets only contain patch panels so that all splitters are located centrally. While a 20% higher capital cost could be expected, home run networks may encourage a more competitive wholesale market since providers&#x27; equipment can achieve higher use.

<doc id="810184" wikidata="Q6456509" url="?curid=810184" title="LJ Hooker">
<text>LJ Hooker is one of Australia&#x27;s largest real estate groups, with 600 franchise offices and 6,000 people engaged in residential and commercial property sales and property management. The company was founded in 1928 by Sir Leslie Joseph Hooker and after being sold to a private company for 20 years, the company returned to family hands in 2009.

==History==
The first LJ Hooker office was opened in Maroubra, New South Wales in 1928. Following the Depression, the company expanded and opened offices in Sydney, Kensington, Kingsford and Randwick. In 1936, LJ Hooker purchased the real estate business and offices of Woods &amp; Co. in Kensington and Kingsford. In 1938, Rex Investments is registered and purchased real-estate agencies and hotels around Australia. The following year, LJ Hooker established its headquarters in Pitt Street, Sydney by buying H. L. Cross &amp; Co., a city agency.

In 1946, LJ Hooker bought the real estate business of Harold Bray Pty Ltd in Bondi Beach. In 1947, the company was floated on the Sydney Stock Exchange. The following year, LJ Hooker purchased F. Egan &amp; Son, a real estate agency in Bondi Junction. In 1949, the company expanded into hotel brokerage.

In 1950, the tenth office was opened in Crows Nest and in 1951 the Manly office was opened after the purchase of Thorn Coleman &amp; Co. LJ Hooker&#x27;s expansion continued, and by 1953 the agency was the largest real estate agency in Australia. In 1955 Hooker Rex was established for the development of new homes in Batemans Bay, Kogarah and the Gold Coast through Hooker Rex Pty Ltd. In 1958, the company&#x27;s name was changed to L. J. Hooker Investment Corporation Ltd. In 1959, the Hooker Finance company was established.

In 1960, LJ Hooker became Australia&#x27;s first national real estate agency network. The following year, Hooker Projects began developing nursing homes, motels and other projects. In 1963, Hooker House was opened in Sydney. Hooker Project offices were opened in Melbourne in 1966, Brisbane in 1967, Perth in 1968, and Townsville and Canberra in 1969.

In 1968, the company&#x27;s name changed to Hooker Corporation Ltd. In 1969, Hooker Home Units was established, which specialised in building home units and town houses.
Leslie Joseph Hooker died in 1976. In 1985, George Herscu bought the Hooker Group for $450 million. In 1989, LJ Hooker owed $1.77 billion, and was purchased by Suncorp Metway.

In 2009, Janusz Hooker, Leslie Hooker&#x27;s grandson, formed a consortium with other buyers and bought the company back from Suncorp-Metway for $67 million. In 2015, Janusz Hooker and other shareholders bought out the minority shareholders to consolidate ownership of the company.

==International expansion==
In the mid-1980s, while led briefly by CEO George Herscu, LJ Hooker crossed into development and acquisition of retailers and large scale shopping complexes in the United States. During this period LJ Hooker also acquired Merrill Lynch Commercial Real Estate in an effort to infuse seasoned Commercial Real estate expertise into its retail development arm. Robert Rodriguez (Sr. VP) and Dennis Mulligan (VP) led the retail real estate group for Merrill Lynch Commercial Real estate. This move proved ill-conceived, with such ventures as the purchase and operation of several storied American department store chains as B. Altman &amp; Co., Bonwit Teller, Sakowitz and Parisian stores, to be used as anchors for a number of large shopping malls in the United States. Having no track record in understanding the complex operations required to run retail department stores, this venture proved deeply flawed and plunged LJ Hooker, the department stores and its various development holdings into bankruptcy.

Most of the department store chains were liquidated with large economic and employment losses. The one mall complex that was constructed during Herscu&#x27;s tenure, the Forest Fair Mall in suburban Cincinnati, Ohio, went through numerous changes in ownership and operations. Today the ill-fated mall is still struggling, having gone through three name changes. This period, although brief in its history, was deeply tumultuous and troubling and led to LJ Hooker Limited being purchased by the Queensland based Suncorp-Metway, in January 1989.

LJ Hooker was liquidated in the late 1980s, but the name continued through the franchise arrangement that continues. In 1997, it opened offices in Hong Kong and Papua New Guinea.

===Acquisitions===
In 1996, LJ Hooker purchased the Challenge Realty Group in New Zealand and in 1998 they rebranded it as LJ Hooker. In 2003, LJ Hooker purchased the real estate franchise group Olsen &amp; Everson. In 2002, LJ Hooker opened its first offices in Indonesia, and in 2004, LJ Hooker opened offices in Mumbai, India, and Shanghai.

In October 2004, Grahame Cooke stepped down as CEO and was replaced by Warren McCarthy.

In October 2009, Suncorp confirmed it sold its LJ Hooker real estate chain business to Janusz Hooker, the grandson of founder Sir Leslie Hooker, for $67 million. In July 2015, he also bought out the investors to take full control of the group.

In November 2010, LJ Hooker acquired Harveys Real Estate Group in New Zealand.

==Organisation==
Hooker Corporation Limited is the holding company, and LJ Hooker Limited is the trading entity. Hooker Corporation Limited&#x27;s ACN is 003 890 444 and the ACN of L.J. Hooker Limited is 003 890 4553. LJ Hooker is a franchise operation. The real estate side of the business is done by franchise owners. Grant Harrod was appointed chief executive officer and managing director in 2014. The company chairman is Janusz Hooker.

===Subsidiaries===
LJ Hooker has also established an independent incorporated legal practice trading as LJ Hooker Conveyancing NSW, which is a division of Guardian Conveyancers Pty Ltd (ACN 136 790 022). The business is independently owned and operated under licence from LJ Hooker Limited. LJ Hooker Conveyancing is located in Sydney. In Western Australia it uses LJ Hooker Settlements to do their conveyancing.

<text>David George Reichert ( ; born August 29, 1950) is an American retired police officer and politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 2005 to 2019. A moderate member of the Republican Party, he served as the sheriff of King County, Washington, from 1997 to 2005.

In September 2017, Reichert announced he would retire from Congress after his seventh term.

Reichert unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2024, losing to Democrat Bob Ferguson.

==Early life, education, and military career==

Reichert was born in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, the son of Marlys Ann (née Troeger) and George F. Reichert. He is the eldest of seven children and a grandson of the town marshal. His family moved to Washington in 1951, living first in Renton, then later moving to Kent, where he attended Kent Meridian High School. In 1968, he graduated and went to Concordia Lutheran College in Portland, Oregon on a partial football scholarship. He earned an Associate of Arts degree in social work in 1970.

In 1971 he joined the Air Force Reserves&#x27; 939th Military Airlift Group. He saw active duty for six months and served until 1976.

==Law enforcement career ==

Reichert began serving with the King County Sheriff&#x27;s Office (KCSO) in 1972. He was a member of the Green River Task Force, formed to track down the &quot;Green River killer&quot;. In 1984, he and fellow King County homicide detective Robert Keppel met with incarcerated serial killer Ted Bundy to form a psychological profile of the Green River killer. In 2001, DNA evidence identified Gary Leon Ridgway as the Green River killer. In 2004, Reichert published the memoir &quot;Chasing the Devil: My Twenty-Year Quest to Capture the Green River Killer&quot;.

In 1971, during his second year in law enforcement, Reichert responded to a domestic violence call in which a knife-wielding man was attempting to kill his wife. The man attacked Reichert and slit his throat, which required stitches and surgery. In an interview, Reichert said of the incident, &quot;I was able to save [the wife], and we got into a scuffle and fell over a coffee table in the living room, and he slit my throat with a butcher knife, ending up with forty-five stitches in my neck.&quot; He was awarded with one of his two Medals of Valor for his bravery.

In 1997, he was appointed sheriff of King County, Washington, by King County Executive Ron Sims. In 2001, he ran unopposed for a second four-year term.

Reichert served as president of the Washington State Sheriffs Association. He was an executive board member of the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs.

In 2004 Reichert won the 2004 National Sheriffs&#x27; Association&#x27;s Sheriff of the Year award, two valor awards, and the Washington State attorney general&#x27;s award for courageous action.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

At the same time, the Democratic presidential nominee, Senator John Kerry won, 51% to 48%, against President George W. Bush in the . That made Reichert one of just 17 House Republicans elected in a district that also voted for the Democratic candidate for the presidency.

====Budget, debt, and spending====
Reichert was not present for the vote on then-House Budget Committee Chair Paul Ryan&#x27;s 2012 budget, which Ryan dubbed &quot;The Path to Prosperity&quot;; Reichert had intended to vote in favor of it, but was called away to Washington state following the death of his mother. However, he did vote for the Cut, Cap, and Balance Act and the Budget Control Act of 2011. Both acts required Congress to pass a balanced budget amendment prior to raising the United States debt ceiling. This was supported primarily by Republicans and opposed by Democrats. In the final vote to lift the debt ceiling, until 2013, he voted with the Republican majority in favor.

He has also made critical remarks towards transgender people, once responding to a question that asked what defines &quot;a woman&quot; saying that &quot;There’s only man and woman. I was raised with that as a Christian. And marriage is between a man and a woman.&quot; Reichert has also said that &quot;I don’t believe that transgender men should be competing against girls and women in sports.&quot;

<doc id="810188" wikidata="Q4716600" url="?curid=810188" title="Alex Alben">
<text>Alex Alben (born New York City), American technology executive, author and law professor, served as the first Chief Privacy Officer of Washington State from April 2015 to May 2019. His career spans work for innovative Internet media companies with influential positions in industry groups seeking to create new laws for digital distribution of content. Previously, he was a candidate for the United States House of Representatives in 2004, a campaign which drew national attention because of the high tech district and the media personalities involved in the race, as noted by media coverage in The New York Times, &quot;In a House Campaign With Personality, One Candidate Has the Microphone,&quot; June 12, 2004. He ran as a Democrat in the Eighth Congressional District of Washington. Alben is the author of &quot;Analog Days—How Technology Rewrote Our Future,&quot; and consults to public sector organizations, high tech and energy companies on privacy and security related matters. He is a Lecturer at the UCLA School of Law, teaching courses on Privacy, Cybersecurity and Internet Law. Artificial Intelligence, Antitrust and speech regulation on social media platforms are the focus of his current research and writing. He is a co-director of THEAIFORUM.ORG.


==Biography==
After graduating Stanford University in 1980, Alben began his career working for CBS News in New York as a research assistant to anchorman Walter Cronkite. He covered the 1980 Presidential campaign and the first Ronald Reagan inauguration. In 1981, Alben worked on the controversial CBS Reports Documentary, &quot;The Uncounted Enemy, A Vietnam Deception,&quot; which sparked a $100 Million libel suit between General William C. Westmoreland and CBS News. The suit settled in 1985, with no payment, but a statement from CBS that Westmoreland &quot;had done his duty as he saw fit.&quot; By this time, Alben had left CBS for Stanford Law School, where he graduated in 1984. Alben&#x27;s work at CBS and on &quot;The Uncounted Enemy&quot; documentary are cited in the Sam Adams biography, &quot;Who The Hell Are We Fighting?&quot; C. Michael Haim, Steerforth Press, 2006. Adams&#x27;s book, &quot;War of Numbers,&quot; posthumously published in 1994, was the basis for the documentary.


Alben participated in Stanford University&#x27;s undergraduate program in Arms Control in 1980 (A.B.) and received a J.D. from Stanford Law School in 1984. He worked for Senator Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode Island, on the Foreign Relations Committee and Senator John Culver, Democrat of Iowa, on the Armed Services Committee during the Senate&#x27;s consideration of the SALT II treaty.

Alben began work in 1985 as an entertainment lawyer for the Beverly Hills, CA, firm of Rosenfeld, Meyer &amp; Susman. He moved on to legal and business affairs for Orion Pictures and Warner Bros., before moving to the Seattle area in 1993.

Prior to running for Congress in 2004, Alben served as General Counsel and V.P. Business Affairs for Starwave Corporation and head of government affairs for RealNetworks. At Starwave, Alben worked on pioneering CD-ROM products and helped launch popular web sites such as ABCNews.com and ESPN.com. As a RealNetworks Vice President, Alben worked on the &quot;RealJukebox&quot; music management project, which contributed to the proliferation of MP3 music files, both legally and illegally disseminated across the Internet. On behalf of the technology industry, Alben testified before the U.S. Copyright Office, Senate Judiciary Committee and House Commerce Committee on the digital distribution of music and the importance of creating authorized channels for the distribution of Internet Radio and music downloads. In testimony before the Senate in 2002 as Vice President of public policy for RealNetworks, Alben predicted that web video was evolving so rapidly that one day all television programs would be found on the Internet.

Along with record label and high tech executives, he participated in the founding of the Secure Digital Music Initiative and the Digital Media Association. Alben&#x27;s work as an entertainment attorney and as counsel for Starwave are explored in the book, &quot;Free Culture,&quot; by Lawrence Lessig, Penguin Press, 2004, which describes Starwave&#x27;s efforts to license digital rights for products such as a CD-ROM based on the film career of Clint Eastwood.

Alben is the author of a comedy-spy novel, &quot;Our Man in Mongoa,&quot; published by Charles Scribner%27s Sons. Regarding &quot;Our Man in Mongoa&quot;, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;Alben writes smoothly, with terrific pace and even better humor, which, deliciously deadpan, skewers even moving targets.&quot; From 2005 to 2013, he has written opinion pieces about politics and media for &quot;The New York Times, Seattle Times and Seattle Post-Intelligencer.&quot; His initial editorial about his experience running for Congress, &quot;Real Candidates Have Curves,&quot; appeared in The New York Times, Opinion, September 27, 2004. Since 2009, he has written a guest editorial column on media, technology and politics for &quot;The Seattle Times.&quot;

Alben&#x27;s book, &quot;Analog Days-- How Technology Rewrote Our Future&quot; was published in 2012. Stanford Law Professor Paul Goldstein commented: &quot;In his new book, Alex Alben provides a first-person account of working at two of the pioneer companies that laid the groundwork for the modern web. His lively narrative covers the creation of ESPN.com and Starwave’s first-of-a-kind web services at a time when we were still rooted in the world of old media.&quot; He was selected in 2012 for the speaker roster for Humanities Washington. Alben&#x27;s book, &quot;Eliezer&#x27;s Train and Family Tales- Tales of the Alben and Winokoor Families in the Old and New Worlds,&quot; was published in 2022.

He is a graduate of Palisades High School.

==2004 Congressional campaign==
Alben ran a centrist campaign, according to &quot;September Primary A Necessary Vote,&quot; The Seattle Post Intelligencer, August 5, 2004, emphasizing his experience in the high tech world and his active participation in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and other issues affecting the software industry. Alben won the endorsement of the Seattle Times, the Seattle Post Intelligencer and the King County Journal. The Seattle Times, September 12, 2004, &quot;The Times Endorses . . .&quot; &quot;In The Northwest: Finding 8th District front-runner is no Dunn deal,&quot; By Joel Connelly, The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, August 23, 2004.

During the course of the campaign, Alben publicly criticized radio talk show host Dave Ross, for remaining on his daily radio program, &quot;The Dave Ross&quot; show while actively fund-raising and campaigning as a candidate for federal office. Alben claimed that Ross&#x27;s activity violated federal campaign finance law, according to the New York Times, in an article published June 12, 2004.

As guest columnist for The Seattle Times and contributor to other publications, Alben writes about issues confronting our culture as a result of new digital devices and applications. His most recent columns invoke &quot;&quot;nomophobia&quot;,&quot; the fear of losing a cell phone, the &quot;digital afterlife,&quot; and the influence of social media on American politics.

Alben is the son of advertising executive, Russ Alben and grand nephew of World War I hero, Bud Alben, for whom Alben Square in Brooklyn is named.

<doc id="810192" wikidata="Q7604647" url="?curid=810192" title="Statute of Frauds">
<text>The Statute of Frauds (29 Cha. 2. c. 3) (1677) is an act of the Parliament of England. In its original form it required that certain types of contracts, wills, and grants, and assignment or surrender of leases or interest in real property must be in writing and signed to avoid fraud on the court by perjury and the subornation of perjury. It also required that documents of the courts be signed and dated. Today it is mostly repealed; only section 4 remains, which is about guarantors.

==History==
The attested date for the enactment of the Statute of Frauds is 16 April 1677 (New Style). The act is believed to have been primarily drafted by Lord Nottingham assisted by Sir Matthew Hale, Sir Francis North and Sir Leoline Jenkins.

When the Statute of Frauds was originally enacted, its sections and the clauses within section 4 were not numbered. Numbers where added when the act was republished in the &quot;Statutes at Large&quot;. &quot;The Statute at Large&quot;, Cambridge Edition published in 1770 divided the act into 25 sections. The section on the sale of goods was section 17. In &quot;The Statutes of the Realm&quot; published in 1818, the Statute of Frauds was divided into 24 sections. The section on the sale of goods became section 16. This article uses the same numbering system as the Statutes of the Realm.

Almost all of the statute has been repealed, leaving a line of introductory text and an amended section 4. 

== Real property ==
Section 1 provides that all leases, estates, and interest in freehold or term of years created by livery and seisin or parole not in writing signed by the maker shall have the effect as an estate of lease at will.

Section 2 excepts from section 1 all leases not exceeding three years in term where rent equals two thirds of the value of the improved land.

Section 3 provides that all leases, estates, and interest in freehold or term of years assigned granted or surrendered must be by deed or note in writing signed by the grantor or his agent or by operation of law.

Section 7 provides that all conveyances in trusts of land must be in writing signed by the maker or by will.

Section 9 provides that all grants and assignments of trusts in land must be in writing signed by the grantor or by will.

Section 8 excepts from section 7 and 9 trusts that arise or result by implication of construction of law i.e. resulting trusts and constructive trusts.

Sections 1 to 3 and 7 to 9 and 24 were repealed by section 207 of, and Schedule 7 to, the Law of Property Act 1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5. c. 20). However section 53(1)(a) required that interest in land be created or disposed by a signed writing, a will or operation of law. Section 53(1)(b) requires a declaration of trust in land must be by a signed writing or a will and section 53(1)(c) requires the same disposition of equitable interests and existing trusts. Section 52(2) state that section 53 does not affect the creation or operation of implied, resulting or constructive trusts. Section 54 provides interests in land created by parol and not put in writing and signed have the force and effect of interests at will only except that the lease for 3 years or less at the best rent may be made by parol.

== Section 4 ==
Section 4 of the Statute of Frauds originally provided that an action may not be brought on the following types of contracts unless there is a written note or memorandum signed by the party being charged or a person authorized by them: 
# Contracts by the executor of a will to pay a debt of the estate with his own money.
# Contracts in which one party becomes a surety (acts as guarantor) for another party&#x27;s debt or other obligation. 
# Contracts in consideration of marriage.
# Contracts for the transfer of an interest in land.
# Contracts that cannot be performed within one year.

This section now provides that contracts of guarantee (surety for another&#x27;s debt) are unenforceable unless evidenced in writing. This requirement is subject to section 3 of the Mercantile Law Amendment Act 1856 (19 &amp; 20 Vict. c.. 97) which provides that the consideration for the guarantee need not appear in writing or by necessary inference from a written document.

Section 6 of the Statute of Frauds Amendment Act 1828 (9 Geo. 4. c. 14) (commonly known as Lord Tenterden&#x27;s Act) was enacted to prevent clause 2 section 4 being circumvented by bringing an action for the tort of deceit (the tort in &quot;Freeman v. Palsey&quot;).

In this section, the words &quot;or upon any contract or sale of lands, tenements or hereditaments or any interest in or concerning them&quot; were repealed by section 207 of, and Schedule 7 to, the Law of Property Act 1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5. c. 20). However the requirement that contract for sale of land must be in writing was continued by section 40 of that act. Section 40 of the Law of Property Act 1925 was repealed by sections 2(8) and 4 of, and Schedule 2 to, the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989; however, section 2 of that act requires that contracts for the sale of land be signed and in writing.

All the clauses except the one relating to surety contracts were repealed by section 1 of the Law Reform (Enforcement of Contracts) Act 1954 (2 &amp; 3 Eliz. 2. c. 34).

This section does not apply (if it would otherwise do so) in relation to a financial collateral arrangement.

In 1937, the Law Revision Committee recommended that this section be repealed.

== Court procedure==
Sections 10 and 11 dealt with the execution of judgments upon equitable interests of &quot;cestui que&quot; trust in land and held free from the incumbrances of the persons seized in trust.

Section 13 and 14 provide that the effective date for judgments against &quot;bona fide&quot; purchasers for value of land is the date they are docketed and requiring that judgments of the courts enter the date docketed when signing it without a fee.

Section 15 provided that &quot;fieri facias&quot; or other writs of execution are effective against goods from the date given it is given to the sheriff and the sheriff shall write on the back of it the day, month and year he received it without a fee.
Section 17 provided that recognisances shall bind &quot;bona fide&quot; purchasers for value of land from the time they are enrolled and requiring that the day month and year of the recognisance be entered on the roll without a fee.

Section 23 preserved the jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts to probate wills in personal property subject to the rules of this statute. Court of Probate Act 1857 (20 &amp; 21 Vict. c. 77) transferred responsibility for the granting of probate from the ecclesiastical courts of England and Wales to a new civil Court of Probate in January 1858.

Section 24 provided that the husband may be the administrator of the intestate estate of a married woman as before the Statute of Distribution (22 &amp; 23 Cha. 2. c. 10).

Sections 13 and 14 were repealed by Part I of the Schedule to the Civil Procedure Acts Repeal Act 1879 (42 &amp; 43 Vict. c 59).

Sections 15 was repealed by the Schedule to the Sale of Goods Act 1893, but section 26 that act continued the requirement that &quot;fieri facias&quot; or other writs of execution are effective against goods from when they are given to the sheriff and the sheriff shall endorse the writ with the date and time he received it.

Section 17 was repealed by the Schedule to the Statute Law Revision and Civil Procedure Act 1881 (44 &amp; 45 Vict. c. 59).

Sections 10 and 11 and 23 and 24, so far as unrepealed, were repealed by section 56 of, and Part I of Schedule 2 to the Administration of Estates Act 1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5. c. 23). Section 24 was also repealed by section 207 of, and Schedule 7 to, the Law of Property Act 1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5. c. 20).

== Section 16: Sales of goods ==
Section 16 provided that no contract for the sale of goods for the price of ten pounds sterling or more shall be good except if the buyer shall accept part of the goods and actually receive the same or give some thing in earnest to bind the bargain or in part of payment, or that some note or memorandum in writing of the said contract signed by the parties to be charged by such contract or their authorized agents. This section was amended by section 7 of the Statute of Frauds Amendment Act 1828 (9 Geo. 4. c. 14) to cover goods to be delivered in the future, not yet manufactured, or not yet fit for delivery.

Sections 15 and 16 was repealed by the schedule to the Sale of Goods Act 1893 (56 &amp; 57 Vict. c. 71), although section 16 was substantially re-enacted as section 4 of the 1893 act.

Section 4 of the Sales of Goods Act 1893 was itself repealed by section 2 of the Law Reform (Enforcement of Contracts) Act 1954.

==Wills==

Section 5 requires that wills devising land be in writing signed by the person devising the property or some other person at his direction, and shall be attested and subscribed in the presence of the said testator by three or four credible witnesses.

Section 6 provides that a gift of land in a will may only be revoked by another will or a codicil or other writing declaring the revocation executed in the same manner as a will is by section 5 or by testator or someone at his direction and in his presence burned, cancelled, torn or obliterated.

Section 1 of the Wills Act 1751 (25 Geo. 2. c. 6) provides that any gift in a will to person witnessing a will is void to the extent his testimony and he is a valid witness to the execution of the will under the Statute of Frauds. Section 2 provides if there gift is a charge on land to pay debts to the witness then the charge stands and the witness is admitted.

Section 12 provides that an estate &quot;pur autre vie&quot; may devised by will in writing signed by the testator or someone in his presence and at his express direction, attested and subscribed in the testators presence by three of more witnesses. It also provides for estate &quot;pur autre vie&quot; in cases where no devise is made.

Sections 18 through 20 provide rules for nuncupative (oral) wills for personal estates valued at over 30 pounds may be only made during the last illness of a testator. After six months have passed from the speaking of the will no testimony shall be received to prove a nuncupative will unless the testimony of the substance of it was committed to writing within six days of making the will. A nuncuparative will must be witnessed by three witnesses.

Section 16 of the Administration of Justice Act 1705 (4 &amp; 5 Ann. c. 3) provided that any witness who could testify in court could witness a nuncuparative will.

Section 21 provides that a written will in personal property may not be repealed or altered orally except if it is put in writing during the life of the testator and read to him and allowed by him and proven by at least three witnesses.

Section 22 allows soldiers in actual military service and seamen at sea to dispose of their personal property as they might have done before the passage of this act.

So much of this act as related to devises or bequests of lands or tenements, or to the revocation or alteration of any devise in writing of any lands, tenements or hereditaments, or any clause thereof, or to the devise of any estate &quot;pur autre vie&quot;, or to any such estate being assets, or to nuncupative wills, or to the repeal, altering or changing of any will in writing concerning any goods or chattels or personal estate, or any clause, devise, or bequest therein was repealed by section 2 of the Wills Act 1837 (7 Will. 4 &amp; 1 Vict. c. 26). The marginal note to that section said that the effect of this was to repeal sections 5 and 6 and 12 and 19 to 22. Legislation.gov.uk has this as sections 18 to 21 instead of 19 to 22.

Section 22 was repealed by Part VII of the Schedule to the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1969 (c. 52). However section 11 of the Wills Act 1837 continues the right of Soldiers and Seamen to dispose of their personal estate as they had previously.

<doc id="810198" wikidata="Q1640519" url="?curid=810198" title="Lake Tharthar">
<text>Lake Tharthar (also Therthar), and known in Iraq as Buhayrat ath-Tharthar (), is an artificial lake created in 1956, situated 100 kilometers (62 mi) northwest of Baghdad between the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers.

==History==
In 1956, the southern part of the Tharthar depression was turned into an artificial reservoir to collect floodwaters of the Tigris River. The water flows via an artificial inlet canal, named Tharthar Canal. The canal diverts the excess water, by means of a regulator, Samarra Barrage. It merges with the lake in its southeastern bank.

The lake has an artificial outlet called Taksim Tharthar Canal, which drains to the Euphrates River directly. The canal, after 28 km (17.4 mi) from its outlet, bifurcates to another canal called &quot;Dhira&#x27;a Dijla&quot; (Arm of Tigris) that returns water back to the Tigris River.
Lake Tharthar was the site of an American raid in 2005 against an insurgent training base in the region.

==Description==
The Tharthar depression was formed during the Holocene age, mainly by karstification, due to dissolving of gypsum rocks of the Fatha Formation nearby. Tharthar covers roughly and flows from the central and eastern parts of the Sinjar Mountains and adjacent hills, with a floor of –3m above sea level. The maximum length and width of the depression are 120 and 48 km, respectively. The eastern rim of the depression is higher than the western one; the heights of both rims are and , respectively.

The main purpose of the Tharthar Lake is to collect excess water of the Tigris River during flood seasons and to recharge water to the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers during dry seasons, when there is shortage of water in both rivers. Moreover, it aims to wash out the salts from the stored water in the lake by means of natural continuous draining of the stored water.

==Flora and fauna==
Tharthar Lake and the surrounding areas are considered one of the most important grazing areas in Iraq, including the wide wheat and corn fields covering the area. The area harbors many species of animals and vegetation.

===Birds===
Tharthar Lake is considered the main wintering grounds for many threatened species of migrant birds such as saker falcon, MacQueen&#x27;s bustard, and sociable lapwing. 54 bird species were seen in Tharthar lake including: pallid harrier, European roller, and black-tailed godwit. All these near threatened species were recorded on passage and the endemic race of hooded crow [&quot;Corvus cornix capellanus&quot;] was present.

===Mammals===
Golden jackals have been observed regularly at the site. Striped hyenas and caracals were reported by local people near the lake edge.

===Reptiles===
Many species of reptiles have been observed such as Turkish gecko and Egyptian spiny-tailed lizard.

===Fish===
Ten fish species have been found in the lake including: &quot;Aspius vorax&quot;, &quot;yellowfin barbel&quot;, &quot;B. luteus&quot;, &quot;B. sharpeyi&quot;, &quot;goldfish&quot; , &quot;Cyprnion kais&quot;, &quot;common carp&quot;, &quot;Silurus triostegus&quot;, &quot;Chondrostoma regium&quot;, and &quot;Liza abu&quot;.

===Plants===

Tharthar Lake and the surrounding area contains about 38 species of plants. Four main habitat types observed within the Al-Tharthar Lake and Al Dhebaeji Field area:
*Inland standing water: aquatic communities – rooted submerged vegetation, characterized by &quot;Vallisneria spiralis&quot;, &quot;Potamogeton crispus&quot; and &quot;Potamogeton perfoliatus&quot;.
*Flooded communities: periodically or occasionally flooded land dominated by &quot;Cyperus&quot; sp., &quot;Rumex dentatus&quot;, &quot;Polygonum argyrocoleon&quot;, &quot;Polygonum&quot; sp. and &quot;Bacopa monnieri&quot;.
*Marsh vegetation: helophytic vegetation - reedbeds, characterized by &quot;Phragmites australis&quot;.
*Terrestrial vegetation: desert shrub characterized by &quot;Tamarix&quot; sp., &quot;Alhagi maurorum&quot;, &quot;Atraplex leucoclada&quot; and &quot;Cornulaca aucheri&quot;.

<text>Summer of Night is the first in a series of horror novels by American writer Dan Simmons, published in 1991 by Warner Aspect. It was nominated for a British Fantasy Award in 1992. The subsequent books are &quot;Children of the Night&quot; (1992), &quot;Fires of Eden&quot; (1994) and &quot;A Winter Haunting&quot; (2002).

==Plot summary==

Set in Elm Haven, Illinois, in 1960, &quot;Summer of Night&quot; recounts its five pre-teen protagonists&#x27; discovery that eerie, terrifying events are unfolding in the Old Central School. Operatives, including a dead soldier; giant worms with rows of sharp, serrated teeth; the animated corpse of a deceased teacher; schoolyard bullies; the driver of a rendering truck; their school teacher, and the principal of the school, serve a centuries-old evil that seeks to be reborn in their time — and in their town. It is only by banding together that the pre-teens can hope to defeat the monstrosity before it destroys them, their friends, their families — and, possibly, the world.

The sequel to &quot;Summer of Night&quot; is &quot;A Winter Haunting&quot;, in which Dale Stewart, now grown, returns to Elm Haven. Another sequel is &quot;Children of the Night,&quot; which features Mike O&#x27;Rourke, now a Roman Catholic priest, who is sent on a mission to investigate bizarre events in a European city. Another &quot;Summer of Night&quot; character, Dale&#x27;s younger brother, Lawrence Stewart, appears as a minor character in Simmons&#x27; thriller &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Blade&quot;, while the adult Cordie Cooke appears in &quot;Fires of Eden.&quot;

==Source materials==

On his website, Simmons implies that his younger brother Wayne is the real-life model for the character Lawrence (&quot;Larry&quot;) Stewart, as he himself is the model for Dale, as they were as boys in 1960 Elm Haven, Illinois. The brothers&#x27; friends, as they were as boys in the same year, are the models for other characters: Mike O&#x27;Toole and Jim Hatten, for Mike O&#x27;Rourke and Jim Harlen, respectively, and Kevin Hasselbacher, for Kevin Grumbacher. Simmons states that Brimfield, Illinois, where he lived for part of his childhood, is the source of his fictional &#x27;Elm Haven&#x27;. The novel&#x27;s Old Central School is based upon Brimfield School, which was torn down in 1960. Some of the incidents in the novel, such as the free show and the fair, are also based upon similar events that took place in Brimfield during Simmons&#x27; boyhood.

<text>Warm Lake is a lake in Idaho, United States. It is located east of Cascade in Valley County, at above sea level. It is the largest natural lake in Boise National Forest.

The lake&#x27;s abundance of wildlife makes it very popular for camping, fishing, and hunting. Large mammals present in the area include moose, mule deer, black bear, and elk. Large birds present in the area include bald eagles and osprey. The lake contains rainbow, brook, lake, and bull trout as well as mountain whitefish and Kokanee salmon.

There are two lodges at the lake, North Shore Lodge, which was established in 1936, and Warm Lake Lodge, which was established in 1911. The Forest Service operates three campgrounds around the lake.

<text>Rhopalia (singular: rhopalium) from Ancient Greek ῥόπαλον (&quot;rhópalon&quot;) &#x27;club&#x27; are small sensory structures of certain Scyphozoan (true jellyfish) and Cubozoan (box jellyfish) species. 

==Description==
The structures typically occur in multiples of four, are bell shaped and face outward from invaginations around the bell of the jelly&#x27;s mantle. They are each connected ectodermally to the periphery of other rhopalia by a stalk-like projections which join extremities in a skirt-like shape. These connections form the junctions of the cnidarian &#x27;central nervous system&#x27;, which synapse within the rhopalial centers. Rhopalia vary in form, size and number, but ubiquitously consist of specialized structures to sense light (ocelli), which line the structure, and regions to perceive gravity (statoliths) at their terminal tip. Rhopalia are unique to the medusoid forms of Cnidarians and are best studied in Scyphozoa&quot;,&quot; within the genus &quot;Aurelia,&quot; which exhibits the most typical arrangement and structure of rhopalia in marginal indentations around the skirt of the bell which are flanked by rhopalial lappets. However, studies about the organ in Cubozoa, which exhibit the most complex rhopalial structure and visual sensory mechanisms, have been few, but are coming to reveal more detail about the mechanisms and origins of these structures. Sensory input from rhopalia are not only crucial for Cnidaria to sense light and spatial orientation, but help to gauge and control the pace of swimming and muscle contraction. In continuing to increase the breadth and depth of scientific knowledge about the origins of rhopalia and how they manifest during the process of metamorphosis is crucial to understanding sensory evolution in all metazoa, and could contribute to the progression of knowledge about the beginnings of nervous system evolution.

== Morphology and function ==

Studies observing the genus &quot;Aurelia&quot; indicate that development of their rhopalial nervous system occurs in an organized, staged manner beginning in the strobila phase and results in bilaterally symmetrical organization of the organs and the stalk-like projections that connect them inwardly. Rhopalia uniformly manifest in multiples of four, regardless of their variations in morphology among the species that possess them. Each rhopalium is capped by a lithocyst, or statocyst, at the terminal end, which is known to sense gravitational change and orientation. On the oral side of the rhopalium near the lithocyst is a mass of sensory cells called the &quot;pigment-cup ocellus&quot;, while on the aboral side, there is a “pigment-spot ocellus” just proximal to the lithocyst, formed by a patch of pigment cells. In tandem with a “touch plate” which is situated near the spot-ocellus, tilt and gravity during the jellies&#x27; movements pulls downward on the dense lithocyst, which bends the entire rhopalial body such that the cells of the touch plate are either distant from or making contact with the lithocyst hood; this physical mechanism is how the rhopalia deduct sensory information into gravity-sensate behavioral responses

As cnidarians lack centralized ganglia and cephalization, the centralization of sensory mechanisms divided up among connections within the rhopalial centers is the nearest concept to a brain that we can place within the phylum. While rhopalia are minute and separated by number and distance across the body, they are extraordinary in the variability of sensory cells they possess in such small areas of tissue. The RNS (rhopalial nervous system) consists of roughly 1000 neurons, excluding photoreceptive cells, and possesses a neuropil, a tightly bundled cluster of cells at its center, serving as the junctions of synapse between adjacent rhopalia. In its totality, the rhopalial nervous system is involved in deduction of the sensation of light (the complexity of which approaches visual processing in some species) and in spatial-behavioral control; because the sensory cells of both sight and physical touch are located within such proximity, studies have explored how related and potentially integral these two mechanisms are to one another in terms of cnidarian behavior. It has thus been observed that the rate of muscle contraction and swimming speed increases when adult &quot;Aurelia&quot; medusae are exposed to higher levels of light. Additionally that this positive phototactic behavior is absent when the same conditions are presented to jellies whose pigment-cup ocelli have removed (but not the spot-ocellus), insinuating that the pigment-cup ocellus on the oral side is primarily photosensory yet intrinsically related to normal functional behavior 

In recent years, it has been found that rhopalia retain a sizable reservoir of undifferentiated, stem-like cells, which are thought to be poised for potential use in both cell turnover and regeneration in the rhopalia.

== Formation during metamorphosis ==
Rhopalia are exclusive to the medusoid form of the cnidarian life cycle; young jellies within the classes Schyphozoa and Cubozoa develop through their planula larval and polyp stages lacking these structures. This indicates not only that jellies must employ different sensory mechanisms than those offered by rhopalia before entering the medusa stage, but that the formation of these complex structures takes place completely within the stages of adult strobilation and not during gastrulation. In most schyphozoa and cubozoa, sessile polyps undergo a secondary round of metamorphosis in order to become free-swimming, sexually mature medusae, generally entailing a process known as strobilation. During strobliation, a single polyp, which is now dubbed a Strobila, is set to undergo a process of transverse fission, which will result in the generation of one or multiple juvenile medusae, consequently referred to as ephyrae. Each free-swimming ephyra (singular) develops into an adult medusa, which has come to possess a rhopalial nervous system that it did not previously possess.

When the process of strobilation is at its genesis, before rhopalia begin their formation, small swellings manifest at the bases of specific tentacles in the polyp; these will become the sites of rhopalial development. The tentacles degenerate in length, and the margins of the swellings bulge out to form “rhopalar arms”. The rhopalial arm&#x27;s distal end, formations called lappets begin to form, which are used for sensing and consuming food. Before ephyrae detach from the strobila, electrical impulses from the rhopalia have been observed in direct correspondence with pulsatile contractions of movement that begin when the ephyrae are becoming ready to be free-swimmers. This suggests that the sum of the connections that synapse within the rhopalia, along with the swimming musculature, all develop during the strobila stage. Observations point to the conclusion that the gravity-sensing portion of the organ consisting of the lithocyst and the touch plate most likely develops first, preceding the neuropil cluster within the center of the rhopalia, and then finally the ocelli, which exhibit the highest degree of cellular complexity and require the most energy to develop.

== Phylogenetic variations/manifestations in Cubozoa ==
Cubozoa rhoplaial structures and ocelli are the most complex of Cnidarians, and resemble the image-forming eyes of squids, octopuses and vertebrates. They possess rhopalia that are structurally similar to those of the scyphozoans, but the variation of cell types and specifically ocelli are more complex within Cubozoa. Cubozoan rhopalia also occur in multiples of four, where at least one rhopalia is embedded within the skirt of each side of the box jelly. Each rhopalial organ is lined with six total eyes of four varying morphological types. On each, there are two lens eyes, the upper and lower eye, accompanied by two different pairs of simpler pigment-pit eyes, summing to a total of 24 eyes per organism.

== Rhopalial ocelli and regeneration ==
Ocelli (the plural of ocellus) are a type of simple eye, or eyespot. They are photoreceptive, but very simple; differing from complex eyes with compound lenses, ocelli cannot morph the sensation of light into a complete image, and are utilized to sense movement and the absence and presence of light. Cnidarians are the most primitive extant animals that possess these simple eyespots; however, they exhibit an extremely wide range of phototactic behavior that ranges in complexity alongside the variation in ocelli. &quot;Cubozoa&quot; rhoplaial structures and their various types of ocelli are the most complex within the Cnidarian phyla, and resemble the advanced image-forming eyes of squids, octopuses and vertebrates.

It has been observed that the removal of some of the rhopalia in the species Aurelia results in a period of two weeks to complete regrowth, with only subtle loss of size and pigmentation but virtually identical function. Even the organ&#x27;s ocelli, of both types, are capable of being fully regenerated as long as at least two rhopalia are left intact prior to amputation of the others. This exhibits that parts of the nervous system that would be considered precious and vital by most other living things can be regenerated in scyphozoan medusae . However, this has not been tested in cubozoans, which have the most elaborate nervous systems within Cnidaria, specifically concerning their visual capacities.

<text>L&#x27;Inflexible (S 615) was the sixth and final of the SNLE (&quot;Sous-marin Nucléaire Lanceur d&#x27;Engins&quot;, &quot;Nuclear Missile-Launching Submarine&quot;) of the Force océanique stratégique (FOST), the submarine nuclear deterrent component of the French Navy.

Construction began on 27 March 1980. The boat was launched on 23 June 1982, commissioned on 1 April 1985 and decommissioned on 14 January 2008.

==Design and construction==
&quot;L&#x27;Inflexible&quot; uses basically the same design as the other &quot;Redoutable&quot;-class vessels, but has benefited from technological advances over its predecessors. The submarine uses the M4 missile, which carries 6 independent 150 kilotonnes of TNT equivalent nuclear warheads. Their range is reported to be over . The boat also has the capability of launching the SM39 Exocet anti-ship missile.

&quot;L&#x27;Inflexible&quot; received TIT (&quot;Traitement de l&#x27;Information Tactique&quot;, &quot;Tactical Information Processor&quot;), a cluster of French-designed computers and serial digital bus links for intersystem communication and DMUX21 sonar. The submarine has an improved inertial navigation system over other vessels of the class. The boat also has the improved internal communication system—SNTI, &quot;Système Numérisé de Transmissions Intérieures&quot; (Digital Internal Communication System).

Other miscellaneous improvements were made in electrical systems, nuclear systems, improving safety and stealth and rudder and engines, improving reliability and stealth. &quot;Inflexible has an improved hull profile.&quot;

The other &quot;Redoutable&quot;-class submarines have been modified to meet the standards of &quot;L&#x27;Inflexible&quot; (&quot;Refonte M4&quot;). &quot;L&#x27;Inflexible&quot; was officially decommissioned on 14 January 2008.

== In popular culture ==

&quot;L&#x27;Inflexible&quot; has inspired &quot;Le Soleil ne se lève pas pour nous&quot; (&quot;No sunrise for us&quot;) by Robert Merle, a 1987 semi-fictitious book in form of a romanced documentary.

<doc id="810246" wikidata="Q6933911" url="?curid=810246" title="Mulek">
<text>Mulek (), according to the Book of Mormon, was the only surviving son of Zedekiah, the last King of Judah, after the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem. The Book of Mormon states that after escaping from Judah, Mulek traveled to the Americas and established a civilization there.

The word &quot;Mulekite&quot;, after Mulek, is commonly used to refer to his group. It is one of four groups (the others being the Nephites, the Lamanites, and the Jaredites) described in the Book of Mormon as having settled in the ancient Americas, although the name &quot;Mulekites&quot; does not appear in the Book of Mormon itself. Archaeological evidence for the existence of any of these groups has not been documented.

==Mulek and his nation==
According to the Book of Mormon, when Jerusalem was destroyed by Babylon, during the reign of Zedekiah, all of the sons of Zedekiah were killed except Mulek. Along with &quot;as many as would hearken unto the voice of the Lord,&quot; Mulek escaped into the wilderness, traveled &quot;across the great waters&quot; to the Americas, and founded a new nation. The people of Mulek established their capital at Zarahemla, north of where Lehi and his people landed.

==Encounter with Jaredites==

The last surviving Jaredite, Coriantumr, encountered the Mulekites, who he lived with for several months before he died.

==Encounter with Nephites==
When the Nephites were commanded to leave their historic homeland of Lehi-Nephi to flee from the Lamanites, the exiled remnants discovered the city of Zarahemla, to their north. The Book of Mormon records that the Mulekites spoke a language that was largely unintelligible to the Nephites. When taught the Nephite language, the Mulekites recounted their descent from Mulek, which was then recorded.

The Mulekites had in their possession a stone that told the story of Coriantumr, a survivor of the Jaredites who had encountered the Mulekites and lived among them until his death. Much of the prior Mulekite history was lost because of their lack of records.

<doc id="810250" wikidata="Q3503302" url="?curid=810250" title="Periodic sequence">
<text>In mathematics, a periodic sequence (sometimes called a cycle or orbit) is a sequence for which the same terms are repeated over and over:

:&quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, ..., &quot;a&quot;&quot;p&quot;,  &quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, ..., &quot;a&quot;&quot;p&quot;,  &quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, ..., &quot;a&quot;&quot;p&quot;, ...

The number &quot;p&quot; of repeated terms is called the period (period).

==Definition==
A (purely) periodic sequence (with period &quot;p), or a p-&quot;periodic sequence, is a sequence &quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, &quot;a&quot;3, ... satisfying

:&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;+&quot;p&quot; = &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;
for all values of &quot;n&quot;. If a sequence is regarded as a function whose domain is the set of natural numbers, then a periodic sequence is simply a special type of periodic function. The smallest &quot;p&quot; for which a periodic sequence is &quot;p&quot;-periodic is called its least period or exact period.

==Examples==
Every constant function is 1-periodic.

The sequence formula_1 is periodic with least period 2.

The sequence of digits in the decimal expansion of 1/7 is periodic with period 6:

:formula_2

More generally, the sequence of digits in the decimal expansion of any rational number is eventually periodic (see below).

The sequence of powers of −1 is periodic with period two:

:formula_3

More generally, the sequence of powers of any root of unity is periodic. The same holds true for the powers of any element of finite order in a group.

A periodic point for a function is a point whose orbit

:formula_4

is a periodic sequence. Here, formula_5 means the composition of applied to . Periodic points are important in the theory of dynamical systems. Every function from a finite set to itself has a periodic point; cycle detection is the algorithmic problem of finding such a point.

==Partial sums and products ==
:formula_6, 

where formula_7 and formula_8 are positive integers.

==Periodic 0, 1 sequences==

Any periodic sequence can be constructed by element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of periodic sequences consisting of zeros and ones. Periodic zero and one sequences can be expressed as sums of trigonometric functions:

:formula_9

:formula_10

:formula_11

:formula_12

:formula_13

One standard approach for proving these identities is to apply De Moivre&#x27;s formula to the corresponding root of unity. Such sequences are foundational in the study of number theory.

==Generalizations==
A sequence is eventually periodic or ultimately periodic if it can be made periodic by dropping some finite number of terms from the beginning. Equivalently, the last condition can be stated as formula_14 for some &quot;r&quot; and sufficiently large &quot;k&quot;. For example, the sequence of digits in the decimal expansion of 1/56 is eventually periodic:

: 1 / 56 = 0 . 0 1 7  8 5 7 1 4 2  8 5 7 1 4 2  8 5 7 1 4 2  ...

A sequence is asymptotically periodic if its terms approach those of a periodic sequence. That is, the sequence &quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, &quot;x&quot;3, ... is asymptotically periodic if there exists a periodic sequence &quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, &quot;a&quot;3, ... for which

:formula_15

For example, the sequence

:1 / 3,  2 / 3,  1 / 4,  3 / 4,  1 / 5,  4 / 5,  ...

is asymptotically periodic, since its terms approach those of the periodic sequence 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, ...

<text>Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport is an international airport serving Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.

The airport codes were inherited from the former Baiyun Airport, and the IATA code is derived from Guangzhou&#x27;s historical romanization &quot;Canton&quot;. Baiyun Airport serves as a hub for China Southern Airlines, FedEx Express, 9 Air, Hainan Airlines and Shenzhen Airlines. In 2020, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation in other countries, it was temporarily the world&#x27;s busiest airport by passenger traffic, handling 43.8 million passengers.

In 2023, Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport was the world&#x27;s twelfth-busiest airport by passenger traffic, with 63.1 million passengers handled, and the busiest in China. As for cargo traffic, the airport was China&#x27;s second-busiest and the world&#x27;s eleventh-busiest.

==Overview==
===1932–2004===
The old Baiyun Airport opened in 1932. Due to the expansion of Guangzhou, the airport could not expand to meet passengers needs as buildings and mountains surrounded the airport. On 5 August 2004, the new Baiyun Airport opened and the old airport was closed.

===Since 2004===
The current airport is located in the outskirts of Guangzhou&#x27;s Baiyun District and Huadu and opened on 5 August 2004 as a replacement for the 72-year-old, identically named former airport, which is now closed. Built at a cost of 19.8 billion yuan, the new airport is north of downtown Guangzhou and nearly five times larger than its predecessor. &quot;Baiyun&quot; () means &quot;white cloud&quot; in Chinese and refers to the Baiyun Mountain (&quot;Baiyunshan&quot;), near the former airport even though the mountain is much closer to downtown Guangzhou than it is to the new airport. It is also referred to as &quot;New Baiyun&quot; to distinguish it from the previous airport, but this is not a part of the official name.

Former curfews and restrictions did not apply to the new airport, so it could operate 24 hours a day, allowing China Southern Airlines to maximise intercontinental route utilisation with overnight flights. Other airlines also benefit from the removal of previous restrictions.

==Facilities==

===Terminal 1===
Terminal 1 has three components, Main Terminal, Area A and Area B. All check-in counters and most retail stores are placed at the Main Terminal. The two concourses controlled by individual security checkpoints, named Area A and Area B, are the boarding gates, security checkpoints, border control, customs and quarantine, baggage reclaim and relative facilities.

Since 24 January 2016, East Piers 1 and 2 are dedicated to serve international flights; domestic flights occupy the rest.

===Terminal 2===
Terminal 2 opened on 26 April 2018, with an area measuring over 808,700 square metres, making it one of the world&#x27;s largest airport terminal facilities. Terminal 2 is the main hub of China Southern Airlines, while also housing airlines such as China Airlines, Korean Air, Vietnam Airlines, Garuda Indonesia, Saudia, Thai Airways International, Sichuan Airlines, Aeroflot, Egyptair, Singapore Airlines, AirAsia, Qatar Airways, Kenya Airways, Japan Airlines, All Nippon Airways, Asiana Airlines, Air Tanzania, Cathay Pacific, and more. Most SkyTeam and few Star Alliance member airlines will also typically operate in Terminal 2.

The new transport centre (GTC) is under construction on the south side of terminal 2; passengers will be able to go to Guangzhou downtown by taking metro, rail, bus or taxi there.

===FedEx Asia-Pacific hub===
On 13 July 2005, FedEx Express signed a contract with the airport authority to relocate its Asia-Pacific hub from Subic Bay International Airport in the Philippines to Baiyun Airport. The new Asia-Pacific hub covers an area of approximate , with a total floor space of . At the beginning of operation, the hub employed more than 800 people and operated 136 flights a week, providing delivery services among 20 major cities in Asia and linking these cities to more than 220 countries and territories in the world. The Guangzhou hub was, at the time of the opening, the largest FedEx hub outside the United States, but it was later surpassed by the expanded hub at Paris&#x27; Charles de Gaulle Airport.

The hub has its own ramp control tower, a first for an international air express cargo company facility in China, which enables FedEx to control aircraft movements on the ground, aircraft parking plans as well as loading and unloading priorities. Included at the hub are a unique package and sorting system with 16 high-speed sorting lines, seven round-out conveyor belts and 90 primary and secondary document-sorting splits. With the new advanced system, up to 24,000 packages can be sorted an hour at the start of operations.

Construction began in 2006 and the hub was originally scheduled to open on 26 December 2008. On 17 November 2008, after several months of testing, FedEx announced that the opening date was delayed to the first half of 2009 when the hub was expected to be fully operational. FedEx claimed that the revised operation date &quot;provided FedEx with the necessary time to fully test all systems and processes, as well as work closely with the Guangzhou authorities to ensure all necessary approvals are in place&quot;.

On 17 December 2008, the hub completed its first flight operations test. A FedEx MD-11 aircraft took off from Subic Bay International Airport in the Philippines and landed at Baiyun Airport at 05:50 local time. The flight was handled by the new FedEx hub team, using the FedEx ramp control tower and the new 24,000 package per hour sort system. Following a successful operations&#x27; process, the flight departed on time for its final destination at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, France. This Asia-Europe flight route operated four times per week during test run. FedEx also announced that the hub would start operation on 6 February 2009.

FedEx closed its 13-year-old Asia-Pacific hub at Subic Bay of northern Philippines on 6 February 2009, with the last flight leaving for Taiwan just before dawn, while hub operations have moved to Baiyun Airport. The first flight that arrived at the new FedEx Asia-Pacific hub originated from Indianapolis International Airport. The MD-11 aircraft landed at 23:07 local time at Baiyun International Airport from Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, marking the opening and full operations of the new Asia-Pacific hub.

===Runways===
Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport now has four runways. 

The third runway opened on 5 February 2015, which temporarily tackled the long‐standing capacity obstacle. The operation of the third runway expanded Baiyun Airport&#x27;s capacity, pushing business up. Unfortunately, the third runway can only be used for landing, as its airspace conflicts with Foshan Shadi Airport. The airport is planning to build two additional runways.

The fourth runway 01L/19R opened on January 23, 2025, makes Guangzhou Baiyun Airport the fourth airport to have a four-runway system in China after Shanghai-Pudong, Beijing-Daxing and Chongqing-Jiangbei. The current third runway 01/19 will be renamed 01R/19L.

The four-runway system will normally be operating as follows:

* Inner runways 01R/19L and 02L/20R for take off only.
* Outer runways 01L/19R and 02R/20L for landing only.

==Expansion==
In August 2008, the airport&#x27;s expansion plan was approved by the National Development and Reform Commission.

It included a third runway, in length and in width, located to the east of the existing east runway. The centrepiece of the project is a Terminal 2. Other facilities comprise new indoor and outdoor car parks and a transportation centre with metro and inter-city train services. The total cost of the entire project was estimated to be around ¥18.854 billion. Construction of the third runway began in 2012 and the runway commenced operation in early 2015. The whole project including the new terminal was scheduled to be finished in February 2018, at which time the airport will be able to handle 80 million passengers and 2.5 million tonnes of cargo a year.

The third phase expansion plan has been approved by the National Development and Reform Commission of China. After the expansion, Baiyun Airport will have three terminals, a satellite concourse, five runways and a high-speed railway station serving 3 intercity railways. The airport will be able to handle 120 million passengers, 3.8 million tons freight and 775,000 aircraft movements a year. The whole expansion project is estimated to be finished in 2025.

==History==

Bar began as a small trade outpost known as Rov, within the Duchy of Podolia in the 13th century. Rov was noted for the first time in 1401. In 1537, the Polish Queen Bona Sforza renamed the settlement &quot;Bar&quot;, after her hometown of Bari, Italy. Bar&#x27;s highest mountain was renamed after Queen Sforza in 2018 to commemorate her role in naming the town. In 1540, King Sigismund I the Old of Poland granted the nearby town city rights.

In the 1630s, Guillaume Le Vasseur de Beauplan built a fortress in Bar and made note of the town his book &quot;Description d&#x27;Ukranie&quot;. The Bar fortress was besieged several times in its history. In 1648, during the Khmelnytsky Uprising, the fortress was captured by the Cossacks led by Maxym Kryvonis and was severely damaged.

Bar as a town was described by a number of travelers and historians, including Guillaume Le Vasseur de Beauplan in 1650, Evliya Çelebi in 1656, and Ulrich von Werdum in August 1671.

In 1672, Bar was captured by the Ottoman Empire and became a seat of the sanjak in Podolia Eyalet with nahiyas of Bar, Dırajna, Zinkuv and Popovçi. On November 12, 1674, the town and the fortress were liberated by John III of Poland after a four-day siege. However, the Ottomans would then recapture the city in 1675 and hold it until 1686, with nominal control through 1699.

On February 29, 1768, the Bar Confederation, an alliance of Polish nobles, was founded by Adam Krasiński, Bishop of Kamenets, Karol Stanisław Radziwiłł, Casimir Pulaski, Moritz Benyowszki and Michał Krasiński within the Bar fortress. After the Second Partition of Poland, the town was ceded to the Russian Empire and made part of the Podolia Governorate.

After 1922, Bar became part of Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic within the Soviet Union. In 1991, following the fall of the Soviet Union, the town became part of the independent Ukraine.

The town had a historical Jewish population, with 3,869 Jews within the city in 1939. On July 16, 1941, during World War II, Nazi Germany occupied the town and established ghettos, killing many of Bar&#x27;s Jewish residents. In 1999, there was an estimated Jewish population of 199.
