<text>Herbert Jefferis Pennock (February 10, 1894 – January 30, 1948) was an American professional baseball pitcher and front-office executive. He played in Major League Baseball from 1912 through 1933, and is best known for his time spent with the star-studded New York Yankee teams of the mid to late 1920s and early 1930s.

Pennock was signed by the Philadelphia Athletics in 1912, but was used sparingly by the Athletics and the Boston Red Sox, who bought his contract in 1915. After returning from military service in 1919, Pennock became a regular contributor for the Red Sox. The Yankees acquired Pennock after the 1922 season, and he served as a key member of the pitching staff as the Yankees won four World Series championships. After retiring as a player, Pennock served as a coach and farm system director for the Red Sox, and as general manager of the Philadelphia Phillies.

Pennock was regarded as one of the greatest left-handed pitchers in baseball history. He died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1948, and was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame later that year.

==Early life==
Pennock was born on February 10, 1894, in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania. His father, Theodore Pennock, and mother, Mary Louise Pennock (née Sharp), were of Scotch-Irish and Quaker descent. His ancestors came to the United States with William Penn. Herb was the youngest of four children.

Pennock attended Westtown School and Cedarcroft Boarding School, where he played for the baseball team. After struggling as a first baseman, with weak offense and a inability to throw the ball straight, Pennock was converted by his Cedarcroft coach into a pitcher.

==Professional baseball career==
===Philadelphia Athletics===
While pitching at Cedarcroft, Pennock threw a no-hitter to catcher Earle Mack, the son of Connie Mack, manager of the Philadelphia Athletics, in 1910. Pennock agreed to sign with the Athletics at a later date. Mack signed Pennock in 1912 to play for his collegiate team based in Atlantic City. Pennock&#x27;s father insisted that he sign under an alias in order to protect his collegiate eligibility. Pennock threw a no-hitter against a traveling Negro league baseball team, and Mack promoted him to the Athletics. Mack intended for Pennock to be one of the prospects who would replace star pitchers Eddie Plank, Chief Bender, and Jack Coombs.

Pennock made his major league debut with the Athletics during their 1912 season on May 14, allowing one hit in four innings pitched. He was the youngest person to play in the American League (AL) that season. Former major leaguer Mike Grady, a neighbor of Pennock&#x27;s in Kennett Square, took Pennock under his wing, while Bender taught Pennock to throw a screwball.

Pennock missed most of the 1913 season with an illness, but was able to rejoin the team late in the season. In the 1914 season, Pennock posted an 11–4 win–loss record with a 2.79 earned run average (ERA) in innings pitched for the Athletics, and pitched three scoreless innings in the 1914 World Series, which the Athletics lost to the Boston Braves. Mack let Bender go after the season, naming Pennock his Opening Day starting pitcher in 1915. On Opening Day, Pennock threw a one-hit complete game shutout against the Boston Red Sox. However, as the Athletics struggled, Pennock&#x27;s nonchalant playing style drew Mack&#x27;s ire. Concluding that Pennock &quot;lacked ambition&quot;, Mack sold Pennock to the Red Sox for the waiver price of $2,500 ($ in current dollar terms). Mack later regarded this sale as his greatest mistake.

===Boston Red Sox===
With a deep pitching staff in place, the Red Sox loaned Pennock to the Providence Grays of the International League in August for the remainder of the 1915 season. He split the 1916 season between the Red Sox and the Buffalo Bisons, also in the International League. With Buffalo, Pennock pitched to a 1.67 ERA, as Buffalo won the league pennant. Though the Red Sox won the 1915 and 1916 World Series, Pennock did not appear in either series.

Pitching in minor league baseball, Pennock began to regain confidence. However, Boston manager Jack Barry used Pennock sparingly in the 1917 season, and Pennock enlisted in the United States Navy in 1918. Pennock pitched for a team fielded by the Navy, defeating a team composed of members of the United States Army in an exhibition for George V, the King of England in Stamford Bridge stadium. After the game, Ed Barrow, the new manager of the Red Sox, signed Pennock to a new contract after promising to use him regularly during the 1919 season.
Pennock received only one start apiece in the months of April and May, as the 1919 Red Sox relied on George Dumont, Bill James, and Bullet Joe Bush, leading Pennock to threaten to quit in late-May unless Barrow fulfilled his earlier promise to Pennock. Barrow continued to use Pennock regularly after Memorial Day, and Pennock finished the season with a 16–8 win–loss record and a 2.71 ERA in 219 innings pitched. He served as the team&#x27;s ace pitcher in the 1920 season, but subsequently settled in as the Red Sox&#x27; third starter. After the 1922 Red Sox campaign, in which he went 10–17, and had seven wild pitches, leading the AL, the New York Yankees began to negotiate with the Red Sox to acquire Pennock. The Yankees traded Norm McMillan, George Murray, and Camp Skinner to the Red Sox for Pennock that offseason.

===New York Yankees===
Pennock pitched to a 19–6 win–loss record in the 1923 season, his first with the Yankees, leading the American League (AL) in winning percentage () and finishing sixth in wins. Pitching in the 1923 World Series, Pennock defeated the New York Giants in game two, on October 11, to end their eight-game World Series winning streak. He recorded a save in securing the Yankees&#x27; win in game four, and pitched to the win in game six on one day of rest, clinching the Yankees&#x27; first World Series championship. Umpire Billy Evans called it &quot;the greatest pitching performance I have ever seen&quot;, as Pennock &quot;had nothing.&quot;

In the 1924 season, he pitched to a 21–9 win–loss record with a 2.83 ERA while striking out a career-high 101 batters. His win total was second in the AL, behind Walter Johnson, while his ERA was third behind Johnson and Tom Zachary, and he finished fourth in strikeouts behind Johnson, Howard Ehmke, and teammate Bob Shawkey. Pennock&#x27;s 277 innings pitched and 1.220 walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP) ratio led the AL in the 1925 season, while his 2.96 ERA was second-best, behind Stan Coveleski. In the 1926 season, he posted a career-high 23 wins, finishing second in the AL to George Uhle. He again led the AL in WHIP (1.265), and issued the fewest walks per nine innings pitched (1.453). During the pennant race, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; called Pennock the &quot;best left-hander in the majors&quot;. Pennock earned the wins in game one and game five of the 1926 World Series. He finished game seven of the series, which the Yankees lost to the St. Louis Cardinals.
The Yankees reached the World Series, facing the Pittsburgh Pirates. Pennock pitched a complete game against the Pirates in game three of the 1927 World Series, not allowing a hit until the eighth inning. Pennock&#x27;s performance drew praise from teammate Babe Ruth. The Yankees swept the series from Pittsburgh. After pitching a three-hit shutout against the Red Sox on August 12, 1928, he missed the remainder of the season, including the 1928 World Series, with an arm injury. His five shutouts and 0.085 home runs per nine innings pitched led the AL. His 2.56 ERA trailed only Garland Braxton, while his 17 wins tied for eighth place. Though the Yankees defeated the Cardinals in the 1928 World Series, the Yankees&#x27; starting rotation without Pennock was likened to &quot;a three-stringed ukulele.&quot;

In the 1929 season, Pennock saw his pitching time and pitching quality diminish. Over the rest of his career, he never posted more than 189 innings pitched in a season and his ERA rose to over 4.00. He suffered from bouts of neuritis in 1929 and 1930. Pennock won his 200th career game during the 1929 season, becoming the third left-handed pitcher to reach that mark. He led the AL in walks per nine innings pitched in 1930 (1.151) and 1931 (1.426). Pennock pitched four innings of relief against the Chicago Cubs in the 1932 World Series, recording two saves. The New York chapter of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America named him their player of the year.

In 1933, serving exclusively as a relief pitcher, Pennock had a 7–4 win–loss record in 23 appearances. After the 1933 season, the Yankees honored Pennock with a testimonial dinner on January 6, 1934, and then gave him his release.

===Return to Boston===
Eddie Collins, a former teammate with the Athletics now serving as the general manager of the Red Sox, signed Pennock to their 1934 roster. In his last season pitching in the major leagues, Pennock served as a relief pitcher for the Red Sox.

Pennock retired with a career record of 241 wins, 162 losses, and a 3.60 ERA. Pennock pitched in five World Series, one with Philadelphia and four with New York. He was a member of four World Series championship teams. In World Series play, Pennock amassed a 5–0 career win–loss record with three saves, becoming the second pitcher to win five World Series games, after Coombs. Pennock was a part of seven World Series championship teams (1913, 1915, 1916, 1923, 1927, 1928, and 1932), though he played in four World Series as a member of the winning team. Many, including Mack, considered Pennock among the greatest left-handed pitchers of all time.

==Post-playing career==
Pennock became the general manager of the Charlotte Hornets, a Red Sox&#x27; farm team of the Piedmont League, prior to the 1935 season. He returned to the Red Sox in 1936 as the first base and pitching coach under manager Joe Cronin. He served in this role through the 1938 season. In 1939, Pennock became the assistant supervisor of Boston&#x27;s minor league system, reporting to Billy Evans, then succeeded Evans as Director of Minor League Operations late in the 1940 season.

In December 1943, R. R. M. Carpenter Jr., the new owner of the Philadelphia Phillies, hired Pennock as his general manager, after receiving a recommendation from Mack. Carpenter gave Pennock a lifetime contract. Pennock filled Carpenter&#x27;s duties when the team&#x27;s owner was drafted into service during World War II in 1944. As general manager, Pennock changed the team&#x27;s name to the &quot;Blue Jays&quot;—a temporary measure abandoned after the season—and invested $1 million ($ in current dollar terms) into players who would become known as the &quot;Whiz Kids&quot;, who won the National League pennant in 1950, including Curt Simmons and Willie Jones. He also created a &quot;Grandstand Managers Club&quot;, the first in baseball history, allowing fans to give feedback to the team, and advocated for the repeal of the Bonus Rule.

Pennock opposed racial integration in baseball. In 1947, when Jackie Robinson was signed to the Brooklyn Dodgers, Pennock called Dodgers team president Branch Rickey before the Dodgers&#x27; series in Philadelphia and told him not to &quot;bring that nigger here with the rest of the team.&quot; He further threatened to boycott a 1947 game between the Phillies and Dodgers if Robinson played.

Accusations of Pennock&#x27;s alleged racism have come into question upon the 2016 release of the book &quot;Herb Pennock: Baseball&#x27;s Faultless Pitcher&quot; written by Keith Craig. The only source of the story about the call to Rickey was from the 1976 book &quot;The Lords of Baseball&quot; by Harold Parrott who claimed to have listened in on the conversation on an extension line, something which didn&#x27;t exist at the time. Robinson had stated that the call was made by Carpenter and not Pennock. Additionally in his book, Craig mentioned that Pennock and his wife took in a black woman who had fled an abusive husband in the 1930s, lived with their family for the rest of her life and was buried next to him.

In 1948, at the age of 53, one week and four days before his 54th birthday, Pennock collapsed in the lobby of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel as a result of a cerebral hemorrhage. He was pronounced dead upon his arrival at Midtown Hospital. Pennock had appeared to be in good health, even inviting friends to join him at Madison Square Garden to attend a boxing match, prior to being stricken.

==Honors==
Pennock was honored with &quot;Herb Pennock Day&quot; on April 30, 1944, in Kennett Square. Weeks after his death in 1948, Pennock was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. In 1998, an attempt to erect a statue in Kennett Square in his honor was blocked due to his support of segregation in baseball.

Fred Heimach, a teammate of Pennock, once called him the smartest ball player he knew. In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included Pennock in their book &quot;The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time&quot;. He was inducted in the International League Hall of Fame in 1948. Noted baseball photographer Charles M. Conlon considered Pennock one of his favorite subjects to photograph.

==Personal life==
Pennock was nicknamed &quot;the Squire of Kennett Square.&quot; He married Esther M. Freck, his high school sweetheart and the younger sister of a childhood friend, on October 28, 1915. Esther often attended spring training and traveled with her husband&#x27;s team during the season. Together, the couple had a daughter, Jane (born 1920), and a son, Joe (born 1925). Jane later married Eddie Collins Jr. While a member of the Yankees, Pennock rented an apartment on Grand Concourse in The Bronx, where his wife and children stayed while the Yankees played their home games.

Pennock was a proficient horse rider. He also raised hounds and silver foxes for their pelts. He also grew flowers and vegetables on his farm.

Pennock was a Freemason and a member of Kennett Lodge No. 475, F.&amp;A.M., in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania.

<text>George Vincent Rhoden (13 December 1926 – 24 August 2024) was a Jamaican athlete, winner of two Olympic gold medals in 1952.

Rhoden was born in Kingston on 13 December 1926. He later moved to San Francisco, California, and was one of the successful long sprinters from Jamaica in the late 1940s and early 1950s, along with Arthur Wint and Herb McKenley. He competed in the 1948 Summer Olympics, but did not win a medal, being eliminated in the heats of the 100 m and the semi-final of the 400 m. He was also a member of the heavily favoured Jamaican 4 × 400 m relay team, but when Wint pulled a muscle in the final, their chances at a medal were gone. On 22 August 1950 at Eskilstuna, Sweden, Rhoden set a new world record in 400 m of 45.8 s. He also won the AAU championships in 400 m from 1949 to 1951 and as a Morgan State University student, won the NCAA championships in in 1951 and in from 1950 to 1952. He was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.

At the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Rhoden was more successful. As a world record holder he was one of the pre-race favourites in the 400 m which he won in a close battle with his compatriot McKenley, who had also been second in the 1948 Olympic 400 m. As the anchor runner of the Jamaican relay team, Rhoden added a second Olympic gold, edging the United States where he lived by a tenth of a second, and setting a new world record (3:03.9). He died on 24 August 2024, at the age of 97.

<text>Célestin Charles Alfred Bouglé (1 June 1870 – 25 January 1940) was a French philosopher and sociologist known for his role as one of Émile Durkheim&#x27;s collaborators and a member of the &quot;L&#x27;Année Sociologique&quot;.

==Life==

Bouglé was born in Saint-Brieuc, Côtes-du-Nord. He entered the École Normale Supérieure in 1890 and aggregated in philosophy in 1893. He was, along with Xavier Léon, Élie Halévy, Léon Brunschvicg and Dominique Parodi, one of the founding members of the journal &quot;Revue de Métaphysique et de Morale&quot;. In 1896 he joined with Durkheim and became one of the first editors of the &quot;Année Sociologique&quot;. He received his doctorate in 1899 and became a professor of the history of social economy. Sometimes referred to as &quot;the ambivalent Durkheimian&quot;, he is considered to be the most original and autonomous among the Durkheimians. 

After teaching in Saint-Brieuc, Montpellier, and Toulouse he took a position at the Sorbonne in 1908, the same year that &quot;Essay on the Caste System&quot; appeared. In 1922, Bouglé published &quot;The Evolution of Values&quot;, which is sometimes considered to be his magnum opus. He was the vice-president of Human Rights League (France) from 1911 to 1924 and played an important role in the organization&#x27;s establishment in 1898. He founded and directed the first sociology research center in France, Centre de documentation sociale (1920–1940). He became the director of the École normale supérieure (Paris) in 1935 until 1940. He died in Paris in 1940.

==Influence==

Bouglé was one of French anthropologist Louis Dumont&#x27;s foremost inspirations when it came to seeing Indian castes (in the spirit of the &quot;Année Sociologique&quot;) not just as elements making up a whole, but forming an ideological system (that of the Varnas, not the numerous Jatis) that in meaning and scope surpasses the sum of the elements.

<doc id="811589" wikidata="Q1217475" url="?curid=811589" title="The Waves">
<text>The Waves is a 1931 novel by English novelist Virginia Woolf. It is critically regarded as her most experimental work, consisting of ambiguous and cryptic soliloquies spoken mainly by six characters: Bernard, Susan, Rhoda, Neville, Jinny and Louis. Percival, a seventh character, appears in the soliloquies, though readers never hear him speak in his own voice. 

The dialogues that span the characters&#x27; lives are broken up by nine brief third-person interludes detailing a coastal scene at varying stages in a day from sunrise to sunset. As the six characters or &quot;voices&quot; speak, Woolf explores concepts of individuality, self and community. “Each character is distinct, yet together they compose a gestalt about a silent central consciousness”, according to a reviewer.

In a 2015 poll conducted by the BBC, &quot;The Waves&quot; was voted the 16th greatest British novel ever written.

==Plot==

The novel follows its six narrators from childhood through adulthood. Woolf is concerned with the individual consciousness and the ways in which multiple consciousnesses can weave together.

Bernard is a story-teller, always seeking some elusive and apt phrase. Some critics see Woolf&#x27;s friend E. M. Forster as an inspiration for him.

Louis is an outsider who seeks acceptance and success. Some critics see in him aspects of T. S. Eliot, whom Woolf knew well.

Neville, who may be partly based on another of Woolf&#x27;s friends, Lytton Strachey, seeks out a series of men, each of whom becomes the present object of his transcendent love.

Jinny is a socialite whose world view corresponds to her physical, corporeal beauty. There is evidence that she is based on Woolf&#x27;s friend Mary Hutchinson.

Susan flees the city, preferring the countryside, where she grapples with the thrills and doubts of motherhood. Some aspects of Susan recall Woolf&#x27;s sister Vanessa Bell.

Rhoda is riddled with self-doubt, anxiety and depression, always rejecting and indicting human compromise, always seeking out solitude. She echoes Shelley&#x27;s poem &quot;The Question&quot;. Rhoda resembles Virginia Woolf in some respects.

Percival, partly based on Woolf&#x27;s brother, Thoby Stephen, is the esteemed hero of the other six. He dies midway through the novel, while engaged on an imperialist quest in India. Percival never speaks on his own in &quot;The Waves&quot;, but readers learn about him in detail as the other six characters repeatedly describe and reflect on him.

==Style==

The difficulty of assigning genre to this novel is complicated by the fact that &quot;The Waves&quot; blurs distinctions between prose and poetry, allowing the novel to flow between six interior monologues. The book similarly breaks down boundaries between people, and Woolf herself wrote in her &quot;Diary&quot; that the six were not meant to be separate &quot;characters&quot; at all, but rather facets of consciousness illuminating a sense of continuity. Even the term &quot;novel&quot; may not accurately describe the complex form of &quot;The Waves&quot; as is described in the literary biography of Woolf by Julia Briggs (&quot;An Inner Life&quot;, Allen Lane 2005). Woolf called it not a novel but a &quot;playpoem&quot;.

The book explores the role of the &quot;ethos of male education&quot; in shaping public life, and includes scenes of some of the characters experiencing bullying during their first days at school.

==Reception==

Marguerite Yourcenar translated &quot;The Waves&quot; into French over a period of ten months in 1937. She met Virginia Woolf during this period and wrote: &quot;I do not believe I am committing an error ... when I put Virginia Woolf among the four or five great virtuosos of the English language and among the rare contemporary novelists whose work stands some chance of lasting more than ten years.&quot;

Although &quot;The Waves&quot; is not one of Virginia Woolf&#x27;s most popular works, it is highly regarded. Literary scholar Frank N. Magill ranked it one of the 200 best books of all time in his reference book, &quot;Masterpieces of World Literature&quot;. In &quot;The Independent&quot;, British author Amy Sackville wrote that &quot;as a reader, as a writer, I constantly return, for the lyricism of it, the melancholy, the humanity.&quot;

Theatre director Katie Mitchell, who adapted &quot;The Waves&quot; for the stage, called the work &quot;entrancing […] Woolf&#x27;s point is that the lasting and significant events in our lives are small and insignificant in the eyes of the outside world.&quot;

The origin of the Celestials was long unknown, with many species across the mainstream Marvel Universe having only unconfirmed legends about their beginnings—until the so-called &quot;Eternity War&quot;, when major revelations about the Celestials were revealed by the mysterious cosmic entity &quot;Queen of Nevers&quot;.

At the beginning of creation itself, countless billions of years ago, before the current Cosmic Order, creation was composed of a single and sentient universe, whose omnipotent intelligence was referred to as the First Firmament. For countless ages, the First Firmament was the sole being in creation, until its loneliness became unbearable. It decided to create the first life in Creation to give it companions as well as servants—an act that it would come to regret. These servants, cosmic beings of a lesser order of power, were of two kinds: black and multicolored humanoid servants. The black servants dutifully obeyed and worshiped their creator. They even created their own servants and sought to preserve the simple order their creator had made complete and unchanging for all time. The First Firmament named these loyal beings Aspirants and was very pleased by their goals and desire to maintain the status quo of its reign. However, the multicolored ones had completely different values and desires from the Aspirants. Considered &quot;rebels&quot; by the First Firmament, they wanted a dynamic, diverse and continually evolving Reality where beings lived, learned, reproduced, aged and died to slowly improve themselves through evolution. The rebels wanted this with the ultimate long-term goal of producing superior cosmic beings with the power to create universes of their own and for the universe to evolve with them as they advanced towards that state. These were the beings whom one day would be called by lesser life forms, &quot;The Celestials&quot;.

The two opposing factions of the First Firmament&#x27;s children could not peacefully co-exist and the ensuing war nearly destroyed the first universe. At some point during the war, the Aspirants created a now-lost hyper weapon called the Godkiller, a space-borne tall humanoid robot that dwarfed even the Celestials themselves. It was powered by a cosmic artifact later called the Heart of The Voldi (named after the species which would adopt it) and operated by genetically engineered pilots. During the war, the Godkiller destroyed countless billions of Celestials and brought them to the brink of extinction. At this point, for unknown reasons, a civil war broke out among the Aspirants that led to the Godkiller being stripped of critical parts for weapons. This division within the Aspirants gave the Celestials a chance to recover and make their last stand. In the final battle against the Aspirants, the Celestials detonated their ultimate weapons that tore the First Firmament apart and very nearly killed it. In a desperate act of self-preservation, the core essence of the First Firmament took the surviving Aspirants and fled outside Reality. In the wake of its near destruction, the major fragments of the First Universe that were torn off coalesced into a new cosmic being, one with multiple realities composing it. This was the birth of the Second Cosmos and the First Multiverse. After the birth of the first Multiverse, the &quot;rebels&quot; settled inside him, multiplied and began their vast plan to create and nurture transitory but evolving life on the newborn worlds within, a general outline of the basic plan the Celestials follow for shaping the evolution of life on a chosen planet after it develops primitive sentient life.

This initial visit is called a First Host of Celestials, after the chosen planet has been judged to possess the needed properties for an effective &quot;seeding&quot;. The Celestials then return for follow-up visits or &quot;Hosts&quot;, during which they monitor the subject planet&#x27;s progress and make whatever modifications or interventions they deem appropriate. These Hosts have been documented on Earth, and have also been found on many other planets throughout the universe. Other major examples include the Skrull homeworld, hundreds of millions of years ago, and numerous Sh&#x27;iar worlds, such as Gladiator&#x27;s homeworld.

===First Host on Earth===
Collecting a number of natives during the Stone Age, the Celestials begin genetic experimentation to determine the species&#x27; future development. They create two subspecies from the natives: Eternals, Deviants, and a majority &quot;normal&quot; strain that may or may not be modified in some manner that enhances its long-term development. For example, the Celestials first visited Earth nearly a million years ago and implanted a special genetic code into the early hominids. This implanted DNA structure has been revealed to be not only the source of the ability of select random humans to develop superpowers upon exposure to dangerous environmental catalysts, it also allowed for the development of benevolent mutations that caused the existence of inborn potential superpowers in mutants. In truth, the Celestials came to Earth to investigate the disappearance of a Celestial only to realize Earth might eventually create antibodies against the Horde infection via its powered inhabitants.

===Second Host===
Approximately 21,000 years ago, the Celestials returned to Earth for the Second Host and found that the Deviants had created a vast empire across the world based on the continent of Lemuria, where they had conquered most of the primitive human tribes with their superior technology. They were also about to go to war with the original human inhabitants of the neighboring continent of Atlantis. The Celestials then destroyed Lemuria and sank it under the ocean, utterly shattering the Deviants&#x27; empire and indirectly sinking Atlantis-therefore destroying both continents and reshaping the Earth.

===Third and Fourth Host===
Resenting the presence of the Celestials and their monitoring of Earth&#x27;s progress, the Skyfather figures of Earth (e.g. Odin, Zeus) attempted to stop the Third Host, but were quickly outmatched. The Space Gods then stated they would return 1,000 years later to judge Earth&#x27;s right to continue existing.

The Skyfathers then developed a convoluted plan to stop the Fourth Host via the use of the Odinsword and Destroyer armour, but once again the Celestials prevented the offensive and melted the Destroyer armour into slag, scattering the Asgardians&#x27; life forces. The Earthmothers (such as Frigga and Hera) of Earth, however, had planned a peaceful solution and made an offering of twelve perfect humans, which was accepted, and the planet was spared judgment. The judgment process on another planet was witnessed by Thor, who observed Celestial Arishem the Judge sending an execution code to Exitar the Exterminator, a tall Celestial who carried out Arishem&#x27;s &quot;sentence&quot;. Exitar terraforms the planet in question into a garden paradise, with only the &quot;evil&quot; inhabitants having been destroyed. On one occasion, the hero Quasar observes a race completely failing the genetic test, with every living creature being destroyed with their planet.

===The Fulcrum===
The Celestials&#x27; actions conflicted with the policy of &quot;non-interference&quot; practiced by fellow cosmic entities the Watchers, with the two races becoming enemies. The Celestials and their &quot;opposites&quot;, the locusts of the universe, cosmic insect-like beings that would eventually be called the Horde, are established as instruments of an entity referred to as The Fulcrum (apparently an aspect of the One Above All), their purpose to be &quot;instruments of the planting/creation/teeming of the universe&quot;.

===Knowhere – The City Inside A Celestial&#x27;s Head===
One of the Celestials to first enter into the Abyss left after the destruction of the 6th Cosmos encountered the dark elder god Knull and picked him up to examine him. Enraged over the Celestials despoiling the Abyss through their creation of the 7th Cosmos, Knull manifested a blade of living abyss from his shadow – creating the first All-Black The Necrosword – and decapitated the Celestial, thereby marking it as the first death in the renewed Multiverse.

A team of space adventurers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, find and use as a base the severed head of a Celestial floating in an area of space known as &quot;The Rip&quot;. Dubbed &quot;Knowhere&quot;, the structure also acts as a common port of call (complete with a market and bar) for travelers from all points in the space-time continuum. The base is administered by its chief of security, Cosmo, a telepathic and telekinetic Soviet space dog originally lost in Earth orbit in the 1960s. Courtesy of the deceased Celestial&#x27;s &quot;Continuum Cortex&quot;, travelers with special &quot;passport&quot; bracelets can teleport to any point in the universe instantaneously.

===X-Termination===
In the beginning, the Celestials were foolish to play god and thought that with life and creation, there must be also death and destruction, so they created the Exterminators to be that death and destruction. Their creation turned on them and since they were unable to kill their creation, they imprisoned the Exterminators to the walls that separated realities. Learning from their mistakes, they eventually created the Death Seed with the same purpose. The Exterminators remained there for millennia, until the walls began to crack and started to teleport between universes, which weakened the walls even more and were able to escape. Dark Beast and an alternate version of Beast used the Dreaming Celestial to open a portal to go through Earth-295, which caused one of the Exterminators to travel to Earth-616 and drained the Dreaming Celestial. Bosnos, the seventh and most supreme of the Celestials, was sent to clean up after the destruction the Exterminators left behind.

===The End of the Seventh Multiverse===
During the &quot;Time Runs Out&quot; storyline, the Beyonders are revealed to have killed all the Celestials in each reality across the multiverse, to perform an experiment by destroying the Seventh Multiverse.

===The birth of the Eighth Multiverse===
A number of Celestials from across the multiverse had survived the Beyonders&#x27; attack, however, having taken shelter within the folds of space-time. They were planning to reenter the Multiverse after it was reborn after the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; event. This rebirth however had an unforeseen consequence: it provided an opening for the embittered First Firmament, who had been patiently waiting Outside, to attack the newly reborn, and therefore greatly weakened Eternity, with the goal of destroying the multiverse and restoring itself to the center of creation. The Firmament first chained and then began infiltrating Eternity with both its loyal Aspirant agents and taking control over the lesser cosmic entities that protected the cosmic balance in its component universes. Under the Firmament&#x27;s influence, Master Order and Lord Chaos destroyed the reborn Living Tribunal in front of Galactus the Lifebringer and then found their servant, The In-Betweener and forcibly merged into a new cosmic being many orders of magnitude of power greater that called itself Logos. Logos then located the surviving Celestials and destroyed all but one of them who was rescued by The Queen of Nevers.

===The Fifth Host===
Later, while observing the last stand against the First Firmament, The Queen of Nevers reveals the reason why she had saved the One Above All. By using him as a seed, she raises the Celestials anew as her own Avatars of Possible in what she claims to be the Fifth Host. The Celestials then faced and defeated the Aspirants of the First Firmament.

===The Final Host===
Later it was revealed that during the Stone Age, a Celestial referred to as &quot;The Fallen&quot; came to Earth. It was described as &quot;deranged&quot; as it dug into the Earth apparently searching for something. Due to the danger it posed, the Avengers of the Stone Age fought the Fallen and defeated it before burying it deep underground in the modern-day country of South Africa, where it was found and awakened by a group of archaeologists after they uncovered the cavern it was sealed in. The Fallen then summoned the Final Host while killing the archaeologists and soon afterwards was approached by Loki, the Asgardian God of Mischief, for unknown purposes.

===The secret origin of the new Marvel Universe===
Some time later, Celestials began literally &quot;raining&quot; down on Earth forcing the Avengers to reunite again and just in time to see the arrival of the Final Host which is composed of Dark Celestials that are each physically unique and were the ones who easily took down their brethren. Soon afterwards it appeared that these Dark Celestials are in league with the Horde of bugs pouring out of the center of the planet and with Loki. In an attempt to learn more about the Celestials, Iron Man and Doctor Strange visited the Eternals, only to find them all dead or dying from self-inflicted wounds. Ikaris was found barely alive and used his last words to reveal to Iron Man that the Uni-mind was the only thing that can stop the Final Host from fully unleashing the Horde, as the existence of a dead Celestial that Loki calls the Progenitor is revealed.

The Progenitor is actually the first Celestial to ever set foot on Earth, when it was an insignificant speck of molten mud and utterly lifeless. He came to Earth not because of some grand cosmic design or godly destiny nor did he even consciously choose the planet, he came merely because he was dying and falling. As it turns out, even the omnipotent Celestials get sick, and the Progenitor was hopelessly infected by the Horde. As the Progenitor died, his blood and rotting flesh mixed into the shifting primordial elements of the newly formed planet and thus affected the course of Earth evolution as it made the planet a unique breeding ground for all the super-powered beings one day to come.

Five billion years after the death of the Progenitor and his corpse&#x27;s incorporation into Earth&#x27;s &quot;primordial soup&quot;, another Celestial eventually followed looking for him. This was The Fallen, who was known as Zgreb the Aspirant, the lover of the Progenitor and according to Loki, it became mad by the sight of its dead lover, or perhaps by the effect of the Horde latching onto him. In any event, Odin and his Prehistoric Avengers took on this Celestial, leaving it for dead deep in the Earth. Eventually, the disappearance of two Celestials brought down The First Host to Earth. They made quick work of the Prehistoric Avengers but left after the battle, rather than destroy the Avengers or the Earth. Loki surmises that the Celestials feared succumbing to the Horde themselves and believed it better to leave Zgreb buried deep underground to keep the Horde infection contained, creating in the process two opposing humanoid species – the Eternals and the Deviants – to defend the process under the false impression that they were actually protecting the human race.

===Dark Celestials===
When Loki revived Zgreb from his long slumber deep in the Earth, he discovered that the Horde did not kill Zgreb, instead they transformed him into Zgreb the Sorrower, a new breed known as Dark Celestial. Together with the rest of his kind, collectively known as the Final Host, they&#x27;ve killed or infected every other Celestial, the dead bodies of whom now litter the Earth, feeding the Horde.

As the entire planet panics due to the Final Host actions, the heroes finally realize why the Celestials did not cleanse planet Earth when they had the chance, they saw the potential to grow an antidote to defeat the Horde and so they waited, visiting the planet now and then to see if the cure had been developed. Eventually the world breathes a sigh of relief as the Avengers, combining their powers through the Uni-Mind (given to Iron Man by Ikaris) purged the Earth of the Horde, curing the infected Celestials. The newly revived Celestials then defeat the Dark Celestials.

===Infinity Wars===
In the 2018 &quot;Infinity Wars&quot; event, as the Infinity Stones are gathered once again, Loki dupes his own version of the Infinity Watch within the Soul World, stealing the six Stones belonging to the main Marvel universe from Gamora. He does so to dive deep into the Quarry of the Gods at the end of time, believing unlimited power awaits him there. But as he enters, he discovers the Stones hold no power in the bottom of the quarry, becoming just ordinary rocks. More so, he sees the area littered with thousands of Stones, confirming that this quarry is where these powerful artifacts originated and are actively mined. Loki immediately recognizes the miners as a squad of unique Celestials (this new group could very well be the oldest of their kind) who are clearly manipulating the fate of the multiverse by spreading the stones out across all the multiverse.

===King in Black===
During the &quot;King in Black&quot; storyline, three Celestials are shown to have been slain by Knull, with their corpses being possessed by his symbiotes. Thor and Knull later fight and Thor gains the upper hand until Knull distracts Thor by bringing in his symbiote-possessed Celestials and stabs Thor in the back. Iron Man arrives to use his Extremis-infected Symbiote Dragon to take control of the symbiote-possessed Celestials.

===A.X.E.: Judgment Day===
During the &quot;A.X.E.: Judgment Day&quot; storyline, the Avengers and the Eternals that did not side with Druig work to revive the Progenitor (which became the Avengers Mountain) when Druig awakens the Hex to attack Krakoa. This was not to be a simple resurrection. Instead, they would re-write the &quot;programming&quot; of the Celestial, creating a being with ideals more aligned with their own. This new God would, if they succeeded, forcibly end Druig&#x27;s war. Upon waking, the Progenitor did just that and ordered the Hex to leave. However, the Progenitor also quickly surmised that the inhabitants of Earth had driven it to ruin, so he declared they would have twenty-four hours to prove themselves more good than evil, else he would destroy the world. He immediately takes notice of Captain America, whom he harshly judges and declares a failure. The Progenitor is also well aware of its own weaknesses and showed the Avengers, X-Men, Eternals and essentially all of mankind a future of its death which also significantly devastated mankind. The Progenitor was skilled enough to fool even Jean Grey. He then continues its judgment declaring Emma Frost, Destiny, and Mystique as failures citing them as proof that the civilians of Earth cannot lay their trust in heroes to save them. It does give Kro positive judgment and will consider the others longer. Cyclops later visited the Progenitor in the Arctic. As it starts to pass it&#x27;s judgment, Cyclops states that he requests a change of venue stating that Jean Grey is the only one who can judge him and that his fellow X-Men might scold him later. The Progenitor gives Cyclops a positive judgment. While the Progenitor has also passed positive judgment on the Deviants, it also gave positive judgment to Phastos, negative judgment to Makkari, deferred Ajak&#x27;s judgment, and will consider Ikaris&#x27; judgment longer. Eventually after many judgments the Progenitor judged humanity as unworthy and while the heroes of the planet united against it, they were nevertheless defeated. The Progenitor demanded the Machine that is Earth to self-destruct, but the Machine refused and Phastos was able to reset it before the Progenitor could cause it to explode. Meanwhile, some of the Eternals, X-Men, Sinister, and Stark infiltrated the Celestial to activate its own self-destruct while continuing to be judged by the Progenitor. Upon reaching the core, they convinced the Progenitor that it itself is not worthy which resulted in it undoing every death it caused and reverted to Avengers Mountain. It also empowered Ajak so that she could be the god the Progenitor could not. However, an aspect of the Progenitors&#x27; consciousness still exists and continues to observe the world and its inhabitants. It also communicated with Starbrand and told her things she should know, like the fact that her powers were shortening her lifespan.

== Biology ==
Referred to as &quot;space gods&quot; by the Eternals and the Deviants, the Celestials appear as silent, armored humanoids with an average height of . They weigh an average of 260 tons, meaning they are far denser than air. They are capable of feats such as reducing the Asgardian construct known as the Destroyer to slag, moving planets at will, and creating and containing entire pocket universes. Reed Richards theorized that the Celestials&#x27; source of power was Hyperspace itself – the source of all energy in the Marvel Universe. The characters are almost invulnerable, and have only been harmed in rare instances, before instantly regenerating.

The first murder of a Celestial (which was also the first murder of the current multiverse) was carried out by the God of the Abyss, Knull, using the first Necrosword. The first known assassination of a Celestial was carried out by the Apocalypse Twins, who used the divinely-enchanted axe &quot;Jarnbjorn&quot; to pierce Celestial armor, against the Celestial Gardener. Composed of Asgardian Steel, &quot;Jarnbjorn&quot; was unable to pierce the Celestial-armored Apocalypse until Thor blessed the axe with his blood. The now-lost &quot;hyperweapon&quot;, Godkiller, a space-borne humanoid robot which dwarfs even the Celestials themselves, was claimed to have destroyed Celestials literally by the billions.

New Celestials may be born by consuming the mass of the Black Galaxy, a place made out pure biological and organic matter, or with planets which were implanted with Celestial eggs/embryos at the core and after millions of years they would be born and would consume the planet, similar to the Celestials of Earth X. However, there are other ways for a Celestial to be born as witnessed with the Celestial Madonna who was carrying an infant Celestial. The Celestials also have an immune system, consisting of armored behemoths, jellyfish-like antibodies and a swarm creature with wings and tentacles, which can fire blasts from their eye. The Celestials are all telepathically linked to one-another no matter the distance.

Thanos, wielding the Infinity Gauntlet, ranked the Celestials as being on roughly the same scale of power as Galactus, the Stranger, Odin, and Zeus, but below that of Mistress Love, Lord Chaos, and Master Order.

== Reception ==

=== Accolades ===

* In 2020, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked the Celestials 3rd in their &quot;Marvel&#x27;s 10 Most Powerful Giants&quot; list.
* In 2021, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked the Celestials 1st in their &quot;10 Strongest Characters From Eternals Comics&quot; list and 8th in their &quot;Marvel: The 10 Strongest Cosmic Entities&quot; list and 8th in their &quot;10 Bravest Gods In Marvel Comics&quot; list.
* In 2022, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked the Celestials 7th in their &quot;16 Most Powerful Cosmic Characters In Marvel Comics&quot; list.

== Other versions ==
The characters also appear in the 1999 alternate universe limited series &quot;Earth X&quot;, appearing as beings of energy encased in armor composed of vibranium, a metal with properties that prevent their dissipation. They reproduce by planting a fragment of their essence in a planet, which matures into a new Celestial over the course of eons. As a form of protection of that growing Celestial, its &quot;parents&quot; would manipulate the DNA of a planet&#x27;s dominant life form to gain super-abilities and unknowingly act as antibodies, protecting the planet until the Celestial is born. The cosmic entity Galactus opposes them, devouring planets that incubate Celestial &quot;eggs&quot; to prevent the Celestials from overpopulating the universe.

In the Ultimate Marvel universe, the Celestials are a race of powerful metahumans led by Shen Xorn.

In the alternate reality of the 1998 miniseries &quot;Mutant X&quot;, the Celestials openly opposed the Goblin Entity, an all powerful being that consumed entire galaxies and the polar opposite of the Phoenix Force. While they were ultimately successful in imprisoning their enemy, they would die from the injuries they sustained during the battle. The Goblin Entity escaped its prison several years later by attaching itself to the life force of Madelyne Pryor.

The Celestials of Earth-4280 were convinced they were gods and attempted to conquer the Multiverse by use of the Bridge, a device created by Reed Richards that allows its users to observe and enter alternate worlds. They were defeated by the combined forces of Galactus and a Franklin Richards from an alternate future.

In &quot;X-Men &#x27;92&quot;, the race known as the M&#x27;Kraan had developed mutants who then evolved into Celestials, such as Xodus the Harvester who thought that the mutants from other worlds would replace his kind.

&quot;What If? Secret Wars&quot; features a version of Doctor Doom with the powers of the Beyonder and the Infinity Gauntlet who had defeated the Celestials.

==In other media==
===Film===
* The Celestials are featured in media set within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. As in the comics, their origin and nature are shrouded in mystery. Whatever can be known about them is known only by a few, such as Taneleer Tivan / The Collector, who reveals that the Celestials utilized the Infinity Stones as a means of power against lesser life forms.
** The severed head of a deceased Celestial was converted into Knowhere and appears in the live-action films &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; (2014) and &quot;&quot; (2018), the animated Disney+ series &quot;What If...?&quot; (2021), the television special &quot;The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special&quot; (2022), and &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3&quot; (2023). Knowhere was used as a congregation hub for space travelers, and the Tivan Group set up mining operations within it to harvest valuable resources. Following the events of &quot;Infinity War&quot;, the Collector sold Knowhere to the Guardians of the Galaxy, who turned it into their headquarters. 
** In &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;, footage of Eson the Searcher is shown using the Power Stone to destroy a planet. 
** In &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&quot;, Ego the Living Planet, Peter Quill / Star-Lord&#x27;s biological father, is a Celestial who controls a humanoid avatar to travel the universe. His planetary form is a living extension of his Celestial consciousness. Over the course of many years, he planted thousands of alien seedlings to expand his existence across all life-sustaining planets. However, Ego needed another Celestial&#x27;s assistance to activate them, so he fathered children with various alien races and had Yondu Udonta retrieve them so he could gauge their Celestial powers. Quill is the only child who gained his father&#x27;s Celestial abilities, though he loses them after killing Ego and foiling his plans.
** In &quot;Eternals&quot;, Arishem the Judge, Nezarr the Calculator, Jemiah the Analyzer, and Hargen the Measurer appear. Here, they are shown to stabilize the universe with their infinite powers and to plant seeds of their species in planets, destroying them in the process. To control those planets&#x27; population growth, they made the Deviants. But when they disobeyed the Celestials&#x27; will, the latter created the Eternals. Arishem has a greater rank than other Celestials. Tiamut the Communicator almost emerged from Earth, but was turned into a kind of marble, later called Adamantium, by Sersi after she and the others joined in a Uni-Mind. Arishem at the end of the film, takes Sersi and two more Eternals away with him for judgment, to see if Tiamut&#x27;s sacrifice was worth it for the people of Earth.
** In &quot;&quot;, a Celestial Gardener and a Mad Celestial were seen outside the Council of Godheads chamber when Thor&#x27;s group was fleeing from Omnipotence City.

<doc id="811601" wikidata="Q1188992" url="?curid=811601" title="Dennis Specialist Vehicles">
<text>Dennis Specialist Vehicles was an English manufacturer of commercial vehicles based in Guildford, building buses, fire engines, lorries (trucks) and municipal vehicles such as dustcarts. All vehicles were made to order to the customer&#x27;s requirements and more strongly built than mass production equivalents. For most of the 20th century the Dennis company was Guildford&#x27;s main employer.

Following a decade of financial difficulties original shareholders sold out in 1972 and Dennis&#x27;s ownership has since passed through quite a number of hands. The Woodbridge site was sold and a new small factory built in Slyfield remains in use by lineal business descendant, bus-maker Alexander Dennis. No Dennis haulage trucks have been built since 1985. The last Dennis fire engine left the Guildford factory in 2007.

The Dennis brand is still used on Alexander Dennis buses, Dennis Eagle dustcarts and Dennis mowers.

==Dennis Brothers 1895 to 1901==
Dennis Brothers was founded in 1895 by brothers John Cawsey Dennis (1871–1939) and (Herbert) Raymond Dennis (1878–1939) who made Speed King bicycles. They built the bicycles, initially from bought-in parts, and sold them from their shop, The Universal Athletic Stores, in High Street, Guildford. They made their first motor vehicle in 1898, and in 1899, their first car, &quot;The Dennis Light Doctor&#x27;s Car&quot;. Though shown at the National Cycle Show this car was never put into production.

==Dennis Brothers Limited 1901 to 1972==
===Cars===

After incorporating Dennis Brothers Limited, in which they were given generous financial support by local cyclists and potential motorists, the brothers began car production around 1901. John Dennis built a 30,000 square foot three storey plus basement building in Onslow Street in the centre of Guildford with a lift between floors later known as the Rodboro Buildings. This was the first purpose-built motor vehicle factory in Britain.

Their range of cars was quickly extended to 12 hp, 14 hp, 16 and 20 hp chassis fitted with tourer, town car and limousine bodies. From the Dennis Brothers stand at the 1903 Crystal Palace Motor Show the brothers sold almost £30,000 worth of cars and took many more orders. Larger models followed their first light cars. A 35 hp model in 1906 was powered by a White and Poppe engine. This power unit was soon fitted to all their vehicles.

===Worm drive back axle===
Until well into the early years of the twentieth century the back wheels of most vehicles were driven by a chain from each side of a differential fixed to the chassis frame. Dennis Brothers developed and patented a reliable worm drive into a differential mounted on the back axle. Another feature of that period was &quot;spring drive&quot;, a torsional shock absorber mounted at the input end of the drive line.

===Commercial vehicles===

Commercial vehicle activity increased. Their first was a van for Harrods in London. Dennis made its first bus in 1903 and their first fire engine in 1908 — for Bradford Council Fire Department. The last car was made in 1913 after the Dennis brothers saw there was less competition in the commercial vehicle market.

The rate of growth of the business may be gauged from the regular expansions on their new site at Woodbridge Hill on the outskirts of Guildford — in 1907, 1910, 1912 and 1913. In 1913 Dennis Brothers moved their main operations to a new much larger building of almost four acres on the twelve-acre site at Woodbridge leaving their purpose-built Onslow Street premises solely for repairs. In March 1913 the investing public learnt that Dennis Brothers was a manufacturer of motor-vans, motor-lorries, motor-fire-engines, motor-cars etc. The brothers&#x27; offer of shares to the public was substantially over-subscribed and Dennis Brothers Limited became a publicly listed company. Rising international tensions precipitated a major contract for supply of 1,000 3-ton &quot;subsidy&quot; lorries to private buyers on terms set by the War Office. Taking the subsidy obliged the buyer to release the vehicle to the War Office in time of war. Materials had been ordered but no subvention lorries completed when the situation changed.

===World War I===

After August 1914&#x27;s outbreak of hostilities production was reduced to the subvention type 3-ton military lorries, now supplied directly to the War Office, and the Dennis turbine fire engine. The Ministry of Munitions took complete control of the whole business in 1915. New buildings were added to contain the manufacture of munitions.

===Between wars===
===1920s===
Following 1918&#x27;s armistice there was a glut of war surplus vehicles and a consequent collapse in demand for new trucks. To try to compensate the Dennis product range was expanded into municipal vehicles — dustcarts (refuse collection), street cleaning vehicles, sewage tankers and pumps etc. Municipal vehicles do not suffer from the fluctuations of demand experienced by the overall economy. Buyers tend to replace them at fixed periods so there is an element of longer term planning. While it is a relatively small market it is stable. Motor mowers were added in 1922.

White and Poppe in Coventry had always supplied engines for Dennis Brothers motor vehicles. A takeover had been under consideration before the war but it was not until April 1919 that it was made public Dennis Brothers and White and Poppe had agreed to an exchange of shares in each other&#x27;s business. The swap gave Dennis Brothers the controlling interest in White and Poppe. Alfred White and Peter Poppe joined the Dennis Brothers board but it was not until March 1933 in the midst of the 1930s depression that engine production was transferred from Coventry to Guildford.

One chassis was used for both lorries and buses. In the 1920s Dennis began to design and build separate chassis for their public service vehicles (buses) with a lower ride height. Pneumatic tyres were introduced. Forward control buses were added to their catalogue in the same decade. Export markets were developed between the wars, particularly vehicles for Hong Kong.
===The 1930s===
The decade began with the Great Depression. Diesel engines were in demand for larger commercial vehicles. New Dennis buses were a double-deck Lance and single-deck Lancet. The Dennis Ace, a smaller twenty-seater bus was brought into production in 1933 using the chassis of Dennis&#x27;s small lorry. The Arrow Minor followed in 1935 and a new Falcon chassis in 1938.

John and Raymond Dennis built 223 houses for their workers, 102 of them on a 20 acres estate in Woodbridge Hill for their Coventry motor workers who brought production of White &amp; Poppe engines to Guildford in 1933. The area took on the name Dennisville. Both brothers died in 1939 and they are commemorated in the names of Dennisville&#x27;s St John&#x27;s Road and Raymond Crescent.
===Second World War===
During the Second World War the Ministry of Supply restricted Dennis to lorries and allocated bus production to Daimler and Guy. Over that period Dennis built some 3,000 6/8 ton capacity &quot;Max&quot; and 1,500 &quot;Pax&quot; 3-ton lorries, assembled 700 Churchill tanks, 17,000 engines for landing craft, 7,000 fire pumps, 750,000 bombs and 3,000 infantry carriers. Meanwhile, &#x27;municipal vehicles&#x27; were built for military bases. The plant operated around the clock and the number of workers doubled to 4,000.

===1948 Nationalisation of road haulage===
British Road Services, Britain&#x27;s state-owned road haulage operator, didn&#x27;t buy any trucks from Dennis. New products were developed but were not attractive to BRS. The suppliers to BRS were prospering, Leyland, AEC and Foden&#x27;s technical advances and greater truck experience let them build even better buses to compete with Dennis buses. Only Dennis&#x27;s light Pax trucks sold well and they went to businesses still permitted to run their own short-distance transport. Yet the company&#x27;s buses and fire engines remained in demand. The 1940s and 1950s still managed to be Dennis&#x27;s best years.

===The 1950s===
The 1950s saw the introduction of diesel engines and automatic transmissions and bus engines were moved below floors to increase carrying capacity. 

After the war bus production began again. 1950 introductions were a passenger chassis named Dominant with a semi-automatic transmission and a horizontally mounted diesel engine and Paxit all-enclosed mechanical rear-loading refuse-collection vehicles. Rolls-Royce diesel engines replaced Dennis petrol engines in the fire engines during 1951. New show vehicles in 1952 included a 5½ litre Centaur chassis with platform body, a Pax chassis with tipping gear and a lightweight body and the Stork chassis.

The AV1, a new diesel ambulance chassis, returned ambulances to the Dennis product line-up during 1954. The next year an updated heavy fire engine chassis received Rolls-Royce fully automatic gearboxes.

They were not yet in production but Dennis revealed their plans for new Loline model doubledeck buses at the end of 1956. Built with Dennis components they used a patented Bristol Lodekka chassis. The Dennis version was for the independent section of the market Bristol was unable to supply. During 1957 sales in both home and export markets fell. Demand for commercial vehicles did not recover after the Suez Crisis. The new Loline buses were in service and a variant new chassis was now available with front entry providing driver control of the door.

===The 1960s===
In the 1960s engines moved to the back of the buses.

In May 1962, Dennis bought the fire appliance division of Hawker Siddeley Group&#x27;s Alfred Miles. In April 1964 Dennis purchased the industrial tractor manufacturer Mercury Truck &amp; Tractor Company, also Mercury Airfield Equipment that manufactured airport tugs and later baggage trailers and ground units, and Mercury Snow Control.

Potential passenger customers preferred their new vehicles front-entrance and rear-engined and Dennis had no bus in production to meet those requirements. Dennis chose to end bus manufacture in 1965 and concentrate on lorries which also faced declining demand.

In late 1965 a significant block of shareholders dissatisfied with the performance of their business asked that Dennis Brothers cease production and liquidate its assets. The disputes ended when the rebels were unable to find a buyer for the Dennis business at an acceptable price. Major changes were made to management and to the directorate. The following year turnover grew again and profits seemed to have made improvement. New capital was found for an expansion and modernisation programme and twelve months later the new chairman reported activities had been split into six clear-cut divisions and claimed they were &quot;poised for recovery&quot;.

The shareholders were faced with continuing losses. Responding to their invitation John King of Pollard Ball took up the challenge and accepted the position of chairman of the board. Julian Amery, a former Minister of Aviation, joined the board as did a new CEO and a new finance director. The workforce of 1,300 was cut by 150, mostly white-collar workers. A banker was added to the directorate.

At King&#x27;s suggestion Dennis Motor Holdings, was formed on 15 January 1970 as a holding company with all part-time directors. In June the chairman announced much greater losses in the subsequent half year but he remained optimistic. They listed their products as: commercial vehicles, fire engines, refuse collection vehicles and aircraft tractors.

In 1971/72, Dennis sold 101 houses in Slyfield&#x27;s Woking Road and in Midleton Road, Dennisville.

==Hestair Group==
;The Vehicle Division of Hestair Engineering

===Dennis Motors 1972 to 1977===

In March 1972 Hestair made a successful takeover bid for Dennis Motor Holdings. It took effect in May 1972. With Dennis came 35 acres of sprawling red brick factory on the Guildford by-pass. Hestair announced it intended to sell surplus land.

Hestair was a new industrial investment vehicle managed by David Hargreaves. It had purchased street sweeper bodybuilder Yorkshire Vehicles and dustcart bodybuilder Eagle Engineering in 1971. Hestair&#x27;s other interests were agricultural engineering, toys and employment bureaux.

Dennis Motor Holdings was renamed Dennis Motors Limited and with Eagle and Yorkshire Vehicles, managed as the Vehicle Division of Hestair Engineering.

In June 1972 the manufacture of trucks for haulage ceased. In September Hestair sold Dennis&#x27; Mercury towing tractors and motor mowers to Marshalls (Halifax) and new plant was bought for the Guildford factory.

Envec, an acronym for Environmental Vehicles, was chosen as the new brand name for marketing the municipal vehicles built by Dennis Motors, Eagle Engineering and Yorkshire Vehicles.

Non-specialist truck production for general haulage resumed in 1974 after a break of two years. New rear-engined single-decker and double-decker buses were announced in August 1977 after a bus-building break of eleven years. At the time of the announcement the workforce was 875 and Dennis Motors remained Guildford&#x27;s largest employer. The first new bus was the Dominator with a double-deck body followed by more new buses named Jubilant, Dorchester, Lancet and Falcon. The Falcon chassis took either single or double-deck bodies. All these names belonged to previous successful Dennis models. A new range of fire appliances, the R series, went into production in 1976. A single specialist fire engine chassis on which modular body units could be mounted it was complementary to the existing range.

On 31 December 1977 Dennis Motors Limited was renamed Hestair Dennis Limited.

===Hestair Dennis 1977 to 1985===
The former Dennis Motors business was renamed Hestair Dennis by August 1977. A Queen&#x27;s Award for Export was received in 1978. In February 1980 John Smith, the managing director of Hestair Dennis, was jailed for life in Baghdad for paying &quot;huge amounts for commercial deals and secret information&quot;. Four of the Iraqis with him were hanged. He was not released until February 1988.

&quot;Phoenix&quot; was added as a brand name to all Dennis Eagle refuse collectors during 1978.

The Delta 1600 series trucks were launched, middleweight 16 tonne vehicles for tipper and haulage applications.

In February 1983, Hestair Dennis purchased Duple Coachbuilders. Between the two Hestair could produce complete vehicles with the new Duple-developed integrated body-chassis units. Duple owned Duple Metsec in Tipton, suppliers of bus body kits for assembly overseas. Hestair Duple 425 was displayed in October 1984 and in production a year later powered by Cummins engines. On 10 December 1985 Hestair Dennis Limited was renamed Dennis Specialist Vehicles Limited and again on 3 February 1986 to Hestair Specialist Vehicles Limited.

===Special-vehicle division===
====Production moves to Warwick, Worcester, Blackpool====

In late 1985 a new 125,000 square foot Dennis Eagle plant on the Heathcote Industrial Estate in Warwick opened, taking over the building of Dennis municipal vehicle chassis and the matching Eagle bodies. Construction of chassis for buses and coaches as well as fire appliances remained at Guildford but that factory lost 600 jobs. Building of fire appliance bodies was moved to Carmichael Fire in Worcester and all cabs to Duple at Blackpool.

The re-organisation cost around £4 million covered by the sale of part of the original Dennis site. The Guildford workforce dropped from 700 to 400. Still one of Europe&#x27;s largest builders of fire appliance chassis Dennis Specialist Vehicles was running at a loss.

In the 1980s bus engines stayed beneath the floor but were moved as far back as possible to release luggage space. At the October 1986 Commercial Motor Show Dennis introduced its Javelin design using a 6-cylinder Cummins engine mounted forward of the axle. Previous models had used Gardner engines.

The fire engineering division was closed and requirements contracted out to Carmichael in Worcester. At this time Dennis claimed 65 per cent of the fire engine market. John Dennis of the founders&#x27; family, previously coach and truck sales manager, left and set up John Dennis Coachbuilders to build complete fire engine bodies.

The remaining business was the manufacture of chassis for fire appliances and public service vehicles. Almost all the 35-acre Woodbridge Hill site was sold.

At the October 1988 Motor Show Dennis and Duple displayed their new Dennis Dart midibus.

===Management buy-out===
At the end of 1988 the Vehicle Division of Hestair Engineering comprised:
*Warwick&#x27;s Dennis Eagle which held around 35 per cent of the refuse collector market, much of which was now carried out by private contractors to the local authorities and there was no longer a steady regular demand for replacement vehicles. Dennis Eagle represented about one-third of the Vehicle Division
*Guildford&#x27;s Dennis Special Vehicles building PSV and fire appliance chassis. 
*Blackpool&#x27;s Hestair Duple, the coach body builder with 
::Duple Services and 
::Duple Metsec selling bus body kits for export. 
::Bifort Engineering, a specialist in high technology plastic mouldings.

==Trinity Holdings==
===Trinity Holdings 1989 renamed Dennis Group in 1997===
Trinity Holdings, the management of the Vehicle Division of Hestair Engineering with the backing of banking institutions, bought Dennis from Hestair. Geoff Hollyhead, former head of the Vehicle Division, led the management buyout and was appointed chairman and CEO. The stated intention was to relist the Dennis group back on the London Stock Exchange.

Hestair Specialist Vehicles Limited was renamed Specialist Vehicles Limited on 7 March 1989.
Duple Coachbuilders was closed down in July 1989 with 350 jobs lost. The parts and service business went to Plaxton, production of the 300 series and 425 Integral followed parts and service to Plaxton later. Plaxton took the Duple sites in London, Blackpool and Glasgow to enlarge their spares and repairs network. Dennis and Duple had developed the Dart, a midibus bought by London Transport as a one-man operated bus to replace their AEC Routemasters. At the end of 1989 Dart bodywork production moved from the closed Duple to Carlyle Works in Birmingham. The Dart was followed by the Lance which used independent front suspension to allow a low floor halfway down the vehicle.

The next year Guildford factory moved to Slyfield Industrial Estate and into new premises allowing room to increase production. The work force was more than 300.
Shelvoke&#x27;s design rights were bought from the receiver in September 1991 and their parts and service depots at Merthyr Tydfil and Birmingham were taken over. Dennis now had 27 service outlets.

Carmichael Fire, a rival manufacturer of a range extending from Land Rover based fire tenders up to 8 x 8 airfield crash tenders, was rescued from its parent&#x27;s receiver in 1992. 

As intended Trinity Holdings was successfully floated in 1992. At that time it was described as a group of famous motor engineering names including Dennis fire engines, buses and dustcarts, Duple bus kits and Reliance Mercury airport tenders. Trinity claimed it was Europe&#x27;s largest specialist vehicle producer making specialised products for niche markets. Dennis held 40 per cent of the British fire engine market, the Dart mid-sized bus was Britain&#x27;s biggest seller.

In 1993, Trinity entered a joint venture with UMW in Malaysia to build buses in Malaysia from Guildford built chassis kits and Duple Metsec body kits. Trinity withdrew from the venture in 1998.
In December 1995, Trinity purchased the aircraft and cargo handling division of ML Holdings: Douglas Equipment and Schopf.

In October 1997 Trinity rebranded itself as the Dennis Group. It also revealed an order from Stagecoach Group for 100 Dennis Dart double-decker buses. In the first half of 1997, it produced made more than 1,000 buses and fire engines, restructured the assembly plant at Warwick and expanded its Guildford plant increasing capacity 25 per cent.

===Low-floor bus chassis===

Henlys Group, the new name for Plaxton, made buses which it often mounted on Dennis chassis. For some years they had together made double-deckers for Hong Kong and British Columbia and mini-buses for English customers. The Dennis and Henlys combined production held 40 per cent of the British market. Combined along with third partner Volvo they held the biggest share of the US market. It seemed logical to put the Henlys and Dennis businesses together and Henlys made an offer to Dennis Group shareholders.

Mayflower, an engineering group that owned bus bodybuilder Walter Alexander, felt threatened by the almost-completed Henlys-Dennis tie up and launched a bid for Dennis. Volvo responded by announcing its backing for the Henlys Dennis merger. Mayflower revealed a proposed alliance with Daimler-Benz including collaboration on development of chassis, technical support, power unit supply and worldwide distribution.

Mayflower was angling for the Dennis-Henlys (and Volvo) strong position in the US bus market. It was believed Dennis&#x27;s low-floor bus chassis design would fit the expected US demand for wheelchair-friendly buses and less polluting bus engines. That market was estimated to be around 15,000 vehicles each year. Mayflower&#x27;s other core division, Mayflower Vehicle Systems, supplied panels to European and US manufacturers.

Mayflower won the contested takeover bid for Dennis Group and within a few months disposed of two Dennis subsidiaries it did not want. Subsequent events showed Mayflower paid too much for Dennis.

===Divestments===
*Carmichael International, Worcester manufacturer of appliances from Land Rover-based vehicles to all-wheel drive Cobra 2 airfield crash tenders, was sold in February 1999.
*Dennis Eagle, Douglas Equipment and Schopf were sold in July 1999 to NatWest Equity Partners.

==TransBus International==

In 2000 Mayflower (Dennis and Alexander brands) and Henlys Group (Plaxton), aiming to save overheads, merged their British bus-making operations into a joint venture owned 70 per cent by Mayflower and 30 per cent by Henlys. The factories concerned employed 3,300 staff in seven places in Scotland and Yorkshire.

Specialist Vehicles Limited was renamed TransBus International Limited on 31 December 2002.

In March 2004, Mayflower was placed in administration amid accusations of four years of falsifying crucial company records as to customers&#x27; payments to HSBC, counting the same income twice. TransBus was also placed in administration. Eventually TransBus Plaxton was sold to its managers, Brian Davidson and Mike Keane with the support of a private equity group. TransBus Alexander and TransBus Dennis were bought by a consortium which included David Murray, Brian Souter and Ann Gloag, and was branded Alexander Dennis.

The company incorporated as Dennis Motor Holdings in 1970 to save boardroom disputes having subsequently worn new names of:
:Dennis Motors, Hestair Dennis, Dennis Specialist Vehicles, Hestair Specialist Vehicles and just Specialist Vehicles but finally Transbus International was dissolved on 19 June 2018, after several times being restored from dissolution since 2008.

==Products==
===Fire engines===

Dennis fire engines were noted, from their 1908 outset, for their use of a Gwynnes made centrifugal pump or &#x27;turbine&#x27; as a water pump, rather than the piston pumps used by other makers. This was more complex to build than the long-established piston pumps, but had advantages in operation. Where water was supplied under pressure from a hydrant, rather than by suction from a pond, this additional pressure was boosted through the centrifugal pump, whereas a piston pump would have throttled it. Piston pumps also gave a pulsating outlet pressure which required an air-filled receiver to even this out.

The Karnataka Fire and Emergency Services owns a pumper that was built by Dennis Brothers and delivered to the erstwhile Kingdom of Mysore in 1925 from England.

=== Refuse trucks ===
Dennis were noted as specialist makers of refuse collection trucks, with compactors, bin lifters, tipper-body emptying and other specialised features for this market. The same market is now served by Dennis Eagle.

===Military vehicles of World War II===
* Loyd Carrier 
* Churchill Tank
* Light Artillery Tractor 6 x 6 &#x27;Octolat&#x27; (a misnomer, standing for &#x27;eight wheel light artillery tractor, retained when the design was abbreviated by one axle to reduce length and weight, and improve handling). 
Conceived to meet a requirement for a simple easily produced and maintained alternative to the effective but costly and complicated Quad 4 x 4 tractor, the Dennis design steered on the first pair of wheels but dispensed with springs, substituting six oversized tyres for conventional suspension.

A centre-control driving position in a shallow lightly armoured body provided with ammunition lockers and sheltered under an overall canvas tilt resulted in a vehicle not instantly recognisable as truck. (Prototypes used a box body in place of the simple platform and conventional cab). Early models were powered by twin coupled Bedford engines but the final design was powered by a powerful Leyland 9.8 litre engine. Length was 20 feet (6 metres), height 7 ft 6 inches (2.3 metres) high.

Despite promising test results no production order was forthcoming.

<text>He&#x27;s a Woman, She&#x27;s a Man is a 1994 Hong Kong romantic comedy film co-written and directed by Peter Chan and starring Leslie Cheung, Anita Yuen, Carina Lau, Eric Tsang and Jordan Chan. This film was the recipient of many awards at the 14th Hong Kong Film Awards, including Best Actress for Yuen and Best Original Song for &quot;Chase&quot; by Cheung. The film was followed by a sequel, &quot;Who&#x27;s the Woman, Who&#x27;s the Man?&quot;, which was released in 1996. The theme song &quot;Chase&quot; (追) appeared on Cheung&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;Most Beloved&quot;.

==Plot==
Wing (Anita Yuen) is a sassy girl who deeply idolizes Rose (Carina Lau), a pop singer, and Rose&#x27;s boyfriend, top record producer and songwriter Sam (Leslie Cheung). Rose has been groomed by Sam, achieving stardom and international acclaim. With her success, Sam decides to try his hand at bringing up a male singer. He decides to announce a country-wide, males-only talent search, much to his former protégée&#x27;s chagrin.

Wing, desperate to meet her idols, seizes this opportunity and enters the contest disguised as a male. Her childhood friend (Jordan Chan) trains her to perfect this whimsical idea.

As fate would have it, Wing succeeds in the audition thanks to the poor quality of those auditioning and in part to Rose&#x27;s taunts. Rose challenges Sam to see to the idea of him bringing up a (relatively) talentless Wing.

Wing is later invited to stay at Sam and Rose&#x27;s home for her musical education. Wing tries unsuccessfully to reconcile the two lovers&#x27; difference. Trouble and comedy ensue as she finds herself falling for Sam and vice versa, despite his mistaken belief that she is a man.

<text>Henry John Boddington (1811 – 11 April 1865) was an English landscape painter during the Victorian era, and a member of the Williams family of painters.

==Biography==
Henry John Boddington was born Henry John Williams on 14 October 1811 in London. He was the second son of the painter Edward Williams (1781-1855) and Ann Hildebrandt (c.1780-1851), and a member of the Williams family of painters, who were related to such famous artists as James Ward, R.A. and George Morland. His father was a well-known landscape artist, who taught him how to paint; otherwise he received no formal instruction.

In 1832, when just of age, he married Clarissa (Clara) Eliza Boddington (daughter of John Boddington), and adopted her surname, becoming Henry John Boddington, in order to distinguish his work from that of his brothers and other relatives; They had one child, Edwin Henry Boddington, (14 October 1836, Islington – 1905), who also became a painter. After a few years of great poverty and struggle, Henry John became a very prosperous artist. He lived first at Pentonville, then moved to Fulham, then Hammersmith, and finally in 1854 to Barnes, then in Surrey.

His earliest pictures depicted the scenery of Surrey and the banks of the Thames. Work of his was first exhibited at the Royal Academy, London in 1837, and from 1839 onwards one or two of his pictures were exhibited there every year until his death and four years after it. He showed even more paintings at the Society of British Artists in Suffolk Street. His name appears for the first time in the catalogue for 1837, and in 1842 became a member of the society (RBA), afterwards exhibiting there an average of ten pictures a year until his death. In 1843 he visited Devon, staying at Ashburton; in 1846 the English Lake District; and in 1847, for the first time, North Wales, which, especially the country around Betws-Y-Coed and Dolgelly, became his favourite working-ground. Boddington also painted in Scotland, Yorkshire, and other parts of England, but never travelled to the continent.

The Dictionary of National Biography described Boddington as &quot;of a humorous, amiable, and manly character&quot;. After suffering for several years from a progressive disease of the brain, he died at his home in Barnes on 11 April 1865 and is buried nearby in Barnes Cemetery.

===The Williams Family===
Henry John Boddington was born into an artist family that is sometimes referred to as the Barnes School. His father and five surviving brothers (listed below) were all noted landscape painters during the Victorian era. Henry was one of three sons of Edward Williams who changed their last names to protect the identity of their art.

*Edward Williams (father)
*Edward Charles Williams
*George Augustus Williams
*Arthur Gilbert
*Sidney Richard Percy
*Alfred Walter Williams

==Art==
Boddington developed his own style, characterised by a remarkable ability to depict the foliage of backlit trees. Jan Reynolds (1975) observed that one of his &quot;most characteristic effects is the appearance of a warm day, with the sun just out of the picture, giving a filmy, hazy atmosphere to the landscape, with deep blue shadows adding greater value to the opposing tone of yellow. The distant mountains are melting in vapory sunlight. The artist is a master of this effect...&quot; Like many Victorian painters, he worked on a grand scale. &quot;The Fine Arts Quarterly Review&quot; (Vol. 3, 1865) noted that he &quot;painted pictures not only large, but sometimes grand. His landscapes of mountains, lake and river had scenic breadth and power...&quot; 
 His paintings mostly depict peaceful English country scenes. He was a very rapid sketcher.

<text>Miriam Margolyes ( ; born 18 May 1941) is a British and Australian actress. Known for her work as a character actor across film, television, and stage, she received the BAFTA for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Mrs. Mingott in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; (1993), and achieved international prominence with her portrayal of Professor Sprout in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series (2001–2011). Margolyes was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2002 New Year Honours for Services to Drama.

After starting her career in theatre, Margolyes made the transition to film with a small part in the British comedy &quot;A Nice Girl Like Me&quot; (1969). Subsequent credits include &quot;Yentl&quot; (1983), &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; (1986), &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; (1988), &quot;I Love You to Death&quot; (1990), &quot;Immortal Beloved&quot; (1994), &quot;Different for Girls&quot;, &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot; (both 1996), &quot;Magnolia&quot;, &quot;End of Days&quot; (both 1999), &quot;Being Julia&quot;, and &quot;Ladies in Lavender&quot; (both 2004). She voiced roles in &quot;Babe&quot; (1995), &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot; (1996), &quot;Mulan&quot; (1998), &quot;Happy Feet&quot; (2006), &quot;Flushed Away&quot; (2006), and &quot;Early Man&quot; (2018).

Margolyes appeared in the television films &quot;Poor Little Rich Girl: The Barbara Hutton Story&quot; (1987), &quot;Orpheus Descending&quot; (1990), &quot;Stalin&quot; (1992), &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; (1995), and &quot;The Life and Death of Peter Sellers&quot; (2004). Her other credits include &quot;Blackadder&quot; (1983–1988), &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;Supply &amp; Demand&quot; (both 1998), and &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (2023), as well as the recurring roles of Prudence Stanley in the Australian drama series &quot;Miss Fisher&#x27;s Murder Mysteries&quot; (2012–2015), and Sister Mildred in the BBC1 drama series &quot;Call the Midwife&quot; (2018–2021).

On stage, Margolyes toured her one-woman show, &quot;Dickens&#x27; Women&quot;, between 1989 and 2012, which earned her an Olivier Award nomination; starred as Sue Mengers in the Australian premiere of &quot;I&#x27;ll Eat You Last&quot; (2014); and originated the role of Madame Morrible in &quot;Wicked&quot; (West End, 2006; Broadway, 2008). Outside acting, she has fronted various travelogue series and written two memoirs: &quot;This Much is True&quot; (2021) and &quot;Oh Miriam!&quot; (2023).

==Early life and education==
Margolyes was born in Oxford on 18 May 1941 into a Jewish family. She was the only child of Joseph Margolyes (1899–1995), a Scottish physician and general practitioner from the Gorbals area of Glasgow, and property-developer Ruth (; 1905–1974), daughter of a second-hand furniture dealer and auctioneer at Kirkdale, Liverpool, who later relocated to London. The maternal family surname changed from Sandeman to Walters before Margolyes&#x27; birth. Her maternal great-grandfather, Symeon Sandmann, was born in the Polish town of Margonin, then part of the Kingdom of Prussia, which Margolyes visited in 2013. Her paternal grandfather Philip Margolyes was born in the small Belarusian &quot;shtetl&quot; of Amdur, which at the time was in Grodno Governorate, Russian Empire.

Margolyes attended Oxford High School and Newnham College, Cambridge. There, in her 20s, she began acting and appeared in productions by the Cambridge Footlights. She represented Newnham College in the first series of &quot;University Challenge&quot;, where she may have been one of the first people to say &quot;fuck&quot; on British television; she claims to have used the word in frustration on the show in 1963. The word was &quot;bleeped out&quot; for transmission.

==Career==

With her versatile voice, Margolyes first gained recognition for her work as a voice artist. In the 1970s, she recorded a soft-porn audio called &quot;Sexy Sonia: Leaves from my Schoolgirl Notebook&quot;. In 1972 she played alongside Tony Robinson in the educational TV show &quot;Sam on Boffs&#x27; Island&quot;. She performed most of the supporting female characters in the dubbed Japanese action TV series &quot;Monkey&quot;. She also worked with the theatre company Gay Sweatshop and provided voiceovers in the Japanese TV series &quot;The Water Margin&quot; (credited as Mirium Margolyes).

In 1974, she appeared with Kenneth Williams and Ted Ray in the BBC Radio 2 comedy series &quot;The Betty Witherspoon Show&quot;.

Margolyes&#x27;s first major role in a film was as Elephant Ethel in &quot;Stand Up, Virgin Soldiers&quot; (1977). In the 1980s, she made appearances in &quot;Blackadder&quot; opposite Rowan Atkinson: these roles include the Spanish Infanta in &quot;The Black Adder&quot;, Lady Whiteadder in &quot;Blackadder II&quot; and Queen Victoria in &quot;Blackadder&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;. In 1986, she played a major supporting role in the BBC drama &quot;The Life and Loves of a She-Devil&quot;. She won the 1989 LA Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Flora Finching in the film &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; (1988). On American television, she headlined the short-lived 1992 CBS sitcom &quot;Frannie&#x27;s Turn&quot;. In 1994, she won the BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Mrs Mingott in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; (1993).

Margolyes played the dental nurse to Steve Martin&#x27;s dentist in the 1986 film &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;. In her 2023 memoir &quot;Oh Miriam: Stories from an Extraordinary Life&quot; Margolyes said Martin was &quot;undeniably brilliant, but horrid to me&quot; during the film. Martin responded that &quot;My memory is that we had a good communication as professional actors. But when it is implied that I harmed her or was in some way careless about doing the stunts, I have to object&quot;.

In 1989, Margolyes co-wrote and performed a one-woman show, &quot;Dickens&#x27; Women&quot;, in which she played 23 characters from Dickens&#x27; novels. In 2005 Margolyes hosted a ten-part BBC Four documentary, &quot;Dickens in America&quot;, which retraced Dickens&#x27;s 1842 journey across the United States of America.

Margolyes played Aunt Sponge and voiced the Glow-Worm in &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot; (1996). She played the Nurse in Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot; (1996). She voiced the rabbit character in the animated commercials for Cadbury&#x27;s Caramel bars and provided the voice of Fly the dog in the Australian-American family film &quot;Babe&quot; (1995).

She played Professor Sprout in &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; (2002) and again in &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot; (2011). In a 2011 interview on &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot;, in regard to her &quot;Potter&quot; costars, Margolyes said that she got on well with Maggie Smith, but rather bluntly admitted that she &quot;didn&#x27;t like the one that died&quot;, referring to Richard Harris. In 2024, Margolyes enraged adult Harry Potter fans by stating, &quot;I worry about Harry Potter fans because they should be over that by now. It was 25 years ago, and it’s for children.&quot; Harry Potter fans responded on X, one saying &quot;Nobody has a right to try and shame people into not enjoying something they harmlessly enjoy.&quot; Louis Chilton wrote in &quot;The Independent&quot; that &quot;Margolyes does have that right. Don’t we all? And what’s a bit of shame every now and then between friends?&quot;

In 2004, Margolyes played the role of Peg Sellers, the mother of Peter Sellers, in the Golden Globe winning film &quot;The Life and Death of Peter Sellers&quot;.

Margolyes was one of the original cast of the London production of the musical &quot;Wicked&quot; opposite Idina Menzel in 2006, playing Madame Morrible, a role she played again on Broadway in 2008.

In 2009, she appeared in a new production of &quot;Endgame&quot; by Samuel Beckett at the Duchess Theatre in the West End.

Margolyes voiced the role of Mrs. Plithiver, a blind snake, in the 3D-animated-epic film &quot;Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga&#x27;Hoole&quot; (2010).

In 2011, Margolyes recorded a narrative for the album &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Brides&quot; by klezmer musician-ethnographer Yale Strom.

Margolyes played recurring character Prudence Stanley in the Australian-based TV series &quot;Miss Fisher&#x27;s Murder Mysteries&quot; from 2012 to 2015.

In 2014, she voiced Nana in the Disney Junior animated series &quot;Nina Needs to Go!&quot;

In January 2016, Margolyes appeared in &quot;The Real Marigold Hotel&quot;, a travel documentary in which a group of eight celebrities travelled to India to see whether retirement would be more rewarding there than in the UK. The series was reprised for two Christmas Specials &quot;The Real Marigold On Tour&quot;, from Florida and Kyoto. She narrated the 2016 ITV documentary about Lady Colin Campbell entitled &quot;Lady C and the Castle&quot;.

In December 2017, Margolyes appeared in the second season of &quot;The Real Marigold On Tour&quot; to Chengdu and Havana. She appeared in the first episode of the third series, in which she travelled to St Petersburg with Bobby George, Sheila Ferguson and Stanley Johnson.

In January 2018, Margolyes hosted a three-part series for the BBC titled &quot;Miriam&#x27;s Big American Adventure&quot;, highlighting the citizens of the United States and the issues facing the country. She voiced Queen Oofeefa in the film &quot;Early Man&quot;. Since 2018, Margolyes has portrayed Mother Mildred in the BBC One drama, &quot;Call The Midwife&quot;.

She played Miss Shepherd in a 2019 production of &quot;The Lady in the Van&quot; for the Melbourne Theatre Company in Melbourne in Australia.

In October 2021, she played Lillian opposite Helen Monks in the BBC Radio 4 sitcom &quot;Charlotte and Lillian&quot;, where she introduced her autobiography &quot;This Much Is True&quot;. On 5 November she appeared on BBC One&#x27;s &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot;, where she discussed the book, explaining that it was written only because she &quot;was paid an enormous amount of money&quot;. On 16 September the book was published by Hachette Books.

In April 2022, Margolyes was the subject of the BBC documentary &quot;Miriam Margolyes: Up for Grabs&quot; in the &quot;Imagine...&quot; series, where she was interviewed by Alan Yentob.

She appeared on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The Museum of Curiosity&quot; in February 2023. Her hypothetical donation to this imaginary museum was &quot;Charles Dickens and all his works&quot;. In November 2023 Margolyes appeared as the voice of The Meep in &quot;The Star Beast&quot;, the first of three &quot;Doctor Who&quot; 60th anniversary specials.

==Personal life==
Margolyes spent many years living for long periods in Australia, and became an Australian citizen on Australia Day 2013, while retaining her British citizenship.

She is a lesbian, and referred to herself as a &quot;dyke&quot; live on national television and in front of Australian prime minister Julia Gillard in 2013. Since 1968, she has been in a relationship with Heather Sutherland, an Australian retired professor of Indonesian studies. they were dividing their time between homes in London and Kent in England, Robertson, New South Wales in Australia, and Montisi in Italy. In November 2023, Margolyes revealed on &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot; that she and Sutherland had never lived together, but she wanted to do so as they were now both old and did not have much time left. She had been living in London and Sutherland in Amsterdam for a while.

===Charities ===
Margolyes is a patron of My Death My Decision, an organisation in the UK which seeks a more compassionate approach to dying, including the legal right to a medically assisted death, if that is a person&#x27;s persistent wish.

Margolyes is a supporter of Sense (the National Deafblind and Rubella Association) and was the host at the first Sense Creative Writing Awards, held at the Charles Dickens Museum in London in December 2006, where she read a number of works written by talented deafblind people.

She is also a campaigner for the respite care charity Crossroads.

=== Political views ===
Margolyes&#x27; political activism started at university. &quot;I came from a very middle-class Jewish background, always Tory-voting&quot;, she later said. However, in the 1970s, she joined the Workers Revolutionary Party with other actors and Equity members such as Vanessa Redgrave, Frances de la Tour, and Tom Kempinski.

Margolyes is a member of the Labour Party and is registered to vote in Vauxhall. In August 2015, she was a signatory to a letter criticising &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;″s reporting of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s alleged associations with antisemites. In November 2019, she endorsed the Labour Party in the UK general election because of their policies on the National Health Service. Later in the month, along with other public figures, she signed a letter supporting Corbyn and describing him as a &quot;beacon of hope in the struggle against emergent far-right nationalism, xenophobia, and racism in much of the democratic world&quot;.

Margolyes was very critical of the British Government&#x27;s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. She considered it &quot;a public scandal&quot; and &quot;a disgrace&quot;. With the Prime Minister hospitalised suffering from COVID-19, Margolyes said &quot;I had difficulty not wanting Boris Johnson to die.&quot;

In a 2022 interview with &quot;Radio Times&quot;, Margolyes came to the defence of J. K. Rowling, commenting that &quot;There is a spectrum and people can be anywhere along that. There isn&#x27;t one answer to all these trans questions&quot;. In November 2023, Margolyes said during another appearance on &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot; that her position had changed after a discussion with Zoe Terakes, a trans Australian actor, and that she no longer believed that grammar was paramount over making someone happy by using their preferred pronouns.

On 15 October 2022, after being interviewed by Justin Webb about the recently deceased Robbie Coltrane on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot;, she commented to the presenters that she had never expected to be in a seat that had just been vacated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt. She said, live on air, &quot;When I saw him there I just said, &#x27;You&#x27;ve got a hell of a job, the best of luck&#x27;, and what I really wanted to say was &#x27;Fuck you, you bastard!&#x27;&quot;

She is a signatory of Jews for Justice for Palestinians. Margolyes said, &quot;What I want to try to do is to get Jewish people to understand what&#x27;s really going on, and they don&#x27;t want to hear it. If you speak to most Jews and say, &#x27;Can Israel ever be in the wrong?&#x27; they say, &#x27;No. Our duty as Jews is to support Israel whatever happens.&#x27; And I don&#x27;t believe that. It is our duty as human beings to report the truth as we see it.&quot;

On 6 April 2024, a video by Margolyes was published by The Jewish Council of Australia criticising the Israeli government on its ongoing invasion of the Gaza Strip and calling on Jews to &quot;shout, beg, scream&quot; for a ceasefire. In her 2.5 minute video she said:
=== Controversies ===
During a 2022 appearance on &quot;This Morning&quot;, Margolyes responded to one caller to &quot;lose weight&quot;, telling another &quot;not to mix with other cripples&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Author and comedian David Walliams says he used Margolyes as a model for the title character in his children&#x27;s book &quot;Awful Auntie&quot; after an argument with her during a stage production, though he stressed that he has nothing against her and is a fan of her work.

<text>Man-Killer is a name used by two supervillains appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The second version Katrina Luisa Van Horn has been viewed by critics as a &quot;caricature of feminists, who despised all men.&quot;

==Publication history==
The first version of Man-Killer first appeared in &quot;Captain America&quot; #111 (December 1968) and created by Stan Lee and Jim Steranko.

Man-Killer first appeared in &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; volume 1 #8 (April 1973) and created by Gerry Conway and Jim Mooney.

She received an entry in the &quot;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z 2006&quot; #7.

==Fictional character biography==
===Robot===
Man-Killer was a robotic assassin sent by Madame Hydra to kill Captain America, but the robot is defeated and destroyed.

===Katrina Luisa Van Horn===
Katrina Luisa Van Horn was an Olympic skier and is a militant feminist. After engaging in an argument with anti-Women&#x27;s Liberation skier Karl Lubbings, the two took their disagreement to the slopes. Katrina was an Olympic-level skier, but Lubbings cut her off and both skiers plunged off the mountain. Katrina was severely injured and disfigured. She was fitted with a powered exoskeleton and took the name Man-Killer (she no longer wears the exoskeleton so it is probable her strength has been enhanced somehow). She has worked freelance and as an agent for HYDRA.

Man-Killer has been a member of Crimson Cowl&#x27;s incarnation of the Masters of Evil. During an altercation with the Thunderbolts, Katrina told Songbird that she&#x27;d rather not fight her, as she had no problems with women, just with men (Songbird attacked her anyway). Some time later however, Erik Josten (Atlas of the Thunderbolts) discovered Katrina working as a bartender in his team&#x27;s adopted home of Burton Canyon, Colorado. When Josten became a regular at the bar Katrina was congenial towards him, pretending not to recognize him as Atlas. Whatever animosity Katrina may or may not bear towards men, she has proven herself capable of working alongside them with a minimum of personality conflicts.

As Amazon, she was briefly a member of the Thunderbolts under Hawkeye.

She had fought Spider-Man on some occasions.

Man-Killer is seen to be among the new recruits for Camp H.A.M.M.E.R.

Man-Killer later appears as part of Baron Helmut Zemo&#x27;s third incarnation of the Masters of Evil where they attacked the Winter Soldier&#x27;s incarnation of the Thunderbolts.

During the &quot;Opening Salvo&quot; part of the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, Man-Killer was involved in the Masters of Evil&#x27;s next fight with the Thunderbolts which ends in her apparent death at the hands of Kobik.

==Powers and abilities==
Katrina Luisa Van Horn was given robotic implants replacing and/or compounded with bones and nerves, which give her superhuman powers, good athletic abilities, and the ability to throw knives at a range of hundreds of meters. She was also given Pym particles to grow in strength proportionate to size.

==In other media==
* The Robot version of Man-Killer appears in the &quot;Avengers Assemble&quot; episode &quot;New Year&#x27;s Resolution&quot;. This version is Kang the Conqueror&#x27;s time-traveling robotic assassin. Two pose as Hydra agents to eliminate Howard Stark, but the first one is destroyed by Peggy Carter and the second one sent the two into the future before merging with the Iron Legion only to be destroyed by its intended target.

<doc id="811623" wikidata="Q5421199" url="?curid=811623" title="Expert Infantryman Badge">
<text>The Expert Infantryman Badge (EIB) is a special skills badge of the United States Army.

The EIB was created with the CIB by executive order in November 1943 during World War II. Currently, it is awarded to U.S. Army personnel who hold infantry or special forces military occupational specialties with the exception of soldiers with the occupational specialty of Special Forces Medical Sergeant (18D). To be awarded the EIB, the soldier must complete a number of prerequisites and pass a battery of graded tests on basic infantry skills.

Personnel who have been awarded both the EIB and the CIB are not authorized to wear both badges simultaneously. In such cases, Army Regulations allow the recipient to choose which badge is worn. A similar badge exists for medical personnel, known as the Expert Field Medical Badge (EFMB). In 2017, talks about a similar badge were being discussed for soldiers without the occupation of infantry, medical, or special forces were put on the table and in 2019 the army established the Expert Soldier Badge for soldiers who do not qualify for both the EIB and EFMB.

The EIB is a silver and enamel badge, consisting of a 3-inch-wide (76 mm) rectangular bar with an infantry-blue field upon which is superimposed a Springfield Arsenal Musket, Model 1795. Although similar in name and appearance to the Combat Infantryman Badge (CIB), it is a completely different award. While the CIB is awarded to infantry soldiers for participation in ground combat, the EIB is presented for completion of a course of testing designed to demonstrate proficiency in infantry skills.

==Modern requirements (2020s)==
A primary Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) in Career Management Fields (CMF) 11 (Infantry) or 18 (Special Forces) series, except 18Ds (Special Forces Medical Sergeant).

EIB Physical Fitness Assessment: Each candidate (regardless of sex or age) is required to complete 49 push-ups, 59 sit-ups and finish a 4 mile run in 32 minutes or less. 
Land navigation: complete a day and a night land navigation course within a specified timeframe; 
Weapon qualification: earn an &quot;expert&quot; qualification on their assigned weapon, typically an M16/M4; in the case of mortarmen (MOS 11C) expert qualification on the mortar is an additional requirement.
Forced foot march: complete a 12-mile foot march, carrying M4 and 35 lb. load + extra gear for a total of up to 70 lbs, within three hours. 
Lane or station testing in individual tasks, graded as pass/fail (&quot;GO&quot;/&quot;NO GO&quot;). There are approximately 30–35 stations in this phase. Candidates must pass every station; if they receive a &quot;NO GO&quot; on their first attempt, they have one chance to retest. A second &quot;NO GO&quot; at any station results in a failure for the entire testing phase. Generally there are multiple stations in all the following areas (&quot;less common/defunct tasks in italics&quot;):
* First Aid
* Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN) procedures
* Call for Fire (indirect fire), CAS (close air support), and Close Combat Attack
* Techniques for movement under fire, &quot;camouflage&quot;, hand-signaling, range estimation, and reporting contact to higher headquarters
* Communications: competency with &quot;ASIP&quot;, &quot;SINCGARS&quot;, MBITR or PRC-152 field radios and procedures
* Map reading: terrain identification, topography, use of military GPS
* Weapons proficiency: load, unload, perform function checks, clear, correct malfunctions, etc. for M9, M16/M4, M203, M249, M240B, &quot;M60&quot;, M2, Mk 19, AT4, Javelin; employ hand grenades, Claymore, and &quot;anti-tank mines&quot;
* Proficiency with night vision devices
* Boresighting proficiency
Foreign militaries are often invited to participate in the EIB when units are overseas or in host nation countries. Countries that have participated in the EIB include Bosnia, Korea, and Poland.

==Terminology and ritual==

While training in basic skills is a major goal of the EIB program, the EIB institution additionally provides an area of common experience and vocabulary across the infantry in the US Army. This test comes around about once every 2 years to most Infantry units. Those who fail could wait over a year before they have the opportunity to try again. Most likely they will transfer or PCS to another Infantry unit that may or may not be testing that year. Thus, the wait to retest could be longer.

Sociologically, the testing phase especially acts as a rite of passage for many infantrymen. The period of testing usually stretches over several days, with the number of candidates remaining steadily dwindling and pressure similarly increasing. Traditionally, hand grenades (where the candidate has five grenades to hit three different targets) and call for fire are considered the most difficult tests.

There is a specific slang vocabulary associated with EIB testing. Graders at each station usually have EIBs themselves; a &quot;badge protector&quot; is therefore a particularly difficult grader, perceived to be protecting the status of the award which he holds. Graders typically carry a blue pen to mark &quot;GO&quot;s and a red pen to mark &quot;NO GO&quot;s; to complete the entire phase without a single NO GO is therefore to go &quot;true blue&quot;. Similarly, if a candidate has one &quot;NO GO” he is said to be &quot;blade running&quot;; any mistake will eliminate him. Usually if the candidate makes a mistake and time has not run out, the grader will tell the candidate &quot;you still have time remaining&quot;, which is a clue that the candidate may have done something wrong. On occasion, the grader will do this to unnerve the candidate even though everything is correct, which completes the rite of passage.

==Master Infantryman Badge==

In late 2024 it was reported that &quot;master combat badges&quot; would debut in Spring 2025; the Master Infantryman Badge, Master Medical Badge, and Master Soldier Badge. The badges would represent those who have earned both a combat badge (CIB, CMB, or CAB) and an expert badge (EIB, EFMB, or ESB). The proposed &quot;master badges&quot; are alleged to appear identical to their respective combat badges, replacing the silver wreaths on the full-color metal badges with gold wreaths; subdued pin-on badges and sew-on badges would see their black wreaths also replaced with gold. Soldiers that had earned a combat badge but a &quot;separate&quot; expert badge (a CIB and an EFMB, for example) would wear the master badge aligning with their combat badge (in the case of a CIB and an EFMB, the awardee would wear the Master Infantryman Badge). As of 03 2025, no official announcement has been made concerning the badges.

It was designed by Charles Barry in the Perpendicular Gothic style and was completed in 1860. It houses the Parliamentary Archives in archive conditions meeting the BS 5454 standard, on 12 floors. All 14 floors of the building were originally linked via a single wrought-iron Victorian staircase of 553 steps, of which five floors survive. The steps are made of granite quarried from Cairngall in Aberdeenshire.

The main entrance at the base of the tower is the Sovereign&#x27;s Entrance, through which the monarch passes at the State Opening of Parliament. On top of the Victoria Tower is an iron flagstaff from which flies the Union Flag or, when the Sovereign is present in the Palace, the Royal Standard. The flag used to be flown only on days when either House of Parliament sat, but since January 2010 it has been flown every day.

== History ==
The Victoria Tower was purpose-built as a &quot;fireproof repository for books and documents&quot;, as required by the competition to rebuild the Palace of Westminster after the fire of 16 October 1834, which had destroyed the building and almost all of the records of the House of Commons. The records of the House of Lords survived the conflagration because they were, at the time, stored in the Jewel Tower, which was at a distance from the main building and still stands across the road from the Victoria Tower.

Sir Charles Barry&#x27;s design for the new Palace of Westminster featured a tower over the Sovereign&#x27;s Entrance, 12 floors of which incorporated record storage. Augustus Pugin produced most of the architectural designs and elevations for the project and also the interior design. The first stone of the Tower was laid by Queen Victoria on 22 December 1843, and construction was completed in 1860.

The tower was originally named &quot;The King&#x27;s Tower&quot; because the fire of 1834 that destroyed the old Palace of Westminster occurred during the reign of King William IV.

The Victoria Tower incorporates a cast-iron framework which, rather than the visible stonework, provides the main strength supporting the structure. When the wrought-iron flagstaff was erected, the tower became the tallest square tower in the world, at to the base of the flagstaff, and a further to the top of the crown finial at its summit.

In 1897, the King&#x27;s Tower was officially renamed as the &quot;Victoria Tower&quot; in tribute to Queen Victoria in her Diamond Jubilee year.

The Parliamentary Archives underwent a complete reconstruction between 1948 and 1963 to provide 12 floors of air-conditioned document storage, and again between 2000 and 2004 to bring it up to contemporary archive storage standards.

The records are preserved by cleaning, flattening and repairing old documents. New parchment was created for the Acts whose skins was torn. Some were pasted on linen and then covered with silk gauze to protect them.

<text>City Bell is a town located in La Plata Partido, Buenos Aires, Argentina. It is located some 10 kilometers from the city center. It forms part of the Greater La Plata urban agglomeration.

The earliest settlement in City Bell was founded around 1900 by English immigrants led by George Bell. On July 18, 1913, Bell&#x27;s heirs sold approximately 3 km² (1.1 mi²) to &quot;Sociedad Anónima de City Bell&quot; for the purpose of reselling the land in lots in the hope of founding a new town. The town, named in honor of its founder, George Bell, was authorized by the Provincial Legislature on May 10, 1914, and the City Bell station of the Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway was completed that year. The planned community grew more slowly than planned, however, and much of the grounds were used to some extent for farming. Finally, a small group of people settled down, and as the town started to grow larger, amenities were developed such as the local electric utility (1922), and a new, larger train station (1925).

City Bell was chosen as the site of the Argentine Army&#x27;s Communications Battalion 601 in 1944. Situated between Buenos Aires and La Plata along the former National Route 1 (&quot;Camino Centenario&quot;), its recreational facilities include the 200 ha (500 ac) Municipal Ecological Park, the City Bell Athletic Club (1926), which since the 1960s hosts the Regional Folklore Festival, the Teatro de Cámara, the City Bell Golf and Equestrian Clubs, the Gauguin Art Gallery (1984), and the City Bell Cultural Center (1997). The Bank of the Province of Buenos Aires also maintains its staff&#x27;s athletic club here.

<text>Kai Krause (born 14 March 1957) is a German software and graphical user interface designer, best known for founding MetaCreations Corp., for his Kai&#x27;s Power Tools series of products, and for his contributions to graphical user interface design.

==Biography==
Born in Dortmund, Germany, Krause moved to California, United States in 1976. He worked with early synthesizers and vocoders, and contributed sound effects to almost thirty records and movies. During the 1990s he ran several software companies –HSC Software, MetaTools, MetaCreations– to develop tools for graphic designers.

In February 2005, the &quot;DEMO&quot; conference acknowledged him as one of the Top 15 Innovators of the last 15 years. Krause has a Master&#x27;s degree from the Brooks Institute in Santa Barbara, California (1996), and an honorary doctorate from the University of Essen, Germany (1999). Today Krause lives and works in the 1000-year-old near Bonn in Germany.

==History==
The company which he co-founded, MetaCreations Corp., began as HSC Software, which released the first version of Kai&#x27;s Power Tools in 1992. HSC released a second version, and the first version of Bryce, and several other titles before changing their name to MetaTools in 1995. This name remained until 1997, when a rapid series of mergers with Fractal Design, RayDream, Specular, and RTG (Real-Time Geometry) necessitated a new identity for the growing organization: MetaCreations.

The interfaces of Krause&#x27;s products used soft shadows, rounded corners, and translucency prior to their wider adoption.

For the rest of the 1990s, MetaCreations continued to develop a variety of successful graphical software titles. Application and interfaces for which Krause was most directly responsible include Kai&#x27;s Power Tools, Live Picture, Bryce, Kai&#x27;s Power Show, Kai&#x27;s Power Goo, Convolver, Kai&#x27;s Photo Soap and Poser.

==Software==
* Kai&#x27;s Power Tools is now published by Corel Corporation, as &quot;The Corel KPT Collection&quot;.
* KPT Bryce is now published by Daz 3D, as simply &quot;Bryce&quot;.
* Kai&#x27;s Power Show, Kai&#x27;s Photo Soap and Kai&#x27;s Power Goo are now property of Nuance Communications. They have been discontinued.

<doc id="811640" wikidata="Q2705496" url="?curid=811640" title="Punch-Out!! (1987 video game)">
<text>originally titled is a 1987 boxing video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Part of the &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot; series, it is an adaptation of the arcade video games &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot; (1984) and &quot;Super Punch-Out!!&quot; (1984). Differences from the arcades include the addition of former undisputed world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson as the final boss. It received critical acclaim, and is retrospectively considered one of the greatest video games of all time.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Punch-Out!!&quot; features Little Mac, a young boxer fighting his way up through ranks of the World Video Boxing Association. After facing a series of colorful fictional opponents in three circuits and winning the championship in each, Little Mac enters a final &quot;Dream Fight&quot; against a highly skilled boxer. In the Gold Version, the final boss is Super Macho Man, who was also the final opponent in &quot;Super Punch-Out!!&quot;. &quot;Mike Tyson&#x27;s Punch-Out!!&quot; features Mike Tyson, the real-life World Heavyweight Champion at the time. After the license to use Tyson&#x27;s likeness expired, he was replaced by the fictional Mr. Dream.

Little Mac has a limited repertoire compared to most of his opponents. His punches are limited to left and right jabs, left and right body blows, and a powerful uppercut. The uppercut can only be used once the player earns a star, which is typically accomplished by counter-punching the opponent directly before or after certain attacks are launched. The player can acquire up to three stars, but loses them whenever Mac is hit or knocked down. To defend, Mac can dodge left or right, duck, and block punches by putting up his guard.

Little Mac has a heart counter, which decreases upon being hit, blocking a punch, or throwing a punch that the opponent dodges or blocks. When the counter decreases to zero, Little Mac temporarily turns different shades of pink and appears tired/exhausted, leaving the player unable to attack but still able to dodge, duck, and block. At this point, Mac can regain some hearts and his normal color palette only by avoiding the opponent&#x27;s punches. He immediately loses all of his hearts upon being knocked down, but can regain some by getting up.

A bout can end by knockout (KO), if a fighter is unable to get up within ten seconds after being knocked down; by technical knockout (TKO), if a fighter is knocked down three times in one round; or by decision, if the bout lasts three full rounds without a clear winner. In order to win by decision, the player must accumulate a certain point total by punching the opponent. Some bouts cannot be won in this manner and will automatically result in a loss for the player if the opponent is not knocked out. Mac can only get up three times during any one bout; if he is knocked down a fourth time, he will be unable to rise and thus lose by knockout.

When Mac loses his first bout to a ranked opponent, he will have a chance to fight a rematch. However, if he loses a Title Bout, he will fall in the rankings – one place for the Minor or Major Circuits, two places for the World Circuit. Losing a rematch causes him to fall one place (unless he is already at the bottom of his circuit), forcing him to fight his way back up. A third loss, or a loss in the Dream Fight, ends the game.

===Characters===

Little Mac faces a total of 14 opponents: three in the Minor Circuit, four in the Major Circuit, six in the World Circuit, and Mike Tyson or Mr. Dream. All character sprites except King Hippo are reused for two characters each, with changes made to colors, head, or special moves. Mario has a cameo as the referee. Three opponents from the Minor and Major Circuits reappear in the World Circuit, with new attacks that force the player to devise a new strategy.

==Development==
&quot;Punch-Out!!&quot; was developed by Nintendo Research &amp; Development No. 3. Genyo Takeda (the producer of the &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot; arcade games), was the director of the NES game. Because the NES was not as powerful as the arcade hardware, they could not recreate the arcade graphics. Instead of making the playable boxer wire-framed or transparent in order to see the opponent, they made the playable boxer smaller and named him Little Mac, a 17-year-old boxer weighing about 107 pounds. The behavior of each opposing boxer follows a set pattern requiring trial and error and memorization to defeat them.

===Music===
The theme song for &quot;Punch Out!!&quot; is &quot;Look Sharp-Be Sharp&quot;, composed by Mahlon Merrick. It originated with the radio and TV program &quot;Gillette Cavalcade of Sports&quot; (1942–1960). The opening theme of some characters are classical and folk themes: Glass Joe has the French national anthem, &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;; Von Kaiser, Great Tiger, and Super Macho Man have &quot;Ride of the Valkyries&quot; by Wagner; Piston Honda has Japanese folk song &quot;Sakura&quot;; Don Flamenco has the prelude to the opera set in Spain, &quot;Carmen&quot; by Georges Bizet; and Soda Popinski has Russian folk song &quot;The Song of the Volga Boatmen&quot;.

==Release==
===Gold version===
Before the public release of &quot;Mike Tyson&#x27;s Punch-Out!!&quot;, Nintendo released it in a gold-colored Famicom cartridge titled &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot; in Japan, without Mike Tyson, as a prize for participating in the Famicom Disk System&#x27;s &quot;Family Computer Golf: U.S. Course&quot; tournament held in September 1987. 10,000 units were producedhalf were given as high score prizes, and the rest were given as a lottery prize. Its final opponent is Super Macho Man, who is also the final opponent in the arcade game &quot;Super Punch-Out!!&quot;.

===&quot;Mike Tyson&#x27;s Punch-Out!!&quot;===

Around the time the Gold Version was released for Nintendo&#x27;s US Golf Tournament competition, Nintendo of America&#x27;s founder and former president Minoru Arakawa attended a boxing match during the Heavyweight unification series that featured its future champion Mike Tyson. Arakawa became so astonished with the athlete&#x27;s &quot;power and skill&quot; that he was inspired to use his likeness and the tournament itself in the upcoming game. Tyson was rumored to have been paid $50,000 for a three-year period for his likeness. This transaction was something of a risk for Nintendo, as it occurred before Tyson won the World Boxing Council (WBC) heavyweight championship from Trevor Berbick on November 22, 1986, which greatly increased the profit for the game. Nintendo would release the Mike Tyson version of &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot; in Japan soon after its North American release.

=== &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot; ===
&quot;Mike Tyson&#x27;s Punch-Out!!&quot; was rebranded to simply &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot;, and re-released in the U.S. and Europe in 1990 and 1991, respectively. When Nintendo&#x27;s license had expired with Mike Tyson, his likeness was replaced by a fictional character named Mr. Dream. This version of the game was used in all major re-releases, including the Virtual Console, &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; for GameCube, the NES Classic Edition, and on the Nintendo Switch Online subscription service (which Mike Tyson humorously contested).

==Reception==
More than copies of &quot;Mike Tyson&#x27;s Punch-Out!!&quot; were sold in North America by 1988. It is one of two NES games to reach this sales milestone that year, along with &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;.

&quot;Punch-Out!!&quot; was well received by critics. In 1989, &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; magazine said the NES version of &quot;the great boxing arcade game&quot; had &quot;big, brilliantly drawn and animated sprites, a brilliant control method and utterly superlative gameplay&quot;, making it &quot;definitely THE best boxing game available on any machine&quot;. &quot;ACE&quot; magazine in 1989 listed it as the second highest-rated NES game, after &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; They stated it bashes &quot;the proverbial s@*t out of any other home boxing game on any other console or computer&quot; and it proves &quot;that even if Nintendo&#x27;s hardware may be technologically naff, they can still squeeze an excellent game onto a cartridge&quot;.

A &quot;GameSpot&quot; reader poll ranked it as the 6th greatest NES game. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; magazine ranked it as the 17th best game for a Nintendo system in its Top 200 Games list. In August 2008, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; listed it as the sixth best NES game, praising it for putting arcade-style fun over realism. Historian Steve L. Kent called it the second major game of 1987. Author Nathan Lockard cited the graphics, violence, controls, and the variety for making it a &quot;true classic&quot; and one of the best NES games. In 2005, &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot; is on &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s list of the greatest games of all time. Editor Shawn Laib of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; ranked it 7th out of the 15 Best NES Games of All Time, and Esquire&#x27;s Dom Nero and Cameron Sherrill ranked it fifth.

&quot;GamesRadar&quot; ranked it the 11th best NES game ever made, calling it a &quot;brilliant puzzle game [disguised] as a sports game&quot;. &quot;Game Informer&quot; ranked &quot;Mike Tyson&#x27;s Punch-Out!!&quot; as its 14th favorite game ever in 2001. The staff noted that no boxing game since has been as &quot;beloved&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; named it the 7th best NES game. &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; ranked the game 74th in a list of greatest Nintendo games.

==In media==
On &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on October 29, 2014, Mike Tyson was challenged by host Jimmy Fallon to play the game on live TV. The virtual Tyson defeated the real Tyson in the first round by TKO.

While interrogating a murder suspect in &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot;″ Season 5 episode &quot;The Box&quot;, Detective Jake Peralta laments the difficulty of beating the Punch-Out!! character Great Tiger as he teleports around the ring. To which the accused confidently asserts, &quot;I beat him every time. You just punch him when he gets dizzy.&quot;

<text>The Amsterdam Tournament () was a pre-season association football competition, held in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The competition was hosted by Eredivisie club Ajax at the Amsterdam Arena. It was inaugurated in 1975 as the Amsterdam 700 Tournament to celebrate 700 years of history in the city. It was held annually each summer until 1992, when the last edition of the original tournament was played. It returned in 1999 with the backing of the International Event Partnership (IEP). Four teams participate in the competition, played in a league format since 1986.

Since its return, the tournament has used an unusual point scoring system. As with most league competitions, three points are awarded for a win, one for a draw and zero for a loss. An additional point, however, is awarded for each goal scored. The system is designed to reward teams that adopt a more attacking style of play. Each entrant plays two matches, with the winner being the club that finishes at the top of the table. The original competition was held at Amsterdam&#x27;s Olympic Stadium, where Ajax played its international games until 1996. The Amsterdam Arena, now named the Johan Cruyff Arena, has played host to the event since the return until 2009.

The first winners were Belgian club Molenbeek, who defeated Ajax 5–2 in the final. The hosts are the most successful club in the tournament&#x27;s history, having lifted the trophy on ten occasions. The club won their first title in 1978 and their most recent success came in 2004. Fellow Dutch side AZ and English club Arsenal are the only other teams to have won the competition more than once. Feyenoord, Ajax&#x27;s domestic rivals, are among a group of clubs to have won the tournament once, while Belgium has produced the most individual winners, four, one more than England and Netherlands.

AZ and Arsenal are also the most regular guests, having been invited to compete in the tournament on six occasions. As well as being the most successful club, Ajax has finished as runners-up eleven times. Next in the list are two Italian clubs, Internazionale and Roma, who has finished in second place five times between them. Romania is the only national team to have taken part in the tournament. They were invited in 1984 and finished in fourth place as Atlético Mineiro became the first Brazilian club to lift the trophy. In total, teams from 13 countries have participated in the competition. The 2010 edition did not take place due to Ajax&#x27;s involvement in the qualifying stages of the Champions League.

<doc id="811651" wikidata="Q471005" url="?curid=811651" title="The Mysterious Island">
<text>The Mysterious Island () is a novel by Jules Verne, serialised from August 1874 to September 1875 and then published in book form in November 1875. The first edition, published by Hetzel, contains illustrations by Jules Férat. The novel is a crossover sequel to Verne&#x27;s famous &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot; (1870) and &quot;In Search of the Castaways&quot; (1867–68), though its themes are vastly different from those books. An early draft of the novel, rejected by Verne&#x27;s publisher and wholly reconceived before publication, was titled &quot;Shipwrecked Family: Marooned with Uncle Robinson&quot;, indicating the influence of the novels &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; and &quot;The Swiss Family Robinson&quot;. Verne developed a similar theme in his novel, &quot;Godfrey Morgan&quot; (French: &quot;L&#x27;École des Robinsons&quot;, 1882).

The chronology of &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot; is incompatible with that of &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot;, which begins in 1866, while &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot; begins during the American Civil War, yet is supposed to happen 16 years after &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues&quot;.

==Plot summary==
During the American Civil War, five Northern prisoners of war escape during the Siege of Richmond, Virginia, by hijacking a hydrogen-filled observation balloon. The escapees are Cyrus Smith, a railroad engineer in the Union army (named Cyrus Harding in Kingston&#x27;s translation); his ex-slave and loyal follower Neb (short for Nebuchadnezzar); Bonadventure Pencroff, a sailor (who is addressed only by his surname; in Kingston&#x27;s version, he is named Pencroft); his protégé and adopted son Harbert Brown (called Herbert in some translations); and the journalist Gedéon Spilett (Gideon Spilett in English versions). The company is completed by Cyrus&#x27;s dog &quot;Top&quot;.

After flying in a great storm for several days, the group crash-lands on a cliff-bound, volcanic, unknown island, described as being located at (Southern Pacific Ocean/Asian:Oceanian side), about east of New Zealand and about from Virginia. They name it &quot;Lincoln Island&quot; in honor of Abraham Lincoln. With the knowledge of the brilliant engineer Smith, the five are able to sustain themselves on the island, producing fire, pottery, bricks, nitroglycerin, iron, an electric telegraph, a cave home inside a stony cliff called &quot;Granite House&quot;, and even a seaworthy ship, which they name the &quot;Bonadventure&quot;. They start to think of themselves as colonists rather than castaways.

During their stay on the island, the &quot;colonists&quot; endure bad weather and domesticate an orangutan, Jupiter, abbreviated to Jup (or Joop, in Jordan Stump&#x27;s translation). There is a mystery on the island in the form of an unseen &quot;deus ex machina&quot;, responsible for Cyrus&#x27; survival after falling from the balloon, the mysterious rescue of Top from a dugong, the appearance of a box of equipment (guns and ammunition, tools, etc.), and other seemingly inexplicable occurrences.

The group finds a message in a bottle directing them to rescue a castaway on nearby Tabor Island, who is none other than Tom Ayrton (from &quot;In Search of the Castaways&quot;). On the return voyage to Lincoln Island, they lose their way in a tempest but are guided back to their course by a mysterious fire beacon.

Ayrton&#x27;s former companions arrive by chance on Lincoln Island and try to make it into their lair. After some fighting with the protagonists, the pirate ship is mysteriously destroyed by an explosion. Six of the pirates survive and kidnap Ayrton. When the colonists look for him, the pirates shoot Harbert, seriously injuring him. Harbert survives, narrowly evading death. The colonists at first assume Ayrton has been killed, but later they find evidence that he was not instantly killed, leaving his fate uncertain. When the colonists rashly attempt to return to Granite House before Harbert fully recovers, Harbert contracts malaria but is saved by a box of quinine sulfate, which mysteriously appears on the table in Granite House. After Harbert recovers, they attempt to rescue Ayrton and destroy the pirates. They discover Ayrton at the sheepfold, and the pirates dead, without any visible wounds except for a little red spot on each of them.

The island is revealed to be Captain Nemo&#x27;s hideout, and home port of the &quot;Nautilus&quot;. Having escaped the maelstrom at the end of &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot;, the &quot;Nautilus&quot; sailed the oceans of the world until all its crew except Nemo had died. Now an old man, Nemo returned the &quot;Nautilus&quot; to its secret port within Lincoln Island. Nemo had been the mysterious benefactor of the settlers, providing them with the box of equipment, sending the message revealing Ayrton, planting the torpedo that destroyed the pirate ship, and killing the pirates with an &quot;electric gun&quot;. On his death bed, Captain Nemo reveals his true identity as the lost Indian Prince Dakkar, son of a raja of the then-independent territory of Bundelkund and a nephew of the Indian hero Tippu-Sahib. After taking part in the failed Indian Rebellion of 1857, Prince Dakkar escaped to a desert island with twenty of his compatriots and commenced the building of the &quot;Nautilus&quot; and adopted the new name of &quot;Captain Nemo&quot;. Before he dies, Nemo gives them a box of diamonds and pearls as a keepsake. Nemo&#x27;s final words are &quot;God and my country!&quot; (&quot;Independence!&quot;, in Verne&#x27;s original manuscript). The &quot;Nautilus&quot; is scuttled and serves as Captain Nemo&#x27;s tomb.

Afterward, the island&#x27;s central volcano erupts, destroying the island. Jup the orangutan falls into a crack in the ground and dies. The colonists, forewarned of the eruption by Nemo, find shelter on the last remaining piece of the island above sea level. They are rescued by the ship &quot;Duncan&quot;, which had come to rescue Ayrton, but was redirected by a message Nemo had previously left on Tabor Island. After they return to the United States they form a new colony in Iowa, financed with Nemo&#x27;s gifts.

==Publication history in English==
In the United States the first English printing began in &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Monthly&quot;, April 1874, as a serial. In September 1875 Sampson Low, Marston Low, and Searle published the first British edition of &quot;Mysterious Island&quot; in three volumes entitled &quot;Dropped from the Clouds&quot;, &quot;The Abandoned&quot;, and &quot;The Secret of the Island&quot; (195,000 words). In November 1875 Scribner&#x27;s published the American edition of these volumes from the English plates of Sampson Low. The purported translator, W. H. G. Kingston, was a famous author of boys&#x27; adventure and sailing stories who had fallen on hard times in the 1870s due to business failures, and so he hired out to Sampson Low as the translator for these volumes. However, it is now known that the translator of &quot;Mysterious Island&quot; and his other Verne novels was actually his wife, Agnes Kinloch Kingston, who had studied on the continent in her youth. The Kingston translation changes the names of the hero from &quot;Smith&quot; to &quot;Harding&quot;; &quot;Smith&quot; is a very common name in the UK and would have been associated, at that time, with the lower classes. In addition many technical passages were abridged or omitted and the anti-imperialist sentiments of the dying Captain Nemo were purged so as not to offend English readers. This became the standard translation for more than a century.

In 1876 the Stephen W. White translation (175,000 words) appeared first in the columns of &quot;The Evening Telegraph&quot; of Philadelphia and subsequently as an Evening Telegraph Reprint Book. This translation is more faithful to the original story and restores the death scene of Captain Nemo, but there is still condensation and omission of some sections such as Verne&#x27;s description of how a sawmill works. In the 20th century two more abridged translations appeared: the Fitzroy Edition (Associated Booksellers, 1959) abridged by I. O. Evans (90,000 words) and &quot;Mysterious Island&quot; (Bantam, 1970) abridged by Lowell Bair (90,000 words).

Except for the Complete and Unabridged Classics Series CL77 published in 1965 (Airmont Publishing Company, Inc), no other unabridged translations appeared until 2001 when the illustrated version of Sidney Kravitz appeared (Wesleyan University Press) almost simultaneously with the new translation of Jordan Stump published by Random House Modern Library (2001). Kravitz also translated &quot;Shipwrecked Family: Marooned With Uncle Robinson&quot;, published by the North American Jules Verne Society and BearManor Fiction in 2011.

==&quot;Wrecked on a Reef&quot; influence==
The 2003 English edition of &quot;Wrecked on a Reef&quot; (1869), a memoir by French shipwreck survivor François Édouard Raynal, has additional appendices by French scholar Christiane Mortelier who presents a case for the influence of Raynal&#x27;s book on Verne&#x27;s &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;. The &quot;Grafton&quot; was wrecked near New Zealand on the Auckland Islands on 3 January 1864, where the crew of five survived for 19 months before obtaining rescue. &quot;Wrecked on a Reef&quot;, Raynal&#x27;s memoir of the incident, was very popular at the time of publication, being translated into multiple languages. According to Mortelier, Verne read Raynal&#x27;s account and loosely based his novel on the true life story of &quot;Grafton&quot; shipwreck, survival, privation, and ultimate rescue.

==Translations in Indian languages==
The novel has been translated into Marathi by B. R. Bhagwat titled &#x27;निर्जन बेटावरचे धाडसी वीर&#x27;, which roughly translates as &quot;Brave Fighters on a Deserted Island&quot;, and has a cult following in Maharashtra. The novel has also been translated to Malayalam, as &quot;Nigoodadweep&quot;, translated by Kesavan Nambisan. There is more than one translation in Bengali. The translation by Kuladaranjan Roy is called “আশ্চর্য দ্বীপ” (&quot;Aschorjo Dwip&quot;) and was republished by Kalpabiswa Publications in 2023. Another translation by Shamsuddin Nawab from Sheba Prokashoni, published in 1979, is called &quot;Rahosshor Dip&quot;.

==Notes==
* In the French original, some characters were named a little differently: Gédéon Spillet, Nabuchodonosor (Nab) and Harbert Brown. In the Kingston translation, the engineer is named Cyrus Harding, and the sailor is named Pencroft.
* There are discrepancies in continuity between this novel and &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot;. Although this novel was written in 1874, its events take place from 1865 to 1869. The events of &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot; take place between 1867 and 1868. For example, the Captain Nemo appearing in this novel dies at a time when the Captain Nemo in &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot; was still alive. There is usually a note in most editions of the book admitting date discrepancies. There are also similar discrepancies with &quot;In Search of the Castaways&quot;, although, these are not as often pointed out. Another error is that Neb is depicted as Smith&#x27;s former slave. But since Smith is identified as being from Massachusetts, where slavery was abolished in the 1780s, Neb would never have been a slave.

<text>Little Kit&#x27;s Coty House, also known as Lower Kit&#x27;s Coty House and the Countless Stones, is a chambered long barrow located near to the village of Aylesford in the southeastern English county of Kent. Constructed &quot;circa&quot; 4000 BCE, during the Early Neolithic period of British prehistory, today it survives in a ruined state.

Archaeologists have established that the monument was built by pastoralist communities shortly after the introduction of agriculture to Britain from continental Europe. Although representing part of an architectural tradition of long barrow building that was widespread across Neolithic Europe, Kit&#x27;s Coty House belongs to a localised regional variant of barrows produced in the vicinity of the River Medway, now known as the Medway Megaliths. Of these, it lies near to both Kit&#x27;s Coty House and the Coffin Stone on the eastern side of the river. Three further surviving long barrows, Addington Long Barrow, Chestnuts Long Barrow, and Coldrum Long Barrow, are located west of the Medway.

Now a jumble of half-buried sarsen stones it is thought to have been a tomb similar to that of the Coldrum Stones. The name is derived from the belief that the chaotic pile of stones from the collapsed tomb were uncountable and various stories are told about the fate of those who tried. Another nearby site that may have been Neolithic is at Cossington. 
There are between 19 and 21 stones depending on the authority. They were pushed over in the seventeenth century seemingly before any antiquarian interest was taken in them. William Stukeley attempted to reconstruct the damaged tomb in plan in the eighteenth century.

Archaeological evaluation trenching in 1989 found no clear evidence of any surrounding quarry ditch which would normally have been excavated to provide material for a covering barrow.

==Name and location==

Little Kit&#x27;s Coty House is also known as Lower Kits Coty, and as the Countless Stones. The site is enclosed in iron railings and permanently open to visitors. It is approximately south of another of the Medway Megaliths, Kit&#x27;s Coty House. It is about northeast of Aylesford, and is signposted from the Rochester Road.

==Context==

The Early Neolithic was a revolutionary period of British history. Between 4500 and 3800 BCE, it saw a widespread change in lifestyle as the communities living in the British Isles adopted agriculture as their primary form of subsistence, abandoning the hunter-gatherer lifestyle that had characterised the preceding Mesolithic period. This came about through contact with continental European societies, although it is unclear to what extent this can be attributed to an influx of migrants or to indigenous Mesolithic Britons adopting agricultural technologies from the continent. The region of modern Kent would have been key for the arrival of continental European settlers and visitors, because of its position on the estuary of the River Thames and its proximity to the continent.

Britain was then largely forested; widespread forest clearance did not occur in Kent until the Late Bronze Age (c.1000 to 700 BCE). Environmental data from the vicinity of the White Horse Stone, a putatively prehistoric monolith near the River Medway, supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and amygdaloideae. Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the island&#x27;s Early Neolithic economy was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic life.

===Medway Megaliths===

Across Western Europe, the Early Neolithic marked the first period in which humans built monumental structures in the landscape. These structures included chambered long barrows, rectangular or oval earthen tumuli which had a chamber built into one end. Some of these chambers were constructed out of timber, although others were built using large stones, now known as &quot;megaliths&quot;. These long barrows often served as tombs, housing the physical remains of the dead within their chamber. Individuals were rarely buried alone in the Early Neolithic, instead being interred in collective burials with other members of their community. These chambered tombs were built all along the Western European seaboard during the Early Neolithic, from southeastern Spain up to southern Sweden, taking in most of the British Isles; the architectural tradition was introduced to Britain from continental Europe in the first half of the fourth millennium BCE. Although there are stone buildings—like Göbekli Tepe in modern Turkey—which predate them, the chambered long barrows constitute humanity&#x27;s first widespread tradition of construction using stone.

Although now all in a ruinous state and not retaining their original appearance, at the time of construction the Medway Megaliths would have been some of the largest and most visually imposing Early Neolithic funerary monuments in Britain. Grouped along the River Medway as it cuts through the North Downs, they constitute the most southeasterly group of megalithic monuments in the British Isles, and the only megalithic group in eastern England. The archaeologists Brian Philp and Mike Dutto deemed the Medway Megaliths to be &quot;some of the most interesting and well known&quot; archaeological sites in Kent, while the archaeologist Paul Ashbee described them as &quot;the most grandiose and impressive structures of their kind in southern England&quot;.

The Medway Megaliths can be divided into two separate clusters: one to the west of the River Medway and the other on Blue Bell Hill to the east, with the distance between the two clusters measuring at between and . The western group includes Coldrum Long Barrow, Addington Long Barrow, and the Chestnuts Long Barrow. The eastern group consists of Smythe&#x27;s Megalith, Kit&#x27;s Coty House, and Little Kit&#x27;s Coty House, while various stones on the eastern side of the river, most notably the Coffin Stone and White Horse Stone, may also have been parts of such structures. It is not known if they were all built at the same time, or whether they were constructed in succession, while similarly it is not known if they each served the same function or whether there was a hierarchy in their usage.

The Medway long barrows all conformed to the same general design plan, and are all aligned on an east to west axis. Each had a stone chamber at the eastern end of the mound, and they each probably had a stone facade flanking the entrance. They had internal heights of up to , making them taller than most other chambered long barrows in Britain. The chambers were constructed from sarsen, a dense, hard, and durable stone that occurs naturally throughout Kent, having formed out of sand from the Eocene epoch. Early Neolithic builders would have selected blocks from the local area, and then transported them to the site of the monument to be erected.

These common architectural features among the Medway Megaliths indicate a strong regional cohesion with no direct parallels elsewhere in the British Isles. Nevertheless, as with other regional groupings of Early Neolithic long barrows—such as the Cotswold-Severn group in south-western Britain—there are also various idiosyncrasies in the different monuments, such as Coldrum&#x27;s rectilinear shape, the Chestnut Long Barrow&#x27;s facade, and the long, thin mounds at Addington and Kit&#x27;s Coty. These variations might have been caused by the tombs being altered and adapted over the course of their use; in this scenario, the monuments would be composite structures.

The people who built these monuments were probably influenced by pre-existing tomb-shrines that they were already aware of. Whether those people had grown up locally, or moved into the Medway area from elsewhere is not known. Based on a stylistic analysis of their architectural designs, the archaeologist Stuart Piggott thought that the plan behind the Medway Megaliths had originated in the area around the Low Countries, while fellow archaeologist Glyn Daniel instead believed that the same evidence showed an influence from Scandinavia. John H. Evans instead suggested an origin in Germany, and Ronald F. Jessup thought that their origins could be seen in the Cotswold-Severn megalithic group. Ashbee noted that their close clustering in the same area was reminiscent of the megalithic tomb-shrine traditions of continental Northern Europe, and emphasised that the Medway Megaliths were a regional manifestation of a tradition widespread across Early Neolithic Europe. He nevertheless stressed that a precise place of origin was &quot;impossible to indicate&quot; with the available evidence.

==Design and construction==

In 2005, Philp and Dutto noted that there were about 21 stones at the site. Jessup called it a &quot;confused group&quot;, while the archaeologist Timothy Champion termed it &quot;a jumble&quot;. Many of these would have once formed part of a chamber at the eastern end of a long, rectangular earthen mound. Philp and Dutto believed that some of the stones were from the long barrow&#x27;s chamber and others from its façade, adding that it was &quot;just possible&quot; to suggest which is which.

The sarsens found at Little Kit&#x27;s Coty House are among the largest known from the Medway Megaliths. Using their measurements as a basis, Ashbee proposed that the chamber would have been long, wide, and high. He suggested that, when the monument was viewed from the east, it became clear that the stones had fallen to the north from their original positions. He believed that if the site were fully excavated, the holes in which the sarsen stones originally stood could might be identified, allowing for the chamber to be reconstructed in a manner similar to that at Chestnuts Long Barrow.

Jessup believed that it was &quot;impossible to trace the form of the original structure&quot;. Ashbee thought it might have once been &quot;one of the more massive&quot; of the Medway Megaliths, with Champion concurring, suggesting that the long barrow would have been at least in width and possibly over in length. The mound may have been encircled by a ditch, since filled in by hillwash.

===Meaning and purpose===
Britain&#x27;s Early Neolithic communities placed greater emphasis on the ritual burial of the dead than their Mesolithic forebears. Archaeologists have suggested that this is because Early Neolithic Britons adhered to an ancestor cult that venerated the spirits of the dead, believing that they could intercede with the forces of nature for the benefit of their living descendants. The archaeologist Robin Holgate stressed that rather than simply being tombs, the Medway Megaliths were &quot;communal monuments fulfilling a social function for the communities who built and used them&quot;. Thus, it has been suggested that Early Neolithic people entered into the tombs—which doubled as temples or shrines—to perform rituals honouring the dead and requesting their assistance. For this reason, the historian Ronald Hutton termed these monuments &quot;tomb-shrines&quot; to reflect their dual purpose.

In Britain, these tombs were typically located on prominent hills and slopes overlooking the landscape, perhaps at the junction between different territories. The archaeologist Caroline Malone noted that the tombs would have served as one of various landscape markers that conveyed information on &quot;territory, political allegiance, ownership, and ancestors&quot;. Many archaeologists have subscribed to the idea that these tomb-shrines were territorial markers between different tribes; others have argued that such markers would be of little use to a nomadic herding society. Instead it has been suggested that they represent markers along herding pathways. The archaeologist Richard Bradley suggested that the construction of these monuments reflects an attempt to mark control and ownership over the land, thus reflecting a change in mindset brought about by the transition from the hunter-gatherer Mesolithic to the pastoralist Early Neolithic. Others have suggested that these monuments were built on sites already deemed sacred by Mesolithic hunter-gatherers.

==Damage and dilapidation==

All the surviving megalithic tombs from the Early Neolithic period have suffered from neglect and the ravages of agriculture. Little Kit&#x27;s Coty House has been damaged on more than one occasion.
In 1773, Douglas was told that a farmer had dismantled the monument to use its stones for road metal but that the stones proved too large for this purpose.

==Folklore, folk tradition, and modern Paganism==

In 1722, the antiquarian Hercules Ayleway noted—in a letter written to his friend, the fellow antiquarian William Stukeley—a local belief that the Lower Kit&#x27;s Coty House and Kit&#x27;s Coty House were erected in memory of two contending kings of Kent who died in battle.

The archaeologist and folklorist Leslie Grinsell believed that the countless stones motif would only have been applied to the site after the chamber had been toppled, something he suggested had occurred around 1690.
Grinsell noted that as of the mid-twentieth century, that folklore was still extant, citing the discovery of numbers written in chalk on the different stones.

Several modern Pagan religions are practised at the Medway Megaliths, the most publicly visible of which is Druidry. Research conducted among these Druids in 2014 revealed that some Druidic activity had taken place at Little Kit&#x27;s Coty House but that at least one Druid disliked performing rituals there because of the noise produced by nearby power cables.

==Antiquarian and archaeological investigation==

The antiquarian John Aubrey referenced a range of prehistoric sites across Britain in his manuscript, &quot;Monumenta Britannica&quot;, written over the course of 1663 to 1693. In this manuscript, he quoted from a letter sent to him by Dr Thomas Gale, the Master of St Paul&#x27;s School in London. In the letter, Gale reported that &quot;In the field next to this [Kit&#x27;s Coty House] nearer to Ailsford, are 13 or 14 great stones; seven standing, all covered with one large stone, the rest are fallen down. The people call this also Kit&#x27;s Coty-house.&quot; Aubrey&#x27;s book was not published until several centuries later, and it is possible that the site was further damaged in the years following Gale&#x27;s letter.

The antiquarian William Stukeley visited the area in 1722. At this point the stones had already been pulled down; from a letter sent to him that year by Hercules Ayleway it appears that the chamber was dismantled around thirty years prior. Ayleway had written that &quot;I have been informed by some who remember it standing that the stones which composed the wall did all of them joyn [sic] close together so as to touch each other, and the dore [sic] was on the west side thereof, next the road.&quot; Stukeley produced several illustrations of the site, which were published posthumously. One, produced in October 1722 and used as the basis for a public plate, includes Little Kit&#x27;s Coty House as a cove in the foreground, while Kit&#x27;s Coty House — including its barrow — can be seen in the background. However, his depiction of the monument differs in these two illustrations, rendering their accuracy unreliable. Also causing issues is that in Stukeley&#x27;s illustrations, the chamber entrance is not at the western end, as Ayleway claimed it was.

In 1782, Edward Hasted published details of the site, perhaps drawn from information supplied by William Boys of Sandwich. His publication included an engraving of the site; Ashbee later noted that this illustration was &quot;romanticised&quot;. Hasted&#x27;s suggestion was that the site had been damaged by treasure hunters. Later that century, mention of Little Kit&#x27;s Coty House was also made in the published work of W. H. Ireland, and John Thorpe. Thorpe added the suggestion that the monument had been destroyed so that its stones could be used for dockyard paving. In an 1824 issue of the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, a note on the site was published by Edward Rudge. He included an illustration of the site. Describing the site as &quot;a Druidical monument consisting of five or six cromlechs&quot;, he added that digging beneath one of the stones had revealed human bone and armour.

It is in the 1840s that several brief references to the site appeared which first called it the Countless Stones. In the early 1840s, the Reverend Beale Post conducted investigations into the Medway Megaliths, writing them up in a manuscript that was left unpublished; this included Little Kit&#x27;s Coty House. He disputed both Hasted and Thorpe&#x27;s ideas about how the monument had been destroyed, suggesting that instead a sepulchral cavity had given way, after which the impact of the weather brought the chamber crashing down. In 1871, Edwin Dunkin published a plan of the site; his differed from that of Rudge, perhaps reflecting the changes that had occurred at the site in the intervening period.

In 1883, both this site and Kit&#x27;s Coty House were visited by the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers. He communicated with the landowner, H. A. Brassey, who believed that both sites should be protected under the new Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882. In 1897, the site was declared a protected monument, two years after Kit&#x27;s Coty House had. Meanwhile, in 1893, the antiquarian George Payne mentioned the monument in his &quot;Collectanea Cantiana&quot;, describing it as a &quot;fallen cromlech&quot; and noting that there were various other megaliths scattered in the vicinity, suggesting that these were part of the monument or another like it, since destroyed. In 1907, F. J. Bennett published a &quot;Sketch Plan of the Countless Stones&quot;, and in 1908 George Clinch published a photograph of it. Clinch&#x27;s photograph features the substantial trees located near the site which were still extant in the 1930s but were later removed. In his 1924 publication dealing with Kent, the archaeologist O. G. S. Crawford, then working as the archaeological officer for the Ordnance Survey, listed Lower Kit&#x27;s Coty House alongside the other Medway Megaliths, like Bennett referring to it as the Countless Stones.

In 1994, a pipe trench was cut alongside the site, during which evidence of a ditch below ploughsoil and hillwash was found.

<text>The Ranger School is a 62-day United States Army small unit tactics and leadership course that develops functional skills directly related to units whose mission is to engage the enemy in close combat and direct fire battles. Ranger training was established in September 1950 at Fort Benning, Georgia (now called Fort Moore). The Ranger course has changed little since its inception. Until recently, it was an eight-week course divided into three phases. The course is now 61 days in duration and divided into three phases as follows: Benning Phase, Mountain Phase, and Swamp Phase.

== Overview ==

The Ranger School is open to U.S. military personnel from the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Space Force, as well as selected students from other nations allied with the United States. The course is conducted in various locations. Benning Phase occurs in and around Camp Rogers and Camp Darby at Fort Moore, Georgia. Mountain Phase is conducted at Camp Merrill, in the remote mountains near Dahlonega, Georgia. Swamp Phase is conducted in the coastal swamps at various locations near Camp Rudder, Eglin Air Force Base in Florida.

The school is not organizationally affiliated with the 75th Ranger Regiment. Ranger School falls under control of the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command as a school open to most members of the United States Army, but the 75th Ranger Regiment is a Special Operations warfighting unit organized under the United States Army Special Operations Command. The two share a common heritage and subordinate battalions common lineage, and Ranger School is a requirement for all officers and non-commissioned officers (NCO) of the 75th Ranger Regiment.

Those graduating from Ranger School are presented with the Ranger Tab, which is worn on the upper shoulder of the left sleeve of a military uniform, according to U.S. Army regulations Wearing the tab is permitted for the remainder of a soldier&#x27;s military career. The cloth version of the tab is worn on the Army Combat Uniform and Army Green Service Uniform; a smaller, metal version is worn on the Army Service Uniform.

== History ==

Ranger Training had begun in September 1950 at Fort Benning Georgia &quot;with the formation and training of 17 Airborne Companies by the Ranger Training Command&quot;. The first class graduated from Ranger training in November 1950, becoming the 1st Ranger Infantry Company. The United States Army&#x27;s Infantry School officially established the Ranger Department in December 1951. Under the Ranger Department, the first Ranger School Class was conducted in January–March 1952, with a graduation date of 1 March 1952. Its duration was 59 days. At the time, Ranger training was voluntary.

In 1966, a panel headed by General Ralph E. Haines Jr. recommended making Ranger training mandatory for all Regular Army officers upon commissioning. On 16 August 1966, the Chief of Staff of the Army, General Harold K. Johnson, directed it so. This policy was implemented in July 1967. It was rescinded on 21 June 1972 by General William Westmoreland. Once again, Ranger training was voluntary.

In August 1987, the Ranger Department was split from the Infantry School and the Ranger Training Brigade was established.
The Ranger Companies that made up the Ranger Department became the current training units—the 4th, 5th and 6th Ranger Training Battalions.

Desert Phase was added in 1983 and the length of the Ranger course was extended to 65 days. The duration was again expanded in October 1991 to 68 days, concurrently with the reshuffling of the Desert phase from the last phase to the second. The 7th Ranger Training Battalion was added to administer this phase. The most recent duration change to Ranger School occurred in May 1995, when the Desert Phase was removed from the Ranger course. Ranger School was reduced to its current 61-day length of training, at 19.6 hours of training per day.

The Ranger Assessment Phase, the first five days of Ranger School, was added in 1992.

In 2015 Ranger School was permanently opened to women.

== Students ==

Ranger School is open to all Military Occupational Specialties (MOSs) in the U.S. Army, although—as of April 2011—an Army combat exclusion zone still limits some from attending. Ranger students come from units in the United States Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard, and from foreign military services. However, the two largest groups of attendees for Ranger School are from the U.S. Army&#x27;s Infantry Basic Officer Leadership Course (IBOLC), and the 75th Ranger Regiment. Competitions and pre-Ranger courses are typically used to determine attendance. The Marine Corps is only allotted twenty slots for Ranger school each year, while the Air Force is only allotted six.

Ranger students typically range in rank from Private First Class to Captain, with lieutenants and specialists making up the largest group. The average age of a student is 23, and the average class consists of 366 students, with 11 classes conducted per year. The vast majority of Ranger students have already graduated from Airborne School, and will make multiple jumps during the course. However, a small number of students have entered and completed Ranger School without being Airborne qualified. These individuals completed tasks assigned by cadre instead of taking part in the jumps alongside their classmates.

Following the graduation of Captain Kristen Marie Griest and First Lieutenant Shaye Lynne Haver in August 2015, the Army announced that Ranger School would henceforth be open to female students. While acknowledging that in the past he &quot;would have doubted a woman could pass the rigorous course&quot;, Brigade Command Sergeant Major Curtis Arnold described Griest and Haver as &quot;tough soldiers&quot; who &quot;proved their mettle beyond a doubt&quot; and &quot;absolutely earned the respect of every ranger instructor&quot;. In October 2015, Major Lisa Jaster also graduated from Ranger School, becoming the first female Army Reserve officer to receive a Ranger tab. In 2019, First Lieutenant Chelsey Hibsch became the first female Air Force officer to graduate from Ranger School. In 2024, Captain Molly Murphy became the first female Army nurse to graduate from Ranger School.

== Training ==

Ranger School training has a basic scenario: the flourishing drug and terrorist operations of the enemy forces, the &quot;Aragon Liberation Front,&quot; must be stopped. To do so, the Rangers will take the fight to their territory, the rough terrain surrounding Fort Moore, the mountains of northern Georgia, and the swamps and coast of Florida. Ranger students are given a clear mission, but they determine how to best execute it.

The purpose of the course is learning to soldier as a combat leader while enduring the great mental and psychological stresses and physical fatigue of combat; the Ranger Instructors (RIs) – also known as Lane Graders – create and cultivate such a physical and mental environment. The course primarily comprises field craft instruction; students plan and execute daily patrolling, perform reconnaissance, ambushes, and raids against dispersed targets, followed by stealthy movement to a new patrol base to plan the next mission. Ranger students conduct about 20 hours of training per day, while consuming two or fewer meals daily totaling about , with an average of 3.5 hours of sleep a day. Students sleep more before a parachute jump for safety considerations. Ranger students typically wear and carry some of weapons, equipment, and training ammunition while patrolling more than throughout the course.

=== Darby phase ===

The first phase of Ranger School is conducted at Camp Rogers and Camp Darby at Fort Moore, Georgia and is conducted by the 4th Ranger Training Battalion. The &quot;Darby Phase&quot; is the &quot;crawl&quot; phase of Ranger School, where students learn the fundamentals of squad-level mission planning. It is &quot;designed to assess a Soldier’s physical stamina, mental toughness, leadership abilities, and establishes the tactical fundamentals required for follow-on phases of Ranger School&quot;. In this phase, training is separated into two parts, the Ranger Assessment Phase (RAP) and Squad Combat Operations.

The Ranger Assessment Phase is conducted at Camp Rogers. As of April 2011, it encompasses Days 1–3 of training. Historically, it accounts for 60% of students who fail to graduate Ranger School. Events include:

*Ranger Physical Fitness Test (RPFT) requiring the following minimums:
:*Push-ups: 49 (in 2 minutes, graded strictly for perfect form)
:*Sit-ups: 59 (in 2 minutes)
:*Chin-ups: 6 (performed from a dead hang with no lower body movement)
*5 mile individual run in 40 minutes or less over a course with gently rolling terrain
*Combat Water Survival Test (no longer conducted as of 2010)
*Combat Water Survival Assessment, conducted at Victory Pond (previously called the Water Confidence Test). This test consists of three events that test the Ranger student&#x27;s ability to calmly overcome any fear of heights or water. Students must calmly walk across a log suspended thirty-five feet above the pond, then transition to a rope crawl before plunging into the water. Each student must then jump into the pond and ditch their rifle and load-bearing equipment while submerged. Finally, each student climbs a ladder to the top of a seventy-foot tower and traverses down to the water on a pulley attached to a suspended cable, subsequently plunging into the pond. All of these tasks must be performed calmly without any type of safety harness. If a student fails to negotiate an obstacle (through fear, hesitation or by not completing it correctly) they are dropped from the course.
*Combination Night/Day land navigation test – This has proven to be one of the more difficult events for students, as sending units fail to teach land navigation using a map and compass. Students are given a predetermined number of MGRS locations and begin testing approximately two hours prior to dawn. Flashlights, with red lens filters, may only be used for map referencing; the use of flashlight to navigate across terrain will result in an immediate dismissal from the school. Later in the course, Ranger students will be expected to conduct, and navigate, patrols at night without violating light discipline. The land navigation test instills this skill early in each student&#x27;s mind, thus making the task second nature when graded patrolling begins.
*A 2.1 mile buddy run, followed by the Malvesti Field Obstacle Course, featuring the notorious &quot;worm pit&quot;: a shallow, muddy, 25-meter obstacle covered by knee-high barbed wire. The obstacle must be negotiated—usually several times—on one&#x27;s back and belly.
*Demolitions training and airborne refresher training.
*Modern Army Combatives Program (MACP) training was removed as a part of a new POI at the start of 2009; it was reinstated with Class 06–10. The Combatives Program was spread over all phases and culminated with practical application in Swamp Phase. However, MACP has been removed from Ranger again, starting with the Combatives Program in Mountains and Florida and followed by the removal of RAP week combatives in class 06–12.
*A 12-mile forced, individual ruck march with full gear on roads and trails surrounding Camp Rogers. This is the last test during RAP and is a pass/fail event. If the Ranger student fails to finish the march in under 3 hours, they are dropped from the course. (12 miles is approximately 20,000 metres.)
The emphasis at Camp Darby is on the instruction in and execution of Squad Combat Operations. The phase includes &quot;fast paced instruction on troop leading procedures, principles of patrolling, demolitions, field craft, and basic battle drills focused towards squad ambush and reconnaissance missions&quot;. The Ranger student receives instruction on airborne/air assault operations, demolitions, environmental and &quot;field craft&quot; training, executes the infamous &quot;Darby Queen&quot; obstacle course, and learns the fundamentals of patrolling, warning and operations orders, and communications. The fundamentals of combat operations include battle drills (React to Contact, Break Contact, React to Ambush, React to Indirect Fire, and Crossing a Danger Area), which are focused on providing the principles and techniques that enable the squad-level element to successfully conduct reconnaissance and ambush missions. As a result, the Ranger student gains tactical and technical proficiency and confidence in themselves, and prepares to move to the next phase of the course, the Mountain Phase.

=== Mountain phase ===

The second phase of Ranger School is conducted at the remote Camp Merrill near Dahlonega, Georgia by the 5th Ranger Training Battalion. Here, &quot;students receive instruction on military mountaineering tasks, mobility training, as well as techniques for employing a platoon for continuous combat patrol operations in a mountainous environment&quot;. Adding to the physical hardships endured in the Darby phase, in this phase &quot;the stamina and commitment of the Ranger student is stressed to the maximum. At any time, they may be selected to lead tired, hungry, physically expended students to accomplish yet another combat patrol mission&quot;. The Ranger student continues learning how to sustain themselves and their subordinates in the mountains. The rugged terrain, severe weather, hunger, mental and physical fatigue, and the psychological stress the student encounters allow them to measure their capabilities and limitations and those of their fellow soldiers.

In addition to combat operations, the student receives four days of military mountaineering training. The sequence of training has changed in past decades. As of 2010, the training sequence is as follows. In the first two days students learn knots, belays, anchor points, rope management, mobility evacuation, and the fundamentals of climbing and abseiling. The training ends in a two-day Upper mountaineering exercise at Yonah Mountain, to apply the skills learned during Lower mountaineering. Each student must make all prescribed climbs at Mt. Yonah to continue in the course. During the field training exercise (FTX), students execute a mission requiring mountaineering skills.

Combat missions are against a conventionally equipped threat force in a Mid-Intensity Conflict. These missions are both day and night in a two part, four and five-day FTX, and include moving cross country over mountains, vehicle ambushes, raiding communications and mortar sites, river crossing, and scaling steeply sloped mountainous terrain.

The Ranger student reaches his objective in several ways: cross-country movement, parachuting into small drop zones, air assaults into small, mountain-side landing zones, or a 10-mile march across the Tennessee Valley Divide. The student&#x27;s commitment and physical-mental stamina are tested to the maximum. At the end of the Mountain Phase, the students travel by bus to a nearby airfield and conduct an airborne operation, parachuting into Swamp Phase. Non-airborne are bused to Eglin Air Force Base for the Swamp Phase.

=== Swamp phase ===

The third phase of Ranger School is conducted at Camp James E. Rudder (Auxiliary Field #6), Eglin Air Force Base, Florida by the 6th Ranger Training Battalion. According to the Ranger Training Brigade, This phase focuses on the continued development of the Ranger student&#x27;s combat arms functional skills. Students receive instruction on waterborne operations, small boat movements, and stream crossings upon arrival. Practical exercises in extended platoon level operations executed in a coastal swamp environment test the Students’ ability to operate effectively under conditions of extreme mental and physical stress. This training further develops the Students&#x27; ability to plan and lead small units during independent and coordinated airborne, air assault, small boat, and dismounted combat patrol operations in a low intensity combat environment against a well trained, sophisticated enemy.

The Swamp Phase continues the progressive, realistic OPFOR (opposing forces) scenario. As the scenario develops, the students receive &quot;in-country&quot; technique training that assists them in accomplishing the tactical missions later in the phase. Technique training includes: small boat operations, expedient stream crossing techniques, and skills needed to survive and operate in a rainforest/swamp environment by learning how to deal with reptiles and how to determine the difference between venomous and non-venomous snakes. Camp Rudder has specially trained reptile experts who teach the students to not fear the wildlife they encounter.

The Ranger students are updated on the scenario that eventually commits the unit to combat during techniques training. The 10-day FTX comprises &quot;fast paced, highly stressful, challenging exercises in which the Students are evaluated on their ability to apply small unit tactics and techniques during the execution of raids, ambushes, movements to contact, and urban assaults to accomplish their assigned missions&quot;. The capstone of the course is the extensively planned raid of the Atropian Liberation Front&#x27;s (ALF) island stronghold. This small boat operation involves each platoon in the class, all working together on separate missions to take down the simulated cartel&#x27;s final point of strength.

Afterwards, students who have met graduation requirements spend several days cleaning their weapons and equipment before returning to Fort Moore. By then they have earned PX (Post Exchange) privileges, and access to a community center where they can use a telephone, eat civilian food, and watch television. In years past, the &quot;Gator Lounge&quot; served this purpose, but it was destroyed by a fire in late 2005. In the years since, a new &quot;Gator Lounge&quot; has been built, maintaining many of the features of the original. Graduation is at Fort Moore. In an elaborate ceremony at Victory Pond, the black-and-gold Ranger Tab is pinned to the graduating soldier&#x27;s left shoulder (usually by a relative, a respected RI, or soldier from the student&#x27;s original unit). The Ranger Tab is permanently worn above the soldier&#x27;s unit patch.

=== Desert phase ===
The Desert Phase was designed to instruct its students in Desert Warfare operations and basic survival in the deserts of the Middle East. John Lock describes the Desert Phase as follows. The phase commenced with an in-flight rigging and airborne assault—or an air assault landing by non-airborne personnel, onto an objective. Following the mission, the students moved into a cantonment area. Remaining in garrison for five days, they then received classes on desert-survival techniques to include water procurement and water preservation. Leadership responsibilities, standing operating procedures (SOPs), reconnaissance, and ambush techniques were also reviewed. Additional emphasis was placed on battle drills to include react to enemy contact, react to indirect fire, and react to near and far ambushes. Drills on how to breach barbed and concertina wire with wire cutters and assault ladders were taught as were techniques on how to clear a trench line and how to assault a fortified bunker. The remainder of the phase comprised patrolling during field training exercises—&quot;reconnaissance, raid, or ambush missions&quot;. &quot;The phase culminated with an airborne assault—with non-Airborne trucked—by the entire class on a joint objective.&quot;

Ranger School&#x27;s initial evaluation of a Desert Phase was a cadre-lead patrol at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico in early 1971 called Arid Fox I. In June 1971, the Ranger Training Brigade conducted Arid Fox II, the first student-led patrol. This was part of the brigade&#x27;s continuing evaluation of the possibility of integrating a Desert Phase into the Ranger course. The first students to undergo the Desert Phase were selected from Ranger Class 13–71 (class 13 in 1971). When the bulk of the class went on to begin the Swamp phase, the airborne qualified members of Ranger Class 13–71 (Desert) donned MC1-1 parachutes, boarded a C-130 aircraft and parachuted into the White Sands Missile Range.

Upon formal integration into the Ranger Course, the Desert Phase was initially run by the Ranger School&#x27;s 4th (Desert Ranger) Training Company stationed at Fort Bliss, Texas from 1983 to 1987. When the Desert Phase was officially introduced, the length of Ranger School was lengthened to 65 days. At the outset, the Desert Phase was the last phase of the Ranger Course—following the Benning, Mountain and Swamp Phases, respectively.

In 1987, the unit was expanded into the 7th Ranger Training Battalion and moved to Dugway Proving Grounds, Utah.

In October 1991, the course was increased to sixty-eight days and the sequence was changed to Fort Benning, Desert (Fort Bliss, Texas), Mountain, and Florida. In May 1995, the school underwent its most recent course change when the Desert phase was discontinued. The last Ranger School class to go through the Desert Phase was class 7–95.

The U.S. Army has not given up on small unit desert training. In 2015, the 1st Armored Division created the Desert Warrior Course that focuses on honing combat tracking, night land navigation, live-fire drills, and a myriad of other tasks.

=== Leadership positions ===
A student&#x27;s graduation is highly dependent on their performance in graded positions of leadership. This leadership ability is evaluated at various levels in various situations, and is observed while they are in one of typically two graded leadership roles per phase. The student can either meet the high standards and be given a &quot;GO&quot; by the R.I., or can fail to meet this standard and receive a &quot;NO GO&quot;. The student must demonstrate the ability to meet the standard in order to move forward, and can thus only afford one unsuccessful patrol. The student&#x27;s success will lie in his ability to essentially manipulate those directly underneath their charge of leadership. At times, this will be as few as two to three people—and at other times the student may be required to lead up to an entire 45-person platoon. The student&#x27;s success can be dependent on the performance and teamwork of these individuals, whom they must motivate and lead. Missions are typically broken up into four stages: planning, movement, actions on the objective, and establishment of a patrol base. The Platoon Leader position (in Mountains and Florida) will be rotated throughout the mission, and the same is true for the platoon sergeant position. The squad leader position is on a 24-hour rotation which is the same for all of the ungraded key leadership positions: Medic, Forward Observer (FO) and Radio Telephone Operator (RTO).

=== Peer evaluations ===
Another part of the evaluation of the student is a peer evaluation; failing a peer evaluation (scoring less than a 60% approval rating from your squad) can result in disqualification, though usually only if it happens twice. Due to unit loyalties, certain individuals within a squad who may be &quot;the odd one out&quot; will sometimes be singled out by the squad arbitrarily. Because of this, someone who has been &quot;peered out&quot; or &quot;peered,&quot; will be moved to another squad, sometimes within another platoon, in order to ensure that this was not the reason the student was peered. If it happens within this new squad, however, this is taken as an indication that student is being singled out because they are either lazy, incompetent, or cannot keep up. At this time the student will usually be removed from the course.

=== Recycling ===
If a student performs successfully, but suffers an injury that keeps them from finishing, they may be medically recycled (med recycle) at the discretion of either the battalion or the Ranger Training Brigade commander; the student will be given an opportunity to heal and finish the course with the next class. Students recycled in the first phase are temporarily assigned to Vaughn&#x27;s Platoon (informally known as the &quot;Gulag&quot; to Ranger students). Recycled students typically receive classes on Ranger School tasks and perform a variety of general tasks for their respective Ranger Training Battalion. While marking time at Ranger School is not always pleasant, those who have been recycled typically perform well when reinserted back into the course, with pass rates well over 80%.

Students can also be recycled for a variety of other reasons, including failing their patrol evaluations, peer evaluation, collecting 3 or more bad spot reports in a phase, or receiving a Serious Observation Report (SOR). Students may receive SORs for actions including, but not limited to, negligent discharges, safety violations involving demolitions or mountaineering, not looking through their sights while firing, or throwing away ammunition to lighten their load while on patrol. If a student fails a phase twice for the same reason (patrols, peers, etc.) they will usually be dropped from the course, but may possibly be offered a &quot;day one restart,&quot; and will restart on Day 1 of the next Ranger School class. In rare cases, those assessed of honor violations (lying, cheating, stealing) and SORs may be offered a day one restart as opposed to being dropped from the course.

=== Graduation rates ===

Historically, the graduation rate has been around 50%, but this has fluctuated. In the period prior to 1980, the Ranger School attrition rate was over 65%. 64% of Ranger School class 10–80 graduated. The graduation rate has dropped below 50% in recent years: 52% in 2005, 54% in 2006, 56% in 2007, 49% in 2008, 46% in 2009, 43% in 2010, and 42% in 2011. Recycles are included in the graduation rates. Recycles are tracked by the class they start with, and affect only that class&#x27;s
graduation rate.

=== Physical effects ===
Following the completion of Ranger School, a student will usually find himself &quot;in the worst shape of his life&quot;. Military folk wisdom has it that Ranger School&#x27;s physical toll is like years of natural aging; high levels of fight-or-flight stress hormones (epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol), along with standard sleep deprivation and continual physical strain, inhibit full physical and mental recovery throughout the course.

Common maladies during the course include weight loss, dehydration, trench foot, heatstroke, frostbite, chilblains, fractures, tissue tears (ligaments, tendons, muscles), swollen hands, feet, knees, nerve damage, loss of limb sensitivity, cellulitis, contact dermatitis, cuts, and insect, spider, bee, and other wildlife bites.

Because of the physical and psychological effect of low calorie intake over an extended period of time, it is not uncommon for many Ranger School graduates to encounter weight problems as they return to their units and their bodies and minds slowly adjust to routine again. A drastically lowered metabolic rate, combined with a nearly insatiable appetite (the result of food deprivation and the ensuing survivalist mentality) can cause quick weight gain, as the body is already in energy (fat) storing mode.

==== Food and sleep deprivation ====
A Ranger student&#x27;s diet and sleep are strictly controlled by the Ranger Instructors. During time in garrison, students are given one to three meals a day, but forced to eat extremely quickly and without any talking. During field exercises, Ranger students are given two MREs (Meal, Ready-to-eat) per day, but not allowed to eat them until given permission. This is enforced most harshly in Darby and Mountain phases. Since food and sleep are at the bottom of the priorities of those in the infantry behind security, weapons maintenance, and personal hygiene, it is generally the last thing Ranger students are allowed to do. As such, the two MREs are generally eaten within three hours of each other, one post mission, and the other prior to the planning portion of the mission. Though the Ranger student&#x27;s daily caloric intake of 2200 calories would be more than enough for the average person, Ranger students are under such physical stress that this amount is insufficient. The Ranger Training Brigade does not maintain weight information in the 21st century, but in the 1980s, Ranger students lost an average of 25–30 pounds during the Ranger course.

== Ranger School Class Awards ==
The awards listed below are designed to recognize outstanding achievement during the Ranger Course. Dependent on class performance, all or some of these awards may be presented upon graduation.

;William O. Darby Award (Distinguished Honor Graduate)
The Darby Award is awarded to the Ranger that shows the best tactical and administrative leadership performance, has the most positive spot reports and has demonstrated being a cut above the rest. They must also pass all graded leadership positions, peer reports, and may not recycle. This award is named in the honor of BG William O. Darby, who organized the 1st Ranger Battalion in 1942 with handpicked volunteers leading the way onto the beaches of North Africa. Ranger Battalions also spearheaded the campaigns in Sicily and Italy, and the D-Day landing on Omaha Beach. In the Pacific the 6th Ranger Battalion served with distinction in the Philippines.

;Ralph Puckett Award (Officer Honor Graduate)
The Puckett Award is awarded to the Ranger that passes all graded leadership positions; peer reports, and may not recycle. The Ranger may not have any lost equipment due to negligence and may not have any retests on any critical tasks. This award is named in honor of Colonel Ralph Puckett. Colonel Puckett earned the Distinguished Service Cross (upgraded to the Medal of Honor in 2021) during the Korean War as company commander of the 8th Army Ranger Company, the first Ranger Company seeing active service during the war. Then-First Lieutenant Puckett, in an attack against numerically superior Chinese forces, established defensive fighting positions on the captured objective. His Rangers held off five successive Chinese counterattacks before he was severely wounded during a sixth counterattack and evacuated despite his protests.

;Glenn M. Hall Award (Enlisted Honor Graduate)
The Hall is awarded to the Ranger that passes all graded leadership positions; peer reports, and may not recycle. The Ranger may not have any lost equipment due to negligence and may not have any retests on any critical tasks. This award is named in honor of Corporal Glenn M. Hall. Corporal Hall was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross while serving with the 1st Airborne Ranger Company for his gallant actions at Chipyon-Ni during the Korean War. He exposed himself to direct enemy fire to cover his platoon&#x27;s movement. Once his weapon jammed he joined his platoon and volunteered to contact friendly forces on an adjacent hill. When he reached the hill, it was covered with enemy troops. Corporal Hall killed a Chinese soldier in a foxhole and used that position to drive the enemy from the hill. He was wounded during that action by a grenade.

;LTC Keith Antonia Officer Leadership Award
Awarded to the highest ranked commissioned officer as selected by their peers for demonstrating outstanding leadership, initiative, and motivation.

;CSM Michael Kelso Enlisted Leadership Award
Awarded to the highest ranked enlisted Ranger as selected by their peers for demonstrating outstanding leadership, initiative, and motivation.

==Ranger training deaths==
While Ranger School is designed to physically stress students to a point short of death, some fatalities have occurred during training.

In the winter of 1977, two students in class 2-77 died of hypothermia while on patrol in the Florida swamp.

In 1985, in the Swamp phase, a soldier drowned crossing a stream against a strong current.

In March 1992, a student with sickle cell trait died after exposure to high altitude and stress in the mountain phase. The Ranger Training Brigade did not know about his medical issue until after his death.

In March 1992, a Ranger student died from a fall on the Slide for Life.

On 15 February 1995, the &quot;worst incident in the 44-year history of the school&quot; occurred during the Swamp Phase of class 3–95. Captain Milton Palmer, 2LT Spencer Dodge, 2LT Curt Sansoucie, and SGT Norman Tillman died from hypothermia. Investigations of the incident were conducted by the U.S. Air Force, the Ranger Training Brigade, and the U.S. Army&#x27;s Safety Board. The results were determined to be a result of a combination of human errors exacerbated by &quot;unexpected weather conditions&quot;. Nine Ranger Instructors were disciplined and the 6th Ranger Training Battalion commander was relieved. As there was no basis for criminal charges, none were court-martialed. The four dead Ranger School students were posthumously awarded the Ranger Tab. As a result of the 1995 deaths, 38 new safety measures were implemented in the Swamp Phase. According to John Lock,

On Thursday, March 25, 2021, Cpl. James A. Requenez, 28, of San Antonio, Texas, died due to drowning during an unspecified training incident at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. Officials with Airborne and Ranger Training Brigade, out of Fort Moore, Georgia, said. Requenez was transported to Eglin AFB hospital, where he was pronounced dead, according to the release, which added the incident was under investigation.

On Tuesday, August 9, 2022, Staff Sgt. George Taber and 2nd Lt. Evan Fitzgibbon were killed while conducting mountaineering training in the north Georgia mountains. Both students were struck by a portion of a falling tree while sheltering during a weather-induced training hold. Three additional students were also injured during the event and treated at a hospital.

<doc id="811682" wikidata="Q2376827" url="?curid=811682" title="IBM System Object Model">
<text>The System Object Model (SOM) is an object-oriented shared library technology developed by IBM that supports defining an interface to an object so that its interface is separate from its implementation. 

DSOM, a distributed variant based on CORBA, allowed objects on different computers to communicate.

A SOM library can be updated without requiring client code to be rebuilt. If a library is changed to add new classes or methods, or to change the internal implementation of classes or methods, a consuming program can still use it without being rebuilt. In this way, SOM addresses the fragile binary interface problem that affects other library technology such as C++.

SOM allows classes to be defined in one programming language and used in another. A client can create and use objects from the exposed classes and derive subclasses from the exposed classes even if the client language does not support class typing.

SOM provides an application programming interface (API) that provides access to library metadata. Each object exposes methods that provide the class name and whether the object implements a particular method, for example.

==Applications==

SOM was intended to be used universally in IBM&#x27;s mainframe and desktop (OS/2) computers, allowing programs designed for the desktop to use a mainframe for processing and data storage. IBM produced versions of SOM/DSOM for OS/2, Microsoft Windows and various Unix flavors (notably IBM&#x27;s own AIX). For some time after the formation of the AIM alliance, SOM/DSOM was also used by Apple Computer for similar purposes. It was most widely used in their OpenDoc framework, but saw limited use in other roles as well.

Perhaps the most widespread uses of SOM within IBM were in later versions of OS/2, which used it for most code, including the Workplace Shell. Object REXX for OS/2 is able to deal with SOM classes and objects including WPS.

SOMobjects were not completely shut down by IBM. They were ported to OS/390, and are still available on this OS. One can read documentation on IBM website. In 1996 Tandem Computers Inc. obtained SOMobjects technology. Tandem was sold to Compaq, Compaq was sold to Hewlett-Packard. NonStop DOM and some other technologies eventually merged into NonStop CORBA, but current documentation of NonStop products does not contain signs of SOM technology still powering NonStop products.

==Fading away==
With the &quot;death&quot; of OS/2 in the mid-1990s, the &quot;&quot; for SOM/DSOM largely disappeared; if users would not be running OS/2 on the desktop, there would be no universal object library anyway. In 1997, when Steve Jobs returned to Apple and ended many development efforts including Copland and OpenDoc, SOM was replaced with Objective-C already being in use in OPENSTEP (to become Mac OS X later). SOM/DSOM development faded, and is no longer actively developed, although it continues to be included and used in OS/2-based systems such as ArcaOS.

Despite effective death of OS/2 and OpenDoc, SOM could have yet another niche: Windows and cross-platform development. SOM 3.0 for WinNT was generally available in December 1996. The reasons for not advancing in these directions go beyond market adoption problems. They involve opportunities missed by IBM, and destructive incompatible changes:
* The first version of VisualAge C++ for Windows was 3.5. It was the first and the last version to support SOM. It had SOM 2.1 bundled in and Direct-to-SOM support in the compiler. Versions 3.6.5 and later had no trace of SOM.
* SOMobjects largely relied on makefiles. VisualAge C++ 4.0 introduced .icc projects and removed icc.exe and ilink.exe command line compiler and linker from supply. It is impossible to build any SOM DTK sample out of box with VAC++ 4.0. VisualAge C++ comes with its own samples, but there are no .icc SOM samples even in VAC++ 4.0 for OS/2. vacbld.exe, the only command line compilation tool, doesn&#x27;t support SOM.
* VisualAge C++ bundled-in Object Component Library (OCL) was not based on SOM. It was probably meant to be ported to SOM using C++ Direct-to-SOM mode, but in VAC v3.6.5 this mode was abandoned, and OCL has no SOM interface so far.
* Near the end of the 1990s, IBM shut down SOMobjects download sites and never put them back online. SOM 3.0 DTK for WinNT can&#x27;t be found on IBM FTP, despite much other legacy stuff lying around freely. Despite general availability of SOM 3.0 for WinNT, it was nearly impossible to locate until the end of 2012.
* Finally, IBM never open-sourced SOM (as done to Object REXX), despite several articles and petitions.

==Alternative implementations==

Two projects of open-source SOM implementations exist. One is Netlabs Object Model (NOM), which is technically the same, but binary incompatible. Another is somFree, which is a clean room design of IBM SOM, and binary compatible. 

==Comparison to compiled class libraries==

SOM can be compared compiled libraries: 

* Smalltalk
* Common Lisp Object System (CLOS)
* generic C++
* SGI Delta/C++
* Sun Object Binary Interface
* Objective-C
* Java

As of 2015, most of the information in the linked table is applicable to modern versions, except Objective-C 2.0 getting so called non-fragile instance variables. Some solutions remained experimental: SGI Delta/C++ or Sun OBI. Most approaches based on one programming language were phased out or were never used actively in the same way. For instance, Netscape Plugin Application Programming Interface (NPAPI) browser plugins were written using Java API initially (LiveConnect), but Java Virtual Machine (JVM) was later excluded from the chain. It can be seen as Java replaced with Cross Platform Component Object Model (XPCOM). Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) and Smalltalk are not known as being chain links like Java in LiveConnect. Objective-C is also not known much in this role and not known to be marketed this way, but its runtime is one of the most friendly to similar use cases.

Generic C++ is still being used in Qt and the K Desktop Environment (KDE). Qt and KDE are notable for describing efforts it takes to maintain binary compatibility without special support in development tools.

GObject only aimed to avoid dependence on C++ compiler, but RRBC issues are the same as in generic C++.

Without special runtime many other programming languages will have the same issues, e.g., Delphi, Ada. It can be illustrated by so-called &quot;unprecedented approach&quot; it took to produce Delphi 2006 binary compatible Delphi 2007 release: How to add a &quot;published&quot; property without breaking DCU compatibility 

Objective-C is the most promising competitor to SOM (although not being actively marketed as multi-language platform), and SOM should preferably be compared to Objective-C as opposed to COM as it happened historically. With non-fragile instance variables in Objective-C 2.0 it is the best alternative amongst actively supported.

COM, XPCOM are being used actively, but they only manage interfaces, not implementations, and thus are not on the same level as SOM, GObject and Objective-C. Windows Runtime under closer look behaves much like COM. Its metadata description is based on .NET, but since WinRT does not contain special runtime to resolve RRBC issues, like in Objective-C or SOM, several restrictions had to be applied that limit WinRT on procedural level:

Type System (C++/CX)

: A ref class that has a public constructor must be declared as sealed, to prevent further derivation.

Windows Runtime Components - Windows Runtime Components in a .NET World

: Another restriction is that no generic public classes or interfaces can be exposed. Polymorphism isn&#x27;t available to WinRT types, and the closest you can come is implementing WinRT interfaces; you must declare as sealed any classes that are publicly exposed by your Windows Runtime Component.

==Comparison to COM==

SOM is often compared to component object model (COM). Both support a library format that can be used from more than one language. 

Some consider SOM to be more robust since it only supports a language-neutral calling mechanism that is similar to COM late binding. COM also supports early binding, a.k.a. custom interface, that is less safe although more performant. It allows a client to access an object via a function table that is compatible with C and therefore compatible with the binary layout of the virtual table of C++ objects (at least in Microsoft&#x27;s C++ compiler). With a compatible C++ compiler, a custom interface can be defined as a pure virtual C++ class. The interface can be called by any language that can call C functions via a pointer. 

A risk of a custom interface is that an incompatibility can result in undefined behavior. In particular, if a version of the object is published with a modified custom interface, a client may crash. This is an example of the fragile base class problem. To prevent the problem, a rule for COM development is that once published, a custom interface cannot be changed. To add or change the exposed features of an object, it can implement additional custom interfaces.

SOM avoid this issue by providing only late binding allowing the run-time linker to re-build the table on the fly. This way, changes to the underlying libraries are resolved when they are loaded into programs.

SOM is more robust in terms of supporting object-oriented (OO) features. Whereas COM essentially defines a cut-down version of C++ to program to, SOM supports almost all common features. It also supports some less common features such as multiple inheritance, metaclasses and dynamic dispatching, which had led most SOM/COM-like systems to be simpler at the cost of supporting fewer languages. Multi-language support was important to IBM as they wanted to support both Smalltalk (single inheritance and dynamic dispatch) with C++ (multiple inheritance and fixed dispatch).

A notable difference is support for inheritance. COM does not. Although may think it odd that Microsoft produced an object library technology that could not support such a fundamental concept of OO programming; the main reason is that it is difficult to know where a base class exists in memory where libraries are loaded in a order unknown at design time. COM demands that the programmer specify the exact base class at compile time, making it impossible to insert other derived classes in the middle; at least in other COM libraries.

SOM instead uses an algorithm, looking for potential base classes by following the inheritance tree and stopping at the first one that matches. This is the idea behind inheritance in most cases. The downside to this approach is that it is possible that new versions of this base class may no longer work even if the API remains the same. This possibility exists in any program, not only those using a shared library, but a problem can become difficult to resolve if it exists in someone else&#x27;s code. In SOM, the only solution is testing of new versions of libraries.

While SOM and COM were contrapositioned by IBM, they were not mutually exclusive. In 1995 Novell contributed ComponentGlue technology to OpenDoc for Windows. This technology provided different means to integrate between COM and SOM components. In particular, SOM objects can be made available to OLE2 applications by either late binding bridge (based on IDispatch) or COM interfaces having higher performance. In essence, SOM classes are implementing COM interfaces this way.

Similar technologies, such as Distributed Objects Everywhere, also support full inheritance. Portable Distributed Objects avoided these issues via a strong versioning system, allowing library authors to ship new versions along with the old, thereby guaranteeing backward compatibility at the cost of disk space.

<text>The laboratory mouse or lab mouse is a small mammal of the order Rodentia which is bred and used for scientific research or feeders for certain pets. Mice used in laboratories are usually of the species &quot;Mus musculus&quot;. They are the most commonly used mammalian research model and are used for research in genetics, physiology, psychology, medicine and other scientific disciplines. Mice belong to the Euarchontoglires clade, which includes humans. This close relationship, the associated high homology with humans, their ease of maintenance and handling, and their high reproduction rate, make mice particularly suitable models for human-oriented research. The laboratory mouse genome has been sequenced and many mouse genes have human homologues. Lab mice are sold at pet stores for snake food and can also be kept as pets.

Other mouse species sometimes used in laboratory research include two American species, the white-footed mouse (&quot;Peromyscus leucopus&quot;) and the North American deer mouse (&quot;Peromyscus maniculatus&quot;).

== History as a biological model ==

Mice have been used in biomedical research since the 17th century when William Harvey used them for his studies on reproduction and blood circulation and Robert Hooke used them to investigate the biological consequences of an increase in air pressure. During the 18th century Joseph Priestley and Antoine Lavoisier both used 
mice to study respiration. In the 19th century Gregor Mendel carried out his early investigations of inheritance on mouse coat color but was asked by his superior to stop breeding in his cell &quot;smelly creatures that, in addition, copulated and had sex&quot;. He then switched his investigations to peas but, as his observations were published in a somewhat obscure botanical journal, they were virtually ignored for over 35 years until they were rediscovered in the early 20th century. In 1902 Lucien Cuénot published the results of his experiments using mice which showed that Mendel&#x27;s laws of inheritance were also valid for animals — results that were soon confirmed and extended to other species.

In the early part of the 20th century, Harvard undergraduate Clarence Cook Little was conducting studies on mouse genetics in the laboratory of William Ernest Castle. Little and Castle collaborated closely with Abbie Lathrop who was a breeder of fancy mice and rats which she marketed to rodent hobbyists and keepers of exotic pets, and later began selling in large numbers to scientific researchers. Together they generated the DBA (Dilute, Brown and non-Agouti) inbred mouse strain and initiated the systematic generation of inbred strains. The mouse has since been used extensively as a model organism and is associated with many important biological discoveries of the 20th and 21st Centuries.

The Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine is currently one of the world&#x27;s largest suppliers of laboratory mice, at around 3 million mice a year. The laboratory is also the world&#x27;s source for more than 8,000 strains of genetically defined mice and is home of the Mouse Genome Informatics database.

== Reproduction ==

Breeding onset occurs at about 50 days of age in both females and males, although females may have their first estrus at 25–40 days. Mice are polyestrous and breed year round; ovulation is spontaneous. The duration of the estrous cycle is 4–5 days and lasts about 12 hours, occurring in the evening. Vaginal smears are useful in timed matings to determine the stage of the estrous cycle. Mating can be confirmed by the presence of a copulatory plug in the vagina up to 24 hours post-copulation. The presence of sperm on a vaginal smear is also a reliable indicator of mating.

The average gestation period is 20 days. A fertile postpartum estrus occurs 14–24 hours following parturition, and simultaneous lactation and gestation prolongs gestation by 3–10 days owing to delayed implantation. The average litter size is 10–12 during optimum production, but is highly strain-dependent. As a general rule, inbred mice tend to have longer gestation periods and smaller litters than outbred and hybrid mice. The young are called pups and weigh at birth, are hairless, and have closed eyelids and ears. Pups are weaned at 3 weeks of age when they weigh about . If the female does not mate during the postpartum estrus, she resumes cycling 2–5 days post-weaning.

Newborn males are distinguished from newborn females by noting the greater anogenital distance and larger genital papilla in the male. This is best accomplished by lifting the tails of littermates and comparing perinea.

==Genetics and strains==
Mice are mammals of the clade (a group consisting of an ancestor and all its descendants) Euarchontoglires, which means they are amongst the closest non-primate relatives of humans along with lagomorphs, treeshrews, and flying lemurs.
Laboratory mice are the same species as the house mouse; however, they are often very different in behaviour and physiology. There are hundreds of established inbred, outbred, and transgenic strains. A &quot;strain&quot;, in reference to rodents, is a group in which all members are as nearly as possible genetically identical. In laboratory mice, this is accomplished through inbreeding. By having this type of population, it is possible to conduct experiments on the roles of genes, or conduct experiments that exclude genetic variation as a factor. In contrast, outbred populations are used when identical genotypes are unnecessary or a population with genetic variation is required, and are usually referred to as &quot;stocks&quot; rather than &quot;strains&quot;. Over 400 standardized, inbred strains have been developed.

Most laboratory mice are hybrids of different subspecies, most commonly of &quot;Mus musculus domesticus&quot; and &quot;Mus musculus musculus&quot;. Laboratory mice can have a variety of coat colours, including agouti, black and albino. Many (but not all) laboratory strains are inbred. The different strains are identified with specific letter-digit combinations; for example C57BL/6 and BALB/c. The first such inbred strains were produced in 1909 by Clarence Cook Little, who was influential in promoting the mouse as a laboratory organism. In 2011, an estimated 83% of laboratory rodents supplied in the U.S. were C57BL/6 laboratory mice.

=== Genome ===
Sequencing of the laboratory mouse genome was completed in late 2002 using the C57BL/6 strain. This was only the second mammalian genome to be sequenced after humans. The haploid genome is about three billion base pairs long (3,000 Mb distributed over 19 autosomal chromosomes plus 1 respectively 2 sex chromosomes), therefore equal to the size of the human genome. Estimating the number of genes contained in the mouse genome is difficult, in part because the definition of a gene is still being debated and extended. The current count of primary coding genes in the laboratory mouse is 23,139. compared to an estimated 20,774 in humans.

=== Mutant and transgenic strains ===

Various mutant strains of mice have been created by a number of methods. A small selection from the many available strains includes -
* Mice resulting from ordinary breeding and inbreeding:
** Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, which develop diabetes mellitus type 1.
** Murphy Roths large (MRL) mice, with unusual regenerative capacities
** Japanese waltzing mice, which walk in a circular pattern due to a mutation adversely affecting their inner ears
** Immunodeficient nude mice, lacking hair and a thymus: these mice do not produce T lymphocytes; therefore, they do not mount cellular immune responses. They are used for research in immunology and transplantation.
** Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, with an almost completely defective immune system
** FVB mice, whose large litter sizes and large oocyte pronuclei expedite use in genetic research
** , which fail to recruit nutrient copper into milk causing pup death. It is caused by an autosomal recessive mutation &quot;tx&quot; which arose in an inbred. Theophilos et al. 1996 found this to be genetic and localized to chromosome 8, near the centromere.
* Transgenic mice, with foreign genes inserted into their genome:
** Abnormally large mice, with an inserted rat growth hormone gene
** Oncomice, with an activated oncogene, so as to significantly increase the incidence of cancer
** Doogie mice, with enhanced NMDA receptor function, resulting in improved memory and learning
* Knockout mice, where a specific gene was made inoperable by a technique known as gene knockout: the purpose is to study the function of the gene&#x27;s product or to simulate a human disease
** Fat mice, prone to obesity due to a carboxypeptidase E deficiency
** Strong muscular mice, with a disabled myostatin gene, nicknamed &quot;mighty mice&quot;.

Since 1998, it has been possible to clone mice from cells derived from adult animals.

===Commonly used inbred strains===

There are many strains of mice used in research, however, inbred strains are usually the animals of choice for most fields. Inbred mice are defined as being the product of at least 20 generations of brother X sister mating, with all individuals being derived from a single breeding pair.

Inbred mice have several traits that make them ideal for research purposes. They are isogenic, meaning that all animals are nearly genetically identical. Approximately 98.7% of the genetic loci in the genome are homozygous, so there are probably no &quot;hidden&quot; recessive traits that could cause problems. They also have very unified phenotypes due to this stability.

Many inbred strains have well documented traits that make them ideal for specific types of research. The following table shows the top 10 most popular strains according to Jackson Laboratories.&lt;br&gt;
==== Jackson Labs DO project ====

The Jackson Labs DO (Diversity Outbred) project is a mouse breeding program using multiple inbred founder strains to create a genetically diverse population of mice for use in scientific research.

These mice are designed for fine genetic mapping, and capture a large portion of the genetic diversity of the mouse genome.

This project has resulted in over 1,000 genetically diverse mice which have been used to identify genetic factors for diseases such as obesity, cancer, diabetes, and alcohol use disorder.

== Appearance and behaviour ==
Laboratory mice have retained many of the physical and behavioural characteristics of house mice; however, due to many generations of artificial selection, some of these characteristics now vary markedly. Due to the large number of strains of laboratory mice, it is impractical to comprehensively describe the appearance and behaviour of all of them; however, they are described below for two of the most commonly used strains.

===C57BL/6===
C57BL/6 mice have a dark brown, nearly black coat. They are more sensitive to noise and odours and are more likely to bite than the more docile laboratory strains such as BALB/c.

Group-housed C57BL/6 mice (and other strains) display barbering behaviour, which used to be seen as a sign of dominance. However, it is now known that this is more of a stereotypical behaviour triggered by stress, comparable to trichotillomania in humans or feather plucking in parrots. Mice that have been barbered extensively can have large bald patches on their bodies, commonly around the head, snout, and shoulders, although barbering may appear anywhere on the body. Also self-barbering can occur. Both hair and vibrissae may be removed. Barbering is more frequently seen in female mice; male mice are more likely to display dominance through fighting.

C57BL/6 has several unusual characteristics which make it useful for some research studies but inappropriate for others: It is unusually sensitive to pain and to cold, and analgesic medications are less effective in this strain. Unlike most laboratory mouse strains, the C57BL/6 drinks alcoholic beverages voluntarily. It is more susceptible than average to morphine addiction, atherosclerosis, and age-related hearing loss. When compared directly to BALB/c mice, C57BL/6 mice also express both a robust response to social rewards and empathy.

===BALB/c===
BALB/c is an albino laboratory-bred strain from which a number of common substrains are derived. With over 200 generations bred since 1920, BALB/c mice are distributed globally and are among the most widely used inbred strains used in animal experimentation.

BALB/c are noted for displaying high levels of anxiety and for being relatively resistant to diet-induced atherosclerosis, making them a useful model for cardiovascular research.

Male BALB/c mice are aggressive and will fight other males if housed together. However, the BALB/Lac substrain is much more docile. Most BALB/c mice substrains have a long reproductive life-span.

There are noted differences between different BALB/c substrains, though these are thought to be due to mutation rather than genetic contamination. The BALB/cWt is unusual in that 3% of progeny display true hermaphroditism.

===Tg2576===
A useful model for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD) in the lab is the Tg2576 strain of mice. The K670M and N671L double mutations seen in the human 695 splice-variant of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) are expressed by this strain. A hamster prion protein gene promoter, predominantly in neurons, drives the expression. When compared to non-transgenic littermates, Tg2576 mice show a five-fold rise in Aβ40 and a 10- to 15-fold increase in Aβ42/43. These mice develop senile plaques linked to cellular inflammatory responses because their brains have approximately five times as much transgenic mutant human APP than indigenous mouse APP. The mice exhibit main characteristics of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD), such as increased generation of amyloid fibrils with aging, plaque formation, and impaired hippocampus learning and memory. Tg2576 mice are a good model for early-stage AD because they show amyloidogenesis and working memory impairments linked to age but do not show neuronal degeneration. The absence of cell death suggests that changes in typical cellular signaling cascades involved in learning and synaptic plasticity are probably linked to the memory phenotype. Associative learning impairments are exacerbated when Tg2576 mice are crossed with PS1 transgenic animals that possess the A246E FAD mutation. This crosses promotes the build-up of amyloid and plaque development in the CNS. This lends credence to the theory that AD pathogenesis is influenced by the interplay between APP and PS-1 gene products. Although Tg2576 mice do not perfectly replicate late-stage AD with cell death, they do offer a platform for researching the physiology and biochemistry of the illness. With the help of transgenic mouse models, researchers can make progress in AD research by understanding the intricate relationships between gene products that are involved in the production of Aβ peptide.e physiology and biochemistry of the illness.

==Husbandry==
=== Handling ===
Traditionally, laboratory mice have been picked up by the base of the tail. However, recent research has shown that this type of handling increases anxiety and aversive behaviour. Instead, handling mice using a tunnel or cupped hands is advocated. In behavioural tests, tail-handled mice show less willingness to explore and to investigate test stimuli, as opposed to tunnel-handled mice which readily explore and show robust responses to test stimuli.

=== Nutrition ===
In nature, mice are usually herbivores, consuming a wide range of fruit or grain. However, in laboratory studies it is usually necessary to avoid biological variation and to achieve this, laboratory mice are almost always fed only commercial pelleted mouse feed. Food intake is approximately per of body weight per day; water intake is approximately per 100 g of body weight per day.

===Injection procedures===
Routes of administration of injections in laboratory mice are mainly subcutaneous, intraperitoneal and intravenous. Intramuscular administration is not recommended due to small muscle mass. Intracerebral administration is also possible. Each route has a recommended injection site, approximate needle gauge and recommended maximum injected volume at a single time at one site, as given in the table below:

To facilitate intravenous injection into the tail, laboratory mice can be carefully warmed under heat lamps to vasodilate the vessels.

===Anaesthesia===
A common regimen for general anesthesia for the house mouse is ketamine (in the dose of 100 mg per kg body weight) plus xylazine (in the dose of 5–10 mg per kg), injected by the intraperitoneal route. It has a duration of effect of about 30 minutes.

===Euthanasia===
Approved procedures for euthanasia of laboratory mice include compressed gas, injectable barbiturate anesthetics, inhalable anesthetics, such as Halothane, and physical methods, such as cervical dislocation and decapitation. In 2013, the American Veterinary Medical Association issued new guidelines for induction, stating that a flow rate of 10% to 30% volume/min is optimal for euthanasing laboratory mice.

==Pathogen susceptibility==
A recent study detected a murine astrovirus in laboratory mice held at more than half of the US and Japanese institutes investigated. Murine astrovirus was found in nine mice strains, including NSG, NOD-SCID, NSG-3GS, C57BL6-&quot;Timp-3−/−&quot;, uPA-NOG, B6J, ICR, Bash2, and BALB/C, with various degrees of prevalence. The pathogenicity of the murine astrovirus was not known.

==Legislation in research==

===United Kingdom===

In the U.K., as with all other vertebrates and some invertebrates, any scientific procedure which is likely to cause &quot;pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm&quot; is regulated by the Home Office under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. U.K. regulations are considered amongst the most comprehensive and rigorous in the world. Detailed data on the use of laboratory mice (and other species) in research in the U.K. are published each year. In the U.K. in 2013, there were a total of 3,077,115 regulated procedures undertaken on mice in scientific procedure establishments, licensed under the Act.

===United States===

In the U.S., laboratory mice are not regulated under the Animal Welfare Act administered by the USDA APHIS. However, the Public Health Service Act (PHS) as administered by the National Institutes of Health does offer a standard for their care and use. Compliance with the PHS is required for a research project to receive federal funding. PHS policy is administered by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare. Many academic research institutes seek accreditation voluntarily, often through the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, which maintains the standards of care found within &quot;The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals&quot; and the PHS policy. This accreditation is, however, not a prerequisite for federal funding, unlike the actual compliance.

==Limitations==

While mice are by far the most widely used animals in biomedical research, recent studies have highlighted their limitations. For example, the utility of rodents in testing for sepsis, burns, inflammation, stroke, ALS, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, diabetes, cancer, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and other illnesses has been called into question by a number of researchers. Regarding experiments on mice, some researchers have complained that &quot;years and billions of dollars have been wasted following false leads&quot; as a result of a preoccupation with the use of these animals in studies.

Mice differ from humans in several immune properties: mice are more resistant to some toxins than humans; have a lower total neutrophil fraction in the blood, a lower neutrophil enzymatic capacity, lower activity of the complement system, and a different set of pentraxins involved in the inflammatory process; and lack genes for important components of the immune system, such as IL-8, IL-37, TLR10, ICAM-3, etc. Laboratory mice reared in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) conditions usually have a rather immature immune system with a deficit of memory T cells. These mice may have limited diversity of the microbiota, which directly affects the immune system and the development of pathological conditions. Moreover, persistent virus infections (for example, herpesviruses) are activated in humans, but not in SPF mice with septic complications and may change the resistance to bacterial coinfections. &quot;Dirty&quot; mice are possibly better suitable for mimicking human pathologies. In addition, inbred mouse strains are used in the overwhelming majority of studies, while the human population is heterogeneous, pointing to the importance of studies in interstrain hybrid, outbred, and nonlinear mice.

An article in &quot;The Scientist&quot; notes, &quot;The difficulties associated with using animal models for human disease result from the metabolic, anatomic, and cellular differences between humans and other creatures, but the problems go even deeper than that&quot; including issues with the design and execution of the tests themselves. In addition, the caging of laboratory animals may render them irrelevant models of human health because these animals lack day-to-day variations in experiences, agency, and challenges that they can overcome. The impoverished environments inside small mouse cages can have deleterious influences on biomedical results, especially with respect to studies of mental health and of systems that depend upon healthy psychological states.

For example, researchers have found that many mice in laboratories are obese from excess food and minimal exercise, which alters their physiology and drug metabolism. Many laboratory animals, including mice, are chronically stressed, which can also negatively affect research outcomes and the ability to accurately extrapolate findings to humans. Researchers have also noted that many studies involving mice are poorly designed, leading to questionable findings.

Some studies suggests that inadequate published data in animal testing may result in irreproducible research, with missing details about how experiments are done are omitted from published papers or differences in testing that may introduce bias. Examples of hidden bias include a 2014 study from McGill University which suggests that mice handled by men rather than women showed higher stress levels. Another study in 2016 suggested that gut microbiomes in mice may have an impact upon scientific research.

==Market size==
The worldwide market for gene-altered mice is predicted to grow to $1.59 billion by 2022, growing at a rate of 7.5 percent per year.

<text>The Battle of Pelagonia or Battle of Kastoria took place in early summer or autumn 1259, between the Empire of Nicaea and an anti-Nicaean alliance comprising Despotate of Epirus, Kingdom of Sicily and the Principality of Achaea. It was a decisive event in the history of the Eastern Mediterranean, ensuring the eventual reconquest of Constantinople and the end of the Latin Empire in 1261. 

The rising power of Nicaea in the southern Balkans, and the ambitions of its ruler, Michael VIII Palaiologos, to recover Constantinople, led the formation of a coalition between the Epirote Greeks, under Michael II Komnenos Doukas, and the chief Latin rulers of the time, the Prince of Achaea, William of Villehardouin, and Manfred of Sicily. The details of the battle, including its precise date and location, are disputed as the primary sources give contradictory information; modern scholars usually place it either in July or in September, somewhere in the plain of Pelagonia or near Kastoria. It appears that the barely concealed rivalries between the Epirote Greeks and their Latin allies came to the fore in the lead-up to the battle, possibly fanned by Palaiologos&#x27; agents. As a result, the Epirotes abandoned the Latins on the eve of the battle, while Michael II&#x27;s bastard son John Doukas defected to the Nicaean camp. The Latins were then set upon by the Nicaeans and routed, while many nobles, including Villehardouin, were taken captive. 

The battle cleared the last obstacle to the Nicaean reconquest of Constantinople in 1261 and the re-establishment of the Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty. It also led to the brief conquest of Epirus and Thessaly by Nicaean forces, although Michael II and his sons rapidly managed to reverse these gains. In 1262, William of Villehardouin was released in exchange for three fortresses on the southeastern tip of the Morea peninsula. This foothold would be gradually expanded, and would over the next century become the Despotate of the Morea.

== Background ==
Following the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Fourth Crusade in 1204, the two main Byzantine Greek contenders for the imperial legacy of Byzantium were the Empire of Nicaea in western Asia Minor, and the Despotate of Epirus in western Greece. This engendered a persistent rivalry between the two states as to which would first recover Constantinople. Nicaea gained an important advantage following the conquest of Macedonia by the Nicaean emperor John III Vatatzes (). Following Vatatzes&#x27; conquests, the region of Pelagonia in western Macedonia became a border zone between the Nicaean and Epirote domains. 

When Vatatzes died in 1254, the ruler of Epirus, Michael II Komnenos Doukas (), sponsored a rebellion against Nicaea in Albania, and invaded the Nicaean domains, capturing the fortress of Prilep and the local Nicaean governor, and future historian, George Akropolites. Michael II&#x27;s advance on Thessalonica was interrupted, however, when Manfred of Sicily () landed his own troops in Albania and captured most of it, as well as Corfu. Like the earlier Norman kings of Sicily, Manfred had his own ambitions in the Balkans, including Constantinople itself; and the enforced residence of his half-sister, Constance, the widow of Vatatzes, at the Nicaean court, only aggravated his feelings towards Nicaea. Thus, when Michael II offered to hand over Albania and Corfu as the dowry of his eldest daughter Helena, Manfred accepted. Michael II now formed a wider anti-Nicaean alliance, by giving his second daughter, Anna, to the Latin Prince of Achaea, William of Villehardouin (), who was also overlord of the other Latin states of southern Greece, the Duchy of Athens and the Triarchs of Negroponte. Michael II also secured the backing of the Serbian king, Stephen Urosh I (), while Vatatzes&#x27; son and successor, Theodore II Laskaris (), in turn sought the support of Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria () giving him his own daughter Irene in marriage. Before he could campaign against Epirus, however, he died and was succeeded his young son John IV Laskaris (). Very soon, power was seized by the ambitious aristocrat Michael VIII Palaiologos (), first as regent and then as senior co-emperor.

== Nicaean expedition against Epirus ==

Michael Palaiologos found himself faced with a powerful coalition that, according to the Byzantinist Donald Nicol, &quot;seemed likely to threaten the possession not only of Thessalonica but even of Constantinople itself&quot;. Michael Palaiologos did not tarry. Already in the autumn of 1258, his army crossed over into Europe, under his brother John Palaiologos, who held the quasi-imperial rank of , and the (commander-in-chief) Alexios Strategopoulos, and wintered in Macedonia, where it was joined by local levies. At the same time, Michael Palaiologos sent separate embassies to each of the three main allies, hoping to pry them apart by diplomacy. These efforts failed, as the three allies stood to gain much from a successful offensive against Nicaea. 

In spring 1259, the Nicaeans went on the offensive, and advanced quickly westwards along the Via Egnatia. Michael II of Epirus, who was encamped at Kastoria, was caught off guard by the rapidity of their advance, and when the Nicaeans crossed the pass of Vodena to face him, he was forced to hastily retreat with his troops across the Pindus mountains to the vicinity of Avlona, held by his ally Manfred. There the final negotiations for the marriage between Manfred and Helena were concluded: the wedding took place at Trani on 2 June 1259. In their retreat, which continued even during night, the Epirotes reportedly lost many men in the dangerous mountain passes, while the Nicaean generals captured Ohrid and Deavolis and other cities.

== Opposing forces ==
The Epirote ruler had lost much of his territory, but soon his Latin allies came to his aid. Manfred, preoccupied with his conflicts against the Guelphs in central Italy, did not come in person–although his presence is erroneously reported by near-contemporary sources like Nikephoros Gregoras and Matteo Spinelli—but sent 400 superbly outfitted German knights, who probably landed at Avlona to join Michael II&#x27;s forces. William of Villehardouin on the other hand campaigned at the head his forces. The Greek and French versions of the &quot;Chronicle of the Morea&quot; mention troops from Achaea, the Duchy of Athens, the Triarchy of Negroponte, and the Duchy of the Archipelago under William&#x27;s command, implying a general feudal levy from the Frankish states of Greece, which were vassals of the Prince of Achaea. Many of the most distinguished nobles of Frankish Greece also took part in the expedition. The Achaean host crossed the Gulf of Corinth at Naupaktos and marched to the Epirote capital of Arta, before crossing the Pindus at joining the forces of the other Frankish states at Thalassionon (possibly Elassona in northern Thessaly). Michael of Epirus in turn was accompanied by his elder son Nikephoros and further aided by his bastard son John Doukas, who brought with him many Vlachs from the Great Vlachia region of Thessaly. The Aragonese &quot;Chronicle of the Morea&quot; gives the totals of 8,000 heavily-armed and 12,000 lightly-armed troops for William&#x27;s army, including twenty dukes, counts, and barons; and 8,000 heavily-armed and 18,000 lightly-armed troops for the Epirote army. These numbers are universally considered as much exaggerated by modern historians.

On the Nicaean side, the army comprised not only native Greek contingents from Asia, Macedonia and Thrace, but also many mercenaries; according to the &quot;Chronicle of the Morea&quot;, 300 German knights, &quot;all select, all hand-picked&quot;, 1,500 Hungarian &quot;choice mounted archers&quot;, 600 Serbian horsemen, likewise &quot;all good archers&quot;, and even Bulgarian cavalry, as well as 1,500 Turkish and 2,000 Cuman cavalry. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; mentions that the Germans were led by the &quot;Duke of Karentana&quot;, usually identified with Carinthia. The duke at the time was Ulrich III, but he ruled for many years after 1259, and was probably not at the battle, where the &quot;Chronicle&quot; maintains that he was killed at the hand of Geoffrey of Briel, the Baron of Karytaina. The modern editor of the Greek version of the chronicle, , opined that the &quot;Duke of Karantana&quot; is a fictitious character symbolizing a brave warrior, and the name was chosen possibly under the influence of a corruption of the name Karytaina. It is also likely that Latin troops fought on the Nicaean side, although they are not explicitly mentioned: they were a prominent element of previous Nicaean armies, and Michael Palaiologos had relied on their support for his usurpation. The total size of the Nicaean army is nowhere reported, except for a reference in the Greek &quot;Chronicle&quot; that it comprised 27 regiments (). However, according to the historian Deno John Geanakoplos, &quot;the statements of the &quot;Chronicle of the Morea&quot; are often exaggerated&quot;, and &quot;one gets a clear impression from the sources [...] that the allied forces surpassed those of Nicaea in size&quot;.

== Differences in the sources ==
The main Byzantine sources, George Akropolites, Nikephoros Gregoras, and George Pachymeres, offer considerably divergent accounts on the exact course of events before and during the battle, while the Western sources, chiefly the Greek and French versions of the &quot;Chronicle of the Morea&quot; and the history of the Venetian Marino Sanudo Torcello, in turn differ from the Byzantine sources and from each other. The narrative of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; is generally considered less reliable, being riddled with errors and mix-ups, but often provides details not appearing elsewhere. The account of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; focuses not on Prince William of Villehardouin, but on his nephew Geoffrey of Briel, whose deeds in the battle are presented in length, and in a style reminiscent of contemporary epic poems on Achilles or Digenes Akritas, whereas William is almost mentioned in passing. Briel was the only male grandchild of the first Villehardouin Prince of Achaea, Geoffrey I of Villehardouin, and hence a potential claimant to the Principality. 

Akropolites emphasizes the Nicaeans&#x27; use of strategy, and his account describes &quot;a series of skirmishes on the road rather than a confrontation of two armies on a battlefield&quot;, giving the impression that &quot;the defeat of the allies at the hands of the Nicene forces came quickly and ingloriously&quot;, whereas the &quot;Chronicle&quot; is at pains to portray the fight as a heroic albeit doomed combat, exaggerating the number of the Nicaean troops, avoiding any mention of the Sicilian contingent, and stressing the role of Nicaean agents in spreading dissension among the allies. Gregoras and Pachymeres, while following the earlier account of Akropolites in the main, contain elements also found in the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, including the role of a Nicaean agent, and praise for the valiant conduct of the Achaean nobles.

As a result of the differences in the sources, numerous details of the battle remain unclear, from the exact date (proposed dates range from June to November), the location (Pelagonia or Kastoria), or the exact roles the various leaders played in the events. The two main suggestions for the date are by Donald Nicol, in early summer (July), and Deno Geanakoplos, in early fall (around September). The exact location of the battle has been disputed, as the only clear toponym given in the sources is Boril&#x27;s Wood (), which has been variously placed by modern researchers close to Prilep, Kastoria, or Bitola (then known as Pelagonia). Using the sources and the topography to reconstruct the movements of the armies, the modern scholars Freiderikos Rochontzis and Robert Mihajlovski have independently suggested as the battlefield the plain between Florina and Kaimakchalan, north of Kastoria, near the modern settlement of Vevi (formerly known as Banitsa); a strategically important location where the Battle of Lyncestis had been fought in 423 BC and the Battle of Vevi was fought in 1941.

== Battle ==

Akropolites puts the location of the first clashes between the two armies at Boril&#x27;s Wood. In view of their numerical disadvantage, the Nicaeans had no choice but to employ strategy to overcome their opponents, aiming at the cohesion of the enemy alliance. Like all Greeks, the Epirotes mistrusted and hated the Franks as a result of the Fourth Crusade and the oppression of the Orthodox Greeks by the Roman Catholic clergy in the Frankish states, while the Franks despised the Greeks as cowardly, devious and schismatic.

The John Palaiologos followed a deliberate strategy of attrition to wear down his opponents and impact their morale, while avoiding a direct confrontation. Akropolites ascribes this to advice given from the outset of the campaign by Michael Palaiologos to his brother. According to this plan, John distributed his men, leaving the heavily armed troops to occupy strong defensive positions on the hills, while his lighter Cuman, Turkish and Greek troops harassed the allied army with hit-and-run attacks, striking at their horses when they were being watered and plundering their supply trains. Faced with this constant harassment, Akropolites reports that the morale of the Epirote army withered, and Michael II with his troops withdrew towards Prilep, while John Doukas deserted the allied cause and went over to the Nicaeans. 

Gregoras, however, reports that Michael II&#x27;s flight was precipitated by John Palaiologos, who sent a false deserter to the Epirote camp, claiming that the Franks had secretly agreed with the to betray the Epirotes in exchange for money. Persuaded, the Epirote ruler immediately fled his camp with as many men as he could gather, while the rest of the Epirote army too dispersed after his flight became known. Pachymeres offers a completely different version, highlighting the discord present among the allies even before they met with the Nicaean army, allegedly as the result of some Achaean knights coveting John Doukas&#x27; beautiful Vlach wife. Matters were made worse when William of Villehardouin not only did not punish his men, but also insulted John Doukas for his illegitimate birth, infuriating the latter. John Doukas then entered into contact with John Palaiologos, and after extracting promises that his father and half-brother would not be harmed, persuaded them to withdraw during night. Pachymeres&#x27; account of William insulting John the Bastard is further confirmed by Marino Sanudo.
Whatever the true course of events, on the next morning, when the Epirote flight was discovered by their Latin allies, they too tried to withdraw, but it was too late. The Nicaeans fell upon them, and in addition, according to Pachymeres, John Doukas and his Vlachs attacked from the rear. Many Latins were killed, while most of the survivors were taken prisoner. Gregoras reports that the 400 Germans surrendered to only four Nicaeans (possibly high-ranking commanders), while the forces of William of Villehardouin scattered. The Prince himself was discovered hiding in a pile of hay (Akropolites) or a shrub (Pachymeres) near Kastoria, and some thirty of his most senior barons were likewise taken captive. 

The &quot;Chronicle of the Morea&quot; offers a variant account, but confuses the leading personages, claiming that &quot;Theodore Doukas&quot; (an error for John Doukas) was the commander of the Nicaean forces, and placing Nikephoros at the head of the Epirote army. According to the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, the Nicaean commander tried to frighten his opponents by lighting many camp fires and using cattle to simulate marching troops, and sent an agent to the allied camp to persuade the Despot of the vastly superior size of the Nicaean force. The stratagem worked in so far as the Epirote troops fled during the night, while the Nicaeans, emboldened by this, moved to confront the Achaeans. The Achaeans, with Geoffrey of Briel leading the van, managed to rout the German knights who were the Nicaeans&#x27; first line; but the ordered his Hungarian and Cuman horse archers to shoot indiscriminately at the horses of the Franks and the Germans, bringing the knights down and forcing them to surrender.

According to Geanakoplos, although differing in details, the various accounts can be reconciled to form a more complete picture of the battle. Certainly the crucial turning point, Michael II&#x27;s flight on the eve of the battle, is easy to explain even without a Nicaean stratagem: the Epirote ruler was disquieted by the presence of such a strong Frankish army, and feared that in the event of an allied victory, he would be likely to lose his own territory to the Latins, fears which would have been confirmed with the clash between his son John Doukas and William of Villehardouin in the days leading up to the battle. Conversely, if the Nicaeans won, not only his rule, but his own life would be in danger, leading him to choose flight instead.

== Aftermath ==

The battle was a decisive event for the subsequent history of the Balkans. With the collapse of the Epirote–Latin league, Michael Palaiologos was free to pursue the reconquest of Constantinople and the revival of the Byzantine Empire: the rump Latin Empire was now cut off from any aid, and the capture of Villehardouin deprived it, in the words of Donald Nicol, &quot;of its only capable defender&quot;. Already in 1260, Michael Palaiologos attacked Constantinople, as one of the knights taken prisoner in Pelagonia, and whose house was in the city walls, had promised to open a gate for the emperor&#x27;s troops. He failed to do so, and Palaiologos launched an unsuccessful assault on Galata instead. Constantinople was finally captured, almost by chance, by Alexios Strategopoulos on 25 July 1261, allowing for the re-establishment of the Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty. 

The Nicaean victory at Pelagonia also led to immediate, but short-lived, territorial expansion in Greece: John Palaiologos invaded Thessaly and the Duchy of Athens up to Thebes, while Alexios Strategopoulos and John Raoul Petraliphas were tasked with reducing Epirus proper. Strategopoulos and Petraliphas crossed the Pindus Mountains, bypassed Ioannina, which they left under siege, and captured the Epirote capital, Arta, forcing Michael II to flee to the island of Cephalonia. At Arta they found and released many Nicaean prisoners, including Akropolites. In the next year, however, the Nicaean successes were largely undone: John Doukas defected back to his father, and Michael II with an Italian mercenary army landed at Arta, and the Epirote population rallied to his cause. The Epirotes routed the Nicaeans, and Strategopoulos himself was captured and briefly held prisoner.

The battle was a particularly heavy blow to the Principality of Achaea. It was the first heavy defeat it had ever suffered, and at a stroke lost most of its soldiers and a greater part of its nobles. Alongside the Prince, his close relatives Anselin of Toucy and Geoffrey of Briel were also captured. As a result, the entire Morea peninsula was also opened up to Michael Palaiologos&#x27; ambitions. The emperor offered to set free Villehardouin and his nobles and provide for comfortable retainers for them, if they were to hand over the Principality to him; and while Villehardouin refused this offer, after the fall of Constantinople he finally agreed to hand over a number of fortresses and swear an oath of allegiance to Palaiologos in exchange for his freedom. This was ratified by the so-called &quot;Parliament of Ladies&quot; (as most of the male nobles of Achaea were prisoners), and in early 1262 Villehardouin was released, and the forts of Monemvasia and Mystras, as well as the district of Mani, were handed over to the Byzantines. From there the Byzantines would launch repeated attempts to conquer Achaea, and although these failed for the moment, they were extremely costly to the Achaeans. In the longer term, the foothold gained by the Byzantines in the region would form the nucleus of the Despotate of the Morea, where Byzantine culture enjoyed its last flowering before the Ottoman conquest.

The defeat at Pelagonia also ended the supremacy of the Principality of Achaea in the affairs of Frankish Greece, and the Nicaean/Byzantine offensive that followed further curtailed its political independence. No longer able to confront the resurgent Byzantines, Prince William turned to the successors of Manfred of Sicily, the Angevins of Naples, for aid, as, faced with a common enemy, did the Greek rulers of Epirus and Thessaly. The result was the Treaty of Viterbo in 1267, after which, in the words of the historian Peter Lock, &quot;The Frankish states of the Aegean [...] became virtual marcher lordships of the Angevin kingdom of Naples and no longer lordships in their own right. They become subsumed in the power politics of the Mediterranean as viewed from a Neapolitan perspective&quot;.

<doc id="811714" wikidata="Q5156015" url="?curid=811714" title="Comparison of the healthcare systems in Canada and the United States">
<text>A comparison of the healthcare systems in Canada and the United States is often made by government, public health and public policy analysts. The two countries had similar healthcare systems before Canada changed its system in the 1960s and 1970s. The United States spends much more money on healthcare than Canada, on both a per-capita basis and as a percentage of GDP. In 2006, per-capita spending for health care in Canada was US$3,678; in the U.S., US$6,714. The U.S. spent 15.3% of GDP on healthcare in that year; Canada spent 10.0%. In 2006, 70% of healthcare spending in Canada was financed by government, versus 46% in the United States. Total government spending per capita in the U.S. on healthcare was 23% higher than Canadian government spending. U.S. government expenditure on healthcare was just under 83% of total Canadian spending (public and private).

Studies have come to different conclusions about the result of this disparity in spending. A 2007 review of all studies comparing health outcomes in Canada and the US in a Canadian peer-reviewed medical journal found that &quot;health outcomes may be superior in patients cared for in Canada versus the United States, but differences are not consistent.&quot; Some of the noted differences were a higher life expectancy in Canada, as well as a lower infant mortality rate than the United States.

One commonly cited comparison, the 2000 World Health Organization&#x27;s ratings of &quot;overall health service performance&quot;, which used a &quot;composite measure of achievement in the level of health, the distribution of health, the level of responsiveness and fairness of financial contribution&quot;, ranked Canada 30th and the US 37th among 191 member nations. This study rated the US &quot;responsiveness&quot;, or quality of service for individuals receiving treatment, as 1st, compared with 7th for Canada. However, the average life expectancy for Canadians was 80.34 years compared with 78.6 years for residents of the US.

The WHO&#x27;s study methods were criticized by some analyses.
While life-expectancy and infant mortality are commonly used in comparing nationwide health care, they are in fact affected by many factors other than the quality of a nation&#x27;s health care system, including individual behavior and population makeup. A 2007 report by the Congressional Research Service carefully summarizes some recent data and noted the &quot;difficult research issues&quot; facing international comparisons.

==Government involvement==
In 2004, government funding of healthcare in Canada was equivalent to $1,893 per person. In the US, government spending per person was $2,728.

The Canadian healthcare system is composed of at least 10 mostly autonomous provincial healthcare systems that report to their provincial governments, and a federal system which covers the military and First Nations. This causes a significant degree of variation in funding and coverage within the country.

===History===
Canada and the US had similar healthcare systems in the early 1960s, but now have a different mix of funding mechanisms. Canada&#x27;s universal single-payer healthcare system covers about 70% of expenditures, and the Canada Health Act requires that all insured persons be fully insured, without co-payments or user fees, for all medically necessary hospital and physician care. About 91% of hospital expenditures and 99% of total physician services are financed by the public sector. In the United States, with its mixed public-private system, 16% or 45 million American residents are uninsured at any one time. The U.S. is the only OECD country not to have some form of universal health coverage. Mexico established a universal healthcare program by November 2008 and Turkey did so in 2012.

===Health insurance===

The governments of both nations are closely involved in healthcare. The central structural difference between the two is in health insurance. In Canada, the federal government is committed to providing funding support to its provincial governments for healthcare expenditures as long as the province in question abides by accessibility guarantees as set out in the Canada Health Act, which explicitly prohibits billing end users for procedures that are covered by Medicare. While some label Canada&#x27;s system as &quot;socialized medicine&quot;, health economists do not use that term. Unlike systems with public delivery, such as the UK, the Canadian system provides public coverage for a combination of public and private delivery. Princeton University health economist Uwe E. Reinhardt says that single-payer systems are not &quot;socialized medicine&quot; but &quot;social insurance&quot; systems, since providers (such as doctors) are largely in the private sector. Similarly, Canadian hospitals are controlled by private boards or regional health authorities, rather than being part of government.
In the US, direct government funding of health care is limited to Medicare, Medicaid, and the State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), which cover eligible senior citizens, the poor, disabled persons, and children. The federal government also runs the Veterans Health Administration, which provides care directly to retired or disabled veterans, their families, and survivors through medical centers and clinics.

The U.S. government also runs the Military Health System. In fiscal year 2007, the MHS had a total budget of $39.4 billion and served approximately 9.1 million beneficiaries, including active-duty personnel and their families, and retirees and their families. The MHS includes 133,000 personnel, 86,000 military and 47,000 civilian, working at more than 1,000 locations worldwide, including 70 inpatient facilities and 1,085 medical, dental, and veterans&#x27; clinics.

One study estimates that about 25 percent of the uninsured in the U.S. are eligible for these programs but remain unenrolled; however, extending coverage to all who are eligible remains a fiscal and political challenge.

For everyone else, health insurance must be paid for privately. Some 59% of U.S. residents have access to health care insurance through employers, although this figure is decreasing, and coverages as well as workers&#x27; expected contributions vary widely. Those whose employers do not offer health insurance, as well as those who are self-employed or unemployed, must purchase it on their own. Nearly 27 million of the 45 million uninsured U.S. residents worked at least part-time in 2007, and more than a third were in households that earned $50,000 or more per year.

===Funding===

Despite the greater role of private business in the US, federal and state agencies are increasingly involved, paying about 45% of the $2.2 trillion the nation spent on medical care in 2004. The U.S. government spends more on healthcare than on Social Security and national defense combined, according to the Brookings Institution.

Beyond its direct spending, the US government is also highly involved in healthcare through regulation and legislation. For example, the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973 provided grants and loans to subsidize Health Maintenance Organizations and contained provisions to stimulate their popularity. HMOs had been declining before the law; by 2002 there were 500 such plans enrolling 76 million people.

The Canadian system has been 69–75% publicly funded, though most services are delivered by private providers, including physicians (although they may derive their revenue primarily from government billings). Although some doctors work on a purely fee-for-service basis (usually family physicians), some family physicians and most specialists are paid through a combination of fee-for-service and fixed contracts with hospitals or health service management organizations.

Canada&#x27;s universal health plans do not cover certain services. Non-cosmetic dental care is covered for children up to age 14 in some provinces. Outpatient prescription drugs are not required to be covered, but some provinces have drug cost programs that cover most drug costs for certain populations. In every province, seniors receiving the Guaranteed Income Supplement have significant additional coverage; some provinces expand forms of drug coverage to all seniors, low-income families, those on social assistance, or those with certain medical conditions. Some provinces cover all drug prescriptions over a certain portion of a family&#x27;s income. Drug prices are also regulated, so brand-name prescription drugs are often significantly cheaper than in the U.S. Optometry is covered in some provinces and is sometimes covered only for children under a certain age. Visits to non-physician specialists may require an additional fee. Also, some procedures are only covered under certain circumstances. For example, circumcision is not covered, and a fee is usually charged when a parent requests the procedure; however, if an infection or medical necessity arises, the procedure would be covered.

According to Dr. Albert Schumacher, former president of the Canadian Medical Association, an estimated 75 percent of Canadian healthcare services are delivered privately, but funded publicly.

Frontline practitioners whether they&#x27;re GPs or specialists by and large are not salaried. They&#x27;re small hardware stores. Same thing with labs and radiology clinics ... The situation we are seeing now are more services around not being funded publicly but people having to pay for them, or their insurance companies. We have sort of a passive privatization.

==Coverage and access==
There is a significant difference in coverage for medical care in Canada and the United States. In Canada, all citizens and permanent residents are covered by the health care system, while in the United States, studies suggest that 7% of U.S. citizens do not have adequate health insurance, if any at all.

In both Canada and the United States, access can be a problem. In Canada, 5% of Canadian residents have not been able to find a regular doctor, with a further 9% having never looked for one. In such cases, however, they continue to have coverage for options such as walk-in clinics or emergency rooms. The U.S. data is evidenced in a 2007 Consumer Reports study on the U.S. health care system which showed that the underinsured account for 4% of the U.S. population and live with skeletal health insurance that barely covers their medical needs and leaves them unprepared to pay for major medical expenses. The Canadian data comes from the 2003 Canadian Community Health Survey,

In the U.S., the federal government does not guarantee universal healthcare to all its citizens, but publicly funded healthcare programs help to provide for the elderly, disabled, the poor, and children. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act or EMTALA also ensures public access to emergency services. The EMTALA law forces emergency healthcare providers to stabilize an emergency health crisis and cannot withhold treatment for lack of evidence of insurance coverage or other evidence of the ability to pay. EMTALA does not absolve the person receiving emergency care of the obligation to meet the cost of emergency healthcare not paid for at the time and it is still within the right of the hospital to pursue any debtor for the cost of emergency care provided. In Canada, emergency room treatment for legal Canadian residents is not charged to the patient at time of service but is met by the government.

According to the United States Census Bureau, 59.3% of U.S. citizens have health insurance related to employment, 27.8% have government-provided health-insurance; nearly 9% purchase health insurance directly (there is some overlap in these figures), and 15.3% (45.7 million) were uninsured in 2007. An estimated 25 percent of the uninsured are eligible for government programs but unenrolled. About a third of the uninsured are in households earning more than $50,000 annually. A 2003 report by the Congressional Budget Office found that many people lack health insurance only temporarily, such as after leaving one employer and before a new job. The number of chronically uninsured (uninsured all year) was estimated at between 21 and 31 million in 1998. Another study, by the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, estimated that 59 percent of uninsured adults have been uninsured for at least two years. One indicator of the consequences of Americans&#x27; inconsistent health care coverage is a study in &quot;Health Affairs&quot; that concluded that half of personal bankruptcies involved medical bills. Although other sources dispute this, it is possible that medical debt is the principal cause of bankruptcy in the United States.

A number of clinics provide free or low-cost non-emergency care to poor, uninsured patients. The National Association of Free Clinics claims that its member clinics provide $3 billion in services to some 3.5 million patients annually.

A peer-reviewed comparison study of healthcare access in the two countries published in 2006 concluded that U.S. residents are one third less likely to have a regular medical doctor (80% vs 85%), one fourth more likely to have unmet healthcare needs (13% vs 11%), and are more than twice as likely to forgo needed medicines (1.7% vs 2.6%). The study noted that access problems &quot;were particularly dire for the US uninsured.&quot; Those who lack insurance in the U.S. were much less satisfied, less likely to have seen a doctor, and more likely to have been unable to receive desired care than both Canadians and insured Americans.

Another cross-country study compared access to care based on immigrant status in Canada and the U.S. Findings showed that in both countries, immigrants had worse access to care than non-immigrants. Specifically, immigrants living in Canada were less likely to have timely Pap tests compared with native-born Canadians; in addition, immigrants in the U.S. were less likely to have a regular medical doctor and an annual consultation with a health care provider compared with native-born Americans. In general, immigrants in Canada had better access to care than those in the U.S., but most of the differences were explained by differences in socioeconomic status (income, education) and insurance coverage across the two countries. However, immigrants in the U.S. were more likely to have timely Pap tests than immigrants in Canada.

Cato Institute has expressed concerns that the U.S. government has restricted the freedom of Medicare patients to spend their own money on healthcare, and has contrasted these developments with the situation in Canada, where in 2005 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the province of Quebec could not prohibit its citizens from purchasing covered services through private health insurance. The institute has urged the Congress to restore the right of American seniors to spend their own money on medical care.

==Coverage for mental health==
The Canada Health Act covers the services of psychiatrists, who are medical doctors with additional training in psychiatry but does not cover treatment by a psychologist or psychotherapist unless the practitioner is also a medical doctor. Goods and Services Tax or Harmonized Sales Tax (depending on the province) applies to the services of psychotherapists. Some provincial or territorial programs and some private insurance plans may cover the services of psychologists and psychotherapists, but there is no federal mandate for such services in Canada. In the U.S., the Affordable Care Act includes prevention, early intervention, and treatment of mental and/or substance use disorders as an &quot;essential health benefit&quot; (EHB) that must be covered by health plans that are offered through the Health Insurance Marketplace. Under the Affordable Care Act, most health plans must also cover certain preventive services without a copayment, co-insurance, or deductible. In addition, the U.S. Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) of 2008 mandates &quot;parity&quot; between mental health and/or substance use disorder (MH/SUD) benefits and medical/surgical benefits covered by a health plan. Under that law, if a health care plan offers mental health and/or substance use disorder benefits, it must offer the benefits on par with the other medical/surgical benefits it covers.

==Wait times==
One complaint about both the U.S. and Canadian systems is waiting times, whether for a specialist, major elective surgery, such as hip replacement, or specialized treatments, such as radiation for breast cancer; wait times in each country are affected by various factors. In the United States, access is primarily determined by whether a person has access to funding to pay for treatment and by the availability of services in the area and by the willingness of the provider to deliver service at the price set by the insurer. In Canada, the wait time is set according to the availability of services in the area and by the relative need of the person needing treatment.

As reported by the Health Council of Canada, a 2010 Commonwealth survey found that 39% of Canadians waited 2 hours or more in the emergency room, versus 31% in the U.S.; 43% waited 4 weeks or more to see a specialist, versus 10% in the U.S. The same survey states that 37% of Canadians say it is difficult to access care after hours (evenings, weekends or holidays) without going to the emergency department compared to over 34% of Americans. Furthermore, 47% of Canadians and 50% of Americans who visited emergency departments over the past two years feel that they could have been treated at their normal place of care if they were able to get an appointment.

A 2018 survey conducted by the Fraser Institute, a conservative-libertarian public policy think tank, found that wait times in Canada for a variety of medical procedures reached &quot;an all-time high&quot;. Appointment duration (meeting with physicians) averaged under two minutes. These very fast appointments are a result of physicians attempting to accommodate for the number of patients using the medical system. In these appointments, however, diagnoses or prescriptions were rarely given, where the patients instead were almost always referred to specialists to receive treatment for their medical issues. According to the Fraser Institute, patients in Canada waited an average of 19.8 weeks to receive treatment, regardless of whether they were able to see a specialist or not. In the U.S., the average wait time for a first-time appointment is 24 days (≈3 times faster than in Canada); wait times for Emergency Room (ER) services averaged 24 minutes (more than 4x faster than in Canada); wait times for specialists averaged between 3–6.4 weeks (over 6x faster than in Canada). In response to these findings, the Physicians for a National Health Program (PNHP), an advocacy organization comprising more than 20,000 American medical professionals, identified statistical problems with the Fraser Institute&#x27;s reporting. Namely, the report relies on a survey of Canadian physicians with a response rate of only 15.8%. Distributing these responses amongst the 12 specialties and ten provinces results in single-digit tallies for 63 per cent of the categories, and often only one physician falling into a given category. Conversely, a study conducted by the Canadian Institute for Health Information indicated that Canada has been successful in delivering care within medically recommended wait times.

In the U.S., patients on Medicaid, the low-income government programs, can wait up to a maximum of 12 weeks to see specialists (12 weeks less than the average wait time in Canada). Because Medicaid payments are low, some have claimed that some doctors do not want to see Medicaid patients in Canada. For example, in Benton Harbor, Michigan, specialists agreed to spend one afternoon every week or two at a Medicaid clinic, which meant that Medicaid patients had to make appointments not at the doctor&#x27;s office, but at the clinic, where appointments had to be booked months in advance. A 2009 study found that on average the wait in the United States to see a medical specialist is 20.5 days.

In a 2009 survey of physician appointment wait times in the United States, the average wait time for an appointment with an orthopedic surgeon in the country as a whole was 17 days. In Dallas, Texas the wait was 45 days (the longest wait being 365 days). Nationwide across the U.S. the average wait time to see a family doctor was 20 days. The average wait time to see a family practitioner in Los Angeles, California was 59 days and in Boston, Massachusetts it was 63 days.

Studies by the Commonwealth Fund found that 42% of Canadians waited 2 hours or more in the emergency room, vs. 29% in the U.S.; 57% waited 4 weeks or more to see a specialist, vs. 23% in the U.S., but Canadians had more chances of getting medical attention at nights, or on weekends and holidays than their American neighbors without the need to visit an ER (54% compared to 61%). Statistics from the Fraser Institute in 2008 indicate that the average wait time between the time when a general practitioner refers a patient for care and the receipt of treatment was almost four and a half months in 2008, roughly double what it had been 15 years before.

A 2003 survey of hospital administrators conducted in Canada, the U.S., and three other countries found dissatisfaction with both the U.S. and Canadian systems. For example, 21% of Canadian hospital administrators, but less than 1% of American administrators, said that it would take over three weeks to do a biopsy for possible breast cancer on a 50-year-old woman; 50% of Canadian administrators versus none of their American counterparts said that it would take over six months for a 65-year-old to undergo a routine hip replacement surgery. However, U.S. administrators were the most negative about their country&#x27;s system. Hospital executives in all five countries expressed concerns about staffing shortages and emergency department waiting times and quality.

In a letter to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Robert Bell, the President and CEO of University Health Network, Toronto, said that Michael Moore&#x27;s film &quot;Sicko&quot; &quot;exaggerated the performance of the Canadian health system — there is no doubt that too many patients still stay in our emergency departments waiting for admission to scarce hospital beds.&quot; However, &quot;Canadians spend about 55% of what Americans spend on health care and have longer life expectancy and lower infant mortality rates. Many Americans have access to quality healthcare. All Canadians have access to similar care at a considerably lower cost.&quot; There is &quot;no question&quot; that the lower cost has come at the cost of &quot;restriction of supply with sub-optimal access to services,&quot; said Bell. A new approach is targeting waiting times, which are reported on public websites.

In 2007, Shona Holmes, a Waterdown, Ontario woman who had a Rathke&#x27;s cleft cyst removed at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona, sued the Ontario government for failing to reimburse her $95,000 in medical expenses.
Holmes had characterized her condition as an emergency, said she was losing her sight and portrayed her condition as a life-threatening brain cancer.
In July 2009 Holmes agreed to appear in television ads broadcast in the United States warning Americans of the dangers of adopting a Canadian-style health care system. The ads she appeared in triggered debates on both sides of the border. After her ad appeared critics pointed out discrepancies in her story, including that Rathke&#x27;s cleft cyst, the condition she was treated for, was not a form of cancer, and was not life-threatening.

==Price of health care and administration overheads==
Healthcare is one of the most expensive items of both nations&#x27; budgets. In the United States, the various levels of government spend more per capita than levels of government do in Canada. In 2004, Canada government-spending was $2,120 (in US dollars) per person, while the United States government-spending was $2,724.

Administrative costs are also higher in the United States than in Canada. A 1999 report found that after exclusions, administration accounted for 31.0% of healthcare expenditures in the United States, as compared with 16.7% in Canada. In looking at the insurance element, in Canada, the provincial single-payer insurance system operated with overheads of 1.3%, comparing favourably with private insurance overheads (13.2%), U.S. private insurance overheads (11.7%) and U.S. Medicare and Medicaid program overheads (3.6% and 6.8% respectively). The report concluded by observing that gap between U.S. and Canadian spending on administration had grown to $752 per capita and that a large sum might be saved in the United States if the U.S. implemented a Canadian-style system.

However, U.S. government spending covers less than half of all healthcare costs. Private spending is also far greater in the U.S. than in Canada. In Canada, an average of $917 was spent annually by individuals or private insurance companies for health care, including dental, eye care, and drugs. In the U.S., this sum is $3,372. In 2006, healthcare consumed 15.3% of U.S. annual GDP. In Canada, 10% of GDP was spent on healthcare. This difference is a relatively recent development. In 1971 the nations were much closer, with Canada spending 7.1% of GDP while the U.S. spent 7.6%.

Some who advocate against greater government involvement in healthcare have asserted that the difference in costs between the two nations is partially explained by the differences in their demographics. Illegal immigrants, more prevalent in the U.S. than in Canada, also add a burden to the system, as many of them do not carry health insurance and rely on emergency rooms — which are legally required to treat them under EMTALA — as a principal source of care. In Colorado, for example, an estimated 80% of undocumented immigrants do not have health insurance.

Through all entities in its public–private system, the US spends more per capita than any other nation in the world, but is the only wealthy industrialized country in the world that lacks some form of universal healthcare. In March 2010, the US Congress passed regulatory reform of the American &#x27;health insurance system. However, since this legislation is not fundamental healthcare reform, it is unclear what its effect will be and as the new legislation is implemented in stages, with the last provision in effect in 2018, it will be some years before any empirical evaluation of the full effects on the comparison could be determined.

Healthcare costs in both countries are rising faster than inflation. As both countries consider changes to their systems, there is debate over whether resources should be added to the public or private sector. Although Canadians and Americans have each looked to the other for ways to improve their respective health care systems, there exists a substantial amount of conflicting information regarding the relative merits of the two systems. In the U.S., Canada&#x27;s mostly monopsonistic health system is seen by different sides of the ideological spectrum as either a model to be followed or avoided.

===Medical professionals===
Some of the extra money spent in the United States goes to physicians, nurses, and other medical professionals. According to health data collected by the OECD, average income for physicians in the United States in 1996 was nearly twice that for physicians in Canada. In 2012, the gross average salary for doctors in Canada was CDN$328,000. Out of the gross amount, doctors pay for taxes, rent, staff salaries and equipment. In Canada, less than half of doctors are specialists whereas more than 70% of doctors are specialists in the U.S.

Canada has fewer doctors per capita than the United States. In the U.S, there were 2.4 doctors per 1,000 people in 2005; in Canada, there were 2.2. Some doctors leave Canada to pursue career goals or higher pay in the U.S., though significant numbers of physicians from countries such as China, India, Pakistan and South Africa immigrate to practice in Canada. Many Canadian physicians and new medical graduates also go to the U.S. for post-graduate training in medical residencies. As it is a much larger market, new and cutting-edge sub-specialties are more widely available in the U.S. as opposed to Canada. However, statistics published in 2005 by the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI), show that, for the first time since 1969 (the period for which data are available), more physicians returned to Canada than moved abroad.

===Drugs===
Both Canada and the United States have limited programs to provide prescription drugs to the needy. In the U.S., the introduction of Medicare Part D has extended partial coverage for pharmaceuticals to Medicare beneficiaries. In Canada all drugs given in hospitals fall under Medicare, but other prescriptions do not. The provinces all have some programs to help the poor and seniors have access to drugs, but while there have been calls to create one, no national program exists. About two thirds of Canadians have private prescription drug coverage, mostly through their employers. In both countries, there is a significant population not fully covered by these programs. A 2005 study found that 20% of Canada&#x27;s and 40% of America&#x27;s sicker adults did not fill a prescription because of cost.

Furthermore, the 2010 Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Survey indicates that 4% of Canadians indicated that they did not visit a doctor because of cost compared with 22% of Americans. Additionally, 21% of Americans have said that they did not fill a prescription for medicine or have skipped doses due to cost. That is compared with 10% of Canadians.

One of the most important differences between the two countries is the much higher cost of drugs in the United States. In the U.S., $728 per capita is spent each year on drugs, while in Canada it is $509. At the same time, consumption is higher in Canada, with about 12 prescriptions being filled per person each year in Canada and 10.6 in the United States. The main difference is that patented drug prices in Canada average between 35% and 45% lower than in the United States, though generic prices are higher. The price differential for brand-name drugs between the two countries has led Americans to purchase upward of $1 billion US in drugs per year from Canadian pharmacies.

There are several reasons for the disparity. The Canadian system takes advantage of centralized buying by the provincial governments that have more market heft and buy in bulk, lowering prices. By contrast, the U.S. has explicit laws that prohibit Medicare or Medicaid from negotiating drug prices. In addition, price negotiations by Canadian health insurers are based on evaluations of the clinical effectiveness of prescription drugs, allowing the relative prices of therapeutically similar drugs to be considered in context. The Canadian Patented Medicine Prices Review Board also has the authority to set a fair and reasonable price on patented products, either comparing it to similar drugs already on the market, or by taking the average price in seven developed nations. Prices are also lowered through more limited patent protection in Canada. In the U.S., a drug patent may be extended five years to make up for time lost in development. Some generic drugs are thus available on Canadian shelves sooner.

The pharmaceutical industry is important in both countries, though both are net importers of drugs. Both countries spend about the same amount of their GDP on pharmaceutical research, about 0.1% annually

===Technology===
The United States spends more on technology than Canada. In a 2004 study on medical imaging in Canada, it was found that Canada had 4.6 MRI scanners per million population while the U.S. had 19.5 per million. Canada&#x27;s 10.3 CT scanners per million also ranked behind the U.S., which had 29.5 per million. The study did not attempt to assess whether the difference in the number of MRI and CT scanners had any effect on the medical outcomes or were a result of overcapacity but did observe that MRI scanners are used more intensively in Canada than either the U.S. or Great Britain. This disparity in the availability of technology, some believe, results in longer wait times. In 1984 wait times of up to 22 months for an MRI were alleged in Saskatchewan. However, according to more recent official statistics (2007), all emergency patients receive MRIs within 24 hours, those classified as urgent receive them in under 3 weeks and the maximum elective wait time is 19 weeks in Regina and 26 weeks in Saskatoon, the province&#x27;s two largest metropolitan areas.

According to the Health Council of Canada&#x27;s 2010 report &quot;Decisions, Decisions: Family doctors as gatekeepers to prescription drugs and diagnostic imaging in Canada&quot;, the Canadian federal government invested $3 billion over 5 years (2000–2005) in relation to diagnostic imaging and agreed to invest a further $2 billion to reduce wait times. These investments led to an increase in the number of scanners across Canada as well as the number of exams being performed. The number of CT scanners increased from 198 to 465 and MRI scanners increased from 19 to 266 (more than tenfold) between 1990 and 2009. Similarly, the number of CT exams increased by 58% and MRI exams increased by 100% between 2003 and 2009. In comparison to other OECD countries, including the US, Canada&#x27;s rates of MRI and CT exams falls somewhere in the middle. Nevertheless, the Canadian Association of Radiologists claims that as many as 30% of diagnostic imaging scans are inappropriate and contribute no useful information.

===Malpractice litigation===

The extra cost of malpractice lawsuits is a proportion of health spending in both the U.S. (1.7% in 2002) and Canada (0.27% in 2001 or $237 million). In Canada the total cost of settlements, legal fees, and insurance comes to $4 per person each year, but in the United States it is over $16. Average payouts to American plaintiffs were $265,103, while payouts to Canadian plaintiffs were somewhat higher, averaging $309,417. However, malpractice suits are far more common in the U.S., with 350% more suits filed each year per person. While malpractice costs are significantly higher in the U.S., they constitute a small proportion of total medical spending. The total cost of defending and settling malpractice lawsuits in the U.S. in 2004 was over $28 billion. Critics say that defensive medicine consumes up to 9% of American healthcare expenses., but CBO studies suggest that it is much smaller.

===Ancillary expenses===
There are a number of ancillary costs that are higher in the U.S. Administrative costs are significantly higher in the U.S.; government mandates on record keeping and the diversity of insurers, plans and administrative layers involved in every transaction result in greater administrative effort. One recent study comparing administrative costs in the two countries found that these costs in the U.S. are roughly double what they are in Canada. Another ancillary cost is marketing, both by insurance companies and health care providers. These costs are higher in the U.S., contributing to higher overall costs in that nation.

==Healthcare outcomes==

In the World Health Organization&#x27;s rankings of healthcare system performance among 191 member nations published in 2000, Canada ranked 30th and the U.S. 37th, while the overall health of Canadians was ranked 35th and Americans 72nd. However, the WHO&#x27;s methodologies, which attempted to measure how efficiently health systems translate expenditure into health, generated broad debate and criticism.

Researchers caution against inferring healthcare quality from some health statistics. June O&#x27;Neill and Dave O&#x27;Neill point out that &quot;...life expectancy and infant mortality are both poor measures of the efficacy of a health care system because they are influenced by many factors that are unrelated to the quality and accessibility of medical care&quot;.

In 2007, Gordon H. Guyatt et al. conducted a meta-analysis, or systematic review, of all studies that compared health outcomes for similar conditions in Canada and the U.S., in &quot;Open Medicine&quot;, an open-access peer-reviewed Canadian medical journal. They concluded, &quot;Available studies suggest that health outcomes may be superior in patients cared for in Canada versus the United States, but differences are not consistent.&quot; Guyatt identified 38 studies addressing conditions including cancer, coronary artery disease, chronic medical illnesses and surgical procedures. Of 10 studies with the strongest statistical validity, 5 favoured Canada, 2 favoured the United States, and 3 were equivalent or mixed. Of 28 weaker studies, 9 favoured Canada, 3 favoured the United States, and 16 were equivalent or mixed. Overall, results for mortality favoured Canada with a 5% advantage, but the results were weak and varied. The only consistent pattern was that Canadian patients fared better in kidney failure.

In terms of population health, life expectancy in 2006 was about two and a half years longer in Canada, with Canadians living to an average of 79.9 years and Americans 77.5 years. Infant and child mortality rates are also higher in the U.S. Some comparisons suggest that the American system underperforms Canada&#x27;s system as well as those of other industrialized nations with universal coverage. For example, a ranking by the World Health Organization of health care system performance among 191 member nations, published in 2000, ranked Canada 30th and the U.S. 37th, and the overall health of Canada 35th to the American 72nd. The WHO did not merely consider health care outcomes, but also placed heavy emphasis on the health disparities between rich and poor, funding for the health care needs of the poor, and the extent to which a country was reaching the potential health care outcomes they believed were possible for that nation. In an international comparison of 21 more specific quality indicators conducted by the Commonwealth Fund International Working Group on Quality Indicators, the results were more divided. One of the indicators was a tie, and in 3 others, data was unavailable from one country or the other. Canada performed better on 11 indicators; such as survival rates for colorectal cancer, childhood leukemia, and kidney and liver transplants. The U.S. performed better on 6 indicators, including survival rates for breast and cervical cancer, and avoidance of childhood diseases such as pertussis and measles. The 21 indicators were distilled from a starting list of 1000. The authors state that, &quot;It is an opportunistic list, rather than a comprehensive list.&quot;

Some of the difference in outcomes may also be related to lifestyle choices. The OECD found that Americans have slightly higher rates of smoking and alcohol consumption than do Canadians as well as significantly higher rates of obesity. A joint US-Canadian study found slightly higher smoking rates among Canadians. Another study found that Americans have higher rates not only of obesity, but also of other health risk factors and chronic conditions, including physical inactivity, diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

While a Canadian systematic review stated that the differences in the systems of Canada and the United States could not alone explain differences in healthcare outcomes, the study didn&#x27;t consider that over 44,000 Americans die every year due to not having a single payer system for healthcare in the United States and it didn&#x27;t consider the millions more that live without proper medical care due to a lack of insurance.

The United States and Canada have different racial makeups, different obesity rates and different alcoholism rates, which would likely cause the US to have a shorter average life expectancy and higher infant mortality even with equal healthcare provided. The US population is 12.2% African Americans and 16.3% Hispanic Americans (2010 Census), whereas Canada has 2.5% African Canadians and 0.97% Hispanic Canadians (2006 Census). African Americans have higher mortality rates than any other racial or ethnic group for eight of the top ten causes of death. The cancer incidence rate among African Americans is 10% higher than among European Americans. U.S. Latinos have higher rates of death from diabetes, liver disease, and infectious diseases than do non-Latinos. Adult African Americans and Latinos have approximately twice the risk as European Americans of developing diabetes. The infant mortality rates for African Americans is twice that of whites. Unfortunately, directly comparing infant mortality rates between countries is difficult, as countries have different definitions of what qualifies as an infant death.

Another issue with comparing the two systems is the baseline health of the patients for which the systems must treat. Canada&#x27;s obesity rate of 14.3% is about half of that of the United States 30.6%. On average, obesity reduces life expectancy by 6–7 years.

A 2004 study found that Canada had a slightly higher mortality rate for acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) because of the more conservative Canadian approach to revascularizing (opening) coronary arteries.

===Cancer===
Numerous studies have attempted to compare the rates of cancer incidence and mortality in Canada and the U.S., with varying results. Doctors who study cancer epidemiology warn that the diagnosis of cancer is subjective, and the &quot;reported&quot; incidence of a cancer will rise if screening is more aggressive, even if the &quot;real&quot; cancer incidence is the same. Statistics from different sources may not be compatible if they were collected in different ways. The proper interpretation of cancer statistics has been an important issue for many years. Dr. Barry Kramer of the National Institutes of Health points to the fact that cancer incidence rose sharply over the past few decades as screening became more common. He attributes the rise to increased detection of benign early stage cancers that pose little risk of metastasizing. Furthermore, though patients who were treated for these benign cancers were at little risk, they often have trouble finding health insurance after the fact.

Cancer survival time increases with later years of diagnosis, because cancer treatment improves, so cancer survival statistics can only be compared for cohorts in the same diagnosis year. For example, as doctors in British Columbia adopted new treatments, survival time for patients with metastatic breast cancer increased from 438 days for those diagnosed in 1991–1992, to 667 days for those diagnosed in 1999–2001.

An assessment by Health Canada found that cancer mortality rates are almost identical in the two countries. Another international comparison by the National Cancer Institute of Canada indicated that incidence rates for most, but not all, cancers were higher in the U.S. than in Canada during the period studied (1993–1997). Incidence rates for certain types, such as colorectal and stomach cancer, were actually higher in Canada than in the U.S. In 2004, researchers published a study comparing health outcomes in the Anglo countries. Their analysis indicates that Canada has greater survival rates for both colorectal cancer and childhood leukemia, while the United States has greater survival rates for Non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma as well as breast and cervical cancer.

A study based on data from 1978 through 1986 found very similar survival rates in both the United States and in Canada. However, a study based on data from 1993 through 1997 found lower cancer survival rates among Canadians than among Americans.

A few comparative studies have found that cancer survival rates vary more widely among different populations in the U.S. than they do in Canada. Mackillop and colleagues compared cancer survival rates in Ontario and the U.S. They found that cancer survival was more strongly correlated with socio-economic class in the U.S. than in Ontario. Furthermore, they found that the American survival advantage in the four highest quintiles was statistically significant. They strongly suspected that the difference due to prostate cancer was a result of greater detection of asymptomatic cases in the U.S. Their data indicates that neglecting the prostate cancer data reduces the American advantage in the four highest quintiles and gives Canada a statistically significant advantage in the lowest quintile. Similarly, they believe differences in screening mammography may explain part of the American advantage in breast cancer. Exclusion of breast and prostate cancer data results in very similar survival rates for both countries.

Hsing et al. found that prostate cancer mortality incidence rate ratios were lower among U.S. whites than among any of the nationalities included in their study, including Canadians. U.S. African Americans in the study had lower rates than any group except for Canadians and U.S. whites. Echoing the concerns of Dr. Kramer and Professor Mackillop, Hsing later wrote that reported prostate cancer incidence depends on screening. Among whites in the U.S., the death rate for prostate cancer remained constant, even though the incidence increased, so the additional reported prostate cancers did not represent an increase in real prostate cancers, said Hsing. Similarly, the death rates from prostate cancer in the U.S. increased during the 1980s and peaked in early 1990. This is at least partially due to &quot;attribution bias&quot; on death certificates, where doctors are more likely to ascribe a death to prostate cancer than to other diseases that affected the patient, because of greater awareness of prostate cancer or other reasons.

Because health status is &quot;considerably affected&quot; by socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, such as level of education and income, &quot;the value of comparisons in isolating the impact of the healthcare system on outcomes is limited,&quot; according to health care analysts. Experts say that the incidence and mortality rates of cancer cannot be combined to calculate survival from cancer. Nevertheless, researchers have used the ratio of mortality to incidence rates as one measure of the effectiveness of healthcare. Data for both studies was collected from registries that are members of the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, an organization dedicated to developing and promoting uniform data standards for cancer registration in North America.

===Racial and ethnic differences===
The U.S. and Canada differ substantially in their demographics, and these differences may contribute to differences in health outcomes between the two nations. Although both countries have white majorities, Canada has a proportionately larger immigrant minority population. Furthermore, the relative size of different ethnic and racial groups vary widely in each country. Hispanics and peoples of African descent constitute a much larger proportion of the U.S. population. Non-Hispanic North American aboriginal peoples constitute a much larger proportion of the Canadian population. Canada also has a proportionally larger South Asian and East Asian population. Also, the proportion of each population that is immigrant is higher in Canada.

A study comparing aboriginal mortality rates in Canada, the U.S. and New Zealand found that aboriginals in all three countries had greater mortality rates and shorter life expectancies than the white majorities. That study also found that aboriginals in Canada had both shorter life expectancies and greater infant mortality rates than aboriginals in the United States and New Zealand. The health outcome differences between aboriginals and whites in Canada was also larger than in the United States.

Though few studies have been published concerning the health of Black Canadians, health disparities between whites and African Americans in the U.S. have received intense scrutiny. African Americans in the U.S. have significantly greater rates of cancer incidence and mortality. Drs. Singh and Yu found that neonatal and postnatal mortality rates for African Americans are more than double the non-Hispanic white rate. This difference persisted even after controlling for household income and was greatest in the highest income quintile. A Canadian study also found differences in neonatal mortality between different racial and ethnic groups. Although Canadians of African descent had a greater mortality rate than whites in that study, the rate was somewhat less than double the white rate.

The racially heterogeneous Hispanic population in the U.S. has also been the subject of several studies. Although members of this group are significantly more likely to live in poverty than are non-Hispanic whites, they often have disease rates that are comparable to or better than the non-Hispanic white majority. Hispanics have lower cancer incidence and mortality, lower infant mortality, and lower rates of neural tube defects. Singh and Yu found that infant mortality among Hispanic sub-groups varied with the racial composition of that group. The mostly white Cuban population had a neonatal mortality rate (NMR) nearly identical to that found in non-Hispanic whites and a postnatal mortality rate (PMR) that was somewhat lower. The largely Mestizo, Mexican, Central, and South American Hispanic populations had somewhat lower NMR and PMR. The Puerto Ricans who have a mix of white and African ancestry had higher NMR and PMR rates.

==Impact on economy==
In 2002, automotive companies claimed that the universal system in Canada saved labour costs. In 2004, healthcare cost General Motors $5.8 billion, and increased to $7 billion. The UAW also claimed that the resulting escalating healthcare premiums reduced workers&#x27; bargaining powers.

==Flexibility==
In Canada, increasing demands for healthcare, due to the aging population, must be met by either increasing taxes or reducing other government programs. In the United States, under the current system, more of the burden will be taken up by the private sector and individuals.

Since 1998, Canada&#x27;s successive multibillion-dollar budget surpluses have allowed a significant injection of new funding to the healthcare system, with the stated goal of reducing waiting times for treatment. However, this may be hampered by the return to deficit spending as of the 2009 Canadian federal budget.

One historical problem with the U.S. system was known as job lock, in which people become tied to their jobs for fear of losing their health insurance. This reduces the flexibility of the labor market. Federal legislation passed since the mid-1980s, particularly COBRA and HIPAA, has been aimed at reducing job lock. However, providers of group health insurance in many states are permitted to use experience rating and it remains legal in the United States for prospective employers to investigate a job candidate&#x27;s health and past health claims as part of a hiring decision. Someone who has recently been diagnosed with cancer, for example, may face job lock not out of fear of losing their health insurance, but based on prospective employers not wanting to add the cost of treating that illness to their own health insurance pool, for fear of future insurance rate increases. Thus, being diagnosed with an illness can cause someone to be forced to stay in their current job.

==Politics of health==
===Politics of each country===

====Canada====

In Canada, the right-wing and now defunct Reform Party and its successor, the Conservative Party of Canada considered increasing the role of the private sector in the Canadian system. Public backlash caused these plans to be abandoned, and the Conservative government that followed re-affirmed its commitment to universal public medicine.

In Canada, it was Alberta under the Conservative government that had experimented most with increasing the role of the private sector in healthcare. Measures included the introduction of private clinics allowed to bill patients for some of the cost of a procedure, as well as &#x27;boutique&#x27; clinics offering tailored personal care for a fixed preliminary annual fee.

====United States====
In the U.S., President Bill Clinton attempted a significant restructuring of health care, but the effort collapsed under political pressure against it despite tremendous public support. The 2000 U.S. election saw prescription drugs become a central issue, although the system did not fundamentally change. In the 2004 U.S. election healthcare proved to be an important issue to some voters, though not a primary one.
In 2006, Massachusetts adopted a plan that vastly reduced the number of uninsured making it the state with the lowest percentage of non-insured residents in the union. It requires everyone to buy insurance and subsidizes insurance costs for lower income people on a sliding scale. Some have claimed that the state&#x27;s program is unaffordable, which the state itself says is &quot;a commonly repeated myth&quot;. In 2009, in a minor amendment, the plan did eliminate dental, hospice and skilled nursing care for certain categories of noncitizens covering 30,000 people (victims of human trafficking and domestic violence, applicants for asylum and refugees) who do pay taxes.

In July 2009, Connecticut passed into law a plan called SustiNet, with the goal of achieving health care coverage of 98% of its residents by 2014.

In 2017, President Donald Trump had declared his intent to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but was unsuccessful.

===Private care===
The Canada Health Act of 1984 &quot;does not directly bar private delivery or private insurance for publicly insured services,&quot; but provides financial disincentives for doing so. &quot;Although there are laws prohibiting or curtailing private health care in some provinces, they can be changed,&quot; according to a report in the New England Journal of Medicine. Governments attempt to control health care costs by being the sole purchasers and thus they do not allow private patients to bid up prices. Those with non-emergency illnesses such as cancer cannot pay out of pocket for time-sensitive surgeries and must wait their turn on waiting lists. According to the Canadian Supreme Court in its 2005 ruling in &quot;Chaoulli v. Quebec&quot;, waiting list delays &quot;increase the patient&#x27;s risk of mortality or the risk that his or her injuries will become irreparable.&quot; The ruling found that a Quebec provincial ban on private health insurance was unlawful, because it was contrary to Quebec&#x27;s own legislative act, the 1975 Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms.

===Consumer-driven healthcare===
In the United States, Congress has enacted laws to promote consumer-driven healthcare with health savings accounts (HSAs), which were created by the Medicare bill signed by President George W. Bush on December 8, 2003. HSAs are designed to provide tax incentives for individuals to save for future qualified medical and retiree health expenses. Money placed in such accounts is tax-free. To qualify for HSAs, individuals must carry a high-deductible health plan (HDHP). The higher deductible shifts some of the financial responsibility for health care from insurance providers to the consumer. This shift towards a market-based system with greater individual responsibility increased the differences between the US and Canadian systems.

Some economists who have studied proposals for universal healthcare worry that the consumer driven healthcare movement will reduce the social redistributive effects of insurance that pools high-risk and low-risk people together. This concern was one of the driving factors behind a provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, informally known as &quot;Obamacare&quot;, which limited the types of purchases which could be made with HSA funds. For example, as of January 1, 2011, these funds can no longer be used to buy over-the-counter drugs without a medical prescription.

<doc id="811715" wikidata="Q2717022" url="?curid=811715" title="The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife">
<text>, also known as Girl Diver and Octopi, Diver and Two Octopi, etc., is a woodblock-printed design by the Japanese artist Hokusai. It is included in (&#x27;Young Pines&#x27;), a three-volume book of erotica first published in 1814, and has become Hokusai&#x27;s most famous design. Playing with themes popular in Japanese art, it depicts a young diver entwined sexually with a pair of octopuses.

==History and description==
&quot;The Dream of the Fisherman&#x27;s Wife&quot; is the most famous image in , published in three volumes from 1814. The book is a work of (erotic art) within the ukiyo-e genre. The image depicts a woman, evidently an (a shell diver), enveloped in the limbs of two octopuses. The larger of the two mollusks performs cunnilingus on her, while the smaller one, his offspring, assists by fondling the woman&#x27;s mouth and left nipple. In the text above the image the woman and the creatures express their mutual sexual pleasure from the encounter.

All designs in the publication are untitled; this design is generally known in Japanese as , translated variously into English. Richard Douglas Lane calls it &quot;Girl Diver and Octopi&quot;; Matthi Forrer calls it &quot;Pearl Diver and Two Octopi [sic]&quot;; and Danielle Talerico calls it &quot;Diver and Two Octopuses&quot;. The open book measures .

== Text on the print ==
The full text, which surrounds the maiden and octopuses, as translated by James Heaton and Toyoshima Mizuho:
==Interpretations==

Scholar Danielle Talerico notes that the image would have recalled to the minds of contemporary viewers the story of Princess Tamatori, highly popular in the Edo period. In this story, Tamatori is a modest shell diver who marries Fujiwara no Fuhito of the Fujiwara clan, who is searching for a pearl stolen from his family by Ryūjin, the dragon god of the sea. Vowing to help, Tamatori dives down to Ryūjin&#x27;s undersea palace of Ryūgū-jō, and is pursued by the god and his army of sea creatures, including octopuses. She cuts open her own breast and places the jewel inside; this allows her to swim faster and escape, but she dies from her wound soon after reaching the surface.

The Tamatori story was a popular subject in ukiyo-e art. The artist, Utagawa Kuniyoshi, produced works based on it, which often include octopuses among the creatures being evaded by the bare-breasted diver. In the text above Hokusai&#x27;s image, the big octopus says he will bring the girl to Ryūjin&#x27;s undersea palace, strengthening the connection to the Tamatori legend. &quot;The Dream of the Fisherman&#x27;s Wife&quot; is not the only work of Edo-period art to depict erotic relations between a woman and an octopus. Some early carvings show cephalopods fondling nude women. Hokusai&#x27;s contemporary Yanagawa Shigenobu created an image of a woman receiving cunnilingus from an octopus very similar to Hokusai&#x27;s in his collection of 1830.

Talerico notes that earlier Western critics such as Edmond de Goncourt and Jack Hillier interpreted the work as a rape scene. She notes that these scholars would have seen it apart from the collection and without understanding the text and visual references, depriving it of its original context. Goncourt did, however, know its original context, which he describes in a passage of his monograph on Hokusai. According to Chris Uhlenbeck and Margarita Winkel, &quot;[t]his print is testimony to how our interpretation of an image can be distorted when seen in isolation and without understanding the text.&quot;

==Influence==
The image is often cited as a forerunner of tentacle erotica, a motif that has been popular in modern Japanese animation and manga since the late 20th century, popularized by author Toshio Maeda. Modern tentacle erotica similarly depicts sex between women and tentacled beasts; the sex in modern depictions is typically forced, as opposed to Hokusai&#x27;s mutually pleasurable interaction. Psychologist and critic Jerry S. Piven is skeptical that Hokusai&#x27;s playful image could account for the violent depictions in modern media, arguing that these are instead a product of the turmoil experienced throughout Japanese society following World War II, which was in turn reflective of existing, underlying currents of cultural trauma. Scholar Holger Briel argues that &quot;only in a society that already has a predilection for monsters and is used to interacting with octopods such images might arise&quot;, citing Hokusai&#x27;s print an early exemplar of such a tradition.
The work influenced later artists such as Félicien Rops, Auguste Rodin, Louis Aucoc, Fernand Khnopff and Pablo Picasso. Picasso drew his own private version in 1903, which was displayed in a 2009 Museu Picasso exhibit titled &quot;Secret Images&quot;, alongside 26 other drawings and engravings by Picasso, displayed next to Hokusai&#x27;s original and 16 other Japanese prints, portraying the influence of 19th century Japanese art on Picasso&#x27;s work. Picasso also later fully painted works that were directly influenced by the woodblock print, such as 1932&#x27;s &quot;Reclining Nude&quot;, where the woman in pleasure is also the octopus, capable of pleasuring herself. In 2003, a derivative work by Australian painter David Laity, titled &quot;The Dream of the Fisherman&#x27;s Wife&quot;, sparked a minor obscenity controversy when it was shown at a gallery in Melbourne; after receiving complaints, police investigated and decided it did not break the city&#x27;s anti-pornography laws. Hokusai&#x27;s print has had a wide influence on the modern Japanese-American artist Masami Teraoka, who has created images of women, including a recurring &quot;pearl diver&quot; character, being pleasured by cephalopods as a symbol of female sexual power.

The so-called (&quot;Octopus aria&quot;) in Pietro Mascagni&#x27;s opera &quot;Iris&quot; (1898), on a libretto by Luigi Illica, may have been inspired by this print. The main character Iris describes a screen she had seen in a Buddhist temple when she was a child, depicting an octopus coiling its limbs around a smiling young woman and killing her. She recalls a Buddhist priest explaining: &quot;That octopus is Pleasure... That octopus is Death!&quot;

The scene is recreated in a &quot;surreal, slightly horrific form&quot; in Kaneto Shindo&#x27;s 1981 fictionalized Hokusai biopic &quot;Edo Porn&quot;. The print is featured briefly in Park Chan-wook&#x27;s film &quot;The Handmaiden&quot; and is intended to illustrate the perverted nature of Uncle Kouzuki&#x27;s oppression of Lady Hideko to Sook-Hee. The print is given more air time in several episodes of the television series &quot;Mad Men&quot;, first on the office wall of a senior CEO, perhaps as a symbol of &quot;monstrous alpha male power&quot;; the print is given to Peggy Olson by Roger Sterling, Jr. near the series&#x27; end. Olson decides to hang the print in her office, part of the culmination of her storyline of becoming comfortable as an executive.

The print has been cited by Isabel Coixet as influential in a sexual scene in her film &quot;Elisa &amp; Marcela&quot;, as a &quot;non-masculine sexual reference&quot;.

<text>The Coffin Stone, also known as the Coffin and the Table Stone, is a large sarsen stone at the foot of Blue Bell Hill near Aylesford in the south-eastern English county of Kent. Now lying horizontally, the stone probably once stood upright nearby. Various archaeologists have argued that the stone was part of a now-destroyed chambered long barrow constructed in the fourth millennium BCE, during Britain&#x27;s Early Neolithic period.

If a chambered long barrow did indeed previously exist on the site, it would have been built by pastoralist communities shortly after the introduction of agriculture to Britain from continental Europe. Long-barrow building was an architectural tradition widespread across Neolithic Europe. It consisted of various localized regional variants; one of these was in the vicinity of the River Medway, examples of which are now known as the Medway Megaliths. The Coffin Stone lies on the eastern side of the river, not far from the chambered long barrows of Little Kit&#x27;s Coty House, Kit&#x27;s Coty House, and the (now destroyed) Smythe&#x27;s Megalith. Three other examples, the Coldrum Long Barrow, Addington Long Barrow, and Chestnuts Long Barrow, remain on the western side of the river.

The Coffin Stone is a rectangular slab lying flat that measures in length, in breadth, and about in width. Two smaller stones lie nearby and another large slab is now located atop it. In the 1830s it was reported that local farmers found human bones near the stone. An archaeological excavation of the site led by Paul Garwood took place in 2008–09; it found that the megalith was placed in its present location only in the 15th or 16th centuries. The archaeologists found no evidence of a chambered long barrow at the location, and suggested that the Coffin Stone might once have stood upright in the vicinity.

==Location==
The Coffin Stone is in Great Tottington Farm, which is now used as a vineyard.
As of 2005, the site was not signposted, but could be reached via a stile along the Pilgrims&#x27; Way. The Coffin Stone is situated about north-west of Little Kit&#x27;s Coty House. It is also a short distance north of the Tottington springhead.

==Context==

The Early Neolithic was a revolutionary period of British history. Between 4500 and 3800 BCE, it saw a widespread change in lifestyle as the communities living in the British Isles adopted agriculture as their primary form of subsistence, abandoning the hunter-gatherer lifestyle that had characterised the preceding Mesolithic period. This came about through contact with continental societies; it is unclear to what extent this can be attributed to an influx of migrants or to indigenous Mesolithic Britons adopting agricultural technologies from continental Europe. The region of modern Kent was a key area for the arrival of continental settlers and visitors, because of its position on the estuary of the River Thames and its proximity to the continent.

Britain was largely forested in this period; widespread forest clearance did not occur in Kent until the Late Bronze Age (c.1000 to 700 BCE). Environmental data from the vicinity of the White Horse Stone, a putatively prehistoric monolith near the River Medway, supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and Maloideae (apples and their allies). Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal grain farming or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the Early Neolithic economy on the island was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic life.

===Medway Megaliths===

Across Western Europe, the Early Neolithic marked the first period in which humans built monumental structures. These included chambered long barrows, rectangular or oval earthen tumuli that had a chamber built into one end. Some of these chambers were constructed out of timber, and others were built using large stones, now known as &quot;megaliths&quot;. Long barrows often served as tombs, housing the physical remains of the dead within their chamber. Individuals were rarely buried alone in the Early Neolithic, instead being interred in collective burials with other members of their community. Chambered tombs were built all along the Western European seaboard during the Early Neolithic, from southeastern Spain to southern Sweden, taking in most of the British Isles; the architectural tradition was introduced to Britain from continental Europe in the first half of the fourth millennium BCE. There are stone buildings—like Göbekli Tepe in modern Turkey—that predate them, but the chambered long barrows constitute humanity&#x27;s first widespread tradition of construction using stone.

Although now all in a ruinous state and not retaining their original appearance, at the time of construction the Medway Megaliths would have been some of the largest and most visually imposing Early Neolithic funerary monuments in Britain. Grouped along the River Medway as it cuts through the North Downs, they constitute the most southeasterly group of megalithic monuments in the British Isles, and the only megalithic group in eastern England. The archaeologists Brian Philp and Mike Dutto deemed the Medway Megaliths to be &quot;some of the most interesting and well known&quot; archaeological sites in Kent, while the archaeologist Paul Ashbee described them as &quot;the most grandiose and impressive structures of their kind in southern England&quot;.

The Medway Megaliths can be divided into two separate clusters: one to the west of the River Medway and the other on Blue Bell Hill to the east, between apart. The western group includes Coldrum Long Barrow, Addington Long Barrow, and the Chestnuts Long Barrow. The eastern group consists of Smythe&#x27;s Megalith, Kit&#x27;s Coty House, Little Kit&#x27;s Coty House, and several other stones that might have once been parts of chambered tombs, most notably the White Horse Stone. It is not known if they were all built at the same time, and it is not known if they each served the same function or whether there was a hierarchy in their usage.

The Medway long barrows all conformed to the same general design plan, and are all aligned on an east to west axis. Each had a stone chamber at the eastern end of the mound, and they each probably had a stone facade flanking the entrance. They had internal heights of up to , making them taller than most other chambered long barrows in Britain. The chambers were constructed from sarsen sandstone, a dense, hard, and durable stone that occurs naturally throughout Kent, having formed out of sand from the Eocene epoch. Early Neolithic builders would have selected blocks from the local area, and then transported them to the site of the monument to be erected.

These common architectural features among the Medway Megaliths indicate a strong regional cohesion with no direct parallels elsewhere in the British Isles. Nevertheless, as with other regional groupings of Early Neolithic long barrows—such as the Cotswold-Severn group in south-western Britain—there are also various idiosyncrasies in the different monuments, such as Coldrum&#x27;s rectilinear shape, the Chestnut Long Barrow&#x27;s facade, and the long, thin mounds at Addington and Kit&#x27;s Coty. These variations might have been caused by the tombs being altered and adapted over the course of their use; in this scenario, the monuments would be composite structures.

The builders of these monuments were probably influenced by pre-existing tomb-shrines they were aware of. Whether those people had grown up locally, or moved into the Medway area from elsewhere is not known. Based on a stylistic analysis of their architecture, the archaeologist Stuart Piggott thought that the plan behind the Medway Megaliths had originated in the area around the Low Countries; Glyn Daniel thought their design derived from Scandinavia, John H. Evans thought Germany, and Ronald F. Jessup suggested an influence from the Cotswold-Severn group. Ashbee found their close clustering reminiscent of the megalithic tomb-shrine traditions of continental Northern Europe, and emphasised that the Medway Megaliths were a regional manifestation of a tradition widespread across Early Neolithic Europe. He concluded that a precise place of origin was &quot;impossible to indicate&quot; with the available evidence.

==Description==

The Coffin Stone is a large rectangular slab. In the 1870s, it was measured as being in length, in breadth, and about in width. The archaeologist Timothy Champion suggested that &quot;the Coffin Stone&quot; was &quot;an appropriate name&quot; for the megalith given its appearance. Given the size of the megalith, it is likely that—had this been part of a chamber—the chamber could have measured as much as in height and would have been the largest of all the known Medway Megaliths. There may have been a stone façade in front of the chamber, and if so, these may be the stones now found in the Tottington&#x27;s western springhead. At some point in the twentieth century, another large sarsen slab was placed on top of the Coffin Stone.

In Evans&#x27; view, the nineteenth-century discovery of human remains at the site &quot;strongly suggests&quot; that the Coffin Stone was the remnant of a destroyed chambered long barrow. Jessup agreed, suggesting that &quot;in all probability&quot; it was part of such a monument. Some archaeologists have argued that evidence of a barrow could be visibly identified; Ashbee noted that a mound was visible &quot;in much reduced form until the 1950s but can today [2005] hardly be traced&quot;. In 2007, Champion noted that the trace of the mound could still be seen. Had this once been a long barrow then it may have been flanked by kerbstones; various stones found nearby may have once been these. Had there been a barrow, it is likely that ditches would have flanked its sides. Archaeological investigation in the 2000s found no clear evidence of a chambered long barrow having stood on the site.

==Antiquarian and archaeological investigation==

===Antiquarian descriptions===
The antiquarian William Stukeley made note of the Coffin Stone in his posthumously published 1776 work &quot;Itinerarium Curiosum&quot;. This book contained the first published illustration of the monument. Stukeley had been alerted to the site by his friend Hercules Ayleway, who in a 1722 letter told Stukeley of &quot;a large stone 15-foot long, called the coffin&quot;. The site was next described by John Thorpe in his 1788 book &quot;Custumale Roffense&quot;; he believed that it was Stukeley himself who had given it the name of the &quot;coffin stone&quot;. Thorpe visited the site and provided two illustrations of it; one of these showed a spindly tree growing from around the stone.

Circa 1840, the antiquarian Beale Poste visited the site and drew a sketch of it. In his unpublished manuscript on Kentish antiquities, he reported that in 1838 or 1839 a sack full of human remains had been recovered close to the Coffin Stone. In 1871, E. H. W. Dunkin provided an account of the site in &quot;The Reliquary&quot;. He related that as well as being known as &quot;The Coffin&quot;, it was also called &quot;The Table Stone&quot;. He believed that it had once stood upright on that same spot, representing &quot;a sepulchral memorial or mênhir of some ancient British chieftain&quot;. Dunkin recorded that human remains—including two human skulls, other bones, and charcoal—had been found nearby during the 1836 removal of a hedge that &quot;concealed more than one-half of the stone&quot;. He also noted that fragments of Roman pottery had been found nearby, and that local farmers had been moving sarsen blocks to the adjacent springhead; &quot;more than fifty blocks, large and small, lie about the yard&quot;. In 1872, James Fergusson referenced the site in his &quot;Rude Stone Monuments in All Countries; Their Age and Uses&quot;, referring to the presence of &quot;two obelisks, known to country people as the coffin-stones—probably from their shape&quot;.

In 1893, the antiquarian George Payne described the monument in his &quot;Collectanea Cantiana&quot;, noting that locally it was known as both the Coffin Stone and the General&#x27;s Stone. Ashbee later suggested that Payne was actually confusing the Coffin Stone with the General&#x27;s Stone, which was a separate megalith found several hundred metres away, in the same field as Kit&#x27;s Coty House. In his 1924 publication dealing with Kent, the archaeologist O. G. S. Crawford, then working as the archaeological officer for the Ordnance Survey, listed the Coffin Stone alongside the other Medway Megaliths. In his 1927 book &quot;In Kentish Pilgrimland&quot;, William Coles Finch included a plate of the Coffin Stone; the photograph featured his son standing on it and shows various broken sarsens piled up at the monument&#x27;s eastern end. Finch&#x27;s plate was the first published photograph of the megalith, and was likely also the last published depiction of it before another large sarsen was placed over it. Finch measured the sarsen and found it to be wider than Thorpe had reported, also making note of plough damage and breakages. In a 1946 article on the folklore involving the Medway Megaliths, Evans noted that the Coffin Stone, like several other megalithic features in the area, was associated with a burial following the fifth-century Battle of Aylesford. The idea that one or more of these monuments had been linked to the battle was first mooted by early modern antiquarians, before entering local folklore.

===Archaeological investigation===

In 2005, Ashbee noted that he had raised the issue of the site&#x27;s preservation with English Heritage and that their representative had informed him that they would not consider according it legal protection because they thought it a natural feature. The idea that the stone might have been natural had previously been voiced by the archaeologist Glyn Daniel on his visit to the site. Ashbee commented that &quot;it has, however, for long been manifest that English Heritage is more concerned with commercialisation than affording appropriate protection to our national monuments&quot;.

Ashbee noted that any evidence for a chambered tomb at the site might be ascertained through geophysics or excavation. Led by the archaeologist Paul Garwood, a programme of field surveys, geophysical research, and excavations took place at the site as part of the Medway Valley Prehistoric Landscapes Project during 2008 and 2009. This found evidence for prehistoric activity in the vicinity of the megalith but was unable to accurately date these archaeological features. The investigators established that there was no evidence that a chambered long barrow had once stood there. They determined that the stone had been moved to its present location at some point in the post-medieval period (1450 to 1600). There was a large hollow in the chalk nearby which was akin to that found by excavators near to the Cuckoo Stone in Wiltshire; the archaeologists interpreted this as an extraction hollow, suggesting that the Coffin Stone had once stood upright at that spot.

<doc id="811720" wikidata="Q2001209" url="?curid=811720" title="Punch-Out!! (1984 video game)">
<text>is a 1984 arcade boxing video game developed by Nintendo R&amp;D3 and published by Nintendo. It was the inaugural game in the &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot; series.

The original arcade game was a global commercial success, becoming the top-performing arcade game of 1984 in the United States. It produced an arcade sequel known as &quot;Super Punch-Out!!&quot;, a spinoff of the series titled &quot;Arm Wrestling&quot;, a highly popular version for the NES originally known as &quot;Mike Tyson&#x27;s Punch Out!!&quot;, and &quot;Super Punch-Out!!&quot; for the SNES.

The arcade game introduced recurring characters such as Glass Joe, Bald Bull, and Mr. Sandman. It was also the debut project at Nintendo for composer Koji Kondo, better known for his later contributions to the &quot;Super Mario&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series.

== Gameplay ==

In the game, the player takes the role of a green-haired unnamed boxer (sometimes claimed to be Little Mac from the NES versions), known by three initials the player chooses when the game begins. During matches, the player&#x27;s boxer is viewed from behind and above as a wireframe so the opponent can be seen. The player must time his punches, dodges and blocks in order to defeat the opposing boxer. Opponents&#x27; impending offensive moves are telegraphed by subtle eye changes (the whites of the eyes flash yellow), but the player must ultimately predict what moves the opponent will make and react appropriately.

Once the player defeats the last opponent, the opponents repeat with increased difficulty. The player has one 3-minute round to score a knockout and will automatically lose if time runs out. A fighter who is knocked down three times in one round will be unable to rise, leading to a knockout. In the event the player loses, the computer-controlled victor will taunt the player and the corner man for the player will try to entice the player to play again (&quot;Come on, Get up and fight!&quot;) via the game&#x27;s distinctive digitized speech. Players are only allowed one continue per play through. Like many games made during the Golden Age of Arcade Games, there is no actual ending and the game continuously loops until the player loses.

The game is a modified upright, and was unusual in that it requires two video monitors, one atop the other, for the game&#x27;s display. The top monitor is used to display statistics and fighter portraits, while the bottom one is the main game display (similar to Nintendo&#x27;s Multi-Screen Game &amp; Watch titles and the Nintendo DS) with the gameplay and power meters (representing stamina) for each fighter. Apart from this, the game is more or less a standard upright. The game has a joystick and three buttons. Two buttons control left and right punches, one for each arm (denoted by &quot;Left!&quot;, or &quot;Right!&quot; when hitting the head, or &quot;body blow!&quot; when hitting the body with either arm). A large button on the console allows the player to deliver a powerful uppercut or right hook, but only when the &quot;KO&quot; meter a meter on the top of the bottom display is completely full. The meter increases when the player successfully lands a punch, decreases when the opponent lands one, and drops to zero when the player is knocked down. Once the meter is full, the corner man&#x27;s digitized speech encourages the player to either &quot;Put him away!&quot; or &quot;Knock him out!&quot; 

== Development and release ==
The game was developed in 1983 and released in February 1984. Genyo Takeda from the Integrated Research &amp; Development Division was the lead developer, and Shigeru Miyamoto designed the characters. It was released in the first quarter of 1984, when Nintendo was making several coin-operated arcade machines. Nintendo had an excessive number of video monitors after the success of the &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; series, basing the purchases on the estimate for the demand for arcade games. They were offered a proposition to make an arcade game that used two monitors. They chose to make a boxing game, which utilized the ability to zoom in and out of an object. This was a feature more commonly found in games that involve flying such as flight simulators, but the developers chose boxing because they thought it would be a different way to use it.

Miyamoto and Takeda discussed an earlier arcade game created by Takeda: &quot;EVR RACE&quot;, a horse racing game from 1975, which used a video tape. It was a mechanical game, and was hard to maintain after it was released and had many breakdowns. While they were developing &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot;, laserdisc-based games were considered to be the next major advancement in the arcade industry. However, the maintenance requirement would be very large if they released laserdisc-based games worldwide. Despite this, domestic sales people wanted something like laserdisc, so they tried to find if it could be done with semiconductors. Miyamoto explained that that&#x27;s why they were interested in microchips that could perform zooming and show pictures at a similar size as a laserdisc. However, he called it a &quot;rascal of a project&quot;, explaining that when he made &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, he had to animate each rolling barrel pixel by pixel. When he asked if they could use processing on the hardware side to rotate the image, they said &quot;it&#x27;s not impossible&quot;, changing from &quot;it can&#x27;t be done.&quot;

He stated that a lot of new things were being created, but most of it was still under development. They told Miyamoto that they could zoom in or rotate the image, but not both at once. They were planning on using the new microchips as well as the two monitors, considering lining them up side by side and making a big racing game, but it was not powerful enough to accomplish this, only able to expand one of the images. Takeda stated that if they could only expand one image, it could be a person. This eventually allowed it to become a boxing game, with one opponent, deciding that one monitor was good enough for a boxing game. They were stuck at that point, but thought that a boxing arena has big lights and banners hanging from the ceiling with things like &quot;World Heavyweight Title Match&quot; written on them. The game would also feature several meters, so they thought it would be more fun to have two screens instead of one.

Mario, Luigi, Donkey Kong, and Donkey Kong Junior all appear in the audience. The game&#x27;s title music, also heard in the arcade version of &quot;Super Punch-Out!!&quot; and the NES version of &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot;, is actually the &quot;Gillette Look Sharp March&quot;. This jingle, originally heard in Gillette radio and television commercials in the 1950s, was later used as the theme song to the &quot;Gillette Cavalcade of Sports&quot;, which aired boxing matches.

== Reception ==
The arcade game was a hit in all regions for Nintendo. In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot; on their April 15, 1984 issue as being the second top-grossing upright/cockpit arcade cabinet of the month.

In North America, &quot;Punch-Out&quot; took the arcade market by storm according to &quot;Play Meter&quot; magazine in 1984, capitalizing on the success of sports video games following &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot; (1983). It was one of the more successful arcade games during the post-boom period of the mid-1980s. &quot;Punch-Out&quot; topped the US arcade charts during 1984, including the &quot;RePlay&quot; charts in July (upright cabinets) and December, and the &quot;Play Meter&quot; charts for dedicated arcade cabinets from August 1 through November 15. &quot;Punch-Out&quot; went on to become the top-performing arcade game of 1984 in the United States.

The arcade game was reviewed in the August 1984 issue of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot;, published in July 1984. The magazine gave the game a positive review, describing it as a &quot;knock-out&quot; and a &quot;fabulous boxing game&quot;. The review also praised the graphics as being &quot;great&quot; and &quot;cartoon-style&quot; and concluded that it is &quot;a very addictive game which is great fun to play.&quot;

&quot;Punch-Out!!&quot; was later marked in the &quot;Killer List of Videogames&quot; Top 100, as one of their top 100 best games of all time. They also listed it as the Game of the Year for the year 1984. In 1995, &quot;Flux&quot; magazine rated Punch-Out!! 21st in its &quot;Top 100 Video Games.&quot; In 1996, &quot;GamesMaster&quot; ranked the game 83rd on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time.&quot;

== Legacy ==
In &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U&quot; and &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, series protagonist Little Mac appears as a playable fighter. The character features a set of wireframe alternate costumes based on his appearance from the original arcade games. Little Mac also features a special mechanic based on the KO gauge from the arcade titles, which, once full, can usually let him instantly KO an opponent with a powerful uppercut.

=== Re-releases, sequels, and spin-offs ===
During the same year, an arcade sequel to &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot; titled &quot;Super Punch-Out!!&quot; was developed and released by Nintendo, which has fewer, but tougher boxers to fight against.

In 1985, a spin-off called &quot;Arm Wrestling&quot; was developed and released in the arcades only in North America by the same company, which is based on real arm wrestling.

In 1987, the growing popularity of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) caused the development and release of &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot; for the NES console to happen. Several elements, such as opponents and their names, were changed for this version. In particular, professional boxer Mike Tyson was added as the game&#x27;s final boss. In 1990, when the contract licensing the use of Tyson&#x27;s name in the console version expired, Nintendo replaced Tyson with an original character named Mr. Dream, re-releasing it as &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot; (or &quot;Punch-Out!! featuring Mr. Dream&quot;). Like &quot;Mike Tyson&#x27;s Punch-Out!!&quot;, &quot;Punch-Out!! featuring Mr. Dream&quot; bore no further resemblance to the arcade version.

During its release, the Game &amp; Watch game called &quot;Boxing&quot; was re-released as &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot;, which used the front box art of the Mr. Dream version as its package art. Sometimes it was released with different cover art.

A Super Nintendo Entertainment System title, &quot;Super Punch-Out!!&quot; was released in 1994. It was far more faithful to the arcade stand-up gameplay; however, it was not a direct port either.

A Wii title, &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot; was released in 2009. It is a reboot of the &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot; series, that brought back many characters from the previous games, as well as introducing Disco Kid and Donkey Kong as opponents.

On September 13, 2017, Nintendo announced during a Nintendo Direct that they would be re-releasing some of their classic arcade games on the Nintendo Switch, and that &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot; would be one of the several games that would be re-released. It was released on March 30, 2018.

<text>The Jhai Foundation is a non-profit organisation working mainly in Laos.

The foundation&#x27;s primary project is bringing communication services to rural communities lacking electricity or telephones. They developed the &quot;Jhai PC and Communication System&quot;, a solid state, low energy consuming computer that can be powered by a foot-crank generator built into a bicycle frame or solar energy, and uses a wireless network to provide VoIP and Internet services.

The JhaiPC runs Linux with a localised version of KDE. The hardware and software design and user documentation for the JhaiPC are completely open and have been released through SourceForge.net.

With the minimal communication technology provided by the JhaiPC small businesses, such as farmers in Ban Phon Kam, are able to get better prices for their products. Jhai is also introducing organic farming techniques, fair trade marketing and direct sales to these farmers.

<text>100 Bullets is an American comic book published by DC Comics under its Vertigo imprint. Written by Brian Azzarello and illustrated by Eduardo Risso, the comic book ran for 100 issues and won the Eisner Award and Harvey Award.

==Style==
Both the writing and artwork in &quot;100 Bullets&quot; exemplifies the noir and pulp genres of popular modern fiction. Consistent with noir convention, most of the characters are deeply flawed. As is also common in pulp and noir genres, &quot;100 Bullets&quot; frequently portrays stylized and graphic violence.

&quot;100 Bullets&quot; is notable for creator Brian Azzarello&#x27;s realistic use of regional and local accents, as well as the frequent use of slang and oblique, metaphorical language in his characters&#x27; dialogue.

Initially presented as a series of self-contained episodic stories, &quot;100 Bullets&quot; developed into a sprawling crime saga in which all the characters and events were connected.

==Plot==
The core concept of &quot;100 Bullets&quot; is based on the question of people willing to act on the desire of violent revenge if given the means, opportunity, and a reasonable chance to succeed. Many of the first issues involve the mysterious Agent Graves approaching someone who has been a victim of a terrible wrong. Graves gives them the opportunity to take revenge by providing a handgun, 100 bullets, and documentation about the primary target responsible for their woes. He informs the candidate the bullets are completely untraceable by any law enforcement investigation, and as soon as they are found at any crime scene, investigations will immediately cease.

Although all the revenge murders enabled by Agent Graves are presented as justifiable, the candidates are neither rewarded nor punished for accepting the offer other than their own personal satisfaction. Several people decline, but others who accept find varied success or failure. The attaché and Graves&#x27; &quot;games&quot; are later revealed to be only a minor part of a much broader story.

Agent Graves is the leader of a group known as &quot;The Minutemen&quot;, a group of seven men (plus one &quot;Agent&quot;) who serve as the enforcers and police of a clandestine organization known as &quot;The Trust&quot;. The Trust was originally formed by the heads of 13 powerful European families who controlled much of the Old World&#x27;s combined wealth and industry. The Trust made an offer to the kings of Europe by which they would leave the continent and their considerable influence and holdings, in exchange for complete autonomy in the still unclaimed portion of the New World. When England ignored this proposition and colonized the Roanoke Island late in the 16th century, the Minutemen were formed. The original Minutemen, seven vicious killers, eradicated the colony and all of its inhabitants, leaving behind only the cryptic message &quot;Croatoa&quot; as a warning, reclaiming the land for the Trust. Since this time, the Minutemen&#x27;s charge has been to protect the 13 Houses of the Trust, serving as their force against outside threats and more frequently as police of the internal conflicts between the Trust families themselves. The groups&#x27; interactions are often facilitated by a person holding the title &quot;Warlord&quot; for the Trust, who serves as the Houses&#x27; liaison to the Minutemen.

Sometime in the late 20th century, the Minutemen were betrayed by the Trust and disbanded after Agent Graves refused to reenact &quot;The Greatest Crime in the History of Mankind&quot; (a re-expansion of the borders of the Trust). The Minutemen retaliated with the assassination of a hooded figure in Atlantic City, and they were then sent into hiding. Most of the Minutemen of that time were &quot;deactivated&quot; by Graves. These former Minutemen had their memories repressed for their own protection and were returned to &quot;normal&quot; lives. These events occurred prior (presumably some years) to the beginning of &quot;100 Bullets&quot;.

As the story plays out, many of those who are offered the chance for vengeance by Graves are revealed to have been people wronged by the Trust or its agents, and six are revealed to have been Minutemen at the time of the events of Atlantic City. With his planning, some luck, and the importance of his &quot;game&quot;, Agent Graves seeks to reactivate several of his Minutemen and recruit potential new members during the course of the series. With the occasional aid of the Trust&#x27;s current Warlord, the charismatic and secretive Mr. Shepherd, Graves sets into motion a complicated and deadly plot of revenge against the Trust, which divides into factions, with younger members plotting against the older ones.

The series culminates in the downfall of the Trust and its agents, eventually revealing that the attaché and its contents are a metaphor for the limitless power of the Trust.

==Characters==
==Story arcs==
===Collected editions===
There are thirteen trade paperbacks in publication for this series. The titles of the trade paperbacks all seem to be somehow related with their volume number (&quot;First Shot, Last Call&quot;; &quot;Split Second Chance&quot;; &quot;A Foregone Tomorrow&quot;; &quot;The Counterfifth Detective&quot;; &quot; Six Feet Under the Gun&quot;; &quot;Strychnine Lives&quot;; &quot;Decayed&quot; (a pun on &#x27;decade&#x27;; this is the tenth volume)), with four being indirect references (book 7 titled &quot;Samurai&quot;, for &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;; book 8 titled &quot;The Hard Way&quot;, a reference to a roll in craps; book 12 titled &quot;Dirty&quot;, as in &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;; book 13 titled &quot;Wilt&quot;, for basketball player Wilt Chamberlain, who wore the number 13 and was famous for scoring 100 points in a single game). Book 11 &quot;Once Upon a Crime&quot; is also a reference as &quot;once&quot; is Spanish for eleven. The exception to the rule is book 3, which was originally to be called &quot;The Charm&quot; — as in &quot;third time&#x27;s the charm&quot; — but was given the title of the collection&#x27;s largest plot arc, &quot;Hang Up on the Hang Low&quot;, when it won the Eisner Award. Another interpretation of this seemingly odd exception is that &#x27;Hang Up on the Hang Low&#x27; is a coded allusion to Masonic symbology, the upwards triangle placed over the downward triangle, where the number 3 is alluded to, among other things, by this code. As The Trust can also be seen to be a Masonic type allusion, one should also look for other Masonic symbols throughout the books. A series of &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; hardcover volumes collecting the series have also been published, and then released in paperback a few years later.

===100 Bullets Deluxe Edition===
===100 Bullets Omnibus===
The series has been collected in two Omnibus hardcover editions. Although the second volume was initially solicited to include the follow-up &quot;Brother Lono&quot; miniseries in addition to the main series, ultimately only the original hundred issues were collected (plus an early short story).

==Media adaptations==
Acclaim announced plans to release a video game based on &quot;100 Bullets&quot;, but following the collapse of Acclaim&#x27;s publishing house, the game was cancelled. It was intended that the player would be either Cole Burns or Snow Falls (a completely original character) and play in a third person view, with actor Keanu Reeves portraying Cole Burns. The plot was not publicly known, aside from a supposition that it followed the plot of the comic book.

D3 Publisher of America obtained the rights from Warner Bros. to publish a &quot;100 Bullets game&quot; in 2006. They intended to make a video game completely independent from Acclaim&#x27;s aborted vision, albeit still heavily reliant on input and plotting from Brian Azzarello and releasing it in Q3 2007, but was never released.

In 2011, screenwriter David S. Goyer was attached to executive produce and write a TV series based on the comics for Showtime. Two years later, Goyer said that the project got &quot;incredibly close&quot; at Showtime before being turned down due to a multitude of mass shootings across the United States. He called the sudden turn of events &quot;frustrating&quot;, further stating: &quot;At one point, I thought it was going to happen at Showtime. It got to the three-yard line&quot;.

In 2014, SciFiNow reported &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; release of information regarding upcoming Warner Brothers films based on DC Comics properties. The films that were revealed to be in development included the much anticipated &quot;Justice League&quot; film; &quot;Shazam!&quot;, &quot;Fables&quot;, and &quot;100 Bullets&quot; were among the other films listed. A film adaptation was announced in August 2015 to be produced by Tom Hardy with the option for him to star in the film, written by Chris Borrelli and distributed by New Line Cinema.

==Critical reception==
The series has attracted critical acclaim from within and beyond the American comics industry, as &quot;very violent, dark and clever&quot; and &quot;a series of compelling morality tales&quot;. In his introduction for the second volume collection, Howard Chaykin wrote: &quot;Thanks are overdue to both these guys for producing the most exciting comic book in years&quot;.

===Awards===
The series won the 2002 Harvey Awards for Best Writer, Best Artist and Best Continuing Series, and the 2003 Harvey Award for Best Artist, as well as the 2001 Eisner Award for Best Serialized Story, and the 2002 and 2004 Eisner Award for Best Continuing Series.

==Sequel==
The franchise&#x27;s creative team behind the original &quot;100 Bullets&quot; joined forces once again to work on a limited series sequel, &quot;Brother Lono&quot;, released in April 2014. It was an 8-issue limited series that detailed Lono&#x27;s rehabilitated life in Durango after the events of &quot;100 Bullets&quot; issue #100.

<doc id="811741" wikidata="Q3535133" url="?curid=811741" title="Healthcare in Canada">
<text>Healthcare in Canada is delivered through the provincial and territorial systems of publicly funded health care, informally called Medicare. It is guided by the provisions of the &quot;Canada Health Act&quot; of 1984, and is universal. The 2002 Royal Commission, known as the Romanow Report, revealed that Canadians consider universal access to publicly funded health services as a &quot;fundamental value that ensures national health care insurance for everyone wherever they live in the country&quot;.

Canadian Medicare provides coverage for approximately 70 percent of Canadians&#x27; healthcare needs, and the remaining 30 percent is paid for through the private sector. The 30 percent typically relates to services not covered or only partially covered by Medicare, such as prescription drugs, eye care, medical devices, gender care, psychotherapy, physical therapy and dentistry. About 65-75 percent of Canadians have some form of supplementary health insurance related to the aforementioned reasons; many receive it through their employers or use secondary social service programs related to extended coverage for families receiving social assistance or vulnerable demographics, such as seniors, minors, and those with disabilities.

According to the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI), by 2019, Canada&#x27;s aging population represents an increase in healthcare costs of approximately one percent a year, which is a modest increase. In a 2020 Statistics Canada Canadian Perspectives Survey Series (CPSS), 69 percent of Canadians self-reported that they had excellent or very good physical health—an improvement from 60 percent in 2018. In 2019, 80 percent of Canadian adults self-reported having at least one major risk factor for chronic disease: smoking, physical inactivity, unhealthy eating or excessive alcohol use. Canada has one of the highest rates of adult obesity among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries attributing to approximately 2.7 million cases of diabetes (types 1 and 2 combined). Four chronic diseases—cancer (a leading cause of death), cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases and diabetes account for 65 percent of deaths in Canada. There is approximately 8 million individuals aged 15 and older with one or more disabilities in Canada.

In 2021, the Canadian Institute for Health Information reported that healthcare spending reached $308billion, or 12.7 percent of Canada&#x27;s GDP for that year. In 2022 Canada&#x27;s per-capita spending on health expenditures ranked 12th among healthcare systems in the OECD. Canada has performed close to the average on the majority of OECD health indicators since the early 2000s, and ranks above average for access to care, but the number of doctors and hospital beds are considerably below the OECD average. The Commonwealth Funds 2021 report comparing the healthcare systems of the 11 most developed countries ranked Canada second-to-last. Identified weaknesses of Canada&#x27;s system were comparatively higher infant mortality rate, the prevalence of chronic conditions, long wait times, poor availability of after-hours care, and a lack of prescription drugs coverage. An increasing problem in Canada&#x27;s health system is a shortage of healthcare professionals and hospital capacity.

==Canadian healthcare policy==
The primary objective of the Canadian healthcare policy, as set out in the 1984 Canada Health Act (CHA), is to &quot;protect, promote and restore the physical and mental well-being of residents of Canada and to facilitate reasonable access to health services without financial or other barriers.&quot; The federal government ensures compliance with its requirements that all Canadians have &quot;reasonable access to medically necessary hospital, physician, and surgical-dental services that require a hospital&quot; by providing cash to provinces and territories through the Canada Health Transfer (CHT) based on their fulfilling certain &quot;criteria and conditions related to insured health services and extended health care services.&quot;

In his widely cited 1987 book, Malcolm G. Taylor traced the roots of Medicare and federal-provincial negotiations involving &quot;issues of jurisdiction, cost allocations, revenue transfers, and taxing authorities&quot; that resulted in the current system that provides healthcare to &quot;Canadians on the basis of need, irrespective of financial circumstances.&quot;

==Monitoring and measuring healthcare in Canada==
Health Canada, under the direction of the Health Minister, is the ministry responsible for overseeing Canada&#x27;s healthcare, including its public policies and implementations. This includes the maintenance and improvement of the health of the Canadian population, which is &quot;among the healthiest in the world as measured by longevity, lifestyle and effective use of the public health care system.&quot;

Health Canada, a federal department, publishes a series of surveys of the healthcare system in Canada. Although life-threatening cases are dealt with immediately, some services needed are non-urgent and patients are seen at the next-available appointment in their local chosen facility.

In 1996, in response to an interest in renewing its healthcare system, the federal government established the Canadian Health Services Research Foundation (CHRSF) in the 1996 federal budget to conduct research in collaboration with &quot;provincial governments, health institutions, and the private sector&quot; to identify the successes and failures in the health system.

The Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) is a not-for-profit, independent organization established by the provincial, territorial, and federal government to make healthcare information publicly available. The CIHI was established in 1994 to serve as a national &quot;coordinating council and an independent institute for health information&quot; in response to the 1991 report, &quot;Health Information for Canada&quot; produced by the National Task Force on Health Information. In 1994, the CIHI merged the Hospital Medical Records Institute (HMRI) and The Management Information Systems (MIS) Group.

Reports include topics such as the evaluating and suggested improvements for the efficiency of healthcare services. Regions that were similar in factors such as education levels and immigration numbers were found to have different efficiency levels in health care provision. The study concluded if increased efficiency of the current system was set as a goal, the death rate could be decreased by 18%-35%. The study notes that supporting physician leadership and facilitating engagement of the care providers could reap great gains in efficiency. Additionally, the study suggested facilitating the exchange of information and interaction between health providers and government figures as well as flexible funding would also contribute to the improvement and solve the problem of differences in regional care by allowing regions to determine the needs of their general populace and meet those needs more efficiently by allowing target-specific allocation of funds.

For 24 years, the CIHI has produced an annual detailed report updating &quot;National Health Expenditure Trends&quot; which includes data tables with the most recent report published in January 2021. Other CIHI research topics include hospital care, organ and joint replacements, health system performance, seniors and aging, health workforce, health inequality, quality and safety, mental health and addictions, pharmaceuticals, international comparisons, emergency care, patient experience, residential care, population health, community care, patient outcomes, access and wait times, children and youth, and First Nations, Inuit and Métis.

In 2003, at the First Ministers&#x27; Accord on Health Care Renewal, the Health Council of Canada (HCC)—an independent national agency—was established to monitor and report on Canada&#x27;s healthcare system. For over a decade, until 2014, the HCC produced 60 reports on access and wait times, health promotion, seniors healthcare, aboriginal healthcare, home and community care, pharmaceuticals management, and primary health care.

==Demographics==

By February 2024, the median age in Canada was 40.6 years in 2023 compared to 39.5 in 2006.

By July 2020, there were 6,835,866 individuals who were 65 years old and older and 11,517 centenarians. The same data reported that by July 2020, 16% of Canadians were 14-years-old or under, 66.5% were between the ages of 15 and 65, and 17.5% were 65 years and older.

Canada&#x27;s population is aging, like that of many other countries. By 2016, there were about six million seniors in Canada, which then had a population of approximately 34 million. This significantly influences Canada&#x27;s healthcare services; by 2019, Canada&#x27;s aging population represented a modest increase in healthcare costs of about 1% a year.

Since the 2010s, Statistics Canada health research on aging has focused on &quot;chronic diseases,&quot; &quot;social isolation&quot; and senior&#x27;s mental health needs, and &quot;transitions to institutional care&quot; including long-term care. The eight chronic conditions that are prevalent in one out of ten seniors include high blood pressure, arthritis, back problems, eye problems, heart disease, osteoporosis, diabetes and urinary incontinence, with many seniors having multiple chronic conditions. Those with chronic conditions are &quot;associated with higher use of home-care services and need for formal-care providers.&quot;

Ninety percent of Canadians agree that Canada should have a &quot;national seniors strategy to address needs along the full continuum of care.&quot;

==Current status==
The government guarantees the quality of care through federal standards. The government does not participate in day-to-day care or collect any information about an individual&#x27;s health, which remains confidential between a person and their physician. In each province, each doctor handles the insurance claim against the provincial insurer. There is no need for the person who accesses healthcare to be involved in billing and reclaim. Private health expenditure accounts for 30% of health care financing.

The &quot;Canada Health Act&quot; does not cover prescription drugs, home care, or long-term care or dental care. Provinces provide partial coverage for children, those living in poverty, and seniors. Programs vary by province. In Ontario, for example, most prescriptions for youths under the age of 24 are covered by the Ontario health insurance plan if no private insurance plan is available.

Competitive practices such as advertising are kept to a minimum, thus maximizing the percentage of revenues that go directly towards care. Costs are paid through funding from federal and provincial general tax revenues, which include income taxes, sales taxes, and corporate taxes. In British Columbia, taxation-based funding was (until January 1, 2020) supplemented by a fixed monthly premium that was waived or reduced for those on low incomes. In Ontario, there is an income tax identified as a health premium on taxable income above $20,000.

In addition to funding through the tax system, hospitals and medical research are funded in part by charitable contributions. For example, in 2018, Toronto&#x27;s Hospital for Sick Children embarked on campaign to raise $1.3 billion to equip a new hospital. Charities such as the Canadian Cancer Society provide assistance such as transportation for patients. There are no deductibles on basic health care and co-pays are extremely low or non-existent (supplemental insurance such as Fair Pharmacare may have deductibles, depending on income). In general, user fees are not permitted by the &quot;Canada Health Act&quot;, but physicians may charge a small fee to the patient for reasons such as missed appointments, doctor&#x27;s notes, and prescription refills done over the phone. Some physicians charge &quot;annual fees&quot; as part of a comprehensive package of services they offer their patients and their families. Legally, such charges must be completely optional and can only be for non-essential health options, however, some clinics have allegedly broken these rules, and provincial agencies have pursued injunctions and investigations.

===Benefits and features===
Health cards are issued by provincial health ministries to individuals who enroll for the program, though newcomers must wait up to three months after they arrive in the province, and everyone receives the same level of care once they receive one. Most essential basic care is covered, including maternity but excluding mental health and home care. Infertility costs are not covered in any province other than Quebec, though they are now partially covered in some other provinces. In some provinces, private supplemental plans are available for those who desire private rooms if they are hospitalized. Cosmetic surgery and some forms of elective surgery are not considered essential care and are generally not covered. For example, Canadian health insurance plans do not cover non-therapeutic circumcision. These can be paid out-of-pocket or through private insurers.

Basic health coverage is not affected by loss or change of jobs, cannot be denied due to unpaid premiums, and is not subject to lifetime limits or exclusions for pre-existing conditions. The &quot;Canada Health Act&quot; deems that essential physician and hospital care be covered by the publicly funded system, but each province has reasons to determine what is considered essential, and where, how and who should provide the services. There are some provinces that are moving towards private health care away from public health care. The result is that there is a wide variance in what is covered across the country by the public health system, particularly in more controversial or expensive areas, such as mental health, substance use treatment, in-vitro fertilization, gender-affirming surgery, or autism treatments.

Canada (with the exception of the province of Quebec) is one of the few countries with a universal healthcare system that does not include coverage of prescription medication (other such countries are Russia and some of the former USSR republics). Residents of Quebec who are covered by the province&#x27;s public prescription drug plan pay an annual premium of $0 to $660 when they file their Quebec income tax return.

Over the past two decades, at least some provinces have introduced some universal prescription drug insurance. Nova Scotia has Family Pharmacare, introduced in 2008 by Rodney MacDonald&#x27;s Progressive Conservative government. However, residents do not automatically receive it through their health care as they must register separately for it, and it covers a limited range of prescriptions. No premiums are charged. A deductible and out-of-pocket maximum for copayments are set as a percentage of taxable income of two years before.

Pharmaceutical medications are covered by public funds in some provinces for the elderly or indigent, through employment-based private insurance or paid for out-of-pocket. In Ontario, eligible medications are provided at no cost for covered individuals aged 24 and under. Most drug prices are negotiated with suppliers by each provincial government to control costs but more recently, the Council of the Federation announced an initiative for select provinces to work together to create a larger buying block for more leverage to control costs of pharmaceutical drugs. More than 60 percent of prescription medications are paid for privately in Canada. Family physicians (&quot;General Practitioners&quot;) are assigned to individuals using provincial waitlist registry systems. If a patient wishes to see a specialist or is counseled to see a specialist by their GP, a referral is made by a GP in the local community. Preventive care and early detection are considered critical.

==Coverage==
===Mental health===
The &quot;Canada Health Act&quot; covers the services of psychiatrists, medical doctors with additional training in psychiatry. In Canada, psychiatrists tend to focus on the treatment of mental illness with medication. However, the &quot;Canada Health Act&quot; excludes care provided in a &quot;hospital or institution primarily for the mentally disordered.&quot; Some institutional care is provided by provinces. The &quot;Canada Health Act&quot; does not cover treatment by a psychologist or psychotherapist unless the practitioner is also a medical doctor. Goods and Services Tax or Harmonized Sales Tax (depending on the province) applies to the services of psychotherapists. Some coverage for mental health care and substance abuse treatment may be available under other government programs. For example, in Alberta, the province provides funding for mental health care through Alberta Health Services. Most or all provinces and territories offer government-funded drug and alcohol addiction rehabilitation, although waiting lists may exist. The cost of treatment by a psychologist or psychotherapist in Canada has been cited as a contributing factor in the high suicide rate among first responders such as police officers, EMTs and paramedics. According to a CBC report, some police forces &quot;offer benefits plans that cover only a handful of sessions with community psychologists, forcing those seeking help to join lengthy waiting lists to seek free psychiatric assistance.&quot;

===Oral health===
Among the OECD countries, Canada ranks second to last in the public funding of oral healthcare. Those who need dental care are usually responsible for the finances and some may benefit from the coverage available through employment, under provincial plans, or private dental care plans. &quot;As opposed to its national system of public health insurance, dental care in Canada is almost wholly privately financed, with approximately 60% of dental care paid through employment-based insurance, and 35% through out-of-pocket expenditures. Of the approximately 5% of publicly financed care that remains, most has focused on socially marginalized groups (e.g., low-income children and adults), and is supported by different levels of government depending on the group insured.&quot; It is true that compared to primary care checkups, dental care checkups depend on the ability of people being able to pay those fees.

Studies in Quebec and Ontario provide data on the extent of dental health care. For example, studies in Quebec showed that there was a strong relation among dental services and the socioeconomic factors of income and education whereas in Ontario older adults heavily relied on dental insurance with visits to the dentist. &quot;According to the National Public Health Service in 1996/1997, it showed a whopping difference of people who were in different classes. About half of Canadians aged 15 or older (53%) reported having dental insurance. Coverage tended to be highest among middle-aged people. At older ages, the rate dropped, and only one-fifth of the 65-or-older age group (21%) was covered.&quot; Attributes that can contribute to these outcomes is household income, employment, as well as education. Those individuals who are in the middle class may be covered through the benefits of their employment whereas older individuals may not due to the fact of retirement.

Under the government healthcare system in Canada, routine dental care is not covered. There are a couple of provinces that offer child prevention programs such as Nova Scotia and Quebec. Other provinces make patients pay for medical dental procedures that are performed in the hospital. Some dental services that are possibly not covered by Medicare may include cavity fillings, routine dental check-ups, restorative dental care, and preventive care, dentures, dental implants, bridges, crowns, veneers, and in-lays, X-rays, and orthodontic procedures.

In 2022, however, the federal government announced the creation of a new Canada Dental Benefit which reimburses low- to middle-income parents up to $650 of dental fees per child. This was a transitional policy on the way to universal, public coverage of dental care. In 2023, the government established the Canadian Dental Care Plan, which began a staggered enrolment rollout in December 2023, to pay costs for covered dental services of eligible residents.

===Physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and massage therapy===
Coverage for services by physiotherapists, occupational therapists (also known as OTs) and Registered Massage Therapists (RMTs) varies by province. For example, in Ontario the provincial health plan, OHIP, does cover physiotherapy following hospital discharge and occupational therapy but does not cover massage therapy. To be eligible for coverage for physiotherapy in Ontario, insured individuals must have been discharged as an inpatient of a hospital after an overnight stay and require physiotherapy for the condition, illness or injury, or be age 19 or younger or age 65 or older.

===Other coverage limitations===
Coverage varies for care related to the feet. In Ontario, as of 2019, Medicare covers between $7–16 of each visit to a registered podiatrist up to $135 per patient per year, plus $30 for x-rays. Although the elderly, as well as diabetic patients, may have needs that greatly exceed that limit, such costs would have to be covered by patients or private supplemental insurance.

As of 2014, most, but not all provinces and territories provide some coverage for sex reassignment surgery (also known as gender confirming surgery) and other treatment for gender dysphoria. In Ontario, sex reassignment surgery requires prior approval before being covered.

However, access to care does not meet WPATH guidelines in provinces covering 84% of Canada&#x27;s population (excepting British Columbia, Prince Edward Island and Yukon Territory). Wait times are extensive for gender care in Canada, and can be as long as eight years. 

There are wide discrepancies in coverage for various assistive devices such as wheelchairs and respiratory equipment in Canada. Ontario, which has one of the most generous programs, pays 75% of the cost for listed equipment and supplies for persons with a disability requiring such equipment or supplies for six months or longer. The program does not have age or income restrictions. As with other health coverage, veterans and others covered by federal programs are not eligible under the provincial program. Only certain types of equipment and supplies are covered, and within categories only approved models of equipment from approved vendors are covered, and vendors may not charge more than specified prices established by the government.

====Nursing homes and home care====
Home care is an &quot;extended&quot; service, and is therefore not an insured service under the Canada Health Act. Home care is not considered to be a medically necessary service, like hospital and physician services, and provincial and territorial governments are under no obligation to provide home care services. In their 2009 report on home care in Canada, the Canadian Healthcare Association (CHA ) said that there was an increase in chronic disease rates as Canada&#x27;s population aged. Home care is generally considered to be a lower cost alternative at a time when governments are concerned about the cost of healthcare and is generally the preferred option for seniors.

One in four caregivers provide care related to aging. A 2016 study published in the &quot;Journal of Canadian Studies&quot; said that with an increasing elder population, in Canada, the supply of home care aids (HCA)s was not meeting the demand required to provide adequate nursing home care and home care in an increasingly complex care system. Home care aids face intense job precarity, inadequate staffing levels as well as increasingly complex needs including different types of routinized, assembly-lines types of work, and cost-cutting on equipment and supplies. They also work in situations where there are more occupational hazards, which can include aggressive pets, environmental tobacco smoke, oxygen equipment, unsafe neighborhoods, and pests. As the role of home care aids evolves, so does the need for more training and instruction. Nurses and HCAs are expected to think critically and execute real-time, and make evidence-based care decisions.

==Indigenous peoples==

The largest group the federal government is directly responsible for is First Nations. Native peoples are a federal responsibility and the federal government guarantees complete coverage of their health needs. For the last twenty years and despite health care being a guaranteed right for First Nations due to the many treaties the government of Canada signed for access to First Nations lands and resources, the amount of coverage provided by the Federal government&#x27;s Non-Insured Health Benefits program has diminished drastically for optometry, dentistry, and medicines. Status First Nations individuals qualify for a set number of visits to the optometrist and dentist, with a limited amount of coverage for glasses, eye exams, fillings, root canals, etc. For the most part, First Nations people use normal hospitals and the federal government then fully compensates the provincial government for the expense. The federal government also covers any user fees the province charges. The federal government maintains a network of clinics and health centers on First Nations reserves. At the provincial level, there are also several much smaller health programs alongside Medicare. The largest of these is the health care costs paid by the workers&#x27; compensation system. Regardless of federal efforts, healthcare for First Nations has generally not been considered effective. Despite being a provincial responsibility, the large health costs have long been partially funded by the federal government.

==Healthcare spending==
While the Canadian healthcare system has been called a single payer system, Canada &quot;does not have a single health care system&quot; according to a 2018 Library of Parliament report. The provinces and territories provide &quot;publicly funded health care&quot; through provincial and territorial public health insurance systems. The total health expenditure in Canada includes expenditures for those health services not covered by either federal funds or these public insurance systems, that are paid by private insurance or by individuals out-of-pocket.

In 2017, the Canadian Institute for Health Information reported that healthcare spending is expected to reach $242 billion, or 11.5% of Canada&#x27;s gross domestic product for that year.

The provinces and territories health spending accounted for approximately &quot;64.2% of total health expenditure&quot; in 2018.  Public sources of revenue for the public healthcare system include provincial financing which represented 64.2% of the total in 2018. This includes funds transferred from the federal government to the provinces in the form of the CHT. Direct funding from the federal government, as well as funds from municipal governments and social security funds represented 4.8% in 2018.

According to the CIHI 2019 report, since 1997, the 70–30 split between public and private sector healthcare spending has remained relatively consistent with approximately 70% of Canada&#x27;s total health expenditures from the public sector and 30% from the private sector. Public-sector funding, which has represented approximately 70% of total health expenditure since 1997, &quot;includes payments by governments at the federal, provincial/territorial and municipal levels and by workers&#x27; compensation boards and other social security schemes&quot;.

==Private sector funding==
Private sector funding is regulated under the &quot;Canada Health Act&quot;, (CHA) which sets the conditions with which provincial/territorial health insurance plans must comply if they wish to receive their full transfer payments from the federal government. The CHA does not allow charges to insured persons for insured services (defined as medically necessary care provided in hospitals or by physicians). Most provinces have responded through various prohibitions on such payments.

Private-sector health care dollars, which has represented about 30% of total health expenditure, &quot;consists primarily of health expenditures by households and private insurance firms&quot;. In 2018, private sector funding for health care, accounted for 31% of the total health expenditures. &quot;includes primarily private insurance and household expenditures.&quot;

The top categories of private sector expenditures account for 66% of this spending, and include pharmaceuticals, and professional services such as dental and vision care services. Only 10% of these services are paid for by the public sector. In 2017, 41% of private sector expenses were paid by private insurance companies. The amount of out-of-pocket spending represented 49% of private sector spending.

A 2006 in-depth CBC report, the Canadian system is for the most part publicly funded, yet most of the services are provided by private enterprises. In 2006, most doctors do not receive an annual salary, but receive a fee per visit or service. According to Dr. Albert Schumacher, former president of the Canadian Medical Association, an &quot;estimated 75% of Canadian health care services are delivered privately but funded publicly.&quot; 
Private clinics are permitted and are regulated by the provinces and territories. Private clinics can charge above the agreed-upon fee schedule if they are providing non-insured services, treating non-insured persons, or based in Quebec, due to a court decision. This may include those eligible under automobile insurance or worker&#x27;s compensation, in addition to those who are not Canadian residents, or providing non-insured services. This provision has been controversial among those seeking a greater role for private funding.

It&#x27;s been suggested that the apparent success of the private telehealth provider Maple, with its hundreds of thousands of paying users, indicates the existence of a rapidly growing private healthcare tier. Maple has come under criticism for affordability, as appointments with a general practitioner on Maple can cost over $200 per visit.

===Private health insurance===
In Canada private health insurances is mainly provided through employers.

By 2016, &quot;health care dollars from private insurance were $788 per capita&quot; in 2016, which represents an annual growth rate of 6.4% from 1988 to 2016.

According to a 2004 OECD report, 75% of Canadians had some form of supplementary private health insurance.

In many provinces, purchasing duplicate health insurance for care already covered by the government&#x27;s health insurance plan is prohibited.

===Out-of-pocket expenses===
From 1988 to 2016, the amount of out‑of‑pocket expenses paid by individuals had grown by about 4.6% annually. By 2016, it amounted to $972 per capita.

===Major healthcare expenses===
The highest health expenditures were hospitals—$51B in 2009 up from $45.4B, representing 28.2% in 2007, followed by pharmaceuticals—$30B in 2009 up from $26.5B, representing 16.5% in 2007, and physician services—$26B in 2009, up from $21.5B or 13.4% in 2007.

The proportion spent on hospitals and physicians has declined between 1975 and 2009 while the amount spent on pharmaceuticals has increased. Of the three biggest health care expenses, the amount spent on pharmaceuticals has increased the most. In 1997, the total price of drugs surpassed that of doctors. In 1975, the three biggest health costs were hospitals ($5.5B/44.7%), physicians ($1.8B/15.1%), and medications ($1.1B/8.8%).

By 2018, drugs (both prescription and non-prescription) had become the second largest expenditure representing 15.3% of the total, hospitals at 26.6% represented the largest sector by expenses, and physician services represented 15.1% of the total.

====Hospitals====
Hospitals have consistently been the top healthcare expenditure representing 26.6% of total healthcare expenditures in Canada in 2018.

Hospital capacity in Canada peaked in 1970. Since then, per-capita hospital bed capacity has been reduced by 63%.

Hospital care is delivered by publicly funded hospitals in Canada. Most of the public hospitals, each of which are independent institutions incorporated under provincial Corporations Acts, are required by law to operate within their budget. Amalgamation of hospitals in the 1990s has reduced competition between hospitals.

An OECD study in 2010 noted that there were variations in care across the different provinces in Canada. The study found that there was a difference in hospital admission rates depending on the number of people and what province they lived in. Typically, provinces with low population counts had higher hospital admission rates due to there being a lack of doctors and hospitals in the region.

====Pharmaceuticals====
By 2018, drugs—both prescription and non-prescription—were the second largest healthcare expenditure in Canada at 15.3% of the total.

According to the December 2020 CIHI report, in 2019 public drug programs expenditures were $15 billion, representing a one-year increase of 3%. The drug that contributed to about 26% of the increase in spending were drugs for diabetes. In 2018, hepatitis C drugs were the 2nd highest contributor to increase in pharmaceutical spending. In 2019, this decreased by 18% as fewer people took these drugs. In 2019, spending on biologics increased from 9% to 17% of public spending for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn&#x27;s disease and similar conditions.

By 1997, the total cost of pharmaceuticals surpassed the total cost of physician services and has remained in second place, after hospitals in terms of total annual health expenditures. The proportion spent on hospitals and physicians has declined between 1975 and 2009 while the amount spent on pharmaceuticals has increased. Of the three biggest health care expenses, the amount spent on pharmaceuticals has increased the most. In 1997, the total price of drugs surpassed that of doctors. In 1975, the three biggest health costs were hospitals ($5.5B/44.7%), physicians ($1.8B/15.1%), and medications ($1.1B/8.8%).

According to the April 2018 report entitled &quot;Pharmacare Now: Prescription Medicine Coverage for All Canadians&quot; issued by the House of Commons Standing Committee on Health &quot;spending on medicines dispensed outside hospitals accounted for 85% of total drug expenditures in 2017.&quot;

The CHA requires that public provincial and territorial health insurance policies must cover all &quot;medicines used within the hospital setting...out‑of‑hospital drug expenditures are paid for by private insurance and individuals, as well as by provincial health insurance for certain population groups&quot;. Public provincial and territorial health insurance covers &quot;43% of out‑of‑hospital medicine&quot;; private insurance covers 35%; and the remainder, which represents 22% is paid by individuals out-of-pocket.

Pharmaceutical costs are set at a global median by the government price controls.

====Physician services====
The third largest healthcare expenditure in Canada are physician services which represented 15.1% of the total in 2018. From 1997 through 2009, the proportion of total annual health expenditures spent on physicians declined.

In 2007, physician services cost $21.5B representing 13.4% of total health expenditures. By 2009, that had increased to $26B.

=====Number of physicians=====
Canada, like its North American neighbor the United States, has a ratio of practising physicians to a population that is below the OECD average but a level of practising nurses that is higher than the OECD average, though below the US average in 2016.

A record number of doctors was reported in 2012 with 75,142 physicians, though this includes doctors who have partially or completely opted out of the public health system, which has occurred at record numbers in Quebec. The gross average salary was $328,000. Out of the gross amount, doctors pay for taxes, rent, staff salaries and equipment. Recent reports indicate that Canada has an imbalanced supply of specialists to general physicians, and a severe shortage of family doctors, with 10 million Canadians projected to lack access to primary care, compounded by new graduates opting against selecting family medicine, and communities in rural, remote and northern regions, experience particularly acute shortages. Limitations on which and how many physicians can complete Canada&#x27;s required two year medical residency may prevent trained doctors from acquiring a license to practice medicine, leading to an effective shortage. Burnout and mental health reasons may also play a role, as in 2021, 48% of physicians polled by the Canadian Medical Association screened positive for depression.

=====Physician payment=====
Basic services are provided by private doctors (since 2002 they have been allowed to incorporate), with the entire fee paid for by the government at the same rate. 
Most family doctors receive a fee per visit. These rates are negotiated between the provincial governments and the province&#x27;s medical associations, usually on an annual basis. The fee for service model has been criticized for deterring physicians from becoming family doctors in British Columbia.

CTV news reported that, in 2006, family physicians in Canada made an average of $202,000 a year.

In 2018, to draw attention to the low pay of nurses and the declining level of service provided to patients, more than 700 physicians, residents and medical students in Quebec signed an online petition asking for their pay raises to be canceled.

=====Professional organizations=====
Each province regulates its medical profession through a self-governing College of Physicians and Surgeons, which is responsible for licensing physicians, setting practice standards, and investigating and disciplining its members.

The national doctors association is called the Canadian Medical Association (CMA); it describes its mission as &quot;To serve and unite the physicians of Canada and be the national advocate, in partnership with the people of Canada, for the highest standards of health and health care.&quot;

Since the passage of the 1984 &quot;Canada Health Act&quot;, the CMA itself has been a strong advocate of maintaining a strong publicly funded system, including lobbying the federal government to increase funding, and being a founding member of (and active participant in) the Health Action Lobby (HEAL).

In December 2008, the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada reported a critical shortage of obstetricians and gynecologists. The report stated that 1,370 obstetricians were practising in Canada and that number is expected to fall by at least one-third within five years. The society is asking the government to increase the number of medical school spots for obstetrics and gynecologists by 30 percent a year for three years and also recommended rotating placements of doctors into smaller communities to encourage them to take up residence there.

Some provincial medical associations have argued for permitting a larger private role. To some extent, this has been a reaction to strong cost control; CIHI estimates that 99% of physician expenditures in Canada come from public sector sources, and physicians—particularly those providing elective procedures who have been squeezed for operating room time—have accordingly looked for alternative revenue sources. The CMA presidency rotates among the provinces, with the provincial association electing a candidate who is customarily ratified by the CMA general meeting. Day&#x27;s selection was sufficiently controversial that he was challenged—albeit unsuccessfully—by another physician.

=====Provincial associations=====
Because healthcare is deemed to be under provincial/territorial jurisdiction, negotiations on behalf of physicians are conducted by provincial associations such as the Ontario Medical Association. The views of Canadian doctors have been mixed, particularly in their support for allowing parallel private financing. The history of Canadian physicians in the development of Medicare has been described by C. David Naylor.

In 1991, the Ontario Medical Association agreed to become a province-wide closed shop, making the OMA union a monopoly. Critics argue that this measure has restricted the supply of doctors to guarantee its members&#x27; incomes. In 2008, the Ontario Medical Association and the Ontario government agreed to a four-year contract with a 12.25% doctors&#x27; pay raise, which was expected to cost Ontarians an extra $1 billion. Ontario&#x27;s then-premier Dalton McGuinty said, &quot;One of the things that we&#x27;ve got to do, of course, is ensure that we&#x27;re competitive ... to attract and keep doctors here in Ontario ...&quot;

===Healthcare spending and an aging population===
By 2019, Canada&#x27;s aging population represented a modest increase in healthcare costs of about 1% a year. It is also the greatest at the extremes of age at a cost of $17,469 per capita in those older than 80 and $8,239 for those less than 1 year old in comparison to $3,809 for those between 1 and 64 years old in 2007.

===Comparing healthcare spending over time===

Healthcare spending in Canada (in 1997 dollars) has increased each year between 1975 and 2009, from $39.7 billion to $137.3 billion, or per capita spending from $1,715 to $4089. In 2013 the total reached $211 billion, averaging $5,988 per person. Figures in National Health Expenditure Trends, 1975 to 2012, show that the pace of growth is slowing. Modest economic growth and budgetary deficits are having a moderating effect. For the third straight year, growth in healthcare spending will be less than that in the overall economy. The proportion of Canada&#x27;s gross domestic product will reach 11.6% in 2012 down from 11.7% in 2011 and the all-time high of 11.9% in 2010. Total spending in 2007 was equivalent to 10.1% of the gross domestic product which was slightly above the average for OECD countries, and below the 16.0% of GDP spent in the United States.

Since 1999, 70% of Canada&#x27;s total health expenditures is from the public sector and 30% from the private sector. This was slightly below the OECD average of public health spending in 2009. Public sector funding included most hospital and physician costs with the other 30% primarily paid by individuals through their private or workplace insurance or out-of-pocket. Half of private health expenditure comes from private insurance and the remaining half is supplied by out-of-pocket payments.

There is considerable variation across the provinces/territories as to the extent to which such costs as out of hospital prescription medications, assistive devices, physical therapy, long-term care, dental care and ambulance services are covered.


According to a 2001 article in &quot;Annals of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada&quot;, applying a pharmacoeconomic perspective to analyze cost reduction, it has been shown that savings made by individual hospitals result in actual cost increases to the provinces.

===Healthcare spending by province===
The planning and funding of most publicly insured health services are the responsibility of provinces and territories. There is a regional variation in health system characteristics.

Healthcare costs per capita vary across Canada with Quebec ($4,891) and British Columbia ($5,254) at the lowest level and Alberta ($6,072) and Newfoundland ($5,970) at the highest.

Total health spending per resident varies from $7,378 in Newfoundland and Labrador to $6,321 in British Columbia. Public drug spending increased by 4.5% in 2016, driven largely by prescriptions for tumor necrosis factor alpha and hepatitis C drugs.

According to a 2003 article by Lightman, &quot;In-kind delivery in Canada is superior to the American market approach in its efficiency of delivery.&quot; In the US, 13.6 percent of GNP is used in medical care. By contrast, in Canada, only 9.5 percent of GNP is used on the Medicare system, &quot;in part because there is no profit incentive for private insurers.&quot; Lightman also notes that the in-kind delivery system eliminates much of the advertising that is prominent in the US and the low overall administrative costs in the in-kind delivery system. Since there are no means tests and no bad-debt problems for doctors under the Canadian in-kind system, doctors billing and collection costs are reduced to almost zero.

==Public opinion==
According to a 2020 survey, 75% of Canadians &quot;were proud of their health-care system.&quot;

An August 31, 2020 PBS article comparing the American healthcare system to Canada&#x27;s, cited the director of the University of Ottawa&#x27;s Centre for Health Law, Policy and Ethics, Colleen Flood, who said that there was &quot;no perfect health care system&quot;, and the &quot;Canadian system is not without flaws.&quot; However, Canadians &quot;feel grateful for what they have.&quot; At times, the complacency has resulted in Canadians not demanding for &quot;better outcomes for lower costs&quot;. She said that, Canadians are &quot;always relieved that at least [our healthcare system] is not the American system.&quot;

A 2009 Nanos Research poll found that 86.2% of Canadians &quot;supported or strongly supported&quot; &quot;public solutions&quot; to make Canadian &quot;public health care stronger.&quot; According to the survey report, commissioned by the Canadian Healthcare Coalition, there was &quot;compelling evidence&quot; that Canadians &quot;across all demographics&quot; prefer a &quot;public over a for-profit health-care system.&quot; A Strategic Counsel survey found 91% of Canadians prefer their healthcare system instead of a U.S. style system.

A 2009 Harris-Decima poll found 82% of Canadians preferred their healthcare system to the one in the United States.

A 2003 Gallup poll found 57% of Canadians compared to 50% in the UK, and 25% of Americans, were either &quot;very&quot; or &quot;somewhat&quot; satisfied with &quot;the availability of affordable healthcare in the nation&quot;. Only 17% of Canadians were &quot;very dissatisfied&quot; compared to 44% of Americans. In 2003, 48% of Americans, 52% of Canadians, and 42% of Britons say they were satisfied.

A 2016 Canadian Institute for Health Information survey found that Canadians wait longer to access health care services than citizens in 11 other countries including France, Germany, the United States and Australia.

In a 2021 Ipsos poll, 71% of Canadians agreed that their health care system is too bureaucratic to respond to the needs of the population.

The 2024 OurCare Initiative Survey found that, in some provinces, 30% of Canadians lacked access to primary care, 63% lacked access to after-hours or weekend care, and that 65% believed they couldn&#x27;t get a same or next-day appointment when they urgently needed care.

==A timeline of significant events in Canadian healthcare==
The &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; (formerly called the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot;) did not give either the federal or provincial governments responsibility for healthcare, as it was then a minor concern. However, the Act did give the provinces responsibility for regulating hospitals, and the provinces claimed that their general responsibility for local and private matters encompassed healthcare. The federal government felt that the health of the population fell under the &quot;Peace, order, and good government&quot; part of its responsibilities.

The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council ruled that the federal government had the responsibility of protecting the health and well-being of the population, and that the provinces had the responsibility of administering and delivering healthcare.

Before 1966, Veterans Affairs Canada had a large healthcare network, but this was merged into the general system with the creation of Medicare.

In 1975, Health Canada, which was then known as National Health and Welfare, established the National Health Research and Development Program.

In 1977, cost-sharing agreement between the federal and provincial governments, through the &quot;Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act&quot; and extended by the &quot;Medical Care Act&quot; was discontinued. It was replaced by Established Programs Financing. This gave a bloc transfer to the provinces, giving them more flexibility but also reducing the federal influence on the health system. Almost all government health spending goes through Medicare, but there are several smaller programs.

Provinces developed their own programs, for example, OHIP in Ontario, that are required to meet the general guidelines laid out in the federal &quot;Canada Health Act&quot;. The federal government directly administers health to groups such as the military, and inmates of federal prisons. They also provide some care to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and veterans, but these groups mostly use the public system.

In 1996, when faced with a large budget shortfall, the Liberal federal government merged the health transfers with the transfers for other social programs into the Canada Health and Social Transfer, and overall funding levels were cut. This placed considerable pressure on the provinces and combined with population aging and the generally high rate of inflation in health costs, has caused problems with the system.

The 2002 Royal Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada, also known as the Romanow Report, was published.

The Canadian Health Coalition formed in 2002.

In 2004, the First Ministers came to an agreement with the federal government on a ten-year plan to improve Canada&#x27;s healthcare. Areas of focus included wait times, home care, primary care reform, national pharmaceuticals strategy, prevention, promotion and public health, aboriginal health, and the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch (FNIHB) at Health Canada.

In 2006, Stephen Harper won the federal election on a &quot;platform that pushed for a mix of public and private health care, provided that health care stays publicly funded and universally accessible&quot;.

==Healthcare debates in Canada==
Canada has robust debates between those who support the one-tier public healthcare, such as the Canadian Health Coalition, a group that formed following the publication of the Romanov Report in 2002, and a number of pro-privatization organizations, such as the conservative Fraser Institute, that call for a two-tiered healthcare system. American organizations that support privatization of health services, such as the Cato Institute and the Americans for Prosperity have focused criticism of the Canadian healthcare system on wait times.

Wendell Potter, who had worked for multinational American health insurance company Cigna from 1993 until 2008, told PBS that the American health industry felt threatened by Canada&#x27;s healthcare system as it &quot;exposed shortcomings in the private U.S. health system and potentially threatened their profits.&quot; He said that corporate PR used the tactic of repeating misinformation about the publicly funded Canadian system by focusing on wait times for elective surgeries.

As healthcare debate in the United States reached the top of the U.S. domestic policy agenda during the U.S. 2008 presidential race with a combination of &quot;soaring costs&quot; in the healthcare system and an increasing number of Americans without health insurance because of job loss during the recession, the long wait lists of Canada&#x27;s so-called &quot;socialized&quot; healthcare system became a key Republican argument against Obama&#x27;s health reforms. The Huffington Post described it as the &quot;American politics of Canadian healthcare.&quot; A 2009 &quot;Huffington Post&quot; article described how American insurance companies were concerned that they would not be as profitable if his healthcare reforms were implemented.

Starting in July 2009, Canadian Shona Holmes of Waterdown, Ontario became the poster child of the Americans for Prosperity support for Republican presidential candidates against then-candidate and President Barack Obama&#x27;s who ran on health reform and the Affordable Care Act. In 2005, Holmes had paid $100,000 out-of-pocket for immediate treatment for a condition called Rathke&#x27;s cleft cyst at the U.S. Mayo Clinic, one of the best hospitals in the world, the Singapore General Hospital, and the Charité hospital in Berlin instead of waiting for an appointment with specialists in her home province of Ontario. In 2007, she filed a lawsuit against the Ontario government when OHIP refused to re-imburse her $100,000. The media attention from the Americans for Prosperity advertisements resulted in further scrutiny of Holmes&#x27; story. A 2009 CBC report consulted medical experts who found discrepancies in her story, including that Rathke&#x27;s cleft cyst was neither cancerous or life-threatening. The mortality rate for patients with a Rathke&#x27;s cleft cyst is zero percent.

Since 1990, the Fraser Institute has focused on investigating the Canadian healthcare system&#x27;s historic and problematic wait times by publishing an annual report based on a nationwide survey of physicians and health care practitioners, entitled &quot;Waiting Your Turn: Wait Times for Health Care in Canada&quot;. The 2021 edition of the report found that the average waiting time between referral from a general practitioner and delivery of elective treatment by a specialist rose from 9.3 weeks in 1993 to 25.6 weeks in 2021. Waiting times ranged from a low of 18.5 weeks in Ontario to 53.2 weeks in Nova Scotia.

A 2015 Fraser Institute article focused on Canadians who sought healthcare in other countries and reported that the percentage of Canadian patients who travelled abroad to receive non-emergency medical care was 1.1% in 2014, and 0.9% in 2013, with British Columbia being the province with the highest proportion of its citizens making such trips. A 2017 Fraser Institute cost-effectiveness analysis promoted a two-tiered system with more privatization, arguing that &quot;although Canada ranks among the most expensive universal-access health-care systems in the OECD, its performance for availability and access to resources is generally below that of the average OECD country, while its performance for use of resources and quality and clinical performance is mixed.&quot;

==Flaws in Canada&#x27;s healthcare system==
Identified weaknesses of Canada&#x27;s system were comparatively higher infant mortality rate, the prevalence of chronic conditions, long wait times, poor availability of after-hours care, and a lack of prescription drugs coverage. Limited dental coverage was added in 2023 An increasing problem in Canada&#x27;s health system is a shortage of healthcare professionals and hospital capacity.

Prescription medications have been consistently expensive in Canada, which has the third-highest drug costs of any OECD nation, and a 2018 study found that almost 1 million Canadians gave up food or heat to afford prescription medications. In 2021, over one in five (21%) adults in Canada reported not having any prescription insurance to cover medication costs.

There is enormous waste in Canada&#x27;s healthcare system related to medical records. Although the Canadian federal government has invested more than $2.1 billion developing health information technology (HIT), all 10 provinces still have their own separate incompatible HIT systems. A recent study showed that a shift to shared open source medical software could save Canada&#x27;s healthcare system millions of dollars. 

=== Hospital and urgent care access ===
Canada&#x27;s hospital beds per capita have decreased 63% since 1976, to 44% fewer beds than the OECD average. Overcrowding, or &quot;hallway medicine,&quot; is common in hospitals, and hospital patients are instructed to sleep on concrete floors, in storage rooms, as hospitals often operate at over 100% capacity, and in some regions as high as 200% capacity. In 2023, more than 1.3 million Canadians &quot;gave up&quot; waiting for emergency care, and left without being seen. The crisis is projected to continue to build, as Canada&#x27;s hospitals are unable to operate safely at 90% or greater ongoing capacity.

In addition, ambulance access in Canada is also inconsistent and decreasing, with &quot;Code/Level Zeros&quot;, where one or no ambulances are available for emergency calls, doubling and triple year-over-year in major cities such as Calgary, Ottawa, Windsor, and Hamilton. As an example, cumulatively, Ottawa spent seven weeks lacking ambulance response abilities, with individual periods lasting as long as 15 hours, and a six-hour ambulance response time in one case. Ambulance unload delays, due to hospitals lacking capacity and cutting their hours, have been linked to deaths, but the full impact is unknown as provincial authorities, have not responded to requests to release ambulance offload data to the public.

Plans to address ambulance access that included using taxis instead of ambulances to transport patients have drawn support from local leaders, but rejection from local residents and Ontario&#x27;s provincial authorities.


Temporary hospital and emergency room closures are common in Canada, with over 1,100 in Ontario alone in 2023, and in 2022, the president of the Canadian Medical Association described Canada&#x27;s healthcare system with the following quote;

Canada&#x27;s healthcare system ranks poorly among peer nations on medical technology access indicators, ranking second-to-last in the G20 for MRI units and radiotherapy equipment, fifth-to-last for CT scanners, and has 33% fewer mammography machines than the G20 average.

===Wait times===
In a May 28, 2020, report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) that examined wait times in member nations—all of which are democratic countries with high-income economies with a very high Human Development Index (HDI), found that long waiting times for health services was an important policy issue in most OECD countries. In 2017, Canada ranked above the average on OECD indicators for wait-times and access to care, with average scores for quality of care and use of resources.

In the 1980s and the 1990s, wait times for certain surgeries, such as knee and hip replacements, had increased. The year before the 2002 Romanow Royal Commission report was released, in 2001, the Ontario Health Coalition (OHC) called for increased provincial and federal funding for Medicare and an end to provincial funding cuts as solutions to unacceptable wait times.

In December 2002, the Romanow Report recommended that &quot;provincial and territorial governments should take immediate action to manage wait lists more effectively by implementing centralized approaches, setting standardized criteria, and providing clear information to patients on how long they can expect to wait.&quot; In response to the report, in September 2004, the federal government came to an agreement with the provinces and territories add an additional C$41 billion over a ten-year period, to the Canada Health Transfer (CHT) to improve wait times for access to essential services, a challenge that most other OECD countries shared at that time. By 2006, the federal government had invested C$5.5 billion to decrease wait times.

In April 2007, Prime Minister Stephen Harper promised that all ten provinces and three territories would establish wait-time guarantees by 2010. 

In 2015, &quot;Choosing Wisely Canada&quot; promoted evidence-based medicine in 2015. Organizations like this focus on facilitating doctor-patient communication to decrease unnecessary care in Canada and to decrease wait times.

In 2014, wait times for knee replacements were much longer in Nova Scotia, compared to Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland.

A 2016 study by the Commonwealth Fund, based in the US, found that Canada&#x27;s wait time for all categories of services ranked either at the bottom or second to the bottom of the 11 surveyed countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States). Canada&#x27;s wait time on emergency services was the longest of the 11 nations, with 29% of Canadians reporting that they waited for more than four hours the last time they went to an emergency department. Canada also had the longest wait time for specialist appointments, with 56% of all Canadians waiting for more than four weeks. Canada ranked last in all other wait time categories, including same- or next-day appointments, same-day answers from doctors, and elective surgeries, except for access to after-hour care, where Sweden ranks lower. The 2016 study also noted that despite government investment, Canada&#x27;s wait-time improvements were negligible when compared to the 2010 survey.

The 2021 &quot;Waiting Your Turn: Wait Times for Health Care in Canada&quot; report by the Fraser Institute found that the average waiting time between referral from a general practitioner and delivery of elective treatment by a specialist rose from 9.3 weeks in 1993 to 25.6 weeks in 2021. Waiting times ranged from a low of 18.5 weeks in Ontario to 53.2 weeks in Nova Scotia.

===Gender gaps in healthcare===

Gender gaps in healthcare are significantly influenced by socioeconomic status, geographical location, and ethnicity. It has been hypothesized that women experience a higher rate of health-related issues because of their reduced access to the material and social conditions of life that foster good health, as well as a heightened level of stress associated with their gender and marital roles. Moreover, research has shown that women with low income and who work full-time outside of the house have poorer health status in comparison to their male counterparts. The added responsibilities women hold as primary caregivers in households not only creates additional stress, but also indirectly increases the difficulty of the scheduling and meeting of medical appointments; these implications explain women&#x27;s poorer self-rated health status in comparison to men, as well as their report of their unmet healthcare needs.

Women&#x27;s additional healthcare requirements, such as pregnancy, further exacerbate the gender gap. Despite comprising approximately half of Canada&#x27;s population, women receive the majority of Canadian healthcare.

Men and women also experience different wait times for diagnostic tests; longer wait times have been associated with a higher risk of health complications. One Canadian study reports, &quot;mean wait times are significantly lower for men than for women pertaining to overall diagnostic tests: for MRI, 70.3 days for women compared to 29.1 days for men.&quot;

==== Effects of healthcare privatization ====
Disparities between men and women&#x27;s access to healthcare in Canada have led to criticism, especially regarding healthcare privatization. While most healthcare expenses remain covered by Medicare, certain medical services previously paid for publicly have been shifted to individuals and employer-based supplemental insurance. While this shift has affected both genders, women have been more affected. Compared to men, women are generally less financially stable, and individual payments are a greater burden. Furthermore, many women work part-time or in fields that do not offer supplemental insurance, such as homemaking. As such, women are less likely to have private insurance to cover the costs of drugs and healthcare services.

The shift from public to private financing has also meant additional labor for women due to families relying on them as caregivers. Less public financing has shifted care to women, leaving &quot;them with more support to provide at home.&quot;

Women&#x27;s additional healthcare requirements, such as pregnancy, further exacerbate the gender gap. Despite comprising approximately half of Canada&#x27;s population, women receive the majority of Canadian healthcare.

=== Socioeconomic gap in healthcare ===
It has been previously documented that one&#x27;s socioeconomic status significantly impacts their health. Another recent study re-assessed this relationship and found similar results that demonstrated that people with higher levels of education or income experience longer life expectancies and health-adjusted life expectancies. The study discovered a distinct stepwise gradient in Canada, with life expectancy and health-adjusted life expectancy incrementally increasing as social position improves. They also found that this socioeconomic gap in healthcare had gotten wider in the previous 15 years.

The reasoning behind the socioeconomic gap is complex and multifaceted. Certain relationships between socioeconomic status and health outcomes can be relatively easily explained through direct exposures. For example, lead or pollutant exposure tends to be more common in rural neighbourhoods, which can result in lower cognitive functions, stunted growth and exacerbated asthma. Higher income levels allow for the purchase of higher-quality resources, including food products, produce and shelter, as well as faster access to services. Higher education is often thought to lead to greater health literacy, resulting in the adoption of healthier lifestyles.

Longer, more complex pathways can also be used to explain potential relationships between socioeconomic status and health outcomes. Duration of poverty has been related to increased chronic stress levels. Recent studies have described how these stress levels can result in the biological &quot;wear-and-tear&quot; for these individuals constantly exposed to social and environmental stressors. Increased stress and lower SES has been correlated with increased blood pressure, worser cholesterol profiles and increased risk for other cardiovascular diseases.

===Inequalities in care by community===

==== Black community ====
In Canadian healthcare, Black individuals encounter pervasive discrimination from overt acts like harassment to subtle daily indignities, eroding trust and discouraging Black Canadians from seeking medical care. A quantitative study in the Greater Toronto Area found that all 24 Black women participants experienced objectification, maltreatment, and unequal power dynamics in healthcare, mirroring historical patterns of oppression and exposing racial treatment disparities amid challenging healthcare access.

Black Canadians encounter significant racial treatment disparities, including lower rates of receiving biologic treatments such as medications for rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, compared to White patients. Additionally, limited participatory visits with physicians and clinical trials, undermining treatment validation. Despite Canada&#x27;s universal healthcare access, socioeconomic status exacerbates these disparities, hindering low-income individuals&#x27; access to prescription drug coverage and specialist care. Evidently, racialized persons are twice as likely as non-racialized persons to face these challenges. These issues are further compounded by historical and systemic contexts and a lack of diversity among healthcare workers, shaping negative healthcare experiences for Black individuals.

In contemporary Canadian healthcare, research indicates that everyday racism adversely affects the health outcomes of Black Canadians and other racialized communities. For instance, in Ontario, Black people, constituting 5% of the population, represented one-quarter of new HIV diagnoses. Additionally, throughout the first 14 months of the COVID-19 epidemic in Toronto, Black people accounted for 14% of cases and 15% of hospitalizations, despite comprising 9% of the city&#x27;s population. These findings highlight that Black Canadians face insensitivity and discrimination from healthcare providers, dissuading individuals from seeking care and exacerbating disparities in health outcomes. 

Studies highlight that evidence-informed health promotion initiatives and interventions targeting racism&#x27;s impact on health and within Canadian healthcare are crucial for promoting health equity, rebuilding trust within the healthcare system, and improving public health outcomes in Canada. Additionally, collecting ethically disaggregated ethno-racial data for monitoring outcomes is essential for positive changes within the Canadian healthcare system.

==== Indigenous community ====
It is well documented in the literature that Indigenous peoples in Canada lack equitable access to healthcare services for a variety of reasons. One major reason for this inequitable access is due to Indigenous locations of residence. Statistics Canada reported that the majority of Métis live in urban centres, while almost half of First Nations people live on reserves. In rural northern communities, they struggle to attract and retain healthcare professionals, leaving a great shortage in services that results in far lesser access to care. In the Inuit Nunangat, it was found that just 23% of Inuit had a medical doctor they regularly visited. Additionally, due to the lack of healthcare access in northern communities, many are forced into lengthy transportation to southern Ontario to receive necessary care. One study examined an Inuit community in Rigolet, Canada, and looked at the direct and indirect costs of these long-distance healthcare visits, including missed paid employment, mental well-being costs, transportation costs and others. Altogether, this community experiences healthcare costs greater than other Canadian non-Indigenous and urban areas.

Another prominent reason for inequitable access to care is the persistence of racism that remains in Canada. In 2012, The Health Council of Canada conducted a series of meetings across the country with a variety of healthcare workers, researchers and Aboriginal people. Through their conversations, they discovered that a large part of the problem comes from the healthcare system. They found that many Indigenous people simply do not trust mainstream health service due to stereotyping, racism and that they feel intimidated. One participant described their experiences as &quot;being treated with contempt, judged, ignored, stereotyped, racialized, and minimized.&quot; Finally the Health Council of Canada went on to describe that this lack of equitable access comes as an extension of systemic racism in Canada.

A 2015 study examined 80 Indigenous women who experienced neurological conditions. Participants described their lack of access to health services to stem from the racism and sexism experienced in the system. In the same study, the researchers interviewed multiple key informants, including various types of health practitioners. They described how important it is for the health system to implement culturally safe care. They also discussed how many stereotyping problems occur in medical school and that Canada requires further Indigenous-centred training. They recommend higher education and awareness training amongst medical schools and healthcare institutions to address the growing healthcare disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples in Canada.

==== LGBT community ====
Canadians in the LGBT community, especially those in poverty, receive inadequate levels of treatment. A research study by Lori Ross and Margaret Gibson notes that of all demographics, LGBT members need mental health services the most due to systemic discrimination. According to the study, LGBT members often need to turn to mental health services that are mainly private and not covered by publicly funded healthcare. Low-income LGBT members might be unable to afford these private programs; subsequently, their mental health issues may remain unaddressed or even worsen.

Researcher Emily Colpitts states that LGBT members in Nova Scotia experience ambiguous or alienating language in their health policies. According to Colpitts, the &quot;heteronormative and gender-binary language and structure of medical intake forms have the consequence of alienating LGBT populations.&quot; Colpitts adds that in the previous study of queer and transgender women in Nova Scotia, patients experienced significant discomfort in their meetings with healthcare providers and feared that because of the language of health policy, they would not be able to receive adequate healthcare based on their sexual identities.

According to researcher Judith MacDonnell, LGBT members, especially childbearing lesbians, have trouble navigating through health policy. MacDonnell states that LGBT women encounter challenges at every point of the childbearing process in Canada and have to rely on personal and professional means to receive information that they can understand, such as in reproductive health clinics and postpartum or parenting support.

The healthcare needs of the LGBT community are affected by a number of social, behavioural, and structural factors. Various bodies of literature have identified the health disparities associated with the LGBT community, and how these individuals receive disproportionate healthcare services. For example, mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety, eating disorders, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases are all of higher prevalence and a major concern amongst LGBT persons. These health issues are not sufficiently addressed either, as healthcare professionals (such as physicians) may be unaware of these individuals&#x27; sexual orientation. In 2008, Analysis of Canadian Community Health Service data showed that: LGB persons were more likely to seek out mental health services than heterosexuals; lesbians have lower reported rates of using family physicians. bisexuals report higher levels of unmet healthcare needs compared to heterosexuals(2); and LGB persons perceive they have less equitable access to healthcare services compared to heterosexual persons.

Another barrier that exists with regard to the healthcare disparities experienced by LGBT persons is the stigma that continues to persist in society. Moreover, LGBT populations may fear that their health needs are not considered in primary health since healthcare has been historically been constituted through a cisnormative and heteronormative framework. As a result, LGBT populations are less likely to access primary healthcare services due to the fear of discrimination. In addition, recent data shows that healthcare professionals lack adequate knowledge and cultural competence when it comes to addressing health issues predominantly affecting the LGBT community. Cultural competence is an important consideration in assessing the quality of care received by the LGBT community, as a lack of cultural competency in healthcare professionals and systems leads to a reduced life expectancy, a lower quality of life, and an increased risk of acute and chronic illness amongst LGBT persons. Research has also highlighted that higher rates of chronic illness seen in LGBT persons is associated with discrimination, minority stress, avoidance of healthcare providers, and irregular access to healthcare services.

Another important consideration in addressing the quality of care received by the LGBT community is patient-physician communication. Many health risks LGBT persons face come as a result of avoidance and/or dissatisfaction of healthcare services; this is in part due to assumptions made by the patient&#x27;s healthcare providers, such as assuming the sexuality of the patient and predicting their sexual behaviours. In these scenarios, it can be very difficult for LGBT persons to feel comfortable in a clinical setting because they may experience a decline in self-confidence and trust in their healthcare providers.

The underlying message in terms of providing equitable care, and access to care, for patients in the LGBT community is that healthcare providers and systems must be aware of the appropriate methods through which to administer care. The specific needs of LGBT persons must be appreciated in order to enhance the quality of care and provide it in a non-judgemental, gender-neutral manner.

==== Immigrants ====
Inadequate access to primary care and treatment interventions has been and continues to be a prevalent issue amongst minority populations in Canada. As a result, many immigrants are faced with constant barriers with regard to receiving high-quality care. The patient experience is revered as one of the most significant aspects of healthcare, however its relation to immigrant status is not well defined. The &quot;healthy immigrant effect&quot; is a term that recognizes how immigrants on average enter Canada with better health than those born in the country. However, over time, this health advantage experienced by immigrants may begin to decline. Multiple factors contribute to this health decline, including: racialization and discrimination, stress of immigration, barriers accessing healthcare practitioners and others.

The most prevalent barriers faced by immigrants with regard to accessing primary care services are related to geography and geographic distribution, language, and culture. Moreover, the distribution of physicians has a direct impact on the utilization of primary care services by immigrants. Immigrants tend to settle in suburbs, and long term immigrants tend to migrate toward suburban areas. These areas offer the most affordable housing options for immigrants, however this creates a &quot;spatial mismatch&quot; between patients and physicians since physicians and medical services are primarily concentrated in urban areas.

Language is another strong barrier faced by immigrant populations due to the poor distribution of same-language physicians. Immigrants often face challenges in terms of understanding English medical terms. These linguistic differences are yet another contributing factor to the discordance and miscommunication between immigrants and English-speaking physicians.

Since healthcare services in Canada are paid in-part by the federal and provincial governments and by health insurance systems, economic and financial barriers are generally not considered to be a severe issue dealt with by the immigrant community. However, local availability (i.e., spatial accessibility) of physicians and individual patient preferences such as ethnicity and language spoken by physicians are both impactful factors contributing to the precipitous decrease in primary healthcare access by immigrants.

Many immigrants report experiencing social isolation in Canada while also lacking social support from friends or family, which significantly impacts their mental health and also impacts their access to mental health services. Other racialized immigrants, specifically seniors, may be reluctant to access mental health services due to the stigmatization that surrounds these issues. Another significant barrier reported was the difficulty immigrants faced in finding mental health providers that were appropriately trained in cultural sensitivity.

Immigrants in Canada face multiple barriers to accessing mental health services. As with primary care access, the language barrier between healthcare providers and immigrants remains one of the greatest challenges in delivering mental health care and often leads to underuse. Many subpopulations of immigrants, including but not limited to: African women, Latin American men, Iranian immigrants and South Asian immigrants have been shown in studies to underuse mental health services due to the limited amount of services offered outside of the English language, which hinders their access to mental health care. One study discussed how immigrants avoided, or did not benefit from, mental health counselling services as there lacks an adequate amount of professional interpretation services.

Another study conducted in Montreal examined the reasons behind why immigrants were reluctant to access mental health services. They found a multitude of reasons as to why immigrants were hesitant to seek help, including the fact that their perception of Western doctors&#x27; over willingness to utilize pharmaceutical medications, while they believed in the curative powers of non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as God and traditional folk medicine.

==== Refugees ====
Refugees in Canada experience numerous barriers to healthcare, such as gaps in knowledge regarding healthcare needs, which may not be always considered by public health initiatives and policies. Immigrants and refugees are among the groups most at risk for negative health effects resulting from persistent health disparities; differences in race, socioeconomic status, income, citizenship status, and other social factors further exacerbate healthcare inequalities. Compared to immigrants, refugees often require additional healthcare due to previous conditions in their countries of origin.

The 2012 &quot;Protecting Canada&#x27;s Immigration System Act&quot; formed a tiered system that classified refugees and separated care based on these classifications. Differing levels of care were provided to refugees based on each refugee&#x27;s home country and other factors. The act also reduced healthcare coverage for refugees provided by the Interim Federal Health Program (IFHP). The changes in refugee healthcare programs created in a rise in emergency room (ER) visits due to a lack of provisions of healthcare to refugees. This created concerns among Canadian citizens that the overall cost of healthcare will rise due. According to one study, the cuts to IFHP also made funding uncertain for programs that helped pay for ER costs.

In July 2014, Canada&#x27;s Federal Court ruled that denying health services to asylum seekers was &quot;cruel and unusual treatment&quot; and therefore unconstitutional.

One study suggested open dialogue among policymakers, clinicians, and researchers and working with settlement programs to effectively respond to challenges encountered by the healthcare system regarding refugees. The study notes that supporting primary care and focusing on social accountability training in medical schools will help ensure the sustainability of the healthcare system&#x27;s response to refugees.

==== People living with intellectual disabilities ====
Healthcare needs and comorbidities are often underdiagnosed in those living with intellectual disabilities. A study conducted in Quebec, Canada investigated healthcare utilization and access amongst people with intellectual disabilities in comparison to the general population. Of the study sample, approximately 30 percent reported not having had a comprehensive medical examination in the past year, which is what is currently advised in the 2018 Canadian consensus guidelines for practitioners providing primary care for those with intellectual disabilities.

Compared to the general population, women with intellectual disabilities aged 18–69 years were found to undergo cervical cancer screening less often. Results demonstrated them to be 1.5 times less likely to undergo a Pap test in the past three years compared to similar aged women without disabilities. For breast cancer screening, women living with severe or profound intellectual disabilities or Down syndrome were found to be screened significantly less than those in the general population.

People with Down syndrome also reported the lowest usage of physiotherapy services compared to other measured population groups, which is a concern given that Down syndrome is associated with a variety of musculoskeletal problems that may be improved with physiotherapy.

===Added incentive to encourage assisted suicide===
Canada since at least 2016 has legally allowed for a so-called right to die, or legalized euthanasia. The Associated Press reported in August, 2022 that, &quot;...human rights advocates say the country&#x27;s regulations lack necessary safeguards, devalue the lives of disabled people and are prompting doctors and health workers to suggest the procedure to those who might not otherwise consider it.&quot; Critics have raised concerns that doctors and medical professionals in Canada may have an added incentive to encourage patients to self-select an early or possibly even unnecessary instance of euthanasia as a cost cutting procedure due to governmental budget pressures based around a system of socialized medicine. Scott Shackford of &quot;Reason&quot; magazine reported on September 7, 2022, that, &quot;Unfortunately, the philosophical argument for the right to die can also end up colliding with troubling decisions in a country where the government funds and controls access to healthcare. That is reportedly happening in Canada, where some citizens say health officials are actively encouraging people with disabilities and other chronic medical issues to consider suicide.&quot;

==Canadians receiving healthcare in the United States==
Along with the highly publicized 2005 case of Shona Holmes, who campaigned against the Canadian healthcare system on behalf of the Americans for Prosperity&#x27;s PAC from 2009 through 2012, there have been other high-profiled incidents in which Canadian politicians have visited the Mayo Clinic and other highly specialized hospitals in the United States. Media reports about Robert Bourassa, the premier of Quebec in 1994, then Prime Minister Jean Chrétien&#x27;s visit to the Mayo Clinic in 1999, then Liberal MP Belinda Stronach&#x27;s visit to the Mayo in 2007, and then Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Danny Williams have been criticized for being cynical, ironic, hypocritical, and/or elitist.

An often-cited 2002 study reported in the &quot;Health Affairs&quot; journal, said that their research results did &quot;not support the widespread perception that Canadian residents seek care extensively in the United States.&quot; The Katz study—based on an analysis of data from the 1996–1997 National Population Health Survey (NPHS)—a large survey representative of the Canadian noninstitutionalized population, including 17,276 Canadian residents, reported that 0.5% sought medical care in the U.S. in the previous year. Of these, less than a quarter had travelled to the U.S. expressly to get that care. This was supported by an additional analysis performed from the American side, using a structured telephone survey of all ambulatory care clinical facilities located in specific heavily populated U.S. urban corridors bordering Canada and discharge data for 1994–1998 from major border states, and contacted key informants at each of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;&#x27;s &quot;America&#x27;s Best Hospitals&quot; to inquire about the number of Canadians seen in both inpatient and outpatient settings. The authors characterized this rate of medical travel as &quot;barely detectable relative to the use of care by Canadians at home&quot; and that the results &quot;do not support the widespread perception that Canadian residents seek care extensively in the United States.&quot; The majority of Canadians who seek healthcare in the U.S. are already there for other reasons, including business travel or vacations. A smaller proportion seek care in the U.S. for reasons of confidentiality, including abortions, mental illness, substance abuse, and other problems that they may not wish to divulge to their local physician, family, or employer. Canadians offered free care in the U.S. paid by the Canadian government have sometimes declined it.

Prime Minister Jean Chrétien traveled to the Mayo Clinic twice in 1999 for medical care. Chrétien allegedly kept the visits a secret, with one occurring during a publicly announced ski trip to Vancouver.
Canadian Liberal MP Belinda Stronach went to the United States for breast cancer surgery in June 2007. Stronach&#x27;s spokesperson Greg MacEachern was quoted in the article saying that the U.S. was the best place to have this type of surgery done. Stronach paid out-of-pocket for the surgery. Stronach had stated in an interview that she was against two-tier health care.

When Robert Bourassa, the premier of Quebec, needed cancer treatment, he went to the U.S. to get it. In 2010, Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Danny Williams travelled to the U.S. for heart surgery.

One 2008, KOMO-TV report said that some Canadian pregnant women were &quot;forced&quot; to give birth in U.S. One pregnant woman from Calgary had to deliver her quadruplets in Great Falls, Montana because at that time, in 2007, there were hospitals with enough neonatal intensive beds to accommodate the extremely rare quadruple birth.

A January 19, 2008, article in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; said that, &quot;More than 150 critically ill Canadians—many with life-threatening cerebral hemorrhages—have been rushed to the United States since the spring of 2006 because they could not obtain intensive-care beds here. Before patients with bleeding in or outside the brain have been whisked through U.S. operating-room doors. Some wait times for these patients in Canada waiting as long as eight hours in emergency wards Canadian health-care workers found solutions for them in the U.S.

===Americans visiting Canada to receive healthcare===
Some U.S. citizens travel to Canada for healthcare-related mainly to access lower costs.

Many U.S. citizens purchase prescription drugs from Canada, either over the Internet or by travelling there to buy them in person, because prescription drug prices in Canada are substantially lower than prescription drug prices in the United States; this cross-border purchasing has been estimated at $1 billion annually. Some states like Florida have signed bills to import prescription drugs from Canada but are awaiting federal approval.

Because marijuana is legal in Canada but illegal in some U.S. states, many U.S. citizens with cancer, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, and glaucoma have travelled to Canada for medical treatment. One of those was Steve Kubby, the Libertarian Party&#x27;s 1998 candidate for governor of California, who suffered from adrenal cancer. Recent legalization of marijuana in some states of the U.S. has reduced this type of travelling.

==Portability and provincial residency requirements==
The &quot;Canada Health Act&quot; covers residents of Canada, which are persons &quot;lawfully entitled to be or to remain in Canada who makes his home and is ordinarily present in the province, but does not include a tourist, a transient or a visitor to the province.&quot; When traveling within Canada, a Canadian&#x27;s health card from his or her home province or territory is accepted for hospital and physician services.

Each province has residency and physical presence requirements to qualify for health care coverage. For example, to qualify for coverage in Ontario, with certain exceptions, one must be physically present in Ontario for 153 days in any given 12-month period. Most provinces require 183 days of physical presence in any given 12-month period. Exceptions may be made for mobile workers, if the individual can provide documentation from his or her employer verifying that the individual&#x27;s work requires frequent travel in and out of the province. Transients, self-employed itinerant workers (e.g. farm workers) who move from province to province several times within a year, and peripatetic retired or unemployed individuals who move from province to province (e.g. staying with various relatives, or living in a recreational vehicle) may find themselves ineligible for health coverage in any province or territory, even though they are Canadian citizens or landed immigrants physically present in Canada 365 days a year. &quot;Snowbirds&quot; (Canadians who winter in warm climates) and other Canadians who are out their home province or territory for a total of more than 183 days in twelve months lose all coverage, which is reinstated after a three-month waiting period. Students attending a university or college outside their home province are generally covered by the health insurance program of their home province, however, &quot;Typically this coverage (while out-of-province but within Canada) is for physician and hospital services only.&quot; The Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care, for example, states, &quot;Therefore, when travelling outside of Ontario but within Canada, the ministry recommends that you obtain private supplementary health insurance for non-physician/non-hospital services.&quot; Such services might include prescription drugs, or ground and air ambulance services that might be covered in one&#x27;s home province.

==Comparison to selected other countries==
The Canadian health care system is often compared to the U.S. system. According to a report by the New York-based independent health-care advocacy group, The Commonwealth Fund, that compared 11 rich countries, over 25% of Canadians report a body-mass index of 30 or higher—a measure of obesity—compared to 40% in the U.S. This is twice the rate reported in Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland. Canada ranked 4th in the eleven countries for the number of suicides per 100,000 compared, with a rate of 11.8 per 100,000 compared to the U.S. rate of 13.9 which was the highest of the eleven wealthy countries. In both Canada and the United States there has been an increase in &quot;deaths of despair&quot; which includes substance abuse and overdoses.

From 2000 to 2015, the number of preventable deaths caused by treatable health conditions—diabetes, high blood pressure or some cancers—dropped from 109 to 72 deaths per 100,000. In 2016, of the eleven countries, the U.S. &quot;had the highest rate of avoidable deaths at 112 per 100,000&quot;.

===Healthcare spending compared to other countries===

In 2018, The OECD average represented 8.8% of GDP or CAN$5,175 per person with 27% private and 73% public. Canada&#x27;s health spending represented 10.7% of GDP or $6,448 per person with 30% private and 70% public. The U.S. spending represented 16.9% of GDP or $13,722 per person with 51% private and 49% public.

In 2022, Canada&#x27;s per-capita spending on health expenditures ranked 12th among health-care systems in the OECD.

In comparison, in 2006, Canada spent approximately 10.0% of GDP on healthcare in 2006. The average of OECD countries at that time was 8.9%.



=== Elective surgery ===
In its 2016 international health survey, the Commonwealth Fund found that 18 percent of patients in Canada had waited four months or longer for elective surgery in the previous two years, compared to 3 percent of patients in the United States, 6 percent in Switzerland, 4 percent in the Netherlands, and 0 percent in Germany.

===Life expectancy at birth===

Based on OECD 2018 data, in terms of life expectancy at birth by gender, women in France is 85.9, Switzerland&#x27;s 85.7, Canada&#x27;s 84.1, the Netherlands&#x27;s 83.4, Germany&#x27;s 83.3, and the U.S.&#x27; 81.2 years. The Commonwealth Fund report ranked Canada at slightly above average in life expectancy and the U.S. at the bottom of the list with a life expectancy of 78.6 years. Of the eleven countries, the U.S. spends the most of healthcare.

===Life expectancy at 65===
Based on Statistics Canada data from 2017 to 2019, women in Canada have a life expectancy at 65 of 22.2 years or 87.5 years and men at 65 have a life expectancy of 19.5 years or 84.5 years.

===Under-five mortality rates===

From 1971 to 2020, the under-five mortality rate per 1000 live births rate for Canada dropped gradually from 20.9 deaths per 1000 live births to 4.98 deaths per 1000.

In comparison, in the U.S. during the same period, the rate decreased slowly from 22.49 to 6.98 deaths per 1000.

===Maternal mortality rate per 100,000 live births===
In 2018, the maternal mortality rate per 100,000 live births in Canada was 8.3 deaths. Since 2008, the rate has been between &quot;4.5 and 8.7 deaths per 100,000 live births&quot;.

===Physicians per 1000 people===

According to the Commonwealth report, 11 wealthy countries have a higher number of physicians per 1000 people, than Canada. Norway has 4.8, Canada has 2.7 and the U.S. has 2.6 physicians per 1000 people.

==Legal challenges to Canada&#x27;s healthcare system==
There have been several court cases that have challenged Canadian and provincial health systems including the &quot;Chaoulli v. Quebec (Attorney General)&quot; and the high-profile, multi-year lawsuit against the provincial government, &quot;Cambie Surgeries Corporation v. British Columbia (Medical Services Commission)&quot; which ruled in favour of the BC MSC.

In June 2005, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in &quot;Chaoulli v. Quebec (Attorney General)&quot; that Quebec AG had violated the &quot;Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms&quot; by forbidding private health insurance for medically necessary health services. The ruling raised concerns for some and hope for others that there could be an increase in private sector participation in the health system. Chief Justice McLachlin ruled that &quot;[a]ccess to a waiting list is not access to health care&quot;.

The &quot;Cambie Surgeries Corporation v. British Columbia&quot; case was settled on September 10, 2020, when Justice Steeves of the Supreme Court of British Columbia ruled against legalizing private health care.

On September 5, 2007, the attorneys of Lindsay McCreith and Shona Holmes filed a statement of claim at the Ontario Superior in &quot;McCreith and Holmes v. Ontario (Attorney General)&quot; with the support of the Canadian Constitution Foundation, a &quot;conservative organization which funds litigation involving individual freedoms, economic liberty, and equality before the law&quot;.

In &quot;William Murray v. Alberta (Minister of Health)&quot; the CCF &quot;backed a challenge to Alberta&#x27;s healthcare laws&quot;.

===Cambie&#x27;s failed constitutional challenge===
On September 10, 2020, Justice John J. Steeves of the Supreme Court of British Columbia (BCSC) dismissed Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms violation claims in the high-profile, multi-year trial, &quot;Cambie Surgeries Corporation v. British Columbia&quot;, launched in 2016 by Vancouver, British Columbia-based Cambie Surgeries Corporation.

====Background====
In 2006, the Government of British Columbia threatened to shut down one private clinic because it was planning to start accepting private payments from patients.

Since 2008, Dr. Brian Day has been suing the British Columbia government on the basis that the &quot;Canada Health Act&quot; is unconstitutional. In 2016, the Government of Quebec was sued for passing Bill 20, which allows and regulates add-on fees.

Capitation based models are used in some provinces as in place of or in parallel with the traditional fee for service model.

An April 2006 perspective on private healthcare in Canada in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; included an interview with Michael McBane and Brian Day on the future of health care in Canada. In August 2007, the Canadian Medical Association (CMA) elected as president Brian Day, who owns the largest private hospital in Canada and who vocally supports increasing private healthcare in Canada. A 2006 &quot;New York Times&quot; article entitled &quot;Canada&#x27;s Private Clinics Surge as Public System Falters&quot; said that the &quot;Cambie Surgery Center&quot;—&quot;Canada&#x27;s most prominent private hospital— was operating in plain view of health authorities as a &quot;rogue enterprise&quot;. By 2006, Cambie, which was founded by Dr. Brian Day, Cambie&#x27;s medical director and president, had a staff of 120 doctors. Day was quoted in the 2006 &quot;Times&quot; saying, without evidence, that, &quot;This is a country in which dogs can get a hip replacement in under a week and in which humans can wait two to three years.&quot; The Canadian Health Coalition responded to Day&#x27;s claims, pointing out that &quot;access to veterinary care for animals is based on the ability to pay. Dogs are put down if their owners can&#x27;t pay. Access to care should not be based on ability to pay.&quot;

According to a May 1, 2006 &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; in-depth article, private medical providers in British Columbia and Quebec were expanding their services encouraged by the Supreme Court&#x27;s 2005 &quot;Chaoulli v. Quebec&quot; ruling. Quebec was influenced by the success of the blend of private and public healthcare services in France, and Brian Day was influenced by similar health services in New Zealand. &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; provided a consumer guide to private healthcare services in 2006.

In 2009, the Canadian Medical Association met to discuss the potential for an increase in private clinics in Canada&#x27;s healthcare system A European study presented at the meeting was &quot;expected to call for private clinics, such as the chain of radiology centres owned by Ouellet, to play a bigger role in Canada&#x27;s health-care system.&quot;

== Canadian healthcare contribution to Climate Change ==
Climate change is a growing concern all around the world, and its causes vary from multiple factors. It has been identified that Climate change is the single greatest public health threat of the 21st century. The healthcare sector in Canada contributes to climate change, and it was responsible for 4.6% of national greenhouse gas emission in 2009 to 2015. With the relationship between air pollution and human health, it was estimated by researchers that &quot;every year, health care emissions result in years of life lost due to disability or early death&quot;.

The health sector has contributed to pollution in various ways, with Hospitals and Pharmaceutical companies as the largest drivers of its emissions according to the PLOS Medicine study. There is also the impact of medical waste, anesthetics used in surgery, and unsustainable materials which are all greenhouse gases.

There have been projects led by The Canadian Coalition for Green Health Care with the aim to reduce the environmental impacts of providing healthcare, such as reducing toxic chemicals when cleaning and promoting sustainable foods in hospitals. They recently studied medical imaging equipment&#x27;s energy consumption. When patients and hospital staff travel to hospitals and clinics they release greenhouse gas, which can be viewed as part of the equation.

<text>The Space Trilogy (also known as The Cosmic Trilogy or The Ransom Trilogy) is a series of science fiction novels by British writer C. S. Lewis. The trilogy consists of &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; (1938), &quot;Perelandra&quot; (1943), and &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot; (1945). A philologist named Elwin Ransom is the protagonist of the first two novels and an important character in the third.

==Contents==

===Summary===
The books in the trilogy are:
*&quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; (1938), set mostly on Mars (Malacandra). In this book, Dr. Elwin Ransom is kidnapped and transported to Mars. While there, he meets the planet&#x27;s various inhabitants and discovers that Earth is exiled from the rest of the Solar System.
*&quot;Perelandra&quot; (1943). Also known as &quot;Voyage to Venus&quot;. Here, Dr. Ransom journeys to an unspoiled Venus (Perelandra), where he participates in a good vs. evil battle.
*&quot;That Hideous Strength&quot; (1945), set on Earth. A scientific think tank called the N.I.C.E. (The National Institute of Co-ordinated Experiments) is secretly in touch with demonic entities who plan to assume control of the Earth.

In 1958, the publishing house Avon published an abridged edition of &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot; entitled &quot;The Tortured Planet&quot;.

===Publication history===

*Lewis, C.S. &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot;. London : The Bodley Head, 1938.
*Lewis, C.S. &quot;Perelandra: A Novel&quot;. London : The Bodley Head, 1943.
*Lewis, C.S. &quot;That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups&quot;. London : The Bodley Head, 1945.

==Influences and approach==

Lewis stated in a letter to Roger Lancelyn Green:

The other main literary influence was David Lindsay&#x27;s &quot;A Voyage to Arcturus&quot; (1920): &quot;The real father of my planet books is David Lindsay’s &quot;A Voyage to Arcturus&quot;, which you also will revel in if you don’t know it. I had grown up on Wells&#x27;s stories of that kind: it was Lindsay who first gave me the idea that the ‘scientifiction’ appeal could be combined with the ‘supernatural’ appeal.&quot;

The books are not especially concerned with technological speculation, and in many ways read like fantasy adventures combined with themes of biblical history and classical mythology. Many of the names in the trilogy reflect the influence of Lewis&#x27;s friend J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s Elvish languages.

==Main character==

The character of Elwin Ransom appears similar to Lewis himself: A university professor, an expert in languages and medieval literature, unmarried (Lewis did not marry until his fifties), wounded in World War I, and with no living relatives except for one sibling. Lewis, however, apparently intended for Ransom to be partially patterned after his friend and fellow Oxford professor J. R. R. Tolkien, since Lewis is presented as novelizing Ransom&#x27;s reminiscences in the epilogue of &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; and is a character-narrator in the frame tale for &quot;Perelandra&quot;. In &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot;, Ransom--with his royal charisma and casual acceptance of the supernatural--appears more like Charles Williams (or some of the heroes in Williams&#x27;s books).

In &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; it is suggested that &quot;Ransom&quot; is not the character&#x27;s real name but merely an alias for a respectable professor whose reputation might suffer from his recounting such a journey to the planet Mars. In the following books, however, this is unaccountably dropped and it is made clear that Ransom is the character&#x27;s true name. As befits a philologist, he provides an etymology: The name is a contraction of the Old English for &quot;Ranolf&#x27;s Son&quot;. This may be another allusion to Tolkien, a professor of Old English. However, the name &quot;Ransom&quot; holds a deeper meaning. In &quot;Perelandra&quot;, the voice of Maleldil (Jesus) tells Ransom, &quot;&#x27;It is not for nothing that you are named Ransom&#x27;&quot;, and later adds, &quot;&#x27;My name also is Ransom&#x27;&quot;.

===&quot;The Dark Tower&quot;===

An unfinished manuscript, published posthumously in 1977 and named &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; by Walter Hooper, its editor, features Elwin Ransom in a less central role as involved with an experiment that allows its participants to view on a special screen their own location in a parallel universe. Its authenticity was impeached by Lewis scholar Kathryn Lindskoog in her criticism of Walter Hooper, but in 2003 Alastair Fowler established its authenticity when he wrote in the &quot;Yale Review&quot; that he saw Lewis writing the manuscript that would be subsequently published as &quot;The Dark Tower&quot;, heard him reading it and discussed it with him; he further stated that he gained the impression that the piece was an abandoned first attempt to write a sequel to &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot;.

==Setting==
===Cosmology===
Ransom gets much information on cosmology from the Oyarsa (presiding angel) of Malacandra, or Mars. Maleldil, the son of the Old One, ruled the Field of Arbol (the Solar System). But then the Bent One (the Oyarsa of Earth, or Satan) rebelled against Maleldil and all the eldila (much as Morgoth rebelled against Eru and the other Valar in Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;Silmarillion&quot;) of Deep Heaven (outer space). The Bent One was frustrated by Maleldil decreeing that, once humans have been created, the Oyarsa of Earth would have to cede control of the planet to them - a concession not demanded of his colleague of Mars/Malacandra, who was left to rule over the planet&#x27;s intelligent beings. The Bent One first tried to seduce the Martians, who then had the technology to build spaceships, to colonize Earth and live there as his subjects. This plan - directly contradicting Maleldil&#x27;s plans for Earth - was foiled by the other Oyéresu. Thereupon, the Bent One attacked Mars and inflicted vast damage there, causing the complete extinction of its winged creatures (who might have been an additional intelligent species, birds, or both - the reference is not clear). Only with enormous effort was life on Mars preserved.

This is, in effect, Lewis&#x27; version of the events known in Christian theology as The War in Heaven: &quot;Then war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him&quot; [Revelation 12:7–10 (NIV)].

In response to his destructive acts, the Bent One suffered confinement on Earth, where he inflicted great evil. He made Earth a silent planet, cut off from the Oyéresu of other planets; thus, Earth is referred to by the name &#x27;Thulcandra&#x27;, the Silent Planet. The Bent One, or Satan, seduced Adam and Eve and caused the Original Sin in order to make humans unworthy of getting custody of the planet, as Maleldil intended. He then continues to tempt humans into evil, so as to continue their unworthiness. However, he hates the humans, whose advent was forced upon him by Maleldil, and he mistreats and tortures also the humans who submitted to him - as seen in his treatment of Professor Weston in &quot;Perelandra&quot; and of the N.I.C.E. directors in the end of &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot;. Maleldil incarnated as a man on Thulcandra to save the human race. According to the Green Lady, Tinidril (Mother of Perelandra, or Venus), Thulcandra is favoured among all the worlds because Maleldil came to it to become a man.

Earth will remain a silent planet until the end of the great Siege of Deep Heaven against the Oyarsa of Earth. The siege starts to end (with the Oyéresu of other worlds descending to Earth) at the finale of the trilogy, &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot;. But there is still much to happen until the Oyéresu put an end to the rule of the Bent Eldil and, on the way, smash the Moon to fragments.

In the Field of Arbol, the outer planets are older than the inner planets. Asteroids are called &quot;dancers before the threshold of the Great Worlds.&quot;

===Eldila===

The &quot;eldila&quot; (singular &quot;eldil&quot;) are super-human spirits. The human characters in the trilogy encounter them on various planets, but the eldila themselves are native to interplanetary and interstellar space (&quot;Deep Heaven&quot;). They can, if they want, remain fixed to one point on a planet&#x27;s surface - but that requires a conscious act on their part, without which they would instantly drift away into space.

Certain very powerful eldila, the &quot;Oyéresu&quot; (singular &quot;Oyarsa&quot;), control the course of nature on each of the planets of the Solar System. They can manifest in corporeal forms. The title &quot;Oyarsa&quot; seems to indicate the function of leadership, regardless of the leader&#x27;s species; when the Perelandran human Tor assumes rule of his world, he styles himself &quot;Tor-Oyarsa-Perelendri&quot; (presumably &quot;Tor, Ruler of Perelandra&quot;).

The eldila are science-fictionalised depictions of angels, immortal and holy. (As Lewis implies in Chapter 22 of &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot;, the name &quot;Oyarsa&quot; was suggested by &quot;Oyarses&quot;, the name given in Bernard Silvestris&#x27;s &quot;Cosmographia&quot; to the governors of the celestial spheres. Bernard&#x27;s word was almost certainly a corruption—or a deliberate alteration—of Greek οὐσιάρχης [&quot;ousiarches&quot;, &quot;lords of being&quot;], used with the same meaning in the Hermetic &quot;Asclepius&quot;.) The eldila resident on Earth are &quot;dark eldila&quot;; in other words, fallen angels or demons. The &quot;Oyarsa&quot; of Earth, the &quot;Bent One&quot;, is Satan. During the trilogy, Ransom meets the Oyéresu of both Mars and Venus, who are described as being masculine (but not actually male) and feminine (but not actually female), respectively. The Oyéresu of other worlds have characteristics like those of the corresponding classical gods; for instance, the Oyarsa of Jupiter gives a feeling of merriment (joviality). It is made clear that they are identical with the gods and goddesses of the Greco-Roman pantheon, but that the Greeks and Romans were wrong to worship them as gods—in fact, they are angels, faithful servants of the one and only true God, Maleldil. As noted by Lewis in the non-fiction book &quot;The Discarded Image&quot;, the identification of the Greco-Roman gods as angels can be traced to late medieval and Renaissance times, when European intellectuals rediscovered and highly valued works of classical antiquity where references to these gods abound, and this needed to be reconciled with these intellectuals&#x27; Christian faith.

===Hnau===

&quot;Hnau&quot; is a word in the Old Solar language which refers to &quot;rational animals&quot; such as humans. In the book, the Old Solar speaker specifies that God is not &quot;hnau&quot;, and is unsure whether eldila can be termed &quot;hnau&quot;, deciding that if they are &quot;hnau&quot;, they are a different kind of &quot;hnau&quot; than humans or Martians.

The term was adopted by some others, including Lewis&#x27;s friend J. R. R. Tolkien; Tolkien used the term in The Notion Club Papers, which were not published in his lifetime. Tolkien distinguished &quot;hnau&quot; from beings of pure spirit or spirits able to assume a body (which is not essential to their nature). Similarly, a character in James Blish&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;A Case of Conscience&quot; wonders whether a particular alien is a &quot;hnau&quot;, which he defines as having &quot;a rational soul&quot;.

The term has been used by philosopher Thomas I. White in &quot;Is a Dolphin a Person?&quot; White asks if dolphins are persons, and if they are, whether they can also be reckoned as &quot;hnau&quot;.

===Old Solar language===

According to the Space Trilogy&#x27;s cosmology, the language of all the inhabitants of the Field of Arbol is Old Solar, or &quot;Hlab-Eribol-ef-Cordi&quot;. Only Earth lost the language; this loss was due to the Bent One&#x27;s influence. Old Solar can be likened to the Elvish languages invented by Lewis&#x27;s friend, Tolkien. The grammar is little known, except for the plurals of nouns. The plurals of some words (&quot;hross, eldil&quot;) are simple, only adding a final &quot;-a&quot; or &quot;-i&quot;; others (as for &quot;Oyarsa, sorn, hnakra&quot;), are quite complex broken plurals, adding an internal &quot;-é-&quot;, and adding or altering a final vowel (usually to &quot;-i&quot; or &quot;-u&quot;), and may also include internal metathesis (&quot;Oyéresu, séroni, hnéraki&quot;). Old Solar is also referred to as &quot;the Great Tongue&quot;:

====Terms used throughout the trilogy====

==Parallels and adaptations==
The cosmology of all three books—in which the &quot;Oyéresu&quot; of Mars and Venus somewhat resemble the corresponding gods from classical mythology—derives from Lewis&#x27;s interest in medieval beliefs. Lewis discusses these ideas in his book &quot;The Discarded Image&quot;, which was published much later than the Space Trilogy. Lewis was intrigued with the ways medieval authors borrowed concepts from pre-Christian religion and science and attempted to reconcile them with Christianity, and with the lack of a clear distinction between natural and supernatural phenomena in medieval thought. The Space Trilogy also plays on themes in Lewis&#x27;s essay &quot;Religion and Rocketry&quot;, which argues that as long as humanity remains flawed and sinful, our exploration of other planets will tend to do them more harm than good. Furthermore, much of the substance of the argument between Ransom and Weston in &quot;Perelandra&quot; is found in Lewis&#x27;s book &quot;Miracles&quot;. Links between Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Space Trilogy&quot; and his other writings are discussed at great length in Michael Ward&#x27;s &quot;Planet Narnia&quot; and in Kathryn Lindskoog&#x27;s &quot;C.S. Lewis: Mere Christian&quot;.

In &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot;, Lewis alludes several times to Tolkien&#x27;s Atlantean civilization Numinor (spelt Númenor by Tolkien), saying in the foreword, &quot;Those who would like to learn further about Numinor and the True West must (alas!) await the publication of much that still exists only in the MSS. of my friend, Professor J. R. R. Tolkien.&quot;

<text>The White Horse Stone is a name given to two separate sarsen megaliths on the slopes of Blue Bell Hill, near the village of Aylesford in the south-eastern English county of Kent. The Lower White Horse Stone was destroyed prior to 1834, at which time the surviving Upper White Horse Stone took on its name and folkloric associations. Various archaeologists have suggested—although not proven—that the stones were each part of chambered long barrows constructed in the fourth millennium BC, during Britain&#x27;s Early Neolithic period.

If the White Horse Stones were originally components of chambered long barrows, then they would have been erected by pastoralist communities shortly after the introduction of agriculture to Britain from continental Europe. Long-barrow building was an architectural tradition widespread across Neolithic Europe although comprised various localised regional variants; one of these was in the vicinity of the River Medway, examples of which are now known as the Medway Megaliths. The White Horse Stones lie on the eastern side of the river, along with the chambered long barrows of Little Kit&#x27;s Coty House, Kit&#x27;s Coty House, the (now destroyed) Smythe&#x27;s Megalith, and the Coffin Stone, which may be a part of a fourth. Three other examples, the Coldrum Long Barrow, Addington Long Barrow, and Chestnuts Long Barrow, remain on the western side of the river. Excavation has revealed the existence of an Early Neolithic longhouse near to the stone.

By the 19th century, antiquarians were speculating that the Lower White Horse Stone may have taken its name from the White Horse of Kent, which they in turn believed was the flag of the legendary fifth-century Anglo-Saxon warriors Hengest and Horsa. Subsequent historical research has not accepted this interpretation. After the stone was destroyed, the stories associated with it were transposed to a nearby sarsen boulder, which became known as the Upper White Horse Stone. Since at least the 1980s, the latter has been viewed as a sacred site by various Folkish Heathen groups, including the Odinic Rite, because of its folkloric associations with Hengest and Horsa and the Anglo-Saxon Migration. As well as performing rituals there, they have opposed vandalism of the stone and campaigned to stop development in the vicinity.

==Context==
The Early Neolithic was a revolutionary period of British history. Between 4500 and 3800 BC, it saw a widespread change in lifestyle as the communities living in the British Isles adopted agriculture as their primary form of subsistence, abandoning the hunter-gatherer lifestyle that had characterised the preceding Mesolithic period. This came about through contact with continental European societies, although it is unclear to what extent this can be attributed to an influx of migrants or to indigenous Mesolithic Britons adopting agricultural technologies from the continent. The region of modern Kent would have been key for the arrival of continental settlers and visitors, because of its position on the estuary of the River Thames and its proximity to the continent.

Britain was then largely forested; widespread forest clearance did not occur in Kent until the Late Bronze Age (c.1000 to 700 BC). Environmental data from the vicinity of the White Horse Stone supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and Amygdaloideae. Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the island&#x27;s Early Neolithic economy was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic life.

===Medway Megaliths===

Across Western Europe, the Early Neolithic marks the first period in which humans built monumental structures in the landscape. These constructs include chambered long barrows, rectangular or oval earthen tumuli which had a chamber built into one end. Some of these chambers were constructed from timber, although others were built using large stones, now known as &quot;megaliths&quot;. The long barrows often served as tombs, housing the physical remains of the dead within their chamber. Individuals were rarely buried alone in the Early Neolithic, instead being interred in collective burials with other members of their community. These chambered tombs were built all along the Western European seaboard during the Early Neolithic, from southeastern Spain up to southern Sweden, taking in most of the British Isles; the architectural tradition was introduced to Britain from continental Europe in the first half of the fourth millennium BC. Although there are stone buildings—like Göbekli Tepe in modern Turkey—that predate them, the chambered long barrows constitute humanity&#x27;s first widespread tradition of construction using stone.

Although now all ruined and not retaining their original appearance, at the time of construction the Medway Megaliths would have been some of the largest and most visually imposing Early Neolithic funerary monuments in Britain. Grouped along the River Medway as it cuts through the North Downs, they constitute the most southeasterly group of megalithic monuments in the British Isles, and the only megalithic group in eastern England. The archaeologists Brian Philp and Mike Dutto deemed the Medway Megaliths to be &quot;some of the most interesting and well known&quot; archaeological sites in Kent, while the archaeologist Paul Ashbee described them as &quot;the most grandiose and impressive structures of their kind in southern England&quot;.

The megaliths can be divided into two separate clusters: one to the west of the River Medway and the other on Blue Bell Hill to the east, with a distance between the two clusters of between . The western group includes Coldrum Long Barrow, Addington Long Barrow, and the Chestnuts Long Barrow. The eastern group consists of Smythe&#x27;s Megalith, Kit&#x27;s Coty House, and Little Kit&#x27;s Coty House, while various stones on the eastern side of the river, most notably the Coffin Stone and White Horse Stone, may also have been parts of such structures. It is not known if they were all built at the same time, or whether they were constructed in succession, while similarly it is not known if they each served the same function or whether there was a hierarchy in their usage.

The Medway long barrows all conformed to the same general design plan, and are all aligned on an east to west axis. Each had a stone chamber at the eastern end of the mound, and they each probably had a stone facade flanking the entrance. They had internal heights of up to , making them taller than most other chambered long barrows in Britain. The chambers were constructed from sarsen, a dense, hard, and durable stone that occurs naturally throughout Kent, having formed out of sand from the Eocene epoch. Early Neolithic builders would have selected blocks from the local area, and then transported them to the site of the monument to be erected.

These common architectural features among the Medway Megaliths indicate a strong regional cohesion with no direct parallels elsewhere in the British Isles. Nevertheless, as with other regional groupings of Early Neolithic long barrows—such as the Cotswold-Severn group in south-western Britain—there are also various idiosyncrasies in the different monuments, such as Coldrum&#x27;s rectilinear shape, the Chestnut Long Barrow&#x27;s facade, and the long, thin mounds at Addington and Kit&#x27;s Coty. These variations might have been caused by the tombs being altered and adapted over the course of their use; in this scenario, the monuments would be composite structures.

The builders were probably influenced by pre-existing tomb-shrines. Whether those people had grown up locally, or moved into the Medway area from elsewhere, is not known. Based on a stylistic analysis of their architectural designs, the archaeologist Stuart Piggott thought that the plan behind the Medway Megaliths had originated in the area around the Low Countries; conversely, Glyn Daniel thought their design derived from Scandinavia, John H. Evans thought Germany, and Ronald F. Jessup suggested an influence from the Cotswold-Severn group. Ashbee noted that their close clustering in the same area was reminiscent of the megalithic tomb-shrine traditions of continental Northern Europe, and emphasised that the megaliths were a regional manifestation of a tradition widespread across Early Neolithic Europe. He nevertheless stressed that a precise place of origin was &quot;impossible to indicate&quot; with the available evidence.

==Features==

===Lower White Horse Stone===
The Lower White Horse Stone once stood about west of Upper White Horse Stone. It was located to the north-west of where the Pilgrims&#x27; Way bisected the Rochester-to-Maidstone road, with the latter now being the A229 dual carriageway. Philp and Dutto thought that the site of the Lower White Horse Stone was probably under the A229. Evans called this the &quot;Original White Horse Stone&quot;, but noted that it was sometimes known as &quot;The Kentish Standard Stone&quot;. Apparently also made from sarsen, the stone was broken up prior to 1834. It is possible that the Lower White Horse Stone was part of a former chambered long barrow, although Philp and Dutto noted that any such link was &quot;uncertain&quot;.

===Upper White Horse Stone===

The Upper White Horse Stone () is in length, in height, and about thick. It is sarsen. The White Horse Stone is situated in &quot;a narrow strip of woodland&quot;, known as Westfield Wood, which is adjacent to the Pilgrim&#x27;s Way. The megalith lies to the east of the A229 dual carriageway, and can be reached by going behind the nearby petrol garage and following the Pilgrim&#x27;s Way.

The Upper White Horse Stone took its name from the destroyed Lower White Horse Stone; that it had taken on this name was first noted in print in 1927. Reflecting this, Evans called it the &quot;Successor White Horse Stone&quot;. He believed that at one end it had the &quot;crude outline of a face caused by the natural configuration of the rock&quot;. It is scheduled under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979.

It is possible that the Upper White Horse Stone was once part of a chambered long barrow that has otherwise been destroyed. Philp and Dutto, however, noted that its identification as part of a long barrow was &quot;uncertain&quot;. In supporting this possibility, Evans noted that upright stone resembled a &quot;chamber wallstone&quot; akin to those at Coldrum and Kit&#x27;s Coty House. However, there is no visual trace of any earthen mound having existed next to the monolith. Nine smaller stones extend westward from the White Horse Stone for about ten metres. It is possible that these stones were not placed there in the Early Neolithic but were moved there at a later date by local farmers who found them in their fields.

===Nearby Neolithic features===

The White Horse Stone is located near to where another chambered long barrow, Smythe&#x27;s Megalith, was found in 1822. This chamber was found to contain broken pieces of human bone, among them parts of a skull, ribs, thigh, leg, and arm bones. After being discovered buried in a field by farm labourers, the chamber of this long barrow was destroyed, meaning that nothing of this monument can now be seen. Various sarsen stones have been found in the vicinity of both Smythe&#x27;s Megalith and the White Horse Stone, perhaps reflecting the remnants of since-destroyed long barrows.

To the south of the White Horse Stone was a building—termed &quot;Structure 4806&quot; by its excavators in the 2000s—that was constructed in the Early Neolithic period. Radiocarbon dating from the site suggests a usage date of between 4110-3820 and 3780-3530 calibrated BC. long and wide, it was a longhouse of a type known from across various parts of Europe. If it had been a domestic residence, its size would mean that it was only &quot;occupied by a small number of occupants, probably no more than a small family group&quot;. A smaller, circular building approximately in diameter was present just to the south-east of the longhouse; there was little dating evidence for this, but what existed suggested a Late Neolithic origin.

The archaeologist Timothy Champion noted that the presence of these structures does &quot;not fit well&quot; with the broader evidence for Early Neolithic life being &quot;still partly mobile&quot; but that this would be explained if the buildings were not residential. He suggested that the longhouse &quot;had a role that was more communal and ceremonial than purely residential and domestic, though such a stark division may not have made sense in the Neolithic&quot;. The archaeologists who excavated these buildings suggested that they might have been &quot;houses of the living&quot; that were intervisible with the &quot;houses of the dead&quot;, including Smythe&#x27;s Megalith. Alternately, they suggested that the longhouse could have been &quot;part of the funerary tradition&quot;, used in preparing &quot;the remains of the dead or for communal activities such as feasting&quot;.

==Later history==

Around away from the Neolithic houses, a settlement was established on a spur of higher ground during the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age. This included several round houses and deep pits cut into the underlying chalk. These pits were perhaps originally used for corn storage, although were later infilled with ceramics, iron objects, animal bone, and two human burials. The archaeologists who investigated the site believed that this material was not just domestic refuse but had been deposited with greater meaning as part of a ritual act.

===Antiquarianism and folklore===

In his 1834 book &quot;A Brief Historical and Descriptive Account of Maidstone and its Environs&quot;, the antiquarian S. C. Lampreys noted that the &quot;White Horse Stone&quot;—meaning the Lower White Horse Stone—had been &quot;broken into pieces and thrown into the road&quot;. Lampreys also described the site where the stone &quot;lay&quot;, with Ashbee suggesting that this indicated it had lain prone prior to being destroyed.

Lampreys noted that it was a &quot;tradition&quot; that after the legendary fifth-century invaders Hengest and Horsa battled Vortimer and Catigern, their battle standard—which featured a white horse—was found at the stone. Lampreys did not express a view as to whether this tale was &quot;true or false&quot;. Lampreys was the first to include the link between the stone and Hengest and Horsa in published form, with Ashbee later noting that &quot;its continuance stems from this source&quot;. Ashbee suggested that the story could have been linked to the stone as a result of the antiquarian William Lambarde&#x27;s 16th century enthusiasm for the Anglo-Saxon past, but ultimately considered this unlikely given that—as argued by Ronald Jessup—the motif of the white horse of Kent only arose later, in the 17th century. Jessup was openly critical of the link, stating that &quot;stories of the god-like White Horse of Kent attached to [the stone] are quite without foundation&quot;, going on to describe such connections as &quot;nonsense&quot;.

In 1842, Douglas Allport included a woodcut of the Lower White Horse Stone in his book on the nearby town of Maidstone. In the mid-1840s, the antiquarian Beale Post discussed the White Horse Stone among other antiquities in the local area in an unpublished manuscript. He provided four possible explanations of the name&#x27;s derivation: that after the Battle of Aylesford, the White Horse banner of the Saxons fell upon the stone; that when the sun hits in a certain direction it casts a shadow which looks like a horse; that the Iron Age druids sacrificed a white horse on it; and that someone riding a white horse was killed near it. In that same manuscript, Post provided a sketch of the Lower White Horse Stone.

In his 1924 publication dealing with Kent, the archaeologist O. G. S. Crawford, then working as the archaeological officer for the Ordnance Survey, listed the Upper White Horse Stone alongside the other Medway Megaliths. William Coles Finch then discussed the site in his 1927 work, &quot;In Kentish Pilgrimland, its Ancient Roads and Shrines&quot;, including a photograph of it; at this point it was in the open air rather than being found in a patch of woodland. In 1970, the archaeologist R. F. Jessup published an account of the stone alongside another photo, indicating that by this time trees had grown up around it.

The folklorists Fran and Geoff Doel suggested that the White Horse Stone might have been the feature referred to as a &quot;Druid Stone&quot; in a nineteenth-century account of a ghost dog. This account was produced by a vicar who stated that while he and a friend were returning to Burham from a visit to Boxley Church, they found themselves being pursued by &quot;a lean grey dog with upstanding ears[… which] appeared as big as a calf.&quot; The vicar related that the creature then pursued them to the &quot;Druid Stone&quot;.

==Modern Paganism==

The White Horse Stone has come to be seen as a sacred site by folkish Heathens that place a focus on an essentialist understanding of race. One folkish Heathen group, the Odinic Rite, was founded in 1973; its co-founder John Yeowell adopted the White Horse Stone as &quot;the birth place of England&quot; and held a blót ceremony there to &quot;reclaim and make holy&quot; the megalith. The group emphasise the idea of English ancestry at the site, regarding it as &quot;the symbolic birthplace of the English nation&quot;, and a &quot;symbolic site for the remembrance of Hengest and Horsa and the coming to these lands of our faith&quot;. Unlike other Pagans who perform rituals at the Medway Megaliths, such as a modern Druidic group, these folkish Heathens understand &quot;ancestors&quot; not as people who inhabited the same landscape in the past, but as people to whom they are related by blood.

Some members of the Odinic Rite share the view of other modern Pagans that the White Horse Stone and other Medway Megaliths are connected to &quot;earth energies&quot; that pre-modern peoples were more &quot;in tune with&quot; than their contemporary counterparts. Since 1987, the Odinic Rite has performed rituals at the site, usually on a monthly basis, although also for rites of passage like handfasting weddings, commitments to the group, and funerary ceremonies. In accordance with his wishes, in 2010 Yeowell had his cremated ashes scattered at the stone following a funeral at the West London Crematorium in Kensal Green.

In 1987, members of the Odinic Rite formed the Guardians of the White Horse Stone, a group devoted to protecting the site; they installed timber steps from the Pilgrim&#x27;s Way enabling visitors better access to it. In the 1990s, they unsuccessfully campaigned to stop the Channel Tunnel Rail Link from being tunnelled close to the Stone. The Guardians group fell dormant, although was revived in 2004 to deal with a new situation; in 2003, the telecommunications company Orange sought planning permission to build a radio tower within a few metres of the stone. The Odinic Rite, in tandem with another folkish Heathen group called Woden&#x27;s Folk, successfully petitioned Tonbridge and Malling Council to reject the proposal. In 2006, Orange revived their application, although this time proposed to move the tower further from the White Horse Stone. The Guardians again campaigned against this. The White Horse Stone has also been vandalised on various occasions, with visitors having drawn and painted on it. Members of the Odinic Rite have endeavoured to remove this graffiti using methods they believe are not harmful to the stone.

<text>The Crystal Palace transmitting station, officially known as Arqiva Crystal Palace, is a broadcasting and telecommunications site in the Crystal Palace area of the London Borough of Bromley, England (). It is located on the site of the former television station and transmitter operated by John Logie Baird from 1933.

The station is the eighth-tallest structure in London, and is best known as the main television transmitter for the Greater London area and parts of the surrounding Home Counties. As such, it is the most important transmitter in the UK in terms of population covered. The transmitter is owned and operated by Arqiva.

==History and development==

The station was constructed in the mid-1950s among the ruins of the Crystal Palace. The Aquarium on whose site it stands was destroyed in 1941 during the demolition of the Palace&#x27;s north water tower. (John Logie Baird&#x27;s earlier transmitter and TV studios were a separate development at the other end of the Palace and perished with it in 1936.) Its new tower was the tallest structure in London until the topping-out of One Canada Square at Canary Wharf in 1990.

The first transmission from Crystal Palace took place on 28 March 1956, when it succeeded the transmitter at Alexandra Palace where the BBC had started the world&#x27;s first scheduled television service in November 1936. In November 1956 the first colour test transmissions began from Crystal Palace, relaying live pictures from the studios at Alexandra Palace after BBC TV had closed down for the night. In May 1958 the first experimental Band V 625-line transmissions started from Crystal Palace.

This tower was designed and built for BBC by British Insulated Callender&#x27;s Construction Co. Ltd., with steelwork fabrication by Painter Brothers Ltd. of Hereford. The tower was required to transmit television programmes with good reception in 1957, and has a total height of . The base of the tower is to a side, and it rises in twelve diminishing panels to a square platform at a height of . The tower was constructed using two masts as derricks, one and the other high, in conjunction with a winch. At the time, a 16mm film of the construction by BICC was produced; this was available on loan from the BICC Film Library.

===Innovations===
The transmitter was the first in the UK to broadcast (experimentally) on 625 lines (UHF) in 1962–1964, which it did on Channel 44, using a modified version of the SMPTE optical monochrome test card (not to be confused with the SMPTE colour bars).

On 18 July 1986, with the First Night of the Proms on BBC2, the transmitter became the first in the world to transmit stereophonic sound using the NICAM digital sound system.

===Television===
When built it transmitted BBC Television on the VHF 405-line system; the Croydon transmitter two miles away had been built some months earlier to broadcast ITV. When UHF transmissions started in 1964, first the new BBC2 and later both BBC 1 and ITV (Rediffusion weekdays and ATV London at weekends) were transmitted from Crystal Palace. Thames Television began in 1968 along with London Weekend which became London Weekend Television (LWT) in 1978. 405-line VHF television was discontinued at the start of 1985.

The station carried the London regions of BBC One, BBC Two, ITV1 and Channel 4 in analogue, each with an effective radiated power of 1 MW, before digital switchover took place during April 2012, as well as all six digital terrestrial television multiplexes. These had an effective radiated power of 20 kW before switchover and 200 kW after, with considerable beam tilt to the south and east. With digital switchover completed all services come from Crystal Palace again, but because of the site&#x27;s importance Croydon will be able to duplicate the PSB multiplexes in case of emergency. DTT requires less power to achieve the same coverage as analogue TV, hence the transmission powers have been reduced by 7 dB compared to analogue; however, the coverage range of approximately was expected to be largely similar post-switchover.

===Radio===
It is also used for FM radio transmission of local radio stations BBC Radio London, Radio X, Capital Xtra and Greatest Hits Radio London (which until March 2021 carried Absolute Radio), and a low-powered relay of the four BBC national FM services - Radio 1, Radio 2, Radio 3 and Radio 4, and Classic FM. It also has medium wave transmitters on 558 kHz (Panjab Radio)) and 1035 kHz (Lyca Gold). Since the tower is grounded, a wire aerial span close to it is used for the MW services.

Since 1995 the tower has been one of five London transmitters for the BBC DAB multiplex. This was joined in 1999 by the Digital One DAB service, and a further local DAB multiplex has since started transmitting, on behalf of the Klarna shopping channel.

BBC Radio 4&#x27;s mediumwave frequencies from this transmitter ended on 15 April 2024 following a retune loop informing listeners to retune.

===High definition===
In May 2006 it began broadcasting the first terrestrial HDTV signals in the UK to a trial group of 450 London homes to test HD broadcasts by the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5, to assess the viability and potential problems of future nationwide HD broadcasting. On 2 December 2009 the site entered service as one of the first DVB-T2 transmitters in the world, carrying a variant of the BBC&#x27;s Multiplex B broadcasting high-definition TV services.

===Digital switchover===
The Government&#x27;s plans for digital switchover were based on the use of almost all current analogue TV transmitter sites. Crystal Palace remained a key part of the network after analogue was switched off in the London area in April 2012. In July 2007 it was confirmed by Ofcom that Crystal Palace would remain an A group transmitter after DSO (digital switchover). This was partially reversed with the 700 MHz Clearance that resulted in the use of Channels 55 and 56 for digital television both outside the A Group.

The transmitter is only one of two (the other being the ITV Granada transmitter at Winter Hill) that alone provides ITV and BBC services for the whole of their region, although still supported by the usual network of relays. Between opening in 1974 and January 1982, the main transmitter at Bluebell Hill broadcast ITV London signals to much of north and central Kent. However, the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), the then regulator of commercial television, reorganised the ITV franchises which saw Bluebell Hill transferred to a new south and south-east dual-region of ITV (Television South – TVS), which took effect from 1 January 1982. Bluebell Hill now transmits ITV Meridian and BBC South East.

As one would expect for the largest transmitter in the country – by population coverage – Crystal Palace transmitter remained an A group, (which was its original analogue group) both during dual running (analogue and low-power pre-DSO digital) and full-power digital after DSO. However, in March 2018, during the transmitter&#x27;s 700 MHz clearance, the temporary MUXES 7 and 8 were moved out of group to CH55 and CH56. Thus, reception of the latter two MUXES now requires a wideband or K group aerial (see graph). MUXES 7 and 8 were, however, due to be switched off sometime before 2023.

On 18 April 2012, a public lighting display was performed from the tower to mark the last day of analogue TV broadcasts from the transmitter.

===Relay stations===
The three most powerful relays are Reigate (covering a large area of south Surrey and northern areas of West Sussex), Guildford (for the Guildford area and parts of south west Surrey) and Hemel Hempstead (parts of Hertfordshire). There are also low-power relays situated across Greater London and also in parts of Kent, West Sussex, Surrey, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire.

<text>&quot;What&#x27;s that got to do with the...?&quot; is an expression denoting an irrelevance or &quot;non sequitur&quot; in the current discussion.
A common form, &quot;&quot;, is a retort to an irrelevant suggestion. This facetious usage implies that the topic under discussion might as well be the price of tea in China for all the relevance the speaker&#x27;s suggestion bears on it.

== Related expressions ==
A related expression in Hebrew can be found in a commentary on the Biblical commandment of the septennial Shmitah or sabbatical year. Leviticus 25:1 specifically states that God spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai; while this was a common location for God to speak to Moses, the text&#x27;s explicit reference to it is very rare. Accordingly, Rashi&#x27;s commentary begins with the question &quot;What does Shmita have to do with Mount Sinai?&quot; (?מה עניין שמיטה אצל הר סיני) The question in rabbinic culture took on a general meaning equivalent to that of the &quot;price of tea in China&quot; expression.

There is also a similar phrase in Polish which says: &quot;What does a &quot;piernik&quot; have to do with a windmill?&quot; (&quot;Co ma piernik do wiatraka?&quot;). The exact origin of the expression is uncertain. Another similar phrase also exists in French, &quot;Quel est le rapport avec la choucroute?&quot;, which translates to &quot;What does it have to do with the sauerkraut?&quot; Another common expression in English is &quot;What&#x27;s that got to do with the price of fish?&quot;, which itself apparently evolved from &quot;What&#x27;s that got to do with the price of eggs?&quot;, a saying that dates back to the 1920s or possibly earlier.

<text>Smythe&#x27;s Megalith, also known as the Warren Farm Chamber, was a chambered long barrow near the village of Aylesford in the south-eastern English county of Kent. Probably constructed in the 4th millennium BCE, during Britain&#x27;s Early Neolithic period, it was discovered in 1822, at which point it was dismantled. Built out of earth and at least five local sarsen megaliths, the long barrow consisted of a roughly rectangular earthen tumulus with a stone chamber in its eastern end. Human remains were deposited into this chamber.

Archaeologists have established that the monument was built by pastoralist communities shortly after the introduction of agriculture to Britain from continental Europe. Although representing part of an architectural tradition of long barrow building widespread across Neolithic Europe, Smythe&#x27;s Megalith belonged to a localised regional variant produced in the vicinity of the River Medway, now known as the Medway Megaliths. Several of these still survive: Coldrum Long Barrow, Addington Long Barrow, and Chestnuts Long Barrow are on the river&#x27;s western side, while Kit&#x27;s Coty House, the Little Kit&#x27;s Coty House, and the Coffin Stone are on the eastern side nearer to Smythe&#x27;s Megalith. Close to the site of the lost monument is the White Horse Stone, a standing stone that may have once been part of another chambered long barrow.

The site may have been ransacked during the Middle Ages, as other Medway Megaliths were. By the early 19th century it was buried beneath soil, largely due to millennia of hillwash coming down from the adjacent Blue Bell Hill. In 1822, it was discovered by farm labourers ploughing the land; the local antiquarians Clement Smythe and Thomas Charles were called in to examine it. Shortly after, the labourers pulled away the stones and dispersed most of the human remains, destroying the monument. Smythe and Charles produced, but did not publish, reports on their findings, and these have been discussed by archaeologists since the mid-20th century.

==Location==

Smythe&#x27;s Megalith was located on the south-facing combe of Blue Bell Hill, within the vicinity of Warren Farm, near the village of Aylesford in the south-eastern English county of Kent. The location where it was found lies in a large field now to the east of the A229 dual carriageway. Nothing of the monument can now be seen and the specific location cannot be publicly accessed.

==Context==

The Early Neolithic was a revolutionary period of British history. Between 4500 and 3800 BCE, it saw a widespread change in lifestyle as the communities living in the British Isles adopted agriculture as their primary form of subsistence, abandoning the hunter-gatherer lifestyle that had characterised the preceding Mesolithic period. This came about through contact with continental European societies, although it is unclear to what extent this can be attributed to an influx of migrants or to indigenous Mesolithic Britons adopting agricultural technologies from the continent. The region of modern Kent would have been key for the arrival of continental European settlers and visitors, because of its position on the estuary of the River Thames and its proximity to the continent.

Britain was then largely forested; widespread forest clearance did not occur in Kent until the Late Bronze Age (c.1000 to 700 BCE). Environmental data from the vicinity of the White Horse Stone, a putatively prehistoric monolith near the River Medway, supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and amygdaloideae. Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the island&#x27;s Early Neolithic economy was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic life.

===Medway Megaliths===

Across Western Europe, the Early Neolithic marks the first period in which humans built monumental structures in the landscape. These constructs include chambered long barrows, rectangular or oval earthen tumuli which had a chamber built into one end. Some of these chambers were constructed from timber, although others were built using large stones, now known as &quot;megaliths&quot;. The long barrows often served as tombs, housing the physical remains of the dead within their chamber. Individuals were rarely buried alone in the Early Neolithic, instead being interred in collective burials with other members of their community. These chambered tombs were built all along the Western European seaboard during the Early Neolithic, from southeastern Spain up to southern Sweden, taking in most of the British Isles; the architectural tradition was introduced to Britain from continental Europe in the first half of the fourth millennium BCE. Although there are stone buildings—like Göbekli Tepe in modern Turkey—which predate them, the chambered long barrows constitute humanity&#x27;s first widespread tradition of construction using stone.

Although now all ruined and not retaining their original appearance, at the time of construction the Medway Megaliths would have been some of the largest and most visually imposing Early Neolithic funerary monuments in Britain. Grouped along the River Medway as it cuts through the North Downs, they constitute the most southeasterly group of megalithic monuments in the British Isles, and the only megalithic group in eastern England. The archaeologists Brian Philp and Mike Dutto deemed the Medway Megaliths to be &quot;some of the most interesting and well known&quot; archaeological sites in Kent, while the archaeologist Paul Ashbee described them as &quot;the most grandiose and impressive structures of their kind in southern England&quot;.

The megaliths can be divided into two separate clusters: one to the west of the River Medway and the other on Blue Bell Hill to the east, with a distance between the two clusters of between 8 and 10 kilometres (5 and 6 miles). The western group includes Coldrum Long Barrow, Addington Long Barrow, and the Chestnuts Long Barrow. The eastern group consists of Smythe&#x27;s Megalith, Kit&#x27;s Coty House, Little Kit&#x27;s Coty House, the Coffin Stone, and several other stones which might have once been parts of chambered tombs, most notably the White Horse Stone. It is not known if they were all built at the same time, or whether they were constructed in succession, while similarly it is not known if they each served the same function or whether there was a hierarchy in their usage.

The Medway long barrows all conformed to the same general design plan, and all aligned on an east to west axis. Each had a stone chamber at the eastern end of the mound, and they each probably had a stone facade flanking the entrance. The chambers were constructed from sarsen, a dense, hard, and durable stone that occurs naturally throughout Kent, having formed out of silicified sand from the Eocene epoch. Early Neolithic builders would have selected blocks from the local area, and then transported them to the site of the monument to be erected.

These common architectural features among the Medway Megaliths indicate a strong regional cohesion with no direct parallels elsewhere in the British Isles. For instance, they would have been taller than most other chambered long barrows in Britain, with internal heights of up to 3.8 metres (10 feet). Nevertheless, as with other regional groupings of Early Neolithic long barrows—like the Cotswold-Severn group in south-western Britain—there are also various idiosyncrasies in the different monuments, such as Coldrum&#x27;s rectilinear shape, the Chestnut Long Barrow&#x27;s facade, and the long, thin mounds at Addington and Kit&#x27;s Coty. These variations might have been caused by the monuments being altered over the course of their use.

The builders were probably influenced by pre-existing tomb-shrines. It is not known if these people had grown up locally, or moved into the Medway area from elsewhere. Based on a stylistic analysis of their architectural designs, the archaeologist Stuart Piggott thought that the plan behind the Medway Megaliths had originated in the area around the Low Countries; conversely, Glyn Daniel thought their design derived from Scandinavia, John H. Evans thought Germany, and Ronald F. Jessup suggested an influence from the Cotswold-Severn group. Ashbee noted that their close clustering in the same area was reminiscent of the megalithic tomb-shrine traditions of continental Northern Europe, and emphasised that the megaliths were a regional manifestation of a tradition widespread across Early Neolithic Europe. He nevertheless stressed that a precise place of origin was &quot;impossible to indicate&quot; with the available evidence.

==Design==

The part of the chambered long barrow that was discovered was a stone chamber composed of four large stones. The stones used were sarsens. The northern stone measured by by . The southern stone measured by by . The third stone, on the western side, measured by by . A fourth, smaller stone, measuring by by , was placed to prevent the north stone falling onto its southern counterpart. This may have once been used to divide the chamber in two. Given the recorded dimensions of the stones, Ashbee suggested that the chamber may have once measured in length and could have included as many as ten sarsen stones in its original construction. He also suggested that it would have had a height of around , making it one of the smaller chambers in the Medway region; the chamber at Kits Cot House, for instance, reached over in height, and that at Chestnuts Long Barrow reached a height of about .

Below these megaliths was a flat stone, measuring in length and in width. Lying atop this stone were human remains, reportedly aligned in an east to west orientation. Ashbee noted that such paving stones are rare in recorded chambered tombs, and suggested that it might instead have once been a cover stone that sat atop the chamber, but which had been knocked down at some point in the monument&#x27;s history. In this scenario, the bones found atop it would have to have been disturbed from their original position. Also on the flat stone, near to the human remains, was the skull of a mole. A small sherd of unglazed pottery was also found with the bones. This need not have dated from the original period of the site&#x27;s construction; as found at other, better-recorded sites, chambered long barrows could remain open for centuries or millennia after they were built, during which time other material was placed inside. For instance, small sherds of Beaker pottery, dating from the Late Neolithic, were found at Kit&#x27;s Coty House, and the sherd found at Smythe&#x27;s Megalith might also date from this period.

At the time of the site&#x27;s discovery, there was no apparent barrow, in part because the ground level of the area had been raised by millennia of hillwash coming down from further up Blue Bell Hill. However, as a result of what is known of this architectural style from better-recorded sites, it is apparent that this stone chamber would have been located at the eastern end of a long earthen barrow. Ashbee noted that this could have reached a length of 55 metres (180 feet). It may be that kerbstones also lined the sides of this barrow, as is evident at several other of the Medway Megaliths; Ashbee suggested that this could have contained as many as 110 or 120 sarsen stones. The monument may have had ditches flanking its sides, and chalk rubble collected in digging these ditches may have been piled up to help form the barrow.

During the Early Neolithic, the site may have been close to other chambered long barrows; the White Horse Stone, for instance, is nearby and may have once been part of the chamber of a long barrow. Various sarsen stones have been found in the vicinity of both, again perhaps reflecting the remnants of since-destroyed long barrows. To the south of the White Horse Stone was a building—termed &quot;Structure 4806&quot; by its excavators in the 2000s—that was constructed in the Early Neolithic period. Radiocarbon dating from the site suggests a usage date of between 4110-3820 and 3780-3530 calibrated BCE. long and wide, it was a longhouse of a type known from across various parts of Europe. If it had been a domestic residence, its size would mean that it was only &quot;occupied by a small number of occupants, probably no more than a small family group&quot;. A smaller, circular building approximately in diameter was present just to the south-east of the longhouse; there was little dating evidence for this, but what existed suggested a Late Neolithic origin. The archaeologists who excavated these buildings suggested that they might have been &quot;houses of the living&quot; that were intervisible with the &quot;houses of the dead&quot;, including Smythe&#x27;s Megalith. Alternately, they suggested that the longhouse was &quot;part of the funerary tradition&quot;, used in preparing &quot;the remains of the dead or for communal activities such as feasting&quot;.

===Human remains===
Analysis of the bones found in the chamber took place in the 1820s. At the time, it was noted that most of the bones were broken into small pieces—something the examiner believed had been caused by the workmen who recovered them—but that they included pieces of skull, ribs, thigh, leg, and arm bones. There were two right sides of mandibles and two portions of ulnae including the olecranon, indicating that the remains of at least two individuals were present in the chamber. Analysis of the recovered teeth showed that the molars were worn down and flattened, indicating that the deceased had been of middle age.

==Later history==

Around away from the Neolithic houses, a settlement was established on a spur of higher ground during the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age. This included several round houses and deep pits cut into the underlying chalk. These pits were perhaps originally used for corn storage, although were later infilled with ceramics, iron objects, animal bone, and two human burials. The archaeologists who investigated the site believed that this material was not just domestic refuse but had been deposited with greater meaning as part of a ritualistic act.

Ashbee suggested that the chambered long barrow may have remained visible into the Middle Ages, and at this point may have been damaged by individuals digging into it. In support of this idea, he highlighted that the archaeological excavation of Chestnuts Long Barrow had confirmed that that long barrow had been deliberately damaged in the 12th or 13th century. Similar claims of medieval destruction have also been made for Lower Kit&#x27;s Coty House, Kit&#x27;s Coty House, Coldrum Long Barrow, and Addington Long Barrow. Ashbee suggested that this destruction was probably due to iconoclasm, believing that the burial of the stones likely indicated that medieval Christian zealots had tried to deliberately destroy and defame the pre-Christian monument.

Conversely, the archaeologist John Alexander believed that this damage resulted from a robbery by medieval treasure hunters. Supporting this idea is comparative evidence, with the Close Roll of 1237 ordering the opening of barrows on the Isle of Wight in search for treasure, a practice that may have spread to Kent around the same time. Alexander believed that the destruction may have been brought about by a special commissioner, highlighting that the &quot;expertness and thoroughness of the robbery&quot;—as evidenced at Chestnuts—would have necessitated resources beyond that which a local community could likely produce.

==Discovery and investigation==

In 1822, workmen were ploughing in a field at Warren Farm when they found that their ploughs were repeatedly striking stones beneath the surface. Removing the topsoil, they discovered three large stones several inches below. The farm&#x27;s owner, George Fowle of Cobtree Manor, called in two men from Maidstone to inspect the monument: the antiquarian and historian Clement Taylor Smythe, and Thomas Charles, a doctor who lived in Maidstone and who had founded a museum at Chillington House. With Smythe present, the workmen removed the soil around the three stones, also revealing a smaller stone as part of the construct. As it was revealed, Smythe became aware of its similarity to the nearby Kit&#x27;s Coty House. The stones were then removed, likely with the assistance of horses, destroying what remained of the monument.

The following day, the workmen returned to the site, where they dug deeper and revealed a flat stone on which the human remains were found; Smythe was not present on this occasion. The workmen threw most of the human remains to the side, but some were collected by Smythe and analysed by Charles.

A brief article announcing the discovery appeared in the &quot;Maidstone Journal&quot; on 4 July 1822. The information included in that article was largely repeated in an issue of the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; later that year. The latter also featured some brief discussion as to who the deceased individuals in the chamber had been, speculating that it was &quot;some chief slain in the battle fought here between Vortimer, King of Britain, and the Saxons&quot;. A second description of the site appeared in &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1834, written by S. C. Lampreys.

About a year after the discovery, Smythe wrote an account in which he included both a sketch and plan of the chamber. Smythe&#x27;s original report was not published at the time, but deposited in the archive of Maidstone Museum. In this unpublished document, he referred to the monument as a &quot;British Tomb&quot; or a &quot;Druidical Monument&quot;. The document was only published in 1948, in an article written for the &quot;Archaeologia Cantiana&quot; journal by the archaeologist John H. Evans. Evans noted that &quot;meagre and incomplete as it is&quot;, &quot;we must be grateful&quot; for this document &quot;when we remember the unrecorded destruction wrought throughout the centuries upon this interesting and isolated megalithic necropolis&quot;.

Alongside Smythe&#x27;s report, a second brief account was produced and placed in the museum, likely written by Charles and again published in Evans&#x27; 1948 article. Ashbee later related that both of the reports written in the 1820s were &quot;brief but valuable&quot; and &quot;in many ways in advance of their age&quot;. He noted that the destruction of prehistoric monuments during this &quot;age of agricultural development&quot; would have been quite commonplace and thus these antiquarians&#x27; records—written &quot;almost half a century before the emergence of the outlines of present-day prehistory&quot; as a field of scholarly study—were particularly important.

In the 1920s, the archaeologist O. G. S. Crawford accessed the Maidstone Museum archives to determine the probable location of Smythe&#x27;s Megalith. He then included the site in his 1924 Ordnance Survey guide to archaeological sites in southeastern England. In 1955, several substantial stones were also found in the area. In 2000, Ashbee stated that some of the kerbstones had &quot;recently come to light, buried in the ditches&quot; of the monument.

<doc id="811839" wikidata="Q2129" url="?curid=811839" title="Bode Miller">
<text>Samuel Bode Miller ( ; born October 12, 1977) is an American former World Cup alpine ski racer. He is an Olympic and World Championship gold medalist, a two-time overall World Cup champion in 2005 and 2008, and the most successful male American alpine ski racer of all time. He is also considered one of the greatest World Cup racers of all time with 33 race victories and being one of five men (and last to date) to win World Cup events in all five disciplines. He is the only skier with five or more victories in each discipline. In 2008, Miller and Lindsey Vonn won the overall World Cup titles for the first U.S. sweep in 25 years.

Miller won six medals in the Winter Olympics, the most of any U.S. skier − two silvers (giant slalom and combined) in Salt Lake City 2002, a gold (super combined), a silver (super-G) and a bronze (downhill) in Vancouver 2010 and a bronze (super-G) in Sochi 2014. Miller is one of 5 skiers who have won Olympic medals in 4 different disciplines, matching the feats of Kjetil André Aamodt and female racers Anja Pärson, Janica Kostelić and Katja Seizinger.

Miller ended his career with six discipline World Cup titles and also won four World Championships titles in four different disciplines (giant slalom, combined, super-G and downhill) and one silver medal in super-G. While his skiing career was coming to an end, Miller had switched his attention and investment to horse racing. He officially retired from ski racing in October 2017.

During and after his ski career, Miller has been involved in multiple businesses as a founder, strategic advisor and investor. During his career, Miller was the initial investor in lifestyle and nutrition brand Onnit in 2010, a company founded by his close friend Aubrey Marcus. In 2020, Miller co-founded SKEO, a wearable ski tracking app company. In January 2021, Miller joined the Board of Directors of Opex Technologies, an IT Technology company focused on advising, implementing, and supporting technology transformation projects. Most recently, in December 2021, Miller joined Alpine-X, developers of year-round indoor snowsports resorts, as an investor and Chief Innovation Officer, alongside his business partner Andrew Wirth who joined as a Strategic Advisor.

==Early years==
Born in Easton, New Hampshire, to Jo Kenney and Woody Miller, Miller grew up in nearby Franconia, a small community in the heart of New Hampshire&#x27;s White Mountains that comprises the Cannon Mountain Ski Area. His family, including older sister Kyla, and younger brother Chelone, lived on of land in a forest, where his parents celebrated solstices, in a log cabin without electricity or indoor plumbing. He was raised a vegetarian. He was homeschooled until the third grade, but after his parents divorced, he began attending public school. He applied for and got a scholarship to the Carrabassett Valley Academy, a ski racing academy in Maine. His mother&#x27;s parents owned and started the Tamarack Tennis Camp, and he has played tennis and soccer since childhood.

Miller first gained widespread recognition after winning two silver medals at the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics in the giant slalom and combined events, though he had been known to skiing fans since he burst onto the international scene as an 18-year-old in 1996. Miller is known for his reckless style, often risking crashes to increase his chances of winning a given race; in his book, &quot;Bode: Go Fast, Be Good, Have Fun,&quot; Miller stated that his goal as a skier was not to win medals, but rather to ski &quot;as fast as the natural universe will allow.&quot; In 2006, Miller also became famous for his reclusive (but outspoken) personality and his attention-getting statements.

==Ski racing career==

===The Beginnings (1998–2001)===
Miller not only first appeared in the World Cup during the 1998 season but also represented the United States in the 1998 Nagano Olympics, competing in both of the technical disciplines (giant slalom and slalom). In 1999, he also competed in super-G (which is considered a speed discipline, not a technical one) and represented the U.S. in all three events at the World Ski Championships at Beaver Creek, with a best finish of 8th in slalom. He finally achieved a podium in a giant slalom at Val d&#x27;Isère on December 17, 2000 (placing third), but then only competed in super-G at the 2001 World Ski Championships; he crashed during the downhill portion of the combined and tore knee ligaments, which ended his competition.

===Double Silver (2002)===
During this season, Miller began regularly competing in downhill, making him a five-event skier on the World Cup circuit, although he was still considered a technical specialist. Miller won his first World Cup race on December 29, 2001, taking the giant slalom at Val-d&#x27;Isère, and then followed it up the next day with another win in the slalom at Madonna di Campiglio. He would go on to win two more slalom races in January 2002, along with a pair of silver medals at the 2002 Winter Olympics in February, thus establishing himself as the top racer on the U.S. Ski Team.

Miller won his first ever Olympic medal on February 13, in the combined event. He was 15th after the downhill portion losing 2.44 seconds to Kjetil André Aamodt. He then put a remarkable second run of the slalom portion to finish second overall just 0.28 behind Aamodt. Later on Miller won a second silver medal, this time in the giant slalom where he lost only to Stephan Eberharter of Austria. Miller was on a verge of winning medals in all disciplines he had entered at the Olympics, while he was second after first run of the slalom race. At the starting gate before his final run Miller had already a huge advantage of 1.79 seconds over then leading Sébastien Amiez. Instead of having a careful run to secure at least another silver medal, Miller decided to push for a gold. The tactics resulted in a fall and missed gate, which caused him to finish far behind the medal positions.

This was his final season on Fischer skis; he switched to Rossignol following the season&#x27;s completion.

===Becoming a World Cup Champion (2003–2005)===
Miller challenged for the 2003 World Cup overall title but fell just short, finishing second to Stephan Eberharter of Austria.
At the 2003 World Championships in St. Moritz, Switzerland, Miller won three medals: gold in giant slalom and combined, and silver in super-G. He also won two other giant slaloms during the season.

In the 2004 season, Miller won World Cup titles in two disciplines: giant slalom and combined, but placed fourth in the competition for the overall title. He won six World Cup races: three giant slaloms, two combineds and one slalom. After the season, Miller switched to Atomic skis.

Miller won his first overall World Cup title in 2005, defeating Austrians Benjamin Raich and Hermann Maier. He made history early in the season by winning at least one race in each of the four standard World Cup disciplines: slalom, giant slalom, super-G and downhill. In winning a slalom in Sestriere on December 13, he joined Marc Girardelli of Luxembourg, who had been the first man to accomplish this feat in 1989. Miller accomplished the feat in less time than any previous ski racer, male or female; the victory was his sixth of the season after only ten races. At the 2005 World Championships in Bormio, Italy, he won two gold medals, in super-G and downhill. In the downhill portion of the combined, he lost a ski 16 seconds into the race, but decided to continue down the course nevertheless at speeds up to 83 km/h on one ski, before sliding out near the bottom nearly two minutes later.

===Disappointment (2006)===

Despite the hype surrounding Miller prior to the 2006 Winter Olympics, every one of Miller&#x27;s five medal bids in the Turin Games fell short: he finished a disappointing 5th in the downhill, was disqualified – while in first place at the time – during the second leg of the combined event, failed to finish the super-G, tied for 6th in the giant slalom, and had another DNF after missing a gate in the first run of the slalom. Nevertheless, Miller won two races during the season (a giant slalom and a super-G) and placed third for the season&#x27;s overall World Cup title. At the 2006 U.S. National Championships following the World Cup season, Miller won the downhill and giant slalom titles. He switched to Head skis following the season&#x27;s completion. Miller had prolotherapy treatments, an alternative treatment that has shown no effect in clinical trials, to the ligaments in his knee or knees in February 2006, with other ski team members, Bryon Friedman and Eric Schlopy.

===Independent World Cup Champion (2007–2009)===
Miller had four first-place finishes (two downhills and two super-Gs) in the early going of the 2007 World Cup. For the season, Miller finished 4th overall and won the super-G title. On May 12, 2007, Miller announced that he was leaving the U.S. Ski Team. He followed the precedent set by slalom skier Kristina Koznick, who left the U.S. Ski Team following the 2000 season and raced the next six years for the U.S. as an independent.

In 2008 Miller clinched his second overall championship at the World Cup finals in Bormio, Italy. He missed a chance to also win the season&#x27;s downhill title when bad weather prevented the season&#x27;s last race from being run. Miller got his first win of the season at the Stelvio downhill in Bormio in December. On January 13, he won for the second year in a row the legendary Wengen downhill, matching Phil Mahre as the most successful American skier with 27 World Cup victories. On January 20, he broke this record by winning the Hahnenkamm combined event at Kitzbühel. On January 27, he won the first super combined in his career in Chamonix and took the lead in the World Cup standings. On February 3, he won the super combined in Val d&#x27;Isère, France, and took the combined title. On March 1, Bode got his sixth win of the season at Kvitfjell, Norway, cementing his lead in the overall standings and closing to 5 points on Didier Cuche in downhill. At the end of this impressive season he was crowned overall champion.

Miller responded to his World Cup success in 2008 with the worst season of his professional career, leading some to speculate that he might be &quot;burned out.&quot; Miller failed to win a race for the first time in eight years and had only two official podium finishes, both seconds in downhill, to show for his season. Miller suffered a torn ligament in his left ankle in a December fall at Beaver Creek, which may have been a factor in his performance. He took a four-week break from competition in February and March, the first World Cup races that he had failed to start in three years, and missed the end of the World Cup season, although he still had a chance to win the season&#x27;s downhill title. He said that &quot;the fire goes away after a while&quot;, and he hinted at retirement.

===Reunited for Olympic Triple (2010)===
After returning to the U.S. Ski Team, Miller missed much of the early part of the 2010 season due to an ankle sprain which he suffered during a volleyball game with other members of the team. However, he returned by winning a World Cup super-combined event in Wengen on January 15, 2010, for his first victory in nearly two years.

He made the U.S. team for the 2010 Winter Olympics in late 2009 and was selected to compete in all five events, despite his lack of training. In his first race, after several delays due to warm weather and poor snow conditions, Miller won a bronze medal in the downhill, the first American to win an Olympic medal in downhill since Tommy Moe won gold in 1994. Miller&#x27;s time was 1:54.40, nine hundredths of a second behind gold medalist Didier Défago, and two hundredths behind Aksel Lund Svindal, who took the silver; the time difference between the gold and bronze medals was the smallest in Olympic downhill history. He then won a silver in the super-G, giving him four Olympic medals, more than any other American alpine racer. On February 21, 2010, he won his first Olympic gold medal in the super combined. After the downhill portion of the race, Miller was in seventh place, but finished third in the slalom portion, giving him a total time of 2:44.92 to finish first overall. Miller then failed to finish both the giant slalom and the slalom, and took the rest of the season off due to continuing problems with his ankle injury.

===Last victory and a break (2011–2013)===
Miller followed his Olympic success with the mediocre season, but still managed to finish Top 3 in three occasions. He was third at the city event in Munich, second to Didier Cuche at Kitzbuehel&#x27;s downhill and third in super-G at Hinterstoder. He started World Championships in Garmisch-Partenkirchen with typical Bode-like fashion at super-G race. He was leading the field despite losing a pole midway through the course, however he lost his balance coming out of a bend at the bottom, slowed down and stood up as he crossed the finish line on 12th position.

Miller earned the 33rd World Cup win of his career with a downhill victory in Beaver Creek. He topped young Swiss sensation Beat Feuz with four hundredths of a second. He also managed to finish 2nd in super-G at Val Gardena, 3rd in a super-combined event in Wengen and 2nd in a downhill race in Chamonix, where he was one hundredth of a second behind Klaus Kroell.

After undergoing a knee surgery in spring 2012, Miller decided not to rush his comeback to the slopes and announced in January 2013 that he would skip the entire season to ensure a completely healthy run for his fifth Olympics in 2014.

===Comeback for Bronze (2014)===
At the beginning of his comeback season, Miller unexpectedly finished second at Beaver Creek&#x27;s giant slalom, only behind fellow American Ted Ligety, which was his first podium in the discipline since 2007. Miller&#x27;s hopes of winning his first downhill race at Kitzbühel came up short after he made a significant mistake in the middle section of the course to eventually finish third. Next day he ended up second only behind Didier Défago in super-G at the same mountain.

Miller began the Winter Olympics by winning two out of three training sessions before the downhill. However, as sunny conditions of the training days changed into a cloudy race day, he was not able to keep up the momentum and finished in eighth position. He was then unable to defend his title from the previous Olympic Games as he finished sixth in the super combined event. On February 16, 2014, Miller became the oldest Olympic medalist in alpine skiing history, by winning a bronze medal in the super-G race. He shared a third place podium with Jan Hudec of Canada. By collecting his sixth Olympic medal, Miller moved to the second position on the all-time list of Olympic male medalists in alpine skiing, only behind Kjetil André Aamodt who won eight medals. In his last race of the Olympics, Miller finished 20th in the giant slalom, won by U.S. teammate Ligety.

After the Olympics, Miller decided to continue competing until the end of the season for the first time since 2008. At the World Cup finals in Lenzerheide, he gained his fourth podium of the season while finishing 3rd in the super-G race. Miller finished the season ranked eighth overall, his best in 6 years.

===Injuries, ski legal dispute &amp; retirement (2015–2017)===
On November 17, 2014, Bode Miller announced that he would undergo outpatient back surgery to alleviate the pain and discomfort he had felt since the end of the previous season. After attending official trainings to the downhills in both Wengen and Kitzbühel, but skipping the races, Miller was trying to make a comeback for the 2015 World Championships held at Vail / Beaver Creek, Colorado. On February 5, he crashed during the super-G race, after catching a gate. During the crash his leg was cut by an edge of his ski and he suffered a torn hamstring tendon. The injury forced him to withdraw from the rest of the championships.

After celebrating the birth of his son, his first child with Morgan Beck, Miller announced in October that he would skip another season with the intention of spending more time with his family and to focus on his new-found passion of horse training. Even though some people started to suspect that this might mean the end of his skiing career, Miller denied it in December, stating that although he would never do the full circuit again, there was a likelihood that he&#x27;d return to racing occasionally. He terminated his contract with HEAD early under the restriction that he would not compete with other skis than HEAD on the World Cup circuit or in the World Alpine Ski Championships. He was then able to sign a deal with US-based ski manufacturer Bomber Ski, which also made Miller the brand&#x27;s part owner.

At the end of 2016, Miller wanted to make another comeback to the tour and compete with Bomber skis. HEAD, however, blocked the attempt, stating that Miller had agreed not to compete with other ski brands for 2 years from the moment their agreement had been terminated. While Miller argued that HEAD&#x27;s action illegally prevented him from competing to earn a living, HEAD rejected that argument and showed disappointment in Miller for not honoring his word by trying to race with different skis.

On October 31, 2017, Miller announced his retirement from competition. He was also inducted into the US Ski and Snowboard Hall of Fame, Class of 2018.

== Olympic results ==
Miller is one of the most successful alpine ski racers in Olympic history. He participated in five Winter Olympics, from 1998 through 2014. Miller had 19 starts in all five alpine disciplines and won six medals, including one gold in the super combined event in 2010. He is the only American ski racer in history to win medals at three different Olympics.

==World Championships results==
==Publicity, press and promotions==

===2002 Olympics===
Miller&#x27;s fame was partly spawned by his 2002 Winter Olympics slalom performance. He had already won two silver medals and was in line for a third when he missed a gate. Instead of stopping, he hiked back up the course to retry the gate and finish. That performance established Miller&#x27;s reputation as a competitor who cares more about the way he skis rather than winning medals. He admitted that after the race:

===2006 Olympics controversy===
The good feeling generated by Miller&#x27;s 2002 Olympic performance was quickly dissipated in 2006. On the program &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, in January 2006, Miller described the act of skiing &quot;wasted&quot; and compared it to lawlessly driving while intoxicated. Throughout the Olympics, Miller said, &quot;I&#x27;m just trying to ski in a way that&#x27;s exciting for me.&quot; In an interview shortly after his last race, he said that it had &quot;been an awesome two weeks,&quot; and that he &quot;got to party and socialize at an Olympic level.&quot; After an unapologetic Miller interview with Tom Brokaw, Bob Costas concluded in a primetime editorial that Miller might finally get what he wanted: to be unceremoniously forgotten. Miller received negative coverage in the American and international media; editorials focused on his attitude of simply not caring about the Olympics or about his performance.

Many perceived his &quot;party at an Olympic level&quot; attitude as a violation of the &quot;Olympic Spirit.&quot; When Nike&#x27;s 2006 advertising campaign urged consumers to &quot;Join Bode,&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; sportswriter Sally Jenkins asked, &quot;Where? At the bar?&quot; in reference to his well-publicized nights on the town in Sestriere. He was even called the &quot;biggest bust in Olympic history&quot; for his performance. Some have argued that Miller&#x27;s management and PR team were partly to blame for his crash-and-burn publicity, pointing out that they facilitated the media blitz in the months leading up to the Olympics. This overexposure was bound to backfire, given Miller&#x27;s known uneven commitment to performing. Miller himself said:

===2010 Olympics success===

Miller&#x27;s success in the 2010 Olympic Games has been contrasted with his 2006 results. Miller&#x27;s explanation for his belated success was simple: &quot;Most likely it&#x27;s because I decided that&#x27;s what I wanted to do.&quot; At the 2010 games, his coaches stated that he &quot;helps inspire [them],&quot; a very different attitude from that of four years previously. Miller himself said that the difference was that in 2006, his role as &quot;poster boy&quot; for the Olympics, after the corruption scandals associated with the 2002 Winter Olympics (bid scandal and figure skating scandal), was &quot;the absolute thing I despise the most in the world&quot; and &quot;really draining on my inspiration, my level of passion.&quot; Ultimately, the publicity &quot;had been happening for a year, and it was just too much.&quot; By contrast, in 2010, he noted that he was not so proud of the medals themselves but of the &quot;absolutely amazing&quot; feeling when &quot;you ... magically ski at your absolute best.&quot; He ended the 2010 Olympic Games as the most successful American skier and athlete overall.

Miller was nominated for the Associated Press&#x27; Male Athlete of the Year award for 2010, but finished second to Drew Brees of the New Orleans Saints football team thanks to votes cast for Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team who finished third.

===2014 Olympics emotions===

Miller&#x27;s surprisingly dominating performance in training for the downhill race helped to create a hype among press and fans, with his teammate Marco Sullivan saying that it was &quot;his race to lose&quot; and rival Kjetil Jansrud describing Miller&#x27;s performance in trainings as &quot;epic&quot;. Just a day before the race, Miller himself claimed that &quot;The idea is to be unbeatable&quot; and &quot;I want to win&quot;. After finishing a disappointing 8th in the race, Miller pointed to various reasons for his failure including warmer temperatures, poor visibility, and his need for an eye surgery while U.S. Ski Team coach Sasha Rearick suggested that &quot;Bode wanted it too much&quot;. The change in Miller&#x27;s attitude compared to that in his previous Olympic appearances showed after he won a bronze medal at the super-G race when he admitted that &quot;some days, like I said, medals don&#x27;t matter. Today was one of the days where it does matter&quot;. After the race, NBC&#x27;s reporter Christin Cooper caused some controversy by repeatedly asking Miller about his dead brother until he broke down in tears. Miller however defended Cooper afterwards in several occasions saying that &quot;I know she didn&#x27;t mean to push&quot; and &quot;I don&#x27;t blame her at all&quot;.

===Selected press reaction===
According to John Canzano, &quot;Oregonian&quot; reporter, Miller is generally unpopular with American reporters who cover skiing. One referred to him in 2009 as &quot;a tedious bore given to statements that smack of hypocrisy.&quot; Another said that Miller&#x27;s behavior had alienated him from &quot;pretty much everyone but those who mindlessly celebrate rebels simply for their rebellion, however misplaced it might be.&quot;

===In book, film, and game===
Miller&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Bode: Go Fast, Be Good, Have Fun&quot;, co-written with his friend Jack McEnany, was published by Villard/Random House on October 18, 2005. Miller also became the first American alpine skier since Tommy Moe to endorse a video game when &quot;Bode Miller Alpine Racing&quot; was released for mobile phones on January 30, 2006, followed by &quot;Bode Miller Alpine Skiing&quot; for PlayStation 2 and Windows. In 2006 Miller was the subject of a biographical film produced by the Coruway Film Institute, &quot;Flying Downhill&quot;, which looks at the people and the place Miller comes from, and where exactly each fits within his philosophy.

===Chosen ski sponsors===
Miller has used a variety of skis during his World Cup career. He originally started off on K2 skis, then raced on Fischer through the 2002 season. He switched to Rossignol for two seasons (2003 and 2004), then Atomic for the following two (2005 and 2006). In June 2006, he moved over to Head, along with Hermann Maier of Austria and Didier Cuche of Switzerland.

==Team America==
In May 2007, Miller left the US Ski Team and raced independently for his personally financed Team America for two seasons. This allowed him more control of his training, equipment, staff, and sponsors. With fewer distractions, increased autonomy, and responsibility, Miller improved his focus and won his second overall title. However, the next season (2009) was the worst of his career after he crashed hard in the Beaver Creek Downhill, injuring his heel, and Miller folded Team America at the end of 2009. Miller departed the 2009 season before its completion and rejoined the US Ski Team in October 2009.

==Other sports==
In 2002, Miller won ABC Sports&#x27; &quot;Superstars&quot; competition, a televised event that pits athletes from different sports against one another in a series of athletic contests. In 2009, he competed in a &quot;Superstars&quot; team competition, which paired an athlete with a celebrity. Miller was paired with Paige Hemmis and they finished in second place.

On July 29, 2006, Miller signed a one-day contract to play baseball for the Nashua Pride (Canadian-American League). He went 0–2 with two strikeouts, however he did make an acrobatic catch in left field, which earned national attention by being featured by ESPN, among others. The team said it would donate at least $5,000 from ticket sales for the game to Miller&#x27;s Turtle Ridge Foundation, which will give the money to the Lance Armstrong Foundation.

On July 23, 2007, Miller again signed a one-day contract, to play the first three innings July 24, 2007, for the Nashua Pride, to raise money for charity.

In April 2010, Miller opened the Boston Red Sox&#x27;s baseball season by throwing out the ceremonial first pitch at Fenway Park.

On June 3, 2010, Miller competed for a spot in the 2010 US Open through the new national playoff system introduced by the USTA. The winner of the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s playoff championships received a wild-card entry into the Open qualifying tournament. He lost 6–4, 6–2 to Erik Nelson-Kortland in an opening match at sectional playoffs in Hawaii.

==Personal life==
Miller has a daughter, Neesyn Dace (born 2008), with Chanel Johnson; and a son, Samuel Bode (born 2013), with Sara McKenna.

On October 7, 2012, Miller married professional beach-volleyball player and model Morgan Beck. Their son, Edward Nash Skan Miller, was born on May 18, 2015, and daughter, Emeline &quot;Emmy&quot; Grier, was born on November 5, 2016. In April 2018, the couple announced that they were expecting their third child. On June 10, 2018, 19-month-old Emeline died after drowning in a swimming pool at a neighbor&#x27;s house in Orange County, California. Their second son, Easton Vaughn Rek Miller, was born on October 5, 2018. In August 2019, Bode and Morgan announced they were expecting twin boys on NBC&#x27;s Today Show. The twin boys were born November 8, 2019, and are named Asher and Aksel. In May 2021, Bode and Morgan announced that they were expecting their sixth child. On November 26, 2021, the couple welcomed a daughter, Scarlet Olivia Khione Miller.

Miller&#x27;s younger brother Chelone was a snowboarder who competed in the 2010 Winter X Games in the Snowboard X event. He suffered a traumatic brain injury in a 2005 dirt-bike crash and subsequently suffered from seizures, leading to his death in 2013 at age 29.

<doc id="811849" wikidata="Q2390111" url="?curid=811849" title="Once a Thief (1991 film)">
<text>Once a Thief () is a 1991 Hong Kong heist comedy film directed by John Woo, who also wrote the screenplay with Janet Chun and Clifton Ko. The film stars Chow Yun-fat, Leslie Cheung, Cherie Chung, Kenneth Tsang and Paul Chu. The film was released theatrically in Hong Kong on 2 February 1991, before the lucrative Chinese Lunar New Year holiday season begins.

==Plot==
James (Leslie Cheung), Red Bean Pudding (Chow Yun-Fat) and Red Bean (Cherie Chung) are three orphans raised by crime lord Boss Chow (Kenneth Tsang), and grow up to become high end art thieves. Father directs the three to steal a cursed painting located in France. 

After the heist in France goes awry, Red Bean Pudding is thought to be dead, and James and Red Bean start a relationship. James finds out that the cursed painting was a ploy by Father to increase its value, and when Red Bean Pudding resurfaces again, the group begins to plot their final heist with the very painting from France all those years ago.

== Cast ==
* Chow Yun-fat as Red Bean Pudding/Joey
* Leslie Cheung as James
* Cherie Chung as Red Bean/Cheri
* Kenneth Tsang as Chow
* Paul Chu as Godfather
* Bowie Wu as Stanley Wu
* John Tang Yat-gwan as Young Red Bean Pudding
* Tong Ka-fai as Young James
* Leila Tong as Young Red Bean
* Declan Wong as Magician Henchman
* David Wu as Auctioneer
* Pierre-Yves Burton as Mr Le Bond, a Frenchman who hires Joey, and James to steal a painting, but later betrays them. Le Bond is later murdered by Chow&#x27;s henchmen as a loose end.

== Release ==
The film grossed HK$33,397,149 in Hong Kong.

Columbia Tri-Star released it on DVD in the United States on 22 April 2003. It included no special features beyond trailers. On 27 December 2004, Hong Kong Legends released a DVD in the United Kingdom. Eight months later, on 5 September 2005, the &quot;John Woo Collection&quot;, a four-disc DVD set, was released. It includes the two action films &quot;Bullet in the Head&quot; and &quot;The Killer&quot;.

== Reception ==
Scott Tobias of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote that Woo&#x27;s style makes up for the film&#x27;s implausibility and lack of logic. Kevin Lee DVD Verdict wrote that the film has &quot;a lack of focus and an uneven tone&quot;. Chris Gould of DVDactive.com rated the film 5/10 and wrote that there was too much slapstick. J. Doyle Wallis of DVD Talk rated it 2.5/5 stars and called it &quot;an odd and annoyingly silly entry during [John Woo&#x27;s] most creative period&quot;.

==Accolades==

<text>Cryptantha is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. They are known commonly as cat&#x27;s eyes and popcorn flowers (the latter name is also used to refer to the closely related genus &quot;Plagiobothrys&quot;, and members of the subtribe of &quot;Amsinckiinae&quot;). They are distributed throughout western North America and western South America, but they are absent from the regions in between.

These are annual or perennial herbs usually coated in rough hairs and bearing rounded flower corollas that are almost always white, but are yellow in a few species. Several morphological characters are used to distinguish species from one another, but the most definitive is the form of the nutlet, which varies in shape, size, color, and pattern of attachment.

<text>The Last Chronicle of Barset is a novel by English author Anthony Trollope, published in 1867. It is the sixth and final book in the &quot;Chronicles of Barsetshire&quot; series, preceded by &quot;The Small House at Allington&quot;. The novel is set in the fictional county of Barsetshire and deploys characters from the earlier novels, whilst concentrating on the personnel associated with the cathedral. The main narrative thread is catalysed by the loss of a cheque which had been in the possession of the Reverend Josiah Crawley, and the subsequent reactions of his friends and enemies. Trollope drew inspiration from his father and mother in the creation of the Rev. and Mrs. Crawley. In his autobiography, Trollope regarded this novel as &quot;the best novel I have written.&quot;, although later commentators do not agree with this judgement. The serialisation was illustrated by G H Thomas who was selected by the publisher, though Trollope had wished for Millais who had illustrated &quot;The Small House at Allington&quot;.

==Plot summary==
The Reverend Josiah Crawley, the perpetual curate of Hogglestock, has a large family and a small income. He cashes a cheque whose origin is shrouded in mystery. The novel then develops the attitudes and reactions of those around him, some of whom, not least Mrs Proudie, the virago wife of the Bishop of Barchester, conclude that Crawley stole the cheque.

The narrative contains numerous sub-plots. One, which is continued from &quot;The Small House at Allington&quot;, involves Lily Dale and Johnny Eames and is tenuously connected to the main thread. By contrast, Crawley&#x27;s daughter, Grace, is courted by Henry Grantly, son of Archdeacon Grantly, which poses problems for the archdeacon, who recoils from her lack of family rank or wealth. Initially he joins the accusatory group led by Mrs Proudie; the bishop does not agree, but succumbs to his wife&#x27;s familiar dominance.

Almost broken by poverty and trouble, Crawley hardly knows himself if he is guilty or not; fortunately, the mystery is resolved in his favour, just as Major Grantly&#x27;s determination and Grace Crawley&#x27;s own merit force the archdeacon to overcome his prejudice against her. As with Lucy Robarts in &quot;Framley Parsonage&quot;, the objecting parent finally invites the young lady into the family; this new connection also inspires the dean and archdeacon to find a new, more prosperous, post for Grace&#x27;s impoverished father.

Through death or marriage, this final volume manages to tie up more than one thread from the beginning of the series. One subplot deals with the death of Mrs. Proudie, and the bishop&#x27;s subsequent grief and collapse. Mrs. Proudie, upon her arrival in Barchester in &quot;Barchester Towers&quot;, had increased the tribulations of the gentle Mr. Harding, title character of &quot;The Warden&quot;; he dies in peaceful old age, mourned by his family and the old men he loved and looked after as Warden of Hiram&#x27;s Hospital.

== Context ==
American scholars like James Kincaid have stated that although Trollope&#x27;s &quot;The Last Chronicle of Barset&quot; is a work of fiction, it provides an insight into the Victorian era. Robert Polhemus has argued that Trollope was particularly concerned with the social changes that were emerging. Polhemus believed that such changes, including the changing ethical standards, the loss of morality, the emergence of materialism and the rise of bureaucracy had provoked fear in Trollope, thus influencing him to write the novel. Trollope perceived these changes as dangerous because such factors prevented the growth of individualism. This was of concern to Trollope because without individualism, tradition could not be shaped.

Hannah Rogers has argued that Trollope was also fascinated by the history of moral philosophy, a concept that is concerned with human ethics and the way humans react in certain situations. She draws this conclusion from how Trollope&#x27;s novel features plots that centre on human morality. The impoverished Reverend Crawley is targeted by the powerful Mrs. Proudie for an alleged theft while wealthy stockbrokers can manipulate their way through unfaithful dealings, taking their customers&#x27; money. Scholars such as Geoffrey Harvey have interpreted Trollope&#x27;s novel as a reflection of the prevailing social concerns of the late Victorian period, such as the loss of ethics as materialism began to emerge.

== Writing style influences ==

Rogers states that Trollope&#x27;s writing style was influenced by Roman orator Cicero and his concept of honestum in which he dictates &quot;all that is manly, honourable, graceful, honest and decorus&quot;. Rogers drew this conclusion from Trollope&#x27;s acclamation of Cicero for this concept in his &quot;Life of Cicero&quot;. In 1877, Trollope wrote to Henry Merivale that &quot;No doubt many a literary artist so conceals his art that readers do not know there is much art&quot;. Rogers has argued that Trollope&#x27;s honest literary style involved &quot;concealing his artistry&quot;. She interprets this as writing in a manner that did not utilise his full potential, as doing so would prevent him from creating a plot that was far-fetched and unrealistic. Trollope believed that by doing so, he would create an immediate and familiar text for ordinary readers. Writing in an &#x27;honest&#x27; manner allowed his readers to recognise the similarities between themselves and the characters. The point of this, as Rogers argues, is so that his readers do not become immersed into a world of imaginary creatures whose lives do not resemble their own in any way.

However, author Henry James criticised Trollope&#x27;s writing style in this novel, finding it &quot;rather stale&quot;. James argued that Trollope overused his &#x27;honest&#x27; writing style, causing it to lose its uniqueness and become &quot;copiously watered&quot;. James concluded that while Trollope was not the most articulate writer, he was one of the most reliable writers as his stories accurately reflected the Victorian age.

== Critical analysis ==
=== Power === 
Academic professor Kincaid has argued that power is illustrated throughout the novel. Power is held by wealthy individuals and the church, reflecting Victorian society where there was a heavy emphasis placed on God and religion. Throughout the play, the lives of lower-class individuals such as the poverty-stricken Josiah Crawley are dictated by the Church and the wealthy who hold the power within society. Ellen Moody points out that the power dynamics of society are immediately established in the opening chapter. She argues that the power of the rich is displayed through how the wealthy stockbrokers can constantly commit fraudulent actions and yet Crawley is regarded as suspicious for allegedly stealing £20. From this, Moody has interpreted the power dynamics as a reflection of one&#x27;s status in society. She claims that Crawley&#x27;s low status and impoverished living conditions have subjected him to a life dictated by the wealthy.

Miguel Perez takes note of how there are different forms of power within the novel. Doctor Grantly holds power in the sense that he is the archdeacon, manages multiple businesses and holds the position as the vicar of Plumstead. On the other hand, Reverend Crawley, who is not as wealthy as Grantly and struggles to feed his family, is powerful in the way that he is well educated and intelligent. Perez argues that while Grantly and Crawley&#x27;s characters contrast each other greatly, both possess some sort of power whether it be wealth or knowledge.

=== Pride ===
Gordon Hirsch and Louella Hirsch present the argument that pride is predominantly revealed through Reverend Crawley&#x27;s character. Both scholars argue that Crawley&#x27;s refusal to admit that he is somewhat responsible for his suffering stems from his pride. While the wealthy, such as Mrs. Proudie is responsible for placing Crawley on trial for a crime he did not commit, Crawley does not attempt to improve his situation. He resigns from his job and &quot;would do nothing. He would not eat, nor would he even sit at table or say the accustomed grace&quot;. The Hirsch academics argue that Crawley constantly blames those surrounding him, unable to see his self-inflicted suffering due to the pride he holds for himself. Furthermore, David Mazurowski states that Crawley is a prideful self martyr, someone who intentionally inflicts suffering on themselves to satisfy a mental need. In this case, Mazurowski believes that Crawley&#x27;s mental need is the desire to be perceived as heroic and noble for being able to withstand the allegations against him.

Moody notes that Lily Dale&#x27;s pride strongly resembles Crawley&#x27;s behaviour of prideful self martyr. Moody states that the only difference is that Lily&#x27;s prideful behaviour does not result in self-inflicted suffering. Instead, Lily&#x27;s pride emerges when she chooses the path of an unmarried life despite her mother&#x27;s pleas and Mrs. Thorne&#x27;s criticism of her choice to not marry. Lily tells Johnny Eames, &quot;I will not have myself planted out in the middle, for people to look at,&quot; which Moody interprets as Lily rejecting the concept of marriage. Perez admires Lily&#x27;s pride, interpreting it as a positive characteristic as he believes it demonstrates that Lily is not influenced by the societal expectations of marriage.

=== Feminism ===
Kincaid has argued that this last novel differentiates itself from the rest of the series in the role that women play. Kincaid points out that Mrs. Crawley is depicted as the one who acts as her husband&#x27;s rational side. She urges him to recognise the pointless nature of sulking, telling him to &quot;be a man and bear it&quot;. Mrs. Dale and Lily are aware of Crawley&#x27;s innocence and even more, recognise the stubbornness of men, declaring that &quot;A jury of men will not&quot;. Mrs. Proudie has no legitimate role in the Church but she does influence the actions of her husband, the Bishop of Barchester. She is confident in her ability to persuade her husband through sexual means when disagreements arise. Furthermore, Kincaid has noted the power dynamics of this couple as when alone, Mrs. Proudie calls her husband Tom yet he still acknowledges her as Mrs. Proudie. From this, Kincaid has interpreted Trollope&#x27;s novel as a reflection of his society whereby feminism was beginning to emerge.

However, Moody disagrees with Kincaid&#x27;s argument of Trollope inserting feminism in his novel, arguing that he is &quot;profoundly against regarding women as having value individually&quot;. She comes to this judgment after noting how the female characters are either wives or mothers who possess some sort of usefulness and virtue. Moreover, Moody concludes that Trollope had written Lily Dale as a character who found peace and comfort in a small house with her uncle and mother. Were Trollope a true feminist, Moody argues that Lily Dale would have been illustrated to have found happiness through traveling or finding a new job.

== Connection to Trollope’s other novels ==
While &quot;The Last Chronicle of Barset&quot; can be read as a stand-alone novel, this text is part of the &quot;Chronicles of Barsetshire&quot; series. This series has six novels that centre on the lives of the people in a small cathedral town situated in the fictional Barsetshire. The series revolves around the relationship between the rich and the poor and the sociopolitical laws of the Barsetshire society. The first novel, &quot;The Warden&quot; (1855) centres on the moral dilemmas of Reverend Septimus Harding and he appears again in the second novel, &quot;Barchester Towers.&quot;

Moody takes note of Lily Dale&#x27;s character development from &quot;The Small House at Allington&quot; (1864) to &quot;The Last Chronicle of Barset&quot; (1867). In the prior novel, Trollope had shown Lily Dale as publicly humiliated and treated as an object. However, in the last novel, Lily firmly states to Johnny Eames, upon the occasion of his final marriage proposal, &quot;I will not have myself planted out in the middle, for people to look at. What there is left would die soon.&quot; Moody suggests that this newfound confidence is evidence of her growth from a timid teenager to a prideful woman.

Mazurowski points to Reverend Crawley&#x27;s personality, arguing that Crawley&#x27;s personality as being both prideful and a self-pitying martyr has altered slightly across three novels - &quot;&#x27;Framley Parsonage (1860), &quot;&#x27;The Small House at Allington(1862) and &quot;The Last Chronicle of Barset&quot; (1867). In Trollope&#x27;s &quot;Framley Parsonage&quot;, Mazurowski takes note of Crawley&#x27;s prideful behaviour as Crawley often mocked his close friend Arabin by insulting his horse and refusing to feast with him. Mazurowski argues that Crawley&#x27;s prideful behaviour intensifies in &quot;The Last Chronicle of Barset&quot; as Crawley becomes prideful to the point where he refuses to see his own self-inflicted suffering.

== Adaptations ==
=== Visual form ===

Other than its written form, &quot;The Last Chronicles of Barset&quot; has also been transformed into visual illustrations. The visual illustration was designed by George Housman Thomas and was published in 1867 alongside the novel. Titled &quot;The Last Chronicle of Barset With Illustrations,&quot; the black and white copy features certain events from the novel. For certain illustrations, Thomas had drawn inspiration from John Everett Millais, a Victorian illustrator. Millias had provided multiple illustrations of The Crawley Family in Trollope&#x27;s fourth novel in the series, &quot;Framley Parsonage&quot;. Gordon Ray states that these illustrations serve to vividly complement the novel as they provide an understanding of Trollope&#x27;s intentions with each character. While Trollope did not draw the illustrations himself, Ray stated that each sketch was tailored to Trollope&#x27;s own personal desire as Trollope believed that &quot;the author can select the subjects better than the artist - having all the feelings of the story at his fingers&#x27; end.&quot;

=== Series ===
The novel has also been converted into a film series directed by Stephen Harrison. Released in 1959 by the British Broadcasting Corporation, the series had six episodes released over the span of three months before coming to an end. The actors in this series include Hugh Burden as Mr. Crawley, Maureen Pryor as Mrs. Crawley and Olga Lindo as Mrs. Proudie.

=== Radio drama ===
The text has been transformed into a number of radio dramas. The first was released in 1998. Directed by Cherry Cookson and dramatised by Martin Wade, the play was created following the previous success of a dramatisation of &quot;The Small House at Allington&quot;. Another radio version directed by Marion Nancarrow and dramatised by Nick Waburton was released on BBC Radio in 2011. On the Goodreads website, the radio drama currently has a rating of 4.3 stars.

=== Audiobooks ===
A number of Audiobook versions have also been created and are currently on Audible.com. One is voiced by Timothy West.

<text>DeMoulas Super Markets, Inc., under the trade name Market Basket, is a chain of 95 supermarkets as of 2025 in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Maine, and Rhode Island in the United States, with headquarters in Tewksbury, Massachusetts.

From 1990 through late August 2014, the company was the center of a controversy over ownership and leadership, which culminated in protests receiving international media attention. On August 27, 2014, an agreement was reached between its feuding owners to sell the 50.5% stake of the company owned by the family of Arthur S. Demoulas to his cousin Arthur T. Demoulas for $1.5 billion.

==History==

In 1917, Greek immigrants Athanasios (&quot;Arthur&quot;) and Efrosini Demoulas opened DeMoulas Market, a grocery store in the Acre neighborhood of Lowell, Massachusetts, that specialized in fresh lamb. In 1938, the store, which operated largely on credit due to the Great Depression, was being threatened with foreclosure. The Demoulases&#x27; youngest son, Telemachus, also known as Mike, either quit or was expelled from school and went to work at the store full-time. Eventually, the family earned the money needed to avoid foreclosure.

After World War II, Mike&#x27;s older brother, George, also joined the family business. Also after the war, housing projects were constructed in the Acre, which resulted in a larger customer base for the Demoulases. In 1950, the Demoulas Brothers opened a new store to replace the original market. In 1954, they purchased the business from their parents. By 1956, the market&#x27;s sales had jumped from $2,000 a year to $900,000 and the brothers began expanding. Within 15 years, the two brothers had transformed their parents&#x27; &quot;mom and pop&quot;-style store into a modern supermarket chain consisting of 15 stores.

On June 27, 1971, George Demoulas died of a heart attack while on vacation in Greece, making Mike the sole head of the Demoulas supermarket chain. Shortly thereafter, in an effort to skirt laws limiting the amount of beer and wine licenses one supermarket chain could have, Mike Demoulas began opening stores under different names. These stores, which eventually became the Market Basket chain, were controlled entirely by Mike Demoulas and his family.

In 1990, the widow and children of George Demoulas (including his son, Arthur S. Demoulas) sued Mike Demoulas, alleging that they had been defrauded out of their shares in the company. They claimed they had trusted Mike to take care of the family after George&#x27;s death and that he exploited this trust in order to have them sell all of George&#x27;s real estate and 84% of his shares in DeMoulas Super Markets to members of his own family for pennies on the dollar. Mike Demoulas contended that his brother&#x27;s heirs had willingly sold their shares in the company because they wanted money and their stock in DeMoulas did not pay dividends. According to Mike Demoulas, George&#x27;s widow, Evanthea, asked him to sell her shares so she could have money to raise her children, her son Evan sold his shares so he could begin an auto racing career in Europe, and her two daughters, Diana and Fotene, sold their shares after they saw how much money their brother received. However, once the company began paying dividends in 1988, the family saw how much money they could have made if they had kept their shares and sought to &quot;rewrite history&quot; in order to regain what they had sold. George&#x27;s children acknowledged that they had signed many of the documents authorizing the sales and transfers, but stated they were not aware of what they were signing because they were too young to understand and trusted their uncle to take care of them. A jury found in favor of George&#x27;s family.

A few weeks after the decision, George&#x27;s son Arthur S. Demoulas filed a second suit, this time alleging that Mike Demoulas had diverted assets from the jointly-owned family company, Demoulas Super Markets, to ones controlled by him and his children, including Market Basket. After an eighty-four-day bench trial, judge Maria Lopez found in favor of the plaintiffs. Lopez awarded George&#x27;s family about $206 million for dividends on stock that had been improperly diverted and 50.5% of the company. She also ordered that all of the assets of Market Basket and the other companies controlled by Mike Demoulas and his family be transferred to Demoulas Super Markets and that Mike Demoulas be removed as president of the company.

In early September 1990, six bugs were found at the headquarters of DeMoulas Super Markets. It was alleged that Arthur S. Demoulas had planted the bugs in order to listen to the legal strategy of the other side of the Demoulas family. Michael Kettenbach, the son-in law of Mike Demoulas, sued Arthur S. Demoulas, claiming that Demoulas had &quot;invaded his privacy rights by having listening devices planted at DSM headquarters.&quot; In 1994, a jury found in favor of Arthur S. Demoulas. However, a new trial was granted after a woman came forward with new evidence—a recording of her boyfriend admitting to bugging the office for Arthur S. Demoulas. The case was damaged though when the woman admitted to being a crack cocaine addict who received about $500,000 in housing and other expenses from the family of Mike Demoulas and the man on the tape testified that he had been lying during the recorded conversation. On August 4, 1997, Arthur S. Demoulas was again cleared of wiretapping charges by a federal jury.

In 1991, George Demoulas&#x27;s family sued Mike Demoulas, his son Arthur T. Demoulas, and DeMoulas Super Markets, Inc. chief financial officer D. Harold Sullivan, alleging that the three violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 by using their positions as the trustees of the company&#x27;s employee profit-sharing plan to make fiscally irresponsible real estate loans to friends and business associates. The United States Department of Labor filed a similar complaint six months later. On May 31, 1994, the Department of Labor announced that they had reached a settlement in which the trustees agreed to sell $22 million of the loans by July 11 or purchase them themselves as well as pay the plan $750,000 to make up for the dropped interest rates on the loans (unless the loan recipients paid the money instead). The trustees also agreed not to make any similar investments. The trustees admitted no wrongdoing in the case. Despite the heavy investment in risky real estate loans, the plan never posted a loss. In the civil case, Judge Rya W. Zobel ruled that the trustees&#x27; actions were &quot;wrong but not corrupt&quot; and that the settlement with the Department of Labor was &quot;an adequate remedy&quot;. Therefore, she denied the request to have them removed.

In 1997 the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upheld a lower court&#x27;s ruling that Arthur T. Demoulas had presented the DeMoulas Super Markets Board of Directors with “misleading, inaccurate, and materially incomplete” information in order to receive a rejection and keep his cousins from receiving any of the profits from Lee Drug, a pharmacy chain he started after the board rejected his proposal to start a pharmacy division of Market Basket.

In 1999, Mike Demoulas resigned as president due to a court order. He was succeeded by William Marsden.

===Presidency of Arthur T. Demoulas===
By 2002, Rafaele Evans, the widow of George&#x27;s son Evan, was voting with Arthur T. Demoulas due to her displeasure with her brother-in-law, Arthur S. Demoulas, after he attempted to gain control of the trust that controlled her daughter&#x27;s shares. This gave Arthur T. a majority vote on the board of directors. In 2008, Arthur T. Demoulas was named president and CEO of DeMoulas Super Markets, Inc. During his tenure as CEO, sales grew from $3 billion a year to $4 billion, and the number of employees grew from 14,000 to 25,000. During the same time, competitors Stop &amp; Shop and Shaw&#x27;s closed many of their stores due to financial troubles. Market Basket also faced new competition from Wegmans, which opened its first Massachusetts store in 2011. On the employee front, Arthur T. was known for his ability to remember his associates&#x27; names, birthdays, and milestones, attending many of their weddings and funerals, checking in on ill employees, and asking about the spouses and children of his workers. He was seen as a father figure by a number of his employees and compared to &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; protagonist George Bailey for his willingness to put people over profit.

Demoulas&#x27;s opponents criticized him for being &quot;openly defiant&quot; of the board of directors and having a &quot;dictatorial&quot; management style. In a 2010 memo to the Board of Directors, Arthur S. Demoulas accused Arthur T. Demoulas of &quot;plundering&quot; millions by paying millions in excessive real estate prices for new Market Basket store locations. One example cited in the memo alleged that Arthur T. had recommended that the company pay $20.9 million to purchase a property in Bourne, Massachusetts, owned by an entity in which he was a major investor. After the sale, Arthur S. had the property appraised by a Boston real estate executive, who valued the property at $9 million. He also accused Arthur T. of paying &quot;grossly excessive fees&quot; to Retail Development and Management Inc., a real estate firm owned by his brothers-in-law Michael Kettenbach and Joseph Pasquale that oversaw Market Basket&#x27;s real estate and helped it develop new stores. He and his attorneys argued that the 7.5% of the total development costs &quot;was far in excess&quot; of the prevailing market rate of 2% to 3%.

Arthur T. denied his cousin&#x27;s claim. He argued that Arthur S. trumped up the charges in order to take control of the company and pay himself and the other shareholders more money. Attorneys for Arthur T. noted that Cushman &amp; Wakefield later appraised the Bourne property at $25.5 million. Arthur T. also defended his arrangement with Kettenbach and Pasquale, which he said allowed Market Basket to purchase properties without alerting its competitors, thus avoiding a bidding war and saving the company money.

In 2011, the Board of Directors hired Mel L. Greenberg, a retired judge, to investigate Arthur S.&#x27;s claims. Greenberg found that there was no wrongdoing by Arthur T. in the purchase of real estate (including the Bourne property) that the fees paid to Retail Development and Management were not excessive. However, he did find that Arthur T. and the Board of Directors had neglected their fiduciary duties by not looking into whether or not the company would have been better off if it had exercised its option to purchase its store in Somersworth, New Hampshire instead of renting it from a company in which Arthur T. and his family owned a 55% stake.

===2014 firing of Arthur T. Demoulas and protests=== 
Decades of resentment and legal spats between cousins Arthur S. and Arthur T. Demoulas came to a head in mid-2013, when Evans switched loyalties, tipping the majority vote from Arthur T. to Arthur S. On July 18, 2013, the board did not take up a motion to remove Arthur T. as CEO after protesters gathered outside the meeting. Five days later, the board voted to distribute $250 million to family shareholders, an action opposed by Arthur T. In March 2014, two board members elected by Arthur T., William Shea and Terence Carleton, skipped a board meeting in which it was anticipated that there could be a vote to remove Arthur T. as CEO. Arthur S.&#x27;s side of the family sued Shea and Carelton, alleging they had boycotted the meeting. A Suffolk Superior Court judge ruled that Shea and Darman were required to attend the next meeting.

On June 23, 2014, three top-level executives—CEO Arthur T. Demoulas, Vice President Joseph Rockwell, and Director of Operations William Marsden—were fired by the board. The Chief Executive position was filled with James Gooch, a former Radio Shack executive, and Felicia Thornton, formerly of supermarket company Albertsons, sharing the position. In response, six high-level managers resigned, and 300 employees held a rally outside Market Basket&#x27;s Chelsea, Massachusetts flagship store on June 24.

Beginning on July 18, 2014, additional protests with as many as 5,000 employees and customers were held at the company&#x27;s Tewksbury headquarters and other locations demanding the reinstatement of Arthur T. Many supermarket, warehouse and corporate office workers including delivery truck drivers went on strike, leaving many shelves bare empty at many Market Basket locations. On July 20, seven employees were fired for their roles in organizing the protests. In the midst of the protests, Arthur T. offered to buy the entire company from his cousins, an offer that the board (controlled by Arthur S.&#x27;s family) said it would consider. The board was reportedly also reviewing additional offers.

On July 28, 2014, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported that Arthur T. Demoulas was the only remaining bidder for the 50.5% stake of the company held by the family of Arthur S. Demoulas. All previous offers by outside parties to buy the company had been withdrawn and the board was reportedly &quot;furiously negotiating&quot; with Arthur T. to resolve the situation. The board denied this report, claiming that several offers were still being considered.

On August 17, 2014, Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick and New Hampshire governor Maggie Hassan met with both sides of the feud in an attempt to broker a deal. On August 22, Arthur T. and his sisters made a $1.5 billion offer for the 50.5% of shares owned by the opposing side of the family; several subsequent days of negotiations initially failed to reach an accord. Some analysts estimated the company to be in &quot;dire&quot; financial straits due to the weeks of protests.

On August 27, 2014, the shareholders of Market Basket reached a deal to sell the remaining 50.5% shares of the company to Arthur T. Demoulas and his sisters for $1.5 billion. According to &quot;Fortune&quot;, Demoulas was backed by The Blackstone Group, a private equity firm that put up over $500 million towards the purchase price. However, according to the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, a source reported the deal was funded with debt, not private equity.

Felicia Thornton and Jim Gooch remained as the Chief Executives of the company but Arthur T. was given full operational authority until the deal closed. On December 12, 2014, it was announced that the deal was complete.

==Market Basket today==
As of January 2024, Market Basket operates 90 stores within four states - Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine and Rhode Island. The chain&#x27;s footprint encompasses an area radiating from the original stores in Lowell and stretching along the New England coastline from Cape Cod to southern Maine, to as far west as just shy of the Vermont state line and as far north as North Conway, New Hampshire. The first Maine location opened in Biddeford in August 2013, shortly before projects stalled between 2013 and 2014 due to the family disputes over company operations. After President Arthur T. Demoulas and his sisters gained control of the company in August 2014, Demoulas announced that he hoped to open two or three of the stalled stores by the end of the year. Within five years, Market Basket opened stores in Athol, Attleboro, Fall River, Littleton, Plymouth, Revere and Waltham, with Revere being the first to open following the protests, on October 26, 2014. The company continued expanding throughout New England, reaching 85 stores in 2021 along with their first two Rhode Island stores in Warwick and Johnston.

In their 2017 ratings, &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; ranked Market Basket at #2 among national supermarkets, second only to Wegmans. Employees who work more than 1,000 hours a year are eligible to enter a profit-sharing program. Employees also receive benefits, including healthcare and paid sick leave, and no employees belong to any trade union. Market Basket does not use supermarket loyalty cards, nor does it typically feature pharmacies within its stores. Further, Market Basket does not have self-checkout lanes. Company President Arthur T. Demoulas stated that he wanted &quot;a human being waiting on a human being&quot;. Until 2017, Market Basket did not have an official company website or any online presence. An independent website started by a customer filled the void and contained weekly specials and store locations and hours. On October 24, 2017, the company launched their first website as well as social media accounts on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

<doc id="811889" wikidata="Q4936970" url="?curid=811889" title="Body thetan">
<text>A body thetan or BT is a concept in Scientology of a disembodied thetan (being) that is stuck in, on, or near a human body. All human bodies are said to be infested by these disembodied thetans, or clusters of them.

Scientologists believe body thetans came about approximately 75 million years ago through a catastrophe brought on by a galactic dictator named Xenu, as described by L. Ron Hubbard in a confidential auditing (counseling level in Scientology) called OT III.

High-level Scientologists are told that body thetans are responsible for physical and mental ailments, and are told to telepathically exorcize them using Scientology auditing processes.

==Free will==
According to Hubbard, body thetans cling to a body because they have lost their free will as a result of events in their past. There are several Scientology auditing &quot;processes&quot; which are believed to help a body thetan restore free will. Upon reaching OT III, the individual finds body thetans by locating any sensation of pressure or mass in their body. This is addressed telepathically as a &quot;cluster,&quot; and taken through the cluster-making incident of 75 million years ago.

==Secrecy==
Often members of the Church of Scientology will publicly deny the existence of space opera doctrines, or attempt to minimize their importance. Because the secret information imparted to members is to be kept secret from others who have not attained that level, the member must publicly deny its existence when asked. OT III recipients must sign a waiver promising never to reveal its secrets before they are given the manila folder containing the body thetan knowledge.
It is supposedly knowledge so dangerous, as noted on the &quot;Ron&#x27;s Journal 67&quot; cassette, that anyone learning this material before they are ready could die, though no evidence of such a danger exists in the wake of the OT III leak.

Despite the church&#x27;s efforts to keep the story secret, details have been leaked over the years. OT III was first revealed in Robert Kaufman&#x27;s 1972 book &quot;Inside Scientology: Or How I Found Scientology and Became Super Human&quot;, in which Kaufman detailed his own experiences of OT III. It was later described in a 1981 Clearwater &quot;Sun&quot; article by Richard Leiby, and came to greater public fame in a 1985 court case brought against the church by Lawrence A. Wollersheim. The church attempted to keep the case file checked out by a reader at all times, but the story was synopsised in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; on November 5, 1985, and later detailed in William Poundstone&#x27;s &quot;Bigger Secrets&quot; (1986) from information presented in the Wollersheim case. Church lawyer Warren McShane later claimed the story had never been secret, although maintaining there were nevertheless trade secrets contained in OT III. Notably, McShane discussed the details of the Xenu/body thetans story at some length and specifically attributed the authorship of the story to Hubbard. Audio recordings exist of Hubbard lectures that discuss body thetans and other space opera subjects.

There is little real problem verifying information concerning Scientology practices at Clear and above despite all the materials being strictly confidential. While it is therefore sometimes necessary to resort to secondary sources such as court documents, leaked copies of the material and/or second-hand accounts from former members. While almost all of the leaked material seems to be credible and has been verified by ex-members, the possibility exists that while procedures and policies may have changed, the underlying theology from Hubbard will remain the same.

There is therefore credible evidence that such materials should not be disclosed by Scientologists, but there is currently no documentary evidence of policy requiring anyone to lie about the contents of the materials. Whilst there is ample video evidence of apparently devout members lying about the contents of the OT courses, there is uncertainty as to why they feel it is both necessary and ethical to do so.

<doc id="811890" wikidata="Q2826068" url="?curid=811890" title="Fourteen-segment display">
<text>A fourteen-segment display (FSD) (sometimes referred to as a starburst display or Union Jack display) is a type of display based on 14 segments that can be turned on or off to produce letters and numerals. It is an expansion of the more common seven-segment display, having an additional four diagonal and two vertical segments with the middle horizontal segment broken in half. A seven-segment display suffices for numerals and certain letters, but unambiguously rendering the ISO basic Latin alphabet requires more detail. A slight variation is the sixteen-segment display which allows additional legibility in displaying letters or other symbols.

A decimal point or comma may be present as an additional segment, or pair of segments; the comma (used for triple-digit groupings or as a decimal separator in many regions) is commonly formed by combining the decimal point with a closely &#x27;attached&#x27; leftwards-descending arc-shaped segment.

Electronic alphanumeric displays may use LEDs, LCDs, or vacuum fluorescent display devices. The LED variant is typically manufactured in single or dual character packages, allowing the system designer to choose the number of characters suiting the application.

Often a character generator is used to translate 7-bit ASCII character codes to the 14 bits that indicate which of the 14 segments to turn on or off.

== Character encoding ==

By lighting different elements, different characters can be displayed.

In a 14-segment display, there is also an optional 15th segment which is a decimal point (denoted as &quot;DP&quot;).

=== Decimal ===
=== Latin alphabet ===

A 14-segment display is mostly used to display text because the 14 elements allow all Latin letters to be displayed both in upper case and lower case (with a few exceptions like &quot;s&quot;).

==Applications==
Multiple-segment display devices use fewer elements than a full dot-matrix display, and may produce a better character appearance where the segments are shaped appropriately. This can reduce power consumption and the number of driver components.

Fourteen-segment gas-plasma displays were used in pinball machines from 1986 through 1991 with an additional comma and period part making for a total of 16 segments.

Fourteen and sixteen-segment displays were used to produce alphanumeric characters on calculators and other embedded systems. Applications today include displays fitted to telephone Caller ID units, gymnasium equipment, VCRs, car stereos, microwave ovens, slot machines, and DVD players.

Such displays were very common on pinball machines for displaying the score and other information, before the widespread use of dot-matrix display panels.

===Incandescent lamp===
Multiple segment alphanumeric displays are nearly as old as the use of electricity. A 1908 textbook describes an alphanumeric display system using incandescent lamps and a mechanical switching arrangement. Each of 21 lamps was connected to a switch operated by a set of slotted bars, installed in a rotating drum. This &quot;commutator&quot; assembly could be arranged so that as the drum was rotated, different sets of switches were closed and different letters and figures could be displayed. The scheme would have been used for &quot;talking&quot; signs to spell out messages, but a complete set of commutator switches, drums and lamps would have been required for each letter of a message, making the resulting sign quite expensive.

===Cold-cathode neon===
A few different versions of the fourteen segment display exist as cold-cathode neon lamps. For example, one type made by Burroughs Corporation was called &quot;Panaplex&quot;. Instead of using a filament as the incandescent versions do, these use a cathode charged to a 180 V potential which causes the electrified segment to glow a bright orange color. They operated similarly to Nixie tubes but instead of the full-formed numeric shapes, used segments to make up numerals and letters.

<text>The Royal Air Force Regiment (RAF Regiment) is part of the Royal Air Force and functions as a specialist corps. Founded by Royal Warrant in 1942, the Corps carries-out security tasks relating to the protection of assets and personnel dedicated to the delivery of air power.

RAF Regiment &#x27;Gunners&#x27; are personnel trained in various disciplines such as infantry tactics, force protection, field craft, sniper, support to special forces operations, CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear) defence, equipped with advanced vehicles and detection measures. RAF Regiment instructors are responsible for training all Royal Air Force personnel in basic force protection such as first aid, weapon handling and CBRN skills. 

The regiment and its members are known within the RAF as &quot;The Regiment&quot;, &quot;Rock Apes&quot; or &quot;Rocks&quot;.

==History==
===Formation===
The genesis of the RAF Regiment was the creation of No. 1 Armoured Car Company RAF, formed in Egypt in 1921 for operations in Iraq, followed shortly afterwards by No. 2 Armoured Car Company RAF and No. 3 Armoured Car Company RAF. These were equipped with Rolls-Royce armoured cars and carried out policing operations throughout the Middle East in the 1920s.

===Second World War===

In 1941 during the Second World War German airborne forces invaded Crete, then held by Greek, British and Commonwealth forces. The German invasion succeeded in major part because of the failure of the Allied land forces to recognise the strategic importance of the airfields, and hence to defend them adequately. In consequence the RAF base at Maleme was taken largely intact by German paratroop and glider forces, albeit with heavy casualties. The Germans were then reinforced by air behind allied lines. This led eventually to the loss of the whole island and substantial Allied losses in what became known as the Battle of Crete.

Disappointed with the failure of the British Army to recognise the importance of airfields in modern warfare, Prime Minister Churchill made the RAF responsible for the defence of its own bases and the RAF Regiment was formed on 1 February 1942, with its first headquarters established at RAF Belton Park, Grantham, Lincolnshire. From the start it had 66,000 personnel drawn from the former Defence Squadrons Nos. 701–850. The new regiment was made up of field squadrons equipped with Morris Light Reconnaissance Cars, Humber Light Reconnaissance Cars and Otter Light Reconnaissance Cars. The light anti-aircraft squadrons were originally armed with Hispano 20 mm cannon and then the Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft gun. Its role was to seize, secure and defend airfields to enable air operations to take place. Several parachute squadrons were formed to assist in the capture of airfields, a capability retained by No. II Squadron. It mounted the King&#x27;s Guard at Buckingham Palace for the first time on 1 April 1943. During the War the RAF Regiment grew to a force of over 80,000 men.

In late June 1944, with the British Army fighting in Normandy where it was sustaining heavy losses and at the same time suffering from a severe shortage of manpower, it was decided to transfer 25,000 officers and men of the RAF Regiment to the army, mostly to the infantry and the Foot Guards, to be retrained.

The Second World War campaign in north-eastern India and northern Burma was fought in jungle and mountains with few or non-existent roads and which facilitated the infiltration of enemy patrols behind front lines. This was overcome by holding defensive &quot;boxes&quot; mainly or entirely supplied by air. The defence of forward airfields close to the main army concentrations was vital to this tactic. A training school and depot for the RAF Regiment was established at Secunderabad in October 1942, to retrain former ground defence airmen. It had an assault course considered tougher than anything the army had in India. Six field squadrons and seventy AA flights were initially formed, containing 160 officers and 4,000 other ranks. Until mid-1944 the AA flights were equipped only with light machine guns, then with Hispano 20 mm cannon for the rest of the war. Regiment units defended airfields and forward mobile radar units in Arakan in the Arakan Campaign in late 1942 and early 1943.

During the Battle of Imphal all supplies and reinforcements had to be flown in between 29 March and 22 June 1944 with RAF Regiment units providing vital airfield defence. Following the failure of the Japanese Operation U-Go it was decided to pursue the shattered remnants of the Japanese 15th Army into Burma during the monsoon, in average rainfall of per day and rifle flights were sometimes attached to advancing Indian Army and British East African units, to gain experience in the jungle. Units of 1307 Wing were flown into the newly captured and tactically vital Meiktila airfield on 1 March 1945. Only a roughly box, shared with the army and some United States anti-aircraft artillery, could be held at night and the airfield had to be cleared of enemy each morning before flying could start. As one of the RAF Regiment&#x27;s proudest battle honours, this three-week battle destroyed the Japanese hold on northern Burma.

The RAF Regiment fought as field, armoured car and light anti-aircraft (LAA) squadrons and flights in North Africa, the Middle East, Italy, the Balkans and North Western Europe, as well as 68 LAA squadrons defending the UK against V1 attacks as part of Operation Diver, alongside the Royal Artillery&#x27;s heavy anti-aircraft and LAA batteries. Amongst other things, RAF Regiment units were the first British forces to reach Paris, amongst the first to enter Brussels, and Squadron Leader Mark Hobden and his force arrested Hitler&#x27;s successor as Fuhrer, Grand Admiral Karl Doenitz, at his HQ in Flensburg.

On 26 November 1944, a Me 262A-2a Sturmvogel of III/KG51 based at Hopsten/Rheine near Osnabruck was the first confirmed ground-to-air kill of a jet combat aircraft. The 262 was shot down by a 40/L60 40mm Bofors gun of B.11 Detachment of 2875 Squadron RAF Regiment, at the RAF forward airfield of Helmond, near Eindhoven. Others were lost to ground fire on 17 and 18 December when the same airfield was attacked at intervals by a total of eighteen Me 262s and the guns of Nos. 2873 and 2875 squadrons RAF Regiment damaged several, causing at least two of them to crash within a few miles of the airfield. In February 1945, Sergeant Pollards&#x27;s B.6 gun detachment of 2809 Squadron RAF Regiment shot down another Me 262 over the airfield of Volkel. The final appearance of Me 262s over Volkel was in 1945, when yet another fell to 2809&#x27;s guns.
On 5 December 1944, twelve RAF Regiment squadrons deployed onto various airfields in southern Greece. They became engaged in fighting with Greek Communist Forces (ELAS) which wished to depose the Greek government at that time. No. 2848 Field Squadron was the first RAF unit to arrive in West Berlin in 1945 to secure Luftwaffe Flugplatz Gatow.

===Post-war===
King George VI became Air Commodore-in-Chief of the regiment in 1947. He later decided to present his king&#x27;s colour in 1952, on the 10th anniversary of the RAF Regiment&#x27;s founding. The king, however, died around this time and Queen Elizabeth II instead presented the Queen&#x27;s Colour a year later.
The unilateral declaration of independence by Rhodesia in November 1965 necessitated support to Zambia, which desperately needed air defence. In a rapid response, Javelin fighters were deployed and an RAF Regiment squadron was also deployed from the United Kingdom to provide ground defence. The agility of the Regiment was demonstrated in its ability to embark 51 Squadron RAF Regiment in six hours from the call to deploy. At the eastern end of the Empire, flights from RAF Regiment squadrons based in Singapore deployed to Hong Kong in 1968 to help maintain security and confidence. The RAF Regiment continued to be involved in Hong Kong into the mid-1970s providing protection at both RAF Kai Tak and at the radar station at Tai Mo Shan.

In 1974, the Rapier surface-to-air missile system entered service with the RAF Regiment, and equipped four squadrons protecting four RAF airfields in Germany. Detachments from the German Rapier Squadrons, particularly from RAF Gutersloh, deployed to San Carlos beach-head during the Falklands conflict to provide anti-aircraft cover.

Light armoured squadrons, equipped with FV101 Scorpion and FV107 Scimitar light tracked vehicles continued to be operated into the 1980s. Also from the 1980s units such as 19 Squadron were equipped with Rapier and tasked with defending USAF airbases such as RAF Upper Heyford.

Four RAF Regiment personnel were killed by the IRA, all in 1988 and 1989 - one killed by hostile fire in Northern Ireland, the rest by snipers or car bombs in Europe.

In July 2004 it was announced that the role of providing ground-based air defence was to be transferred to the British Army&#x27;s Royal Artillery and the four Royal Air Force Regiment air defence squadrons were to be disbanded.

The RAF Regiment saw action in Iraq and Afghanistan. Leaving aside those injured, seriously or otherwise, five RAF Regiment gunners were killed in Iraq (one in a firefight, three, including a member of the RAuxAF, in a single mortar strike, and one in a road traffic incident) and five were killed in Afghanistan (one due to hostile fire, four due to IEDs, including one 51 year old member of the RAuxAF, the oldest member of the British Armed Forces to die in Afghanistan) with an additional man dying in an accident in Cyprus after leaving Afghanistan.

In 2011, as part of the Strategic Defence and Security Review, it was announced that from December 2011, the CBRN role undertaken by the Joint CBRN Regiment, a combined Army/RAF unit, would be transferred to the RAF Regiment (as lead service) under the new Defence CBRN Wing, formed from 26 Squadron, 27 Squadron and 2623 (Auxiliary) Squadron. The army retained involvement through the continued use of the Royal Yeomanry to provide trained battlefield casualty replacements.

In 2016, this decision was reversed with the announcement the CBRN role would be handed back to the British Army in 2020.

In November 2013, The Queen&#x27;s Colour (63), 1 and 27 Squadron had their new colours presented. However 16, 37 and 48 squadrons were disbanded.

In July 2017, Prince Harry visited RAF Honington on behalf of The Queen to present a new Colour to the RAF Regiment. The new colour was to celebrate the 75th birthday of the formation of the Regiment in 1942.

==Organisation and role==
The RAF Regiment is the RAF’s organic defensive security force and comes under command of 2 Group, Air Command. Its members are organised into seven regular squadrons, - Nos 1, 2, 15, 27, 34, 51 and 63/King&#x27;s Colour Squadron - of which six are field squadrons and 27 is the specialist CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear) units under the umbrella of the defence CBRN Wing (No 20 Wing RAF Regiment -see note below), plus six Royal Auxiliary Air Force (RAuxAF) Regiment (RAuxAF Regt) squadrons. The Corps carries out basic security tasks relating to the [protection of] delivery of air power. Examples of such tasks are non-combatant evacuation operation (NEO), recovery of downed aircrew (joint personnel recovery – JPR), defence of airfields by way of aggressively patrolling and actively seeking out infiltrators in a large area surrounding airfields. The key tenet of the RAF Regiments role is based around defensive security operations, rather than the Army’s more traditional offensive infantry role, which is to close with and kill the enemy; notwithstanding, this does require active patrolling just outside the Airfield perimeter. In addition the RAF Regiment provides Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTACs) to the British Army in the Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) role, and provides a very small (flight size) commitment to the Special Forces Support Group as Tactical air controllers and some CBRN specialists.

The field squadrons are 171 strong making them larger than an infantry company in the British Army but, critically, due to the nature of their structure and establishment for defensive security operations, a key limitation is that they are only able to operate up to Company/Squadron level and so cannot bring the same &#x27;Mass&#x27; to bear of an Line Infantry Regiment. Not all personnel on an RAF Regiment squadron are trained gunners but can be involved in specialist support services such as administrators and drivers. A typical RAF Regiment squadron has support elements from the RAF but these personnel do not always deploy on patrols and other combat operations. Formerly, all RAF Regiment personnel were men, as it was British government policy that women could not serve in close combat units. However, the intention was that by the end of 2018, women would be allowed to apply for these roles, with the RAF recruitment website &#x27;looking forward&#x27; to female applications for the RAF Regiment. A review in 2017 determined that, although the Regiment was deemed to be the Royal Air Force&#x27;s version of infantry, it was more alike to the Royal Armoured Corps in terms of risk, due to its defensive security force mission. As a result, women will be allowed into the RAF Regiment from September 2017, which was a full year before infantry units. In January 2020, the first female recruit to complete the 20-week training course passed out of RAF Honington.

, there are approximately 1,850 regulars.

In March 2021, it was announced that the regular force is expected to be reduced by 300 personnel by 2023.

==Origin of the &quot;Rock Ape&quot; nickname==
In the past the nickname &quot;Rock Ape&quot; has been attributed to their traditional role guarding areas of Gibraltar, but this is not so. The term came into use after an accident in the Western Aden Protectorate in November 1952. Two RAF Regiment officers serving with the Aden Protectorate Levies at Dhala decided to amuse themselves by going out to shoot some of the hamadryas baboons (locally referred to as &quot;rock apes&quot;). The officers drew rifles and split up to hunt the apes. In the semi-darkness one of the officers fired at a moving object in the distance. When he reached the target he discovered he had shot the other officer. After emergency treatment Flight Lieutenant Percy Henry Mason survived to return to service a few months later. When asked by a board of inquiry why he had fired at his friend the officer replied that his target had &quot;looked just like a rock ape&quot; in the half light. The remark soon reverberated around the RAF and it was not long before the term was in general use.

==Notable former members==
* British comedian Tony Hancock joined the RAF Regiment in 1942.
* British football manager Brian Clough served with the RAF Regiment during his national service.
* British actor Brian Blessed served with 2 Squadron, RAF Regiment as a parachutist during his national service.
