<text>Stepan Andriyovych Bandera (, ; ; 1 January 1909 – 15 October 1959) was a Ukrainian far-right leader of the radical militant wing of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, the OUN-B.

Bandera was born in Austria-Hungary, in Galicia, into the family of a priest of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, and grew up in Poland. Involved in nationalist organizations from a young age, he joined the Ukrainian Military Organization in 1924. In 1931, he became head of propaganda of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), and later became head of the OUN for Poland in 1932. In 1934, he organized the assassination of the Polish interior minister, Bronisław Pieracki, and was sentenced to death after being convicted of terrorism, subsequently commuted to life imprisonment.

Bandera was freed from prison in 1939 following the invasion of Poland, and moved to Kraków. In 1940, he became head of the radical faction of the OUN, the OUN-B. On 22 June 1941, the same day as Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, he formed the Ukrainian National Committee. The head of the Committee, Yaroslav Stetsko, announced the creation of a Ukrainian state on 30 June 1941, in German-captured Lviv. The proclamation pledged to work with Nazi Germany. The Germans disapproved of the proclamation, and for his refusal to rescind the decree, Bandera was arrested by the Gestapo. He was released in September 1944 by the Germans in hope that he could fight the Soviet advance. Bandera negotiated with the Nazis to create the Ukrainian National Army and the Ukrainian National Committee in March 1945. After the war, Bandera settled with his family in West Germany. In 1959, Bandera was assassinated by a KGB agent in Munich.

Bandera remains a highly controversial figure in Ukraine. Many Ukrainians hail him as an example, or as a martyred liberation fighter, while other Ukrainians, particularly in the south and east, condemn him as a fascist, or Nazi collaborator, whose followers, called Banderites, were responsible for massacres of Polish and Jewish civilians during World War II. On 22 January 2010, Viktor Yushchenko, the president of Ukraine, awarded Bandera the posthumous title of Hero of Ukraine, which was widely condemned. The award was annulled in 2011 given that Stepan Bandera was never a Ukrainian citizen. The controversy regarding Bandera&#x27;s legacy gained further prominence following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===

Stepan Andriyovych Bandera was born on 1 January 1909 in Staryi Uhryniv, in the region of Galicia in Austria-Hungary, to Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church priest Andriy Bandera (1882–1941) and Myroslava Głodzińska (1890–1921). Bandera had seven siblings, three sisters and four brothers. Bandera&#x27;s younger brothers included Oleksandr, who earned a doctorate in political economy at the University of Rome, and Vasyl, who finished a degree in philosophy at the University of Lviv.

Bandera grew up in a patriotic and religious household. He did not attend primary school due to World War I and was taught at home by his parents. At a young age, Bandera was undersized and slim. He sang in a choir, played guitar and mandolin, enjoyed hiking, jogging, swimming, ice skating, basketball and chess.
After the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in the wake of World War I, Eastern Galicia briefly became part of the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic. Bandera&#x27;s father, who joined the Ukrainian Galician Army as a chaplain, was active in the nationalist movement preceding the Polish–Ukrainian War, which was fought between November 1918 to July 1919 and ended with Ukrainian defeat and incorporation of Eastern Galicia into Poland.

Mykola Mikhnovsky&#x27;s 1900 publication, &quot;Independent Ukraine&quot;, influenced Bandera greatly. After graduating from a Ukrainian high school in Stryi in 1927, where he was engaged in a number of youth organizations, Bandera planned to attend the Husbandry Academy in Czechoslovakia, but he either did not get a passport or the Academy notified him that it was closed. In 1928, Bandera enrolled in the agronomy program at the Politechnika Lwowska in its branch in Dubliany, but never completed his studies due to his political activities and arrests.

=== Early activities ===

Bandera associated himself with a variety of Ukrainian organizations during his time in high school, particularly Plast, Sokil, and Organization of the Upper Grades of the Ukrainian High Schools (OVKUH). In 1927 Bandera joined Ukrainian Military Organization (UVO). In February 1929 he joined Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN). Bandera was drawn into national activity by , one of the leaders of the Ukrainian youth movement.

During his studies, he devoted his efforts to underground and nationalist activities, for which he was arrested several times. The first time was on 14 November 1928, for illegally celebrating the 10th anniversary of the ZUNR; in 1930 with his brother Andrii; and in 1932-33 as many as six times. Between March and June 1932, he spent three months in prison in connection with the investigation of the assassination of by .

In the early 1930s, in response to attacks perpetrated by Ukrainian nationalists, Polish authorities carried out the pacification of Ukrainians in Eastern Galicia against the Ukrainian minority. This resulted in destroyed property and mass detentions, and took place in southeastern voivodeships of the Second Polish Republic.

===Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists===
Bandera joined OUN in 1929, and quickly climbed through the ranks, thanks to the support of Okhrymovych, becoming in 1930 the head of a section distributing OUN propaganda in Eastern Galicia. A year later, he became director of propaganda for the whole OUN. After Okhrymovych&#x27;s death and the flight from Poland of his successor Ivan Habrusevych in 1931, he became the leading candidate to become head of the homeland executive. But due to the fact that he was in detention at the time, he was unable to assume this function, and upon his release he became deputy to Bohdan Kordiuk, who assumed this function. After the failure of the , Kordiuk had to step down and Bandera took over de facto his function, which was sanctioned at a conference in Berlin on 3–6 June 1933.

On 29 August 1931, Polish politician Tadeusz Hołówko was assassinated by two members of the OUN Vasyl Bilas and Dmytro Danylyshyn. Both were sentenced to death. Bandera-led OUN propaganda made them martyrs and ordered Ukrainian priests in Lviv and elsewhere to ring bells on the day of their execution.

Since 1932 Bandera was assistant chief of OUN and around that time controlled several &quot;warrior units&quot; in Poland in places such as the Free City of Danzig (Wolne Miasto Gdańsk), Drohobycz, Lwów, Stanisławów, Brzezany, and Truskawiec. Bandera collaborated closely with Richard Yary, who would later side with Bandera and help him form OUN-B.

On Bandera&#x27;s orders OUN began a campaign of terrorist acts, such as attacks on post-offices, bomb-throwing at Polish exhibitions and murders of policemen to mass campaigns against Polish tobacco and alcohol monopolies and against the denationalization of Ukrainian youth. In 1934 Bandera was arrested in Lwów and tried twice: first, concerning involvement in a plot to assassinate the minister of internal affairs, Bronisław Pieracki, and second at a general trial of OUN executives. He was convicted of terrorism and sentenced to death. The death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.
After the trials, Bandera became renowned and admired among Ukrainians in Poland as a symbol of a revolutionary who fought for Ukrainian independence. While in prison Bandera was &quot;to some extent detached from OUN discourses&quot; but not completely isolated from the global political debates of the late 1930s thanks to Ukrainian and other newspaper subscriptions delivered to his cell.

=== World War II ===
Before World War II the territory of today&#x27;s Ukraine was split between Poland, the Soviet Union, Romania and Czechoslovakia. Prior to the 1939 invasion of Poland, German military intelligence recruited OUN members into the Bergbauernhilfe unit and smuggled Ukrainian nationalists into Poland in order to erode Polish defences by conducting a terror campaign directed at Polish farmers and Jews. OUN leaders Andriy Melnyk (code name Consul I) and Bandera (code name Consul II) both served as agents of the Nazi Germany military intelligence Abwehr Second Department. Their goal was to run diversion activities after Germany&#x27;s attack on the Soviet Union. This information is part of the testimony that Abwehr Colonel Erwin Stolze gave on 25 December 1945 and submitted to the Nuremberg trials, with a request to be admitted as evidence.

Bandera was freed from Brest (Brześć) Prison in Eastern Poland in early September 1939, as a result of the invasion of Poland. There are differing accounts of the circumstances of his release. Soon thereafter Eastern Poland was occupied by the Soviet Union. Upon release from prison, Bandera moved first to Lviv, but after realising it would be occupied by the Soviets, Bandera together with other OUN members, moved to Kraków, the capital of Germany&#x27;s occupational General Government. where, according to Tadeusz Piotrowski, he established close connections with the German Abwehr and Wehrmacht. There, he also came in contact with the leader of the OUN, Andriy Atanasovych Melnyk. In 1940, the political differences and expectations between the two leaders caused the OUN to split into two factions, OUN-B and OUN-M (Banderites and Melnykites) each one claiming legitimacy.

The factions differed in ideology, strategy and tactics: the OUN-M faction led by Melnyk preached a more conservative approach to nation-building, while the OUN-B faction, led by Bandera, supported a revolutionary approach; however, both factions exhibited similar levels of radical nationalism, fascism, antisemitism, xenophobia and violence. The vast majority of young OUN members joined Bandera&#x27;s faction. OUN-B was devoted to the independence of Ukraine, as a single-party fascist totalitarian state free of national minorities. It was later implicated in the Holocaust.

Before the independence proclamation of 30 June 1941, Bandera oversaw the formation of so-called &quot;Mobile Groups&quot; (), which were small (5–15 members) groups of OUN-B members who would travel from General Government to Western Ukraine and, after a German advance to Eastern Ukraine, encourage support for the OUN-B and establish local authorities run by OUN-B activists. In total, approximately 7,000 people participated in these mobile groups, and they found followers among a wide circle of intellectuals, such as Ivan Bahriany, Vasyl Barka, Hryhorii Vashchenko and many others.

In spring 1941, Bandera held meetings with the heads of Germany&#x27;s intelligence, regarding the formation of &quot;Nachtigall&quot; and &quot;Roland&quot; Battalions. In the spring of that year, the OUN received 2.5 million marks for subversive activities inside the Soviet Union. Gestapo and Abwehr officials protected Bandera&#x27;s followers, as both organizations intended to use them for their own purposes.

On 30 June 1941, with the arrival of Nazi troops in Ukraine, the OUN-B unilaterally declared an independent Ukrainian state (&quot;Act of Renewal of Ukrainian Statehood&quot;). The proclamation pledged a cooperation of the new Ukrainian state with Nazi Germany under the leadership of Hitler. The declaration was accompanied by violent pogroms. There is no evidence that Bandera actively supported or participated in the Lviv pogroms or acts of violence against Jewish and Polish civilians, but he was well informed about the violence and was &quot;unable or unwilling to instruct Ukrainian nationalist military troops (as Nachtigall, Roland and UPA) to protect vulnerable minorities under their control&quot;. As German historian Olaf Glöckner writes, Bandera &quot;failed to manage this problem (ethnic and anti-Semitic hatred) inside his forces, just like Symon Petljura failed 25 years before him.&quot;

OUN(b) leaders&#x27; expectation that the Nazi regime would post-factum recognize an independent fascist Ukraine as an Axis ally proved to be wrong. German authorities requested the declaration be withdrawn, Stetsko and Bandera refused. The Germans barred Bandera from moving to newly conquered Lviv, limiting his residency to occupied Kraków. On 5 July, Bandera was brought to Berlin, where he was placed in honorable captivity. On 12 July, the prime minister of the newly formed Ukrainian National Government, Yaroslav Stetsko, was arrested and taken to Berlin. Although released from custody on 14 July, both were required to stay in Berlin. Bandera was free to move around the city, but could not leave it. The Germans closed OUN-B offices in Berlin and Vienna, and on 15 September 1941 Bandera and leading OUN members were arrested by the Gestapo.

By the end of 1941 relations between Nazi Germany and the OUN-B had soured to the point where a Nazi document dated 25 November 1941 stated that &quot;the Bandera Movement is preparing a revolt in the which has as its ultimate aim the establishment of an independent Ukraine. All functionaries of the Bandera Movement must be arrested at once and, after thorough interrogation, are to be liquidated&quot;. 

In January 1942, Bandera was transferred to Sachsenhausen concentration camp&#x27;s special prison cell building () for high-profile political prisoners such as Horia Sima, the chancellor of Austria, Kurt Schuschnigg or Stefan Grot-Rowecki and high risk escapees. Bandera was not completely cut off from the outside world; his wife visited him regularly and was able to help him keep in touch with his followers. In April 1944, Bandera and his deputy Yaroslav Stetsko were approached by a Reich Security Main Office official to discuss plans for diversions and sabotage against the Soviet Army. 

Bandera&#x27;s release was preceded by lengthy talks between the Germans and the UPA in Galicia and Volhynia. Local talks and agreements took place as early as the end of 1943, talks at the central level of the OUN-B began in March 1944 and ended with the conclusion of an informal agreement in August or September 1944. The talks from the OUN-B Provid side were led mainly by Ivan Hrynokh. Meanwhile, in July 1944, the formation of the Ukrainian Supreme Liberation Council (UHVR) took place, which was intended as a supra-party organization that constituted the civilian body overseeing the UPA and was intended as the supreme authority in Ukraine. In reality, only members or sympathizers of the OUN-B took part in its formation. became president of the UHVR, but real power rested in the hands of the General Secretariat, headed by Roman Shukhevych. At the congress, decisions were made to stop any open collaboration with the Germans, creating a government alongside them was excluded, only taking supplies from them was considered. It was planned to carry out partisan fighting in the rear of the approaching Soviet army. A decision was also taken to move away from radically nationalist rhetoric towards greater democratisation. A UHVR foreign mission led by Mykola Lebed was sent to establish contact with Western governments.

On 28 September 1944, Bandera was released by the German authorities and moved to house arrest. Shortly after, the Germans released some 300 OUN members, including Stetsko and Melnyk. The release of OUN members was one of the few successes of Lebed&#x27;s mission on behalf of the UHVR, which failed to establish contacts with the Western Allies. Bandera reacted negatively to the changes taking place within the OUN-B in Ukraine. His opposition was provoked by the &#x27;democratisation&#x27; of the OUN-B and, above all, the relegation of the former leadership of the organisation to purely symbolic roles. On 5 October 1944, SS-Obergruppenführer Gottlob Berger met with Bandera and offered him the opportunity to join Andrey Vlasov and his Russian Liberation Army, which Bandera rejected. In December 1944, the Abwehr moved Bandera and Stetsko to Kraków in order to prepare the Ukrainian unit to be parachuted to the rear of the Soviet army. From there they sent Yurii Lopatynskyi as a courier to Shukhevych. Bandera informed him that he was ready to return to Ukraine, while Stetsko informed him that he still considered himself the Ukrainian prime minister.

Lopatynskyi arrived to Shukhevych in early January 1945. At a meeting of the Provid on 5 and 6 February 1945, it was decided that Bandera&#x27;s return to Ukraine was pointless, and that it might be more beneficial for him to remain in the West, where, as a former Nazi prisoner, he could organize support of international opinion. Bandera was re-elected as leader of the whole OUN. Roman Shukhevych resigned as the leader of the OUN and became the leader of OUN in Ukraine and Bandera&#x27;s deputy. The leaders of the OUN in Ukraine also came to the conclusion that the German-Soviet war would soon end in a Soviet victory, and a decision was made to continue the fight against the Soviets with smaller units, in order to maintain the will to fight among the population. It was also decided to hold talks with the Polish underground to conclude an anti-Soviet alliance. At that point the cooperation with Germans basically ceased with the loss of direct contact and the front moving further west.

In January, Bandera was in Lehnin, west of Berlin. Later he went to Weimar, where he took part in the formation of the Ukrainian National Committee (UNK) as one of the leaders alongside Pavlo Shandruk, Volodymyr Kubijovyč, Andriy Melnyk, Oleksandr Semenko and Pavlo Skoropadsky. In March, the UNK appointed Shandrukh as commander of the newly formed Ukrainian National Army (UNA), which was to fight the Soviets alongside the Germans; the Waffen-SS Galizien division was incorporated. Bandera later denied in conversations with the CIA that he had been involved in the formation of these organisations or any collaboration with Germany after his release. In February 1945, at a conference of the OUN-B in Vienna, Bandera was made the leader of the Foreign Units of the OUN (ZCh OUN). It was there that he openly criticised for the first time the changes that had taken place in the OUN-B in Ukraine. With the Red Army approaching, Bandera left Vienna and travelled to Innsbruck via Prague.

=== Postwar activity ===

After the war, Bandera and his family moved several times around West Germany, staying close to and in Munich, where Bandera organized the ZCh OUN center. He used false identification documents that helped him to conceal his past relationship with the Nazis. On 16 April 1946, the Yaroslav Stetsko-led Anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations was founded, with which Bandera also collaborated. The ZCh OUN quickly became the largest organisation in the approximately 110,000-strong Ukrainian diaspora in Germany, with 5,000 members. Part of the organisation was the SB security service, headed by Myron Matviyenko. The OUN-M was three times smaller. The foreign representation of the UHVR (ZP UHVR), led by Mykola Lebed, operated separately from the ZCh OUN, but many of its members belonged to both organizations.

As early as 1945, ZCh had established contacts with Western intelligence; from 1948 onwards, it was permanent cooperation with British intelligence, which helped to transfer couriers to Ukraine in return for receiving intelligence data. ZP UHVR, collaborated with the US intelligence. A September 1945 report by the US Office of Strategic Services said that Bandera had &quot;earned a fierce reputation for conducting a &#x27;reign of terror&#x27; during World War II&quot;. Bandera was protected by the US-backed Gehlen Organization but he also received help from underground organizations of former Nazis who helped Bandera to cross borders between Allied occupation zones.

In 1946, agents of the US Army intelligence agency Counterintelligence Corps (CIC) and NKVD entered into extradition negotiations based on the intra-Allied cooperation wartime agreement made at the Yalta Conference. The CIC wanted Frederick Wilhelm Kaltenbach, who would turn out to be deceased, and in return the Soviet Union proposed Bandera. Bandera and many Ukrainian nationalists had ended up in the American zone after the war. The Soviet Union regarded all Ukrainians as Soviet citizens and demanded their repatriation under the intra-Alied agreement. The US thought Bandera was too valuable to give up due to his knowledge of the Soviet Union, so the US started blocking his extradition under an operation called &quot;Anyface&quot;. From the perspective of the US, the Soviet Union and Poland were issuing extradition attempts of these Ukrainians to prevent the US from getting sources of intelligence, so this became one of the factors in the breakdown of the cooperation agreement. However, the CIC still considered Bandera untrustworthy and were concerned about the impact of his activities on Soviet-American relations, and in mid-1947 conducted an extensive and aggressive search to locate him. It failed, having described their quarry as &quot;extremely dangerous&quot; and &quot;constantly en route, frequently in disguise&quot;. Some American intelligence reported that he even was guarded by former SS men.

The Bavarian state government initiated a crackdown on Bandera&#x27;s organization for crimes such as counterfeiting and kidnapping. Gerhard von Mende, a West German government official, provided protection to Bandera who in turn provided him with political reports, which were relayed to the West German Foreign Office. Bandera reached an agreement with the BND, offering them his service, despite the CIA warning the West Germans against cooperating with him. 

Following the war Bandera also visited Ukrainian communities in Canada, Austria, Italy, Spain, Belgium, UK and Holland.

== Death ==

The MGB, and from 1954, the Soviet KGB, had attempted to kidnap or assassinate Bandera multiple times. On 15 October 1959, Bandera collapsed outside of Kreittmayrstrasse 7 in Munich and died shortly thereafter. A medical examination established that the cause of his death was poisoning by cyanide gas. On 20 October 1959, Bandera was buried in the Waldfriedhof () in Munich. His wife and three children moved to Toronto, Canada.

Two years after his death, on 17 November 1961, the German judicial bodies announced that Bandera&#x27;s murderer had been a KGB agent named Bohdan Stashynsky who used a cyanide dust spraying gun to murder Bandera acting on the orders of Soviet KGB head Alexander Shelepin and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev. After a detailed investigation against Stashynsky, who by then had defected from the KGB and confessed the killing, a trial took place from 8 to 15 October 1962. Stashynsky was convicted, and on 19 October he was sentenced to eight years in prison; he was released after four years.

Stashynsky had earlier assassinated Bandera&#x27;s associate Lev Rebet by similar means.

==Family==
Bandera&#x27;s brothers, Oleksandr and Vasyl, were arrested by the Germans and sent to Auschwitz concentration camp where they were allegedly killed by Polish inmates in 1942.

His father Andriy was arrested by the Soviets in late May 1941 for harboring an OUN member and transferred to Kyiv. On 8 July he was sentenced to death and executed on the 10th. His sisters Oksana and Marta–Maria were arrested by the NKVD in 1941 and sent to a gulag in Siberia. Both were released in 1960 without the right to return to Ukraine. Marta–Maria died in Siberia in 1982, and Oksana returned to Ukraine in 1989 where she died in 2004. Another sister, Volodymyra, was sentenced to a term in Soviet labor camps from 1946 to 1956. She returned to Ukraine in 1956.

==Views==
According to historian Grzegorz Rossoliński-Liebe, &quot;Bandera&#x27;s worldview was shaped by numerous far-right values and concepts including ultranationalism, fascism, racism, and antisemitism; by fascination with violence; by the belief that only war could establish a Ukrainian state; and by hostility to democracy, communism, and socialism. Like other young Ukrainian nationalists, he combined extremism with religion and used religion to sacralize politics and violence.&quot; Historian Timothy Snyder described Bandera as a fascist who &quot;aimed to make of Ukraine a one-party fascist dictatorship without national minorities&quot;. Historian John-Paul Himka writes that Bandera remained true to the fascist ideology to the end. Ukrainian historian Andrii Portnov writes that Bandera remained a proponent of authoritarian and violent politics until his death.

Historian Per Anders Rudling said that Bandera and his followers &quot;advocated the selective breeding to create a &#x27;pure&#x27; Ukrainian race&quot;, and that &quot;the OUN shared the fascist attributes of anti-liberalism, anti-conservatism, and anti-communism, an armed party, totalitarianism, antisemitism, , and adoption of fascist greetings. Its leaders eagerly emphasized to Hitler and Ribbentrop that they shared the Nazi and a commitment to a fascist New Europe.&quot;

Historian David R. Marples described Bandera&#x27;s views as &quot;not untypical of his generation&quot; but as holding &quot;an extreme political stance that rejected any form of cooperation with the rulers of Ukrainian territories: the Poles and the Soviet authorities&quot;. Marples also described Bandera as &quot;neither an orator nor a theoretician&quot;, and wrote that he had minimal importance as a thinker. Marples considered Rossolinski-Liebe to place too much importance on Bandera&#x27;s views, writing that Rossolinski-Liebe struggled to find anything of note written by Bandera, and had assumed he was influenced by OUN publicist Dmytro Dontsov and OUN journals.

Historian Taras Hunczak argues that Bandera&#x27;s central article of faith was Ukrainian statehood, and any other goal was secondary to this view. Through an analysis of OUN documents Hunczak demonstrates the consistent expressed goal of an independent Ukrainian state through the whole history, while the OUN&#x27;s stance towards the German Nazi government was changing, shifting from initial support, towards rejection, as OUN leaders become disillusioned seeing Nazi Germany rejection of Ukrainian independence. The OUN memorandum from 23 June 1941 notes that &quot;German troops entering Ukraine will be, of course, greeted at first as liberators, but this attitude can soon change, in case Germany comes into Ukraine without appropriate promises of [its] goal to reestablish the Ukrainian state.&quot; The OUN memorandum from 14 August declares the OUN wish &quot;to work together with Germany not from opportunism, but from a realization of the need of such cooperation for the well-being of Ukraine&quot;. Hunczak observes OUN leaders&#x27;, including Bandera, attitude change after 15 September 1942, following Gestapo&#x27;s killing of an OUN member, prompting the OUN to use the rhetoric of &quot;German occupier&quot; in reference to Nazi regime. 

Political scientist Andreas Umland opposes characterizing Bandera as a &quot;Nazi&quot;, and characterizes Bandera as a &quot;Ukrainian ultranationalist&quot;, commenting that Ukrainian nationalism was &quot;not a copy of Nazism&quot;. Political scientist Luboš Veselý criticises Rossoliński-Liebe&#x27;s book on Bandera as intentionally painting him and all Ukrainian nationalists negatively. Per Veselý, Rossoliński-Liebe &quot;considers nationalism in general to be closely related to fascism&quot; and fails to put Ukrainian nationalism, as well as antisemitism and fascist movements, in context of their rise in other European countries at the time. The book does not mention arguments of other renowned Ukrainian historians, such as Heorhii Kasianov. Veselý says that &quot;Bandera was against closer cooperation with the Nazis and he insisted that the Ukrainian national movement should not be dependent on anyone&quot;, thus opposing Rossoliński-Liebe&#x27;s conclusion that Ukrainian nationalists needed the protection of Nazi Germany and therefore collaborated with them. Veselý concludes that all of this makes Rossoliński-Liebe&#x27;s assessment of Bandera as a &quot;condemnable symbol of Ukrainian fascism, antisemitism, terrorism and an inspiration for anti-Jewish pogroms and even genocide&quot; &quot;an abusive oversimplification, uprooting events and people from the context of the era or using harsh, unfounded and emotional judgments.&quot;

Ukrainian historian Oleksandr Zaitsev notes that Rossolinski-Liebe&#x27;s approach ignores &quot;the fundamental differences between ultra-nationalist movements of nations with and without a state&quot;. Zaitsev highlights that the OUN did not identify itself with fascism, but &quot;officially objected to this identification&quot;. Zaitsev suggests that it would be more correct to see the OUN and Bandera as the revolutionary ultranationalist movements of stateless nations, which were aiming not on &quot;the reorganization of the existing state according to totalitarian principles, but to create a new state, using all available means, including terror, to this end.&quot; According to Zaitsev, Rossolinski-Liebe omits some facts, which do not fit into his &quot;a priori scheme of &#x27;fascism&#x27;, &#x27;racism&#x27; and &#x27;genocidal nationalism&#x27;&quot;, and denies &quot;the presence of liberatory and democratic elements&quot; in Bandera movement. Historian Dr Raul Cârstocea, too, finds Rossoliński-Liebe&#x27;s association of Bandera with fascism problematic, for one of the reasons Rossoliński-Liebe&#x27;s used definition of fascism being too wide.

===Views towards Poles===
Marples says that Bandera &quot;regarded Russia as the principal enemy of Ukraine, and showed little tolerance for the other two groups inhabiting Ukrainian ethnic territories, Poles and Jews&quot;. In late 1942, when Bandera was in a German concentration camp, his organization, the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, was involved in a massacre of Poles in Volhynia. In early 1944, ethnic cleansing also spread to Eastern Galicia. It is estimated that more than 35,000 and up to 60,000 Poles, mostly women and children along with unarmed men, were killed during the spring and summer campaign of 1943 in Volhynia, and up to 133,000 if other regions, such as Eastern Galicia, are included.

Despite the central role played by Bandera&#x27;s followers in the massacre of Poles in western Ukraine, Bandera himself was interned in a German concentration camp when the concrete decision to massacre the Poles was made and when the Poles were killed. According to Yaroslav Hrytsak, Bandera was not completely aware of events in Ukraine during his internment from the summer of 1941 and had serious differences of opinion with Mykola Lebed, the OUN-B leader who remained in Ukraine and who was one of the chief architects of the massacres of Poles.

===Views towards Jews===
Bandera held the antisemitic views typical of his generation. Speaking about Bandera and his men, political scientist Alexander John Motyl told &quot;Tablet&quot; that antisemitism was not a core part of Ukrainian nationalism in the way it was for Nazism, and the Soviet Union and Poland were considered to be the primary enemies of the OUN. According to him, the attitude of the Ukrainian nationalists towards Jews depended on political circumstances, and they considered Jews to be a &quot;problem&quot; because they were &quot;implicated, or believed to be implicated&quot; in aiding the Soviets in taking Ukrainian territory, as well as not being Ukrainian. Norman Goda wrote that &quot;Historian Karel Berkhoff, among others, has shown that Bandera, his deputies, and the Nazis shared a key obsession, namely the notion that the Jews in Ukraine were behind Communism and Stalinist imperialism and must be destroyed.&quot;

On 10 August 1940, Bandera wrote a letter to Andriy Melnyk saying that he would accept Melnyk&#x27;s leadership of the OUN, provided he expelled &quot;traitors&quot; in the leadership. One of these was Mykola Stsibors&#x27;kyi, who Bandera accused of an absence of &quot;morality and ethics in family life&quot; due to having married a Jewish woman, and especially, a &quot;suspicious&quot; Russian Jewish woman. 

Portnov argues that &quot;Bandera did not participate personally in the underground war conducted by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), which included the organized ethnic cleansing of the Polish population of Volhynia in north-western Ukraine and killings of the Jews, but he also never condemned them.&quot; Similarly, Rossolinski-Liebe and Umland both observe that Bandera personally had no part in the murders of Jews. Rossolinski-Liebe said &quot;he had found no evidence that Bandera supported or condemned &#x27;ethnic cleansing&#x27; or killing Jews and other minorities. It was, however, important that people from OUN and UPA &#x27;identified with him. However, Bandera was aware of at least some of his followers&#x27; anti-Jewish violence: In June 1941, Yaroslav Stetsko sent Bandera a report in which he stated &quot;We are creating a militia which will help to remove the Jews and protect the population.&quot;

According to Rossoliński-Liebe, &quot;After the Second World War and the Holocaust, both Bandera and his admirers were embarrassed by the vehement antisemitic component of their interwar political views and denied it systematically.&quot;

==Legacy==
In his 2006 article discussing &quot;the reinterpretations of [Bandera&#x27;s] career&quot;, historian David R. Marples, who specialises in the history of this area of Eastern Europe, stated that &quot;the impact of Bandera lies less in his own political life and beliefs than in the events enacted in his name, or the conflicts that arose between his supporters and their enemies.&quot; According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Post-war Soviet history propagated the image of Bandera and the UPA as exclusively fascist collaborators and xenophobes.&quot; On the other hand, with the rise of nationalism in Ukraine, his memory there has been elevated. The glorification and attempts to rehabilitate Bandera are growing trends in Ukraine.
===Commemoration===
Neither Bandera nor OUN have been used as national symbols by the current Ukrainian government. Ukrainian president Zelensky has not presented Bandera or his associates as national heroes. Nevertheless, the memory of Bandera can be found in Ukraine.
In late 2006, the Lviv city administration announced the future transference of the tombs of Stepan Bandera, Andriy Melnyk, Yevhen Konovalets and other key leaders of OUN/UPA to a new area of Lychakiv Cemetery specifically dedicated to victims of the repressions of the Ukrainian national liberation struggle. In October 2007, the city of Lviv erected a statue dedicated to Bandera. The appearance of the statue has engendered a far-reaching debate about the role of Stepan Bandera and UPA in Ukrainian history. The two previously erected statues were blown up by unknown perpetrators; the current is guarded by a militia detachment 24/7. On 18 October 2007, the Lviv City Council adopted a resolution establishing the Award of Stepan Bandera in journalism.

On 1 January 2009, his 100th birthday was celebrated in several Ukrainian centres and a postage stamp with his portrait was issued the same day. On 1 January 2014, Bandera&#x27;s 105th birthday was celebrated by a torchlight procession of 15,000 people in the centre of Kyiv and thousands more rallied near his statue in Lviv. The march was supported by the far-right Svoboda party and some members of the center-right Batkivshchyna. In 2018, the Ukrainian Parliament voted to include Bandera&#x27;s 110th birthday, on 1 January 2019, in a list of memorable dates and anniversaries to be celebrated that year. The decision was criticized by the Jewish organization Simon Wiesenthal Center.

There are Stepan Bandera museums in Dubliany, Volia-Zaderevatska, Staryi Uhryniv, and Yahilnytsia. There is a Stepan Bandera Museum of Liberation Struggle in London, part of the OUN Archive, and The Bandera Family Museum () in Stryi. There are also Stepan Bandera streets in Lviv (formerly vulytsia Myru, &quot;Peace street&quot;), Lutsk (formerly Suvorovska street), Rivne (formerly Moskovska street), Kolomyia, Ivano-Frankivsk, Chervonohrad (formerly Nad Buhom street), Berezhany (formerly Cherniakhovskoho street), Drohobych (formerly Sliusarska street), Stryi, Kalush, Kovel, Volodymyr-Volynskyi, Horodenka, Dubrovytsia, Kolomyia, Dolyna, Iziaslav, Skole, Shepetivka, Brovary, and Boryspil, and a Stepan Bandera Avenue in Ternopil (part of the former Lenin Avenue). On 16 January 2017, the Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance stated that of the 51,493 streets, squares and &quot;other facilities&quot; that had been renamed (since 2015) due to decommunization 34 streets were named after Stepan Bandera. Due to &quot;association with the communist totalitarian regime&quot;, the Kyiv City Council on 7 July 2016 voted 87 to 10 in favor of supporting renaming Moscow Avenue to Stepan Bandera Avenue. 

In Dnipro, the local Jewish community opposed renaming a street after Bandera, but after the start of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, they changed their stance and the street was renamed in September 2022; this street had originally been the Gymnasium Street until it was renamed to Otto Schmidt Street by Soviet authorities in 1934. In December 2022 after its recapture in a counteroffensive, the city of Izium decided to rename Pushkin Street to Stepana Bandera Street.

After the fall of the Soviet Union, monuments dedicated to Stepan Bandera have been constructed in a number of western Ukrainian cities and villages, including a statue in Lviv. Bandera was also named an honorary citizen of a number of western Ukrainian cities. In late 2018, the Lviv Oblast Council decided to declare the year of 2019 to be the year of Stepan Bandera, sparking protests by Israel. In 2021, the Ukrainian Institute of National Memory under the authority of the Ukrainian Ministry of Culture, included Bandera, among other Ukrainian nationalist figures, in Virtual Necropolis, a project intended to commemorate historical figures important for Ukraine. Two feature films have been made about Bandera, &quot;Assassination: An October Murder in Munich&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Undefeated&quot; (2000), both directed by Oles Yanchuk, along with a number of documentary films.

===Hero of Ukraine award ===

On 22 January 2010, on the Day of Unity of Ukraine, the then-president of Ukraine Viktor Yushchenko awarded to Bandera the title of Hero of Ukraine (posthumously) for &quot;defending national ideas and battling for an independent Ukrainian state&quot;. Interfax-Ukraine reported that a grandson of Bandera, also named Stepan, accepted the award that day from the Ukrainian President during the state ceremony to commemorate the &quot;Day of Unity of Ukraine&quot; at the National Opera House of Ukraine.

Ukraine&#x27;s &quot;intellectuals with nationalist leanings&quot; supported the designation, but liberals disapproved it. For them, Bandera &quot;was too controversial&quot;, and was not uniting people but dividing them. They were opposing Bandera&#x27;s radical nationalism and OUN&#x27;s leadership xenophoby and antisemitism. The designation let the pro-Russian politicians &quot;to claim that the Orange camp had pro-Nazi sympathies&quot;. The move alienated the Polish allies, who are the main supporters of Ukraine joining the EU.

The European Parliament condemned the award, as did Russia, Poland, and Jewish politicians and organizations, such as the Simon Wiesenthal Center. On 25 February 2010, the European Parliament expressed hope the decision would be reconsidered. On 14 May 2010, the Russian Foreign Ministry said &quot;the event is so odious that it could no doubt cause a negative reaction in the first place in Ukraine. Already it is known a position on this issue of a number of Ukrainian politicians, who believe that solutions of this kind do not contribute to the consolidation of Ukrainian public opinion.&quot; On the other hand, the decree was applauded by Ukrainian nationalists in western Ukraine.

After the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election, the succeeding president Viktor Yanukovych declared the award illegal, since Bandera was never a citizen of Ukraine, a stipulation necessary for getting the award. On 5 March 2010, Yanukovych stated that he would make a decision to repeal the decrees to honor the title of Heroes of Ukraine to Bandera and fellow nationalist Roman Shukhevych before the next Victory Day, although the Hero of Ukraine decrees do not stipulate the possibility that a decree on awarding this title can be annulled. On 2 April 2010, an administrative Donetsk region court ruled the presidential decree awarding the title to be illegal. According to the court&#x27;s decision, Bandera was not a citizen of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (vis-à-vis Ukraine). 

On 5 April 2010, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine refused to start constitutional proceedings on the constitutionality of the Yushchenko decree the award was based on. A ruling by the court was submitted by the Supreme Council of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea on 20 January 2010. In January 2011, under Yanukovych&#x27;s government, the presidential press service informed that the award was officially annulled. This was done after a cassation appeal filed against the ruling by Donetsk District Administrative Court was rejected by the Higher Administrative Court of Ukraine on 12 January 2011. Former president Yushchenko called the annulment &quot;a gross error&quot;.

In December 2018, the Ukrainian parliament considered a motion to again confer the award on Bandera; the proposal was rejected in August 2019.

===2014 Russian intervention in Ukraine===

During the 2014 Crimean crisis and unrest in Ukraine, pro-Russian Ukrainians, Russians (in Russia), and some Western authors alluded to the bad influence of Bandera on Euromaidan protesters and pro-Ukrainian Unity supporters in justifying their actions. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The term &#x27;Banderite&#x27; to describe his followers gained a recent new and malign life when Russian media used it to demonise Maidan protesters in Kiev, telling people in Crimea and east Ukraine that gangs of Banderites were coming to carry out ethnic cleansing of Russians.&quot; Russian media used this to justify Russia&#x27;s actions. Putin welcomed the annexation of Crimea by declaring that he &quot;was saving them from the new Ukrainian leaders who are the ideological heirs of Bandera, Hitler&#x27;s accomplice during World War II.&quot; Pro-Russian activists claimed: &quot;Those people in Kyiv are Bandera-following Nazi collaborators.&quot; Ukrainians in Russia complained of being labelled &quot;Banderites&quot;, even if they were from parts of Ukraine where Bandera is negatively remembered. A minority of people supporting Bandera views was presented in the Euromaidan protests, but Russian propaganda exaggerated their presence and demonized all Maidan protestors. Russian media even labeled &quot;banderites&quot; those 30,000 Russians who went to protest against Russian aggression in Ukraine on the Moscow March of Peace.

=== Russian invasion of Ukraine ===
During his invasion of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin made references to &quot;Banderites&quot; in his speeches and spoke of an inevitable confrontation with &quot;neo-Nazis, Banderites&quot; in his Victory Day speech. Russia heavily promoted the theme of &quot;denazification&quot;, and used rhetoric that was similar to Soviet era policy of equating the development of Ukrainian national identity with Nazism due to Bandera&#x27;s collaboration, which has a particular resonance in Russia. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported on Russian soldiers rounding up villagers who were deemed to be &quot;Nazis&quot; or &quot;Banderites&quot;. Deutsche Welle reported that media in Ukraine included many eyewitness accounts of Russian soldiers pursuing Bandera supporters, and wrote that &quot;whoever is deemed to be a supporter faces torture or death&quot;.

===Attitudes in Ukraine towards Bandera===
A poll conducted in early May 2021 by the Democratic Initiatives Foundation together with the Razumkov Centre&#x27;s sociological service showed that 32% of citizens considered Bandera&#x27;s activity as a historical figure to be positive for Ukraine, as many considered his activity negative; another 21% consider Bandera&#x27;s activities as positive as they are negative. According to the poll, a positive attitude prevailed in the western region of Ukraine (70%); in the central region of the state, 27% of respondents consider his activity positive, 27% consider his activity negative and 27% consider his activity both positive and negative; negative attitude prevails in the southern and eastern regions of Ukraine (54% and 48% of respondents consider his activity negative for Ukraine, respectively).
Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Bandera&#x27;s favorability appeared to shoot up rapidly, with 74% of Ukrainians viewing him favorably according to an April 2022 poll from a Ukrainian research organization. Bandera continued to cause friction with countries such as Poland and Israel. Historian Vyacheslav Likhachev told &quot;Haaretz&quot; that, for public consciousness in Ukraine, the only important thing about Bandera was that he fought for Ukrainian independence, and that other details are not important, especially in the context of events from 2014 onwards, where the struggle for Ukrainian independence became more prominent.

<text>Pasquale Stanislao Mancini, 8th Marquess of Fusignano (17 March 1817 – 26 December 1888) was an Italian jurist and statesman.

==Early life==

Mancini was born in Castel Baronia, in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (present-day Province of Avellino). He became well established in intellectual circles in Naples, editing and publishing a number of newspapers and journals, and gained a reputation in law after the 1841 publication of his correspondence with Terenzio Mamiani on the right to punish. He did not attend university, but rather was educated privately, and was granted a law degree in 1844 by a special exemption.

== Career ==
In 1848 he was instrumental in persuading Ferdinand II to participate in the war against Austria. Twice he declined the offer of a portfolio in the Neapolitan cabinet, and upon the triumph of the reactionary party undertook the defence of the Liberal political prisoners.

Threatened with imprisonment in his turn, he fled to Piedmont, where he obtained a professorship at the University of Turin and became preceptor of the crown prince Humbert. In 1860 he prepared the legislative unification of Italy, opposed the idea of an alliance between Piedmont and Naples, and, after the fall of the Bourbons, was sent to Naples as administrator of justice, in which capacity he suppressed the religious institutes, revoked the Concordat, proclaimed the right of the state to Church property, and unified civil and commercial jurisprudence.

In 1862 he became minister of public instruction in the Rattazzi cabinet, and induced the Chamber to abolish capital punishment. Thereafter, for fourteen years, he devoted himself chiefly to questions of international law and arbitration, but in 1876, upon the advent of the Left to power, became minister of justice in the Depretis cabinet. His Liberalism found expression in the extension of press freedom, the repeal of imprisonment for debt, and the abolition of ecclesiastical tithes.

During the Conclave of 1878 he succeeded, by negotiations with Cardinal Pecci (afterwards Leo XIII), in inducing the Sacred College to remain in Rome, and, after the election of the new pope, arranged for his temporary absence from the Vatican for the purpose of settling private business. Resigning office in March 1878, he resumed the practice of law, and secured the annulment of Garibaldi&#x27;s marriage. The fall of Cairoli led to Mancini&#x27;s appointment (1881) to the ministry of foreign affairs in the Depretis administration. The growing desire in Italy for alliance with Austria and Germany did not at first secure his approval; nevertheless he accompanied King Humbert to Vienna and conducted the negotiations which led to the informal acceptance of the Triple Alliance.

His desire to retain French confidence was the chief motive of his refusal in July 1882 to share in the British expedition to Egypt, but, finding his efforts fruitless when the existence of the Triple Alliance came to be known, he veered to the English interest and obtained assent in London to the Italian expedition to Massawa. An indiscreet announcement of the limitations of the Triple Alliance contributed to his fall in June 1885, when he was succeeded by Count di Robilant.

== Personal life ==
He married poet Laura Beatrice Mancini in 1840, and she ran a literary salon for liberal-minded Neapolitans out of their house. His daughter Rosa married Teodorico Bonacci who was himself twice Minister of Justice, and their daughter Anna Bonacci was a famous writer and actress.

== Death ==
He died in Naples in December 1888.

<doc id="806195" wikidata="Q593178" url="?curid=806195" title="Route 1 (Iceland)">
<text>Route 1 or the Ring Road ( or ) is a national road in Iceland that circles the entire country. As a major trunk route, it is considered to be the most important piece of transport infrastructure in Iceland as it connects the majority of towns together in the most densely populated areas of the country. Economically, it carries a large proportion of goods traffic as well as tourist traffic. The total length of the road is , making it the longest ring road in Europe.

The road was completed in 1974, coinciding with the 1,100th anniversary of the country&#x27;s settlement when the longest bridge in Iceland, crossing the Skeiðará river in the southeast, was opened. Previously, vehicles intending to travel between southern settlements, e.g. Vík to Höfn, had to travel north of the country through Akureyri, making the opening a major transport improvement to the country. 

Many popular tourist attractions in Iceland, such as the Seljalandsfoss and Skógafoss waterfalls, Dyrhólaey cliffs, Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon, as well as Mývatn lake, Dettifoss and Goðafoss waterfalls in the north are easily accessible from the Ring Road. The road passes through almost all areas of the country (everywhere apart from the Westfjords), making it a popular itinerary to take for tourists and vacationing locals alike in Iceland.

==Characteristics==
The Ring Road is paved for all of its length and is mostly two lanes wide: one lane going in each direction. The Icelandic Road Administration, Vegagerðin, oversees the maintenance and operation of the Ring Road. The road is generally of good quality, recent road improvement projects have improved safety considerably. However the road still has hazards, going over many higher-altitude mountain passes in all parts of the country, which can have steep gradients and sharp curves, as well as blind curves and summits and single-lane bridges, especially in the more rural east of the country. Driving in winter one must take special precautions and pre-check driving conditions with the Icelandic Road Administration to ensure the road is passable. 

The speed limit is on open sections; in tunnels and through urban areas. A few speed cameras operate on sections just outside of Reykjavík and in all tunnels. In recent years, due to increased traffic and demands for higher road safety, many large improvements have been made in both capacity and safety of the ring road. In the southwestern corner of the country, between Kjalarnes and Selfoss and through Reykjavík, the road is usually divided by a barrier and has three or four lanes of traffic, mostly being a 2+1 lane partly-controlled access highway. At current traffic levels, 2+1 lane roads provide similar safety and traffic requirements to a regular expressway, and can be upgraded to a 4 lane road when traffic necessitates it. 

The 7.4km long Vaðlaheiðargöng tunnel near Akureyri in the north of the country shortened the route by 16km and improved winter safety, bypassing a mountain road. 
=== Single-lane bridges ===
In more rural parts of the country, mostly in the glacial plains of the south and the Eastfjords, 31 single-lane bridges exist on the Ring Road. Dating back to the original construction of the road in the 1970s, they are sometimes constructed of wood or steel. Vehicles who approach the bridge first have the right of way. These are often narrow and long, making passing difficult, especially when there is high traffic. 

Non-locals, unaware of the rules of single-lane bridges, have ended in head-on and serious collisions using these bridges. Considered a major safety issue, the Icelandic Road Administration aims to rebuild/upgrade all bridges on the ring road to modern two lane standards. Single-lane bridges were reduced from around 60 in 2010 to 32 in 2020. Within the next five years, an additional 14 bridges are to be rebuilt, mostly along the southern coast. 

=== Driving in winter ===
Route 1 has the highest priority for snow removal from the Icelandic Road Administration and is serviced seven days a week during the winter, with teams keeping the road open as weather allows. Conditions are monitored 24/7 and relayed to the public through their website and telephone helpline. During extreme weather it may take hours until the weather calms down to open the road, or for maintenance teams to clear the road of snow after major snowfalls. 

A few major mountain passes prone to closure in heavily trafficked parts of the ring road:

* Hellisheiði, between Reykjavík and Hveragerði
* Holtavörðuheði, between Borganes and Staðarskáli (on the Reykjavík to Akureyri route)
* Vatnsskarð, between Blönduós and Varmahlíð (on the Reykjavík to Akureyri route)
* Öxnadalsheiði, between Varmahlíð and Akureyri (on the Reykjavík to Akureyri route)
* Biskupsháls, between Akureyri and Egilsstaðir

Winter closures used to be more common in the past. In recent years, new tunnels such as the 7.4km long Vaðlaheiðargöng near Akureyri in the north, have reduced the need to close the road due to snow. Prior to rerouting, the route between Breiðdalsvík and Egilsstaðir (over the &quot;Breiðdalsheiði&quot; plateau) in the east was often closed in winter. Route 1 was rerouted in November 2017, now using the somewhat sinuous coastal route via Reyðarfjörður, using (now former) Routes 96 and 92 to travel between the towns.

=== Natural hazards ===
Route 1 crosses a few glacial plains, such as Skeiðarársandur, which made the original road construction difficult in the 1970s. In addition, the Skeiðarársandur plain is subject to frequent glacial floods during or after eruptions on the nearby Grímsvötn volcano. Bridges and other stretches of road over the plains have had to be rebuilt as a result, notably during the eruption of Eyjafjallajökull in 2010, when the ring road was severed for several days in the south. These are not considered to a be a risk to everyday travellers as the roads are closed well in advance of a warning of a volcanic eruption.
=== Traffic ===
Since its completion, the ring road has seen constant growth in traffic, and has seen an even quicker growth during the recent rise in number of tourists arriving in Iceland. Average traffic recorded along the ring road rose from a consolidated count of 57,000 vehicles per day in 2005 to over 90,000 vehicles per day in 2019. 

Route 1 is popular with tourists since it covers most of the country and many sights of interest are located near to the route. It has long been a popular route with Icelandic families going on summer vacation, but in recent years the route is becoming more popular with foreign tourists who either rent a car or bring their own on the ferry to Seyðisfjörður. 

Traffic levels on the road vary considerably between locations: in and near Reykjavík around 20,000-50,000 vehicles use the road daily, rural sections serving routes between Reykjavik and Akureyri in the west and Reykjavík and Vík in the south see traffic volumes of around 2,000 to 5,000 vehicles per day. The stretches farthest away from larger towns, mostly in the sparsely inhabited east of the country see an average around 500 vehicles per day. 

Traffic on the ring road is also subject to considerable variation between the winter and summer, with the traffic in summer often being double or more than during the winter. This is due to a lower flow of tourist and agricultural traffic, as well as the roads being less passable or even closed during the winter. Traffic can become considerably heavy on weekends during the summer, when locals flock to travel around the country for holidays, camping and summer house visits across the country. 

Heavy summer traffic is especially a problem during the summer at the town of Selfoss, where a single two lane bridge, Ölfusárbrú, is routed through the town carries practically all of the traffic in the south of the country, a significant bottleneck. This is planned to be replaced by a new bypass road and new 4-lane bridge over the Ölfus river, currently under construction and projected to be complete by 2028.

=== Electric vehicle charging stations ===
The ring road has complete coverage of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, with around 30 DC fast charging sites spaced approximately 50-80km apart. They are located in almost all towns along the route, as well as rest stops and other locations. Each site has anywhere from 2-16 charging posts and they are operated by various companies including N1, Orka Nattúrinnar and Tesla. Charging power at each site ranges from 50-250kW and are CCS Type 2 standard, with most also supporting the older CHAdeMO standard. The longest stretch between chargers is a 113km section in the northeast, from Mývatn to Skjöldólfsstadir - where there are no amenities (including gasoline). The ring road first became covered by EV charging stations in 2018, initially by Orka Nátturinnar. Additionally, there are many slower AC charging stations at hotels, tourist attractions and towns.

<text>The Latvian Riflemen (; ) were originally a military formation of the Imperial Russian Army assembled starting 1915 in Latvia in order to defend Baltic governorates against the German Empire in World War I. Initially, the battalions were formed by volunteers, and from 1916 by conscription among the Latvian population. A total of about 40,000 troops were drafted into the Latvian Riflemen Division. They were used as an elite force in the Imperial and Red armies.

==Background==
Towards the end of the 19th century, Riga, the future capital of Latvia, became one of the most industrialized cities in the Russian Empire. The Latvian Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party (LSDRP) was well organized and its leading elements were increasingly sympathetic to the Bolsheviks by the time of the 1905 Revolution. When punitive expeditions were mounted by the state following this, armed resistance groups - often affiliated to the LSDRP - were set up to conduct guerilla warfare against the Tsarist regime. Many of these seasoned fighters were subsequently recruited into the Latvian Riflemen. At the outbreak of war Indriķis Lediņš, the Latvian chief of police in Vladivostok, had called for the establishment of Latvian cavalry units.

==Formation==
By April 1915, when the Imperial German Army was advancing into Latvian territory, some prominent Latvians, led by deputy used their position in the State Duma to call on Tsar Nicholas II to establish all-Latvian battalions. As the Germans were advancing into Latvia, they argued, such units would be particularly effective. Latvians knew the area and had high morale because despite the policy of Russification, Latvian nationalist sentiments were more anti-German. At Jelgava two battalions of the Latvian Home Guard had already held back the 
Imperial German Army.
Following increasing German advances, the Russian &quot;Stavka&quot; approved the measure and on 19 July 1915, the tsar approved the formation of the Latvian Riflemen. On the same day Latvian deputies of the State Duma, Jānis Goldmanis and published a patriotic appeal &quot;&quot; (&quot;Pulcējaties zem latviešu karogiem!&quot;) in Riga.
The first volunteers started to apply on August 12 at Riga. Originally, the plan was to form two battalions, but due to the high numbers of volunteers three battalions were formed.

The departure of the first Latvian volunteers from Riga to basic training transformed into a wide national demonstration since the Riflemen units were the first Latvian military units with Latvian commanders in charge.
The first battalions consisted mainly of volunteers, especially refugees from Courland and workers from the factories evacuated to inner Russia from Riga. Later a number of Latvians from other Russian units joined or were transferred to the Latvian Riflemen.

==World War I==

From 1915 to 1917, the Latvian Riflemen fought in the Imperial Russian Army against the Imperial German Army in positions along the Daugava river. In 1916, Latvian battalions were transformed into regiments as conscription started among the local population. Also, many new riflemen units were formed. In total, eight combat and one reserve regiment were formed.
In December 1916 and January 1917, the Latvian riflemen suffered heavy casualties in the month-long Christmas Battles, which began with a surprise attack on German positions during Christmas. Suffering heavy casualties, Latvian riflemen managed to break the German line of defence but the effort was in vain as the attack was not followed through. The Imperial Russian Army lost over 26,000 soldiers in the failed attack. The casualties included 9,000 Latvian riflemen, about a third of the total number at that time. The heavy casualties resulted in a strong resentment against the Russian generals and the Tsar among the riflemen. This resentment led to increased support for the Bolsheviks, who were advocating an end to the war. The fallen Latvian Riflemen were buried at the Brothers&#x27; Cemetery in Riga, created for this purpose.

The structure of the United Latvian Riflemen division, formed in 1917:
1. Latvian Riflemen brigade
* 1st Daugavgriva Latvian Rifle Regiment
* 2. Riga Latvian Riflemen Regiment
* 3. Kurzeme Latvian Riflemen Regiment
* 4th Vidzeme Latvian Riflemen Regiment

2. Latvian Riflemen brigade
* 5. Zemgale Latvian Riflemen Regiment
* 6. Tukums Latvian Riflemen Regiment
* 7. Bauska Latvian Riflemen Regiment
* 8. Valmiera Latvian Riflemen Regiment
==Red Latvian Riflemen==

In May 1917, large parts of the Latvian regiments transferred their loyalty to the Bolsheviks. They became known as Red Latvian Riflemen (, ) and actively participated in the Russian Civil War. The Riflemen took an active part in the suppression of anti-Bolshevik uprisings in Moscow (Left SR uprising) and Yaroslavl (Yaroslavl Uprising) in 1918, and fought against the forces of the White Generals Denikin, Yudenich, and Wrangel. After victory in the Oryol-Kromy operation against Denikin in October 1919, a division of Latvian Riflemen received the highest military recognition of that time: the Honorable Red Flag of VTsIK. Jukums Vācietis, formerly a colonel in the Latvian Rifles became the first commander-in-chief of the Red Army.

The Latvian Red Riflemen were instrumental in the attempt to establish Soviet rule in Latvia in 1919. They suffered great losses of personnel due to the decreasing popularity of Bolshevik ideas among the Latvian Riflemen and Latvians generally, and the majority were re-deployed to other fronts of the Russian Civil War. The remaining forces of the Red Army in Latvia were defeated by Baltic German volunteers under General von der Goltz and newly formed Latvian units initially under Colonel Kalpaks and later under Colonel Jānis Balodis, who were loyal to the Latvian Republic in western Latvia; by the Estonian Army including the , and finally by a joint campaign of the Polish and new Latvian army in Latgale, south-eastern Latvia.

Following the 1920 peace treaty between Latvia and Bolshevik Russia, 11,395 former Red Riflemen returned to Latvia.

Other former Riflemen remained in Soviet Russia and rose to leadership positions in the Red Army, Communist Party, and Cheka. When the USSR occupied Latvia in 1940, many of the surviving Red Riflemen returned to Latvia.

The most famous pre-World War II Soviet Communist leaders from Latvia were from the Red Riflemen: Martin Latsis, Jēkabs Peterss, Arvīds Pelše, Yan Karlovich Berzin, Yan Rudzutak, Pēteris Stučka, Robert Eikhe. All of them, except for Stučka (who died in 1932) and Pelše, were later executed in the so-called Latvian Operation of the NKVD during the Great Purge.

==White Latvian Riflemen==
In 1917, a smaller number of Latvian Riflemen, mostly officers, sided against the Bolsheviks. Officers such as Kārlis Goppers and Frīdrihs Briedis tried to prevent Bolshevik ideas from spreading among the Latvian soldiers. The bloody Christmas and January battles impeded their efforts to fight against Bolshevik ideology. Opponents of Bolshevism either left or were forced to leave military service or joined the White forces. During the last phase of the Civil War, two Latvian units were created in the Urals and Far East of Russia ( and ), but they did not take part in significant military action and were sent to Latvia, by then already an independent nation.

== In culture ==

The Latvian Riflemen have been a long-lasting source of inspiration in Latvian art. Many writers, poets and painters have been inspired by the Latvian Rifles and their battles. The most notable works are:
*A collection of epic poetry about Latvian Riflemen and their battles in Latvia and Russia, &quot;Mūžības skartie&quot; (Affected by Eternity) by poet Aleksandrs Čaks.
*Historical novel &quot;Blizzard of Souls&quot; (&quot;Dvēseļu putenis&quot;) by writer Aleksandrs Grīns, himself a former riflemen. The main protagonist of the novel is a young Latvian schoolboy who enlists in a Latvian rifle unit. In 2019 a film based on the novel premiered.
*A series of paintings (&quot;Latvian Riflemen&quot; 1916–1917 and &quot;Refugees&quot; 1915–1917) by the Latvian painter Jāzeps Grosvalds, who had also served in Latvian Riflemen units.

The Latvian pagan metal band &quot;Skyforger&quot; has the album &quot;&quot; dedicated to the Latvian Riflemen and their battles in the World War I.

A former Latvian rifleman is the protagonist of the 2007 film &quot;Defenders of Riga&quot;, set in the final days of World War I and the subsequent Latvian War of Independence.

<text>Andrew J. Cartmel (born 6 April 1958) is a British script editor, author and journalist. He was the script editor of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; during the Sylvester McCoy era of the show between 1987 and 1989. He has also worked as a script editor on other television series, as a magazine editor, as a comics writer, as a film studies lecturer, and as a novelist.

==Biography==
Raised in Canada, Cartmel returned to England in order to complete his education. He took a post-graduate course in computer studies and worked on computer-aided design for Shape Data Ltd (now UGS Corp) in Cambridge, England during the mid-1980s. He then turned more to writing and managed to gain an agent on the strength of two unproduced scripts, also attending workshops run by the BBC Television Drama Script Unit.

In late 1986, when he was in his late twenties, Cartmel was hired as the script editor for the twenty-fourth season of the science-fiction programme &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, having been recommended to the producer John Nathan-Turner by the producer&#x27;s agent, who had seen some unproduced scripts Cartmel had written. Cartmel worked on the programme for the next three years, overseeing the final three seasons of its original run on BBC One. He brought in several young, new writers and despite declining ratings, tried to take the series in a new creative direction.

The most significant legacy of this new direction might have been the so-called &quot;Cartmel Masterplan&quot;, a backstory developed with other writers that restored some of the mystery of the Doctor&#x27;s background and could have explained exactly who he was. Although hints were dropped in the two final series Cartmel edited, the proposed revelations never materialised on screen because the programme was taken off the air in 1989.

When production of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was placed on indefinite hold, Cartmel became script editor on the BBC&#x27;s popular medical drama series &quot;Casualty&quot; for one season. In the 1990s he wrote comic strips for &quot;Judge Dredd Megazine&quot; and &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; and three &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels for Virgin Books in their &quot;New Adventures&quot; series. This series had used elements of the &quot;masterplan&quot; as part of their overall story arc for the Doctor, particularly in the last Seventh Doctor novel &quot;Lungbarrow&quot;, written by Marc Platt.

In 1999 his first original novel, &quot;The Wise&quot;, was published in Virgin&#x27;s short-lived series of new science-fiction novels, &quot;Virgin Worlds&quot;. That same year he became editor of the science-fiction magazine &quot;Starburst&quot;, although the appointment was a short one and he left the magazine in 2000.

Since then he has written several pieces of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fiction: in 2000 &quot;Winter for the Adept&quot;, an audio drama for Big Finish Productions; in 2003 &quot;Foreign Devils&quot;, a novella for Telos Publishing; and in 2005 &quot;Atom Bomb Blues&quot;, a novel for BBC Books. He developed a script for the third series of &quot;Torchwood&quot; entitled &#x27;The Jinx&#x27;, but it was dropped when the show&#x27;s format was reworked. In 2010 Cartmel worked as script editor for Big Finish Productions&#x27; &quot;The Lost Stories&quot; line, overseeing the adaptation of story ideas created for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&#x27;s unmade 27th series into audio dramas (released in 2011). In addition to script-editing the four &quot;Season 27&quot; stories, Cartmel wrote two scripts (&quot;Crime of the Century&quot; and &quot;Animal&quot;) and co-wrote a third, &quot;Earth Aid&quot;, with Ben Aaronovitch.
As well as &quot;Atom Bomb Blues&quot;, 2005 saw the publication of: &quot;Script Doctor – The Inside Story of Doctor Who 1986–89&quot;, an account of his work on the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television series; &quot;Through Time: An Unofficial and Unauthorised History of Doctor Who&quot;; and two 2000 AD spin-off novels, &quot;Judge Dredd: Swine Fever&quot; and &quot;Strontium Dog: Day of the Dogs&quot;.

Cartmel has also written a novel set in the world of Patrick McGoohan&#x27;s &quot;The Prisoner&quot; television series for Powys Media. The novel, released on 15 February 2008, is entitled &quot;Miss Freedom&quot;.

Common themes and techniques in Cartmel&#x27;s novels include: animal rights; the use of animal perspectives; and extended metaphors of animal behaviour. These elements appear in the three Virgin New Adventures novels, the original novel &quot;The Wise&quot;, the Judge Dredd novel &quot;Swine Fever&quot; and the audio play &quot;Animal&quot;.

In 2001 Cartmel briefly returned to television as script editor on the second season of Channel 5&#x27;s fantasy / adventure series &quot;Dark Knight&quot;, writing what proved to be the final episode of the series.

His first stage play, &quot;End of the Night&quot;, a thriller with gothic overtones, was produced by Long Shadow Productions in the summer of 2003.

In 2007 Cartmel was a finalist in the Nicotinell &#x27;Lose the Smoke Keep the Fire&#x27; Stand Up Comedy Auditions.

<doc id="806204" wikidata="Q929649" url="?curid=806204" title="Union (Yes album)">
<text>Union is the thirteenth studio album by English progressive rock band Yes, released on 30 April 1991 by Arista Records. Production began following the amalgamation of two bands that featured previous and then-current members of Yes: Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe (ABWH), consisting of vocalist Jon Anderson, drummer Bill Bruford, keyboardist Rick Wakeman and guitarist Steve Howe, and Yes, at that time comprising bassist and vocalist Chris Squire, guitarist and vocalist Trevor Rabin, keyboardist Tony Kaye and drummer Alan White. The eight musicians signed with Arista and a combination of unfinished tracks by both groups were selected for &quot;Union&quot;.

The delivery of the final album was problematic from the start, including late-stage disagreements between some of the musicians regarding the &quot;merger&quot; of the two bands. ABWH had already been suffering from strained relations during the recording process for their second, ultimately unfinished album (which eventually made up the bulk of &quot;Union&quot;), and the production team of Anderson and producer Jonathan Elias had made the decision to bring in session musicians to re-record parts that Wakeman, Bruford and Howe had originally completed, causing further friction and resentment. The Squire/Rabin-led Yes had little material available, resulting in some Rabin solo demos and a Squire/Billy Sherwood track being added to the album as &quot;Yes&quot; work. Squire sang extra vocals on some ABWH tracks in an attempt to provide a bridging factor.

&quot;Union&quot; was released to a decidedly mixed critical reception, and the majority of the band have openly stated their dislike of the material. Despite all this, it fared relatively well commercially, reaching No. 7 in the UK and No. 15 in the US. After two months, &quot;Union&quot; was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for selling 500,000 copies. The first single, &quot;Lift Me Up&quot;, was number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for six weeks. Howe&#x27;s acoustic guitar piece &quot;Masquerade&quot; received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. Yes supported &quot;Union&quot; with their 1991–1992 ‘Around the World in 80 Dates’ show that featured all eight members playing on stage; Bruford, Wakeman, and Howe left the band after the tour.

== Background ==
In 1983, bassist Chris Squire and drummer Alan White were working on new material with guitarist/singer/songwriter Trevor Rabin. Original Yes keyboardist Tony Kaye rounded out the group, which was initially called Cinema. Upon hearing the new material the quartet were working on, Jon Anderson rejoined them and it now made sense to call the band Yes. The result was their most commercially successful album, &quot;90125&quot; (1983) and &quot;Big Generator&quot; (1987), for Atco Records. In 1988, Anderson left Yes and formed Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe (ABWH), a group with former Yes members Bill Bruford, Rick Wakeman, Steve Howe and Bruford&#x27;s former King Crimson bandmate Tony Levin on bass guitar. ABWH released their self-titled album for Arista Records in 1989 and supported it with a world tour. During this time, the four remaining Yes members began to write songs with former Yes producer Eddy Offord and held auditions for a new lead singer, including Supertramp vocalist Roger Hodgson and Billy Sherwood of World Trade. Sherwood went on to become a longtime collaborator with Yes, firstly as a live musician and producer; he became their full-time bassist following Squire&#x27;s death in 2015.

In 1990, ABWH started work on a second album at Studio Miraval in Correns, France with producer Jonathan Elias, for whom Anderson had contributed lyrics and vocals to &quot;Requiem for the Americas&quot; (1990). Bruford has praised the material that Howe, Tony Levin and he were developing prior to Anderson&#x27;s involvement, and had high hopes for ABWH&#x27;s creative future. The atmosphere changed when Arista asserted that none of their new material was suitable for radio airplay. After the backing tracks had been put down, Anderson went to Los Angeles to record some of his vocals. He also reunited with Rabin and heard some songs that Yes were working on. Anderson suggested that he could add lead vocals to them, in addition to asking Rabin for a song that ABWH could record for their album. &quot;What I read into that was they needed a single&quot;, recalled Rabin, who was primarily responsible for Yes&#x27;s hit singles of the 1980s. Rabin gave Anderson three demos, one of which was &quot;Lift Me Up&quot;, but requested that ABWH record only one. Anderson wished to record all three, which became the impetus for discussions amongst management of Yes and ABWH that &quot;joining forces&quot; and making an album together would prove the most beneficial arrangement.

The combination of the two bands received mixed internal reactions. Rabin thought the idea was &quot;useful and convenient to everyone, because we wanted to go on the road, and it was a quick way&quot;. Squire called Yes&#x27;s involvement in the ABWH project a &quot;salvage job&quot;. Howe and Bruford both resisted, seeing no need to &quot;become Yes&quot; once again as they felt they had reached substantial success as ABWH. Bruford added that ABWH &quot;was a group in the making&quot;, but &quot;the politicians got involved and that idea was quickly crushed.&quot; Following a period of negotiations Atco agreed to release Yes, thus allowing everyone to sign a four-album deal with Arista. This gave the green-light for an album that combined tracks recorded separately by both groups, with Anderson on vocals. As part of the deal, Atco retained the rights to the band&#x27;s back catalogue. Squire remembered a &quot;huge, 90-page contract&quot; was produced to settle the various legal issues between the two bands, labels, and promoters. The album&#x27;s original title was &quot;Dialogue&quot;, which was announced in the press as late as February 1991, while the album was being mixed.

== Recording and production ==
&quot;Union&quot; includes nine tracks recorded by ABWH, these being &quot;I Would Have Waited Forever&quot;, &quot;Shock to the System&quot;, &quot;Without Hope You Cannot Start the Day&quot;, &quot;Silent Talking&quot;, &quot;Angkor Wat&quot;, &quot;Dangerous (Look in the Light of What You&#x27;re Searching For)&quot;, &quot;Holding On&quot;, &quot;Evensong&quot;, and &quot;Take the Water to the Mountain&quot; Collectively they were recorded in five different studios, including Studio Guillaume Tell in Paris, SARM West Studios in London, Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles and Vision Sound Studios in New York City. Howe recorded &quot;Masquerade&quot; by himself in Langley Studios at his home in Devon, England. &quot;Evensong&quot; featured only Bruford and Tony Levin on Chapman Stick.

The remaining four tracks were produced by Yes: &quot;Lift Me Up&quot;, &quot;Saving My Heart&quot;, &quot;Miracle of Life&quot;, and &quot;The More We Live – Let Go&quot;. According to White, Yes had roughly three months to finish their tracks. The majority of the bass parts on the album are played by Tony Levin (on both bass guitar &amp; Chapman Stick), with Squire only playing bass on &quot;Lift Me Up&quot;, &quot;Saving My Heart&quot; and &quot;Miracle of Life&quot;. Sherwood played the bass on &quot;The More We Live- Let Go&quot;. Squire sang backing vocals on the four tracks Yes produced, as well as several of the ABWH-produced tracks, including &quot;I Would Have Waited Forever&quot;, &quot;Without Hope (You Cannot Start the Day)&quot; and &quot;Dangerous (Look in the Light of What You&#x27;re Searching For)&quot;.

The number of people who worked on the album is highly unusual. There are seven different producers, roughly 17 recording engineers and mixers, six backing singers, nine synthesizer player/programmers and no less than four additional musicians who added parts as well. This is the only album in the Yes discography to feature participation from this many individuals who were not in Yes, or part of a regular, much smaller production team. Consequently, four pages of the album&#x27;s CD booklet are dedicated to the song credits.

===Issues with ABWH tracks===

When Elias accepted Anderson&#x27;s invitation to produce the ABWH tracks, with Anderson credited as an associate producer, Elias felt uneasy about the task as a Yes album of &quot;fresh&quot; material was something he thought was too difficult to achieve, following the band&#x27;s history of internal conflict. He aimed to present the &quot;high technical edge&quot; that Yes were known for, within the structure of more concise and direct songs and not spotlight only technical prowess. Anderson initially resisted this approach as he wished to distance himself from the more commercial music that had largely defined Yes across the previous decade. When recording began, Elias recalled a lack of solid material and the tension between Anderson and Howe especially, including the refusal of the two to stay in the studio while the other was present. Elias tried to help stimulate creativity and brought in a Hammond organ, but said Wakeman refused as he thought the instrument was outdated. Elias concluded that ABWH &quot;didn&#x27;t care about a note of music&quot;, and was relieved to have finished some of the material at all, considering the difficulties and his personal dislike for some of the songs.

Matters complicated further when ABWH had started to put takes down. Wakeman and Howe had both agreed to solo commitments prior to recording, so their respective keyboard and guitar tracks were stored onto a computer, but not finalised and mastered. In their absence, Elias and Anderson brought in session musicians to play new arrangements from the initial takes as they were dissatisfied with what Wakeman and Howe had played. Elias said, &quot;We weren&#x27;t looking for only the early-&#x27;70s &#x27;pyro technique&#x27;. We wanted something more modern&quot;. Among the 11 additional keyboard and synthesiser players featured on &quot;Union&quot; is Jim Crichton of Saga. Crichton and his assistant Brian Foraker were given songs that needed work and the pair &quot;tried to fill in the gaps&quot; at Crichton&#x27;s own studio by playing parts that they thought Wakeman might play under those circumstances. Crichton felt &quot;Dangerous&quot; was a particularly strong track in demo form, but that the final version on the album was substandard. Rabin was invited to replace Howe&#x27;s parts, but turned down the opportunity. Recordings were made with session guitarist Scott van Zen, but ultimately the parts in question were replaced by Jimmy Haun, who was suggested by Steve Porcaro and had worked in Squire&#x27;s band The Chris Squire Experiment. Haun later said that it was Anderson, Elias, &quot;and one other person&quot; who made the final decision as to which parts were kept and replaced by someone else.
Wakeman criticised Elias for allowing the edits and overdubs, and the two addressed each other&#x27;s issues in different publications of &quot;Keyboard&quot; magazine. Elias &quot;never questioned Rick&#x27;s technical ability&quot; and stressed that &quot;Union&quot; was not an album of &quot;major opuses&quot; and felt Wakeman had &quot;lost his edge&quot;. Elias ranked his time with Haun as his best experience during the making of the album. Howe called Haun an &quot;average guitarist&quot; and compared his changes to &quot;having an abortion&quot;. Elias maintained the view that he and Anderson agreed that outside musicians were needed and described Howe&#x27;s reaction as merely &quot;bruised ego from someone who is a very good guitar player in his own right.&quot; Howe included the original backing tracks of &quot;Dangerous&quot; and &quot;Without Hope You Cannot Start the Day&quot; on his 2017 compilation &quot;Anthology 2: Groups &amp; Collaborations&quot;.

Roger Dean was hired to design the art for the album. After the release of &quot;Big Generator&quot;, Dean was asked by Phil Carson to design a new band logo, and came up with a square design, but it was not used due to Anderson forming ABWH. When it came to &quot;Union&quot;, Dean decided to use the Yes logo he designed in 1972, the square design appearing in the corner and on the subsequent &quot;Yesyears&quot; cover. It would also later appear on the covers of &quot;The Ladder&quot; and &quot;House of Yes: Live from House of Blues&quot;.

== Songs ==
=== By ABWH ===
&quot;I Would Have Waited Forever&quot; features Howe playing a guitar riff that he also used on &quot;Sensitive Chaos&quot; from his solo album &quot;Turbulence&quot; (1991). Haun later revealed that Howe plays a short, recurring thread and the ending solo, but all other electric, acoustic, and effect overdubs were in fact played by him, and that Arista wanted a guitar riff similar to that of &quot;Starship Trooper&quot; from &quot;The Yes Album&quot; (1971). Elias thought the track best represented &quot;both early and later Yes styles&quot;.

Although Howe wrote the opening guitar riff to &quot;Shock to the System&quot;, Haun re-recorded the part for &quot;sonic reasons&quot; and devised the other riffs as well, leaving no other parts that Howe had originally played. Some bass parts from Levin were also redone on his bass guitar during his time away from the studio. Haun described one of his riffs as reminiscent to &quot;The Gates of Delirium&quot; from &quot;Relayer&quot; (1974).

&quot;Masquerade&quot; is an acoustic guitar instrumental written and performed by Howe. He recorded the track in fifteen minutes at his home studio using a two-channel Revox deck, &quot;away from all the arguments and politics&quot; that came with making the album. He recorded other acoustic tracks on a Spanish guitar for the album, including one titled &quot;Baby Georgia&quot;, but Arista decided to use &quot;Masquerade&quot;, a track Howe ironically almost decided against sending because he thought it was not as strong as the others.

&quot;Without Hope (You Cannot Start the Day)&quot; originated from Elias, who recorded a basic outline of the track in one afternoon and sent the tape to Wakeman to add keyboards. Elias and Anderson felt dissatisfied with Wakeman&#x27;s contribution; they had wished for something &quot;simple and gentle&quot; but instead got a part that to Elias &quot;sounded like a Rachmaninoff piano concerto&quot;, and hence recorded a new piano part. Howe does not play on the track.

&quot;Silent Talking&quot; is a song that Howe wrote that originally connected with an instrumental called &quot;Seven Castles&quot;. Howe thought it contained some of his better guitar playing on the album, but felt Anderson came in too soon with his vocals in the second half, after his solo began. Haun replaced what Howe had put down for the main guitar riff &quot;because there were timing discrepancies&quot;, so he tried to get as close to Howe&#x27;s sound as possible. Other riffs from Howe were kept on the track, and can be heard due to a slightly different guitar tone that Haun used. 

&quot;Angkor Wat&quot;, named after the Cambodian temple of the same name, was written by Elias, Anderson and Wakeman. During Wakeman&#x27;s final day of recording, Elias asked Wakeman to record some atmospheric keyboard sounds that were then layered and formed into a track. The track concludes with a poem recited in Cambodian. 

&quot;Evensong&quot; is a bass and percussion duet between Levin and Bruford and is named after an evening prayer service held in English churches. 

Anderson said about “Take The Water To The Mountain”, &quot;It&#x27;s a simple song, really. Take the water back to the mountains and give the mountains the energy they need. It&#x27;s a reference to our ancient knowledge. About halfway through the track, the music becomes very ancient sounding and very rhythmic.”

=== By Yes ===
&quot;Lift Me Up&quot; was written by Rabin and Squire, and is the only track on the album performed by the Los Angeles-based Yes as a full band. Squire and Rabin used a dictionary to look for suitable rhyming words for the song&#x27;s lyrics, which is how they came up with the word &quot;imperial&quot; in its chorus. According to Rabin, the song concerns a homeless person who enters a restaurant just to use the bathroom, only to have the people inside telling him he has to leave. &quot;And he just looks up to the sky [and says] ... you know, help me out&quot;. Rabin completed two different mixes of the track but Arista founder Clive Davis disliked them. After Squire suggested they bring in someone else, Paul Fox was hired and finished a mix with assistance from Ed Thacker that was used on the album. Rabin, feeling the original mix was superior, thought Fox and Thacker&#x27;s work was &quot;very good&quot; but it suffered from them not having a clear idea of what Rabin had wanted.

&quot;Saving My Heart&quot; is a remixed Trevor Rabin demo, with Rabin playing all instruments and sharing lead vocals with Anderson. Rabin had initially felt that the song was not suitable for a Yes album, a feeling he had also had for &quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot;. He originally planned to develop the track with Roger Hodgson before Anderson heard it and wished to work on it for &quot;Union&quot;. The song displays a distinct reggae influence. Rabin was unhappy with the song&#x27;s final mix as it did not turn out the way he had wished.

&quot;Miracle of Life&quot; is also sourced from a Rabin demo created separately from Yes and with him playing all instruments and singing, with Anderson adding extra vocals. Rabin described it as a protest song; the inspiration for its lyrics came from watching a news report on the slaughtering of dolphins in Denmark. Howe thought the track was &quot;very good&quot;.

&quot;The More We Live – Let Go&quot; is the first song that Squire and Sherwood wrote together, and all parts bar lead guitar and some of the vocals are performed by Sherwood. Sherwood and 1970s Yes producer Eddy Offord wanted Squire to re-record the bass parts that Sherwood had played on the demo, but Squire felt that Sherwood&#x27;s playing suited the song perfectly and insisted it be kept. Rabin and Anderson re-recorded lead guitar and lead vocal parts respectively. To Sherwood, the writing and recording process was so successful, he and Squire agreed to continue writing together from then on. The pair also wrote and recorded &quot;Love Conquers All&quot;, a track which was eventually released on the &quot;Yesyears&quot; box set as a version with Rabin on lead vocals (and which later resurfaced in its original form as a track by the Squire/Sherwood band Conspiracy).

== Release ==
&quot;Union&quot; was released on 30 April 1991. The album was a success on the charts, reaching its peak of number seven on the UK Albums Chart in May 1991 during a six-week stay. In the United States, it debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at number 35, the week of 18 May 1991. The album climbed on the following week, reaching its peak at number 15 on the week ending 25 May. It was present on the chart for a total of 19 weeks.

On 2 July 1991, &quot;Union&quot; was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of 500,000 copies.

In 1992, &quot;Masquerade&quot; received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. Howe described the nomination for his track as &quot;pure justice&quot;, following the difficulties in making the album.

Yes released three singles from &quot;Union&quot; in 1991. &quot;Lift Me Up&quot; was the lead single, released in April 1991. It became one of the band&#x27;s most successful singles, spending six weeks at number one from its third week on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Album Rock Tracks chart, later known as the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. It was number one from the week of 4 May to 8 June 1991. It reached a peak of 86 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart. The second single, &quot;Saving My Heart&quot;, released in July 1991, reached a high of number nine on the Album Rock Tracks chart a month later. &quot;I Would Have Waited Forever&quot; was the final single released.

==Tour==
The Union Tour covered North America, Europe, and Japan from 9 April 1991 to 5 March 1992, billed as Yesshows &#x27;91: Around the World in 80 Dates. It was the first rock tour produced by Philadelphia-based Electric Factory Concerts in its history which also organised advertising and promotion. The partnership evolved following discussions between Anderson and EFC head Larry Magid, who learned that Anderson had enjoyed how the ABWH concert in Philadelphia was presented. The tour featured the eight members playing on stage and some shows were performed in the round with a central revolving stage that the band had first used on their 1978 tour.

Unlike the album, most of the group have reflected positively on the tour. Wakeman ranked it as the most fun he had on a tour. Bruford, by contrast, said the tour was &quot;ludicrous, really. For some of us, it was a very lucrative bit of fun; others needed it desperately.&quot; A live CD and DVD from various dates was released in 2011 as &quot;Union Live&quot;.

Yes reverted to the 1983–1988 line-up for their next album, &quot;Talk&quot;.

== Reception ==

The album received mixed reviews from critics. Chuck Eddy gave it two stars out of five for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, calling it &quot;an eclectic miscarriage that almost isn&#x27;t even worth laughing about&quot;, and wished the album had more memorable hooks, riffs, and concise lyrics. &quot;Q&quot; magazine issued a review from Robert Sandall, who thought &quot;Union&quot; &quot;veers alarmingly between ... neurotically jumpy overarrangements and competing time signatures&quot; from ABWH and &quot;heads-down riffing&quot; from the Yes members. Sandall picked out &quot;Lift Me Up&quot; as one of the few &quot;strong, anthemic tunes&quot; that remain &quot;unscathed&quot; from the collision of such varied styles, which makes &quot;Union&quot; &quot;one of the least ridiculous Yes albums in recent memory&quot;. Dave DiMartino of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rated the album with a D+, and called it a &quot;stunningly wicked parody of an outlandish concept&quot;, pointing out its &quot;complete and utter unlistenability&quot;. In &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Gil Grifin noted that &quot;musically and conceptually&quot;, the band are &quot;reaching for its glorious past&quot; which resulted in an album not entirely appealing. Though &quot;Lift Me Up&quot;, &quot;The More We Live – Let Go&quot; and &quot;Saving My Heart&quot; are picked as more favourable tracks, Grifin concludes with &quot;the aloofness of &#x27;Union&#x27; is often sleep-inducing&quot;.

&quot;Union&quot; received two and a half stars out of five in a retrospective review by Bruce Eder for AllMusic. Eder thought it was always difficult for the album to live up to expectations given the amount of musical talent involved. Nevertheless, he judged its songs &quot;reasonably solid&quot;, and cites the harmonies in &quot;I Would Have Waited Forever&quot; from Anderson and Squire and Howe&#x27;s &quot;Masquerade&quot; as highlights. But he thought &quot;Lift Me Up&quot; is a &quot;forced exercise in heaviness&quot; and &quot;Without Hope (You Cannot Start the Day)&quot; a &quot;composed-by-numbers&quot; track. In his book &quot;The Music&#x27;s All that Matters: A History of Progressive Rock&quot;, Paul Stump commented that &quot;the music of &quot;Union&quot;, an unhappy testament to hubris, conceit and corporate expediency, unintentionally embodies all the crimes that had been (often mistakenly) laid at the band&#x27;s door hitherto.&quot; He argued that the concept was flawed from the beginning, saying it was unrealistic to expect the band members to cooperatively produce an album of quality and subtlety given the history of strife between them. The music portal Ultimate Classic Rock ranked &quot;Union&quot; worst in its list of Yes albums.

Most of the band have negative opinions on the album. Wakeman stated he was dissatisfied with the production, commenting that most of his contributions were so altered in the final result that he could not recognise them, adding that he called the album &quot;Onion&quot; because &quot;it made me cry every time I heard it&quot;. Rabin thought it lacked a linking thread and ranked &quot;90125&quot; and &quot;Big Generator&quot; as better. &quot;I don&#x27;t hate &quot;Union&quot; as much as Rick,&quot; he stated in 2016, &quot;but it was a peculiar record. It was instigated by Clive Davis and made largely in isolation by the musicians and Jon, so the title is misleading. To me, &quot;Union&quot; is more of a failed project than a real album.&quot; Bruford remains very critical: &quot;It was probably not only the most dishonest title that I&#x27;ve ever had the privilege of playing drums underneath, but the single worst album I&#x27;ve ever recorded.&quot;

<text>Agostino Depretis (31 January 181329 July 1887) was an Italian statesman and politician. He served as Prime Minister of Italy for several stretches between 1876 and 1887, and was leader of the Historical Left parliamentary group for more than a decade. He is the fourth-longest serving Prime Minister in Italian history, after Benito Mussolini, Giovanni Giolitti and Silvio Berlusconi, and at the time of his death he was the longest-served. Depretis is widely considered one of the most powerful and important politicians in Italian history, having enacted numerous reforms that modernized Italy, such as expanding male suffrage and free education.

He was a master in the political art of &quot;Trasformismo&quot;, the method of making a flexible, centrist coalition of government which isolated the extremes of the left and the right in Italian politics after the unification.

==Early life and Italian Unification==
Depretis was born at Bressana Bottarone, near Stradella, which at the time was a province of the French Empire of Napoleon and now is in the province of Pavia, Lombardy. After Napoleon&#x27;s defeat and restoration of the Kingdom of Sardinia, Depretis graduated in law and started working as lawyer.

From early manhood he was a disciple of Giuseppe Mazzini and affiliated with the &quot;La Giovine Italia&quot;. He took an active part in the Mazzinian conspiracies and was nearly captured by the Austrians while smuggling arms into Milan. Elected deputy in 1848, he joined the Left and founded the newspaper &quot;Il Diritto&quot;, but he held no political offices.

In the same period he strongly opposed the policies of the Piedmontese Prime Minister Camillo Benso di Cavour and voted against the main reforms that he presented, including the bill regarding the Piedmontese participation to the Crimean War. Despite their struggles, after the annexation of Lombardy by the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1859, Cavour appointed Depretis governor of Brescia.

In 1860, Giuseppe Garibaldi sailed with his Expedition of the Thousand toward Sicily. The Expedition was formed by corps of volunteers led by Garibaldi in order to conquer the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, ruled by the Bourbons. The project was an ambitious and risky venture aiming to conquer, with a thousand men, a kingdom with a larger regular army and a more powerful navy. The expedition was a success and concluded with a plebiscite that brought Naples and Sicily into the Kingdom of Sardinia, the last territorial conquest before the creation of the Kingdom of Italy on 17 March 1861.

The sea venture was the only desired action that was jointly decided by the &quot;four fathers of the nation&quot; Giuseppe Mazzini, Giuseppe Garibaldi, Victor Emmanuel II, and Camillo Cavour, pursuing divergent goals. The various groups participated in the expedition for a variety of reasons: for Garibaldi, it was to achieve a united Italy; to the Sicilian bourgeoisie, an independent Sicily as part of the kingdom of Italy, and for the mass farmers, land distribution and the end of oppression.

In 1860 Depretis went to Sicily on a mission to reconcile the policy of Cavour, who desired the immediate incorporation of the island in the Kingdom of Italy, with that of Garibaldi, who wished to postpone the Sicilian plebiscite until after the liberation of Naples and Rome. Depretis replaced Garibaldi&#x27;s close councilor Francesco Crispi as pro-dictator (&quot;prodittatore&quot;) of Sicily, during the dictatorial government; however he failed in his attempt to win round Garibaldi and his comrades to the idea of immediately incorporating Sicily into the new Italian kingdom, and resigned in September 1860.

==In government==
===Minister of Public Works===
After Cavour&#x27;s death king Victor Emmanuel II gave the task to form a new government firstly to Bettino Ricasoli and then to Urbano Rattazzi; Rattazzi was the leader of the Left and created a cabinet composed by both political groups. On 3 March 1862, Depretis was appointed Minister of Public Works, and served as intermediary in arranging with Garibaldi.

However, in August 1862 the Royal Italian Army defeated Garibaldi&#x27;s army of volunteers, who were marching from Sicily towards Rome, with the intent of annexing it into the Kingdom of Italy. In the battle, which took place a few kilometers from Gambarie, Garibaldi was wounded and taken as prisoner. Rattazzi&#x27;s policy of repression towards Garibaldi at Aspromonte, caused lot of public protests and the Prime Minister was forced to resign in September 1862.

Moreover, Francesco Crispi accused Depretis of having mounted the Mazzinian riots in Sarnico in May 1862 to discredit Garibaldi. After the fall of the Rattazzi government, therefore, it was easy to predict the end of Depretis&#x27;s political career, when Crispi was elected leader of the Left. Depretis remained on the sidelines during the 8th legislature (1863–65), but he regularly participated in the parliamentary works, intervening regarding the laws for administrative unification and declaring himself hostile to regionalism. He was particularly active during the electoral campaign of 1865 and at the beginning of the 9th legislature he was elected vice president of the Chamber of Deputies.

===Minister of Navy===
In 1866, in anticipation of the war with the Austrian Empire, after the signing of the Italo-Prussian alliance, Ricasoli was appointed prime minister by the king to replace General Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora, who would lead the Italian troops during the war. The king wanted to established a government of &quot;national conciliation&quot; that included members both form the Right and the Left.
On 20 June, Depretis was appointed Minister of the Navy, on the same day the Third Italian War of Independence began. After the Italian defeat in the Battle of Custoza, Depretis insisted with admiral Carlo Persano on the attack against the island of Lissa, as a revenge for Custoza. But he also refused to give to admiral Persano detailed orders about the expedition in the Adriatic Sea against the fleet led by Wilhelm von Tegetthoff. However the Italian &quot;Regia Marina&quot; (&quot;Royal Navy&quot;) was soundly defeated. To quell the public outcry after the two defeats, Depretis called for process Persano, who was judged by the Italian Senate, condemned for incompetence in 1867 and cashiered from duty. However the war ended in an Austrian defeat, with Austria conceding the region of Venetia to Italy. Italy&#x27;s acquisition of this wealthy and populous territory represented a major step in the process of Italian unification.

On 17 February 1867, Depretis resigned as minister of the Navy. His tenure as minister was quite controversial; his apologists contend, however, that, as an inexperienced civilian, he could not have made sudden changes in naval arrangements without disorganizing the fleet, and that in view of the impending hostilities he was obliged to accept the dispositions of his predecessors.

==Leader of the Left==

On 17 February 1867 Depretis was appointed Minister of Finance in the second cabinet of Ricasoli; however after few months, on 10 April, Ricasoli resigned and Depretis returned to be a simple deputy.

Upon the death of Rattazzi in 1873, Depretis became leader of the Left. On 25 June 1873, the conservative government of Giovanni Lanza fell, beaten by a vote that saw the Depretis&#x27;s moderate Left united with a large part of the Right, no longer in support of the Minister of Finance Quintino Sella; in fact Sella abandoned the proposal of a further fiscal tightening in order to achieve a balanced budget. Victor Emmanuel II then asked the conservative Marco Minghetti to form a new government, inviting him to include also members from the Left. Minghetti accepted the suggestion but his efforts to agree with Depretis were vain.

Minghetti and Sella were involved into an ambitious program of budget which needed a strong majority, for which they tried to oblige the Independents to choose their side, beginning to build a two-party system as in the United Kingdom. However, in the Italian non-partisan political system, hugely affected by localism and corruption, their bet was equivalent to an that afterwards they lost.

The 1874 election did not give to Minghetti the advantage he was hoping, especially for the high support to Depretis&#x27;s opposition in Southern Italy. Minghetti&#x27;s government survived, but the bipolarisation of the Parliament he had imposed, strengthened the Left so that it could take the leadership of the country. Two years later, MPs from Tuscany became dissatisfied with the government after it refused to intervene in the financial problems of Florence. The government was defeated on a vote on nationalising railways on 18 March 1876 and Minghetti was forced to resign. As a result, Depretis became prime minister, with 414 of the 508 MPs supporting the government. The fall of the Minghetti&#x27;s cabinet was called, by political commentators, the &quot;parliamentary revolution&quot;.

==Prime Minister of Italy==
===First term===

On 25 March 1876, Depretis sworn in as prime minister; his cabinet was the first one to be composed only by members of the Left. Prominent ministers were Giovanni Nicotera, Pasquale Stanislao Mancini, Michele Coppino, Giuseppe Zanardelli and Benedetto Brin.

To strengthen his position, Depretis called for a new election in November. For the first time, the left-wing won an election, gaining almost 70% of votes and taking 414 of the 508 seats, of which 12 were extreme left-wingers. As opposed to the previous right-wing governments, whose members were largely aristocrats representing rentiers from the north of the country, and held moderate political views including loyalty to the crown and low government spending, the left-wing government represented the bourgeoisie of the south of the country and supported low taxation, secularism, a strong foreign policy and public jobs.

The main reform proposed by the government was the school one that took its name from Minister Coppino and was presented on 15 July 1877. The law introduced compulsory, secular and free primary education for children aged six to nine. On the other hand, while maintaining the electoral promises, Depretis raised the minimum exemption for the mobile wealth tax from 250 to 800 lire, granting greater deductions for industrial income. Important, although not very effective, was the decree of 25 August 1876 which regulated the office of the prime minister with the will to contain the monarchical power and above all the conflict of ministers.

The foreign policy of his first government was prudent, similar to that of the cabinets which had preceded it. His policies created criticisms from the progressives who were pushing for an approach to German Empire to fight France. This francophobic attitude increased in May 1877 when the government of Albert de Broglie, favorable to clericals positions, sworn in Paris. The government however had to face the violent attacks against the Minister of the Interior Nicotera, who was considered guilty, according to a part of the majority, of abuses and illegality; unable to cope with the crisis, Depretis decided to resign in December 1877.

The king, gave again to Depretis the task of forming a new cabinet; it was the last political act of the king who would die after few months. Depretis failed in stopping the contrasts within the Left. He was criticized for having abolished the Ministry of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce and having established the Ministry of Treasury in order to achieve greater control over state budget. On 11 March 1878, Depretis resigned from his office, when his candidate lost the election to become president of the Chamber of Deputies; the following cabinet was led by another prominent leftist member Benedetto Cairoli.

===Second term===
In November 1879, Depretis joined the Cairoli cabinet as Minister of the Interior. In the same period, a general irritation was caused by Cairoli and Count Corti&#x27;s policy of clean hands at the Berlin Congress, where Italy obtained nothing, while Austria-Hungary secured a European mandate to occupy Bosnia and Herzegovina. A few months later the attempt of Giovanni Passannante to assassinate King Humbert I at Naples on 12 December 1878, caused Cairoli&#x27;s downfall.

Depretis was appointed prime minister by the king; his cabinet was formed by members of the Left and of the Right. On 24 June 1879 the Italian Senate approved, with significant amendments, the bill on the abolition of the tax on the mill. However, on 3 July, the Chamber rejected the law and voted down the government; third cabinet of Depretis therefore had to resign after only six months of troubled political life and the next government was again led by Cairoli, on 14 July.

===Third term===

Following the French occupation of Tunis on 11 May 1881, in view of popular indignation Cairoli resigned in order to avoid making inopportune declarations to the Chamber. The king, after the failed attempt by Quintino Sella to establish a new cabinet, appointed Depretis once again prime minister to form his third government.

On 20 May 1882, Depretis signed the Triple Alliance, a secret military agreement between Italy, Germany and Austria-Hungary to oppose the power of France and Russia. Italy sought support against France shortly after it lost North African ambitions to the French. Each member promised mutual support in the event of an attack by any other great power. The treaty provided that Germany and Austria-Hungary were to assist Italy if it was attacked by France without provocation. In turn, Italy would assist Germany if attacked by France. In the event of a war between Austria-Hungary and Russia, Italy promised to remain neutral.

In domestic policy, 1882 saw the approval of the electoral reform of which Depretis had also become the main spokesman and on 22 January the parliament approved what the Prime Minister had called &quot;the only possible universal suffrage&quot;. All men of at least 21 years of age who had attended at least the first two years of elementary school or who contributed an annual tax of no less than 19.80 lire were entitled to vote. the voting age was lowered from 25 to 21 and the tax requirement lowered from ₤40 to ₤19.80, whilst men with three years of primary education were exempted from it. This resulted in the number of eligible voters increasing from 621,896 at the 1880 elections to 2,017,829. The electoral system was changed from one based on single-member constituencies to one based on small multi-member constituencies with between two and five seats. Voters had as many votes as there were candidates, except in constituencies with five seats, in which they were limited to four votes. To be elected in the first round a candidate needed an absolute majority of the votes cast and to receive a number of votes equivalent to at least one-eighth of the number registered voters. If a second round was required, the number of candidates going through was double the number of seats available.

In the 1882 general election the Left emerged as the largest in Parliament, winning 289 of the 508 seats; the Right arrived second with 147 seats. Depretis was confirmed prime minister by the king.

During his long tenure Depretis recomposed his cabinet four times, first throwing out Giuseppe Zanardelli and Alfredo Baccarini in order to please the Right, and subsequently bestowing portfolios upon Cesare Ricotti-Magnani, Robilant and other Conservatives, so as to complete the political process known as &quot;Trasformismo.

Depretis also completed the railway system and initiated colonial policy by the occupation of Massawa; but, at the same time, he increased indirect taxation, corrupted the parliamentary parties, and, by extravagance in public works, impaired the stability of Italian finance. He argued that a wider suffrage would give citizens a moral dignity and sense of responsibility.

Despite an insistent gout, Depretis remained Prime Minister until his death. More and more often he gathered the government in the living room of his house, at Via Nazionale in Rome. Transferred to Stradella due to the aggravation of the disease, he died there on 29 July 1887, at 74 years old. After the funeral he was buried in the cemetery of his home town. He was replaced at the head of the Left and at the head of the government by Francesco Crispi.

==Political ideology and legacy==

Depretis was the founder and the main proponent of &quot;Trasformismo&quot; (&quot;Transformism&quot;), a method of making a flexible centrist coalition of government which isolated the extremes of the left and the right. The process was initiated in 1883, when he moved to the right and reshuffled his government to include Marco Minghetti&#x27;s conservatives. This was a move Depretis had been considering for a while before 1883. The aim was to ensure a stable government that would avoid weakening the institutions by extreme shifts to the left or right. Depretis felt that a secure government could ensure calm in Italy.

At this time middle class politicians were more concerned with making deals with each other and less about political philosophies and principles. Large coalitions were formed, with members being bribed to join them. The liberals, the main political group, was tied together by informal &quot;gentleman&#x27;s agreements&quot;, but these were always in matters of enriching themselves. Indeed, actual governing did not seem to be happening at all, but since only 2 million men had franchises, most of these wealthy landowners did not have to concern themselves with such things as improving the lives of the people they were supposedly representing democratically.

However &quot;trasformismo&quot; fed into the debates that the Italian parliamentary system was weak and actually failing; it ultimately became associated with corruption. It was perceived as the sacrifice of principles and policies for short term gain. The system of &quot;trasformismo&quot; was little loved and seemed to be creating a huge gap between &#x27;Legal&#x27; (parliamentary and political) Italy, and &#x27;Real&#x27; Italy where the politicians became increasingly isolated. This system brought almost no advantages, illiteracy remained the same in 1912 as before the unification era, and backward economic policies, combined with poor sanitary conditions, continued to prevent the country&#x27;s rural areas from improving.

<doc id="806208" wikidata="Q235916" url="?curid=806208" title="Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo">
<text>Maria de Lourdes Ruivo da Silva de Matos Pintasilgo (; 18 January 1930 – 10 July 2004) was a Portuguese chemical engineer and politician. She was the first and to date only woman to serve as Prime Minister of Portugal, and the second woman to serve as prime minister in Western Europe, after Margaret Thatcher.

== Early life ==
Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo was born to a middle-class family in 1930. Her father, Jaime de Matos Pintasilgo (born Covilhã, Conceição, 9 December 1896 – died Lisbon, Socorro, 10 October 1959) was in the wool business, and her mother was Amélia do Carmo Ruivo da Silva, a native of Vendas Novas. Her parents married in Abrantes on 14 March 1929.

Her father, Jaime, abandoned the family and at school she tried hard to hide that, thus causing her to avoid usual relationships. At the age of seven, she was sent to the Liceu Filipa de Lencastre, a secondary school, in Lisbon. She distinguished herself in the Mocidade Portuguesa, a militaristic youth movement founded by Dictator Salazar. Later she joined Acção Católica (Catholic Action). During her years at the Instituto Superior Técnico from where she earned a degree in industrial chemical engineering, she joined and eventually led the Catholic&#x27;s women&#x27;s student movement.

== Early career ==
After graduating from University of Lisbon&#x27;s Instituto Superior Técnico in 1953, at the age of 23, with an engineering degree in industrial chemistry she went into a graduate scholarship program with the national Nuclear Energy Board. After completing the program, she began working for a large Portuguese conglomerate with interests in cement plants, Companhia União Fabril, the &quot;CUF&quot;. By 1954, she held the position of chief engineer of the studies and projects division. From that position she quickly moved to the position of project director, where she was in charge of the firm&#x27;s documentation center and responsible for the company&#x27;s technical journals. She held this position for seven years, until she left the company in 1960.

Pintasilgo had strong ties to the Roman Catholic Church. From 1952 to 1956, at Lisbon&#x27;s Catholic University of Portugal, she was president of the women&#x27;s group. In 1956 she became the international president of a movement of Catholic students, Pax Romana. In 1961, Pintasilgo joined the Grail (Graal), an international Catholic laywomen&#x27;s movement. Two years after joining the Grail she led an international group working to improve the movement as well as establishing it in Portugal.

By 1965 she had become the Grail&#x27;s international vice-president. She was also appointed by the Vatican and served as woman&#x27;s liaison between the Roman Catholic Church and the World Council of Churches. After leaving Companhia União Fabril, she held a job in government until 1969 which was to run Portugal&#x27;s program for development and social change. In 1970, she presided over government working groups involving women&#x27;s affairs, as well as being a member of the Portuguese delegation to the United Nations, 1971–72. In 1974 she was appointed secretary of state for social welfare in the first provisional government following the revolution. She moved her way up to Minister of Social Affairs by early 1975. In 1975, Pintasilgo became Portugal&#x27;s first Ambassador to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO.

== Tenure as Prime Minister and later career==
In 1979 she was called on by General António Ramalho Eanes, the president of Portugal, to become prime minister. Pintasilgo was sworn in as the Prime Minister of the Portuguese caretaker government on 1 August 1979 with the term of three months in office. During her time in office she pushed to modernize the out-dated social welfare system. She left her mark by making social security universal and improving health care, education, and labor legislation in Portugal.

She contributed the piece &quot;Daring to be different&quot; to the 1984 anthology &quot;Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women&#x27;s Movement Anthology&quot;, edited by Robin Morgan.

Pintasilgo was the first woman to run for president in 1986. She ran as an independent and received 7% of the votes. The following year she was elected to the European Parliament as a member of the Socialist Party which she held until 1989.

From 1992 and for almost a decade, she chaired the Independent Commission for Population and Quality of Life - ICPQL. Hosted by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO, in Paris, the international Commission was established by a coalition of governments and global Foundations in order to make recommendations to be presented to the UN system and donors community. In her statement at the Cairo UN International Conference on Population and Development on Sept, 7, 1994, Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo explained, &quot;The ultimate goal of Population and Development is to accord an improved quality of life to the people of the world. Not only to count people but to ensure that people count in Development&quot;. The commission&#x27;s report was published in 1996 under the title: &quot;Caring for the Future, Making the Next Decades Provide a Life Worth Living&quot;, edited by Oxford University Press.

Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo died of cardiac arrest at her home in Lisbon on 10 July 2004, aged 74. She was buried in Prazeres Cemetery, in Lisbon.

<text>The Selonians (; , from – &quot;highlanders&quot;) were a tribe of Baltic peoples. They lived until the 15th century in Selonia, located in southeastern Latvia and northeastern Lithuania. They eventually merged with neighbouring tribes, contributing to the ethnogenesis of modern Latvians and Lithuanians. They spoke the Eastern Baltic Selonian language.

==History==
Little is known about the Selonians. There is little archaeological evidence and in historic sources the region is often described as a &quot;scarcely populated land&quot;. In written sources they are mentioned only few times.

Archeological data can trace the Selonians back to the beginning of 1st millennium AD when they lived on both sides of the Daugava River. But since the 6th and 7th centuries their settlements can be traced only on the left bank of the river.

Selonian culture had a very strong Latgalian influence. Selonian and Latgalian burial traditions show little difference. Some scholars speculate that during the late Iron Age the Selonians had already partly merged with the Latgalians.

The Chronicle of Henry of Livonia mentions the Selonians at the beginning of the 13th century, when they were conquered and christened. The author of the chronicle describes the Selonians as &quot;Lithuanian allies&quot;.
Their lands were subjects of the principalities of Jersika and Koknese, which were vassals of the principality of Polotsk. The Southern lands however were ruled by Lithuanian lords.

In 1207, the German Brothers of Sword together with their Livonian and Latgalian allies besieged the main Selonian centre at Sēlpils hillfort. Reason for the attack were German claims that Sēlpils hillfort was used as main Lithuanian support base for their attacks in Livonia. After a long siege the Selonians agreed to baptism and German rule and the stone Sēlpils Castle (German: Selburg) was built in place of the hillfort. The Selonians were last mentioned in written sources in the 15th century.

<text>Marie-Laure Henriette Anne de Noailles, Vicomtesse de Noailles (; née Bischoffsheim; 31 October 1902 – 29 January 1970) was a French artist, regarded one of the 20th century&#x27;s most daring and influential patrons of the arts, noted for her associations with Salvador Dalí, Balthus, Jean Cocteau, Ned Rorem, Man Ray, Luis Buñuel, Francis Poulenc, Wolfgang Paalen, Jean Hugo, Jean-Michel Frank and others as well as her tempestuous life and eccentric personality. She and her husband financed Ray&#x27;s film &quot;Les Mystères du Château de Dé&quot; (1929), Poulenc&#x27;s &quot;Aubade&quot; (1929), Buñuel and Dalí&#x27;s film &quot;L&#x27;Âge d&#x27;Or&quot; (1930), and Cocteau&#x27;s &quot;The Blood of a Poet&quot; (1930).

==Early life==
She was born on 31 October 1902, the only child of Marie-Thérèse de Chevigné, a French aristocrat, and Maurice Bischoffsheim, a Paris banker of German Jewish and American Quaker descent. One of her 3x-great-grandfathers was the Marquis de Sade, and her maternal grandmother, Laure de Sade, Countess de Chevigné, inspired at least one character in Marcel Proust&#x27;s &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;. Her nephew, Philippe Lannes de Montebello, was the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Her stepfather was the French playwright Francis de Croisset, and her former sister-in-law, Jacqueline de Croisset, became the third wife of actor Yul Brynner.

==Personal life==
In 1923, after a brief romance with the artist Jean Cocteau, Marie-Laure Bischoffsheim married Charles, Vicomte de Noailles (26 September 1891 – 28 April 1981). He was a son of François Joseph Eugène Napoléon de Noailles and the grandson of Antonin-Just-Léon-Marie de Noailles. His older brother was the 6th Duc de Mouchy, father of Philippe François Armand Marie de Noailles, himself a cadet of the French ducal house of Noailles. Together, the couple had two daughters:
*Laure Madeleine Thérèse Marie de Noailles, later known as Madame Bertrand de La Haye Jousselin (1924–1979);
*Nathalie Valentine Marie de Noailles, who married Alessandro Perrone (1927–2004).

Marie-Laure de Noailles and her husband moved to the fabled &quot;hôtel particulier&quot; at 11 Place des États-Unis in Paris, which was built by her grandfather, Bischoffsheim. Its interiors, which were redecorated in the 1920s by French minimalist designer Jean-Michel Frank, vanished in the 1980s, due to a subsequent owner&#x27;s redecoration and remodeling. In 1936, she acquired Wolfgang Paalen´s object &quot;Chaise envahie de Lierre&quot; in André Breton´s Galerie Gradiva and decorated her bathroom with it. Today, the interiors have been renovated by Philippe Starck and house the Musée Baccarat and the headquarters of Baccarat, the crystal company.

In the 1920s, the Noailles built the Villa Noailles near Hyères. She had an affair with the young Igor Markevitch. In the 1950s, she had a long-term affair with the surrealist painter Óscar Domínguez.

Her portrait was painted by Salvador Dalí in an surrealist style c. 1932

<text>Latgalians (, , modern ; variant translations also include Latgallians, Lettigalls or Lettigallians) were an ancient Baltic tribe.

They likely spoke a variant of Latvian language, which probably became the &quot;lingua franca&quot; in present-day Latvia during the Northern Crusades due to their alliance with the crusaders. Latgalians later assimilated into the neighbouring tribes, forming the core of modern Latvians. 

==History==

The Latgalians were an Eastern Baltic tribe whose origin is little known. In the 5th and 6th centuries, they lived in the eastern part of present-day Vidzeme (west of the Aiviekste River), and later on in nearly all the territory of that region. In written sources, they are mentioned from the 11th century onward. In the first two decades of the 13th century, the (Western) Latgalians allied with German (mainly Saxon) crusaders. Their lands (the Eldership of Tālava, the Principality of Jersika and the Principality of Koknese) were incorporated into Livonia as vassal states.
In the 11th century, Eastern Orthodoxy started to spread in Latgalian lands from Polotsk and Pskov. In the 12th century, Latgalian lands and their rulers paid tribute to the dukes of Polotsk. During the Livonian crusade in the 13th century, Latgalian elders switched from Eastern Orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism and became vassals of the Livonian Order.

Because of the crusade, many regions of Semigallia and Courland were left depopulated. Thus, part of the Latgalians migrated to those regions both during and after the war. Subsequently, between the 13th and 16th centuries, they gradually assimilated into the other Baltic tribes: the Selonians, the Semigallians and the Curonians. These formed the core of present-day ethnic Latvians.

==Archaeological data==

In the lands inhabited by Western and the Eastern Latgalians, about 80 flat cemeteries of Western Latgalian origin have been excavated, with more than two thousand burials uncovered. The first large scale excavations took place in Ludza Odukalns Cemetery in Latgale (1890–1891), where 339 Late Iron Age burials were uncovered. In the excavations at Pildas Nukši Cemetery (in Latgale, 1947–1948), 218 burials were uncovered, dated to the 9th to 12th centuries.

At the Zvirgzdenes Kivti Cemetery (in Latgale: 1948, 1955–1958), 175 burials from the 7th to 12th centuries were excavated. 315 burials were found at Aglonas Kristapiņi Cemetery (in Latgale; 1928, 1938, 1977–1980, 1984–1987, 1999–2000), in use from the late 8th century to the 12th century.

Ērgļu Jaunāķēni Cemetery was totally excavated in 1971–1972, with 89 burials found. At Koknese Cemetery, 102 burials from the Late Iron Age were uncovered (1986–1989). In the area of the Gauja river, two Latgalian cemeteries, Drabešu Liepiņas and Priekuļu Ģūģeri, have been excavated too.

Archaeological excavations have also been carried out on the hillforts of Ķente, Koknese, Sārumkalns, Tanīskalns, as well as on other Latgalian sites. Only a few (Western) Latgalian settlements have been excavated. Large-scale excavations (1960s–1970s) and reconstruction have been done at the Āraiši lake dwelling site (9th century).

In Latgale, dating from the 6th and 7th centuries, there were flat cemeteries as well as barrow cemeteries. In the 9th and 10th centuries, the transition started from flat graves to barrows. There are about 15 excavated Eastern Latgalian barrow cemeteries, but in most of them only a small number of barrows were investigated.

Archaeologically-identified dwelling sites in Latgale include hill forts, settlements and lake dwellings. Among hillforts, the most well-researched one is Jersika Hillfort (excavated in 1939 and from 1990 onwards), forming a complex together with Dignāja Hillfort, on the opposite bank of the Daugava river. Jersika was occupied from the 10th to 14th centuries, probably after the decline of Dignāja, which had been inhabited since the 6th century.

It is possible that ancestors of the so-called Eastern Latgalians migrated to the territory of present-day Latgale between the 7th and 11th centuries, pushed from their previously inhabited territory by Slavic migrations; some archaeologists also believe that the Eastern Latgalians are descended from the more ancient East-Baltic inhabitants of Latvia, who lived in central and eastern Latvia during the &quot;Roman&quot; Iron Age (1st to 4th centuries).

<text>Manchaca ( ) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Travis County, Texas, United States. It is located southwest of downtown Austin. This was a new CDP for the 2020 census with a population of 2,266.

==History==
Early development around Manchaca probably stemmed from the springs in the area. Manchaca Springs are a stopping place along a portion of the Old San Antonio Road and later the Chisholm Trail.

Over time there has been much conjecture as to the origin of the name &quot;Manchaca&quot;. One school holds that &quot;Manchaca&quot; is derived from the Choctaw word &quot;imashaka&quot;, meaning &quot;behind it&quot; or &quot;to the rear.&quot; There are two areas in Louisiana that carry that name: Manchac Pass and Bayou Manchac. However, another theory holds that Manchaca Springs was named for Tejano army officer José Antonio Menchaca. The current pronunciation of the name &#x27;Manchaca&#x27; stems from simple Anglicization.

The springs are referred to as &quot;Manshack Springs&quot; in a collection of memoirs written by an early Anglo settler describing life in 1840s Texas, &quot;Recollections of Early Texas: Memoirs of John Holland Jenkins&quot;. Thomas Falconer, an English explorer who passed through the area in 1841 referred to the springs as &quot;Manjack&#x27;s Springs&quot; in his manuscripts. Early maps and newspaper articles indicate the spelling was &quot;Manchac Springs,&quot; orthography corroborated by maps produced by noted Tejano land agent Jacob de Cordova in 1849 currently housed at the Texas General Land Office in Downtown Austin.

An early owner of Manchaca Springs was Washington D. Miller, a South Carolina native who went on to serve as a Republic of Texas congressman, private secretary to Sam Houston and after Texas joined the Union, Secretary of State of Texas. The first post office to serve the area was the Manchac House post office that opened two miles south of the present-day location of Manchaca in 1851. The office closed the following year. Also in 1852, Miller negotiated the sale of the springs to Virginia native Adolphus Weir who ran a stagecoach stop on the property. Descendants of the Weir family retained land in the area until well into the 20th century.

A second post office, located at the present-day site of Manchaca, operated from June 1874 to May 1875. Afterwards area residents received mail in the unincorporated community of Onion Creek. The area began to grow when the International-Great Northern Railroad opened in 1880; a third post office, called Manchaca, opened. By 1884 the 75-resident community was a shipping point for cotton, grain, lumber, and posts. In the 1890s a Methodist church, hotel, and a school had opened. The common school district serving Manchaca, had three grade schools noted on a 1932 Travis County Engineering Department map housed at the Perry–Castañeda Library at the University of Texas; one for White students located on what is today the northeast corner of FM 1626 and Manchaca Road, one grade school for African American students located at what is today 753 FM 1626, and one grade school for Mexican American students located just off Polk Road near the railroad tracks. These schools became the focus of the community. The district joined forces with the Oak Hill district to form a new high school district in 1961. AISD annexed the entire high school district in 1967.

By January 1903, Manchaca&#x27;s population reached 100 and was home to four businesses: The Blackwell General Store, A. G. Matthews as Blacksmith, R. E. Summerrow General Store, and the Summerrow &amp; Carpenter Cotton Gin. The community had 200 people by the 1960s. In the 1970s the number of residents decreased to 36. Local development increased by the mid-1980s, and accelerated through the early 2000s.

Menchaca Elementary School was built in 1977 at the intersection of Manchaca Road and FM 1626. In 2020 the existing school was demolished and the school was replaced by its newest iteration, located further west on the same property. Paredes Middle School opened in January 2000.

==Transportation==
The main roads through Manchaca are:
* Texas Farm-to-Market Road 1626, running generally west–east; and
* Texas Farm-to-Market Road 2304, also known as Manchaca Road on the south end where it connects to the community of Manchaca, and Menchaca Road from Frate Barker Road to South Lamar Blvd within Austin city limits. In 2019 the northern portion of road within Austin city limits was changed from Manchaca Road to Menchaca Road, in honor of Texas Revolution army officer Jose Antonio Menchaca, whom advocates theorize the community was named after. The community&#x27;s name Manchaca remains unchanged; and
* Twin Creeks Road, running south from FM 1626 from just east of a railroad crossing; and
* Old San Antonio Road, running south from Austin to Buda just west of Interstate 35. 
FM 2304/Menchaca Road realigns along Austin&#x27;s north-northeast—south-southwest axis as it goes into the city limits after crossing Frate Barker Road. FM 1626 connects to Interstate 35 two miles to the east, while it runs west until it reaches Bear Creek, which it winds along and crosses, then heads generally southward until it passes Buda, where it generally curves back eastward until it reaches Interstate 35 once more, just north of Kyle. Twin Creeks Road crosses Bear and Onion Creeks near their confluence, just east of the road from which its name is derived, then curves to run east until it ends at Old San Antonio Road, a branch of the old Camino Real, which runs from Austin west of Interstate 35 and passes Manchaca Springs, an historic spot after which the community is named, just north of the Hays County line and Buda.

<doc id="806242" wikidata="Q543838" url="?curid=806242" title="No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls">
<text>No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls is the debut studio album by Canadian rock band Simple Plan. Formed by members of Reset, Simple Plan spent over a year recording their first album with producer Arnold Lanni. It is a pop-punk record that revolves around being an outcast, drawing comparisons to Blink-182, Good Charlotte and New Found Glory. After signing with major label Atlantic Records, &quot;I&#x27;m Just a Kid&quot; was released as a single in February 2002, with &quot;No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls&quot; following on March 19. It received a mixed reaction from music critics, with some commenting on the lack of originality and others praising the production.

They promoted it with supporting slots for Sugar Ray, Blink-182, Green Day and short stint on Warped Tour. Between support slots for Good Charlotte and the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, &quot;I&#x27;d Do Anything&quot; was released as a single. Preceded by the single release of &quot;Addicted&quot;, the band supported Avril Lavigne, before appearing on Warped Tour again. Their fourth and final single &quot;Perfect&quot; was followed by radio festivals and a co-headlining tour with MxPx in early 2004.

==Background and production==
In 1993, vocalist/guitarist Pierre Bouvier and drummer Chuck Comeau formed punk rock band Reset when they were both 13. The group would later tour Canada with the likes of Face to Face, Ten Foot Pole and MxPx. They released their debut album &quot;No Worries&quot; in 1997; unhappy with the musical direction, Comeau left to attend college. Reset released their follow-up, &quot;No Limits&quot; in 1999. Later in the year, Comeau formed a new band with guitarists Jeff Stinco and Sebastien Lefebvre. Bouvier was going tired of being both a singer and a guitarist; he met Comeau again in late 1999 and joined the latter&#x27;s new band. For some time, Bouvier switched between the new group and Reset, before ultimately leaving the latter.

Bassist David Desrosiers briefly filled Bouvier&#x27;s position in Reset, which impressed Bouvier and Comeau. Desrosiers was interested in joining another band. when he was asked to join the new outfit. As they began touring, they went under the name Simple Plan, and appeared on the 2001 Warped Tour. The band rehearsed material at Rumble Fish Studios, before recording at Arnyard Studios in Toronto, Ontario. Arnold Lanni produced the sessions; he and Ziad Al-Hillal handled recording. There were a number of occasions where Lanni would leave Stinco in charge of recording for a few days at a time, only for him to come back and a scrap everything he did.

Additional recording was done at Select Sound (in Buffalo, New York) and Studio West (in San Diego, California) with Angelo Caruso. The sessions lasted a year to a year-and-a-half, eventually concluding in February 2002. Bouvier said the long process was due to a clash of opinions between the band and Lanni: &quot;He came from a different world than we did, and he wanted to push the quirky, pop side of what we were doing. We were more of the pop-punk guys that wanted to keep it a little more simple.&quot; Lanni wanted Bouvier to sound more whiny, which Lanni felt would help the band sound more unique; Bouvier later regretted this. Caruso, Al-Hillal and Dom Condo did digital editing, before the tracks were mastered by George Marino at Sterling Sound in New York City.

==Composition==
Musically, &quot;No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls&quot; has been described as pop-punk, drawing comparisons to Blink-182, Good Charlotte and New Found Glory. The album&#x27;s predominant theme revolves around being an outcast. The material was written in Comeau&#x27;s basement; Bouvier said they wanted every track to have &quot;[l]ots of power, energy and catchiness.&quot;

The opening track &quot;I&#x27;d Do Anything&quot; was one of the first songs written for inclusion on the album, and includes Mark Hoppus of Blink-182 doing back-up vocals. The members had become friends with Blink-182 when Reset opened a show for them in 1997, and subsequently stayed in contact. The narrator reminisces about a girl from high school later in life, and wondering if life would be different if they stayed with her. It is followed by &quot;The Worst Day Ever&quot;, which sees Bouvier talk about the worst day he&#x27;s experienced. Joel Madden of Good Charlotte provided back-up vocals for &quot;You Don&#x27;t Mean Anything&quot;. Bouvier said he and Comeau wrote &quot;I&#x27;m Just a Kid&quot; about how they felt when they attending high school, namely &quot;feel[ing] like it&#x27;s the end of the world&quot;. Lanni contributed piano to &quot;Meet You There&quot;. With &quot;My Alien&quot;, the narrator divulges his relationship with an extraterrestrial. Discussing the closing track &quot;Perfect&quot;, Bouvier said it was about parents wanting and expecting a lot from their children, such as pushing them into careers they don&#x27;t want.

==Release==
Partway through the recording sessions, they signed to major label Atlantic Records in October 2001. &quot;I&#x27;m Just a Kid&quot; was released as a single on February 4, 2002. The CD version included &quot;One by One&quot; and &quot;Grow Up&quot; as extra tracks. The band wanted &quot;Addicted&quot; as the first single, however, due to a film opportunity, &quot;I&#x27;m Just a Kid&quot; was chosen instead; it ultimately appeared on the soundtrack for &quot;The New Guy&quot;. The song&#x27;s music video was directed by Smith N&#x27; Borin; it features DJ Qualls and Eliza Dushku (both of whom appear in &quot;The New Guy&quot;). The clip shows the pair dating, which ties into &quot;The New Guy&quot;, while the band attempts to impress Dushku.

&quot;No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls&quot; was released on March 19 through Lava and Atlantic Records. Various countries and territories had different bonus tracks: Australia and Japan (&quot;One by One&quot; and &quot;Grow Up&quot;), the US (&quot;Grow Up&quot; and &quot;My Christmas List&quot;), and Europe (&quot;Grow Up&quot; and a live cover of &quot;American Jesus&quot; by Bad Religion). On June 8, a music video was filmed for &quot;I&#x27;d Do Anything&quot; in Toronto, Canada, and additional filming being done in Cleveland, Ohio with Hoppus. &quot;I&#x27;d Do Anything&quot; was released as a single on September 16. The CD version included &quot;Vacation&quot;, a live version of &quot;The Worst Day Ever&quot;, and video for &quot;I&#x27;d Do Anything&quot;.

The Japanese-exclusive live album &quot;Live in Japan 2002&quot; was released on January 21, 2003. &quot;Addicted&quot; was released as a single on February 24. The CD version included a cover of Cheap Trick song &quot;Surrender&quot; and the video for &quot;Addicted&quot;, while the 7&quot; vinyl version included &quot;Surrender&quot; and a demo of &quot;One by One&quot;. The track&#x27;s music video was directed by Smith N&#x27; Borin. In the clip, the band destroy possessions in a room, and ends with an explosion, inspired by an effect in &quot;The Natural&quot; (1984).

&quot;Perfect&quot; was released as a single on August 25, 2003. The CD version included an acoustic version of &quot;Perfect&quot; and a cover of the Turtles&#x27; &quot;Happy Together&quot;. The song&#x27;s video was directed by Liz Friedlander, and sees the group playing on the roof of a house in the rain. On November 25, the video album &quot;A Big Package for You: 1999–2003&quot; was released; it contained footage from the recording of the album and various home videos, alongside the music videos for &quot;I&#x27;m Just a Kid&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;d Do Anything&quot;, &quot;Addicted&quot; and &quot;Perfect&quot;.

The album was included in a package with &quot;Get Your Heart On!&quot; (2011) in 2012. In March and April 2017, the band went on a celebratory 15-year anniversary tour for the album in the US. To coincide with this, the album was pressed on vinyl. It was followed by European leg in May and June, a second US stint in August and September, and Australia and New Zealand in April 2018. A 15th anniversary edition of the album was released, featuring several bonus tracks: &quot;One by One&quot;, &quot;Grow Up&quot;, &quot;Happy Together&quot;, &quot;Vacation&quot;, live versions of &quot;Addicted&quot; and &quot;Perfect&quot;, and an acoustic version of &quot;Perfect&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;m Just a Kid&quot; saw a resurgence in popularity in 2020 due to a challenge on the social media platform TikTok that involves family members re-creating childhood photos.

==Touring==
Following the album&#x27;s release, the band promoted it with a supporting slot for Sugar Ray. In June, the band supported Blink-182 and Green Day on their co-headlining North American tour Pop Disaster. In August, the band appeared on a handful of 2002 Warped Tour dates. Throughout the tour, the band were accused of selling out due to their commercial appeal. Following this, the group toured Australia and New Zealand for two weeks before returning to the US, where they played with Good Charlotte for two weeks. On September 20 and October 8, Simple Plan performed on &quot;Total Request Live&quot;. They played in Canada, prior to a US support slot for the Mighty Mighty Bosstones in November and December. Later in December, the band performed on &quot;Total Request Live&quot; and &quot;Sports Unlimited&quot;.

In January and February 2003, the group appeared on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; and &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;. In March 2003, the band toured the US, with Gob and Madcap, and performed on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;.

==Critical response==

&quot;No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics. AllMusic reviewer Todd Kristel opened his piece by stating the band didn&#x27;t have &quot;anything new to say, but at least it sounds like they&#x27;re having a good time saying it&quot;, being &quot;so full of pep and energy&quot;. The band fails to &quot;break any new ground and doesn&#x27;t stay revved on all cylinders all the time.&quot; Pär Winberg of &quot;Melodic&quot; said he was &quot;so bored&quot; with Blink-182 ripoff acts such as Simple Plan &quot;trying to be funny on the sleeve with a nerd look&quot;. Though the tracks were &quot;so damn good&quot; and the &quot;superb
production&quot; from Lanni gave it a &quot;[g]reat sound all over&quot;. The &quot;lack of originality takes down the grading a bit.&quot; &quot;Exclaim!&quot; Stuart Green said the group disseminated a &quot;trite and derivative brand of inoffensive mall punk&quot; in the vein of New Found Glory and Good Charlotte. With the aid of Lanni, the tracks were &quot;polished to a glossy finish that will undoubtedly find itself a market.&quot;

IGN writer JR viewed it as &quot;harmless bubblegum pop-punk for the junior high set&quot;, and said multiple listens of it were &quot;considerably less taxing on the psyche&quot; than his initial impression. He added that its &quot;shelf-life is remarkably poor and it brings absolutely nothing of consequence to the table&quot;. Hannah Guy of &quot;Chart Attack&quot; said the group &quot;delved into the previously explored-and-pillaged genre of pop-punk&quot;, however, they lacked the hooks of their peers. It was &quot;pretty lame ó and it&#x27;ll likely be one of Canadian music&#x27;s next big exports.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Jon Caramanica wrote that the tracks were &quot;brief, ephemeral, tautly structured, bombastically produced blasts of snotty posing.&quot; Similar to their peers, the band &quot;insist on balancing their immaturity with excuses for their immaturity&quot;.

&quot;No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls&quot; was included on best-of pop-punk album lists by A.Side TV, BuzzFeed, &quot;Houston Press&quot;, &quot;Rock Sound&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Cleveland.com ranked &quot;I’d Do Anything&quot; at number 31 on their list of the top 100 pop-punk songs.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls&quot; was a commercial success. The album peaked at number 8 on the Canadian Alternative Albums Chart, and was certified double platinum. It also peaked at number 35 on the United States &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and at number 2 on the US catalog albums chart. In Australia, it reached number 29.

<doc id="806263" wikidata="Q284294" url="?curid=806263" title="Benedetto Cairoli">
<text>Benedetto Cairoli (28 January 1825 – 8 August 1889) was an Italian politician, who served as Prime Minister of Italy for 2 years.

==Biography==
Cairoli was born at Pavia, Lombardy. From 1848 until the completion of Italian unity in 1870, his whole activity was devoted to the &quot;Risorgimento&quot;, as Garibaldian officer, political refugee, anti-Austrian conspirator and deputy to parliament. He commanded a volunteer company under Garibaldi in 1859 and 1860, being wounded slightly at Calatafimi and severely at Palermo in the latter year. In 1866, with the rank of colonel, he assisted Garibaldi in the campaign in the County of Tyrol, in 1867 fought at Mentana, and in 1870 conducted the negotiations with Bismarck, during which the German chancellor is alleged to have promised Italy possession of Rome and of her natural frontiers if the Democratic party could prevent an alliance between Victor Emmanuel and Napoleon.

The prestige personally acquired by Benedetto Cairoli was augmented by that of his four brothers, who fell during the wars of the &quot;Risorgimento&quot;, and by the heroic conduct of their mother. His refusal of all compensation or distinction further endeared him to the Italian people. When in 1876 the Left came into power, Cairoli, then a deputy of sixteen years&#x27; standing, became the parliamentary leader of his party.

==Prime Minister of Italy; 1st term==

After the fall of Depretis, Nicotera and Crispi, formed his first cabinet in March 1878 with a Francophile and Irredentist policy.

After his marriage with the Countess Elena Sizeo of Trent, he permitted the Irredentist agitation to carry the country to the verge of a war with Austria. General irritation was caused by his and Count Corti&#x27;s policy of clean hands at the Berlin Congress, where Italy obtained nothing, while Austria-Hungary secured a European mandate to occupy Bosnia and Herzegovina. A few months later the attempt of Giovanni Passannante to assassinate King Humbert at Naples (17 November 1878) caused his downfall, in spite of the courage displayed and the severe wound received by him in protecting the king&#x27;s person on that occasion. Agostino Depretis became his successor (details here).

==Prime Minister of Italy; 2nd term==

On 3 July 1879 Cairoli returned to power, and in the following November formed with Depretis a coalition ministry, in which he retained the premiership and the foreign office. Confidence in French assurances, and belief that Britain would never permit the extension of French influence in North Africa, prevented him from foreseeing the French occupation of Tunis (11 May 1881). In view of popular indignation he resigned in order to avoid making inopportune declarations to the chamber.

==Later life==

Thenceforward he practically disappeared from political life. In 1887 he received the knighthood of the Annunziata, the highest Italian decoration, and on 8 August 1889 died while a guest of King Umberto in the royal palace of Capodimonte near Naples.

Cairoli was one of the most conspicuous representatives of that type of Italian public men who, having conspired and fought for a generation in the cause of national unity, were despite their valour little fitted for the responsible parliamentary and official positions they subsequently attained; and who by their ignorance of foreign affairs and of internal administration unwittingly impeded the political development of their country.

==Commemoration==
The Italian &quot;Regia Marina&quot; (Royal Navy) destroyer was named for Cairoli.

The &quot;Regia Marina&quot; destroyer was renamed &quot;Fratelli Cairoli&quot; (&quot;Cairoli Brothers&quot;) in 1921 in honor of Cairoli and his brothers collectively.

<text>Westonbirt, The National Arboretum is an arboretum in Gloucestershire, England, about southwest of the town of Tetbury. Managed by Forestry England, it is perhaps the most important and widely known arboretum in the United Kingdom.

Planted in the heyday of Victorian plant hunting in the mid-19th century as part of the Westonbirt House estate, the arboretum forms part of a site which is listed Grade I on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest.

== History ==
There is evidence of coppicing at the site from 1292. First use of the name &quot;&quot; was in 1309. This was taken from Weston, a settlement to the west of Bowldown Road, and Birt from then lords of the manor, the Bret family.

The arboretum was established in 1829 by Robert Stayner Holford and was later extended by his son George Lindsay Holford. After the death of George in 1926, ownership of the arboretum passed to his nephew, the fourth Earl of Morley, and eventually to the Forestry Commission in 1956 and Forestry England in 2019. The Holford family&#x27;s mansion, Westonbirt House, became a girls&#x27; boarding school in 1927 when it was separated from the arboretum. Westonbirt Arboretum backs onto the Highgrove Estate of Charles III.

== Today ==

Westonbirt Arboretum comprises some 15,000 trees and shrubs, with 2,500 species of tree from all over the world, covering an area of approximately . Its 17 miles (27 km) of marked paths are popular with visitors, and provide access to a wide variety of rare plants. There are two main areas to explore. The Old Arboretum is a carefully designed landscape offering beautiful vistas, stately avenues, and a host of rare and exotic trees from across the globe dating back to the 1850s. Silk Wood is a very different experience: although it also contains many exotic plantings, at its heart is a traditional working woodland, dating back to the 13th century. Dogs are welcome in Silk Wood but not allowed in The Old Arboretum.

Throughout the arboretum, each specimen tree is labelled, either on the trunk or a low-hanging branch. Blue labels indicate Westonbirt&#x27;s &quot;champion trees&quot;, the tallest or largest of their kind in Britain; in 2011 there were 79 of these.

The arboretum is managed by Forestry England, which also manages Bedgebury Pinetum in Kent. Westonbirt Arboretum is supported by the Friends of Westonbirt Arboretum, a registered charity which formed in 1985.

==Location==

Westonbirt Arboretum is in Gloucestershire on the A433 approximately southwest of Tetbury, at Ordnance Survey .

== Music and Festivals ==
From 2003 to 2005 the arboretum hosted Britain&#x27;s first designer-led garden festival: Westonbirt Festival of the Garden.

On 16 July 2011, Irish vocal pop band Westlife held a concert for Gravity Tour supporting their album Gravity.

Also in 2011, &quot;Treefest&quot; was launched. Following several successful years of the Festival of the Tree event, Westonbirt Arboretum refreshed the popular August bank holiday event with camping, music and more activities celebrating trees and nature.

Christmas and the spectacle of bare, sculpted trees in winter is celebrated at the Enchanted Christmas event. From the end of November and throughout December, an evening illuminated trail runs throughout the Old Arboretum, highlighting the beauty of Westonbirt&#x27;s trees in winter.

<text>Wycombe Abbey is a private girls&#x27; boarding and day school in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, England. 

The school was founded in 1896 by Dame Frances Dove (1847–1942), who was previously headmistress of St Leonards School in Scotland. Its present capacity is approximately 650 girls, aged 11 to 18. The current headmistress is Jo Duncan.

The school is on a 69-hectare campus in central High Wycombe. The land includes woods, gardens, a Cold War bunker (RAF Daws Hill) and a lake, and rises up to 150 metres above sea level in the Chiltern Hills. The freehold is owned by the school; the main house and several buildings at Wycombe Abbey are Grade II* listed.

Wycombe Abbey is included in The Schools Index of the world&#x27;s best 125 private schools and among the top 30 senior schools in the UK.

==History==
===Early history===

In the 13th century, the area, with the parish church, was part of the holding of the Abbess of Godstow. 600 years later, the priory at Godstowe was also re-founded as a school by Dame Frances Dove, and today is a &#x27;feeder&#x27; preparatory school for Wycombe Abbey.

On the site of the present Wycombe Abbey was a large manor house known as &#x27;Loakes House&#x27; which was the seat of the Archdale family, until 1700, when Thomas Archdale sold it to Henry Petty, 1st Earl of Shelburne. The earl, in turn, bequeathed the estate to his grandnephew, William Petty, (who inherited a different Earldom of Shelburne in 1761 and became prime minister in 1782). The Shelburnes, though, had a far larger and grander residence at Bowood House in the Savernake Forest and spent little time at Loakes House.

Consequently, Lord Shelburne sold his estates in the area. Loakes House was purchased from them at auction by Robert Smith, 1st Baron Carrington, in 1798. He employed the architect James Wyatt to transform Loakes House into Wycombe Abbey as we see it today. The original house and other parts of the school are listed Grade II* on the National Heritage List for England with the landscaped grounds of the school listed Grade II on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

===World War II===
The Air Ministry requisitioned Wycombe Abbey School in March 1942 to serve as the headquarters of the United States Eighth Air Force after the entry of the United States into World War II. It was returned to Wycombe Abbey on 9 May 1946.

Nicotera was born at Sambiase, in Calabria, in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.

Joining the Giuseppe Mazzini&#x27;s movement of &quot;Giovine Italia&quot; (&quot;Young Italy&quot;) he was among the combatants at Naples in May 1848, and battle with Garibaldi during the Republic of Rome (1849). After the fall of Rome, he fled to Piedmont. In 1857, he took part in the expedition to Sapri led by Pisacane, but shortly after their landing they were defeated; he was severely wounded by the Bourbon troops.

Condemned to death, but reprieved through the intervention of the British minister, he remained a prisoner at Naples and at Favignana until 1860, when he joined Garibaldi at Palermo. Sent by Garibaldi to Tuscany, he attempted to invade the Papal States with a volunteer brigade, but his followers were disarmed and disbanded by Ricasoli and Cavour. In 1862 he was with Garibaldi at Aspromonte; in 1866 he commanded a volunteer brigade against Austria; in 1867 he invaded the Papal States from the south, but the defeat of Garibaldi at Mentana put an end to his enterprise.

His parliamentary career dates from 1860. During the first ten years, he engaged in violent opposition, but from 1870 onwards he joined in supporting the military reforms of Ricotti. Upon the advent of the Left in 1876, Nicotera became minister of the interior and governed with remarkable firmness. He was obliged to resign in December 1877, when he joined Crispi, Cairoli, Zanardelli and Baccarini in forming the &quot;pentarchy&quot; in opposition to Depretis. He only returned to power thirteen years later as minister of the interior in the Rudinì cabinet of 1891. On this occasion, he restored the system of uninominal constituencies, resisted socialist agitation, and pressed, though in vain, for the adoption of drastic measures against the false banknotes put in circulation by the Banca Romana. He fell with the Rudini cabinet in May 1892, and died at Vico Equense, near Naples, in June 1894.

==Ships==
&quot;Giovanni Nicotera&quot; was the name of a destroyer of the Italian Regia Marina, launched in 1926 and decommissioned in 1940.

<text>The Opel/Vauxhall Sintra is an automobile produced under the German marque Opel for the market in Europe between 1996 and 1999. It was sold in the United Kingdom as the Vauxhall Sintra. The Sintra was one of the second generation U-body (known internally as GMX110s) large multi-purpose vehicles (MPV).

It was imported to Europe from the United States of America, where General Motors produced identical models under the Chevrolet, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac brands.

==Name==
Contrary to popular belief, the name was not inspired by the historic Portuguese town of Sintra, rather, it was chosen by a computer from a list of short, easy to pronounce words.

==History==
The Sintra was specifically based on the short wheelbase version of the second generation U platform and has the same wheelbase, front and rear track as the short wheelbase Chevrolet Venture and Pontiac Montana/Trans Sport, and similar exterior dimensions. Along with other U body minivans, it was made in Doraville, Georgia.

ABS was standard as well as dual front airbags, dual front side airbags, and seat belt tensioners. The hood was made of aluminium in order to save weight and increase the crumple zone for safety. It had the largest interior of all the MPVs in the European market, including those from Daimler Chrysler.

The Sintra did not use the LA1 3400 V6 engine like the rest of the U body minivans, but rather a selection of Opel engines (which had to be imported to the United States for assembly). New for this generation were cabin air filters, which can be easily accessed from inside the glove compartment.

The Sintra had an important influence on U body development, because GM wanted to keep it similar in dimensions to European large MPVs (such as the Volkswagen Sharan, Ford Galaxy, SEAT Alhambra, Renault Espace, or the Eurovans). As such, the platform was made quite narrow, which in turn made the GMX110s narrower than the previous &quot;dustbuster&quot; minivans, and more importantly than most American competitors. This influence continued through the third and final generation U body minivans, even though none of them were sold in Europe.

The Sintra featured sliding rear side doors on both sides and was available in different seating configurations, which provided seating for from 5 to 8 passengers.

Unlike its counterparts sold in North America, it offered manual transmission instead of automatic transmission, and had the gear shift mounted directly on the floor like the older generations of European MPVs.

Many reviewers and customers found that the materials, fit and finish were below the usual Opel quality, and also below what European competitors offered – this was only partially addressed by several changes made throughout the model lifetime, like replacing the upholstery fabric for the season of 1997.

==Reliability==
This model proved relatively unreliable.

In both May 2000 and May 2001, by which time it had been withdrawn from sale, the Sintra was ranked as the least satisfying car to own in the J. D. Power &quot;customer satisfaction survey&quot;, covering cars first registered in the United Kingdom, and publishing in the &quot;Top Gear Magazine&quot;.

==Safety==
The Euro NCAP frontal impact crash test performed on a model from 1998 revealed significant deficiencies – the cabin structure proved unstable and the steering wheel (along with the airbag) broke off (unlike the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) test of its North American twin, the 1997 Pontiac Trans Sport, where the steering wheel only moved upward), which might have caused fatal neck injury to the driver, and that the damage to the dummy&#x27;s feet were extremely high.

Despite relatively good performance in side impact tests, the Sintra only managed to score 2.5 stars (3 stars with one struck due to the fatal neck injury hazard).

==Discontinuation==
The reliability and safety issues of the Sintra caused the minivan’s popularity to plummet even further, forcing Opel/Vauxhall to drop the model in April 1999. As the Astra-based Opel Zafira compact MPV debuted at the same time the minivan was officially withdrawn from sale, it is sometimes said that the Zafira replaced the Sintra. The Zafira was a smaller vehicle than the Sintra, but it proved to be far more successful than the Sintra ever had been.

Opel never had a large MPV after the Sintra (until the launch of the &quot;Zafira Tourer&quot; in September 2011). The Chevrolet Trans Sport (which was a rebadged Pontiac Trans Sport very similar to the Sintra) remained available in Europe through 2003 to 2005, depending on the country.

==Engines==
* 2.2 L I4 16V DOHC (X22XE)
* 3.0 L V6 24V DOHC L81 V6 (X30XE)
* 2.2 L DTi-4 16V Diesel (X22DTH): available during its last year of production (1999) with only 1,394 built.

<doc id="806280" wikidata="Q320623" url="?curid=806280" title="Neum">
<text>Neum (, ) is a town and municipality in Bosnia and Herzegovina, located in Herzegovina-Neretva Canton of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is the only town on the Bosnia and Herzegovina coastline, making it the country&#x27;s only access to the Adriatic Sea. As of 2013, Neum municipality has a population of 4,653 inhabitants, while the town of Neum has a population of 3,013 inhabitants.

== Geography ==
Neum is the only town situated along Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s coastline, making it the country&#x27;s only access to the Adriatic Sea.

Neum is northwest of Dubrovnik, south of Mostar, and southwest of Sarajevo, the country&#x27;s capital. 

The Bosnia and Herzegovina coastal strip of Neum cuts off the southernmost Croatian exclave from the rest of Croatia. This is a result of the Treaty of Karlowitz of 1699. Since 1991 and the breakup of Yugoslavia, the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Neum region have been international borders.

===Subdivision===
The municipality includes the town of Neum (municipal seat) and several villages:

Babin Do, Borut, Brestica, Broćanac, Brštanica, Cerovica, Cerovo, Crnoglav, Dobri Do, Dobrovo, Donji Drijen, Donji Zelenikovac, Dubravica, Duži, Glumina, Gornje Hrasno, Gradac, Hotanj Hutovski, Hutovo, Kiševo, Moševići, Prapratnica, Previš, Rabrani, Vinine and Žukovica.

===Border crossings===
Neum has two border crossing checkpoints with Croatia on the European route E65 or Adriatic Highway which connects the two parts of Croatia&#x27;s Dalmatian coast. Neum 1 is located to the northwest of the city, with the Klek border checkpoint on the Croatian side. Neum 2 is located to the southeast, with the Croatian border checkpoint at Zaton Doli.

==History==

The Neum corridor dates back to the Treaty of Karlowitz of 1699, whereby the Republic of Ragusa was separated from the Dalmatian possessions of its rival Venice by two buffer zones ceded by Ragusa to the Ottoman Empire to prevent the possibility of Venice invading via land: north of its territory is Neum and the bay of Klek, and south of its territory is Sutorina with the port of Herceg Novi on the Bay of Kotor, part of Montenegro since 1947 (later the topic of the now-resolved Sutorina dispute).

The Karlowitz borders were reaffirmed in 1718 by the Treaty of Passarowitz, but then the Ottomans, tired of negotiating in vain with Venice for a widening of their maritime access, simply usurped the territory of Gornji Klek and most of Klek from Ragusa, which it had bought from King Dabiša of Bosnia at the end of the 14th century. After the fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797, and the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the Austrian Empire, which had annexed both the Dalmatian possessions of Venice and the territory of Ragusa, tried to buy back the Neum and Sutorina enclaves from the Ottomans, but in vain. Instead, it stationed a warship to block access to the port of Neum until the Treaty of Berlin, which gave the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina to Austria-Hungary in 1878. Neum had been under Ottoman control for 179 years.

Consideration was given to a plan to build a new advanced naval base at Neum-Klek by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. General Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf considered fortifying Neum with coastal batteries and torpedo craft to supplement seafront defenses (in order to prevent Italian raids, or worse a large scale Italian landing). The project never got past the planning stage prior to the outbreak of World War I in 1914. 
In 1918, as a consequence of Austro-Hungarian defeat, Neum joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes which would become the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. Under the Karađorđević dynasty, the Yugoslav Government ignored the historical borders twice: in 1929, when the Neum area was included in the Littoral Banovina, and in 1939 when, following the Cvetković–Maček Agreement, it was included in the Banovina of Croatia. Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s federal Yugoslavia was founded on the principle, declared at the 1943 AVNOJ session in Jajce and comparatively well-respected by the &quot;Đilas commission&quot; in 1945, of establishing the federative republics in their borders of 1878, which is why the Neum enclave is now part of independent Bosnia and Herzegovina, including most of Klek (Ponta Kleka, Rep Kleka), the two islets Veliki and Mali Školj and the rock of Lopata in the Bay of Klek.

Since the 1990s, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina have been in negotiations on how to handle traffic across the Neum region, including signing a Neum Agreement. When Croatia was admitted to the European Union in 2013, the border crossings in the Neum region became governed as external borders of the EU. The construction and opening in 2022 of the Pelješac Bridge, which bypasses Neum entirely, has significance for Croatia&#x27;s integrity and also for its future Schengen Area membership and the EU as a whole. It significantly improves traffic flow and the traffic connection of Dubrovnik to the rest of mainland Croatia, avoiding negotiating long, costly queues at Neum, and strict customs checks twice within the space of .

Encouraged by the recent developments in Croatia–Slovenia border disputes (June 2017), the ruling Bosniak Party of Democratic Action (SDA) and other Bosniak political parties decided to obstruct the construction.

The construction cost was €420 million, to which the EU contributed by allocating €357 million from Cohesion Policy funds. The bridge is among the largest infrastructures in Croatia currently and one of the most substantial EU infrastructural investment ever. The work was completed in mid 2022. The EU is also funding supporting infrastructure, such as the construction of access roads, including tunnels, bridges and viaducts, the building of an 8 km-long bypass near the town of Ston and upgrading works on the existing road D414.

There are Bosniak plans to convert Neum to a freight port, contrary to the wishes of the local population and international laws and agreements concerning the ecologically significant and protected Bay of Mali Ston, of which Bay of Neum is a part. There are plans to build a seaport, rail and a motorway and thus the Croatian bridge must have a high clearance according to the view of Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s Bosniak political parties. Due to the above, the Republic of Croatia has significantly increased the height of the bridge by adapting it to ships whose dimensions cannot enter the Bay of Neum at all. Today the main freight port for Bosnia and Herzegovina is Ploče (in Croatia) farther north, which has a railway to Bosnia and Herzegovina.

==Climate==

The climate of the area is Mediterranean, characterized by mild winters and dry summers, with three times more rain in the rainier than in the drier months, during which the mean precipitation does not exceed . The mean yearly precipitation observed is of . The dominant winds come from the north, north-east and north-west. The average sea temperature (as observed in Neum) ranges from in January to in July and August.

Vegetation is the evergreen Mediterranean type, and subtropical flora (palm trees, agaves, cacti) grow in Neum and its surroundings.
==Demographics==
The settlement is predominantly Croats.

== Culture and sport ==
The linđo is traditionally danced in the Neum region. Neum celebrates the feast of Our Lady of Good Health as its municipal day. As part of the celebrations, Neum hosts the Music Festival Etnofest Neum. The town also hosts the Neum Animated Film Festival.

Neum is home to local branches of the cultural organizations Matica hrvatska and HKD Napredak.
Popular activities include swimming and sun bathing, beach-going, boating, and various other water-sports. Neum has a water polo club VK Jadran Neum, which is a member of the Croatian Water Polo Federation.

There is also an association football club HNK Neum. 


==Tourism==
Neum area has steep hills, stone-sandy beaches, and several large tourist hotels. Neum has about 5,000 beds for tourists, 1,810 in hotels with the remaining capacity in motels, villas, and private accommodation. Tourism in Neum is active only in the coastal region. Prices tend to be lower than in neighbouring Croatia, making it popular with shoppers. Tourism, and the commerce it brings, is the leading contributor to the economy of the area.

The inland area behind Neum has a rich archeological history and wilderness with centuries-old olive groves.

<text>Gentiva Health Services is a provider of home health care, hospice, and related health services in the United States. The company is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. Prior to its October 2014 acquisition by Kindred Healthcare, it was a Fortune 1000 company with over $1.7 billion in annual revenue and a member of the S&amp;P 600 index.

The company offers a range of services, including nursing, physical, occupational, and speech-language therapy, cardiac and pulmonary care, disease, pain management, and other health and medical services.

As of 2024, Gentiva provides health services from more than 590 U.S. locations in 38 states. 

==History==
Gentiva Health Services was founded on August 6, 1999, when Olsten Corporation split off its healthcare assets to form an independent, public company. Olsten Corporation was founded in 1946 by William Olsten. The company grew through the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. In 1971, it began focusing on its health care division under the name Olsten Healthcare. In the 1990s, its health care division began acquiring other companies. The division acquired Upjohn&#x27;s health services division. Following its acquisition of Lifetime Corporation, which included Office Angels, the company became the largest provider of home healthcare services in the nation, operating as Olsten Kimberly QualityCare. In 1995, Olsten Kimberly QualityCare launched CareCentrix. A year later, after acquiring Quantum Health Resources, Gentiva began offering home-based pharmaceutical infusion services. That same year, it acquired NeuroCare Rehab Without Walls, and became the sole national provider of neurorehabilitation for Cigna. It also acquired Nurses House Call. In 1997, it changed its name to Olsten Health Services.

In 1999, Olsten Corporation split its healthcare division into an independent, publicly traded company on the Nasdaq exchange, named Gentiva Health Services. In its first three years of independent operation, Gentiva launched its Gentiva Orthopedics, Gentiva Cardiopulmonary, and Safe Strides programs, and it sold its pharmaceutical services division to Accredo for $415 million in cash and stock and its health care staffing unit to InteliStaf Holdings Inc. and The Carlyle Group. 

The company expanded into hospice with the 2006 acquisition of the Healthfield Group, a home health and hospice provider with 130 locations, for $454 million. In 2008, it launched its neurorehabilitation and senior health programs.

In 2009, Gentiva moved its headquarters from Melville, New York, to Atlanta. By 2010, the company acquired First HomeCare of Houston, Heritage Home Care Services, The Healthfield Group, Gilbert&#x27;s Home Health and Hospice, Physicians Home Health Care, and Hospice of Charleston. In that same year, it acquired Mid-State Home Health, Magna Home Health, and Medicare-Certified offices of Coordinated Home HealthCare. In 2011, the company sold its majority stake in CareCentrix to Water Street Healthcare Partners. In 2011, the company closed or divested 34 home health branches and nine hospice branches and sold its IDOA business to Premier Home Health Care Services, which was acquired Odyssey Healthcare and sold its Rehab Without Walls business to Southern Home Care Services.

The company&#x27;s $1 billion purchase of Odyssey Healthcare was the largest hospice acquisition in U.S. history. In 2012, it acquired Advocate Hospice, Family Home Care Corporation and North Mississippi Hospice. In October 2013, the company acquired Harden Healthcare Holdings and Hope Hospice.

On October 9, 2014, Kindred Healthcare and Gentiva announced that the companies had entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Kindred would acquire all of the outstanding shares of Gentiva common stock. The agreement was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies. The transaction was valued at $1.8 billion, including the assumption of net debt. The deal was officially signed into agreement effective January 31, 2015, with Gentiva becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Kindred Healthcare, operating as Kindred at Home. David Causby was appointed President and Chief Operating Officer of the Kindred at Home businesses, which included home health, hospice, palliative, and community care offerings. 

In December 2017, it was announced that Kindred at Home would be acquired by Humana, along with private equity firms TPG Capital and Welsh, Carson Anderson &amp; Stowe, for approximately $4 billion. In July 2018 the deal was completed and Kindred at Home retained services for home health, hospice and personal care services. 

In August 2021, Humana acquired full ownership of Kindred at Home for $5.7 billion. 

In August 2022, Humana completed its divestiture of Kindred at Home&#x27;s hospice and personal care divisions, which were acquired by Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice (CD&amp;R) and restructured into Gentiva. 

In November 2023, Gentiva completed the acquisition of ProMedica&#x27;s home health, palliative, and hospice business after receiving all necessary regulatory approvals. The deal included the transition of over 4,000 ProMedica employees to Gentiva and plans were made for transition between the companies. ProMedica&#x27;s hospice and home health locations will be rebranded to Heartland Hospice and Heartland Home Health respectively by early 2024, while its palliative care services will adopt the Empatia Palliative Care brand under Gentiva.

==Divisions==
===Hospice===
The hospice division operates in more than 470 locations in 38 states. The division is separated into five geographic regions, which in turn are further separated into geographic operating areas, each of which includes branch locations. 

Hospice includes services for managing pain and symptoms, emotional and spiritual challenges and everything included in the bereavement process.

=== Palliative ===
Gentiva&#x27;s palliative care division has between 400 and 500 patients and enrolled 30 to 50 new patients weekly, as of 2023.

===Home health===
The home health division consists of direct home nursing and therapy services operations. As of 2024 the home health segment operated in 7 states.

<text>Carlo Felice Nicolis, conte di Robilant (8 August 1826 – 17 October 1888), Italian statesman and diplomat, was a native of Turin.

==Life==
He entered the army, and lost his left hand at Novara, where he was &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to Charles Albert, king of Piedmont. He fought in 1859, and reached the grade of general in the Austrian campaign of 1866, after which he served on the delimitation commission. He was chief of the Military Academy, and in 1867 was made prefect of Ravenna to suppress political disorder. He was defeated at Turin in the elections for the Chambrin in 1870, and was sent in 1871 as minister plenipotentiary to Vienna, where he subsequently became ambassador.

He was connected with the Prussian nobility through his mother, he married an Austrian, a daughter of Prince Edmund Clary-Aldringen. In spite of the active part he had taken in driving Austria from Italy, he was a &quot;persona grata&quot; in Vienna, and his policy was steadily directed to an alliance between the two powers. This was accomplished by the secret terms of the Triple Alliance in 1882. He was recalled to Rome in 1885 to become minister for foreign affairs in the Depretis cabinet.

Robilant&#x27;s independent attitude as foreign minister secured greater consideration for Italy from her allies, but he did not adapt himself to the exigencies of domestic politics, and his excessive unpopularity contributed to the downfall of the ministry on February 7, 1887, consequent on an adverse vote on the Massawa question.

Before leaving office, he completed the negotiations for the renewal of the Triple Alliance, and for its extension to cover Anglo-Italian co-operation in the Mediterranean. In the new Depretis-Crispi administration Robilant was not included. He was sent to London as ambassador in the next year, but died two months after his arrival.

<text>Cockaigne or Cockayne () is a land of plenty in medieval myth, an imaginary place of luxury and ease, comfort and pleasure, opposite to the harshness of medieval peasant life. In poems like &quot;The Land of Cockaigne&quot;, it is a land of contraries, where all the restrictions of society are defied (abbots beaten by their monks), sexual liberty is open (nuns showing their bottoms), and food is plentiful (skies that rain cheese). Cockaigne appeared frequently in Goliard verse. It represented both wish fulfillment and resentment at scarcity and Christian asceticism.

Cockaigne was a &quot;medieval peasant’s dream, offering relief from backbreaking labor and the daily struggle for meager food.&quot;

==Etymology==
While the first recorded uses of the word are the Latin &quot;Cucaniensis&quot; and the Middle English &quot;Cokaygne&quot;, one line of reasoning has the name tracing to Middle French &quot;(pays de) cocaigne&quot; &quot;(land of) plenty&quot;, ultimately from a word for a small sweet cake sold to children at a fair. In Ireland, it was mentioned in the &quot;Kildare Poems&quot;, composed c. 1350. In Italian, the same place is called &quot;Paese della Cuccagna&quot;; the Dutch equivalent is &quot;Luilekkerland&quot; (&quot;lazy, delicious land&quot;), translated from the Middle Dutch word &quot;Cockaengen&quot;, and the German equivalent is &quot;Schlaraffenland&quot;. In Spanish, an equivalent place is named &quot;Jauja&quot;, after a rich mining region of the Andes, and &quot;País de Cucaña&quot; (&quot;fools&#x27; paradise&quot;) may also signify such a place. From Swedish dialect &quot;lubber&quot; (&quot;fat lazy fellow&quot;) comes &quot;Lubberland&quot;, popularized in the ballad &quot;An Invitation to Lubberland&quot;.

In the 1820s, the name &quot;Cockaigne&quot; came to be applied jocularly to London as the land of Cockneys (&quot;Cockney&quot; from a &quot;cock&#x27;s egg&quot;, an implausible creature; see also basilisk), though the two are not linguistically connected otherwise. The composer Edward Elgar used the word &quot;Cockaigne&quot; for his concert overture and suite evoking the people of London, &quot;Cockaigne (In London Town)&quot;, Op. 40 (1901).

The Dutch villages of Kockengen and Koekange may be named after Cockaigne, though this has been disputed. The surname Cockayne also derives from the mythical land, and was originally a nickname for an idle dreamer.

The name of the drug cocaine is unrelated: it was named in 1860 by Albert Niemann from the plant coca (Quechua &quot;kúka&quot;) and the suffix &quot;&quot; used to form chemical terms.

==Descriptions==
Like Atlantis and El Dorado, the land of Cockaigne was a utopia. It was a fictional place where, in a parody of paradise, idleness and gluttony were the principal occupations. In &quot;Specimens of Early English Poets&quot; (1790), George Ellis printed a 13th-century French poem called &quot;The Land of Cockaigne&quot; where &quot;the houses were made of barley sugar and cakes, the streets were paved with pastry, and the shops supplied goods for nothing&quot;.

According to Herman Pleij, &quot;Dreaming of Cockaigne: Medieval Fantasies of the Perfect Life&quot; (2003):

==Traditions==

A Neapolitan and Southern Italian tradition, extended to Southern Italian diaspora communities and other Latin culture countries, is the Cockaigne pole (Italian: cuccagna; Spanish: cucaña), a horizontal or vertical pole with a prize (like a ham) at one end. The pole is covered with grease or soap and planted during a festival. Then, daring people try to climb the slippery pole to get the prize. The crowd laughs at the often failed attempts to hold on to the pole.

* The Canadian town of Cocagne, New Brunswick, at the mouth of the Cocagne river, was named after Cockaigne.
* The English village of Cockayne Hatley in Bedfordshire was named after the Cokayne family, who took possession of the land in 1417.

=== Literature ===
* &quot;Ego sum abbas Cucaniensis&quot; (&quot;I am the Abbot of Cockaigne&quot;) is one of the drinking songs (&quot;Carmina potatoria&quot;) found in the 13th-century manuscript of &quot;Songs from Benediktbeuern&quot;, better known for its inclusion in Carl Orff&#x27;s secular cantata, &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; (1935-36).

He describes it as &quot;the East of the West, the China of Europe&quot;, as he describes it as being located to the North and as being possessed of qualities thought of as being essentially &quot;Oriental&quot; by the Europeans of the time.
* The Land of Toys (or Pleasure Island) from &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot; (1883) is said to be located in Cockaigne.
* James Branch Cabell in his &quot;&quot; (1919), has the land of Cocaigne between the lands of sunrise and morning. ch XXIV. &quot;Thus Jurgen abode for a little over two months in Cocaigne, and complied with the customs of that country. Nothing altered in Cocaigne: but in the world wherein Jurgen was reared, he knew, it would by this time be September, with the leaves flaring gloriously, and the birds flocking southward, and the hearts of Jurgen&#x27;s fellows turning to not unpleasant regrets. But in Cocaigne there was no regret and no variability, but only an interminable flow of curious pleasures, illumined by the wandering star of Venus Mechanitis.&quot;
* Clark Ashton Smith wrote a romantic prose poem titled &quot;In Cocaigne&quot; (1922).
* “The Land of Cockaigne” is the first poem in the 2015 book &quot;The Emperor of Water Clocks&quot; by Yusef Komunyakaa, an American poet who won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1994.

<text>The modern Latvian independence movement was the resistance movement to foreign occupation of the Republic of Latvia during Soviet and Nazi German occupation (1940–1991).

==First year (1940–1941) of occupation==

The effects of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 23, 1939 assigned Latvia to the Soviet sphere of influence. On August 5, 1940, the Soviet Union forcibly annexed Latvia. On June 14, 1941, 15,000 Latvian citizens were forcibly deported to Gulag camps and a large number of army officers shot. The occupation and forced annexation into the USSR was not recognised in at least de jure by many countries, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, France, West Germany, Mexico etc. until the restoration of independence.

== Nazi German occupation (1940–1944/1945) ==
Shortly after the start of the German–Soviet War in 1941, the territory of Latvia was occupied and governed as a part of Reichskommissariat Ostland along Lithuania and Estonia. Tens of thousands of Latvian Jews were killed in the Holocaust, along with other local opponents of the regime. Among the underground resistance movement, the Latvian Central Council led the efforts of the resistance movement which strived to restore an independent and democratic Republic of Latvia.

==Anti-Soviet guerrilla warfare (1945–1960)==

After World War II thousands of resistance fighters (including former members of the pre-World War II Aizsargi and 19th Latvian Waffen SS division) participated in unsuccessful guerrilla warfare against the Soviet regime after the reoccupation of Latvia in 1944–1945. Most of the armed resistance was suppressed by 1952.

==The Latvian Third Awakening (1986–1991)==

&quot;Perestroika&quot; enabled Latvians to pursue a bolder nationalistic program, particularly through such general issues as environmental protection.

On June 14, 1987, the group Helsinki-86 organised a ceremony of placing flowers at the Freedom Monument in Riga. This event demonstrated the rebirth of national courage and self-confidence in Latvia.

On July 28, 1989, the Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR adopted a &quot;Declaration of Sovereignty&quot; and amended the Constitution to assert the supremacy of its laws over those of the U.S.S.R. Pro-independence Latvian Popular Front candidates gained a two-thirds majority in the Supreme Council in the March 18, 1990 democratic elections. On May 4, the Council declared its intention to restore full Latvian independence after a &quot;transitional&quot; period; 3 days later, Ivars Godmanis was chosen Council of Ministers Chairman, or Prime Minister.

In January 1991, Soviet political and military forces tried unsuccessfully to overthrow the legitimate Latvian authorities by occupying the central publishing house in Riga and establishing a &quot;Committee of National Salvation&quot; to usurp governmental functions. On January 20, 1991, Riga OMON attacked Latvia&#x27;s Interior Ministry, killing six people. – see January 1991 events in Latvia. Seven OMON members were subsequently found guilty by the Riga District Court and received suspended sentences.

Seventy-three percent of all Latvian residents confirmed their strong support for independence March 3 in an advisory referendum. A large number of ethnic Russians also voted for the proposition.

Latvia claimed de facto independence on August 21, 1991, in the aftermath of the failed Soviet coup attempt. International recognition of renewed independence, including the U.S.S.R. (on September 6), followed. The United States, which had never recognized Latvia&#x27;s forcible annexation by the U.S.S.R., resumed full diplomatic relations with Latvia on September 5 and recognized Latvian independence on September 6.

<text>Lorenzo Annibale Costantino Nigra, Count of Villa Castelnuovo (11 June 1828 – 1 July 1907), was an Italian nobleman, philologist, poet, diplomat, and politician. Among the several positions he held and political and foreign affairs in which he was involved in the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia and Kingdom of Italy, he served as ambassador and was later appointed a member of the Senate of the Kingdom of Italy.

== Biography ==

Nigra was born in Villa Castelnuovo, in the province of Turin, Piedmont. He graduated in jurisprudence at the University of Turin. During the Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states, he interrupted his studies to serve as a volunteer against the Austrian Empire, and was wounded at the battle of Rivoli. On the conclusion of peace, he entered the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia&#x27;s foreign office; he accompanied King Victor Emmanuel II and Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, to Paris and London in 1855. In 1856, he took part in the conference of Paris by which the Crimean War was brought to an end.

After the meeting at Plombières between Cavour and Napoleon III, Nigra was again sent to Paris, this time to popularize a Franco–Piedmontese alliance, Nigra being, as Cavour said, the only person perhaps who knows all my thoughts, even the most secret. He was instrumental in negotiating the marriage between Victor Emmanuel&#x27;s daughter Clothilde and Napoleon&#x27;s nephew, and during the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859, he was always with the emperor. He was recalled from Paris when the occupation of the Marche and Umbria by the Piedmontese caused a breach in Franco–Italian relations, and was appointed secretary of state to the prince of Carignano, viceroy of the Neapolitan provinces.

When Napoleon recognized the Kingdom of Italy in 1861, Nigra returned to France as minister-resident, and for many years played a most important part in political affairs and for Cavour; for his account of the administration of the Neapolitan provinces, Giustino Fortunato judged it an &quot;admirable brave writing ... that is worth so much gold&quot;. During his mandate in Paris, Nigra contributed to the negotiations that led, thanks to the consent of Napoleon, to the conclusion of the Italo-Prussian Alliance in 1866 ahead of the Third Italian War of Independence. In 1870, after his in the battle of Sedan, Napoleon was taken prisoner. As ambassador in Paris, Nigra remained the only friend of the empress Eugénie de Montijo, who was appointed regent. Since the people had risen proclaiming a republic, the French Third Republic, Nigra helped them escape and save themselves. Having become a friend of Virginia Oldoini, Countess of Castiglione, through Cavour, he was later her lover in Paris.

In 1876, Nigra was transferred to St. Petersburg with the rank of ambassador, in 1882 to London, and in 1885 to Vienna. In 1899, he represented Italy at the first Hague Peace Conference. He was created count in 1882 and senator in 1890. Having retired in 1904, he died at Rapallo on 1 July 1907. He was a sound classical scholar, and published translations of many Greek and Latin poems with valuable comments; he was also a poet and the author of several works of folklore and popular poetry, of which the most important is his &quot;Canti popolari del Piemonte&quot;. Shortly after Cavour&#x27;s death in 1861, he was elected as Great Master of the Grand Orient of Italy. In February 1860, Nigra had joined the regular Masonic Lodge Ausonia of Turin.

It is notable for its treatment of contract and of puffery in advertising, for its curious subject matter associated with medical quackery, and how the influential judges (particularly Lindley and Bowen) developed the law in inventive ways. &quot;Carlill&quot; is frequently discussed as an introductory contract case, often one of the first cases a law student studies in the law of contract.

The case concerned a flu remedy called the &quot;carbolic smoke ball&quot;. The manufacturer advertised that buyers who found it did not work would be awarded £100, a considerable amount of money at the time. The company was found to have been bound by its advertisement, which was construed as an offer which the buyer, by using the smoke ball, accepted, creating a contract. The Court of Appeal held the essential elements of a contract were all present, including offer and acceptance, consideration and an intention to create legal relations, and rejected a number of defenses, including puffery.

== Facts ==
The Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. made a product called the &quot;smoke ball&quot; and claimed it to be a cure for influenza and a number of other diseases. (The 1889–1890 pandemic ongoing at the time was estimated to have killed 1 million people, but may have been caused either by influenza or a coronavirus.) The smoke ball was a rubber ball with a tube attached. It was filled with carbolic acid (now known as phenol). The tube would be inserted into a user&#x27;s nose and the ball would be squeezed at the bottom to release the vapours.

The Company published advertisements in the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; and other newspapers on November 13, 1891, stating that it would pay £100 () to anyone who got sick with influenza after using its product according to the instructions provided with it:

Louisa Elizabeth Carlill saw the advertisement, bought one of the balls and used it three times daily for nearly two months until she contracted the flu on 17 January 1892. She claimed £100 from the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company. They ignored two letters from her husband, a solicitor. On a third request for her reward, they replied with an anonymous letter that if it is used properly the company had complete confidence in the smoke ball&#x27;s efficacy, but &quot;to protect themselves against all fraudulent claims&quot;, they would need her to come to their office to use the ball each day and be checked by the secretary. Carlill sued for breach of contract, her counsel arguing that the advertisement and her reliance on it amounted to a binding contract between her and the company, and that the company should therefore pay the promised £100. The company argued that they had made no legally binding offer which was capable of acceptance, and thus there could be no contract.

==Judgment==

The Carbolic Smoke Ball Company, represented by H. H. Asquith, lost its argument at the Queen&#x27;s Bench, which decision was then appealed. The Court of Appeal unanimously rejected the company&#x27;s arguments and held that they had made a binding contract with Carlill. Among the reasons given by the three judges were: (1) that the advertisement was not a unilateral invitation to treat to all the world, but rather an offer restricted to those who acted upon the terms set out in the advertisement; (2) that satisfying the stated conditions for using the smoke ball constituted acceptance of the offer; (3) that purchasing or merely using the smoke ball constituted good consideration, because it was a distinct detriment incurred at the behest of the company and, furthermore, more people buying smoke balls by relying on the advertisement was a clear benefit to Carbolic; and (4) that the company&#x27;s claim that £1000 was deposited at the Alliance Bank showed the serious intention to be legally bound.

===Lord Justice Lindley===
Lindley gave the first judgment. He made short shrift of the insurance and wagering contract arguments that were dealt with in the Queen&#x27;s Bench.

He follows on with essentially five points. First, the advertisement was not &quot;mere puff&quot; as had been alleged by the company, because the deposit of £1000 in the bank evidenced seriousness. Second, the advertisement was an offer made specifically to anyone who performed the conditions in the advertisement rather than a statement &quot;not made with anybody in particular.&quot; Third, communication of acceptance is not necessary for a contract when people&#x27;s conduct manifests an intention to contract. Fourth, that the vagueness of the advertisement&#x27;s terms was no insurmountable obstacle. And fifth, the nature of Carlill&#x27;s consideration (what she gave in return for the offer) was good, because there is both an advantage in additional sales in reaction to the advertisement and a &quot;distinct inconvenience&quot; that people go to when using a smoke ball.

===Lord Justice Bowen===
Bowen&#x27;s opinion was more tightly structured in style, . Five main steps in his reasoning can be identified. First, he said that the contract was not too vague to be enforced, because it could be interpreted according to what ordinary people would understand by it. He differed slightly from Lindley on what time period one could contract flu and still have a claim (Lindley said a &quot;reasonable time&quot; after use, while Bowen said &quot;while the smoke ball is used&quot;), but this was not a crucial point, because the fact was that Carlill got flu while using the smoke ball. Second, like Lindley, Bowen said that the advert was not mere puff because £1000 was deposited in the bank to pay rewards. Third, he said that although an &quot;offer&quot; was made to the whole world, the &quot;contract&quot; was not with the whole world. Therefore, it was not an absurd basis for a contract, because only the people who used it would bind the company. Fourth, he said that communication is not necessary to accept the terms of an offer; conduct is and should be sufficient. Fifth, good consideration was clearly given by Carlill because she went to the &quot;inconvenience&quot; of using it, and the company got the benefit of extra sales.

===Lord Justice Smith===
A L Smith&#x27;s judgment was more general and concurred with both Lindley and Bowen&#x27;s decisions.

==Significance==
&quot;Carlill&quot; is significant for two areas of law: the law of contract, and the doctrine of puffery. Both areas have impacted advertising, and the problem of medical quackery. 

===Law of contract===

&quot;Carlill&quot; is frequently cited as a leading case in the common law of contract, particularly where unilateral contracts are concerned.

It provides an excellent study of the basic principles of contract and how they relate to everyday life. The case remains good law. It still binds the lower courts of England and Wales and is cited by judges with approval. However, in addition to the contractual remedy afforded to users, the same facts would give rise to a number of additional statutory remedies and punishments were an individual to place an advert in the same terms today.

Firstly, misleading advertising is a criminal offence. Under the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations (secondary legislation, passed under the European Communities Act 1972), regulation 5 states that a commercial practice is misleading...

&quot;if it contains false information and is therefore untruthful... or if it or its overall presentation in any way deceives or is likely to deceive the average consumer... even if the information is factually correct&quot;

…in relation to a long list of actions and omissions by sellers. Misleading practices are unfair (r 3) and unfair practices are prohibited (r 4). They are also criminal offences (rr 8-18) and overseen by stringent enforcement mechanisms (rr 19-27). Sellers still have a defence of legitimate &quot;puffery&quot;, or that their representations could not be taken seriously (e.g. &quot;this washing powder makes your clothes whiter than white!&quot;).

Secondly, although it was not discussed in the case, there was evidence at the time that using the smoke ball actually made people more vulnerable to the flu (carbolic acid was put on the poisons register in 1900). The General Product Safety Regulations which are part of a European Union wide consumer protection regime (Directive 2001/95/EC) again provide criminal penalties for unsafe products.

Thirdly, the Consumer Protection Act 1987 (which is also part of EU wide regulation under Directive 85/374/EEC) creates a statutory tort of strict liability for defective products that cause any kind of personal injury or death, or damage over £100. This is the primary method for individuals to get compensation for any loss resulting from products. Similar regimes for product liability have developed around the world through statute and tort law since the early twentieth century, one of the leading cases being &quot;Donoghue v Stevenson&quot;.

Fourthly, under the Enterprise Act 2002, s 8, as in most developed countries, industry members form a trade associations. Businesses are expected to collectively regulate one another by drawing up Codes of Practice and have mechanisms for enforcement before tort or criminal law does.

Viewed with a modern eye, many have argued that &quot;Carlill&quot; should be seen as redolent of another era, not a foundational case in the law of contract. For instance, Professor Hugh Collins writes the following.

&quot;The amusing circumstances of the case should not obscure the surprising extent to which the court was prepared to conceive social relations in terms of contracts. The parties to the alleged contract had never met or communicated with each other directly. Nor had they exchanged goods, money or services between themselves. The law of contract is used by the court as an instrument for discouraging misleading and extravagant claims in advertising and for deterring the marketing of unproven, and perhaps dangerous pharmaceuticals... The judges run through a shopping-list of questions: Was there a promise? Was the promise serious and intended to be acted upon? Was the promise sufficiently definite and certain? Was the promise accepted by the plaintiff? Did the plaintiff perform some action in exchange for the promise?... The generality and abstraction of the rules permit both the extensive utilization of [contract law] and its application to the case, without any discussion of such matters as the moral claims of the parties, the nature of the market for pharmaceuticals and the problems generated by misleading advertising... Its doctrinal integrity helps to achieve legitimacy, because the law can be presented as objective and neutral, not a matter of politics or preference, but a settled body of rules and principles, legitimated by tradition and routine observance, and applied impartially and fairly to all citizens.&quot;

Professor A. W. B. Simpson, in an article entitled &#x27;Quackery and Contract Law&#x27; gave the background of the case as part of the scare arising from the Russian influenza pandemic of 1889-90. He points out that nobody knew what the flu actually was yet, nor how to prevent or cure it. After it was patented, the Carbolic Smoke Ball had in fact become rather popular in many esteemed circles including the Bishop of London who found it &quot;has helped me greatly&quot;. The inventor, Frederick Roe, had advertised heavily when the epidemic hit London, which was getting extensive press coverage. But in the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; (just one instance where he put ads) there were many, many more quack remedies for misunderstood problems. Once the case had been decided by the Court of Appeal, it met with general approval, but especially so from the medical community. The Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain had been fighting an ongoing battle against quack remedies, and had wanted specifically to get carbolic acid on the poisons register since 1882. Although without sympathy for the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company itself, Simpson casts doubt on whether &quot;Carlill&quot; was rightly decided.

&quot;The analytical problems arose in a particularly acute form in the smoke ball case. Thus it seemed very peculiar to say that there had been any sort of agreement between Mrs. Carlill and the company, which did not even know of her existence until January 20, when her husband wrote to them to complain. There were indeed earlier cases permitting the recovery of advertised rewards; the leading case here was &quot;Williams v Carwardine&quot;, where a reward of £20 had been promised by a handbill for information leading to the conviction of the murderer of Walter Carwardine, and Williams, who gave such information, successfully sued to recover the reward. But this was long before the more modern doctrines had become so firmly embodied in legal thinking, and in any event the case was quite distinguishable. It concerned a reward, whereas Mrs. Carlill was seeking compensation. There could be at most only a few claimants for this, but there is no limit on the number of those who may catch influenza. Furthermore, the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company had had no chance to check the validity of claims, of which there could be an indefinite number; much was made of this point in the argument. But the judges were not impressed with these difficulties, and their attitude was no doubt influenced by the view that the defendants were rogues. They fit their decision into the structure of the law by boldly declaring that the performance of the conditions was the acceptance, thus fictitiously extending the concept of acceptance to cover the facts. And, since 1893, law students have been introduced to the mysteries of the unilateral contract through the vehicle of &quot;Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co.&quot; and taught to repeat, as a sort of magical incantation of contract law, that in the case of unilateral contracts performance of the act specified in the offer constitutes acceptance, and need not be communicated to the offeror.&quot;

In a much more recent American case from the Southern District of New York, &quot;Leonard v Pepsico, Inc&quot;, judge Kimba Wood wrote,

&quot;Long a staple of law school curricula, &quot;Carbolic Smoke Ball&quot; owes its fame not merely to &quot;the comic and slightly mysterious object involved&quot; ... but also to its role in developing the law of unilateral offers.&quot;

Leonard had sued Pepsi to get a fighter jet which had featured in a TV ad. Supposedly one might get the jet if one had acquired loads of &quot;Pepsi Points&quot; from buying the soft drink. It was held that Leonard could not get the fighter jet, because the advertisement was not serious. Cashing in &quot;Pepsi Points&quot; could certainly mean various prizes, but the fighter jet thing was really a joke. Kimba Wood distinguished the case on a number of different grounds from &quot;Carlill&quot;, but it is clear that not all advertisements are always to be taken seriously. This leads back to the question of puffery.

==Aftermath==

After the action, Roe formed a new company with limited liability, and started up advertising again. Many people conclude after reading the case that the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company would have been brought down by thousands of claims. The company did not have limited liability, which could have meant personal ruin for Roe. In his submissions to the Court of Appeal, Finlay had used that as an argument against liability. He said that 10,000 people might now be sniffing at smoke balls hoping for their £100, and it would be a travesty to inflict insolvency on this one unfortunate company. But this did not happen at all. In a new advert on February 25, 1893 in the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;, Roe cunningly turned the whole lost case to his advantage. He described the culpable advert, and then said,
&quot;Many thousand Carbolic Smoke Balls were sold on these advertisements, but only three people claimed the reward of £100, thus proving conclusively that this invaluable remedy will prevent and cure the above mentioned diseases. The CARBOLIC SMOKE BALL COMPANY LTD. now offer £200 REWARD to the person who purchases a Carbolic Smoke Ball and afterwards contracts any of the following diseases...&quot;
In the advertisement&#x27;s small print were some restrictive conditions, with a period of 3 months to use the ball and claim, showing that legal advice had been adhered to. Roe left the management of the new company to other new subscribers and directors, who did not pursue such an aggressive advertising policy. By 1895 the company had fallen on harder times, and it had to be wound up in 1896. Simpson suggests that the new management &quot;had failed to grasp the fact that vigorous advertising was essential to success in the field of quack medicine.&quot; Roe himself died at the age of 57 on June 3, 1899 of tuberculosis and valvular heart disease.

The unsuccessful defence counsel in the lower court, H. H. Asquith, went on to become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

Louisa Carlill lived until she was 96. She died on March 10, 1942, according to her doctor, Joseph M. Yarman, principally of old age. But there was one other cause noted: influenza.

<doc id="806317" wikidata="Q2779246" url="?curid=806317" title="Nancy McKeon">
<text>Nancy Justine McKeon (born April 4, 1966) is an American actress. She is known for her roles as Jo Polniaczek on the NBC sitcom &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; and Jinny Exstead on &quot;The Division&quot;.

==Early life and family==
Nancy Justine McKeon was born on April 4, 1966, in Westbury, New York, to Barbara McKeon and travel agent Donald McKeon. She began her entertainment career by modeling baby clothing for the Sears &amp; Roebuck catalog at age two. During some of her childhood, the family resided in Forest Hills, New York in Queens.

==Career==
===Youth===
McKeon appeared on the soap operas &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; and &quot;Another World&quot;. In 1979, she was discovered by a casting director for &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; on the basis of her performance in a Hallmark advertisement, in which she was able to cry on cue. She was cast as tomboy Jo Polniaczek in the fall of 1980 during the show&#x27;s second season after four of the first season&#x27;s cast were dismissed from the show. McKeon also provided the voice for many &quot;ABC Weekend Special&quot; cartoon characters, including the voice for &quot;Scruffy.&quot;

While she was working on &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;, McKeon attended school on-set with tutors, having attended Catholic school prior to that. In an interview with Tom Snyder in 1998, she joked that she &quot;was given detention a few times&quot; for not adhering to the strict rules of school, which included not wearing her favorite patent leather shoes.

===Adulthood===
In 1990, McKeon was courted by NBC executives for the title role in the TV sitcom adaptation of the 1988 film &quot;Working Girl&quot;; the role, played by Melanie Griffith in the movie, instead went to then unknown Sandra Bullock. In 1994, McKeon and Courteney Cox auditioned for the role of Monica Geller on the sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;. The role went to Cox. In 1995, she starred in her own series, &quot;Can&#x27;t Hurry Love&quot;, which lasted one season. In 1998, she starred with Jean Smart in the sitcom &quot;Style &amp; Substance&quot;. 

McKeon portrayed Inspector Jinny Exstead on the Lifetime police drama &quot;The Division&quot; from 2001 to 2004, with her pregnancy incorporated into the storyline of the last year of the series. From 2009 to 2010, she appeared in a recurring role in the Disney Channel Original Series &quot;Sonny with a Chance&quot; as Connie Munroe, the mother of Demi Lovato&#x27;s title character.

McKeon starred in numerous made-for-TV movies in the 1980s and 1990s, including &quot;A Cry for Help: The Tracey Thurman Story,&quot; in which she portrayed the title role of Tracey Thurman, and &quot;The Wrong Woman&quot;, portraying a woman framed for killing her boss. In &quot;Strange Voices&quot;, she portrayed a woman with schizophrenia. She produced many of these movies through her film company, Forest Hills Entertainment (named after her childhood neighborhood, Forest Hills).

In 1999, she wrote and directed her own short film, &quot;A Wakening&quot;. She explained on the TV show &quot;Biography&quot; that directing had always been a personal ambition, so she wrote the movie in order to direct. The film won two film festival awards. She also directed two episodes of &quot;The Division&quot;. 

In 2003, McKeon starred in the film &quot;Comfort and Joy&quot;. 

McKeon has narrated several audiobooks.

She has a brief cameo appearance in 2019&#x27;s &quot;You Light Up My Christmas&quot;, a movie starring her &quot;Facts of Life&quot; co-star Kim Fields. The movie includes other cast members from the show. McKeon was supposed to have a larger role in the movie, but was unable to film more due to a family emergency. Also in 2019, McKeon announced on social media her involvement in a new, planned Amazon series based on the Lauren Oliver young adult novel &quot;Panic&quot;. The first season premiered in 2021.

==Personal life==
While McKeon was on &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;, she and her parents were granted a private audience with Pope John Paul II. She described the experience to interviewer Tom Snyder in 1998 as &quot;electric,&quot; explaining, &quot;In every rendering of every artist, you see this aura that&#x27;s painted around figures...He has that in life.&quot;

McKeon dated actor Michael J. Fox for three years after they met on the set of &quot;High School U.S.A.&quot; (1983). &quot;He and I were very private people,&quot; McKeon told &quot;Biography&quot;. &quot;We didn&#x27;t tell a lot of people, and we kind of kept to ourselves.&quot; McKeon and Fox appeared together as a celebrity couple on the game show &quot;Tattletales&quot;.

In 2003, McKeon married film technician Marc Andrus, after meeting eight years prior on the set of the Hallmark movie, &quot;A Mother’s Gift&quot;. A private pair seeking to keep the event small, the two only had 20 guests at the wedding.

<doc id="806320" wikidata="Q534227" url="?curid=806320" title="Luigi Pelloux">
<text>Luigi Gerolamo Pelloux (; 1 March 1839 – 26 October 1924) was an Italian general and politician from Savoy, born of parents who retained their Italian citizenship when Savoy was annexed to France. He was the Prime Minister of Italy from 29 June 1898 to 24 June 1900, his rule was considered by historians as conservative and militarist.

==Early career==

Pelloux was born in La Roche-sur-Foron, Savoy, then part of the Kingdom of Sardinia. Entering the army as lieutenant of artillery in 1857 he gained the medal for military valour at the Battle of Custoza in 1866, and on September 20, 1870, commanded the brigade of artillery which battered the breach in the wall of Rome at Porta Pia, which enabled Bersaglieri soldiers to enter Rome and complete the unification of Italy. He entered the war office in 1870, and in 1880 became General Secretary, in which capacity he introduced many useful reforms in the army.

He was elected to the Chamber in 1881 as deputy for Livorno, which he represented until 1895, and joined the party of the Left. After a succession of high military commands he received the appointment of Chief of the General Staff in 1896. He was Minister of War in the Rudinì and Giolitti cabinets of 1891–1893. In July 1896 he resumed the portfolio of War in the Rudinì cabinet, and was appointed Senator. In May 1897 he secured the adoption of the Army Reform Bill, fixing Italian military expenditure at a maximum of 9,560,000 a year, but in December of that year he was defeated in the Chamber on the question of the promotion of officers.

==Prime Minister of Italy==
Resigning office, he was sent as Royal Commissioner to Bari in May 1898, where, without recourse to martial law, he succeeded in restoring public order suppressing street demonstrations demanding &quot;bread and work&quot;. Upon the fall of Rudinì in June 1898, after the Bava-Beccaris massacre, General Pelloux was entrusted by King Umberto with the formation of a new government, and took for himself the post Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior. He resigned office in May 1899 over his Chinese policy, 

Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs Felice Napoleone Canevaro had demanded that the Chinese Empire grant it a lease for a naval coaling station at China&#x27;s Sanmen Bay (known as &quot;San-Mun Bay&quot; to the Italians) similar to the lease the German Empire had secured in 1898 at Kiautschou Bay. China refused to comply and Italy had to withdraw its ultimatum, becoming the first and only Western power to fail to achieve its territorial goals in China. The fiasco was an embarrassment that gave Italy – still stung by its defeat at the hands of the Ethiopian Empire in the Battle of Adowa in 1896 – the appearance of a third-rate power. Pelloux and his fellow cabinet ministers stated that Canevaro had acted without informing them, and it was widely believed that king Umberto I was the one who had given Canevaro the orders to acquire a concession in China. 

Pelloux was again entrusted with the formation of a government. His new cabinet was essentially military and conservative, the most decisively conservative since 1876. He took stern measures against the revolutionary elements in Italy. The Public Safety Bill for the reform of the police laws, taken over by him from the Rudinì cabinet, and eventually promulgated by royal decree, was fiercely obstructed by the Socialist Party of Italy (PSI) and Extreme Left. The law made strikes by state employees illegal; gave the executive wide powers to ban public meetings and dissolve subversive organisations; revived the penalties of banishment and preventive arrest for political offences; and tightened control of the press by making authors responsible for their articles and declaring incitement to violence a crime.

The Radicals and Socialist start an obstructionist campaign against the new coercive law using the filibuster: points of order, endless speeches and other procedural delaying tactics. When Pelloux tried to force the law through Parliament by royal decree in June 1899, more moderate politicians like Giuseppe Zanardelli and Giovanni Giolitti that considered the measure unconstitutional, joined the opposition. The growing opposition succeeded in forcing General Pelloux to dissolve the Chamber in May 1900, and to resign office after the general election in June.

==Later career==
In the autumn of 1901 he was appointed to the command of the Turin army corps. He retired in 1905. Pelloux died at Bordighera in 1924.

<doc id="806323" wikidata="Q270438" url="?curid=806323" title="Charles, Count of Valois">
<text>Charles of Valois (12 March 1270 – 16 December 1325), the fourth son of King Philip III of France and Isabella of Aragon, was a member of the House of Capet and founder of the House of Valois, which ruled over France from 1328.

Charles ruled several principalities. He held in appanage the counties of Valois, Alençon (1285), and Perche. He became Count of Anjou and Maine through his first marriage to Margaret, Countess of Anjou. Through his second marriage to Catherine I, Latin Empress of Constantinople, he was titular Latin Emperor of Constantinople from 1301 to 1307, although he ruled from exile and only had authority over Crusader States in Greece.

As the grandson of King Louis IX of France, Charles of Valois was a son, brother, brother-in-law and son-in-law of kings or queens (of France, Navarre, England and Naples). His descendants, the House of Valois, would become the royal house of France three years after his death, beginning with his eldest son King Philip VI of France.

==Life==
Besides holding in appanage the counties of Valois, Alençon and Perche, Charles became in 1290 the Count of Anjou and of Maine by his first marriage with Margaret of Anjou, the eldest daughter of King Charles II of Naples, titular King of Sicily; by a second marriage that he contracted with the heiress of Emperor Baldwin II of Constantinople, last Latin emperor of Constantinople, he also had pretensions to the throne of Constantinople.

From his early years, Charles of Valois dreamed of more and sought all his life for a crown he never obtained. Starting in 1284, Pope Martin IV recognized him as King of Aragon (under the vassalage of the Holy See), as the son of his mother, Isabella of Aragon, in opposition to King Peter III of Aragon, who after the conquest of the island of Sicily was an enemy of the Papacy. Charles hence married Margaret, the daughter of the Neapolitan king, in order to re-enforce his position in Sicily which was supported by the Pope. Thanks to this Aragonese Crusade undertaken by his father King Philip III against the advice of his elder brother Philip IV, he believed he would win a kingdom and however won nothing but the ridicule of having been crowned with a cardinal&#x27;s hat in 1285, which gave him the alias of the &quot;King of the Cap.&quot; He would never dare to use the royal seal which was made on this occasion and had to renounce the title.

Amid the Gascon and Franco-Flemish Wars, Charles commanded effectively in Flanders in 1297.

=== Campaign in Italy and Invasion of Sicily ===

Dreaming of an imperial crown, in 1301 Charles married the titular empress of Constantinople, Catherine of Courtenay. The marriage drew Charles closer to the papacy, as his new marriage needed the connivance of Pope Boniface VIII. Boniface saw Charles as a potential ally and tool to further papal influence; the pope desired to re-install a Catholic ruler on the throne of the Byzantine Empire and thus revive the Latin Empire, which Charles now had a claim to. Boniface was also eager to end the nearly 20-year long war between the papacy, Angevin Naples, and Sicily, and so hoped to have Charles&#x27; army invade Sicily.

Named papal vicar, Charles of Valois led a private French army into Italy. However, he soon lost himself in the complexity of Italian politics, namely the generational feud between the Guelphs and Ghibellines. Local nobles and church officials used his army as a tool against their political rivals, and men under his command massacred a crowd in Florence. When his army landed on the shores of Sicily in May 1302, it faced heavy resistance from the Sicilian population. Charles&#x27; army pushed inland, but became mired in attritional warfare in the hot Sicilian summer; after a disastrous attempt to besiege Sciacca, Charles&#x27; army found itself out of supplies and surrounded on the southern coast of Sicily. Rather than see his army destroyed, Charles negotiated the Peace of Caltabellotta with the Sicilian leadership, thus ending the war of the Vespers. The Sicilian campaign had been a disaster; Charles&#x27; battered army had been forced to evacuate the island without having fought a major battle, and the treaty ended Angevin and papal attempts to re-conquer Sicily.

==== Charles of Valois and Byzantium ====
After his marriage to Catherine, Charles decided to reclaim his wife&#x27;s empire. To fulfil this eastern ambition he had to secure the support of all those influential political figures of the time. The first and foremost was his brother, Philip IV of France.

Indeed, Philip promised to help his brother and gave assurances that he would do so by offering him some money, but in reality, he was too enmeshed in the war with Flanders which was at a critical point as the French had suffered a major disaster at the battle of Courtrai in 1302 to seriously consider a crusader expedition to Byzantium, not least his conflict with pope Boniface VIII which erupted in 1302. Boniface VIII&#x27;s publication of the bull &quot;Unam Sanctam&quot; in November 1302 which asserted the papal supremacy precipitated the crisis with the king of France. Following the publication of the bull Philip IV went on to publish a series of forged letters dated on 5 December to induce the national feeling of the French clergy and people. To be sure, the French king and his officials Guillame de Nogaret and Guillame de Plaisians condemned the pope in two assemblies that took place in March and June 1303 in Paris in front of the French the prelature and nobility. On his behalf Charles of Valois tried to mediate the situation between his brother and the pope but to no avail. The &quot;outrage of Anagni&quot; followed and the death of pope Boniface VIII thereon.

While in Sicily, where he negotiated the Peace of Caltabellotta, Charles of Valois confirmed and renewed an anti-Byzantine treaty with Charles II, king of Naples in Viterbo, on March 11, of 1302. Charles then turned to the Robert II, Duke of Burgundy who, after having inherited from his father Hugh IV the rights to the kingdom of Thessalonica, conferred on the latter in 1266 by Baldwin II, the Latin emperor, had started showing interest on the matter by 1303. The son of Robert II, Hugh in the meantime swore allegiance to the titular empress Catherine of Courtenay, wife of Charles of Valois and on March 24, 1303 he became affianced to their daughter Catherine of Valois. Necessary precondition for this marriage alliance to take place was the young man to promise the recovery of his prospective wife inheritance and his future &quot;kingdom&quot;. Some two years later in January 1305 the couple, Charles of Valois and Catherine of Courtenay confirmed Hugh V, Duke of Burgundy as in possession of the kingdom of Thessalonica. Insofar as Charles of Valois might really recover Constantinople the marriage of the issue of Valois-Courtenay and the confirmation of Hugh were of significance to the House of Burgundy because that would eventually make Hugh an emperor. That potential relationship to work, however, needed first the investment in material support with men and money from the House of Burgundy.

As any other crusader expedition such a plan needed papal endorsement and a plan for the conquest of Constantinople was no less a crusade since the Greeks were heretics and schismatics, thus the project was a very desirable enterprise and the pope was more favourable than not to such a possibility. On the other hand, the fall of Acre in 1291 to the Mamluks had reinvigorated crusader zeal in Western Europe and countless theoretic crusading projects were published and presented to successive popes for that matter from 1291 up to 1330. A profound discrepancy of objectives surfaces here which meant that the pope had to be convinces for such a crucial shift to take the stead of the primary enterprise, the recapture of Jerusalem. Thus, Charles of Valois requested the aid of the new pope, Benedict XI. His shortlived papacy did not amount to anything more than the grant of a tithe. The situation took a decisive turn in January 1305 with the election of Pope Clement V, who, as a French himself, was well disposed towards the royal house of France and eager to restore good relations with Philip IV and his family. With a rather positive climate of peace and cooperation with Philip IV, Clement V and Charles of Valois expedited things in approximately two years time and the crusade now seemed more than merely plausible. Suffice here to note that the stance of emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos who repudiated the Union of the churches that had been proclaimed at the Second Council of Lyons in 1274, offered the necessary justification to set in motion the papal propaganda machinery. That reason along with the faltered policies of the emperor in Asia Minor established the meaningful link that saw the recapture of Jerusalem as the afterthought of an elevated morale. Significantly, however, it had translated the wishful expedition of Charles of Valois to a crusade project which he eventually proclaimed.

The papal support aside, Charles of Valois had to win the maritime powers of Venice and Genoa since the insurmountable problem of his project was the logistics. Clement V mediated to Venice by writing to Doge Pietro Gradenigo, exhorting him to help Charles and tried to lure him into the latter&#x27;s project by offering the privileges of the crusaders should they participate. By the same token he also wrote to Genoa advising them that the time had come for the Greeks to be brought back to the true faith. On his behalf Charles of Valois sent his emissaries to Genoa to appeal for assistance and to get a quote for the shipping costs of his prospective campaign and whether the commune was interested in allowing Charles to hire those ships. Genoa&#x27;s interest by this time and on the face of its imperiled position in the East by the Catalan Company had been inseparable from those of the empire of Constantinople, so the decline of Charles&#x27; request in 1306 was the only possible stance. On the contrary, Venice, being hostile to the empire and Genoa alike, accepted Charles of Valois&#x27;s proposals which culminated in a treaty on 19 December 1306. To further aid the cause, the pope on 3 June 1307 excommunicated Andronikos II and warned the rest of the Catholic powers that they too were facing excommunication should they help the emperor, not least forfeit their property to the church.

The European alliances notwithstanding, Charles of Valois tried to secure backing for his plans from various powers in the East, that is the Catalan Company which was a redoubtable army to be reckoned with as time and again it had proved. The Company&#x27;s frivolous allegiance to Frederick III allowed for its opportunism as did the lack of competent leadership. Indeed, under their new leader at the time, Berengar de Rocafort, the Catalan Company became a vassal of Charles of Valois in summer of 1307. This development conditioned the attitude of the Serbs, who under their king Stephen Uroš II Milutin established connections with Charles of Valois that culminated in the treaty of Lys on March 27, of 1308. Last in this broader scheme of allies to enter were the malcontents in the empire of Constantinople, genuine unionists, enemies of Andronikos II and men who feared more the Turks than they did the French. The documented negotiations with these Byzantine supporters lasted from summer 1307 to spring 1310 and some of their names are known: John and Constantine Monomachos, siblings of whom the former was the commander of the armed forces of Thessaloniki, a certain Constantine Limpidaris identifiable with the and Libadarios, and the monk Sophonias. Concurrently to these four, the archbishop of Andrianople Theoktistos was also of some import to the negotiations with Charles of Valois as he appears to have been in Paris for over five months for that matter. Understandably, the prime concern behind those figures&#x27; action was to find an able defender for the Asia Minor front against Turkish aggressiveness, and their best possible candidate at that particular time was apparently Charles of Valois. The conclusion of his eastern alliances came with the unionist fraction of the Armenian kingdom, that requested for Charles&#x27;s help and made certain concessions to the Roman Catholic church by 1307.

Charles&#x27;s expedition was to be launched between March 1307 and March 1308. However, after 1308 there was a diminution of diplomatic activity and gradual abandonment of his plans of conquest, which in part was owed to the candidature he was offered for the throne of the Holy Roman Empire after the German king&#x27;s assassination in 1308. Besides, the death of wife Catherine of Courtenay in the same year played substantial role and along with a number of events that had occurred in the meantime weighted heavy towards the abort of the plan.

=== Claimant to French throne ===
Charles was back in shape to seek a new crown when the German King Albert I of Germany was murdered in 1308. Charles&#x27;s brother King Philip IV, who did not wish to take the risk himself of a check and probably thought that a French puppet on the imperial throne would be a good thing for France, encouraged him. The candidacy was defeated with the election of Henry VII of Luxembourg as German king, for the electors did not want France to become even more powerful. Charles thus continued to dream of the eastern crown of the Courtenays.

He did benefit from the affection which his brother King Philip, who had suffered from the remarriage of their father, brought to his only full brother, and Charles thus found himself given responsibilities which largely exceeded his talent. Thus it was he who directed, in 1311, the royal embassy to the conferences of Tournai with the Flemish; he quarreled there with his brother&#x27;s chamberlain Enguerrand de Marigny, who openly defied him. Charles did not pardon the affront and would continue the vendetta against Marigny after his brother King Philip&#x27;s death.

In 1314, Charles of Valois was doggedly opposed to the torture of Jacques de Molay, grand master of the Templars.

The premature death of Charles&#x27;s nephew, King Louis X of France, in 1316, gave Charles hopes for a political role. However, he could not prevent his nephew (Louis X&#x27;s younger brother) Philip the Tall from taking the regency while awaiting the birth of Louis&#x27;s posthumous child. Louis&#x27;s son died a few days after his birth, and Philip took the throne as King Philip V. Charles was initially opposed to Philip&#x27;s succession, for Philip&#x27;s elder brother had left behind a daughter, Joan of France, his only surviving child. However, Charles later switched sides and eventually backed his nephew Philip, probably realizing that Philip&#x27;s precedent would bring him and his line closer to the throne.

=== War against England ===
In 1324, Charles commanded with success the army of his nephew, King Charles IV of France (who succeeded his elder brother King Philip V in 1322), to take Guyenne and Flanders from King Edward II of England. He contributed, by the capture of several cities, to accelerate the peace, which was concluded between the King of France and his sister Isabella, the queen-consort of England as the wife of King Edward II.

The Count of Valois died on 16 December 1325 at Nogent-le-Roi, leaving a son who would take the throne of France under the name of Philip VI and commence the branch of the Valois. Had he survived for three more years and outlived his nephew King Charles IV, Charles might have become king of France. Charles was buried in the now-demolished church of the Couvent des Jacobins in Paris – his effigy is now in the Basilica of St Denis.

==Marriages and children==

Charles was married three times.

His first marriage in Aug 1290, was to Margaret, Countess of Anjou and Maine (1272–1299), daughter of King Charles II of Naples. They had the following children:

Finally, in 1308, he married Mahaut of Châtillon (1293–1358), daughter of Guy IV of Châtillon, Count of Saint-Pol. They had:
* Marie of Valois, Duchess of Calabria (1309 – 28 October 1332); married Duke Charles of Calabria and had issue.
* Isabella of Valois, Duchess of Bourbon (1313 – 26 July 1383). She married Duke Peter I of Bourbon.
* Blanche of Valois, Queen of Germany and Bohemia (1317–1348); married King Charles IV of Germany and Bohemia who later became Holy Roman Emperor after her death. She was sometimes called &quot;Marguerite&quot;.

<text>The 1985–86 network television schedule for the three major English language commercial broadcast networks in the United States covers primetime hours from September 1985 through August 1986. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series cancelled after the 1984–85 season.

This was also the first television season wherein the Nielsen people meter technology was used for the nationwide audience measurement system, largely replacing the diaries system in place from the 1950-1951 television season.

PBS is not included; member stations have local flexibility over most of their schedules and broadcast times for network shows may vary.

Each of the 30 highest-rated shows released in May 1986 is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.

New series are highlighted in bold.

Repeat airings or same-day rebroadcasts are indicated by .

All times are U.S. Eastern and Pacific Time (except for some live sports or events). Subtract one hour for Central, Mountain, Alaska and Hawaii–Aleutian times.

Most of the ratings come from AmericanRadioHistory.com&#x27;s PDF archive.

<doc id="806337" wikidata="Q920212" url="?curid=806337" title="Welfare Party">
<text>The Welfare Party (, RP) was an Islamist political party in Turkey. It was founded by Ali Türkmen, Ahmet Tekdal, and Necmettin Erbakan in Ankara in 1983 as heir to two earlier parties, National Order Party (MNP) and National Salvation Party (MSP), which were banned from politics. The RP participated in mayoral elections at that time and won in three cities Konya, Şanlıurfa, and Van. Their vote percentage was approximately 5%.

The Welfare Party participated in the 1991 elections in a triple alliance with the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and the Reformist Democracy Party (IDP). They gained 16.9% of the vote. They won 62 deputies to parliament, but 19 deputies of MHP (with founding Democratic Movement Party on 25 December 1991 and joining the MÇP on 29 December 1991) and 3 of IDP left the Welfare Party after the election. Their popular vote increased over the years until they became the largest party under Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan in 1996. The coalition government of Erbakan was forced out of power by the Turkish military in 1997, due to being suspected of having an Islamist agenda.

In 1998, the Welfare Party was banned from politics by the Constitutional Court of Turkey for violating the separation of religion and state. The ban was upheld by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) on 13 February 2003. The ECtHR&#x27;s decision was criticized by Human Rights Watch for lack of consistency, as the ECtHR had refused disbanding of other parties on several occasions, but the ECtHR defended its decision.

Turkey&#x27;s incumbent president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, is a former member of the party. After being banned from politics for a period, he left this Islamist group and founded the Justice and Development Party (AKP). Abdullah Gül, the former President of Turkey, was the deputy leader of the Welfare Party until its dissolution

== Dissolution ==
The Welfare Party came into the political sphere at a time when the impoverished public was discontented with the current government. Relying on Islamic rhetoric, they encouraged certain aspects of sharia law. Turkey, as a secular state, took issue with their religious narrative. Article 2.1 of the Turkish Constitution states that Turkey is a “democratic, secular, and social state.” Refah’s theocentric policy and speeches violated this commitment to secularism.  On January 16, 1998, the Constitutional Court dissolved the Welfare Party because it had become a “center of activities against the principle of secularism.”

The Welfare Party then appealed to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), stating that the Turkish Supreme Court violated Article 11 of the European Convention of Human Rights that protects assembly and association. Refah also complained that its rights protected in Articles 9, 10, 14, 17, and 18 of the Convention and Articles 1 and 3 of Protocol No. 1 had been violated.

Paragraph 2 of Article 11 states that if free speech rights are limited, and both parties agreed that they had been, it must be “necessary in a democratic society.” The court found that Article 9, which protects freedom of religion, did not protect the Welfare Party from the fact that their policies went directly against the Turkish Constitution. They explained that a political party may campaign for a change in the constitution under two regulations: the campaigning must be done in a democratic and legal manner, and that the change itself must protect fundamental democratic principles. The court concluded that the Welfare Party’s political agenda did not uphold these two standards. The Welfare Party’s religious roots were considered to be detrimental to the protection of democracy.

The Welfare Party’s ban was the first in a number of party bans in Turkey due to religious circumstances. Turkey’s commitment to progress, unity, and democracy in its early years meant that they often dismantled organizations that threatened any of these three pillars. Therefore, any separatist or generally revolutionary party threatened Turkish politics and was banned in the Constitutional Court and was deemed an illegal party. Turkey’s current Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was originally a member of the Welfare Party, and he used his status as a Islamist leader to garner support for his current party, the Justice and Development Party. The string of party bans made way for the Justice and Development Party to gain religious and political control.

==Lost Trillion Case==

After the closure of the party, the Treasury demanded the return of grants worth around one trillion lira, i.e. one million in today&#x27;s currency (around 99,796). Party officials stated that the funds were spent on party activities. However, an investigation revealed that the official documents were forged.

In the beginning of 1999, Necmettin Erbakan and 78 party officials stood trial in Ankara for embezzlement charges. The case became known as the &quot;Lost Trillion Case&quot; or the &quot;Missing Trillion Case&quot; (). In March 2002, the court sentenced Erbakan to two years and four months in prison. 68 party officials received sentences of up to one year and two months in prison. The sentences were approved by the Supreme Court of Appeals. The European Court of Human Rights upheld the ban as well.

== Foreign policy ==

=== Algerian Civil War ===
In the 1990s, both Algeria and Turkey had similar tensions between Islamists and a secular military. The Algerian military&#x27;s intervention led to the repression of FIS and the subsequent Algerian Civil War in 1992, and the Turkish military forced the resignation of the Erbakan government and banned the Welfare Party. Referring to the Civil War, Necmettin Erbakan said &quot;Turkey will not turn into Algeria&quot; in 1992 and in 1997. However, on 10 May 1997, Welfare Party Şanlıurfa MP İbrahim Halil Çelik threatened that &quot;If you try to close the İmam Hatip schools under the RP government, blood will be spilled. It would be worse than Algeria.&quot; Erbakan and his associates developed ties with FIS, and when Erbakan visited the American Muslim Council in October 1994, he engaged with FIS representatives.

<doc id="806343" wikidata="Q378706" url="?curid=806343" title="Vincenzo Gioberti">
<text>Vincenzo Gioberti (; 5 April 180126 October 1852) was an Italian Catholic priest, philosopher, publicist and politician who served as the Prime Minister of Sardinia from 1848 to 1849. He was a prominent spokesman for liberal Catholicism.

==Biography==
Gioberti was born in Turin, Italy. When very young he lost his parents, and at the age of sixteen was admitted among the clerics of the court. He studied theology at the University of Turin, and obtained his doctorate there.

He was educated by the fathers of the Oratory with a view to the priesthood and ordained in 1825. In 1828, he made a journey through Lombardy, and became friendly with Alessandro Manzoni. Partly under the influence of Giuseppe Mazzini, the freedom of Italy became his ruling motive in life, its emancipation, not only from foreign masters, but from modes of thought alien to its genius, and detrimental to its European authority. This authority was in his mind connected with papal supremacy. Though in a way quite intellectual rather than political. This leitmotif informs nearly all his writings, and also his political position with respect to the ruling clerical party—the Jesuits—and the court of Piedmont after the accession of Charles Albert in 1831.

Gioberti was noticed by the king and made one of his chaplains. His popularity and private influence were reasons enough for the court party to mark him for exile: he was not one of them, and could not be relied upon. Knowing this, he resigned his office in 1833, but was suddenly arrested on a charge of conspiracy. Shortly after, he was imprisoned for four months and was banished without a trial. Gioberti first went to Paris, and a year later, to Brussels where he remained until 1845. In Brussels, he taught philosophy and assisted a friend in the work of a private school. He found time to write many works of philosophical importance, with special reference to his country and its position.

In 1841, on the appearance of his book &quot;Del Buono&quot;, the Grand Duke of Tuscany offered him a chair at the University of Pisa, but King Charles Albert objected, and the offer came to nothing. His fame in Italy dates from 1843 when he published his &quot;Del primato morale e civile degli Italiani&quot;, which he dedicated to Silvio Pellico. Starting with the greatness of ancient Rome he traced history down through the splendours of the papacy, and recounting all that science and art owed to the genius of Italy, he declared that the Italian people were a model for all nations, and that their then insignificance was the result of their weakness politically, to remedy which he proposed a confederation of all the states of Italy with the pope as their head.

An amnesty was declared by Charles Albert in 1846, and Gioberti (who was again in Paris) was at liberty to return to Italy but refused to do so until the end of 1847. On his entrance into Turin on 29 April 1848 he was received with the greatest enthusiasm. He refused the dignity of senator offered him by Charles Albert, preferring to represent his native town in the Chamber of Deputies, of which he was soon elected president. At the close of the same year, a new ministry was formed, headed by Gioberti. With the accession of Victor Emmanuel in March 1849, his active life came to an end. For a short time, he held a seat in the cabinet, though without a portfolio. An irreconcilable disagreement soon followed, and his removal from Turin was accomplished by his appointment on a mission to Paris, whence he never returned. There, refusing the pension which had been offered him and all ecclesiastical preferment, he lived frugally, and spent his days and nights as at Brussels in literary labour. He died suddenly, of apoplexy, on 26 October 1852.

==Works and Philosophy==

The following assessment is attributed to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition.

Gioberti&#x27;s writings are more important than his political career. In the general history of European philosophy, they stand apart. As the speculations of Rosmini-Serbati, against which he wrote, have been called the last link added to medieval thought, so the system of Gioberti, known as Ontologism, more especially in his greater and earlier works, is unrelated to other modern schools of thought. It shows a harmony with the Roman Catholic faith which caused Cousin to declare that Italian philosophy was still in the bonds of theology, and that Gioberti was no philosopher.

Method is with him a synthetic, subjective and psychological instrument. He reconstructs, as he declares, ontology, and begins with the ideal formula, the &quot;Ens&quot; creates &quot;ex nihilo&quot; the existent. God is the only being (Ens); all other things are merely existences. God is the origin of all human knowledge (called l&#x27;idee, thought), which is one and so to say identical with God himself. It is directly beheld (intuited) by reason, but in order to be of use it has to be reflected on, and this by means of language. A knowledge of being and existences (concrete, not abstract) and their mutual relations, is necessary at the beginning of philosophy.

Gioberti is in some respects a Platonist. He identifies religion with civilization, and in his treatise &quot;Del primato morale e civile degli italiani&quot; arrives at the conclusion that the church is the axis on which the well-being of human life revolves. In it, he affirms the idea of the supremacy of Italy, brought about by the restoration of the papacy as a moral dominion, founded on religion and public opinion. In his later works, the &quot;Rinnovamento&quot; and the &quot;Protologia&quot;, he is thought by some to have shifted his ground under the influence of events.

His first work, written when he was thirty-seven, had a personal reason for its existence. A young fellow-exile and friend, Paolo Pallia, having many doubts and misgivings as to the reality of revelation and future life, Gioberti at once set to work with &quot;La Teorica del sovrannaturale&quot;, which was his first publication (1838). After this, philosophical treatises followed in rapid succession. The &quot;Teorica&quot; was followed by &quot;Introduzione allo studio della filosofia&quot; in three volumes (1839–1840). In this work, he states his reasons for requiring a new method and new terminology. Here he brings out the doctrine that religion is the direct expression of the idea in this life, and is one with true civilization in history. Civilization is a conditioned mediate tendency to perfection, to which religion is the final completion if carried out; it is the end of the second cycle expressed by the second formula, the Ens redeems existences.

Essays (not published till 1846) on the lighter and more popular subjects, &quot;Del bello&quot; and &quot;Del buono&quot;, followed the &quot;Introduzione&quot;. &quot;Del primato morale e civile degli Italiani&quot; and the &quot;Prolegomeni&quot; to the same, and soon afterwards his triumphant exposure of the Jesuits, &quot;Il Gesuita moderno&quot;, no doubt hastened the transfer of rule from clerical to civil hands. It was the popularity of these semi-political works, increased by other occasional political articles, that caused Gioberti to be welcomed with such enthusiasm on his return to his native country. All these works were perfectly orthodox and aided in drawing the liberal clergy into the movement which has resulted since his time in the unification of Italy.

In the wake of the failure of the 1848 revolutions and the papacy&#x27;s increasingly reactionary turn, Gioberti published &quot;Il Rinnovamento civile d’Italia&quot;, in which he bitterly attacked the Jesuits, Italy&#x27;s reactionary clergy, and Piedmont&#x27;s timid monarchy. Something of Gioberti&#x27;s early optimism lived on among the liberal aristocrats and Catholic intellectuals such as Antonio Rosmini, Cesare Balbo, and Massimo d&#x27;Azeglio who afterwards turned to support the national aspirations of Piedmont&#x27;s liberal monarchy.

The Jesuits, however, closed round the pope more firmly after his return to Rome, and in the end, Gioberti&#x27;s writings were placed on the Index. The remainder of his works, especially &quot;La Filosofia della Rivelazione&quot; and &quot;Prolologia&quot;, give his mature views on many points.

<doc id="806349" wikidata="Q2090933" url="?curid=806349" title="Yugoslav Committee">
<text>The Yugoslav Committee (, , ) was a World War I-era, unelected, &quot;ad-hoc&quot; committee. It largely consisted of émigré Croat, Slovene, and Bosnian Serb politicians and political activists whose aim was the detachment of Austro-Hungarian lands inhabited by South Slavs and unification of those lands with the Kingdom of Serbia. The group was formally established in 1915 and last met in 1919, shortly after the breakup of Austria-Hungary and the establishment of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which was later renamed Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav Committee was led by its president, the Croat lawyer Ante Trumbić, and, until 1916, by Croat politician Frano Supilo as its vice president.

The members of the Yugoslav Committee had different positions on topics such as the method of unification, the desired system of government, and the constitution of the proposed union state. The bulk of the committee members espoused various forms of Yugoslavism – advocating for either a centralised state or a federation in which lands constituting the new state would preserve a degree of autonomy. The committee was financially supported by donations from the Croatian diaspora, and by the government of the Kingdom of Serbia, led by Nikola Pašić. Serbia attempted to use the Yugoslav Committee as a propaganda tool in pursuit of its own policies, including territorial expansion (or the creation of a Greater Serbia).

Representatives of the Yugoslav Committee and the Serbian government met on the Greek island of Corfu in 1917; they discussed the proposed unification of South Slavs and produced the Corfu Declaration, outlining some elements of the future union&#x27;s constitution. Further meetings took place at the end of the war in Geneva in 1918. Those discussions resulted in the Geneva Declaration, which described a confederal constitution of the union. The Government of Serbia repudiated the declaration shortly afterwards. The State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, which was formed as Austria-Hungary was breaking up, treated the Yugoslav Committee as its representative in international affairs. The committee soon came under pressure to unify with Serbia and proceeded to do so in a manner that ignored the earlier declarations. It ceased to exist shortly afterwards.

==Background==
The idea of South Slavic political unity predates the creation of Yugoslavia by nearly a century. The concept was first developed in Habsburg Croatia by a group of Croat intellectuals who formed the Illyrian movement in the 19th century. It evolved through many forms and proposals. The Illyrian intellectuals argued that Croatian history is a part of a wider history of the South Slavs, and that Croats, Serbs, and potentially Slovenes and Bulgarians were parts of a single &quot;Illyrian&quot; nation, choosing the name as a neutral term. The movement began as a cultural one, promoting Croatian national identity and integration of all Croatian provinces within the Austrian Empire, usually in reference to the Habsburg kingdoms of Croatia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia, and a part or all of Ottoman Bosnia and Herzegovina. A wider aim was to gather all South Slavs or &quot;Jugo-Slaveni&quot; for short, in a commonwealth within or outside the Empire. The movement&#x27;s two directions became known as Croatianism and Yugoslavism respectively, meant to counter Germanisation and Magyarisation.

Fearing the (drive to the east), the Illyrians believed Germanisation and Magyarisation could only be resisted through unity with other Slavs, especially the Serbs. They advocated for the unification of Croatia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia as the Triune Kingdom. The concept was expanded to encompass other South Slavs in Austria or Austria-Hungary after the Compromise of 1867, before aspiring to join other South Slavic polities in a federation or confederation. The proposed consolidation of variously defined Croatian or South Slavic lands led to proposals for trialism in Austria-Hungary, accommodating a South-Slavic polity with a rank equal to the Kingdom of Hungary. 

After the neighbouring Kingdom of Serbia achieved independence through the 1878 Treaty of Berlin, the Yugoslav idea became irrelevant in that country. Before the First Balkan War in 1912, Serbia was mono-ethnic and Serbian nationalists sought to include those they considered to be Serbs into the state. It portrayed the work of bishops Josip Juraj Strossmayer and Franjo Rački as a scheme to establish a Greater Croatia. A group of Royal Serbian Army officers known as the Black Hand exerted pressure to expand Serbia; they carried out a May 1903 coup that brought the Karađorđević dynasty to power and then organised nationalist actions in the &quot;unredeemed Serbian provinces&quot;, specified as Bosnia, Herzegovina, Montenegro, an Old Serbia – meaning Kosovo – Macedonia, Central Croatia, Slavonia, Syrmia, Vojvodina, and Dalmatia. This echoed Garašanin&#x27;s 1844 &quot;Načertanije&quot;, a treatise that anticipated the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, and which called for the establishment of Greater Serbia to pre-empt Russian or Austrian expansion into the Balkans by unifying all Serbs into a single state.

In the first two decades of the 20th century, Croat, Serb, and Slovene national programmes adopted Yugoslavism in different, conflicting, or mutually exclusive forms. Yugoslavism became a pivotal idea for the establishment of a South Slavic political union. Most Serbs equated the idea with Greater Serbia or a vehicle to bring all Serbs into a single state. For many Croats and Slovenes, Yugoslavism protected them against Austrian and Hungarian challenges to the preservation of their own national identities and political autonomy.

==Prelude==
===Florence meeting===
In October 1914, Serbian Prime Minister Nikola Pašić learnt the Government of the United Kingdom was considering expanding the alliance against the Central Powers, which at that time consisted of the German Empire and Austria-Hungary. The UK intended to persuade Hungary to secede from Austria-Hungary and to persuade the Kingdom of Italy to abandon its neutrality so both countries could join the alliance of the UK, France, and Russia that was known as the Entente Powers. Pašić discovered the UK was considering guaranteeing Hungarian access to the Adriatic Sea through the Port of Rijeka and overland access to Rijeka over Croatian soil, and resolving the Adriatic Question satisfactorily for Italy. Pašić thought these developments, coupled with a potential UK–Romanian alliance, would threaten Serbia and jeopardise the Serbian objective of gaining access to the Adriatic.

In response, Pašić directed two Bosnian Serb members of the Austro-Hungarian Diet of Bosnia, Nikola Stojanović and Dušan Vasiljević, to contact the émigré Croatian politicians and lawyers Ante Trumbić and Julije Gazzari, in order to resist the pro-Hungarian British proposals and to create a Slavic alternative. Pašić proposed the establishment of a body that would cooperate with the Government of Serbia on the unification of South Slavs in a state that would be created through the expansion of Serbia. The policy of expansion was to be set and controlled entirely by Serbia, and the proposed body would carry out propaganda activities on its behalf. The four men met in Florence, Italy, on 22 November 1914. In January 1915, Frano Supilo, who was once a leading figure in the Croat-Serb Coalition, the ruling political party of the Austro-Hungarian realm of Croatia-Slavonia, met with British foreign secretary Sir Edward Grey and Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, providing them with the manifesto of the nascent Yugoslav Committee and discussing the benefits of South Slavic unification. The manifesto was co-written by Supilo and British political activist and historian Robert Seton-Watson.

===Niš Declaration===

The Serbian leadership considered World War I to be an opportunity for territorial expansion beyond the Serb-inhabited areas of the Balkans. A committee that was tasked with determining the country&#x27;s war aims produced a program to establish a single South-Slavic state through the addition of Croatia-Slavonia, the Slovene Lands, Vojvodina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Dalmatia. Pašić thought the process should be implemented through the addition of new territories to Serbia. On 7 December, Serbia announced its war aims in the Niš Declaration. The declaration called on South Slavs to struggle to liberate and unify &quot;unliberated brothers&quot;, &quot;three tribes of one people&quot; – referring to Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. This formulation was adopted instead of an explicit goal of territorial expansion as a way to attract support from South Slavs living in Austria-Hungary. The Serbian government wanted to appeal to fellow South Slavs because it feared little material support would be delivered from its Entente Powers allies as it became clear the war would not be short. Serbia assumed a central role in the state-building of the future South Slavic polity, with support from the major Entente Powers.

Supilo initially assumed the Niš Declaration meant Serbia was fully supportive of his ideas on the method of unification. He was convinced otherwise by Russian foreign minister Sergey Sazonov, who informed Supilo that Russia only supported the creation of Greater Serbia. As a result, Supilo and Trumbić did not trust Pašić, and considered him a proponent of Serbian hegemony. Despite the mistrust, Supilo and Trumbić wanted to work with Pašić to further the aim of South-Slavic unification. Pašić offered to work with them towards the establishment of a Serbo-Croat state in which Croats would be given some concessions, an offer they declined. Trumbić was convinced the Serbian leadership thought of unification as a means to conquer neighbouring territories for Serbian gain.

Trumbić and Supilo found another reason to distrust Pašić when Pašić dispatched envoys to address Sazonov&#x27;s opposition to the addition of Roman Catholic South Slavs to the proposed South Slavic union. The envoys wrote a memorandum claiming Croats only inhabit the north of Central Croatia, and that the regions of Slavonia, Krbava, Lika, Bačka, and Banat should be added to Serbia, as well as the previously claimed Dalmatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Trumbić and Supilo became convinced that because of the Government of Serbia&#x27;s expansionist policy, the proposed unification would be perceived within Croatian-inhabited areas of Austria-Hungary as a Serbian conquest rather than as a liberation. They decided to proceed with caution, gather political support abroad, and to refrain from the establishment of a Yugoslav Committee until Italy&#x27;s entry into the war became certain.

===Treaty of London===

The Entente Powers ultimately concluded an alliance with Italy by offering it large areas of Austria-Hungary that were inhabited by South Slavs, mostly Croats and Slovenes, along the eastern shores of the Adriatic Sea. The offer was formalised as the 1915 Treaty of London, and caused Trumbić and Supilo to reconsider their criticism of Serbian policies. This was because they saw potential Serbian war success against Austria-Hungary as the only realistic safeguard against Italian expansion into the Slovene-and-Croat-inhabited lands. Supilo was convinced Croatia would be partitioned between Italy, Serbia, and Hungary if the Treaty of London was to be implemented.

The matter became closely related to the Entente&#x27;s simultaneous efforts to obtain an alliance with Bulgaria, or at least to secure its neutrality, in return for territorial gains against Serbia. As compensation, Serbia was promised territories that were within Austria-Hungary at the time: Bosnia and Herzegovina and an outlet to the Adriatic Sea in Dalmatia. Regardless of the promised compensation, Pašić was reluctant to accede to all of the Bulgarian territorial demands, especially before Serbia had secured the new territories. Supilo obtained British support for plebiscites in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Dalmatia so the populace of those territories would decide on their own fate rather than Britain supplying guarantees of westward territorial expansion to Serbia. Crucially, Serbia received Russian support for its dismissal of the proposed land swap.

==Establishment==
The Yugoslav Committee was formally founded in the Hôtel Madison, Paris, on 30 April 1915, a few days after signing of the London Agreement ensuring Italy&#x27;s entry into the World War I. The committee designated London as its seat. The committee was an unelected, &quot;ad-hoc&quot; group of anti-Habsburg politicians and activists who had fled Austria-Hungary when World War I broke out. The committee&#x27;s work was largely funded by members of the Croatian diaspora, including Gazzari&#x27;s brother and the Croatian-Chilean industrialist Remigio. A portion of the costs were covered by the Government of Serbia.

Trumbić became the Yugoslav Committee president and Supilo its vice-president. The committee also included Croatian Sabor members sculptor Ivan Meštrović, Hinko Hinković, Jovan Banjanin, and Franko Potočnjak; Diet of Istria member Dinko Trinajstić; Diet of Bosnia members Stojanović and Vasiljević; Imperial Council member ; writer Milan Marjanović; literary historian Pavle Popović; ethnologist Niko Županič; jurist Bogumil Vošnjak; Miće Mičić; and Gazzari. Later, the membership also included Milan Srškić, Ante Biankini, Mihajlo Pupin, Lujo Bakotić, Ivan De Giulli, Niko Gršković, Josip Jedlowski, and Josip Mandić. Prominent non-member supporters included and Josip Marohnić, the latter being the president of the North American Croatian Fraternal Union, which collected money for the Yugoslav Committee. The committee&#x27;s central London office was led by Hinković and Jedlowski. According to some sources, Jedlowski used the title of secretary of the committee, although it appears the position was an administrative one that conferred no special authority.

Members of the Yugoslav Committee believed the Croatian question could only be resolved through the abolition of Austria-Hungary and Croatia&#x27;s unification with Serbia. Trumbić and Supilo were proponents of a political unification of South Slavs within a single nation-state through the realisation of Yugoslavist ideas. They believed the South Slavs were one people who were entitled to a national homeland through the principle of self-determination and advocated for unification based on equality. He advocated for the establishment of a federal state within which Slovene Lands, Croatia (consisting of pre-war Croatia-Slavonia and Dalmatia), Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia (expanded to include Vojvodina), and Montenegro would become the five constituent elements. Croat members of the Yugoslav Committee, except Hinković, thought the federal units would ensure preservation of the historical, legal, and cultural traditions of the individual parts of the new state. Supilo proposed the new country would be named Yugoslavia to avoid imposing the name of Serbia onto areas of the new country outside of the pre-war Serbian boundaries. He also suggested Croatia should be given some protection against future Serbian dominance and that Zagreb might be the city most suited to becoming the new country&#x27;s capital. The Yugoslav Committee believed unification should be the result of an agreement between itself and the Government of Serbia.

The Yugoslav Committee attracted support in the UK, especially that of Seton-Watson, journalist and historian Wickham Steed, and archaeologist Arthur Evans. The Entente Powers did not initially consider a breakup of Austria-Hungary as a war aim and did not support the work of the committee, whose activities aimed to undermine the territorial integrity of Austria-Hungary. The Yugoslav Committee worked to be recognised by the Entente Powers as the legal representative of South Slavs living in Austria-Hungary, but Pašić consistently prevented any formal recognition. A further point of friction between Supilo and Trumbić on one side and Pašić on the other was the Serbian ambassador&#x27;s demand to the UK to ask the Yugoslav Committee to omit any mention of Dalmatia as a part of Croatia since time immemorial, because it might jeopardise Serbian territorial claims. Supilo and Trumbić were surprised but they complied, believing Croatia would be otherwise left defenceless against Italian territorial claims.

==Supilo&#x27;s resignation==
Supilo thought the Yugoslav Committee had to confront Italian and Hungarian attempts to encroach on lands inhabited by South Slavs and the Greater Serbian expansionist designs pursued by Pašić. While most of the committee agreed with Supilo, they did not want to openly confront Serbia until the South Slavic lands were safe from Italian and Hungarian threats. Following the Serbian military defeat in the 1915 Serbian campaign, Supilo, Gazzari, and Trinajstić concluded the Serb members of the Yugoslav Committee believed the proposed unification should primarily encompass ethnic Serbs in a centralised state and saw no need for a federal system because they deemed differences between Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes to be the artificial result of Austrian rule. Supilo protested by informing the Yugoslav Committee he had sent a memo to Grey, proposing an independent Croatian state should be established unless Serbia agreed to treat Croats and Slovenes as equal to Serbs. His principal complaint was that the Entente Powers thought of Croatia and other Austro-Hungarian territories as compensation to Serbia for the loss of Macedonia and concessions in Banat instead of treating the populations of these areas as equal partners. Serb and Slovene members of the committee accused Supilo and his allies of separatism and favouring Croatian interests over Slovene ones.

Trumbić believed unification should be pursued at all costs providing Austria-Hungary was destroyed. In March 1916, Trumbić dismissed Supilo&#x27;s idea of establishing a Croatian Committee, fearing it would lead to conflict with the Serbian government and weaken the Croatians&#x27; position against Italy. In early May 1916, Pašić declared Serbian recognition of Italian dominance in the Adriatic, causing Gazzari, Trinajstić, and Meštrović to ask for a meeting of the committee. In the meeting, Vasiljević and Stojanović again attacked Supilo for his opposition to the policy of the Serbian government. Supilo left the Yugoslav Committee on 5 June 1916. Supilo, believing the piecemeal approach being taken was wrong and that problems must be immediately dealt with in the open, abandoned integral Yugoslavism and unsuccessfully urged Croat members of the Yugoslav Committee to resign and join him in pursuit of an independent Croatia because Serbia had prioritised uniting ethnic Serbs. He hoped to obtain Italian support for the idea, because Italy was displeased with the prospect of the unification of South Slavs close to its borders, and thereby pressure Pašić and the Serbs into giving into his demands.

Relations between the Yugoslav Committee and Serbia did not improve after Supilo&#x27;s departure. A new contentious issue was the designation of the South Slavic volunteer units established in Odesa. These consisted of prisoners of war who had been captured from Austria-Hungary by Russia and now wanted to fight against the Austro-Hungarians on the side of Slavic independence. While the Yugoslav Committee wanted the force to be called Yugoslav, Pašić successfully arranged through Serbian diplomatic mission in Russia to have the unit named the First Serbian Volunteer Division, which was commanded by officers of the Royal Serbian Army who were sent to Russia for the task. While the committee hoped the force would help promote a common Yugoslav identity, Yugoslavism was actively suppressed by the officers, on instructions given by Pašić. As a result, 12,735 of 33,000 volunteers left the force in protest at its specifically Serbian identification, and recruitment of volunteers significantly slowed.

==Corfu Declaration==

The Serbian position was weakened following the loss of Russian support after the February Revolution and President of the United States Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s refusal to honour secret agreements that had promised territorial rewards. At the same time, the Entente Powers were still looking for ways to achieve a separate peace with Austria-Hungary and isolate the German Empire in the war. South Slavic deputies on the Austro-Hungarian Imperial Council in Vienna presented the May Declaration, proposing the introduction of trialism in Austria-Hungary, allowing the South Slavs to unite in a single polity within the monarchy. France and the UK appeared to support the efforts of new Austro-Hungarian emperor Charles to restructure the empire and seek peace. This presented a problem for the Serbian government, which was exiled on the Greek island of Corfu since their military defeat, and increased the risk of a trialist solution for the Habsburg South Slavs if the separate peace treaty materialised, preventing the fulfilment of expansionist Serbian war objectives.

Pašić felt he had to come to an agreement with the Yugoslav Committee to strengthen the Serbian position with the Entente Powers while countering Italian interests in the Balkans. Trumbić and Pašić met on Corfu. At the conference, the Yugoslav Committee was represented by Trumbić, Hinković, Vošnjak, Vasiljević, Trinajstić, and Potočnjak. Trumbić received no information on the conference agenda, so the committee members were unprepared and had to individually negotiate with Pašić. Trumbić prioritised assurances Croatia would not be left within Austria-Hungary and that Italy would not occupy Dalmatia. He also opposed complete centralisation of the proposed union state. The meeting resulted in the Corfu Declaration, a manifesto in which the disparate groups declared a common objective; the unification of South Slavs in a constitutional, democratic, and parliamentary monarchy that would be headed by the Serbian ruling Karađorđević dynasty. Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav Committee&#x27;s preferred name for the unified country, was rejected and the bulk of the constitutional matters were left to be decided later because Trumbić felt some agreement was necessary to curb threats of Italian expansion.

==Pašić–Trumbić conflict==
Relations between Pašić and Trumbić deteriorated throughout 1918. They openly disagreed on several key demands made by Trumbić, including the recognition of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes living in Austria-Hungary as allied peoples; the recognition of the Yugoslav Committee as the representative of those peoples; and the recognition of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes Volunteer Corps (formerly called the First Serbian Volunteer Division) as an allied force drawn from Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes living in Austria-Hungary. After Pašić refused to support these positions, the Yugoslav Committee authorised Trumbić to bypass Pašić and directly present the Entente Powers with their demands. The Serbian government denied the Yugoslav Committee had any legitimacy, saying that Serbia alone represented all South Slavs, including those living in Austria-Hungary.

Pašić requested the Entente Powers issue a declaration recognising Serbia had the right to liberate and unify South Slavic territories with Serbia, but this was unsuccessful. Pašić stated that Yugoslavia would be absorbed by Serbia and not the other way around, that Serbia was primarily waging war to liberate Serbs, and that Pašić had created the Yugoslav Committee. He rejected Trumbić&#x27;s claim that only one third of population of the future union lived in Serbia and that the Corfu Declaration called for two partners, stating the declaration was only for foreign consumption and was no longer valid. The French and British governments declined two Serbian requests for the authority to annex South Slavic Austro-Hungarian lands, and the British foreign secretary Arthur Balfour upheld the Corfu Declaration as an agreement of partners, demanding Pašić align his views with those of the Yugoslav Committee. However, in line with Serbia&#x27;s wishes, the Entente Powers decided against recognition of the Yugoslav Committee as an allied body, informing the committee it would have to come to an agreement with Pašić.

The potential preservation of Austria-Hungary also caused friction between Trumbić and Pašić. The Entente Powers continued to pursue a separate peace with Austria-Hungary until early 1918, regardless of the Corfu Declaration. In January 1918, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom David Lloyd George confirmed his support for the survival of Austria-Hungary. In his Fourteen Points speech, Wilson agreed, advocating for the autonomy of the peoples of Austria-Hungary. In October, Lloyd George discussed the potential preservation of a reformed Austria-Hungary with Pašić, saying Serbia could annex any areas occupied by the Royal Serbian Army before an armistice. In return, Trumbić asked Wilson to deploy US troops to Croatia-Slavonia to quell the disorder associated with the Green Cadres, suppress Bolshevism, and not to allow Italian or Serbian troops into the territory. He was unsuccessful.

==Geneva Declaration==

In the process of the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, following the monarchy&#x27;s military defeat in 1918, the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs was proclaimed in the South Slavic-inhabited lands of the former empire. The new state was governed by the Croat-Serb Coalition-dominated National Council, which authorised the Yugoslav Committee to speak on behalf of the Council in international relations. In late October 1918, the Croatian Sabor declared the end of ties with Austria-Hungary and elected the president of the National Council, Slovene politician Anton Korošec, to the new position of President of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs.

Trumbić and Pašić met again in November in Geneva, where they were joined by Korošec and representatives of Serbian opposition parties, to discuss unification. At the conference, Pašić was isolated and ultimately compelled to recognise the National Council as an equal partner to the Serbian government. Trumbić obtained agreement from the other conference participants on the establishment of a common government, in which the National Council and the Government of Serbia would appoint an equal number of ministers to govern a common confederal state. Pašić consented after receiving a message from the President of France Raymond Poincaré stating he wished Pašić to come to an agreement with the representatives of the National Council. In return, the National Council and the Yugoslav Committee agreed to a speedy unification, and signed the Geneva Declaration.

A week later, prompted by Pašić, the Serbian government renounced the declaration, saying it limited Serbian sovereignty to its pre-war borders. The Vice President of the National Council, Croatian Serb politician Svetozar Pribićević, supported the repudiation of the Geneva Agreement and swayed the National Council against the position negotiated by Trumbić. Pribićević persuaded the Council members to proceed with unification and accept that the details of the new arrangements would be decided afterwards.

==Aftermath==
The National Council was confronted by civil unrest and, they believed, a coup d&#x27;état plot, and requested help from the Serbian Army to quell the violence. At the same time, the council hoped Serbian support would halt the Italian Army&#x27;s advance from the west, where it had seized Rijeka and was approaching Ljubljana. Having no legal means to stop the Italian advance because the Entente Powers hand authorised it, nor having sufficient armed forces to stop it, the National Council feared the Italian presence on the eastern shores of the Adriatic would become permanent. The National Council dispatched a delegation to Prince Regent Alexander to arrange an urgent unification with Serbia in a federation. The delegation ignored the instructions it had been given when it addressed the Prince Regent, omitting to secure specific terms for the unification agreement. The Prince Regent accepted the offer on behalf of Peter I of Serbia and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which was subsequently renamed Yugoslavia, was established with no agreement on the nature of the new political union. Mate Drinković, a member of the delegation, informed Trumbić in a letter that unification had been proclaimed, saying any other agreement would have been impossible to obtain.

In early 1919, Trumbić appointed Trinajstić as his replacement at the head of the Yugoslav Committee. The newly appointed Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, Stojan Protić, instructed the Yugoslav Committee to dissolve. On 12 February, Trinajstić convened a meeting, with Trumbić attending; the majority of the committee members decided not to dissolve the body despite Protić&#x27;s instructions. Nevertheless, the Yugoslav Committee ceased to exist in March 1919.

Czech historian Milada Paulová wrote a book examining the relationship between the Yugoslav Committee and the Serbian government, and its translation was published in 1925. According to Paulová, the committee had to fight for an equal position, while Pašić&#x27;s actions were guided by Serbian nationalism. Paulová&#x27;s work had an impact on Yugoslav historiography, especially Slovene and Croatian, and contributed to the interwar debate on the levels of Yugoslavism espoused by the Yugoslav Committee and the Pašić government. In Communist Yugoslavia, the work of the Yugoslav Committee was re-examined from late 1950s, and the results exhibited the first post-war disagreements between Croatian and Serbian historiographies. At the 1961 congress of the union of historians in Ljubljana, Franjo Tuđman argued the Serbian government had aspired to hegemony and criticised fellow historian Jovan Marjanović, who had claimed otherwise. In 1965, the Zagreb-based Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts published a book emphasising the Yugoslav Committee&#x27;s contribution to the creation of Yugoslavia.

<doc id="806350" wikidata="Q3839634" url="?curid=806350" title="Luigi Ferri">
<text>Luigi Ferri (June 15, 1826 – 1895) was an Italian philosopher born in Bologna.

His education was obtained mainly at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris, where his father, a painter and architect, was engaged in the construction of the Théâtre Italien. From his twenty-fifth year he began to lecture in the colleges of Évreux, Dieppe, Blois and Toulouse. Later, he was lecturer at Annecy and Casal-Montferrat, and became head of the education department under Mamiani in 1860.

Three years later he was appointed to the chair of philosophy at the Istituto di Perfezionamento at Florence, and, in 1871, was made professor of philosophy in the University of Rome La Sapienza. On the death of Mamiani in 1885 he became editor of the &quot;Filosofia delle scuole italiane&quot;, whose title he changed to &quot;Rivista italiana di filosofia&quot;. He wrote both on psychology and on metaphysics, but is known especially as a historian of philosophy.

His original work is eclectic, combining the psychology of his teachers, Jules Simon, Saisset and Mamiani, with the idealism of Rosmini and Gioberti. Among his works may be mentioned:
*&quot;Studii sulla coscienza&quot;
*&quot;Il Fenomeno nelle sue relazioni con la sensazione&quot;
*&quot;Della idea del vera&quot;
*&quot;Della filosofia del diritto presso Aristotile&quot; (1885)

<text>Alexander Valeryevich Khalifman (; born 18 January 1966) is a Russian chess player and writer. Awarded the title of Grandmaster by FIDE in 1990, he was FIDE World Chess Champion in 1999.

== Early life ==
Alexander Khalifman was born in St Petersburg into a Jewish family of engineers. Khalifman&#x27;s grandfather was the director of the Chaliapin Museum; the other half of the family came from the Baltics. According to family legend, Khalifman&#x27;s ancestor was one of the commanders of Russian monitor Rusalka.

== Tournament career ==
Khalifman won the 1982 Soviet Union Youth Championship, the 1984 Soviet Union Youth Championship, the 1985 European Under-20 Championship in Groningen, the 1985 and 1987 Moscow championships, 1990 Groningen, 1993 Ter Apel, 1994 Chess Open of Eupen, 1995 Chess Open St. Petersburg, the Russian Championship in 1996, the Saint Petersburg Championship in 1996 and 1997, 1997 Chess Grand Master Tournament St. Petersburg, 1997 Aarhus, 1997 and 1998 Bad Wiessee, 2000 Hoogeveen.

He was a member of the gold medal-winning Russian team at the Chess Olympiads in 1992, 2000 and 2002, and at the 1997 World Team Chess Championship.

Khalifman gained the Grandmaster title in 1990 with one particularly good early result being his first place in the 1990 New York City Open ahead of a host of strong players. His most notable achievement was winning the FIDE World Championship in 1999, a title he held until the following year. He was rated 44th in the world at the time, while &quot;Classical&quot; World Champion Garry Kasparov was rated No. 1. Khalifman said after the tournament, &quot;Rating systems work perfectly for players who play only in round robin closed events. I think most of them are overrated. Organizers invite same people over and over because they have the same rating and their rating stays high.&quot; Khalifman played in the Linares chess tournament next year, and performed credibly (though placing below joint winner Kasparov).

== Coaching ==
With his trainer Gennady Nesis (de) he runs a chess academy in St. Petersburg, called &quot;The Grandmaster Chess School&quot;, since November 1998. Khalifman has been coaching Vladimir Fedoseev since 2011.

Khalifman has been coaching the Azerbaijani national team since 2013 and is its captain. He acted as a to Alisa Galliamova in the Women&#x27;s World Chess Championship 1999 and to Anna Ushenina in the Women&#x27;s World Chess Championship 2013.

In March 2022, he signed an open letter of Russian GMs
to Vladimir Putin urging him to stop the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

<text>The 1986–87 network television schedule for the three major English language commercial broadcast networks in the United States covers primetime hours from September 1986 through August 1987. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series cancelled after the 1985–86 season.

Although Fox debuted as a fourth network effort in October 1986, the network waited until April 1987 to commence offering prime time programming, effectively deferring its first Fall programming season until September 1987.

PBS, the Public Broadcasting Service, was in operation but the schedule was set by each local station.

New series are highlighted in bold.

All times are U.S. Eastern Time and Pacific Time (except for some live sports or events). Subtract one hour for Central, Mountain, Alaska and Hawaii–Aleutian times.

Each of the 30 highest-rated shows is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.

<text>Antonio Francesco Davide Ambrogio Rosmini-Serbati, IC (; 25 March 17971 July 1855) was an Italian Catholic priest and philosopher. He founded the Rosminians, officially the Institute of Charity, and pioneered the concept of social justice and Italian Liberal Catholicism. 

Alessandro Manzoni considered Rosmini the only contemporary Italian author worth reading. Rosmini has been beatified in the Catholic Church.

==Biography==
Antonio Rosmini Serbati was born on 24 March 1797, at Rovereto, in the Austrian Tyrol. HIs brother Carlo Rosmini was a secular writer. He studied at the University of Padua, and was ordained priest at Chioggia, on 21 April 1821. In 1822 he received a Doctorate in Theology and Canon Law.

During this time Rosmini formulated his &quot;Principle of Passivity&quot;. Rosmini felt compelled to ask himself: Do my plans spring more from my own subjective desire to do good than from a desire to do the will of God?”. Reflecting in this way, Rosmini articulated the principle in two parts: be ready to undertake any work of charity but only so long as it is God&#x27;s Providence that presents it; in the meantime, immerse oneself in the commitment to continual conversion, seeking the amendment of one&#x27;s own life.

===The Institute of Charity===
In 1828 he founded at Monte Calvario near Domodossola, a new religious community, the Institute of Charity, known generally since as the Rosminians. In the autumn of 1830, he inaugurated the observance of the rule at Calvario, and from 1834 to 1835 had charge of a parish at Rovereto. Later foundations followed at Stresa and Domodossola. The Constitutions of the institute were approved by presented to Pope Gregory XVI on 20 December 1838. The institute spread rapidly in England and Italy, and requests for foundations came from various countries.

The members might be priests or laymen, who devoted themselves to preaching, the education of youth, and works of universal charity—material, spiritual and intellectual. They work in Italy, England, Ireland, France, Wales, New Zealand, Kenya, Tanzania, India, Venezuela, and the United States. In London they were attached to the historical Church of St Etheldreda, Ely Place, Holborn. In 1962, Rosmini College School for Boys was founded in Auckland, New Zealand by Father Catcheside.

Rosmini was retained as a political advisor to the then government of Piedmont. In August 1848, he was sent to Rome by King Charles Albert of Piedmont to enlist the pope on the side of Italy as against Austria. Rosmini was invited to serve in the Roman Curia of Pope Pius IX as prime minister of the Papal States. He participated in the intellectual struggle which had for its object emancipation from Austria, but as a trusted ecclesiastical advisor and diplomat, he was not an initiator of the movement which ended in the freedom and unity of Italy. In fact, while eager for the deliverance of Italy from Austria, his aim was to bring about a confederation of the states of the country, which was to be under the control of the pope. Upon establishment of the Roman Republic, the Pontiff was forced to flee and became estranged from his former advisor in political matters. The tenuous political circumstances made it very difficult to reconcile the two men&#x27;s differing projects: innovative social and juridical reforms, however modest, fell victim to the more pressing existential need to defend the supremacy of the Church&#x27;s temporal powers.

==Writings==
Rosmini&#x27;s works, &quot;Of the five wounds of the Holy Church&quot; and &quot;The Constitution of Social Justice&quot; (see Works below), aroused great opposition, especially among the Jesuits, and in 1849 they were placed upon the Index. Rosmini at once declared his submission and retired to Stresa on Lago Maggiore, where he died. Before his death he had the satisfaction of learning that the works in question were dismissed, that is, proclaimed free from censure by the Congregation of the Index. Twenty years later, the word dismissed (&quot;dimittantur&quot;) became the subject of controversy, some maintaining that it amounted to a direct approval, others that it was purely negative and did not imply that the books were free from error. 
Vincenzo Maria Gatti, the Dominican professor of theology at the College of Saint Thomas, the forerunner of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas and Master of the Sacred Palace, was instrumental in partially rehabilitating the works of Rosmini. In an article published in &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; on 16 June 1876, Gatti made clear that Pius IX did not intend the &quot;dimittantur&quot; as amounting to wholesale condemnation.

The controversy continued until 1887, when Pope Leo XIII condemned forty of Rosmini&#x27;s propositions. Referring to this condemnation, however, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a document in 2001 in which it declared that &quot;the meaning of the propositions, as understood and condemned by the Decree, does not belong to the authentic position of Rosmini.&quot;

In 1998 Rosmini was named by Pope John Paul II in the encyclical &quot;Fides et Ratio&quot; as one of the greater Christian thinkers.

==Thought==
The most comprehensive view of Rosmini&#x27;s philosophical standpoint is to be found in his &quot;&quot;, in which he set forth the conception of a complete encyclopaedia of the human knowable, synthetically conjoined, according to the order of ideas, in a perfectly harmonious whole. Contemplating the position of recent philosophy from John Locke to Georg Hegel, and having his eye directed to the ancient and fundamental problem of the origin, truth and certainty of our ideas, he wrote: &quot;If philosophy is to be restored to love and respect, I think it will be necessary, in part, to return to the teachings of the ancients, and in part to give those teachings the benefit of modern methods&quot; (&quot;Theodicy&quot;, a. 148). He examined and analysed the facts of human knowledge, and obtained the following results:
#that the notion or idea of being or existence, in general, enters into, and is presupposed by, all our acquired cognitions, so that, without it, they would be impossible
#that this idea is essentially objective since what is seen in it is as distinct from and opposed to the mind that sees it as the light is from the eye that looks at it
#that it is essentially true, because being and truth are convertible terms, and because in the vision of it, the mind cannot err, since error could only be committed by a judgment, and here there is no judgment, but a pure intuition affirming nothing and denying nothing
#that by the application of this essentially objective and true idea the human being intellectually perceives, first, the animal body individually conjoined with him, and then, on the occasion of the sensations produced in him not by himself, the causes of those sensations, that is, from the action felt he perceives and affirms an agent, a being, and therefore a true thing, that acts on him, and he thus gets at the external world, these are the true primitive judgments, containing
##the subsistence of the particular being (subject), and
##its essence or species as determined by the quality of the action felt from it (predicate)
#that reflection, by separating the essence or species from the subsistence, obtains the full specific idea (universalization), and then from this, by leaving aside some of its elements, the abstract specific idea (abstraction)
#that the mind, having reached this stage of development, can proceed to further and further abstracts, including the first principles of reasoning, the principles of the several sciences, complex ideas, groups of ideas, and so on without end
#finally, that the same most universal idea of being, this generator and formal element of all acquired cognitions, cannot itself be acquired, but must be innate in us, implanted by God in our nature. Being, as naturally shining to our mind, must therefore be what men call the light of reason. Hence the name Rosmini gives it of ideal being; and this he laid down as the fundamental principle of all philosophy and the supreme criterion of truth and certainty. This he believed to be the teaching of St Augustine, as well as of St Thomas, of whom he was an ardent admirer and defender.

According to Father Battista Mondin, Rosmini&#x27;s philosophy cannot be defined as Thomism because it lacks the fundamental real distinction between essence and existence (&quot;Actus essendi&quot;), as well as the conception of God as &quot;Esse ut Actus&quot;.

On 26 June 2006, Pope Benedict XVI signed a Decree of the heroic virtues, and hence declared Rosmini to be Venerable. On 3 June 2007, Pope Benedict XVI authorized the promulgation of a decree approving Rosmini&#x27;s beatification. On 18 November 2007, he was beatified in Novara, Italy.

==Works==
Of his numerous works, of which a collected edition in 17 volumes was issued in Milan (1842–44), supplemented by &quot;Opere postume&quot; in 5 volumes (Turin, 1859–74), the most important are:
*&quot;The Principles of Moral Science&quot; (1831)
*&quot;The Restoration of Philosophy in Italy&quot; (1836)
*&quot;The Philosophy of Right&quot; (1841–45)
The following have also been translated into English:
*
*
*&quot;Psychology&quot; (Anonymous) (1884–88)

<text>Eugene Edward &quot;Snooky&quot; Young (February 3, 1919 – May 11, 2011) was an American jazz trumpeter. He was known for his mastery of the plunger mute, with which he was able to create a wide range of sounds.

==Biography==
Young was lead trumpeter of the Jimmie Lunceford band from 1939 to 1942. He played with Count Basie (three stints totalling eight years), Gerald Wilson and Lionel Hampton, among others, and was an original member of the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Big Band.

His longest engagement was with NBC, where, as a studio trumpeter, he joined &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; Band in 1967 and remained with them until 1992, when the band was replaced by a new, smaller group.

He was part of the touring ensemble, the &quot;Now Generation Brass&quot;, that traveled with Doc Severinsen, which included other jazz greats such as reed man Lew Tabackin, drummer Ed Shaughnessy, saxophonist &amp; arranger Tommy Newsom as well as singer Robert Ozn. Young went on to performing live concert dates, corporate events, and headlining shows in the main rooms of Las Vegas. The one nighters usually occurred on Fridays, Saturdays, or Sundays, as Severinsen was committed to &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on weeknights.

For the Las Vegas gigs, the nucleus of Severinsen&#x27;s touring band (Young, conductor Steve Thoma, and drummer Paul Line) would commute to Vegas nightly, leaving Van Nuys Airport around 6pm via Lear jet, arriving in Las Vegas by 7pm. A limousine would transport the musicians directly backstage, where they would dress and prepare for an 8pm and midnight show. Then it was back to the airport for the ride back to Los Angeles, where Severinsen and Young had their NBC gig, and Steve Thomas and Paul Line were undertaking studio sessions daily.

Young performed nightly with Severinsen, and he was featured prominently for several solos, as well as a trumpet version of &quot;Dueling Banjos&quot;. He continued to perform in Los Angeles, appearing on the 1976 Coconut Grove recording &quot;Bobby Bland and B.B. King Together Again...Live&quot; and again on King&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;One Kind Favor&quot;.

He was one of horn players that accompanied rock group the Band on their 1972 live album &quot;Rock of Ages&quot;.

Young recorded only three albums under his own name. The 1971 album, &quot;Boys from Dayton&quot;, featured Norris Turney on alto sax, Booty Wood on trombone, Richard Tee on piano and organ, and Cornell Dupree on guitar. His 1978 album with altoist Marshal Royal, &quot;Snooky and Marshal&#x27;s Album&quot;, featured pianist Ross Tompkins, rhythm guitarist Freddie Green, bassist Ray Brown and drummer Louie Bellson. &quot;Horn of Plenty&quot; features Ross Tompkins on piano, John Collins on guitar, Ray Brown on bass, and Jake Hanna on drums.

He received a NEA Jazz Masters Award for 2009 on October 17, 2008, at the Lincoln Center in New York City.

Throughout the years, Young recorded and performed with Gerald Wilson (a friend since their Lunceford days) and his Orchestra. Until 2010, he was still playing and recording with the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra.

He died of a respiratory ailment in Newport Beach at the age of 92.

Harry &quot;Sweets&quot; Edison considered Ed Lewis and Snooky Young &quot;the two greatest first trumpet players&quot; he ever played with.

<text>Giuseppe Saracco (6 October 1821 – 19 January 1907) was an Italian politician, financier, and Knight of the Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation. 

==Background and earlier career==

Saracco was born at Bistagno, the province of Alessandria. After qualifying as an advocate, he entered the Piedmontese parliament in 1849. He was a supporter of Cavour. After Cavour died in 1861, Saracco joined the party of Rattazzi and became under-secretary of state for public works in the Rattazzi cabinet of 1862. In 1864 Sella appointed Saracco as secretary-general of finance, and after being created senator in 1865, he acquired considerable fame as a financial authority.

In 1879, Saracco succeeded in postponing the total abolition of the grist tax, and was throughout a fierce opponent of Magliani&#x27;s loose financial administration. Selected as minister of public works by Depretis in 1887, and by Crispi in 1893, he worked to mitigate the worst consequences of Depretis&#x27;s corruptly extravagant policy, and introduced a sounder system of government participation in public works. In November 1898, he was elected president of the senate.

==Prime Minister of Italy==
In June 1900, Saracco succeeded in forming a Cabinet of pacification after the Obstructionist crisis which had caused the downfall of General Pelloux. His term of office was clouded by the assassination of King Umberto (29 July 1900), and his administration was brought to an end in February 1901 by a vote of the chamber condemning his weak attitude towards a general dock strike at Genoa.

==Later life==
After February 1901, Saracco resumed his functions as president of the senate, but on the advent of the third Giolitti cabinet, he was not reappointed to that position. He received the supreme honour of the knighthood of the Annunziata from King Umberto in 1898.

<text>Agostino Magliani (23 July 182420 February 1891), Italian financier, was a native of Laurino, near Salerno.

He studied at Naples, and a book on the philosophy of law based on Liberal principles won for him a post in the Neapolitan treasury. He entered the Italian Senate in 1871, and had already secured a reputation as a financial expert before his &quot;Questione monetaria&quot; appeared in 1874.

In December 1877 he became Italian Minister of Finance in the reconstructed Depretis ministry, and he subsequently held the same office in three other Liberal cabinets. In his second tenure he carried through (1880) the abolition of the , to take effect in 1884. Having to face an increased expenditure without offending the Radical electorate by unpopular taxes, he had recourse to unsound methods of finance, which seriously embarrassed Italian credit for some years after he finally laid down office in 1888. He died in Rome on 22 February 1891. He was one of the founders of the anti-socialistic Adam Smith Society at Florence.

<text>Mahmud Shah Durrani (Pashto/Persian: ) ; 1769 – 18 April 1829) was born prince and later ruler of the Durrani Empire (Afghanistan) between 1801 and 1803, and again between 1809 and 1818. From 1818 to 1829 he was the ruler of Herat. An ethnic Sadduzai tribe section of the Popalzai sub clan of the Durrani Pashtuns, he was the son of Timur Shah Durrani and grandson of Ahmad Shah Durrani.

==Reign==
Mahmud Shah Durrani was the half-brother of his predecessor, Zaman Shah. On July 25, 1801, Zaman Shah was deposed, and Mahmud Shah ascended to ruler-ship. He had a chequered career, being deposed in 1803, restored in 1809, and finally deposed again in 1818.

==Struggles with the Barakzais==
The elder brother of Dost Mohammad Khan, the chief of the Barakzai, Fateh Khan, took an important part in raising Mahmud Shah Durrani to the sovereignty of Afghanistan in 1800 and in restoring him to the throne in 1809. The son of Mahmud Shah Durrani, Shahzada Kamran Durrani, was always in trouble with Fateh Khan, the brother of Dost Muhammad Khan. Mahmud Shah repaid Fateh Khan&#x27;s services by having him assassinated in 1818. The assassination of Fateh Khan Barakzai, incurred the enmity of his tribe and with it began the fall of the Durrani Empire. After a bloody conflict, Mahmud Shah was deprived of all his possessions except Herat. The rest of his dominions were divided among Fateh Khan&#x27;s brothers. King Mahmud Shah Durrani died in 1829. The country was then ruled by Shuja Shah Durrani; another of his half-brothers.

<text>The 1987–88 network television schedule for the four major English language commercial broadcast networks in the United States covers primetime hours from September 1987 through August 1988. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series cancelled after the 1986–87 season.

Note: This is the first fall season for Fox, and the first year since 1958-59 that a fourth commercial television network (NTA) was broadcasting. Fox would air only two days a week until 1989.

PBS is not included; member stations have local flexibility over most of their schedules and broadcast times for network shows may vary.

New series are highlighted in bold.

All times are U.S. Eastern Time and Pacific Time (except for some live sports or events). Subtract one hour for Central, Mountain, Alaska and Hawaii–Aleutian times.

From February 13 to 28, 1988, all of ABC&#x27;s primetime programming was preempted in favor of coverage of the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary.

Each of the 30 highest-rated shows is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.

<text>Louis Wolfe Gilbert (August 31, 1886 – July 12, 1970) was a Russian-born American songwriter of Tin Pan Alley. He is best remembered as the lyricist for &quot;Ramona&quot; (1928), the first movie theme song ever written.

==Biography==

Born in Odessa, Ukraine, then in the Russian Empire, Gilbert moved to the United States as a young man.

Gilbert began his career touring with John L. Sullivan and singing in a quartet at small Coney Island café called College Inn, where he was discovered by English producer Albert Decourville. Decourville brought him to London as part of The Ragtime Octet.

Gilbert&#x27;s first songwriting success came in 1912, when F. A. Mills Music Publishers published his song &quot;Waiting For the Robert E. Lee&quot; (melody by composer Lewis F. Muir). Gilbert later wrote both the words and music to &quot;Down Yonder&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Waiting for the Robert E. Lee&quot;. &quot;Down Yonder&quot; has become something of a standard as an instrumental, though the lyrics are rarely performed.

He joined ASCAP in 1924. 

Gilbert moved to Hollywood in 1929, and began writing for film, television, and radio (including the Eddie Cantor show).

During the 1930s, Gilbert worked on Cuban songs that helped to popularize the rumba in America. Some of these hits for which he wrote English lyrics include &quot;The Peanut Vendor&quot;, &quot;Mama Inez&quot;, and &quot;Maria My Own&quot;.

Gilbert wrote the theme lyrics for the popular children&#x27;s Television Western Hopalong Cassidy, which first aired in 1949 on NBC. He was an innovator in his field, having been one of the first songwriters to begin publishing and promoting a catalog of his own works. He served as the director of ASCAP from 1941 to 1944, and again in 1953. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970. 

Known as &quot;Wolfie&quot;, Gilbert and his wife Rose lived in Beverly Hills and he and his family were members of Temple Israel of Hollywood.

He died in Los Angeles, California on July 12, 1970. His original gravesite was at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City (Mausoleum, Court of Sages, Crypt 223) but he was later reinterred at Forest Lawn Cemetery (Cathedral City) near Palm Springs, California.

<doc id="806405" wikidata="Q315220" url="?curid=806405" title="Eugène Sue">
<text>Marie-Joseph &quot;Eugène&quot; Sue (; 26 January 18043 August 1857) was a French novelist. He was one of several authors who popularized the genre of the serial novel in France with his very popular and widely imitated &quot;The Mysteries of Paris&quot;, which was published in a newspaper from 1842 to 1843.

==Early life==
Sue was born in Paris, France. He was the son of a distinguished surgeon in Napoleon&#x27;s army, Jean-Joseph Sue, and had Empress Joséphine as his godmother. Sue himself acted as surgeon both in the 1823 French campaign in Spain and at the Battle of Navarino in 1827. In 1829 his father&#x27;s death put him in possession of a considerable fortune, and he settled in Paris.

== Literary career ==
Sue&#x27;s naval experiences supplied much of the material for his first novels, &quot;Kernock le pirate&quot; (1830), &quot;Atar-Gull&quot; (1831), &quot;La Salamandre&quot; (2 vols, 1832), &quot;La Coucaratcha&quot; (4 vols, 1832–1834), and others, written at the height of the Romantic movement of 1830. In the quasi-historical style he wrote &quot;Jean Cavalier, ou Les Fanatiques des Cevennes&quot; (4 vols, 1840) and &quot;Latréaumont&quot; (2 vols, 1837). His &quot;Mathilde&quot; (6 vols, 1841) contains the first known expression of the popular proverb &quot;La vengeance se mange très-bien froide&quot;, translated in 1846 as &quot;Revenge is very good eaten cold&quot; by D. G. Osborne, also constituting the first known English usage of the proverb later expressed in English as &quot;Revenge is a dish best served cold&quot;.

He was strongly affected by the socialist ideas of the day, and these prompted his most famous works, the anti-Catholic novels: &quot;The Mysteries of Paris&quot; (&quot;Les Mystères de Paris&quot;) (published in &quot;Journal des débats&quot; from 19 June 1842 until 15 October 1843) and &quot;The Wandering Jew&quot; (&quot;Le Juif errant&quot;; 10 vols, 1844–1845), which were among the most popular specimens of the serial novel. &quot;The Wandering Jew&quot; is a Gothic novel depicting the titular character in conflict with the villain, a murderous Jesuit named Rodin. These works depicted the intrigues of the nobility and the harsh life of the underclass to a wide public. &quot;Les Mystères de Paris &quot;spawned a class of imitations all over the world, the city mysteries. Sue&#x27;s books caused controversy because of their strongly violent scenes, and also because of their socialist and anti-clerical subtexts.

He followed up with some singular books: &quot;Les Sept pêchés capitaux&quot; (16 vols, 1847–1849) contained stories to illustrate each of the seven deadly sins; &quot;Les Mystères du peuple&quot; (1849–1856),
a long series of historical novels which was suppressed by the censor in 1857; and several others, all on a very large scale, though the number of volumes gives an exaggerated idea of their length. &quot;Les Mystères du peuple&quot; is a lengthy series of novels and novellas dealing with French history. &quot;Les Mystères du peuple&quot; begins with a novel graphically depicting slavery in the Roman Empire (&quot;The Iron Collar&quot;). Other &quot;Les Mystères du peuple&quot; novels dealt with Early Christianity (&quot;The Silver Cross&quot;), King Clovis I (&quot;The Poniard&#x27;s Hilt&quot;), the founding of the Duchy of Normandy (&quot;The Iron Arrow-Head&quot;), the Crusades in Palestine (&quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Shell&quot;), the Albigensian Crusade (&quot;The Iron Pincers&quot;), the Jacquerie (&quot;The Iron Trevet&quot;), Joan of Arc (&quot;The Executioner&#x27;s Knife&quot;) and the French Revolution (&quot;Sword of Honor&quot;). The novels were translated into English (as the &quot;Mysteries of the People&quot;) and published in New York by Daniel De Leon and his son, Solon. Some of Sue&#x27;s books, among them &quot;The Wandering Jew&quot; and &quot;The Mysteries of Paris&quot;, were dramatized by himself, usually in collaboration with others. His period of greatest success and popularity coincided with that of Alexandre Dumas, with whom he has been compared.

According to Umberto Eco, parts of Sue&#x27;s book &quot;Les Mystères du peuple&quot; served as a source for Maurice Joly in his 1864 work &quot;Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu&quot;, a book attacking Napoleon III and his political ambitions. The two are depicted in Will Eisner&#x27;s cartoon book &quot;The Plot&quot;, co-authored with Eco.

== Political career ==
After the French Revolution of 1848, Sue was elected to the Legislative Assembly from the Paris-Seine constituency in April 1850. He was exiled from Paris in consequence of his protest against the French coup d&#x27;état of 1851. This exile stimulated his literary production. Sue died in Annecy-le-Vieux, Savoy on 3 August 1857 and was buried at the Cimetière de Loverchy (Annecy) in the Non-Catholic&#x27;s Carré des &quot;Dissidents&quot;.

It stars Paul Reiser, Greg Evigan, and Staci Keanan. The series premiered on NBC on September 20, 1987, airing three seasons through to April 30, 1990.

==Synopsis==

The series begins in 1987, after Marcy Bradford (only seen in the second-season episode &quot;In Her Dreams&quot;), the mother of 12-year-old Nicole Bradford, has died. The two men who had competed for Marcy&#x27;s affections in Key West during the summer of 1974, Michael Taylor, a successful but slightly neurotic financial advisor; and Joey Harris, a struggling, but laid-back artist - former friends turned rivals over their mutual interest in Marcy - are awarded joint custody of Nicole.

Each week, the mix-ups and trials of two single men raising a teenage daughter provide the stories. Judge Margaret V. Wilbur, a family court judge who gave custody of Nicole to Michael and Joey, frequently visits the new family. She bought the building in which Joey lived, so is now the live-in landlord. Michael originally has his own condo uptown, but in Episode 2, Nicole stages a sit-in at school because she feels she had no home, and the men decide it is better to all live in one home. They choose Joey&#x27;s loft.

Nicole&#x27;s paternity is never revealed on the show, but in the episode &quot;Pop, the Question,&quot; Michael and Joeyafter a falling outhave a DNA test to determine which of them is Nicole&#x27;s biological father. The test is conducted against Nicole&#x27;s wishes; she is happier not knowing who her true father is, and she destroys the results before opening them. Michael and Joey later resolve their differences and reconcile. Judge Wilbur looks at the results, but throws them away without revealing them to the audience.

The series comes to an end (in the episode called &quot;See You in September?&quot;) when Joey reconnects with a former girlfriend named Sarah, and eventually moves to San Francisco to live with her and her daughter, Grace. He stays in contact with Nicole, Michael and Judge Wilbur, all of whom remain in New York. Nicole writes a letter to Joey, in which she makes reference to going out to San Francisco to visit, and she ends by saying that no matter what, or where he is, or who he is with, she would always be happy with him as one of her two dads.

The exterior shots of the building were taken at 484 Broome Street in New York City. 

==Cast and characters==

===Cast===

*Paul Reiser as Michael Taylor
*Greg Evigan as Joey Harris
*Staci Keanan as Nicole Bradford
*Florence Stanley as Judge Margaret V. Wilbur
*Giovanni Ribisi (credited as Vonni Ribisi) as Cory Kupkus
*Dick Butkus as Ed Klawicki (seasons 1 &amp; 2)
*Chad Allen as Zach Nichols (seasons 2 &amp; 3)
*Amy Hathaway as Shelby Haskell (seasons 2 &amp; 3)

===Characters===
The series regularly featured Giovanni Ribisi and Chad Allen as two boys (Cory Kupkus and Zach Nichols, respectively) who competed for Nicole&#x27;s affections, similar to how her two dads had done for her mother&#x27;s. Florence Stanley appeared as Judge Margaret Wilbur, who was responsible for assigning Nicole&#x27;s custody, and who regularly looked over the family; she was also their landlady, being the resident owner of the apartment building where the family lived. Amy Hathaway played Nicole&#x27;s worldly best friend, Shelby Haskell. The cast was rounded out by former football player Dick Butkus, who managed the cafe on the building&#x27;s first floor. The cafe (Klawicki&#x27;s) was the second spot in the show around which a plot usually revolved; the first being the family&#x27;s apartment. In the third season, when Dick Butkus left the series, the diner was then run by cook Julian (Don), but there was no explanation as to what happened to Ed Klawicki. Ownership of the diner was explained to have been taken over by Judge Wilbur at this point, and it was renamed The Judge&#x27;s Court Cafe.

===&quot;Night Court&quot; crossover===
&quot;My Two Dads&quot; had crossovers with another NBC show, &quot;Night Court&quot;. Judge Margaret W. Wilbur, played by Florence Stanley, appeared on &quot;Night Court&quot;. In turn, Richard Moll guest starred as his &quot;Night Court&quot; character Bull Shannon in the &quot;My Two Dads&quot; episode &quot;Playing with Fire&quot;, protecting Judge Wilbur from a recently released criminal that she had sent to prison years before.

<text>Oneiromancy () is a form of divination based upon dreams, and also uses dreams to predict the future. Oneirogen plants may also be used to produce or enhance dream-like states of consciousness. Occasionally, the dreamer feels as if they are transported to another time or place, and this is offered as evidence they are in fact providing divine information upon their return.

== Oneirocritic literature ==

Oneirocritic literature is the traditional (ancient and medieval) literary format of dream interpretation.
===Ancient oneirocritic literature===
====Mesopotamia====
The ancient Sumerians in Mesopotamia have left evidence of dream interpretation dating back to at least 3100 BC. Throughout Mesopotamian history, dreams were always held to be extremely important for divination and Mesopotamian kings paid close attention to them. Gudea, the king of the Sumerian city-state of Lagash (reigned 2144–2124 BC), rebuilt the temple of Ningirsu as the result of a dream in which he was told to do so. The standard Akkadian &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; contains numerous accounts of the prophetic power of dreams. First, Gilgamesh himself has two dreams foretelling the arrival of Enkidu. Later, Enkidu dreams about the heroes&#x27; encounter with the giant Humbaba. Dreams were also sometimes seen as a means of seeing into other worlds and it was thought that the soul, or some part of it, moved out of the body of the sleeping person and actually visited the places and persons the dreamer saw in his or her sleep. In Tablet VII of the epic, Enkidu recounts to Gilgamesh a dream in which he saw the gods Anu, Enlil, and Shamash condemn him to death. He also has a dream in which he visits the Underworld.

The Assyrian king Ashurnasirpal II (reigned 883–859 BC) built a temple to Mamu, possibly the god of dreams, at Imgur-Enlil, near Kalhu. The later Assyrian king Ashurbanipal (reigned 668– 627 BC) had a dream during a desperate military situation in which his divine patron, the goddess Ishtar, appeared to him and promised that she would lead him to victory. The Babylonians and Assyrians divided dreams into &quot;good&quot;, which were sent by the gods, and &quot;bad&quot;, sent by demons. A surviving collection of dream omens entitled &quot;Iškar Zaqīqu&quot; records various dream scenarios as well as prognostications of what will happen to the person who experiences each dream, apparently based on previous cases. Some list different possible outcomes, based on occasions in which people experienced similar dreams with different results. Dream scenarios mentioned include a variety of daily work events, journeys to different locations, family matters, sex acts, and encounters with human individuals, animals, and deities.

====Egyptian====
In ancient Egypt, as far back as 2000 BC, the Egyptians wrote down their dreams on papyrus. People with vivid and significant dreams were thought to be blessed and were considered special. Ancient Egyptians believed that dreams were like oracles, bringing messages from the gods. They thought that the best way to receive divine revelation was through dreaming and thus they would induce (or &quot;incubate&quot;) dreams. Egyptians would go to sanctuaries and sleep on special &quot;dream beds&quot; in hope of receiving advice, comfort, or healing from the gods.

The oldest oneirocritic manuscript hitherto discovered is the &quot;Ramesside dream-book&quot; now in the British Museum. A unique exemplar of a book of dream-interpretation from pre-Hellenistic Egypt, the surviving fragments were translated into English by Kasia Szpakowska.

Between the paws of the Sphinx, there is a stele describing how Thutmose IV restored the Sphinx as a result of a dream, on the promise of becoming a pharaoh.

====Greek====
Dream divination was a common feature of Greek and Roman religion and literature of all genres. Aristotle and Plato discuss dreams in various works. The only surviving Greco-Roman dreambook, the Oneirocritica, was written by Artemidorus. Artemidorus cites a large number of previous authors, all of whom are now lost. These include Astrampsychos, Nikephoros, Germanos, and Manuel Palaiologos.
Seers who specialized at the interpretation of dreams were called enypniomantis (ἐνυπνιόμαντις) and brizomantis (βριζόμαντις).

* In Book XIX of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Penelopē said that &quot;dreams ... which issue forth from the gate of polished horn bring true issues to pass, when any mortal sees them.&quot; (Here, there may be a pun of /KRainō/ &#x27;I fulfill&#x27; with /KeRas/ &#x27;horn&#x27;.)
* Likewise, Herodotos distinguished /oneiros/ (or /enar/) as &quot;the prophetic, God-sent dream&quot; from /en-upnion/ &quot;the non-predictive dream&quot;.
* In the scheme of Artemidoros, the &quot;oneiros was subdivided into two great categories: ... &quot;allēgorikos&quot;, which corresponds to the Platonic theory of the predictive dream operating in the impure soul, and the ... &quot;theōrēmatikos&quot;, which is the dream represented in the pure state of the soul.&quot;

==== Biblical ====
Dreams occur throughout the Bible as omens or messages from God;
* God speaks to Abram while he is in a deep sleep (Genesis 15);
* God speaks to Abimelech, the king of Gerar, in a dream concerning his intentions regarding Sarah, Abraham&#x27;s wife (Genesis 20);
* Jacob dreams of a ladder to heaven (Genesis 28);
* his son Joseph dreamed of his future success (Genesis 37), interpreted the dreams of Pharaoh of Egypt&#x27;s cupbearer and baker while imprisoned (Genesis 40) and interpreted the dreams of the Pharaoh of Egypt (Genesis 41);
* The Midianite&#x27;s dream about the barley bread and his friend&#x27;s interpretation of it being Gideon&#x27;s army. Gideon overhears this and later defeats the Midianite army (Judges 7);
* Solomon conversed with God in his dreams (1 Kings 3);
* Daniel interpreted dreams (in the Book of Daniel 2 and 4);
* Joseph, when betrothed to Mary, was told in a dream not to fear taking Mary as his wife (Matthew 1);
* the Magi are told in a dream to avoid Herod on their journey home (Matthew 2);
* Joseph, now husband of Mary, was directed in a dream to flee with Mary and Jesus to Egypt (Matthew 2);
* Pilate&#x27;s wife suffered in a dream because of Jesus (Matthew 27);
* Paul was told in a vision to go to Macedonia (Acts 16)

In Acts 2:17, the apostle Peter quotes Joel 2:28, saying that because of the Spirit now out poured, &quot;...your old men will dream dreams.&quot;

===Medieval oneirocritic literature===

====Āstika====
The pertinent material is included in the several Purāṇa-s, such as the &quot;Liṅga Purāṇa&quot;.

====Arabic====
Here, dreams about specific numbers or about reading specific chapters of the Qurʼan are among the chief subjects of prognostication. The most renowned of the Arabic texts of oneiromancy is the &quot;Great Book of Interpretation of Dreams&quot;, a 15th-century compilation of earlier scholarship.

====European====
Achmet is an adaptation of an Arabic book to the tastes of a European readership.

Derived from older literature, modern dream-books are still in common use in Europe and the United States, being commonly sold along with good-luck charms.

====Japanese====
Sei Shonagon refers to having her dreams interpreted in &quot;The Pillow Book&quot;.

The &quot;Taiheiki&quot;, a 14th-century war chronicle, portrays Emperor Godaigo selecting Kusunoki Masashige as the leader of his forces based on a portentous dream.

== Other oneiromantic traditions ==

The indigenous Chontal of the Mexican state of Oaxaca use &quot;Calea zacatechichi&quot;, a flowering plant, for oneiromancy by placing it under the pillow of the dreamer. Similarly, &quot;Entada rheedii&quot; is used in various African cultures.

<doc id="806415" wikidata="Q6507931" url="?curid=806415" title="2001 Thai general election">
<text>General elections were held in Thailand on 6 January 2001 to elect the 500 seats of the House of Representatives. In accordance with the recently enacted 1997 constitution, the House of Representatives was composed of 400 members elected from single-member constituencies and 100 elected from national party lists on a proportional basis.

The Thai Rak Thai party co-founded and led by Thaksin Shinawatra received the most votes and won 248 of the 500 seats on a populist platform of economic growth and anti-corruption. Following the elections, it gained a parliamentary majority by merging with the New Aspiration Party, giving it 286 seats. A coalition government was formed with the Thai Nation Party. The Democrat Party, which had run on a platform supporting neoliberal, IMF-backed economic reforms, went into the opposition with the National Development Party.

<text>[[Protected area]]s in [[Mozambique]] are known as conservation areas, and are currently grouped into national parks, national reserves, forest reserves, wildlife utilisation areas (&quot;coutadas&quot;), community conservation areas, and private game farms (&quot;fazendas de bravio&quot;). There are also a number of areas that have been declared as protected areas under a variety of different legislation, which for reasons of simplicity are here grouped together as &quot;other protected areas.&quot; Under the Conservation Law of 2014 (Law 16/2014 of June 20), protected areas will need to be reclassified into a much more flexible series of new categories which are closer to the international system used by the IUCN.

<text>Ayub Shah Durrani (Persian/Pashto: ), also known as Ayub Shah Abdali, son of Timur Shah Durrani, ruled Afghanistan from 1819 to 1823. He was an Afghan from the Pashtun ethnic group. He was the second oldest son of Timur Shah. He killed his brother Ali Shah Durrani for the throne. He only ruled four years, holding off his own brothers and the Barakzai and Indian tribes from nearby. He was imprisoned by the Barakzai dynasty and his brother took the throne, shortly losing it to the Barakzai.

He was succeeded in 1823 by Dost Mohammad Khan, founder of the Barakzai dynasty.

== Death ==
Ayub Shah Durrani died in 1837.

<doc id="806426" wikidata="Q3492249" url="?curid=806426" title="South End Press">
<text>South End Press was a non-profit book publisher run on a model of participatory economics. It was founded in 1977 in Boston&#x27;s South End. It published books written by political activists, notably Arundhati Roy, Noam Chomsky, bell hooks, Winona LaDuke, Manning Marable, Ward Churchill, Cherríe Moraga, Andrea Smith, Howard Zinn, Jeremy Brecher and Scott Tucker. South End Press closed in 2014.

==History==
South End Press was founded in 1977 by Michael Albert, Lydia Sargent, John Schall, Pat Walker, Juliet Schor, Mary Lea, Joe Bowring, and Dave Millikin, among others. It was based in Boston&#x27;s South End and run as an egalitarian collective with decision-making equally shared.

The publisher experienced financial difficulties in the financial crisis of 2007–08, with sales dropping by 12.8% in 2008. In 2009, South End Press moved to a new office in Brooklyn, New York, partnering with Medgar Evers College of the City University of New York. A fundraising campaign was run in 2012 to help ease its financial situation.

South End Press closed in July 2014. Howard Zinn and an anonymous author had reportedly not received royalties for several years.

==Legacy==
Some of South End Press&#x27;s catalog has been republished including work by Howard Zinn, Noam Chomsky, Dana Frank and Vanessa Tait (by Haymarket Books), Jeremy Brecher (by PM Press), and Eli Clare, Andrea Smith, Frank B. Wilderson III and Dean Spade (by Duke University Press), and Vandana Shiva (by North Atlantic Books).

In 2014, commenting on the demise of the publisher, &quot;Monthly Review&quot; said it was &quot;an important and vital part of the overall left movement&quot;.

==Related projects==
The founders of South End Press have also been involved with two ongoing political media projects, &#x27;Speak Out&#x27; and &#x27;Z Magazine&#x27;. They have worked with a number of media and research institutions including Alternative Radio, Political Research Associates, the Committee on Women, Population and the Environment, and INCITE! Women of Color Against Violence.

<doc id="806434" wikidata="Q2299884" url="?curid=806434" title="Italian irredentism">
<text>Italian irredentism ( ) was a political movement during the late 19th and early 20th centuries in Italy with irredentist goals which promoted the unification of geographic areas in which indigenous peoples were considered to be ethnic Italians. At the beginning, the movement promoted the annexation to Italy of territories where Italians formed the absolute majority of the population, but retained by the Austrian Empire after the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866. 

Even after the Capture of Rome (1871), the final event of the unification of Italy, many ethnic Italian speakers (Trentino-Alto Adigan Italians, Savoyard Italians, Corfiot Italians, Niçard Italians, Swiss Italians, Corsican Italians, Maltese Italians, Istrian Italians and Dalmatian Italians) remained outside the borders of the Kingdom of Italy and this situation created the Italian irredentism. During World War I the main &quot;irredent lands&quot; (&quot;terre irredente&quot;) were considered to be the provinces of Trento and Trieste and, in a narrow sense, irredentists referred to the Italian patriots living in these two areas. 

Italian irredentism was not a formal organization but rather an opinion movement, advocated by several different groups, claiming that Italy had to reach its &quot;natural borders&quot; or unify territories inhabited by Italians. Similar nationalistic ideas were common in Europe in the late 19th century. The term &quot;irredentism&quot;, coined from the Italian word, came into use in many countries (see List of irredentist claims or disputes). This idea of &quot;Italia irredenta&quot; is not to be confused with the &quot;Risorgimento&quot;, the historical events that led to irredentism, nor with nationalism or Imperial Italy, the political philosophy that took the idea further under fascism. 

The term was later expanded to also include multilingual and multiethnic areas, where Italians were a relative majority or a substantial minority, within the northern Italian region encompassed by the Alps, with German, Italian, Slovene, Croatian, Ladin and Istro-Romanian population, such as South Tyrol, Istria, Gorizia and Gradisca and part of Dalmatia. The claims were further extended also to the city of Fiume, Corsica, the island of Malta, the County of Nice and Italian Switzerland.

After the end of World War I, the Italian irredentist movement was hegemonised, manipulated and distorted by fascism, which made it an instrument of nationalist propaganda, placed at the center of a policy, conditioned by belated imperial ambitions, which took the form of &quot;forced Italianizations&quot;, in the aspiration for the birth of a &quot;Great Italy&quot; and a vast Italian Empire. After World War II, Italian irredentism disappeared along with the defeated Fascists and the Monarchy of the House of Savoy. After the Treaty of Paris (1947) and the Treaty of Osimo (1975), all territorial claims were abandoned by the Italian Republic (see Foreign relations of Italy). The Italian irredentist movement thus vanished from Italian politics.

== Characteristics ==
Italian irredentism was not a formal organization but rather an opinion movement, advocated by several different groups, claiming that Italy had to reach its &quot;natural borders&quot; or unify territories inhabited by Italians. Similar nationalistic ideas were common in Europe in the late 19th century.

This idea of &quot;Italia irredenta&quot; is not to be confused with the &quot;Risorgimento&quot;, the historical events that led to irredentism, nor with nationalism or Imperial Italy, the political philosophy that took the idea further under fascism.

During the 19th century, Italian irredentism fully developed the characteristic of defending the Italian language from other people&#x27;s languages such as, for example, German in Switzerland and in the Austro-Hungarian Empire or French in Nice and Corsica.

The liberation of &quot;Italia irredenta&quot; was perhaps the strongest motive for Italy&#x27;s entry into World War I and the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 satisfied many irredentist claims.

Italian irredentism has the characteristic of being originally moderate, requesting only the return to Italy of the areas with Italian majority of population, but after World War I it became aggressive – under fascist influence – and claimed to the Kingdom of Italy even areas where Italians were a minority or had been present only in the past. In the first case there were the &quot;Risorgimento&quot; claims on Trento, while in the second there were the fascist claims on the Ionian Islands, Savoy and Malta.

== History ==
=== Origins ===

The Corsican revolutionary Pasquale Paoli was called &quot;the precursor of Italian irredentism&quot; by Niccolò Tommaseo because he was the first to promote the Italian language and socio-culture (the main characteristics of Italian irredentism) in his island; Paoli wanted the Italian language to be the official language of the newly founded Corsican Republic. 

Pasquale Paoli&#x27;s appeal in 1768 against the French invader said:
Paoli&#x27;s Corsican Constitution of 1755 was written in Italian and the short-lived university he founded in the city of Corte in 1765 used Italian as the official language. Paoli was sympathetic to Italian culture and regarded his own native language as an Italian dialect (Corsican is an Italo-Dalmatian tongue closely related to Tuscan).

After the Italian unification and Third Italian War of Independence in 1866, there were areas with Italian-speaking communities within the borders of several countries around the newly created Kingdom of Italy. The irredentists sought to annex all those areas to the newly unified Italy. The areas targeted were Corsica, Dalmatia, Gorizia, Istria, Malta, County of Nice, Ticino, small parts of Grisons and of Valais, Trentino, Trieste and Fiume.

Different movements or groups founded in this period included the Italian politician Matteo Renato Imbriani inventing the new term &quot;terre irredente&quot; (&quot;unredeemed lands&quot;) in 1877; in the same year the movement &quot;Associazione in pro dell&#x27;Italia Irredenta&quot; (&quot;Association for the Unredeemed Italy&quot;) was founded; in 1885 the &quot;Pro Patria&quot; movement (&quot;For Fatherland&quot;) was founded and in 1891 the &quot;Lega Nazionale Italiana&quot; (&quot;Italian National League&quot;) was founded in Trento and Trieste (in the Austrian Empire).

Initially, the movement can be described as part of the more general nation-building process in Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries when the multi-national Austro-Hungarian, Russian and Ottoman Empires were being replaced by nation-states. The Italian nation-building process can be compared to similar movements in Germany (&quot;Großdeutschland&quot;), Hungary, Serbia and in pre-1914 Poland. Simultaneously, in many parts of 19th-century Europe liberalism and nationalism were ideologies which were coming to the forefront of political culture. In Eastern Europe, where the Habsburg Empire had long asserted control over a variety of ethnic and cultural groups, nationalism appeared in a standard format. The beginning of the 19th century &quot;was the period when the smaller, mostly indigenous nationalities of the empire – Czechs, Slovaks, Slovenes, Croats, Serbs, Ukrainians, Romanians – remembered their historical traditions, revived their native tongues as literary languages, reappropriated their traditions and folklore, in short, reasserted their existence as nations&quot;.

=== 19th century ===

In the early 19th century the ideals of unification in a single Nation of all the territories populated by Italian-speaking people created the Italian irredentism. Many Istrian Italians and Dalmatian Italians looked with sympathy towards the &quot;Risorgimento&quot; movement that fought for the unification of Italy. 

The current Italian Switzerland belonged to the Duchy of Milan until the 16th century, when it became part of Switzerland. These territories have maintained their native Italian population speaking the Italian language and the Lombard language, specifically the Ticinese dialect. Italian irredentism in Switzerland was based on moderate &quot;Risorgimento&quot; ideals, and was promoted by Italian-Ticinese such as .

Following a brief French occupation (1798–1800) the British established control over Malta while it was still formally part of the Kingdom of Sicily. During both the French and British periods, Malta officially remained part of the Sicilian Kingdom, although the French refused to recognise the island as such in contrast to the British. Malta became a British Crown Colony in 1813, which was confirmed a year later through the Treaty of Paris (1814). Cultural changes were few even after 1814. In 1842, all literate Maltese learned Italian while only 4.5% could read, write and/or speak English. However, there was a huge increase in the number of Maltese magazines and newspapers in the Italian language during the 1800s and early 1900s, so as a consequence the Italian was understood (but not spoken fluently) by more than half the Maltese people before WW1.

The Kingdom of Sardinia again attacked the Austrian Empire in the Second Italian War of Independence of 1859, with the aid of France, resulting in the liberation of Lombardy. On the basis of the Plombières Agreement, the Kingdom of Sardinia ceded Savoy and Nice to France, an event that caused the Niçard exodus, that was the emigration of a quarter of the Niçard Italians to Italy. Giuseppe Garibaldi was elected in 1871 in Nice at the National Assembly where he tried to promote the annexation of his hometown to the newborn Italian unitary state, but he was prevented from speaking. Because of this denial, between 1871 and 1872 there were riots in Nice, promoted by the Garibaldini and called &quot;Niçard Vespers&quot;, which demanded the annexation of the city and its area to Italy. Fifteen Nice people who participated in the rebellion were tried and sentenced.

In the spring of 1860 Savoy was annexed to France after a referendum and the administrative boundaries changed, but a segment of the Savoyard population demonstrated against the annexation. Indeed, the final vote count on the referendum announced by the Court of Appeals was 130,839 in favour of annexation to France, 235 opposed and 71 void, showing questionable complete support for French nationalism (that motivated criticisms about rigged results). At the beginning of 1860, more than 3000 people demonstrated in Chambéry against the annexation to France rumours. On 16 March 1860, the provinces of Northern Savoy (Chablais, Faucigny and Genevois) sent to Victor Emmanuel II, to Napoleon III, and to the Swiss Federal Council a declaration - sent under the presentation of a manifesto together with petitions - where they were saying that they did not wish to become French and shown their preference to remain united to the Kingdom of Sardinia (or be annexed to Switzerland in the case a separation with Sardinia was unavoidable). Giuseppe Garibaldi complained about the referendum that allowed France to annex Savoy and Nice, and a group of his followers (among the Italian Savoyards) took refuge in Italy in the following years. 

In 1861, with the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy, the modern Italian state was born. On 21 July 1878, a noisy public meeting was held at Rome with Menotti Garibaldi, the son of Giuseppe Garibaldi, as chairman of the forum and a clamour was raised for the formation of volunteer battalions to conquer the Trentino. Benedetto Cairoli, then Prime Minister of Italy, treated the agitation with tolerance. However, it was mainly superficial, as most Italians did not wish a dangerous policy against Austria or against Britain for Malta.

Many Istrian Italians and Dalmatian Italians looked with sympathy towards the &quot;Risorgimento&quot; movement that fought for the unification of Italy. However, after the Third Italian War of Independence (1866), when the Veneto and Friuli regions were ceded by the Austrians to the newly formed Kingdom of Italy, Istria and Dalmatia remained part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, together with other Italian-speaking areas on the eastern Adriatic. This triggered the gradual rise of Italian irredentism among many Italians in Istria, Kvarner and Dalmatia, who demanded the unification of the Julian March, Kvarner and Dalmatia with Italy. The Italians in Istria, Kvarner and Dalmatia supported the Italian &quot;Risorgimento&quot;: as a consequence, the Austrians saw the Italians as enemies and favored the Slav communities of Istria, Kvarner and Dalmatia. During the meeting of the Council of Ministers of 12 November 1866, Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria outlined a wide-ranging project aimed at the Germanization or Slavization of the areas of the empire with an Italian presence:


Istrian Italians were more than 50% of the total population of Istria for centuries, while making up about a third of the population in 1900. Dalmatia, especially its maritime cities, once had a substantial local ethnic Italian population (Dalmatian Italians), making up 33% of the total population of Dalmatia in 1803, but this was reduced to 20% in 1816. Bartoli&#x27;s evaluation was followed by other claims that Auguste de Marmont, the French Governor General of the Napoleonic Illyrian Provinces commissioned a census in 1809 which found that Dalmatian Italians comprised 29% of the total population of Dalmatia. In Dalmatia there was a constant decline in the Italian population, in a context of repression that also took on violent connotations. During this period, Austrians carried out an aggressive anti-Italian policy through a forced Slavization of Dalmatia. According to Austrian census, the Dalmatian Italians formed 12.5% of the population in 1865. In the 1910 Austro-Hungarian census, Istria had a population of 57.8% Slavic-speakers (Croat and Slovene), and 38.1% Italian speakers. For the Austrian Kingdom of Dalmatia, (i.e. Dalmatia), the 1910 numbers were 96.2% Slavic speakers and 2.8% Italian speakers. In 1909 the Italian language lost its status as the official language of Dalmatia in favor of Croatian only (previously both languages were recognized): thus Italian could no longer be used in the public and administrative sphere.
The Italian population in Dalmatia was concentrated in the major coastal cities. In the city of Split in 1890 there were Dalmatian Italians (12.5% of the population), in Zadar (64.6%), in Šibenik (14.5%), in Kotor (18.7%) and in Dubrovnik (4.6%). In other Dalmatian localities, according to Austrian censuses, Dalmatian Italians experienced a sudden decrease: in the twenty years 1890-1910, in Rab they went from 225 to 151, in Vis from 352 to 92, in Pag from 787 to 23, completely disappearing in almost all the inland locations.

One consequence of irredentist ideas outside of Italy was an assassination plot organized against the Emperor Francis Joseph in Trieste in 1882, which was detected and foiled. Guglielmo Oberdan, a Triestine and thus Austrian citizen, was executed. When the irredentist movement became troublesome to Italy through the activity of Republicans and Socialists, it was subject to effective police control by Agostino Depretis.

Irredentism faced a setback when the French occupation of Tunisia in 1881 started a crisis in French–Italian relations. The government entered into relations with Austria and Germany, which took shape with the formation of the Triple Alliance in 1882. The irredentists&#x27; dream of absorbing the targeted areas into Italy made no further progress in the 19th century, as the borders of the Kingdom of Italy remained unchanged and the Rome government began to set up colonies in Eritrea and Somalia in Africa.

=== World War I ===

Italy entered the World War I in 1915 with the aim of completing national unity: for this reason, the Italian intervention in the World War I is also considered the Fourth Italian War of Independence, in a historiographical perspective that identifies in the latter the conclusion of the unification of Italy, whose military actions began during the revolutions of 1848 with the First Italian War of Independence.

Italy signed the Treaty of London (1915) and entered World War I with the intention of gaining those territories perceived by irredentists as being Italian under foreign rule. According to the pact, Italy was to leave the Triple Alliance and join the Entente Powers. Furthermore, Italy was to declare war on Germany and Austria-Hungary within a month. The declaration of war was duly published on 23 May 1915. In exchange, Italy was to obtain various territorial gains at the end of the war. In April 1918, in what he described as an open letter &quot;to the American Nation&quot; Paolo Thaon di Revel, Commander in Chief of the Italian navy, appealed to the people of the United States to support Italian territorial claims over Trento, Trieste, Istria, Dalmatia and the Adriatic, writing that &quot;we are fighting to expel an intruder from our home&quot;.

The outcome of the World War I and the consequent settlement of the Treaty of Saint-Germain met some Italian claims, including many (but not all) of the aims of the &quot;Italia irredenta&quot; party. Italy gained Trieste, Gorizia, Istria and the Dalmatian city of Zara. In Dalmatia, despite the London Pact, only territories with Italian majority as Zara with some Dalmatian islands, such as Cherso, Lussino and Lagosta were annexed by Italy because Woodrow Wilson, supporting Yugoslav claims and not recognizing the treaty, rejected Italian requests on other Dalmatian territories, so this outcome was denounced as a &quot;Mutilated victory&quot;. The rhetoric of &quot;Mutilated victory&quot; was adopted by Benito Mussolini and led to the rise of Italian fascism, becoming a key point in the propaganda of Fascist Italy. Historians regard &quot;Mutilated victory&quot; as a &quot;political myth&quot;, used by fascists to fuel Italian imperialism and obscure the successes of liberal Italy in the aftermath of World War I.

The city of Fiume in the Kvarner was the subject of claim and counter-claim because it had an Italian majority, but Fiume had not been promised to Italy in the London Pact, though it was to become Italian by 1924 (see Italian Regency of Carnaro, Treaty of Rapallo, 1920 and Treaty of Rome, 1924). The stand taken by the irredentist Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio, which briefly led him to become an enemy of the Italian state, was meant to provoke a nationalist revival through corporatism (first instituted during his rule over Fiume), in front of what was widely perceived as state corruption engineered by governments such as Giovanni Giolitti&#x27;s. D&#x27;Annunzio briefly annexed to this Italian Regency of Carnaro even the Dalmatian islands of Veglia and Arbe, where there was a numerous Italian community.

=== Fascism and World War II ===
After the end of World War I, the Italian irredentist movement was hegemonised, manipulated and distorted by fascism, which made it an instrument of nationalist propaganda, placed at the centre of a policy, conditioned by belated imperial ambitions, which took the form of &quot;forced Italianizations&quot;, in the aspiration for the birth of a &quot;Great Italy&quot; and a vast Italian Empire.

Fascist Italy strove to be seen as the natural result of war heroism against a &quot;betrayed Italy&quot; that had not been awarded all it &quot;deserved&quot;, as well as appropriating the image of Arditi soldiers. In this vein, irredentist claims were expanded and often used in Fascist Italy&#x27;s desire to control the Mediterranean basin. 

To the east of Italy, the Fascists claimed that Dalmatia was a land of Italian culture whose Italians had been driven out of Dalmatia and into exile in Italy, and supported the return of Italians of Dalmatian heritage. Mussolini identified Dalmatia as having strong Italian cultural roots for centuries via the Roman Empire and the Republic of Venice. The Fascists especially focused their claims based on the Venetian cultural heritage of Dalmatia, claiming that Venetian rule had been beneficial for all Dalmatians and had been accepted by the Dalmatian population. The Fascists were outraged after World War I, when the agreement between Italy and the Entente Allies in the Treaty of London of 1915 to have Dalmatia join Italy was revoked in 1919.

To the west of Italy, the Fascists claimed that the territories of Corsica, Nice and Savoy held by France were Italian lands. The Fascist regime produced literature on Corsica that presented evidence of the island&#x27;s &quot;italianità&quot;. The Fascist regime produced literature on Nice that justified that Nice was an Italian land based on historic, ethnic and linguistic grounds. The Fascists quoted Medieval Italian scholar Petrarch who said: &quot;The border of Italy is the Var; consequently Nice is a part of Italy&quot;. The Fascists quoted Italian national hero Giuseppe Garibaldi, a native of Nizza (now called Nice) himself, who said: &quot;Corsica and Nice must not belong to France; there will come the day when an Italy mindful of its true worth will reclaim its provinces now so shamefully languishing under foreign domination&quot;. Mussolini initially pursued promoting annexation of Corsica through political and diplomatic means, believing that Corsica could be annexed to Italy through Italy first encouraging the existing autonomist tendencies in Corsica and then the independence of Corsica from France, that would be followed by the annexation of Corsica into Italy.
In 1923, Mussolini temporarily occupied Corfu, using irredentist claims based on minorities of Italians in the island, the Corfiot Italians. Similar tactics may have been used towards the islands around the Kingdom of Italy – through the Maltese Italians, Corfiot Italians and Corsican Italians in order to control the Mediterranean sea (his &quot;Mare Nostrum&quot;, from the Latin &quot;Our Sea&quot;).

In the 1930s Mussolini promoted the development of an initial Italian irredentism in Durrës, in order to occupy all of Albania later. Durrës (called &quot;Durazzo&quot; in Italian) has been for centuries, during the Middle Ages, a city with territory under the control of the Italian states (Naples, Sicily, Venice), and many Italians settled there. The Durazzo section of the Albania Fascist Party was created in 1938, which was formed by some citizens of the city with distant and recent Italian roots (they started the local Italian irredentism). In 1939, all of Albania was occupied and united to the Kingdom of Italy: Italian citizens (more than 11,000) began to settle in Albania as colonists and to own land in 1940 so that they could gradually transform it into Italian territory. The italianization of Albania was one of Mussolini&#x27;s plans.

During World War II, large parts of Dalmatia were annexed by Italy into the Governorship of Dalmatia from 1941 to 1943. Corsica and Nice were also administratively annexed by Italy in November 1942. Malta was heavily bombed, but was not occupied due to Erwin Rommel&#x27;s request to divert to North Africa the forces that had been prepared for the invasion of the island.

=== Dalmatia and the World Wars ===

Dalmatia was a strategic region during World War I that both Italy and Serbia intended to seize from Austria-Hungary. Italy joined the Triple Entente Allies in 1915 upon agreeing to the Treaty of London (1915) that guaranteed Italy the right to annex a large portion of Dalmatia in exchange for Italy&#x27;s participation on the Allied side. From 5–6 November 1918, Italian forces were reported to have reached Lissa, Lagosta, Sebenico, and other localities on the Dalmatian coast. By the end of hostilities in November 1918, the Italian military had seized control of the entire portion of Dalmatia that had been guaranteed to Italy by the Treaty of London and by 17 November had seized Fiume as well. In 1918, Admiral Enrico Millo declared himself Italy&#x27;s Governor of Dalmatia. Famous Italian nationalist Gabriele d&#x27;Annunzio supported the seizure of Dalmatia and proceeded to Zara in an Italian warship in December 1918.
The last city with a significant Italian presence in Dalmatia was the city of Zara (now called Zadar). In the Austro-Hungarian census of 1910, the city of Zara had an Italian population of 9,318 (or 69.3% out of the total of 13,438 inhabitants). In 1921 the population grew to 17,075 inhabitants, of which 12,075 Italians (corresponding to 70,76%). 

In 1941, during the Second World War, Yugoslavia was occupied by Italy and Germany. Dalmatia was divided between Italy, which constituted the Governorate of Dalmatia, and the Independent State of Croatia, which annexed Ragusa and Morlachia. After the Italian surrender (8 September 1943) the Independent State of Croatia annexed the Governorate of Dalmatia, except for the territories that had been Italian before the start of the conflict, such as Zara. In 1943, Josip Broz Tito informed the Allies that Zara was a chief logistic centre for German forces in Yugoslavia. By overstating its importance, he persuaded them of its military significance. Italy surrendered in September 1943 and over the following year, specifically between 2 November 1943 and 31 October 1944, Allied Forces bombarded the town fifty-four times. Nearly 2,000 people were buried beneath rubble: 10–12,000 people escaped and took refuge in Trieste and slightly over 1,000 reached Apulia. Tito&#x27;s partisans entered Zara on 31 October 1944 and 138 people were killed. With the Peace Treaty of 1947, Italians still living in Zara followed the Italian exodus from Dalmatia and only about 100 Dalmatian Italians now remain in the city.

=== Post-World War II ===

Under the Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947, Istria, Kvarner, most of the Julian March as well as the Dalmatian city of Zara was annexed by Yugoslavia causing the Istrian-Dalmatian exodus, which led to the emigration of between 230,000 and 350,000 of local ethnic Italians (Istrian Italians and Dalmatian Italians), the others being ethnic Slovenians, ethnic Croatians, and ethnic Istro-Romanians, choosing to maintain Italian citizenship.

The Istrian-Dalmatian exodus started in 1943 and ended completely only in 1960. According to the census organized in Croatia in 2001 and that organized in Slovenia in 2002, the Italians who remained in the former Yugoslavia amounted to 21,894 people (2,258 in Slovenia and 19,636 in Croatia).

After World War II, Italian irredentism disappeared along with the defeated Fascists and the Monarchy of the House of Savoy. After the Treaty of Paris (1947) and the Treaty of Osimo (1975), all territorial claims were abandoned by the Italian Republic (see Foreign relations of Italy). The Italian irredentist movement thus vanished from Italian politics. Today, Italy, France, Malta, Greece, Croatia and Slovenia are all members of the European Union, while Montenegro and Albania are candidates for accession. The 1947 Constitution of Italy established five autonomous regions (Sardinia, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Sicily, Aosta Valley and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol), in recognition of their cultural and linguistic distinctiveness.

In the early 1990s, the breakup of Yugoslavia caused nationalistic sentiments to re-emerge in these areas; worthy of note in this regard are the demonstrations in Trieste on 6 October 1991 &quot;for a new Italian irredentism&quot;. These were promoted by the Italian Social Movement and inspired by rumours about negotiations for the passage through Trieste of the Yugoslav troops expelled from Slovenia during the Ten-Day War which saw the participation of thousands of people at the political rally in Piazza della Borsa followed by a long procession through the streets of the city, and on 8 November 1992, again in Trieste.

The same Italian Social Movement and National Alliance asked for the review of the peace treaties signed by Italy after World War II, especially with regard to Zone B of the former Free Territory of Trieste, given that the qualification of Slovenia and Croatia as heirs of Yugoslavia was not a given and that the division of Istria between Slovenia and Croatia contradicted the clauses of the peace treaties which guaranteed the unity of the surviving Italian component in Istria (Istrian Italians), assigned to Yugoslavia after World War II, proposing the creation of an Istrian Euro-region also including the city of Rijeka. These claims, which also concerned Dalmatia (including islands such as Pag, Ugljan, Vis, Lastovo, Hvar, Korčula and Mljet) and the coast with the cities of Zadar, Šibenik, Trogir and Split, remained completely unheeded by all the Italian governments that followed one another in that period.

== Italian populations of the claimed territories ==
Various points were brought forward as arguments in support of the irredentist theses of claim, such as the geographical belonging of those lands to the Italian peninsula or the presence of more or less numerous communities of Italians or Italian speakers.

After World War I the situation of the claimed lands was as follows:
* Italians and Italian speakers in the County of Nice: around 4,000 (estimate);
* Italian speakers in Ticino and Grisons (Switzerland): approximately 230,000;
* Italians and Italian speakers in Dalmatia: around 60,000;
* Italian speakers in Malta: approximately 200,000 estimated;
* Italian speakers in Corsica: approximately 200,000 estimated.

== Italian irredentism by region ==

* Italian irredentism in Dalmatia was the political movement supporting the unification to Italy, during the 19th and 20th centuries, of Adriatic Dalmatia. The Republic of Venice, between the 9th century and 1797, extended its dominion to Istria, the islands of Kvarner and Dalmatia, when it was conquered by Napoleon. After the fall of Napoleon (1814) Istria, the islands of Kvarner and Dalmatia were annexed to the Austrian Empire. Many Dalmatian Italians looked with sympathy towards the &quot;Risorgimento&quot; movement that fought for the unification of Italy. The first events that involved the Dalmatian Italians in the unification of Italy were the revolutions of 1848, during which they took part in the constitution of the Republic of San Marco in Venice. The most notable Dalmatian Italians exponents who intervened were Niccolò Tommaseo and Federico Seismit-Doda.
* Italian irredentism in Istria was the political movement supporting the unification to Italy, during the 19th and 20th centuries, of the peninsula of Istria. It is considered closely related to the Italian irredentism in Trieste and Fiume, two cities bordering the peninsula. When Napoleon conquered the territory of Istria, he found that Istria was populated by Istrian Italians on the coast and in the main cities, but the interior was populated mainly by Croats and Slovenians: this multi-ethnic population in the same peninsula created a situation of antagonism between Slovenes, Croats and Italians, when started the first nationalisms after Napoleon&#x27;s fall. Since 1815 Istria was a part of the Austrian monarchy, and Croats, Slovenians and Italians engaged in a nationalistic feud with each other. As a consequence, Istria has been a theater of a nationalistic ethnic struggle between them during the 19th and 20th centuries. Italian irredentism was actively followed by many Italians in Istria, like the Italian sailor and irredentist Nazario Sauro, native to Capodistria.
* Italian irredentism in Corsica was a cultural and historical movement promoted by Italians and by people from Corsica who identified themselves as part of Italy rather than France, and promoted the Italian annexation of the island. Corsica was part of the Republic of Genoa for centuries until 1768, when the Republic ceded the island to France, one year before the birth of Napoleon Bonaparte in the capital city of Ajaccio. Under France, the use of Corsican (a regional tongue which is closely related to Italian) has gradually declined in favour of the standard French language. Giuseppe Garibaldi called for the inclusion of the &quot;Corsican Italians&quot; within Italy when the city of Rome was annexed to the Kingdom of Italy, but Victor Emmanuel II did not agree to it. The course of Italian irredentism did not affect Corsica very much, and only during the Fascist rule of Benito Mussolini were the first organizations strongly promoting the unification of the island to the Kingdom of Italy founded. Italian was the official language of Corsica until 1859.
* Italian irredentism in Nice was the political movement supporting the annexation of the County of Nice to the Kingdom of Italy. According to some Italian nationalists and fascists like Ermanno Amicucci, Italian- and Ligurian-speaking populations of the County of Nice (Italian: ) formed the majority of the county&#x27;s population until the mid-19th century. However, French nationalists and linguists argue that both Occitan and Ligurian languages were spoken in the County of Nice. During the Italian unification, in 1860, the House of Savoy allowed the Second French Empire to annex Nice from the Kingdom of Sardinia in exchange for French support of its quest to unify Italy. Consequently, the Niçois were excluded from the Italian unification movement and the region has since become primarily French-speaking. The pro-Italian irredentist movement persisted throughout the period 1860–1914, despite the repression carried out since the annexation. The French government implemented a policy of Francization of society, language and culture. The toponyms of the communes of the ancient County have been francized, with the obligation to use French in Nice, as well as certain surnames (for example the Italian surname &quot;Bianchi&quot; was francized into &quot;Leblanc&quot;, and the Italian surname &quot;Del Ponte&quot; was francized into &quot;Dupont&quot;).
* Italian irredentism in Savoy was the political movement among Savoyards promoting annexation to the Savoy dynasty&#x27;s Kingdom of Italy. It was active from 1860 to World War II. During the Italian unification, in 1860, the House of Savoy allowed the Second French Empire to annex Savoy from the Kingdom of Sardinia in exchange for French support of its quest to unify Italy. Italian irredentists were citizens of Savoy who considered themselves to have ties with the House of Savoy dynasty. Savoy was the original territory of the duke of Savoy that later became King of Italy. Since the Renaissance the area had ruled over Piedmont and had for regional capital the town of Chambéry. 
* Italian irredentism in Malta is the movement that uses an irredentist argument to propose the incorporation of the Maltese islands into Italy, with reference to past support in Malta for Italian territorial claims on the islands. Although Malta had formally ceased to be part of the Kingdom of Sicily only since 1814 following the Treaty of Paris, Italian irredentism in Malta was mainly significant during the Italian Fascist era. Until the end of the 18th century Malta&#x27;s fortunes—political, economic, religious, cultural—were closely tied with Sicily&#x27;s. Successive waves of immigration from Sicily and Italy strengthened these ties and increased the demographic similarity. Italian was Malta&#x27;s language of administration, law, contracts and public records, Malta&#x27;s culture was similar to Italy&#x27;s, Malta&#x27;s nobility was originally composed of Italian families who had moved to Malta mainly in the 13th century and the Maltese Catholic Church was suffragan of the Archdiocese of Palermo. For many centuries and until 1936, Italian was the official language of Malta (see Maltese Italian).
* Italian irredentism in Switzerland was a political movement that promoted the unification to Italy of the Italian-speaking areas of Switzerland during the &quot;Risorgimento&quot;. The current Italian Switzerland belonged to the Duchy of Milan until the 16th century, when it became part of Switzerland. These territories have maintained their native Italian population speaking the Italian language and the Lombard language, specifically the Ticinese dialect. In the early 19th century the ideals of unification in a single Nation of all the territories populated by Italian speaking people created the Italian irredentism. Italian irredentism in Switzerland was based on moderate &quot;Risorgimento&quot; ideals, and was promoted by Italian-Ticinese such as Adolfo Carmine.
* Italian irredentism in Corfu was the political movement supporting the unification to Italy, during the 19th and 20th centuries, of the island of Corfu. Corfiot Italians are a population from the Greek island of Corfu (Kerkyra) with ethnic and linguistic ties to the Republic of Venice. Their name was specifically established by Niccolò Tommaseo during the Italian &quot;Risorgimento&quot;. During the first half of the 20th century, Mussolini (whose fascist regime promoted the ideals of Italian irredentism) successfully used the Corfiot Italians as a pretext to occupy Corfu twice. The Italian &quot;Risorgimento&quot; was initially concentrated in the Italian peninsula with the surrounding continental areas (Istria, Dalmatia, Corsica, County of Nice, etc.) and did not reach Corfu and the Ionian islands. One of the main heroes of the Italian &quot;Risorgimento&quot;, the poet Ugo Foscolo, was born in Zante from a noble Venetian family of the island, but only superficially promoted the possible unification of the Ionian islands to Italy. According to historian Ezio Gray, the small communities of Venetian-speaking people in Corfu were mostly assimilated after the island became part of Greece in 1864 and especially after all Italian schools were closed in 1870. After World War I, however, the Kingdom of Italy started to apply a policy of expansionism toward the Adriatic area and saw Corfu as the gate of this sea.

<doc id="806442" wikidata="Q505421" url="?curid=806442" title="Riga International Airport">
<text>RIX Riga Airport (; ) is the international airport of Riga, the capital of Latvia, and the largest airport in the Baltic states with direct flights to 107 destinations as of September 2024. It serves as a hub for airBaltic, SmartLynx Airlines and RAF-Avia, and as one of the base airports for Ryanair. The Latvian national carrier airBaltic is the largest carrier that serves the airport, followed by Ryanair. The airport is located in the Mārupe Municipality west of Riga, approximately 10 km from its city centre.

==History==
The airport was built in 1973 as an alternative to Spilve Airport, which had become outdated. It is a state-owned joint-stock company, with the owner of all shares being the government of Latvia. The holder of the state capital share is Latvia&#x27;s Ministry of Transport.

In March 1995, Uzbekistan Airways began a flight from Tashkent to New York City that stopped in Riga. The carrier operated the service with an Airbus A310. Due to poor demand, the airline rerouted it through Amsterdam three months later. Renovation and modernization of the airport was completed in 2001, coinciding with the 800th anniversary of the founding of the city. Uzbekistan Airways moved the stop on its New York service back to Riga in October 2004. It employed Boeing 767s on the route. Closer ties between Uzbekistan and Latvia and the Latvian government&#x27;s decision to lower the Riga airport&#x27;s fees had encouraged the company to return.

In 2006 and 2016, the new north terminal extensions were opened. A maintenance, repair and overhaul facility was opened in the autumn of 2006, to be run as a joint venture between two local companies: Concors and SR-Technik. In 2010, the first dedicated business aviation terminal of the Baltics opened at the airport. Uzbekistan Airways terminated the Riga–New York flight in October 2017.

==Facilities==
===Terminal===
The airport features a single, two-storey passenger terminal building which has been expanded and upgraded to modern standards several times in recent years. The landside consists of a main hall containing a single row of 36 check-in counters as well as some shops and the security area on the upper floor while the arrivals area, baggage reclaim and some service counters are located on the ground floor below. The airside features departure areas B and C split up into two piers with the former original, smaller boarding area &quot;A&quot; now only used for some arrivals. Both piers feature overall eight stands with jetbridges plus four walk-boarding stands from the upper level as well as several more gates for bus boarding on their ground levels. The B pier is used for Schengen Area departures and arrivals, while the C pier is for non-Schengen Area departures and arrivals. The terminal features outlets by Narvesen, Costa Coffee, and TGI Fridays amongst others, as well as a single airport lounge.

===Runway===
The airport has a single runway in directions &quot;18/36&quot;, which is 3,200 m in length and equipped with ILS CAT II.

===Other facilities===
Both airBaltic and the Latvian Civil Aviation Agency maintain their head offices at Riga International Airport.

==Airlines and destinations==

<doc id="806443" wikidata="Q239649" url="?curid=806443" title="Gordon R. Sullivan">
<text>Gordon Russell Sullivan (25 September 1937 – 2 January 2024) was a United States Army general, who served as the 32nd Chief of Staff of the Army and as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Sullivan also served as acting Secretary of the Army.

After retiring from the Army, Sullivan served as the president and chief executive of the Association of the United States Army for 18 years, from 1998 through 30 June 2016. He also served as the chairman of the board of trustees of Norwich University until 2016. He served as chairman of the boards of The Army Historical Foundation and the Marshall Legacy Institute.

==Early life and education==
Sullivan was born in Boston, Massachusetts on 25 September 1937, the son of Russell E. Sullivan and Penuel E. (Gordon) Sullivan. He was raised in nearby Quincy, and he graduated from Braintree&#x27;s Thayer Academy in 1955. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from Norwich University in 1959. Sullivan took part in the Army Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps while at Norwich and at graduation he received his commission as a second lieutenant of Armor.

Sullivan held a Master of Arts degree in political science from the University of New Hampshire. His professional military education included the United States Army Armor School Officer Basic and Advanced Courses, the United States Army Command and General Staff College, and the United States Army War College.

==Military career==
During his army career, Sullivan served as: Assistant Commandant, United States Army Armor School at Fort Knox, Kentucky from November 1983 to July 1985; Deputy Commandant, United States Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas from March 1987 to June 1988; Commanding General, 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized) at Fort Riley, Kansas from June 1988 to July 1989; Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans; and Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Army from 1990 to 1991. After a tour in Korea from June 1961 to August 1962, he volunteered for Vietnam. After a six-week course of Military Advisor Training and Assistance (MATA) course at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, he was sent to Vietnamese language training at Defense Language Institute, Presidio of Monterey, California. In January 1963, he arrived for his first tour in Vietnam. His overseas assignments included four tours in Europe, two in Vietnam and one in Korea.

Sullivan culminated his service in uniform as the 32nd Chief of Staff of the United States Army—the senior general officer in the army—and a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. As the Chief of Staff of the Army, Sullivan created the vision and led the team that transitioned the army from its Cold War posture. In August 1993, President Bill Clinton assigned the duties and responsibility of acting Secretary of the Army to Sullivan, who continued to serve as chief of staff.

Sullivan retired from the United States Army on 31 July 1995, after more than 36 years of active service. The military march &quot;Architect of Victory&quot; was dedicated to him on the occasion of his retirement.

==Post-army career and later life==
Sullivan was the co-author, with Michael V. Harper, of &quot;Hope Is Not a Method&quot; (Random House, 1996), which chronicles the enormous challenges encountered in downsizing and transforming the post-Cold War army.

Sullivan served as the chairman of the board of trustees of Norwich University, the Army Historical Foundation, and the Marshall Legacy Institute, as well as a member of the MITRE Army Advisory Board, the MIT Lincoln Laboratory Advisory Board, and a Life Trustee of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. He was also the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Association of the United States Army, headquartered in Arlington, Virginia from February 1998 through June 2016. Sullivan was an Advisory Board Member of Spirit of America, a 501(c)(3) organization that supports the safety and success of Americans serving abroad and the local people and partners they seek to help.

In recognition of his military career and his work with AUSA, Sullivan was awarded the prestigious Sylvanus Thayer Award by the United States Military Academy in 2003, and the AUSA General George Catlett Marshall Medal, the Association&#x27;s highest honor, in October 2016.

==CNA Military Advisory Board==
Gen. Sullivan served as the first Chairman of the CNA Military Advisory Board, the first group of retired generals and admirals to examine the national security implications of climate change. Founded in 2006 by Sherri Goodman, the CNA Military Advisory board brought together military leaders from the United States Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. The landmark report of the CNA Military Advisory Board, National Security and the Threat of Climate Change, established the concept of climate change as a “threat multiplier.” General Sullivan stated in 2007 that the time had arrived to end the debate about climate and take action. When asked about the risk he remarked, “We never have 100 percent certainty. We never have it. If you wait until you have 100 percent certainty, something bad is going to happen on the battlefield.” General Sullivan compared the climate and nuclear threats, stating, “Climate change is exactly the opposite. We have a catastrophic event that appears to be inevitable. And the challenge is to stabilize things—to stabilize carbon in the atmosphere. Back then, the challenge was to stop a particular action. Now, the challenge is to inspire a particular action. We have to act if we’re to avoid the worst effects.”

==Personal life and death==
Sullivan was married to Miriam Gay Loftus until her death in 2014. He subsequently married Lori Boyle and lived in Falmouth, Massachusetts. Sullivan had three children and three grandchildren. He was an avid reader, historian, sport fisherman, and sailor.

Sullivan died on 2 January 2024, at the age of 86. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery with military funeral honors on 10 May 2024.

<doc id="806445" wikidata="Q508096" url="?curid=806445" title="Luigi Corti">
<text>Count Luigi Corti (24 October 1823 – 19 February 1888), Italian diplomat, was born at Gambarana in the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia (present-day Province of Pavia). represented Italy at the Congress of Berlin in 1878 together with Edoardo de Launay.

==Biography==
Luigi Corti belonged to a noble and ancient Piedmontese family. Early involved with Benedetto Cairoli in anti-Austrian conspiracies, he was exiled to Turin, where he entered the Piedmontese foreign office. After serving as artillery officer through the campaign of 1848, he was in 1850 appointed secretary of legation in London. He held this post until 6 April 1864, when he was appointed resident minister to the King of Sweden and Norway. Three years later, in 1867, he was promoted envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary, and went in this capacity to Madrid, where he successfully concluded a treaty with the Queen of Spain for the reciprocal extradition of criminals between the two kingdoms. In 1870 he was transferred to Washington in the same capacity, and during the six years he resided in the United States he did much to render the already amicable relations that existed between Italy and that country closer and more cordial. In recognition of his eminent services, in 1875 he was appointed ambassador to Constantinople, representing Italy at the 1876 Constantinople Conference.

Called by Cairoli to the direction of foreign affairs in 1878, he represented the Kingdom of Italy in the Congress of Berlin, but unwisely declined Lord Derby&#x27;s offer for an Anglo-Italian agreement in defence of common interests. At Berlin, he sustained the cause of Greek independence, but in all other respects remained isolated, and excited the wrath of his countrymen by returning to Italy with empty hands.

For a time he withdrew from public life, but in 1881 was again sent to Constantinople by Cairoli, where he presided over the futile conference of ambassadors upon the Egyptian question. In 1886, he was transferred to the London embassy but was recalled by Crispi in the following year after a misunderstanding.

The contract for the construction of the &quot;Maryland&quot; was awarded on 14 March 1986. Her keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Division of the General Dynamics Corporation at Groton, Connecticut, on 22 April 1986.

== Christening and launching ==
&quot;Maryland&quot; was christened and launched on 10 August 1991 during a ceremony held at the Electric Boat shipyard. Vice Admiral Kenneth C. Malley, Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, Vice Admiral Henry G. Chiles, Jr., Commander Submarine Force US Atlantic Fleet and Helen Delich Bentley, the U.S. representative for Maryland&#x27;s 2nd congressional district were in attendance, along with ship sponsor, Sarah Craig Larson, wife of Admiral Charles R. Larson.

== Commissioning ==
On 13 June 1992, &quot;Maryland&quot; was formally commissioned into US Naval service. The principal speaker was Admiral Charles R. Larson, Commander-in-Chief U.S. Pacific Command.

==Service history==
&quot;Maryland&quot; departed Groton for Kings Bay on 15 June 1992 and immediately started preparation for strategic certification, with a successful test launch on 29 Jul 1992, and starting Trident D-5 missile Demonstration and Shakedown Operations (DASO) on 7 July 1992. DASO was completed on 22 October 1992. Various other inspections and training exercises were conducted throughout 1992. &quot;Maryland&quot; returned to Groton on 30 January 1993 for post-shakedown maintenance prior to assuming responsibility for strategic deterrent patrols. &quot;Maryland&quot; returned to Kings Bay, Georgia on 9 April 1993. &quot;Maryland&quot; completed various weapons and tactical certifications and then returned to Kings Bay on 4 May 1993 to join Submarine Squadron 20 and commence preparations for the first strategic deterrent patrol. The initial loadout of Trident D-5 missiles was completed at this point. On 19 June 1993 &quot;Maryland&quot; went underway on her first strategic deterrent patrol, which started her strategic patrol cycle. On 21 September 2012 &quot;Maryland&quot; combined crews in preparation for mid-life refueling and overhaul at Norfolk Naval Ship Yard.

===Grounding===
On 24 September 1993, &quot;Maryland&quot; ran aground at Port Canaveral, Florida, after conducting a medical evacuation of an ill crew member, and returned to Kings Bay to inspect for damage. Damage to the submarine was minimal, and the investigation found that the crew was not responsible. &quot;Maryland&quot; then resumed her second deterrent patrol on 26 September 1993.

===Trident SLBM missile testing===
&quot;Maryland&quot; has been involved in several Follow-on Commander&#x27;s Evaluation Tests (FCET) of its Trident D-5 SLBM missile system. The FCET launches a specially modified missile without a nuclear payload, and is used to test the performance of the Trident missile system.

* FCET 10, performed 3 January 1994. 4 missiles launched.
* FCET 14, performed 21 April 1996. 2 missiles launched.
* FCET 21, performed 26 April 1999. 2 missiles launched.
* FCET 30, performed 5 November 2003. 2 missiles launched.
* FCET 36, performed 21 November 2006. 2 missiles launched.
* FCET 42, performed 8 June 2010. 2 missiles launched.
* FCET 43, performed 9 June 2010. 2 missiles launched.

===Live fire exercise===
On 16 October 2001, &quot;Maryland&quot; joined the Carrier Battle Group in a sink exercise. &quot;Maryland&quot; fired one Mark 48 torpedo which sank ex-.

===Awards===

&quot;Maryland&quot; has been the recipient of many awards, including the following:
* 1995 Submarine Squadron 20 Battle &quot;E&quot; award (both crews).
* 1997 Submarine Squadron 20 Battle &quot;E&quot; award (both crews).
* 2001 Submarine Squadron 20 Battle &quot;E&quot; award (Blue crew).

* 2004 Submarine Squadron 16 Battle &quot;E&quot; award (both crews).
* 2005 Chief of Naval Operations Afloat Safety award (Blue crew).
* 2008 Submarine Squadron 20 Battle &quot;E&quot; award (both crews).
* 2008 Omaha Trophy winner (both crews). This prestigious award is given to the strategic command with the highest performance standards.
* 2009 Submarine Squadron 20 Battle &quot;E&quot; award (both crews).

===Current status===
&quot;Maryland&quot; is currently part of both United States Fleet Forces Command Submarine Squadron 20 and the United States Strategic Command. Her home port is Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, Georgia.

==Symbolism of the &quot;Maryland&quot; insignia==
Dark blue and gold are the colors traditionally associated with the United States Navy. The arms of Maryland hail the state&#x27;s historical roots, while the submarine indicates the present-day &quot;Maryland&quot; is an &quot;Ohio&quot;-class submarine. The trident represents U.S. Navy weaponry and sea prowess; its bottom spike points to the ocean depths, the area of &quot;Maryland&quot;″s operations. The heraldic dolphins symbolize speed, intelligence, and the ability to penetrate the deep. The laurel wreath is emblematic of excellence and accomplishment; its seven stars commemorate both the seven battle stars that battleship earned in World War II and that the state of Maryland was the seventh state to be admitted to the Union.

===Seal===
&quot;Maryland&quot;″s coat of arms is emblazoned upon a white oval enclosed by a blue collar edged on the outside with gold rope and is inscribed in gold letters with the words &quot;USS &quot;Maryland&quot;&quot; above, and &quot;SSBN-738&quot; below.

===Blazon===
The shield features the arms of the state of Maryland, which historically derives from the quartered arms of the Calvert and Crossland families. Its main color is blue, highlighted with silver. Beneath the shield is a scroll in blue, displaying the motto &quot;Timete Deum Solum et Ignominiam&quot; (&quot;Fear Only God and Dishonor&quot;) inscribed in gold letters. This is all superimposed upon a trident wreathed in laurel decorated with seven stars. The trident&#x27;s bottom spike is flanked by two dolphins.

==In popular culture==
* In the 1994 Tom Clancy novel, &quot;Debt of Honor&quot;, &quot;Maryland&quot; is one of several submarines sent to deal with a Japanese invasion of the Northern Mariana Islands.
* In the 1998 television film &quot;Ice&quot;, &quot;Maryland&quot; is sent to evacuate VIPs from the frozen West Coast of the United States after the coastline has become ice-bound, preventing surface vessels from approaching the shore.

<doc id="806449" wikidata="Q607767" url="?curid=806449" title="James Sullivan (governor)">
<text>James Sullivan (April 22, 1744 – December 10, 1808) was an American lawyer and politician in Massachusetts. He was an early associate justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, served as the state&#x27;s attorney general for many years, and as governor of the state from 1807 until his death.

Sullivan was born and raised in Berwick, Maine (then part of Massachusetts), and studied law with his brother John. After establishing a successful law practice, he became actively involved in the Massachusetts state government during the American Revolutionary War, and was appointed to the state&#x27;s highest court in March 1776. He was involved in drafting the state constitution and the state&#x27;s ratifying convention for the United States Constitution. After resigning from the bench in 1782 he returned to private practice, and was appointed Attorney General in 1790. During his years as judge and attorney general he was responsible for drafting and revising much of the state&#x27;s legislation as part of the transition from British rule to independence. While attorney general he worked with the commission that established the border between Maine and New Brunswick, and prosecuted several high-profile murder cases.

Sullivan was a political partisan, supporting the Democratic-Republican Party and subscribing to Jeffersonian republican ideals. He supported John Hancock and Samuel Adams in their political careers, and was a frequent contributor, often under one of many pseudonyms, to political dialogue in the state&#x27;s newspapers. He ran unsuccessfully for governor several times before finally winning the office in 1807. He died in office during his second term.

In addition to his political pursuits Sullivan engaged in charitable and business endeavors. He was a leading proponent of the Middlesex Canal and the first bridge between Boston and Cambridge, and was instrumental in the development of Boston&#x27;s first public water supply. He was the founding president of the Massachusetts Historical Society, and held membership in a variety of other charitable organizations. He wrote one of the first histories of his native Maine, and a legal text on land titles. Legal historian Charles Warren calls him one of the most important legal figures of the time in Massachusetts.

==Life==
James Sullivan was born on April 22, 1744, the fourth son of John Sullivan and Margery Brown Sullivan, in Berwick, in a part of the Province of Massachusetts Bay that is now the state of Maine. Sullivan&#x27;s father was from the Beara peninsula in the Cork /Kerry area and his mother was a child aboard the ship on which they came over. When she was older he wooed and wed her. The elder Sullivan was a schoolteacher and farmer in Berwick. Sullivan was educated at home, and any prospects for military service were dashed when his foot was crushed in a childhood accident. He was also afflicted with epilepsy while relatively young, and suffered generally mild seizures (but sometimes lasting several hours) for the rest of his life. While convalescing from his foot injury he read a great deal, learning Latin and the classics. His elder brother John, who was studying law, was instructed to supply his brother with law books and training. Sullivan studied law in his brother&#x27;s law practice in Durham, New Hampshire, and was eventually admitted to the bar in Massachusetts. He established a practice first in Georgetown, then shortly afterward in Biddeford, where he was the town&#x27;s first resident lawyer. In 1768 he married Hetty Odiorne, the daughter of a successful Portsmouth, New Hampshire merchant.

Sullivan&#x27;s law practice flourished, and by the time he was 30, he was one of York County&#x27;s leading citizens. He supplemented his legal work by acting as an agent for Boston-based merchant interests, including John Hancock, one of Boston&#x27;s wealthiest men. For his services as a lawyer defending land claims, in 1773 Sullivan was offered a tract within one of the claims he defended. He accepted, and the property was organized as Limerick Plantation, named after the birthplace of his father. In 1775 he helped settle the town (personally assisting in the clearing of land), which on March 6, 1787 would be incorporated as the town of Limerick. James Sullivan is regarded as a descendant of the O&#x27;Sullivan Beare clan, from the Beara Peninsula of the Cork and Kerry area. According to John Adams, Sullivan used his financial rewards to invest in local real estate, including farmlands and mills.

===Revolution===
Sullivan was an early and outspoken opponent of British colonial policies leading to the revolution. He was elected to the provincial assembly in 1774. When it first met in June, Sullivan was a leader in calling for a Continental Congress. When Governor Thomas Gage indefinitely delayed the next meeting of the assembly the following October, its members met anyway, establishing the Massachusetts Provincial Congress. This body exercised &quot;de facto&quot; control over Massachusetts during the early years of the American Revolutionary War. In addition to sitting in the provincial congress, Sullivan was a leading organizer of colonial defenses in York County, sitting on its committee of correspondence and other bodies. He was sent in 1775 as part of a commission to inspect the troops and facilities at Fort Ticonderoga in upstate New York, which was nominally under the control of Benedict Arnold, who had been issued a Massachusetts colonel&#x27;s commission and succeeded in capturing it with the assistance of Ethan Allen. The arduous journey made Sullivan ill for several months afterward.
In late 1775 Sullivan was a member of the committee that drafted legislation establishing the Massachusetts State Navy. Under its terms, three positions were established for admiralty judges; Sullivan was appointed to be the admiralty judge for the eastern district (i.e. Maine) in addition to his other duties. During his period of service in the provincial congress he drafted a large amount of legislation and was tireless in his activities on many committees. He resigned this post when in March 1776 he was offered a seat on the Superior Court of Judicature (as the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court was then known).

===Judicial service and postwar activities===
At the time of his appointment to the bench, the position was seen as particularly risky, because it was a clear representation of anti-British authority whose placeholders were thought to be risking their lives should the British succeed in putting down the rebellion. The most noteworthy case Sullivan sat on was a preliminary hearing in &quot;Commonwealth v. Nathaniel Jennison&quot;, one of the Quock Walker cases where the court in 1783 decided that slavery was incompatible with the state constitution. Sullivan publicly expressed opposition to slavery, and predicted in his writings that the issue would become contentious in the future.

Sullivan participated in the 1779 convention that drafted the new state constitution. Between 1780 and 1782 he and the rest of the court were active in harmonizing the state&#x27;s laws with the document, revising and discarding old statutes, and assisting in the drafting of new ones.

In 1779 Sullivan was awarded an honorary degree from Harvard College. He served on the court until 1782, when he resigned because his salary was insufficient to meet his expenses, and he could no longer afford to cover the difference. He opened a law office in Boston, and moved into a house in Menotomy (now Arlington, then still part of Cambridge). Although he was elected to represent Massachusetts at the Congress of the Confederation from 1782 to 1783 he did not attend, again for financial reasons. He was politically active in the state, however, supporting John Hancock and then Samuel Adams for governor. He was a prolific writer, contributing frequently to the political discourse that took place in Massachusetts&#x27; many newspapers under a variety of pseudonyms.

In 1787 Sullivan participated in the defense of individuals charged in participation in Shays&#x27; Rebellion, an uprising in the rural parts of the state begun the previous year. This activity earned him criticism from stalwart pro-government members of the Massachusetts Bar.

When Massachusetts debated ratification of the United States Constitution in 1788, Sullivan was one of a number of Massachusetts politicians who expressed reservations about the document, but generally supported ratification. In the debate he proposed that the convention conditionally adopt the Constitution, subject to Congress considering and acting on a suite of amendments. The seven amendments Sullivan proposed were primarily designed to increase state powers at the expense of Congress and the federal courts; for example, one would have allowed state supreme courts to issues writs of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; for persons charged with federal crimes.

===Attorney General===
John Hancock rewarded Sullivan for his support in 1790 with an appointment as the state&#x27;s attorney general, a post he held until 1807. Although he supported the Democratic-Republican Party, his views were relatively moderate, so he retained the post of state attorney general despite the dominance of the Federalists in the state.

Much of Sullivan&#x27;s legal work after independence was framed by republican ideals. His republicanism was expressed in wide-ranging support for individual rights, including those of women, children, and minorities, and manifested in letters to contemporaries including John Adams, cases he argued as a lawyer, and decisions he made as a judge. As attorney general he defended the state in a Loyalist recovery action involving the rights of married women (who at the time had few rights under the common law doctrine of &quot;coverture&quot;), arguing that Loyalist William Martin&#x27;s wife had in her own right abandoned the property in question.

Sullivan supported harsh laws confiscating the property of Loyalists who fled the country or fought with the British, although he later took on as clients personal friends who were Loyalists seeking to recover their property. In his native Maine he had a mixed record, representing the state against large-scale land proprietors, but also taking work from the latter (who included some of the most powerful politicians in the state). His interest in the tangled difficulties surrounding land titles in Maine prompted him to write a seminal work on the subject in 1801, &quot;The History of Land Titles in Massachusetts&quot;.

The two cases with the highest profile that Sullivan prosecuted while attorney general were both criminal cases. In 1801 he prosecuted the Dedham murderer Jason Fairbanks, who had retained Federalist Harrison Gray Otis as his defense council. Fairbanks was convicted of murdering a local woman, but escaped after his conviction, and was eventually captured near the Canada–US border and hanged. Sullivan and Otis faced off again in 1807 in the sensational trial of Thomas Selfridge, accused of murdering Charles Austin. Selfridge, an older Federalist attorney, had been retained to assist in the collection of a debt from Austin&#x27;s Republican father. In the politically charged atmosphere of the day in Boston, Selfridge, fearing for his own safety, had armed himself with a dueling pistol. The younger Austin had, apparently on his own initiative, sought to beat Selfridge with a cane, and Selfridge fatally shot him in the encounter. Selfridge was defended by a cadre of Federalist lawyers including Otis and Christopher Gore, and was acquitted of murder by a jury whose foreman was Patriot and Federalist Paul Revere.

Sullivan continued to take private legal work even while he served as attorney general. In a career spanning more than forty years, his law practice was among the largest and most successful in the state. He was an acknowledged expert on admiralty law, and is described by legal historian Charles Warren as one of the most important legal figures of the time in Massachusetts.

===Maine–New Brunswick border commission===

In 1796 Sullivan was appointed by Secretary of State Timothy Pickering to be the United States agent to the binational commission established under the terms of the Jay Treaty to formalize the border between Maine and the British (now Canadian) province of New Brunswick. The southern portion of the border had been defined as the Saint Croix River in the 1783 Treaty of Paris, which ended the American Revolutionary War, but there was some question as to which river it actually was because the area was then sparsely peopled and poorly surveyed, and maps of the area contained conflicting references to the named river.

Sullivan&#x27;s responsibility was to gather relevant maps and legal documents, and then present a legal case for the United States&#x27; claim for what the border should be. In addition to researching materials in Massachusetts archives, Sullivan spent a significant amount of time exploring the poorly surveyed and remote Passamaquoddy Bay, attempting to build a case that the Magaguadavic River was the river intended by the treaty negotiators. Which river it was hinged on the location of a 1604 French settlement on an island in the river, and the commissioners and agents explored the area and ordered surveys. The surveys located evidence of the settlement on Saint Croix Island, after which the commission fixed the southern portion of the border on what is now known as the Saint Croix River. (The disposition of some islands in the bay was not settled, and the northern portion of the border would not be fixed until the 1842 Webster-Ashburton Treaty.)

===Governor===
Sullivan received the Republican nomination for governor in 1797 and 1798, but lost to Federalist Increase Sumner (in 1798 by a landslide after the XYZ Affair lent strength to the Federalist cause). Republicanism eventually began gaining ground in Massachusetts, and Sullivan was again nominated in 1805 and 1806 for governor, losing both times to the popular incumbent Governor Caleb Strong. In 1806 the Republicans gained control of the Massachusetts legislature, which managed to very nearly deny Strong a narrow victory. With fewer than 200 votes in the balance, the Republican-controlled legislature scrutinized the returns in a partisan manner, discarding ballots that had misspelled Strong&#x27;s name while retaining those that misspelled Sullivan&#x27;s and performing tallies in ways that favored their candidate. This process concluded with a finding that Strong in fact lacked a majority of votes, which was what was then required to carry the election, as opposed to the modern plurality requirement. Strong&#x27;s Federalist allies in the legislature were able to publicize the partisan nature of the analysis, resulting in a hostile public backlash. He was proclaimed the winner after further, less biased, analysis corrected the count in his favor. In 1807 Sullivan again faced Strong, but was this time decisively victorious, carrying the eastern counties (present-day Maine) by a wide margin amid a series of Republican victories throughout New England.

Although Sullivan sought in some ways to be a moderate voice in the highly partisan disagreements between Federalists and Republicans, he supported the policy of President Thomas Jefferson in embargoing trade with Great Britain and France, who were then embroiled in the Napoleonic Wars. The Embargo Act of 1807 had a significant negative impact on shipping interests based in Massachusetts ports, and Federalists sought to use this, and the threats of war emanating from the Jefferson administration, to unseat Sullivan in 1808. Federalist Senator Timothy Pickering wrote an open letter raising the specter of war and charging Jefferson with failing to publish critical documents in ongoing negotiations. He then asked Sullivan to formally send it to the state legislature, with the view that this would imply Sullivan&#x27;s agreement with its content. Sullivan refused, after which Federalists used that fact to charge that Republicans generally were withholding damaging information. Sullivan&#x27;s defense included letters by Senator John Quincy Adams countering the Federalist charges. While this was sufficient to ensure Sullivan&#x27;s reelection in 1808, control of the legislature was returned to the Federalists. Republicans were unhappy with Sullivan&#x27;s handling of the political attacks, and for his refusal to remove Federalists from patronage positions in the government.

The Federalist legislature immediately launched attacks on Sullivan and the Republicans, which Sullivan was not immediately able to respond to. In the spring of 1808, before the May opening of the legislature, Sullivan&#x27;s health began to decline (epilepsy and an &quot;organic disease of the heart&quot;), so he was unable to seize the initiative. When he finally made his speech to the assembly, he failed to respond to the political aspects of the dispute, and called for national unity in dealing with outside interests. His warnings to Jefferson on the nature of the contentious disputes going on in the state were attributed by Jefferson to his declining mental state. Cognizant of Sullivan&#x27;s precarious health, the Federalists sought a delay in electing a slate of electors for the Electoral College in the 1808 presidential election. Sullivan, who would have vetoed a slate of Federalist electors (as they were then chosen by the legislature and not by popular vote, the Federalist legislative majority would have assured this), he acquiesced in the hopes that elective actions in other states would moot the decision made in Massachusetts. Sullivan also came under criticism by political partisans on both sides for issuing large numbers of exemptions to the embargo, ostensibly to avoid civil strife in the event of a grain shortage.

When the legislature met in November, it rejected a proposal by Sullivan that popular elections determine the state&#x27;s electoral slate, and instead chose a Federalist slate supporting Charles Cotesworth Pinckney for president in a vote boycotted by many Republicans. Based on widespread opinion that the Federalists were likely to lose the presidential election, Sullivan, his health failing, forwarded the electoral votes on to Congress. He died in office on December 10, 1808, aged 64, and was interred in Boston&#x27;s Granary Burying Ground in a tomb shared by colonial governor Richard Bellingham.

==Business, economic development, and charity==
In addition to his political and legal activities, Sullivan engaged in a wide variety of civic and charitable work. He was a founding member and the first president of the Massachusetts Historical Society, was a charter member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and was involved with the Massachusetts Humane Society, the Society for the Propagation of the Faith among the Indians, and a charitable society that supported Congregationalist ministers.

Sullivan was a major moving force and leading director of the company that oversaw the Middlesex Canal (construction of which began in 1793). The canal connected the Merrimack River at present-day Lowell (then still East Chelmsford) to the port of Boston, ending roughly at Sullivan Square, which is named in his honor. He was deeply involved in the canal, purchasing the necessary land and supervising the construction. At the same time he was also involved in the company formed to build the first bridge across the Charles River connecting Boston to Cambridge, and was instrumental in the development of Boston&#x27;s first public water supply, a wooden aqueduct from Jamaica Pond.

==Family and legacy==
Sullivan&#x27;s brothers were active participants in the Revolutionary War. John, Daniel, and Ebenezer, all served in the Continental Army. John served with some distinction until he retired from the army to enter New Hampshire politics in 1779; Ebenezer was captured in the Battle of The Cedars in 1776, and spent some time as a captive among the Mohawk, where he was subjected to torture; Daniel was also captured in action and died aboard a British prison ship. Sullivan, Maine is named for his brother Daniel, one of the early settlers of that area, and several places in New Hampshire are named for John. In 1808, while Sullivan was governor, a small fortification now known as Fort Sullivan was constructed in Eastport, Maine. Who it is named for is uncertain: one early Eastport historian states that John and James are both likely candidates, preferring John for his association with General Henry Dearborn, who ordered the fort&#x27;s construction.

Sullivan and his first wife Hettie had nine children, two of whom died young, and one son who died in 1787 due to the hardships of militia service during Shays&#x27; Rebellion. Hettie died in 1786, and he afterward married Martha Langdon, the widowed sister of New Hampshire politician John Langdon.

Sullivan&#x27;s enduring interest in Maine led him to write &quot;The History of the District of Maine&quot; (published in 1795), the first work to document that history. Maine historian Charles Clark writes that Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;History&quot;, while neither thoroughly researched nor particularly well written, is an &quot;un-self-conscious expression of romantic nationalism&quot; that is &quot;picturesque, romantic, [and] inspired&quot;. Sullivan also predicted that Maine would eventually separate from Massachusetts, because &quot;it is so large and populous, and its situation so peculiar, that it cannot remain long&quot; a part of the other state.

<text>Strumble Head () is a rocky headland in the community of Pencaer in Pembrokeshire, Wales, within the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park. It marks the southern limit of Cardigan Bay. Three islands lie off the head: &quot;Ynys Meicel&quot; – – &quot;Ynys Onnen&quot; and &quot;Carreg Onnen&quot;.

Strumble Head, which is on the Pembrokeshire Coast Path, comprises part of the Strumble Head - Llechdafad Cliffs Site of Special Scientific Interest and is one of the best sites in Britain to view cetaceans, particularly the porpoise which can be spotted in the tidal races around the headland with modest binoculars. Public cetacean watches are frequently organized by the Goodwick-based local marine wildlife conservationist &quot;Sea Trust&quot;. Seals can often be spotted. A wartime experimental microwave transmitter site was converted as a shelter for wildlife fans and was opened by Bill Oddie in 1988. As well as marine mammals, the headland is a particularly good place to observe the passage of migrating birds, especially during the period from the end of July through to November.

The adjacent coast has been the site of numerous shipwrecks. In 2003, a French shipwreck, possibly from the battle of Fishguard, was found nearby. The &quot;Bardse&quot; of the Pile of Fowdrey was wrecked off Strumble Head on 3 October 1763 laden with a cargo of iron and copper from Wicklow bound for Chepstow. In 1915, the barque &quot;Calburga&quot;, one of Canada&#x27;s last square rigged sailing ships, was lost. The crew were able to get to safety on their lifeboat, leaving a dispersed area of wreckage, which remains off the coast 1 mile (1500 metres) south-west of the lighthouse.

The headland gives its name to Strumble Head Lighthouse on the island of &quot;Ynys Meicel&quot;, and Strumble VOR, a way-point in many transatlantic flights.

<doc id="806463" wikidata="Q1033914" url="?curid=806463" title="Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten">
<text>Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten () is a short canon in A minor, written in 1977 by the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt, for string orchestra and bell. The work is an early example of Pärt&#x27;s tintinnabuli style, which he based on his reactions to early chant music. Its appeal is often ascribed to its relative simplicity; a single melodic motif dominates and it both begins and ends with scored silence. However, as the critic Ivan Hewett observes, while it &quot;may be simple in concept...the concept produces a tangle of lines which is hard for the ear to unravel. And even where the music really is simple in its audible features, the expressive import of those features is anything but.&quot; A typical performance lasts about six and a half minutes.

The cantus was composed as an elegy to mourn the December 1976 death of the English composer Benjamin Britten. Pärt greatly admired Britten. Pärt described Britten as possessing the &quot;unusual purity&quot; that he himself sought as a composer. 
It is perhaps Pärt&#x27;s most popular piece, and a 1997 recording by the Hungarian State Opera Orchestra conducted by Tamas Benedek has been widely distributed. Due to its evocative and cinematic feel, the piece has been used extensively as background accompaniment in both film and television documentaries.

==Composition==

===Overview===
Scored for string orchestra and bell (only a single chime is used, on the pitch A, the tonal centre of the piece), &quot;Cantus&quot; exemplifies Pärt&#x27;s tintinnabuli style, using only the pitches of a single A minor scale. The work is based on a simple idea, a descending A-minor scale, and is in the form of a prolation canon, an old technique which Pärt also uses in the work &quot;Festina Lente&quot; (&quot;Hurry slowly&quot;). It is in 6/4 meter and alternates long and short notes.

Pärt has said of &quot;tintinnabulation&quot;: &quot;The complex and many-faceted only confuses me, and I must search for unity. What is it, this one thing, and how do I find my way to it? Traces of this perfect thing appear in many guises – and everything that is unimportant falls away. Tintinnabulation is like this. Here I am alone with silence. I have discovered that it is enough when a single note is beautifully played. This one note, or a silent beat, or a moment of silence, comforts me.&quot;

Each part except the viola is split into two, with one playing notes from the A minor scale, and the other playing only notes from an A minor chord (i.e., A–C–E). These choices have a definite symbolism for Pärt. The former &quot;always signifies the subjective world, the daily egoistic life of sin and suffering, [the latter] meanwhile, is the objective realm of forgiveness.&quot; For Pärt, there is only an apparent dualism here; he believes that &quot;all is one.&quot;

The A natural minor scale has some historical connections. Before major and minor scales became prevalent in Western art music, music, especially the early liturgical music that has been so influential on Pärt, used a system of modes. The idea of musical modes was known to the ancient Greeks, and each was said to have a specific character which could strongly affect the mind. The church modes are formed by using the notes of the C major scale (i.e., the white keys on a piano) but starting at different notes in each mode. A scale of A with no black keys is in the Aeolian mode. Since all natural minor scales derive from the white keys on the piano played from A to A, in choosing the A minor scale Pärt is acknowledging his debt to early church music, or at least affirming his affinity with it.

===Score===
After the three beats of silence that open the score, a tubular bell is struck three times very quietly (&quot;pianissimo&quot;), with 12 beats between the strikes and gap of 18 beats between the groups of three. This bell tells of the death of Britten—it is the funeral bell. It continues to be struck in groups of three widely spaced intervals for most of the piece, fading out for a time in the last 21 bars, only to reappear at the last. After the bell has struck there is a brief pause for three beats of silence, and then the first violins begin setting the pattern which the rest of the ensemble will follow at slower speeds. Half of the first violins begin playing the descending A minor scale, playing first one note from the very top of their range, then returning to the beginning and playing two notes, and then three and four and so on. The other half of the violins play notes from an A minor chord. These notes start a fourth lower and drop in pitch only when it is overrun by the first. This creates a swirling effect of increasing tension which is relieved by dropping the note. They begin playing &quot;very quietly&quot; (&quot;pianississimo&quot;) but gradually over the piece build up until they are playing &quot;very loudly&quot; (&quot;fortississimo&quot;).

The second violins play exactly the same but an octave lower and at half the speed, which means they play 6 beats (one bar) of silence to begin, and appear to enter at the beginning of the second bar. Then the violas, which are the only voice not doubled, join in at quarter speed and another octave lower, the cellos at one eighth, and finally the contrabasses as one sixteenth. The basses are then playing each long note for 32 beats, and each short note for 16.

At bar 65 the first violins hit middle C, and when they do they cease playing the A minor scale and simply play C continuously until the end of the piece (i.e., for more than 250 beats). Eleven bars later the second violins hit a low A and play that continuously. Similarly the other voices gradually find the note that they have been seeking and once reached, they play it continuously until the end. The last to lock into place are the contrabasses which alight on a low A in bar 103. At this stage, the whole ensemble is playing an A minor chord very very loudly, and this continues for five bars, then on the second beat of the last bar they suddenly stop. At that moment, the bell is struck very quietly (&quot;pianissimo&quot;) so that the striking itself is not heard, but only the reverberations as it dies away. As the final bell toll reverberates, with all other instruments silent, the overtones of the bell become prominently audible.

==Subject matter==
The piece is a meditation on death. Pärt&#x27;s biographer, Paul Hillier, suggests that &quot;how we live depends on our relationship with death: how we make music depends on our relationship to silence.&quot; It is significant that the piece begins and ends with silence—that the silence is written in the score. This silence creates a frame around the piece and has spiritual significance. It suggests that we come from silence, and return to silence; it reminds us that before we were born and after we die we are silent with respect to this world.

Speaking on his reaction to Britten&#x27;s death, Pärt admitted,

:Why did the date of Benjamin Britten&#x27;s death – 4 December 1976 – touch such a chord in me? During this time I was obviously at the point where I could recognise the magnitude of such a loss. Inexplicable feelings of guilt, more than that even, arose in me. I had just discovered Britten for myself. Just before his death I began to appreciate the unusual purity of his music – I had had the impression of the same kind of purity in the ballads of Guillaume de Machaut. And besides, for a long time I had wanted to meet Britten personally – and now it would not come to that.

<doc id="806467" wikidata="Q860746" url="?curid=806467" title="Modern philosophy">
<text>Modern philosophy is philosophy developed in the modern era and associated with modernity. It is not a specific doctrine or school (and thus should not be confused with &quot;Modernism&quot;), although there are certain assumptions common to much of it, which helps to distinguish it from earlier philosophy.

The 17th and early 20th centuries roughly mark the beginning and the end of modern philosophy. How much of the Renaissance should be included is a matter for dispute; likewise, modernity may or may not have ended in the twentieth century and been replaced by postmodernity. How one decides these questions will determine the scope of one&#x27;s use of the term &quot;modern philosophy.&quot;

==Modern Western philosophy==

How much of Renaissance intellectual history is part of modern philosophy is disputed: The Early Renaissance is often considered less modern and more medieval compared to the later High Renaissance. Later, by the 17th and 18th centuries, the major figures in philosophy of mind, epistemology, and metaphysics were roughly divided into two main groups. The &quot;Rationalists,&quot; mostly in France and Germany, argued all knowledge must begin from certain &quot;innate ideas&quot; in the mind. Major rationalists were Descartes, Baruch Spinoza, Gottfried Leibniz, and Nicolas Malebranche. The &quot;Empiricists,&quot; by contrast, held that knowledge must begin with sensory experience. Major figures in this line of thought are John Locke, George Berkeley, and David Hume (These are retrospective categories, for which Kant is largely responsible). Ethics and political philosophy are usually not subsumed under these categories, though all these philosophers worked in ethics, in their own distinctive styles. Other important figures in political philosophy include Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

In the late eighteenth century Immanuel Kant set forth a groundbreaking philosophical system that claimed to bring unity to rationalism and empiricism. Whether or not he was right, he did not entirely succeed in ending philosophical disputes. Kant sparked a storm of philosophical work in Germany in the early nineteenth century, beginning with German idealism. The characteristic theme of idealism was that the world and the mind equally must be understood according to the same categories; it culminated in the work of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, who among many other things said in the Preface to his &quot;Elements of the Philosophy of Right&quot; that &quot;The real is rational; the rational is real.&quot;

Hegel&#x27;s work was carried in many directions by his followers and critics. Karl Marx appropriated both Hegel&#x27;s philosophy of history and the empirical ethics dominant in Britain, transforming Hegel&#x27;s ideas into a strictly materialist form, setting the grounds for the development of a science of society. Søren Kierkegaard, in contrast, dismissed all systematic philosophy as an inadequate guide to life and meaning. For Kierkegaard, life is meant to be lived, not a mystery to be solved. Arthur Schopenhauer took idealism to the conclusion that the world was nothing but the futile endless interplay of images and desires, and advocated atheism and pessimism. Schopenhauer&#x27;s ideas were taken up and transformed by Nietzsche, who seized upon their various dismissals of the world to proclaim &quot;God is dead&quot; and to reject all systematic philosophy and all striving for a fixed truth transcending the individual. Nietzsche found this not grounds for pessimism, but the possibility of a new kind of freedom.

19th-century British philosophy came increasingly to be dominated by strands of British Idealism, which incorporated neo-Hegelian and German Idealist thought. As a reaction against this, figures such as Bertrand Russell and George Edward Moore began moving in the direction of analytic philosophy, which was essentially an updating of traditional empiricism to accommodate the new developments in logic of the German mathematician Gottlob Frege.

===Renaissance philosophy===
Renaissance humanism emphasized the value of human beings (see Oration on the Dignity of Man) and opposed dogma and scholasticism. This new interest in human activities led to the development of political science with The Prince of Niccolò Machiavelli. Humanists differed from Medieval scholars also because they saw the natural world as mathematically ordered and pluralistic, instead of thinking of it in terms of purposes and goals. Renaissance philosophy is perhaps best explained by two propositions made by Leonardo da Vinci in his notebooks:
*All of our knowledge has its origins in our perceptions 
*There is no certainty where one can neither apply any of the mathematical sciences nor any of those which are based upon the mathematical sciences.
In a similar way, Galileo Galilei based his scientific method on experiments but also developed mathematical methods for application to problems in physics. These two ways to conceive human knowledge formed the background for the principle of Empiricism and Rationalism respectively.

List of Renaissance philosophers:
* Pico della Mirandola
* Nicolas of Cusa
* Giordano Bruno
* Galileo Galilei
* Niccolò Machiavelli
* Michel de Montaigne
* Francisco Suárez

===Rationalism===

Modern philosophy traditionally begins with René Descartes and his aphorism &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;. In the early seventeenth century the bulk of philosophy was dominated by Scholasticism, written by theologians and drawing upon Plato, Aristotle, and early Church writings. Descartes argued that many predominant Scholastic metaphysical doctrines were meaningless or false. In short, he proposed to begin philosophy from scratch. In his most important work, &quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot;, he attempts just this, over six brief essays. He tries to set aside as much as he possibly can of all his beliefs, to determine what if anything he knows for &quot;certain&quot;. He finds that he can doubt nearly everything: the reality of physical objects, God, his memories, history, science, even mathematics, but he cannot doubt that he is, in fact, doubting. He knows what he is thinking about, even if it is not true, and he knows that he is there thinking about it. From this basis, he builds his knowledge back up again. He finds that some of the ideas he has could not have originated from him alone, but only from God; he proves that God exists. He then demonstrates that God would not allow him to be systematically deceived about everything; in essence, he vindicates ordinary methods of science and reasoning, as fallible but not false.

* René Descartes
* Baruch Spinoza
* Gottfried Leibniz

===Empiricism===

Empiricism is a theory of knowledge that opposes other theories of knowledge, such as rationalism, idealism and historicism. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes (only or primarily) via sensory experience as opposed to rationalism, which asserts that knowledge comes (also) from pure thinking. Both empiricism and rationalism are individualist theories of knowledge, whereas historicism is a social epistemology. While historicism also acknowledges the role of experience, it differs from empiricism by assuming that sensory data cannot be understood without considering the historical and cultural circumstances in which observations are made. Empiricism should not be mixed up with empirical research because different epistemologies should be considered competing views on how best to do studies, and there is near consensus among researchers that studies should be empirical. Today empiricism should therefore be understood as one among competing ideals of getting knowledge or how to do studies. As such empiricism is first and foremost characterized by the ideal to let observational data &quot;speak for themselves&quot;, while the competing views are opposed to this ideal. The term empiricism should thus not just be understood in relation to how this term has been used in the history of philosophy. It should also be constructed in a way that makes it possible to distinguish empiricism from other epistemological positions in contemporary science and scholarship. In other words: Empiricism as a concept has to be constructed along with other concepts, which together make it possible to make important discriminations between different ideals underlying contemporary science.

Empiricism is one of several competing views that predominate in the study of human knowledge, known as epistemology. Empiricism emphasizes the role of experience and evidence, especially sensory perception, in the formation of ideas, over the notion of innate ideas or tradition in contrast to, for example, rationalism which relies upon reason and can incorporate innate knowledge.

List of empiricist philosophers:
* Francis Bacon
* John Locke
* George Berkeley
* David Hume

===Political philosophy===
Political philosophy is the study of such topics as politics, liberty, justice, property, rights, law, and the enforcement of a legal code by authority: their nature and purpose; what (if anything) makes a government legitimate; what rights and freedoms (if any) it should protect and how and why it should do so; what duties (if any) citizens owe to a legitimate government; and when (if ever) it may be legitimately overthrown. In a vernacular sense, the term &quot;political philosophy&quot; often refers to a general view, or specific ethic, political belief, or attitude, about politics that does not necessarily belong to the technical discipline of philosophy.

===Idealism===
Idealism refers to the group of philosophies that assert that reality, or reality as we can know it, is fundamentally a construct of the mind or otherwise immaterial. Epistemologically, idealism manifests as a skepticism about the possibility of knowing any mind-independent thing. In a sociological sense, idealism emphasizes how human ideas—especially beliefs and values—shape society. As an ontological doctrine, idealism goes further, asserting that all entities are composed of mind or spirit. Idealism thus rejects physicalist and dualist theories that fail to ascribe priority to the mind. An extreme version of this idealism can exist in the philosophical notion of solipsism.

List of idealist philosophers:
* Immanuel Kant
* Johann Gottlieb Fichte
* Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling
* Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
* Arthur Schopenhauer
* T. H. Green
* Francis Herbert Bradley
* Josiah Royce
* J. M. E. McTaggart
* John Foster

===Existentialism===
Existentialism is generally considered to be the philosophical and cultural movement that holds that the starting point of philosophical thinking must be the individual and the experiences of the individual. Building on that, existentialists hold that moral thinking and scientific thinking together do not suffice to understand human existence, and, therefore, a further set of categories, governed by the norm of &quot;authenticity&quot;, is necessary to understand human existence.

List of existentialist philosophers:
* Søren Kierkegaard
* Friedrich Nietzsche
* Jean-Paul Sartre
* Simone de Beauvoir
* Karl Jaspers
* Gabriel Marcel
* Martin Heidegger
* Alexander Solzhenitsyn

===Phenomenology===

Phenomenology is the study of the structure of experience. It is a broad philosophical movement founded in the early years of the 20th century by Edmund Husserl, expanded upon by a circle of his followers at the universities of Göttingen and Munich in Germany. The philosophy then spread to France, the United States, and elsewhere, often in contexts far removed from Husserl&#x27;s early work.

List of phenomenologists:
* Edmund Husserl
* Martin Heidegger
* Maurice Merleau-Ponty
* Max Scheler

===Pragmatism===

Pragmatism is a philosophical tradition centered on the linking of practice and theory. It describes a process where theory is extracted from practice and applied back to practice to form what is called &quot;intelligent practice&quot;. Important positions characteristic of pragmatism include instrumentalism, radical empiricism, verificationism, conceptual relativity, and fallibilism.
There is general consensus among pragmatists that philosophy should take the methods and insights of modern science into account.
Charles Sanders Peirce (and his pragmatic maxim) deserves most of the credit for pragmatism, along with later twentieth century contributors William James and John Dewey.

List of pragmatist philosophers:
* Charles Sanders Peirce
* William James
* John Dewey
* Richard Rorty

===Analytic philosophy===
Analytic philosophy came to dominate English-speaking countries in the 20th century. In the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Scandinavia, Australia, and New Zealand, the overwhelming majority of university philosophy departments identify themselves as &quot;analytic&quot; departments. The term generally refers to a broad philosophical tradition characterized by an emphasis on clarity and argument (often achieved via modern formal logic and analysis of language) and a respect for the natural sciences.

List of analytic philosophers:
*Rudolf Carnap
*Gottlob Frege
*George Edward Moore
*Bertrand Russell
*Moritz Schlick
*Ludwig Wittgenstein

<text>Hanauma (; )
is a marine embayment formed within a tuff ring and located along the southeast coast of the Island of Oahu in the Hawaii Kai neighborhood of East Honolulu, in the Hawaiian Islands.

Hanauma is one of the most popular tourist destinations on the Island and has suffered somewhat from overtourism. At one time, this popular tourist destination accommodated over three million visitors per year. In 1956, dynamite was used to clear portions of the reef to make room for telephone cables linking Hawaii to the west coast of the US.

==Name==
The prefix &quot;hana&quot; means bay in the Hawaiian language therefore the name is &quot;uma&quot; bay. There are two etymological interpretations of the second part of its name. One interpretation derives it from the Hawaiian word for curve, referring to either the shape of the feature or to the shape of the indigenous canoes that were launched there. Another stems from the indigenous hand-wrestling game known as &quot;Uma&quot;.

==Marine life==
Hanauma is both a Nature Preserve and a Marine Life Conservation District (the first of several established in the State of Hawaii). Reflecting changes in attitude, its name has changed over time from Hanauma Bay Beach Park to Hanauma Bay Nature Preserve. Visitors are required by law to refrain from mistreating marine animals or from touching, walking, or otherwise having contact with coral heads, which appear much like large rocks on the ocean floor (here, mostly seaward of the shallow fringing reef off the beach). It is always recommended to avoid contacting coral or marine rocks as cuts to the skin can result and neglecting such wounds may bring medical problems.

About 400 species of fish are known to inhabit the bay. Hanauma Bay is known for its abundance of Green sea turtles, &quot;Chelonia mydas&quot;, known as &quot;Honu&quot;. Hanauma is a nursery ground for the immature turtles, which have their nesting grounds at French Frigate Shoals. It is also known for its abundance of parrotfish.

Coral bleaching due to global warming has affected the coral reefs in Hanauma. In 2014 and 2015, 47% of the corals at Hanauma Bay Nature Preserve suffered from coral bleaching, close to 10% of the corals in the nature preserve died.

==Geology==
The Hawaiian Islands are a group of volcanoes that have risen up over a hot spot, which is a section of the Earth&#x27;s surface that has exhibited volcanism for an extended period of time. Volcanic chains such as the Hawaiian Islands form as a result of the movement of a tectonic plate across fixed hot spot beneath the surface. In the case of the Hawaiian Islands, the Pacific plate has moved slowly northwestward over such a hotspot.

Approximately 3.9 million years ago, the Waianae volcano created the island of Oahu. About 2.5 million years ago, the Koolau volcano breached the ocean&#x27;s surface and continued to grow in elevation until about 1.7 million years ago, when it went dormant. Most of the eastern or windward portion of Oahu are remnants of this volcano. Most of the familiar geographic landmarks of eastern Oahu were created by eruptions from Koolau from about 500,000 to 10,000 years ago. The eastern flank of the Koolau volcano including the caldera slid into the sea, leaving the Koolau mountain range that can be seen today on the windward side of the island.

The Hanauma Crater was created about 32,000 years ago during the Honolulu volcanic series, the latest (and perhaps final) round of volcanic activity to occur on Oahu. Tens of thousands of years ago, a series of volcanic vents opened along the southeast shoreline of Oahu. Unlike the gentle lava flows currently building the island of Hawaii, the late-stage eruptions on Oahu were most often short-lived violent explosions. The volcanic vents that formed Hanauma Crater opened on the sea floor. Upwelling magma vaporized the ocean water and steam explosions blew the magma into fine ash. The explosions built cones or rings of ash, which solidified into tuff. The eruptions shattered the sea floor—coral reef and basalt—and scattered pieces that are now embedded in the tuff. Wave erosion eventually cut through the low, southeast wall of the crater, forming the current bay.

==Human history==

Due to the lack of fresh water in the vicinity, the area was not inhabited, although archeologists have found fishing tools and other indications of human presence there. The bay was used as a recreational area by &quot;aliʻi&quot; (Hawaiian nobility), including King Kamehameha and Queen Ka‘ahumanu, who fished, entertained visitors, and sponsored games there. It was also used as a layover and as a navigational lookout point, since the waters between Oʻahu and Molokaʻi are at times difficult.

Hanauma Bay was purchased from the Bernice Pauahi Bishop estate by the City and County of Honolulu, and subsequently opened for public use. It was initially a favorite fishing and picnic spot for residents who were willing to travel out to the bay. In the 1930s the road along Hanauma Bay&#x27;s corner of Oahu was paved and a few other amenities provided that made it easier to visit the beach and reef. After the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, barbed wire was placed at the beach and a bunker was constructed for use by sentries. The Bay area reopened after the war and became even more visitor friendly after blasting in the reef for a transoceanic cable provided room for swimming. Hawaii-themed films and television shows, including &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot;, &quot;Paradise, Hawaiian Style&quot;, &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, and &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, shot footage at the bay.

In 1967, it was set apart by the State division of Fish and Game as a Marine Protected Area, a term used generically to describe any marine area that had some or all of its resources protected. In Hanauma Bay&#x27;s case everything became protected, from the fish to the reef, to the sand itself. A volunteer group set up a booth at the beach and began teaching visitors about conservation of the reef and fish who lived there. More changes in the 1970s by the City cleared more area in the reef for swimming, made an additional parking lot, and shipped in white sand from the North Shore, leaving Hanauma Bay increasingly more attractive to visitors.

By the late 1980s, the bay had become a major attraction on Oahu. Tourists were brought in by the busload and sometimes as many as 13,000 visitors descended on the beach in one day. Most were uneducated about the fragile marine ecosystem and, unwittingly, &quot;these crowds stirred up sediment, disturbed and trampled the coral and algae, dropped trash, fed the fish and left a slick of suntan lotion on the bay&#x27;s surface.&quot; Consequently, the beautiful multicolored coral reef closest to the beach died; only its blackened skeleton is visible today.
By 1990, overuse of the beach and surrounding area was a real problem, with visitors walking on the reef, swarming the surrounding areas, parking on the grass and on the sides of the road. Commercial filming was banned during that year. Measures were taken to limit use and so visitor access was limited to the parking lot, and when it was full everyone after was turned away. In 1997, the city of Honolulu levied an entrance fee on non-residents of the state, leading to a class action lawsuit by a visitor, which was settled in favor of the city during 2004. Then in August 2002 the Marine Education Center was opened at the entrance to the bay, where still today new visitors must watch a short film and receive instruction about conservation of the Bay&#x27;s resources. Upon watching the film, visitors are allowed to sign a form and skip any subsequent film if they should return within the following 365 days.

== Visiting ==
Prior to 2020, Hanauma Bay saw an average of 3,000 visitors a day, with peak days reaching up to 10,000, or about 1 million per year – the majority of them being tourists. One of the largest threats to the bay is the approximately of sunscreen that was deposited into Hanauma Bay every day. Sunscreen containing oxybenzone and octinoxate has been banned from the Hawaiian islands due to the deadly effects it has on coral reefs; however, sunscreens that do not have those harsh chemicals still have an effect on the reef&#x27;s survival. The National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) has found from oceanographic models that it takes approximately 50 hours for sunscreen deposited in a single day to be cycled out of Hanauma Bay. Hanauma Bay received sunscreen that would take two days to get rid of, but since the Bay never closed, the reef would not have the necessary time to recover. The COVID-19 pandemic caused the state park to see record lows, with this they also discovered the rehabilitation of the Hanauma Bay reef. The reservation system has implemented limits it to 1,000 visitors per day, and the park is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays as well as holidays to give the fish a break from all the people disturbing their feeding, breeding, and other natural cycles that allow the reef to process the damage done by sunscreen pollution. The park has since been limited to 720 guests per day and requires online reservations for all non-residents. Upon entry, first-time visitors are required to watch a 9-minute video about the bay, its history, its delicate ecosystem, and how to sustainably visit the Bay, causing as minimal damage to the area as possible.

==Toilet Bowl==

Along the left point is the &quot;Toilet Bowl&quot;, a natural spa tub that gently rises and falls with the tide. However, water in the Toilet Bowl can rise and fall with greater intensity during inclement weather conditions, and has caused injuries. Because of that, The Bowl has been permanently closed.
