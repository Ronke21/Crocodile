<text>The Shropshire Wildlife Trust (SWT) is a wildlife trust covering the geographic county of Shropshire, England.

==Nature reserves==
The trust cares for, or is associated with, 42 nature reserves (plus its headquarters in Shrewsbury – see next section) in the county:

Many of these sites are owned by the Trust – the most recent acquisition by the Trust is Catherton Common, in the Clee Hills, which at 527 acres is the largest Wildlife Trust nature reserve in the West Midlands region. The Trust is currently fund-raising to purchase the leasehold of Pontesford Hill – it already owns the freehold, along with neighbouring Earl&#x27;s Hill. In 2012 the Trust was seeking to purchase the gardens of Charles Darwin&#x27;s family home at The Mount in Shrewsbury, so that they may be opened to the public.

==Headquarters==
The Trust has its main offices and visitor centre at 193 Abbey Foregate near the centre of Shrewsbury – they occupy the former &quot;Shrewsbury Quest&quot; museum, on the corner of Abbey Foregate and Old Potts Way, opposite The Abbey church. The site encompasses a restored medieval building known as the Old Infirmary and a 1730s building called Queen Anne House, as well as gardens, including a herb garden established when the site was the Shrewsbury Quest, and a fruit tree garden. The centre and its gardens is open to the public (usually Monday – Saturday) and has a shop as well as conference rooms available for hire. Many Trust-run events take place here, including children&#x27;s events during the summer holidays. Every year the centre receives approximately 25,000 visitors.

==Local branches==
The Trust currently has 10 local branches active in the county:

*Bridgnorth
*Clun and Bishop&#x27;s Castle
*Ellesmere
*Ludlow
*Market Drayton
*Newport
*Oswestry
**&quot;Oswestry Hills Wildlife Watch&quot;
*Shrewsbury Wildlife Survey Group
*Strettons, The
*Whitchurch

Additionally, in the Telford area the Trust has helped establish the &quot;Telford and Wrekin Forest&quot; initiative, and has &quot;Wrekin Forest Volunteers&quot;.

==Specialist groups==
The county has a wide range of specialist groups, which are associated with the Shropshire Wildlife Trust, including:

*Border Bryologists
*Butterfly Conservation West Midlands
*Shropshire Amphibian and Reptile Group
*Shropshire Badger Group
*Shropshire Barn Owl Group
*Shropshire Bat Group
*Shropshire Botanical Society
*Shropshire Fungus Group
*Shropshire Invertebrate Group
*Shropshire Mammal Group
*Shropshire Moth Group
*Shropshire Ornithological Society
*Shropshire Raven Study Group

==Membership==
As of 2011 the Shropshire Wildlife Trust&#x27;s membership is around 11,000 individuals – the figure was just under 6,000 in the year 2000. This equates to roughly 2.2%, or 1 in 50 Shropshire residents. Annual income from subscriptions has risen from £140,000 in 2000 to £250,000 in 2010. In addition to the membership of individuals, there are also corporate memberships, mainly of organisations (almost all private businesses) based in Shropshire, including Müller Dairy (UK), E.ON UK and Harper Adams University.

<doc id="807304" wikidata="Q6325019" url="?curid=807304" title="KAKM">
<text>KAKM (channel 7) is a PBS member television station in Anchorage, Alaska, United States. Owned by Alaska Public Media, it is sister to NPR member KSKA (91.1 FM). The two stations share studios at the Elmo Sackett Broadcast Center on the campus of Alaska Pacific University; KAKM&#x27;s transmitter is located near Knik, Alaska.

KAKM was the only PBS station in Alaska that was not part of AlaskaOne during its existence. The call letters were chosen to represent the three major geographic areas served by the station: Anchorage, Kenai, and Matanuska.

KAKM operates a full-time satellite station, KTOO-TV (channel 3), licensed to the capital city of Juneau. This station is owned by Capital Community Broadcasting as a sister to non-commercial FM radio stations KTOO, KNLL, and KRNN, but is operated by Alaska Public Media. KTOO&#x27;s transmitter is located in downtown Juneau. KTOO was formerly part of AlaskaOne, until its dissolution in 2012.

KAKM is also relayed on low-power station KYUK-LD (channel 15) in Bethel, owned by Bethel Broadcasting, Incorporated as sister to radio stations KYUK (AM) and KYUK-FM.

==History==
KAKM first started regular transmissions on May 7, 1975, at 7:07 p.m. Previously, PBS programming had been offered to Anchorage stations on a per-program basis: for example, &quot;Sesame Street&quot; was carried on KTVA (channel 11), &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; on KIMO (channel 13, now KYUR) and &quot;The Electric Company&quot; on KENI-TV (channel 2, now KTUU-TV).

KAKM became the flagship station of Alaska Public Television, the successor to AlaskaOne, replacing KUAC-TV in Fairbanks, on July 1, 2012 (which became a standalone station again). As a result, KTOO-TV became a full-time satellite of KAKM. KYUK-LD also rebroadcasts KAKM, but it carries the Alaska Rural Communications Service on its second digital subchannel in place of Create.

==Station presentation==

==Technical information==
The stations&#x27; signals are multiplexed:

===KAKM subchannels===
&lt;section begin=kakmsubs /&gt;

&lt;section end=kakmsubs /&gt;
===KTOO-TV subchannels===
===KYUK-LD subchannels===
360 North provides statewide coverage of Alaska public affairs, documentaries, historical programs, and Native topics. Originating at KTOO-TV, 360 North replaced Gavel to Gavel Alaska, which televised the Alaska Legislature.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KAKM and KTOO shut down their analog signals on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate:
* KAKM shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 7; the station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition VHF channel 8, using virtual channel 7.
* KTOO shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 3; the station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition VHF channel 10, using virtual channel 3.

===Translators===
KAKM and KTOO extend their over-the-air coverage through a network of translator stations.

<doc id="807317" wikidata="Q62477" url="?curid=807317" title="Alfred, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha">
<text>Alfred, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (Alfred Alexander William Ernest Albert; 15 October 1874 – 6 February 1899), was the son and heir apparent of Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. He died aged 24 under circumstances still not entirely clear. He was a first cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, King George V of the United Kingdom and Tsar Nicholas II of Russia.

==Early life==

Prince Alfred of Edinburgh was born on 15 October 1874 at Buckingham Palace, London. His father was Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, second eldest son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. His mother, Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia, was a daughter of Emperor Alexander II of Russia and Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine.

Archibald Campbell Tait, Archbishop of Canterbury, baptised the prince in the Lower Bow Room of Buckingham Palace on 23 November 1874. His godparents were the Queen, the Emperor of Russia (whose son Tsesarevich Alexander stood proxy for him), the German Emperor (for whom Alfred&#x27;s paternal uncle Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn stood proxy), the German Crown Princess (Alfred&#x27;s paternal aunt, for whom her sister Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein stood proxy), the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (his paternal grand-uncle, for whom Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein stood proxy), and the Prince of Wales (his paternal uncle).

==Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha==
In 1893, his granduncle, Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the elder brother of his paternal grandfather, died without legitimate heirs. Being ineligible under Saxe-Coburg-Gotha house law to succeed to the duchy due to his status as the heir apparent to an existing throne, the Prince of Wales had previously renounced his claim to the ducal throne. Thus, the succession devolved to Alfred&#x27;s father, who was at that time the Duke of Edinburgh. Alfred thus became the &quot;Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha&quot;.

Prince Alfred had lived in Clarence House in the early years of his life with his parents and sisters; after his father&#x27;s accession to the ducal throne of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, he moved to Schloss Rosenau, near Coburg.

==Death==

On 23 January 1899 Maria Alexandrovna and her husband celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary at Schloss Friedenstein, the Duke&#x27;s official residence in Gotha. Absent from the festivities was their only son, who was gravely ill.

The exact circumstances of Alfred&#x27;s death are not known, and varying accounts have been published. His sister Marie&#x27;s memoirs simply say his health &quot;broke down&quot;, and other writers have said that he had &quot;consumption&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; published an account stating he had died of a tumour, while the &quot;Complete Peerage&quot; gives the generally accepted account that he &quot;shot himself&quot;.

Various authors have speculated on reasons why he might have killed himself. One author, Frank Bush, claimed to have been a descendant of a secret marriage between Alfred and Mabel Fitzgerald, granddaughter of the 4th Duke of Leinster, and claimed that friction between Alfred and his family over the &quot;secret marriage&quot; was the cause of the suicide. Despite the lack of documentary evidence, and the lack of contemporary reference, other authors have repeated Bush&#x27;s assertion that Alfred and Mabel married, including John van der Kiste and Bee Jordaan in &quot;Dearest Affie&quot;, and the assertion is repeated as fact in the official family history (&quot;Das Haus von Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha&quot;).

According to rumours, Alfred shot himself with a revolver while the rest of the family was gathered for the anniversary celebration. He survived and was looked after at Schloss Friedenstein in Gotha (Thuringia) for three days before being sent to the Martinsbrunn Sanatorium in Gratsch near Meran in the County of Tyrol (Austria-Hungary, now Italy). Alfred died there at 4:15 pm on 6 February 1899, aged 24 years. He was buried in the ducal mausoleum of the &quot;Friedhof am Glockenberg&quot;, Coburg, Bavaria (southern Germany).

After his death, Alfred&#x27;s uncle the Duke of Connaught and his son Prince Arthur of Connaught renounced their succession rights to the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in July 1899. As a result, his first cousin Prince Charles Edward, Duke of Albany, became heir presumptive.

<text>The Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust founded in 1963 is a wildlife conservation charity working to protect and enhance the wildlife and habitats of Nottinghamshire. They care for over 60 nature reserves covering more than of wildlife habitat ranging from wildflower meadows to wetlands to ancient woodland. Key reserves are Attenborough Nature Reserve and Idle Valley Nature Reserve.

They engage the local community through events, information, volunteering and education opportunities and seek to ensure the county is a healthy and wildlife rich place to live. They are one of the 46 members of The Wildlife Trusts and have 11,000 members.

Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust also advise other landowners how to manage their land to benefit wildlife.

Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust is a company limited by guarantee, registered in England no. 748865; and a registered charity.

==History==
The Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust was formed in May 1963 as the Nottinghamshire Trust for Nature Conservation. Attenborough Nature Reserve was the first site to be under the control of the Trust in 1966, when the land was leased from CEMEX. The first reserve the trust purchased outright was Treswell Wood in 1973. In 1989, the Trust purchased a small section of what is now the Idle Valley Nature Reserve, which the Trust has since bought the rest of the site. the Trust were working to purchase Attenborough Nature Reserve from CEMEX, having raised funds in excess of their £1 million target.

<text>The Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust is the Gloucestershire local partner in a conservation network of 46 Wildlife Trusts. The Wildlife Trusts are local charities with the specific aim of protecting the United Kingdom&#x27;s natural heritage. The Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust is managed by a board of trustees elected from its membership who provide overall direction for the development of the trust and there are advisory committees. The work of the trust is carried out through staff and volunteers.

==History==
The trust was founded in 1961 and was then named the Gloucestershire Trust for Nature Conservation. Founder members included Sir Peter Scott, Christopher Cadbury and a group of other local people with the shared interest of nature conservation. The name was changed to the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust in 1991. In 1990 Lady Scott became the trust&#x27;s patron succeeding her late husband, Sir Peter Scott. Originally the trust headquarters was at Church House, Standish, which was opened in 1971. By that year 33 nature reserves were under trust management. In 1989 the Prince of Wales was present at the launch of the appeal for funding for the proposed new nature centre, which was held in Shire Hall, Gloucester. In 1992 a new headquarters and Conservation Centre was opened at Robinswood Hill Country Park by Sir David Attenborough. In 1993 Sir Henry Elwes became the president following the late Lord Dulverton. In 1995 the Prince of Wales visited the Midger SSSI reserve, being one of the woodland reserves in the county. In 1997 the Prince of Wales opened the Lower Woods SSSI Nature Reserve. In 1999 Chris Packham launched an event on Cleeve Common hosted by the trust, which involved geological work at Rolling Bank Quarry SSSI. In 2004 a special 10-year award from &#x27;Investors in People&#x27; was achieved. In 2008 the Badgeworth SSSI nature reserve, the first reserve managed by the trust, celebrated its 75th anniversary. In 2012 this reserve celebrated its 50th anniversary of being managed by the trust.

In December 2014, Ellie Harrison the host of Countryfile became president of the trust taking over from Sir Henry Elwes. In November 2023, Dame Fiona Reynolds became president of the trust.

==Activities==
The trust&#x27;s work includes recording and studying places and objects of natural interest and establishing nature reserves. It undertakes research in the natural sciences, and provides educational material for the public in sustainable development and biodiversity conservation. It operates a schools&#x27; programme for over 2,000 children each year. It campaigns for wildlife and protection of threatened habitats and species. It holds events at its headquarters or on its reserves. It is involved in recycling, waste management and promoting sustainable practices. It advises landowners and local authorities.

The trust publishes a regular printed magazine to keep people informed, and maintains a subscription list for a regular electronic newsletter. The printed magazine was &#x27;Highly Commended&#x27; in the BBC Wildlife Magazine Awards for the Best UK Environmental Charity Publications in 1997.

==Nature reserves==
Gloucestershire is varied in scenery due to the geology. It is also a mainly agricultural county and can be divided into four distinct regions being: the Cotswolds; The Severn Vale; Over Severn and the Forest of Dean. The areas include woodlands, grasslands, heathlands, scrub, standing water, marshes, bogs, floodlands, estuaries.

The trust has over 45 reserves throughout Gloucestershire, covering some 700 hectares or more. The trust issued a reserves handbook in 1979, which has been updated at intervals with a supporting publication for 2009/2010 and for 2011 for the 50th Anniversary of the trust. These reserves are either purchased or managed under agreement. The value of these reserves in respect of special and rare species is defined through national standards, and particularly through Natural England, which sets thresholds for &#x27;favourable condition&#x27; status. Management Plans must be written for all nature reserves. The trust&#x27;s reserves are listed below and include Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs):

==Gloucestershire Centre for Environmental records==
Gloucestershire Centre for Environmental Records (GCER) is the county&#x27;s Local Record Centre and holds data about the county&#x27;s wildlife. GCER has approximately 1,000,000 species records in its database, many of these are supplied by the county recorders from the Gloucestershire Naturalists&#x27; Society. The data are made publicly available. The centre is managed by the trust. In March 2011 the trust and the Gloucestershire Centre for Environmental Records published its &#x27;State of the Natural Environment Report&#x27; on behalf of the Gloucestershire Environmental Partnership (authors: Dr C Studholme, Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust; Linda Moore, Gloucestershire Centre for Environmental Records). In 2012 the trust published its report on the &#x27;State of the Environment in Gloucestershire&#x27; about brownfield land.

==Gloucestershire Biodiversity Partnership==
Gloucestershire has a Biodiversity Action Plan (&quot;BAP&quot;) controlled by the Gloucestershire Biodiversity Partnership, which sets out conservation priorities in Gloucestershire. The Gloucestershire BAP is the local county interpretation of the United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan (1992–2012). The trust is a member of this Partnership together with a wide range of organisations.

The Nature Map for Gloucestershire was launched in March 2008 by the Gloucestershire Biodiversity Partnership. The Gloucestershire Nature Map is part of a larger map covering the whole of the south west region. It locates the major habitats in the county, identifies the &#x27;hotspots&#x27; where they still exist, and thus where they can best be created, enhanced, or restored to establish larger and more viable areas to sustain wildlife for the future. These target areas are called Strategic Nature Areas (SNAs) and the aim is to restore up to 60% of each SNA to good quality wildlife habitat.

==Key Wildlife Sites network==
A Wildlife Sites network currently includes over some 800 sites in the county, which are considered the best places for wildlife to develop. These sites are in addition to Trust nature reserves. This list is maintained by the trust.

==Living Landscapes==
A Living Landscape is a recovery plan for nature. This work has been in the national The Wildlife Trusts programme since 2006.

The Gloucestershire Trust part of the programme has been the initiation of the Living Landscape project in the Severn Vale (2007), the Cotswolds Rivers project (2009) and a project centred on the Forest of Dean (2011).

==Former Nature Reserves and reserves managed under agreement==
*Dowdeswell Reservoir and Wood
* Five Acre Grove
* Foxes Bridge Bog

==Campaigns==
Water voles – A nationally threatened species once common on rivers and streams. In Gloucestershire water voles have disappeared from the river systems and a few fragmented populations survive. The trust provides information to identify a water vole and the land management necessary to support habitat. The water vole is on the list for action in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. The trust carried out a survey in 1978/79 on rivers and streams in the county. A further survey was started in March 1997 in conjunction with the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust. The trust published the results of the 1997/98 survey in 2001. This is reported in the Biodiversity Action Plan for Gloucestershire.

<text>The Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust, (part of the Wildlife Trusts partnership), covers the whole ceremonial county of Lincolnshire, England. It was founded in 1948 as a voluntary charitable organisation dedicated to conserving the wildlife and wild places of Lincolnshire and to promoting the understanding and enjoyment of the natural world.

== Description ==
Its headquarters are at Banovallum House, Manor House Street, Horncastle. It has over 27,000 members and manages 95 nature reserves with a total area of . These include five main visitor-focused reserves used for educational purposes:

*&quot;Gibraltar Point National Nature Reserve&quot; opened in 1949 and was the first nature reserve to be purchased by the Trust. A reserve of sand dunes, salt marsh and brackish pools situated on the coast south of Skegness. Facilities include two car parks and a visitors&#x27; centre with a cafe, shop and toilets.
*&quot;Far Ings National Nature Reserve&quot; opened in 1973. A reserve of lakes, reedbeds and meadows situated in the north of the county on the south bank of the Humber Estuary west of Barton upon Humber. Facilities provided include car parking, toilets, shop and classroom.
* &quot;Whisby Nature Park&quot; opened in 1989. A reserve of lakes, meadows and immature woodland situated in the west of the county alongside the A46 Lincoln by-pass. Facilities include car parking, an education centre with a laboratory and a classroom, an adventure playground for children and the &#x27;Natural World Centre&#x27; with toilets, café, shop and temporary and permanent exhibitions. (The car parks, adventure playground and &#x27;Natural World Centre&#x27; are managed by North Kesteven District Council).
*&quot;Snipe Dales Country Park &amp; Nature Reserve&quot; opened in 1974. A reserve that is part wet grassland and scrub and part conifer woodland situated in the centre of the county on the B1195 Horncastle to Spilsby road. The coniferous woodland is currently being replaced by native broadleaved trees. Facilities include car parking and toilets.
*&quot;Deeping Lakes Nature Reserve&quot; opened in 2004. A reserve of lakes and immature woodland situated in the south of the county on the north bank of the River Welland, it is east of Deeping St James on the B1166 road. Only car parking is provided while the site is being developed.

The Trust employs 78 full and part-time staff who are aided by more than 1,300 volunteers drawn mainly from Trust&#x27;s 16 area groups (&quot;members&#x27; groups&quot;), each of which is based on one of the county&#x27;s main towns. The area groups also organise meetings, visits and social events and are involved in fundraising and membership recruitment.

5,000 of the Trust&#x27;s members are under 16 years of age; these are catered for by the organisation&#x27;s junior wing Wildlife Watch which runs seven groups around the county organising events for children.

The Trust&#x27;s income is derived mainly from members&#x27; subscriptions, money raised by area groups and members, donations, grants from local authorities and government agencies (usually for &quot;special projects&quot;), profits from the Trust&#x27;s sales business and from legacies.

<doc id="807357" wikidata="Q538985" url="?curid=807357" title="Loop-invariant code motion">
<text>In computer programming, loop-invariant code consists of statements or expressions (in an imperative programming language) that can be moved outside the body of a loop without affecting the semantics of the program. Loop-invariant code motion (also called hoisting or scalar promotion) is a compiler optimization that performs this movement automatically.

==Example==
In the following code sample, two optimizations can be applied.
int i = 0;
while (i &lt; n) {
 x = y + z;
 a[i] = 6 * i + x * x;
 ++i;


Although the calculation codice_1 and codice_2 is loop-invariant, precautions must be taken before moving the code outside the loop. It is possible that the loop condition is codice_3 (for example, if codice_4 holds a negative value), and in such case, the loop body should not be executed at all. One way of guaranteeing correct behaviour is using a conditional branch outside of the loop. Evaluating the loop condition can have side effects, so an additional evaluation by the codice_5 construct should be compensated by replacing the codice_6 loop with a codice_7. If the code used codice_8 in the first place, the whole guarding process is not needed, as the loop body is guaranteed to execute at least once.
int i = 0;
if (i &lt; n) {
 x = y + z;
 int const t1 = x * x;
 do {
 a[i] = 6 * i + t1;
 ++i;
 } while (i &lt; n);


This code can be optimized further. For example, strength reduction could remove the two multiplications inside the loop (codice_9 and codice_10), and induction variable elimination could then elide codice_11 completely. Since codice_12 must be in lock step with codice_11 itself, there is no need to have both.

==Invariant code detection==
Usually, a reaching definitions analysis is used to detect whether a statement or expression is loop invariant.

For example, if all reaching definitions for the operands of some simple expression are outside of the loop, the expression can be moved out of the loop.

Recent work by Moyen, Rubiano and Seiller uses data-flow dependence analysis to detect not only invariant commands but larger code fragments such as an inner loop. The analysis also detects quasi-invariants of arbitrary degrees, that is commands or code fragments that become invariant after a fixed number of iterations of the loop body. This technique was later used by Aubert, Rubiano, Rusch, and Seiller to automatically parallelise loops.

==Benefits==
Loop-invariant code which has been hoisted out of a loop is executed less often, providing a speedup. Another effect of this transformation is allowing constants to be stored in registers and not having to calculate the address and access the memory (or cache line) at each iteration.

However, if too many variables are created, there will be high register pressure, especially on processors with few registers, like the 32-bit x86. If the compiler runs out of registers, some variables will be spilled. To counteract this, the inverse optimization can be performed, rematerialization.

<text>Cumbria Wildlife Trust is a wildlife trust covering the county of Cumbria, in North West England. It runs more than 40 nature reserves, and aims to broaden the awareness and knowledge of the wildlife in the county.

==History==
The trust was established in 1962 as the Lake District Naturalists&#x27; Trust. It changed its name to the Cumbria Trust for Nature Conservation in 1974, when the county of Cumbria was created.

Its headquarters are near Kendal, at the edge of the Lake District National Park. Most of the reserves, which include peat bogs (Witherslack Mosses), limestone pavements (Hutton Roof Crags), ancient woodlands and coastal sites (South Walney), are outside the national park. Recent acquisitions include Craggy Wood at Staveley.

==Activities==
The trust runs educational programmes for visitors, suitable for all ages, and welcomes the involvement of volunteers. It also campaigns regionally and nationally on a range of wildlife issues.

In recent years it has been involved with hay meadows (via the Coronation Meadows project and the trust&#x27;s own Meadow Life project) and the designation of Marine Conservation Zones in the Irish Sea.

In 2024, the trust purchased of Skiddaw Forest with the aim of creating England&#x27;s highest nature reserve. The project will see the re-introduction of hen harriers, black grouse, water voles, aspen and rare upland bumblebees, as well as the planting 300,000 native trees The purchase was partly funded by a £5m grant from Aviva, with a public appeal being launched to raise the balance.

<text>Durham Wildlife Trust is a registered charity that was established in 1971, originally as the Durham County Conservation Trust, becoming Durham Wildlife Trust in 1988. The Trust operates across the area of the old County Durham, which includes Darlington, Gateshead, South Tyneside and Sunderland.

Durham Wildlife Trust is part of the federation of 46 charities across the U.K. that together form the Wildlife Trusts. Recognised by their badger logo, each individual Wildlife Trust is an independent organisation conserving wildlife in its local area. The Trusts are membership organisations.

Durham Wildlife Trust manages 50 nature reserves between the Tees and the Tyne. The reserves include areas of ancient woodland, heathland, meadows, wetlands and more, and have helped to save important natural areas in the North East from destruction.

Today Durham Wildlife Trust continues to acquire new reserves and run large scale conservation projects.

== Projects ==
Durham Wildlife Trust leads and partners on numerous projects across the local area. The Trust is currently involved in projects to protect species such as the great crested newt, the water vole and the barn owl, and played an important part in helping to re-establish otters across the county&#x27;s river catchments. Current and recent projects include the following.

=== Heart of Durham ===
The Heart of Durham project is a partnership between Durham Wildlife Trust and Northumbrian Water Limited. It is based around the edge of the North Pennines, from the Derwent Reservoir in the north to Hamsterley Forest in the south. The aim of the project is to restore and recreate areas of habitat so as to create spaces where wildlife can thrive on a landscape scale.

=== Nextdoor Nature ===
The Nextdoor Nature initiative is a £5m UK National Lottery funded project to be delivered by Wildlife Trusts across the country and will leave a natural legacy from the Platinum Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. Nextdoor Nature aims to create a network of community-led rewilding projects across the nation – all part of a total £22m of Lottery investment to mark the Jubilee and improve the lives of people from disadvantaged areas across the UK.

Through Nextdoor Nature, Durham Wildlife Trust supports community groups and schools across Sunderland, South Tyneside, East Durham, and Darlington, encouraging them to work with the wider community to bring wildlife back and make a difference for nature close to where they live.

=== Discover Brightwater ===
The Discover Brightwater Landscape Project is a National Lottery Heritage Fund supported project that aims to reveal, restore and celebrate the heritage of the Brightwater area – the River Skerne catchment. Durham Wildlife Trust are the programme leaders for this Landscape Partnership, which involves 19 different project streams including river habitat improvements, wetland creation, heritage and archaeology involving local communities around the River Skerne catchment from Trimdon Parish in the north to Darlington in the south and Shildon in the west. The project runs from the beginning of 2018 to the end of 2023.

=== Healing Nature ===
The Healing Nature Project ran from January 2021 until March 2022 and was a Green Recovery Challenge Fund project, funded by the Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs (DEFRA), and Gateshead Council, South Tyneside Council, and Sunderland Council.

The project undertook habitat work for wildlife conservation and engaged people and communities with their local area and greenspaces across 20 sites spread across Gateshead, Sunderland and South Tyneside. Public events were attended by over 845 people on project sites and over 531 children from over 29 schools engaged with nature through Healing Nature. Activities included 47.4 hectares of grassland management, 650 m of hedgerow planted, 1.15 hectares of native broadleaf woodland planted and 14,000 wildflower bulbs planted.

==Activities==

=== Durham Biodiversity Partnership ===
The Durham Biodiversity Partnership, which covers the same geographic area as Durham Wildlife Trust, was established in 1996 to oversee the development, implementation and monitoring of the Durham Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP), which is the medium through which the United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan is translated into action within the county of Durham. Members of the Partnership include a wide range of organisations and individuals who have an interest in the BAP.

Durham Wildlife Trust plays an important role in the Partnership. It provides a home for the Partnership at Rainton Meadows, and is represented on the Partnership&#x27;s steering group, alongside representatives from Natural England, the Environment Agency, the Forestry Commission, Northumbrian Water, the Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group, the North East Biodiversity Forum, and the county, city and borough councils within the area. The Trust also operates, on behalf of the Partnership, the Durham Biodiversity Data Service, which provides high-quality species and habitat data.

=== Durham Wildlife Services Ltd ===
Durham Wildlife Services is the Trust&#x27;s consultancy arm, providing an ecological consultancy service to businesses and local authorities. Services offered include preliminary ecological appraisals, assessment of biodiversity net gain and protected species surveys. Profits generated by DWS support the work of Durham Wildlife Trust.

=== Education ===
Education is an important aspect of the Trust&#x27;s work. The main education centre is at Rainton Meadows, near Houghton-le-Spring; as well as being conveniently close to the most populous parts of the county, in Sunderland, Gateshead and South Tyneside, this centre has an indoor classroom and conference centre. At Low Barns, near Bishop Auckland, there is a second education centre, which caters primarily to outdoor activities.

In addition to educational facilities at its own sites, the Trust also has an educational outreach programme, under which Trust staff make visits schools or community groups.

==Nature reserves==
Nature Reserves managed by the Trust include Bishop Middleham Quarry, Hawthorn Dene and Low Barns, and include a range of important habitats, such as Magnesian Limestone grasslands, upland hay meadows and coastal denes. The magnesian limestone grasslands managed by the Trust represent some of the finest examples of this particular habitat type.

The Trust&#x27;s largest reserve is Hedleyhope Fell, near Tow Law at over 200 ha. It is one of the finest examples of recovering mid-altitude heathland in the county – a rare habitat in County Durham. The site is very important because it supports a range of rare and uncommon flora and fauna, including lesser skullcap, stag&#x27;s-horn clubmoss and the velvet ant, which has not been recorded anywhere else in the county. It is also home to a large number of breeding birds and is an important site for the green hairstreak butterfly.

===Sites===
The 50 reserves that the Trust currently manages include the following:

==Notes==

: Durham Wildlife Trust has listed information on habitats and access on each of its reserves on its website.
: Grid references use the British national grid reference system (OSGB36), the system used on Ordnance Survey maps. The grid reference for each reserve relates to the approximate centre of the reserve.

<text>The Essex Wildlife Trust (EWT) is one of 46 wildlife trusts which cover the United Kingdom. The EWT was founded in 1959, and it describes itself as Essex&#x27;s leading conservation charity, which aims to protect wildlife for the future and the people of the county. As of January 2017, it has over 34,000 members and runs 87 nature reserves, 2 nature parks and 11 visitor centres.

Essex has one of the longest coastlines of any English county, with saltmarshes, lagoons, mudflats, grazing marshes, reedbeds and shingle. Its ancient forests were formerly important to the local economy, with wood being used for fuel, construction and bark in the tanning industry. Coppicing is being re-introduced by the EWT to encourage woodland grasses, flowers, invertebrates and birds. A few grasslands on the heavy clays of south- and mid-Essex are still grazed according to traditional methods, supporting a mixture of pasture and fen. Some brownfield sites, often on contaminated soil, have populations of nationally scarce species, particularly invertebrates.

The EWT&#x27;s first site was Fingringhoe Wick, which was established in 1961; its visitor centre has views over the Colne Estuary. The largest site is the Hanningfield Reservoir, which has nationally important numbers of gadwalls and a rare moss. The smallest is Horndon Meadow at ; it is an unimproved hay meadow which has 80 flower species. The whole or part of 6 sites are Ramsar internationally important wetland sites, 29 are Sites of Special Scientific Interest, 3 are national nature reserves, 4 are Special Protection Areas, 2 are Special Areas of Conservation, 7 are Nature Conservation Review sites, 2 are a Geological Conservation Review sites, 2 are scheduled monuments and 7 are local nature reserves.

<doc id="807398" wikidata="Q6837850" url="?curid=807398" title="Michigander">
<text>&quot;Michigander&quot; ( ) and &quot;Michiganian&quot; ( ) are unofficial demonyms for natives and residents of the U.S. state of Michigan. Less common alternatives include &quot;Michiganer&quot;, &quot;Michiganite&quot;, &quot;Michiganese&quot;, &quot;Michigine&quot;, and &quot;Michigoose&quot; (female).

== Difference in terminology ==
=== &quot;Michigander&quot; vs. &quot;Michiganian&quot; ===
While governors Jim Blanchard, John Engler, and Jennifer Granholm used &quot;Michiganian&quot;, more recent governors Rick Snyder and Gretchen Whitmer have used &quot;Michigander&quot;. A 2011 poll indicated 58% of Michigan residents preferred &quot;Michigander&quot;, compared to 12% for &quot;Michiganian&quot;, with 12% having no preference, and 11% not liking either term. In 2017, as part of a unanimous bill to modernize the legislation establishing the Michigan Historical Commission, the state legislature changed a reference from &quot;Michiganian&quot; to &quot;Michigander&quot;, implicitly endorsing the latter term. The federal government continues to use &quot;Michiganian&quot;.

=== &quot;Yooper&quot; ===
Residents of the Upper Peninsula typically refer to themselves instead as &quot;Yoopers&quot; (a formation derived from the initials &quot;U.P.&quot;) either instead of or in addition to a state demonym. They sometimes refer to residents of the Lower Peninsula who live &quot;below the bridge&quot; between the peninsulas as &quot;Trolls&quot;, but this term is rarely self-applied.

==Origins==
&quot;Michiganian&quot; is the term used for the state&#x27;s citizens in &quot;The Collections of the Michigan Pioneer and Historical Society&quot; since the 1870s.

&quot;Michigander&quot; is considered pejorative by some due to the circumstances under which the term was popularized, but others perceive no such negative connotation. Even though the term was in use by at least 1820, it has nevertheless commonly been attributed to Abraham Lincoln, who popularized it when he was a Whig representative in Congress. On July 27, 1848, Lincoln made a speech against Lewis Cass, who had been a long-time governor of the Michigan Territory. Cass was then running for president on a &quot;popular sovereignty&quot; platform that would have let states that were conquered in the Mexican–American War decide whether to legalize slavery. Lincoln accused the Democrats of campaigning on the former President Andrew Jackson&#x27;s coattails by exaggerating their military accomplishments.

But in my hurry I was very near closing on the subject of military tales before I was done with it. There is one entire article of the sort I have not discussed yet; I mean the military tale you Democrats are now engaged in dovetailing onto the great Michigander [i.e. Lewis Cass].

Despite that, Michigan voters would go on to favor Lincoln for President twice, in 1860 and 1864.

<text>Kent Wildlife Trust (KWT) is a conservation charity in the United Kingdom that was founded in 1958, previously known as the Kent Trust for Nature Conservation. It aims to &quot;work with people to restore, save and improve our natural spaces&quot; and to &quot;ensure that 30% of Kent and Medway – land and sea – is managed to create a healthy place for wildlife to flourish&quot;. In 2023, they have reported over 30,000 members and an annual income of £8 million. KWT manages over ninety nature reserves in Kent, of which thirty-seven are Sites of Special Scientific Interest, three are national nature reserves, five are Special Areas of Conservation, four are Special Protection Areas, six are local nature reserves, thirty-eight are in Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and one is a scheduled monument.

Kent is a county in the southeastern corner of England. It is bounded to the north by Greater London and the Thames Estuary, to the west by Sussex and Surrey, and to the south and east by the English Channel and the North Sea. The county town is Maidstone. It is governed by Kent County Council, with twelve district councils: Ashford, Canterbury, Dartford, Dover, Folkestone and Hythe, Gravesham, Maidstone, Thanet, Tonbridge and Malling and Tunbridge Wells. Medway is geographically part of Kent but is a separate unitary authority. The chalk hills of the North Downs run from east to west through the county, with the wooded Weald to the south. The coastline is alternately flat and cliff-lined.

The Wilder Blean project, headed up by the Wildwood Trust and Kent Wildlife Trust, introduced European bison to a 2,500-acre conservation area in Blean, near Canterbury. The reintroduction to the UK in 2022, the first time in 6000 years, consisted of a herd of 3 females and 1 male. Unknown to the rangers, one of the females was pregnant and gave birth to a calf in October 2022, marking the first wild bison born in the UK for the first time in millennia. The herd&#x27;s matriarch gave birth to a male calf in winter 2023. In October 2024, the two younger females of the herd gave birth to an additional two female calves, increasing the herd&#x27;s numbers to 8 animals in total. In January 2025, the project was recognized as one of The Big Issue’s top Changemakers of 2025.

The Chough Reintroduction Project, a partnership between Kent Wildlife Trust, Wildwood Trust and Paradise Park, Cornwall, reintroduced the red-billed chough to South East England where it had previously been extinct for over two centuries. The first of several releases took place at a secret location in Dover in July 2023, releasing eight choughs which came from a zoo-based breeding programme coordinated by Paradise Park in Cornwall. By October 2023, the released choughs had been spotted flying as far as Dover Castle. In May 2024, the first wild red-billed chough chick to be born in Kent for generations was discovered at Dover Castle and was reported to have fledged successfully the following month, but went missing during strong winds in early July. A second release of six female choughs into the wild took place in July 2024. By September 2024 an additional six male choughs had been released into the wild, increasing the total number of wild red-billed chough in Kent to nineteen animals.

<doc id="807421" wikidata="Q318974" url="?curid=807421" title="Vincent of Saragossa">
<text>Vincent of Saragossa (also known as Vincent Martyr, Vincent of Huesca or Vincent the Deacon), the Protomartyr of Spain, was a deacon of the Church of Saragossa. He is the patron saint of Lisbon, Algarve, and Valencia. His feast day is 22 January in the Catholic Church, Anglican Communion, and the Eastern Orthodox Church, with an additional commemoration on 11 November in the Eastern Orthodox Church. He was born at Huesca and martyred under the Emperor Diocletian around the year 304.

== Biography ==
The earliest account of Vincent&#x27;s martyrdom is in a &quot;carmen&quot; (lyric poem) written by the poet Prudentius, who wrote a series of lyric poems, &quot;Peristephanon&quot; (&quot;Crowns of Martyrdom&quot;), on Hispanic and Roman martyrs.

He was born at Huesca, near Saragossa, in Spain sometime during the latter part of the 3rd century. It is believed his father was Eutricius (Euthicius), and his mother was Enola, a native of Osca (Huesca).

Vincent spent most of his life in the city of Saragossa, where he was educated and ordained to the diaconate by Bishop Valerius of Saragossa, who commissioned Vincent to preach throughout the diocese. Because Valerius suffered from a speech impediment, Vincent acted as his spokesman.
When the Roman Emperor Diocletian began persecuting Christians in Spain, both were brought before the Roman governor, Dacian, in Valencia. Vincent and his bishop Valerius were confined to the prison of Valencia. Though he was finally offered release if he would consign Scripture to the fire, Vincent refused. Speaking on behalf of his bishop, he informed the judge that they were ready to suffer everything for their faith, and that they could pay no heed either to threats or promises.

His outspoken manner so angered the governor that he had every sort of torture inflicted on Vincent. He was stretched on the rack and his flesh torn with iron hooks. Then his wounds were rubbed with salt and he was burned alive upon a red-hot gridiron. Finally, he was cast into prison and laid on a floor scattered with broken pottery, where he died. During his martyrdom he preserved such peace and tranquillity that it astonished his jailer, who repented from his sins and was converted. Vincent&#x27;s dead body was thrown into the sea in a sack, but was later recovered by the Christians and his veneration immediately spread throughout the church. The aged bishop Valerius was exiled.


The story that Vincent was tortured on a gridiron is perhaps adapted from the martyrdom of another son of Huesca, Lawrence— Vincent, like many early martyrs in the early hagiographic literature, succeeded in converting his jailer.

According to legend, after being martyred, ravens protected Vincent&#x27;s body from being devoured by vultures, until his followers could recover the body. His body was taken to what is now known as Cape St. Vincent where a shrine was erected over his grave, guarded by flocks of ravens. In the time of Muslim rule in the Iberian Peninsula, the Arab geographer Al-Idrisi noted this constant guard by ravens, for which the place was named by him كنيسة الغراب &quot;Kanīsah al-Ghurāb&quot; (Church of the Raven). King Afonso I of Portugal (1139–1185) had Vincent&#x27;s body exhumed in 1173 and brought it by ship to the Lisbon Cathedral. This transfer of the relics is depicted on the coat of arms of Lisbon.

== Legacy and veneration ==

Three elaborated hagiographies, all based ultimately on a lost 5th-century &quot;Passion&quot;, circulated in the Middle Ages. His &quot;Acts&quot; have been &quot;rather freely colored by the imagination of their compiler&quot;.

Though Vincent&#x27;s tomb in Valencia became the earliest center of his cult, he was also honoured at his birthplace and his reputation spread from Saragossa. The city of Oviedo in Asturias grew about the church dedicated to Vincent. Beyond the Pyrenees, he was venerated first in the vicinity of Béziers, and at Narbonne. Castres became an important stop on the international pilgrimage routes to Santiago de Compostela when the relics of Vincent were transferred to its new abbey-church dedicated to Saint Benedict from Saragossa in 863, under the patronage of Salomon, count of Cerdanya.
A church was built in honour of Vincent, by the Catholic bishops of Visigothic Iberia, when they succeeded in converting King Reccared and his nobles to Trinitarian Christianity. When the Moors came in 711, the church was razed, and its materials incorporated in the &quot;Mezquita&quot;, the &quot;Great Mosque&quot; of Cordova.

The Cape Verde island of São Vicente, a former Portuguese colony, was named in his honour because it was discovered on 22 January, Saint Vincent&#x27;s feast day, in 1462.

The island of St. Vincent in the Caribbean, now a part of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, was named by Christopher Columbus after Vincent of Saragossa, as the island was discovered by Europeans on 22 January, Saint Vincent&#x27;s feast day.

The 15th century Portuguese artist Nuno Gonçalves depicted him in his Saint Vincent Panels. A small fresco cycle of stories of Vincent is in the apse of the Basilica di San Vincenzo near Cantù, in northern Italy.
Vincent&#x27;s left arm is on display as a relic in Valencia Cathedral, located near the extensive Carrer de Sant Vicent Mártir (Saint Vincent the Martyr Street).

There is also the small town of São Vicente on the Portuguese island of Madeira, and the city of São Vicente, São Paulo in Brazil named after this saint.

Vincent is remembered in the Anglican Communion with a commemoration on 22 January. The Anglican St. Vincent&#x27;s Cathedral in Bedford, Texas, is dedicated in his honor.

=== Patronage ===
Saint Vincent is the patron of the Order of the Deacons of the Catholic Diocese of Bergamo. He is honoured as patron in Valencia, Saragossa, and Portugal, and is invoked by vignerons (wine-makers), vintners (wine-merchants), vinegar-makers, brickmakers, and sailors.

=== Iconography ===
Vincent of Saragossa is portrayed as a deacon; in the Western church, wearing the dalmatic of a deacon.

<text>Alaska Public Media is a non-profit organization with member television and radio stations that are part of PBS, NPR and other public broadcasting networks. Formerly known as Alaska Public Telecommunications, Inc., Alaska Public Media relies upon several funding sources, including member donations, state and federal dollars, and grants from private foundations, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), and other organizations.

Alaska Public Media operates KAKM, a television station affiliated with PBS, along with public radio station KSKA (91.1 FM). Alaska Public Media also operates the Statewide News, formerly known as Alaska Public Radio Network (APRN), a network of more than 25 radio stations in Alaska that share news and other audio content statewide; as well as Alaska&#x27;s omnibus television network, the [[Alaska Rural Communications Service]], which is a joint venture of Alaska Public Media and Alaska&#x27;s public broadcasters.

The stations claim 54,000 TV viewers nightly and 37,000 radio listeners weekly in the south-central Alaska region. Alaska Public Television is viewed statewide except in the Fairbanks area, which is served by KUAC-TV as a locally-focused PBS station.

== History ==
Alaska Public Media started life as KAKM channel 7 (Alaska Public Television, INC) signing on the air on May 7, 1975 at 7:07pm at the Consortium Library. The station soon outgrew their studios and with effort from then general manager Elmo Sackett had their new permanent location constructed on the Alaska Methodist University campus (today known as Alaska Pacific University). Later named the Elmo Sackett Broadcast Center. KSKA, having lived on the APU campus in Grant Hall since it went on the air in 1978 had previously expressed interest in moving into this location but didn&#x27;t put any major effort into its construction; it would be later in 1993 after the building had completed its construction that they moved forward with the merger. In 2004, Alaska Public Radio Network (APRN) merged with APTI.

KSKA first signed on 103.1 MHz at 3,000 W under Aurora Community Broadcasting on August 15, 1978. In 1980, KSKA moved to 91.1 MHz and increased its power to 36,000 W, then finally increasing its power level to 100,000 W in 1998. In 2007 KSKA started broadcasting in HD, but later discontinued it due to its costs. KSKA&#x27;s new transmitter is capable of doing HD broadcasts, but it is unknown if or when they will start up its HD signal again.

KAKM operated as a separate public television station until 2011 when AlaskaOne&#x27;s board (Alaska Public Broadcasting Service) voted to move operations from KUAC in Fairbanks to KAKM in Anchorage. There are references that KAKM contributed to the &quot;Public Television Network of Alaska&quot; but KAKM was never part of AlaskaOne. KTOO and KYUK later merged operations with KAKM to form Alaska Public Television.

In 2020 Alaska Public Media took operational control of ARCS (Alaska Rural Communications Service) from Alaska Public Broadcasting, INC. The State of Alaska owns the licenses and holds the contract to the satellite uplink to the translator network of 150+ different locations around the state. Despite the Dunleavy administration cutting funding to public media in the state, funding remains for ARCS.

From 1976 to 2023, Alaska Public Media and the National Weather Service produced &quot;Alaska Weather&quot;, a metrological broadcast that was transmitted through ARCS.

Alaska Public Media TV shows include the public affairs show &quot;Alaska Insight&quot; and short video showcase &quot;Indie Alaska&quot;.

<text>Introversion Software Limited is a British video game developer based in Walton-on-Thames, England.

==History==
The company was founded in 2001 by three friends, Chris Delay, Mark Morris, and Thomas Arundel, who met as undergraduates at Imperial College London. The company originally labelled itself &quot;the last of the bedroom programmers&quot; due to the trio working out of their homes – they moved into an office when working on their fourth game, &quot;Multiwinia&quot;. Their first released video game, &quot;Uplink&quot;, was programmed and designed almost exclusively by Chris, while Mark and Tom handled marketing, materials and the other business elements. Their small initial investment enabled them to buy CD-Rs and printer cartridges. Early copies of the game were handmade. The company was able to fully make back their investment within a few hours of accepting orders. A large community formed, and the team, along with a new programmer Andy Bainbridge, started work on two new games.

&quot;Darwinia&quot; was released to much critical acclaim and was eventually re-released via Steam on 14 December 2005 On 29 September 2006, Introversion Software launched its third game, &quot;DEFCON&quot;. Shortly after, Introversion had measured their bandwidth in terabytes for the first time. After the release of &quot;DEFCON&quot;, Introversion began work on a game called &quot;Subversion&quot;. Their next game, however, was &quot;Multiwinia&quot;, a multiplayer follow-up to &quot;Darwinia&quot;, and was released on 19 September 2008.

&quot;Darwinia&quot; and &quot;Multiwinia&quot; were ported for the Xbox 360. This resulted in the eventual release of &quot;Darwinia+&quot;, which included both games, to the Xbox Live Arcade on 10 February 2010.

===&quot;Subversion&quot; delay and &quot;Prison Architect&quot;===
After the release of &quot;Multiwinia&quot; in 2008, Introversion announced the commencement of working on a game called &quot;Subversion&quot; in December of that year. This was followed by a series of blog-posts about the development of the game and its procedurally generated urban areas and the game was shown at the World of Love event in 2010. In October 2011, after three years in development, &quot;Subversion&quot; was announced as delayed.

Their new game was announced as &quot;Prison Architect&quot; during the Humble Indie Bundle release of Introversion games and tech demos of &quot;Subversion&quot; material, along with a treasure hunt of information on the new game hidden within the tech demos.

==Financial history and independence==
After a low-key launch, &quot;Uplink&quot; was a critical and commercial success for Introversion. A visit to E3 2002 saw the team &quot;rinse £10k in a week on speedboats and fast cars&quot;, but regret soon set in as they watched their income steadily decline, since &quot;in the games industry, you make 75% of your total revenue for the product in the first 6 months&quot;. By December 2002, then-publisher Strategy First had stopped paying royalties for &quot;Uplink&quot;; they would later file a Consumer Proposal, but were acquired by Silverstar Holdings in early 2005. Even with the cash flow from direct sales, Introversion ran out of money in the middle of 2003. The company hovered on the edge of bankruptcy, with the team selling most of their worldly goods, as their second project and only hope for funds—&quot;Darwinia&quot;—&quot;slipped relentlessly&quot;.

&quot;Darwinia&quot; was eventually released in March 2005, but despite a strong opening weekend, sales soon slipped too low to sustain the company. Within six months, the developers were back on UK government benefits until November, when they contacted Valve &quot;on a whim&quot; to try to set up a digital distribution deal on their Steam platform. Valve responded enthusiastically and, following a 14 December 2005 online launch, digital sales, which exposed the game to a new, global audience, kept the company going through to the release of their third game, &quot;DEFCON&quot;.

On 15 September 2006, the day &quot;DEFCON&quot; pre-orders were made available, Introversion spent their last £1500. Fortuitously, the game &quot;did much much better than [they] ever imagined&quot; and funds for at least the forthcoming twelve months quickly rolled in to replace it. Seemingly financially secure, the company place their eventual success largely at Valve&#x27;s feet: &quot;Steam has made Introversion a commercial success&quot;, Tom Arundel is quoted saying.

By early 2010 the company was back in financial trouble. After spending over a year porting &quot;Darwinia+&quot; to the Xbox 360, the game was not successful at launch. &quot;It just really bombed. We missed the entire audience, I think&quot;, director Mark Morris said. The launch was in fact so poor, the company was able to tell in the first 10 minutes that it would not make enough money to save the company. At this time the company was so deeply in debt that by continuing operation the Directors faced criminal prosecution under UK insolvency law. &quot;Tom (Arundel) spent a lot of time in those final days genuinely convinced that we were trading insolvently, probably trading insolvently, which is a criminal offense. So he was arguing that we needed to stop immediately, completely down tools, or there was a very real possibility that we would face prosecution&quot;.

Slowly Introversion&#x27;s finances changed again. In Q3 2010 the company was able to add Steam achievements to &quot;DEFCON&quot; which resulted in the game being prominently featured in a sale. Morris credits the $250,000 generated by the Steam promotion as saving the company. Later, Introversion&#x27;s games were featured in a Humble Indie Bundle that launched in November 2011. The &quot;Humble Introversion Bundle&quot; sold 190,261 bundles and generated $779,026.33. Introversion used the money for the ongoing development of their next game, entitled &quot;Prison Architect&quot;.

As of 26 September 2015, &quot;Prison Architect&quot; had grossed over $19 million in sales, and over 1.25 million units of the game had been sold. By the end of August 2016 when the final version &#x27;2.0&#x27; of &quot;Prison Architect&quot; was released, the number of individual players was given as two million.

Their next title, &quot;Scanner Sombre,&quot; was released in April 2017, after a 9 month development stage. The game sold only 6000 copies upon its release. Chris Delay remarked that it had &quot;bombed in a big way&quot;. Virtual reality compatibility has been implemented into the game post-release, supporting both the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, and was released in late June 2017, marking the developer&#x27;s first (and to date only) foray into VR.

In January 2019, Introversion and Paradox Interactive announced that the &quot;Prison Architect&quot; intellectual property was being sold on to Paradox for an undisclosed fee, so that Introversion could concentrate on new projects while Paradox continued to support and expand on the property.

On 28 May 2022 Introversion announced their new science fiction themed video game &quot;The Last Starship&quot;, which is scheduled to be released in 2023.

<doc id="807472" wikidata="Q295512" url="?curid=807472" title="Carlos Gamarra">
<text>Carlos Alberto Gamarra Pavón () (born 17 February 1971) is a Paraguayan former professional footballer who played as a centre back. He captained the Paraguay national team at international level and was for a long time the most capped player in Paraguayan football history, having made 110 international appearances and scoring 12 goals. Throughout his career, Gamarra was known for his leadership, physical strength, ability in the air, heading accuracy, and outstanding tackling skills, which made him one of the most respected defenders in South America.

Gamarra appeared for the Paraguay national team 110 times, scoring 12 goals, from 1993 to 2006, representing the team at 10 major tournaments and captained the squad during the latter part of his career. He is the second most capped player of the national team, his record being broken by Paulo da Silva in 2013. Gamarra appeared for Paraguay at three FIFA World Cup tournaments (1998, 2002 and 2006), five Copa América tournaments (1993, 1995, 1997, 1999 and 2004), and twice at the Summer Olympic Games (1992 and 2004, with Paraguay claiming Silver Medals in the latter). Gamarra was named as the Paraguayan Footballer of the Year in 1997 and 1998, and was also included in the 1998 FIFA World Cup Team of the Tournament.

==Club career==
Born in Ypacarai, Gamarra began his club career playing for Cerro Porteño in his home country in 1991, and went on to win the Paraguayan national championship with Cerro in 1992. He moved to Independiente for the 1992–93 football season in Argentina, but stayed only briefly before moving back to Cerro Porteño.

In 1995, Gamarra joined Internacional in Brazil, where his profile grew, eventually resulting in the naming of him as Paraguayan Footballer of the Year in 1997 by the Paraguayan newspaper &quot;Diario ABC Color&quot; (an achievement which Gamarra repeated in 1998). He moved to S.L. Benfica for the Portuguese 1997–1998 season, before returning to Brazil, this time with SC Corinthians, where he won Serie A Brazilian Championship in 1998.

After finishing the 1999 Brazilian football season with Corinthians, he moved to the Spanish league, after the Brazilian club agreed with Atlético Madrid for 9 million USD in June 1999. Atlético were surprisingly relegated in 2000, and Gamarra briefly moved back to Brazil, this time joining Flamengo. In the 2001–02 season Gamarra returned to Europe and played on loan for AEK Athens in Greece. There he played in 24 league games and won the Greek Cup.

On the back of his World Cup performance in 2002, he joined Internazionale in Italy&#x27;s Serie A for the 2002–03 season. In his first pre-season, he scored the winning goal in the Pirelli Cup final against Roma. Inter finished the season as runners-up in the league, with Gamarra making 14 appearances. His next season at the club was less successful, as Inter finished fourth in the league, and Gamarra made only 10 appearances. He remained at Inter for the 2004–2005 season, but after another season largely spent on the bench he joined the Brazilian side Palmeiras in July 2005. In 2007, Gamarra decided to return to Paraguay to end his football career and signed for Olimpia. Gamarra decided to retire after the 2007 season.

==International career==
Gamarra&#x27;s first international cap came against Bolivia on 27 March 1993, a 2–1 loss for Paraguay.

Gamarra made his first big impact in international football during Paraguay&#x27;s campaign at 1998 FIFA World Cup, in the second round of which Paraguay were knocked out by France (the eventual winners). Gamarra played in all four of Paraguay&#x27;s games, garnering great respect for his defensive skills, and did not concede a single foul in any of his side&#x27;s matches. FIFA named him as part of the All-Star team of the World Cup. At the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan, Paraguay were once again knocked out in the second round. Gamarra played every single minute of Paraguay&#x27;s campaign, and again completed his side&#x27;s participation without conceding a foul.

Gamarra captained the Paraguay side to a silver medal in the 2004 Summer Olympics, losing 1–0 to Argentina in the final. On 4 August, before the Summer Olympics began, he played in a preparation game against the Portugal of Cristiano Ronaldo in the city of Algarve, resulting in a 5–0 defeat.

In the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Gamarra was the first player in the tournament to score an own goal, from an incoming free kick from David Beckham in his team&#x27;s opening match against England, which eventually led to England&#x27;s 1–0 win. (Scored after just three minutes, this became the fastest World Cup finals own goal in history, until the 2014 FIFA World Cup where Sead Kolašinac scored just after two minutes playing for Bosnia and Herzegovina against Argentina in the group stages.) During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Gamarra announced his retirement from the Paraguay national team.

<text>Ahmet Cevdet Sunay (; 10 February 1899 – 22 May 1982) was a Turkish politician and army officer, who served as the fifth President of Turkey from 1966 to 1973.

== Early life and career ==
Sunay was born in 1899 in the village of Ataköy near Çaykara in Trabzon Vilayet, Ottoman Empire. After attending elementary school and middle school in Erzurum and Edirne, he graduated from Kuleli Military High School in Istanbul. During World War I, he fought in 1917 at the Palestine front and became a prisoner of war of the British in Egypt in 1918. After his release, he fought first on the southern front, then on the western front during the Turkish War of Independence.

Sunay completed his military education in 1927, and graduated from the staff college in 1930 as a staff officer. Rising through the ranks to become a general in 1949 and then a four-star general in 1959, he held important military posts. In 1960, he was appointed army chief and later joint chief of staff. On 14 March 1966, he was appointed to the senate by Cemal Gürsel under his presidential contingency.

When Gürsel&#x27;s presidency was terminated due to ill health in accordance with the constitution, Cevdet Sunay was elected 5th president by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey on 28 March 1966. He maintained his office despite increasing terrorist activity, student riots, and threatened coups. He served the constitutional term of seven years until 28 March 1973 and became then a permanent senator.

He was married to Atıfet in 1929. They had three sons, Atilla, Aysel and Argun Sunay.

== Presidency ==
Chief of the General Staff Cevdet Sunay was elected as the fifth president of the Turkish Republic by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey on 28 March 1966. His presidential service continued until 28 March 1973 where he had to go through troubled times. Between 1961 and 1965 Süleyman Demirel, Nihat Erim and Ferit Melen were the most prominent members in President Sunay’s administration. Cevdet Sunay resigned as president due to deteriorating health conditions.

== Death ==
Cevdet Sunay died of a heart attack on 22 May 1982 in Istanbul. His body was moved in August 1988 to a permanent burial place in the newly built Turkish State Cemetery in Ankara.

<doc id="807510" wikidata="Q4087476" url="?curid=807510" title="Battle of Philiphaugh">
<text>The Battle of Philiphaugh was fought on 13 September 1645 during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms near Selkirk in the Scottish Borders. The Royalist army of the Marquis of Montrose was destroyed by the Covenanter army of Sir David Leslie, restoring the power of the Committee of Estates.

==Prelude==
When the Covenanters became allies of the English Parliamentarians, Montrose was given a commission as King Charles&#x27;s Lieutenant General in Scotland. He was able to raise an army consisting of regiments of Irish soldiers sent to Scotland by the Irish Confederates and shifting numbers of Highland clansmen. With these troops, Montrose had won a remarkable series of victories in the year preceding the Battle of Philiphaugh. The last of these was at Kilsyth, which destroyed the last Covenanter army in Scotland and put the lowland towns at his mercy.

Montrose refused to allow his army to loot Glasgow, instead accepting a sum of £500 from the Town Council as pay for his soldiers. He then summoned a Parliament to be held in Glasgow. The Council complained at the cost which would be involved and asked to be excused the levy of £500. Montrose agreed, leaving his army without pay. Although Montrose intended to strike into England to aid the King&#x27;s cause there, the Highlanders under Alasdair MacColla who made up most of Montrose&#x27;s infantry refused to go any further south leaving their traditional foes, the Campbells, in their rear. At the same time, Montrose appointed the former prisoner, the Earl of Crawford as his Lieutenant General of Horse. Most of his horsemen were Gordons under Lord James Aboyne. Affronted by Crawford&#x27;s appointment, they too left the army.

Montrose hoped to gain recruits from the Borders, and marched south with only 500 musketeers from his Irish Catholic regiments and a small troop of horse. He made for Kelso, but found that only a few Borders gentry joined his army instead of the thousands of recruits he expected.

Meanwhile, the Earl of Leven, who commanded the main Scottish Covenanter Army in England, had heard of the result of the Battle of Kilsyth, and sent Sir David Leslie, the Lieutenant General of Horse, back into Scotland with all the cavalry he could muster. Leslie collected reinforcements from Covenanter garrisons in Newcastle upon Tyne and Berwick, and crossed the border on 6 September, with 5,000 horse and dragoons and 1,000 infantry. He marched along the east coast intending to cut off Montrose from the Highlands, but learned (possibly from the turncoat Earls of Home and Roxburgh) of Montrose&#x27;s position and strength, and turned south to intercept him.

==Battle==
Contemporary accounts give only a broad outline of the battle. Subsequent authors have interpreted this in various ways in an attempt to arrive at a more detailed account.

Montrose himself, many of his officers and some of the cavalry were quartered in the town of Selkirk, with the infantry and the rest of the cavalry encamped on flat ground the other side of the river (the Ettrick Water) at Philiphaugh. Warner puts this just below the junction of the Yarrow Water and the Ettrick Water and hence about away. However, a contemporary description of the Royalist infantry position has them behind &quot;on one hand an unpassable ditch, and on the other Dikes and Hedges, and where these were not strong enough, they further fortified them by casting up ditches, and lined their Hedges with Musketeers.&quot; Hence other interpretations would put the royalists within field enclosures shown on an 18th-century map between and from Selkirk.

Leslie had arrived at nearby Melrose the evening before, and advanced up the valley of the Tweed, driving in the Royalist outposts at Sunderland (at the junction of the Ettrick Water with the Tweed, about downstream of Selkirk) without apparently alarming or alerting the main Royalist force. The following morning was misty, and whatever scouting was undertaken by the Royalists failed to reveal the presence of Leslie&#x27;s forces. Leslie divided his force into two wings, one of which attacked the Royalist position directly, getting to within half a mile before the alarm was raised. The other executed a flanking manoeuvre, probably on the south bank of the Ettrick Water although some interpretations follow a later ballad and say through hilly ground to the north.

Montrose was alerted to Leslie&#x27;s attack by the sound of gunfire, but arrived on the battlefield to find his forces in considerable confusion. Although the Royalist infantry&#x27;s strong defensive position enabled them to repel at least two Covenanter attacks, the arrival of Leslie&#x27;s flanking force ensured their defeat. After Montrose made a brief attempt to restore the situation by charging 2,000 Covenanter dragoons with only 100 cavalry of his own, he was urged by his friends that the Royalist cause in Scotland would die without him. He cut his way out with 30 men, and retreated over the Minchmoor road toward Peebles.

Many of Montrose&#x27;s Irish foot soldiers from Manus O&#x27;Cahan&#x27;s regiment had been killed in the battle, but after fighting on for some time after the flight of the cavalry about 100 of them surrendered on promise of quarter. Some Presbyterian Ministers who accompanied Leslie persuaded him that this clemency was foolish, and the prisoners and 300 camp followers (many of them women and children) were slaughtered in cold blood.

In 2011 the battlefield was archaeologically investigated by a community metal detecting and excavation project led by Dr Natasha Ferguson of the Centre for Battlefield archaeology. Only 5% of the 880 artefacts found in the survey were archaeologically relevant however all finds were included in the appendix. Only 2 musket balls, 9 pistol balls, and 2 perhaps 3 pieces of canister shot were found. Approximately 25 copper 17th-century coins and one French coin from 1601-1642 were found, two buckles dated to the 17th-century, one silver button with dubious authenticity, and a possible 17th-18th century horseshoe were found.

==Aftermath==
Montrose attempted to raise another army in the Highlands, but was unable to take the field against Leslie&#x27;s army. After fighting a guerilla campaign over the following winter and spring, he received orders from King Charles (who was now himself a prisoner) to lay down his arms. Montrose, Crawford and Sir John Hurry, who had changed sides to join Montrose after the Battle of Auldearn, were refused pardon by the victorious Committee of Estates and went into exile.

The most likely site of the battlefield is now home to Selkirk Cricket Club and Selkirk Rugby Club, along with a small number of cottages. The site of the battle has been inventoried and protected by Historic Scotland under the Scottish Historical Environment Policy of 2009.

==In popular culture==
Events tied to the battle were chronicled in &quot;The Battle of Philiphaugh,&quot; one of the ballads collected by Francis James Child and published in &quot;The English and Scottish Popular Ballads&quot; (1882-1898) as Child Ballad 202. The author of the ballad is unknown.

The battle and the Royalist campaign of 1644-1645 in general feature in the 1937 novel And No Quarter by Irish writer Maurice Walsh, told from the perspective of two members of O&#x27;Cahan&#x27;s Regiment, which served during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms in the mid-1640s.

The battle is described by a survivor in John Buchan&#x27;s 1927 novel Witch Wood. Lord Montrose appears as a minor character.

<text>Nuosu or Nosu (, transcribed as ), also known as Northern Yi, Liangshan Yi, and Sichuan Yi, is the prestige language of the Yi people; it has been chosen by the Chinese government as the standard Yi language () and, as such, is the only one taught in schools, both in its oral and written forms. It was spoken by two million people and was increasing (as of PRC census); 60% were monolingual (1994 estimate). 
Nuosu is the native Nuosu name for their own language and is not used in Mandarin Chinese, though it may sometimes be translated as &quot;Nuòsūyǔ&quot; ().

The occasional terms &quot;Black Yi&quot; () and &#x27;White Yi&#x27; () are castes of the Nuosu people, not dialects.

Nuosu is one of several often mutually unintelligible varieties known as Yi, Lolo, Moso, or Noso; the six Yi languages recognized by the Chinese government hold only 25% to 50% of their vocabulary in common. They share a common traditional writing system, though this is used for shamanism rather than daily accounting.

According to the &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot;, it is one of the eight Tibeto-Burman languages with over 1,000,000 speakers (others being Burmese, Tibetan, Meitei, Bai, Karen, Hani, Jingpo).

==Distribution==
Liangshan Yi (Nuosu) is mostly spoken in southern Sichuan (mainly Liangshan). In places of Sichuan in which there are only Nuosu speakers, it is also simply referred to as Yi, and the other Sichuanese Yi language is Nasu.

Northern Yi (Nuosu) in northern Yunnan is spoken mainly in the northern part of Yunnan, including Kunming and Chuxiong. It is also called Black Yi or White Yi.

In Vietnam, Nuosu (usually known as Northern Lô Lô) is spoken in Ha Giang Province and Lao Cai Province, and speakers are classified as Lô Lô people. The number of Nuosu speakers in Vietnam is not known.

In Laos, Nuosu is spoken in Phongsaly Province in 3 villages near the Chinese border. Speakers are classified separately as Lolo.

In Myanmar, Nuosu is possibly spoken in Shan State or Kachin State, and it is usually known as Northeastern Yi or simply Yi, and speakers are classified as Lisu people which form the Kachin people.

In Thailand, Nuosu (usually referred to as Lolo), is spoken in Chiang Rai Province. Speakers are classified as Lolo subgroup of Lisu people. The Lolo of Thailand migrated from Myanmar.

==Dialects==
===Lama (2012)===
Lama (2012) gives the following classification for Nuosu dialects.
*Nuosu
**&quot;Qumusu (Tianba)&quot;
**Nuosu proper
***Nuosu
****&quot;Muhisu&quot;
****Nuosu (&quot;&quot;)
*****&quot;Yinuo&quot;
*****&quot;Shengzha&quot;
***Niesu (&quot;&quot;)
****&quot;Suondi&quot;
****&quot;Adu&quot;

The Qumusu (曲木苏, Tianba 田坝) dialect is the most divergent one. The other dialects group as Niesu (聂苏, and Adu) and as Nuosu proper (Muhisu 米西苏, Yinuo 义诺, and Shengzha 圣乍). Niesu has both lost voiceless nasals and developed diphthongs.

Adu (阿都话), characterized by its labial–velar consonants, is spoken in the Butuo and Ningnan counties of Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan province, and also in parts of Puge, Zhaojue, Dechang, and Jinyang counties.

Nyisu or Yellow Yi (黄彝) of Fumin County, Yunnan may either be a Soundi Yi (Nuosu) dialect or Nisu dialect.

Zhu and Zhang (2005) reports that the Shuitian people () reside mostly in the lowlands of the Anning River drainage basin, in Xichang, Xide, and Mianning counties of Liangshan Prefecture in Sichuan. They are called Muhisu (&quot;mu33 hi44 su33&quot;) by the neighboring Yi highland people. Shuitian is spoken in the following locations. Shuitian belongs to the Shengzha dialect () of Northern Yi.

*Mianning County: Jionglong 迥龙, Lugu 泸沽, Hebian 河边; Manshuiwan 漫水湾
*Xichang: Lizhou 礼州, Yuehua 月华
*Xide County: Mianshan 冕山镇 (including Shitoushan Village 石头山村), Lake 拉克

===Bradley (1997)===
According to Bradley (1997), there are three main dialects of Nosu, of which the Southeastern one (Sondi) is most divergent.
*Northern
**Tianba 田坝 Northwestern
**Yinuo 义诺 a.k.a. Northeastern
*Central (Shengzha 圣乍)
*Southeastern (Sondi)
**Sondi
**Adur

===Chen (2010)===
Chen (2010) lists the following dialects of Nosu. Also listed are the counties where each respective dialect is spoken.

*Nosu 诺苏方言
**Senza, Shèngzhà 圣乍次方言
***Senza, Shèngzhà 圣乍 (&quot;): 1,200,000 speakers primarily in Xide, Yuexi, Ganluo, Jinyang, Puge, Leibo, Xichang, Dechang, Mianning, Yanyuan, Yanbian, Muli, Shimian, Jiulong, and Luding; also in Huaping, Yongsheng, Ninglang, Lijiang, Jianchuan, Yongshan, and Qiaojia
***Yino, Yìnuò 义诺 (&quot;): 600,000 speakers primarily in Meigu, Mabian, Leibo, and Ebian, Ganluo; also in Yuexi, Zhaojue, and Jinyang
***Lidim, Tiánbà 田坝 (&quot;): 100,000 speakers primarily in Ganluo, Yuexi, and Ebian; also in Hanyuan
**Sodi, Suǒdì 所地次方言 (&quot;): 600,000 speakers primarily in Tuoxian, Huili, Huidong, Ningnan, Miyi, Dechang, and Puge

==Phonology==
===Consonants===
===Vowels===
Nuosu has five pairs of phonemic vowels, contrasting in a feature Andy Eatough calls &quot;loose throat&quot; vs. &quot;tight throat&quot;. Underlining is used as an ad-hoc symbol for tight throat; phonetically, these vowels are laryngealized and/or show a retracted tongue root. Loose vs. tight throat is the only distinction in the two pairs of syllabic consonants, but in the vocoids it is reinforced by a height difference.

The syllabic consonants are essentially the usual Sinological vowels , so can be identified with the vowel of the Mandarin &quot;four&quot;, but they have diverse realizations. completely assimilates to a preceding coronal except in voice, e.g. &quot;to marry&quot;, and is after a labial nasal, e.g. &quot;cloth&quot;. assimilates similarly after laterals, retaining its rounding, e.g. &quot;to stir-fry&quot;, and is after a labial nasal, e.g. &quot;mushroom&quot;; moreover it induces a labially trilled release of preceding labial or alveolar stops, e.g. &quot;to hit&quot;.

The tight-throat phone occurs as the realization of in the high tone. That it is phonemically loose-throat is shown by its behaviour in tightness harmony in compound words.

Nuosu syllable structure is (C)V.

=== Tones ===
* high / – written 
* high-mid / or mid falling / – written (written with diacritic ̑ over symbol in the syllabary)
* mid / – unmarked
* low falling / – written 

The high-mid tone is only marginally contrastive. Its two main sources are from tone sandhi rules, as the outcome of a mid tone before another mid tone, and the outcome of a low-falling tone after a mid tone. However, these changes do not occur in all compounds where they might: for instance &quot;bear&quot; + &quot;mother&quot; regularly forms &quot;female bear&quot;, but &quot;jackal&quot; + &quot;mother&quot; forms &quot;female jackal&quot; without sandhi. The syntax creates other contrasts: tone sandhi applies across the boundary between object and verb, so is present in SOV clauses like &quot;Mujy looks for Luti&quot;, but is absent in OSV clauses like &quot;Luti looks for Mujy&quot;. A few words, like &quot;what?&quot;, have underlying high-mid tone.

== Writing system ==
Classic Yi is a syllabic logographic system of 8,000–10,000 glyphs. Although similar to Chinese characters in function, the glyphs are independent in form, with little to suggest a direct relation.

In 1958 the Chinese government had introduced a Roman-based alphabet based on the romanized script of Gladstone Porteous of Sayingpan. This was later replaced by the Modern Yi script.

The Modern Yi script ( &#x27;Nosu script&#x27;) is a standardized syllabary derived from the classic script in 1974. It was made the official script of the Yi languages in 1980. There are 756 basic glyphs based on the Liangshan dialect, plus 63 for syllables only found in Chinese borrowings. The government requires the use of the script for signs in some designated public places.

==Vocabulary and grammar==
Nuosu is an analytic language, the basic word order is Subject–object–verb. Vocabularies of Nuosu can be divided into content words and function words. Among content words, nouns in Nuosu do not perform inflections for grammatical gender, number, and cases, classifiers are required when the noun is being counted; verbs do not perform conjugations for its persons and tenses; adjectives are usually placed after the word being fixed with a structural particle and do not perform inflections for comparison. Function words, especially grammatical particles, have a significant role in terms of sentence constructions in Nuosu. Nuosu does not have article words, but conjunctions and postposition words are used.

===Numbers===
Classifiers are required when numbers are used for fixing nouns.

<doc id="807537" wikidata="Q2512084" url="?curid=807537" title="Tujia language">
<text>The Tujia language (; ) is a Sino-Tibetan language spoken natively by the Tujia people in Hunan Province, China. It is unclassified within the Sino-Tibetan language family, due to pervasive influence from neighboring languages. There are two mutually unintelligible variants, Northern and Southern. Both variants are tonal languages with the tone contours of (55, 53, 35, 21). Northern Tujia has 21 initials, whereas Southern Tujia has 26 (with 5 additional voiced initials). As for the finals, Northern Tujia has 25 and Southern Tujia has 30, 12 of which are used exclusively in loanwords from Chinese. Its verbs make a distinction of active and passive voices. Its pronouns distinguish the singular and plural numbers along with the basic and possessive cases. As of 2005, the number of speakers was estimated at 70,000 for Northern Tujia (of which about 100 are monolingual) and 1,500 for Southern Tujia, out of an ethnic population of 8 million.

==Names==
Tujia autonyms include (; // in Ye 1995) and . The Tujia people call their language .

 () literally means &#x27;native people&#x27;, which is the appellation that the Han Chinese had given to them due to their aboriginal status in the area. The Tujia, on the other hand, call the Han Chinese (), a designation also given to the Hakka people, which means &#x27;guest people&#x27;. Tujia is also called &quot;Bizic&quot; by Yulou Zhou.

==Classification==
Tujia is clearly a Sino-Tibetan language, with a number of scholars consider the Tujia languages as belonging to a separate sub-branch of Tibeto-Burman languages, but its position within that family is unclear, due to massive borrowing from other Sino-Tibetan languages, in particular loanwords from Chinese. Although it has been placed with other groups in the past, such as under Nuosu language or belongs to the branch of Qiang language, linguists now generally leave it unclassified.

==Subdivisions==
Tujia can be divided into two different languages: Northern Tujia and Southern Tujia, which have 40% lexical similarity with each other. Almost all Tujia speakers are located in Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture. The Northern dialect has the vast majority of speakers, while the Southern dialect is spoken in only 3 villages of Tanxi Township () in Luxi County.

*Northern ( ): Baojing County, Longshan County, Guzhang County, Yongshun County
** ()
*Southern ( ): Tanxi Township in Luxi County

The Tujia-speaking areas of Longshan County are mostly located around the Xiche River 洗车河. The variety studied by Tian (1986) is that of Dianfang Township 靛房乡, Longshan County. Ye focuses on the Northern variety of Xinghuo Village 星火村, Miao&#x27;ertan Township 苗儿滩镇 (formerly Miaoshi 苗市), Longshan County 龙山县. Peng covers the Northern variety of Yongshun County. Brassett based their Tujia data primarily on the variety of Tasha Township 他砂乡, Longshan County and also partly from Pojiao Township 坡脚乡 and Dianfang Township 靛房乡. Dai focuses on the variety of Xianren Township 仙仁乡, Baojing County. Zhang (2006) covers the Northern Tujia dialect of Duogu village 多谷村, Longshan County and the Southern Tujia dialect of Poluozhai 婆落寨, Luxi County.

==Phonology==

=== Consonants ===
The following are the consonants in both the Northern and Southern Tujia dialects:
# Voiced plosives and affricates, and occur only in the Southern Tujia dialects.
# and are in free variation.
# is an allophone of .
# has allophones before and before .
=== Vowels ===

* Combinations with oral vowels and nasal vowel occur only in the Southern dialects.

==Orthography==

===1983 experiment===
One system of writing Tujia in Latin script is based on Hanyu Pinyin and uses letters as tone markers, namely, x, r, v, f. It was used in some schools in the area as an experiment, but withdrawn from them in the mid-1990s when the funding ceased.

===Brassett, Brassett, &amp; Lu (2006)===
Philip Brassett, Cecilia Brassett and Lu Meiyan have proposed an experimental Pinyin orthography for the Tujia language, as follows:



===Tujia numerals===

==Language preservation==
Although only a small percentage of Tujia people speak the Tujia language, Tujia language enthusiasts work hard on to preserve it, both in Hunan and Hubei. According to news reports, two Tujia language instruction books have been published and work continues on a Tujia dictionary. The Tujia language scholar Chu Yongming (储永明) works with children at the Baifusi Ethnic Minorities School (百福司民族小学) in Baifusi Town, Laifeng County, Hubei to promote the language use.

<text>Otto Fredrik Gideon Sundbäck (April 24, 1880 – June 21, 1954) was a Swedish-American electrical engineer, who is most commonly associated with his work in the development of the zipper.

== Background ==
Otto Fredrik Gideon Sundbäck was born on Sonarp farm in Ödestugu Parish, in Jönköping County, Småland, Sweden. He was the son of Jonas Otto Magnusson Sundbäck, a prosperous farmer, and his wife Kristina Karolina Klasdotter. After his studies in Sweden, Sundbäck moved to Germany, where he studied at the polytechnic school in Bingen am Rhein, graduating in engineering in 1903. In 1905, he emigrated to the United States.

==Personal==
On June 5, 1909, Sundbäck married (Naomi) Elvira Aronson, daughter of the Swedish-born plant manager Peter Aron Aronson (Aronsson), in Hoboken, New Jersey.

==Legacy==
In 2006, Sundbäck was honored by inclusion in the National Inventors Hall of Fame for his work on the development of the zipper. On April 24, 2012, the 132nd anniversary of Sundbäck’s birth, Google changed the Google logo on its homepage to a Google Doodle of the zipper, which when opened revealed the results of a search for &quot;Gideon Sundbäck&quot;.

<doc id="807570" wikidata="Q81619" url="?curid=807570" title="Cryogenic fuel">
<text>Cryogenic fuels are fuels that require storage at extremely low temperatures in order to maintain them in a liquid state. These fuels are used in machinery that operates in space (e.g. rockets and satellites) where ordinary fuel cannot be used, due to the very low temperatures often encountered in space, and the absence of an environment that supports combustion (on Earth, oxygen is abundant in the atmosphere, whereas human-explorable space is a vacuum where oxygen is virtually non-existent). Cryogenic fuels most often constitute liquefied gases such as liquid hydrogen.

Some rocket engines use regenerative cooling, the practice of circulating their cryogenic fuel around the nozzles before the fuel is pumped into the combustion chamber and ignited. This arrangement was first suggested by Eugen Sänger in the 1940s. All engines in the Saturn V rocket that sent the first crewed missions to the Moon used this design element, which is still in use today for liquid-fueled engines.

Quite often, liquid oxygen is mistakenly called cryogenic &quot;fuel&quot;, though it is actually an oxidizer and not fuel - like in &quot;any&quot; combustion engine, only the non-oxygen component of the combustion is considered &quot;fuel&quot;, although this distinction is arbitrary.

Russian aircraft manufacturer Tupolev developed a version of its popular Tu-154 design but with a cryogenic fuel system, designated the Tu-155. Using a fuel referred to as liquefied natural gas (LNG), its first flight was in 1989.

== Operation ==
Cryogenic fuels can be placed into two categories: inert and flammable or combustible. Both types exploit the large liquid-to-gas volume ratio that occurs when liquid transitions to gas phase. The feasibility of cryogenic fuels is associated with what is known as a high mass flow rate. With regulation, the high-density energy of cryogenic fuels is utilized to produce thrust in rockets and controllable consumption of fuel. The following sections provide further detail.

===Inert===
These types of fuels typically use the regulation of gas production and flow to power pistons in an engine. The large increases in pressure are controlled and directed toward the engine&#x27;s pistons. The pistons move due to the mechanical power transformed from the monitored production of gaseous fuel. A notable example can be seen in Peter Dearman&#x27;s liquid air vehicle. Some common inert fuels include:
* Liquid nitrogen
* Liquid air
* Liquid helium
* Liquid neon

===Combustible===
These fuels utilize the beneficial liquid cryogenic properties along with the flammable nature of the substance as a source of power. These types of fuel are well known primarily for their use in rockets. Some common combustible fuels include:
* Liquid hydrogen
* Liquid natural gas (LNG)
* Liquid methane

==Engine combustion==
Combustible cryogenic fuels offer much more utility than most inert fuels can. Liquefied natural gas, as with any fuel, will only combust when properly mixed with the right amounts of air. As for LNG, the bulk majority of efficiency depends on the methane number, which is the gas equivalent of the octane number. This is determined based on the methane content of the liquefied fuel and any other dissolved gas, and varies as a result of experimental efficiencies. Maximizing efficiency in combustion engines will be a result of determining the proper fuel to air ratio and utilizing the addition other hydrocarbons for added optimal combustion.

==Production efficiency==
Gas liquefying processes have been improving over the past decades with the advent of better machinery and control of system heat losses. Typical techniques take advantage of the temperature of the gas dramatically cooling as the controlled pressure of a gas is released. Enough pressurization and then subsequent depressurization can liquefy most gases, as exemplified by the Joule-Thomson effect.

===Liquefied natural gas===
While it is cost-effective to liquefy natural gas for storage, transport, and use, roughly 10 to 15 percent of the gas gets consumed during the process. The optimal process contains four stages of propane refrigeration and two stages of ethylene refrigeration. There can be the addition of an additional refrigerant stage, but the additional costs of equipment are not economically justifiable. Efficiency can be tied to the pure component cascade processes which minimize the overall source to sink temperature difference associated with refrigerant condensing. The optimized process incorporates optimized heat recovery along with the use of pure refrigerants. All process designers of liquefaction plants using proven technologies face the same challenge: to efficiently cool and condense a mixture with a pure refrigerant. In the optimized Cascade process, the mixture to be cooled and condensed is the feed gas. In the propane mixed refrigerant processes, the two mixtures requiring cooling and condensing are the feed gas and the mixed refrigerant. The chief source of inefficiency lies in the heat exchange train during the liquefaction process.

==Advantages and disadvantages==

===Benefits===
* Cryogenic fuels are environmentally cleaner than gasoline or fossil fuels. Among other things, the greenhouse gas rate could potentially be reduced by 11–20% using LNG as opposed to gasoline when transporting goods.
* Along with their eco-friendly nature, they have the potential to significantly decrease transportation costs of inland products because of their abundance compared to that of fossil fuels.
* Cryogenic fuels have a higher mass flow rate than fossil fuels and therefore produce more thrust and power when combusted for use in an engine. This means that engines will run farther on less fuel overall than modern gas engines.
* Cryogenic fuels are non-pollutants and therefore, if spilled, are no risk to the environment. There will be no need to clean up hazardous waste after a spill.

===Potential drawbacks===
* Some cryogenic fuels, like LNG, are naturally combustible. Ignition of fuel spills could result in a large explosion. This is possible in the case of a car crash with an LNG engine.
* Cryogenic storage tanks must be able to withstand high pressure. High-pressure propellant tanks require thicker walls and stronger alloys which make the vehicle tanks heavier, thereby reducing performance.
* Despite non-toxic tendencies, cryogenic fuels are denser than air. As such, they can lead to asphyxiation. If leaked, the liquid will boil into a very dense, cold gas and if inhaled, could be fatal.

<doc id="807595" wikidata="Q761682" url="?curid=807595" title="Sports Illustrated Stadium">
<text>Sports Illustrated Stadium is a soccer-specific stadium in Harrison, New Jersey, that is home to the New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer and NJ/NY Gotham FC of the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League. It opened under its former name, Red Bull Arena, in 2010. Featuring a transparent partial roof, it is located on the waterfront in the Riverbend District of Harrison across the Passaic River from Newark and approximately 7 miles (12 km) west of Lower Manhattan, New York City. With a seating capacity of 25,000, it is the sixth-largest soccer-specific stadium in the United States and in Major League Soccer.

On December 11, 2024, the venue&#x27;s name was changed to Sports Illustrated Stadium as part of a new, 13-year agreement between the Red Bulls and Sports Illustrated Tickets.

==Initial planning==
The original plan to build a soccer specific stadium in the New York Metropolitan area was announced during the 2000 MLS season at ESPN Zone in Times Square by the President &amp; GM of the MetroStars Nick Sakiewicz and owner Stuart Subotnick. Nick Sakiewicz led the complex, nearly 5-year effort in search of a site to build. On July 1, 2004, Sakiewicz, New Jersey Governor Richard Codey, Harrison Mayor Ray McDonough and Harrison Redevelopment Chair Peter Higgins along with MLS Commissioner Don Garber announced the MetroStars (as the New York Red Bulls were known at the time) would move from their home at Giants Stadium to a site in Harrison, New Jersey. Harrison was chosen for its mass transit and interstate connections, proximity to New York City and its long history and reputation as a soccer cultural hotbed. The West Hudson County area has been home to historic teams such as Clark O.N.T., West Hudson A.A. and the Kearny Scots dating back to the late 19th and early 20th century. On November 28, 1885, the neighboring town of Kearny hosted the first international soccer match held outside of the United Kingdom between the United States and Canada at Clark Field in the neighborhood that is now East Newark. Harrison Park was located a few blocks northwest of the stadium site and was the home field of West Hudson A.A. It also hosted the U.S. Open Cup final in 1918 and 1923.

Negotiations between MLS and the state of New Jersey dragged on until an agreement was announced on August 5, 2005, for the MetroStars to build and complete construction of a new dedicated soccer facility for the 2007 season. Concerns about environmental clean-up at the selected site forced another delay. Groundbreaking took place September 19, 2006, and construction was set for November 2007, that was delayed by one month when Red Bull GmbH bought the MetroStars from Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG), changing the club&#x27;s name in the process. After projections of opening during the 2008, and then the 2009 season, on January 23, 2009, it was announced that the arena opening would be delayed until 2010.

Nick Sakiewicz moved on to create MLS&#x27; 16th franchise in Philadelphia and build a soccer specific stadium in that market which launched in 2010. According to Erik Stover, Red Bulls managing director at the time, Harrison Redevelopment Agency chairman Peter B. Higgins was &quot;quite simply the reason that the New York Red Bulls have a new home in Harrison. His vision and leadership guided us through numerous difficulties.&quot; The Higgins&#x27; contribution is memorialized by the naming of the street at the main gates along the west side of the stadium as Pete Higgins Boulevard.

==Red Bull buyout and new design==

In addition to purchasing the team, Red Bull bought out AEG&#x27;s $100 million share of the stadium, an after-effect of lasting disagreements between the two corporations regarding their plans for the facility. Their differences prompted a significant delay in the early stages of the stadium&#x27;s construction. After the naming rights of the soccer team were acquired, leading to the name &quot;Red Bull Park&quot;, Red Bull instituted a number of changes to the stadium&#x27;s original design, which sparked tension between the Austrian-based energy drink company and AEG. Red Bull opted out of AEG&#x27;s plan to construct a stage in the stadium for performances, one that would have increased profit margins for the group.

The updated design was completed by Rossetti architects from Detroit and was built by New Jersey–based Hunter Roberts Construction Group, LLC. The stadium&#x27;s unique roofing system was engineered, fabricated, and installed by the projects specialty roofing contractor Birdair of Amherst, New York, a suburb of Buffalo.

==Features==
A tension-fabric curved exterior shell of PTFE fiberglass wraps around the entire two-tiered stadium, creating the distinguishing roof feature of Sports Illustrated Stadium. The roof extends from the last row of seats to just past the field&#x27;s touchlines, with of the roof being translucent to allow for natural light. And at , it is the largest roof canopy of all Major League Soccer stadiums, covering all 25,000 seats. The low and enclosed roof design is known for providing superior acoustics by holding, amplifying and reflecting crowd noise back onto the field. Dual light-emitting diode (LED) HD Panasonic video boards were suspended from the north and south ends of the roof. In early 2019, both video boards were replaced with two new LED Daktronics displays as part of stadium wide upgrades.

The seats of Sports Illustrated Stadium are of the tip-up variety, without arm rests (except for a few sections near the player benches which feature small arm rests and cup holders), similar to those of European soccer stadiums with the first row of seating approximately from the touchlines. The stadium&#x27;s seating is raked at 33 degrees for optimal sight-lines. Included in the 25,000 seats are 30 luxury suites and 1,000 premium seats. The Red Bull logo is patterned in red and yellow lower-level seats directly opposite the team benches and field entrance tunnel.

Sections 133, 101 and 102 collectively make up the 1,500 seat home supporters section known as the &quot;South Ward&quot;. Among the former blue seats in the South Ward was the &quot;Red Seat&quot; located at Section 101, Row 11, Seat 20. The Red Seat signifies the Red Bulls first goal scored at Sports Illustrated Stadium; Section 101 represents the Arena&#x27;s first game, Row 11 marks the minute of the game in which the goal was scored and Seat 20 remembers the goal scorer, No. 20 Joel Lindpere. Following the passing of Empire Supporters Club member Mike Vallo, the Red Seat&#x27;s No. 20 was replaced by the initials &quot;MV&quot; to honor him. Ahead of the 2020 season, the Red Bulls converted the South Ward into a safe standing section with a rail seating system, similar to the system in place at BMO Stadium in Los Angeles. This system allows supporters to watch matches while standing but also contain unlock-able individual red fold-down seats to convert the section to standard seating for international matches and other events. The rails also contain cup holders. The Red Seat was removed and given to the Vallo Family and a new location in Section 101 was selected to commemorate Mike Vallo. An open standing area was created directly behind the South Ward for supporters to gather while maintaining a view of the field. Sports Illustrated Stadium is the third soccer-specific stadium in North America to have a safe standing with rail seating system.

On the west side of Sports Illustrated Stadium is the &quot;Red Ring of Honor&quot;. Established in 2015, the club&#x27;s 20th season in Major League Soccer, the ring honors the 20 best players in the first 20 seasons of the club as voted by fans. Above the Red Ring of Honor is the retired jersey number &quot;99&quot; of striker Bradley Wright-Phillips; the first to be retired by the Red Bulls. Also above the Red Ring of Honor are listed the years honoring the Red Bull teams that won the Supporters&#x27; Shield in 2013, 2015, and 2018. In 2022, &quot;Legends Row&quot; was created above the Red Ring of Honor and the name of former goalkeeper Luis Robles was added. In 2024, a permanent banner honoring Gotham FC&#x27;s 2023 NWSL Championship was added to Legends Row.

The lower bowl of the Arena is constructed of concrete, while the upper bowl is constructed of galvanized-metal. The Red Bulls intentionally chose galvanized-metal for the upper bowl so fans could create more noise by stomping their feet. In addition, the main concourse is elevated high, eliminating a majority of field-level entryways. On the North side of the main concourse are 13 &quot;Red Beams&quot;; each one memorializing a special moment in the club&#x27;s history. In 2022, a mural was added to the main concourse at the &quot;Horizon Gate&quot;. The mural was painted by artist Elijah Minton and is designed to &quot;represent the Red Bulls loyal supporters, fans, culture, energy and passion for the game of soccer from our neighborhoods to the walls of (Red Bull Arena).&quot;

In 2017, the Red Bulls opened MLS&#x27;s first permanent sensory room for individuals and families affected by autism. The space was formerly used as executive offices by the club&#x27;s general manager Marc de Grandpre, whose daughter is on the autism spectrum. The sensory room overlooks mid-field and features dimmed lighting and lightly colored walls to offer a soothing environment, along with visual aids, fidget toys and other activities. There is no special ticket or any charge required for use of the room.

Ahead of the 2022 MLS season, the Red Bulls fully renovated the Premium Levels of Sports Illustrated Stadium including the Audi Club, Bulls Corner, Provident Bank Suite Lounge and its 27 indoor suites and created a new area called the Midfield Suite. The Midfield Suite acts as a common area for all suite ticket holders and provides panoramic views of the field. A new satellite premium &quot;BULLShop&quot; was created on the fourth floor and a new gaming lounge was created on the 5th floor that gives suite guests access to gaming stations and lounge seating.

On June 6, 2023, the Red Bulls opened a new outdoor pre-match event space known as &quot;CrossBar&quot;. The space includes a permanent stage and viewing area, a weather-proof option for pre-match events, along with new and upgraded furniture, gaming areas and bar and concession area.

Ahead of the 2024 MLS season, the Red Bulls upgraded Sports Illustrated Stadium&#x27;s lighting system by installing a Musco Lighting TLC for LED system. The new system has color-changing fixtures that allow for higher on-field lighting levels, dynamic lighting for in-game moments and celebrations and reduce energy consumption by 20%. A new LED ribbon board was also installed around the upper bowl of the Arena.

==Construction==

Construction commenced on Red Bull Park on January 3, 2008, on the site of a former Remco factory service building, including the first of 3,000 timber piles driven into the ground to support the new stadium. On January 11, 2008, Erik Stover was announced as the new general manager of Red Bull Arena during construction and then on after. He had served as GM of Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego since 2005. On February 20, 2008, a CAN$28–$30 million contract was announced with Structal-Heavy Steel Construction to assist in the fabrication and construction of steel components. Fabrication began offsite in the second quarter of 2008, and erection in Fall, 2008. Total project size is estimated at 9,000 tons of structural steel.

The first steel girder was put in place on August 19, 2008. The arena was reported by &quot;The New York Times&quot; to be 55% complete on March 27, 2009. The last major beam for the roof was topped out on April 14, 2009. Enclosure panels started going up on May 7, 2009. The first section of the Red Bull Arena roof was completed in August 2009. The underground drainage and turf-heating system installation began on August 18, 2009.

==Tax controversy==

In 2010, the Red Bulls refused to pay a $1.4 million property tax levy to the town of Harrison, claiming that the stadium was exempt from paying taxes. The team also refused to pay a $1.3 million for 2011. While the team did eventually pay the back taxes, it subsequently filed a lawsuit to have the payments reimbursed by the town, claiming the stadium was exempt from local taxes.

On June 30, 2012, the Tax Court of New Jersey ruled that Harrison did have the right to tax both Red Bull Arena and the land underneath it and denied the team&#x27;s claim for reimbursement. This decision was upheld by an appellate court in May 2014. The Red Bulls appealed to the state Supreme Court, who in October 2014 agreed to hear the case. The Supreme Court referred the parties to mediation.

A settlement was proposed in which the Hudson County Improvement Authority would take over ownership of the land and stadium and enter into a lease agreement with the team, using the lease payments to give Harrison an annual PILOT (Payment In Lieu of Taxes) tied to the Consumer Price Index. The settlement was approved by the Harrison Town Council and mayor on March 16, 2016.

On July 14, 2016, the Red Bulls and town agreed to a revised settlement, in which the stadium and land will be turned over to the Hudson County Improvement Authority. The Red Bulls will pay an annual rent of $1.3 million, escalated annually based on the Consumer Price Index, of which $1.115 million will go to the town of Harrison. The lease agreement will be in place through 2038, with team options through 2058. At the end of the lease term, ownership of the stadium will revert to the town. This agreement must be finalized by the end of 2016.

==Naming rights==

The acquisition of the MetroStars by Red Bull GmbH in 2006 included the naming rights to the future stadium. Red Bull began exploring an outside naming rights sponsor for the stadium as early as 2015. On December 11, 2024, the Red Bulls announced a 13-year agreement with Sports Illustrated Tickets, a ticket platform owned by Authentic Brands Group that licenses the branding of sports magazine &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;; the sponsorship does not involve the newsroom operations of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. The agreement will include the use of Sports Illustrated Tickets as the official ticketing partner of events at the stadium beginning in 2026 after it replaces Ticketmaster.

Red Bull Arena scored highest for overall satisfaction, security and ushers, seating area and game experience, ticket purchase, food and beverage, and leaving the game.

Also in August 2016, Red Bull Arena and the Red Bull Training Facility were awarded the Sports Turf Managers Association&#x27;s (STMA) Certification for Environmentally Responsible Management. The training facility is the first facility to earn the 80% or higher ratings on the 10-part written assessment.

In August 2017, Red Bull Arena and the Red Bulls were awarded their second consecutive J.D. Power – &quot;Best in Fan Experience&quot; award for the New York metropolitan area. The stadium scored highest for ticket purchase, security and ushers, seating area and game experience, food and beverage and game arrival.

In November 2018, Red Bull Arena and Director of Grounds, Dan Shemesh, were honored with the &quot;Field of the Year&quot; award by the Sports Turf Managers Association (STMA) for the professional soccer division.

In April 2021, Red Bull Arena received Global Biorisk Advisory Council (GBAC) STAR accreditation ahead of the 2021 home opener. GBAC STAR is recognized as the gold standard of safe venues and provides third-party validation to ensure the implementation of rigorous protocols in response to biorisk situations such as COVID-19. Upgrades made to receive the accreditation include an ionized air filtration system, making all restrooms contactless, quarterly antimicrobial treatments, and implementing contact free food order and payment systems.

In November 2021, Red Bull Arena was named &quot;2021 Professional Soccer Field of the Year&quot; by the Sports Turf Managers Association (STMA). It is the second time Red Bull Arena was awarded this honor.

==Accessibility and transportation==
The stadium can be reached via the Harrison station by the Newark-World Trade Center train of the PATH rapid transit system. A $256 million reconstruction and expansion, to accommodate the burgeoning economic growth and development in the area and the increasing number of fans taking the PATH on game days, was completed on June 15, 2019. The stadium is accessible from Newark Penn Station by transferring to the PATH rapid transit system. The stadium is also served by the 40 New Jersey Transit Bus route.

The nearby Jackson Street Bridge crosses the Passaic River to the Ironbound neighborhood in Newark and is a popular pedestrian route to and from the stadium. In 2022, a soccer and Red Bulls themed mural was installed at the corner of Market Street and the Jackson Street Bridge. The mural, titled &quot;Unity Goal&quot;, was painted by Newark artist Diegumberrto who said &quot;Soccer is a sport that unifies people of all ethnic backgrounds, cultures, and languages. The mural embodies the love of the game and adds a level of excitement as people gather to walk across the bridge to (Red Bull Arena).&quot;

Sports Illustrated Stadium is accessible by car via I-280, with connections to the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95), Garden State Parkway, McCarter Highway (NJ-21), and other highways and roads. There are several designated lots and the Harrison Parking Center garage available for parking in the immediate vicinity.

<doc id="807609" wikidata="Q57666" url="?curid=807609" title="Marie of Romania">
<text>Marie (born Princess Marie Alexandra Victoria of Edinburgh; 29 October 1875 – 18 July 1938) was the last queen of Romania from 10 October 1914 to 20 July 1927 as the wife of King Ferdinand I.

Marie was born into the British royal family. Her parents were Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh (later Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha), and Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia. Marie&#x27;s early years were spent in Kent, Malta and Coburg. After refusing a proposal from her cousin, the future King George V, she was chosen as the future wife of Ferdinand, then crown prince of Romania, in 1892. Marie was crown princess between 1893 and 1914, and became immediately popular with the Romanian people.

After the outbreak of World War I, Marie urged Ferdinand to ally himself with the Triple Entente and declare war on Germany, which he eventually did in 1916. During the early stages of fighting, the national capital Bucharest was occupied by the Central Powers. Marie, Ferdinand and their five children took refuge in Western Moldavia. There, she and her three daughters acted as nurses in military hospitals, caring for soldiers who were wounded or afflicted by cholera. After the war, on 1 December 1918, the historical region of Transylvania, following Bessarabia and Bukovina, united with the Old Kingdom. Marie, now queen of Greater Romania, attended the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, where she campaigned for international recognition of the enlarged Romania. In 1922, she and Ferdinand were crowned in a specially-built cathedral in the ancient city of Alba Iulia, in an elaborate ceremony which mirrored their status as queen and king of a united state.

As queen, Marie was very popular, both in Romania and abroad. In 1926, she undertook a diplomatic tour of the United States, alongside her children Nicholas and Ileana. They were received enthusiastically by the people and visited several cities before returning to Romania. There, Marie found that Ferdinand was gravely ill and he died a few months later. Now queen dowager, Marie refused to be part of the regency council which reigned over the country under the minority of her grandson, King Michael. In 1930, Marie&#x27;s eldest son Carol, who had waived his rights to succession, deposed his son and usurped the throne, becoming King Carol II. He removed Marie from the political scene and strove to crush her popularity. As a result, Marie moved away from Bucharest and spent the rest of her life either in the countryside or at Balchik Palace, her summer residence in Southern Dobruja by the Black Sea. In 1937, she became ill with cirrhosis and died the following year.

Following Romania&#x27;s transition to a People&#x27;s Republic, the monarchy was excoriated by communist officials. Several biographies of the royal family described Marie either as a drunkard or as a promiscuous woman, referring to her many alleged affairs and to orgies she had supposedly organised before and during the war. In the years preceding the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Marie&#x27;s popularity recovered and she was offered as a model of patriotism to the population. Marie is primarily remembered for her work as a nurse, but is also known for her extensive writing, including her critically acclaimed autobiography.

== Early life (1875–1893) ==
=== Birth ===

Marie was the eldest daughter and second child of Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, and the former Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia, respectively the son of Queen Victoria and the daughter of Emperor Alexander II. She was born at her parents&#x27; residence, Eastwell Manor in Kent, England, on 29 October 1875, at 10:30 a.m., in the presence of her father. Her birth was celebrated by firing the Park and Tower guns. She was named Marie Alexandra Victoria, after her mother and grandmothers, but she was informally known as &quot;Missy&quot;. The Duke of Edinburgh wrote that his daughter &quot;promises to be as fine a child as her brother and gives every evidence of finely developed lungs and did so before she was fairly in the world.&quot; As a grandchild of the reigning British monarch in the male line, Marie was formally styled &quot;Her Royal Highness Princess Marie of Edinburgh&quot; from birth.

Marie&#x27;s baptism took place in the private chapel of Windsor Castle on 15 December 1875 and was officiated by Arthur Stanley and Gerald Wellesley, Dean of Windsor. The baptism, &quot;of a strictly private nature&quot;, took place one day after the ceremony marking the anniversary of the death of her paternal grandfather, Prince Albert. Marie&#x27;s godparents were Empress Maria Alexandrovna (her maternal grandmother, for whom Queen Victoria stood proxy), the Princess of Wales (her paternal aunt), the Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (her great-aunt, for whom Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein stood proxy), the Tsarevich of Russia (her maternal uncle, for whom Count Pyotr Andreyevich Shuvalov stood proxy) and the Duke of Connaught and Strathearn (her paternal uncle, for whom the Duke of Albany stood proxy).

=== Upbringing ===
Marie and her siblings, Prince Alfred (b. 1874, known as &quot;Young Affie&quot;), and Princesses Victoria Melita (b. 1876, known as &quot;Ducky&quot;), Alexandra (b. 1878, known as &quot;Sandra&quot;) and Beatrice (b. 1884, known as &quot;Baby Bee&quot;), spent much of their early life at Eastwell Park, which their mother preferred instead of Clarence House, their official residence. In her memoirs, Marie remembered Eastwell fondly. The Duke of Edinburgh was largely absent from his children&#x27;s lives due to his position in the British Royal Navy, and their life was governed by their mother. Marie later stated that she did not even know the colour of her father&#x27;s hair until she looked at later portraits of him, believing it to be much darker than it actually was. When he was at home, the Duke would often play with his children, inventing many games for them. Of all her siblings, Marie was closest to her sister Victoria Melita, who was one year younger, but whom everyone believed to be the older girl because of her stature, much to the princesses&#x27; dismay. The Edinburgh children were all baptised and raised in the Anglican faith; this upset their Russian Orthodox mother.

The Duchess of Edinburgh was a supporter of the idea of separating generations, and Marie deeply regretted the fact that her mother never allowed chatting between the two &quot;as if [they] were equals&quot;. Nonetheless, the Duchess was independent-minded, cultured, and &quot;the most important person&quot; in her children&#x27;s lives. At the behest of their mother, Marie and her sisters were taught French, which they detested and rarely spoke. Overall, the Duchess neglected her daughters&#x27; education, considering them not very bright or gifted. They were permitted to read aloud, but in the fields of painting and drawing, areas in which they had inherited Queen Victoria&#x27;s talent, the girls received only a &quot;pedestrian instruction&quot;. The Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh frequently received members of the royal family at Eastwell Park, inviting them for breakfast nearly daily, and in 1885 Marie and Victoria Melita served as bridesmaids at the wedding of their aunt Beatrice and Prince Henry of Battenberg. Among Marie&#x27;s playmates were her maternal cousins Grand Dukes Nicholas (called &quot;Nicky&quot;), George (called &quot;Georgie&quot;), and Grand Duchess Xenia of Russia; their siblings, Michael (called &quot;Misha&quot;) and Olga, were too young for the Edinburgh girls. Other playmates included the children of Marie&#x27;s maternal uncle Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia.

In 1886, when Marie was eleven years old, the Duke of Edinburgh was named commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean Fleet and the family took up residence at San Antonio Palace in Malta. Marie later remembered her time in Malta as &quot;the happiest memory of my existence&quot;. It was in Malta that Marie found her first love, Maurice Bourke, the captain of the Duke&#x27;s ship, whom Marie called &quot;Captain Dear&quot;. Marie was prone to fits of jealousy when Bourke would pay more attention to one of her sisters than to her. The Duke and Duchess were greatly loved in Malta, and San Antonio Palace was frequently full of guests. Marie and Victoria Melita received white horses from their mother and went to the local hippodrome nearly daily, apart from Saturday. During their first year in Malta, a French governess oversaw the princesses&#x27; education, but due to her failing health, she was replaced the following year by a much younger German woman. At San Antonio, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh always maintained a room ready for Prince George of Wales, the second son of the Prince of Wales, who was in the Royal Navy. George called the three elder Edinburgh girls &quot;the three dearests&quot;, but favoured Marie the most.

Meanwhile, the Duke of Edinburgh became heir presumptive to his childless paternal uncle, Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, upon the Prince of Wales&#x27;s renunciation of his rights to the duchy. Consequently, the family relocated to Coburg in 1889. Marie later came to view this moment as &quot;truly the end of a life that had been absolute happiness and joy without clouds, of a life with no disappointments or delusions and without any discordant note.&quot; The Duchess, who was pro-German, hired a German governess for her daughters, bought them plain clothing and even had them confirmed in the Lutheran faith. The family spent their summers at Rosenau Castle. Duke Ernest was described by Marie as &quot;having his oddities&quot;; his court was less strict than other German courts of the time. In Coburg, the princesses&#x27; education was broadened: more emphasis was placed on painting and music, which were taught by Anna Messing and Mrs. Helferich respectively. On Thursdays and Sundays, Marie and her sisters went to the Coburg Theatre, an experience which they enjoyed greatly. Marie and Victoria Melita often observed their brother&#x27;s friends and made comments on whom they liked better, an aspect which Marie believed was inevitable in the lives of girls who have brothers. Another activity which the girls enjoyed at Coburg was attending winter parties organised by their mother, during which they would ice-skate and play different games, such as ice hockey.

=== Marriage ===
Marie grew into a &quot;lovely young woman&quot; with &quot;sparkling blue eyes and silky fair hair&quot;; she was courted by several royal bachelors, including Prince George of Wales, who in 1892 became second in line to inherit the throne. Queen Victoria, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Edinburgh all approved, but the Princess of Wales and the Duchess of Edinburgh did not. The Princess of Wales disliked the family&#x27;s pro-German sentiment and the Duchess of Edinburgh did not wish her daughter to remain in England, which she disliked. She also disliked the fact that the Princess of Wales, whose father had been a minor German prince before being called to the Danish throne, was higher than her in the order of precedence. The Duchess of Edinburgh was also against the idea of a marriage between first cousins, which was not allowed by her native Russian Orthodox Church. Thus, when George proposed to her, Marie informed him that the marriage was impossible and that he must remain her &quot;beloved chum&quot;. Queen Victoria would later comment that &quot;Georgie lost Missy by waiting &amp; waiting&quot;.

Around this time, King Carol I of Romania was looking for a suitable bride for his nephew, Crown Prince Ferdinand, in order to secure the succession and ensure the continuation of the House of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. Possibly motivated by the prospect of removing tensions between Russia and Romania on the subject of control over Bessarabia, the Duchess of Edinburgh suggested that Marie meet Ferdinand. Marie and Ferdinand first became acquainted during a dinner, and the pair conversed in German. She found him shy but amiable, and their second meeting went just as well. Once the pair were formally engaged, Queen Victoria wrote to another granddaughter, Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine, that &quot;[Ferdinand] is nice &amp; the Parents are charming–but the country is very insecure &amp; the immorality of the Society at Bucharest quite awful. Of course the marriage will be delayed some time as Missy won&#x27;t be 17 till the end of October!&quot; German Empress Frederick, Marie&#x27;s aunt, wrote to her daughter, Crown Princess Sophia of Greece, that &quot;Missy is till now quite delighted, but the poor child is so young, how can she guess what is before her?&quot; In late 1892, King Carol visited London in order to meet the Duke of Edinburgh and Queen Victoria, who eventually agreed to the marriage and appointed him a Knight of the Garter.

On 10 January 1893, Marie and Ferdinand were married at Sigmaringen Castle in three ceremonies: one civil, one Catholic (Ferdinand&#x27;s religion) and one Anglican. The civil ceremony was performed in the Red Hall of the castle by Karl von Wendel, the German Emperor being the first of the witnesses present to sign the marriage act. At four o&#x27;clock, the Catholic ceremony took place at the Town Church, with Marie being led to the altar by her father. The Anglican ceremony was more modest and was conducted in one of the chambers of the castle. Although King Carol granted the couple &quot;Honigtag&quot; (one day of honeymoon), Marie and Ferdinand spent a few days at the Castle of Krauchenwies in Bavaria. From there, they left for the countryside, their journey being interrupted briefly by a stop at Vienna, where they visited Emperor Franz Joseph. Due to growing tensions between Austria and Romania (the visit took place during the ongoing movement of the Transylvanian Memorandum), the couple&#x27;s visit was brief, and they arrived in the border town of Predeal following a nighttime crossing of Transylvania by train. Marie was warmly welcomed by the Romanian people, who were longing for a more personal monarchy.

=== Domestic life ===
The first years of Marie and Ferdinand&#x27;s marriage were not particularly easy, and Marie would later tell her husband that &quot;it is such a shame that we had to waste so many years of our youth just to learn how to live together!&quot; Gradually, the couple&#x27;s relationship became based on a cordial friendship: Marie accorded Ferdinand respect she believed he was due as a man and, later, as king, and he respected her because he realised that she had a better understanding of the world than he did. Eventually, Marie came to believe that she and Ferdinand were &quot;the best associates, the most loyal companions, but our lives intertwine only in certain matters&quot;. Ferdinand enjoyed Marie&#x27;s presence during military marches and consequently, she was frequently invited to this sort of event.

Marie gave birth to her first child, Prince Carol, only nine months after the marriage, on 15 October 1893. Although Marie requested the use of chloroform in order to ease the pains of labour, doctors were reluctant to do so, believing that &quot;women must pay in agony for the sins of Eve&quot;. After Marie&#x27;s mother and Queen Victoria insisted, King Carol eventually allowed the use of the drug on his niece-in-law. Marie did not derive much joy from the arrival of her firstborn, later writing that she &quot;felt like turning [her] head to the wall&quot;. Similarly, although Marie was constantly reminded by Carol&#x27;s wife Elisabeth that childbirth is &quot;the most glorious moment in [Marie&#x27;s] life&quot;, she could only feel a longing for her mother at the birth of her second child, Princess Elisabeth, in 1894. After becoming accustomed to life in Romania, Marie began to rejoice at the births of her children, namely Princess Maria (1900–61), nicknamed &quot;Mignon&quot; in the family, Prince Nicholas (1903–78), nicknamed &quot;Nicky&quot;, Princess Ileana (1909–91) and Prince Mircea (1913–16).

King Carol and Queen Elisabeth promptly removed Prince Carol and Princess Elisabeth from Marie&#x27;s care, considering it inappropriate for them to be raised by their young parents. Marie loved her children, but found it difficult to even scold them at times, thus failing to properly supervise them. Consequently, the royal children were given some education, but were never sent to school. As the royal household could not provide what a classroom education would have, most of the children&#x27;s personalities became severely flawed as they grew older. Prime Minister Ion G. Duca would later write that &quot;it was like [King Carol] wished to leave for Romania heirs completely unprepared for succeeding.&quot;

=== Life at court ===
From the start, Marie had trouble adjusting to life in Romania. Her personality and &quot;high spirits&quot; frequently created controversies at the Romanian court, and she disliked the austere atmosphere of her household. She wrote that she &quot;had not been brought down to Romania to be adored and spoilt and made much of; she had come to be part of the machinery King Carol had wound up. She had been imported to be trimmed, educated, cut down and trained according to the great man&#x27;s conception of things.&quot; When describing her early days in Romania, Marie wrote that &quot;for long hours [she] would mope, whilst [her] young husband did his military service, all alone in rooms [she] hated, heavy German rooms&quot;. Marie&#x27;s paternal aunt, the Empress Frederick, wrote to her daughter, the Crown Princess of Greece, that &quot;Missy of Roumania is more to be pitied than you. The King is a great tyrant in his family, &amp; has crushed the independence in Ferdinand so that no one cares about him, &amp; his beautiful &amp; gifted little wife, I fear, gets into scrapes, &amp; like a butterfly, instead of hovering over the flowers, burns her pretty wings by going rather near the fire!&quot; Easily learning to speak the Romanian language, Marie followed her mother&#x27;s advice to dress carefully and show respect for Orthodox rituals.

Marie and Ferdinand were advised by King Carol to maintain a restricted group of friends; thus, Marie would lament that her familial circle had been shrunk to only the King and Ferdinand, &quot;who stood in mighty awe of the iron old man, forever trembling that any action of [hers] might displease that duty-bound head of the family&quot;. &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; wrote that Marie had found herself, &quot;from the hour of her arrival in Bucharest under the tutelage of that stern disciplinarian King Carol I&quot;.

In 1896, Ferdinand and Marie moved to Cotroceni Palace, which had been extended by the Romanian architect Grigore Cerchez, and to which Marie added her own designs. The following year, Ferdinand was struck down with typhoid fever. For days, he was delirious and, despite his doctor&#x27;s best efforts, came close to dying. During this time, Marie exchanged numerous letters with her family in Britain and was terrified at the prospect of losing her husband. King Carol still had an heir in Prince Carol, whose young age presented issues; thus, the whole family desperately wished for Ferdinand to pull through. Eventually, he did, and he and Marie went to Sinaia, the site of Peleș Castle, for a period of recovery. Nonetheless, the couple was not able to attend celebrations for Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee that summer. During Ferdinand&#x27;s convalescence, Marie spent most of her time with her two children, taking them on long walks and picking flowers with them. The winter of 1897/1898 was spent with the Russian Imperial family on the French Riviera, where Marie often rode horses, in spite of the low temperatures.

Around this time, Marie met Lieutenant Gheorghe Cantacuzène, a member, albeit through an illegitimate branch, of an ancient Romanian princely family and a descendant of Prince Șerban Cantacuzino. Although not very good looking, Cantacuzène stood out using his sense of humour and fashion, as well as his talent in horse-riding. The two soon became romantically involved, but their affair was terminated after it became known by the public. As much as she condemned Marie&#x27;s behaviour, her mother allowed her to come to Coburg when, in 1897, she apparently became pregnant. Historian Julia Gelardi believes that Marie gave birth to a child at Coburg; the child may either have been stillborn or sent to an orphanage immediately following its birth. There was speculation on whether Marie&#x27;s second daughter, &quot;Mignon&quot;, was Cantacuzène&#x27;s daughter, and not Ferdinand&#x27;s. Over the following years, Marie was also rumoured to have been romantically linked to Grand Duke Boris Vladimirovich of Russia, Waldorf Astor, Prince Barbu Știrbey and Joe Boyle. In 1903, Ferdinand and Marie inaugurated the Pelișor Castle, an Art Nouveau castle in Sinaia that King Carol commissioned for the royal couple. Marie only learned of the extent of repression used to quell the 1907 Romanian Peasants&#x27; Revolt once it was too late to intercede. She afterwards took to dressing quite often in folk costume, both at home and in public, initiating a fashion trend among young upper-class women.

On 29 June 1913, the Tsardom of Bulgaria declared war on Greece, thus starting the Second Balkan War. On 4 July, Romania entered the war, allying itself with Greece. The war, which lasted a little over a month, was worsened by a cholera epidemic. Marie would look upon her first encounter with an epidemic as a turning point in her life. With the help of Dr. Ioan Cantacuzino and Sister Pucci, a Red Cross nurse, Marie travelled between Romania and Bulgaria, lending a helping hand in hospitals. These events would prepare her for her experiences in the Great War. As a result of the war, Romania gained possession of Southern Dobrudja, including the coastal town of Balchik (&quot;Balcic&quot;), which Marie would come to cherish in 1924 and use to host her residence, called The Quiet Nest. Soon after the war ended, Carol became ill.

On 28 June 1914, at Sarajevo, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated. This came as a shock to Marie and her family, who were vacationing at Sinaia when the news reached them. On 28 July, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia and, as Marie saw it, &quot;the world&#x27;s peace was torn to shreds&quot;. Then, on 3 August, King Carol held a Crown Council at Sinaia, in order to decide whether Romania should enter the war. Although Carol was in favour of his country supporting Germany and the Central Powers, the council decided against it. Not long after the council, Carol&#x27;s illness worsened and he became bed-ridden; the possibility of his abdication was even discussed. Eventually, he died on 10 October 1914 and Ferdinand automatically succeeded as king.

== Queen of Romania (1914–1927) ==
=== World War I ===
On 11 October 1914, Marie and Ferdinand were acclaimed as king and queen in the Chamber of Deputies. Princess Anne Marie Callimachi, a close friend of Marie&#x27;s, wrote that &quot;as Crown Princess, [Marie] had been popular; as queen, she was more loved&quot;. Marie maintained a certain influence on her husband and the entire court, leading historian A. L. Easterman to write that &quot;it was not [Ferdinand], but Marie who ruled in Romania&quot;. At the time of Ferdinand&#x27;s accession, the government was led by the liberal prime minister Ion I. C. Brătianu. Ferdinand and Marie jointly decided to not make many changes in court and let people accept the transition from one regime to another, rather than force them. Thus, many of Carol and Elisabeth&#x27;s servants were kept in place, even the ones who were not particularly liked. With Brătianu&#x27;s help, Marie began pressuring Ferdinand into entering the war; concurrently, she contacted various reigning relatives in Europe and bargained for the best terms for Romania, in case the country should enter the war. Marie favoured an alliance with the Triple Entente (Russia, France and Britain), partly because of her British ancestry. Neutrality was not without perils, and entering the war with the Entente meant that Romania would act as Russia&#x27;s &quot;buffer&quot; against possible attacks.

Eventually, Marie demanded of Ferdinand in no uncertain terms that he enter the war, leading the French minister to Romania, Auguste Félix de Beaupoil, Count of Saint-Aulaire, to remark that Marie was twice an ally to the French: once by birth and once by heart. Ferdinand gave in to Marie&#x27;s pleas, and he signed a treaty with the Entente on 17 August 1916. On 27 August, Romania formally declared war on Austria-Hungary. Saint-Aulaire wrote that Marie &quot;embraced war as another might embrace religion&quot;. After informing their children that their country had entered the war, Ferdinand and Marie dismissed their German servants, who could only remain in their employ as &quot;war prisoners&quot; of sorts. Early on during the war, Marie was involved in aiding the Romanian Red Cross and visited hospitals daily. During the first month of hostilities, Romania fought no less than nine battles; some, such as the Battle of Turtucaia, took place on its own soil.

On 2 November 1916, Marie&#x27;s youngest son, Prince Mircea, who had been sick with typhoid fever, died at Buftea. Marie was distraught and wrote in her journal: &quot;Can anything ever be the same?&quot; After Bucharest fell to Austrian troops, the royal court was transferred to Iași, capital of the Moldavia region, in December 1916. There, she continued to act as a nurse in military hospitals. Daily, Marie would dress as a nurse and go to the train station, where she would receive more injured soldiers; then she would transport them to hospital.

After the conclusion of the Russian Revolution in early November 1917 and the victory of the Bolsheviks, Romania became, in the words of diplomat Frank Rattigan, &quot;an island surrounded on all sides by the enemy, with no hope of assistance from the Allies&quot;. Soon afterwards, Ferdinand signed the Treaty of Focșani, on 9 December 1917. Marie considered the treaty perilous, while Brătianu and Știrbey believed it was a necessary measure for obtaining more time. Later turns of events would prove Marie to have assumed correctly. In 1918, Marie vehemently opposed the signing of the Treaty of Bucharest, giving rise to her description as &quot;truly the only man in Romania&quot;. The Armistice with Germany (11 November 1918) put an end to fighting in Europe and, thus, to the war.

In the tenth century, the Principality of Hungary had begun conquering Transylvania, which Hungarians had fully occupied by around 1200. The idea of a &quot;Greater Romania&quot; had existed in the minds of Romanians in Transylvania for some time and Brătianu had actively supported the concept before the war. In 1918, both Bessarabia and Bukovina voted for union with Romania. An assembly took place in the ancient city of Alba Iulia on 1 December 1918, where Vasile Goldiș read the resolution for the union of Transylvania with the Old Kingdom. This document, supported by Romanian as well as Saxon deputies, established a &quot;High National Romanian Council&quot; () for the province&#x27;s temporary administration. Marie wrote, &quot;the dream of &quot;România Mare&quot; seems to be becoming a reality ... it is all so incredible that I hardly dare believe it.&quot; After the assembly, Ferdinand and Marie returned to Bucharest, where they were met by general mirth: &quot;a day of &#x27;wild, delirious enthusiasm&#x27;, with the bands crashing and the troops marching and the people cheering&quot;. Allied troops took part in the celebration and Marie was elated to see the Entente on Romanian soil for the first time. Around this time, Marie became infected with the Spanish flu, with symptoms peaking a week after Alba Iulia; her diary describes &quot;a changed being, miserable and weak, brought to the brink of despair by so much headache and terrible sickness that sapped me of my strength&quot;.

=== Paris Peace Conference ===

Because Ferdinand had refused to sign the Treaty of Bucharest and because Romania had been hostile towards the Central Powers until the end of the war, its place among the winning countries during the Paris Peace Conference was guaranteed. The official delegation was led by Brătianu, who had just begun his third term as prime minister. Brătianu&#x27;s rigidity, combined with French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau&#x27;s reluctance to overlook Ferdinand&#x27;s acceptance of the Treaty of Bucharest, led to open conflict and the Romanian delegation left Paris, much to the dismay of the &quot;Big Four&quot;. Hoping to resolve the situation, Saint-Aulaire suggested that Marie should be sent to the conference instead. The Queen was delighted at the prospect.

Marie arrived in Paris on 6 March 1919. She was immediately popular with the French people, due to her boldness during the War. Upon meeting Marie, Clemenceau abruptly told her, &quot;I don&#x27;t like your Prime Minister&quot;, to which she replied, &quot;Perhaps then you&#x27;ll find me more agreeable.&quot; He did, and president Raymond Poincaré noticed a change in Clemenceau&#x27;s attitude towards Romania after Marie&#x27;s arrival. After staying in Paris for a week, Marie accepted King George V and Queen Mary&#x27;s invitation and crossed the English Channel, lodging at Buckingham Palace. Hoping to acquire as much goodwill for Romania as possible, Marie became acquainted with many important political figures of the time, including Lord Curzon, Winston Churchill, and Waldorf and Nancy Astor. She also frequently visited her son Nicky, who was then in school at Eton College. Marie was elated to have returned to England after so much time, writing that &quot;it was a tremendous emotion to arrive in London, and to be greeted at the station by George and May.&quot;

After the end of her visit in England, Marie returned to Paris, where the people were just as excited for her arrival as they had been a few weeks before. Crowds gathered around her frequently, waiting to see the &quot;exotic&quot; Queen of Romania. American President Woodrow Wilson remained unimpressed by Marie, and her comments on Russian laws dealing with sexual relations, which were considered inappropriate, did not help. Marie shocked many officials by waving all her ministers aside and leading negotiations herself. On this, she later commented, &quot;Never mind, you&#x27;ll all just have to get used to accepting me with the faults of my virtues.&quot; Marie left Paris with numerous supplies for Romania&#x27;s relief, and later that year the conference resulted in the international recognition of Greater Romania, thus doubling Ferdinand and Marie&#x27;s kingdom to and increasing the population by ten million. This led Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia, who briefly lived in Bucharest, to conclude that &quot;by her charm, beauty, and ready wit, [Marie] could obtain anything she desired&quot;.

=== Dynastic efforts ===
In 1920, Marie&#x27;s eldest daughter, Princess Elisabeth, was engaged to Prince George of Greece, the eldest son of the deposed King Constantine I of Greece and Marie&#x27;s cousin Sophia. After inviting George and his two sisters, the Princesses Helen and Irene, to lodge with them at Sinaia, Marie organised numerous activities for the young couple and was delighted at the prospect of marrying off her daughter, whose character was severely flawed. In October, reports of King Alexander&#x27;s death came from Greece; the Greek princesses had to return to their parents as soon as possible. The following day, news arrived that Marie&#x27;s mother had died in her sleep in Zürich. Marie made arrangements for her departure to Switzerland, where she would take Helen and Irene to their parents and arrange her mother&#x27;s funeral. Meanwhile, George and Elisabeth would remain at Sinaia.

Soon enough, Crown Prince Carol proposed to Princess Helen and they were married the following year. Marie was delighted, as she had frowned upon Carol&#x27;s relationship with Zizi Lambrino and had been worried at the birth of their illegitimate son Carol, who, to her great relief, had been given his mother&#x27;s surname. In 1922, Marie married her second daughter, &quot;Mignon&quot;, to Alexander I of Serbia (later of Yugoslavia). She was delighted at the births of her two royal grandsons, Prince Michael of Romania (1921–2017) and Prince Peter of Yugoslavia (1923–1970); the births of two grandchildren destined to sit on Europe&#x27;s thrones seemed to cement her ambitions. Marie&#x27;s dynastic efforts were viewed by critics as those of a manipulative mother who would sacrifice her children&#x27;s happiness in order to fulfil her ambitions; in reality, Marie never forced any of her children to marry. While attending Peter&#x27;s baptism, Marie met the Duchess of York, later Queen Elizabeth, by whom she was enchanted.

In 1924, Ferdinand and Marie undertook a diplomatic tour of France, Switzerland, Belgium and the United Kingdom. In England, she was warmly welcomed by George V, who declared that &quot;apart from the common aims, which we pursue, there are other and dear ties between us. Her Majesty the Queen, my dear cousin, is British born.&quot; Similarly, Marie wrote that the day of her arrival in England was &quot;a great day for me, one of emotions, sweet, happy and the same time glorious emotions to come back as Queen to my own country, to be received officially, in all honour and enthusiastically into the bargain – to feel your heart swell with pride and satisfaction, to feel your heart beat and tears start into your eyes, while something gave you a lump into your throat!&quot; These state visits were a symbolic recognition of the prestige Romania had gained after World War I. Whilst visiting Geneva, Marie and Ferdinand became the first royals to enter the newly established headquarters of the League of Nations.

===Coronation===
The location for Marie and Ferdinand&#x27;s coronation was Alba Iulia, which had been an important fortress in the Middle Ages and where Michael the Brave had been declared &quot;Voivode&quot; of Transylvania in 1599, thus bringing Wallachia and Transylvania under his personal union. An Orthodox cathedral was built as the Coronation Cathedral in 1921–1922. An elaborate set of jewellery and clothing was made especially for the coronation. Marie&#x27;s crown was designed by painter Costin Petrescu and it was made in the Art Nouveau style by Falize, a Parisian jewelry house. The crown was inspired by that of Milica Despina, the wife of 16th-century Wallachian ruler Neagoe Basarab, and it was made entirely out of Transylvanian gold. The crown had two pendants on the sides; one contained an image of the royal arms of Romania and the other, the arms of the Duke of Edinburgh, which Marie had used as her own arms prior to her marriage. The crown, which cost around 65,000 francs, was paid for by the state, via a special law.

Among the guests at the royal couple&#x27;s coronation were Marie&#x27;s sister &quot;Baby Bee&quot;, the Duke of York and French generals Maxime Weygand and Henri Mathias Berthelot, who had led the French military mission to Romania. The ceremony was conducted by the Metropolitan of All Romania, Miron Cristea, but it was not performed inside the cathedral as Ferdinand, a Roman Catholic, refused to be crowned by a member of the Eastern Orthodox Church. After placing his crown on his own head, Ferdinand crowned Marie, who had knelt before him. Immediately, cannons were fired as a sign that the first king and queen of Greater Romania had been anointed. A feast was given in the same room where the union had been proclaimed in 1918; there, more than 20,000 peasants were offered roast steaks. The following day, Ferdinand and Marie triumphantly entered Bucharest. The splendour of the coronation was subsequently cited as evidence of Marie&#x27;s theatricality. Marie would be received into the Romanian Orthodox Church in 1926, mentioning a desire to be closer to her people.

=== Visit to America ===
The Maryhill Museum of Art in Maryhill, Washington, was initially designed as a mansion for wealthy businessman Samuel Hill. However, at Loie Fuller&#x27;s behest, the building was turned into a museum instead. Hill wished it to be dedicated in 1926, and he conceived it as a monument to peace, to his wife Mary, and to Queen Marie herself. Marie agreed to come to America and witness the dedication, especially as Fuller was an old friend of hers. Fuller quickly put together a committee that supported Marie&#x27;s &quot;tour&quot; of America and arrangements were made for her departure. Marie viewed the tour as an opportunity to &quot;see the country, meet the people and put Romania on the map&quot;. She travelled by ship across the Atlantic Ocean and disembarked in New York, on 18 October 1926, accompanied by Prince Nicholas and Princess Ileana.

Upon her arrival, Marie was welcomed enthusiastically with the &quot;whistle of steamers, roar of guns in white smoke puffs against gray fog, voices cheering in a stinging rain&quot;. She was formally greeted by Jimmy Walker, the Mayor of New York City. Constance Lily Morris, author of &quot;On Tour with Queen Marie&quot;, wrote that the people were excited for Marie&#x27;s arrival mainly because of her almost mythical allure, which had been created by papers and rumour throughout her life; she observed that &quot;the modest Queen of the Belgians had once come with her king for a brief visit and years ago the dusky Hawaiian ruler had honored us, but there had been no others. The time could not have been better set.&quot; Marie was also fairly popular within suffragette circles, where she was viewed as &quot;a woman whose wits had devised many a coup d&#x27;état, whose brains had thought out many a difficult problem for her people, who had used the gifts given her to further every good purpose&quot;.

During their time in America, Marie, Nicholas and Ileana undertook tours of several cities, including Philadelphia. They were very popular, and were greeted with equal enthusiasm in each city they visited, so much so that &quot;[Nicholas and Ileana] seemed fairly dazed by their tremendous ovation&quot;. At the White House, the official dinner was marked by awkward moments, due to the morose attitude of President Calvin Coolidge and his wife Grace; Marie lingered less than two hours. Before leaving the United States, Marie was presented with a bullet-proof armored town car by Willys-Knight, which she joyfully accepted. On 24 November, Marie and her children were seen off by a delegation from Washington, D.C., as they prepared to leave by ship from New York Harbor. Morris wrote that &quot;our last view was of Her Majesty, her children on either side, waving back with that tear-and-smile of those who pass from happy scenes.&quot; Morris accompanied the queen throughout her journey and offered a very detailed account of Marie&#x27;s time in America in her book, published in 1927.

Marie was delighted with the visit, and wished to return to America as soon as possible. She wrote in her diaries:

&quot;both my children and I have but one dream: to return! To return to that stupendous New World, which makes you almost guiddy because of its immencity, its noise, its striving, its fearful impetuous to get on, to do always more, always bigger, quicker, more astonishingly a restless, flaring great world, where I think everything can be realised ... I know, as long as I live, breathe and think, the love for America will beautify my life and thoughts ... Perhaps Fate will allow me one day to go back to America.&quot;
== Widowhood (1927–1938) ==
=== 1927–1930 ===
Prince Carol sparked a dynastic crisis when he officially renounced his rights to succeed Ferdinand on 5 January 1926, simultaneously waiving all parental rights over Prince Michael, who had been proclaimed heir apparent. A Provisional Regency Bill was passed, creating a regency council composed of Prince Nicholas; the Orthodox Patriarch, Miron Cristea; and Gheorghe Buzdugan, the president of the Court of Cassation. However, both Marie and Ferdinand were reluctant to leave the country in the hands of a five-year-old boy, even overseen by a regency, for fear that the lands gained during World War I would be reclaimed by neighbouring countries and that political disturbances might lead to civil unrest. Nevertheless, when Marie returned from America, Ferdinand&#x27;s death seemed imminent. He was suffering from intestinal cancer, and by April 1927 had come so close to death as to be given the last rites of the Catholic Church. He died on 20 July, in Marie&#x27;s arms. She later wrote: &quot;&#x27;I am so tired&#x27; were his last words and when he lay so quiet in my arms one hour later, I knew that I must thank God for &quot;him&quot; at least. This was rest indeed.&quot;

Michael automatically succeeded as king upon Ferdinand&#x27;s death and the regency council took charge of his role as monarch. In May 1928, Carol, who had found his life abroad with Magda Lupescu unsatisfactory, attempted to return to Romania with the help of the 1st Viscount Rothermere. He was prevented from doing so by English authorities, who then proceeded to expel him from England. Infuriated, Marie sent an official apology to George V on behalf of her son, who had already begun plotting a coup d&#x27;état. Carol succeeded in divorcing Princess Helen on 21 June 1928, on grounds of incompatibility.

Marie&#x27;s popularity was severely affected during Michael&#x27;s reign and, after refusing to be part of the regency council in 1929, she was accused by the press, and even by Princess Helen, of plotting a coup. During this time, there were numerous rumours as to Princess Ileana&#x27;s marriage. After talk of Ileana marrying the Tsar of Bulgaria or the Prince of Asturias, she was eventually betrothed to Alexander, Count of Hochberg, a minor German prince, in early 1930. This betrothal was, however, short-lived and Marie never managed to conclude a political marriage for her youngest daughter, instead marrying her to Archduke Anton of Austria–Tuscany in 1931.

=== Carol II&#x27;s reign ===
On 6 June 1930, Carol arrived in Bucharest and made his way into Parliament, where the Act of Succession 1927 was duly declared null. Thus, Carol usurped the throne from his son, becoming King Carol II. Upon hearing of Carol&#x27;s return, Marie, who was abroad, was relieved. She had been growing anxious with the direction in which the country was heading and viewed Carol&#x27;s return as the return of the Prodigal Son. However, as soon as she arrived in Bucharest, she became aware that things would not go well. Carol refused to accept his mother&#x27;s advice to take Helen back and never sought Marie&#x27;s counsel during his reign, thus making the already existing breach between mother and son complete.

Desolate and almost stripped of her belief, Marie turned to the religious teachings of the Baháʼí Faith, which she found &quot;vastly appealing&quot;. She was particularly attracted by the idea of humanity&#x27;s unification under one faith, given her own religiously divided family. Introduced to the doctrine by Martha Root, Marie carried on a correspondence with Shoghi Effendi, then head of the Faith, where she expressed herself as a follower of the Baháʼí teachings. Additionally, she made several public statements promoting the teachings of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, describing him as a prophet similar to Jesus or Muhammad. This written correspondence has led Baháʼís to regard her as the first royal convert to their religion. Biographer Hannah Pakula notes that Marie &quot;continued to attend the Protestant Church&quot;, even though she &quot;prayed &#x27;better at home with my Baha-u-llah books and teachings.&#x27;&quot; In 1976, William McElwee Miller published a polemical book against the religion, which included selections from a letter written in 1970 by Marie&#x27;s daughter Ileana denying any such conversion had taken place.

In 1931, Prince Nicholas eloped with Ioana Doletti, a divorced woman. Marie strongly disapproved of her son&#x27;s actions and felt hurt by Doletti&#x27;s repeated attempts to keep Nicholas from communicating with his mother. Although she blamed the women in her sons&#x27; lives for a while, she also came to blame herself, for failing to educate them properly. However, she stubbornly and continually refused to meet Magda Lupescu, even after Carol&#x27;s pleas. Until her last years, Marie seldom even mentioned Lupescu&#x27;s name.

With Carol&#x27;s mistress hated throughout the country, it was only a matter of time before opposition to the King emerged. This opposition most prominently came under the form of the Iron Guard, a group supported by Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler. After Carol turned to Ion Duca for help, the Iron Guard assassinated Duca in December 1933. After Duca&#x27;s death, Carol&#x27;s popularity plummeted and there were rumours that an attempt would be made on his life at the annual independence parade. In order to avoid this, he instead had Marie attend the parade, in what would be her final public appearance.

After the parade, Carol set out to destroy his mother&#x27;s popularity among Romanians and tried to push her out of the country. Marie, however, did not comply, instead retreating to either of two locales. The first was Bran Castle. Located near Brașov in southern Transylvania and given to her as a gift in 1920 by grateful local officials, she had it restored over the next seven years. The other was Balchik, where she had built a palace and a small chapel called &quot;Stella Maris&quot; and tended to her garden. She also visited Ileana and her children in Austria. Ileana rarely received permission from Carol to visit Romania; this irritated Marie greatly. She also spent some time in Belgrade with her daughter &quot;Mignon&quot; and her son-in-law, King Alexander. In 1934, Marie visited England once again.

=== Illness and death ===
During the summer of 1937, Marie fell ill. Her personal physician, Dr. Castellani, determined she had pancreatic cancer, although her official diagnosis was cirrhosis of the liver. Marie had not been a drinker and, upon hearing the news, she reportedly said: &quot;then there must be a non-alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver, because I have never in my life tasted alcohol.&quot; She was prescribed a diet of cold foods, injections and bed rest. Marie was so weak at times that she could not even pick up a pen. In February 1938, she was sent to a sanatorium in Italy, in hopes that she might recover. There, she was visited by Nicholas and his wife, whom Marie eventually forgave for her transgressions. She was also visited by Princess Helen, whom she had not seen in nearly seven years, and Waldorf Astor. Marie was eventually transferred to a sanatorium in Dresden. Growing weaker and weaker, she requested that she be taken back to Romania, in order to die there. Carol denied her a journey by aeroplane, and she declined a medical flight offered by Hitler, instead choosing to return to Romania by train. She was brought to the Pelișor Castle.

Marie died on 18 July 1938, at 5:38 p.m., eight minutes after lapsing into a coma. Her two eldest children, Carol and Elisabeth, accompanied by Prince Michael, were at her deathbed. Two days later, on 20 July, Marie&#x27;s body was brought to Bucharest, where she lay in state in the white drawing room at Cotroceni Palace. Her coffin was surrounded by flowers and glowing tapers and was guarded by officers of the Fourth Hussars. Thousands of people filed by Marie&#x27;s bier during the three-day lying in state and, on the third day, the palace was opened for factory workers. Marie&#x27;s funeral cortege made its way to the train station, passing under the Arch of Triumph. Her coffin was taken to Curtea de Argeș Monastery, where she was interred. Marie&#x27;s heart, according to her own wishes, was placed in a small golden casket embellished with the emblems of the Romanian provinces and interred in her &quot;Stella Maris&quot; chapel in Balchik. In 1940, after Southern Dobrudja was ceded to Bulgaria during World War II, her heart was transferred to Bran Castle. There, Ileana built a chapel to house the heart, kept in two nested boxes placed inside a marble sarcophagus.

Marie was the last queen consort of Romania, as Princess Helen was accorded only the title of Queen Mother between 1940 and 1947. She was one of Queen Victoria&#x27;s five crowned granddaughters and one of three to retain their positions as consort after the conclusion of World War I, alongside the Queen of Norway and the Queen of Spain.

== Legacy ==
===Author===
According to one of her biographers, Diana Mandache, Marie published 34 books and short stories during her lifetime. Encouraged to write by her aunt Queen Elisabeth, she found a source of inspiration in the memoirs of King Carol I. Her first book, &quot;The Lily of Life&quot;, appeared at Bucharest in 1912. Written in the English she would always use, but soon translated into Romanian, it is a fairy tale with symbolic characters. &quot;My Country&quot;, published in London in 1916 and in Paris the following year, combined a variety of genres in an effort to raise Allied support for Romania. Nicolae Iorga wrote and published a Romanian translation in 1917, and an expanded version appeared in 1925.

Her critically acclaimed autobiography, &quot;The Story of My Life&quot;, published by Cassell in London, in three volumes, came out in 1934-1935. The book was reviewed by Virginia Woolf, who felt it was too familiarizing of the royal family. She stated that &quot;suppose that among the autumn books of 2034 is &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot;, by George the Sixth, or &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, by Elizabeth the Second, what will be the effect upon their loyal subjects? Will the British Empire survive? Will Buckingham Palace look as solid then as it does now? Words are dangerous things, let us remember. A republic might be brought into being by a poem.&quot; At the same time, she appreciated its depiction of a &quot;royal animal&quot; escaping its gilded cage. Critic Octav Șuluțiu emphasized the work&#x27;s value as a historical document and its psychological insight.

Marie wrote a few diary pages in 1914 upon the death of Carol I, but started keeping a daily diary in August 1916, on the day Romania entered World War I. She wrote new entries almost every day during the war and after, with some pauses in her later years. The first volume was published in 1996. Ten additional books of entries appeared between 2006 and 2014; Marie&#x27;s war diary, edited by Lucian Boia, was published in 2014; and the entries from her final years were released to the public in 2018.

===Public figure===
Even before becoming queen, Marie had succeeded in establishing her public image as that of &quot;one of the best-looking and richest princesses in Europe&quot;. She was known primarily for her talent in horse-riding, writing, painting, sculpting and dancing, as well as for her beauty. Her popularity was dimmed by two slanderous campaigns: that conducted by the Central Powers during World War I; and that led by Communist officials after Romania&#x27;s transition to a Socialist Republic in 1947.

During Romania&#x27;s 42 years under Communist rule, Marie was alternately depicted as either an &quot;agent of English capitalism&quot; or as a devoted patriot who believed that her destiny was intertwined with that of Romania. In the 1949 &quot;Adevărata istorie a unei monarhii&quot; (&quot;The True History of a Monarchy&quot;), author Alexandru Gârneață refers to orgies that supposedly were held by Marie at Cotroceni and Balchik and claims that her cirrhosis was caused by her heavy drinking, even offering examples of instances when a drunken Marie needed to be carried off a yacht by her fellow drinkers. Marie&#x27;s supposed extramarital affairs were brought forward as evidence of promiscuity, which contravened Communist values. In 1968, Communist officials vandalised the chapel sheltering Marie&#x27;s heart, opening the sarcophagus and taking the boxes as well as the heart into Bran Castle. In 1971, these were transferred to Bucharest&#x27;s National Museum of Romanian History. It was not until the late period of Nicolae Ceaușescu&#x27;s regime, the last years before the Romanian Revolution, that Marie&#x27;s merits came to be acknowledged.

In Romania, Marie is known by the nickname &quot;Mama Răniților&quot; (&quot;Mother of the Wounded&quot;), or simply as &quot;Regina Maria&quot;, while in other countries she is remembered as the &quot;Soldier Queen&quot; and &quot;Mamma Regina&quot;. Marie is also nicknamed &quot;the mother-in-law of the Balkans&quot;, due to her children&#x27;s marriages into the region&#x27;s ruling houses. By the time of her death, Marie&#x27;s children had ruled in three Balkan countries, although her descendants no longer occupy any European throne. Marie was called &quot;one of the greatest figures in Romanian history&quot; by Constantin Argetoianu, and in her honour, Romania established the Order of the Cross of Queen Marie in 1917.

Oscar Han executed a bronze bust of Marie. Unveiled in the center of Balchik in 1933, it was evacuated to Constanța during the Romanian withdrawal of 1940. It then spent most of the next eight decades in storage, at times being threatened with melting under the Communist regime and receiving a bullet hole in the back of the head. The restored bust was placed in front of the Constanța art museum in 2020. A statue of Queen Marie was unveiled in Ashford, Kent, in December 2018, to mark her birth and childhood at the nearby Eastwell Park. Soon afterwards, a fictionalised account of her role in the Paris Peace Conference was given in a feature film, &quot;Queen Marie&quot;, while American author Laurie R. King depicted the queen at Bran in the mystery novel &quot;Castle Shade&quot;.

===Personal effects and jewels===
Prior to 2009, many of Marie&#x27;s personal belongings were on display at Bran Castle, her residence in her later years, which functions as a museum. That year, when the castle was legally restored to Princess Ileana&#x27;s heirs, the Culture Ministry moved the collection of her items to a nearby building, &quot;Vama Medievală&quot;, which is also open to visitors. In 2015, the casket containing the queen&#x27;s heart was placed on a pedestal in the room at Pelișor where she died; the display can be viewed by the public.

The Maryhill Museum of Art holds a permanent exhibition titled &quot;Marie, Queen of Romania&quot;. This display includes the queen&#x27;s coronation gown, a copy of the crown, silverware, gilt furniture, and jewelry, among other items.

The Queen Marie of Romania Sapphire is named from its association with Marie. Originally set in a necklace by Cartier in 1913, the drop jewel weighs 478 carats. It was transferred to a diamond necklace in 1919 and King Ferdinand purchased it for Marie in 1921. The price was 1,375,000 francs, to be paid in four instalments until 1924. At the time, large jewelry had not excited Marie&#x27;s interest; she preferred to wear a Greek cross or, when she attended the Paris Opera, her pearls. However, the sapphire sautoir (jewel chain) was an ideal match for the sapphire tiara she had bought from Russian exile Grand Duchess Vladimir. She wore them both at her coronation receptions and when sitting for her portrait by Philip de László. During her visit to the United States, when she presided over a ball at the New York Ritz-Carlton, one observer remarked: &quot;There was a heavy chain of diamonds, broken at intervals with squares of massive design. From this chain was suspended an unbelievable egg-shaped sapphire, one of the largest, it is said, in the world&quot;.

<text>Bruce George Sundlun (January 19, 1920 – July 21, 2011) was an American businessman, politician and member of the Democratic Party who served as 71st governor of Rhode Island between 1991 and 1995.

He was Rhode Island&#x27;s second Jewish governor, and the only Jewish governor in the United States during his two terms. In addition to politics, Sundlun had a varied career as a military pilot, federal attorney, practicing lawyer, corporate executive and university lecturer.

==Early life and education==
Sundlun was born in Providence on January 19, 1920, to Walter Irving Sundlun and Jennette &quot;Jan&quot; Zelda (née Colitz) Sundlun. His grandparents were Lithuanian Jewish immigrants.

Sundlun attended the Gordon School, Classical High School (Providence) and the Tabor Academy (Marion, Massachusetts). In 1933, while attending Boy Scout camp at Camp Yawgoog, he fell through ice on a pond and was rescued by a young John Chafee; and while in high school, he was a track star and excelled in long jump events.

Upon finishing college classes begun in 1938, he received a B.A. from Williams College in 1946 after serving during World War II in the United States Army Air Forces flying B-17 bombers in the 8th Air Force in England. He attended Harvard Law School, graduating with an LL.B. in 1949.

==Military service==
While still in college, Sundlun volunteered for service in the U.S. Army Air Forces Aviation Cadet Program on December 8, 1941, at Westover Field. He was trained as a four-engine bomber pilot at Maxwell Field in Alabama, after basic flight training at the USAAC Southeast Training Center at Orangeburg, South Carolina, the Greenville Army Air Field at Greenville, Mississippi, and George Field in Lawrenceville, Illinois.

During overseas active duty beginning in June 1943, Sundlun served as a B-17 Flying Fortress pilot in the England-based 545th Bombardment Squadron, 384th Bomb Group of the Eighth Air Force at Grafton-Underwood Air Base. On December 1, 1943, during his 13th bombing mission, his plane the &quot;Damn Yankee&quot; was damaged by flak during the bombing of Solingen, Germany, knocking out one of the engines and jamming the bomb bay doors in an open position.

On the slowed return trip to England, the damaged &quot;Damn Yankee&quot; was intercepted by a squadron of Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters while over Nazi-occupied Jabbeke, Belgium, and they inflicted further damage to the plane causing its crash. Sundlun and his copilot Lt. Andrew J. Boles were able to bank the airplane hard to the left to avoid crashing into the town center and ditched it safely into a turnip field at Zomerweg 41 , south of Jabbeke. A monument commemorating the crash was erected on the side of the road near the crash site by the citizens of Jabbeke in 2009 and he was named an honorary citizen because his action saved countless lives in the town center of Jabbeke. Of the ten-man crew, four were killed while in the plane, five were quickly captured by German forces on the ground, with Sundlun the only crew member able to evade capture.
Sundlun made his way across Belgium and France by stealing bicycles in the morning near the market centers of small towns and seeking aid from local Catholic priests in the evening.

After six months time cooperating with the French Resistance under the code name &quot;Salamander&quot;, he made several attempts to enter Spain near Biarritz, and later near Foix. But after deciding that there was too much danger of capture or loss in the snowy Pyrenees, he made his way on stolen bicycles north-eastward across France and escaped into Switzerland on May 5, 1944, near Fêche-l&#x27;Église. Before escaping into Switzerland, he was engaged with the Maquis in acts of sabotage near Belfort against German Army units under the command of Russian defector General Andrey Vlasov.

Once Sundlun entered Switzerland he turned himself in to Swiss authorities and was interned along with other Allied military officers at a hotel in Davos. Within a few months after it was learned about his ability to travel in France undetected, Sundlun was recruited by Allen Dulles to work out of the U.S. Embassy in Bern under the auspices of the Office of Strategic Services in the early preparations for Operation Sunrise. Later under the orders of Dulles, he reentered France to act as a bombardment spotter for the Allied invasion of Marseille in mid-August 1944. After a brief service as a pilot of C-54 Skymaster cargo planes into Karachi, and over &quot;The Hump&quot; to Kunming after VE Day, he ferried bombers (B-24 Liberators and B-29 Superfortresses) from the U.S. mainland to Tinian in the Mariana Islands and into other bases in the Pacific Theater of Operations.

In August 1945, Sundlun attained the rank of captain, and left active service at the end of the war. He received the Purple Heart, Distinguished Flying Cross, and Air Medal with two oak leaf clusters from the U.S. military, and in 1977 he received the Chevalier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur from the French government.

Despite ending his active service in 1945, he remained in the U.S. Air Force Reserve and rose through the officer ranks until he retired as a colonel in 1980 after serving with the 376th Troop Carrier Squadron at Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts, and the 459th Troop Carrier Group, Medium at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland He was a member of the Rhode Island Commandery of the Military Order of Foreign Wars, a military society of commissioned officers who served during wartime and their descendants.

In September 1948 Sundlun flew surplus B-17 bombers from Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona to the newly created state of Israel to help form the Israeli Air Force. Years later, on November 27, 1979, he was awarded the Prime Minister&#x27;s Medal by Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin for his services to the State of Israel.

===Military awards and decorations===


==Legal and business career==
From 1949 to 1972, Sundlun was a practicing attorney. In 1949, he was appointed by Attorney General J. Howard McGrath to serve as an Assistant United States Attorney in Washington, D.C., and later served as a Special Assistant to the U.S. Attorney General. From 1954 to 1972, he was in private law practice in both Washington, D.C. and Providence, with the law firms of &quot;Amram, Hahn, and Sundlun&quot; and &quot;Sundlun, Tirana and Scher&quot;.
 Sundlun was active as a businessman from the 1960s through the 1990s. He was a pioneer in the jet charter industry in 1964 by being one of the founding members on the board of directors of Executive Jet Aviation (EJA), along with Air Force generals Curtis E. LeMay and Paul Tibbetts, and entertainers James Stewart and Arthur Godfrey, with retired Air Force Brigadier General Olbert F. &quot;Dick&quot; Lassiter as president and chairman of the board. Shortly after incorporation in Ohio, Sundlun arranged financing for EJA by engineering a stock purchase by American Contract Company of Wilmington, Delaware, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Railroad. EJA initially began operations in 1964 with a fleet of ten Learjet 23 aircraft.

Several years later, a number of financial and legal improprieties were made by Lassiter including the purchase of Boeing 707 and Boeing 727 aircraft in violation of federal law prohibiting railroad ownership of large aircraft. An order by the Civil Aeronautics Board for EJA to either dispose of the large airplanes or for the Penn Central Railroad to divest its $22 million investment led to the near collapse of EJA in 1970. The company&#x27;s creditors reacted by demanding the removal of Lassiter as president.

On July 2, 1970, Sundlun was installed as EJA president, and he set out to rebuild the company. Under his leadership, the big jets were sold and he brought the company into the black. In the process, Sundlun, Robert Lee Scott Jr. and Joseph Samuels &quot;Dody&quot; Sinclair, grandson of one of the founders of The Outlet Company of Providence, borrowed $1.25 million from the Industrial Trust Company of Providence to buy out Penn Central&#x27;s interest in EJA. That purchase was completed in 1972 as part of the Penn Central Railroad&#x27;s bankruptcy proceedings. When Paul Tibbetts became president of EJA in 1976, he said the company&#x27;s turnaround, under Sundlun&#x27;s guidance, was one of the nation&#x27;s great business success stories of that decade. By the end of Sundlun&#x27;s presidency, EJA was doing business with approximately 250 contract flying customers and logging more than three million miles per year. Sundlun remained on the board of directors of EJA until it was sold in 1984 to a group of investors led by Richard Santulli. The company is still in business with the name of NetJets as one of the holdings of Berkshire Hathaway.

From 1976 to 1988, Sundlun was president and chief executive officer of The Outlet Company, a department store and broadcast communications company in Providence. In close association with Dody Sinclair, he led the diversification of the corporation by expanding its radio and television broadcast communications portfolio in the 1970s and 1980s until it had 147 retail stores and 11 radio and television stations. He presided over the corporation during the 1981 sale of the company&#x27;s flagship Providence department store, sale of several radio stations, the merger of The Outlet Company with the Rockefeller Group in 1984, and the renaming of the company to Outlet Communications.

In 1986 after the Rockefeller family voted to not expand further into broadcast communications, a group of Outlet Communications executives, led by Sundlun and Dody Sinclair, executed a leveraged buyout of the company. Remaining as president throughout the entire merger and leveraged buyout sequence, Sundlun led the doubling of Outlet Communications holdings of licensed television broadcast stations from 4 to 11 across the country. During his last three years as president (1986–88), he led the sale of the Outlet Communications stations in Orlando, San Antonio and Sacramento.

==Politics and public service==
Sundlun ran twice but lost the Rhode Island governorship races in 1986 and 1988, but won it on his third try in 1990, defeating incumbent governor Edward D. DiPrete in a landslide victory 74%–26%, the largest majority for any Rhode Island governor at the time. He won reelection in 1992, but in 1994, he failed to win the Democratic primary against Myrth York, who was defeated in the general election. Rhode Island would not have another Democratic governor in office until former Republican Lincoln Chafee switched to the Democratic Party in 2013, having been elected as an Independent candidate in 2010.

Only one hour after Sundlun&#x27;s inauguration as governor on January 1, 1991, he announced the closure of 45 banks and credit unions in the state due to the collapse of their private insurer, the Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Corporation (RISDIC). Resolution of the crisis was through Sundlun&#x27;s creation of the Rhode Island Depositor&#x27;s Economic Protection Corporation (DEPCO) to manage the assets of closed banks and assure depositor repayment. Sundlun served as the chairman of the DEPCO board of directors and was primarily aided by his director of policy Sheldon Whitehouse. Despite considerable political resistance and the permanent closure of several institutions due to their failure to acquire Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or National Credit Union Administration insurance, all depositor funds were repaid in full, plus interest, after two and a half years.
During Sundlun&#x27;s two terms as governor, he took particular interest in expanding Rhode Island as a destination for conventions and tourism by championing the building of the Rhode Island Convention Center. Later, noting that a shortage of hotels in Providence hindered the city&#x27;s development as a convention destination, he urged the Rhode Island Convention Center Authority to facilitate the building of a hotel that eventually became The Westin Providence. He created the Rhode Island Airport Corporation as an entity to revitalize and operate Rhode Island&#x27;s state airports, and he was responsible for a complete redesign and rebuild of the passenger terminal and airport approach roads at T. F. Green Airport in Warwick. In 1992, he aided in the establishment of the Quonset Air Museum at the Quonset State Airport in North Kingstown. He was also responsible for building the Jamestown Verrazzano Bridge, and the Jamestown Expressway, as well as arranging the financing of Providence Place Mall, and the relocation of the Woonasquatucket River to permit the construction of Waterplace Park and the Citizens Bank Building in downtown Providence. The Bruce Sundlun Terminal at T.F. Green Airport is named in his honor, and the airport now generates over $2 billion in economic activity annually. He was the last Rhode Island governor to be elected to a two-year term, as his successor, Lincoln Almond was the first governor to be elected to a four-year term, which Rhode Island enacted in 1994.

Sundlun served as a co-chairman of the inaugural parade committee for President John F. Kennedy in 1960 and 1961, and was appointed by President Kennedy in October 1962 as an incorporating member of the Communications Satellite Corporation (COMSAT), where he served for 30 years as a director. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter appointed him as a member of the Board of Visitors of the United States Air Force Academy where he served two four-year terms, and that same year, he was appointed by Governor Garrahy as a Rhode Island Commodore. He served a four-year term as a director of the National Security Education Board, appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1993.

Sundlun was a delegate to Democratic National Convention in 1964, 1968, 1980, 1988, and 2000, as well as to the Rhode Island Constitutional Convention of 1985. He was a member of the Providence School Board from 1984 to 1990. And from 1995 until his death, Sundlun had been teaching political science and Rhode Island history at the University of Rhode Island as &quot;Governor in Residence&quot;.

==Personal life==
From the 1970s to the late 1980s, Sundlun maintained a residence at &quot;Salamander Farm&quot;, a estate in The Plains, Virginia, which he named after his wartime identity with the French Underground. From 2004 until his death in 2011, he lived in Jamestown, Rhode Island, with his fifth wife, Susan, a professional photographer and owner of East Greenwich Photo.

Sundlun was married five times and had four children. He was the father of WFSB news anchor Kara (Hewes) Sundlun and father-in-law to Dennis House. He admitted paternity after Hewes filed suit in 1993 alleging that Sundlun had fathered her in a relationship with her mother, Judith Vargo, a.k.a. Judith Hewes. During the initial stages of the suit, Sundlun said that a payment to Judith Hewes of $35,000 in 1976 and Kara&#x27;s adoption by Robert Hewes in the late 1970s had fully absolved him of financial responsibility in the matter. However, Sundlun accepted Kara Hewes fully as his daughter assuring that her college education was fully financed. Kara has two children (Helena and Julian) by her husband, WTNH news anchor Dennis House.

Sundlun also had three sons from his first marriage (to Madeleine Schiffer Gimbel): 
*Tracy Walter Sundlun, vice president of Competitor Group, a promoter and manager of marathon races who at 17 coached track at the 1972 Olympic Games and was the youngest ever Olympic coach; Tracy has a daughter, Felicity.
*Stuart Arthur Sundlun, a financial services executive on several corporate boards of directors, managing the New York operations of Triago and vice chairman of the BMB Group;
*Peter Bruce Sundlun, a commercial airline pilot with Dominion Aviation Services and Atlantic Southeast Airlines until 2009, becoming a Transportation Security Officer with the Transportation Security Administration. Peter has a son, Hunter.

Sundlun died on July 21, 2011, aged 91, at his home in Jamestown, Rhode Island. He was accorded full state and military honors prior to and at his funeral and burial on July 24, 2011. He was buried at Temple Beth El Cemetery in Providence, Rhode Island.

==Media reports and popular controversy==
In July 1993, when he thought three raccoons on his estate in Newport were rabid, Sundlun shot at them with a 12-gauge shotgun. Later the &quot;Providence Journal-Bulletin&quot; reported that the act was illegal according to state fish and game laws. The day of the publication, Sundlun turned himself in to the state police for arrest stating that ethics was the cornerstone of his administration. The state police reluctantly complied, so the case went to court and Sundlun pleaded guilty. But state officials and his own lawyer, Robert Flanders, convinced Sundlun that his actions were not a crime because his estate did not constitute a &quot;compact area&quot; and because the threat of rabies that year had led the state to waive restrictions on shooting raccoons. His guilty plea was withdrawn and all charges were dropped.

After the raccoon shooting incident, Sundlun agreed to pose for a calendar photo for local charity wearing only a raccoon hat while aiming a shotgun and displaying his 8th Air Force tattoo on his shoulder, and he occasionally showed up at downtown eateries in the middle of the night in pajamas and bathrobe to pick up coffee and a late-night snack.

In December 1997, in East Greenwich, Sundlun attempted to purchase some plastic forks after hours from a nearby CVS Pharmacy for a Christmas party he was attending. Employees had closed their registers for the day, yet had not secured the premises. CVS workers apologized for the misunderstanding but said they could not accept payment as the transaction could not be registered due to deactivation of their cash registers. Police were called after an argument let out between Sundlun and the employees. Sundlun eventually issued an apology to the employees and the pharmacy chain for his actions.

On February 24, 2009, Sundlun was involved in a dispute over his place in line at a branch of Citizens Bank in East Greenwich. Sundlun was pushed to the ground by Charles Machado, 59, of Warwick. Sundlun hit his head and was stunned, but he declined to press charges against Machado.

In his later years, Sundlun had been involved in some traffic accidents and traffic violations, which led two Rhode Island police departments, North Kingstown in 2007 and Jamestown in 2009, to convince the state Department of Motor Vehicles to evaluate Sundlun&#x27;s ability to drive. In 2008, he was admonished by authorities of University of Rhode Island about his driving on the campus after separate incidents in which he drove on a sidewalk, nearly hit a professor who was walking with a cane, and allegedly hit a parked car. Sundlun passed the first driving test which was the result of the North Kingstown request. On April 30, 2009, Sundlun voluntarily surrendered his license.

On June 4, 2009, Sundlun was on a WPRO radio talk show in which he claimed that he flew a private plane owned by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur Votolato, 79, from T.F. Green Airport to Hartford, Connecticut. Within days, Judge Votolato and Sundlun had issued a statement that the judge was in fact in full control of the aircraft. While Votolato&#x27;s pilot&#x27;s license had been maintained up to date, Sundlun&#x27;s commercial pilot&#x27;s license had expired in the late 1970s.

<text>Sun Yun-suan (; 10 November 1913 – 15 February 2006) was a Taiwanese engineer and politician. As minister of economic affairs from 1969 to 1978 and Premier of the Republic of China from 1978 to 1984, he was credited for overseeing the export-driven industrialization of Taiwan.

==Early life and engineering career==

Born in Penglai, Shandong, he earned his Bachelor of Electrical Engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology in 1934. From 1937 to 1940 he was an engineer at the National Resources Commission and worked at a government-run power station in Qinghai province, he earned fame and respect throughout China for disassembling and then transporting an electrical/power boiler, into Kuomintang territory in order to prevent the expensive equipment from falling into enemy Japanese hands. During World War II (from 1937 to 1945), he was sent by the National Resources Commission to train in the United States as an engineer at the Tennessee Valley Authority.

In 1946, he was sent to Taiwan (which had just been handed over to the Nationalist Government from Japan following the Allied victory in World War II) to work at the Taiwan Power Company, a public utility. Managing a staff of several hundred, Sun was able to get 80% of the power network in Taiwan (destroyed during the war) restored in five months. At Taiwan Power Company, he was Head Engineer of the Electrical and Mechanical Department from 1946 to 1950, Chief Engineer from 1950 to 1962, and Vice President from 1953 to 1962.

Due to his successes in Taiwan, the World Bank sent him to Nigeria as head of the Electricity Corporation of Nigeria in 1964, which he served as CEO and General Manager until 1967. He increased Nigeria&#x27;s power supply by 88%.

==Government career==
He returned to Taiwan and joined the ROC government as Minister of Communications in 1967. In 1969, he was transferred to become Minister of Economic Affairs and served until 30 May 1978 when he was promoted to Premier of the Republic of China.

He is credited as one of the chief architects of Taiwan&#x27;s &quot;economic miracle&quot; that led Taiwan to become one of the East Asian Tigers. It was during Sun&#x27;s premiership the Ten Infrastructure Projects, including the Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, the Number 1 Nuclear Power Plant, and the Sun Yat-sen National Expressway, were completed. Sun championed the establishment of high-technology industries that would later become the basis of the Taiwanese economy. He initiated the development of the Industrial Technology Research Institute (that would later give rise to numerous major semiconductor companies such as TSMC) and the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park which would serve as a major electronics and semiconductor manufacturing hub. Sun is also credited for transforming Taiwan&#x27;s existing export industries, which were developed in the 1960s and centered on textiles, shoes, plastic toys, and agriculture, to the more sustainable fields of petrochemicals, machine tools, and electronics.

==Later life==
Sun was once regarded as heir apparent to Chiang Ching-kuo, but he suffered a stroke during a legislative interpellation session in 1984, ending his political career. Instead, Lee Teng-hui became Chiang&#x27;s heir apparent and ultimate successor. Sun resigned as premier on 20 May 1984 and was appointed to the largely honorary position of senior advisor to the President of the Republic of China.

After his stroke, Sun became a major advocate of health issues such as the importance of monitoring high blood pressure for elderly people. He also campaigned against smoking.

Another stroke left him needing to use a wheelchair for mobility. Nevertheless, Sun remained politically active in his later years and campaigned on behalf of KMT presidential candidate Lien Chan in the 2004 presidential election.

He died at the age of 92 while hospitalized at the Veterans General Hospital in Taipei as a result of myocardial infarction and sepsis. Sun was accorded the honour of a State funeral due to his tremendous contributions and hard work and determination for Taiwan, which was held on February 25. Then-DPP President Chen Shui-bian also attended his funeral. Sun’s ashes were interred at the Keelung Hsin Hsin Cemetery.

<text>Henry Hammill Fowler (September 5, 1908 January 3, 2000) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Lyndon B. Johnson.

Born in Roanoke, Virginia, in 1908, Fowler graduated from Roanoke College and later earned his law degree from Yale Law School. After working briefly at Covington &amp; Burling in Washington, D.C., Fowler joined the legal staff of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in 1934, where he helped establish the constitutionality of the program. He went on to serve in various government positions, including Assistant General Counsel of the Office of Production Management and Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization. After leaving government service, Fowler returned to private law practice, and later became a partner at Goldman Sachs.

Fowler died of pneumonia in Alexandria, Virginia, in 2000 at the age of 91.

==Early life and career==
Fowler was born in Roanoke, Virginia, on September 5, 1908. He was the son of Mack Johnson Fowler, a locomotive engineer, and his wife, the former Bertha (&quot;née&quot; Browning). Henry Fowler graduated from Jefferson High School in 1925 and went on to graduate from Roanoke College in 1929, where he joined Pi Kappa Phi, played many sports, and edited the college newspaper. He received his law degree from Yale Law School in 1933.

He worked briefly at Covington &amp; Burling in Washington, D.C., then joined the legal staff of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in 1934. There he assisted in the preparation and successful conduct of the four-year litigation establishing the constitutionality of that program. By 1939, he had risen to Assistant General Counsel of the TVA and subsequently served as chief counsel of a subcommittee of the U.S. Senate Committee on Education and Labor.

On October 19, 1938, Fowler married Trudye Pamela Hathcote (1910–2008). They had one son and two daughters: Henry Hammill, Jr., Marianne Fowler Smith and Susan Fowler-Gallagher.

Fowler and his family sponsored a public policy program at Roanoke College that has brought guests such as Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor to speak to College students and members of the community.

==Wartime role==
From 1941 to 1944, he was an assistant general counsel of the Office of Production Management and afterward of the War Production Board. He then served in the United Kingdom and Germany in 1944 and 1945. He returned to private practice and in 1951 rejoined the government to work on the mobilization of troops during the Korean War. During this period he was an administrator of the National Production Authority, administrator of the Defense Production Administration, Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization and member of the National Security Council.

==Post-war career==
With the onset of the Eisenhower administration, Fowler returned to his private law practice and served on the Democratic Advisory Council, which helped outline party positions on many issues. Fowler served as a member of the Commission on Money and Credit from 1958 to 1961, and of the National Committee on Government Finance of the Brookings Institution from 1960 to 1961. He was a Trustee of Roanoke College and of the Funds in the Episcopal Diocese of Virginia.

He served as the Under Secretary of the Treasury, from February 3, 1961, until April 10, 1964. He spent was the most of his time at Treasury working on passage of the administration&#x27;s tax program, which included an $11.5 billion tax cut. He then he returned to private law practice as senior member of the Washington firm of Fowler, Leva, Hawes and Symington. When C. Douglas Dillon resigned, Fowler served as Secretary of the Treasury from April 1, 1965, to December 20, 1968, Fowler was known for his loyalty to Johnson throughout the administration&#x27;s ups and downs. He was described as having &quot;a ruddy face, southern charm and a conservative outlook&quot;.

The major problems facing Fowler were inflation and the balance of payments deficit. In August 1967, Fowler began the fight for a 10 percent tax surcharge and saw the proposal passed by a House–Senate conference in June 1968. In the debate over the balance of payments deficit, Fowler was a proponent of the &quot;go-slow&quot; approach. Fowler organized a two-tier system for gold in 1968, and participated in the 1967–68 international agreements, which created a new international monetary reserve system called &quot;special drawing rights&quot;. He proposed (1967) a seminar (taken up by then Chancellor of the Exchequer James Callaghan) of financial officials from rich countries, the forerunner of the Group of Five. He also ended silver coinage in the United States.
After leaving the Treasury Department, Fowler became a partner with Goldman Sachs in New York City, New York.

==Death==

Fowler died of pneumonia in Alexandria, Virginia, on January 3, 2000, at the age of 91. He was buried in Christ Church Cemetery in Alexandria. His wife of 61 years died at age 97 on January 22, 2008, in her Alexandria home.

<doc id="807658" wikidata="Q7287953" url="?curid=807658" title="Ralph Perk">
<text>Ralph Joseph Perk (January 19, 1914 – April 21, 1999) was an American politician who served as the 52nd mayor of Cleveland, Ohio from 1971 to 1977.

==Early life==
Born to an ethnic Czech American family in Cleveland, Perk dropped out of high school at 15 and later took correspondence courses to earn his high-school diploma. He studied history, political science and mathematics at the Cleveland College of Case Western Reserve University and St. John&#x27;s College in Cleveland. During the Great Depression he worked as a patternmaker, then worked with his brother George in running the Perk Coal and Ice Company. He went on to work in real estate, but returned to patternmaking during World War II to aid in the war effort, after the military rejected him due to earlier health problems resulting from kidney stones. Perk then moved into politics, becoming a precinct committeeman for Cleveland&#x27;s Republican Party in 1940 and then assuming the leadership of the Southeast Air Pollution Committee tasked with fighting industrial pollution in the Flats.

==Political career==
Beginning in 1953, Perk was elected to five two-year terms on Cleveland City Council from the city&#x27;s Ward 13, representing his native Broadway–Slavic Village neighborhood. During his service on Council, Perk founded the American Nationalities Movement, an umbrella agency for 35 nationality groups. In 1962, he was elected auditor of Cuyahoga County, the first Republican to win countywide office since the mid-1930s; he was re-elected in 1966 and 1970. In 1965 and 1969, Perk ran for mayor of Cleveland and was defeated both times in the general election. In 1971, Perk won the Republican nomination for mayor for the third time. He defeated future mayor, governor, and U.S. Senator George Voinovich, then a member of the Ohio House of Representatives, in the primary. Perk went on to win the general election, &quot;propelled into office by a heavy ethnic [Eastern European] vote.&quot; He became the first Republican to serve as mayor of Cleveland since the 1940s, and proceeded to make future mayoral elections nonpartisan. He was reelected in 1973 and 1975.

===Mayoralty===
As mayor, Perk benefited from his good connections with President Richard Nixon, allowing Cleveland to obtain federal funds to aid neighborhoods and to help crack down on city crime in the era of Irish American mobster Danny Greene. He also greatly expanded Cleveland&#x27;s international ties by initiating several sister city partnerships.

It was Perk who also recommended that the Cleveland Division of Police move to the Justice Center after years of battles between Cuyahoga County and the City of Cleveland. In 1973, Mayor Perk and his Akron Counterpart met and proposed building Project CAIA-or Cleveland Akron International Airport on in Richfield, Ohio. Had the CAIA been built, CAIA would have rivaled New York&#x27;s JFK International Airport, or Chicago&#x27;s O&#x27;Hare International and made Cleveland Hopkins International Airport akin to Chicago&#x27;s Midway Airport. The plan was opposed by environmentalists, who petitioned the federal government to create the Cuyahoga Valley National Park in 1974. In 1974, Mayor Perk also proposed merging the CTS-or Cleveland Transit System with suburban transit systems. In 1975, voters passed a 1% sales tax to create the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority, know locally as RTA.

In 1972, three years after the Cuyahoga River fire and Mayor Stokes&#x27;s efforts to clean it up, Perk formed the NEORSD-or the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District. In December 1970 a federal grand jury investigation led by U.S. Attorney Robert Jones, the first grand jury investigation of water pollution in the area, led to Jones filing multiple lawsuits against the polluters (about 12 companies in Northeast Ohio). After leaving the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s office for an unsuccessful run for County Prosecutor in 1972, Jones was brought in to the Cleveland Legal Department to assist with NEORSD matters.

In 1974, Perk won the Republican nomination for the United States Senate seat formerly held by William B. Saxbe, who had resigned to accept the appointment to the office of United States Attorney General. Perk, however, was defeated soundly by Democrat John Herschel Glenn, Jr. Perk had stated that he was counting on running against the incumbent senator, Howard M. Metzenbaum, who had been recently appointed to the seat by then Governor John J. Gilligan. Metzenbaum lost the primary to Glenn. Subsequently, in 1977, Perk suffered an upset defeat in the non-partisan primary for mayor, finishing third behind Dennis Kucinich, a former political ally, and Edward F. Feighan. Kucinich prevailed over Feighan in the general election, setting the stage for his subsequent mayoralty.

===Gaffes===
As mayor, Perk was also known for his many political gaffes. On October 16, 1972, he accidentally set his hair on fire when he attempted to use a welder&#x27;s torch for a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the American Society for Metals at the Cleveland Convention Center. A spark from the torch had &quot;hit his head and his hair caught fire thanks to a product that a barber put in it earlier in the day.&quot; The mayor later jested, &quot;There are more hazards to this job than I expected.&quot; For this, the media proclaimed Perk to be the &quot;hottest mayor in the country&quot; and even Cleveland native Bob Hope joked about the incident.

In another incident, Perk&#x27;s wife, Lucille, famously rejected an invitation from First Lady Pat Nixon to an event at the White House in order to attend her regular bowling night. Later, Perk explained his wife&#x27;s comment to mean that she was unable to attend because the invitation had come too late and she was unable to prepare for travel. Perk was rumored to say, &quot;tell them it&#x27;s your bowling night.&quot; Though the remark brought howls of laughter throughout the city, it endeared the Perks to their ethnic Eastern European voter base. In yet another gaffe, Perk suggested that a study on pornography ought to be conducted by municipal sanitation workers.

===Controversy===

Perk also appointed Richard Eberling in 1973 to chair a committee to redecorate the mayor&#x27;s office in City Hall, a move that proved unpopular with numerous sources. In 1974, &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; exposed Eberling&#x27;s record as a petty criminal in a front-page story; Perk defended Eberling, and approved the financing of project until the amount significantly over-reached the budgeted amount. Eberling&#x27;s lover, Obie Henderson was hired as Perk&#x27;s personal secretary. Eberling was later found guilty in the death of Ethel M. Durkin, a Cleveland area widow; he also linked himself to the Marilyn Sheppard murder in Bay Village, in 1954. Circumstantial evidence also links Eberling to at least four other murders committed over a period from 1946 to 1970 that involved his stepfather, his purported girlfriend, and both of Mrs. Durkin&#x27;s sisters.

==Personal life==
Perk and his wife had six sons and a daughter. His son, Ralph J. Perk, Jr., served as a municipal court judge in Cleveland from 1989 to 2003. Another son, Thomas Perk, is a council member in the village of Valley View in addition to being a fire fighter. Yet another son, Kenneth Perk, is a member of the Cuyahoga Heights Board of Education. His second-youngest son, Allen G. Perk, is the President and CEO of XLNsystems Inc. in Columbus, Ohio.

Perk was diagnosed with prostate cancer in the 1990s, and underwent treatments for the disease. The treatment was thought to have been successful, but in early 1998 Perk and his family learned that the cancer had not only returned but had spread. Perk&#x27;s children spent a year caring for their father at home. Five days before his death, Perk was admitted to the Corinthian Skilled Nursing Center in Westlake, Ohio. He died there on April 21, 1999. He was buried at in Brook Park, Ohio.

<doc id="807662" wikidata="Q4584995" url="?curid=807662" title="1988–89 United States network television schedule">
<text>The 1988–89 network television schedule for the four major English language commercial broadcast networks in the United States covers primetime hours from September 1988 through August 1989. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series cancelled after the 1987–88 season.

PBS is not included; member stations have local flexibility over most of their schedules and broadcast times for network shows may vary.

New series are highlighted in bold.

All times are U.S. Eastern Time and Pacific Time (except for some live sports or events). Subtract one hour for Central, Mountain, Alaska and Hawaii–Aleutian times.

Each of the 30 highest-rated shows is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.

==Writers&#x27; strike impact==

The 1988 Writers Guild of America strike lasted between March 7 and August 7. During the strike, production on scripted television series across all of the major television networks was suspended. The writers&#x27; strike forced the networks to postpone the start of the fall 1988 schedule later than usual; rather than the traditional late-September/early-October start, new and returning series had their premieres delayed until late October and into November. In the interim, the networks had to rely on a hodgepodge of programming, including reruns, films, entertainment and news specials, program-length political advertising, and unscripted original series (e.g. CBS&#x27; &quot;High Risk&quot;); NBC and ABC also benefited from sports programming (NBC relied on the Summer Olympics in September and the World Series in October, while ABC had postseason baseball coverage and moved up the start time for the early weeks of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; from 9 p.m. ET to 8 p.m. ET to replace &quot;MacGyver&quot;, which was not yet ready with new episodes at the time). Even though previous strikes of Hollywood employees occurred in 1980 and 1981, those strikes only had a minor effect on the production of television programs that aired in the 1980–81 and 1981–82 seasons. The 1988–89 television season was thus the first of four television seasons to have its start delayed due to issues outside of the control of the major networks; further instances occurred in the 2001–02 season (due to the networks&#x27; news coverage of the September 11 attacks), the 2020–21 season (due to the suspension of television productions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), and the 2023–24 season (due to the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes).

Notes:
*Quantum Leap had a two-hour premiere Sunday, March 26, 1989, on NBC.
*The Jim Henson Hour briefly replaced The Magical World of Disney on May 14, 1989, and again between July 9-July 30.
*On ABC, A Fine Romance was supposed to air 8-9 p.m., but production delays amidst the strike forced the move to Thursdays.

==Saturday==
Note: On CBS, &quot;Frank&#x27;s Place&quot; consisted of reruns of the 1987-88 sitcom. On ABC, &quot;ABC Saturday Mystery Movie&quot; was supposed to air 9-11 p.m., but production delays amidst the strike force the move to Mondays.

<doc id="807667" wikidata="Q35833" url="?curid=807667" title="Ladakhi language">
<text>The Ladakhi language is a Tibetic language spoken in the Indian union territory of Ladakh. It is the predominant language in the Buddhist-dominated district of Leh, and a minority language in the district of Kargil. Though a member of the Tibetic family, Ladakhi is not mutually intelligible with Standard Tibetan. Ladakhis and Tibetans usually communicate with each other in Hindi or English as they do not understand each other&#x27;s languages clearly.

Ladakhi has several dialects: Lehskat, named after Leh where it is spoken, Shamskat, spoken northwest of Leh, Stotskat, spoken in the Indus valley and which unlike the others is tonal, Nubra, spoken north of Leh, the Changthang language, spoken in the Changtang region by the Changpa people, and the Zangskari language, spoken in the Zanskar region of Ladakh.

== Name ==
The Ladakhi language () is also referred to as Bhoti or Bodhi. Supporters of the Bhoti name hold a &quot;lumper&quot; view of the language: they use the term &quot;Bhoti&quot; to refer to Classical Tibetan and treat as the one, proper form of Tibetic languages across the Himalayas. This section of Ladakhi society has demanded inclusion Bhoti to the 8th Schedule of the Indian Constitution. They say that Bhoti is spoken by Ladakhis, Baltis, Tibetans, and throughout the Himalayas from Baltistan to Arunachal Pradesh.

No other Tibetic-speaking group in India has agreed to the classification, instead adopting their own names for their languages for legal recognition: Bhutia, Lepcha and Limboo. In addition, an 2008–2009 survey by Central Institute of Indian Languages found only a negligible number of Leh families calling their mother tongue &quot;Bhoti&quot;.

The name Bhoti or Bodhi has connotations with Tibetan Buddhism, a major religion in the area. Many Ladakhi people contest this classification as there are also Muslim, Christian, Hindu and Sikh speakers of Ladakhi.

== Dialects ==
Ladakhi has several dialects:
1 :Lehskat, named after Leh where it is spoken.
2: Shamskat, spoken northwest of Leh in the sham region of ladakh.
3 :Stotskat, spoken in the upper Indus valley of ladakh and which unlike the others is tonal.
4 :Nubraskat , spoken north of Leh in the nubra region of Ladakh.
5 :The Changthang language, spoken in the Changtang region by the Changpa people .
6: The Zangskari language, spoken in the Zanskar region of Ladakh.

==Classification==
Nicolas Tournadre considers Ladakhi, Balti, and Purgi to be distinct languages on the basis of mutual intelligibility (Zangskari is not as distinct). As a group they are termed Ladakhi–Balti or Western Archaic Tibetan.

Zangskari is a dialect of Ladakhi spoken in Zanskar and also spoken by Buddhists in the upper reaches of Lahaul (Himachal Pradesh) and Paddar (Paldar).
It has four subdialects, Stod, Zhung, Sham, and Lungna. It is written using the Tibetan script by Buddhists and the Arabic script by Muslim and Christian Ladakhis.

==Phonology==
=== Consonants ===
* can fricative sounds as allophones that occur within free variation.
* has an allophone of a retracted velar stop .
* can have allophones when occurring initially before a voiceless consonant.

=== Vowels ===
Ladakhi has a regular five vowel system, but with being replaced with , making it unusual, as most languages have .


* Allophones of in word-final position are heard as .
*Allophones of are heard as .
*Allophones occur in free variation.

==Script==
Ladakhi is usually written using Tibetan script, and the pronunciation of Ladakhi is much closer to written Classical Tibetan than that of most other Tibetic languages. Ladakhis pronounce many of the prefix, suffix and head letters that are silent in many other Tibetic languages, in particular the Central Tibetan. This tendency is more pronounced to the west of Leh, and on the Pakistani side of the Line of Control, in Baltistan. For example, a Tibetan would pronounce &quot;sta&quot; (&#x27;axe&#x27;) as [tá], but a Lehpa would say [sta], and a Purgi would pronounce [stare]. While a Tibetan would pronounce འབྲས་ &quot;’bras&quot; (&#x27;rice&#x27;) as [ɳʈɛ́ʔ], Lehpa say [ɖas], and the Purgi pronounce it as [bras]. Although the pronunciation is relatively conservative, the Ladakhi language has accumulated significant grammatical differences from the classical, written language.

The question of whether to write colloquial Ladakhi (&quot;phalskat&quot;) in the Tibetan script or to write an only slightly Ladakhified version of Classical Tibetan (&quot;choskat&quot;) is controversial in Ladakh. Muslim Ladakhis speak Ladakhi but most do not read the Tibetan script. Most Buddhist Ladakhis can sound out the Tibetan script but do not understand Classical Tibetan, yet many Ladakhi Buddhist scholars insist that Ladakhi must be written only in a form of Classical Tibetan, seeing the vernacular-based orthography only as deviation from the &quot;proper&quot; language. A limited number of books and magazines have been published in colloquial Ladakhi, one example being &quot;Ladags Melong&quot; from SECMOL.

In Ladakhi language, it is customary to add the suffix &#x27;le&#x27; at the end of sentences as a sign of respect towards the individual being spoken to. This linguistic convention is a way to express politeness and honor towards the listener, emphasizing the cultural values of respect and courtesy.

Written Ladakhi is most often romanised using modified Wylie transliteration, with &quot;th&quot; denoting an aspirated dental &quot;t&quot;, for example.

<text>Lexin is an online Swedish and Norwegian lexicon that can translate between Swedish or Norwegian and a number of other languages. Its original use was to help immigrants translate between their native languages and Swedish, but at least the English-Swedish-English lexicons are so complete that many Swedes use them for everyday use.

The dictionary is a collaboration between the Institute for Language and Folklore and the Royal Institute of Technology.

<doc id="807687" wikidata="Q1161370" url="?curid=807687" title="Gable">
<text>A gable is the generally triangular portion of a wall between the edges of intersecting roof pitches. The shape of the gable and how it is detailed depends on the structural system used, which reflects climate, material availability, and aesthetic concerns. The term gable wall or gable end more commonly refers to the entire wall, including the gable and the wall below it. Some types of roof do not have a gable (for example hip roofs do not). One common type of roof with gables, the &#x27;gable roof&#x27;, is named after its prominent gables.

A parapet made of a series of curves (shaped gable, see also Dutch gable) or horizontal steps (crow-stepped gable) may hide the diagonal lines of the roof.

Gable ends of more recent buildings are often treated in the same way as the Classic pediment form. But unlike Classical structures, which operate through trabeation, the gable ends of many buildings are actually bearing-wall structures.

Gable style is also used in the design of fabric structures, with varying degree sloped roofs, dependent on how much snowfall is expected.

Sharp gable roofs are a characteristic of the Gothic and classical Greek styles of architecture.

The opposite or inverted form of a gable roof is a V-roof or butterfly roof.

==Front-gabled and side-gabled==
While a front-gabled or gable-fronted building faces the street with its gable, a side-gabled building faces it with its (gutter), meaning the ridge is parallel to the street. The terms are used in architecture and city planning to determine a building in its urban situation.

Front-gabled buildings are considered typical for German city streets in the Gothic period, while later Renaissance buildings, influenced by Italian architecture, are often side-gabled. In America, front-gabled houses, such as the gablefront house, were popular between the early 19th century and 1920.

==Wimperg==

A &quot;Wimperg&quot;, in German and Dutch, is a Gothic ornamental gable with tracery over windows or portals, which were often accompanied by pinnacles. It was a typical element in Gothic architecture, especially in cathedral architecture. Wimpergs often had crockets or other decorative elements in the Gothic style. The intention behind the wimperg was the perception of increased height.

==Drawbacks==
The gable end roof is a poor design for hurricane or tornado-prone regions. Winds blowing against the gable end can exert tremendous pressure, both on the gable and on the roof edges where they overhang it, causing the roof to peel off and the gable to cave in.

==In popular culture==
* &quot;The Seven Lamps of Architecture&quot;, an 1849 essay. It gives John Ruskin&#x27;s opinion on truth in architecture
* &quot;The House of the Seven Gables&quot;, an 1851 novel by Nathaniel Hawthorne
* &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;, a 1908 novel by Canadian author Lucy Maud Montgomery, set in Canada
* &quot;The Adventure of the Three Gables&quot;, a 1926 story by Arthur Conan Doyle.

<text>The Latvian Football Federation ( ; LFF ) is the governing body of football in Latvia with its headquarters located in the Rimi Sports Centre in Riga. Its activities include the organizing of the Latvian football championship (Optibet Virslīga), the Latvian First League, the Latvian Second League, as well as lower league championships and the Latvian Football Cup. The federation also manages the Latvia national football team and Latvia women&#x27;s national football team.

== 1918—1940 ==
The LFF was established on 19 June 1921 as the Latvian Football Union () and was active until 1940 when it was closed down after the Soviet occupation of Latvia. A British national Harold Trevenen Hall was appointed the first chairman of the Latvian Football Union. In 1922, the Latvian Championship organized by Latvian Football Union consisted of 12 associations, 22 teams and 479 football players. A year earlier, rules of football were published in Latvian for the first time and in May 1923 Latvia was accepted into FIFA. Herberts Baumanis was the representative of Latvia in the acceptance ceremony in France. In 1925, the Latvian Football Union established football unions in the regions of country and in 1927 the Virslīga top-level competition was launched. It consisted of three of the strongest teams from Riga and a club from Liepāja while others were playing in tournaments of their regions. This system was in place up until 1940, and the number of teams in the Virslīga grew to eight. The union was formally dissolved by the Soviet occupational authorities on 11 November 1940.

== From 1990 ==
LFF renewed its operations on 19 August 1990 under its current name right after Latvia regained independence. Its membership in FIFA was restored in 1992 and in the same year it joined UEFA.

In 2015, the federation had a staff of 47 people, with the top post being the President of the LFF. Daily affairs of the LFF are managed by its General Secretary, Edgars Pukinsks.

On 27 April 2018, the long-time LFF president Guntis Indriksons left his position after 22 years in office, becoming Honorary President of the LFF in an advisory role. The General Secretary since 1993, Jānis Mežeckis, also resigned in May and was replaced by Pukinsks. Former national team captain Kaspars Gorkšs was elected as his successor by the member organizations of the federation.

On 17 October 2019, after a continuing streak of poor international results by the Latvia national team and claims about poor management of the federation from a fraction of its members, an emergency congress with the goal of removing Gorkšs from the post was held, with a 65-vote majority needed for the motion to pass. In a close vote of 67 to 60 with two abstentions, Gorkšs was voted out of office. Earlier in 2019, there were a number of calls by a group of LFF members to remove Gorkšs from office, yet they all were unsuccessful. According to LFF rules, the next election of the body&#x27;s president was scheduled to take place in 2020.

Vadims Ļašenko was elected president of the Latvian Football Federation during the federation&#x27;s congress on 3 July 2020. 
96 delegates to the congress voted for Ļašenko, the president of the Latvian Futsal Association, while the other candidate, Interior Minister Sandis Ģirģens (KPV LV) was supported by 26 delegates. Six delegates abstained from voting.

<text>Run Devil Run is the eleventh solo studio album by Paul McCartney, released in 1999. It features mostly covers of both familiar and obscure 1950s rock and roll songs, along with three original McCartney compositions written in the same style, including the title track, making it the second McCartney covers album, after his Russian cover album. As his first project following first wife Linda&#x27;s death in 1998, McCartney felt the need to get back to his roots and perform some of the music he loved as a teenager. On 14 December 1999, McCartney returned to the Cavern Club stage to play a set publicising the new album.

==Background==
Following the death of his wife Linda McCartney in April 1998, Paul McCartney had a year of mourning. Wanting to keep things fresh, a lesson he had learned from his experiences working on &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot; project and put to use on &quot;Flaming Pie&quot;, McCartney planned to cut the album as quickly as possible, much in the way the Beatles had recorded in their early years. Asking Chris Thomas to help produce, McCartney booked time at Abbey Road Studios to undertake his quest.

==Music and lyrics==
The album consists of 12 cover versions of rock and roll songs and three McCartney originals. Of the covers, &quot;Blue Jean Bop&quot; was written and recorded by Gene Vincent in 1956. &quot;She Said Yeah&quot; had been recorded by Larry Williams. &quot;All Shook Up&quot;, &quot;I Got Stung&quot; and &quot;Party&quot; had been recorded by Elvis Presley. &quot;No Other Baby&quot; was written by Dickie Bishop and Bob Watson, and was originally recorded in 1958 by skiffle group the Vipers and released as a single. Despite never owning a copy of the song, it had made a big enough imprint on McCartney for him to record it 40 years on. &quot;Lonesome Town&quot; had been recorded by Ricky Nelson. &quot;Movie Magg&quot; had been recorded by Carl Perkins. Chuck Berry&#x27;s composition &quot;Brown Eyed Handsome Man&quot; had been recorded by him and by Buddy Holly whose version McCartney liked. &quot;Shake a Hand&quot; was written by Joe Morris and recorded by Little Richard in 1956 &quot;Coquette&quot; had been recorded by Fats Domino. &quot;Honey Hush&quot; had been first recorded by Joe Turner, though the liner notes state that McCartney was more familiar with the version by Johnny Burnette.

Of the originals &quot;Run Devil Run&quot; is a song in the Chuck Berry style, &quot;Try Not to Cry&quot; was recounting a widower&#x27;s suffering, and &quot;What It Is&quot; had been started a few months prior to Linda&#x27;s death.

==Recording and structure==

Wanting to work with reliable and empathetic musicians, McCartney called up Pink Floyd&#x27;s David Gilmour to play guitar. Also recruited were guitarist Mick Green, keyboardists Pete Wingfield and Geraint Watkins, and on drums Deep Purple&#x27;s Ian Paice and Dave Mattacks. McCartney played bass although he did play electric guitar in some instances. McCartney wanted the sessions to be laid back, with no post-production. McCartney had brought a list of material that he wished to play, the songs being early rock and roll songs from his childhood and a few originals he had written in a similar style. The initial sessions were a week in early March, with a few more sessions done in April and May, and then the album—featuring three new McCartney songs among the old classics—was complete. Thomas thought it a &quot;cathartic&quot; exercise for McCartney, calling it the &quot;this is for Linda album&quot;.

==Release==
Released on 4 October 1999 in the UK, and a day later in the US, reaching number 12 in the UK and number 27 in the US. The title &quot;Run Devil Run&quot; was inspired by Miller&#x27;s Rexall Drugs, a hoodoo and herbal medicine shop in South Downtown Atlanta with products by that very name. It appealed to McCartney as a great title for a rock and roll song, which he duly composed. The store was located at 87 Broad Street in Atlanta, Georgia.

To stimulate sales, a number of different bonus discs and singles were issued to accompany the album. Two special editions of &quot;Run Devil Run&quot; with limited-edition bonus discs were available only at certain retailers. A special limited edition of the album, sold only at Best Buy, featured a bonus interview disc. A similar special limited edition of the album, sold only at Musicland and Sam Goody stores, featured a four-track E.P. that contained the original artists&#x27; versions of four songs on the album: &quot;Blue Jean Bop&quot; by Gene Vincent &amp; His Blue Caps, &quot;Lonesome Town&quot; by Ricky Nelson, &quot;Coquette&quot; by Fats Domino, and &quot;Let&#x27;s Have a Party&quot; by Wanda Jackson. 
Also, in the UK, all fifteen songs on the album, along with &quot;Fabulous&quot;, were released on 25 December 1999, as set of eight 7-inch singles sold together in a &quot;Run Devil Run Limited Edition Collector&#x27;s Box&quot; designed to look like a record case from the 1950s.

&quot;No Other Baby&quot; was released as a 7&quot; vinyl single in the UK with two songs on the B-side, &quot;Brown Eyed Handsome Man&quot; and a non-album track &quot;Fabulous&quot;. In America, &quot;No Other Baby&quot; was released on a special juke-box single, with &quot;Try Not to Cry&quot; included as the B-side. &quot;No Other Baby&quot;, &quot;Brown Eyed Handsome Man&quot; and &quot;Fabulous&quot; were released together on two different CD singles, one of which contained stereo versions of the three songs and the other of which contained mono versions of the three songs. The music video for &quot;No Other Baby&quot;, which was filmed in black and white, highlights McCartney&#x27;s grief after Linda&#x27;s death.

McCartney filmed a performance at the Cavern Club as part of promotion for the album, on 14 December 1999. This performance was eventually released as a video &quot;Live at the Cavern Club&quot;.

==Reception==

On release, &quot;Run Devil Run&quot; received several highly favourable reviews. McCartney biographer Peter Ames Carlin said that despite the rock and roll songs being written by others, the album was &quot;the most deeply autobiographical album of Paul&#x27;s career&quot;. Rhapsody praised the work, calling it one of their favourite cover albums.

<text>Rafsanjan (; ) is a city in the Central District of Rafsanjan County, Kerman province, Iran, serving as capital of both the county and the district.

==Demographics==
===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the city&#x27;s population was 136,388 in 33,489 households. The following census in 2011 counted 151,420 people in 39,281 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 161,909 people in 47,013 households.

Rafsanjan is the biggest producer of pistachios in the world. The Sarcheshmeh copper mines are among the largest in the world. In addition, the biggest and oldest mud-house in the world is in Rafsanjan. The city is also a major center of carpet production, although the rugs are sold as Kermani rugs rather than Rafsanjani ones.

==Etymology== 
The origin of the name Rafsanjan is believed to have roots in Old Persian. According to one theory, the name is derived from the words &quot;Rafsan&quot; and &quot;Kan,&quot; which in Old Persian mean &quot;copper&quot; and &quot;mine,&quot; respectively. These two words gave rise to the original name of the city, &quot;Rafsangan,&quot; which later transformed into its current Arabic version, &quot;Rafsanjan.&quot;

Another theory suggests that the original name of the city was &quot;Sanjan.&quot; Due to its location in the path of floods, the city suffered significant destruction and was renamed &quot;Raft Sanjan&quot; and then &quot;Rafsanjan&quot; among the people. It changed from “Raf” to “Raft”; adding a letter changes the meaning of the word in Farsi to “sweeping”, signifying the damage of the grand rapids. According to a legend, the city was renamed &quot;Rafsanjan&quot; after a massive rapid occurred in the area, resulting in the change from &quot;Sanjan&quot; to &quot;Rafsanjan.&quot;

==History==

About the origin and creation of this city there are significant rhetorical stories. At the period of Qajar kingdom and under Naser-Aldin-Shah&#x27;s reign, Rafsanjan was named az “Anas” and was part of Fars province; after a while it came under the control of Kerman’s government. In the history, Rafsanjan has been named as an important city due to being on the crossroad between Kerman and Yazd. At the end of Safavieh kingdom, Afghans attacked this city and caused disaster and catastrophe. The low rate of prosperity after mentioned attack was stretched until Qajar’s kingdom and the city was almost ruined until that time. In 1787, Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar attacked the city and people decided to acquiesce in order to end the war, so he conquered the city without violence. In 1866, Ebrahim Khan Zahiradole (the
governor of Kerman) ordered to reshape and rebuild the city. Buildings were constructed and the situation started to improve. In 1913, Amir Mofkhem Bakhtiari ordered to build a strong wall around the city which part of ruins still remain today. This step caused importance and accredit to the city. For the first time in 1938, crossroads were built in the city, which are named as Emam Khomeyni, Enghelab, and Shohada these days.
Rafsanjan was also an important city due to high production of cotton earlier on time. Because of the high quality of this product, it was exported to India and Russia. In 1945, Rafsanjan was assigned as a 
township. Nowadays, Rafsanjan is considered as a of the most crowded cities of Kerman with major industries, oil depots, and agricultural mega-farms that have an undeniable role in the economy of province and country. Such mineral and agricultural products are well-known not only in Iran, but all around the world.

==Geography==
Rafsanjan is located in south part of the Lut desert, in north-west of Kerman province. The longitude of this city is 56 degrees east and the latitude is 30 degrees south. The Average distance between Kerman and this city is . The city has an airport and railway (Tehran-Bandar Abbas route). Moreover, the altitude is and the land-measurement is approximately . North part of Rafsanjan has a common frontier with Bafgh and Zarand; south part is neighboring with Bardsir and on west side with Anar and Shahre-Babak; finally east side of this city is neighboring with Kerman and Zarand. Rafsanjan has two seasonal rivers named as Shour and Giouderi. The mountains in the area are part of Zagros range, and Sarcheshmeh and Davaran are the most famous.

===Climate===

Rafsanjan has cold and freezing winters as well as hot and dried summers. This city is located in the central part of Iran and this region is desert. The weather is hot in summer and cold in winter, days are warm and nights are cold in general. The average amount of rainfall is annually.

=== Environment ===
Rafsanjan has been exposed to the polluting smoke of Sarcheshme, Khatunabad and Shahrbabak copper smelters. On the other hand, up to 14 pistachio orchards are sprayed every year, as a result, dozens of tons of poison are released in the pistachio orchards of Rafsanjan. The level of arsenic contamination in Rafsanjan water is about ten times the permissible limit, and it is strongly recommended to use authorized water purification devices for drinking water, and to ensure the health of the water purification device, the water produced by the device should also be tested.

===Flora and fauna===
Wild plantations and trees include common fig and almonds. Wild animals which are living in mountainous areas are goats, ewes, gazelles, wolves, hyenas, wildcats and some species of birds like pigeons, eagles and partridges.

==Pistachio industry==
Rafsanjan, a semiarid region in central Iran, is renowned for its high-quality pistachio production, generating nearly $1 billion annually. The Iranian government has provided energy and water subsidies over the past several decades, attracting producers to the area, where more than 30,000 people are directly involved in the production by owning or managing pistachio orchards.
However, economically viable pistachio production requires specific climatic conditions, such as long, hot summers and sufficient chill in winters, which occur in areas far from surface water resources like rivers or lakes, making the crop water-intensive. As a result, pistachio producers in Rafsanjan have long relied on groundwater as the only source of water for irrigation.

According to reports from the late 1980s, the Rafsanjani family is said to &quot;control&quot; Iran&#x27;s multimillion-dollar pistachio market centered around the town of Rafsanjan. Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, former Iranian president and one of the most powerful members of the regime in Iran, was the head of the parliamentary speaker and had close ties to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) construction firm, which built most of Iran&#x27;s infrastructure, including dams.
 These dams were used to redirect water to the agricultural fields of high-ranking members of the regime, including the Rafsanjani family, resulting in a water mafia-like scenario.

=== Land rights ===
In the region, although communal “garden ownership” (baghcheh-dari) was prevalent among villagers, absentee landlords still held a virtual monopoly over the ownership of the basin&#x27;s land and water resources. This is due to orchards being exempted from redistribution under the Iranian Land Reform Programme of 1962, which sought to abolish the feudal system and redistribute arable land from large landowners to smaller agricultural workers. At the end of the 80s, a survey done in two Rafsanjan villages revealed that villagers owned only about 17% of the water and cultivated land, while the rest belonged to a small number of absentee landlords.
==== Gender disparities ====
During the same era, there was a shift in labor relations from the traditional sharecropping contracts, which were prevalent throughout most of the Persian plateau, to wage labor. For pistachio cultivation, the new labor force was differentiated by skill and gender and was exclusively on a wage basis. The laborers, called “ghararis”, who were by definition male and highly skilled in irrigation work, which was an exclusively male task, constituted the &quot;labor aristocracy.&quot; They were employed on a permanent basis with a monthly wage, a New Year bonus, and given a small plot of land free of charge with access to the landlord&#x27;s irrigation water.

On the other hand, female laborers engaged in harvest and post-harvest operations occupied the lowest position in the labor hierarchy. Their work was seasonal, and their labor remuneration was mostly based on a piece-rate basis, with payment made three to four months after finishing the work. Additionally, the spinning and weaving of cotton textiles, which used to be a traditional income-earning activity for women, had at the time been virtually wiped out due to competition with the cheap synthetic fibers.

==Transport ==
Rafsanjan is located in the middle of Kerman-Yazd highway and also Chabahar transit pathway. The distances between Rafsanjan and the surrounding cities are:
 to Bardsir, to Sirjan, to Shahre-Babak, to Anar, to Zarand, to Bafgh and to Yazd.

Locally, people use both public and private transportation, however private vehicles are more popular among residents.
Rafsanjan also houses bus stations with destination to almost every major city around the country, cargo and freit terminal, domestic trains station in the middle of Tehran-Bandar Abbas railway, and also a comercial airport with flights to and from Tehran.

Several months later, his father added Soepratman to his name and explained that he was born in Meester Cornelis, Batavia. Soepratman was the seventh of nine children. His eldest sibling was Rukiyem Supratiyah van Eldik.

At the age of 6, he entered Budi Utomo elementary school in Cimahi. After his father retired, Wage followed his sister Rukiyem to Makassar, where he began attending a &quot;Europeesche Lagere School&quot; (ELS) in 1914. It was then when Rudolf was added to his name, so that his rights would be equal to the Dutch. However, he was asked to leave the school after it was revealed that he was not of European descent. He continued his studies in a Malay language school. After returning home, he learned to play guitar and violin. His brother-in-law, Willem Mauritius van Eldik, gave him a violin as a seventeenth birthday present in 1920. After graduating from Malay language school in 1917, Wage attended Dutch language courses and graduated in 1919. He continued to Normal School, or Teachers&#x27; College, and became an auxiliary teacher in Makassar after he graduated.

In 1920, he and van Eldik founded a jazz-styled band, called Black &amp; White. He played the violin. They performed at weddings and birthday parties in Makassar.

Beginning in July 1933, Wage started to feel ill. In November 1933, he resigned as a journalist at Sin Po and settled first in Cimahi, then Palembang, and finally in Surabaya. On 17 August 1938, he died at 01.00 a.m. and was buried in Kenjeran, Surabaya. On 13 March 1956, his remains were moved to Tambak Segaran Wetan cemetery.

==Indonesia Raya==
Wage composed both the music and lyrics for the song &quot;Indonesia Raya&quot;, which later became Indonesia&#x27;s national anthem. It was introduced during the Second Indonesian Youth Congress on 28 October 1928. The song was quickly adopted by Sukarno&#x27;s PNI. 

In 1929, the prominent Indonesian businessman and record executive Tio Tek Hong contacted Supratman; the two agreed to issue the first records of the anthem with Supratman retaining its copyright. The new records were extremely popular, but in 1930 the Dutch colonial authorities placed a ban on the song and confiscated all remaining unsold records. The text was revised in November 1944, and the melody arranged to its present musical form in 1958.

==Legacy==

The government awarded Wage the National Hero title and the Bintang Mahaputra Utama kelas III in 1971. Several Indonesian cities and towns have named streets after Wage, usually referred to as Jalan WR Soepratman.

==Personal life==
Wage belonged to the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. He was buried in a Muslim ceremony

 in Kapas Public Cemetery, Tambaksari, Surabaya.

For their first eleven seasons, the Rapids played at Mile High Stadium (1996–2001) and Invesco Field at Mile High (2002–2006). In 2004, the club and city announced a $130 million project that would include youth soccer fields, retail development, and a new Commerce City civic center. The total cost of stadium construction was $64.5 million. Commerce City voters agreed to $65 million bond for infrastructure improvements to support the stadium. Construction began at the site, close to Denver&#x27;s former Stapleton International Airport and bordered on the north and east by the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge; to the south by 56th Avenue; and to the west by Quebec Street, in fall 2005. In November 2006, Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods signed a 20-year deal for naming rights.

The stadium opened with an intrasquad scrimmage open only to Commerce City residents and season ticket holders. The first official match was played against D.C. United on April 7, 2007, with the Rapids winning, 2–1 in the regular season opening game. Herculez Gomez scored the first goal at the stadium. In the stadium&#x27;s inaugural year, it hosted the 2007 MLS All-Star Game as the MLS All-Stars defeated Scotland&#x27;s Celtic FC.

The Rapids played their first playoff game at DSG Park on October 28, 2010; a 1–0 victory over the Columbus Crew. Two weeks later, a crowd of 17,779 was in attendance as the Rapids defeated the San Jose Earthquakes en route to their first-ever MLS Cup.

The stadium is owned by Commerce City and operated by Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment (KSE) who also own the Colorado Avalanche, Denver Nuggets, and the Colorado Mammoth.

==Other sports events==
The stadium has hosted several high-profile rugby games. In 2009, it hosted several matches of the 2009 Churchill Cup, including the United States v. Georgia, Canada v. Argentina, and England v. Ireland. The Denver Barbarians of Rugby Super League have hosted occasional home matches at the stadium.

In May 2009, the stadium hosted the Men&#x27;s Collegiate Lacrosse Association National Championships with the Michigan Wolverines defeating Chapman University 12–11 in overtime on the Division I side and University of St. Thomas beating the University of Dayton 16–11 in Division II.

The Denver Dream of the Lingerie Football League played their two home games at the stadium during their lone season.

The stadium held the 2014 World Lacrosse Championship during July 10–19, 2014.

On Friday, March 22, 2013, Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods Park was the site of the World Cup CONCACAF 2014 qualifying match between Costa Rica and USA, a game played in blizzard conditions. Costa Rica filed a protest with FIFA due to field conditions when the United States won the game 1–0, but the protest was denied. The game has already been dubbed in football lore as &quot;SnowClásico&quot; for the conditions.

==Music events==
The venue grounds hosted the Mile High Music Festival annually from 2008 to 2010. The first Mile High Music Festival had attendance of approximately 40,000 people each day over the course of two days. By utilizing the open soccer fields surrounding the stadium and additional stages throughout the complex, the complex&#x27;s total capacity was able to greatly exceed what the stadium could hold alone.

The rock band Phish established an annual three-night residency at the venue over Labor Day Weekend, starting in 2011 and returning each year since (with the exception of 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic). In 2022, the residency expanded to four nights. Phish&#x27;s lead singer, Trey Anastasio, noted &quot;We all love Dicks!&quot;

<text>Alexander Georg von Bunge (; – ) was a Russian botanist. He is best remembered for scientific expeditions into Asia and especially Siberia.

== Early life and education ==
Bunge was born under the name Alexander Andreevič von Bunge on in Kyiv as second son of a family that belonged to the German minority in Tsarist Russia. His father, Andreas Theodor was a pharmacist who had emigrated from East Prussia to Russia with his grandfather in the 18th century and his mother, Elisabeth von Bunge, . They moved to Dorpat in 1815 after his father&#x27;s death in 1814, and he attended high school from 1818 to 1821. He was educated at Dorpat, where he attended the gymnasium from 1821 to 1825. Then he studied medicine and obtained his doctorate of medicine from the University of Tartu in 1825. He also studied botany there under Carl Friedrich von Ledebour and completed his thesis entitled &quot;De relatione methodi plantarum naturalis in vires vegetabilium medicalis&quot; 

== Expedition to Siberia ==
At early January, he worked as Head of Metallurgy in the Kolyvan-Voskresensker factory under P. K. Frolov and as district physician in Barnaul (Tomsk Governorate) which located in Southern Siberia. The same year he went with Ledebour and Carl Anton von Meyer on an important scientific expedition to the Kazakh Steppe and Altai Mountains. They spent five weeks across Russia to Barnaul during the summer and collected 1,600 plant specimens, which formed the basis of the &quot;Flora Altaica.&quot; This book was published in four volumes between 1829 and 1833.

After the expedition, Bunge lived in Kolyvan and transferred to Zmeinogorsk until 1830. After recommendation by Alexander von Humboldt, whom Bunge met in 1829 when Humboldt visited Altai, he was given a scientific mission to Peking by the Academy of St.Petersburg. Humboldt was on an expedition financed by Tsar Nicholas. He was accompanied by Colonel Ladijenski as &quot;pristav&quot; (escort) and Dr. P. Kirilov as physician. Apart from him there were other researchers, including Georg Albert von Fuss as astronomer and metereologist, and Kovanko as mineralogist. All of them were part of the eleventh ecclesiastical mission, which happened regularly, and were also to pick up the emissary for the tenth ecclesiastical mission. They went to Peking from the border town Kjachta at the end of O.S August 1830 via Urga in September 1830, and arrived in Peking on 17 November 1830 after crossing the Gobi Desert, and spent the winter in Peking. Bunge continued his research in March 1831 by going to the ruins known as Tsagan Balgasun located in Khalgan (Zhangjiakou). His research was finally stopped in May 1821 because he incurred the displeasure of the Chinese authorities when he stayed at Buddhist Monastery and did not get permission to go out of Peking 

They returned to Russia on 6 July 1831 with the emissary of the tenth ecclesiastical mission by following the western route that bypassed Kalgan and Urga. They arrived in Russia in early September 1831 with their collection of 450 plant specimens. In addition to plants Bunge collected a few beetles, which were described by Franz Faldermann in his book &quot;Coleopterorum ab illustrissimo Bungio in China boreali, Mongolia, et Montibus Altaicis collectorum descriptio&quot;.

After the expedition Bunge lived in Irkutsk for the rest of the winter. He spent his time in describing his collection. Most of it was saved in the herbarium of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg and a small part was saved in the herbarium of the University of Halle as part of a herbarium exchange and duplicated what was saved in St. Petersburg. One of the plants that he named is &quot;Viburnum fragrans&quot; Bunge (later renamed &quot;Viburnum farreri&quot; Stearn, after William T. Stearn) and also appeared in &quot;Enumeratio plantarum quas in China boreali collegit&quot;.

In April 1832 Bunge returned to his duties as physician in Barnaul, but not long afterwards he made another expedition of the Russian Academy of Sciences to go to Chuya, located in the eastern Altai mountains. He went to St. Petersburg in 1833 and was nominated as a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and he also became Professor of Botany in Kazan University. Bunge spent three years at this university, and during this period, he made an expedition to study plants from the Volga steppe before moving back to Dorpat in 1836 to become professor of botany in the University of Dorpat and director of the botanical garden., replacing Ledebour, who had retired.

During his professorship Bunge made a scientific expedition to Khorasan and Afghanistan in 1857–58, and another expedition to Persia through Herat in 1858–1859, led by Nikolái Vladímirovich Janykov. On the basis of this expedition, Bunge published a botanical treatise for the Russian Academy of Sciences and became an honorary member of the academy in 1875. He kept in contact with Diederich Franz Leonhard von Schlechtendal, a botanist at the University of Halle, through correspondence, via articles published in the journal &quot;Linnaea&quot; and through the exchange of herbarium specimens. Bunge retired as professor in 1867 and was succeeded by Heinrich Moritz Willkomm. He remained in Dorpat until 1881, spending his later years there investigating Estonian flora. Bunge edited the exsiccata &quot;Flora exsiccata Liv-, Esth- und Kurlands&quot;.

== Personal life ==
He was the father of physiologist Gustav von Bunge (1844–1920) and of Alexander von Bunge (1851–1930), an explorer and zoologist. His older brother, Friedrich Georg von Bunge (1802–1897), was a legal historian. Bunge died on in Dorpat.

<text>Thomas Norman Kindness (August 26, 1929January 8, 2004) was an American politician who served six terms as a member of the United States House of Representatives representing Ohio from January 3, 1975, to January 3, 1987.

==Life ==
Born in Knoxville, Tennessee, Kindness graduated from Glendale High School in Glendale, California, in 1947. Kindness received his bachelor of arts degree from the University of Maryland in 1951 and his bachelor of laws degree from George Washington University in 1953. While a student at Maryland, Kindness became a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity.

=== Career ===
He was assistant counsel for paper company Champion International, in Hamilton, Ohio, from 1957 to 1973, and was elected to the city council of Hamilton in 1964, serving until 1969. He served as mayor of Hamilton from 1964 to 1967. He served in the Ohio House of Representatives from 1971 to 1974, when he was elected to Congress from Ohio&#x27;s eighth congressional district, defeating Democrat T. Edward Strinko.

Kindness was re-elected five times: defeating Democrats John W. Griffin in 1976, Luella R. Schroeder in 1978, John W. Griffin again in 1980 and 1982, and John T. Francis in 1984.

In 1986, Kindness was one of the House impeachment managers who prosecuted the case in the impeachment trial of Judge Harry E. Claiborne. Claiborne was found guilty by the United States Senate and removed from his federal judgeship.

In 1986, Kindness won the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate, but he lost to incumbent John Glenn.

=== Later career ===
After this loss, Kindness stayed in Washington, D.C., and worked as a lobbyist. When Donald &quot;Buz&quot; Lukens, who had replaced Kindness as the 8th district&#x27;s representative, was caught in a sex scandal in 1989, Kindness attempted to win his old seat, opposing Lukens in the 1990 Republican primary.

He entered a Republican primary battle that included Lukens, state Representative John Boehner (who would later be elected to the seat and become House Speaker during his tenure in Congress) and lesser-known candidates.

Early polls gave Kindness a 60-point lead over the relatively obscure Boehner. But Boehner attacked Kindness&#x27;s ethics, citing Kindness&#x27;s votes for congressional pay raises and against limits on fees for speeches by congressmen. Boehner also depicted Kindness as a carpetbagger who had abandoned his district for Washington. Despite Kindness&#x27;s outspending him 5-1, Boehner won the nomination with 49 percent of the vote. Kindness finished with 32 percent and Lukens with 17 percent.

== Death ==
Kindness died in Exeter, Devonshire, England at the age of 74.

<doc id="807786" wikidata="Q635748" url="?curid=807786" title="Armed Forces (album)">
<text>Armed Forces is the third studio album by the English singer-songwriter Elvis Costello, released on 5January 1979 in the United Kingdom through Radar Records. It was his second album with the Attractions—keyboardist Steve Nieve, bassist Bruce Thomas and drummer Pete Thomas (no relation)—and the first to officially credit them on the cover. The album was recorded in six weeks from August to September 1978 in London under the working title &quot;Emotional Fascism&quot;. Produced by Nick Lowe and engineered by Roger Béchirian, the sessions saw Costello exert more control over production compared to &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot;, while Nieve contributed more to song arrangements.

For &quot;Armed Forces&quot;, Costello sought a more commercial sound than the punk rock style employed on his two previous records, resulting in a more pop-oriented production reflecting the new wave era. The overtly political lyrics concern the effect of politics on human relationships. The UK release featured an elaborate fold-out LP packaging, with a cover depicting a herd of elephants; it was simplified for the US release through Columbia Records, featuring an alternate drip-cover.

Supported by the successful UK singles &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Army&quot; and &quot;Accidents Will Happen&quot;, &quot;Armed Forces&quot; reached number two in the UK, becoming Costello&#x27;s biggest commercial success up to that point. The American version, released in February 1979, omitted &quot;Sunday&#x27;s Best&quot; and replaced it with Costello&#x27;s version of Lowe&#x27;s &quot;(What&#x27;s So Funny &#x27;Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding&quot;. The album received positive reviews from music critics and appeared on several lists of the year&#x27;s best albums. Costello and the Attractions supported the album on the Armed Funk tour in America.

In later decades, &quot;Armed Forces&quot; has continued to receive positive reviews, with many highlighting the production. Others noted that it contained musical styles Costello would utilise for later records. It is considered one of Costello&#x27;s best works and has appeared on various best-of lists. The album has been reissued multiple times, including in 2020 as a super deluxe edition, which was positively received.

==Background and recording==

Elvis Costello&#x27;s second studio album &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; (1978) was his first with the backing band the Attractions–bassist Bruce Thomas, drummer Pete Thomas (no relation) and keyboardist Steve Nieve, after using the American band Clover for his debut album &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; (1977). From mid-July to mid-December 1977, Costello and the Attractions underwent a rigorous touring schedule before taking a break to record &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot;. Another gruesome touring schedule followed throughout 1978, which contributed to growing exhaustion for the artist and band. Nevertheless, Costello continued writing new material; songs that would appear on &quot;Armed Forces&quot; began appearing in the setlists starting in May. In July, Costello recorded his song &quot;Stranger in the House&quot; with country artist George Jones, which appeared on the latter&#x27;s &quot;My Very Special Guests&quot; album in 1979, after which the former began recording &quot;Armed Forces&quot;.

Under the working titles &quot;Cornered On Plastic&quot; and &quot;Emotional Fascism&quot;, &quot;Armed Forces&quot; was recorded at London&#x27;s Eden Studios starting in August 1978 and lasted six weeks. Returning from &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; were musician Nick Lowe as producer and Roger Béchirian as engineer. Costello&#x27;s work ethic during the sessions was strong. His on-again/off-again romantic partner at the time Bebe Buell recalled: &quot;Elvis wasn&#x27;t the kind of guy who slept all day. He got up and went to the studio to record and rehearse. He was a working boy, not a loller.&quot; Unlike the previous album sessions, he asserted himself as the final decision maker on all takes, production and mixes. He later admitted: &quot;By the third [album] I thought I was God&#x27;s gift. I was totally convinced. I had no doubts.&quot; 

Despite tensions present, Lowe remained instrumental in keeping high morale and orchestration. He was also responsible for incorporating the new sounds Costello wanted for the record. Béchirian later explained: &quot;The whole way those things were directed and put together was very much down to Nick. Nick had a real pop sensibility about him.&quot; For his process, Lowe had the band record backing tracks first before commencing on overdubs. Regarding band dynamics, Costello contended that he and the Attractions reached a level of musical agreement that would never be matched again. Nieve, in particular, was more involved in the song arrangements, particularly on &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Army&quot;. Also recorded was a cover of Lowe&#x27;s &quot;(What&#x27;s So Funny &#x27;Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding&quot;, originally released by his band Brinsley Schwarz on &quot;The New Favourites of... Brinsley Schwarz&quot; (1974). The new version was prepared for release as a B-side for Lowe&#x27;s upcoming single &quot;American Squirm&quot;, released in November 1978; the band were credited as &quot;Nick Lowe and His Sound&quot;. Recording wrapped in September, after which Costello and the Attractions continued live performances.

==Music and lyrics==

After having achieved relative commercial success with &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; and &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot;, Costello decided to take &quot;Armed Forces&quot; in his most commercial direction yet, stating in a 1982 interview that he was selling out modestly-sized venues but received little success with singles compared to artists such as the Bee Gees and Fleetwood Mac. As such, &quot;Armed Forces&quot; marked a departure from the punk rock of its two predecessors to become, according to the biographer David Gouldstone, Costello&#x27;s most pop-oriented album up to that point. Joe Marchese of &quot;The Second Disc&quot; retrospectively noted that Costello embraced the new wave sound of the era, working with Lowe and Béchirian to create a &quot;more intricate&quot; sound compared to its predecessors, while still &quot;immediate and direct in its power and aggression&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; and &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; later identified the album&#x27;s sound as new wave and post-punk, respectively. Writer Greil Marcus noted that compared to its two predecessors, the sound of &quot;Armed Forces&quot; is &quot;suppressed, claustrophobic, [and] twitching&quot;. Lowe&#x27;s production, which some compared to the Wall of Sound-style of Phil Spector, utilised the studio to greater effect, creating a grander production overall, particularly on tracks such as &quot;Accidents Will Happen&quot;, &quot;Chemistry Class&quot; and &quot;Party Girl&quot;.

Costello also used a variety of influences when crafting the sound he wanted for &quot;Armed Forces&quot;. He stated in an interview that while on the road during tours, he and the Attractions listened to the 1976–77 works of David Bowie (&quot;Station to Station&quot;, &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot;&quot;) and Iggy Pop (&quot;The Idiot&quot;, &quot;Lust for Life&quot;), Kraftwerk (&quot;Autobahn&quot;), the 1969 works of the Beatles (&quot;Abbey Road&quot; and &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;), as well as ABBA (&quot;Greatest Hits&quot;). Reviewing in 2002, &quot;Mojo&quot;″s Mat Snow found a cross between &quot;Abbey Road&quot; and Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; (1965). ABBA influenced Nieve&#x27;s keyboard part for &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Army&quot; and due to his greater contributions to the arrangements, his keyboards are more prominent throughout the entire album, predominantly on &quot;Green Shirt&quot; and &quot;Party Girl&quot;. Béchirian later downplayed the numerous influences, stating that &quot;a lot of that was just in the air&quot;.

While its two predecessors dealt with issues of immediate concern to the narrators, &quot;Armed Forces&quot; focuses on bigger issues on a broader scale. Marcus described it as a political album, or &quot;a set of songs about how we live out the politics of our age whether we want to, mean to, or not&quot;. He specifically writes that on the album, &quot;every moment of personal failure or unsatisfied passion is invaded by the cruelty and shamelessness of the political world.&quot; Indeed, Gouldstone identifies tracks that reflect political themes include &quot;Senior Service&quot;, &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Army&quot;, &quot;Goon Squad&quot; and &quot;Sunday&#x27;s Best&quot;. Writing for &quot;PopMatters&quot;, Zeth Lundy described the album as &quot;a collection of musings on human nature and relationships, bolstered by the pervasive military metaphors&quot;. The interplay is reflected by the album&#x27;s working title &quot;Emotional Fascism&quot;. Although he had previously displayed fascist themes in tracks such as &quot;Less Than Zero&quot;, &quot;Night Rally&quot; and &quot;Radio Radio&quot;, Costello references fascist ideals frequently on &quot;Armed Forces&quot;, from Nazis to the Holocaust. Like its two predecessors, Graeme Thomson finds that Costello uses his signature wordplay on the album to great effect, composing various puns, double entendres, double-bluffs and non-sequiturs.

===Side one===
The opening track, &quot;Accidents Will Happen&quot;, is a non-political pop song that reflects the complexities of human relationships. Labelled by Hinton as a cross between the Byrds and the Beatles, it is addressed to Buell-type figure, but the actual subject is Costello himself, referring to his newfound sexual possibilities after achieving fame. &quot;NME&quot;″s Charles Shaar Murray described it as &quot;an ornate, melodic and exquisitely danceable pop song designed to lull American record executives into a state of false security&quot;. The second track, the upbeat &quot;Senior Service&quot;, concerns office politics and class warfare. More specifically, the song is about the brutality of big business in striking those down who are too weak to obtain power for themselves. It contains the first reference to the &#x27;armed forces&#x27;. Writer Franklin Bruno states that while &quot;Accidents Will Happen&quot; was a showcase for Costello&#x27;s voice, &quot;Senior Service&quot; &quot;reintroduces&quot; the Attractions and contains a widely different production style from the previous track. Continuing the political theme is &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Army&quot;, which boasts a pop-friendly production and melody over sinister lyrics on military imperialism. According to Gouldstone, the song&#x27;s narrator is &quot;presumably&quot; a British soldier serving in Northern Ireland. Costello refers to the Irish as &quot;white niggers&quot; and references the conquest of Ireland in 1649 by the English Parliamentarian leader Oliver Cromwell. Musically, Bruno makes comparisons to ABBA&#x27;s &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; (1976) and the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry Baby&quot; (1964).

Described by Murray as &quot;sexual fascism&quot;, &quot;Big Boys&quot; follows a narrator who is split between sympathy and contempt in his infatuation with a woman; he wants to be a &#x27;big boy&#x27; and is seen as immature. Gouldstone compares it to &quot;The Beat&quot; from &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot;. Bruno states that it is the album&#x27;s first track on which the mixture of personal and political themes appear as &quot;volatile&quot;. &quot;Green Shirt&quot; concerns paranoia and predicts the rise of sex hotlines. It uses three different themes: assault on the media, a woman tidying herself, and images of betrayals to establish a connection between personal behaviour and relationships on a larger scale. Musically, it is primarily led by a loop created on a Minimoog. Regarding the colour green, Bruno interprets it as a possible reference to the members of the Romanian fascist movement Iron Guard. &quot;Party Girl&quot; is a ballad in the vein of &quot;Alison&quot; and &quot;Little Triggers&quot;; away from the new wave of the rest of the album. Reportedly about Buell, Costello denied this in the 2002 &quot;Armed Forces&quot; reissue liner notes, stating he wrote it for an art student he barely knew. In the song, the narrator pleads for the &#x27;party girl&#x27; not to dismiss him even though he knows she has control over him and does not care how long it will take. After multiple political-related tracks, &quot;Party Girl&quot; represented a return to a more personal side.

===Side two===
&quot;Goon Squad&quot; builds on the theme of &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Army&quot; of &quot;underhand recruitment&quot;. In the song, a soldier relays messages on his experiences back to his family but by the end, he has lost his hand and fully joined the &#x27;good squad&#x27;. Gouldstone notes that the vague lyrics do not specifically mention the &#x27;good squad&#x27; as being the army–they could be police or big businesses–but the song nevertheless paints them in a poor light. Musically, Costello traced the song back to Don Covay&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Better to Have (and Don&#x27;t Need)&quot;, but admitted that &quot;we were too wound up to play it in that fashion&quot;. Described by Lundy as &quot;intentionally cavernous and bleak&quot;, Gouldstone finds it &quot;near heavy metal&quot;, while Hinton compares the intro to Thin Lizzy and the outro to the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; (1966). &quot;Busy Bodies&quot; is, in Gouldstone&#x27;s words, a &quot;snappy pop tune&quot; that evokes Roy Orbison&#x27;s &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;, &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot; and the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; (1967). Like &quot;Pump It Up&quot;, it concerns the insignificance of modern life; people spend their lives purchasing superfluous items, sleeping with each other and ultimately amounting to nothing, becoming busy bodies. Originally written for Ian Dury, &quot;Sunday&#x27;s Best&quot; is a waltz that targets the worst aspects of British life. Gouldstone writes that it shows how ordinary people are &quot;trivial and monotonous&quot;. On the song, Costello said that it is &quot;not so much a song as an attack on the small-ads page of &quot;The News of the World&quot; with a big pair of scissors&quot;. It has been musically compared to John Cooper Clarke&#x27;s &quot;You Never See a Nipple in the Daily Express&quot;. 

Murray considered &quot;Moods for Moderns&quot; a &quot;charming pastiche of Booker T &amp; the MGs overlaid with an oddly disturbing ghost of a song&quot;. Gouldstone finds it &quot;borderline funk&quot;, while Bruno compares it to Bowie&#x27;s &quot;plastic soul&quot; era. Lyrically, the song is about the pain one feels at the end of a relationship, with sinister undertones that reflect moods of disillusionment, alienation and fear. &quot;Chemistry Class&quot; combines the personal and political themes to tell a tale about the natural attraction of two people. One of the last lines references Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Final Solution as a metaphor for two lovers parting ways. Costello described it as a reaction to the gratification of American college campuses he experienced while on tour in America. Like the previous track, &quot;Two Little Hitlers&quot; captures the album&#x27;s dual themes of love and politics, fully comparing the disagreements in personal relationships to opposing factions of fascism. According to Hinton, it paints a picture of two long-time lovers, &quot;like beasts engaged in a fight to the death&quot;. Musically, it uses Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot; (1974) riff and elements of &quot;TVC 15&quot; (1976).

==Packaging==
===Title===
The new album was to be titled &quot;Emotional Fascism&quot; until the last minute. The author Tony Clayton-Lea contends that &quot;Armed Forces&quot;, coined by Pete Thomas, continued Costello&#x27;s theme of &quot;control and domination over both governing and individual bodies&quot;. In his memoir, Costello acknowledged changing the title to &quot;Armed Forces&quot; after knowing radio stations would refuse to play an album titled &quot;Emotional Fascism&quot;. Although Hinton opined that the titles were &quot;much [of] the same&quot;, Murray argued that &quot;Emotional Fascism&quot; was the superior title, stating: &quot;&quot;Armed Forces&quot; tells you what institution Mr. Costello has in his gunsights this time around... but &quot;Emotional Fascism&quot; tells you what attitude is about to be subjected to both long-and-short-range fire.&quot; In the 2002 liner notes for the album, Costello explained: &quot;Two or three half-formed notions collided uneasily in that title, although I never would have admitted to having anything as self-conscious as a &#x27;theme&#x27; running through the songs. Any patterns that have emerged did so as the record was completed or with the benefit of hindsight.&quot; Bruno contends that the album &quot;embodies a critique&quot; under either title, but also deduces that it &quot;does not present an &quot;argument&quot;&quot;.

===Artwork===
The packaging for &quot;Armed Forces&quot; was designed by Barney Bubbles and featured different cover artworks for the UK and US releases. In the UK, the cover was a painting depicting a herd of elephants in front of mountains, with birds flying overhead and mist overlaying the ground. The lead elephant stares directly at the onlooker, which Gouldstone notes mirrors Costello on the cover of &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot;. For the first time, the Attractions received co-artist credit on the sleeve. The artist credit is on top while the album title is on bottom. Initial UK editions boasted an elaborate fold-out sleeve containing four colour postcards of the band. The back cover illustrated art pop geometric patterns, of which emerged various army soldiers and animal prints. The inner sleeve contained two photographs: one showed Costello and the Attractions on a suburban road, while the other featured Costello laying across a swimming pool diving board with a body lying submerged at the bottom, overall surrounded by numerous yellow boxes; the words &quot;my place... or yours&quot; and &quot;emotional fascism&quot; appeared on the sides. When it was reissued on CD, the album failed to replicate the elaborate fold-out sleeves, instead having the booklet appear in the shape of a cross. Bruno argues that the cover &quot;conveys an unmistakable sense of attack&quot; and is more significant for its statement on Costello&#x27;s position at that point in his career rather than its actual design.

The US release opted for a more standardised LP packaging. The elephant cover was replaced with the drip-image that was unveiled in the inner sleeve of the UK release. The UK image had various black scribble lines extending into the outer panels that utilised various animal prints. Additionally, the US sleeve moved the elephant cover to the back and reduced it to make room for a track listing and larger rendering of the album title and artist name. Bruno argues that the &quot;modest&quot; cover reflected Costello&#x27;s lesser status in America. He furthermore associates Bubbles&#x27; decision to use the splatter design as a &quot;mocking appropriation&quot; of Roy Lichtenstein&#x27;s mid-1960s &quot;brushstroke&quot; paintings. A promotional photo taken for the album depicted Costello holding a machine gun barrel down his throat with the words &quot;Don&#x27;t Join&quot; over him. The first 100,000 pressings of the LP in both the UK and the US included a bonus EP titled &quot;Live at Hollywood High&quot;, recorded in June 1978, which contained live recordings of &quot;Alison&quot;, an extended &quot;Watching the Detectives&quot; and a slower version of &quot;Accidents Will Happen&quot;.

==Release and promotion==

&quot;Radio Radio&quot; was issued as a standalone single in October 1978 as a stopgap release between &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; and the still-titled &quot;Emotional Fascism&quot;, which was scheduled for release in early 1979. The single reached the UK top 30, earning Costello and the Attractions an appearance on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. From November to December, the band toured Canada, Japan and Australia and filmed promotional videos for &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Army&quot; and &quot;(What&#x27;s So Funny &#x27;Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding&quot;. By the start of another British tour at the end of December, the band&#x27;s growing exhaustion began to affect their performances. Bruce Thomas later admitted: &quot;We were all fried... we just didn&#x27;t get a break. I know what Jake [Riviera] was doing, but I think he pushed it too hard, I think he really did.&quot;

Now titled &quot;Armed Forces&quot; due to a complaint from Columbia/CBS, Radar Records issued the new album in the UK on 5January 1979, with the catalogue number RAD 14. The album was Costello&#x27;s biggest commercial success to date, peaking at number two on the UK Albums Chart, held off the top spot by the disco compilation &quot;Don&#x27;t Walk – Boogie&quot;; it remained on the chart for 28 weeks, twice as long as &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot;.

For its February 1979 release in the US, Columbia replaced &quot;Sunday&#x27;s Best&quot; with &quot;(What&#x27;s So Funny &#x27;Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding&quot;. This release went gold by the end of the year. After garnering significant radio exposure in the UK, &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Army&quot; was released as a single on 2February 1979, backed by Costello&#x27;s solo rendition of the 1937 show-tune &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot;. It peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart in March. &quot;Accidents Will Happen&quot; was issued as a single on 4May, backed by &quot;Talking in the Dark&quot; and &quot;Wednesday Week&quot;, and peaked at number 29 in the UK.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Armed Forces&quot; received positive reviews from music critics on release. Murray hailed the record as containing &quot;some of the best rock music we&#x27;ll hear this year&quot; in &quot;NME&quot;, while a writer in &quot;The Observer&quot; cited it as &quot;an album you just can&#x27;t ignore&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Robin Denselow named &quot;Armed Forces&quot; the &quot;first important album&quot; of the year, and referred to it as musically &quot;Costello&#x27;s most relaxed, mellow and gentle album yet&quot;. In the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Robert Hilburn named &quot;Armed Forces&quot; the best album at mid-year in July 1979. Citing it as Costello&#x27;s &quot;most compelling&quot; album yet, Hilburn described it as &quot;a feverish, unflinching approach&quot; that is a cross between the &quot;social fury of John Lennon&#x27;s first two solo albums&quot; and the &quot;haunting dissection of Bob Dylan&#x27;s choicest works&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Geoffrey Himes also compared Costello&#x27;s lyrical strategy of placing harsh ideals into more seductive settings with Dylan&#x27;s break from the folk rock movement in the mid-1960s. In his review of &quot;Armed Forces&quot;, Himes singled out &quot;Accidents Will Happen&quot; as &quot;the kind of high point that marks a great era of music&quot;. The same publication&#x27;s Eve Zibart described &quot;Armed Forces&quot; as Costello&#x27;s &quot;third and most polished album [that] stakes out New Wave&#x27;s first major fiefdom in the United States&quot;.
Writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Janet Maslin felt the album was a &quot;killer in several senses of the word&quot;, remarking on the brief, energetic songs with dense and sometimes overly clever but snappy lyrics. Maslin felt that Costello &quot;wants to be daring, but he also wants to dance&quot;. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau felt Costello was using words to &quot;add color and detail to his music&quot; rather than as &quot;a thinking, feeling person&quot;, though he approved of the &quot;intricate pop constructions&quot; and found the album overall to be &quot;good&quot; but not &quot;great&quot;. Both reviewers felt that the album was more densely or richly produced than its two predecessors. Other reviewers compared &quot;Armed Forces&quot; to its two predecessors, including Ira Robbins of &quot;Trouser Press&quot;, who considered it inferior to the &quot;supercharged bite&quot; of &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot;, but nevertheless deemed it a good record in its own right. On the lyrics, Robbins found that they &quot;suffer from an excessive penchant towards cheap puns and pseudo-Spoonerisms&quot;. Additionally, in a review titled &quot;Swell El&quot;, &quot;Record Mirror&quot;″s Sheila Prophet found the &quot;bitter bite&quot; of its predecessors exchanged for &quot;depth and subtlety and new textures&quot;. Tony Rayns of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; took issue with the use of the terms &quot;nigger&quot; and &quot;darkies&quot; in &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Army&quot; and &quot;Sunday&#x27;s Best&quot;, respectively, but was overall positive to Costello&#x27;s improved vocals and songwriting, and the performance of Nieve on keyboards. &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine&#x27;s Giovanni Dadomo highlighted &quot;Accidents Will Happen&quot;, &quot;Big Boys&quot; and &quot;Green Shirt&quot;, while also naming &quot;Goon Squad&quot; &quot;easily the best &#x27;political&#x27; song of the last five years&quot;.

In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll for the year&#x27;s best albums, &quot;Armed Forces&quot; finished at number five. It also featured on year-end lists by &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and &quot;NME&quot; at numbers fourteen and six, respectively.

==Tour and aftermath==

To support the album, Costello and the Attractions embarked on the Armed Funk tour in America, which lasted from February to April. The tour was plagued with issues, including drug and alcohol problems, aggressive behaviour from Riviera and Costello to the press, and poor performances that led to critical and audience backlash. In March, a racism-filled exchange between Costello, Stephen Stills, and Stills&#x27; then-backing singer Bonnie Bramlett, where the former insulted various American musical artists, was leaked to the public and received additional backlash. Even though &quot;Armed Forces&quot; had reached the top ten on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top LPs &amp; Tape chart during the tour, by April it fell off quickly after boycotts were enacted by American radio stations and listeners. By the tour&#x27;s end, Costello&#x27;s reputation in America was nearly destroyed. Bruce Thomas later admitted, &quot;We never really recovered from that tour. Every time Elvis is doing something well, he kind of sabotages it.&quot; His reputation in the UK remained largely unaffected, mostly due to newspapers failing to pick up the story. The author Mick St. Michael compared it to the worldwide response from John Lennon&#x27;s 1966 more popular than Jesus comment.

Following the disastrous tour, Costello decided to reevaluate himself and his career. He ended his relationship with Buell and reconciled with his wife Mary and son Matthew. Apart from the occasional demo, he and the Attractions took some time off over the summer of 1979. Upon reconvening in the studio later in the year, Costello took a more soul-influenced direction for his next album, &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; (1980). Costello acknowledged the incident in an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1982, feeling that it &quot;outweighs my entire career&quot;, but later reflected in his 2015 memoir &quot;Unfaithful Music &amp; Disappearing Ink&quot;: &quot;So what if my career was rolled back off the launching pad? Life eventually became a lot more interesting due to this failure to get into some undeserved and potentially fatal orbit.&quot; Although he was not dropped by Columbia, he did not tour America again until 1981 in support of &quot;Trust&quot;.

==Legacy==
Hinton argues that &quot;Armed Forces&quot; marked the end of the angry persona of Costello&#x27;s early works, although Thomson cites &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; as the first step away from the persona. Bruno saw the songs on &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; as a response to the events of the Armed Funk tour. Despite the tour&#x27;s initial impact on him, his career recovered from the incident. He later reflected: &quot;Some of the highly charged language may now seem a little naive; it is full of gimmicks and almost overpowers some songs with paradoxes and subverted clichés piling up into private and secret meanings. I was not quite 24 and thought I knew it all.&quot; Although he continued to reference aggressive and fascist themes in his lyrics, including on his 2020 album &quot;Hey Clockface&quot;, David A. Graham of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; argued that &quot;he has never written another record so searing in its combination of romantic and political fury as &quot;Armed Forces&quot;.&quot; Graham further contended that the fascist elements described on &quot;Armed Forces&quot; were still alive in America during the first presidency of Donald Trump, writing: &quot;More than four decades after its release, &quot;Armed Forces&quot; feels more frighteningly vital and relevant than ever.&quot;

===Retrospective appraisal===

In later decades, &quot;Armed Forces&quot; has received acclaim as one of Costello&#x27;s best works. In 1991, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Armond White called the album a &quot;landmark&quot;, while Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called it &quot;Costello&#x27;s &#x27;political&#x27; record, and also one of his most irresistibly melodic.&quot; Reviewing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2002, Gavin Edwards found a record &quot;filled with great rock songs that explore the boundaries between the political and the personal&quot;. He further highlighted Costello&#x27;s wordplay, Nieve&#x27;s keyboard playing and the inclusion of &quot;(What&#x27;s So Funny &#x27;Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding?&quot; as the final track. &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot;″s Jeff Giles stated that with the album, Costello achieved a balance between critical and commercial success, creating an album that proves &quot;a smart, sardonic set of pop songs can also be a hit&quot;. In &quot;PopMatters&quot;, Lundy described &quot;Armed Forces&quot; as &quot;a bold, highly ambitious effort&quot; that represented a &quot;giant leap&quot; from its two &quot;flawless&quot; predecessors. He noted that neither of the earlier records could match &quot;Armed Forces&quot;″ &quot;acidic intellectualism&quot;.

Several reviewers commented on the production. In AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine found a more &quot;detailed and textured pop production&quot; on &quot;Armed Forces&quot; compared to Costello&#x27;s first two albums, making the music more accessible, though the lyrics were &quot;more insular and paranoid&quot;. Although he felt some of the lyrics were forced, he hailed the music as &quot;demonstrat[ing] the depth of Costello&#x27;s compositional talents&quot;, and named &quot;Armed Forces&quot; the artist&#x27;s &quot;third masterpiece in a row&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Matt LeMay described the production as &quot;extravagantly layered with dense instrumentation and rich, effusive textures&quot; that &quot;often serve[s] to conceal, rather than reveal the nuances of Costello&#x27;s songwriting&quot;. He concluded that &quot;the greatest strength of &quot;Armed Forces&quot; may be the same thing that makes it less viscerally powerful than Costello&#x27;s two prior records – its songs absolutely demand to be appreciated for their craftsmanship.&quot; He further argued that the album marks the point at which Costello found his voice as a songwriter. Paul Sexton of uDiscoverMusic wrote that the production&#x27;s &quot;crisp and disciplined&quot; delivery kept the material &quot;live and vital&quot; on a record &quot;that enhanced Costello&#x27;s reputation as an artist with depth behind the vitriol&quot;. 

Some reviewers noted that the album contained styles that hinted at the artist&#x27;s later works. AllMusic&#x27;s Mark Deming highlighted &quot;Accidents Will Happen&quot; as previewing the &quot;stylistic diversity&quot; Costello would incorporate into future works, while Stewart Mason felt that &quot;Party Girl&quot; presaged the soul music he would explore on &quot;Get Happy!!&quot;, and Bruno cited the keyboards on &quot;Green Shirt&quot; as foreshadowing &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; (1982). Sexton stated that the songs hinted at the artist&#x27;s future rock and soul directions but nevertheless &quot;sounded entirely cutting-edge at the same time&quot;. Lundy also noted that &quot;Armed Forces&quot; enacted &quot;an eclectic blueprint of restless genre hustling&quot; that Costello continued to utilise throughout his long career.

===Rankings===
&quot;Armed Forces&quot; has appeared on several best-of lists. In 1993, the album placed at number 61 on &quot;The Times&quot;&#x27; &quot;100 Best Albums of All Time&quot; list. In 2000, it was voted number 264 in the third edition of English writer Colin Larkin&#x27;s book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000). The same year, &quot;Q&quot; placed &quot;Armed Forces&quot; at number 45 in its list of the &quot;100 Greatest British Albums Ever&quot;. In 2003, the album was ranked number 482 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and then was moved to number 475 on an updated list in 2012. &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Sounds&quot; ranked &quot;Armed Forces&quot; at numbers 89 and 67 in 1985 and 1986, respectively, on lists compiling the 100 greatest albums of all time.

The album was also included in the 2018 edition of Robert Dimery&#x27;s book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Reissues==

&quot;Armed Forces&quot; was first released on CD through Columbia and Demon Records in January 1986. Its first extended reissue through Demon in the UK and Rykodisc in the US on CD came in October 1993. The single disc featured the original album as well as bonus tracks, including the addition of &quot;(What&#x27;s So Funny &#x27;Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding&quot; as the album&#x27;s closing track. Rhino Records reissued the album in 2002 as a two-disc set; disc one contained the original UK album plus &quot;(What&#x27;s So Funny &#x27;Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding&quot;, and disc two contained bonus tracks.

On 6 November 2020, &quot;Armed Forces&quot; was reissued as a vinyl-only super deluxe box set. Titled &quot;The Complete Armed Forces&quot; and issued by UMe, the nine-LP set consists of a 2020 remaster of the original album plus various B-sides, demos, outtakes, unreleased live recordings from the era, and a new set of liner notes written by Costello himself totalling over 10,000 words. The collection was praised by critics for giving an in-depth view of the artist&#x27;s work during the period.

<text>Hossein Marashi (; born 17 November 1958 in Rafsanjan) is an Iranian politician. He served as the Iranian Vice President for Cultural Heritage and Tourism from 2003 to 2005. Prior to that, Marashi represented Kerman in the Iranian parliament. He strongly backed opposition candidate Mousavi in the 2009 Iranian election. Marashi is also reportedly a close ally of Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, another former president. He has been secretary general of the Executives of Construction Party. He has been named the head of vice-president Eshaq Jahangiri&#x27;s campaign.

He was the head of the province of Kerman for nearly nine years. He founded a Kerman-based charity by the name of Mol-Al-Movahedin Charity (or Non-Profit) Institute, which owns Mahan Air, an Iranian private airline. In 2011, the charity was involved in a scandal when it was accused of buying airplanes on behalf of Mahan Air. The airline had been facing sanctions by the United States Department of the Treasury for allegedly transporting weapons and advisors to troubled areas such as Syria and Yemen. The claim that firm had any connection with these political actives was denied by members of its board, and Marashi himself.

As the head of the Cultural Heritage Organization of Iran, Marashi increased the budget of the organization. However, some of Marashi&#x27;s opponents believe that he was responsible for the disappearance of invaluable historical pieces, and the destruction of historical buildings. These opponents claim that despite public pressure, he never took any action to stop the destruction of historical artifacts. Marashi supported the construction of the controversial Sivand Dam in the territory of Pasargadae. The dam was constructed in proximity to the ancient city, and experts believe that if the dam burst, it could destroy several UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

On March 19, 2010, it was announced that Marashi had been jailed in Iran, when a court of appeals upheld his one-year prison term. He was released from prison earlier than that, on January 25, 2011.

Marashi is a cousin of former president Rafsanjani&#x27;s wife, Effat Marashi.

<text>Latvian Higher League or Virslīga, known for sponsorship reasons as [[TonyBet]] Virslīga since 2024, is a professional football league and the top tier of association football in Latvia. Organised by the Latvian Football Federation, the Higher League is contested by 10 clubs.

==History and league format==

=== History ===
The first all-national Latvian championship - the Virslīga - which succeeded the Riga Football League and other, parallel regional leagues, was organized in 1927. It succeeded the previous Latvian Championship () that was held from 1922 to 1926 in similar fashion.

The Virslīga lasted until the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940. After World War II, between 1945 and 1991 the championship of Soviet Latvia was the main footballing competition in the Latvian SSR.

With Latvia regaining full independence in August 1991, the newly established Latvian Football Federation (LFF) decided to reorganise its competitions within the Virslīga from 1992. The same year Latvia returned to FIFA and became a member of UEFA.

=== Format ===
Latvian Higher League is being played usually from early March till November. Although the team count in the league has changed multiple times (10 in 2007 and 2020, 9 in 2019 and 2021, and 8 in 2015-2018), since 2022, total of 10 teams are participating in the Virslīga. Each side are playing 36 games during the season, with 18 games being played at home and other 18 - away. 

At the end of each season, the lowest placed team in the league gets automatically relegated to the Optibet Nākotnes Līga, with Nākotnes Līga winner replacing them, while the second lowest placed team gets to play in a 2 leg relegation playoff (&quot;Pārspēles&quot;) against the runner-up of the Nākotnes Līga, for the last spot in the league. The winner of Virslīga qualifies for the UEFA Champions League first qualification round, while runners-up and 3rd place teams qualify for the UEFA Conference League first qualification round.

A winter off-season league cup, the Virslīga Winter Cup, was played in January of each year from 2013 to 2017, which was replaced in 2018 by the Virslīga Cup (). However since 2024, a revamped off-season tournament, Livonia Cup, is being played from January till February, with teams from Latvia&#x27;s and Estonia&#x27;s leagues taking part.

== Sponsorships and name changes ==
The League has changed sponsors for several times. From 2006 until 2010 it was known as the LMT Virslīga. No sponsorships were established for the 2011 season. Starting from the 2012 season, the league was reorganised in partnership with an NGO as &quot;Latvijas Futbola virslīga&quot;, adopting the NGO&#x27;s name in the 2012 season. From 2013 to 2015, the league was known as the SMScredit.lv Virslīga due to a contract with the online microfinance company &quot;SMScredit&quot;. In March 2016, it was announced that the Virslīga would be sponsored by SynotTip Sports Bar on a three-year contract. They were succeeded by betting firm Optibet on a two-year contract, beginning with the Optibet Virslīga 2019 season, which lasted until 2024. In 2024 Optibet was replaced by TonyBet.

<doc id="807804" wikidata="Q411032" url="?curid=807804" title="Tapestry (Carole King album)">
<text>Tapestry is the second studio album by the American singer-songwriter Carole King. Produced by Lou Adler, it was released on February 10, 1971, by Ode Records. The album&#x27;s lead singles, &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late&quot; and &quot;I Feel the Earth Move&quot;, spent five weeks at number one on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and Easy Listening charts.

&quot;Tapestry&quot; is certified 14× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. In 2000, it ranked 74th in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;, and in 2020, it ranked 25th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. &quot;Tapestry&quot; won four Grammy Awards at the 14th Annual Grammys in 1972, including Album of the Year, Song of the Year and Record of the Year. In 1998, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Production==
Carole King wrote or co-wrote all of the songs on the album. Two songs were co-written with Toni Stern: &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late&quot; and &quot;Where You Lead&quot;; King wrote the music and Stern the lyrics. King&#x27;s ex-husband Gerry Goffin co-wrote the lyrics for three of the songs, two of which had already been hits for other artists: Aretha Franklin&#x27;s &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman&quot; (in 1967), and The Shirelles&#x27; &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow&quot; (in 1960).

James Taylor, who encouraged King to sing her own songs and who also played on &quot;Tapestry,&quot; had a number one hit with &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot; later in 1971.

The album was recorded at A&amp;M Recording Studios&#x27; Studio B in January 1971 with the support of Taylor, Joni Mitchell, and various experienced session musicians. Several of the musicians worked simultaneously on Taylor&#x27;s album &quot;Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon&quot;.

A&amp;M staff photographer Jim McCrary took the cover photograph in the living room of King&#x27;s home at 8815 Appian Way, Laurel Canyon, California. It shows her sitting barefoot on a cushion on a bench beside a window, holding a tapestry that she hand-stitched herself, with her cat, named after Telemachus, near her foot.

==Critical reception==
The album was met with widespread critical acclaim; &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau felt that her voice, free of &quot;technical decorum&quot;, would liberate female singers; Jon Landau of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that King was one of the most creative pop music figures and had created an album of &quot;surpassing personal-intimacy and musical accomplishment&quot;.

===Awards===
Along with being selected Album of the Year, &quot;Tapestry&quot; received Grammys for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, Record of the Year (&quot;It&#x27;s Too Late&quot;), and Song of the Year (&quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot;) at the 14th Annual Grammy Awards, making King the first solo female artist to win the Grammy Award for Record of the Year and the first woman to win the Grammy Award for Song of the Year.

The album remained on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts for 313 weeks (second only to Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;&#x27;s 724 weeks).

==Commercial performance==

&quot;Tapestry&quot; was a huge commercial success. It spent 15 consecutive weeks at number one on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It still holds the record for most consecutive weeks at number one by a female solo artist. The album also spent nearly six years charting on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 (318 weeks), on which King also spent 302 consecutive weeks. For more than 40 years, &quot;Tapestry&quot; held the record for the longest-charting album by a female solo artist in the U.S., until Adele&#x27;s &quot;21&quot; broke the record in 2017. As of 2021, &quot;Tapestry&quot; had sold 14 million copies in the U.S. and 30 million worldwide.

In Canada, &quot;Tapestry&quot; spent nine weeks at number one beginning July 3, 1971. It was on the Top 100 chart from April 14, 1971, to January 20, 1973, and again from September 22, 1973, to February 16, 1974. In the United Kingdom, the album debuted at number 32 on UK Albums Chart and eventually rose to number four, spending 136 weeks in the Top 100.

==Cultural impact==
Several songs from the album were recorded by other artists and became hits while the album was still on the charts: James Taylor&#x27;s 1971 recording of &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot; from &quot;Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon&quot; hit number one in the U.S. and number four in the U.K., and Barbra Streisand&#x27;s 1971 studio recording of &quot;Where You Lead&quot; from her album &quot;Barbra Joan Streisand&quot; reached number 40, while a live recording of a medley in which Streisand paired the song with the Sweet Inspirations hit &quot;Sweet Inspiration&quot; from her album &quot;Live Concert at the Forum&quot; reached number 37 the following year.

Various artists have combined to rerecord more than one tribute album. The first, released in 1995 and titled &quot;Tapestry Revisited: A Tribute to Carole King&quot;, was certified gold. The second, in 2003, was titled &quot;A New Tapestry – Carole King Tribute&quot;. In 2010 Australian recording artist Marcia Hines recorded a tribute album, &quot;Marcia Sings Tapestry&quot;.

:&quot;My mum loved Carole King&#x27;s &quot;Tapestry&quot;. That was always in the house.&quot; —Amy Winehouse

&quot;Her songs are like stories or sonic movies&quot;, Tori Amos said. &quot;You want to walk into them. With &#x27;I Feel the Earth Move&#x27; or &#x27;It&#x27;s Too Late&#x27;, you&#x27;re right there.&quot;

&quot;Tapestry&quot; has appeared on critics&#x27; lists of the best albums. In 2003, it ranked 36th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, maintaining that rating in a 2012 revised list and moving up to 25th in a 2020 revision. The album was also listed 39th by VH1 on its list of 100 Greatest Albums, and was one of 50 recordings chosen to be added to the National Recording Registry. Recordings added to the National Recording Registry are picked to be preserved in the Library of Congress as they are &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically important.&quot;

In 2015, for its sixth and final season, American TV series &quot;Glee&quot; paid tribute to this album, alongside Alanis Morissette&#x27;s &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;, in its episode &quot;Jagged Little Tapestry&quot;. Five songs from &quot;Tapestry&quot; are performed by various artists. Two of them, &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late&quot; and &quot;So Far Away&quot;, are performed on their own, while the other three are used in a mashup with a song from &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;. &quot;I Feel the Earth Move&quot; is mashed up with &quot;Hand in My Pocket&quot;, &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow?&quot; with &quot;Head Over Feet&quot;, and &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot; with &quot;You Learn&quot;. The episode was watched by 1.98 million viewers and received a 0.7/2 in the adult 18-49 demographic.

In March 2016 it was announced that King would perform the album live in its entirety for the first time at the British Summer Time Festival in Hyde Park, London, on July 3, 2016. The performance was released the following year as &quot;Tapestry: Live at Hyde Park&quot;.

<text>SeatGeek Stadium is a soccer-specific stadium in Bridgeview, Illinois, about 12 miles southwest of downtown Chicago. It is the home stadium of Chicago Stars FC of the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League, Chicago Fire FC II of MLS Next Pro, and the Chicago Hounds of Major League Rugby. The stadium has also hosted the Chicago Fire of Major League Soccer, Chicago Machine of Major League Lacrosse, Chicago Bliss of the Legends Football League, Chicago State Cougars men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer teams of NCAA Division I, and Chicago House AC of the National Independent Soccer Association. Originally Toyota Park when it opened on June 11, 2006, the facility has a capacity of 20,000 and was developed at a cost of around $100 million. The naming rights agreement with SeatGeek went into effect following the Fire&#x27;s 2018 season.

==History==
The Chicago Fire entered Major League Soccer as an expansion team in 1998, playing its first four seasons at Soldier Field in Chicago, which they shared with the National Football League (NFL)&#x27;s Chicago Bears. Beginning in 2002, the club moved to Cardinal Stadium (now Benedetti–Wehrli Stadium) in Naperville for two seasons while Soldier Field was renovated, leading to calls for a soccer-specific venue. The Fire received several bids before announcing Bridgeview as the winner in 2003. Construction on the Bridgeview venue began on November 30, 2004, and was completed on June 11, 2006.

===Naming rights===
In 2006, Toyota entered into a ten-year naming rights agreement and renamed the new stadium Toyota Park. In 2016, it was reported that Toyota had opted against renewing their naming rights. Despite this, the stadium continued to be known as Toyota Park through the 2018 season. Afterwards, new sponsor SeatGeek assumed stadium naming rights starting with the 2019 Fire season.

The naming rights agreement signed in 2018 was the first such agreement SeatGeek entered into. It was reported that as part of the deal, SeatGeek would also serve as the venue&#x27;s primary ticketing service starting in 2019. The company reportedly promised that they would work to &quot;bring more live programming, including premier concerts, music festivals and international sporting events&quot; to the stadium.

===Future===
The Fire and Bridgeview began negotiating a re-evaluation of the stadium lease in 2018, shortly after Joe Mansueto acquired his stake in the team. In early April 2019, several media reports emerged about a potential contract buyout that would allow the Fire to move back to Chicago, playing temporarily at Soldier Field once again. On May 8, 2019, Fire president Nelson Rodriguez confirmed that the team was negotiating a tentative deal with the village to terminate their lease, which was slated to run through 2036, at an estimated cost of $65 million. The terms of the deal were confirmed on July 9, 2019. In consideration for releasing the Fire and MLS from the lease, the Fire will put money toward a &quot;multisport recreation and entertainment center&quot; at the site. The Red Stars have no plans to move. On January 27, 2021, Chicago House AC of the NISA announced that they had selected SeatGeek Stadium as their home.

Nevertheless, in 2022, because of Soldier Field availability, the Fire played late-season matches at the stadium and may still play other matches there in future seasons while it solves its Chicago stadium situation. Moreover, its MLS Next Pro affiliate Chicago Fire FC II is based out of Bridgeview.

==Design==
Incorporating traditional stadium features from American and European facilities, SeatGeek Stadium includes predominantly covered seating, a brick facade and stone entry archway, and first rows placed fewer than three yards from the field. It includes 42 executive suites, six larger party suites, the Illinois Soccer Hall of Fame, and the Fire club offices, as well as a large stadium club/banquet room measuring over .

A practice facility with two fields (one natural grass; the other artificial turf) for the Fire club and its youth programs lies next to the stadium. The stadium&#x27;s design allows expansion of 50% more seating at negligible expense. Its natural grass field&#x27;s $1.7 million turf management system comprises full heating, drainage, and aeration capabilities.

A permanent stage allows the stadium to host concerts and quickly change configurations. A typical conversion from soccer to stage takes no more than 18 hours. The field accommodates 8,000 additional chairback seats for concerts and other stage events. SeatGeek Stadium is currently operated by Spectra.

In July 2016, two large-scale murals were designed and painted by artist Tony Passero on the east and west walls of the stadium&#x27;s stage suites. The murals measure 14 feet high by 27 feet in length, and are named &quot;Offense&quot; and &quot;Defense&quot;.

==Major soccer events==


On November 27, 2010, SeatGeek Stadium was the venue for the 2011 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup qualification match between USA and Italy; USA defeated Italy 1–0 and advanced to the World Cup. SeatGeek Stadium was the venue for the 2006 MLS All-Star Game, in which the MLS side defeated Chelsea F.C. 1–0. The stadium also hosted the 2006 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup&#x27;s final, in which the Chicago Fire defeated the LA Galaxy 3–1.

SeatGeek Stadium hosts annual friendly matches between Chicago Fire and the popular European and Mexican clubs, which in the past included Tottenham Hotspur F.C., A.C. Milan, Everton, C.D. Guadalajara, Club America, Santos Laguna, and others. SeatGeek Stadium hosted four matches during the group stage of the 2014 CONCACAF Women&#x27;s Championship.

==Rugby union==
SeatGeek Stadium hosted its first international rugby match in 2007, with the United States Eagles losing 6–10 to provincial side Munster. In June 2008 the stadium hosted three matches of the Churchill Cup, including United States vs Canada, England Saxons vs Scotland A, and Ireland Wolfhounds vs Argentina Jaguares. On June 6, 2009, the stadium hosted a 2009 mid-year rugby test series match between United States and Wales in a warmup match for the US in its campaign to qualify for the 2011 Rugby World Cup.
==Other sports events==
SeatGeek Stadium served as the home site for Roosevelt University men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer matches from 2010 until 2019, when the team moved their matches to Illinois Institute of Technology&#x27;s on-campus stadium. It was announced in December 2019 that the Chicago Blitz of the Extreme Football League would play their inaugural season at SeatGeek Stadium.

The first college football game at the stadium took place on September 7, 2013, between DIII schools John Carroll and Saint Norbert, a game which John Carroll won 41–0.

For their 2021 season, the Chicago State Cougars men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer teams played at the stadium.

==Concerts and music festivals==

From 2006 to 2015, SeatGeek Stadium has been the host venue for Chicago radio station B96&#x27;s annual summer concert, The B96 Pepsi Summer Bash. The Crossroads Guitar Festival was held on July 28, 2007, and again on June 26, 2010.

== Accessibility ==
Pace operates the #387 SeatGeek Stadium Express nonstop from the Midway Orange Line Station for Chicago Fire matches and special events. A $2.475 million transit center operated by Pace was constructed at the east end of the stadium&#x27;s parking lot in 2014.

The Fire had also provided bus transportation from nine different bar locations in the city to and from the games. However upon moving back to Soldier Field that service is no longer offered for SeakGeek Stadium.

<text>Østfold University College (, HiØ) is a university college in Østfold county, Norway. It has campuses in Fredrikstad and Halden, and has around 7000 students (as of 2017) and 550 employees (as of 2017). The university college is one of the public university colleges in Norway, and is a result of five public colleges in Halden, Sarpsborg and Fredrikstad which were joined together as a part of the University College Reform () of 1994.

The school offers over 60 fields of study, ranging from Associate degrees, Bachelor&#x27;s degrees, Master&#x27;s degrees, and some Doctorates.

== Faculties ==
Østfold University College incorporates the following faculties:
* Faculty of Business, Social Sciences and Foreign Languages
* Faculty of Computer Sciences
* Faculty of Education
* Faculty of Engineering
* Faculty of Health and Social Studies
* Norwegian Theatre Academy

== Campus ==

HiØ is split between two campuses, one located in Halden, for business, social sciences, foreign language, computer science and education. The other in Fredrikstad, for engineering, health and social studies, and theatre.
The Halden campus, designed by architect firm Reiulf Ramstad Arkitekter, was opened in 2006. The building was nominated by the Norwegian Association of Architects for the Mies van der Rohe-prize.

The Fredrikstad campus is home to approximately 1,600 students and 150 staff. Its newest addition, called &quot;Smia&quot; (&quot;the forge&quot;), was opened for the school&#x27;s Faculty of Engineering in 2010.

== Academics ==
Østfold University College was ranked 5th in Norway, and 900th in the World in the 2010 Webometrics Ranking of World Universities.
The European Commission awarded the Diploma Supplement Label from 2009 to 2013 to Østfold University College (Høgskolen i Østfold). Of the 26 Norwegian higher education institutions that applied, Østfold University College was one of five that received this distinction of quality.

=== Theatre ===
Norwegian Theatre Academy offers undergraduate courses in theatre. Training is based on a combination of conceptual visual art and the techniques and methods of classical and contemporary theatre. Particular focus is placed on physical theatre, devised performance, and multi-disciplinary work.

=== Industrial Design Engineering ===
The Faculty of Engineering offers a 3-year Bachelor&#x27;s Degree in Industrial Design, that combines the science of engineering with the applied art of design to educate industrial design engineers. Students in this program go on to work as product, interface and transportation designers. The combined degree allows students to identify themselves as both engineers and designers.

NTNU in Trondheim offers a similar 5-year Master&#x27;s Degree that students can transfer to after graduation and get a 2-year Master&#x27;s Degree in Industrial Design Engineering. Students will then be able to use the title &quot;sivilingeniør&quot;, &quot;Master of Engineering&quot;.

<doc id="807813" wikidata="Q1323565" url="?curid=807813" title="Transformers">
<text>Transformers (stylised as TRANSFORMERS, alternatively titled as TransFormers, or simply abbreviated TF), is a media franchise produced by American toy company Hasbro and Japanese toy company Takara Tomy. It primarily follows the heroic Autobots and the villainous Decepticons, two alien robot factions at war that can transform into other forms, such as vehicles and animals. The franchise encompasses toys, animation, comic books, video games and films. As of 2011, it generated more than () in revenue, making it one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.

The franchise began in 1984 with the , comprising transforming mecha toys from Takara&#x27;s &quot;Diaclone&quot; and &quot;Micro Change&quot; toylines rebranded for Western markets. The term &quot;&quot; (G1) covers both the animated television series &quot;The Transformers&quot; and the comic book series of the same name, which are further divided into Japanese, British and Canadian spin-offs. Sequels followed, such as the &quot;&quot; comic book and &quot;Beast Wars&quot; TV series, which became its own . Generation 1 characters have been rebooted multiple times in the 21st century in comics from Dreamwave Productions (starting 2001), IDW Publishing (starting in 2005 and again in 2019), and Skybound Entertainment (beginning in 2023). There have been other incarnations of the story based on different toy lines during and after the 20th century. The first was the &quot;&quot; series, followed by three shows (&quot;, &quot;, and &quot;&quot;) that constitute a single universe called the &quot;Unicron Trilogy&quot;.

A live-action film series started in 2007, again distinct from previous incarnations, while the &quot;&quot; series merged concepts from the G1 continuity, the 2007 live-action film and the &quot;Unicron Trilogy&quot;. For most of the 2010s, in an attempt to mitigate the wave of reboots, the &quot;Aligned Continuity&quot; was established. In 2018, &quot;&quot; debuted, once again, distinct from the previous incarnations. Another series, &quot;&quot;, debuted in 2022, again separate from previous continuities. The 2024 animated film, &quot;Transformers One&quot;, once again takes place in a new continuity.

Although a separate and competing franchise started in 1983, Tonka&#x27;s &quot;GoBots&quot; became the intellectual property of Hasbro after their buyout of Tonka in 1991. Subsequently, the universe depicted in the animated series &quot;Challenge of the GoBots&quot; and follow-up film &quot;&quot; was retroactively established as an alternate universe within the &quot;Transformers&quot; multiverse.

==Fiction==
===&quot;Transformers: Generation 1&quot; (1984–1993)===

&quot;Generation 1&quot; is a retroactive term for the &quot;Transformers&quot; characters that appeared between 1984 and 1993. The &quot;Transformers&quot; began with the 1980s Japanese toy lines &quot;Micro Change&quot; and &quot;Diaclone&quot;. They presented robots able to transform into everyday vehicles, electronic items or weapons. Hasbro bought the &quot;Micro Change&quot; and &quot;Diaclone&quot; toys, and partnered with Takara. Marvel Comics was hired by Hasbro to create the backstory; editor-in-chief Jim Shooter wrote an overall story, and gave the task of creating the characters to writer Dennis O&#x27;Neil. Unhappy with O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s work (although O&#x27;Neil created the name &quot;Optimus Prime&quot;), Shooter chose Bob Budiansky to create the characters.

The &quot;Transformers&quot; mecha were largely designed by Shōji Kawamori, the creator of the Japanese mecha anime franchise &quot;Macross&quot; (which was adapted into the &quot;Robotech&quot; franchise in North America). Kawamori came up with the idea of transforming mechs while working on the &quot;Diaclone&quot; and &quot;Macross&quot; franchises in the early 1980s (such as the VF-1 Valkyrie in &quot;Macross&quot; and &quot;Robotech&quot;), with his &quot;Diaclone&quot; mechs later providing the basis for &quot;Transformers&quot;.

The primary concept of Generation 1 is that the heroic Optimus Prime, the villainous Megatron, and their finest soldiers crash-land on prehistoric Earth in the &quot;Ark&quot; and the &quot;Nemesis&quot; before awakening in 1985, Cybertron hurtling through the Neutral zone as an effect of the war. The Marvel comic was originally part of the main Marvel Universe, with appearances from Spider-Man and Nick Fury, plus some cameos, as well as a visit to the Savage Land.

&quot;The Transformers&quot; TV series began around the same time. Produced by Sunbow Productions and Marvel Productions, later Hasbro Productions, from the start it contradicted Budiansky&#x27;s backstories. The TV series shows the Autobots looking for new energy sources, and crash landing as the Decepticons attack. Marvel interpreted the Autobots as destroying a rogue asteroid approaching Cybertron. Shockwave is loyal to Megatron on the TV series, keeping Cybertron in a stalemate during his absence, but in the comic book, he attempts to take command of the Decepticons. The TV series would also differ wildly from the origins Budiansky had created for the Dinobots, the Decepticon turned Autobot Jetfire (known as Skyfire on TV), the Constructicons (who combine to form Devastator), and Omega Supreme. The Marvel comic establishes early on that Prime wields the Creation Matrix, which gives life to machines. In the second season, the two-part episode The Key to Vector Sigma introduced the ancient Vector Sigma computer, which served the same original purpose as the Creation Matrix (giving life to Transformers), and its guardian Alpha Trion.

In 1986, the cartoon became the film &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot;, which is set in the year 2005. It introduced the Matrix as the &quot;Autobot Matrix of Leadership&quot;, as a fatally wounded Prime gives it to Ultra Magnus; however, as Prime dies he drops the matrix, which is then caught by Hot Rod who subsequently becomes Rodimus Prime later on in the film. Unicron, a Transformer who devours planets, fears its power and re-creates a heavily damaged Megatron as Galvatron, as well as Bombshell or Skywarp becoming Cyclonus, Thundercracker becoming Scourge and two other Insecticons becoming Scourge&#x27;s huntsmen, the Sweeps. Eventually, Rodimus Prime takes out the Matrix and destroys Unicron. In the United Kingdom, the weekly comic book interspliced original material to keep up with U.S. reprints, and &quot;The Movie&quot; provided much new material. Writer Simon Furman proceeded to expand the continuity with movie spin-offs involving the time travelling Galvatron. The Movie also featured guest voices from Leonard Nimoy as Galvatron, Scatman Crothers as Jazz, Casey Kasem as Cliffjumper, Orson Welles as Unicron and Eric Idle as the leader of the Junkions (Wreck-Gar, though unnamed in the movie). The Transformers theme tune for the film was performed by Lion with &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic adding a song to the soundtrack.

The third season followed up &quot;The Movie&quot;, with the revelation of the Quintessons having used Cybertron as a factory. Their robots rebel, and in time the workers become the Autobots and the soldiers become the Decepticons. (Note: This appears to contradict background presented in the first two seasons of the series.) It is the Autobots who develop transformation. Due to popular demand, Optimus Prime is resurrected at the conclusion of the third season, and the series ended with a three-episode story arc. However, the Japanese broadcast of the series was supplemented with a newly produced OVA, &quot;&quot;, before creating entirely new series to continue the storyline, ignoring the 1987 end of the American series. The extended Japanese run consisted of &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, then in illustrated magazine form as &quot;Battlestars: Return of Convoy&quot; and &quot;Operation: Combination&quot;. Just as the TV series was wrapping up, Marvel continued to expand its continuity. It follows &quot;The Movie&quot;&#x27;s example by killing Prime and Megatron, albeit in the present day. Dinobot leader Grimlock takes over as Autobot leader. There was a &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; crossover and the limited series &quot;The Transformers: Headmasters&quot;, which further expanded the scope to the planet Nebulon. It led on to the main title resurrecting Prime as a Powermaster.

In the United Kingdom, the mythology continued to grow. Primus is introduced as the creator of the Transformers, to serve his material body that is planet Cybertron and fight his nemesis Unicron. Female Autobot Arcee also appeared, despite the comic book stating the Transformers had no concept of gender, with her backstory of being built by the Autobots to quell human accusations of sexism. Soundwave, Megatron&#x27;s second-in-command, also breaks the fourth wall in the letters page, criticising the cartoon continuity as an inaccurate representation of history. The UK also had a crossover in &quot;Action Force&quot;, the UK counterpart to G.I. Joe. The comic book features a resurrected Megatron, whom Furman retconned to be a clone when he took over the U.S. comic book, which depicted Megatron as still dead. The U.S. comic would last for 80 issues until 1991, and the UK comic lasted 332 issues and several annuals, until it was replaced as Dreamwave Productions, later in the 20th century.

In 2009, Shout! Factory released the entire G1 series in a 16-DVD box set called the Matrix of Leadership Edition. They also released the same content as individual seasons.

====&quot;Transformers: Generation 2&quot; (1993–1995)====

It was five issues of the &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; comic in 1993 that would springboard a return for Marvel&#x27;s Transformers, with the new twelve-issue series &quot;&quot;, to market a new toy line.

This story reveals that the Transformers originally breed asexually, though it is stopped by Primus because it produced the evil Swarm. A new empire, neither Autobot nor Decepticon, is bringing it back, however. Though the year-long arc wrapped itself up with an alliance between Optimus Prime and Megatron, the final panel introduces the Liege Maximo, ancestor of the Decepticons. This minor cliffhanger was not resolved until 2001 and 2002&#x27;s Transforce convention when writer Simon Furman concluded his story in the exclusive novella &quot;Alignment&quot;.

====&quot;Beast Wars&quot; and &quot;Beast Machines&quot; (1996–2000)====

The story focuses on a small group of Maximals (the new Autobots), led by Optimus Primal, and Predacons, led by Megatron, 300 years after the &quot;Great War&quot;. After a dangerous pursuit through transwarp space, both the Maximal and Predacon factions end up crash landing on a primitive, uncivilized planet similar to Earth, but with two moons and a dangerous level of Energon (which is later revealed to &quot;be&quot; prehistoric Earth with an artificial second moon, taking place sometime during the 4 million year period in which the Autobots and Decepticons were in suspended animation from the first episode of the original Transformers cartoon), which forces them to take organic beast forms in order to function without going into stasis lock. After writing this first episode, Bob Forward and Larry DiTillio learned of the G1 Transformers and began to use elements of it as a historical backstory to their scripts, establishing &quot;Beast Wars&quot; as a part of the &quot;Generation 1&quot; universe through numerous callbacks to both the cartoon and the Marvel comic. By the end of the first season, the second moon and the Energon are revealed to have been constructed by a mysterious alien race known as the Vok.
The destruction of the second moon releases mysterious energies that make some of the characters &quot;transmetal&quot; and the planet is revealed to be prehistoric Earth, leading to the discovery of the &quot;Ark&quot;. Megatron attempts to kill the original Optimus Prime, but at the beginning of the third season, Primal manages to preserve his spark. In the two-season follow-up series, &quot;Beast Machines&quot;, Cybertron is revealed to have organic origins, which Megatron attempts to stamp out.

After the first season of &quot;Beast Wars&quot; (comprising 26 episodes) aired in Japan, the Japanese were faced with a problem. The second Canadian season was only 13 episodes long, not enough to warrant airing on Japanese TV. While they waited for the third Canadian season to be completed (thereby making 26 episodes in total when added to season 2), they produced two exclusive cel-animated series of their own, &quot;Beast Wars II&quot; (also called &quot;Beast Wars Second&quot;) and &quot;Beast Wars Neo,&quot; to fill in the gap. Dreamwave retroactively revealed &quot;Beast Wars&quot; to be the future of their G1 universe, and the 2006 IDW comic book &quot;Beast Wars: The Gathering&quot; eventually confirmed the Japanese series to be canon within a story set during Season 3.

Beast Wars contained elements from both the G1 cartoon series and comics. Attributes taken from the cartoon include Transformers that were female, the appearance of Starscream (who mentions being killed off by Galvatron in &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot;), and appearances of the Plasma Energy Chamber and Key to Vector Sigma. The naming of the Transformer ship, the &quot;Ark&quot; (and reference to 1984, the year the Transformers on board are revived), the character Ravage being shown as intelligent, and Cybertron having an organic core are elements taken from the comics.

In 2011, Shout! Factory released the complete series of &quot;Beast Wars&quot; on DVD.

====Dreamwave Productions (2001–2005)====
In 2001, Dreamwave Productions began a new universe of annual comics adapted from Marvel, but also included elements of the animated. The Dreamwave stories followed the concept of the Autobots defeating the Decepticons on Earth, but their 1997 return journey to Cybertron on the &quot;Ark II&quot; is destroyed by Shockwave, now ruler of the planet. The story follows on from there and was told in . The series also adds extra complexities such as not all Transformers believing in the existence of Primus, corruption in the Cybertronian government that first led Megatron to begin his war, and Earth having an unknown relevance to Cybertron.

Three &quot;&quot; limited series were also published. These are set at the beginning of the Great War, and identify Prime as once being a clerk named Optronix. &quot;Beast Wars&quot; was also retroactively stated as the future of this continuity, with the profile series &quot;More than Meets the Eye&quot; showing the Predacon Megatron looking at historical files detailing Dreamwave&#x27;s characters and taking his name from the original Megatron. In 2004, this real life universe also inspired three novels and a Dorling Kindersley guide, which focused on Dreamwave as the &quot;true&quot; continuity when discussing in-universe elements of the characters. In a new twist, Primus and Unicron are siblings, formerly a being known as the One. &quot;&quot;, set after the &quot;Ark&quot;&#x27;s disappearance, was also published. The real life universe was disrupted when Dreamwave went bankrupt in 2005. This left the &quot;Generation 1&quot; story hanging and the third volume of &quot;The War Within&quot; half finished. Plans for a comic book set between &quot;Beast Wars&quot; and &quot;Beast Machines&quot; were also left unrealized.

====&quot;G.I. Joe&quot; crossovers (2003–present)====
Throughout the years, the G1 characters have also starred in crossovers with fellow Hasbro property &quot;G.I. Joe&quot;, but whereas those crossovers published by Marvel were in continuity with their larger storyline, those released by Dreamwave and &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; publisher Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing occupy their own separate real life universes. In Devil&#x27;s Due, the terrorist organization COBRA Command is responsible for finding and reactivating the Transformers. Dreamwave&#x27;s version reimagines the familiar &quot;G1&quot; and &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; characters in a World War II setting, and a second limited series was released set in the present day, though Dreamwave&#x27;s bankruptcy meant it was cancelled after a single issue. Devil&#x27;s Due had Cobra re-engineer the Transformers to turn into familiar Cobra vehicles, and released further mini-series that sent the characters travelling through time, battling Serpentor and being faced with the combined menace of Cobra-La and Unicron. During this time, Cobra teams up with the Decepticons. IDW Publishing has expressed interest in their own crossover.

====IDW publishing (2005–2022)====

The following year, IDW Publishing rebooted the G1 series from scratch within various limited series and one shots. This allowed long-time writer of Marvel and Dreamwave comics, Simon Furman, to create his own universe without continuity hindrance, similar to Ultimate Marvel. This new continuity originally consisted of a comic book series titled The Transformers with a companion series known as The Transformers: Spotlight. The main series was broken up into several story arcs. Eventually, with IDW Publishing losing sales, the series was given a soft reboot. Beginning with &quot;All Hail Megatron&quot;, the series was set in a new direction, discarding the miniseries and Spotlight format with ongoing comics. By 2012 the series had split into three ongoing series; The Transformers: More Than Meets The Eye, The Transformers: Robots in Disguise (which later changed in 2015 to &quot;The Transformers&quot;) and The Transformers: Till All Are One. In 2022, it was announced that IDW lost the publishing rights to Transformers.

====Alternative stories====
In January 2006, the &quot;Hasbro Transformers Collectors&#x27; Club&quot; comic wrote a story based on the Transformers Classics toy line, set in the Marvel Comics universe, but excluding the &quot;Generation 2&quot; comic. Fifteen years after Megatron crash-lands in the &quot;Ark&quot; with Ratchet, the war continues with the characters in their &quot;Classics&quot; bodies.

IDW Publishing introduced &quot;The Transformers: Evolutions&quot; in 2006, a collection of mini-series that re-imagine and reinterpret the G1 characters in various ways. To date, only one miniseries has been published, &quot;Hearts of Steel&quot;, placing the characters in an Industrial Revolution-era setting. The series was delayed as Hasbro did not want to confuse newcomers with too many fictional universes before the release of the live-action film.

However, IDW and the original publisher Marvel Comics announced a crossover storyline with the Avengers to coincide with the film &quot;New Avengers/Transformers&quot;. The story is set on the borders of Symkaria and Latveria, and its fictional universe is set between the first two &quot;New Avengers&quot; storylines, as well in between the &quot;Infiltration&quot; and &quot;Escalation&quot; phase of IDW&#x27;s &quot;The Transformers&quot;. IDW editor-in-chief, Chris Ryall hinted at elements of it being carried over into the main continuities, and that a sequel is possible. In June 2018 it was announced there would be Star Trek and Transformers Crossover being released in September 2018.

====&quot;Transformers: Kiss Players&quot; (2006–2007)====
&quot;&quot; (トランスフォーマー キスぷれ, &quot;Toransufōmā Kisu Pure&quot;), shortened to &quot;Kiss Players&quot; (キスぷれ, &quot;Kisu Pure&quot;), is a Japanese Transformers franchise which began in 2006 to 2007 as was helmed by artist and writer Yuki Ohshima. By virtue of being the only Transformers toyline and fiction released in Japan by Takara between the conclusion of &quot;&quot; and the live-action movie, it was also effectively the main Transformers line in the country for that time. It takes place in the continuity, specifically in the five-year milieu between &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot; and &quot;Transformers 2010&quot;.

The series derives its name from its controversial gimmick, which involves Transformers getting &quot;power-ups&quot; when they are kissed by human girls - the eponymous &quot;Kiss Players&quot; - who fuse with the robots and share their adventures. The plot starts with the Earth Defense Command being formed in 2003 as part of a cooperative human/Autobot effort. When a virus called the Cosmic Rust critically struck the Autobots later that year, the EDC kicked off the Binaltech Project to shore up its defenses. When Galvatron was hurled out of Unicron by Rodimus Prime in 2005, rather than immediately crashing onto the intended target of the planet Thrull, he instead hurtled toward Earth. Landing in Tokyo, Japan, the Decepticon leader&#x27;s impact decimated the city and scattered his Unicron-mutated cells throughout Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Following this catastrophe, the EDC was reborn as an organization dedicated to driving all Transformers off Earth. The organization built an anti-electron field (previously referred to as an field) to make the planet uninhabitable to Cybertronians, and created a team of 48 transforming robots known as Autoroopers (オートルーパー Ōtorūpā), a Japanese portmanteau of &quot;auto&quot; (オート ōto) and &quot;trooper&quot; (トルーパー torūpā) or Autotroopers (aka Autobot Troopers) in English, are a group of human-created artificial Transformers that serve the Earth Defense Command to combat any other Transformers that remained, recruiting young women who had been infected with the cells and gained Kiss Player fusion abilities to partner with them.

The three central characters were a younger version of Marissa Faireborn as a resistance fighter against the EDC partnered with Optimus Prime who while having died in the movie, his body body was recovered and restored to life in a new body resembling that of a Dodge Ram pickup by the same organization. Rodimus devastated by his guilt in his role of the destruction of Tokyo stepped down as the then leader of the Autobots reverting to the previous name of Hot Rod in order to return to Earth to atone for his mistake. He&#x27;s refitted into a vehicle resembling a Ford GT by his headstrong partner Shaoshao Li, a girl of Chinese descent and an estranged friend of Marissa and used to be one of the EDC&#x27;s top Kiss Players until realizing that the EDC was conducting experiments behind her back on other girls. She was then rescued by Hot Rod and joins the resistance to combat the EDC and make amends with her former friend. Lastly, Atari Hitotonari of Japanese descent, who &quot;recruited&quot; into the EDC after the death of her parents while suffering from survivor&#x27;s guilt. She would shortly become depressed and self-destructive. As she spoke aloud about her nihilistic feelings she would meet her partner by the name Ne-04, a Autorooper built in the form resembling a Mazda RX-8 would shared the same feeling as she did though with the time they spend together their way of thinking would change throughout their relationship. While this plotline seems like a shift in demographics to little girls, it is said that this line was aimed at a much older adult male audience. The toys bear an &quot;ages 15 and up&quot; warning, and the subject matter of the accompanying manga is far from child-friendly. The franchise itself consists of a toyline, a weekly radio drama series (featuring voice acting by Lyrian as Marissa, Yui Kano as Shaoshao, Satomi Akesaka as Atari, and Keiji Hirai as Ne-04 among others), and a three part manga, which together tell the story of the line in which the toys and manga all of which were also created by Ohshima.

Following the conclusion of its first storyline in late 2007, &quot;Kiss Players&quot; moved into its second (and apparently final) phase, &quot;Kiss Players Position&quot;, which shifted focus to a distinctly more PG-rated theme, though it was still heavy on the &quot;cute girls&quot; theme. The Kiss Players this time are a pop idol singing group made up of the three girls and three original mini-cassette Transformers Glit, Sundor the former is a spy and the latter shows compassion to both allies and enemies, and Rosanna who&#x27;s the only heroic one out of the three. The group&#x27;s purpose is to promote a positive relationship and friendship between humans and Transformers in the wake of the Tokyo disaster of 2005 and the subsequent rise and fall of the E.D.C.. They wear E.D.C. logos on their costumes as a group, appearing to be either sponsored by or a public-relations arm of the revitalized organization.

Additionally, Ohshima&#x27;s other major contribution to &quot;Transformers&quot; at the time, the 1-page &quot;Information Administration Teletraan 15 Go! Go!&quot; comic published in &quot;Dengeki Hobby&quot; magazine, also featured several tie-ins to the &quot;Kiss Players&quot; story. These primarily served to introduce readers to the &quot;Kiss Players&quot; story and characters when the line was launched, and then later, to summarize the final few radio dramas when both series were drawing to a close. &quot;Information Administration Teletraan 15 Go! Go!&quot; also featured the first part of a story in which Starscream&#x27;s ghost possessed Atari (which was continued in the radio drama), and in the second year, notably incorporated the further adventures of the &quot;Kiss Players Position&quot; cassette trio, who were rather confusingly dropped from the radio storyline in its second week and never mentioned again.

Reactions ran the gamut from outright disgust to comedic derision, with most fans agreeing that the content such be included a children&#x27;s toyline was distasteful. The fact that several Japanese fans were themselves openly decrying &quot;Kiss Players&quot;, fearing that American fans would think that it was somehow accepted as normal in Japan regarding its sexually suggestive material. Oshima himself even admitted that he crafted the series in this manner because he wanted to &quot;make people&#x27;s jaws drop.&quot;

Many of its characters and ideas have made appearances in other &quot;Transformers&quot; media. The Autroopers appeared in &quot;&quot; in 2009 with an official toyline released in Botcon in 2011. The colors of white and blue used for Glit would inspire the &quot;&quot; incarnation of Ravage. A new toy figure of Sundor would be released under the &quot;Transformers Generations: The Fall of Cybertron&quot; line in 2012. Several ideas introduced into the 2007 storyline focusing on the introduction of Primus into the Japanese cartoon&#x27;s timeline have been revisited and expanded upon, which shares &quot;Kiss Players&quot; storytelling while attempting to fill in gaps of the timeline in the Japanese Generation 1 cartoon continuity. The &quot;Transformers Legends&quot; manga, while featuring lewd content and new stories and characters, also has the two returning and older characters of Atari and Shaoshao.

Possibly as a result of the majority of fans trying to distance themselves from the series combined with the then general inaccessibility of the radio show to an English audience, there was minimal awareness of the specific details of the &quot;Kiss Players&quot; storyline in the Japanese fandom. However, on July 19, 2022, most of the original media (including the radio dramas, manga, comic, and other materials) were recovered. This material was remastered and translated into English and released via torrent for download.

===&quot;Robots in Disguise&quot; (2000–2001)===

First broadcast in Japan in 2000, &quot;Robots in Disguise&quot; was a single animated series consisting of thirty-nine episodes. It was exported to other countries in subsequent years. In this continuity, Megatron re-creates the Decepticons as a sub-faction of the Predacons on Earth, a potential reference to the return to the vehicle-based characters following the previous dominance of the animal-based characters of the &quot;Beast&quot; eras. It is a stand-alone universe with no ties to any other Transformers fiction, though some of the characters from &quot;Robots in Disguise&quot; did eventually make appearances in &quot;Transformers: Universe&quot;, including Optimus Prime, Ultra Magnus, Side Burn and Prowl.

The show was heavily censored in the U.S. due to its content of buildings being destroyed and terrorism references after the September 11 attacks on the United States and three episodes were cut altogether.

===The Unicron Trilogy (2002–2006)===

These three lines, launched in 2002 and dubbed the &quot;Unicron Trilogy&quot; by &quot;Transformers&quot; designer Aaron Archer, are co-productions between Takara and (lesser extent) Hasbro, simultaneously released in both countries, each lasting 52 episodes. &quot;Armada&quot; followed the Autobots and Decepticons discovering the powerful Mini-Cons on Earth, which are revealed by the end to be weapons of Unicron. &quot;Energon&quot;, set ten years later, followed the Autobots and the Omnicons in their fight to stop the Decepticons and the Terrorcons from resurrecting Unicron with energon.

In Japan, the series &quot;Transformers: Cybertron&quot; showed no ties to the previous two series, telling its own story. This caused continuity problems when Hasbro sold &quot;Cybertron&quot; as a follow-up to &quot;Armada/Energon&quot;. The writers attempted to change certain plot elements from the Japanese version to remedy this, although this largely added up to nothing more than references to Unicron, Primus, Primes and Minicons.

Just as Marvel produced a companion comic to &quot;Generation 1&quot;, Dreamwave Productions published the comic &quot;Transformers Armada&quot; set in a different continuity from the cartoon. At #19, it became &quot;Transformers Energon&quot;. Dreamwave went bankrupt and ceased all publications before the storyline could be completed at #30. However, the Transformers Fan Club published a few stories set in the &quot;Cybertron&quot; era.

===&quot;Transformers: Universe&quot; (2003–present)===
The storyline of &quot;Transformers: Universe&quot;, mainly set following &quot;Beast Machines&quot;, sees characters from many assorted alternate continuities, including existing and new ones, encountering each other. The story was told in an unfinished comic book exclusive to the Official Transformers Collectors&#x27; Convention.

===Live-action film franchise (2007–present)===
In 2007, Michael Bay directed a live-action film based on &quot;Transformers&quot;, with Steven Spielberg serving as executive producer. It stars Shia LaBeouf, Josh Duhamel, Megan Fox, and Tyrese Gibson in the lead human cast while voice actors Peter Cullen and Hugo Weaving voice Optimus Prime and Megatron, respectively. &quot;Transformers&quot; received mixed to positive reviews and was a box office success. It is the forty-fifth highest-grossing film and the fifth highest-grossing film of 2007, grossing approximately $709 million worldwide. The film won four awards from the Visual Effects Society and was nominated for three Academy Awards, for Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects. The performance of Shia LaBeouf was praised by &quot;Empire&quot;, and Peter Cullen&#x27;s reprisal of Optimus Prime from the 1980s television series was well received by fans. A sequel, &quot;&quot;, was released on June 24, 2009. It received mostly negative reviews, but was a commercial success and grossed more than its predecessor. A third film, &quot;&quot;, was released on June 29, 2011, in 3-D and went on to gross over $1 billion, despite receiving mixed reviews. A fourth film, &quot;&quot;, was released on June 27, 2014, which also grossed over $1 billion, though it received generally negative reviews. A fifth film, &quot;&quot; was released on June 23, 2017 to similarly negative reviews. Unlike its predecessors, the movie failed to recoup its costs for the studio. &quot;Bumblebee&quot;, directed by Laika&#x27;s Travis Knight, was released on December 21, 2018, serving as a prequel to the first film, receiving positive reviews from critics. The movie was a box-office success. A sequel to &quot;Bumblebee&quot;, directed by Steven Caple Jr. and titled &quot;&quot;, was released on June 9, 2023 to mixed reviews from critics.

===&quot;Transformers: Animated&quot; (2007–2010)===

&quot;&quot; is a cartoon that was aired in early 2008 on Cartoon Network in the United States. Originally scheduled for late after 2007 under the title of &quot;Transformers: Heroes&quot;, &quot;Transformers Animated&quot; is set in 2050 Detroit (after crash landing 50 years earlier), when robots and humans live side by side. The Autobots come to Earth and assume superhero roles, battling evil humans, with the Decepticons having a smaller role until Megatron resurfaces. Main characters include Autobots Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Bulkhead, Prowl, and Ratchet; Decepticons Megatron, Starscream, Blitzwing, Lugnut, and Blackarachnia; and humans Professor Sumdac and Sari Sumdac. Several characters that were in the original Transformers cartoon and 1986 animated movie, as well as characters only seen in comics and such, make special appearances and cameos throughout the show, with various voice actors (including Corey Burton, John Moschitta, Jr., Susan Blu, and Judd Nelson) reprising their roles.

===Aligned Universe (2010–2021)===
Hasbro, in an attempt to stop the wave of reboots that started in 2001, created the Aligned Universe, with the intent to unify every &quot;Transformers&quot; media into one continuity. The name of this continuity however, is not official; it was adopted by the fans after Hasbro referred to it as an &quot;Aligned Continuity&quot;.

The toy lines derived from this continuity are &quot;Transformers: Generations&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Transformers Go!&quot; The television series belonging to the Aligned Universe include &quot;&quot; (including its concluding film &quot;Prime Beast Hunters: Predacons Rising&quot;), the &quot;Rescue Bots&quot; TV series, its sequel &quot;&quot;, the &quot;Go!&quot; anime adaptation, and the 2015 series &quot;&quot;.

The video games that are part of this shared universe are &quot;&quot; (including its and the companion &quot;&quot;), &quot;&quot;, the , and &quot;&quot;, that serves as a conclusion of the &quot;Cybertron&quot; series and crossover with the live-action film video game series.

Four novels set within the continuity have been published: &quot;Transformers: Exodus&quot;, &quot;Transformers: Exiles&quot;, &quot;Transformers: Retribution&quot;, and &quot;Transformers: The Covenant of Primus&quot;. The first three were published by Del Rey Books, while &quot;Covenant of Primus&quot; was published by 47North. In addition, IDW Publishing has published several comic books, including graphic novels, while Titan Magazines published &quot;Transformers Comic UK&quot;, a 20-issue series from 2007 to 2014.

The video games, novels, and television series contradict each other due to creative differences, miscommunications, constant team changes, and Aaron Archer being replaced with a different person that did not know the 354-page brand bible, &quot;The Binder of Revelation&quot;.

===&quot;Transformers: Prime Wars Trilogy&quot; (2016–2018)===

In August 2016, Machinima and Hasbro co-produced an animated series named &quot;Combiner Wars&quot;, simultaneously published on the website Go90 and YouTube. This was followed by two further installments, &quot;Titans Return&quot; and &quot;Power of the Primes&quot;.

The trailer for &quot;Combiner Wars&quot; was released on July 26, 2016, along with four prequel episodes. Eight five-minute episodes of the series &quot;Combiner Wars&quot; were released weekly beginning on August 2. The cast of the &quot;Combiner Wars&quot; was predominantly made up of famous YouTube personalities. The first series was included as a bonus feature on the &quot;Transformers: The Last Knight&quot; Blu-ray release.

FJ DeSanto was executive producer of the third installment. Animation was done by Tatsunoko Productions. &quot;Power of the Primes&quot; focused on the arrival of Megatronus, one of the original Primes. In 2019, Machinima shut down and folded into Otter Media. On January 19, Machinima removed all of its videos from YouTube, including those of the Prime Wars Trilogy. After the shutdown, a number of former Machinima creations returned to the web via Rooster Teeth. The series is available on the Rooster Teeth website.

The first season of ten episodes was released on March 25, 2022. In a departure from the traditional conflict between the Autobots and Decepticons seen in most continuities, the series focuses on the BotBots, small robots organized in groups of tribes who can transform into everyday objects, and primarily follows the efforts of the Lost Bots, who try to find their own place amongst the others.

===&quot;Transformers: EarthSpark&quot; (2022–present)===

&quot;Transformers: EarthSpark&quot; is an animated television series produced by Entertainment One and Nickelodeon Animation Studio for the streaming service Paramount+ and the television network Nickelodeon, which debuted on November 11, 2022. &quot;EarthSpark&quot; is notable for prominently featuring humans after being mostly absent in various media of the franchise in the late 2010s such as &quot;Cyberverse&quot;, the 2019 IDW comics and &quot;War for Cybertron Trilogy&quot;, and uses a union voice cast for the first time since 2018.

=== &quot;Transformers One&quot; (2024) ===

Upon the establishment of a writers&#x27; room for devising ideas regarding future &quot;Transformers&quot; films in 2015, the duo of Andrew Barrer and Gabriel Ferrari immediately conceived the concept of an animated prequel film depicting the beginnings of the Autobot-Decepticon war on Cybertron. The film is directed by Josh Cooley, who oversaw the story treatment by Barrer and Ferrari with additional script contributions by Eric Pearson. The film&#x27;s narrative is centered on the respective origin stories of Optimus Prime and Megatron, chroncling their early friendship as Energon miners named Orion Pax and D-16, and the rift that causes their evolution into the respective leaders of the Autobots and Decepticons, beginning their long-standing conflict. Chris Hemsworth and Brian Tyree Henry lead the film&#x27;s ensemble voice cast as Orion Pax and D-16 respectively, alongside Scarlett Johansson, Keegan-Michael Key, Jon Hamm and Laurence Fishburne. The film&#x27;s score was composed by Brian Tyler, returning to the franchise after previously scoring &quot;Transformers: Prime&quot;. &quot;Transformers One&quot; released in September 2024, and received positive critical reception despite financially underperforming at the box office, grossing $124.2 million worldwide against a budget estimated to be between $75–147 million. Despite this, producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura expressed the desire for the film to launch a potential trilogy, confirming that the story was mapped out to illustrate a multi-film progression of the characters towards their traditional depictions in other media, such as the live-action films. By the film&#x27;s release, di Bonaventura confirmed that the filmmakers were already outlining plans for a sequel, and that it would be produced if the film is considered successful.

<text>Alvis Car and Engineering Company Ltd was a British manufacturing company in Coventry from 1919 to 1967. In addition to automobiles designed for the civilian market, the company also produced racing cars, aircraft engines, armoured cars and other armoured fighting vehicles.

Car manufacturing ended after the company became a subsidiary of Rover in 1965, but armoured vehicle manufacture continued. Alvis became part of British Leyland and then in 1982 was sold to United Scientific Holdings, which renamed itself Alvis plc.

In 2023, its successor company began manufacturing the brand’s classic models again.

==History of the company==



===Early history===
The original company, T. G. John and Company Ltd., was founded in 1919 by Thomas George John (1880–1946). Its first products were stationary engines, carburetors and motorscooters. Following complaints from the Avro aircraft company whose logo bore similarities to the original winged green triangle, the more familiar inverted red triangle incorporating the word &quot;Alvis&quot; evolved. On 14 December 1921 the company officially changed its name to The Alvis Car and Engineering Company Ltd. Geoffrey de Freville (1883–1965) designed the first Alvis engine and is also responsible for the company name.

The origin of the name &quot;Alvis&quot; has been the subject of a great deal of speculation over the years. Some have suggested that de Freville proposed the name &quot;Alvis&quot; as a compound of the words &quot;aluminium&quot; and &quot;vis&quot; (meaning &quot;strength&quot; in Latin), or perhaps it may have been derived from the Norse mythological weaponsmith, Alvíss. De Freville vigorously rejected all of these theories. In 1921 he specifically stated that the name had no meaning whatsoever, and was chosen simply because it could be easily pronounced in any language. He reaffirmed this position in the early 1960s, stating that any other explanations for the source of the name were purely coincidental.

Production was relocated to Holyhead Road in Coventry, where from 1922 to 1923 they also made the Buckingham car. In 1922 George Thomas Smith-Clarke (1884–1960) left his job as assistant works manager at Daimler and joined Alvis as chief engineer and works manager. Smith-Clarke was accompanied by William M. Dunn, who left his job as a draughtsman at Daimler to become chief draughtsman at Alvis. This partnership lasted for nearly 28 years and was responsible for producing some of the most successful products in the company&#x27;s history. Smith-Clarke left in 1950, and Dunn assumed Smith-Clarke&#x27;s position as chief engineer, remaining in that position until 1959.

De Freville&#x27;s first engine design was a four-cylinder engine with aluminium pistons and pressure lubrication, which was unusual for that time. The first car model using de Freville&#x27;s engine was the Alvis 10/30. It was an instant success and established the reputation for quality workmanship and superior performance for which the company was to become famous. The original 10/30 side-valve engine was improved, becoming by 1923 the overhead valve Alvis 12/50, a highly successful sports car that was produced until 1932. Around 700 of the 12/50 models and 120 of the later Alvis 12/60 models survive today.

1927 saw the introduction of the six-cylinder Alvis 14.75. This engine became the basis for the long line of luxurious six-cylinder Alvis cars produced up to the outbreak of the Second World War. These cars were elegant and full of technical innovations. Independent front suspension and the world&#x27;s first all-synchromesh gearbox came in 1933 followed by servo-assisted brakes. The Alvis 12/75 model was introduced in 1928, a model bristling with innovation, such as front-wheel drive, in-board brakes, overhead camshaft, and, as an option, a Roots type supercharger.

As with many upmarket engineering companies of the time, Alvis did not produce their own coachwork, relying instead on the many available coachbuilders in the Midlands area, such as Carbodies, Charlesworth Bodies, Cross &amp; Ellis, Duncan Industries, E. Bertelli Ltd, Holbrook, Grose, Gurney Nutting, Hooper, Lancefield Coachworks, Martin Walter, Mayfair Carriage Co, Mulliners, Tickford, Vanden Plas, Weymann Fabric Bodies, and Arnold of Manchester. Several cars also survive with quite exotic one-off bodywork from other designers.

In 1936 the company name was shortened to Alvis Ltd, and aircraft engine and armoured vehicle divisions were added to the company by the beginning of the Second World War. Smith-Clarke designed several models during the 1930s and 1940s, including the six-cylinder Speed 20, the Speed 25, and the Alvis 4.3 Litre model.

===Second World War===
Car production was initially suspended in September 1939 following the outbreak of war in Europe. It later resumed and production of the 12/70, Crested Eagle, Speed 25, and 4.3 Litre continued well into 1940. The car factory was severely damaged on 14 November 1940 as a result of several bombing raids on Coventry by the German Luftwaffe, although the armaments factory suffered little damage. Much valuable cutting gear and other equipment was lost and car production was suspended for the duration of the war, only resuming during the latter part of 1946. Despite this, Alvis carried out war production on aircraft engines (as sub-contractor of Rolls-Royce Limited) and other aircraft equipment in its shadow factories.

===Post war===

Car production resumed with a four-cylinder model, the TA 14, based on the pre-war 12/70. A solid, reliable and attractive car, the TA 14 fitted well the mood of sober austerity in post-war Britain, but much of the magic attaching to the powerful and sporting pre-war models had gone and life was not easy for a specialist car manufacturer. Not only had Alvis lost their car factory but many of the pre-war coachbuilders had not survived either and those that had were quickly acquired by other manufacturers. The post-war history of Alvis was dominated by the quest for reliable and reasonably priced coachwork.

===1950s===
Smith-Clarke retired in 1950 and Dunn took over as chief engineer. Before retiring Smith-Clarke came up with the Alvis 3L3, TA21 prototype in 1947, TA14 body with a six-cylinder 3-litre engine, after retiring he used the prototype Alvis 3L3 as his personal car. In 1950 a new chassis based on the TA14 and six-cylinder 3–litre engine was announced and this highly successful engine became the basis of all Alvis models until production ceased in 1967. 

Saloon bodies for the TA 21, as the new model was called, again came from Mulliners of Birmingham as they had for the TA 14, with Tickford producing the dropheads. With Mulliners committing themselves in October 1954 to supply only Standard Triumph, which purchased Mulliners in 1958, and Tickford being acquired by David Brown, owner of Aston Martin Lagonda in late 1955, it was becoming clear that new arrangements would have to be made. Some of the most original and beautiful designs on the Three Litre chassis were being produced by master coachbuilder Carrosserie Hermann Graber of Switzerland. These often one-off–designed cars are highly sought after today. 

Graber had begun to use TA 14 chassis soon after the war, building three &quot;Tropic&quot; coupés which were much admired. When the Three Litre chassis was introduced, his bodies displayed at the Geneva Motor Shows in 1951 and 1952 attracted sufficient interest for Graber to set up a standing order of 30 chassis per year. Swiss-built Graber coupés were displayed on the Alvis stand at both Paris and London Motor Shows in October 1955.

With a licence in place, from late 1955 all Alvis bodies became based on Graber designs, but few chassis and few bodies were built over the next two years. Around 15 or 16 TC108/Gs were built by Willowbrook Limited of Loughborough and Willowbrook was subsequently taken over by Duple Coachbuilders. Over the same two years Graber built 22 TC 108Gs and complained that if he had received chassis he would have committed himself to buying 20 a year. 

Only after late 1958 with the launch of the TD 21 did something resembling full-scale production resume as Rolls-Royce subsidiary Park Ward began to build the new bodies now modified in many small ways. These cars, the TD 21 and its later variants, the TE 21 and finally the TF 21 are well built, attractive and fast cars. However it was clear by the mid-1960s that with a price tag of nearly double that of the mass-produced Jaguar, the end could not be far off.

From 1952 to 1955 Alec Issigonis, the creator of the later Mini, worked for Alvis and designed a new model with a V8 engine which proved too expensive to produce.

===1960s===
Rover took a controlling interest in Alvis in 1965. A Rover-designed mid-engined V8 coupé prototype named the P6BS was rumoured to be the new Alvis model, but with the takeover by British Leyland this too was shelved. By the time the TF 21 was launched in 1966, available, like its predecessors in both saloon and drophead form and with either manual or automatic gearbox, the model was beginning to show its age despite a top speed of 127 mph – the fastest Alvis ever produced. With only 109 sold and with political troubles aplenty in the UK car manufacturing business at that time, production ceased in 1967.

In 1968, a management buyout of the car operations was finalised and all the Alvis car design plans, customer records, stock of parts and remaining employees were transferred to Red Triangle, a company founded by ex-employees of Alvis to provide parts and service for their cars.

===1970s to 2004===
As part of Rover, Alvis Limited was incorporated into British Leyland but was bought by United Scientific Holdings plc in 1981. Subsequently, the company&#x27;s name was changed to Alvis plc. Alvis plc acquired British truck manufacturer Universal Power Drives in 1994, naming their new subsidiary Alvis Unipower Limited. The trucks were subsequently branded as Alvis-Unipower. 

In 1998, Alvis plc acquired the armoured vehicle business of GKN plc, and the main UK manufacturing operation was moved from Coventry to Telford. The site of the Alvis works in Holyhead Road is now an out-of-town shopping complex, but its name, Alvis Retail Park, reflects the heritage of the site. In 2002 Alvis plc purchased Vickers Defence Systems to form the subsidiary Alvis Vickers Ltd, which was in turn purchased by BAE Systems in 2004. BAE Systems ended the use of the Alvis distinctive red triangle trademark.

In 2009, Red Triangle negotiated the legal transfer of the Alvis car trademarks. The following year, the company announced that the 4.3 Litre Short Chassis tourer would once again be available. All Alvis&#x27; records remain intact at the company&#x27;s Kenilworth headquarters along with a large stock of period parts. One of the men to have worked on the last Alvis car produced in 1967 is still retained by Red Triangle in a training capacity. 

Built to the original plans, the new car has been named the &quot;Continuation Series&quot;, to reflect the 73-year interruption in its production between 1937 and 2010. It differs only in detail from the pre-war examples: for emissions, the engine is governed by an electronic fuel injection system with electronic ignition, brakes are hydraulic rather than cable, the steering column collapsible and the rear light arrangement reconfigured to conform to modern standards.

==Revived company==
In 2012 Alvis announced it would offer five variants of its cars. These included both 4.3 litre and 3 litre chassis derivatives. In 2019, a sixth model was released to coincide with the agreement for Meiji Sangyo to be the distributor for Asia.

In 2021, the firm was featured in the BBC Four documentary &quot;Classic British Cars: Made in Coventry&quot; and released its Graber Super Coupe continuation car, with a convertible version due out in 2022.

===Racing cars===
Three British car companies – Alvis, Bentley, and Sunbeam – entered vehicles in local racing events between 1920 and 1930. Alvis and Sunbeam were at that time the only British companies building cars to Grand Prix formula racing specifications. Of these, Alvis was the only company whose racing cars were characterized by front-wheel drive and fully independent suspension.

Alvis was a pioneer of front-wheel drive vehicles. While J. Walter Christie had designed the first front-wheel drive racing car, which he drove in the 1906 Vanderbilt Cup, the next notable front-wheel drive race car was the supercharged Alvis 12/50 racing car designed by G. T. Smith-Clarke and W. M. Dunn, which was entered in the 1925 Kop Hill Climb in Princes Risborough in Buckinghamshire on 28 March 1925. Two months later (on Saturday, 30 May 1925), Harry Arminius Miller&#x27;s Miller 122 front-wheel drive car was entered in the 1925 Indianapolis 500.

==Alvis aircraft engines==
The initial Alvis aero-engines were licence-built Gnome-Rhone radials. The first aero-engine designed and built by Alvis was the 14-cylinder Alvis Pelides radial in 1936. Development of this and related engines (Pelides Major, Alcides, Alcides Major, Maeonides Major) was stopped with the start of the Second World War with only a handful built.

The Alvis Leonides, a smaller 9-cylinder radial, continued in development during the war and was used after the war in some aircraft and helicopters until production finished in 1966. In 1952, Alvis returned to 14-cylinder radials with a development of the Leonides as the Leonides Major. The Major was used in the Westland Whirlwind helicopter.

==Alvis military vehicles==
The Hungarian automotive engineer Nicholas Straussler had designed an armoured car (AC1) in 1932, which was built by the Manfred Weiss company under licence in Budapest. When Hungary aligned itself with Germany soon afterwards, Straussler emigrated to England. Straussler&#x27;s small new company, Straussler Mechanisations Ltd, lacked the necessary resources and capacity to build the vehicle on a large scale, so Straussler approached Alvis, and Alvis-Straussler Ltd, a short-lived joint venture company, was formed in July 1936. 

The prototype vehicle produced, the Alvis Straussler AC2, was built upon the AC1 chassis. The first AC3 – the first operational purpose-built armoured car ever produced – was delivered in 1937 by Alvis-Straussler Ltd, built upon the AC2 prototype. Twenty-seven vehicles were built: 12 for the Royal Air Force, 3 for the Portuguese Army, and 12 for the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army.
The AC2 was subsequently used as a basis for the 39M Csaba armoured scout car built for the Royal Hungarian Army during the Second World War.

*Alvis-Straussler light medium tank (Alvis-Straussler Ltd., 1937)
*Hefty gun tractor (Alvis Mechanisation Ltd., 1937)
*LAC armoured car (Alvis Mechanisation Ltd., 1938)

In 1938 Alvis Mechanisations was formed to take over the obligations of Alvis-Straussler Ltd. 
In 1938, Alvis produced a prototype armoured light reconnaissance vehicle for comparison trials with other manufacturers. The Alvis Dingo lost out to a design by BSA Cycles but &#x27;Dingo&#x27; was adopted as the name for the BSA design; which was built by a BSA subsidiary as the Daimler Dingo.

Post-war, Alvis designed a series of six-wheel drive vehicles. The Saladin (FV601) armoured car and Saracen armoured personnel carrier were first. The Saracen was built as a number of related vehicles including FV604 Regimental Command Vehicle, and FV610 Armoured Command Post. The Salamander was an airfield crash tender. It was subsequently used as a basis for the Stalwart amphibious military truck. The FV611 model was also built to serve as an armoured ambulance.

The FV432 tracked armoured personnel carrier and related vehicles was developed in the early 1960s by GKN Sankey and came under Alvis in 1998.

The Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) family of tracked vehicles were designed in the 1960s. The family includes the FV101 Scorpion, FV102 Striker, FV103 Spartan, FV104 Samaritan, FV105 Sultan, FV106 Samson, FV107 Scimitar, FV4333 Stormer, and the Streaker. The first vehicle of this series was the FV101 Scorpion, which was the first aluminium hull tank ever to be built. The hull and turret are actually fabricated from a welded aluminium-zinc-magnesium alloy. Seventeen Scorpion prototypes were delivered for field testing in February 1969.

==Alvis ownership==
More than 20 per cent of all Alvis cars ever manufactured were still in existence in 1989. The Alvis Owner Club, founded in 1951, is a club for all Alvis car and military vehicle enthusiasts. It has over 1,300 members. It hosts International Weekends annually, where owners from the UK and overseas display their cars.

The Alvis Register is a club with more than 600 members, dedicated to all things related to vintage Alvis motor cars (1920–1932). Members can access technical and historical information and share their interest with other Alvis enthusiasts. Most owners retain an eligible car or cars.

One platform serves as a boarding platform for &quot;Skyliner&quot;, &quot;Cityliner&quot;, and &quot;Eveningliner&quot; limited express services, while the other as a boarding platform for regular commuter trains. Ueno-bound trains continue to discharge on the original platform on the lower level.



===JR platforms===
There are no platforms for tracks 5 to 8, which are for non-stop Takasaki Line and Utsunomiya Line trains.



===Nippori-Toneri platforms===
The Nippori-Toneri Liner station is elevated and consists of a single island platform serving two tracks.

==History==
The JR station first opened on 1 April 1905. The Keisei station opened on 19 December 1931.

A new elevated platform for Keisei services opened on 3 October 2009. Station numbering was introduced to all Keisei Line stations on 17 June 2010 with Nippori being assigned station number KS02.

Station numbering was introduced in 2016 with Nippori being assigned station numbers JY07 for the Yamanote line, JK32 for the Keihin-Tōhoku line, and JJ02 for the Joban Line rapid service. At the same time, JR East assigned a three-letter code to their major interchange station; Nippori was assigned the three-letter code &quot;NPR&quot;. Station numbering was expanded to the Nippori-Toneri Liner platforms in November 2017 with the station receiving station number NT02.

<text>Beverly Hills Cop II is a 1987 American buddy cop action comedy film directed by Tony Scott, written by Larry Ferguson and Warren Skaaren, and starring Eddie Murphy. It is the sequel to the 1984 film &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; and the second installment in the &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; film series. Murphy returns as Detroit police detective Axel Foley, who reunites with Beverly Hills detectives Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and John Taggart (John Ashton) to stop a criminal organization after Captain Andrew Bogomil (Ronny Cox) is shot and seriously wounded.

The film was released on May 20, 1987 by Paramount Pictures. It received mixed reviews from critics on release, but it was a box office success, grossing $299 million worldwide, making it the highest grossing film of the &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; film series. Additionally, the film was nominated for an Oscar, as well as a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, for Bob Seger&#x27;s &quot;Shakedown&quot;. Two sequels, &quot;Beverly Hills Cop III&quot; and &quot;Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F&quot;, were released in 1994 and 2024.

==Plot==
Two years after the events of the first film, Beverly Hills Police Department Captain Andrew Bogomil, Detective Billy Rosewood, and Sergeant John Taggart are investigating a series of high-value robberies called the Alphabet Crimes. At each crime scene is left an encrypted letter marked with an alphabetic character distinctive to each heist. Complicating matters is the new political state of the Beverly Hills PD led by the egotistical, incompetent and verbally abusive new police chief Harold Lutz, who suspends Bogomil in retaliation for Rosewood contacting the FBI for assistance, using Mayor Ted Egan&#x27;s political ambitions as an excuse. Lutz also punishes Rosewood and Taggart by demoting them to traffic duty. On his way home, Bogomil is lured into a trap by ruthless henchwoman Karla Fry, the chief enforcer of mastermind Maxwell Dent and left with near-fatal gunshot wounds and a letter marked &quot;B&quot;.

Learning of Bogomil&#x27;s attack on a news report, Detroit police detective Axel Foley travels to Beverly Hills to investigate who attacked Bogomil and why. Reviewing expertly modified bullet casings from the &quot;A&quot; jewelry heist, Axel investigates a local gunclub where he learns that similar casings were made for the club&#x27;s manager Charles Cain. Furious that Cain used weapons that could be traced to the club, Dent, who is his boss, orders Cain to kill Axel.

The assassination attempt by Cain&#x27;s men fails but Axel recovers a matchbook, from which he recovers Cain&#x27;s fingerprint, and breaks into the gunclub at night, finding a set of coordinates. The coordinates lead Axel, Rosewood, and Taggart to the city deposit, the &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; crime. They successfully foil the robbery, and pursue the perpetrators&#x27; armored car through Beverly Hills in a cement mixer truck, causing large amounts of collateral damage. Though they lose the truck, Axel, Rosewood, and Taggart trace the escape vehicle to the Playboy Mansion and infiltrate it, confronting Karla and Dent.

Axel learns from Dent&#x27;s accountant Sidney Bernstein that Dent and Karla are planning to leave the country to Costa Rica, while Bogomil&#x27;s daughter Jan discovers that Dent&#x27;s companies are financially struggling and he has allowed the insurance to lapse on all of them except for his racetrack, Empyrean Fields. Deciphering the &quot;D&quot; letter, Axel learns that it is signed Carlos and realizes Dent is framing Cain for the crimes. Karla and her men rob the race track and kill Cain. Lutz publicly announces that the Alphabet Crimes have been solved, but Axel notices red mud at the stables, identical to traces he found on Bogomil&#x27;s running shoes. This leads him, Taggart, and Rosewood to Dent&#x27;s oil field, where Dent is using the $10million raised from his crimes to purchase weapons from arms dealer Nikos Thomopolis.

Axel, Rosewood, and Taggart get into a shootout and manage to destroy the trucks carrying the shipments with explosives. Dent confronts Axel in the warehouse, but Axel gets distracted by one of Dent&#x27;s henchmen on the roof above him so Dent gets away. Dent then crashes through the wall with his car and Axel kills him by shooting him through the windshield. The car hits Axel and goes down a hill, erupting in flames. Karla appears and is about to kill him but is shot dead by Taggart.

Just as the last criminals are about to flee, the police backup arrive and apprehend Thomopolis and the remainder of Dent&#x27;s gang. Lutz and Mayor Egan arrive as well; Lutz is furious at Rosewood and Taggart for their insubordination, but the pair stand up to him and prove that Dent was the real Alphabet Bandit and that his crimes were about the arms deal. They also convince Mayor Egan of Lutz&#x27;s incompetence, prompting the mayor to fire Lutz for jeopardizing the investigation and his abusive attitude towards his officers. Mayor Egan also fires Lutz&#x27;s assistant Biddle, for not speaking up against Lutz and thanks the trio for solving the case.

Following his recovery, Bogomil is chosen to become the new police chief. As Axel prepares to return to Detroit, Mayor Egan calls Axel&#x27;s superior Inspector Todd to thank him for Axel&#x27;s assistance, prompting Todd to chew him out over the phone and order him to return to Detroit for his real police job.

==Cast==
==Production==
Paramount Pictures had planned a television series based on the first film. Murphy turned down the series but was willing to do a sequel. Producers Simpson and Bruckheimer hired Tony Scott to direct due to his success with the 1986 blockbuster film &quot;Top Gun&quot;. The film was originally to be set and filmed in London and Paris; however, the script was re-written after Murphy expressed a reluctance to film outside the United States.

Eddie Murphy&#x27;s salary to star in the movie was $8 million. The budget of the movie was $27 million. Ronny Cox was going to have more screen time in the film, but couldn&#x27;t due to his role in &quot;RoboCop&quot;. Filming began on November 10, 1986, and concluded on March 25, 1987, after 135 days of filming.

Film editor Billy Weber said:&quot;Marty Brest had passed on the sequel, and Tony was available. But, he wasn&#x27;t a comedy guy, so after we ran the first cut, Don and Jerry just looked around, and shrugged, and said, &quot;Huh.&quot; It wasn&#x27;t a comedy – it played like a straight action movie, which made sense, because Tony was an action guy, and that&#x27;s what he knew how to do best, so it was really action heavy. We just never had a great script, and it never had a chance of being as good as the first movie because the script never got there. They re-wrote the script after the first screening and more jokes were shot and added in, and it brought it up a little bit. Eddie also started to act up on the set, the primadonna behavior was starting to show, and he was always late for filming, but he got along great with Tony.&quot;

==Soundtrack==

The song &quot;Hold On&quot; as sung by Keta Bill plays during the scene wherein Axel, Rosewood and Taggart confront Dent at the Playboy Mansion. However, the film&#x27;s soundtrack album, released by MCA Records, includes only a different version sung by Corey Hart, with different lyrics. The film introduced George Michael&#x27;s controversial song &quot;I Want Your Sex&quot;, a number 2 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It also includes &quot;Cross My Broken Heart&quot; by The Jets (a Top 10 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100) and &quot;Shakedown&quot; by Bob Seger (which became a 1 hit on that same chart), as well as &quot;Better Way&quot; performed by James Ingram. The Pointer Sisters scored a moderate hit with &quot;Be There&quot; (#42 on the Hot 100), their single from the soundtrack. It was the second time the sisters had contributed to the &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; franchise; they&#x27;d notched a top 10 single with &quot;Neutron Dance&quot; from the &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; soundtrack. Harold Faltermeyer&#x27;s 1988 album, &quot;Harold F&quot;, includes a song called &quot;Bad Guys&quot;, which is used as part of the film&#x27;s score—an instrumental section of the song plays during the opening jewelry store robbery scene, and also during several other scenes throughout the film.

The soundtrack reached 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums charts and spent 26 weeks on the charts, a far cry compared to the 49 weeks spent by the first film&#x27;s soundtrack. Despite this, one song from the album, &quot;Shakedown&quot;, was nominated for an Academy Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. However, another song from the album, &quot;I Want Your Sex&quot;, won the Razzie Award for Worst Song, despite it going on to achieve a platinum certification for sales by the Recording Industry Association of America.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot; was one of the most anticipated films of 1987 and became a box office success upon release. The film debuted at number one at the US box office, earning $26.3 million on its three-day opening weekend and $33 million over the four-day Memorial Day weekend, a sales mark that would result in the film achieving that year&#x27;s highest-opening weekend debut, as well as the highest three-day opening weekend of all time at the time, surpassing the $25.3 million earned by &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; in 1984. &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot; grossed $153,665,036 in the United States and Canada, becoming the third biggest hit domestically at the box office that year, after &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; and &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot;, and grossed $276.6 million worldwide, the second highest-grossing film worldwide that year, behind &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;.

===Critical reception===
The film received mixed reviews from critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;a sequel that&#x27;s as good as the original, if not better.&quot; Roger Ebert gave the film one star out of four and wrote, &quot;What is comedy? That&#x27;s a pretty basic question, I know, but &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot; never thought to ask it.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film is a skillful clone of the first film that cannot match that one&#x27;s novelty or excitement. &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a noisy, numbing, unimaginative, heartless remake of the original film.&quot; Sheila Benson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to believe that the group who came up with the hard, clean edges of &quot;Top Gun&quot;, sleek and unfeeling though it may have been, could make a picture as crude, as muddled, as destructo-Derbyish as this one.&quot;

&quot;&quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot; was probably the most successful mediocre picture in history,&quot; Murphy said. &quot;It made $250 million worldwide, and it was a half-assed movie. &quot;Cop II&quot; was basically a rehash of &quot;Cop I&quot;, but it wasn&#x27;t as spontaneous and funny [as the original].&quot;

<text>Robert Smith Surtees (17 May 180516 March 1864) was an English editor, novelist and sporting writer, widely known as R. S. Surtees. He was the second son of Anthony Surtees of Hamsterley Hall, a member of an old County Durham family. He is remembered for his invented character of Jorrocks, a vulgar but good-natured sporting cockney grocer.

==Early life==
Surtees attended a school at Ovingham and then Durham School, before being articled in 1822 to Robert Purvis, a solicitor in Newcastle upon Tyne.

==Career==
Surtees left for London in 1825, intending to practise law in the capital, but had difficulty making his way and began contributing to the &quot;Sporting Magazine&quot;. He launched out on his own with the &quot;New Sporting Magazine&quot; in 1831, contributing the comic papers which appeared as &quot;Jorrocks&#x27; Jaunts and Jollities&quot; in 1838. Jorrocks, the sporting cockney grocer, with his vulgarity and good-natured artfulness, was a great success with the public, and Surtees produced more Jorrocks novels in the same vein, notably &quot;Handley Cross&quot; and &quot;Hillingdon Hall&quot;, where the description of the house is very reminiscent of Hamsterley. Another hero, Soapey Sponge, appears in &quot;Mr Sponge&#x27;s Sporting Tour&quot;, possibly Surtees&#x27;s best work. 
All Surtees&#x27;s novels were composed at Hamsterley Hall, where he wrote standing up at a desk, like Victor Hugo.

In 1835, Surtees abandoned his legal practice and, after inheriting Hamsterley Hall in 1838, devoted himself to hunting and shooting, meanwhile writing anonymously for his own pleasure. He was a friend and admirer of the great hunting man Ralph Lambton, who had his headquarters at Sedgefield, County Durham, the &quot;Melton of the North&quot;. Surtees became Lord High Sheriff of Durham in 1856. 
He died in Brighton in 1864, and was buried in Ebchester church.

Though Surtees did not set his novels in any readily identifiable locality, he uses North East place-names like Sheepwash, Howell (How) Burn, and Winford Rig. His memorable Geordie James Pigg, in &quot;Handley Cross&quot;, is based on Joe Kirk, a Slaley huntsman. The famous incident, illustrated by Leech, when Pigg jumps into the melon frame was inspired by a similar episode involving Kirk in Corbridge. 
As a creator of comic personalities, Surtees is still readable today. William Makepeace Thackeray envied him his powers of observation, while William Morris considered him &quot;a master of life&quot; and ranked him with Charles Dickens. The novels are engaging and vigorous, and abound with sharp social observation, with a keener eye than Dickens for the natural world. Perhaps Surtees most resembles the Dickens of &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;, which was originally intended as mere supporting matter for a series of sporting illustrations to rival Jorrocks.

Most of Surtees&#x27;s later novels, were illustrated by John Leech. They included &quot;Mr Sponge&#x27;s Sporting Tour&quot; (1853), &quot;Ask Mamma&quot; (1858), &quot;Plain or Ringlets?&quot; (1860) and &quot;Mr Facey Romford&#x27;s Hounds&quot; (1865). The last of these novels appeared posthumously.

In 1841, Surtees married Elizabeth Jane Fenwick (1818–1879), daughter of Addison Fenwick of Bishopwearmouth, by whom he had one son Anthony (1847–1871) and two daughters. His younger daughter Eleanor married John Vereker, afterwards 5th Viscount Gort. Their son was Field Marshal Lord Gort, commander of the BEF in France in 1940.

==Influences on others==
The character &quot;Stalky&quot; (based on Lionel Dunsterville) from Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Stalky &amp; Co.&quot; (1899) has Surtees&#x27;s &quot;Handley Cross&quot; by heart and quotes from it repeatedly.

The novels of Surtees are mentioned several times in Siegfried Sassoon&#x27;s 1928 autobiographical novel &quot;Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man&quot;.

Mr. Jorrocks&#x27; phrase &quot;my beloved &#x27;earers&quot; often appears in the speech of children in the books of Monica Marsden.

Anthony Blanche, as he prepares Charles Ryder for their dinner outing to Thame in &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; (1945), says that they will &quot;imagine ourselves…where? Not on a j-j-jaunt with J-J-Jorrocks anyway.&quot;

&quot;There were &quot;Jorrocks&#x27; Jaunts and Jollities&quot;; there were Soapey Sponge and Mrs. Asquith&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs&quot; and &quot;Big Game Shooting in Nigeria&quot;, all spread open.&quot; From &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; by Virginia Woolf.

==Legacy==
Surtees was not among the most popular novelists in the nineteenth century. His work lacked the self-conscious idealism, sentimentality and moralism of the Victorian era; the historian Norman Gash asserted that &quot;His leading male characters were coarse or shady; his leading ladies dashing and far from virtuous; his outlook on society satiric to the point of cynicism.&quot; Thomas Seccombe, writing in 1898 for the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, said that it was the illustrations of Leech that gave Surtees&#x27; work any notability:The coarseness of the text was redeemed in 1854 by the brilliantly humorous illustrations of John Leech, who utilised a sketch of a coachman made in church as his model for the ex-grocer. Some of Leech&#x27;s best work is to be found among his illustrations to Surtees&#x27;s later novels, notably &quot;Ask Mamma&quot; and &quot;Mr. Romford&#x27;s Hounds&quot;. Without the original illustrations these works have very small interest.

However, for the very reasons that the Victorians deprecated him, Surtees&#x27; work has continued to be read long after some of his more popular contemporaries have been forgotten. Gash notes that George Whyte-Melville&#x27;s hunting novels were far better selling in their day than Surtees&#x27;s but are now no longer read and appear sanitised in comparison. Gash concludes by writing that:

Surtees&#x27;s range was limited, his style often clumsy and colloquial. Even in the better-constructed novels the plots are loose and discursive. Nevertheless, his sharp, authentic descriptions of the hunting field have retained their popularity among fox-hunters... Among a wider public his mordant observations on men, women, and manners; his entertaining array of eccentrics, rakes, and rogues; his skill in the construction of lively dialogue (a matter over which he took great pains); his happy genius for unforgettable and quotable phrases; and above all, his supreme comic masterpiece, Jorrocks, have won him successive generations of devoted followers. Although his proper place among Victorian novelists is not easy to determine, his power as a creative artist was recognized, among professional writers, by Thackeray, Kipling, Arnold Bennett, and Siegfried Sassoon, and earned the tributes of laymen as distinguished and diverse as William Morris, Lord Rosebery, and Theodore Roosevelt.

There is a statue of Jorrocks by John Mills outside 96 George Street, Croydon, London.

A musical based on his works entitled &quot;Jorrocks&quot; with music and lyrics by David Heneker received a West End run in 1966.

<doc id="807856" wikidata="Q589599" url="?curid=807856" title="Shin-Ōkubo Station">
<text>is a railway station on the Yamanote Line in Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan, operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East). Opened on November 15, 1914, it is close to the large local Korean ethnic neighborhood. Shin-Ōkubo Station has only one exit.

==Lines==
Shin-Ōkubo Station is served by the circular Yamanote Line, with trains running every four minutes during the daytime off-peak. It is one of only two stations on the Yamanote Line that does not provide a direct connection to any other line, the other being Mejiro Station, two stops away.

==Station layout==

The elevated station consists of a single island platform serving two tracks. The Yamanote Freight Line tracks used by Saikyō Line and Shōnan-Shinjuku Line services lie to the east of the Yamanote Line tracks.

Platform edge doors were installed on the Yamanote Line platforms in 2013.

===Platforms===

==Surrounding area==
Less than a kilometer north of the sprawling Shinjuku Station, Shin-Ōkubo Station is located approximately 5 minutes&#x27; walk from Shinjuku&#x27;s Kabukichō district. It is also about a 3-minute walk from Ōkubo Station on the Chūō-Sōbu Line.

Near the station, Okubo-dori (Okubo street) and surrounding side streets are lined with all kinds of small shops, most of them selling Korean food and pop-culture items. Also in the vicinity are Korean-themed bars, nightclubs, and restaurants.

==History==
The station opened on 15 November 1914.

During the late 1940s, while Seibu Railway was planning the extension of the Seibu Shinjuku Line from Takadanobaba to Shinjuku, Seibu planned to open a station at Shin-Ōkubo. Among several plans considered, one option called for the existing JR station to be moved to the west and for Seibu to take over the existing station. Toyama Park, at that time under US occupation, was being considered as a location for a new freight yard, and the rerouting of the Yamanote and Seibu lines was intended to accommodate freight traffic to and from the new yard. However, the freight yard plan was later abandoned, and the Seibu extension opened in 1952 with no stop at Shin-Ōkubo.

Station numbering was introduced in 2016 with Shin-Ōkubo being assigned station number JY16.

==Passenger statistics==
In fiscal 2011, the station was used by an average of 42,433 passengers daily (boarding passengers only).

The passenger figures for previous years are as shown below.

==Incidents==
On 26 January 2001, a 47-year-old photographer from Yokohama and a 26-year-old Korean student died at the station when they were hit by a Yamanote Line train while trying to save a drunken Japanese man who had fallen off the platform onto the tracks and was also killed in the accident. The Korean student&#x27;s life story formed the basis for the film &quot;26 Years Diary&quot;, released in 2007 in Japan and in 2008 in Korea.

<doc id="807859" wikidata="Q390933" url="?curid=807859" title="Ivan Susanin">
<text>Ivan Susanin (; died 1613) was a Russian national hero and martyr of the early-17th-century Time of Troubles. According to the popular legend, Polish troops seeking to kill Tsar Mikhail hired Susanin as a guide. Susanin persuaded them to take a secret path through the Russian forests, and neither they nor Susanin were ever heard from again.

==Evidence==
In 1619, Bogdan Sobinin from the village of Domnino, near Kostroma, received from Tsar Mikhail half of the village of Derevischi. According to the extant royal charter, the lands were granted him to reward his father-in-law, Ivan Susanin, who refused to reveal to the Poles the location of the Tsar.

Subsequent charters (from 1641, 1691 and 1837) diligently repeat the 1619 charter&#x27;s phrases about Ivan Susanin being &quot;investigated by Polish and Lithuanian people and subjected to incredible and great tortures in order to learn the great tsar&#x27;s whereabouts but, though aware of that and suffering incredible pains, saying nothing and in revenge for this being tortured to death by the Poles and Lithuanians&quot;.

The legend of Susanin&#x27;s life and death evolved over time. In the early-19th century, the charters attracted the attention of nascent Russian historiography, and Susanin was proclaimed a Russian national hero and a symbol of the Russian peasants&#x27; devotion to the tsar. Susanin was officially promoted as a national hero and commemorated in poems and operas, such as Mikhail Glinka&#x27;s 1836 opera &quot;A Life for the Tsar&quot;.

==Legend==
The village of Domnino was owned by Xenia Shestova, the wife of Fyodor Romanov and the mother of Mikhail Romanov. Upon Mikhail&#x27;s election to the Russian throne in 1613, the Zemsky Sobor sent Prince Vorotynsky and several other boyars to inform Mikhail, who lived in Domnino, about his election.

Many Polish detachments still roamed Russia, however. They supported Sigismund III Vasa, who refused to accept his defeat and still claimed the Russian throne. One of them discovered the news and sent troops to Kostroma to find and to kill the young tsar.

It is said that they were unsure of the road to Domnino and so they started to ask locals for directions. In woods near the village, they met a logger, Ivan Susanin, who promised to take them via a &quot;shortcut&quot; through a forest directly to the Hypatian Monastery, where Mikhail was apparently hiding. His enemies followed Susanin and were never heard from again. It is presumed that Susanin led them so deep into the forest that they could not find a way out and so they perished in the bitter cold February night.

Susanin&#x27;s son-in-law, whom Susanin had secretly sent ahead via a different route, warned Mikhail, and the monks concealed him from further Polish raids. Mikhail was crowned as tsar, ruled Russia for 32 years and founded the Romanov dynasty.

==Legacy==
Stories and images of Ivan Susanin as an iconic Russian patriot inspired many artists, composers and writers, especially in the Russian Empire. Kondraty Ryleyev glorified Susanin&#x27;s exploits in a poem, and Mikhail Glinka wrote one of the first Russian operas of international renown, &quot;Ivan Susanin&quot;, or &quot;A Life for the Tsar&quot;. The opera&#x27;s original title was to be &quot;Ivan Susanin&quot;, after the hero, but when Nicholas I attended a rehearsal, Glinka changed the title to &quot;A Life for the Tsar&quot; as an ingratiating gesture. That title was retained in the Russian Empire until the Russian Revolution, when it reverted to &quot;Ivan Susanin&quot;. The opera&#x27;s openly-monarchist libretto was edited to comply with Soviet ideology. The tsar&#x27;s anthem melody on Tchaikovsky&#x27;s 1812 &quot;finale&quot; was, in turn, replaced by the chorus &quot;Glory, glory to you, holy Rus&#x27;!&quot; (&quot;Славься, славься, святая Русь!&quot;), from Glinka&#x27;s opera.

In 1838, Nicholas I ordered a monument built to Susanin in Kostroma, but it was destroyed by the Bolsheviks, who were offended by statue of the tsar that the monument incorporated. Later, they erected another monument to the hero.

Mykola Kostomarov, a historian opposed to Nicholas&#x27; regime, was the first to raise the issue of the legend&#x27;s doubtful historicity because it was in the Ipatiev Monastery, not Domnino, that Mikhail Romanov lived in 1612. His arguments were dismissed by more orthodox scholars such as Mikhail Pogodin and Sergey Solovyov.

The name &quot;Susanin&quot; has become an ironic cliché in the Russian language for a person who leads somewhere claiming to know the way but eventually proves not to. A famous folk limerick is quoted to invoke the cliche in such situations, which can be translated roughly as: &quot;Ivan Susanin, in what godforsaken trap did we land? / Screw you! I thought I knew the forest like the back of my hand!&quot;
Glinka&#x27;s opera &quot;A Life for the Tsar&quot; was featured heavily throughout the Romanov tercentenary celebrations. It was performed in a gala performance at Mariinsky Theatre, Performances were staged throughout Russia by schools, regiments and amateur companies. Pamphlets and the penny press printed the story of Susanin &quot;ad nauseam&quot;, and one newspaper told how Susanin had shown all soldiers how to fulfill their oath to the sovereign. At the bottom of the Romanov Monument in Kostroma, a female personification of Russia gives blessings to a kneeling Susanin. In Kostroma, Nicholas II was even presented with a group of Potemkin peasants, who claimed to be descendants of Susanin.

<text>William Pennington (May 4, 1796 – February 16, 1862) was an American politician and lawyer. He was the 13th governor of New Jersey from 1837 to 1843. He served one term in the United States House of Representatives, during which he served as the first Republican Speaker of the House from 1860 to 1861.

==Early life and education==
Born in Newark, New Jersey, he graduated from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1813 and then studied law with Theodore Frelinghuysen. He was admitted to the bar in 1817 and served as a clerk of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (where his father was a judge) from 1817 to 1826. His father, William Sanford Pennington was a Revolutionary War veteran and was himself Governor of New Jersey from 1813 to 1815 before President Madison appointed him as a federal judge.

==Governor of New Jersey==
As a member of the Whig party, he was elected to the New Jersey General Assembly in 1828 and then was elected Governor of New Jersey annually from 1837 to 1843. His tenure as governor was marked by the &quot;Broad Seal War&quot; controversy. Following a disputed election for Congressional Representatives in New Jersey, Pennington certified the election of five Whig candidates while five Democrats were certified by the Democratic Secretary of State. After a lengthy dispute, the Democrats were eventually seated.

==Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives==
In November 1858, Pennington was elected as a Republican to represent New Jersey&#x27;s 5th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives during the 36th Congress but only after a protracted election for speaker of the House of Representatives lasting 44 ballots over eight weeks (December 5, 1859, to February 1, 1860). It was the second time since 1789 that the House elected a freshman congressman as its speaker (after Henry Clay in 1811); the feat has not been repeated since.

In March 1861, he penned his name on the Corwin Amendment, a proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution shielding state &quot;domestic institutions&quot; (a euphemism for slavery) from future constitutional amendments and from abolition or interference by Congress. Submitted to the states for ratification shortly before the outbreak of the American Civil War, it was not ratified by the requisite number of states.

==Death==
After running unsuccessfully for reelection in 1860 to the 37th Congress, he returned to New Jersey, dying in Newark of an unintentional morphine overdose. He was interred at Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Newark.

<text>William Stephen Finsen [[Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society|FRAS]] (28 July 1905 – 16 May 1979) was a South African astronomer. He discovered a number of double stars and took many photographs of Mars. He developed the Finsen eyepiece interferometer to measure very close double stars. He was the final director of Union Observatory in South Africa from 1957 to 1965 (it was renamed Republic Observatory in 1961).

== Biography ==
Finsen was born in 1905 in Johannesburg, Transvaal Colony to Danish parents John Valgard Finsen &amp; Marie Finsen (née Jensen). He was the nephew of the Nobel Prize winner Niels Ryberg Finsen. He obtained a DSc in Astronomy from the University of Cape Town and spent almost 50 years working at the Union Observatory in Johannesburg. He succeeded Willem Hendrik van den Bos as director of the observatory from 1957 to 1965, during which time it changed name to the Republic Observatory (1961).

Both Finsen and van den Bos were vocally opposed to South African government&#x27;s plan to close and amalgamate the Republic Observatory with the Cape Observatory (Cape Town) and the Radcliffe Observatory (Pretoria) into the South African Astronomical Observatory at Sutherland, Northern Cape in 1974, as they feared it would lead to termination of the well-established programmes of observation of binary stars and asteroids. Their fears would later be proven correct as those programmes were terminated.

Finsen invented an eyepiece interferometer which allowed measurement of very close double stars. His original device was used for many years at the astronomy department of the University of South Africa. Finsen examined more than 8 000 stars, discovered 73 double stars and took 54 000 photographs of Mars. They were considered the best photographs of Mars prior to the first space probe pictures in 1965. Finsen continued his observations of double stars after his official retirement from the observatory.

During the second world war Finsen produced some basic films on astronomy which were used to train navigators. He also designed the Finsen Sun Compass to be used by armoured vehicle drivers in the desert campaigns. The standard magnetic compasses were useless owing to the large amount of metal in the vehicles.

Finsen also developed a stomach contents sampler at the request of a specialist physician. Shaped like a pill, once swallowed the small device would open inside the patient&#x27;s stomach after a pre-determined time and sample the stomach contents.

===Tweedledee and Tweedledum===
Φ 332 (Finsen 332) is a tiny and difficult double-double star at 18:45 / +5°30&#x27;, named Tweedledee and Tweedledum by Finsen, who was, by the time of his 1953 discovery, struck by the nearly identical position angles and separations of it.

== Membership, awards and recognition ==
* The asteroid 1794 Finsen is named after him. Finsen first observed the asteroid in 1937.
* The geological feature Finsen Dorsum on the asteroid 433 Eros is named after him. Finsen had detected Eros&#x27; elongated shape.
* President of the ASSA 1949–1950
* Awarded the Gill Medal in 1967.
* Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society – proposed in 1925 by Robert T. A. Innes
