<text>Karla Faye Tucker (November 18, 1959 – February 3, 1998) was an American woman sentenced to death for killing two people with a pickaxe during a burglary. She was the first woman to be executed in the United States since Velma Barfield in 1984 in North Carolina, and the first in Texas since Chipita Rodriguez in 1863. She was convicted of murder in Texas in 1984 and executed by lethal injection after 14 years on death row. Due to her gender and widely publicized conversion to Christianity, she inspired an unusually large national and international movement that advocated the commutation of her sentence to life without parole, a movement that included a few foreign government officials.

==Early life==
Karla Tucker was born and raised in Houston, Texas, the youngest of three sisters. Her father Larry was a longshoreman. The marriage of her parents was troubled, and Tucker started smoking cigarettes with her sisters when she was eight years old. During her parents&#x27; divorce proceedings when she was 10 years old, Tucker learned that her birth was the result of an extramarital affair.

By age 12, she had begun taking drugs and having sex. She dropped out of school at age 14 and followed her mother Carolyn, a rock groupie, into prostitution and began traveling with the Allman Brothers Band, the Marshall Tucker Band, and the Eagles. At 16, she was briefly married to a handyman named Stephen Griffith. When she was in her early 20s, she began hanging out with bikers and met a woman named Shawn Dean and her husband Jerry Lynn Dean. The couple introduced her in 1981 to a man named Daniel Ryan Garrett, or Danny. Then 21 years old, Tucker started dating 35-year-old Garrett.

==Murders==
After spending the weekend using drugs with Garrett and his friends, Tucker and Garrett entered Jerry Dean&#x27;s apartment in Houston, Texas around 3 a.m. on Monday, June 13, 1983, intending to steal a motorcycle that Dean was restoring there. James Liebrandt, a friend, went with them to Dean&#x27;s apartment complex. Liebrandt reported that he went looking for Dean&#x27;s El Camino while Tucker and Garrett entered the apartment with a set of keys that Tucker claimed Shawn Dean had lost and Tucker had found.

During the burglary, Tucker and Garrett entered Dean&#x27;s bedroom, where Tucker sat on him. In an effort to protect himself, Dean grabbed Tucker above the elbows, whereupon Garrett intervened. Garrett struck Dean numerous times in the back of the head with a ball-peen hammer that he found on the floor. After hitting Dean, Garrett left the room to carry motorcycle parts out of the apartment. Tucker remained in the bedroom. 
The blows Garrett had dealt Dean caused him to begin making a &quot;gurgling&quot; sound. Tucker wanted to &quot;stop him from making that noise&quot; and she then picked up a three-foot pickaxe that was lying against the wall and began hitting Dean. Garrett then re-entered the room and dealt Dean a final blow in the chest.

Garrett left the bedroom again to continue loading Dean&#x27;s motorcycle parts into his Ford Ranchero. Tucker was once again left in the room and only then noticed a woman who had hidden under the bed covers against the wall. The woman, Deborah Ruth Thornton, had argued with her husband the day before, went to a party and ended up spending the night in Dean&#x27;s bed. Upon discovering Thornton, Tucker grazed her shoulder with the pickaxe. Thornton and Tucker began to struggle, but Garrett returned and separated them. Tucker proceeded to hit Thornton repeatedly with the pickaxe and then embedded the axe in her heart. Tucker would later tell people and testify that she experienced multiple intense orgasms with each blow of the pickaxe.

The next morning, one of Dean&#x27;s co-workers, who had been waiting for a ride, entered the apartment and discovered the victims&#x27; bodies. Police investigation led to the arrests of Tucker and Garrett, five weeks after the killings.

===Trial===
In September 1983, Tucker and Garrett were indicted for murder and tried separately for the crimes. Tucker was charged with the murders of both Dean and Thornton, but after she testified against Garrett at his trial, the charge for the murder of Thornton was dropped. Garrett was not charged with Thornton&#x27;s death, either. Tucker entered a plea of not guilty and was jailed awaiting trial. Soon after being imprisoned, Tucker took a Bible from the prison ministry program and read it in her cell. She later recalled, &quot;I didn&#x27;t know what I was reading. Before I knew it, I was in the middle of my cell floor on my knees. I was just asking God to forgive me.&quot; Tucker became a Christian in October 1983. She later married by proxy to her prison minister, Reverend Dana Lane Brown, in 1995 and held her Christian wedding ceremony inside the prison.

=== Conviction ===

Though the death penalty was hardly ever sought for female killers, Tucker, along with Garrett, was sentenced to death in late 1984. Garrett died of liver disease in 1993 while awaiting execution. Tucker shared her death row cell at the Mountain View Unit with Pam Perillo, whose own sentence was eventually commuted.

Between 1984 and 1992, requests for a retrial and appeals were denied, but on June 22, Tucker requested that her life be spared on the basis that she was under the influence of drugs at the time of the murders. Tucker said that she was now a reformed person, and if she had not taken the drugs the murders would never have been committed. Her plea drew support from abroad and also from some leaders of American conservatism. Among those who appealed to the State of Texas on her behalf were Bacre Waly Ndiaye, the United Nations commissioner on summary and arbitrary executions; the World Council of Churches; Pope John Paul II; Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi; the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Newt Gingrich; televangelist Pat Robertson; and Ronald Carlson, the brother of Tucker&#x27;s murder victim Debbie Thornton. The warden of Texas&#x27;s Huntsville prison testified that she was a model prisoner and that, after 14 years on death row, she likely had been reformed. The board rejected her appeal on January 28, 1998. Hours before the execution, Texas Governor George W. Bush refused the final 11th-hour appeal to block her execution.

In Texas, the governor cannot stay the execution of a prisoner. They can only approve the recommendation of the parole board and that is rarely ever given. Capital cases cannot be freed from prison, but commuted to life imprisonment.

===Execution===
While on death row, Tucker was incarcerated in the Mountain View Unit in Gatesville, Texas. She became Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) Death Row Inmate #777.

On February 2, 1998, state authorities took Tucker from the unit in Gatesville and flew her on a TDCJ aircraft, transporting her to the Huntsville Unit. For her last meal, Tucker requested a banana, a peach, and a garden salad with ranch dressing.

She selected four people to watch her die, who included her sister Kari Weeks, her husband Dana Brown, her close friend Jackie Oncken, and Ronald Carlson. At one time, Carlson had supported the execution, but after a religious conversion he decided that he was now opposed to all executions. The witnesses for the murder victims included Thornton&#x27;s husband Richard, Thornton&#x27;s only child William Joseph Davis, and Thornton&#x27;s stepdaughter Katie. Tucker&#x27;s execution was also witnessed by members of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Warden Baggett, and various representatives of the media. Her last words were:

She was executed by lethal injection on February 3, 1998. As the deadly chemicals were being administered, she praised Jesus Christ, licked her lips, looked at the ceiling, and hummed. She was pronounced dead at 6:45 p.m. C.S.T., eight minutes after receiving the injection. She was buried at Forest Park Lawndale Cemetery in Houston.

Tucker was the first woman executed in the State of Texas in 135 years, when Chipita Rodriguez was executed by hanging in 1863 during the American Civil War, and the second woman executed in the United States since the reinstatement of capital punishment in 1976.

==Aftermath==
In the year following her execution, conservative commentator Tucker Carlson questioned Governor Bush about how the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles had arrived at the determination on her clemency plea. Carlson alleged that Bush, alluding to a televised interview which Karla Faye Tucker gave to talk show host Larry King, had smirked and spoken mockingly about her. 

A full-length movie was released in 2004 about the life of Tucker entitled &quot;Forevermore&quot; starring actress Karen Jezek. 

The captain of the &quot;Death House Team,&quot; Fred Allen, was interviewed by Werner Herzog for the 2011 documentary &quot;Into the Abyss&quot;. Within days after Tucker&#x27;s execution, one of over 120 he managed, he suffered an emotional breakdown. He resigned his job, giving up his pension, and changed his position on the death penalty. &quot;I was pro capital punishment. After Karla Faye and after all this, until this day, eleven years later, no sir. Nobody has the right to take another life. I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s the law. And it&#x27;s so easy to change the law.&quot;

<doc id="820359" wikidata="Q5505177" url="?curid=820359" title="Frog Buttress">
<text>Frog Buttress is a cliff on the north-west side of Mount French, in the Moogerah Peaks National Park near the town of Boonah in Queensland, Australia. It became famous when local rock climbers Rick White and Chris Meadows discovered it in 1968. Since then, 400 routes have been established by climbers including Henry Barber, Kim Carrigan and Tobin Sorenson.

The buttress is small by world climbing standards: 400m wide, 50m high in the middle, and 20m at its ends. However, it is formed of rhyolite columns, with superb climbing up the many cracks, corners and aretes between them. Most of the cracks are smooth sided and parallel, necessitating the use of many spring-loaded camming devices and efficient crack climbing technique.

There are now over 400 documented routes with grades ranging from 4 to 32 on the Ewbank Scale. The style of climbing is staunchly traditional using natural protection, with very few sport routes. There are bolts on faces and arêtes and in most cases climbers need to bring their own brackets. Top-roping is difficult due to the fragile clifftop and is considered somewhat unethical at this largely &#x27;purist&#x27; crag. Historically, some climbs were initialled at the bottom for easy route-finding, although this practice is now discouraged.

Climbing is best in winter, as during the summer months it quickly becomes too hot to spend much time on the rock, and midday climbing is not recommended. A good strategy is to get in a morning climb, and then head off to the Dugandan Pub, about 9 kilometres away in Boonah, for food and beer.

There are (showerless) camping facilities above the cliff for $4.85 per night, but one needs to book ahead.

== History ==

The area was first developed by Rick White and Chris Meadows in 1968. The first climb done at the cliff was Corner of Eden (21). The name &quot;Frog Buttress&quot; refers to some condom packets they found at the top - at the time &quot;French Letters&quot; was a common euphemism. Local climbers including White, Meadows, Ted Cais, Robert Staszewski, Ian Thomas, Ron Collett and Ian Cameron ascended many routes over the next few years, often with the use of aid. Odin (19) was the testpiece, and Black Light (22) was a great achievement.

When Henry Barber visited Australia in 1975, he arrived in Brisbane and missed his flight to Sydney. He spent his time making free ascents of many routes, and put up the crag classics Conquistador (21) and Child in Time (22). The locals were inspired by his free climbing talent, and repeated many of his routes in the next few years.

John Allen and Tobin Sorenson visited in the late 1970s, and made some typically bold ascents.

Climbers from Victoria put up many harder routes in the 1980s. Brown Corduroy Trowsers (28) remains the outstanding hard trad route.

== Routes ==

A striking aspect of Frog is that there are some climbs done there that are so incredibly hard and bold (read: death-falls) that they will only ever get ascents once in a blue moon if they ever do.

Easier routes for the newcomer include:
It is widely considered that the high quality routes lie in the 19 to 23 grade range. Most beginners will find &#x27;easy&#x27; routes very hard for the grade, but at the low 20s up, most routes are quite reasonable for the grade.

<text>Kasey Kenneth Kahne (; born April 10, 1980) is an American dirt track racing driver and professional stock car racing driver. He competes part-time in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, driving the No. 33 Chevrolet Camaro for Richard Childress Racing. Currently, Kahne competes in High Limit Racing, driving the No. 9 sprint car for his own team, Kasey Kahne Racing.

Off the track, Kahne is active in charitable work and is a member of the President&#x27;s Council on Service and Civic Participation. He also owns his own race team, Kasey Kahne Racing, which competes in the World of Outlaws series, fielding two World of Outlaws sprint cars for himself, and Brad Sweet. Kahne is a 2-time Skagit Speedway winner of the Annual Jim Raper memorial Dirt Cup (2002 and 2003) and currently holds the fastest lap record there. Kahne scored 18 career wins in the Cup Series, including 3 Coca-Cola 600s in 2006, 2008, and 2012, and the Brickyard 400 in 2017. He also was the NASCAR Nextel Cup Series Rookie of the Year in 2004. He retired from racing before the end of the 2018 Cup Series season for health reasons and was replaced at Leavine Family Racing by Regan Smith.

==Racing career==

===Beginnings===
Kahne began racing open wheel sprint cars at Deming Speedway at 17 in Deming, Washington, before moving up to Skagit speedway in Alger, Washington, and then he moved to USAC. In 2000, Kahne made a trip to Pennsylvania where he won the season opener at the historic Williams Grove Speedway. He was hired by Steve Lewis, who had also employed future NASCAR drivers Jeff Gordon, Jason Leffler, Tony Stewart and Kenny Irwin Jr. In his first year on the circuit, he was named Rookie of the Year, as well as winning the national midget championship. He continued to run USAC, as well as the Toyota Atlantic Series and the World of Outlaws.

===Xfinity and Truck Series===
In 2002, Kahne made 20 starts in the Busch Series driving the No. 98 Channellock Ford Taurus for Robert Yates Racing. His best finish was a 10th-place finish at Cabela&#x27;s 250. A year later, he moved to the No. 38 Great Clips Ford for Akins Motorsports full-time. He won his first pole at Michigan International Speedway and his first Busch Series race at the Ford 300. Kahne finished 7th in the points standing. With his move to full-time competition in the Cup Series in 2004, he also drove 30 races for Akins in the Busch Series, finishing 13th in points. In 2005, he made 22 starts in the Busch Series, splitting time with Akins and Evernham&#x27;s new No. 6 team. He won the O&#x27;Reilly 300 at Texas Motor Speedway and the United Way 300 at Kansas Speedway.

On May 26, 2007, Kahne won the Busch Series&#x27; Carquest Auto Parts 300 race at Lowe&#x27;s Motor Speedway for his first win of 2007. On August 24, 2007, Kahne won the pole for the Cup Series&#x27; Sharpie 500 at Bristol, his second pole of the 2007 Nextel Cup Series season. Later that night, during the Busch Series&#x27; Food City 250, Kahne passed Ryan Newman on the top side in a 3-wide pass that included Jason Leffler on the bottom. He held off the hard-charging Leffler to score his seventh career Busch win and his second of 2007.

In 2009, Kahne ran fewer events in other NASCAR series than previous seasons, only seven (four in the Nationwide Series, three in the Whelen Modified Tour). With less distractions, Kahne&#x27;s Sprint Cup stats slightly improved that year.

During the 2014 Nationwide season, Kahne scored an upset win at the Nationwide Series&#x27; Subway Firecracker 250 passing teammate Regan Smith on the final lap. The margin was 0.021 seconds.

On January 24, 2025, NASCAR announced that Kahne would return to the drivers seat for the Xfinity Series race at Rockingham Speedway on April 19.

Kahne has six career starts in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, winning five of them; his lone non-victory is a second-place run at Pocono Raceway in 2010. In 2004, he made a pair of starts in the series at Darlington Raceway and Homestead-Miami Speedway, driving the No. 2 Team ASE Racing Dodge Ram for Ultra Motorsports, winning both races. At the 2015 Charlotte Truck race, he held off Erik Jones for the win by .005 seconds, the second-closest margin in Truck Series history.

===Cup Series===
Kahne replaced Bill Elliott in the No. 9 Dodge for Evernham Motorsports at the end of the 2003 season when Elliott announced a part-time schedule starting with the 2004 season. Since Kahne was still under contract with Ford, the manufacturer filed a lawsuit against him after he joined Evernham Motorsports. U.S. District Judge Robert Cleland ruled in favor of Kahne; citing a clause in his contract with Ford that stipulated that the manufacturer had to provide Kahne with a full-time ride on a Ford team that both parties mutually agreed upon. That clause also stipulated, that if an agreement could not reached by either party, then Kahne could seek a ride with a different manufacturer, without breaking the terms of his contract with Ford.

====Evernham Motorsports (2004–07)====

In 2004, Kahne surprised many by nearly winning several races (including five 2nd-place finishes and 13 Top 5&#x27;s), winning four poles, and captured the Raybestos Rookie of the Year Award. He narrowly missed the Chase for the Nextel Cup after Jeremy Mayfield, his teammate, claimed the final spot.

In 2005, Kahne scored his first career Nextel Cup victory in his sophomore season of 2005, after a dominating performance in the Chevy American Revolution 400 at Richmond International Raceway. It was also the first win for the Dodge Charger, which returned to NASCAR that year. It was the first time a Dodge won a race at Richmond International Raceway since Richard Petty did so in 1975. In addition, he became the first driver born in the 1980s to win a race in NASCAR&#x27;s premier series. He also scored two poles in back-to-back weeks at Darlington and Richmond during the same year. Despite this, he was plagued with inconsistency and slumped to 23rd in the points.
On March 20, 2006, Kahne won the rain-delayed Golden Corral 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway. Nearly three weeks later, he won the Samsung/Radio Shack 500 at Texas. After that, he won four more races – a season sweep at Lowe&#x27;s Motor Speedway in the Coca-Cola 600 and in the Bank of America 500 holding off Jimmie Johnson (who finished second in both races) and victories at California and Michigan.

On September 9, 2006, Kahne successfully raced his way into the Chase for The Cup after finishing third in Richmond. He was the 10th and last qualifier to make the Chase. He edged defending Nextel Cup Champion Tony Stewart out by 16 points, but a disappointing 16th-place finish at New Hampshire, a crash at Dover, and running out of gas at Kansas ended his hopes for his first championship title. Kahne finished strong with five Top 10&#x27;s in the remaining seven races including winning the Bank of America 500 at Charlotte Motor Speedway.

On November 27, 2006, Kahne was honored by being invited to raise the traditional 12th Man flag prior to the Seattle Seahawks &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game against the Green Bay Packers at Qwest Field in Seattle. The ceremony has been ongoing since 2003, and involves a different Seattle-area sports hero and/or beloved member of the community kicking things off before every Seahawks home game. The Seahawks beat the Packers 34–24.
During the qualifying for the 2007 Daytona 500, officials found holes in the wheel-wells of his Dodge Charger. A crew member said it was just tape that had fallen off of a hole in the tire. Officials said that the tape had been cut. He was one of the four drivers among Matt Kenseth and his two teammates, Scott Riggs and Elliott Sadler, whose cars had been found with aerodynamic-improving modifications. His team was one of the six teams found with illegal modifications in the Daytona festivities.

At the Sharpie 500, a day after winning the pole and the Busch race, Kahne dominated most of the race leading 305 out of 500 laps and finished 2nd to Carl Edwards. This was his best finish of the 2007 season. After a disappointing 2007 season, Kahne finished 19th in points with zero wins, one Top 5, eight Top 10&#x27;s, and an average finish of 22.2.

====Gillette Evernham Motorsports and Richard Petty Motorsports (2008–10)====

With the new sponsor Budweiser, Kahne started off the 2008 season strong by finishing in the Top 10 in both the Budweiser Shootout and the Gatorade Duel. As a result of 4th-place finish in the duel, Kahne started 10th in the 50th Daytona 500 on February 17, 2008. He finished 7th behind teammate Elliott Sadler in the 2008 Daytona 500; this was a repeat of the 2007 race where they both also finished sixth and seventh respectively.

In the early laps of the Auto Club 500, Kahne worked his way from 20th to 14th, but brushed the wall on lap 7. However, he was able to finish 9th after the race went under a long rain delay. Kahne had to start in the back due to an engine change in the UAW-Dodge 400 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, but he did go on to finish 6th.

On May 17, 2008, Kahne was voted into the Sprint All-Star Race XXIV by his fans via cell phone text messaging and online voting. After making a required &quot;stop-and-go&quot; pit stop, Kahne began the fourth segment second on old tires. He went on to win the race and earn $1,012,975. Kahne became the first driver to win the race from the fan vote and the third driver to race in the Sprint Showdown and go on to win the All-Star race.

On May 25, 2008, he won his second Coca-Cola 600 passing Tony Stewart with two laps to go, as Stewart had a flat tire going into turn 1. This was Kahne&#x27;s first points-paying win of the season. He also became the sixth driver to win the 600 and the Sprint All-Star Race in the same season.

On June 6, 2008, Kahne won the Pocono 500 from the pole despite being 38th at one point during the race after a miscue in the pits. On June 20, 2008, he won another pole for the Toyota/Save Mart 350 at Infineon Raceway, his second pole in three races. However, after handling issues early in the race, Kahne fell victim to pit road, went a lap down, and finished 33rd.

Following two consecutive 40th-place finishes (a Bristol Motor Speedway wreck caused by miscommunications between Casey Mears and his spotter, and an engine failure at Michigan International Speedway), Kahne found himself sitting outside of the Top 12, out of contention for the Chase. At the start of the last regular season race, at Richmond International Raceway, he, David Ragan, and Clint Bowyer were vying for that 12th spot. Unfortunately for him, Kahne was not able to make up enough points to put him into the Chase for the Sprint Cup. He missed the 2008 Chase by 69 points and ended the season finishing 14th.

Kahne&#x27;s new team for 2009, Richard Petty Motorsports, was the result of a merger between his team&#x27;s previous incarnation, Gillett Evernham Motorsports and Petty Enterprises. The year started off inconsistent for Kahne, with early Top 10 finishes at Atlanta and Bristol. Kahne won the Toyota/Save Mart 350 event on June 21, 2009, for his first road course win.

After a hot summer streak that saw three Top 10s in a row, Kahne climbed into Chase contention. During the Pep Boys Auto 500 on September 6, 2009, Kahne made a late race pass and held off Kevin Harvick for his second win of the season. Following the first 26 races of the season Kahne was in the Top 12 in points, earning him a place in the Chase for the Championship. He was seeded 4th in points. After suffering an engine failure at New Hampshire and a crash in California, Kahne struggled to get back into contention for the championship and finished 10th in the final season standings, despite finishing second in the AMP Energy 500 at Talladega Superspeedway.

On September 10, 2009, it was announced that Richard Petty Motorsports would merge with Yates Racing. Kahne would remain as one of four drivers of RPM alongside his current teammates Sadler and Allmendinger, as well as Yates Racing driver Paul Menard. The team changed manufacturers to Ford and received Roush-Yates engines and other equipment from Roush Fenway Racing.

Driving the new Ford Fusion car, Kahne won the Gatorade Duel No. 2 at Daytona International Speedway on February 11, 2010. He also finished in second position in the 2010 Budweiser Shootout. Kahne ended up 30th in the Daytona 500 after being wrecked late in the race. He had been running up front for most of the race and had the fastest lap of the race. Kahne had a strong car at the Auto Club 500; however he spun late in turn 4.

Kahne had a good run at Atlanta a few weeks later where he led the most laps in the race, and finished inside the Top 5. During the following couple of months, Kahne would be unable to compete for race wins as mistakes and wrecks put a dent into the team&#x27;s Chase hopes.

During the Gillette Fusion ProGlide 500 at Pocono Raceway he had a Top 5 car all race long, but due to a late race caution, some teams stayed out on track instead of joining the leaders on pit-road. This put Kahne in the back end of the Top 20, and during the green-white-checkered finish Kahne tried to make it three-wide while battling for 10th place. However, he was blocked and ran down into the wet grass by his teammate A. J. Allmendinger. Kahne spun back into the racing surface and was hit by Greg Biffle and Mark Martin. The No. 9 car took off and landed on top of the outside wall, hit a tree behind the wall and span back onto the track on all four wheels. Kahne and Biffle both put the blame on Allmendinger for causing the huge crash.

Kahne rebounded from the disappointment at Pocono by leading laps in the following race at Michigan and finishing second, behind the dominant Denny Hamlin. He also qualified on pole for the Toyota/Save Mart 350 at Infineon Raceway the following week; and converted the pole position into a solid fourth-place finish; after bouncing back from a poor first stint, to post back-to-back Top 5 finishes.

In qualifying for the 2010 Carfax 400 at Michigan International Speedway, Kahne earned his second pole position of the season. On October 3, 2010, Kahne started the Price Chopper 400 at Kansas Speedway from the pole position.

On October 20, 2010, Kahne was released from the remainder of his contract with Richard Petty Motorsports. The next day, it was announced that Kahne would drive for Team Red Bull for the remainder of the season as well as the full 2011 season starting with the TUMS Bring It On 500 at Martinsville Speedway.

After the 2010 season finale in Homestead, Kahne went in for knee surgery due to discomfort and pain caused by plica syndrome.

====Red Bull Racing (2011)====

On April 13, 2010, Kahne announced that he would be leaving Richard Petty Motorsports at the end of the 2010 season to race in 2012 with Hendrick Motorsports, driving the No. 5. On August 10, 2010, Team Red Bull officially announced that Kahne would drive one of their cars for the 2011 NASCAR Sprint Cup season, a tenure that would start in the 2010 season after Kahne was released from RPM. Kahne used the number 4 for his Red Bull Toyota, an homage to the number he used in Sprint Cars. Prior to the acquisition, the No. 4 was made famous by Morgan-McClure Motorsports. Kahne won his first pole for Red Bull Racing the year prior at the 2010 season finale at Homestead driving the No. 83. On June 9, 2011, it was announced that Farmers Insurance Group would sponsor Kahne for 22 races in 2012. It was also announced that his current crew chief Kenny Francis will join him at Hendrick.

Kahne dominated the early stages of the Brickyard 400, but spun late in the race and had to settle for 18th position. He led 48 laps, a race-high.

He did not make it into the 2011 Chase for the Sprint Cup, resting at 21st in points following the cut-off race, the Wonderful Pistachios 400 at Richmond International Raceway on September 10, 2011.

On November 13, 2011, at the newly configured Phoenix International Raceway, Kahne held off Carl Edwards in the closing laps to take his first victory of the season, his first victory for Team Red Bull, and Kahne&#x27;s first victory in over two years. Kahne only led the final 14 laps of the race.

Kahne finished the 2011 season 14th in points.

====Hendrick Motorsports (2012–17)====
In 2012, Kahne drove the No. 5 Farmers Insurance/Quaker State/HendrickCars.com Chevrolet for Hendrick Motorsports, consequent with Mark Martin&#x27;s move to Michael Waltrip Racing. In the Budweiser Shootout, he was involved in an early accident in the first segment. His teammates Jeff Gordon, Jimmie Johnson, and Dale Earnhardt Jr. were eliminated in crashes during the second segment. Kahne qualified and ran well in his Gatorade Duel, but in the Daytona 500 was taken out in a crash on lap 188 involving Jamie McMurray, Regan Smith, Carl Edwards, Brad Keselowski, Tony Stewart, and Aric Almirola. He finished 29th.
Kahne announced in late-March that he would compete for Turner Motorsports in the Camping World Truck Series at Rockingham Speedway in April, driving the No. 4 in the Good Sam Roadside Assistance 200. In that race, he led 47 laps and went on to win.

Kahne had a rough start to 2012, finishing no better than 14th in the first five races. However, he rebounded with seven straight Top 10 finishes, including a win in the 2012 Coca-Cola 600 in his 300th Sprint Cup Start. This was also his first win with Hendrick Motorsports.
On July 15, 2012, Kahne won the Lenox Industrial Tools 301 at Loudon, and along with teammate Jeff Gordon made the Chase through the two Wild Card spots. During the Chase, Kahne won poles at Talladega and Kansas. He ended the season a career-best fourth place in the points, with two wins, four poles, 12 Top 5&#x27;s, and 19 Top 10&#x27;s.

Kahne had a slow start to 2013, finishing 36th and 19th at Daytona and Phoenix, respectively. However, at Las Vegas, he led 114 laps (which was almost twice the number of laps he had led in all of his previous Vegas starts) and finished second to Matt Kenseth despite an impressive charge in the last laps. Kahne was able to redeem himself for this near-miss the following week by winning at Bristol. After Bristol, he had a strong run at Auto Club Speedway in which he finished 9th—he then had an even stronger run at Martinsville, where he had one of the best cars and finished 4th. He then finished 11th at Texas. At Kansas, Kahne again finished 2nd to Kenseth in a finish very similar to the finish at Las Vegas.

Kahne&#x27;s season also started with a number of run-ins with Kyle Busch, who wrecked him in three of the first 11 races: at the Daytona 500, Kahne was running in the Top 5 when Busch turned him approaching turn 1 on lap 33, resulting in a seven-car wreck also collecting Tony Stewart, Juan Pablo Montoya, Jamie McMurray, and other cars. At Talladega, on lap 43, Kahne was in the outside lane when Busch turned him into the wall again heading towards turn 1. Kahne bounced off the wall and back into Busch and collected an additional 14 cars, including Kevin Harvick, David Reutimann, Brian Vickers, Tony Stewart, Marcos Ambrose, Greg Biffle, Jeff Burton, Casey Mears, Jamie McMurray, Jeff Gordon, Kurt Busch, David Stremme, and Scott Speed. Later, at Darlington, another incident happened when Busch sent Kahne into the wall while being challenged for the lead late-race, causing a caution. At the Coca-Cola 600, Kahne had influenza and there was doubt he could finish the race. This didn&#x27;t stop him from leading the most laps and nearly winning the race, but Kevin Harvick got by him on a restart with 11 laps to go. At Michigan, Kahne led the race, but slid into the turn 2 wall, and the car caught fire. Kahne finished 38th, and dropped down four spots in the points standings to 12th.

Following the retirement at Michigan, Kahne rebounded with a sixth-place finish at Sonoma and an 11th-place finish at Kentucky. At Daytona, Kahne was running behind Jimmie Johnson for most of the race until he got tagged by Marcos Ambrose on a late restart, sending him into the inside wall on the back straightaway and relegating him to a 32nd-place finish. This was followed by an 11th-place finish at New Hampshire, and a 3rd-place finish at Indianapolis.

At Pocono in August, Kahne started 18th. He led 66 laps of the race and was involved in a tight battle with Tony Stewart for the lead in the final laps. A decision by Gordon to take the final restart on lap 158 on the inside lane gave Kahne the opportunity to draft past Gordon in turn 1 and then sail away to his second career Pocono race victory and second win of the 2013 season, bringing him up to eighth place in the points. His form didn&#x27;t carry to Watkins Glen, though, where he was wrecked by Matt Kenseth on a late restart that saw him collide with Dale Earnhardt Jr. and finish 34th. Kahne then had a 7th-place finish at Michigan, and then a runner-up finish at Bristol behind Kenseth for the third time in 2013.

He qualified for the Chase, but any chance of him winning ended with a crash at Loudon. Early in the 2013 Sylvania 300, Kahne got loose, wheel-hopped and hit a barrier extremely hard. Kahne was uninjured but caused controversy when he acted like he could not hear a reporter in his interview which led many to speculate that Kahne suffered a head injury. Kahne apologized for causing the false alarm and said he was too angry to talk about it and that he was not injured. He later revealed on a February 2025 episode of The Dale Jr. Download that he had in fact suffered a concussion.

Kahne struggled in the first half of the 2014 season. He came close to a win at Pocono in June but hit the outside barrier late in the event, costing him his shot at the win. Kahne said that Kyle Busch was yet again responsible for the crash and Busch himself took responsibility that night. When Kahne heard that Busch apologized for the wreck he shrugged it off and said &quot;I don&#x27;t care to talk to him anymore about our wrecks. Tired of his aggressiveness and the fact that his performances are affecting my own results.&quot;

Kahne began ending rumors of his departure from Hendrick Motorsports with a sponsorship extension with Farmers Insurance for 12 races in the 2015–2017 seasons. At the Brickyard 400, Kahne led 70 laps due to great track position but lost the lead on a restart with 17 laps left to Jeff Gordon and ended up 6th.

At Atlanta, Kahne controlled the final 15 laps of the race. With three laps to go, it seemed like he lost it when a caution came out. He lost four spots on pit road, but after two more cautions, sped by Matt Kenseth and won the race to clench a spot in the Chase. It was his first and only win of 2014. He finished 15th in the standings being eliminated from round two of the Chase. Kahne received a three-year contract extension with HMS in November, which would run until the conclusion of the 2018 season. It was announced a day earlier that long time engineer and Jamie McMurray&#x27;s 2014 crew chief, Keith Rodden, would return to HMS and replace Kenny Francis as Kahne&#x27;s crew chief. Francis had been Kahne&#x27;s crew chief since the 2005 NASCAR Nextel Cup race at Homestead-Miami Speedway. Replacing Francis ended the second-longest driver/crew chief pairing in NASCAR in the first two decades of the 21st century.

Kahne made his return to the Camping World Truck Series driving the No. 00 Haas Automation Silverado for JR Motorsports at Charlotte. Kahne beat 18-year-old Erik Jones by 0.005 seconds which was tied for the second closest finish in NASCAR Truck Series competition. The win was Chevrolet&#x27;s 200th win in the Camping World Truck Series. In the Cup Series, Kahne would start off with a ninth-place finish in the Daytona 500. He would struggle throughout most of the year, and would only get 10 Top 10s and three Top 5s, his best finish being fourth at Phoenix, Dover and the Kansas Chase race. Kahne finished the season in 18th-place in the final points standings.

Kahne experienced a difficult 2016 season as he finished 17th in the final points standings with only three Top 5&#x27;s and 13 Top 10&#x27;s. During the season, Kahne did not lead a single lap in any race despite completing the most laps in the series.

Kahne&#x27;s 2017 Season started off similar to previous years, but did manage to lead laps over compared to the previous year. After disappointing races at the beginning of the year, things began to look up. In July 2017, Kahne returned to Victory Lane at the Brantley Gilbert Big Machine Brickyard 400, surviving a crash-laden race that took out many contending cars, including holding off Brad Keselowski on an overtime restart that ended under caution. It was Kahne&#x27;s 18th win in the Cup Series and first in 102 races. The race was also the reason that the NASCAR sanctioning body eliminated the Overtime Line.

On August 7, 2017, Hendrick Motorsports announced Kahne would not be returning to the team for the 2018 season, and two days later, William Byron was announced as Kahne&#x27;s replacement. It was simultaneously announced that the No. 5 car, Hendrick&#x27;s original entry in NASCAR, would disappear from Hendrick Motorsports going forward. In 2020, the No. 5 car returned when it was assigned to Kyle Larson.

After the opening race in the chase at Chicagoland Speedway, crew chief Keith Rodden was replaced with Darian Grubb after many lackluster finishes. Right away, Kahne was one of the fastest cars at Loudon, but bad luck plagued the No. 5 team in the Playoffs and had an early playoff exit. At the end of the season, he ended up with a career low in Top 10&#x27;s with six and tied his career low of Top 5&#x27;s with three. He also led 41 laps in 2017, his second career lowest after the aforementioned 2016 season where he didn&#x27;t lead a lap at all. Kahne announced he would drive the 95 Leavine Family Racing Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 in 2018, replacing Michael McDowell.

====Leavine Family Racing (2018)====

On September 19, 2017, Kahne announced he would be driving the No. 95 for Leavine Family Racing in 2018. In the offseason, Leavine announced he would pair up with Hendrick Motorsports team engineer Travis Mack who previously substituted for Greg Ives when he Crew Chiefed for Dale Earnhardt Jr. to his best run in 2017. Kahne finished 10th in the All Star race after going four laps down from a wreck. After a very disappointing first half, that included his best run of 17th place on three occasions and a firing of crew chief Travis Mack for lead engineer John Leonard. He led a season high 17 laps and scored the most points at the Coke Zero 400 at Daytona, on the final restart, Kahne tried to make a move to the lead but stalled out due to not getting help. He fell back in line and finished 4th, a season best for him, tying the team&#x27;s best finish as well as moving up three spots in the standings to 25th.

On August 16, 2018, Kahne stated his intention to step away from full-time competition at the end of the year. On September 6, 2018, after heat exhaustion from the race before at Darlington, Kahne announced that he would sit out the 2018 Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis and be replaced by Regan Smith, which would be the first race Kahne had not raced in since he began his full time career in the Cup Series. Following the Brickyard race, it was announced that Kahne would continue to sit out for the next three races with Smith still filling in.

On October 9, 2018, he announced on Twitter that he would sit out for the remainder of the year, ending his 15-year career prematurely.

===Return to dirt racing===
On March 29, 2019, Kahne was injured in a hard sprint car accident at Williams Grove Speedway, and Australian driver James McFadden replaced him. Kahne did not race again for over a year, with his first race back coming at Knoxville Raceway on May 8, 2020; he finished 11th in the last chance qualifier.

On December 22, 2021, Kahne announced that he would compete full-time with the World of Outlaws in 2022 driving the Kasey Kahne Racing No. 9 car.

On December 3, 2023, Kahne announced that he would compete full-time with High Limit Racing in 2024.

===Return to NASCAR===
On January 24, 2025, Kahne announced he would return to the Xfinity Series for one race at Rockingham in 2025, driving the Richard Childress Racing No. 33 car with sponsorship from HendrickCars.com.

==Personal life==
During most of his time in NASCAR, Kahne preferred to keep his personal life private, and rarely revealed any details aside from his racing career. Although he has not married, Kahne and his former girlfriend Samantha Sheets became parents to a son on October 13, 2015. The couple is known to have an amicable relationship following their split sometime before 2018. Later, Kahne began dating Amy Long, a former sports reporter, in 2020. Kahne and Amy had a baby girl in early 2023.

==Film and television==
Kahne was featured in the premiere episode of the 2006 Biography Channel series &quot;Driven to Win&quot;. This 30-minute program covered Kahne&#x27;s childhood and entry into NASCAR, as well as his 2004 Rookie of the Year season and his first win in 2005. He was also featured in two episodes of the second season of &quot;NASCAR 360&quot; on the FX Network.

Kasey Kahne Racing, NASCAR Media Group and Motorsports Management International partnered to produce the 2009 release, &quot;&quot;The Rise of Kahne&quot;.&quot; This 90-minute biographical profile features interviews with Kahne, his family and other NASCAR personalities. Footage covers the stock-car racer&#x27;s open-wheel roots and successes leading up to his June 2009 win at Infineon Raceway, his first for Richard Petty Motorsports. The DVD also shows his work with the Kasey Kahne Foundation and his own sprint car race team.

Kahne&#x27;s No. 9 Dodge Dealers- sponsored car appeared in the 2005 Disney film &quot;&quot;, with Kahne as one of the four drivers who boxed Herbie in and pummeled him in the final race. He is mentioned by name by one of the race announcers.

In 2010, Kahne made a brief appearance in the music video &quot;Smoke a Little Smoke&quot; by Eric Church.

<doc id="820384" wikidata="Q17074147" url="?curid=820384" title="J. P. Patches">
<text>Julius Pierpont &quot;J. P.&quot; Patches was a clown and the main character on &quot;The J. P. Patches Show&quot;, an Emmy Award-winning local children&#x27;s television show on Seattle station KIRO-TV, produced from 1958 to 1981. J.P. Patches was played by show creator and Seattle children&#x27;s entertainer Chris Wedes (April 3, 1928 – July 22, 2012). When the show ended in 1981, &quot;The J. P. Patches Show&quot; was one of the longest-running locally produced children&#x27;s television programs in the United States.
==The &quot;J. P. Patches Show&quot;==
The &quot;J. P. Patches Show&quot; was on TV for a total of 23 years. For the first thirteen years it was on six days a week, twice per day on weekdays (before and after school) plus Saturday mornings from Monday, February 10, 1958, through Saturday, December 26, 1970. For the next eight years, the show aired mornings only, six days a week, Monday, December 28, 1970, through Saturday, December 30, 1978. For the final two years, the show ran exclusively on Saturday mornings, January 6, 1979 through September 19, 1981. The following week, five special episodes, retrospectives and farewells, ran from Monday, September 21 through Friday, September 25, 1981—and then it was over. &quot;The J.P. Patches Show&quot; broadcast an estimated 12,000 episodes—almost all of them totally live and unrehearsed .

The show premiered on February 10, 1958, on KIRO-TV. The show was immensely popular in the Puget Sound area and southwestern British Columbia; at the peak of its run, the program had a daily local viewership of over 100,000. It was enjoyed not only by children but also their parents, who appreciated J. P.&#x27;s frequent use of double entendre (G-rated) and sly subversiveness that mostly went over the kids&#x27; heads. Two generations of Pacific Northwest viewers grew up as &quot;Patches Pals&quot;, sharing the joyful zany antics of J.P. with their kids. Patches Pals were reminded every show to follow the Patches Pals daily checklist:

*Mind Mommy and Daddy
*Wash hands, face, neck, and ears
*Comb hair
*Brush Teeth
*Drink your milk
*Eat all of your food
*Say your prayers
*Share your toys
*Put toys away
*Hang up clothes
&quot;The J. P. Patches Show&quot; competed with two other local children&#x27;s shows, &quot;Captain Puget&quot; on KOMO-TV, and &quot;Wunda Wunda&quot; and &quot;King&#x27;s Klubhouse&quot;, both on KING-TV. &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;, CBS&#x27;s own long-running children&#x27;s show, saw its first half-hour preempted by KIRO-TV in favor of &quot;J.P. Patches&quot;.

After 23 years, KIRO-TV cancelled the show because of declining ratings, and the final episode was broadcast on September 25, 1981. After the show ended, Wedes continued to portray J.P. at many public and private charity events for another thirty years despite suffering in later years from incurable (but in remission) blood cancer.
Wedes spent many hours visiting sick children at Seattle Children&#x27;s Hospital in Laurelhurst, never asking to be paid. In 2011, due to declining health, Wedes announced that his final public appearance as J. P. would be on September 17, 2011, fifty-six years after first donning the face paint. On December 14, 2011, a prime time special was aired on KCTS-TV titled &quot;J. P. Patches: Last Night at the City Dump&quot;, which was meant to serve as a farewell to the character. On July 22, 2012, at 84 years of age, Chris Wedes died after a long battle with multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer.

===Premise===
The show was live, unrehearsed improv with rarely more than two live actors on the set (Wedes and Bob Newman), but with frequent contributions from the sound effects man and off-camera crew. J. P. was the &quot;Mayor of the City Dump&quot;, where he lived in a shack, the inside of which was the appropriately rough but colorfully-furnished studio set. He welcomed frequent guests: Seattle boy scout and girl scout troops, various local and national celebrities (see below), and his cast of supporting characters: Sturdley the Bookworm (a puppet), Esmerelda (portrayed by a Raggedy Ann doll), Ketchikan the Animal Man (a sort of Jack Hanna character), Boris S. Wort (the &quot;second meanest man in the world&quot;), LeRoy Frump (a character obviously based on Art Carney&#x27;s Ed Norton), Tikey Turkey (a rubber chicken), Grandpa Tick Tock (a grandfather clock with an elderly face where the pendulum would be), The Swami of Pastrami, Ggoorrsstt the Friendly Frpl (a one-eyed brown shag carpet), Miss Smith (a motorcycle riding delivery woman who told mostly awful jokes), Superclown (a JP like superhero), J. P.&#x27;s evil counterpart P. J. Scratches (per official site &quot;I.M. Rags&quot;), and J. P.&#x27;s girlfriend, Gertrude. The show&#x27;s entire supporting cast, male and female, human or non-human, was mostly played by the versatile actor Bob Newman.

===Bob Newman===
Bob Newman (born January 24, 1932, on Mercer Island, Washington) initially started at KIRO-TV as a film-editor and floor director in 1960, two years into J.P.&#x27;s run. He used to hang around the set, just to watch the fun. One of J. P.&#x27;s bits was to call the city dump telephone operator Gertrude on a big yellow banana phone, although Gertrude herself was never seen or heard. One day, after J. P. asked Gertrude for a ham sandwich for a picnic, Newman yelled out, in a falsetto voice, &quot;Okay Julius, I&#x27;ll send it right down.&quot; Wedes was as surprised as everyone else, and from that day forward Newman became Gertrude, with his falsetto voice, frumpy dress and a wig made from a mop dyed red. J. P. got his &quot;ham sandwich,&quot; as Bob Newman was willing to do anything for a laugh and proved to be the perfect foil for Wedes&#x27; improvisational comedy. He provided over 17 characters for the show and remained a faithful friend to Chris Wedes for the rest of his life. Newman died on December 13, 2020.

===ICU2TV===
J. P. announced the birthdays of selected Patches Pals by &quot;viewing&quot; them on his &quot;ICU2TV,&quot; a cardboard hood that created the illusion that J. P. was looking at you from inside your television. He predicted where a gift might be hidden in the child&#x27;s house with amazing accuracy (with the never-mentioned assistance of a postcard from a parent). The sound effect used was the same, distinctive ringtone of Lloyd Cramden&#x27;s &quot;presidential hotline&quot; telephone in &quot;Our Man Flint&quot;.

==Origin==
Broadcaster Daryl Laub created the J. P. Patches character in 1953 for WTCN-TV in Minneapolis. When he left WTCN in 1955 for KSTP-TV, Chris Wedes (pronounced WEE-dus) took over the character from that point on. Wedes appeared on several WTCN programs. Besides J.P., his most notable character was Joe the Cook, a sidekick to host Roger Awsumb as Case Jones on WTCN&#x27;s &quot;Lunch with Casey&quot;. Wedes brought J. P. with him when he moved to Seattle in 1958 to become KIRO-TV&#x27;s first floor director. In addition to the long-running TV show, J. P. Patches made frequent fundraising appearances for local charities. He was a common sight at Children&#x27;s Hospital, visiting sick kids and promoting the work of the hospital.

== &quot;Late for the Interurban&quot; statue ==

On August 17, 2008, a bronze statue of J. P. and Gertrude was unveiled on North 34th Street, about 250 feet east of the intersection with Fremont Avenue North, in the Fremont section of Seattle. The unveiling date was to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the &quot;J. P. Patches&quot; show. The statue is called &quot;Late for the Interurban&quot; by sculptor Kevin Pettelle and is approximately east of &quot;Waiting for the Interurban&quot;. The unveiling was attended by hundreds of Patches&#x27; Pals, including Washington Governor Christine Gregoire, Congressman Jim McDermott, King County Executive Ron Sims, and several members of the county and city councils; both Chris Wedes (J. P. Patches) and Bob Newman (Gertrude) were present. The event was emceed by Pat Cashman, and the keynote address was given by Wedes&#x27; 16-year-old granddaughter, Christina Frost.

==Merchandise and Videos==
* A J. P. Patches action figure is distributed by Seattle novelty dealer Archie McPhee, along with a bobblehead, lunchboxes, Christmas ornaments and assorted other collectibles.
* In 1992, four VHS video tapes were released of the &quot;J. P. Patches Show&quot;. Because the show was performed and broadcast live—in real time—very, very little footage of the show was ever made. There is a Christmas show, there is a highlights reel, there is a 20th anniversary show put together in 1978, and there is J. P.&#x27;s final show in 1981. All of the above footage was incorporated into a 2-DVD set in 2005.
* The book &quot;J.P. Patches, Northwest Icon&quot;, by Bryan Johnston and Julius Pierpont Patches (Chris Wedes), () was released in 2002 by Peanut Butter Publishing.
* Johnston has also written a novel about Boris S. Wort and his campaign to &quot;meanify&quot; Seattle, entitled &quot;The 2nd Meanest Man in the World&quot; (2017). Seattleites &quot;of a certain age&quot; will find many icons and events of their childhood put into the perspective of Wort&#x27;s nefarious plot.
* In addition to the book and action figure, DVDs and tee shirts have been available at the Channel 9 store.

==Popular culture==
*J. P. was listed as one of Krusty the Clown&#x27;s birthday buddies in the animated television show &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (episode &quot;Radio Bart&quot;) along with Bart. This was similar to JP&#x27;s I.C.U.2-TV segment. Matt Groening, the creator, drew a lot of inspiration from his former home in the Pacific Northwest such as naming the streets. JP and fellow Pacific NW clown Rusty Nails are considered the inspiration for Krusty.

<doc id="820425" wikidata="Q7552774" url="?curid=820425" title="Sociobiological theories of rape">
<text>Sociobiological theories of rape explore how evolutionary adaptation influences the psychology of rapists. Such theories are highly controversial, as traditional theories typically do not consider rape a behavioral adaptation. Some object to such theories on ethical, religious, political, or scientific grounds. Others argue correct knowledge of rape causes is necessary for effective preventive measures.

== &quot;A Natural History of Rape&quot; ==
The idea that rape evolved under some circumstances as a genetically advantageous behavioral adaptation was popularized by biologist Randy Thornhill and anthropologist Craig T. Palmer in their book &quot;A Natural History of Rape&quot; (2000).

== Animal coercive sex ==

Behavior resembling rape in humans can be seen in the animal kingdom, including ducks and geese, bottlenose dolphins, and chimpanzees. Indeed, in orangutans, close human relatives, such copulations constitute up to half of observed matings. Such &#x27;forced copulations&#x27; involve animals being approached and sexually penetrated while struggling or attempting to escape. Observations of forced sex in animals are uncontroversial; controversial are the interpretation of these observations and the extension of theories based on them to humans. &quot;Thornhill introduces this theory by describing the sexual behavior of scorpionflies. In which the male may gain sex from the female either by presenting a gift of food during courtship or without a nuptial offering, in which case he rapes her.&quot;

== Human rape ==
Thornhill and Palmer write that &quot;In short, a man can have many children, with little inconvenience to himself; a woman can have only a few, and with great effort.&quot; Females thus tend toward selectivity with sexual partners. Rape could be a reproductive strategy for males. They point to several other factors indicating that rape may be a reproductive strategy. Most rapes occur during prime childbearing years. Rapists usually use no more force than necessary to subdue, argued to be since physically injuring victims would harm reproduction. Moreover, &quot;In many cultures rape is treated as a crime against the victim&#x27;s husband.&quot;

Anthropologist Edward H. Hagen states in his Evolutionary Psychology FAQ from 2002 that he believes there is no clear evidence for the hypothesis that rape is adaptive. He believes the adaptivity of rape is &quot;possible&quot;, but claims there is not enough evidence to be certain one way or the other. However, he encourages such evidence to be obtained: &quot;Whether human males possess psychological adaptations for rape will only be answered by careful studies seeking evidence for such cognitive specializations. To not seek such evidence is like failing to search a suspect for a concealed weapon.&quot; He also describes some conditions in the ancestral environment during which the reproductive gains from rape may have outweighed the costs:
*&quot;High status males may have been able to coerce matings with little fear of reprisal.&quot;
*&quot;Low status women (e.g., orphans) may have been particularly vulnerable to being raped because males need not have feared reprisals from the woman&#x27;s family.&quot;
*&quot;During war, raping enemy women may have had few negative repercussions.&quot;
*&quot;Men who were low status, who were likely to remain low status, and who had few opportunities to invest in kin may have realized reproductive benefits that outweighed the considerable costs (e.g., reprisal by the woman&#x27;s family).&quot;

McKibbin et al. (2008) argue that there may be several different types of rapists or rape strategies. One is rape by disadvantaged men who cannot get sex otherwise. Another is &quot;specialized rapists&quot; who are more sexually aroused from rape than from consensual sex. A third type is opportunistic rapists who switch between forced and consensual sex depending on circumstances. A fourth type is psychopathic rapists. A fifth type is partner rape due to sperm competition when the male suspects or knows that the female has had sex with another male. There are varying degrees of empirical support for the existence of each of these types. More generally they mention research finding that at least one-third of males &quot;admit they would rape under specific conditions&quot; and that other surveys find that many men state having coercive sexual fantasies. They, as have others, &quot;propose that rape is a conditional strategy that may potentially be deployed by any man.&quot;

=== Women&#x27;s defenses ===
Women may have developed several defenses against and strategies to avoid rape. One is a partner preference for men that are effective bodyguards against other men such as physically and socially dominant men (although there may also be other evolutionary reasons for such a preference). Another is great psychological pain which according to some research is greatest during the childbearing years. Other researchers have argued that the emotional pain may cause the women to focus on the social circumstances that enabled the rape with the aim to prevent future rapes.

Other research has found that during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle women perform fewer behaviors that may increase the risk of an assault. Studies have also found that sensitivity for potential coercive behaviors in males as well as handgrip strength (but only in a simulated coercive situation) increase during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle. On the other hand, a 2003 study found that the frequency of pregnancy from rape is significantly higher than that of pregnancy in non-coercive intercourse, and advanced the hypothesis that male rapists disproportionately target women exhibiting biological indications of fertility.

=== Naturalistic fallacy ===
Thornhill and Palmer write that &quot;Rape is viewed as a natural, biological phenomenon that is a product of the human evolutionary heritage&quot;. They further state that by categorizing a behavior as &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;biological&quot; they do not in any way mean to imply that the behavior is justified or even inevitable. &quot;Biological&quot; means &quot;of or pertaining to life,&quot; so the word applies to every human feature and behavior. But to infer from that, as many critics assert that Thornhill and Palmer do, that what is biological is somehow right or good, would be to fall into the so-called appeal to nature. They make a comparison to &quot;natural disasters as epidemics, floods and tornadoes&quot;. This shows that what can be found in nature is not always good and that measures should be and are taken against natural phenomena. They further argue that a good knowledge of the causes of rape, including evolutionary ones, are necessary in order to develop effective preventive measures.

Evolutionary psychologists McKibbin et al. argue that the claim that evolutionary theories are justifying rape is a fallacy in the same way that it would be a fallacy to accuse scientists doing research on the causes of cancer that they are justifying cancer. Instead, they say that understanding the causes of rape may help create preventive measures.

Wilson et al. (2003) argue that evolutionary psychologists like Thornhill and Palmer use the naturalistic fallacy inappropriately to forestall legitimate discussion about the ethical implications of their theory. According to Thornhill and Palmer, a naturalistic fallacy is to infer ethical conclusions (e.g., rape is good) from (true or false) statements of fact (e.g., rape is natural). Wilson et al. point out that combining a factual statement with an ethical statement to derive an ethical conclusion is standard ethical reasoning, not a naturalistic fallacy, because the moral judgment is not deduced &quot;exclusively&quot; from the factual statement. They further argue that if one combines Thornhill and Palmer&#x27;s factual premise that rape increases the fitness of a woman&#x27;s offspring with the ethical premise that it is right to increase fitness of offspring, the resulting deductively valid conclusion is that rape has also positive effects and that its ethical status is ambiguous. Wilson et al. state that Thornhill and Palmer dismiss all ethical objections with the phrase &#x27;naturalistic fallacy&#x27; although &quot;it is Thornhill and Palmer who are thinking fallaciously by using the naturalistic fallacy in this way&quot;.

=== Preventing rape ===
Thornhill and Palmer (2000) suggest a number of possible strategies for preventing rape. One example is explaining to males that they may have predispositions to misread the female invitation of sex. They believe that viewing rape as being due to a desire for domination, and not related to sexual desire, is generally harmful. One example given is the claim that the way women dress will not affect the risk of rape. They argue that the much greater societal freedom of dating without supervision, and removal of many barriers between males and females, have created an environment that has also removed many earlier societal controls against rape. It is recommended that &quot;men and women interact only in public places during the early stages of their relationships&quot;.

=== Victim counseling ===
Counseling of rape victims may also be improved by evolutionary considerations, according to Thornhill and Palmer, and they argue that the view that rape is due to a domination desire, cannot explain to the victim why the rapist seemed to be sexually motivated.

Evolutionary considerations can also help explain the emotional pain felt, as well as the form it takes. They may also help the rape victim understand why the rape victim&#x27;s partner may see the rape as a form of infidelity. They also argued that the victim&#x27;s partner may be helped by such understanding, and be more able to change his or her reaction.

== Criticism ==

The 2003 book &quot;Evolution, Gender, and Rape&quot;, written in response to &quot;A Natural History of Rape&quot;, compiles the views of twenty-eight scholars in opposition to sociobiological theories of rape. One contributor, Michael Kimmel, criticizes Thornhill and Palmer&#x27;s argument that female rape victims tend to be sexually attractive young women, rather than children or older women, contrary to what would be expected if rapists selected victims based on inability to resist. Kimmel argues that younger women are the least likely to be married and the most likely to be out on dates with men, and therefore are the most likely to be raped because of opportunity arising from social exposure and marital status. Palmer and Thornhill responded to these critics in an article in the journal &quot;Evolutionary Psychology&quot;.

Smith et al. (2001) criticized Thornhill and Palmer&#x27;s hypothesis that a predisposition to rape in certain circumstances is an evolved psychological adaptation. They developed a fitness cost/benefit mathematical model and populated it with estimates of certain parameters (some parameter estimates were based on studies of the Aché in Paraguay). Their model suggested that generally only men with a future reproductive value of one-tenth or less of a typical 25-year-old man would have a net positive cost/benefit fitness ratio from committing rape. On the basis of their model and parameter estimates, they suggested that this would make it unlikely that rape generally would have net fitness benefits for most men.

While defending the evolutionary psychology theory of rape against its more vehement critics, Vandermassen (2010) provides a critique of some aspects of the view. She characterises the view of Thornhill and Palmer as &quot;extreme&quot; (p. 736), as they fail to allow for the influence of any non-sexual motivations in the crime of rape. Vandermassen also notes two problems with the data cited by Thornhill and Palmer regarding the psychological trauma caused by the violence associated with rape: firstly, the data is inaccurately and confusingly presented in the book, often obscuring the fact that they do not support Thornhill and Palmer&#x27;s &quot;counterintuitive hypothesis&quot; (p. 744) that more physical violence during rape is associated with less psychological pain. Secondly, more recent research has failed to support this hypothesis. A more moderate position, integrating the evolutionary psychology and feminist theories on rape, is presented by Vandermassen, based in part on the work of feminist evolutionary researcher Barbara Smuts.

Hamilton (2008) has criticized Thornhill and Palmer&#x27;s definition of rape as the coerced vaginal penetration of women of reproductive age. He has suggested that the exclusion of male rape, rape of women outside the reproductive age range, murderous rape, and non-vaginal forms of rape virtually guaranteed the confirmation of their hypothesis that rape is an evolved reproductive strategy and not a crime of violence. Hamilton has argued that evolutionary psychology fails to explain rape because, by evolutionary psychology&#x27;s own criteria, an adaptation to rape children or men, or non-vaginal rape, would have been eliminated in the course of evolution because it did not confer reproductive advantage on our ancestors.

Evolutionary psychologist David Buss states that clear-cut evidence for or against rape as an adaptation is lacking. He states that rape may instead be a non-adaptive by-product of other evolved mechanisms, such as desire for sexual variety and for sex without investment, sensitivity to sexual opportunities, and a general capacity for physical aggression.

<doc id="820435" wikidata="Q6266407" url="?curid=820435" title="Johnny Bush">
<text>John Bush Shinn III (February 17, 1935October 16, 2020) was an American country music singer, songwriter, and musician. Nicknamed the &quot;Country Caruso&quot;, Bush was best known for his distinctive voice and for writing the song &quot;Whiskey River&quot;, a top 10 hit for himself which also became the signature song of fellow country artist Willie Nelson. He was especially popular in his native Texas.

==Early life==
Bush was born John Bush Shinn III in the Kashmere Gardens neighborhood of Houston. He listened to the western swing music of Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys and the honky-tonk sounds of artists such as Ernest Tubb, Lefty Frizzell, and Hank Thompson. His uncle, the host of a local radio program on KTHT, urged Bush and his brother to play on air, giving Bush his first experience of performing in public. Bush subsequently moved to San Antonio in 1952, beginning a solo career in area honky-tonks such as the Texas Star Inn, before switching to drums. During this period, he earned his stage name, when an announcer mistakenly introduced him as &quot;Johnny Bush&quot;. As a drummer, he worked for bands such as the Mission City Playboys, the Texas Plainsmen, and the Texas Top Hands.

==Career==
===Early years===
Bush joined Ray Price&#x27;s band, the Cherokee Cowboys, in 1963 along with a young Willie Nelson and Darrell McCall. His association with Price led Bush to Nashville and a contract to sing for record demonstrations. He also played in Nelson&#x27;s band, the Record Men. With Nelson&#x27;s financial backing Bush recorded his first album in 1967, &quot;The Sound of a Heartache&quot;.

===Stardom and vocal problems===
A series of regional hits on the Stop label, including &quot;You Gave Me a Mountain&quot; (penned by Marty Robbins), &quot;Undo the Right&quot; (penned by Willie Nelson and Hank Cochran), &quot;What A Way To Live&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot; soon followed. Rock critic Robert Christgau said that Bush&#x27;s version of &quot;You Gave Me A Mountain&quot; &quot;brings a catch to the throat and a tear to the eye.&quot; These songs did well in Bush&#x27;s native Texas, and reached the national top 20. In 1972, he was signed to RCA Records whose Nashville division was headed by guitarist Chet Atkins. His first RCA single, &quot;Whiskey River&quot; was climbing the charts with airplay on countless radio stations when his voice began faltering. Bush even felt he was being punished by God for his sins. Bush has since said: &quot;I thought because of my promiscuous behavior and bad choices and being raised as a Baptist, that it was a punishment from God.&quot;

Bush lost half of his vocal range and was sometimes unable to talk. RCA dropped him in 1974 after three albums, he developed a drug habit and was often stricken with performance anxiety when he was able to perform at all. After several misdiagnoses, doctors diagnosed the cause in 1978 when they discovered he had a rare neurological disorder called spasmodic dysphonia. Although this did not prevent him from recording, Bush&#x27;s career began to take a downturn. He worked with a vocal coach in 1985, and was able to regain 70% of his original voice.

===Later years===
Bush teamed with Darrell McCall in 1986, recording a successful honky-tonk album &quot;Hot Texas Country&quot; and began assembling a large country band (as did Willie Nelson) performing around South Texas. In 1994, the band released &quot;Time Changes Everything&quot;, the same year that RCA released a greatest-hits album. A major tour soon followed. In recent years, Bush has continued to tour regularly, often performing with Nelson.

Several albums on local Texas labels soon followed. His renewed visibility made him a mentor figure to younger Texas musicians who revered the honky-tonk/hardcore country sound that Bush has done so much to keep in the public eye. Austin musicians such as Dale Watson and Cornell Hurd sought him out to play on their albums. In 2003, he was inducted into the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame with his lifelong friend Willie Nelson on hand to induct him. In 2007, he released his autobiography, with the aid of Rick Mitchell: &quot;Whiskey River (Take My Mind): The True Story of Texas Honky-Tonk&quot;, published by University of Texas Press. A new album, &quot;Kashmere Garden Mud: A Tribute to Houston’s Country Soul&quot;, was released on the Icehouse label at the same time.

With the success of his recent Botox treatments for his vocal condition and his successful career revival, Bush was a spokesman for people afflicted with vocal disorders. In 2002, he was honored with the Annie Glenn Award from the National Council of Communicative Disorders for Bush&#x27;s work in bringing attention to the condition of spasmodic dysphonia. Bush self-released &quot;The Absolute Johnny Bush,&quot; a full-length album of new recordings, in June 2017. It included collaborations with Dale Watson and Reckless Kelly.

Bush died at a hospital in San Antonio on October 16, 2020. He was 85, and suffered from pneumonia in the time leading up to his death.

<doc id="820449" wikidata="Q2466817" url="?curid=820449" title="Percé Rock">
<text>Percé Rock (, , ) is a huge sheer rock formation in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence on the tip of the Gaspé Peninsula in Québec, Canada, off Percé Bay. Percé Rock appears from a distance like a ship under sail. It is one of the world&#x27;s largest natural arches located in water and is considered a geologically and historically rich natural icon of Quebec. It is a major attraction in the Gaspésie region.

==Etymology==
The massive rocky cliff is called by several names, such as &quot;le Rocher Percé&quot;, Pierced Rock, Pierced Island, Split Rock or Percé Rock. The name is attributed to the pierced rock that formed an arch high on its seaward southern end, as though a needle had cut through the rock. It was named &quot;Percé&quot; (&quot;pierced rock&quot;) by Samuel de Champlain in 1607, in reference to the holes he had seen in the massive block of limestone, which over the years has become a major attraction in the province of Quebec.

==Legend==
The Percé Rock, described as &quot;the monstrous giant; pierced through by an immense eye, now green, now gray, now blue or violet, according to the moods of the sea&quot;, is linked in legend to a young man of a noble French family.

Another version of the legend, which is also narrated by the local people of Percé town, is that they see the rock in the shape of a &quot;phantom&quot; during storms and hence call it &quot;Le Génie de l&#x27;Isle Percée&quot;. This, however, could be interpreted to mean that the vapoury clouds that engulf the &quot;vast flocks of water fowl&quot; could give such an impression when viewed from a distance.

==Geography==
Percé Rock is part of the range of cliffs, bays and hills on the southwest side of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, which are formed of reddish-gold limestone and shale. It is linked to mainland (at Rue du Mont Joli) by a sandbar at low tide. The Bay of Perce is situated between this rock and the High Head. There is a reef to the SW of Percé Rock, about away from the shore. The town of Percé is located on the shores of the bay. Its main industry is fishing. Percé reef is about from the centre of the town where small vessels can be moored. Midway across the rock is a shoal that stretches over a length of .

The rock formation has about 150 fossil species. In Bonaventure Island where the park is situated, conglomerates from the Carboniferous period of more than 310 million years are recorded.

Next to the rock is Bonaventure Island, and together they form Parc national de l&#x27;Île-Bonaventure-et-du-Rocher-Percé (Bonaventure Island and Percé Rock National Park), founded in 1985, which covers an area of about . The tip of the Gaspé Peninsula has five geological formations, and Percé Rock is the only one located within the park. The park extends over a stretch of the coastline, and exhibits a wide variety of flora and fauna. It is a migratory bird sanctuary for the northern gannet, and has over 110,000 nesting birds, the second largest in the world. (The Municipal website of Percé mentions that the population of northern gannets is 121,000, which exceeds the figures mentioned for the archipelago of St Kilda in Scotland.) Other birds found on the island include puffins, razorbills, black guillemot and kittiwakes, as well as over 200 other species. From May to December, some species of blue whale, humpback whale, minke whale or fin whale can be seen along the coast near Percé, Bonaventure Island and Forillon National Park.

At low tide, the rock is approachable on foot. The rock and the bird colony in Bonaventure Island is about a 75-minute trip from Percé by boat. Visits to the rock are restricted to the period from May 28 to October 12. During such visits, park guides provide information on beach creatures, the geology of Percé Rock, also called the &quot;cathedral of limestone that rose from the Equator&quot;, and the fossils found there. The rock mass is a monolith estimated at 5 million tonnes. It has been inferred that at the current erosion rate (about 300 tonnes of mass per year lost to the action of water and wind), it will disappear in about 16,000 years. In view of its tendency to collapse, it is dangerous to venture close to the rock on foot during low tide. The top of the rock is not accessible because of its height. Snowy gannets, silvery gulls, black cormorants and other species of birds perch there.

An interpretation centre in Percé, housed in Le Chafaud, an elegant restored building, has a thematic exhibition titled &quot;Un rocher, une île, un parc national&quot;, meaning &quot;one rock, one island, one national park&quot;, which recounts the bird life, marine life, geology, history and ecosystem of the park and the rock.

==Description==
Percé Rock is a massive siliceous limestone stack formation, with sandstone and siltstone veins, with steep rock faces on all sides. It is long, wide, and high at its highest point. It is described as a narrow bluff emerging out of the sea, &quot;resembling a beached supertanker from some angles&quot;. For four hours at a time during low tide, the water recedes from a wide spit that allows the rock itself to be visited.

==History==

Percé Rock&#x27;s huge limestone formation is geologically dated to the Devonian period of more than 400 million years ago (375 million years is also mentioned). However, Percé Rock is only a small component of the large areas of Devonian rocks that occupy the interior that were first mapped in 1844 by Sir William Edmond Logan, known as the father of Canadian geology. Fossils in such rocks show a variety of animal and plant communities from both terrestrial and marine habitats from the Devonian period. The Percé Rock contains 150 species of different fossils such as brachiopod, trilobites, dalmanites, corals and marine worms from the Devonian period.

Originally, the Percé Rock was inferred as connected to the main land. When Jacques Cartier, the first colonist, arrived here in 1534, he reported three arches in the massive rock formation. In time, two of the arches disappeared, with the last one collapsing on June 17, 1845, leaving a separated pillar. When it was seen in 1603 by the French geographer and founder of Quebec City, Samuel de Champlain, it had only one arch. However, in 1760, a picture of Percé Rock drawn by an English officer, Captain Hervey Smyth, showed two arches, one of which collapsed in June 1845. Percé rock&#x27;s two large holes were cut through by the sea waves. One of the holes seen now is an arch described as &quot;gothic arch of rock&quot;, which is about high. A small boat can pass through the arch during high tide. Of the two arches, the outer arch, which collapsed with great force in 1845, remains in the form of an &quot;obelisk&quot;. In early 1900s, enchanted by the beauty of the Percé Rock, travellers started visiting the area of Gaspe, Percé and Bonaventure Island.

==In popular culture==
Percé Rock is a major tourist attraction in Quebec, with picturesque views of the rock from both Percé and nearby Bonaventure Island.

French surrealist poet André Breton (1896–1966) visited Gaspé in October 1944 and recorded his impressions of the visit in &quot;Arcanum 17&quot;, &quot;a hymn of hope, renewal, and resurrection&quot;. The name of the poem stands for the 17th tarot card in the Major Arcana, called the Star, which symbolizes a woman pouring lunar forces into a mundane world and represents negative connotations of loss or abandonment of hope or bright prospects. During the visit, Breton was attracted to the Percé Rock and drew inspiration from it. In contrast to his unhappy personal life in war-torn Europe, the Rock provided him with the inspiration and reminder that &quot;nature renews herself and that death is only transitory.&quot; He called Percé Rock a &quot;razor blade rising out of the water, an image very imperious and commanding, a marvelous iceberg of moon stone ... to a distracted observer though to a common man it is just but a resting place of birds&quot;.

<doc id="820517" wikidata="Q5188245" url="?curid=820517" title="Cross Canadian Ragweed">
<text>Cross Canadian Ragweed are an American country and rock band formed in Yukon, Oklahoma in 1994. The band consists of Cody Canada (lead guitar/vocals), Grady Cross (guitar), Randy Ragsdale (drums), and Jeremy Plato (bass guitar). The group released five studio albums and three live albums from 1994 until 2010. The band was at the forefront of the rise of the red dirt music scene in Oklahoma and the Texas Music scene. After almost 15 years together, the group disbanded in 2010. In September 2024, the band announced their reunion after teasing it for weeks on their social media.

==History==
===Formation===
Cross Canadian Ragweed started when Randy Ragsdale met Cody Canada, Matt Weidemann, and Grady Cross, who had also been playing together. The four had known each other since grade school and started playing together in Ragsdale&#x27;s home seven nights a week under the tutelage of Ragsdale&#x27;s father, Johnny, who had worked with musical artists in the area. After playing together, the band officially formed by combining a part of every band member&#x27;s last name, coming up with the name Cross Canadian Ragweed. Matt Weidemann left the band, and Jeremy Plato joined the band, playing the bass guitar. After finishing high school, the band moved to the College Town of Stillwater, Oklahoma, where acts like Mike McClure&#x27;s The Great Divide and singer-songwriter Jimmy LaFave had established enough of a local scene to earn Stillwater the nickname North Austin.

===&quot;Carney&quot; and &quot;Live And Loud at the Wormy Dog Saloon&quot;===
The group had already received significant college radio airplay before it released its first album, &quot;Carney&quot; in 1998 on their own independent label. Initially, selling the band in the market it was based in, was considered by music observers to be far-fetched; however, the fan base&#x27;s passion and loyalty to the band allowed them to find success in releasing that first album. Carney was well received, then the band released &quot;Live and Loud at the Wormy Dog Saloon&quot; in 1999, which was also well received, especially in the local scene.

===&quot;Highway 377&quot;===
Ragweed released its second studio album Highway 377 in 2001, though it was recorded in 1999. It propelled them into wider audience and into Texas, where Canada was born and also where the band had been touring heavily. Though not a released single, the song &quot;Long Way Home&quot; was featured on several Dodge Truck Commercials in both Texas and Oklahoma which added to the popularity of the band. The band paid tribute to drummer Randy Ragsdale&#x27;s father Johnny, who has passed away from cancer in 1997 with the track &quot;Johnny&#x27;s Song.&quot;

===&quot;Live and Loud at Billy Bob&#x27;s Texas&quot;===
In 2002 Ragweed recorded the popular live album &quot;Live and Loud at Billy Bob&#x27;s Texas&quot; in Fort Worth, Texas. The songs were mainly live versions of songs off &quot;Carney&quot; and &quot;Highway 377&quot;, with a handful of cover songs.

===&quot;Cross Canadian Ragweed (Purple Album)&quot;===
In 2002, the group then signed with Universal South Records and released a self-titled album also alternately known as &#x27;The Purple Album&#x27;. It was a tribute to the band&#x27;s &quot;little sister&quot; Mandi Ragsdale, the younger sister of the band&#x27;s drummer Randy Ragsdale, who had died in an auto accident near College Station, Texas, and whose favorite color was purple. The album produced charted singles &quot;17&quot; and the ballad &quot;Constantly&quot;, and released a music video for the hard rock track &quot;Don&#x27;t Need You.&quot;

===&quot;Soul Gravy&quot;===
Ragweed&#x27;s 2004 album, &quot;Soul Gravy&quot;, debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard charts. Lee Ann Womack provided background vocals on the popular single &quot;Sick and Tired&quot;. The project also saw the re-release of the song &quot;Alabama&quot; (off of 2001&#x27;s Highway 377) with a heavier electric sound, which appeared on the Billboard Charts as well.

===&quot;Garage&quot;===
In October 2005 the band released &quot;Garage&quot;, described by both the band and raters at AllMusic as the group&#x27;s &quot;grungiest album ever.&quot; Two songs, &quot;Fighting&#x27; For&quot; and &quot;This Time Around&quot; both became hits off the album. The album charted higher than any studio album the band ever released and for the first time, the band broke into rock radio airplay across the United States due to the song &quot;Dimebag&quot;, a tribute to former Damageplan and Pantera guitarist &quot;Dimebag&quot; Darrell Abbott, who had been killed months earlier during a concert, in addition to a heavier rock sound overall.

===&quot;Back To Tulsa: Live And Loud At Cain&#x27;s Ballroom&quot;===
In late 2006, Ragweed released their third and final live album, &quot;Live and Loud At Cain&#x27;s Ballroom&quot; in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The band&#x27;s 24 song project was well received and featured songs from their previous projects The Purple Album, Soul Gravy, and Garage. It also featured a handful of covers as well such as Neil Young&#x27;s The Needle and the Damage Done and Robert Earl Keen&#x27;s &quot;Lonely Feeling.&quot;

===&quot;Mission California&quot;===
Cross Canadian Ragweed recorded &quot;Mission California&quot;, their fourth studio album, at the end of March 2007. The namesake of the album was due to the recording taking place in San Diego, California. The band spent 25 days in the studio; the first 5 cutting 15 tracks, the next 20 polishing each. Lee Ann Womack once again laid down background vocals on 4 of the tracks to include the Chris Knight cover &quot;Cry Lonely.&quot; &quot;Mission California&quot; was released on October 2, 2007. AllMusic reviewed the Album and found that the project was &quot;name appropriately, the band sounds much more a progressive West Coast sound in many of the tracks and less rural rock.&quot;

===&quot;Happiness and All the Other Things&quot;===
The band&#x27;s tenth and final album, &quot;Happiness and All the Other Things&quot; was released on August 31, 2009, commemorating the band&#x27;s 15th Anniversary. It featured 12 new studio tracks and three live tracks. Recorded in California, this album includes a track entitled &quot;51 Pieces&quot;, which Canada penned with Micky Braun. The song was based on an incident where Ohio State police ransacked the band&#x27;s bus after a stop in Cleveland at the House of Blues. It also featured &quot;Blue Bonnets&quot; which is dedicated to Cody&#x27;s oldest son Dierks. &quot;Happiness and All the Other Things&quot; was officially dedicated to the late Randall Locke (Willie Nelson&#x27;s long-time stage manager) who suddenly died on May 6, 2009. Other popular tracks were &quot;To Find My Love&quot;, &quot;Burn Like The Sun&quot;, and &quot;Kick In The Head.&quot;

=== Hiatus and band break-up ===
In May 2010, Cross Canadian Ragweed announced a hiatus from touring. In a band press release, Ragsdale explained, &quot;Right now, I need to be at home for my family, particularly my son JC, who has autism. He&#x27;s 10 years old now and still struggling in his development. I feel the only way I can help him is to be more hands on and close to home.&quot; Despite Ragsdale wanting to &quot;get another drummer and press on,&quot; Canada stated &quot;We’ve always said from the start, we’re Ragweed as the four of us, or not Ragweed at all.&quot; In September 2010, Canada officially announced the band was calling it quits by announcing their &quot;Last Call Show&quot; in October 2010 at Joe&#x27;s Bar in Chicago, IL, stating &quot;as far as that’s concerned, Oct 24 is the last one, the last gig.&quot;

=== Post break-up ===
Since Cross Canadian Ragweed, Canada and Plato formed The Departed with fellow Yukon-native Dave Bowen (drums), Seth James (guitar), and Steve Littleton (keyboards), releasing their debut album &quot;This Is Indian Land&quot; in June 2011.
Ragsdale and Cross both returned to Yukon. Ragsdale played with Stoney LaRue until 2013 and now works in the oil and natural gas industry, while Cross purchased and operates the bar that was the very first venue Cross Canadian Ragweed performed in 1994.

In 2019 Grady Cross and Randy Ragsdale joined singer-songwriter Jason Young to form the band Cross Rags and Young.

=== Reunion ===
The band announced their reunion in September 2024, announcing a show alongside Jason Boland &amp; The Stragglers, Turnpike Troubadours, Stoney LaRue, and The Great Divide. The show was originally scheduled to take place on April 12, 2025, at Boone Pickens Stadium. Due to pre-sale ticket demand a second show was added for April 11, 2025. After the two shows sold out on Monday, October 7, 2024, two more shows were added later that day for the Thursday before and the Sunday after. After tickets sold out on Tuesday, October 8, 2024, a grand total of 180,764 tickets were reported sold for the weekend of April 10–13, 2025.

The band played a surprise set at Mile 0 Music Fest in Key West, Florida in January 2025. This was the band&#x27;s first live performance in over 15 years.

==Influences and sound==
The band was influenced by grunge, alternative rock of the 1990s along with early southern rock acts as well as outlaw country. Canada said that rock bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, AC/DC, and Soundgarden all were a part of the influence on the band&#x27;s sound as well as country music influences Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson, and Robert Earl Keen, in addition to southern rockers Marshall Tucker Band, and Lynyrd Skynyrd, among others. Due to their unique sound, the band often had a hard time getting radio airplay on either mainstream rock or country stations.

==Notable appearances==
The band frequently played with other stars of the Red Dirt and Texas Music scene including Stoney Larue, Jason Boland &amp; The Stragglers, Micky &amp; The Motorcars, Reckless Kelly, (Canada&#x27;s brother-in-law) Wade Bowen, No Justice, Johnny Cooper, Seth James, and Brandon Rhyder.

The band played with country music star Dierks Bentley numerous times. Bentley referenced the band in his song &quot;Free and Easy (Down the Road I Go)&quot;, singing that &quot;Ragweed&#x27;s rockin&#x27; on the radio&quot;.

Minnesota Twins catcher Ryan Doumit comes to bat to their song &quot;Alabama&quot;.

&quot;Cry Lonely&quot; is a playable track in &quot;Rock Band Country Track Pack&quot;.

The song &quot;Boys from Oklahoma&quot; plays as the credits roll in the movie Leaves of Grass starring Edward Norton and Susan Sarandon. The film is a Stoner Comedy set in Oklahoma.

&quot;Anywhere But Here&quot; is played during the Season 2 Episode 6 of the NBC television series &quot;Grimm&quot;.

She was originally an East Indiaman, a merchant ship built in France for the French East India Company in 1765, for service between France and Asia. She was placed at the disposal of John Paul Jones on 4 February 1779, by King Louis XVI of France as a result of a loan to the United States by French shipping magnate Jacques-Donatien Le Ray.

==Origin==
&quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; was originally an East Indiaman named &quot;Duc de Duras&quot;, a merchant ship built at Lorient according to the plan drawn up by the King&#x27;s Master Shipwright Antoine Groignard for the French East India Company in 1765. Her design allowed her to be quickly transformed into a man-of-war in case of necessity to support the navy. She made two voyages to China, the first in 1766 and the second in 1769. At her return the French East India Company had been dissolved, and all its installations and ships transferred to the French Navy. As a naval ship she made a voyage to Isle de France (Mauritius) before being sold to private shipowners in 1771. She sailed in private service until she was purchased by King Louis XVI of France in early 1779 and placed under the command of John Paul Jones on 4 February. The size and armament of &quot;Duc de Duras&quot; made her roughly equivalent to half of a 64-gun ship of the line.

Jones renamed her &quot;Bon Homme Richard&quot; (usually rendered in more correct French as &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot;) in honor of Benjamin Franklin, the American Commissioner at Paris whose &quot;Poor Richard&#x27;s Almanack&quot; was published in France under the title &quot;Les Maximes du Bonhomme Richard&quot;.

==First patrols==
On 19 June 1779, &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; sailed from Lorient accompanied by , &quot;Pallas, Vengeance,&quot; and &quot;Cerf&quot; with troop transports and merchant vessels under convoy to Bordeaux and to cruise against the British in the Bay of Biscay. Forced to return to port for repair, the squadron sailed again August 14, 1779. It went northwest around the west coast of the British Isles into the North Sea and then down the east coast. The squadron took 16 merchant vessels as prizes.

==Battle of Flamborough Head==
On 23 September 1779, the squadron encountered the Baltic Fleet of 41 sail under convoy of and HM hired armed ship near Flamborough Head. &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; and &quot;Serapis&quot; entered a bitter engagement at about 6:00 p.m. The battle continued for the next four hours, costing the lives of nearly half of the American and British crews. British victory seemed inevitable, as the more heavily armed &quot;Serapis&quot; used its firepower to rake &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; with devastating effect. The commander of &quot;Serapis&quot; finally called on Jones to surrender. He replied, &quot;Sir, I have not yet begun to fight!&quot; Jones eventually managed to lash the ships together, nullifying his opponent&#x27;s greater maneuverability and allowing him to take advantage of the larger size and considerably more numerous crew of &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot;. An attempt by the Americans to board &quot;Serapis&quot; was repulsed, as was an attempt by the British to board &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot;. Finally, after another of Jones&#x27;s ships joined the fight, the British captain was forced to surrender at about 10:30 p.m. &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; – shattered, on fire, leaking badly – defied all efforts to save her and sank about 36 hours later at 11:00 a.m. on 25 September 1779. Jones sailed the captured &quot;Serapis&quot; to the Dutch United Provinces for repairs.

Though &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; sank after the battle, the battle&#x27;s outcome was one of the factors that convinced the French crown to back the colonies in their fight to become independent of British authority.

==Search for the wreck==
&quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot;&#x27;s final resting location was the subject of much speculation. A number of unsuccessful efforts had been conducted to locate the wreck. The location was presumed to be in approximately of water off Flamborough Head, Yorkshire, a headland near where her final battle took place. The quantity of other wrecks in the area and a century of fishing trawler operations had complicated all searches.

A wreck was identified in 1974 off Flamborough Head and in 2001 it was concluded that there was a high possibility that the wreck was that of the &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot;. The remains were designated under the Protection of Wrecks Act in 2002. The wreck is a Protected Wreck managed by Historic England.

One season&#x27;s attempts to locate and retrieve the ship, or some artifacts from her, using were filmed for the Discovery Channel&#x27;s &quot;Mighty Ships&quot; series in 2011. The U.S. Navy&#x27;s mission was unsuccessful. In 2012, an expedition with the Ocean Technology Foundation and the French Navy located a wreck of interest (called &quot;Target 131&quot;) in 70 meters of water. The wreck is mostly buried, but some artifacts are visible on the seabed surface, including an anchor that would fit the dimensions and style of the kedge anchor on the &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot;. In 2014, the French Navy and Ocean Technology Foundation mounted an expedition to have the French Navy dive Target 131. Artifacts discovered by the divers included a deadeye block (part of a sailing ship&#x27;s rigging), large sections of half-buried planking, and what appeared to be an iron spar hoop, with a few pieces of decomposing wood still encircled in it. No evidence of modern objects has been found on the site. The Global Foundation for Ocean Exploration (GFOE) has since continued the work of the Ocean Technology Foundation, leading an expedition with the French and U.S. navies in 2016, again aboard USNS &quot;Grasp&quot;. More remote sensing was conducted, and researchers discovered additional objects within the wreck site that were deemed worthy of further investigation. A 2019 expedition involving GFOE, the French navy, and the U.S. Navy was planned, but was postponed indefinitely due to a disagreement among France and the U.S. about the ultimate ownership of the &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot;. The goal of this mission was to prove or disprove Target 131 as being the &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot;.

In 2018 remains were found after Merlin Burrows conducted 25 dives on the site, with 32 ships-timbers recovered and in excess of 140 non-recovered artifacts identified, believed by Merlin Burrows to be those of the &quot;Bonhomme Richard,&quot; in shallow water very close to the coast of Filey, North Yorkshire, England, by the Land and Sea search team Merlin Burrows. However, the location of this wreck remains contentious with conflicting views between different research teams and some eyewitness accounts on land, stating that on the morning of 25 September 1779, the &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; disappeared out of sight over the horizon. As of September 2023, collaboration between Merlin Burrows and the United States Naval History and Heritage Command is ongoing, wherein Merlin Burrows are sharing the entirety of their research data/works and recovered items.

<text>Maia (; Ancient Greek: Μαῖα; also spelled Maie, ; ), in ancient Greek religion and mythology, is one of the Pleiades and the mother of Hermes, one of the major Greek gods, by Zeus, the king of Olympus.

== Family ==
Maia is the daughter of Atlas and Pleione the Oceanid, and is the oldest of the seven Pleiades. They were born on Mount Cyllene in Arcadia, and are sometimes called mountain nymphs, &quot;oreads&quot;; Simonides of Ceos sang of &quot;mountain Maia&quot; &quot;(Maiados oureias)&quot; &quot;of the lovely black eyes.&quot; Because they were daughters of Atlas, they were also called the Atlantides.

== Mythology ==
=== Birth of Hermes ===
According to the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Hermes&quot;, Zeus, in the dead of night, secretly made love to Maia, who avoided the company of the gods, in a cave of Cyllene. She became pregnant with Hermes. After giving birth to the baby, Maia wrapped him in blankets and went to sleep. The rapidly maturing infant Hermes crawled away to Thessaly, where, by nightfall of his first day, he stole some of his half-brother Apollo&#x27;s cattle and invented the lyre from a tortoise shell. Maia refused to believe Apollo when he claimed that Hermes was the thief, and Zeus then sided with Apollo. Finally, Apollo exchanged the cattle for the lyre, which became one of his identifying attributes.

Although the &quot;Homeric Hymn&quot; has Maia as Hermes&#x27; caretaker and guardian, in Sophocles&#x27;s now lost satyr play &quot;Ichneutae&quot;, Maia entrusted the infant Hermes to Cyllene (the local mountain goddess) to nurse and raise, and thus it is her that the satyrs and Apollo confront when looking for the god&#x27;s missing cattle.

=== As nurturer ===
Maia also raised the infant Arcas, the child of Callisto with Zeus. Wronged by the love affair, Zeus&#x27; wife Hera in a jealous rage had transformed Callisto into a bear. Arcas is the eponym of Arcadia, where Maia was born. The story of Callisto and Arcas, like that of the Pleiades, is an &quot;aition&quot; for a stellar formation, the constellations Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, the Great and Little Bear.

Her name is related to μαῖα (&quot;maia&quot;), an honorific term for older women related to μήτηρ (&quot;mētēr&quot;) &#x27;mother&#x27;, also meaning &quot;midwife&quot; in Greek.

== Roman Maia ==
In ancient Roman religion and myth, Maia embodied the concept of growth, as her name was thought to be related to the comparative adjective &quot;maius, maior&quot; &quot;larger, greater&quot;. Originally, she may have been a homonym independent of the Greek Maia, whose myths she absorbed through the Hellenization of Latin literature and culture.

In an archaic Roman prayer, Maia appears as an attribute of Vulcan, in an invocational list of male deities paired with female abstractions representing some aspect of their functionality. She was explicitly identified with Earth (&quot;Terra&quot;, the Roman counterpart of Gaia) and the Good Goddess (&quot;Bona Dea&quot;) in at least one tradition. Her identity became theologically intertwined also with the goddesses Fauna, Ops, Juno, Carna, and the Magna Mater (&quot;Great Goddess&quot;, referring to the Roman form of Cybele but also a cult title for Maia), as discussed at some length by the late antiquarian writer Macrobius. This treatment was probably influenced by the 1st-century BC scholar Varro, who tended to resolve a great number of goddesses into one original &quot;Terra&quot;. The association with Juno, whose Etruscan counterpart was Uni, is suggested again by the inscription &quot;Uni Mae&quot; on the Piacenza Liver.

The month of May (Latin &quot;Maius&quot;) was named for Maia, though ancient etymologists also connected it to the &quot;maiores&quot; &quot;ancestors&quot;, again from the adjective &quot;maius, maior&quot;, meaning those who are &quot;greater&quot; in terms of generational precedence. On the first day of May, the Lares Praestites were honored as protectors of the city, and the flamen of Vulcan sacrificed a pregnant sow to Maia, a customary offering to an earth goddess that reiterates the link between Vulcan and Maia in the archaic prayer formula. In Roman myth, Mercury (Hermes), the son of Maia, was the father of the twin Lares, a genealogy that sheds light on the collocation of ceremonies on the Kalends of May. On May 15, the Ides, Mercury was honored as a patron of merchants and increaser of profit (through an etymological connection with &quot;merx, merces&quot;, &quot;goods, merchandise&quot;), another possible connection with Maia his mother as a goddess who promoted growth.

<text>Day of the Viper is a first-person shooter video game published by Accolade in 1989. As the Viper robot, the player must explore five abandoned hi-tech and heavily guarded buildings in order to find and install floppy disks. The game was compared to &quot;3D Monster Maze&quot;.

==Reception==
The game was reviewed in 1990 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #157 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars. &quot;Zzap!64&quot; noted &quot;Day of the Viper&quot; as &quot;an incredibly similar game&quot; to &quot;Slaygon&quot; (1988), which is made by the same developers. Further commenting that &quot;Charging £19.95 for a game that&#x27;s two years old (and doesn&#x27;t seem to have been updated) is a bit suspect.&quot;

<text>An infiltration gallery is a structure including perforated conduits in gravel to expedite transfer of water to or from a soil.

==Water supply==
Infiltration galleries may be used to collect water from the aquifer underlying a river. Water from an infiltration gallery has the advantage of bank filtration to reduce the water treatment requirements for a surface withdrawal. An infiltration gallery may also be the best way to withdraw water from a thin aquifer or lens of fresh water overlying saline water.

==Storm water disposal==
Infiltration galleries may be used to supplement a storm sewer, by directing storm runoff from non-road areas.

While the catchbasins under sewer grates work well on swift-flowing surfaces like asphalt and concrete, heavy storm water flow on grass lawns or other open areas will pool in low areas if there is no outlet. An infiltration gallery serves this purpose in two ways.

Primarily, upright plastic pipes capped with simple grates are placed every 5–8 metres along the low point of a slope, to handle heavy surface runoff. The pipes proceed straight down, about two metres, to a horizontal cross-pipe; this pipe is the secondary system.

About ten per cent of the surface area of a horizontal pipe is then perforated slightly and surrounded by gravel. Initially, runoff will exit the pipe and &quot;infiltrate&quot; the gravel to the soil beyond, dissipating naturally. As flow increases, the water will eventually fill the pipe and need to be dissipated more quickly. Thus, a catchbasin is placed at the lowest point of the sloping ground, which is connected to the storm sewer system at large.

Such galleries are a relatively new development in urban planning, and are thus found in newer housing developments.

<text>Maia , designated 20 Tauri (abbreviated 20 Tau), is a star in the constellation of Taurus. It is a blue giant of spectral type B8 III, a chemically peculiar star, and the prototype of the Maia variable class of variable star.

Maia is the fourth-brightest star in the Pleiades open star cluster (Messier 45), after Alcyone, Atlas and Electra. It is surrounded by one of the brighter reflection nebulae within the Pleiades, designated NGC 1432 and sometimes called the Maia Nebula.

== Nomenclature ==
The name &quot;Maia&quot; originates with the and . Maia is one of the seven daughters of Atlas and Pleione in Greek mythology—stars which are also included in the Pleiades star cluster. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included &quot;Maia&quot; for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

&quot;20 Tauri&quot; is the star&#x27;s Flamsteed designation. Although it is about the 15th brightest star in Taurus, Maia does not have a Bayer designation, but does have the Bright Star Catalogue designation HR 1149 and the Henry Draper Catalogue designation HD 23408. It has been listed as double star WDS J03458+2422; one companion is a 14th magnitude star nearly away that is probably an unrelated background object. The primary is listed as being double following observations of a lunar occultation, but later observations have failed to find any evidence of it being double.

== Description ==

The distance to Maia has been measured by the Gaia spacecraft using the annual parallax method. In Gaia Data Release 2, the parallax is given as , corresponding to a distance of . The 2007 new Hipparcos reduction gives a statistically more accurate parallax of , indicating a distance of . Analysis of Gaia parallaxes for the whole Pleiades cluster give an average distance of , while VLBI measurements of multiple members give a distance of .

Maia&#x27;s visual magnitude is 3.87, requiring darker skies to be seen. Its bolometric luminosity is 501 times that of the sun, mostly in the ultraviolet, thus suggesting a radius of 3.6 times that of the Sun and a mass of 3.8 solar masses. Interferometric measurements give an angular diameter of , suggesting a radius of assuming a distance of . These measurements also allow the effective temperature to be estimated at .

Maia is a chemically peculiar star, meaning it has an unusual surface abundance of some elements as shown by its spectral lines. It is classified as a helium-weak star, but it also shows an excess of some elements including manganese.
Maia was thought to be a variable star by astronomer Otto Struve. He proposed a class of stars known as Maia variables, which included Gamma Ursae Minoris. Examination of the &quot;Hipparcos&quot; data for Maia and some others in the class found no evidence of variability. On the other hand, White &quot;et al.&quot; found low amplitude, but unambiguous, variability in Maia&#x27;s brightness as seen by &quot;Kepler&quot;/K2, with a period of 10.3 days, which they attribute to the rotation of a starspot. Intense study of large numbers of stars suggest that 6.7% of stars with temperatures between and show rapid small-amplitude pulsations but are not members of other variable star classes. These are potentially Maia variables. Ironically, if the White &quot;et al.&quot; results are correct, Maia is a variable star, but not a &quot;Maia&quot; variable star.

Maia is surrounded by the Maia Nebula (also known as NGC 1432), a reflection nebula that is one of the brightest patches of nebulosity within the Pleiades star cluster. It is the only member of the New General Catalogue discovered photographically.

==Mythology==
Maia was the oldest of seven beautiful sisters known as the Pleiades. She was impregnated by Zeus, thereby conceiving Hermes, the messenger god. As Maia and the Pleiades are visible in the winter night sky along with the constellation Orion, the Greek myths tell of Maia and her sisters being pursued by the giant huntsman and turned into doves to preserve their safety.

<text>Los Lonely Boys are an American musical group from San Angelo, Texas. They play a style of music they call &quot;Texican Rock n&#x27; Roll&quot;, combining elements of rock and roll, Texas blues, brown-eyed soul, country, and Tejano music.

The band consists of three brothers: Henry (guitar, vocals), Jojo (bass guitar, vocals), and Ringo (drums, vocals) Garza Sr. They follow the tradition of their father, Enrique Garza, who formed a band with his brothers called the Falcones. The Falcones played conjunto music in South Texas during the 1970s and 1980s. The debut single by Los Lonely Boys, &quot;Heaven&quot;, was a number-one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; adult contemporary chart and reached the top 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 2004. In 2009, they signed to an Austin-based indie label, Playing in Traffic Records, and released an EP, &quot;1969&quot;, and three albums under their LonelyTone imprint, &quot;Keep On Giving: Acoustic Live!&quot;, &quot;Rockpango&quot;, and their newest release, &quot;Revelation&quot;.

==Musical career==
The three brothers were discovered by a local club owner, John R. Steele, who hired them as his house band. When they started to attract attention in San Angelo they hired Mr. Steele as a road manager and they went on the road, finally ending up in Nashville where they landed a recording contract in the 1990s. After moving back to their home state of Texas, they recorded an album in 2003 in Austin at Willie Nelson&#x27;s Pedernales Recording Studio. The album was initially released by Or Music and later acquired by Epic Records for distribution in March 2004.

The group&#x27;s first single, &quot;Heaven&quot;, reached number one on the Adult Contemporary chart, and number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and number 11 at top 40. &quot;Heaven&quot; was featured in &quot;Guitar Hero: On Tour&quot;. In 2005, the song won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. Other songs nominated for Grammys include &quot;More Than Love&quot; and &quot;Onda&quot;, both in 2006.

In 2005, the group recorded &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Lose Your Love&quot; with Carlos Santana for the Santana album &quot;All That I Am&quot;. In June of that year, the group appeared in an episode of CMT&#x27;s &quot;Crossroads&quot; show with country music legend Ronnie Milsap. Their 2006 album, &quot;Sacred&quot;, features the song &quot;Outlaws&quot;. In a &quot;closing of the circle&quot;, Enrique Garza Sr. sings the verse about the &quot;missing outlaws, just like me&quot;. Willie Nelson, who is credited on the 2004 album, also provided a verse which makes reference to his hit &quot;On the Road Again&quot;.

In 2007, Los Lonely Boys participated in Amnesty International&#x27;s Make Some Noise project. Their cover of John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Whatever Gets You thru the Night&quot; is the second single from the &quot;Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur&quot;. The song was released on iTunes on April 17, with the entire album available on June 12 courtesy of Warner Bros. Records. &quot;Whatever Gets You thru the Night&quot; is noteworthy as John Lennon&#x27;s only US number-one solo single while he was alive.

Their third studio album, &quot;Forgiven&quot;, was released on July 1, 2008. The album was recorded at East Side Stages in Austin and was produced by Steve Jordan. On October 23, 2008, Los Lonely Boys sang the national anthem to open game two of the 2008 World Series in St. Petersburg, Florida.

In March 2009, Los Lonely Boys left Sony/Epic and signed with Austin-based Playing In Traffic Records. In March 2010, the group was awarded &quot;Best Rock Band&quot; in the Austin Music Awards.

The trio released a tribute EP titled &quot;1969&quot; on October 13, 2009, paying homage to the 40th anniversary of the titular year with covers of Santana&#x27;s &quot;Evil Ways&quot;, The Doors&#x27; &quot;Roadhouse Blues&quot;, Blind Faith&#x27;s version of Buddy Holly&#x27;s &quot;Well All Right&quot;, The Beatles&#x27; &quot;She Came in Through the Bathroom Window&quot;, and Tony Joe White&#x27;s &quot;Polk Salad Annie&quot;. The EP was produced by Andy Johns and marked the first release on their new label.

Following their 2009-2010 tour, which included roughly 200 shows seen by over 350,000 fans, Los Lonely Boys headed back to the studio to complete their fourth full-length studio album. It was announced on January 14, 2011, that the new album, entitled &quot;Rockpango&quot; (a Spanglish word that means &quot;rock party&quot;), would be released on March 29. &quot;Rockpango&quot;, which features 11 original tracks, marks the first full-length studio album released by the band on their LonelyTone imprint for Playing in Traffic Records. A deluxe edition of the album will include three bonus songs, a behind-the-scenes video, and a fold-out poster of the cover art.

In early 2014, Los Lonely Boys released their fifth studio album, &quot;Revelation&quot;. The album represents new territory for the Boys, with the conjunto touches on &quot;Blame It On Love&quot; and the reggae groove of &quot;Give a Little More&quot;, among many other new sonic elements.

In 2016, the band recorded a cover version of John Fogerty&#x27;s &quot;Born on the Bayou&quot;, to be included in the project &quot;Quiero Creedence&quot;. This album, scheduled for July 2016 release, is a tribute to Creedence Clearwater Revival by various Latin recording artists.

In October 2019, Los Lonely Boys canceled all upcoming performances after Jojo Garza announced he was leaving the group, causing the band to take a temporary hiatus.

On April 21, 2022, with Jojo having allegedly changed his mind after two years, Los Lonely Boys announced they were joining The Who on some tour dates in Dallas, Houston, and Oklahoma City. They announced alongside it that they had officially reunited, with new music and additional shows coming soon.

<doc id="820607" wikidata="Q7033130" url="?curid=820607" title="Niggas vs. Black People">
<text>&quot;Niggas vs. Black People&quot; is a Chris Rock stand-up comedy routine appearing both on his 1996 HBO special &quot;Bring the Pain&quot;, and as track 12 on his 1997 album &quot;Roll with the New&quot;, which went a long way towards establishing his status as a comedy fixture after he left &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

The routine is a twelve-minute monologue about behaviors that are a subset of the African-American community. He describes &quot;niggas&quot; as a cohort whose behavior is usually detrimental to the image of other black people. &quot;Niggas&quot;, he says, glorify ignorance and sloth, and brag about fulfilling any minor responsibility. Rock rejects the view that this image of blacks is purely cultivated by the media and stereotypes, at one point saying: &quot;When I go to the money machine tonight, alright, I ain&#x27;t looking over my back for the media, I&#x27;m looking for niggas! Shit, Ted Koppel ain&#x27;t never took shit from me. Niggas have, so, you think I&#x27;ve got three guns in my house &#x27;cause the media outside?&quot;

==Inspiration==

In a 2007 interview, Rock explained that the inspiration for the bit came from the song &quot;Us&quot; from the 1991 Ice Cube album &quot;Death Certificate&quot;.

==Retirement==

The controversy caused by Rock&#x27;s constant use of the word &quot;nigger&quot; led him to remove the rant from his show. In a 2005 &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview, Rock said: &quot;By the way, I&#x27;ve never done that joke again, ever, and I probably never will. &#x27;Cos some people that were racist thought they had license to say so, I&#x27;m done with that routine.&quot;

==Cultural impact==

Barack Obama directly referred to the routine while campaigning to be elected president during a Father&#x27;s Day speech on June 15, 2008, saying: &quot;Chris Rock had a routine. He said some—too many of our men, they&#x27;re proud, they brag about doing things they&#x27;re supposed to do. They say &#x27;Well, I—I&#x27;m not in jail.&#x27; Well, you&#x27;re not supposed to be in jail!&quot;

In the second episode of the first season of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Office&quot;, &quot;Diversity Day&quot;, the main character Michael Scott performs a version of this skit, which results in a day-long racial sensitivity seminar for the office staff.

<doc id="820611" wikidata="Q1531578" url="?curid=820611" title="Micaiah">
<text>Micaiah ( &quot;Mīḵāyəhū&quot; &quot;Who is like Yah?&quot;), son of Imlah, is a prophet in the Hebrew Bible. He is one of the four disciples of Elijah and not to be confused with Micah, prophet of the Book of Micah.

==Prophecy==
The events leading up to the appearance of Micaiah are illustrated in 1 Kings 22:1–12. In 1 Kings 22:1–4, Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah goes to visit the King of Israel (identified later, in 1 Kings 22:20, as Ahab), and asks if he will go with him to take over Ramoth-gilead which was under the rule of the king of Aram. Jehoshaphat the Judahite requests that Ahab the Israelite, &quot;Inquire first for the word of the Lord&quot; (1 Kings 22:5). Ahab then calls on his prophets and asks if he should go into battle against Ramoth-gilead. The prophets responded by telling the king of Israel to go into battle, stating that the Lord (Adonai) will deliver Ramoth-gilead into the hand of the king (1 Kings 22:6). Jehoshaphat asks if there are any other prophets of whom to inquire the word of the Lord (YHWH). Ahab mentions Micaiah the son of Imlah, but expresses dislike for him because his past (1 Kings 20:13–43) prophecies have not been in favor of him (1 Kings 22:7–8). A messenger is sent to bring Micaiah to the king to give his prophecy. The messenger tells Micaiah to give a favorable prophecy to Ahab (1 Kings 22:12–13).

Micaiah replies to the messenger that he will speak whatever the Lord says to him (1 Kings 22:14). Micaiah appears before the king of Israel, and when asked if Ahab should go into battle at Ramoth-gilead Micaiah initially responds with a similar prophecy to that of the other prophets in a mocking manner (1 Kings 22:15b). Ahab then questions Micaiah, and insists that he speak nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord. Micaiah then gives a true prophecy, in which he illustrates a meeting of Yahweh with the heavenly hosts. At this meeting Yahweh asks who will entice Ahab to go into battle so that he may perish (1 Kings 22:19–20). A spirit comes forward, and offers to &quot;be a lying spirit in the mouth of the prophets&quot; (1 Kings 22:22). Therefore, the prophecies of the other prophets were a result of the lying spirit. Zedekiah, leader of the 400 prophets who spoke in favor of Ahab, strikes Micaiah and claims God speaks through him. As a result of Micaiah&#x27;s prophecy, Ahab ordered Micaiah imprisoned until he returned from battle, unharmed (1 Kings 22:27).

Perhaps concerned about the prophecy, Ahab disguised himself in battle rather than lead his troops openly as their king. However, Ahab was killed in battle after being struck by a randomly shot arrow. Micaiah&#x27;s prophecy was fulfilled, contrary to the word of 400 false prophets, all of whom encouraged Ahab to attack with a prediction of victory.

This account is also recorded in 2 Chronicles, Chapter 18.

==Interpretation==
===Rabbinical interpretation===
The Babylonian Talmud (b.Sanhedrin 89a) accepts that the scene literally occurred in heaven. Against this Judah Halevi (&quot;Kuzari&quot; 3.73) considered the &quot;prophecy&quot; to be an example of the prophet&#x27;s own rhetoric. This rhetoric is clear from the contrast of syntax used for the divination: &quot;the word of Y-H-V-H&quot; and &quot;the spirit of Y-H-V-H&quot; (2 Chronicles 18:23, 27). David Kimhi argues that &quot;prophecy is true by definition&quot;, the spirit of Lord is often represented as an irrational and emotional response unlike the word of Lord, and following Judah Halevi also critically assesses that Micaiah might have himself presented the vivid scene, using poetic dramatization to frighten and convince Ahab—&quot;not that he saw these things, nor did he hear them.&quot; &quot;On 1 Kgs 22: 19–23, Radak adopts a bolder strategy to avoid a rational dilemma that never distressed the Rabbis. In that passage, the prophet Micaiah, responding to Ahab&#x27;s false prophets who predicted military success against Aram, describes a vision of God sending a &quot;lying spirit&quot; to mislead the king. Radak rejects the rabbinic view (b. Sanh. 89 a) that this scene occurred in heaven, arguing that God could not have sent false prophecy, since &quot;prophecy is true by definition&quot;. Instead, he argues that Micaiah actually fabricated this vivid scene, using poetic dramatization (divre meliza ... derekh haza&#x27;at devarim) to frighten and thereby prevail upon Ahab.&quot; Pseudo-Epiphanius (&quot;Opera,&quot; ii. 245) makes Micah an Ephraimite. Confounding him with Micaiah, son of Imlah (I Kings xxii. 8 et seq.), he states that Micah, for his inauspicious prophecy, was killed by order of Ahab through being thrown from a precipice, and was buried at Morathi (Maroth?; Mic. i. 12), near the cemetery of Enakim (Ένακεὶμ Septuagint rendering of ; ib. i. 10). According to &quot;Gelilot Ereẓ Yisrael&quot; (quoted in &quot;Seder ha-Dorot,&quot; i. 118, Warsaw, 1889), Micah was buried in Chesil, a town in southern Judah (Josh. xv. 30). Naboth&#x27;s soul was the lying spirit that was permitted to deceive Ahab to his death.

===Modern scholarly interpretation===
Micaiah prophesies as though he was present at the meeting between Yahweh and the heavenly hosts. Michael Coogan of Harvard compared the prophecy of Micaiah to that of several other prophets, including Isaiah&#x27;s vision of the Divine Council (Isaiah 6:1–8). In Jeremiah 23, Yahweh warns against false prophecies. However, Coogan argued that unlike Isaiah 6 and Jeremiah 23, in 1 Kings 22 Yahweh&#x27;s actions to allow false prophecy to be given are deliberate and intentional. It appears as though Yahweh has an ulterior motive, and that is for Ahab to die, in this case at the battle at Ramoth-gilead.

R. W. L. Moberly of Durham University discussed Micaiah&#x27;s prophecy in &quot;Does God Lie to His Prophets? The Story of Micaiah ben Imlah as a Test Case.&quot; In his article, Moberly discussed Hebrew prophecy as &quot;relational, engaging language that seeks a response.&quot; Moberly called into question the honesty of Yahweh particularly in relation to integrity and the concept of loving and forgiving God. He suggested that for the Deuteronomistic historians who were the compilers of the text, the compassion of Yahweh is delivered by challenging and engaging the human will for repentance or bringing forth change or obduracy. Dependency dynamics and will of the Lord rooted in foreknowledge is revealed in 1 Kings 21:27–29.

==Heavenly throne room==
The prophecy is probably the earliest example in the Hebrew Bible of a representation of a heavenly throne room. It is not clear whether the heavenly throne room represents Micaiah&#x27;s own belief or a depiction of Ahab&#x27;s court prophets without discrediting them entirely like the prophet Zedekiah ben Chenaanah, who struck him after his non-populist prophecy (1 Kings 22:24). The focus of voice from the heavenly throne is concerned for the people while Ahab the earthly king&#x27;s response is self-centered, it reflects the difference in the two approaches, a characteristic of post-exile exemplification in the scripture.

<text>The Waterman Pen Company is a major manufacturing company of luxury fountain pens and inks, based in Paris, France. The firm was established in 1884 in New York City by Lewis Waterman, being one of the few remaining first-generation fountain pen companies, as &quot;Waterman S.A.&quot;

Since 2000 Waterman has been owned by the American group Newell Brands, through its subsidiary, Sanford L.P.

==History==
Lewis Waterman, an insurance salesman in New York City, invented the first truly functional fountain pen in the early 1880s. An apocryphal story is that a typical pen of the day leaked all over a contract he had prepared for a large policy, and by the time Waterman returned with a new document, his client had signed with someone else. Later, Waterman was working as a pen salesman in New York for a new company founded in the spring of 1883 by a volatile inventor named Frank Holland. Holland abandoned his company after only six weeks; Waterman stepped in and took over, fitting the pens with a simplified feed of his own design. It was for this &quot;three fissure feed&quot; that his first pen-related patent was granted in 1884.
From the beginning, competition in the fountain pen industry was fierce, both in the marketplace and the courtroom. Despite later company literature that depicts Lewis E. Waterman as a golden-hearted innocent, all evidence indicates that he was a tough, savvy, and innovative businessman. In 1899 the L.E. Waterman Company developed the &quot;spoon Feed&quot; system which prevented the overflow of ink, which also led to the company receiving the gold medal of excellence at the &quot;Exposition Universelle&quot; in Paris in 1900.

Nonetheless, it was after L.E. Waterman&#x27;s death in 1901 that the company took off. Under the leadership of Waterman&#x27;s nephew, Frank D. Waterman, the Waterman Pen Company expanded aggressively worldwide. While Waterman introduced its share of innovations, the company&#x27;s main selling point was always quality and reliability.

In 1905 Waterman patented their first permanently attached pen clip, allowing a pen to be held directly in a pocket. In 1908 Waterman released their first retractable nib &quot;safety&quot; pen.

As the 20th century wore on, Waterman&#x27;s conservatism allowed its younger and more innovative competitors to gain market share—Parker, Sheaffer, and Wahl-Eversharp in particular. By the later 1920s, Waterman was attempting to catch up; it continued to struggle through and beyond World War II before finally shutting down in 1954.
Waterman&#x27;s French subsidiary, Waterman-JiF (Jules-Isidore Fagard) later Waterman S.A., continued to prosper and eventually absorbed what remained of the American company and its British arm.

The Waterman company was acquired by the Bic company which went public in 1958 with a reverse merger; Bic would later sell off the Waterman division.

Successfully weathering the challenge of the ballpoint pen, it was acquired by The Gillette Company in March 1987 which grew overall sales by 40% with its aggressive North American sales and later sold to Sanford, a division of Newell Rubbermaid (now known as Newell Brands), along with the Parker Pen Division, which Gillette acquired in 1993.

== Pens ==

Early Waterman pens were made of hard rubber and were equipped with 14K gold nibs. From early on, precious metal trim and overlays were offered. Many are still in use today, and their nibs are prized for their smoothness and flexibility.

Waterman&#x27;s high production volume from c. 1900 on means that vintage examples are comparatively easy to find today. The most common models from the hard rubber era are the #12 slip-cap eyedropper, the #52 screw-cap lever-filler, and the #42 retracting-nib safety pen. Though largely ignored by present-day collectors, the Waterman C/F of 1953 introduced the modern plastic ink cartridge.

In 1983 and celebrating the company&#x27;s 100th anniversary, Waterman created the Le Man 100, aiming its products at the luxury writing market. Former French President François Mitterrand was known for carrying two wherever he went.

As Waterman progressed into the modern era, it produced many of the pens that are still available today including the Edson, the Exception, the Philéas, the Hémisphère, the Expert, the Harmonie, the Charleston, the Ici et Là, the Audace, the Sérénité, the Liaison, and the Carène.

<doc id="820638" wikidata="Q182124" url="?curid=820638" title="Myasishchev M-4">
<text>The Myasishchev M-4 &quot;Molot&quot; (), USAF/DoD reporting name &quot;Type 37&quot;, ASCC reporting name Bison) was a four-engined strategic bomber designed by Vladimir Mikhailovich Myasishchev and manufactured by the Soviet Union in the 1950s to provide a Long Range Aviation bomber capable of attacking targets in North America.

The aircraft fell well short of its intended range and was not fully capable of attacking the most valuable targets in the United States. As this became clear, production was shut down. In spite of the failure to produce a capable strategic design and the resulting small numbers, the M-4 nevertheless sparked fears of a &quot;bomber gap&quot; when 18 of the aircraft were flown in a public demonstration on May Day in 1954. The US responded by building thousands of Boeing B-47s and B-52s to counter this perceived threat.

The design was updated with more efficient engines, inflight refuelling (IFR) support and the removal of the glass nose for optical bombing and moving the radar to this location. With these changes, production restarted as the 3M. Even with these modifications the design was not truly effective in the nuclear bomber role, and only 125 aircraft, both M-4s and 3Ms, were produced before the production line was shut down for good in 1963. Only 19 of these served on nuclear alert.

M-4s and 3Ms were primarily used as long-range maritime reconnaissance and strike aircraft and other supporting roles. Most were converted in the 1970s and 80s to tanker aircraft, especially as the Tupolev Tu-22M took over the maritime missions. The tanker conversions remained in service until 1994. Most surviving examples were broken up as part of post-Cold War arms limitations agreements.

The M-4 was the first four-engine jet bomber deployed operationally by the Soviet Union.

==Design and development==
Following World War II, the Soviet Union prioritized developing a long-range strategic bomber capable of delivering atomic weapons. Their first aircraft was the Tupolev Tu-4, a reverse-engineered version of the American B-29 Superfortress. The Tu-4 was only ever a stop-gap solution, as unlike the American strategic bomber force that could operate from bases in allied countries close to the USSR, it lacked the range to reach the continental United States, and experiences in the Korean War demonstrated piston engine bombers were extremely vulnerable to jet fighter interception. With the advancement of Western jet bombers like the B-47 Stratojet and Vickers Valiant, Vladimir Mikhailovich Myasishchev was directed to construct a &quot;strategichesky dalny bombardirovshchik&quot; (SDB) (стратегический дальный бомбардировщик (СДБ), &quot;strategic long-range bomber&quot;) in spring of 1951. The first M-4 (Bison-A) prototype flew on 20 January 1953, and was handed over to state acceptance trials in March 1954, with production beginning later that year. It entered service in 1955, with 34 being built including two prototypes.

The M-4 was made mostly of aircraft aluminum alloys with some steel and magnesium components. It had wings swept at 35-degrees and powered initially by four Mikulin AM-3A engines with a maximum thrust of 85.8 kN (8,750 kgp; 19,290 lbf), but later upgraded to RD-3M-500 turbojets with a maximum thrust of 93.2 kN (9,500 kgp; 20,940 lbf). There were 18 bladder fuel tanks in the fuselage and wings, providing a total fuel capacity of 123,600 liters (32,610 US gallons); this gave the aircraft a range of , although this fell short of the range initially specified. It had a payload of 24 tonnes (26.4 tons) in various configurations. Defensive armament consisted of six AM-23 23 mm cannons with a rate of fire of 1,250 rpm each in a manned twin tail turret with 400 rounds per gun and two twin remote controlled turrets in the top and bottom fuselage with 300 rounds per gun each. The aircraft had a crew of eight: a navigator/bombardier in the nose; pilot and copilot in the cockpit; radar operator/navigator, flight engineer/gunner, radio operator/gunner, and dorsal turret gunner in a compartment behind the cockpit; and a tail gunner.

===3M===
While the M-4 had less range than the Tupolev Tu-95, it had greater speed and payload, sufficient advantages to continue improving on the design. In 1954, approval was granted for a redesign of the M-4, which flew on 27 March 1956 and began state trials in early 1958. The 3M &quot;Bison-B&quot; was powered by four Dobrynin RD-7 turbojets, which had the same thrust as the RD-3M but were 25% more fuel efficient; a nose inflight refueling probe was also added to further increase range. The center fuselage was considerably redesigned to reduce weight and improve aerodynamics, and the wings were updated with a wider span and area. 74 Bison-Bs would be built.

===Tanker===
From the outset when the M-4&#x27;s range shortfall became apparent, Myasishchev began investigating inflight refueling (IFR). In 1955, the second production aircraft was modified to a hose-&amp;-drogue tanker configuration and the first production aircraft was fitted with an IFR probe above the nose, with two more converted for trials the following year. From the late 1950s, the M-4 fleet was converted to the tanker configuration through the fit of a hose-drum unit (HDU) and fuel tanks in the bomb bay and removal of all defensive armament. Similar conversions were performed to the 3M fleet in the 1970s and 1980s, the 3MS-1 &quot;Bison-B&quot; becoming the &quot;3MS-2&quot; tanker and the 3MN-1 becoming the &quot;3MN-2&quot; tanker.

==Operational history==

The M-4 was first displayed to the public in Red Square, on May Day, 1954. The aircraft was a surprise to the United States, which had not known that the Soviets had built a jet bomber. However, it soon became clear that the bomber had an insufficient range to attack the United States and still return to the Soviet Union. Only a few of the original production M-4s were actually put into service. To remedy this problem, the Myasishchev design bureau introduced the 3M, known to the West as the &#x27;Bison-B&#x27;, which was considerably more powerful than the previous version. This new model first flew in 1955. Among other things, two of the five original gun barbettes were removed to lighten the aircraft.

In July 1955 American observers saw 28 Bisons in two groups during a Soviet air show. The United States government believed that the bomber was in mass production, and the Central Intelligence Agency estimated that 800 would be available by 1960. The display was a hoax; the first group of ten repeated the flyby with eight more. The classified estimates led, however, to American politicians warning of a &quot;bomber gap&quot;.

The new airplane was not for the Soviet Air Force (VVS), but rather for the Naval Aviation (AV-MF). Though it could still not bomb Washington, D.C., the 3M had a sufficient range to fulfill the need for a long-range maritime patrol aircraft. In 1959, the 3M broke numerous world records for payload to height, including to and to .

However, it was thought by the West (and would continue to be thought until 1961) that the 3M was the original M-4, meaning that the capability of the M-4 was vastly overestimated by Western intelligence agencies.

In the early 1960s, the &#x27;Bison-C&#x27;, with a specialized search radar, was introduced. By this time, many of the original M-4s had been converted to M-4-2 fuel tankers for aerial refueling. Later, 3Ms were converted to 3MS-2 and 3MN-2 tankers as well.

Neither the M-4 nor the 3M ever saw combat, and none were ever converted for low-altitude attack, as many American B-52s were, nor were any ever exported to the Soviet Union&#x27;s allies. However, it is a different story when it comes to aerial refueling aircraft.

Production of the Bison aircraft stopped in 1963, by which time 93 of them had been built. The last aircraft, an M-4-2 fuel tanker, was withdrawn from service in 1994.

The three VM-T heavy lift aircraft were converted from 3MN-2 tankers, with very large loads carried piggy-back above the fuselage. The single vertical fin/rudder was replaced with two large rectangular fin/rudders at the tips of the horizontal stabilizers to improve control due to the turbulence caused by the cargo pod.

With the withdrawal of the Myasishchev bombers and tankers the vast majority of the retired airframes were broken up under the terms of the relevant arms limitation treaty.

<text>Virgilio Dávila Cabrera (January 28, 1869 – August 22, 1943), was a Puerto Rican poet from the modern literary era, educator, politician and businessman.

==Early years==
Dávila was born in the town of Toa Baja. he was influenced by the literary collection of his parents, both of whom were teachers, at an early age. He attended private schools where he received both his primary and secondary education. Dávila earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree from the Civil Institute of Higher Learning in 1895. He taught school in the town of Gurabo.

==Career==
Dávila and his wife had a son on October 7, 1898, José Antonio Dávila, in the City of Bayamón, who would one day take after his father and become a poet himself. His experiences as a teacher and in agriculture later reflected in his poetry. In 1903, Dávila published his first book of poems &quot;Patria&quot;. In this book he included poems which he wrote about Jose de Diego, Federico Degetau and Lola Rodríguez de Tió. He also included poems about the island and love in general. In 1904, Dávila became director of the weekly publication &quot;Chantelier&quot;, which he co-founded with Braulio Dueño Colón.

In 1905, Dávila ran for Mayor of the Municipality of Bayamon. He won the election and served as the municipality&#x27;s mayor from 1905 to 1910.

Together with Dueño Colon and Manuel Fernandez Juncos, he prepared a book of school songs. Dávila wrote many poems that were published in many publications and newspapers of the day. He also wrote a book for his grandchildren, titled &quot;A Book for my Grandchildren&quot; in 1928. Dávila&#x27;s style, considered traditional, was greatly influenced by Victor Hugo.

==Written works==
Among his better known poems are:
* &quot;Patria&quot; (1903)
* &quot;Viviendo y Amando&quot; (1912)
* &quot;Aromas del Terruño&quot; (1916)
* &quot;Nostalgia&quot;
* &quot;No des tu Tierra al Extraño&quot;.
The following is a short version of &quot;No des tu Tierra al Extraño&quot; (&quot;Do not give your land to a stranger!&quot;):
==Later years==
Dávila died in the City of Bayamón on August 22, 1943. He is buried in that city&#x27;s Porta Coeli Cemetery. A public housing complex, a school, and an avenue in Bayamón bear the name of Dávila in his honor.

<doc id="820652" wikidata="Q958393" url="?curid=820652" title="John Frost (British Army officer)">
<text>Major General John Dutton Frost, (31 December 1912 – 21 May 1993) was an airborne officer of the British Army, best known for being the leader of the small group of British airborne troops that actually arrived at Arnhem bridge during the Battle of Arnhem in Operation Market Garden, in the Second World War. He was one of the first to join the newly formed Parachute Regiment and served with distinction in many wartime airborne operations, such as in North Africa and Sicily and Italy, until his injury and subsequent capture at Arnhem. He retired from the army in 1968 to become a beef cattle farmer in West Sussex.

==Early life and military career==
John Dutton Frost was born in Poona, British India, on 31 December 1912. He was the son of Frank Dutton Frost, a British Army officer, and his wife, Elsie Dora (née Bright). He was educated, initially, at Wellington College, Berkshire, but was transferred to Monkton Combe School, Somerset in 1929 due to lack of progress. He would later leave Monkton Combe School off his &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; entry.

On leaving Monkton he followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps and joined the British Army. On graduation from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst on 1 September 1932, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles). He was promoted on 1 September 1935 to lieutenant. Frost served with his regiment&#x27;s 2nd Battalion, then commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Riddell-Webster, in the United Kingdom before the battalion, now commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas Graham, was sent to Palestine during the early stages of the Arab revolt. From 1938 to 1941 Frost worked with the Iraq Levies, receiving a promotion to captain on 1 September 1940.

==Second World War==
===Return to the United Kingdom===
Returning to the United Kingdom in September 1941, Frost initially served with the 10th Battalion, Cameronians, a Territorial Army (TA) unit which formed part of the 45th Brigade of Major-General Philip Christison&#x27;s 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division, before later volunteering to join the Parachute Regiment in the same year. He was posted to the 2nd Parachute Battalion, part of Brigadier Richard Gale&#x27;s 1st Parachute Brigade, itself forming part of the 1st Airborne Division, whose General Officer Commanding (GOC) was Major-General Frederick Browning.

===Operation Biting===
Frost distinguished himself in Operation Biting, a raid to dismantle and steal the radar dish or components of the German Würzburg radar at Bruneval. The raid was the second time the fledgling British parachute regiment was called on. C Company under the then Major Frost was given the task and on 27 February 1942, 120 men landed. They met stiff opposition but succeeded in stealing the component as well as capturing a German radar technician. The operation lost three men killed, six wounded and six made prisoners of war. Prime Minister Winston Churchill applauded the raid and guaranteed further wartime operations for the paratroopers. Frost was awarded the Military Cross.

===North Africa===
During the Allied landings in North Africa British airborne units landed in Tunisia, which included the 1st Para Brigade, which was detached from the rest of the division and now commanded by Brigadier Edwin Flavell. At this time Frost, who was now an acting lieutenant-colonel and in command of his battalion, was tasked to attack enemy airfields near Depienne 30 miles south of Tunis. The airfields were found to be abandoned and the armour column they were supposed to meet up with at Oudna never arrived, leaving Frost&#x27;s battalion 50 miles behind enemy lines. Heavily outnumbered and continuously attacked on their route out, they managed to fight their way back to Allied lines but lost 16 officers and 250 men. The battalion carried on fighting with the British First Army through to Tunis. For this action he was awarded his first Distinguished Service Order (DSO) on 11 February 1943.

===Sicily and Italy===
In 1943, Frost&#x27;s battalion, with the rest of the 1st Parachute Brigade, now under Brigadier Gerald Lathbury, was landed in Sicily during Operation Husky with orders to capture a road bridge called Ponte di Primosole. The brigade was hopelessly scattered and the 295 officers and men who reached the bridge found themselves facing the German 4th Parachute Regiment and lost the bridge until the arrival of other Eighth Army units.

Frost&#x27;s last action in this theatre was in Italy when the entire 1st Airborne Division, now commanded by Major-General Ernest Down (but replaced in January 1944 by Major-General Roy Urquhart) after Major-General George F. Hopkinson was killed in September 1943, landed at Taranto by sea.

===Operation Market Garden===
Frost is best known for his involvement in the Battle of Arnhem during Operation Market Garden. During this battle, Frost was to spearhead the 1st Airborne Division&#x27;s assault on the bridge at Arnhem and hold it while the rest of the division made its way there. If all had gone to plan there would have been almost 9,000 men holding Arnhem bridge for the two days it was supposed to take Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks&#x27;s XXX Corps to reach them.

On 17 September 1944, as commander of the 2nd Parachute Battalion, Frost led a mixed group of about 745 lightly armed men who landed near Oosterbeek and marched into Arnhem. The battalion reached the bridge capturing the northern end, but Frost then found that his force was surrounded by the II.SS-Panzerkorps and cut off from the rest of 1st Airborne. Frost was in command during the fierce four-day battle that followed, in which the Germans rained artillery fire onto the paratroopers&#x27; positions, and sent tanks and infantry into some of the most intense fighting seen by either side, with very little mercy shown. The Germans were greatly surprised by the airborne forces&#x27; refusal to surrender and their continuous counterattacks. After a short truce on the third day, when 250 wounded were removed, the battle continued until the remaining paratroopers had run out of ammunition. There were around one hundred paratroopers left.

Following capture, Frost was held as a prisoner of war in Oflag IX-A/H at Spangenberg castle. He was later moved to a hospital in Obermassfeldt. Frost was liberated when the area was overrun by American troops in March 1945.

On 20 September 1945, he was awarded a bar to his DSO for his leadership at Arnhem.

==Later life==
Frost remained in the army after the war, during which time he commanded the 1st Airborne Division&#x27;s Battle School and returned from Norway with the division, still under Major-General Urquhart, back to the United Kingdom, where it was disbanded. He later returned to the 2nd Parachute Battalion, which still formed part of the 1st Parachute Brigade but was transferred to the 6th Airborne Division. Frost led his old battalion during the Palestine Emergency (see 6th Airborne Division in Palestine). While in Palestine he met his future wife, Jean McGregor Lyle, who was there as a welfare worker; they married on 31 December 1947 and had two children, a son and a daughter. Returning to England in late 1946, he attended the Staff College, Camberley, and, after graduating, became a General Staff Officer Grade 2 (GSO2) with the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division, a TA formation, before serving as a GSO1 with the 17th Gurkha Division during the Malayan Emergency. Returning to the United Kingdom, he was, from 1955 to 1957, in command of the Support Weapons Wing of the School of Infantry. He then commanded the 44th Parachute Brigade, another TA formation, composed of part-time soldiers, before receiving promotion to temporary major-general on 11 October 1961, and returning to the 52nd Division, this time as its GOC, a post he would hold for nearly three years.

By the time of his retirement from the army in 1968, Frost had attained the permanent rank of major-general and in addition to his wartime decorations, had been appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1964 New Year Honours.

In 1982, Frost was appointed a deputy lieutenant in the County of West Sussex where he had taken up beef cattle farming on retirement. He was the subject of an episode of the television programme &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on 6 April 1977.

Frost died on 21 May 1993 at the age of 80. He was buried at Milland Cemetery, in West Sussex.

==Biographies, memorials and depiction in the media==

In 1945, the British Army Film and Photographic Unit (AFPU) and J. Arthur Rank Organisation initiated production on a documentary feature film, under the title &quot;Theirs is the Glory&quot;, about Operation Biting/the Battle of Arnhem, directed by Brian Desmond Hurst. The film included fictionalised recreations of events from the battle. John Frost was among 120 Arnhem veterans who played themselves in many scenes.

In 1974, Frost&#x27;s role at Arnhem featured prominently in Cornelius Ryan&#x27;s best-selling non-fictional book &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;. In 1976, Frost acted as a military consultant to Richard Attenborough&#x27;s film adaptation of Ryan&#x27;s book. In the film Frost was portrayed by Anthony Hopkins.

The bridge over the Rhine at Arnhem was renamed &quot;John Frostbrug&quot; (&quot;John Frost Bridge&quot;) in his honour in 1978, despite Frost&#x27;s reported reluctance.

<doc id="820695" wikidata="Q3547397" url="?curid=820695" title="USS Ganges">
<text>USS &quot;Ganges&quot; was a man-of-war in the United States Navy during the Quasi-War with France.

She was originally a fast sailing merchantman, built in Philadelphia in 1794 for the East Indies trade and named for the Ganges, India&#x27;s principal river, which flows into the Bay of Bengal. &quot;Ganges&quot; regularly sailed to Calcutta and Canton. Apparently, she returned to civilian service after serving in the U.S. Navy between 1798 and 1801.

==Service history==
She retained her merchant name when the U.S. Navy purchased her from the firm of Willing and Francis of Philadelphia on 3 May 1798. She cost $58,000 or $80,665, depending on the source. With hostilities with France imminent, the Navy hastily fitted her out, making her the first man-of-war to fit out and get to sea under the second organization of the Navy. In Navy service, she is described as being of 504 tons and carrying 24 guns and a crew of 220 men. Her first captain was Captain Richard Dale, who had returned in her from a voyage to China.

===1798===
&quot;Ganges&quot; sailed from Philadelphia on 24 May 1798 under Richard Dale, whose orders directed him to &quot;seize, take and bring into a port of the United States&quot; French armed ships &quot;committing depredations&quot; within one marine league of the coast between the Capes of Virginia and Long Island. On 13 July, further orders authorized her to take any French armed ship wherever found, but she continued patrol between Cape Henry and Long Island for the protection of the large seaport cities. On 30 July, &quot;Ganges&quot; was directed to return to Philadelphia for refitting, but put into New York City instead because of fever and plague at Philadelphia.

In mid-September 1798, Captain Thomas Tingey relieved Captain Dale and, on 7 December, his ship was ordered to the Windward Passage between Cuba and Hispaniola to join the squadron protecting the Jamaican trade. Cruising in these waters with &quot;General Pinkney&quot; and &quot;South Carolina&quot;, she guarded American merchantmen from seizure by French naval vessels, privateers, and &quot;all armed vessels acting without commission.&quot;

===1799===
On 6 January 1799, off the Island of Tortuga, &quot;Ganges&quot; fell in with the sloop &quot;Ceres&quot;, off her course for no apparent reason and suspected of heading for illegal trade at Cap Français. Tingey detained the captain of &quot;Ceres&quot;, questioned him, and reported to intelligence. The incident occasioned the following passage from Tingey&#x27;s letter of concern to Benjamin Stoddert, the Secretary of the Navy:
On 21 February, officers of the 28-gun English frigate boarded &quot;Ganges&quot; off Cape Nichola Mole, Hispaniola, and demanded all Englishmen aboard. Tingey firmly replied:
The crew gave three cheers, ran to quarters, and called for &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot;. &quot;Surprise&quot; departed.

Having returned home for repairs in March, &quot;Ganges&quot; convoyed &quot;Kingston&quot;, carrying American Consul General Dr. Edward Stevens, to talk with Toussaint Louverture in Haiti. She then cruised the Caribbean from Havana to Puerto Rico, St. Thomas, St. Kitts, St. Bartholomew&#x27;s, Santo Domingo, Barbuda, and Jamaica.

On 21 April off Cape Isabella, she seized the American sloop &quot;Mary&quot;, of Norwich, for illegal trading. That same day, she recaptured the American ship &quot;Eliza&quot; of Charleston. The French privateer &quot;Telemaque&quot;, Captain Arnault, had captured her and she was sailing under a prize crew. &quot;Ganges&quot; sent the two vessels together to Philadelphia.

On 16 June, &quot;Ganges&quot;, with &quot;Norfolk&quot;, captured the 8-gun French privateer sloop &quot;Vainquere&quot; (formerly British &quot;Harlequin&quot;) 16-18 Leagues north north east of Saint Bartholomews after a 90-mile chase lasting more than eight hours and requiring the expenditure of some 40 cannon shot. The privateer&#x27;s crew numbered some 85 men. The prize sailed to St. Christopher&#x27;s, then Norfolk under Captain Pitcher.

The hurricane season approached and it was thought &quot;Ganges&quot; should return to the United States, but Tingey proudly reported his ship could withstand the Caribbean storms:
On 2 July, she put a prize crew on American brig &quot;Young George&quot; because of questionable provenance of ownership of the vessel and the cargo, and was sent into St. Bartolomew. The prize arrived at Newcastle in mid-September. The prize arrived at Newcastle in mid-September.

On 5 August, &quot;Ganges&quot; captured the 6-gun Letter of Marque schooner &quot;La Rabateuse&quot; after a 12-hour chase in which the privateer threw overboard all her guns and endured 13 cannon shot before surrendering. She, USS Pickering, and USS Merrimack recaptured American merchant schooner John on 15 or 16 August 1799, the privateer escaped. Three days later, a small French &quot;letter of marque&quot; being chased by an English privateer surrendered to &quot;Ganges&quot; off St. Thomas. In a letter dated 29 August it&#x27;s stated that she captured a small French pilot boat earlier that mounted no guns, Capt. Tingey said he ransomed the boat back to her owner. She later captured &quot;L&#x27;Eugene&quot; with 28 men and on 2 October recaptured the American schooner &quot;Laurel&quot;, which the French had renamed &quot;L&#x27;Esperance&quot;. She, with , captured a French Letter of Marque, probably early November.

&quot;Ganges&quot; returned to Philadelphia in the fall and Captain John Mullowny relieved Captain Tingey on 16 November at Philadelphia, Pa. She dropped down to Glocester Point on 8 December., she sailed out into Delaware Bay on 20 December for the West Indies, again convoying American merchantmen until May 1800, when she returned to the States.

===1800===
She arrived at Newcastle, Delaware on 3 May, and was ordered to Philadelphia. On 25 May 1800, Captain Mullowny received orders to proceed to Havana, and &quot;Ganges&quot; shortly departed Philadelphia for another eventful cruise. She cleared the Capes of the Delaware on 3 June escorting a convoy. On 19 July, she captured the schooner &quot;Prudent&quot; off the coast of Cuba. On 20 July, she recaptured American brigantine &quot;Dispatch&quot;, captured 11 days earlier by a French barge; and the 21st, the third successful day in a row, took schooner &quot;Phoebe&quot; (120 slaves) off Matanzas. On 28 July, &quot;Ganges&quot; captured French privateer &quot;La Fortune et Louis&quot;. On 24 August, she departed from Havana. In September, her crew ridden with fever, she returned to the United States and was at Newcastle by 20 September. On 17 December, she departed (probably Philadelphia) downstream, anchoring off Reedy Island the next day. By 22 December, she was 3 leagues East southeast of Little Egg Harbor, New Jersey. On 24 December she was anchored off Sandy Hook.

The &quot;Phoebe&quot; and the &quot;Prudent&quot; were two illegal U.S. slave schooners. &quot;Ganges&quot; brought them to Fort Mifflin in Philadelphia as prizes. Mullowny chose Philadelphia because of the city&#x27;s strong anti-slavery sentiments. The 135 Africans on board were detained at the Lazaretto for 31 days while their legal status was established. During their stay, the staff of the Lazaretto nursed the emaciated and diseased slaves back to health. The Pennsylvania Abolition Society took guardianship of the Africans, gave them the last name &quot;Ganges&quot; and dispersed them locally via indentures. Apparently most eventually became part of Pennsylvania&#x27;s population of free blacks.

===1801===
Sailing again 31 January 1801, &quot;Ganges&quot; proceeded with a convoy for Havana. En route she was severely damaged by a storm and put into Basseterre, St. Christopher. Here, Commodore John Barry surveyed the ship on 2 March and found her &quot;unfit for sea.&quot; In a letter dated 20 February to Josiah Parker, chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs, Navy Secretary Stoddert recommended selling her, (not related to the storm damage). Being unable to continue her voyage, &quot;Ganges&quot; remained on the Guadeloupe station until May, then proceeded north with a convoy that reached Philadelphia early in June, probably 8 June. On 10 June 1801, under provision of the Peace Establishment Act, the Navy agent at Philadelphia prepared &quot;Ganges&quot; for sale. She was sold prior to 8 December for $21,000. The Navy was reduced to thirteen vessels and the &quot;Ganges&quot; again became a merchant ship.

==People associated with &quot;Ganges&quot;==
One of the passengers aboard the &quot;Ganges&quot; when it arrived at Philadelphia on 31 March 1806 had an Indian surname, Singh.

Officers and midshipmen of &quot;Ganges&quot; included several future heroes such as Thomas Macdonough, James Lawrence, Jacob Jones, and Daniel Carmick.

<text>Deuteros: The Next Millennium is the sequel to the sci-fi strategy video game &quot;Millennium 2.2&quot;, published by Activision for the Amiga and Atari ST. Ian Bird designed and wrote the game, with graphics by Jai Redman and music by Matt Bates.

== Overview ==
While the game shares themes of space exploration and resource gathering - plus some elements of its interface - with its predecessor, the two are different in gameplay.

The object of &quot;Deuteros&quot; is to mine and manage resources, explore the Solar System and beyond. For this, 3 categories of civilians are trained: Producers, Researchers and Marines, out of a pool of 6000 population. The longer these teams are used, they are advanced in three levels, required for some later action (some inventions can be manufactured only by a producer who is at &quot;Expert&quot; level while Pilots with the rank of &quot;Admiral&quot; will be more effective in battles).

New bases built on other planets must be staffed with new teams of Producers in order to construct the shuttles and derricks needed for supply. Some of these events are &quot;milestones&quot; which will trigger new technology to be researched by the scientists.

The player has to take care mostly of the transaction between the planets and the factories and distribute their supply with shuttles and long-range spacecraft. New technology (such as automation computers or teleport) will replace some of the player&#x27;s involvement, as the player must later concentrate on war.

==Scenario==
The game is set some 800 years after &quot;Millennium&quot;, in a time when mankind has won the struggle to make the Earth habitable again but lost its spacefaring capabilities, when the Martians, moments before they were defeated in Mars, hid a small robotic fleet just when Earth was re-settled, and destroying the Moon Base moments before humans returned to Earth as a final deed of vengeance. Eight centuries later, the humans attempt to reach space travel again and rediscover old secrets.

Initially the player has Earth resources with which they can build ships and orbital factories. The first factory will give the player the technology to make IOSs (interplanetary operations spacecraft) which they can build orbital factories over selected planets and moons of the Solar System. First the player can use the IOS to extract material from asteroids not found on Earth (such as silver, platinum etc.), and later build bases on the selected planets with the orbital factories so that exotic material is steadily produced.

In the process the player will meet the Methanoids, colonists from the first game who declared independence when Earth was re-settled. Now they dominate Trans-Neptunian space and act secretively, only allowing the player to swap mined goods for materials they need.

===War===
Once the player builds a sixth orbital factory (or gets the Methanoid laser from trading a lot with the Methanoids), the Methanoids will declare war, and in the process the player will have to research and manufacture battle drones and also copy the self-destruct mechanism of the enemies. A teleport system (for inanimate objects) will be discovered that will eliminate the need for supply IOSs.

Once the player conquers all of the solar system, they will discover some alien messages and a blueprint for faster-than-light travel. New technology will allow the player to construct SCGs (star-class galleons) and travel to Proxima Centauri, the first of the seven star systems that have to be conquered. In the process the technology &quot;Hyperspace travel&quot; will be acquired.

Winning requires conquering 8 systems and collecting of 8 parts of a mysterious machine scattered by Methanoids.

Upon winning, the game ends with a mini video clip that shows three picture-slots with icons and pictures of in-game objects changing every 3 seconds accompanied by the main music of the game.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Deuteros&quot; was critically well received. &quot;Amiga Format&quot; awarded 95%, &quot;Amiga Power&quot; gave 89%, &quot;CU Amiga&quot; gave 70% and &quot;Zero&quot; awarded 92%.

==Remakes==
A PC remake exists in the beta stage of development.

<text>Direction finding (DF), or radio direction finding (RDF), is the use of radio waves to determine the direction to a radio source. The source may be a cooperating radio transmitter or may be an inadvertant source, a naturally-occurring radio source, or an illicit or enemy system. Radio direction finding differs from radar in that only the direction is determined by any one receiver; a radar system usually also gives a distance to the object of interest, as well as direction. By triangulation, the location of a radio source can be determined by measuring its direction from two or more locations. Radio direction finding is used in radio navigation for ships and aircraft, to locate emergency transmitters for search and rescue, for tracking wildlife, and to locate illegal or interfering transmitters. During the Second World War, radio direction finding was used by both sides to locate and direct aircraft, surface ships, and submarines.

RDF systems can be used with any radio source, although very long wavelengths (low frequencies) require very large antennas, and are generally used only on ground-based systems. These wavelengths are nevertheless used for marine radio navigation as they can travel very long distances &quot;over the horizon&quot;, which is valuable for ships when the line-of-sight may be only a few tens of kilometres. For aerial use, where the horizon may extend to hundreds of kilometres, higher frequencies can be used, allowing the use of much smaller antennas. An automatic direction finder, which could be tuned to radio beacons called non-directional beacons or commercial AM radio broadcasters, was in the 20th century a feature of most aircraft, but is being phased out.

For the military, RDF is a key tool of signals intelligence. The ability to locate the position of an enemy transmitter has been invaluable since World War I, and played a key role in World War II&#x27;s Battle of the Atlantic. It is estimated that the UK&#x27;s advanced &quot;huff-duff&quot; systems were directly or indirectly responsible for 24% of all U-boats sunk during the war. Modern systems often used phased array antennas to allow rapid beamforming for highly accurate results, and are part of a larger electronic warfare suite.

Early radio direction finders used mechanically rotated antennas that compared signal strengths, and several electronic versions of the same concept followed. Modern systems use the comparison of phase or doppler techniques which are generally simpler to automate. Early British radar sets were referred to as RDF, which is often stated was a deception. In fact, the Chain Home systems used large RDF receivers to determine directions. Later radar systems generally used a single antenna for broadcast and reception, and determined direction from the direction the antenna was facing.

==History==

===Early mechanical systems===
The earliest experiments in RDF were carried out in 1888 when Heinrich Hertz discovered the directionality of an open loop of wire used as an antenna. When the antenna was aligned so it pointed at the signal it produced maximum gain, and produced zero signal when face on. This meant there was always an ambiguity in the location of the signal: it would produce the same output if the signal was in front or back of the antenna. Later experimenters also used dipole antennas, which worked in the opposite sense, reaching maximum gain at right angles and zero when aligned. RDF systems using mechanically swung loop or dipole antennas were common by the turn of the 20th century. Prominent examples were patented by John Stone Stone in 1902 (U.S. Patent 716,134) and Lee de Forest in 1904 (U.S. Patent 771,819), among many other examples.

By the early 1900s, many experimenters were looking for ways to use this concept for locating the position of a transmitter. Early radio systems generally used medium wave and longwave signals. Longwave in particular had good long-distance transmission characteristics due to their limited interaction with the ground, and thereby provided excellent great circle route ground wave propagation that pointed directly to the transmitter. Methods of performing RDF on longwave signals was a major area of research during the 1900s and 1910s.

Antennas are generally sensitive to signals only when they have a length that is a significant portion of the wavelength, or larger. Most antennas are at least of the wavelength, more commonly – the half-wave dipole is a very common design. For longwave use, this resulted in loop antennas tens of feet on a side, often with more than one loop connected together to improve the signal. Another solution to this problem was developed by the Marconi company in 1905. This consisted of a number of horizontal wires or rods arranged to point outward from a common center point. A movable switch could connect opposite pairs of these wires to form a dipole, and by rotating the switch the operator could hunt for the strongest signal. The US Navy overcame this problem, to a point, by mounting antennas on ships and sailing in circles. Such systems were unwieldily and impractical for many uses.

===Bellini–Tosi===

A key improvement in the RDF concept was introduced by Ettore Bellini and Alessandro Tosi in 1909 (U.S. Patent 943,960). Their system used two such antennas, typically triangular loops, arranged at right angles. The signals from the antennas were sent into coils wrapped around a wooden frame about the size of a pop can, where the signals were re-created in the area between the coils. A separate loop antenna located in this area could then be used to hunt for the direction, without moving the main antennas. This made RDF so much more practical that it was soon being used for navigation on a wide scale, often as the first form of aerial navigation available, with ground stations homing in on the aircraft&#x27;s radio set. Bellini–Tosi direction finders were widespread from the 1920s into the 1950s.

Early RDF systems were useful largely for long wave signals. These signals are able to travel very long distances, which made them useful for long-range navigation. However, when the same technique was being applied to higher frequencies, unexpected difficulties arose due to the reflection of high frequency signals from the ionosphere. The RDF station might now receive the same signal from two or more locations, especially during the day, which caused serious problems trying to determine the location. This led to the 1919 introduction of the Adcock antenna (UK Patent 130,490), which consisted of four separate monopole antennas instead of two loops, eliminating the horizontal components and thus filtering out the sky waves being reflected down from the ionosphere. Adcock antennas were widely used with Bellini–Tosi detectors from the 1920s on.

The US Army Air Corps in 1931 tested a primitive radio compass that used commercial stations as the beacon.

===Huff-duff===
A major improvement in the RDF technique was introduced by Robert Watson-Watt as part of his experiments to locate lightning strikes as a method to indicate the direction of thunderstorms for sailors and airmen. He had long worked with conventional RDF systems, but these were difficult to use with the fleeting signals from the lightning. He had early on suggested the use of an oscilloscope to display these near instantly, but was unable to find one while working at the Met Office. When the office was moved, his new location at a radio research station provided him with both an Adcock antenna and a suitable oscilloscope, and he presented his new system in 1926.

In spite of the system being presented publicly, and its measurements widely reported in the UK, its impact on the art of RDF seems to be strangely subdued. Development was limited until the mid-1930s, when the various British forces began widespread development and deployment of these &quot;high-frequency direction finding&quot;, or &quot;huff-duff&quot; systems. To avoid RDF, the Germans had developed a method of broadcasting short messages under 30 seconds, less than the 60 seconds that a trained Bellini-Tosi operator would need to determine the direction. However, this was useless against huff-duff systems, which located the signal with reasonable accuracy in seconds. The Germans did not become aware of this problem until the middle of the war, and did not take any serious steps to address it until 1944. By that time huff-duff had helped in about one-quarter of all successful attacks on the U-boat fleet.

===Post-war systems===
Several developments in electronics during and after the Second World War led to greatly improved methods of comparing the phase of signals. In addition, the phase-locked loop (PLL) allowed for easy tuning in of signals, which would not drift. Improved vacuum tubes and the introduction of the transistor allowed much higher frequencies to be used economically, which led to widespread use of VHF and UHF signals. All of these changes led to new methods of RDF, and its much more widespread use.

In particular, the ability to compare the phase of signals led to phase-comparison RDF, which is perhaps the most widely used technique today. In this system the loop antenna is replaced with a single square-shaped ferrite core, with loops wound around two perpendicular sides. Signals from the loops are sent into a phase comparison circuit, whose output phase directly indicates the direction of the signal. By sending this to any manner of display, and locking the signal using PLL, the direction to the broadcaster can be continuously displayed. Operation consists solely of tuning in the station, and is so automatic that these systems are normally referred to as automatic direction finder.

Other systems have been developed where more accuracy is required. Pseudo-doppler radio direction finder systems use a series of small dipole antennas arranged in a ring and use electronic switching to rapidly select dipoles to feed into the receiver. The resulting signal is processed and produces an audio tone. The phase of that audio tone, compared to the antenna rotation, depends on the direction of the signal. Doppler RDF systems have widely replaced the huff-duff system for location of fleeting signals.

=== 21st century ===
The various procedures for radio direction finding to determine position at sea are no longer part of the maritime safety system GMDSS, which has been in force since 1999. The striking cross frame antenna with attached auxiliary antenna can only be found on the signal masts of some older ships because they do not interfere there and dismantling would be too expensive.

Modern positioning methods such as GPS, DGPS, radar and the now-outdated Loran C have radio direction finding methods that are imprecise for today&#x27;s needs.

Radio direction finding networks also no longer exist. However rescue vessels, such as RNLI lifeboats in the UK, and Search and Rescue helicopters have direction finding receivers for marine VHF signals and the 121.5 MHz homing signals incorporated in EPIRB and PLB beacons, although modern GPS-EPIRBS and AIS beacons are slowly making these redundant.

==Equipment==
A radio direction finder (RDF) is a device for finding the direction, or &quot;bearing&quot;, to a radio source. The act of measuring the direction is known as radio direction finding or sometimes simply direction finding (DF). Using two or more measurements from different locations, the location of an unknown transmitter can be determined; alternately, using two or more measurements of known transmitters, the location of a vehicle can be determined. RDF is widely used as a radio navigation system, especially with boats and aircraft.

RDF systems can be used with any radio source, although the size of the receiver antennas are a function of the wavelength of the signal; very long wavelengths (low frequencies) require very large antennas, and are generally used only on ground-based systems. These wavelengths are nevertheless very useful for marine navigation as they can travel very long distances and &quot;over the horizon&quot;, which is valuable for ships when the line-of-sight may be only a few tens of kilometres. For aircraft, where the horizon at altitude may extend to hundreds of kilometres, higher frequencies can be used, allowing much smaller antennas. An automatic direction finder, often capable of being tuned to commercial AM radio transmitters, is a feature of almost all modern aircraft.

For the military, RDF systems are a key component of signals intelligence systems and methodologies. The ability to locate the position of an enemy transmitter has been invaluable since World War I, and it played a key role in World War II&#x27;s Battle of the Atlantic. It is estimated that the UK&#x27;s advanced &quot;huff-duff&quot; systems were directly or indirectly responsible for 24% of all U-boats sunk during the war. Modern systems often use phased array antennas to allow rapid beam forming for highly accurate results. These are generally integrated into a wider electronic warfare suite.

Several distinct generations of RDF systems have been used over time, following new developments in electronics. Early systems used mechanically rotated antennas that compared signal strengths from different directions, and several electronic versions of the same concept followed. Modern systems use the comparison of phase or doppler techniques which are generally simpler to automate. Modern pseudo-Doppler direction finder systems consist of a number of small antennas fixed to a circular card, with all of the processing performed by software.

Early British radar sets were also referred to as RDF, which was a deception tactic. However, the terminology was not inaccurate; the Chain Home systems used separate omnidirectional broadcasters and large RDF receivers to determine the location of the targets.

===Antennas===
In one type of direction finding, a directional antenna is used which is more sensitive in certain directions than in others. Many antenna designs exhibit this property. For example, a Yagi antenna has quite pronounced directionality, so the source of a transmission can be determined by pointing it in the direction where the maximum signal level is obtained. Since the directional characteristics can be very broad, large antennas may be used to improve precision, or null techniques used to improve angular resolution.

====Null finding with loop antennas====

A simple form of directional antenna is the loop aerial. This consists of an open loop of wire on an insulating frame, or a metal ring that forms the antenna&#x27;s loop element itself; often the diameter of the loop is a tenth of a wavelength or smaller at the target frequency. Such an antenna will be &quot;least&quot; sensitive to signals that are perpendicular to its face and &quot;most&quot; responsive to those arriving edge-on. This is caused by the phase of the received signal: The difference in electrical phase along the rim of the loop at any instant causes a difference in the voltages induced on either side of the loop.

Turning the plane of the loop to &quot;face&quot; the signal so that the arriving phases are identical around the entire rim will not induce any current flow in the loop. So simply turning the antenna to produce a &quot;minimum&quot; in the desired signal will establish two possible directions (front and back) from which the radio waves could be arriving. This is called a &quot;null&quot; in the signal, and it is used instead of the strongest signal direction, because small angular deflections of the loop aerial away from its null positions produce much more abrupt changes in received current than similar directional changes around the loop&#x27;s strongest signal orientation. Since the null direction gives a clearer indication of the signal direction – the null is &quot;sharper&quot; than the max – with loop aerial the null direction is used to locate a signal source.

A &quot;sense antenna&quot; is used to resolve the two direction possibilities; the sense aerial is a non-directional antenna configured to have the same sensitivity as the loop aerial. By adding the steady signal from the sense aerial to the alternating signal from the loop signal as it rotates, there is now only one position as the loop rotates 360° at which there is zero current. This acts as a phase reference point, allowing the correct null point to be identified, removing the 180° ambiguity. A dipole antenna exhibits similar properties, as a small loop, although its null direction is not as &quot;sharp&quot;.

====Yagi antenna for higher frequencies====
The Yagi-Uda antenna is familiar as the common VHF or UHF television aerial. A Yagi antenna uses multiple dipole elements, which include &quot;reflector&quot; and &quot;director&quot; dipole elements. The &quot;reflector&quot; is the longest dipole element and blocks nearly all the signal coming from behind it, hence a Yagi has no front vs. back directional ambiguity: The maximum signal only occurs when the narrowest end of the Yagi is aimed in the direction from which the radio waves are arriving. With a sufficient number of shorter &quot;director&quot; elements, a Yagi&#x27;s maximum direction can be made to approach the sharpness of a small loop&#x27;s null. 

====Parabolic antennas for extremely high frequencies====
For much higher frequencies still, such as millimeter waves and microwaves, parabolic antennas or &quot;dish&quot; antennas can be used. Dish antennas are highly directional, with the parabolic shape directing received signals from a very narrow angle into a small receiving element mounted at the focus of the parabola.

====Electronic analysis of two antennas&#x27; signals====
More sophisticated techniques such as phased arrays are generally used for highly accurate direction finding systems. The modern systems are called goniometers by analogy to WW II directional circuits used to measure direction by comparing the differences in two or more matched reference antennas&#x27; received signals, used in old signals intelligence (SIGINT). A modern helicopter-mounted direction finding system was designed by ESL Incorporated for the U.S. Government as early as 1972.

Time difference of arrival techniques compare the arrival time of a radio wave at two or more different antennas and deduce the direction of arrival from this timing information. This method can use mechanically simple non-moving omnidirectional antenna elements fed into a multiple channel receiver system.

===Operation===
One form of radio direction finding works by comparing the signal strength of a directional antenna pointing in different directions. At first, this system was used by land and marine-based radio operators, using a simple rotatable loop antenna linked to a degree indicator. This system was later adopted for both ships and aircraft, and was widely used in the 1930s and 1940s. On pre-World War II aircraft, RDF antennas are easy to identify as the circular loops mounted above or below the fuselage. Later loop antenna designs were enclosed in an aerodynamic, teardrop-shaped fairing. In ships and small boats, RDF receivers first employed large metal loop antennas, similar to aircraft, but usually mounted atop a portable battery-powered receiver.

In use, the RDF operator would first tune the receiver to the correct frequency, then manually turn the loop, either listening or watching an S meter to determine the direction of the &quot;null&quot; (the direction at which a given signal is weakest) of a long wave (LW) or medium wave (AM) broadcast beacon or station (listening for the null is easier than listening for a peak signal, and normally produces a more accurate result). This null was symmetrical, and thus identified both the correct degree heading marked on the radio&#x27;s compass rose as well as its 180-degree opposite. While this information provided a baseline from the station to the ship or aircraft, the navigator still needed to know beforehand if he was to the east or west of the station in order to avoid plotting a course 180-degrees in the wrong direction. By taking bearings to two or more broadcast stations and plotting the intersecting bearings, the navigator could locate the relative position of his ship or aircraft.

Later, RDF sets were equipped with rotatable ferrite loopstick antennas, which made the sets more portable and less bulky. Some were later partially automated by means of a motorized antenna (ADF). A key breakthrough was the introduction of a secondary vertical whip or &#x27;sense&#x27; antenna that substantiated the correct bearing and allowed the navigator to avoid plotting a bearing 180 degrees opposite the actual heading. The U.S. Navy RDF model SE 995 which used a sense antenna was in use during World War I. After World War II, there were many small and large firms making direction finding equipment for mariners, including Apelco, Aqua Guide, Bendix, Gladding (and its marine division, Pearce-Simpson), Ray Jefferson, Raytheon, and Sperry. By the 1960s, many of these radios were actually made by Japanese electronics manufacturers, such as Panasonic, Fuji Onkyo, and Koden Electronics Co., Ltd. In aircraft equipment, Bendix and Sperry-Rand were two of the larger manufacturers of RDF radios and navigation instruments.

===Single-channel DF===
Single-channel DF uses a multi-antenna array with a single channel radio receiver. This approach to DF offers some advantages and drawbacks. Since it only uses one receiver, mobility and lower power consumption are benefits. Without the ability to look at each antenna simultaneously (which would be the case if one were to use multiple receivers, also known as N-channel DF) more complex operations need to occur at the antenna in order to present the signal to the receiver.

The two main categories that a single channel DF algorithm falls into are &quot;amplitude comparison&quot; and &quot;phase comparison&quot;. Some algorithms can be hybrids of the two.

====Pseudo-doppler DF technique====
The pseudo-doppler technique is a phase based DF method that produces a bearing estimate on the received signal by measuring the doppler shift induced on the signal by sampling around the elements of a circular array. The original method used a single antenna that physically moved in a circle but the modern approach uses a multi-antenna circular array with each antenna sampled in succession.

====Watson–Watt, or Adcock-antenna array====

The Watson-Watt technique uses two antenna pairs to perform an amplitude comparison on the incoming signal. The popular Watson-Watt method uses an array of two orthogonal coils (magnetic dipoles) in the horizontal plane, often completed with an omnidirectional vertically polarized electric dipole to resolve 180° ambiguities.

The Adcock antenna array uses a pair of monopole or dipole antennas that takes the vector difference of the received signal at each antenna so that there is only one output from each pair of antennas. Two of these pairs are co-located but perpendicularly oriented to produce what can be referred to as the N–S (North-South) and E–W (East-West) signals that will then be passed to the receiver. In the receiver, the bearing angle can then be computed by taking the arctangent of the ratio of the N–S to E–W signal.

====Correlative interferometer====
The basic principle of the correlative interferometer consists in comparing the measured phase differences with the phase differences obtained for a DF antenna system of known configuration at a known wave angle (reference data set). For this, at least three antenna elements (with omnidirectional reception characteristics) must form a non-collinear basis. The comparison is made for different azimuth and elevation values of the reference data set. The bearing result is obtained from a correlative and stochastic evaluation for which the correlation coefficient is at a maximum. If the direction finding antenna elements have a directional antenna pattern, then the amplitude may be included in the comparison. 
Typically, the correlative interferometer DF system consists of more than five antenna elements. These are scanned one after the other via a specific switching matrix. In a multi-channel DF system n antenna elements are combined with m receiver channels to improve the DF-system performance.

==Applications==
===Radio navigation===

&quot;Radio direction finding&quot;, &quot;radio direction finder&quot;, or &quot;RDF&quot;, was once the primary aviation navigational aid. (&quot;Range and Direction Finding&quot; was the abbreviation used to describe the predecessor to radar.) Beacons were used to mark &quot;airways&quot; intersections and to define departure and approach procedures. Since the signal transmitted contains no information about bearing or distance, these beacons are referred to as &quot;non-directional beacons&quot;, or &quot;NDB&quot; in the aviation world. Starting in the 1950s, these beacons were generally replaced by the VOR system, in which the bearing to the navigational aid is measured from the signal itself; therefore no specialized antenna with moving parts is required. Due to relatively low purchase, maintenance and calibration cost, NDBs are still used to mark locations of smaller aerodromes and important helicopter landing sites. 

Similar beacons located in coastal areas are also used for maritime radio navigation, as almost every ship was equipped with a direction finder (Appleyard 1988). Very few maritime radio navigation beacons remain active today (2008) as ships have abandoned navigation via RDF in favor of GPS navigation.

In the United Kingdom a radio direction finding service is available on 121.5 MHz and 243.0 MHz to aircraft pilots who are in distress or are experiencing difficulties. The service is based on a number of radio DF units located at civil and military airports and certain HM Coastguard stations. These stations can obtain a &quot;fix&quot; of the aircraft and transmit it by radio to the pilot.
====Maritime and aircraft navigation====
Radio transmitters for air and sea navigation are known as &quot;beacons&quot; and are the radio equivalent to a lighthouse. The transmitter sends a Morse Code transmission on a Long wave (150 – 400 kHz) or Medium wave (520 – 1720 kHz) frequency incorporating the station&#x27;s identifier that is used to confirm the station and its operational status. Since these radio signals are broadcast in all directions (omnidirectional) during the day, the signal itself does not include direction information, and these beacons are therefore referred to as non-directional beacons, or NDBs.

As the commercial medium wave broadcast band lies within the frequency capability of most RDF units, these stations and their transmitters can also be used for navigational fixes. While these commercial radio stations can be useful due to their high power and location near major cities, there may be several miles between the location of the station and its transmitter, which can reduce the accuracy of the &#x27;fix&#x27; when approaching the broadcast city. A second factor is that some AM radio stations are omnidirectional during the day, and switch to a reduced power, directional signal at night.

RDF was once the primary form of aircraft and marine navigation. Strings of beacons formed &quot;airways&quot; from airport to airport, while marine NDBs and commercial AM broadcast stations provided navigational assistance to small watercraft approaching a landfall. In the United States, commercial AM radio stations were required to broadcast their station identifier once per hour for use by pilots and mariners as an aid to navigation. In the 1950s, aviation NDBs were augmented by the VOR system, in which the direction to the beacon can be extracted from the signal itself, hence the distinction with non-directional beacons. Use of marine NDBs was largely supplanted in North America by the development of LORAN in the 1970s.

Today many NDBs have been decommissioned in favor of faster and far more accurate GPS navigational systems. However the low cost of ADF and RDF systems, and the continued existence of AM broadcast stations (as well as navigational beacons in countries outside North America) has allowed these devices to continue to function, primarily for use in small boats, as an adjunct or backup to GPS.

===Location of illegal, secret or hostile transmitters – SIGINT===

In World War II considerable effort was expended on identifying secret transmitters in the United Kingdom (UK) by direction finding. The work was undertaken by the Radio Security Service (RSS also MI8). Initially three U Adcock HF DF stations were set up in 1939 by the General Post Office. With the declaration of war, MI5 and RSS developed this into a larger network. One of the problems with providing coverage of an area the size of the UK was installing sufficient DF stations to cover the entire area to receive skywave signals reflected back from the ionised layers in the upper atmosphere. Even with the expanded network, some areas were not adequately covered and for this reason up to 1700 voluntary interceptors (radio amateurs) were recruited to detect illicit transmissions by ground wave. In addition to the fixed stations, RSS ran a fleet of mobile DF vehicles around the UK. If a transmitter was identified by the fixed DF stations or voluntary interceptors, the mobile units were sent to the area to home in on the source. The mobile units were HF Adcock systems.

By 1941 only a couple of illicit transmitters had been identified in the UK; these were German agents that had been &quot;turned&quot; and were transmitting under MI5 control. Many illicit transmissions had been logged emanating from German agents in occupied and neutral countries in Europe. The traffic became a valuable source of intelligence, so the control of RSS was subsequently passed to MI6 who were responsible for secret intelligence originating from outside the UK. The direction finding and interception operation increased in volume and importance until 1945.

The HF Adcock stations consisted of four 10m vertical antennas surrounding a small wooden operators hut containing a receiver and a radio-goniometer which was adjusted to obtain the bearing. MF stations were also used which used four guyed 30m lattice tower antennas. In 1941, RSS began experimenting with spaced loop direction finders, developed by the Marconi company and the UK National Physical Laboratories. These consisted of two parallel loops 1 to 2m square on the ends of a rotatable 3 to 8m beam. The angle of the beam was combined with results from a radiogoniometer to provide a bearing. The bearing obtained was considerably sharper than that obtained with the U Adcock system, but there were ambiguities which prevented the installation of 7 proposed S.L DF systems. The operator of an SL system was in a metal underground tank below the antennas. Seven underground tanks were installed, but only two SL systems were installed at Wymondham, Norfolk and Weaverthorp in Yorkshire. Problems were encountered resulting in the remaining five underground tanks being fitted with Adcock systems. The rotating SL antenna was turned by hand which meant successive measurements were a lot slower than turning the dial of a goniometer.

Another experimental spaced loop station was built near Aberdeen in 1942 for the Air Ministry with a semi-underground concrete bunker. This, too, was abandoned because of operating difficulties. By 1944, a mobile version of the spaced loop had been developed and was used by RSS in France following the D-Day invasion of Normandy.

The US military used a shore based version of the spaced loop DF in World War II called &quot;DAB&quot;. The loops were placed at the ends of a beam, all of which was located inside a wooden hut with the electronics in a large cabinet with cathode-ray-tube display at the centre of the beam and everything being supported on a central axis. The beam was rotated manually by the operator.

The Royal Navy introduced a variation on the shore based HF DF stations in 1944 to track U-boats in the North Atlantic. They built groups of five DF stations, so that bearings from individual stations in the group could be combined and a mean taken. Four such groups were built in Britain at Ford End, Essex, Goonhavern, Cornwall, Anstruther and Bowermadden in the Scottish Highlands. Groups were also built in Iceland, Nova Scotia and Jamaica. The anticipated improvements were not realised but later statistical work improved the system and the Goonhavern and Ford End groups continued to be used during the Cold War. The Royal Navy also deployed direction finding equipment on ships tasked to anti-submarine warfare in order to try to locate German submarines, e.g. Captain class frigates were fitted with a medium frequency direction finding antenna (MF/DF) (the antenna was fitted in front of the bridge) and high frequency direction finding (HF/DF, &quot;Huffduff&quot;) Type FH 4 antenna (the antenna was fitted on top of the mainmast).

A comprehensive reference on World War II wireless direction finding was written by Roland Keen, who was head of the engineering department of RSS at Hanslope Park. The DF systems mentioned here are described in detail in his 1947 book &quot;Wireless Direction Finding&quot;.

At the end of World War II a number of RSS DF stations continued to operate into the Cold War under the control of GCHQ the British SIGINT organisation.

Most direction finding effort within the UK now (2009) is directed towards locating unauthorised &quot;pirate&quot; FM broadcast radio transmissions. A network of remotely operated VHF direction finders are used mainly located around the major cities. The transmissions from mobile telephone handsets are also located by a form of direction finding using the comparative signal strength at the surrounding local &quot;cell&quot; receivers. This technique is often offered as evidence in UK criminal prosecutions and, almost certainly, for SIGINT purposes.

===Emergency aid===

Emergency position-indicating rescue beacons are widely deployed on civil aircraft and ships. Historically emergency location transmitters only sent a tone signal and relied on direction finding by search aircraft to locate the beacon. Modern emergency beacons transmit a unique identification signal that can include GPS location data that can aid in finding the exact location of the transmitter.

Avalanche transceivers operate on a standard 457 kHz, and are designed to help locate people and equipment buried by avalanches. Since the power of the beacon is so low the directionality of the radio signal is dominated by small scale field effects and can be quite complicated to locate.

===Wildlife tracking===
Location of radio-tagged animals by triangulation is a widely applied research technique for studying the movement of animals. The technique was first used in the early 1960s, when radio transmitters and batteries became small enough to attach to wildlife, and is now widely deployed for a variety of wildlife studies. Most tracking of wild animals that have been affixed with radio transmitter equipment is done by a field researcher using a handheld radio direction finding device. When the researcher wants to locate a particular animal, the location of the animal can be triangulated by determining the direction to the transmitter from several locations.

===Reconnaissance===
Phased arrays and other advanced antenna techniques are utilized to track launches of rocket systems and their resulting trajectories. These systems can be used for defensive purposes and also to gain intelligence on operation of missiles belonging to other nations. These same techniques are used for detection and tracking of conventional aircraft.

==Astronomy==

Earth-based receivers can detect radio signals emanating from distant stars or regions of ionized gas. Receivers in radio telescopes can detect the general direction of such naturally-occurring radio sources, sometimes correlating their location with objects visible with optical telescopes. Accurate measurement of the arrival time of radio impulses by two radio telescopes at different places on Earth, or the same telescope at different times in Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun, may also allow estimation of the distance to a radio object.

===Sport===

Events hosted by groups and organizations that involve the use of radio direction finding skills to locate transmitters at unknown locations have been popular since the end of World War II. Many of these events were first promoted in order to practice the use of radio direction finding techniques for disaster response and civil defense purposes, or to practice locating the source of radio frequency interference. The most popular form of the sport, worldwide, is known as Amateur Radio Direction Finding or by its international abbreviation ARDF. Another form of the activity, known as &quot;transmitter hunting&quot;, &quot;mobile T-hunting&quot; or &quot;fox hunting&quot; takes place in a larger geographic area, such as the metropolitan area of a large city, and most participants travel in motor vehicles while attempting to locate one or more radio transmitters with radio direction-finding techniques.

== Direction finding at microwave frequencies ==
DF techniques for microwave frequencies were developed in the 1940s, in response to the growing numbers of transmitters operating at these higher frequencies. This required the design of new antennas and receivers for the DF systems.

In Naval systems, the DF capability became part of the Electronic Support Measures suite (ESM), where the directional information obtained augments other signal identification processes. In aircraft, a DF system provides additional information for the Radar Warning Receiver (RWR).

Over time, it became necessary to improve the performance of microwave DF systems in order to counter the evasive tactics being employed by some operators, such as low-probability-of-intercept radars and covert Data links.

=== Brief history of microwave development ===
Earlier in the century, vacuum tubes (thermionic valves) were used extensively in transmitters and receivers, but their high frequency performance was limited by transit time effects. Even with special processes to reduce lead lengths, such as frame grid construction, as used in the EF50, and planar construction, very few tubes could operate above UHF.

Intensive research work was carried out in the 1930s in order to develop transmitting tubes specifically for the microwave band which included, in particular, the klystron the cavity magnetron and the travelling wave tube (TWT). Following the successful development of these tubes, large scale production occurred in the following decade.

=== The advantages of microwave operation ===
Microwave signals have short wavelengths, which results in greatly improved target resolution when compared to RF systems. This permits better identification of multiple targets and, also, gives improved directional accuracy. Also, the antennas are small so they can be assembled into compact arrays and, in addition, they can achieve well defined beam patterns which can provide the narrow beams with high gain favoured by radars and Data links.

Other advantages of the newly available microwave band were the absence of fading (often a problem in the Shortwave radio (SW) band) and great increase in signal spectrum, compared to the congested RF bands already in use. In addition to being able to accommodate many more signals, the ability to use Spread spectrum and frequency hopping techniques now became possible.

Once microwave techniques had become established, there was rapid expansion into the band by both military and commercial users.

=== Antennas for DF ===
Antennas for DF have to meet different requirements from those for a radar or communication link, where an antenna with a narrow beam and high gain is usually an advantage. However, when carrying out direction finding, the bearing of the source may be unknown, so antennas with wide beamwidths are usually chosen, even though they have lower antenna boresight gain. In addition, the antennas are required to cover a wide band of frequencies.

The figure shows the normalized polar plot of a typical antenna gain characteristic, in the horizontal plane. The half-power beamwidth of the main beam is 2 × Ψ0. Preferably, when using amplitude comparison methods for direction finding, the main lobe should approximate to a Gaussian characteristic. Although the figure also shows the presence of sidelobes, these are not a major concern when antennas are used in a DF array.

Typically, the boresight gain of an antenna is related to the beam width. For a rectangular horn, Gain ≈ 30000/BWh.BWv, where BWh and BWv are the horizontal and vertical antenna beamwidths, respectively, in degrees. For a circular aperture, with beamwidth BWc, it is Gain ≈ 30000/BWc2.

Two antenna types, popular for DF, are cavity-backed spirals and horn antennas.

Spiral antennas are capable of very wide bandwidths and have a nominal half-power beamwidth of about 70deg, making them very suitable for antenna arrays containing 4, 5 or 6 antennas.

For larger arrays, needing narrower beamwidths, horns may be used. The bandwidths of horn antennas may be increased by using double-ridged waveguide feeds and by using horns with internal ridges.

=== Microwave receivers ===
==== Early receivers ====
Early microwave receivers were usually simple &quot;crystal-video&quot; receivers, which use a crystal detector followed by a video amplifier with a compressive characteristic to extend the dynamic range. Such a receiver was wideband but not very sensitive. However, this lack of sensitivity could be tolerated because of the &quot;range advantage&quot; enjoyed by the DF receiver (see below).

==== Klystron and TWT preamplifiers ====
The klystron and TWT are linear devices and so, in principle, could be used as receiver preamplifiers. However, the klystron was quite unsuitable as it was a narrow-band device and extremely noisy and the TWT, although potentially more suitable, has poor matching characteristics and large bulk, which made it unsuitable for multi-channel systems using a preamplifier per antenna. However, a system has been demonstrated, in which a single TWT preamplifier selectively selects signals from an antenna array.

==== Transistor preamplifiers ====
Transistors suitable for microwave frequencies became available towards the end of the 1950s. The first of these was the metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET). Others followed, for example, the metal-semiconductor field-effect transistor and the high electron mobility transistor (HEMT). Initially, discrete transistors were embedded in stripline or microstrip circuits, but microwave integrated circuits followed. With these new devices, low-noise receiver preamplifiers became possible, which greatly increased the sensitivity, and hence the detection range, of DF systems.

==== Range advantage ====
&quot;Source:&quot;

The DF receiver enjoys a detection range advantage over that of the radar receiver. This is because the signal strength at the DF receiver, due to a radar transmission, is proportional to 1/R2 whereas that at the radar receiver from the reflected return is proportional to σ/R4, where R is the range and σ is the radar cross-section of the DF system. This results in the signal strength at the radar receiver being very much smaller than that at the DF receiver. Consequently, in spite of its poor sensitivity, a simple crystal-video DF receiver is, usually, able to detect the signal transmission from a radar at a greater range than that at which the Radar&#x27;s own receiver is able to detect the presence of the DF system.

In practice, the advantage is reduced by the ratio of antenna gains (typically they are 36 dB and 10 dB for the Radar and ESM, respectively) and the use of Spread spectrum techniques, such as Chirp compression, by the Radar, to increase the processing gain of its receiver. On the other hand, the DF system can regain some advantage by using sensitive, low-noise, receivers and by using Stealth practices to reduce its radar cross-section, as with Stealth aircraft and Stealth ships.

=== The new demands on DF systems ===
The move to microwave frequencies meant a reappraisal of the requirements of a DF system. Now, the receiver could no longer rely on a continuous signal stream on which to carry out measurements. Radars with their narrow beams would only illuminate the antennas of the DF system infrequently. Furthermore, some radars wishing to avoid detection (those of smugglers, hostile ships and missiles) would radiate their signals infrequently and often at low power. Such a system is referred to as a low-probability-of-intercept radar. In other applications, such as microwave links, the transmitter&#x27;s antenna may never point at the DF receiver at all, so reception is only possible by means of the signal leakage from antenna side lobes. In addition, covert Data links may only radiate a high data rate sequence very occasionally.

In general, in order to cater for modern circumstances, a broadband microwave DF system is required to have high sensitivity and have 360° coverage in order to have the ability to detect single pulses (often called amplitude monopulse) and achieve a high &quot;Probability of Intercept&quot; (PoI).

== DF by amplitude comparison ==
Amplitude comparison has been popular as a method for DF because systems are relatively simple to implement, have good sensitivity and, very importantly, a high probability of signal detection. Typically, an array of four, or more, squinted directional antennas is used to give 360 degree coverage. DF by phase comparison methods can give better bearing accuracy, but the processing is more complex. Systems using a single rotating dish antenna are more sensitive, small and relatively easy to implement, but have poor PoI.

Usually, the signal amplitudes in two adjacent channels of the array are compared, to obtain the bearing of an incoming wavefront but, sometimes, three adjacent channels are used to give improved accuracy. Although the gains of the antennas and their amplifying chains have to be closely matched, careful design and construction and effective calibration procedures can compensate for shortfalls in the hardware. Overall bearing accuracies of 2° to 10° (rms) have been reported using the method.

=== Two-channel DF ===


Two-channel DF, using two adjacent antennas of a circular array, is achieved by comparing the signal power of the largest signal with that of the second largest signal. The direction of an incoming signal, within the arc described by two antennas with a squint angle of Φ, may be obtained by comparing the relative powers of the signals received. When the signal is on the boresight of one of the antennas, the signal at the other antenna will be about 12 dB lower. When the signal direction is halfway between the two antennas, signal levels will be equal and approximately 3 dB lower than the boresight value. At other bearing angles, φ, some intermediate ratio of the signal levels will give the direction.

If the antenna main lobe patterns have a Gaussian characteristic, and the signal powers are described in logarithmic terms (e.g. decibels (dB) relative to the boresight value), then there is a linear relationship between the bearing angle φ and the power level difference, i.e. φ ∝ (P1(dB) - P2(dB)), where P1(dB) and P2(dB) are the outputs of two adjacent channels. The thumbnail shows a typical plot.

To give 360° coverage, antennas of a circular array are chosen, in pairs, according to the signal levels received at each antenna. If there are N antennas in the array, at angular spacing (squint angle) Φ, then Φ = 2π/N radians (= 360/N degrees).

==== Basic equations for two-port DF ====
If the main lobes of the antennas have a Gausian characteristic, then the output P1(φ), as a function of bearing angle φ, is given by

:formula_1

where

: G0 is the antenna boresight gain (i.e. when ø = 0),
: Ψ0 is one half the half-power beamwidth
: A = -\ln(0.5), so that P1(ø)/P10 = 0.5 when ø = Ψ0
: and angles are in radians.
The second antenna, squinted at Phi and with the same boresight gain G0 gives an output

:formula_2

Comparing signal levels,

:formula_3

The natural logarithm of the ratio is

:formula_4

Rearranging
:formula_5

This shows the linear relationship between the output level difference, expressed logarithmically, and the bearing angle ø.

Natural logarithms can be converted to decibels (dBs) (where dBs are referred to boresight gain) by using ln(X) = X(dB)/(10.\log10(e)), so the equation can be written

:formula_6

=== Three-channel DF ===

Improvements in bearing accuracy may be achieved if amplitude data from a third antenna are included in the bearing processing.

For three-channel DF, with three antennas squinted at angles Φ, the direction of the incoming signal is obtained by comparing the signal power of the channel containing the largest signal with the signal powers of the two adjacent channels, situated at each side of it.

For the antennas in a circular array, three antennas are selected according to the signal levels received, with the largest signal present at the central channel.

When the signal is on the boresight of Antenna 1 (φ = 0), the signal from the other two antennas will equal and about 12 dB lower. When the signal direction is halfway between two antennas (φ = 30°), their signal levels will be equal and approximately 3 dB lower than the boresight value, with the third signal now about 24 dB lower. At other bearing angles, ø, some intermediate ratios of the signal levels will give the direction.

==== Basic equations for three-port DF ====
For a signal incoming at a bearing ø, taken here to be to the right of boresight of Antenna 1:

Channel 1 output is 
:formula_7

Channel 2 output is 
:formula_8

Channel 3 output is 
:formula_9

where GT is the overall gain of each channel, including antenna boresight gain, and is assumed to be the same in all three channels. As before, in these equations, angles are in radians, Φ = 360/N degrees = 2 π/N radians and A = -ln(0.5).

As earlier, these can be expanded and combined to give:

:formula_10

:formula_11

Eliminating A/Ψ02 and rearranging

:formula_12

where Δ1,3 = \ln(P1) - ln(P3), Δ1,2 = \ln(P1) - \ln(P2) and Δ2,3 = \ln(P2) - \ln(P3),

The difference values here are in nepers but could be in decibels.

The bearing value, obtained using this equation, is independent of the antenna beamwidth (= 2.Ψ0), so this value does not have to be known for accurate bearing results to be obtained. Also, there is a smoothing affect, for bearing values near to the boresight of the middle antenna, so there is no discontinuity in bearing values there, as an incoming signals moves from left to right (or vice versa) through boresight, as can occur with 2-channel processing.

=== Bearing uncertainty due to noise ===
Many of the causes of bearing error, such as mechanical imperfections in the antenna structure, poor gain matching of receiver gains, or non-ideal antenna gain patterns may be compensated by calibration procedures and corrective look-up tables, but thermal noise will always be a degrading factor. As all systems generate thermal noise then, when the level of the incoming signal is low, the signal-to-noise ratios in the receiver channels will be poor, and the accuracy of the bearing prediction will suffer.

In general, a guide to bearing uncertainty is given by &gt; 

:formula_13 degrees

for a signal at crossover, but where SNR0 is the signal-to-noise ratio that would apply at boresight. 
To obtain more precise predictions at a given bearing, the actual S:N ratios of the signals of interest are used. (The results may be derived assuming that noise induced errors are approximated by relating differentials to uncorrelated noise).

For adjacent processing using, say, Channel 1 and Channel 2, the bearing uncertainty (angle noise), Δø (rms), is given below. In these results, square-law detection is assumed and the SNR figures are for signals at video (baseband), for the bearing angle φ.

:formula_14 rads

where SNR1 and SNR2 are the video (base-band) signal-to-noise values for the channels for Antenna 1 and Antenna 2, when square-law detection is used.

In the case of 3-channel processing, an expression which is applicable when the S:N ratios in all three channels exceeds unity (when ln(1 + 1/SNR) ≈ 1/SNR is true in all three channels), is

:formula_15

where SNR1, SNR2 and SNR3 are the video signal-to-noise values for Channel 1, Channel 2, and Channel 3 respectively, for the bearing angle φ.

=== A typical DF system with six antennas ===
A schematic of a possible DF system, employing six antennas, is shown in the figure.

The signals received by the antennas are first amplified by a low-noise preamplifier before detection by detector-log-video-amplifiers (DLVAs). The signal levels from the DLVAs are compared to determine the angle of arrival. By considering the signal levels on a logarithmic scale, as provided by the DLVAs, a large dynamic range is achieved and, in addition, the direction finding calculations are simplified when the main lobes of antenna patterns have a Gaussian characteristic, as shown earlier.

A necessary part of the DF analysis is to identify the channel which contains the largest signal and this is achieved by means of a fast comparator circuit. In addition to the DF process, other properties of the signal may be investigated, such as pulse duration, frequency, pulse repetition frequency (PRF) and modulation characteristics. The comparator operation usually includes hysteresis, to avoid jitter in the selection process when the bearing of the incoming signal is such that two adjacent channels contain signals of similar amplitude.

Often, the wideband amplifiers are protected from local high power sources (as on a ship) by input limiters and/or filters. Similarly the amplifiers might contain notch filters to remove known, but unwanted, signals which could impairs the system&#x27;s ability to process weaker signals. Some of these issues are covered in RF chain.

<text>Josef Gingold (; January 11, 1995) was a Russian and American classical violinist and teacher who lived most of his life in the United States. At the time of his death he was considered one of the most influential violin masters in the United States, with many successful students.

==Biography==

Gingold was born to a Jewish family in Brest-Litovsk, Grodno Governorate, Russian Empire (now Brest, Belarus), and emigrated in 1920 to the United States where he studied violin with Vladimir Graffman in New York City. He then moved to Belgium for several years to study with master violinist Eugène Ysaÿe. He gave the first performance of Ysaÿe&#x27;s 3rd Sonata for Solo Violin. 

In 1937, Gingold won a spot in the NBC Symphony Orchestra, with Arturo Toscanini as its conductor. While at NBC, Gingold was a founding member of its associated chamber ensembles, the Primrose Quartet (with first violinist Oscar Shumsky, violist William Primrose, and cellist Harvey Shapiro) and the NBC Trio (with Shapiro and pianist Earl Wild). Gingold later served as the concertmaster (and occasional soloist) of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, and later was the Cleveland Orchestra&#x27;s concertmaster under conductor George Szell.

Gingold edited numerous violin technique books and orchestral excerpt collections. He taught at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music for more than thirty years, until his death in 1995. His pupils included Gil Shaham, Joshua Bell, Christoph Poppen, Sally O&#x27;Reilly, Desirée Ruhstrat, Arnold Steinhardt, Dylana Jenson, Martin Beaver, Shony Alex Braun, Andrés Cárdenes, Corey Cerovsek, Cyrus Forough, Miriam Fried, Philippe Graffin, Endre Granat, Ulf Hoelscher, Hu Nai-yuan, Jacques Israelievitch, Leonidas Kavakos, Chin Kim, Salvatore Greco, Malcolm Lowe, Jaime Laredo, William Preucil, Joseph Silverstein, Lucie Robert, and Gwen Thompson.

Gingold was a founder of the quadrennial Indianapolis Violin Competition. He was a National Patron of Delta Omicron, an international professional music fraternity.

A detailed literary portrait of Josef Gingold is included in the book, &quot;Quintet, Five Journeys toward Musical Fulfillment,&quot; by David Blum (Cornell University Press, 1999). It originally appeared as an article in the February 4, 1991, issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

Gingold died in Bloomington, Indiana, in 1995, aged 85.

==Honors and awards==

Gingold&#x27;s recording of Fritz Kreisler&#x27;s works was nominated for a Grammy Award. Some of the numerous honors he received during his lifetime include the American String Teachers Association Teacher of the Year; the Fredrick Bachman Lieber Award for Distinguished Teaching at Indiana University; the Chamber Music America National Service Award; Baylor University&#x27;s Robert Foster Cherry Award for Great Teachers; and the American Symphony Orchestra League&#x27;s Golden Baton Award.

<doc id="820752" wikidata="Q925475" url="?curid=820752" title="Who Can You Trust? (album)">
<text>Who Can You Trust? is the debut studio album by English electronic music group Morcheeba. It was released in 1996 on China Records in the United Kingdom and Discovery and Sire Records in the United States. Stylistically, the album is by far the band&#x27;s most trip hop oriented release, consisting of languid, looping grooves, using mostly Rhodes piano, electric guitar and scratching. At the end of 1998 the album was re-issued as 2-CDs with the 8 track disc &quot;Beats &amp; B-Sides&quot; collection.

==Reception==

&quot;Melody Maker&quot; recommended &quot;Who Can You Trust?&quot; and remarked that Morcheeba &quot;take up where trip hop leaves off, picking up at its outer reaches and taking it way, way off into the Indian Ocean... A strange and bitter brew indeed.&quot; &quot;Musician&quot; wrote that the band is &quot;saved from Portishead comparisons mainly by their fondness for guitars&quot; and that their &quot;laid-back beats and gentle, smoky tunes are enhanced by Ry Cooder-ish slide, funky wah-wah, and other simple guitar flourishes, as well as a reappearing Hammond organ and some occasional strings.&quot; Josef Woodard of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; compared vocalist Skye Edwards to &quot;Sade filtered through Portishead&quot; and felt that she has &quot;enough hypnotic charms and charisma to counter the dangers of techno-riff overkill.&quot; Robert Christgau, in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, praised the band as &quot;always thoughtful, often sad, rarely neurotic, never scary.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
By 1998, &quot;Who Can You Trust?&quot; had sold around 500,000 copies worldwide, and by 2003 it had passed the one million mark in worldwide sales. By 2000, combined sales of &quot;Who Can You Trust?&quot; and the group&#x27;s second album &quot;Big Calm&quot; stood at 315,000 copies in the United States.

<doc id="820757" wikidata="Q333140" url="?curid=820757" title="Duleep Singh">
<text>Maharaja Sir Duleep Singh (6 September 1838 – 22 October 1893), also spelled Dalip Singh, and later in life nicknamed the &quot;Black Prince of Perthshire&quot;, was the last &quot;Maharaja&quot; of the Sikh Empire. He was Maharaja Ranjit Singh&#x27;s youngest son, the only child of Maharani Jind Kaur.

He was placed in power in September 1843, at the age of five, with his mother ruling on his behalf, and after their defeat in the Anglo-Sikh War, under a British Resident. He was subsequently deposed by the British Crown, and thereafter exiled to Britain at age 15 where he was befriended by Queen Victoria, who is reported to have written of the Punjabi Maharaja: &quot;Those eyes and those teeth are too beautiful&quot;. The Queen was godmother to several of his children. He died at 55, living most of his final years in the United Kingdom.

His mother had effectively ruled when he was very young and he managed to meet her again on 16 January 1861, in Calcutta and return with her to the United Kingdom. During the last two years of her life, his mother told the Maharaja about his Sikh heritage and the Empire which once had been his to rule. In June 1861, he was one of the first 25 Knights in the Order of the Star of India.

==Early years==
After the death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1839, Duleep Singh lived quietly with his mother, Jind Kaur Aulakh, at Jammu ruled by Gulab Singh, under the protection of the Vizier, Raja Dhian Singh. He and his mother were recalled to Lahore in 1843 after the assassinations of Maharaja Sher Singh and Dhian Singh, and on 16 September, at the age of five, Duleep Singh was proclaimed Maharaja of the Sikh Empire, with Maharani Jind Kaur as Regent.

On 13 December 1845 the British East India Company declared war on the Sikhs and, after winning the First Anglo-Sikh War, retained the Maharaja as nominal ruler, but replaced the Maharani with a Council of Regency and later imprisoned and exiled her. Over thirteen years passed before Duleep Singh was permitted to see his mother again.

After the end of the Second Anglo-Sikh War and the subsequent annexation of the Punjab on 29 March 1849, he was deposed at the age of ten and was put into the care of Dr John Login and sent from Lahore to Fatehgarh on 21 December 1849, with tight restrictions on who he was allowed to meet. No Indians, except trusted servants, could meet him in private. As a matter of British policy, he was to be culturally anglicised in every possible aspect. His health was reportedly poor and he was often sent to the hill station of Landour near Mussoorie in the Lower Himalaya for convalescence, at the time about 4 days&#x27; journey. He would remain for weeks at a time in Landour at a grand hilltop building called &quot;The Castle&quot;, which had been lavishly furnished to accommodate him.

===Conversion to Christianity===
In 1853, under the tutelage of his long-time retainer Bhajan Lal (himself a Christian convert), he converted to Christianity at Fatehgarh Sahib with the approval of the Governor-General Lord Dalhousie. His conversion remains controversial, and it occurred before he turned 15. He later had serious doubts and regrets regarding this decision and reconverted to Sikhism in 1886.

He was also heavily and continuously exposed to Christian texts under the tutelage of the devout Sir John Spencer Login. His two closest childhood friends were both English Anglican missionaries. In May 1854 he was sent into exile in Britain.

==Life in exile==

===London===
Duleep Singh arrived in England in late 1854 and was introduced to the British court. Queen Victoria showered affection upon the turbaned Maharaja, as did the Prince Consort. Duleep Singh was initially lodged at Claridge&#x27;s Hotel in London before the East India Company took over a house in Wimbledon and then eventually another house in Roehampton which became his home for three years. He was also invited by the Queen to stay with the Royal Family at Osborne, where she sketched him playing with her children and Prince Albert photographed him, while the court artist, Winterhalter, made his portrait.

He eventually got bored with Roehampton and expressed a wish to go back to India but it was suggested by the East India Company Board he take a tour of the European continent, which he did with Sir John Spencer Login and Lady Login. He was a member of the Photographic Society, later the Royal Photographic Society, from 1855 until his death.

===Castle Menzies===

On his return from Continental Europe in 1855 he was given an annual pension of £25,000 a year (approximately £ in today&#x27;s value) provided he &quot;remain obedient to the British Government,&quot; and was officially under ward of Sir John Spencer Login and Lady Login, who leased Castle Menzies in Perthshire, Scotland, for him. He spent the rest of his teens there, but at 19 he demanded to be in charge of his household. Eventually, he was given this and an increase in his annual pension.

In 1859 Lt Col James Oliphant was installed as Equerry to the Maharaja at the recommendation of Sir John Login. Oliphant was to be a possible replacement should anything happen to the Maharaja&#x27;s most trusted friend Sir John Login (who did indeed die four years later in 1863).

In the 1860s, Singh moved from Castle Menzies to Grandtully Castle.

===Mulgrave Castle===

From 1858 to 1862 Duleep Singh rented Mulgrave Castle, near Whitby.
===Sir Samuel White Baker===
While Sir Samuel White Baker was visiting the Duke of Atholl on his shooting estate in Scotland, he befriended Maharaja Duleep Singh. In 1858–1859, the two partnered an extensive hunting trip in central Europe and the Balkans, via Frankfurt, Berlin, Vienna and Budapest. On the last part of the voyage, Baker and the Maharajah hired a wooden boat in Budapest, which was eventually abandoned on the frozen Danube. The two continued into Vidin where, to amuse the Maharajah, Baker went to the Vidin slave market. There, Baker fell in love with a white slave girl, destined for the Ottoman Pasha of Vidin. Baker was outbid by the Pasha but bribed the girl&#x27;s attendants. The two ran away in a carriage together and eventually, as Florence Baker, she became Baker&#x27;s lover and wife and accompanied him everywhere he journeyed.

===Reunion with his mother===
When he was 18, Singh wrote to his mother in Kathmandu, suggesting that she should join him in Great Britain, but his letter was intercepted by the British authorities in India and did not reach her. He then sent a courier, Pundit Nehemiah Goreh, who was also intercepted and forbidden to contact the Maharani. Duleep Singh then decided to go himself. Under cover of a letter from Login he wrote to the British Resident in Kathmandu, who reported that the Maharani had &#x27;much changed, was blind and had lost much of the energy which formerly characterised her.&#x27; The British government decided she was no longer a threat and she was allowed to join her son on 16 January 1861 at Spence&#x27;s Hotel in Calcutta and return with him to England.

===Auchlyne and Aberfeldy===
In 1858 the lease of Castle Menzies expired and Duleep Singh rented the house at Auchlyne from the Earl of Breadalbane. He was known for a lavish lifestyle, shooting parties, and a love of dressing in Highland costume and soon had the nickname &quot;the Black Prince of Perthshire&quot;. (At the same time, he was known to have gradually developed a sense of regret for his circumstances in exile, including some inner turmoil about his conversion to Christianity and his forced departure from the Panjab). His mother stayed in Perthshire with him for a short time, before he rented the Grandtully Estate, near Aberfeldy. Following the death of his mother and Sir John Login in 1863, he returned to England.

===Elveden Estate===

Maharaja Duleep Singh (as he became in June 1861) bought (or the India Office purchased for him) a country estate at Elveden on the border between Norfolk and Suffolk, close to Thetford, in 1863. He enjoyed living in Elveden Hall and the surrounding area and restored the church, cottages, and school. He transformed the run-down estate into an efficient game preserve and it was here that he gained his reputation as the fourth best shot in England.

The house was remodelled into a quasi-oriental palace where he lived the life of a British aristocrat. Maharaja Duleep Singh was accused of running up large expenses and the estate was sold after his death to pay his debts. Today, Elveden is owned by The 4th Earl of Iveagh, the head of the Anglo-Irish Guinness family of brewing fame; it remains an operating farm and private hunting estate.

==Re-initiated into Sikhism==

In 1864, Duleep Singh married Bamba Müller in Cairo and established his family home at Elveden Hall in Suffolk. He eventually became disaffected and embittered with the British, and he reverted to Sikhism.

While in exile, he sought to learn more about Sikhism and was eager to return to India. Though previous efforts were thwarted by his handlers, he re-established contact with his cousin Sardar Thakar Singh Sandhawalia, who on 28 September 1884 left Amritsar for England along with his sons Narinder Singh and Gurdit Singh and a Sikh &quot;granthi&quot; (priest), Pratap Singh Giani. He also brought a list of properties held by Sir Duleep Singh in India. All this renewed his connection with Sikhism.

The British Government decided in 1886 against his return to India or his re-embracing Sikhism. Despite protests from the India Office, he set sail for &#x27;home&#x27; on 30 March 1886. However, he was intercepted and arrested in Aden, then part of Aden Settlement, where the writ of the Viceroy of India began. He could not be stopped from an informal re-conversion ceremony in Aden, far less grand and symbolic than it would have been in India, done by emissaries sent by Sardar Thakar Singh Sandhawalia, who was earlier planning the &quot;Pahaul&quot; ceremony at Bombay. Sir Duleep was forced to return to Europe.

==Death==
Maharaja Duleep Singh died in Paris in 1893 at the age of 55, having seen India after the age of fifteen during only two brief, tightly controlled visits in 1860 (to bring his mother to England) and in 1863 (to cremate his mother&#x27;s body).

Maharaja Duleep Singh&#x27;s wish for his body to be returned to India was not honoured, in fear of unrest, given the symbolic value the funeral of the son of the Lion of the Punjab might have caused and the growing resentment of British rule. His body was brought back to be buried according to Christian rites, under the supervision of the India Office, in Elveden Church beside the grave of his wife Maharani Bamba, and his son Prince Edward Albert Duleep Singh. The graves are located on the west side of the Church.
A life-size bronze statue of the Maharaja, showing him on a horse, was unveiled by the then Prince of Wales in 1999 at Butten Island in Thetford, a town which benefited from his and his sons&#x27; generosity.

In an auction at Bonhams, London, on 19 April 2007, the 74 cm high white marble portrait bust of Maharaja Duleep Singh by Victorian sculptor John Gibson, R.A., in Rome in 1859 fetched £1.7 million (£1.5 million plus premium and tax).

A film titled &quot;Maharaja Duleep Singh: A Monument Of Injustice&quot;, was made in 2007, directed by P.S. Narula.

==Heraldry==

The Maharaja and his family used a coat of arms which was drawn up by Prince Albert, despite not being registered at the College of Arms. It contained a coronet, lions, and a shield with a cross, along with the motto &quot;Prodesse quam conspicii&quot; (&quot;to do good rather than be conspicuous&quot;).


==Family==
Sir Duleep Singh married twice, first to Bamba Müller in 1864, and then to Ada Douglas Wetherill (1869-1930) in 1889. He had eight children in total.

He had seven children from his marriage to Bamba. Their first child and male heir died aged one day in 1865. The others were:
* Prince Victor Albert Jay Duleep Singh (10 Jan 1866–7 Jun 1918)
* Prince Frederick Victor Duleep Singh (23 Jan 1868–15 Aug 1926)
* Princess Bamba Sofia Jindan Duleep Singh (29 Sep 1869–10 Mar 1957)
* Princess Catherine Hilda Duleep Singh (27 Oct 1871–8 Nov 1942)
* Princess Sophia Alexandra Duleep Singh (8 Aug 1876–22 Aug 1948)
* Prince Albert Edward Alexander Duleep Singh (1879–1 May 1893)

He also had two children from his marriage to Wetherill:
* Princess Pauline Alexandra Duleep Singh (26 Dec 1887–10 Apr 1941)
* Princess Ada Irene Beryl Duleep Singh (25 Oct 1889–14 Sep 1926)

All the eight children died without legitimate issue, ending the direct line of the Sikh Royalty.

There is a memorial at Eton College in England to Princes Victor and Frederick, Maharaja Sir Duleep Singh&#x27;s two sons who studied at Eton in the 1870s.

===Maharani Bamba Müller===
Maharani Bamba Müller was an Arabic-speaking, part-Ethiopian, part-German woman, whose father was a German banker and whose mother was an Abyssinian Coptic Christian slave. She and Sir Duleep met in Cairo in 1863 on his return from scattering his mother&#x27;s ashes in India; they were married in Alexandria, Egypt, on 7 June 1864. The Maharani died in London on 18 September 1887.

===Ada Douglas Wetherill===

Ada Douglas Wetherill (born 15 January 1869 in Kennington, Surrey, the daughter of a civil engineer) had been Duleep&#x27;s mistress before he decided to return to India with his family, and upon being stopped in Aden by the British authorities he abandoned his family and moved to Paris, where she joined him. They married in Paris on 28 April 1889. She stayed with him through his years in Paris and also travelled with him to St. Petersburg, Russia, where he failed to persuade the Czar of the benefits of invading India through the north and reinstalling him as ruler. She died in Sussex on 6 August 1930.

Queen Victoria and Maharaja Duleep Singh reconciled their differences before he died. Out of loyalty to Maharani Bamba, the Queen refused to receive Ada, whom she suspected had been involved with the Maharaja before Maharani Bamba&#x27;s death in 1887.

==Miscellany==
In 1854, Madame Blavatsky, the founder of the Theosophical Society, met her Master Morya in England, who was in her words, &quot;in the company of a dethroned native prince&quot;. This &quot;native prince&quot; according to general consent was Sir Duleep Singh.
He was a member of the Freemasons and was admitted into the lodge in 1861.

On 21 October 1893, the day before Sir Duleep Singh&#x27;s death, Prince Victor Duleep Singh, the eldest son of Sir Duleep Singh, had visions of his father looking at him through a picture frame.
Duleep Singh remembered his servant James Cawood who died in 1865 with a gravestone in Killin cemetery, Killin, Scotland.

== Popular culture ==
A 2017 film, &quot;The Black Prince&quot;, by the Indian-born film director Kavi Raz told the story of Duleep and his relationship with Queen Victoria.

Maharaja Duleep Singh&#x27;s character is featured in Ubisoft&#x27;s &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Syndicate&quot; game. He is featured as a young Duleep Singh, which based on his real-life struggle as an exiled ruler in Victorian London.

<text>Acarape is a municipality in the north region of the state of Ceará, Brazil.

==History==
One can attribute the existence of Acarape as simply an urban extension of the city of Redenção given that only 3 km separate the two cities.

Initially the location of today&#x27;s Acarape was called Calaboca which was part of the city of Redenção. When the slaves were freed in Brazil, the people of the very modest location of Calaboca decided to pay homage to their origins, thus changing the name to Acarape which means &quot;from the Acarás&quot;.

Before the change above, Calaboca benefited from rail track linking Fortaleza to Baturité and the establishment of a rail station in Calaboca on October 26, 1879.

Being part of a major rail route served as an incentive for small merchants to open stores in Calaboca. The population grew and on April 16, 1987, the location became a municipality with the name of Acarape.

== Agriculture ==
* Sugarcane
* Bean

== Industries ==
* Cachaça: Ypióca group

== Curiosities ==
Acarape is also used by the population as a reference to city water. If one person says to be drinking water from Acarape, this person is saying that the water is tap water. This is the case, because one of the largest dams in the state of Ceará is the Acarape do Meio Dam at Redenção.

<doc id="820772" wikidata="Q764778" url="?curid=820772" title="Ice Hockey Superleague">
<text>The British Ice Hockey Superleague (BISL, also known as the Sekonda Ice Hockey Superleague from 1998 to 1999 for sponsorship reasons) was a professional ice hockey league in the United Kingdom between 1996 and 2003. Devised in 1995, it replaced the premier division of the British Hockey League at the end of 1995–1996 season; following the major reshuffle of the league and the split between the first and second tier divisions; with the British National League becoming the new second tier division. It was disbanded after the 2002-03 season and replaced by the Elite Ice Hockey League. Unlike its North American counterparts, the Superleague was not divided into conferences; teams competed in a single division.

==History==
The Ice Hockey Superleague Ltd was established on 1 November 1995 and held its first season in 1996-97 with eight founding clubs – Ayr Scottish Eagles, Basingstoke Bison, Bracknell Bees, Cardiff Devils, Manchester Storm, Newcastle Cobras, Nottingham Panthers, and Sheffield Steelers.

===Overview===
Several competitions fell under the jurisdiction of the Superleague. The Superleague ran a total of four competitions: the League, the Play-offs, the Express Cup and the Benson and Hedges Cup. The league consisted of a single division, each team playing three home games and three away games against the other teams in the league. Two points were awarded for a win and one point for an overtime defeat. Overtime consisted of 10 minutes of sudden death. The team that had most points after all fixtures were completed were declared Superleague champions.

After the regular season was complete, the teams would be entered into the play-offs, the winner of which won the British Championship. The teams were entered into two groups, Group A and Group B, each team playing three home games and three away games against the other teams in the group. Two points were awarded for a win and one point for an overtime defeat. Overtime consisted of 10 minutes of sudden death. The top two teams in each group qualified for the semi-finals, which were straight knockout matches. Both the semi-finals and final took place over the course of a weekend.

The Superleague was governed by a board of directors who were the owners of the participating teams with Martin Weddell as chairman. The chief executive Ian Taylor from 1996 to 1902 was replaced by the league&#x27;s former secretary, Brian Storey in what would be the league&#x27;s final season of 2003. A system of promotion and relegation was not operated by the Superleague; teams entered the league on the basis of a decision by the board of directors, however the British National league was regarded as the league below the level of the Superleague.

===Trophy===
The trophy that was awarded to the winners of the superleague, was called the Ice hockey superleague trophy. It was a silver replica of a George III Monteith Bowl. In the inaugural season, the trophy was taken around the arenas of the superleague teams and publicly displayed on the following dates:

* 21 September 1996 – Bracknell
* 22 September 1996 – Cardiff
* 1 October 1996 – Nottingham
* 5 October 1996 – Sheffield
* 10 October 1996 – Newcastle
* 10 November 1996 – Ayr
* 17 November 1996 – Manchester
* 23 November 1996 – Basingstoke

The trophy itself resembled a Monteith bowl used to cool wine (or punch) glasses that are suspended by their feet through the scallop-edged rim of the bowl. The bowl itself was made of silver, was 14 inches in diameter and 12 inches tall with a mahogany plinth.
===Sekonda sponsorship===
In 1998, the Superleague secured a major sponsorship deal with Sekonda. Sekonda remained the title sponsor until 2002, during which time the league was known as the Sekonda Ice Hockey Superleague. During this time, the man of the match awards were presented with a Sekonda watch.

Each month one of the man of the match winners would be selected as the &quot;Sekonda Face to Watch&quot;. At the end of each season the &quot;Sekonda Superleague Player of the Year&quot; would be selected from the Sekonda Face to Watch winners by a panel of journalists — except for the season 2001-02 when Sekonda&#x27;s sponsorship finished part way through the season.


===Collapse===
Cardiff Devils and Newcastle Jesters pulled out of the league in 2001, reducing the membership of the Superleague to seven clubs. Then, Manchester Storm and Scottish Eagles both folded within a week of one another during the early stages of the 2002-03 season, leaving just five teams remaining. To make matters worse, in December 2002 Bracknell Bees announced their intention to resign from the league to join the BNL at the end of the season, and uncertainty arose surrounding the future of London Knights and their London Arena home at this time; which ultimately led to the Knights folding in 2003. Owing a large debt to Ice Hockey UK and facing the prospect of having only three member clubs, the Superleague placed itself into liquidation on 30 April 2003.

===Elite ice hockey league===
The Elite Ice Hockey League was formed by the remaining three clubs (Belfast Giants, Nottingham Panthers, and Sheffield Steelers) and played their first season on 12 September 2003. The Elite league is seen as the successor league to the Ice Hockey Superleague.

==Participating clubs==
The superleague was formed with eight founding clubs, with nine participating at any one time at its peak. Ten clubs have played in the Superleague.
* Denotes founding member
† Club folded in the 2002–03 season.

==Champions==
==Criticism==
There were two main areas of criticism of the Superleague. It was widely regarded that the league was too reliant on imported players, illustrated by the participation of only four British trained players in the 2003 season. The financial situation of the league was unsustainable partly due to a high salary cap at £400k. Smaller teams such as Bracknell couldn&#x27;t compete with the larger arena teams who had higher revenues.

<text>Gaydon is a civil parish and village in the Stratford-on-Avon District of Warwickshire, England, situated between Leamington Spa and Banbury. In the 2001 census, the parish had a population of 376, increasing to 446 at the 2011 census and 530 residents at the 2021 census.

The village is at the junction of the B4100 (former A41) and B4451 roads, within a mile from Junction 12 of the M40 motorway and midway between the larger villages of Kineton, 3 miles to the south-west, and Bishop&#x27;s Itchington 3 miles to the north-east. The county border with Oxfordshire is 5.5 miles to the south-east and the Northamptonshire boundary lies 6.5 miles to the east of the village.

==Gaydon village==
Gaydon is crossed by only two roads of any importance – the Kineton to Southam road, which runs in a north-easterly direction, and the Warwick and Banbury road which crosses it at right angles. Gaydon has one pub called the Malt Shovel. The Gaydon Inn, which is no longer a pub is due to be redeveloped for housing, stands close to the point of intersection of the two roads. The village centre is situated along a short loop south of the junction. The Gaydon Inn was famous in the 18th century for its association with violent highwaymen.

The Malt Shovel pub, together with the adjacent community shop, is located off Church Road and is now the only commercial enterprise in the village.

The Manor House on Kineton Road dates back to the 17th century.

Although Gaydon has become something of a commuter village because of its proximity to the M40, which was completed in January 1991, it is undergoing a revival by looking back at its roots, agriculture and community spirit. A village shop opened in May 2010 in the centre of the village.

The section of the M40 passing Gaydon was considered as the site of a possible motorway service station, with plans first being drawn up in 1986 before being scrapped in 1990, a few months before the motorway&#x27;s completion.

==Motor industry==
Close by, on the site of former RAF V bomber base of RAF Gaydon, is the Jaguar Land Rover Gaydon Centre, one of the Jaguar Land Rover engineering centres (another being at the Whitley plant in Coventry). Alongside is the British Motor Museum, home to the largest collection of historic British cars in the world, charting the history of the British car industry from the turn of the 20th century to the present day. Adjacent to the north of the JLR site is the headquarters and main production plant of Aston Martin (actually closer to Lighthorne Heath village) and the village fire station. Famous James Bond cars including the DBS V12 and the Aston Martin DB10 have been built here.

==Film archive==
A disused military base near Gaydon is also home to special vaults housing the highly flammable nitrate film elements of the British Film Institute&#x27;s BFI National Archive, the world&#x27;s largest archive of film and television.

<doc id="820800" wikidata="Q4031586" url="?curid=820800" title="5-MeO-AMT">
<text>5-MeO-αMT, or 5-methoxy-α-methyltryptamine, also known as α,&quot;O&quot;-dimethylserotonin (Alpha-O), is a serotonergic psychedelic of the tryptamine family. It is a derivative of α-methyltryptamine (αMT) and an analogue of 5-MeO-DMT.

==Recreational use==
5-MeO-AMT is supposedly sold in 4 mg tablets by the street name Alpha-O and taken as a recreational drug. Since the DEA arrests of the makers of a huge percentage of the United States&#x27; LSD in 2000, 5-MeO-AMT may have occasionally been sold under the guise of LSD in liquid, sugar cube, or blotter form, though this may be due to DEA reports of finding it on sugar cubes and blotters like LSD.

The most common route of administration for 5-MeO-AMT is orally. Anecdotal reports, however, have described snorting or smoking the substance. Intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) routes are rarely, if ever, used outside research settings due to the high potency, powerful effects and quicker onset.

== Effects ==
The effects of 5-MeO-AMT occur at 4–7 mg orally for most users.

Erowid lists the following effects:

===Positive===
* Increased energy
* Improved mood heading into euphoria at higher doses
* Increased sociability, gregariousness
* Increased giggling and laughter
* Increased sense of creative thinking
* Increased pleasure from sense of touch
* Intensification of sex for some users

===Neutral===
* Lightheadedness
* Brightening of colors
* Visuals including motion, waves, breathing walls, etc. (usually at higher doses, over 4–5 mg)
* Increased attention to detail
* Auditory distortions and/or hallucinations (usually at higher doses)

===Negative===
* Headache
* Body fatigue
* Chills from elevated body temperature (potential dehydration)
* Stress and extreme fatigue from long duration of effects.
* Nausea, diarrhea
* Vomiting 
* Difficulty sleeping or resting for 12–24 hours after ingestion.
* Paranoia, irritability, anxiety (increasing with dose).
* Delusional, aggressive, or dissociated behaviour at very high doses (20+ mg)
* Risk of death

==Dangers==
If misrepresented as LSD, 5-MeO-AMT can be extremely dangerous; users may take a number of &quot;hits&quot; of 5-MeO-AMT, assuming that it is LSD. Unlike LSD, which is very safe in overdose, 5-MeO-AMT can be very harmful or fatal. Particularly sensitive individuals can experience symptoms of overdose at dosages in the normal (for most users) range — as low as 20 mg. This has led to at least a few hospitalizations and possibly more than one death. It is likely that the overdose potential of the compound is due to its sympathomimetic effects, as the side effects noted in overdose cases include cardiac arrhythmia and seizure. It also seems that oral consumption is safer than insufflation.

Gloria Discerni, 18, died after overdosing on a drug initially believed to be LSD. Authorities learned months later that the drug wasn&#x27;t LSD but a &quot;designer drug&quot; identified as 5-MeO-AMT.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
5-MeO-AMT acts as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2B receptors, among others. Its at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor has been found to be 2 to 8.4nM. In relation to this, it is an extremely potent agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor &quot;in vitro&quot;, showing the highest potency of any other tryptamine assessed in one study. Its potency in activating the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor was 38-fold higher than that of dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and 361-fold higher than that of psilocin in the same study. It is also a highly potent agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor, with an of 4nM.

Whereas tryptamine, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), and αMT show potent activity as monoamine releasing agents, including of serotonin, norepinephrine, and/or dopamine, the monoamine-releasing activity of 5-methoxylated tryptamine derivatives, like 5-methoxytryptamine, 5-MeO-NMT, and 5-MeO-DMT among others, is dramatically reduced or abolished. Accordingly, whereas the values of αMT for induction of monoamine release are 22 to 68nM for serotonin, 79 to 112nM for norepinephrine, and 79 to 180nM for dopamine, the values in the case of 5-MeO-AMT are 460nM for serotonin, 8,900nM for norepinephrine, and 1,500nM for dopamine. Similarly, it is of very low potency as a monoamine reuptake inhibitor ( values &gt;1,000nM). Considering the very high potency of 5-MeO-AMT in activating the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, its weak activities as a monoamine releasing agent and reuptake inhibitor are of questionable significance.

5-MeO-AMT is a weak monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) inhibitor, with an of 31,000nM. For comparison, the of AMT for MAO-A inhibition was 380nM (~82-fold more potent than 5-MeO-AMT) and the values of amphetamine (and its enantiomers) for MAO-A inhibition have been reported to be 11,000 to 70,000nM.

5-MeO-AMT produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in animals, and this is reversed by the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin. It substitutes for other psychedelics such as DOM and LSD in animal drug discrimination tests, but does not substitute for entactogens like MDMA or psychostimulants like dextromethamphetamine or cocaine. The drug does not produce locomotor hyperactivity, behavioral sensitization, conditioned place preference, or self-administration, further indicating a lack of psychostimulant-like effects as well as misuse potential. 5-MeO-AMT is known to produce sympathomimetic effects, but these effects likely depend on serotonin 5-HT2A receptor activation rather than on monoamine release or reuptake inhibition. Other serotonergic psychedelics are also well known to produce sympathomimetic effects.

==Chemistry==
5-MeO-AMT, also known as 5-methoxy-α-methyltryptamine, is a substituted tryptamine derivative. It is a derivative of tryptamine (T), 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MeO-T or 5-MT), and α-methyltryptamine (AMT or αMT) and is an analogue of other tryptamines like α-methylserotonin (5-HO-AMT) and 5-MeO-DMT. Some derivatives of 5-MeO-AMT include α,&quot;N&quot;-dimethyl-5-methoxytryptamine (5-MeO-α-Me-NMT or α,&quot;N&quot;,&quot;O&quot;-TMS) and α,&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-trimethyl-5-methoxytryptamine (5-MeO-α-Me-DMT or α,&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;,&quot;O&quot;-TMS). As noted by Alexander Shulgin, the α-methylated tryptamines can be looked at as the tryptamine homologues of the amphetamines (α-methylated phenethylamines).

5-MeO-AMT is soluble in ethanol.

==History==
5-MeO-AMT was first described in the scientific literature by 1980. It was described by Alexander Shulgin and colleagues.

==Legal status==

===Australia===
5-MeO-AMT is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.

===Sweden===
&quot;Sveriges riksdags&quot; health ministry &quot;Statens folkhälsoinstitut&quot; classified 5-MeO-αMT as &quot;health hazard&quot; under the act &quot;Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor&quot; (translated &quot;Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health&quot;) as of Oct 1, 2004, in their regulation SFS 2004:696 listed as 5-metoxi-alfametyltryptamin (5-MeO-AMT), making it illegal to sell or possess.

===United Kingdom===
5-MeO-αMT was made illegal in the United Kingdom as of 7 January 2015, along with 5-MeO-DALT. This was following the events of 10 June 2014 when the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs recommended that 5-MeO-αMT be scheduled as a class A drug by updating the blanket ban clause on tryptamines.

===United States===
5-MeO-AMT is unscheduled at the federal level in the United States. However, the DEA considers the chemical a controlled substance analogue. The agency&#x27;s opinion on this matter may change at any time.

====Florida====
5-MeO-AMT is a Schedule I controlled substance in the state of Florida, making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess.

<doc id="820822" wikidata="Q633923" url="?curid=820822" title="Tetherball">
<text>Tetherball is a game where two players use their hands to strike a volleyball which is suspended from a stationary metal pole by a rope or tether. The two players stand on opposite sides of the pole, and each tries to hit the ball one way; one clockwise, and one counterclockwise. The game ends when one player manages to wind the ball all the way around the pole so that it is stopped by the rope. It must not bounce.

An early variant described in Jessie H. Bancroft&#x27;s 1909 book &quot;Games for the Playground&quot; involves a tethered tennis ball hit by racquets, with similar rules of the game. This variant is known as swingball, which was invented by Gavin Gormely in South Africa. The variation of the game with the volleyball, known as tetherball now, did not come about until the invention of the volleyball sometime after 1895. In the 1920s, schools and parks began adding them to their play area.

The game begins when one player serves the ball, usually by holding it in one hand and hitting it with the other. The opposing player then attempts to return the serve by hitting it in the opposite direction. The object is to hit the ball in such a way that one&#x27;s opponent will be unable to alter the ball&#x27;s direction. This gives the server an advantage since the server has more control over the ball from the beginning. It is generally acceptable to hit the ball with either the fist or the open hand or swing.

A player commits a violation if they step onto their opponent&#x27;s half of the pole, by touching the rope instead of the ball, hitting the ball before it has either circled the pole or been returned by the opponent or, in some variants, struck the pole. Generally, after a violation occurs, the game pauses and the person who committed the violation is out; the number of wraps around the pole is re-created (or a penalty-wrap is awarded to the player who did not commit the foul). The player who did not commit the violation then serves the ball. If, however, the violation appears to be intentional, it may result in loss of game. One variation legalizes throws and double hits.

The game ends when one player hits the ball around the pole in their own direction as far as it will go, so that the ball hits the pole. In addition, the ball must strike the pole with the final wrap above a line marked on the pole. A mark is satisfactory, though a lower mark might be used for younger players. A match can go on for at least 2 or more games. If a player breaks any of these rules, they are out and it is the next person&#x27;s turn to play the winner. If played with only two people, the &quot;loser&quot; now gets their turn to serve to even out the odds for their win.

==Equipment==

Tetherball requires a stationary pole, a rope, and a ball. The ball is roughly the size and weight of a volleyball, but is somewhat firmer unless a soft tetherball is specifically purchased. Tetherballs usually have a bar recessed in the top that the rope is tied to. Some simply have loops that protrude out, but this is less common as striking the loop with the hand can be painful.

The pole is often high, and can be as low as high depending upon the height of the players. To keep the pole stationary, it is either anchored down by using a concrete-filled tire or a blow molded plastic base filled with sand or water or in some cases concrete, or is embedded in the ground. The rope is generally slender nylon, and is long enough so that the ball hangs about above the ground. The rope is generally 8 feet to 10 feet long.

Tetherball is played on many surfaces, including sand, gravel, lawn, and asphalt. It is common particularly in schoolyards due to the ease of setting up, and the long-lasting equipment- unlike other ball games where the ball can be destroyed or lost.

<text>Leon Russell (born Claude Russell Bridges; April 2, 1942 – November 13, 2016) was an American musician and songwriter who was involved with numerous bestselling records during his 60-year career that spanned multiple genres, including rock and roll, country, gospel, bluegrass, rhythm and blues, southern rock, blues rock, folk, surf and the Tulsa sound. His recordings earned six gold records and he received two Grammy Awards from seven nominations. In 1973 &quot;Billboard&quot; named Russell the &quot;Top Concert Attraction in the World&quot;. In 2011, he was inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

Russell collaborated with many notable artists and recorded 33 albums and 430 songs. He wrote &quot;Delta Lady&quot;, recorded by Joe Cocker, and organized and performed with Cocker&#x27;s &quot;Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen&quot; tour in 1970. His &quot;A Song for You&quot;, which was named to the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2018, has been recorded by more than 200 artists, and his song &quot;This Masquerade&quot; by more than 75.

As a pianist, Russell played in his early years on albums by the Beach Boys, The Ventures, Dick Dale, and Jan and Dean. On his first album, &quot;Leon Russell&quot;, in 1970, the musicians included Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr, and George Harrison. One of his early fans, Elton John, said that Russell was a &quot;mentor&quot; and an &quot;inspiration&quot;. They recorded their album &quot;The Union&quot; in 2010, earning them a Grammy nomination.

Russell produced and played in recording sessions for Bob Dylan, Frank Sinatra, Ike &amp; Tina Turner, the Rolling Stones, and many other artists. He wrote and recorded the hits &quot;Tight Rope&quot; and &quot;Lady Blue&quot;. He performed at The Concert for Bangladesh in 1971, along with Harrison, Dylan, and Clapton; for this he earned a Grammy Award.

==Early life and education==
Russell was born on April 2, 1942, the second of John Griffith and Hester Evel (née Whaley) Bridges&#x27; two sons at Southwestern Hospital in Lawton, Oklahoma. Leon&#x27;s mother said that he started talking later than most children. She said while he was &quot;watching the birds, and something was going on with the birds&quot;, Leon&#x27;s first words were &quot;What&#x27;s the matter little birdie, you cry?&quot;. His mother said &quot;she was shocked, because he never spoke&quot;.

Leon Russell said he &quot;was born with &#x27;spastic paralysis&#x27;, now called cerebral palsy&quot;. An injury at birth damaged his second and third vertebrae, causing a slight paralysis in the right side of his body, most notably affecting three fingers on his right hand which caused Russell to favor his left hand and develop his signature left-hand-dominant piano playing style. He said &quot;My chops have always been sort of weak... I have damaged nerve endings on the right side, so my piano style comes from designing stuff I can play with my right hand&quot;. He said that the condition helped him become &quot;very aware of the duality involved in our plane of existence here&quot;. He also had a limp caused by the same condition that was once thought to be due to polio. Russell said &quot;I felt like the world had cheated me big time&quot; but added &quot;If I hadn&#x27;t had the problem, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have gotten into music at all and would have been an ex-football player, selling insurance in Des Moines&quot;.

Both of Leon&#x27;s parents played upright piano, and when he was four years old his mother heard him picking out the melody to &quot;Trust and Obey&quot;, a hymn he had heard at church. He then began piano lessons in Anadarko, Oklahoma, a trip each way; Anadarko is northeast of Lawton. While still taking piano lessons, Leon learned the alto saxophone and cornet in his elementary school band. He then learned to play the baritone horn. After impressing the Maysville High School band director in Maysville, south of Norman, Oklahoma, Russell was invited to join the high school marching band while in the fifth grade. Russell said he learned to fake a classical piano style, saying &quot;I studied classical music for a long time, maybe ten years, and I realized, finally, I was never going to have the hands to play that stuff. It was too complicated. I invented ways to play in a classical style that was not the real deal&quot;.

===High school===
Russell attended Will Rogers High School in Tulsa, Oklahoma. His classmates included Elvin Bishop, Anita Bryant, and David Gates. Russell&#x27;s first record appearance was in 1957 age 15 years old, when he played piano on &quot;Jo-Baby&quot;, a song written by 16 year-old Gates. Originally attributed to &quot;The Accents&quot; it was released on the Tulsa-based Perspective Sound label then re-released a year later and distributed nationally by Marty Robbins on his Robbins Records record label under the band name &quot;David Gates &amp; The Accents&quot;. Russell collaborated later with Gates after high school in the band The Fencemen.
Russell credited his awareness of the precursors of American soul music to a homemade AM crystal radio. He was offered a chance to tour with Jerry Lee Lewis after graduating. Explaining his decision to not attend college, Russell said, &quot;I figured this was my chance to eat in a lot of restaurants and travel around, play some rock and roll music, which I decided was easier and better&quot;.

Performing while underage in clubs and bars, Russell assumed the name &quot;Leon Russell&quot; from a fake ID card he used to enter clubs even though he was a high school student. At the time, Oklahoma was a &quot;dry&quot; state, so teenagers were able to perform in clubs that ordinarily would have only been open to those over 21 years of age.

Although still in high school, Russell performed at area supper clubs, bars and nightclubs with his group &quot;The Starlighters&quot; (Russell, J.J. Cale, Leo Feathers, Johnny Williams, and Chuck Blackwell). Blackwell said that Russell was &quot;especially good at playing Erroll Garner-style jazz during dinner, but then, after everybody got through eating, he&#x27;d break into Jerry Lee Lewis&quot;. Russell also backed groups in Tulsa including Ronnie Hawkins and The Hawks, often until early morning, after having worked through the night. Russell said &quot;I worked six or seven nights a week till I left Tulsa at 17. I&#x27;d work 6 to 11 (pm) at a beer joint, then 1 to 5 (am) at an after-hours club. It was a hard schedule to do when going to school. I slept in English a lot&quot;.

===Los Angeles===
Russell said &quot;I got out to California, and they were more serious about their liquor laws. I about starved to death because it was so much harder to find work at my age&quot;. Settling in Los Angeles, he studied guitar with James Burton.

Russell was primarily a session musician in his early career. During session work he played for and with artists as varied as Jan and Dean, Ricky Nelson, Gary Lewis &amp; the Playboys, George Harrison, Delaney Bramlett, Freddy Cannon, Ringo Starr, Doris Day, Elton John, Ray Charles, Eric Clapton, the Byrds, Barbra Streisand, the Beach Boys, the Ventures, Willie Nelson, Badfinger, the Tijuana Brass, Frank Sinatra, the Band, Bob Dylan, J. J. Cale, B.B. King, Dave Mason, Glen Campbell, Lynn Anderson, Joe Cocker, the Rolling Stones, and the Flying Burrito Brothers.

As Russell developed his solo artist career, he crossed genres to include rock and roll, blues, bluegrass, and gospel music.

==1960s - Session musician, solo artist, and record executive==

In Los Angeles, Russell played as a studio musician on many of the popular songs of the 1960s, including The Byrds, Gary Lewis &amp; the Playboys, Bobby Pickett, and Herb Alpert. He played piano on Phil Spector productions including recordings by the Ronettes, the Crystals, and Darlene Love and in the 1963 &quot;A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector&quot; album.

Alpert said of Russell, &quot;Leon was on several sessions that I produced with the Tijuana Brass. He was always dressed in a suit and tie, with short hair and no beard! This was soon after he arrived in Los Angeles from Oklahoma. We would go through the same routine each time I started rehearsing the music. He would sit at the piano and he would always say, &#x27;I don’t know what to play&#x27;. And I would say, &#x27;Just wait and see if you feel something, and if you don’t it’s okay. I just like your energy at the sessions&#x27;. Well, he would always chime in with something special and affect the groove in a very Leon Russell way that was always unique. Leon was a wonderful musician and had a major effect on all of my recordings. His touch can be heard on many Tijuana Brass records, including &quot;Whipped Cream&quot; and &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot;. To top it off, Leon was a true gentleman with a special talent and he was a person that I had a great feeling for&quot;. In 1962 Russell played piano on Walter Brennan&#x27;s lp &quot;Old Rivers&quot;, produced by Snuff Garrett. Garrett said &quot;I could talk style with him (Russell) and he&#x27;d do it. I&#x27;d name a record. I&#x27;d go, &#x27;I like the piano on this... and he&#x27;d go, &#x27;Okay&#x27;, and do the piano part... I fell in love with his playing&quot;.

Credited as Russell Bridges, he contributed to the Canadian Sweethearts&#x27; (Bob Regan and Lucille Starr) first A&amp;M Records recording session with Dorsey Burnette in 1963. The lp &quot;Introducing The Canadian Sweethearts&quot; was released in 1964. Glen Campbell&#x27;s 1967 album &quot;Gentle on My Mind&quot; credited him as Russell Bridges on piano.

===Early media appearances===
In 1962 a 20 year-old Russell appeared on Los Angeles TV station KCOP leading The Leon Russell Trio on the rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll show &quot;Stepping Out&quot;. Airing at 11:00 at night, the live broadcast often aired multiple times per week. He was in the 1964 concert film &quot;T.A.M.I. Show&quot; playing piano with the Wrecking Crew sporting short, dark, slicked-back hair, in contrast to his later look.

===Early recordings===
In 1962 a 20 year-old Russell once again collaborated with David Gates, releasing the 45 rpm single &quot;Sad September / Tryin’ To Be Someone&quot; which featured session guitarist James Burton. Credited to David &amp; Lee and later to Dave &amp; Lee, the record was produced by Gary Paxton and first released on Paxton&#x27;s G.S.P. Records label.

===Composer===
In the mid-1960s, he wrote or co-wrote songs, including two hits for Gary Lewis and the Playboys: &quot;Everybody Loves a Clown&quot; (which reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40 on October 9, 1965, remaining on the chart for eight weeks and reaching number 4) and &quot;She&#x27;s Just My Style&quot; (which entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40 on December 18, 1965, and rose to number 3).

===Hired by Snuff Garrett===
Russell was hired by Snuff Garrett and together they formed a production company, Snuff Garrett Productions in 1964. Russell was a production assistant, arranger and creative developer for the company. Russell played on many number-one singles, including &quot;This Diamond Ring&quot; by Gary Lewis &amp; the Playboys. Russell also acted as Garrett&#x27;s arranger and conductor of the Midnight String Quartet&#x27;s debut album &quot;Rhapsodies For Young Lovers&quot;. The album was planned as a solo Leon Russell lp, but was instead marketed as a Midnight String Quartet production.

Russell and Al Capps arranged Brian Hyland&#x27;s 1966 single &quot;The Joker Went Wild&quot;, written by Bobby Russell (no relation to Leon). Russell also played xylophone and bells on the record. Jason Ankeny of AllMusic said &quot;Russell&#x27;s evocative arrangements lend &#x27;The Joker Went Wild&#x27; much of its appeal, however, channeling the lessons of Phil Spector and Brian Wilson to create rich, bold pop far greater than the sum of its parts&quot;. The track reached #20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Two years later, Garrett and Russell started Viva Records. Russell was the record label&#x27;s initial A&amp;R representative as well as producer for many of the label&#x27;s recordings, including The Shindogs&#x27; 1966 &quot;Who Do You Think You Are / Yes, I’m Going Home&quot; (Viva V-601). Viva Records also had a number of music publishing divisions. In 1969, it was reported Russell had been the vice-president of Viva.

Russell said the music he created while collaborating with Garrett motivated him to leave. &quot;That wasn&#x27;t my cup of tea... it wasn&#x27;t the kind of thing I liked. I was anxious to not do that very much anymore, it just seemed too fluffy&quot;.

===The Shindogs===
Russell was an arranger and songwriter as well as a piano and guitar player in The Shindogs, the house band on the ABC-TV dance show series &quot;Shindig!&quot; Fellow musicians Glen Campbell, Delaney Bramlett, and Billy Preston were among the Shindogs&#x27; alumni.

===Released first solo record===
Russell released his first solo record, the single, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Talking &#x27;Bout the Young&quot;, for Dot Records in 1965. Produced by Russell and Snuff Garrett, the folk-rock, anti-Vietnam war protest song was co-written by Russell, T. Lesslie (Snuff Garrett) and J. J. Cale.

===Skyhill Studios===
In 1965 Russell built his first recording studio, Skyhill Studios inside his 2,900 sq. ft., 4 bedroom home at 7709 Skyhill Drive in the Hollywood Hills. Russell had seen and worked in similar home recording studios owned by Les Paul, Ernie Kovacs and others. He hired fellow Tulsan J.J. Cale as his in-home studio manager. Cale said &quot;the neighbors thought the Hell’s Angels lived at Skyhill because of all the cars, motorcycles, and loud music at all hours of the day and night&quot;. Russell and his friends referred to the studio as &quot;the home for unwed musicians&quot;.

Russell&#x27;s recording studio home featured sound proofing, double walls and extensive wiring. Different rooms throughout the house were used to record various instruments, with a bathroom dedicated for use as an echo-chamber. The first recording session in the studio was an August 1965 Glen Campbell session. Russell’s Skyhill Studios was often used by up-and-coming artists to record demos to attract recording companies&#x27; attention.

===Hired by Lenny Waronker===
Russell was hired as an arranger and producer in 1967 by Lenny Waronker, then a junior A&amp;R representative for the Reprise and Warner Bros. record labels. Russell&#x27;s early work for Waronker included arranging and producing Harpers Bizarre&#x27;s 1967 debut album &quot;Feelin&#x27; Groovy&quot; which featured a cover of &quot;The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin&#x27; Groovy)&quot;. Russell also played piano on the track.

Russell also co-produced and arranged recordings by Canadian folk-rock singer Tom Northcott, including a cover version of Donovan&#x27;s &quot;Sunny Goodge Street&quot;.

===The Asylum Choir===
In 1968 Russell formed The Asylum Choir, a two-man group with Marc Benno. Benno, a Texan, sang and played guitar and bass. Russell sang and played guitar, piano, and drums. The duo had met in LA. Their twenty-six minute long LP &quot;Look Inside the Asylum Choir&quot; was released on Smash Records.

===Shelter Records===
Russell and music producer Denny Cordell established Shelter Records in 1969. The company operated from 1969 to 1981, with offices in Los Angeles and Tulsa. Shelter Records released &quot;Duppy Conqueror&quot;, reggae artist Bob Marley&#x27;s first American single.

In 1972, DC Comics sued the record label for copyright infringement. The Shelter Records logo included an upside down version of the well-known Superman logo. Shelter Records obscured the logo with an overstamped black rectangle in response to the lawsuit and later settlement. Later versions of the logo replaced the Superman artwork with a scrawled letter &quot;S&quot; inside an outline of an egg.

===Delaney &amp; Bonnie===
Russell performed as a member of Delaney &amp; Bonnie and Friends in 1969 and 1970, playing guitar and keyboards on their albums and as part of the touring band. Through this group, he met George Harrison and others with whom he would work over the next couple of years.

===&quot;Joe Cocker!&quot; LP===
Russell was the co-producer, arranger, a songwriter and performer on Joe Cocker’s 1969 LP &quot;Joe Cocker!&quot;
Russell wrote the song &quot;Delta Lady&quot; on the album. The album reached number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==1970s - &quot;Superstar&quot; status==

===&quot;Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen&quot; tour and album===

In March 1970 Russell was hired by Joe Cocker to help quickly mount a concert band and rehearse a 48 date tour. Cocker said he had been told by United States immigration authorities he had to perform &quot;right away&quot; or lose his visa and be deported from the U.S. Rita Coolidge claimed the real reason was due to threats that Cocker would be physically harmed if he didn&#x27;t comply with an order to tour.

Russell had only a week to locate, audition, hire and rehearse a 10-piece band and the Space Choir which would consist of 10 backup singers. Russell said Cocker, reportedly using copious illicit drugs at the time &quot;was pretty wrecked when we started out&quot;. Asking Cocker &quot;Does it sound good to you?&quot; during an audition, Cocker said &quot;It never sounds right to me&quot;.
&quot;I didn’t know how to take that. So I said, &#x27;Shit, I’ll just do whatever I want&#x27;&quot;. Russell hired many of the musicians from Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett&#x27;s band. He both conducted and performed in the tour, playing either piano or lead guitar. Singer and former Ikette Claudia Lennear, who performed during the tour, said Russell had the unique musical talent of being able to fuse together &quot;white gospel and Black gospel&quot;.

After watching the &quot;Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen&quot; concert film, Elton John said of Russell &quot;There are some people who are born to be leaders of musicians and he is. It was Leon I was watching. He had the feel for that music. Joe was an amazing singer. But you could tell it was Leon&#x27;s band&quot;.

Russell purchased the top hat and Holy Trinity basketball jersey shirt he wore on the tour at a used clothing store near his Skyhill Studios in Los Angeles. He explained &quot;I’m an actor - I was just trying to make a show&quot;.

===&quot;Leon Russell&quot; (solo album)===
Russell released his 1970 solo album, &quot;Leon Russell&quot; on his Shelter Records label during the Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen tour. The album, recorded at Sunset Sound Recorders in Los Angeles featured a number of guest vocalists and musicians, including Marc Benno, Bonnie Bramlett, Eric Clapton, Merry Clayton, Joe Cocker, Greg Dempsey, Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Chris Stainton, and Ringo Starr. The album included two Russell compositions that have become best-selling standards, &quot;A Song for You&quot; and &quot;Delta Lady&quot;.

===&quot;A Song For You&quot;===
Russell explained how he wrote &quot;A Song For You&quot;, saying &quot;I was in my studio in Hollywood and actually I was trying to write a standard. I was trying to write a blues song that Frank Sinatra and Ray Charles both could sing... I wrote it in 10 minutes. It was for a specific occasion. And I went in there and wrote it very quickly... that happens sometimes. Sometimes they&#x27;re very quick. It&#x27;s almost as if one is not writing them, you know? Like they&#x27;re coming from another place&quot;.

&quot;A Song for You&quot; has become one of Russell&#x27;s best-known songs, with versions released by more than 40 different artists, including Elkie Brooks, The Carpenters, Ray Charles, Billy Eckstine, Donny Hathaway, Peggy Lee, Carmen McRae, Willie Nelson, Freda Payne, Helen Reddy, and The Temptations. Both the Carpenters and The Temptations named an album after the song. Ray Charles&#x27; version earned him the 1994 Grammy Award for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance. &quot;A Song For You&quot; was inducted into Grammy Hall Of Fame in 2018.

===&quot;Delta Lady&quot;===
Russell&#x27;s &quot;Delta Lady&quot; was first released in 1969 on &quot;The Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen&quot; lp, performed by Joe Cocker. Cocker&#x27;s version changes Russell&#x27;s original lyric from &quot;I’m over here in England&quot; to &quot;when I’m home again in England&quot; as Cocker was British. Bobbie Gentry performed the song under the title &quot;Delta Man&quot; on her 1970 album &quot;Fancy&quot;.

===1970s recordings and concerts===
In 1970, Russell played piano on Dave Mason&#x27;s album &quot;Alone Together&quot;, notably on the song &quot;Sad and Deep as You&quot;. The song &quot;The Letter&quot; performed by Joe Cocker with Leon Russell &amp; the Shelter People peaked at #7 on the Hot 100 on May 30, 1970; this was Russell&#x27;s first hit song.

In November 1970, Russell performed at the Fillmore East, with Elton John on the same bill. Those performances have been bootlegged. Russell and John appeared on &quot;The David Frost Show&quot; with Fillmore owner Bill Graham on December 3, 1970. Russell&#x27;s album &quot;Prince of Peace: Radio Broadcast 1970&quot; is a soundboard recording of a concert at Fillmore East in late 1970. Leon Russell and Friends recorded the &quot;Homewood Sessions&quot;, broadcast as an &quot;unscripted and unrehearsed&quot; one-hour TV special on KCET (Los Angeles) that aired in December 1970 and was later re-broadcast several times on the Public Broadcasting Service.

Also in December 1970, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine carried an interview with Russell. It opened with a characterization of his sound as &quot;those driving, lurchy, churchy rock and roll songs&quot;. Russell produced some tracks for Bob Dylan in March 1971 when Dylan was experimenting with his new sound. The sessions produced the single &quot;Watching the River Flow&quot; and &quot;When I Paint My Masterpiece&quot;, both of which prominently featured Russell&#x27;s gospel-flavored piano.

At the invitation of George Harrison, Russell played piano on Badfinger&#x27;s third album, &quot;Straight Up&quot; in the summer of 1971. Leon performed piano, vocals, bass and backing vocals at the two shows of the war-refugees&#x27; benefit (Concert for Bangladesh) on August 1, 1971. He was featured performing a medley of the songs &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot; and &quot;Young Blood&quot; and singing a verse on Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Beware of Darkness&quot;. Bob Dylan surprised Russell by asking him to play bass for some of Dylan&#x27;s portion of the concert; Russell and Harrison sang harmonies on the chorus of &quot;Just Like a Woman&quot;. &quot;The Concert for Bangladesh&quot; benefit album released in late 1971 was a major critical and commercial success. The release topped album charts in several countries, and went on to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in March 1973. The Concert also became an Apple concert benefit film directed by Saul Swimmer and released in spring, 1972.

In 1971, Shelter Records released &quot;Leon Russell and the Shelter People&quot; and &quot;Asylum Choir II&quot; (co-produced by Marc Benno) and recorded at Russell&#x27;s Skyhill Studios. &quot;Leon Russell and the Shelter People&quot; went on to be Russell&#x27;s first U.S. gold album. In the same year, Russell played on recording sessions with B. B. King, Eric Clapton, and Bob Dylan.

Russell helped the blues guitarist Freddie King revive his career by collaborating on three of King&#x27;s albums for Shelter Records during the early 1970s. During those same years, Russell profited from what was then called the &quot;country and western&quot; market by recording and performing under the moniker Hank Wilson, and was a regular performer at Gilley&#x27;s Club, a honkytonk in Pasadena, Texas, made famous by the film &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot;.

Russell recorded the song &quot;Get a Line on You&quot; at Olympic Studios in October 1969, with contributions from Mick Jagger (lead vocal), Ringo Starr (drums), and probably also Bill Wyman (bass) and Mick Taylor (guitar). It was shelved until 1993, when it was issued as a bonus track on the 24K gold re-release by DCC Compact Classics (DCC Compact Classics GZS 1049). The Rolling Stones included the song, under the title &quot;Shine a Light&quot; on their 1972 album &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;.

In 1972, Russell did a concert tour with his Shelter People entourage. One performance was recorded in California at the Long Beach Arena on August 28, 1972, and was released as a three-record set in 1973 as &quot;Leon Live&quot;. It became his third U.S. gold album. In November 1972, &quot;Billboard&quot; cited Russell as a top concert draw and reported the 1972 tour gross at almost $3 million. Also in 1972, he released his &quot;Carney&quot; album, which was his third solo studio album. The album peaked at number two on the Billboard 200. The album featured &quot;Tight Rope&quot; and &quot;This Masquerade&quot; (songs released on a 45 as the A side and B side respectively), and became his second gold album.

&quot;Looking Back&quot; was released by Russell on Olympic Records in 1973, shortly after the success of his single &quot;Tight Rope&quot;. It contains instrumental tracks recorded in the mid-1960s, featuring Russell playing the harpsichord. In 1975 Russell released &quot;Live In Japan&quot; on Shelter Records. The album was recorded live at Budokan Hall, in Tokyo, on November 8, 1973. Russell made it into the 1975 Top 40 with &quot;Lady Blue&quot;, from his album &quot;Will o&#x27; the Wisp&quot;. It was his fourth gold album.

Helen Reddy recorded Russell&#x27;s song &quot;Bluebird&quot; as a single and on her 1975 album &quot;No Way to Treat a Lady&quot;. The song debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the July 5 issue of the magazine and eventually peaked at number 35. That same issue also marked its debut on the magazine&#x27;s Easy Listening chart, where it spent eight weeks and peaked at number 5; on the &quot;RPM&quot; singles chart it reached number 51. Reddy said, &quot;I love Leon Russell&#x27;s writing and I love this song. It was an integral part of my repertoire for nearly 30 years, and I never tired of singing it.&quot;

===&quot;This Masquerade&quot;===
Russell&#x27;s song &quot;This Masquerade&quot;, the B-side of his 1972 hit single &quot;Tight Rope&quot;, was later recorded by many artists, including Reddy and the Carpenters. George Benson&#x27;s version of the song reached number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and won Record of the Year at the 1977 Grammy Awards. As the songwriter, Russell was nominated for Song of the Year in 1977 but lost to Bruce Johnston, who wrote &quot;I Write the Songs&quot;. Russell&#x27;s version of &quot;This Masquerade&quot; was used for the soundtrack for the psychological thriller film &quot;Bug&quot;, which was directed by William Friedkin. The &quot;Bug&quot; soundtrack was released on May 22, 2007. The song was also used in the movie &quot;The Pursuit of Happyness&quot;.

===&quot;A Star Is Born&quot;===
In 1976, Russell and Barbra Streisand wrote the song &quot;Lost Inside of You&quot; for the film soundtrack of &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;. During a songwriting session at her house, Streisand began playing an original composition on her piano, and Russell was inspired to hum a countermelody which surprised and impressed Streisand. The interplay between the two songwriters was fictionalized for a scene in the film showing Streisand and Kris Kristofferson writing the song together. The &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; soundtrack received a Grammy Nominations for Best Album of Original Score written for a Motion Picture or Television Special.

In 1976, Russell released the &quot;Wedding Album&quot;, a studio album with his then wife, Mary Russell, otherwise known as Mary McCreary. It was the first release by Paradise Records, and it was distributed by Rhino/Warner Bros. Records. Leon and Mary were the album producers, except for the final track &quot;Daylight&quot;, which was produced by its writer, Bobby Womack. On May 15, 1976, Leon and Mary performed &quot;Satisfy You&quot; and &quot;Daylight&quot; with John Belushi impersonating Joe Cocker on Saturday Night Live. &quot;Make Love to the Music&quot; is the second album by Leon &amp; Mary Russell released in 1977 on Paradise Records. In 1978, Russell released his &quot;Americana&quot; album on the Warner Bros. label.

After touring with Willie Nelson, Russell and Nelson in 1979 had a #1 hit on &quot;Billboard&quot;s country music chart with their duet of &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;. This single was nominated for Best Country Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group at the 1979 Grammy Awards (presented on February 27, 1980), with the award going to the Charlie Daniels Band for &quot;The Devil Went Down to Georgia&quot;. They also released their duet country pop-rock studio album, &quot;One for the Road&quot;, that year. It was Russell&#x27;s fifth gold album. The album was nominated for 1979&#x27;s Album of the Year awarded by the Country Music Association, which went to Kenny Rogers for &quot;The Gambler&quot;. The track &quot;I Saw the Light&quot; was nominated for Best Inspirational Performance at the 1979 Grammy Awards, which instead went to B. J. Thomas for his album &quot;You Gave Me Love (When Nobody Gave Me A Prayer)&quot;.

Russell released &quot;Life And Love&quot;, an album on Paradise Records, in 1979. &quot;Life and Love&quot; has country, rock, and blues songs which hark back to Leon&#x27;s work in the early 1970s.

===Building The Church Studio===
Russell purchased multiple properties in the early 1970s in his home state of Oklahoma, including the historic The Church Studio in 1972 located on the corner of 3rd Street and Trenton in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The church was also home to Shelter Records. Many musicians recorded at The Church including Willie Nelson, Eric Clapton, Bonnie Raitt, Dwight Twilley, Dr. John, JJ Cale, the Gap Band, Freddie King, Phoebe Snow, and Peter Tosh. Tom Petty, with his early band Mudcrutch, signed his first record deal with Shelter Records there.

===&quot;A Poem Is a Naked Person&quot;===
In 1972 after viewing Les Blank’s film, &quot;The Blues Accordin’ to Lightnin’ Hopkins&quot;, Russell and Cordell hired Blank to film a documentary of the activities at the Shelter Records studio in Russell&#x27;s compound at the Grand Lake Of The Cherokees in Oklahoma. Blank shot film footage for two years. Russell didn&#x27;t care for the finished film and during the breakup of Shelter Records, traded his forgiveness of some of Cordell&#x27;s loans in exchange for full ownership of the film. Russell would not allow the finished film to be shown, saying &quot;This film will never be seen in public&quot;.

40 years later, a Disney movie changed Russell&#x27;s mind. He explained &quot;After Les Blank died, his son, Harrod, came to see me, offering to recut the film and also digitize it to enhance the quality. Plus, I had recently seen a Disney movie, &quot;Saving Mister Banks&quot;. After watching that, I realized sometimes we just say no to be just saying no, and I realized I was being selfish about it&quot;. Harrod Blank re-mastered and released the film, editing out 14 minutes of the original film. Russell said to Harrod Blank &quot;I don’t know how you did it but this is so much better than what I remembered&quot;.

===&quot;Hank Wilson&quot; persona===
In 1973 Russell created the fictional musical personality &quot;Hank Wilson&quot;, and recorded the album &quot;Hank Wilson&#x27;s Back Vol. I&quot; at producer Owen Bradley&#x27;s Bradley&#x27;s Barn studio in Nashville. He said &quot;&#x27;Hank Wilson&#x27; came about on a road trip. I was bringing a car back from L.A., and I stopped at a truck stop that had about 500 country tapes for sale. I bought a bunch and listened to them on the way home (to Tulsa). I don&#x27;t really listen to records very much, except for research. I liked some of that stuff, though, and thought it would be fun to do a record like that&quot;.

The album reached #28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart in 1973. The first track, &quot;Roll in My Sweet Baby&#x27;s Arms&quot;, was a minor hit. In 2010, a BBC review called Russell&#x27;s album &quot;one of the most joyful sidebars of his career... a deeply entertaining album that, like all great country, turns melancholy and gloom into melody and dancing&quot;.

===The Gap Band===
Russell helped the Gap Band, a trio of Tulsa brothers, kick off their chart success in 1974. The group went on to produce several funk-disco hits. The Gap Band backed Russell on his album &quot;Stop All That Jazz&quot;.

===Helped develop Linn drum machines===
As a teenager, Roger Linn played guitar in Russell&#x27;s band. In 1977 Linn created the first programmable drum machine that used actual drum beat samples. Russell suggested that Linn also add longer-length loops as well as sampled hand claps, explaining a recording session that included clapping quickly becomes a burden for performers during multiple takes. Russell used Linn&#x27;s drum machine for all of the percussion on his &quot;Life and Love&quot; album.

In 1984 Linn created the pressure sensitive Linn9000 drum machine and credited Russell with the inspiration to add &quot;sloppy&quot; or shuffle timing. Linn said, &quot;It was Leon who taught me about swing timing, which he called &#x27;shuffle&#x27;. He explained that one of the big factors in a drummer’s feel was the degree of shuffle timing in his playing... I added the code to delay—by a variable amount... This allowed me to dial in the exact groove I wanted&quot;.

===Paradise Records===
Russell departed Shelter Records in 1976 to start his own record label, Paradise Records.

===Paradise Studios===
Russell built and owned Paradise Studios in Burbank, California; the recording studio had two audio sound stages and a television production stage. The studio complex also had a mobile audio recording bus and a remote television production bus which supported the stages or could travel. Paradise Records was headquartered at the studio. The studio aired a weekly live television music show &quot;New Wave Theatre&quot; shown on the USA cable network. The studio was used to make music videos for James Taylor and Randy Meisner and also long format videos for Willie Nelson, J.J. Cale, Bonnie Raitt, and Russell.

Continuing with a country theme he made a second Hank Wilson album, &quot;Hank Wilson, Vol. II&quot; released in 1984, Hank Wilson being Russell&#x27;s self-styled country music alter-ego since the early 1970s. It was released on Leon Russell Records. Russell released a country blues album, recorded in Hendersonville, Tennessee at his Paradise Studios, called &quot;Solid State&quot;. It was released by Paradise Music in 1984.

==2010s - Sixth Gold album, failing health==
On January 31, 2010, Russell joined the Zac Brown Band to play the song &quot;Chicken Fried&quot; at the Grammy Awards. Zac Brown Band won the Best New Artist award. After years of reduced prominence, Russell&#x27;s career was rejuvenated when Elton John sought him for a new project. In November 2009, Russell worked with John and Bernie Taupin on &quot;The Union&quot;, a double album record credited equally to Russell and John. Recorded in February 2010 and produced by T Bone Burnett, the CD was released on October 19, 2010.

&quot;The Union&quot; was Russell&#x27;s sixth gold album. The recordings were interrupted in January 2010 when Russell was hospitalized and underwent surgery for a brain fluid leak, as well as treatment for heart failure and pneumonia. A couple of months later, Russell announced plans for a solo LP, although no specifics were given, and in October 2010 Russell and John embarked on The Union Tour. John and Russell also appeared on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;.

Russell and John were nominated for their track “If It Wasn&#x27;t for Bad&quot;, from their &quot;The Union&quot; album, for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 2010 Grammy Awards, which were presented on February 13, 2011. In 2011, the documentary film &quot;The Union&quot; by Cameron Crowe was released. It explored the creative process of John and Russell in the making of the 2010 album &quot;The Union&quot;. On April 2, 2011, Russell and John performed together as the musical guests on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed the album in third place on its list of the 30 Best Albums of 2010.

In 2012, Russell and Vince Gill sang the song &quot;A Way to Survive&quot; on the &quot;Living for a Song: A Tribute to Hank Cochran&quot; studio album by Jamey Johnson. Russell played in Willie Nelson&#x27;s Fourth of July Picnic in Fort Worth, Texas, in 2013. He had first played at the picnic in 1973. On June 23, 2013, Russell performed on the CMT Crossroads broadcast with Willie Nelson, Sheryl Crow, Jamey Johnson, Norah Jones, Ashley Monroe and Neil Young.

In 2014, the album &quot;Life Journey&quot; was released on Universal Records. Working with Tommy LiPuma, this album included two new songs by Russell: &quot;Big Lips&quot; and &quot;Down in Dixieland&quot;. On March 16, 2015, a restored version of a previously unreleased 1974 documentary about Russell, &quot;A Poem Is a Naked Person&quot; by filmmaker Les Blank, was screened at the South by Southwest Film Festival. The film features concert footage of Russell in New Orleans and Anaheim and of the recording sessions for the album &quot;Hank Wilson&#x27;s Back&quot;. In 2015, Russell played at Virginia&#x27;s Lockn&#x27; Festival and the Wildflower! Arts and Music Festival in Richardson, Texas.

On May 30, 2015, Russell, Bonnie Raitt and Ivan Neville gave a performance at The Canyon Club in Agoura Hills, California to raise money for Marty Grebb who was battling cancer. Grebb had played on some of their albums. On September 11, 2015, he joined Rita Coolidge, Claudia Lennear, Chris Stainton, and other members of the 1970 &quot;Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen Tour&quot; for a tribute concert to Joe Cocker organized by the Tedeschi Trucks Band. Original tour photographer Linda Wolf documented the reunion and performance.

Russell had a nationwide concert tour in 2016 and was planning to tour into 2017. The album &quot;On a Distant Shore&quot;, recorded in 2016, was posthumously released in September 2017. The album has 12 songs written by Russell. Two of his daughters, Coco Bridges and Sugaree Noel Bridges, perform backing vocals on it.

==Failing health and death==

In 2010, Russell had surgery for cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhoea and was treated for heart failure. In July 2016, he suffered a heart attack and underwent heart bypass surgery. He died in his sleep at his Mount Juliet, Tennessee home on November 13, 2016, at the age of 74.

Russell&#x27;s funeral was on November 18 at Victory Baptist Church in Mt. Juliet, and a public memorial was held at The Oral Roberts University Mabee Center on November 20 in Tulsa. His body is interred at Memorial Park Cemetery in Tulsa.

==Musical influence==
Russell&#x27;s music style encompassed rock, country, gospel, bluegrass, rhythm and blues, southern rock, blues rock, rock and roll, folk, surf, swamp rock, and Tulsa sound.

Elton John, who had once been Russell&#x27;s opening act, acknowledged him as his &quot;biggest influence as a piano player, a singer and a songwriter.&quot; After hearing of Russell&#x27;s death he said: &quot;My darling Leon Russell passed away last night. He was a mentor, inspiration and so kind to me. I loved him and always will.&quot; John once recalled:
Pixies vocalist Black Francis credits Russell with influencing his vocal style: &quot;I realise there&#x27;s a certain kind of vocalising I do that takes its cue from Leon Russell. He sang in a Southern accent but it was very blown-out and exaggerated, very free and loose.&quot; One of Russell&#x27;s titles and signature nicknames is &quot;Master of Space and Time&quot;.

The depth and scope of Russell&#x27;s contribution to the music of the twentieth century is illustrated by:

<text>Queensborough Bridge is a highway bridge in New Westminster, British Columbia. It was built in 1960 by John Laing and Son (Canada) for the City of New Westminster and cost $4 million (equivalent to $37.5 million in 2022). The bridge spans the north arm of the Fraser River for road access from the main part of New Westminster to the suburb of Queensborough at the east end of Lulu Island, giving the bridge its name. 

It has since become a part of Highway 91A feeder to Highway 91 to the south. The Queensborough was a toll bridge costing 25 cents to cross until the bridge was bought by the provincial government in November 1966. The last person to pay the toll was then Premier W. A. C. Bennett, who paid 25 cents at 12:01 AM on Sunday, November 19, 1966. 
Six spans of the bridge were demolished and replaced in 1984 and 1985 to allow for a curve alignment on its southern approach to Queensborough Connector. In 2003, some adjustments were made to the approach from the New Westminster side. Later in 2009, the interchange with Marine Way and Stewardson Way saw improving, including the trumpet loop being flipped to its current rotation.

<text>Tad (often styled as TAD) was an American rock band from Seattle, Washington, formed in 1988 by Tad Doyle. They are often recognized as one of the first bands of the grunge era.

==History==
===Formation and Sub Pop years (1988–1991)===
Tad was originally formed as a solo project of Tad Doyle (born Thomas Andrew Doyle), former drummer of the band H-Hour, in early 1988 with Tad singing and playing all instruments (guitar, bass and drums), recording a 3-songs demo that later became a &quot;Daisy / Ritual Device&quot; single. Tad was among the first bands to be signed to the independent label Sub Pop Records. In 1988, Doyle had released the &quot;Daisy/Ritual Device&quot; single on Sub Pop, produced by seminal Seattle producer Jack Endino, for which Doyle wrote and performed all the music. Soon after Tad Doyle realized that he needed a full band - and asked bassist Kurt Danielson to play bass for the band. Danielson&#x27;s band Bundle of Hiss played with Doyle&#x27;s previous band H-Hour. Doyle recruited drummer Steve Wied (formerly of Skin Yard) and guitarist Gary Thorstensen to complete the full line-up. Tad&#x27;s debut album &quot;God&#x27;s Balls&quot; appeared in early 1989, and was also produced by Endino. In March 1990, the band released &quot;Salt Lick&quot;, recorded by Steve Albini. The vinyl was a six-track EP and it was later expanded into a full-length with nine tracks once it was issued on CD. It contained the song &quot;Wood Goblins&quot;, for which a music video was produced. After a European tour with Nirvana, Tad returned to Seattle and recorded their third album &quot;8-Way Santa&quot; (1991), named after a type of blotter acid. Produced by Butch Vig, the album was far more pop-oriented than its predecessors, and featured the singles &quot;Jinx&quot; and &quot;Jack Pepsi&quot;. 

&quot;Jack Pepsi&quot; was released as a single, but Pepsi filed a lawsuit against the band due to the cover art on the single, which was the Pepsi logo with &quot;Tad&quot; in place of &quot;PEPSI&quot;. Another lawsuit was filed due to the cover of &quot;8-Way Santa&quot; (which was a found picture of a man fondling a woman&#x27;s breast). The couple in the photograph, one of whom had since become a born-again Christian and remarried, took exception and sued. Sub Pop subsequently changed the album cover to a shot of the band.

===Major label years, turmoil and breakup (1992–1999)===
After a very brief acting stint in &quot;Singles&quot;, Tad was offered its first major-label opportunity by Warner Music Group&#x27;s Giant Records. However, Steve Wied had left, joining Willard, and later Foil. Rey Washam (formerly of Scratch Acid) briefly filled on drums in 1991, but was later replaced by Josh Sinder, previously of The Accüsed. Sinder debuted with Tad on their last Sub Pop release, the &quot;Salem&quot; / &quot;Leper&quot; single (which featured &quot;Mud-Man&quot;, Josh&#x27;s apparently mumps-afflicted brother, on the cover). Their major label debut, &quot;Inhaler&quot;, appeared later in the year to positive reviews. The record failed to break the band, however, they were chosen to open for Soundgarden on their 1994 &quot;Superunknown&quot; tour. Giant Records dropped the band when a poster promoting &quot;Inhaler&quot; surfaced featuring Bill Clinton smoking a joint with the caption reading &quot;It&#x27;s heavy shit&quot;.

In 1995, the band released &quot;Live Alien Broadcasts&quot; on Futurist Records, which was a best-of live studio recording. Thorstensen left the band but Tad secured a second major-label deal with East West/Elektra Records, another Warner label, in 1995. The same year, they released their final album &quot;Infrared Riding Hood&quot;. However, within a month of the release, the band&#x27;s A&amp;R representative was fired. As a result of that representative&#x27;s termination, all of their signed bands were released and their albums ceased production, regardless of content. They continued to gig for the remainder of the year before Sinder left to form the Hot Rod Lunatics. He was replaced on drums by Mike Mongrain of Foil. Tad&#x27;s final single &quot;Oppenheimer&#x27;s Pretty Nightmare&quot; / &quot;Accident on the Way to Church&quot; appeared in 1998 on Up Records. A year later, the band dissolved.

===Post-breakup (2000–2012)===
Following Tad&#x27;s breakup, Doyle formed Hog Molly in 2001 with Willard bassist Ty Garcia and 50 Paces guitarist Martin Chandler, releasing the album &quot;Kung-Fu Cocktail Grip&quot; late the same year. Willard guitarist Mark Spiders had recommended Ty, and Martin in a conversation with Doyle. Hog Molly then broke up and its members other than Doyle formed a band called The Ones. Chandler would later go on to join The Supersuckers in 2009.

Doyle later formed the band Hoof. His other band Brothers of the Sonic Cloth has been playing in Seattle night clubs. Kurt Danielson went on to form Valis, a project that included members of Screaming Trees and Mudhoney. He also formed The Quaranteens, a post-punk/new wave band with Craig Paul, before moving to France. He is back in Seattle since 2008, and has started to write a novel. Danielson has also played in other local Seattle-based bands including Misericords (with fellow ex-Tad member Mike Mongrain on drums) and Vaporland (featuring ex members of Love Battery and The Fluid). Josh Sinder has gone on to play drums in The Insurgence and also plays with Marky Felchtone from Zeke in new band Hellbound For Glory.

A documentary of the band titled &quot;Busted Circuits and Ringing Ears&quot; was released in February 2008. In July 2009, taddoyle.com announced plans by Brothers of the Sonic Cloth to release a split 10&quot; vinyl record with Seattle-area sludge metal band, Mico de Noche. The Brothers of the Sonic Cloth/Mico de Noche split 10&quot; vinyl record was released in October 2009 as an edition of 500 copies and featured two songs by Mico de Noche and one song by Brothers of the Sonic Cloth, &quot;Fires Burn Dim in the Shadows of the Mountain&quot;. The record received several positive reviews and appeared on &quot;Seattle Weekly&quot;&#x27;s list of that year&#x27;s best local releases.

In 2009, Tad Doyle performed with the members of Soundgarden and Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine in Seattle. Chris Cornell, the original singer, was not present and Doyle took on vocal duties. This marked the first performance by Soundgarden in over a decade.

===Partial reunion and aftermath (2013–present)===
A semi-reunion of Tad took place at the Sub Pop Records 25th anniversary show on July 13, 2013 in Seattle, Washington. There, Tad Doyle and Gary Thorstensen joined Brothers of the Sonic Cloth to play a set of songs from &quot;God&#x27;s Balls&quot;, &quot;Salt Lick&quot; and &quot;8-Way Santa&quot;.

Kurt Danielson went on to play with Ron Nine and Kevin Whitworth (Love Battery) and Garret Shavlik (ex-the Fluid) for a self-produced album, &quot;Vaporland&quot;, in 2014. He and Ron Nine then played in Purple Strange with Jared Stroud, Matthew Candenberghe and Jack Endino, and issued another self-produced album of the same name in 2021.

A vinyl-only archival album, &quot;Quick and Dirty&quot;, was released in April 2018 as part of Record Store Day, and contains rare and unreleased tracks Tad recorded between 1995 and 1999.

<doc id="820904" wikidata="Q709811" url="?curid=820904" title="Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul 15 BC)">
<text>Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (48 BC – AD 32) was a prominent Roman senator of the early Empire. His tenure as pontifex led him sometimes to be called Lucius Calpurnius Piso Pontifex, to differentiate him from his contemporary, Lucius Calpurnius Piso the Augur, consul in 1 BC. He was a confidant of the emperors Augustus and Tiberius.

==Biography==
He was the son of Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, consul in 58 BC, and half-brother of Calpurnia, the third and last wife of Julius Caesar.

Piso was consul in 15 BC, and shortly thereafter engaged in Mediolanum as proconsul. Cassius Dio refers to him as governor of Pamphylia in the years 13 to 11 BC; his province probably included Galatia. In 11 BC, he was sent to Thrace as legatus &quot;pro praetore&quot; in order to put down a revolt. For his successes there, the senate honoured him with the ornamenta triumphalia.

Piso may have also been proconsul of Asia and legate of Syria, but this is disputed. He was &quot;praefectus urbi&quot; from AD 13 to 32, and a trusted adviser to both Augustus and Tiberius. He was a member of the pontifical college and of the Arval Brethren. He died in 32, and was honoured with a state funeral.

Piso&#x27;s achievements and independence were highly regarded. Horace dedicated his &quot;Ars Poëtica&quot; to him (cf. &quot;Carmen&quot; 2.12), and several epigrams by Antipater of Thessalonica are dedicated to Piso.

==Name==
Piso&#x27;s full nomenclature is somewhat uncertain. Tacitus simply refers to him as &quot;Lucius Piso&quot;, while the &quot;Fasti Albenses&quot; call him &quot;Lucius Calpurnius Piso&quot;. He is sometimes called &quot;Lucius Calpurnius Piso Pontifex&quot;, to distinguish him from his contemporary, &quot;Lucius Calpurnius Piso Augur&quot;, although both &quot;Pontifex&quot; and &quot;Augur&quot; are simply nicknames, rather than true cognomina. Drumann assigned Piso the agnomen &quot;Caesoninus&quot;, which had been borne by his ancestors for four generations; but in later editions he is assigned the name &quot;Frugi&quot; instead. There are two grounds for the latter identification. First, Cassius Dio assigns him the surname &quot;Fourtios&quot;, which is supposed to be a corruption of &quot;Frugi&quot;. Secondly, Theodor Mommsen identified his sons, to whom the &quot;Ars Poëtica&quot; is addressed, with Lucius Calpurnius Piso and Marcus Licinius Crassus Frugi, consuls in AD 27.

However, Klebs doubted this interpretation of &quot;Fourtios&quot;, and it is not at all certain that the consuls of AD 27 were the sons of Lucius Calpurnius Piso Pontifex. They might instead have been the sons of Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, consul in 7 BC. In this instance, Marcus Licinius Crassus Frugi would be identified with the Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso whom the senate compelled to change his praenomen. As a result, the question of whether Piso the pontifex was surnamed &quot;Caesoninus&quot; or &quot;Frugi&quot; is unresolved.

<doc id="820919" wikidata="Q1474279" url="?curid=820919" title="Spies Like Us">
<text>Spies Like Us is a 1985 American spy comedy film directed by John Landis, and starring Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd, Steve Forrest, and Donna Dixon. The film presents the comic adventures of two novice intelligence agents sent to the Soviet Union. Originally written by Aykroyd and Dave Thomas to star Aykroyd and John Belushi at Universal, the script went into turnaround following Belushi&#x27;s 1982 death and was later picked up by Warner Bros., starring Aykroyd and Chase.

Partly filmed on location near Sognefjord in Norway (as Russia) and the Sahara (as Pakistan), the film is a homage to the famous Bob Hope and Bing Crosby &quot;Road to...&quot; film series. Hope himself cameos in one scene. Other cameos include directors Terry Gilliam, Sam Raimi, Costa-Gavras, Martin Brest, Frank Oz, and Joel Coen, musician B. B. King and visual effects pioneer Ray Harryhausen. Although contemporary reviews of the film were largely negative, &quot;Spies Like Us&quot; was a financial success, grossing $77 million.

==Plot==
Austin Millbarge is a code breaker dwelling in the dark basement at the Pentagon who aspires to escape his under-respected job to become a secret agent. Emmett Fitz-Hume, a wisecracking, pencil-pushing son of an envoy, takes the foreign service exam under peer pressure. Millbarge and Fitz-Hume meet during the test, on which Fitz-Hume openly cheats after his attempts to bribe his female supervisor and the test monitor in exchange for the answers both fail. Millbarge was not prepared to take the test, having had only one night to study after his supervisor deliberately withheld a two-weeks notice for the exam, leaving him vulnerable to fail and having to remain in the bowels of the Pentagon.

Needing two expendable covert agents to act as decoys to draw attention away from a more capable team, Ruby and Keyes of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) decide to enlist Fitz-Hume and Millbarge, promote them to GLG-20 Foreign Service Operatives, rush them through minimal military survival training, and then send them on an undefined mission inside Pakistan and Soviet Central Asia. Meanwhile, the two professional agents are well on their way to carry out the actual objective: the seizure of a mobile SS-50 ICBM launcher in Soviet territory. A member of the main team is killed, while Millbarge and Fitz-Hume manage to escape multiple enemy attacks and eventually encounter Karen Boyer, the surviving operative from the main team.

In the Pamir Mountains of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic, the trio disguises themselves in hastily constructed extraterrestrial outfits and tranquilizes the mobile missile guard unit. Following orders in real-time from the intelligence agency (operating from the W.A.M.P. military bunker located deep under an abandoned drive-in theater in Nevada), they begin to operate the launcher. At the end of their instructions, the vehicle launches the ICBM into space, targeting an unspecified area in the Continental United States. Thinking they have started a nuclear war, the American agents and their Soviet counterparts pair up to have sex before the world is destroyed.

Meanwhile, Ruby and Keyes have joined Generals Sline and Miegs, the two military commanders at W.A.M.P., in the operations bunker. They initiate the conversion of the drive-in theater to expose what is hidden beneath the screens and projection booth: a huge black-op SDI-esque laser and collector/emitter screen. The purpose of sending the agents to launch a Soviet ICBM is exposed as a means to test this anti-ballistic missile system, but the laser malfunctions and fails to intercept the missile. Despite this, Sline and Miegs choose not to inform the President and the US Government that the missile launch was not a nuclear attack initiated by the Soviet Union, revealing to the horrified Ruby and Keyes, a twisted contingency plan of letting the impending thermonuclear war commence to &quot;preserve the American way of life&quot;.

Back in the Soviet Union, horrified at the thought of having launched a nuclear missile at their own country, Milbarge realizes that the missile can be diverted. The American spies and Soviet technicians quickly use Millbarge&#x27;s knowledge of missile guidance systems to transmit instructions that deflect the missile off into space where it harmlessly detonates. Immediately after, the underground W.A.M.P. bunker is located and stormed by U.S. Army Rangers, Ruby, Keyes and the rogue military officials involved in the unauthorized covert operation are all arrested. Millbarge, Fitz-Hume, and Boyer go on to become nuclear disarmament negotiators, playing a nuclear version of &quot;Risk&quot;-meets-&quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot; against their new Soviet friends.

==Cast==
Other actors making appearances in minor roles include Jeff Harding as Fitz-Hume&#x27;s state department colleague and Heidi Sorenson as Alice, Fitz-Hume&#x27;s supervisor. Also making cameo appearances are special effects designer Derek Meddings as Dr. Stinson, directors Joel Coen, Sam Raimi, and Martin Brest as the drive-in security, comedian Bob Hope as himself, musician B. B. King and directors Michael Apted and Larry Cohen as the Ace Tomato agents, and NBC newscaster Edwin Newman as himself.

==Title song==
The title song, &quot;Spies Like Us&quot;, was written and performed by Paul McCartney. The recording peaked at #7 on the singles chart in the United States in early 1986; The song was McCartney&#x27;s last to reach the top ten in the US until 2015. It also reached #13 in the UK. John Landis directed a music video for the song where Aykroyd and Chase are seen in a recording studio, performing the song with McCartney (although they didn&#x27;t actually play on the record).

Landis has stated that he feels &quot;Spies Like Us&quot; is &quot;a terrible song&quot; but he couldn&#x27;t say no to McCartney and Warner Bros.

==Soundtrack==
The film&#x27;s score was composed by Elmer Bernstein and performed by the Graunke Symphony Orchestra, conducted by the composer. The soundtrack album was released by Varèse Sarabande; it does not contain the Paul McCartney song. The film also features &quot;Soul Finger&quot; by the Bar-Kays, also absent from the soundtrack. In an early scene, Fitz-Hume watches Ronald Reagan, Virginia Mayo and Gene Nelson sing &quot;I&#x27;ll Still be Loving You&quot; in the 1952 film musical &quot;She&#x27;s Working Her Way Through College&quot;.

==Release==
The film had its world premiere on December 3, 1985 for the Variety Club of Southern California and the Will Rogers Institute. 
===Box office===
&quot;Spies Like Us&quot; grossed $8.6 million on its US opening weekend and ultimately grossed $60 million in the United States and Canada against a budget of $22 million. The film grossed $17.2 million overseas for a worldwide total of $77.3 million.

===Critical reception===
The &quot;Washington Post&quot; critic Paul Attanasio called &quot;Spies Like Us&quot; &quot;a comedy with exactly one laugh, and those among you given to Easter egg hunts may feel free to try and find it&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; critic Dave Kehr criticized the character development, saying that &quot;Landis never bothers to account for the friendship that springs up spontaneously between these two antipathetic types, but then he never bothers to account for anything in this loose progression of recycled Abbott and Costello riffs&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Janet Maslin wrote: &quot;The stars are always affable, and they&#x27;re worth watching even when they do very little, but it&#x27;s painful to sit by as the screenplay runs out of steam.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; magazine opined in a staff review: &quot;&quot;Spies&quot; is not very amusing. Though Chase and Aykroyd provide moments, the overall script thinly takes on eccentric espionage and nuclear madness, with nothing new to add.&quot; &quot;TV Guide&quot; published a staff review, stating: &quot;Landis&#x27; direction is indulgent, to say the least, with big landscapes, big crashes, big hardware, and big gags filling the screen. What he forgets is character development, that all-important factor that must exist for comedy to work well.&quot; David Parkinson, writing for the &quot;Radio Times&quot;, felt that &quot;Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase simply fail to gel, and there&#x27;s little fun to be had once the boisterous training school gags are exhausted.&quot;

Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes shows a score of 35% based on 26 reviews and an average rating of 4.5/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Despite the comedic prowess of its director and two leads, &quot;Spies Like Us&quot; appears to disavow all knowledge of how to make the viewer laugh.&quot; Metacritic displays a score of 22 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Writing for Common Sense Media, Andrea Beach called the film a &quot;dated &#x27;80s comedy [with] strong language, few laughs&quot;. Collider staff writer Jeff Giles, reviewing the film&#x27;s Blu-ray release, stated: &quot;on the whole, it’s more amusing than funny; it’s only 102 minutes, but it feels too long by half. For all the talent involved, there’s an awful lot of flab. It’s the kind of movie you can walk away from for 10 minutes without missing anything important.&quot;

==Legacy==
Animated sitcom &quot;Family Guy&quot; paid tribute to the film with its 2009 episode &quot;Spies Reminiscent of Us&quot;, which guest starred Aykroyd and Chase as fictionalized versions of themselves who, according to the series, were made real spies by Ronald Reagan after he saw the film. The episode recreates numerous scenes.

<text>La Bombonera (; ), oficially named Alberto José Armando Stadium (; ) is an association football stadium located in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

The stadium is owned by Boca Juniors, a professional sports club based in the La Boca neighbourhood and one of Argentina&#x27;s premier teams, which has over 18 million fans, the most in Argentina and around 40% of the country&#x27;s total population. The unusual shape of the stadium has led to it having excellent acoustics and the Boca support being nicknamed &quot;La Doce&quot;. The pitch at La Bombonera is 105m × 68m.

In 1986, the stadium was officially named for the first time as &quot;Dr. Camilo Cichero,&quot; in honor of the club president who championed its construction. In 2000, it was renamed after Alberto José Armando, a two-time president of Boca Juniors. However, it is more commonly known as &quot;La Bombonera&quot; (The Chocolate Box), a name inspired by a personal anecdote from its architect, Viktor Sulčič, who likened the stadium&#x27;s structure to that of a box of chocolates.

The stadium is widely regarded as one of the most iconic stadiums in the world due to its design, club&#x27;s history, iconic matches, intense atmosphere and tales of legendary players that stepped onto the pitch like Diego Maradona, Lionel Messi, Alfredo Di Stefano, Pelé, Ronaldo, Romario, Mario Kempes, Juan Román Riquelme, Gabriel Batistuta, Edinson Cavani and more. It has been declared of public interest by the government of Buenos Aires, the autonomous capital city. The stadium is also used as a concert venue. Past performers at &quot;La Bombonera&quot; have included Lenny Kravitz, Elton John, James Blunt, the Bee Gees, and the Backstreet Boys.

==History==

===Background===

In 1921, following several years of financial difficulties and lack of funds, Boca Juniors put out a fundraising drive to raise money for their next stadium. The drive was successful, with Boca raising enough money to initially rent, then buy, a new stadium. The land they chose, which would become &quot;La Bombonera&quot;, was owned by Ferro Carril del Sud, which was originally used as a shunting yard, giving them a home for the foreseeable future. The land was also close to railway lines that led out of the city.

Prior to &quot;La Bombonera&quot;, Boca Juniors had used several locations before settling on their current ground on Brandsen. The club&#x27;s first ground had been located in &quot;Dársena Sur&quot; of the old Buenos Aires port (currently Puerto Madero) and &quot;Isla Demarchi&quot; before moving to Brandsen and Del Crucero (currently Del Valle Iberlucea) streets in 1924. The club built a stadium there. This would be their home venue until the construction of &quot;La Bombonera&quot; at the same location.

In 1931, Boca Juniors&#x27; steering committee (led by president Ruperto Molfino) acquired the lands from the Municipality of Buenos Aires for A$ 2,200,000. Three years later, the club published a call for tenders to build its new stadium. The project was finally granted to the Delpini-Sulcic-Bes architectural office, which would also design Abasto Shopping in the 1990s.

The old stadium (still with wooden grandstands) was used for the last time on April 10, 1938, before being demolished to build the new stadium at the same location. While &quot;La Bombonera&quot; was under construction, Boca Juniors played their home games at the Ferro Carril Oeste stadium.

===Opening and later refurbishments===

The stadium finally opened on May 25, 1940, with a friendly match between Boca and San Lorenzo, which the home side won 2–0 with both goals scored by Ricardo Alarcón. Due to the fact that the stadium did not have a lighting system, the game only lasted 70&#x27; (two halves of 35&#x27; each).

The first official game at the new stadium was on June 2, 1940, when Boca Juniors beat Newell&#x27;s Old Boys 2–0. Ricardo Alarcón (who had scored in the opening game v. San Lorenzo) scored the first official goal at the new venue.
After the stadium was inaugurated, the club continued to introduce refurbishments to expand its capacity. As a result, on November 16, 1941, a second tier was opened on the north side of the stadium, near Casa Amarilla train station. The grandstand was named &quot;Natalio Pescia&quot; in honour of one of the key players in Boca Juniors&#x27; history. In 1949, the club decided to add a third tier, as well as a lighting system. All of those works were completed in 1953; this third tier gave the stadium its enduring nickname, &quot;La Bombonera&quot;. Boca Juniors celebrated with a friendly match vs. Yugoslav club NK Hajduk Split, which ended 1-1.
The stadium was named on April 20, 1986, by team President Antonio Alegre in honor of Camilo Cichero, a former team president under whose tenure work on &quot;La Bombonera&quot; began. It was renamed on December 27, 2000, by team President Mauricio Macri in honor of Alberto Armando, team president during its resurgence during the 1960s as well as a former business partner of his father Francisco Macri. The stadium was expanded and modernized during Macri&#x27;s tenure, notably with the addition in 1996 of a fourth tier; and a wing housing a press area, VIP boxes, a museum, and offices. The stadium&#x27;s exterior was later decorated with works by painters Rómulo Macció and Pérez Celis.

Since then, &quot;La Bombonera&quot; was not remodeled until 1996 when the presidency of Mauricio Macri decided to expand its capacity to 57,500 spectators. Works included the demolition of the lateral boxes on Del Valle Iberlucea street, replacing them by a small stand and new and modern boxes (with metallic structure) placed over there. The &quot;new&quot; Bombonera was reinaugurated with a friendly match v. Club Universidad de Chile won by Boca Juniors by 3–1.

An electronic screen was installed in 2008, making Boca Juniors&#x27; stadium the third venue in Argentina with this technology, after the stadiums of Vélez Sársfield and River Plate. At the beginning of 2012, more than 500 seats were replaced and other 500 were added, part of the building of four additional boxes.

=== Character ===
The stadium is notable for the artwork and murals both inside and around the stadium. One of the murals inside the stadium honors the different divisions within the club and many of the clubs legendary players and figures, including Diego Maradona. The mural is made of tile painted blue and yellow and metal busts and sculptures. Several murals outside the stadium depict the lives of residents of La Boca, usually dockworkers, and people wearing Boca Juniors jerseys and apparel.

The stadium is noted for its tendency to shake with heavy fan activity during matches. According to writer Christopher Thomas Gaffney, “La Bombonera does not shake, it beats.” The stadium is also renowned for its location within La Boca, with spectators able to see the dockyards on the Atlantic coast from the highest reaches of the stadium. The stadium is one of many in the city proper of Buenos Aires, with football stadiums far outnumbering other sporting grounds, such as polo grounds and race tracks.

==Origin of the name==
The stadium is popularly known as &quot;La Bombonera&quot;. It is said that the nickname came about while architect Viktor Sulčič was designing the stadium. On occasion of Sulčič&#x27;s birthday, a friend gave him a box of chocolates as a gift. After that, Sulčič used to take the box to project meetings with engineer Delpine and other persons that he collaborated with the project to show them that the box shape was very like the stadium they were designing. Since then, the stadium would be known as &quot;La Bombonera&quot; (&quot;box of chocolates&quot; in Spanish) and that name has remained to present days. In fact, the opening day (May 25, 1940) the stadium was named that way even by the club executives.

There are other stories or myths about the origin of the nickname. One of them tells that Delpini projected the stands with a highly vertical grade of inclination to host 100,000 persons (which was the first project). The shape of the stands looked like the carts used to collect horses dung in the streets of Buenos Aires. Other version credits journalist Hugo Marini or broadcaster Joaquín Carballo Serantes (aka) &quot;Fioravanti&quot; for the &quot;Bombonera&quot; nickname.

Despite its distinguished nickname, the first official denomination came on April 20, 1986, when it was named &quot;Camilo Cichero&quot; in commemoration of the president under whose tenure the stadium was projected and built. That same day Boca Juniors defeated Talleres de Córdoba by 4–2. Nevertheless, president Mauricio Macri decided to change the stadium&#x27;s name to &quot;Alberto J. Armando&quot;, honoring long-time president of the club during two periods (1954–55, 1960–80).

==Facilities==

La Bombonera currently has a capacity of around 57,200, and the club&#x27;s popularity makes tickets hard to find, especially for the Superclásico derby against River Plate.

Out of its capacity of 49,000, there are 37,538 seats, 2,780 in boxes, and 8,682 standing. Both its interior and exterior are lined with a number of murals painted by the artist Pérez Celis depicting many of the club&#x27;s legendary players and aspects of the district&#x27;s culture, such as the lives of Italian immigrants.

In 1996, a small stand was built on the 4th side, which had been largely open until then, except for some VIP boxes.

Diego Maradona, who played for and supported Boca Juniors, had his own executive box at the stadium.

There are three parking lots at the stadium for members.

==Argentina national team on La Bombonera==
The national team has played several games in La Bombonera, including qualifying matches to the FIFA World Cup. The squad played the most games since the 1920s to the mid-1970s. Since the &quot;Estadio Monumental&quot; of River Plate was completely refurbished for the 1978 WC, the Argentine Football Association fixtured the majority of Argentina&#x27;s home games at that venue. That decision was based on the &quot;Monumental&quot; higher capacity and modern facilities in comparison with La Bombonera.

Playing at Boca Juniors Stadium, Argentina was only defeated in two games, having played a total of 27 matches, winning 18 and losing 2 with 7 ties. The squad scored 67 goals and only conceded 27. Some of the official and friendly games played by Argentina at the stadium (as of 14 November 2024) are listed below:

==Boca Museum==

The Passion of Boca Juniors Museum () was opened in 2001 during Mauricio Macri&#x27;s administration. It is located within the stadium, just below the grandstands. The museum was built on two floors and chronicles the club&#x27;s rise from 1905 (the year the club was established) to the present day.

One of the exhibits in the museum is a giant football with 360-degree footage of the club&#x27;s fans and players at a match. The museum also includes a Hall of fame and a large mural of Diego Maradona. Also included are non-football items, such as the specially commissioned blue and gold guitar played by Lenny Kravitz when he performed at La Bombonera in 2005.

A giant statue of Boca Juniors&#x27; all-time top scorer, Martín Palermo, was unveiled in 2011. Other former players who have statues honoring them are Diego Maradona and Román Riquelme A total of seven Boca Juniors idols have been honored by the club with their respective monuments; they are Guillermo Barros Schelotto, Angel Clemente Rojas, Silvio Marzolini and Antonio Rattín, apart from Maradona, Palermo, and Riquelme.

Carlos Bianchi was the first Boca Juniors manager to be honored with a statue when a monument to his figure was unveiled in October 2016. Bianchi won nine titles during his two tenures at the club (1998–2003), becoming the most winning manager in Boca Juniors&#x27; history. Under Bianchi&#x27;s coaching, the team also set a record of 40 matches unbeaten, the biggest since Argentine football became professional in 1931.

==Redevelopment==
There are planned improvements for the stadium, including measures to ease crowd congestion, the use of new technology in the stadium, and improved corporate facilities. These include:

*Main gate, museum, and megastore: Work is planned to be done on the main access to the stadium at 805 Brandsen, which will include the construction of a megastore, and to then connect the main access with the store and the club&#x27;s museum.
*Third tier: remodeling work to install further seating and improve spectator comfort.
*Stadium gates: Building work to improve access and prevent crowd congestion is underway. The first phase focuses on improving access to the executive boxes and premium seats. In addition, new software and hardware will improve access control with regard to safety and quickness to prevent crowd congestion.
*Creation of a corporate area: Businesses will have an area in the stadium with VIP service. One section in the second tier is being redesigned with two executive boxes and more comfortable seating. The service will also provide businesses with season tickets to allow them to invite clients. It also includes transportation, museum visits, and catering services.

==In film==
*Some scenes of the 1969 film &quot;Invasión&quot; were shot in the deserted stadium.
*The Danish film &quot;SuperClásico&quot;, has a part filmed in the stadium.
*The Hong Kong film &quot;Happy Together&quot;, has a part filmed in the stadium.

<text>LeVert was an American R&amp;B vocal group from Cleveland, Ohio, United States. Formed in 1983, LeVert was composed of Sean and Gerald Levert (sons of Eddie Levert, founder and lead singer of R&amp;B/Soul vocal group O&#x27;Jays) and Marc Gordon.

==Biography==
The group released their first single, &quot;I&#x27;m Still&quot;, for Harry Coombes&#x27;s Tempre label. In 1985, they released their debut album, &quot;I Get Hot&quot;, which included tracks whose vocals drew strong comparisons to Sean and Gerald Levert&#x27;s father Eddie. &quot;Bloodline&quot; followed in 1986, and this album included the band&#x27;s first big R&amp;B hit &quot;(Pop, Pop, Pop, Pop) Goes My Mind&quot;, a track that went all the way to Number One. However, the band&#x27;s next album, 1987&#x27;s &quot;The Big Throwdown&quot; became an even bigger success, on the strength of the Number One R&amp;B hit &quot;Casanova&quot;, which gave them a crossover hit on the pop chart (number 5) and also a UK Top 10.

A pair of additional R&amp;B Top Five singles were also released from this album: &quot;My Forever Love&quot; and &quot;Sweet Sensation&quot;. The band&#x27;s success continued with their 1988 follow-up album &quot;Just Coolin&#x27;&quot;, which was nominated for Best R&amp;B/Urban Contemporary Album for the 1989 Soul Train Music Awards. Both &quot;The Big Throwdown&quot; and &quot;Just Coolin&quot;&#x27; received gold certification. Beginning in the 1990s, Gerald began dividing his time between LeVert, and his solo career, but the band went on to release three more albums, and Rhino Records released a greatest hits album in 2001.

Gerald Levert died of a prescription and over the counter drug overdose in November 2006. Sean Levert died in March 2008 from a combination of sarcoidosis and xanax withdrawal while in the Cuyahoga County jail.

<doc id="820953" wikidata="Q1442923" url="?curid=820953" title="Malabsorption">
<text>Malabsorption is a state arising from abnormality in absorption of food nutrients across the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Impairment can be of single or multiple nutrients depending on the abnormality. This may lead to malnutrition and a variety of anaemias.

Normally the human gastrointestinal tract digests and absorbs dietary nutrients with remarkable efficiency. A typical Western diet ingested by an adult in one day includes approximately 100 g of fat, 400 g of carbohydrate, 100 g of protein, 2 L of fluid, and the required sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, vitamins, and other elements. Salivary, gastric, intestinal, hepatic, and pancreatic secretions add an additional 7–8 L of protein-, lipid-, and electrolyte-containing fluid to intestinal contents. This massive load is reduced by the small and large intestines to less than 200 g of stool that contains less than 8 g of fat, 1–2 g of nitrogen, and less than 20 mmol each of , , , , , or .

If there is impairment of any of the many steps involved in the complex process of nutrient digestion and absorption, intestinal &quot;malabsorption&quot; may ensue. If the abnormality involves a single step in the absorptive process, as in primary lactase deficiency, or if the disease process is limited to the very proximal small intestine, then selective malabsorption of only a single nutrient may occur. However, generalized &quot;malabsorption&quot; of multiple dietary nutrients develops when the disease process is extensive, thus disturbing several digestive and absorptive processes, as occurs in coeliac disease with extensive involvement of the small intestine.

==Signs and symptoms==

===Gastrointestinal manifestations===
Depending on the nature of the disease process causing malabsorption and its extent, gastrointestinal symptoms may range from severe to subtle or may even be totally absent. Diarrhea, weight loss, flatulence, abdominal bloating, abdominal cramps, and pain may be present. Although diarrhea is a common complaint, the character and frequency of stools may vary considerably ranging from over 10 watery stools per day to less than one voluminous putty-like stool, the latter causing some patients to complain of constipation. On the other hand, stool mass is invariably increased in patients with steatorrhea and generalized malabsorption above the normal with 150–200 g/day. Not only do unabsorbed nutrients contribute to stool mass but mucosal fluid and electrolyte secretion is also increased in diseases associated with mucosal inflammation such as coeliac disease. In addition, unabsorbed fatty acids, converted to hydroxy-fatty acids by colonic flora, as well as unabsorbed bile acids both impair absorption and induce secretion of water and electrolytes by the colon adding to stool mass. Weight loss is common among patients with significant intestinal malabsorption but must be evaluated in the context of caloric intake. Some patients compensate for fecal wastage of unabsorbed nutrients by significantly increasing their oral intake. Eliciting a careful dietary history from patients with suspected malabsorption is therefore crucial. Excessive flatus and abdominal bloating may reflect excessive gas production due to fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrate, especially among patients with a primary or secondary disaccharidase deficiency, such as lactose intolerance or sucrose intolerance. Malabsorption of dietary nutrients and excessive fluid secretion by inflamed small intestine also contribute to abdominal distention and bloating. Prevalence, severity, and character of abdominal pain vary considerably among the various disease processes associated with intestinal malabsorption. For example, pain is common in patients with chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer and Crohn&#x27;s disease, but it is absent in many patients with coeliac disease or postgastrectomy malabsorption.

===Extraintestinal manifestations===
Substantial numbers of patients with intestinal malabsorption present initially with symptoms or laboratory abnormalities that point to other organ systems in the absence of or overshadowing symptoms referable to the gastrointestinal tract. For example, there is increasing epidemiologic evidence that more patients with coeliac disease present with anemia and osteopenia in the absence of significant classic gastrointestinal symptoms. Microcytic, macrocytic, or dimorphic anemia may reflect impaired iron, folate, or vitamin B12 absorption. Purpura, subconjunctival hemorrhage, or even frank bleeding may reflect hypoprothrombinemia secondary to vitamin K malabsorption. Osteopenia is common, especially in the presence of steatorrhea. Impaired calcium and vitamin D absorption and chelation of calcium by unabsorbed fatty acids resulting in fecal loss of calcium may all contribute. If calcium deficiency is prolonged, secondary hyperparathyroidism may develop. Prolonged malnutrition may induce amenorrhea, infertility, and impotence. Edema and even ascites may reflect hypoproteinemia associated with protein losing enteropathy caused by lymphatic obstruction or extensive mucosal inflammation. Dermatitis and peripheral neuropathy may be caused by malabsorption of specific vitamins or micronutrients and essential fatty acids.

===Presentation===

Symptoms can manifest in a variety of ways and features might give a clue to the underlying condition. Symptoms can be intestinal or extra-intestinal - the former predominates in severe malabsorption.
* Diarrhoea, often steatorrhoea, is the most common feature. Watery, diurnal and nocturnal, bulky, frequent stools are the clinical hallmark of overt malabsorption. It is due to impaired water, carbohydrate and electrolyte absorption or irritation from unabsorbed fatty acid. The latter also results in bloating, flatulence and abdominal discomfort. Cramping pain usually suggests obstructive intestinal segment &quot;e.g.&quot; in Crohn&#x27;s disease, especially if it persists after defecation.
* Weight loss can be significant despite increased oral intake of nutrients.
* Growth retardation, failure to thrive, delayed puberty in children
* Swelling or oedema from loss of protein
* Anaemias, commonly from vitamin B12, folic acid and iron deficiency presenting as fatigue and weakness, and the first of which can give rise to neuropsychiatric symptoms such as abnormal sensations, difficulty walking, and decreased mental abilities.
* Muscle cramp from decreased vitamin D, calcium absorption. Also lead to osteomalacia and osteoporosis
* Bleeding tendencies from vitamin K and other coagulation factor deficiencies.

==Causes==
==Pathophysiology==
The main purpose of the gastrointestinal tract is to digest and absorb nutrients (fat, carbohydrate, protein, micronutrients (vitamins and trace minerals), water, and electrolytes. Digestion involves both mechanical and enzymatic breakdown of food. Mechanical processes include chewing, gastric churning, and the to-and-fro mixing in the small intestine. Enzymatic hydrolysis is initiated by intraluminal processes requiring gastric, pancreatic, and biliary secretions. The final products of digestion are absorbed through the intestinal epithelial cells.

Malabsorption constitutes the pathological interference with the normal physiological sequence of digestion (intraluminal process), absorption (mucosal process) and transport (postmucosal events) of nutrients.

Intestinal malabsorption can be due to:
* Congenital or acquired reduction in absorptive surface
* Defects of ion transport
* Defects of specific hydrolysis
* Impaired enterohepatic circulation
* Mucosal damage (enteropathy)
* Pancreatic insufficiency

==Diagnosis==
There is no single, specific test for malabsorption. As for most medical conditions, investigation is guided by symptoms and signs. A range of different conditions can produce malabsorption and it is necessary to look for each of these specifically. Many tests have been advocated, and some, such as tests for pancreatic function are complex, vary between centers and have not been widely adopted. However, better tests have become available with greater ease of use, better sensitivity and specificity for the causative conditions. Tests are also needed to detect the systemic effects of deficiency of the malabsorbed nutrients (such as anaemia with vitamin B12 malabsorption).

===Classification===
Some prefer to classify malabsorption clinically into three basic categories:
# selective, as seen in lactose malabsorption.
# partial, as observed in abetalipoproteinaemia.
# total, as in exceptional cases of coeliac disease.

===Blood tests===
* Routine blood tests may reveal anaemia, high CRP or low albumin; which shows a high correlation for the presence of an organic disease. In this setting, microcytic anaemia usually implies iron deficiency and macrocytosis can be caused by impaired folic acid or B12 absorption or both. Low cholesterol or triglyceride may give a clue toward fat malabsorption. Low calcium and phosphate may give a clue toward osteomalacia from low vitamin D.
* Specific vitamins like vitamin D or micronutrient like zinc levels can be checked. Fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K) are affected in fat malabsorption. Prolonged prothrombin time can be caused by vitamin K deficiency.
* Serological studies. Specific tests are carried out to determine the underlying cause.IgA Anti-transglutaminase antibodies or IgA Anti-endomysial antibodies for Coeliac disease (gluten sensitive enteropathy).

===Stool studies===
* Microscopy is particularly useful in diarrhoea, may show protozoa like Giardia, ova, cyst and other infective agents.
* Fecal fat study to diagnose steatorrhoea is rarely performed nowadays.
* Low fecal pancreatic elastase is indicative of pancreatic insufficiency. Chymotrypsin and pancreolauryl can be assessed as well

===Radiological studies===
* Barium follow through is useful in delineating small intestinal anatomy. Barium enema may be undertaken to see colonic or ileal lesions.
* CT abdomen is useful in ruling out structural abnormality, done in pancreatic protocol when visualising pancreas.
* Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) to complement or as an alternative to ERCP.

===Interventional studies===

* OGD to detect duodenal pathology and obtain D2 biopsy (for coeliac disease, tropical sprue, Whipple&#x27;s disease, abetalipoproteinaemia etc.)
* Enteroscopy for enteropathy and jejunal aspirate and culture for bacterial overgrowth
* Capsule Endoscopy is able to visualise the whole small intestine and is occasionally useful.
* Colonoscopy is necessary in colonic and ileal disease.
* ERCP will show pancreatic and biliary structural abnormalities.

===Other investigations===
* 75SeHCAT test to diagnose bile acid malabsorption in ileal disease or primary bile acid diarrhea.
* Glucose hydrogen breath test for bacterial overgrowth
* Lactose hydrogen breath test for lactose intolerance
* Sugar probes or 51Cr-EDTA to determine intestinal permeability.

===Obsolete tests no longer used clinically===
* D-xylose absorption test for mucosal disease or bacterial overgrowth. Normal in pancreatic insufficiency.
* Bile salt breath test (14C-glycocholate) to determine bile salt malabsorption.
* Schilling test to establish cause of B12 deficiency.

==Management==
Treatment is directed largely towards management of underlying cause:
* Replacement of nutrients, electrolytes and fluid may be necessary. In severe deficiency, hospital admission may be required for nutritional support and detailed advice from dietitians. Use of enteral nutrition by naso-gastric or other feeding tubes may be able to provide sufficient nutritional supplementation. Tube placement may also be done by percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, or surgical jejunostomy. In patients whose intestinal absorptive surface is severely limited from disease or surgery, long term total parenteral nutrition may be needed.
* Pancreatic enzymes are supplemented orally in pancreatic insufficiency.
* Dietary modification is important in some conditions:
** Gluten-free diet in coeliac disease.
** Lactose avoidance in lactose intolerance.
* Antibiotic therapy to treat Small Bowel Bacterial overgrowth.
* Cholestyramine or other bile acid sequestrants will help with reducing diarrhoea in bile acid malabsorption.

<text>Grandee (; , ) is an official aristocratic title conferred on some Spanish nobility. Holders of this dignity enjoyed similar privileges to those of the peerage of France during the , though in neither country did they have the significant constitutional political role the House of Lords gave to the Peerage of England, of Great Britain and of the United Kingdom. A &quot;grandee of Spain&quot; nonetheless enjoyed greater social privileges than those of other similar European dignities.

With the exception of Fernandina, all Spanish dukedoms are automatically attached to a grandeeship, yet only a few marquessates, countships, viscountcies, baronies and lordships have the distinction. A single person can be a grandee of Spain multiple times, as grandeeships are attached, except in a few cases, to a title and not an individual. Such grandees with more than one title notably include the current Duchess of Medinaceli and the Duke of Alba, who are grandees ten and nine times respectively. All sons and daughters of Infantes are also grandees.

According to the 1876 Constitution, fully in force until 1923, grandees of Spain could also be senators &quot;por derecho propio&quot; (&quot;in their own right&quot;), alongside archbishops and top military ranks.

As of 2018, grandeeships totalled 417 out of the 2,942 extant titles in Spain (approximately 14%) of which there were 153 Dukedoms, 142 Marquessates, 108 Countships, 2 Viscountcies, 2 Baronies, 3 Lordships and 7 hereditary grandees with no title attached to the grandeeship. Despite losing their last legal privilege in 1984, when the right to possess diplomatic passports and immunity was revoked for all grandees of Spain, they still enjoy certain ceremonial privileges. All grandees are entitled to remain covered in the presence of the King of Spain, as well as being addressed by him as (cousin), a privilege that originated in the 16th century, when most grandees were close relatives of the Monarch.

Outside Spain, the term can refer to other people of a somewhat comparable, exalted position, roughly synonymous with magnate; formerly a rank of high nobility (especially when it carried the right to a parliamentary seat). By extension, the term can refer informally to any important person of high status, particularly wealthy, landed long-time residents in a region. In the United Kingdom the term is currently and informally used of influential and long-standing members of the Conservative Party, Labour Party and Liberal Democrats, and has had more specific meanings in the past.

== Origins and privileges ==


Most Spanish noble titles are granted as (&quot;Peer of the realm&quot;), many of which predate the modern Spanish monarchy. The Kings of Spain re-established in 1520 the ancient dignity of Grande to confer as an additional rank of honour. The post-nominals of grandees of Spain are .

The dignity of grandee () began to be assumed by Spain&#x27;s leading noblemen in the Middle Ages to distinguish them as a (&#x27;Lord of the realm&#x27;), from lesser (), whose rank evolved into that of . It was, as John Selden the 17th-century English jurist pointed out, not a general term denoting a class, but &quot;an additional individual dignity not only to all Dukes but to some Marquesses and Counts also&quot;. Noble titles, including and above the rank of Count, were seldom created in heredity by the Kings of Castile and Aragon until the late Middle Ages—in contrast to France and elsewhere in Europe (where feudalism evolved more quickly)—being largely associated with royal officers until the 14th century. The conferral of grandeeships initially conveyed only ceremonial privileges, such as remaining covered or seated in the presence of royalty. Over time grandees received more substantial rights: for example freedom from taxation and immunity from arrest, save at the King&#x27;s command; they were usually the senior judicial officers of their region. These rights later became open to abuse with some grandees renouncing their allegiance to the monarchy to wage war on the King.

In the late 1470s, King Ferdinand II and Queen Isabella I were the first to clamp down on grandee powers assumed by the medieval territorial nobles. In the 16th century, limitations on the number of grandees were introduced by King Charles I (who later became Holy Roman Emperor as Charles V), who decreed that the Spanish Crown had the sole right to confer the dignity of a grandee.

Subsequently, the (grandees of Spain) were subdivided into three grades:
# those who spoke to the King and received his reply in full regalia;
# those who addressed the King uncovered, but by right wore their coronets to hear his answer;
# those who required permission from the King before wearing their coronets.

All grandees traditionally have been addressed by the king as &quot; mi Primo&quot; (my cousin), whereas ordinary nobles are formally styled as &quot; mi Pariente&quot; (my kinsman). &quot;Grandezas&quot; could also be bestowed upon foreigners, such as the memorialist Louis de Rouvroy, Duc de Saint-Simon who took great pride in becoming a grandee after his successful posting as French Ambassador to Madrid, representing King Louis XIV. The dignity was highly considered by foreign peers. For an extensive period of time, it was even deemed &#x27;the pinnacle of nobiliary stratification&#x27;. Foreign grandees were mostly French, although there was also a significant number of German, Flemish, Walloon, Italian, and Novohispanic/Aztec peers, as a result of the scope of the Spanish Empire in Europe and the Americas. Some examples included the Dukes of Wellington, Bavaria, Villars, Mouchy, Moctezuma de Tultengo, Doudeauville, Croÿ, the Princes of Sulmona, Ligne, and the Counts of Egmont.

The dignity of grandee was abolished by the Napoleonic King Joseph Bonaparte, before being revived in 1834 by when grandees were given precedence in the Chamber of Peers of Spain.

Nowadays, all grandees are deemed to be &quot;of the first class&quot;, and is an honorific dignity conferring neither power nor legal privilege. A (grandeeship) is a separate legal entity from a title of nobility, although are normally but not exclusively granted in conjunction with a title. Since the 20th century invariably the King of Spain has conferred a upon any newly created duke.

A grandee of any noble rank is higher in precedence than a non-grandee (apart from members of the Spanish Royal Family), even if that non-grandee holds a hereditary title () of a higher grade than that of the said grandee. Thus, a baron-grandee would outrank a non-grandee marquess, thus rendering the dignity of an hereditary rank of precedence rather than a title of nobility. Since 1987, children of an of Spain are recognised as members of the Spanish royal family and are accorded the rank and style of a grandee by courtesy: they do not formally hold this dignity until such time as a title with is granted to them by the sovereign.

Some of the best known Spanish grandees are the dukes of Arcos, of Alba, of Medinaceli, of Villahermosa, of Osuna, del Infantado, of Alburquerque, of Moctezuma, of Frías and of Medina-Sidonia; well-known marquesses include those of Aguilar de Campoo, of Astorga, of Santillana, and of ; the counts of Benavente, of Lerín, Olivares, Oñate, and Lemos also hold grandeeships.

Grandees and their consorts are entitled to the honorific prefix of &#x27;the Most Excellent Lord/Lady&#x27; or &#x27;His/Her Most Excellency&#x27;, and they can be addressed as (cousin) by the King, although this tradition is in disuse today.

==Portugal and Brazil==

Both Portuguese and Brazilian nobility adopted the term (&quot;grandee&quot;) from the Spanish, to designate a higher rank of noblemen. The Brazilian system automatically deemed dukes, marquises and counts (as well as archbishops and bishops) (&quot;grandees of the Empire&quot;, or literally translated as &quot;Great Ones of the Empire&quot;). Viscounts and barons could also be ennobled with or without (&quot;grandeeship&quot;, alternatively &quot;greatness&quot;).

Viscounts ennobled with grandeeship displayed a count&#x27;s coronet on their coat of arms, and barons ennobled with grandeeship bore a coat of arms surmounted by a viscount&#x27;s coronet.

The order of precedence in Brazilian nobility was as follows: after the members of the Imperial Family, dukes, marquises, counts, viscounts with grandeeship, viscounts without grandeeship, barons with grandeeship, barons without grandeeship. Brazilian grandeeships, like its nobility, were not hereditary titles.

Grandees were allowed to keep their heads covered in the presence of the king or emperor until such time as the monarch may command otherwise; as elsewhere throughout Europe, these noble families displayed their coats of arms on their properties, carriages (or vehicles), and over their graves (see hatchment). The abolition of the monarchies in Portugal and Brazil extinguished the formal use of such titles, although their use continues among some of the Portuguese aristocracies.

==New Model Army==

During the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, senior military officers from the English landed gentry who served in the New Model Army, who were opposed to the more radical Levellers, came to be informally termed &quot;grandees&quot;. After the defeat of Charles I of England in the Second English Civil War, there was a series of debates and confrontations between radical, elected representatives of New Model Army soldiers, known as the Agitators, and the Army&#x27;s grandees such as Sir Thomas Fairfax, Oliver Cromwell and Henry Ireton, who opposed the Agitators&#x27; more radical proposals. These disagreements were aired publicly at the Putney Debates, which started in late October 1647 and lasted for several weeks.

<text>The pale-breasted spinetail (Synallaxis albescens) is a passerine bird in the Furnariinae subfamily of the ovenbird family Furnariidae. It is found in Costa Rica, Panama, Trinidad, and in every mainland South American country except Chile and Ecuador.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The pale-breasted spinetail&#x27;s taxonomy is in flux. The International Ornithological Committee (IOC) recognizes these 11 subspecies:

*&quot;S. a. latitabunda&quot; 
*&quot;S. a. insignis&quot; 
*&quot;S. a. occipitalis&quot; 
*&quot;S. a. littoralis&quot; 
*&quot;S. a. perpallida&quot; 
*&quot;S. a. nesiotis&quot; 
*&quot;S. a. trinitatis&quot; 
*&quot;S. a. josephinae&quot; 
*&quot;S. a. inaequalis&quot; 
*&quot;S. a. albescens&quot; 
*&quot;S. a. australis&quot; 

The Clements taxonomy recognizes two more subspecies, &quot;S. a. hypoleuca&quot; (Ridgway, 1909) and &quot;S. a. griseonota&quot; (Todd, 1948). The IOC includes &quot;hypoleuca&quot; within &quot;latitabunda&quot; and &quot;griseonota&quot; within &quot;inaequalis&quot;. BirdLife International&#x27;s &quot;Handbook of the Birds of the World&quot; does not recognize the two Clements entries nor &quot;trinitatis&quot;.

What is now the dark-breasted spinetail (&quot;S. albigularis&quot;) was previously treated by some authors as conspecific with the pale-breasted spinetail. Some now treat them as sister species.

This article follows the IOC 11-subspecies model.

==Description==

The pale-breasted spinetail is long and weighs . It is slightly smaller and has a shorter bill than most other members of genus &quot;Synallaxis&quot;. The sexes have the same plumage. Adults of the nominate subspecies &quot;S. a. albescens&quot; have a pale brownish gray face with an even paler line through the eye. Their forehead is olive grayish brown and their crown dark rufous, often with slight mottling. Their back, rump and uppertail coverts are olive-brown. Their wing coverts are rufous and their flight feathers tawny-brownish. Their tail is olive-brown with a variable rufescent tinge on the outer feathers; it is graduated and the feathers have somewhat pointed tips. Their throat is whitish with black flecks in its lower part. Their breast is pale buffy gray, their belly a paler buffy gray, and their flanks and undertail coverts browner than the belly. Their iris is yellowish to light brown or brown, their maxilla black to dark gray, their mandible blackish to gray (sometimes with a dark tip to the gray), and their legs and feet yellowish brown to grayish olive or brownish yellow. Juveniles have a brownish gray crown, and compared to adults they have paler and more rufescent upperparts, an almost white throat, and paler underparts with an almost white center to the belly.

The other 10 subspecies of the pale-breasted spinetail differ from the nominate and each other thus:

*&quot;S. a. latitabunda&quot;: darker than the nominate with browner tail and flanks
*&quot;S. a. insignis&quot;: more extensive grayish of the forehead and a smaller rufous crown than the nominate, with a paler and brownish-tinged back and a paler and less grayish breast
*&quot;S. a. occipitalis&quot;: darker than the nominate with a blackish forehead
*&quot;S. a. littoralis&quot;: more brownish upperparts than &quot;insignis&quot; and underparts less grayish than the nominate
*&quot;S. a. perpallida&quot;: darker than the nominate with more grayish upperparts, darker rufous crown and wing coverts, and a very white belly
*&quot;S. a. nesiotis&quot;: paler crown and shoulders (with a yellowish tinge) than the nominate, with paler and grayer upperparts and whiter underparts
*&quot;S. a. trinitatis&quot;: darker crown and wing coverts and a more buff-brown back than the nominate
*&quot;S. a. josephinae&quot;: darker than &quot;nesiotis&quot; with a darker face, a less buffy back, a more grayish breast, and darker brownish flanks
*&quot;S. a. inaequalis&quot;: much paler than &quot;josephinae&quot; with lighter rufous crown and wing coverts, a grayish tinged back, whiter throat and belly, and pale gray to whitish breast
*&quot;S. a. australis&quot;: similar to the nominate, with olive tips on the crown feathers and a duller and more grayish brown back

==Distribution and habitat==

The subspecies of the pale-breasted spinetail are found thus:

*&quot;S. a. latitabunda&quot;: southwestern Costa Rica and the Pacific coasts of southern Panama and northwestern Colombia
*&quot;S. a. insignis&quot;: northern and central Colombia and Venezuela&#x27;s Apure state
*&quot;S. a. occipitalis&quot;: mountains of north-central Colombia and northwestern Venezuela
*&quot;S. a. littoralis&quot;: coastal northern Colombia
*&quot;S. a. perpallida&quot;: Colombia&#x27;s Guajira Peninsula and far northwestern Venezuela
*&quot;S. a. nesiotis&quot;: Colombia&#x27;s Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta east into northern Venezuela; also Isla Margarita 
*&quot;S. a. trinitatis&quot;: Trinidad and eastern Venezuela
*&quot;S. a. josephinae&quot;: southern Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, and northern Brazil&#x27;s Roraima state
*&quot;S. a. inaequalis&quot;: French Guiana and north-central and northeastern Brazil
*&quot;S. a. albescens&quot;: eastern and southern Brazil from Maranhão and Pernambuco to Mato Grosso and Paraná, eastern Paraguay, and northeastern Argentina&#x27;s Misiones Province
*&quot;S. a. australis&quot;: southeastern Peru&#x27;s Department of Madre de Dios, central and eastern Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina south to La Pampa and Buenos Aire provinces, and western Uruguay.

The pale-breasted spinetail inhabits a wide variety of open grassy landscapes. These include savanna, &quot;cerrado&quot;, &quot;campo rupestre&quot;, shrub-steppe, brushy areas in woodlands, pastures, and the edges of secondary forest, marshes, and roadsides. In elevation it is generally found below . In Central America it occurs below and in Colombia up to .

==Behavior==
===Movement===

The pale-breasted spinetail is believed to be a year-round resident in most of its range, though the farthest southern sub-population might make some northern movement after the breeding season.

===Feeding===

The pale-breasted spinetail feeds on a wide variety of arthropods, and also includes small snails in its diet. It usually forages in pairs, gleaning prey from grass, foliage, small branches, and at times the ground. It usually stays below about of the ground.

===Breeding===

The pale-breasted spinetail&#x27;s breeding season varies geographically but is generally within the local spring and summer. Though it is a member of the ovenbird family, which is named for the clay nests many species make, the pale-breasted spinetail constructs a globe of grass and thorny sticks with a horizontal entrance tube. The tube and inner chamber are lined with soft plant material. The nest is typically placed in bunch grass or in a vine-covered bush, usually within of the ground and rarely as high as . The clutch size is two to four eggs. The incubation period is 15 to 18 days and fledging occurs about 16 days after hatch. The species is thought to be monogamous, and both members of the pair incubate the clutch and care for nestlings.
===Vocalization===

The pale-breasted spinetail sings for long periods. Its song is variously described as &quot;a sharp, scratchy &quot;zwee-bit, zweebit&quot;&quot;, a &quot;very high scratchy &quot;wéetjirr wéetjirr&quot;&quot;, an &quot;incessantly repeated wee-tee&quot;, an &quot;unceasing, very high, shrill &#x27;zutsweet zutsweet- -&#x27; &quot;, a repeated &quot;wee bidget..wee bidget...&quot;, and &quot;a buzzy, nasal &#x27;wéé-byew&#x27;, &#x27;wáke-up&#x27;, &#x27;wa-tér&#x27; &quot;. A call in Costa Rica is a &quot;sharp &#x27;bip&#x27; &quot; that is often repeated and followed by a &quot;long rattling &#x27;churrr&#x27; &quot;. In Brazil its call is described as an &quot;extr. high &#x27;tsweét&#x27; &quot;.

==Status==

The IUCN has assessed the pale-breasted spinetail as being of Least Concern. It has an extremely large range and its estimated population of 50 million mature individuals is believed to be stable. No immediate threats have been identified. It is considered fairly common to common in most of its range though local in southeastern Brazil. It is &quot;[t]olerant of moderate anthropogenic disturbance, provided that adequate areas of tall grass remain [and is expanding] its range in areas that have been cleared&quot;.

<text>In Latter-day Saint theology, Egyptus () is the name of two women in the Book of Abraham in the Pearl of Great Price. One is the wife of Ham, son of Noah, who bears his children. The other is their daughter, who discovered Egypt while &quot;it was under water&quot; (1:23-24). Three 1835 pre-publication manuscripts of the Book of Abraham, in place of &quot;Egyptus&quot;, read Zeptah for the elder Egyptus and Egyptes for the younger Egyptus.

The younger Egyptus places her eldest son on the throne as Pharaoh, the first king of Egypt (1:25). Pharaoh was a descendant of the Canaanites (1:22), a race of people who had a black skin come upon them (Moses 7:8). Some early Mormon leaders have taught that Egyptus passed black skin and the curse of Cain through the flood so that the devil might have representation upon the earth, although this has now been repudiated by later leaders.

The word Egyptus is considered to be an anachronism in the Book of Abraham among non-Mormon Egyptologists and historians, since the origin of term &quot;Egypt&quot; is believed to have come from another source much later in history from the time of the narrative described in the Book of Abraham. The word &quot;pharaoh&quot; is also considered to be an anachronism in the Book of Abraham for similar reasons.

==The Curse of Cain==
W. W. Phelps, a counselor in the presidency of the church, was the first in the church to teach that Ham&#x27;s wife was black because she was under the curse of Cain. In 1835, he taught that Ham himself was cursed because he had married a black wife. Brigham Young also taught that Egyptus was under the curse of Cain and passed the curse through the flood. In April 1836, within months of translating the Book of Abraham verses, Joseph Smith himself taught in reference to , &quot;it remains as a lasting monument of the decree of Jehovah, to the shame and confusion of all who have cried out against the South, in consequence of their holding the sons of Ham in servitude!&quot;. John Taylor explained that it was necessary that the curse of Cain was passed through Egyptus so that &quot;the devil should have a representation upon the earth as well as God&quot;.

Like many Americans, many Mormons of the 19th century accepted the idea promoted in slavery states that black Africans had Cain&#x27;s &quot;mark&quot; of black skin, and Ham&#x27;s curse to be servants of servants. These ideas were eventually abandoned by later church leaders as unsupported by scripture.

<text>There are related mythological figures named Porus or Poros () in Greek classical literature.

In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot;, Porus was the personification of resourcefulness or expediency. Porus was the son of the goddess Metis, but his father is unknown.

He was seduced by Penia (poverty) while drunk on more than his fill of nectar at Aphrodite&#x27;s birthday. Penia gave birth to Eros (love) from their union. According to the character Diotima, Eros is forever in need because of his mother, but forever pursuing because of his father.

This figure exists in Roman mythology as well and is known as Pomona, in which Porus is the personification of abundance.

<doc id="821071" wikidata="Q288759" url="?curid=821071" title="ACT-R">
<text>ACT-R (pronounced /ˌækt ˈɑr/; short for &quot;Adaptive Control of Thought—Rational&quot;) is a cognitive architecture mainly developed by John Robert Anderson and Christian Lebiere at Carnegie Mellon University. Like any cognitive architecture, ACT-R aims to define the basic and irreducible cognitive and perceptual operations that enable the human mind. 
In theory, each task that humans can perform should consist of a series of these discrete operations.

Most of the ACT-R&#x27;s basic assumptions are also inspired by the progress of cognitive neuroscience, and ACT-R can be seen and described as a way of specifying how the brain itself is organized in a way that enables individual processing modules to produce cognition.

==Inspiration==
ACT-R has been inspired by the work of Allen Newell, and especially by his lifelong championing the idea of unified theories as the only way to truly uncover the underpinnings of cognition.
In fact, Anderson usually credits Newell as the major source of influence over his own theory.

==What ACT-R looks like==
Like other influential cognitive architectures (including Soar, CLARION, and EPIC), the ACT-R theory has a computational implementation as an interpreter of a special coding language. The interpreter itself is written in Common Lisp, and might be loaded into any of the Common Lisp language distributions.

This means that any researcher may download the ACT-R code from the ACT-R website, load it into a Common Lisp distribution, and gain full access to the theory in the form of the ACT-R interpreter.

Also, this enables researchers to specify models of human cognition in the form of a script in the ACT-R language. The language primitives and data-types are designed to reflect the theoretical assumptions about human cognition. 
These assumptions are based on numerous facts derived from experiments in cognitive psychology and brain imaging.

Like a programming language, ACT-R is a framework: for different tasks (e.g., Tower of Hanoi, memory for text or for list of words, language comprehension, communication, aircraft controlling), researchers create &quot;models&quot; (i.e., programs) in ACT-R.
These models reflect the modelers&#x27; assumptions about the task within the ACT-R view of cognition. 
The model might then be run.

Running a model automatically produces a step-by-step simulation of human behavior which specifies each individual cognitive operation (i.e., memory encoding and retrieval, visual and auditory encoding, motor programming and execution, mental imagery manipulation). 
Each step is associated with quantitative predictions of latencies and accuracies. 
The model can be tested by comparing its results with the data collected in behavioral experiments.

In recent years, ACT-R has also been extended to make quantitative predictions of patterns of activation in the brain, as detected in experiments with fMRI.
In particular, ACT-R has been augmented to predict the shape and time-course of the BOLD response of several brain areas, including the hand and mouth areas in the motor cortex, the left prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the basal ganglia.

===Brief outline===
ACT-R&#x27;s most important assumption is that human knowledge can be divided into two irreducible kinds of representations: &quot;declarative&quot; and &quot;procedural&quot;. 
Within the ACT-R code, declarative knowledge is represented in the form of &quot;chunks&quot;, i.e. vector representations of individual properties, each of them accessible from a labelled slot.

Chunks are held and made accessible through &quot;buffers&quot;, which are the front-end of what are &quot;modules&quot;, i.e. specialized and largely independent brain structures.

There are two types of modules:

* Perceptual-motor modules, which take care of the interface with the real world (i.e., with a simulation of the real world). The most well-developed perceptual-motor modules in ACT-R are the visual and the manual modules.
* Memory modules. There are two kinds of memory modules in ACT-R:
** Declarative memory, consisting of facts such as &quot;Washington, D.C. is the capital of United States&quot;, &quot;France is a country in Europe&quot;, or &quot;2+3=5&quot;
** Procedural memory, made of productions. Productions represent knowledge about how we do things: for instance, knowledge about how to type the letter &quot;Q&quot; on a keyboard, about how to drive, or about how to perform addition.

All the modules can only be accessed through their buffers. The contents of the buffers at a given moment in time represent the state of ACT-R at that moment. The only exception to this rule is the procedural module, which stores and applies procedural knowledge. It does not have an accessible buffer and is actually used to access other modules&#x27; contents.

Procedural knowledge is represented in form of &quot;productions&quot;. The term &quot;production&quot; reflects the actual implementation of ACT-R as a production system, but, in fact, a production is mainly a formal notation to specify the information flow from cortical areas (i.e. the buffers) to the basal ganglia, and back to the cortex.

At each moment, an internal pattern matcher searches for a production that matches the current state of the buffers. Only one such production can be executed at a given moment. That production, when executed, can modify the buffers and thus change the state of the system. Thus, in ACT-R, cognition 
unfolds as a succession of production firings.

===The symbolic vs. connectionist debate===
In the cognitive sciences, different theories are usually ascribed to either the &quot;symbolic&quot; or the &quot;connectionist&quot; approach to cognition. ACT-R clearly belongs to the &quot;symbolic&quot; field and is classified as such in standard textbooks and collections. Its entities (chunks and productions) are discrete and its operations are syntactical, that is, not referring to the semantic content of the representations but only to their properties that deem them appropriate to participate in the computation(s). This is seen clearly in the chunk slots and in the properties of buffer matching in productions, both of which function as standard symbolic variables.

Members of the ACT-R community, including its developers, prefer to think of ACT-R as a general framework that specifies how the brain is organized, and how its organization gives birth to what is perceived (and, in cognitive psychology, investigated) as mind, going beyond the traditional symbolic/connectionist debate. None of this, naturally, argues against the classification of ACT-R as symbolic system, because all symbolic approaches to cognition aim to describe the mind, as a product of brain function, using a certain class of entities and systems to achieve that goal.

A common misunderstanding suggests that ACT-R may not be a symbolic system because it attempts to characterize brain function. This is incorrect on two counts: First, all approaches to computational modeling of cognition, symbolic or otherwise, must in some respect characterize brain function, because the mind is brain function. And second, all such approaches, including connectionist approaches, attempt to characterize the mind at a cognitive level of description and not at the neural level, because it is only at the cognitive level that important generalizations can be retained.

Further misunderstandings arise because of the associative character of certain ACT-R properties, such as chunks spreading activation to each other, or chunks and productions carrying quantitative properties relevant to their selection. None of these properties counter the fundamental nature of these entities as symbolic, regardless of their role in unit selection and, ultimately, in computation.

===Theory vs. implementation, and Vanilla ACT-R===
The importance of distinguishing between the theory itself and its implementation is usually highlighted by ACT-R developers.

In fact, much of the implementation does not reflect the theory. 
For instance, the actual implementation makes use of additional &#x27;modules&#x27; that exist only for purely computational reasons, and are not supposed to reflect anything in the brain (e.g., one computational module contains the pseudo-random number generator used to produce noisy parameters, while another holds naming routines for generating data structures accessible through variable names).

Also, the actual implementation is designed to enable researchers to modify the theory, e.g. by altering the standard parameters, or creating new modules, or partially modifying the behavior of the existing ones.

Finally, while Anderson&#x27;s laboratory at CMU maintains and releases the official ACT-R code, other alternative implementations of the theory have been made available. These alternative implementations include &quot;jACT-R&quot; (written in Java by Anthony M. Harrison at the Naval Research Laboratory) and &quot;Python ACT-R&quot; (written in Python by Terrence C. Stewart and Robert L. West at Carleton University, Canada).

Similarly, ACT-RN (now discontinued) was a full-fledged neural implementation of the 1993 version of the theory. 
All of these versions were fully functional, and models have been written and run with all of them.

Because of these implementational degrees of freedom, the ACT-R community usually refers to the &quot;official&quot;, Lisp-based, version of the theory, when adopted in its original form and left unmodified, as &quot;Vanilla ACT-R&quot;.

==Applications==
Over the years, ACT-R models have been used in more than 700 different scientific publications, and have been cited in many more.

===Memory, attention, and executive control===
The ACT-R declarative memory system has been used to model human memory since its inception. In the course of years, it has been adopted to successfully model a large number of known effects. They include the fan effect of interference for associated information, primacy and recency effects for list memory, and serial recall.

ACT-R has been used to model attentive and control processes in a number of cognitive paradigms. These include the Stroop task, task switching, the psychological refractory period, and multi-tasking.

===Natural language===
A number of researchers have been using ACT-R to model several aspects of natural language understanding and production. They include models of syntactic parsing, language understanding, language acquisition and metaphor comprehension.

===Complex tasks===
ACT-R has been used to capture how humans solve complex problems like the Tower of Hanoi, or how people solve algebraic equations. It has also been used to model human behavior in driving and flying.

With the integration of perceptual-motor capabilities, ACT-R has become increasingly popular as a modeling tool in human factors and human-computer interaction. In this domain, it has been adopted to model driving behavior under different conditions, menu selection and visual search on computer application, and web navigation.

===Cognitive neuroscience===
More recently, ACT-R has been used to predict patterns of brain activation during imaging experiments. In this field, ACT-R models have been successfully used to predict prefrontal and parietal activity in memory retrieval, anterior cingulate activity for control operations, and practice-related changes in brain activity.

===Education===
ACT-R has been often adopted as the foundation for cognitive tutors. These systems use an internal ACT-R model to mimic the behavior of a student and personalize his/her instructions and curriculum, trying to &quot;guess&quot; the difficulties that students may have and provide focused help.

Such &quot;Cognitive Tutors&quot; are being used as a platform for research on learning and cognitive modeling as part of the Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center. Some of the most successful applications, like the Cognitive Tutor for Mathematics, are used in thousands of schools across the United States.

==Brief history==

===Early years: 1973–1990===
ACT-R is the ultimate successor of a series of increasingly precise models of human cognition developed by John R. Anderson.

Its roots can be backtraced to the original HAM (Human Associative Memory) model of memory, described by John R. Anderson and Gordon Bower in 1973. The HAM model was later expanded into the first version of the ACT theory. This was the first time the procedural memory was added to the original declarative memory system, introducing a computational dichotomy that was later proved to hold in human brain. The theory was then further extended into the ACT* model of human cognition.

===Integration with rational analysis: 1990–1998===
In the late eighties, Anderson devoted himself to exploring and outlining a mathematical approach to cognition that he named Rational analysis. The basic assumption of Rational Analysis is that cognition is optimally adaptive, and precise estimates of cognitive functions mirror statistical properties of the environment. Later on, he came back to the development of the ACT theory, using the Rational Analysis as a unifying framework for the underlying calculations. To highlight the importance of the new approach in the shaping of the architecture, its name was modified to ACT-R, with the &quot;R&quot; standing for &quot;Rational&quot; 

In 1993, Anderson met with Christian Lebiere, a researcher in connectionist models mostly famous for developing with Scott Fahlman the Cascade Correlation learning algorithm. Their joint work culminated in the release of ACT-R 4.0. Thanks to Mike Byrne (now at Rice University), version 4.0 also included optional perceptual and motor capabilities, mostly inspired from the EPIC architecture, which greatly expanded the possible applications of the theory.

===Brain Imaging and Modular Structure: 1998–2015===
After the release of ACT-R 4.0, John Anderson became more and more interested in the underlying neural plausibility of his life-time theory, and began to use brain imaging techniques pursuing his own goal of understanding the computational underpinnings of the human mind.

The necessity of accounting for brain localization pushed for a major revision of the theory. ACT-R 5.0 introduced the concept of modules, specialized sets of procedural and declarative representations that could be mapped to known brain systems. In addition, the interaction between procedural and declarative knowledge was mediated by newly introduced buffers, specialized structures for holding temporarily active information (see the section above). Buffers were thought to reflect cortical activity, and a subsequent series of studies later confirmed that activations in cortical regions could be successfully related to computational operations over buffers.

A new version of the code, completely rewritten, was presented in 2005 as ACT-R 6.0. It also included significant improvements in the ACT-R coding language. This included a new mechanism in ACT-R production specification called dynamic pattern matching.  Unlike previous versions which required the pattern matched by a production to include specific slots for the information in the buffers, dynamic pattern matching allows the slots to be matched to also be specified by the buffer contents. A description and motivation for the ACT-R 6.0 is given in Anderson (2007).

===ACT-R 7.0: 2015-Present===
At the 2015 workshop, it was argued that software changes required an increment in the model numbering to ACT-R 7.0. A major software change was removal of the requirement that chunks must be specified based on predefined chunk-types.  The chunk-type mechanism was not removed, but changed from being a required construct of the architecture to being an optional syntactic mechanism in the software.  This allowed for more flexibility in knowledge representation for modeling tasks that require learning novel information and extended the functionality provided through dynamic pattern matching now allowing models to create new &quot;types&quot; of chunks.  This also lead to a simplification of the syntax required for specifying the actions in a production because all the actions now have the same syntactic form.  The ACT-R software has also been subsequently updated to include a remote interface based on JSON RPC 1.0.  That interface was added to make it easier to build tasks for models and work with ACT-R from languages other than Lisp, and the tutorial included with the software has been updated to provide Python implementations for all of the example tasks performed by the tutorial models.

===Workshop and summer school===
In 1995, Carnegie Mellon University began hosting their Annual ACT-R Workshop and Summer School. Their ACT-R Workshop is currently hosted at the annual MathPsych/ICCM Conference, and their Summer School is hosted on-campus with a virtual attendance option at Carnegie Mellon University.

===Spin-offs===
The long development of the ACT-R theory gave birth to a certain number of parallel and related projects.

The most important ones are the PUPS production system, an initial implementation of Anderson&#x27;s theory, later abandoned; and ACT-RN, a neural network implementation of the theory developed by Christian Lebiere.

Lynne M. Reder, also at Carnegie Mellon University, developed SAC in the early 1990s, a model of conceptual and perceptual aspects of memory that shares many features with the ACT-R core declarative system, although differing in some assumptions.

For his dissertation at Carnegie Mellon University, Christopher L. Dancy developed, and successfully defended in 2014, ACT-R/Phi, an implementation of ACT-R with added physiological modules which enable ACT-R to interface with human physiological processes.

A lightweight Python-based implementation of the working memory component of ACT-R, pyACTUp, was created by Don Morrison at Carnegie Mellon University, who maintains the ACT-R codebase. This library implements ACT-R as a unimodal supervised learning model for classification tasks.

<doc id="821079" wikidata="Q7180686" url="?curid=821079" title="Pharaoh (Book of Abraham)">
<text>In the Latter Day Saint scripture the Book of Abraham, Pharaoh is the proper name of the first king of Egypt. According to the story, all Egyptians descended from him. He was the eldest son of Egyptus, who was the daughter of Ham and Egyptus. Pharaoh was a descendant of the Canaanites, a race of people who according to Latter Day Saint theology had been cursed with black skin. Leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) have taught that he inherited the curse of Cain through his grandmother, Egyptus, so that the devil might have representation upon the earth.

==Anachronism==

The use of the name &quot;Pharaoh&quot; is considered anachronistic during Abraham&#x27;s time by virtually all scholars, including LDS Scholars. Most LDS Scholars who adhere to the historicity of the Book of Abraham point to a Jewish redactor who replaced original words with wording that would have been more understandable to his day.

<doc id="821108" wikidata="Q1137059" url="?curid=821108" title="Belgian Federal Parliament">
<text>The Federal Parliament (; ; ) is the bicameral parliament of Belgium. It consists of the Chamber of Representatives (lower house) and the Senate (upper house). It sits in the Palace of the Nation in the centre of the nation&#x27;s capital, Brussels.

The Chamber of Representatives is the primary legislative body; the Senate functions only as a meeting place of the federal communities and regions. The Belgian Constitution does not mention the Federal Parliament as such; it stipulates that the federal legislative power is exercised by the King and the Chamber of Representatives (and exceptionally the Senate), and defines when the United Chambers convene.

==Chamber of Representatives==
The Chamber of Representatives (, , ) holds its plenary meetings in the Palace of the Nation in Brussels (&quot;see below&quot;). Eligibility requirements for the Chamber are a minimum age of 21, citizenship, and residency in Belgium.

The number of seats in the Chamber is constitutionally set at 150 elected from 11 electoral districts. The districts are divided along linguistic lines: 5 Flemish (87 seats), 5 Walloon (48 seats), and the bilingual district of Brussels (15 seats). The districts are the provinces and the Brussels-Capital Region. Each district is given a number of seats proportional to its population (not the number of voters) ranging from 4 for Luxembourg to 24 for Antwerp.

All districts have an electoral threshold of 5%, except for Brussels and Leuven. After the dissolution of the former Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde district in 2013, which encompassed both the 19 bilingual municipalities from the Brussels-Capital Region and some 35 Dutch-speaking municipalities in Flemish Brabant, including 7 with language facilities for French-speakers, voters in the 6 municipalities with language facilities surrounding Brussels have been given the right to vote in the Brussels district instead.

The current composition was elected at the federal elections of 2024.

==Senate==
Since 2014, the Senate (, , ) consists of 60 members. There are two categories of senators: co-opted senators and senators of community and regional parliaments.

50 senators are elected by and from the community and regional parliaments: 29 by the Flemish Parliament, 10 by the Parliament of the French Community, 8 by the Walloon Parliament, 2 by the French-language group of the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region, and 1 by the Parliament of the German-speaking Community.

The 10 other senators are co-opted: elected by the 50 other senators. Eligibility requirements for the Senate are identical to those for the Chamber.

Before 2014, the Senate consisted of 71 senators, only 21 of which were elected by the community parliaments. 25 were directly elected by the Flemish-speaking constituency and 15 by the French-speaking constituency. The last direct election of these 40 members occurred in the 2010 federal elections. The 2014 elections were the first ones with the reformed Senate.

The President of the Senate since 2014 has been Christine Defraigne (MR). The Senate holds its plenary meetings in the Palace of the Nation, Brussels.

==Legislative procedure==
Since the elections of 21 May 1995, there has been a breakdown of powers between the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate, which resulted in the latter having fewer competencies than the Chamber of Representatives. Prior to that, the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate did the same parliamentary work on an equal footing, but now there are three different legislative procedures that can be followed: the one-chamber procedure, the optional two-chamber procedure, and the mandatory two-chamber procedure.

In certain matters, both Chambers have equal power. These include constitutional revisions, laws requiring a qualified majority, laws on the basic structure of the Belgian State, laws approving agreements of cooperation between the Federal State, the Communities and the Regions, laws on the approval of international treaties, and laws on the organization of the judiciary, the Council of State, and the Constitutional Court. In this case, the mandatory bicameral procedure applies, which means that both Chambers must pass exactly the same version of the bill.

For most other legislation, the Chamber of Representatives takes precedence over the Senate and the optional bicameral procedure applies. This means that the Senate may still intervene as a chamber of consideration and reflection. It has the opportunity to, within specific time limits, examine the bills adopted by the Chamber of Representatives and, if there is a reason to do so, make amendments. The Chamber may subsequently adopt or reject the amendments proposed by the Senate or make new proposals. The Senate can also submit a bill it has adopted to the Chamber, which can approve, reject or amend it. Whatever the case, the Chamber has the final word.

The one-chamber procedure applies in cases where the Chamber of Representatives has the sole power to legislate. It means that the Senate cannot intervene and that the Senate&#x27;s approval is not required for the bill to pass. The matters for which the Chamber of Representatives is exclusively responsible include naturalizations, ministerial liability, State budget, and accounts and military quotas.

==United Chambers==
The United Chambers (, , ) is the name given to the body created when both chambers of the Federal Parliament meet in joint session. The United Chambers are convened only on certain occasions enumerated in the Belgian Constitution: the King must take the constitutional oath before the United Chambers, in accordance with article 91 of the Constitution, and the United Chambers must provide for the regency if the successor to the Crown is a minor or the King is unable to reign, in accordance with articles 92 and 93 of the Constitution. The last session of the United Chambers took place on 21 July 2013, when King Philippe took the constitutional oath.

==Palace of the Nation==

The Palace of the Nation (, , ) was built from 1778 to 1783 to a neoclassical design by the French architect Gilles-Barnabé Guimard and includes sculptures by Gilles-Lambert Godecharle. Under Austrian rule, it housed the Sovereign Council of Brabant before being used as a courthouse during the French period. During the Dutch period, it was one of two homes of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, the other being in The Hague. Following Belgian independence in 1830, the Provisional Government of Belgium and Belgian National Congress moved into the building and the first session of the House of Representatives and Senate was held there a year later.

The building stands across the street from Brussels Park&#x27;s northern entrance, near the site of the former palace of the Dukes of Brabant, which was destroyed by fire in 1731, and has itself been badly damaged by fire, in 1820 and 1883. In the 1930s, a bunker was built underneath the park, connected by tunnels to the House of Parliament.

<doc id="821122" wikidata="Q948706" url="?curid=821122" title="Crash (Dave Matthews Band album)">
<text>Crash is the second studio album by the American rock band Dave Matthews Band, released on April 30, 1996 by RCA Records.

By March 16, 2000, the album had sold seven million copies, and was certified septuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. &quot;Crash&quot; is currently Dave Matthews Band&#x27;s best-selling album.

==Recording==
Recording of the album began in October 1995, and ended in January 1996. There were only four known songs from the &quot;Crash&quot; sessions that &quot;didn&#x27;t make it to the final cut.&quot; However, none of the titles are known.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Q&quot; described &quot;Crash&quot; as &quot;equal parts originality and willful complication&quot;, and stated, &quot;Although the band&#x27;s determinedly jammy methods do lead them away from their songs at times, almost every track of &quot;Crash&quot; is at least &#x27;good in parts&#x27;&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Tom Sinclair praised the band&#x27;s technical abilities, concluding that &quot;one of the nicest things about DMB&#x27;s music is that its distinctive complexity serves as a virtual assurance against a flood of lame imitator bands.&quot;

Jim DeRogatis of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was less favorable and deemed Matthews&#x27; vocals &quot;too much like Sting&#x27;s at times&quot; and his lyrics &quot;typically banal&quot;, while remarking that the album&#x27;s musical eclecticism &quot;gives Matthews a slight edge over his peers, but that&#x27;s sort of like saying you prefer vanilla ice cream to vanilla frozen yogurt.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; evaluated &quot;Crash&quot; as a &quot;dud&quot;.

<text>Level of measurement or scale of measure is a classification that describes the nature of information within the values assigned to variables. Psychologist Stanley Smith Stevens developed the best-known classification with four levels, or scales, of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. This framework of distinguishing levels of measurement originated in psychology and has since had a complex history, being adopted and extended in some disciplines and by some scholars, and criticized or rejected by others. Other classifications include those by Mosteller and Tukey, and by Chrisman.

== Stevens&#x27;s typology ==
=== Overview ===
Stevens proposed his typology in a 1946 &quot;Science&quot; article titled &quot;On the theory of scales of measurement&quot;. In that article, Stevens claimed that all measurement in science was conducted using four different types of scales that he called &quot;nominal&quot;, &quot;ordinal&quot;, &quot;interval&quot;, and &quot;ratio&quot;, unifying both &quot;qualitative&quot; (which are described by his &quot;nominal&quot; type) and &quot;quantitative&quot; (to a different degree, all the rest of his scales). The concept of scale types later received the mathematical rigour that it lacked at its inception with the work of mathematical psychologists Theodore Alper (1985, 1987), Louis Narens (1981a, b), and R. Duncan Luce (1986, 1987, 2001). As Luce (1997, p. 395) wrote:
==== Comparison ====
=== Nominal level === 
A nominal scale consists only of a number of distinct classes or categories, for example: [Cat, Dog, Rabbit]. Unlike the other scales, no kind of relationship between the classes can be relied upon. Thus measuring with the nominal scale is equivalent to classifying. 

Nominal measurement may differentiate between items or subjects based only on their names or (meta-)categories and other qualitative classifications they belong to. Thus it has been argued that even dichotomous data relies on a constructivist epistemology. In this case, discovery of an exception to a classification can be viewed as progress. 

Numbers may be used to represent the variables but the numbers do not have numerical value or relationship: for example, a globally unique identifier.

Examples of these classifications include gender, nationality, ethnicity, language, genre, style, biological species, and form. In a university one could also use residence hall or department affiliation as examples. Other concrete examples are 
* in grammar, the parts of speech: noun, verb, preposition, article, pronoun, etc.
* in politics, power projection: hard power, soft power, etc.
* in biology, the taxonomic ranks below domains: kingdom, phylum, class, etc.
* in software engineering, type of fault: specification faults, design faults, and code faults

Nominal scales were often called qualitative scales, and measurements made on qualitative scales were called qualitative data. However, the rise of qualitative research has made this usage confusing. If numbers are assigned as labels in nominal measurement, they have no specific numerical value or meaning. No form of arithmetic computation (+, −, ×, etc.) may be performed on nominal measures. The nominal level is the lowest measurement level used from a statistical point of view.

====Mathematical operations====
Equality and other operations that can be defined in terms of equality, such as inequality and set membership, are the only non-trivial operations that generically apply to objects of the nominal type.

====Central tendency====
The mode, i.e. the &quot;most common&quot; item, is allowed as the measure of central tendency for the nominal type. On the other hand, the median, i.e. the &quot;middle-ranked&quot; item, makes no sense for the nominal type of data since ranking is meaningless for the nominal type.

===Ordinal scale===

The ordinal type allows for rank order (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) by which data can be sorted but still does not allow for a relative &quot;degree of difference&quot; between them. Examples include, on one hand, dichotomous data with dichotomous (or dichotomized) values such as &quot;sick&quot; vs. &quot;healthy&quot; when measuring health, &quot;guilty&quot; vs. &quot;not-guilty&quot; when making judgments in courts, &quot;wrong/false&quot; vs. &quot;right/true&quot; when measuring truth value, and, on the other hand, non-dichotomous data consisting of a spectrum of values, such as &quot;completely agree&quot;, &quot;mostly agree&quot;, &quot;mostly disagree&quot;, &quot;completely disagree&quot; when measuring opinion.

The ordinal scale places events in order, but there is no attempt to make the intervals of the scale equal in terms of some rule. Rank orders represent ordinal scales and are frequently used in research relating to qualitative phenomena. A student&#x27;s rank in his graduation class involves the use of an ordinal scale. One has to be very careful in making a statement about scores based on ordinal scales. For instance, if Devi&#x27;s position in his class is 10th and Ganga&#x27;s position is 40th, it cannot be said that Devi&#x27;s position is four times as good as that of Ganga.
Ordinal scales only permit the ranking of items from highest to lowest. Ordinal measures have no absolute values, and the real differences between adjacent ranks may not be equal. All that can be said is that one person is higher or lower on the scale than another, but more precise comparisons cannot be made. Thus, the use of an ordinal scale implies a statement of &quot;greater than&quot; or &quot;less than&quot; (an equality statement is also acceptable) without our being able to state how much greater or less. The real difference between ranks 1 and 2, for instance, may be more or less than the difference between ranks 5 and 6. Since the numbers of this scale have only a rank meaning, the appropriate measure of central tendency is the median. A percentile or quartile measure is used for measuring dispersion. Correlations are restricted to various rank order methods. Measures of statistical significance are restricted to the non-parametric methods (R. M. Kothari, 2004).

==== Central tendency ====
The median, i.e. &quot;middle-ranked&quot;, item is allowed as the measure of central tendency; however, the mean (or average) as the measure of central tendency is not allowed. The mode is allowed.

In 1946, Stevens observed that psychological measurement, such as measurement of opinions, usually operates on ordinal scales; thus means and standard deviations have no validity, but they can be used to get ideas for how to improve operationalization of variables used in questionnaires. Most psychological data collected by psychometric instruments and tests, measuring cognitive and other abilities, are ordinal, although some theoreticians have argued they can be treated as interval or ratio scales. However, there is little prima facie evidence to suggest that such attributes are anything more than ordinal (Cliff, 1996; Cliff &amp; Keats, 2003; Michell, 2008). In particular, IQ scores reflect an ordinal scale, in which all scores are meaningful for comparison only. There is no absolute zero, and a 10-point difference may carry different meanings at different points of the scale.

===Interval scale===
The interval type allows for defining the &quot;degree of difference&quot; between measurements, but not the ratio between measurements. Examples include &quot;temperature scales&quot; with the Celsius scale, which has two defined points (the freezing and boiling point of water at specific conditions) and then separated into 100 intervals, &quot;date&quot; when measured from an arbitrary epoch (such as AD), &quot;location&quot; in Cartesian coordinates, and &quot;direction&quot; measured in degrees from true or magnetic north. Ratios are not meaningful since 20 °C cannot be said to be &quot;twice as hot&quot; as 10 °C (unlike temperature in kelvins), nor can multiplication/division be carried out between any two dates directly. However, &quot;ratios of differences&quot; can be expressed; for example, one difference can be twice another; for example, the ten-degree difference between 15 °C and 25 °C is twice the five-degree difference between 17 °C and 22 °C. Interval type variables are sometimes also called &quot;scaled variables&quot;, but the formal mathematical term is an affine space (in this case an affine line).

====Central tendency and statistical dispersion====
The mode, median, and arithmetic mean are allowed to measure central tendency of interval variables, while measures of statistical dispersion include range and standard deviation. Since one can only divide by &quot;differences&quot;, one cannot define measures that require some ratios, such as the coefficient of variation. More subtly, while one can define moments about the origin, only central moments are meaningful, since the choice of origin is arbitrary. One can define standardized moments, since ratios of differences are meaningful, but one cannot define the coefficient of variation, since the mean is a moment about the origin, unlike the standard deviation, which is (the square root of) a central moment.

=== Ratio scale ===
:&quot;See also&quot;: 

The ratio type takes its name from the fact that measurement is the estimation of the ratio between a magnitude of a continuous quantity and a unit of measurement of the same kind (Michell, 1997, 1999). Most measurement in the physical sciences and engineering is done on ratio scales. Examples include mass, length, duration, plane angle, energy and electric charge. In contrast to interval scales, ratios can be compared using division. Very informally, many ratio scales can be described as specifying &quot;how much&quot; of something (i.e. an amount or magnitude). Ratio scale is often used to express an order of magnitude such as for temperature in Orders of magnitude (temperature).

==== Central tendency and statistical dispersion ====
The geometric mean and the harmonic mean are allowed to measure the central tendency, in addition to the mode, median, and arithmetic mean. The studentized range and the coefficient of variation are allowed to measure statistical dispersion. All statistical measures are allowed because all necessary mathematical operations are defined for the ratio scale.

== Debate on Stevens&#x27;s typology ==
While Stevens&#x27;s typology is widely adopted, it is still being challenged by other theoreticians, particularly in the cases of the nominal and ordinal types (Michell, 1986). Duncan (1986), for example, objected to the use of the word &quot;measurement&quot; in relation to the nominal type and Luce (1997) disagreed with Stevens&#x27;s definition of measurement.

On the other hand, Stevens (1975) said of his own definition of measurement that &quot;the assignment can be any consistent rule. The only rule not allowed would be random assignment, for randomness amounts in effect to a nonrule&quot;. Hand says, &quot;Basic psychology texts often begin with Stevens&#x27;s framework and the ideas are ubiquitous. Indeed, the essential soundness of his hierarchy has been established for representational measurement by mathematicians, determining the invariance properties of mappings from empirical systems to real number continua. Certainly the ideas have been revised, extended, and elaborated, but the remarkable thing is his insight given the relatively limited formal apparatus available to him and how many decades have passed since he coined them.&quot;

The use of the mean as a measure of the central tendency for the ordinal type is still debatable among those who accept Stevens&#x27;s typology. Many behavioural scientists use the mean for ordinal data anyway. This is often justified on the basis that the ordinal type in behavioural science is in fact somewhere between the true ordinal and interval types; although the interval difference between two ordinal ranks is not constant, it is often of the same order of magnitude.

For example, applications of measurement models in educational contexts often indicate that total scores have a fairly linear relationship with measurements across the range of an assessment. Thus, some argue that so long as the unknown interval difference between ordinal scale ranks is not too variable, interval scale statistics such as means can meaningfully be used on ordinal scale variables. Statistical analysis software such as SPSS requires the user to select the appropriate measurement class for each variable. This ensures that subsequent user errors cannot inadvertently perform meaningless analyses (for example correlation analysis with a variable on a nominal level).

L. L. Thurstone made progress toward developing a justification for obtaining the interval type, based on the law of comparative judgment. A common application of the law is the analytic hierarchy process. Further progress was made by Georg Rasch (1960), who developed the probabilistic Rasch model that provides a theoretical basis and justification for obtaining interval-level measurements from counts of observations such as total scores on assessments.

===Other proposed typologies===
Typologies aside from Stevens&#x27;s typology have been proposed. For instance, Mosteller and Tukey (1977) and Nelder (1990) described continuous counts, continuous ratios, count ratios, and categorical modes of data. See also Chrisman (1998), van den Berg (1991).

==== Mosteller and Tukey&#x27;s typology (1977) ====
Mosteller and Tukey noted that the four levels are not exhaustive and proposed seven instead:
# Names
# Grades (ordered labels like beginner, intermediate, advanced)
# Ranks (orders with 1 being the smallest or largest, 2 the next smallest or largest, and so on)
# Counted fractions (bound by 0 and 1)
# Counts (non-negative integers)
# Amounts (non-negative real numbers)
# Balances (any real number)

For example, percentages (a variation on fractions in the Mosteller–Tukey framework) do not fit well into Stevens&#x27;s framework: No transformation is fully admissible.

==== Chrisman&#x27;s typology (1998) ====
Nicholas R. Chrisman introduced an expanded list of levels of measurement to account for various measurements that do not necessarily fit with the traditional notions of levels of measurement. Measurements bound to a range and repeating (like degrees in a circle, clock time, etc.), graded membership categories, and other types of measurement do not fit to Stevens&#x27;s original work, leading to the introduction of six new levels of measurement, for a total of ten:
# Nominal
# Gradation of membership
# Ordinal
# Interval
# Log-interval
# Extensive ratio
# Cyclical ratio
# Derived ratio
# Counts
# Absolute

While some claim that the extended levels of measurement are rarely used outside of academic geography, graded membership is central to fuzzy set theory, while absolute measurements include probabilities and the plausibility and ignorance in Dempster–Shafer theory. Cyclical ratio measurements include angles and times. Counts appear to be ratio measurements, but the scale is not arbitrary and fractional counts are commonly meaningless. Log-interval measurements are commonly displayed in stock market graphics. All these types of measurements are commonly used outside academic geography, and do not fit well to Stevens&#x27;s original work.

=== Scale types and Stevens&#x27;s &quot;operational theory of measurement&quot; ===
The theory of scale types is the intellectual handmaiden to Stevens&#x27;s &quot;operational theory of measurement&quot;, which was to become definitive within psychology and the behavioral sciences, despite Michell&#x27;s characterization as its being quite at odds with measurement in the natural sciences (Michell, 1999). Essentially, the operational theory of measurement was a reaction to the conclusions of a committee established in 1932 by the British Association for the Advancement of Science to investigate the possibility of genuine scientific measurement in the psychological and behavioral sciences. This committee, which became known as the &quot;Ferguson committee&quot;, published a Final Report (Ferguson, et al., 1940, p. 245) in which Stevens&#x27;s sone scale (Stevens &amp; Davis, 1938) was an object of criticism:

That is, if Stevens&#x27;s &quot;sone&quot; scale genuinely measured the intensity of auditory sensations, then evidence for such sensations as being quantitative attributes needed to be produced. The evidence needed was the presence of &quot;additive structure&quot;—a concept comprehensively treated by the German mathematician Otto Hölder (Hölder, 1901). Given that the physicist and measurement theorist Norman Robert Campbell dominated the Ferguson committee&#x27;s deliberations, the committee concluded that measurement in the social sciences was impossible due to the lack of concatenation operations. This conclusion was later rendered false by the discovery of the theory of conjoint measurement by Debreu (1960) and independently by Luce &amp; Tukey (1964). However, Stevens&#x27;s reaction was not to conduct experiments to test for the presence of additive structure in sensations, but instead to render the conclusions of the Ferguson committee null and void by proposing a new theory of measurement:

Stevens was greatly influenced by the ideas of another Harvard academic, the Nobel laureate physicist Percy Bridgman (1927), whose doctrine of operationalism Stevens used to define measurement. In Stevens&#x27;s definition, for example, it is the use of a tape measure that defines length (the object of measurement) as being measurable (and so by implication quantitative). Critics of operationalism object that it confuses the relations between two objects or events for properties of one of those of objects or events (Moyer, 1981a, b; Rogers, 1989).

The Canadian measurement theorist William Rozeboom was an early and trenchant critic of Stevens&#x27;s theory of scale types.

==== Same variable may be different scale type depending on context ====
Another issue is that the same variable may be a different scale type depending on how it is measured and on the goals of the analysis. For example, hair color is usually thought of as a nominal variable, since it has no apparent ordering. However, it is possible to order colors (including hair colors) in various ways, including by hue; this is known as colorimetry. Hue is an interval level variable.

<text>In statistics, a categorical variable (also called qualitative variable) is a variable that can take on one of a limited, and usually fixed, number of possible values, assigning each individual or other unit of observation to a particular group or nominal category on the basis of some qualitative property. In computer science and some branches of mathematics, categorical variables are referred to as enumerations or enumerated types. Commonly (though not in this article), each of the possible values of a categorical variable is referred to as a level. The probability distribution associated with a random categorical variable is called a categorical distribution.

Categorical data is the statistical data type consisting of categorical variables or of data that has been converted into that form, for example as grouped data. More specifically, categorical data may derive from observations made of qualitative data that are summarised as counts or cross tabulations, or from observations of quantitative data grouped within given intervals. Often, purely categorical data are summarised in the form of a contingency table. However, particularly when considering data analysis, it is common to use the term &quot;categorical data&quot; to apply to data sets that, while containing some categorical variables, may also contain non-categorical variables. Ordinal variables have a meaningful ordering, while nominal variables have no meaningful ordering.

A categorical variable that can take on exactly two values is termed a &quot;binary variable&quot; or a dichotomous variable; an important special case is the Bernoulli variable. Categorical variables with more than two possible values are called polytomous variables; categorical variables are often assumed to be polytomous unless otherwise specified. Discretization is treating continuous data as if it were categorical. Dichotomization is treating continuous data or polytomous variables as if they were binary variables. Regression analysis often treats category membership with one or more quantitative dummy variables.

==Examples of categorical variables==
Examples of values that might be represented in a categorical variable:
*Demographic information of a population: gender, disease status.
*The blood type of a person: A, B, AB or O.
*The political party that a voter might vote for, e.g. &quot;Green Party&quot;, &quot;Christian Democrat&quot;, &quot;Social Democrat&quot;, etc.
*The type of a rock: igneous, sedimentary or metamorphic.
*The identity of a particular word (e.g., in a language model): One of &quot;V&quot; possible choices, for a vocabulary of size &quot;V&quot;.

==Notation==
For ease in statistical processing, categorical variables may be assigned numeric indices, e.g. 1 through &quot;K&quot; for a &quot;K&quot;-way categorical variable (i.e. a variable that can express exactly &quot;K&quot; possible values). In general, however, the numbers are arbitrary, and have no significance beyond simply providing a convenient label for a particular value. In other words, the values in a categorical variable exist on a nominal scale: they each represent a logically separate concept, cannot necessarily be meaningfully ordered, and cannot be otherwise manipulated as numbers could be. Instead, valid operations are equivalence, set membership, and other set-related operations.

As a result, the central tendency of a set of categorical variables is given by its mode; neither the mean nor the median can be defined. As an example, given a set of people, we can consider the set of categorical variables corresponding to their last names. We can consider operations such as equivalence (whether two people have the same last name), set membership (whether a person has a name in a given list), counting (how many people have a given last name), or finding the mode (which name occurs most often). However, we cannot meaningfully compute the &quot;sum&quot; of Smith + Johnson, or ask whether Smith is &quot;less than&quot; or &quot;greater than&quot; Johnson. As a result, we cannot meaningfully ask what the &quot;average name&quot; (the mean) or the &quot;middle-most name&quot; (the median) is in a set of names.

This ignores the concept of alphabetical order, which is a property that is not inherent in the names themselves, but in the way we construct the labels. For example, if we write the names in Cyrillic and consider the Cyrillic ordering of letters, we might get a different result of evaluating &quot;Smith &lt; Johnson&quot; than if we write the names in the standard Latin alphabet; and if we write the names in Chinese characters, we cannot meaningfully evaluate &quot;Smith &lt; Johnson&quot; at all, because no consistent ordering is defined for such characters. However, if we do consider the names as written, e.g., in the Latin alphabet, and define an ordering corresponding to standard alphabetical order, then we have effectively converted them into ordinal variables defined on an ordinal scale.

==Number of possible values==
Categorical random variables are normally described statistically by a categorical distribution, which allows an arbitrary &quot;K&quot;-way categorical variable to be expressed with separate probabilities specified for each of the &quot;K&quot; possible outcomes. Such multiple-category categorical variables are often analyzed using a multinomial distribution, which counts the frequency of each possible combination of numbers of occurrences of the various categories. Regression analysis on categorical outcomes is accomplished through multinomial logistic regression, multinomial probit or a related type of discrete choice model.

Categorical variables that have only two possible outcomes (e.g., &quot;yes&quot; vs. &quot;no&quot; or &quot;success&quot; vs. &quot;failure&quot;) are known as &quot;binary variables&quot; (or &quot;Bernoulli variables&quot;). Because of their importance, these variables are often considered a separate category, with a separate distribution (the Bernoulli distribution) and separate regression models (logistic regression, probit regression, etc.). As a result, the term &quot;categorical variable&quot; is often reserved for cases with 3 or more outcomes, sometimes termed a &quot;multi-way&quot; variable in opposition to a binary variable.

It is also possible to consider categorical variables where the number of categories is not fixed in advance. As an example, for a categorical variable describing a particular word, we might not know in advance the size of the vocabulary, and we would like to allow for the possibility of encountering words that we have not already seen. Standard statistical models, such as those involving the categorical distribution and multinomial logistic regression, assume that the number of categories is known in advance, and changing the number of categories on the fly is tricky. In such cases, more advanced techniques must be used. An example is the Dirichlet process, which falls in the realm of nonparametric statistics. In such a case, it is logically assumed that an infinite number of categories exist, but at any one time most of them (in fact, all but a finite number) have never been seen. All formulas are phrased in terms of the number of categories actually seen so far rather than the (infinite) total number of potential categories in existence, and methods are created for incremental updating of statistical distributions, including adding &quot;new&quot; categories.

==Categorical variables and regression==

Categorical variables represent a qualitative method of scoring data (i.e. represents categories or group membership). These can be included as independent variables in a regression analysis or as dependent variables in logistic regression or probit regression, but must be converted to quantitative data in order to be able to analyze the data. One does so through the use of coding systems. Analyses are conducted such that only &quot;g&quot; -1 (&quot;g&quot; being the number of groups) are coded. This minimizes redundancy while still representing the complete data set as no additional information would be gained from coding the total &quot;g&quot; groups: for example, when coding gender (where &quot;g&quot; = 2: male and female), if we only code females everyone left over would necessarily be males. In general, the group that one does not code for is the group of least interest.

There are three main coding systems typically used in the analysis of categorical variables in regression: dummy coding, effects coding, and contrast coding. The regression equation takes the form of Y = bX + a, where &quot;b&quot; is the slope and gives the weight empirically assigned to an explanator, &quot;X&quot; is the explanatory variable, and &quot;a&quot; is the &quot;Y&quot;-intercept, and these values take on different meanings based on the coding system used. The choice of coding system does not affect the &quot;F&quot; or &quot;R&quot;2 statistics. However, one chooses a coding system based on the comparison of interest since the interpretation of &quot;b&quot; values will vary.

===Dummy coding===

Dummy coding is used when there is a control or comparison group in mind. One is therefore analyzing the data of one group in relation to the comparison group: &quot;a&quot; represents the mean of the control group and &quot;b&quot; is the difference between the mean of the experimental group and the mean of the control group. It is suggested that three criteria be met for specifying a suitable control group: the group should be a well-established group (e.g. should not be an &quot;other&quot; category), there should be a logical reason for selecting this group as a comparison (e.g. the group is anticipated to score highest on the dependent variable), and finally, the group&#x27;s sample size should be substantive and not small compared to the other groups.

In dummy coding, the reference group is assigned a value of 0 for each code variable, the group of interest for comparison to the reference group is assigned a value of 1 for its specified code variable, while all other groups are assigned 0 for that particular code variable.

The &quot;b&quot; values should be interpreted such that the experimental group is being compared against the control group. Therefore, yielding a negative b value would entail the experimental group have scored less than the control group on the dependent variable. To illustrate this, suppose that we are measuring optimism among several nationalities and we have decided that French people would serve as a useful control. If we are comparing them against Italians, and we observe a negative &quot;b&quot; value, this would suggest Italians obtain lower optimism scores on average.

The following table is an example of dummy coding with &quot;French&quot; as the control group and C1, C2, and C3 respectively being the codes for &quot;Italian&quot;, &quot;German&quot;, and &quot;Other&quot; (neither French nor Italian nor German):

===Effects coding===

In the effects coding system, data are analyzed through comparing one group to all other groups. Unlike dummy coding, there is no control group. Rather, the comparison is being made at the mean of all groups combined (&quot;a&quot; is now the grand mean). Therefore, one is not looking for data in relation to another group but rather, one is seeking data in relation to the grand mean.

Effects coding can either be weighted or unweighted. Weighted effects coding is simply calculating a weighted grand mean, thus taking into account the sample size in each variable. This is most appropriate in situations where the sample is representative of the population in question. Unweighted effects coding is most appropriate in situations where differences in sample size are the result of incidental factors. The interpretation of &quot;b&quot; is different for each: in unweighted effects coding &quot;b&quot; is the difference between the mean of the experimental group and the grand mean, whereas in the weighted situation it is the mean of the experimental group minus the weighted grand mean.

In effects coding, we code the group of interest with a 1, just as we would for dummy coding. The principal difference is that we code −1 for the group we are least interested in. Since we continue to use a &quot;g&quot; - 1 coding scheme, it is in fact the −1 coded group that will not produce data, hence the fact that we are least interested in that group. A code of 0 is assigned to all other groups.

The &quot;b&quot; values should be interpreted such that the experimental group is being compared against the mean of all groups combined (or weighted grand mean in the case of weighted effects coding). Therefore, yielding a negative &quot;b&quot; value would entail the coded group as having scored less than the mean of all groups on the dependent variable. Using our previous example of optimism scores among nationalities, if the group of interest is Italians, observing a negative &quot;b&quot; value suggest they obtain a lower optimism score.

The following table is an example of effects coding with &quot;Other&quot; as the group of least interest.

===Contrast coding===

The contrast coding system allows a researcher to directly ask specific questions. Rather than having the coding system dictate the comparison being made (i.e., against a control group as in dummy coding, or against all groups as in effects coding) one can design a unique comparison catering to one&#x27;s specific research question. This tailored hypothesis is generally based on previous theory and/or research. The hypotheses proposed are generally as follows: first, there is the central hypothesis which postulates a large difference between two sets of groups; the second hypothesis suggests that within each set, the differences among the groups are small. Through its a priori focused hypotheses, contrast coding may yield an increase in power of the statistical test when compared with the less directed previous coding systems.

Certain differences emerge when we compare our a priori coefficients between ANOVA and regression. Unlike when used in ANOVA, where it is at the researcher&#x27;s discretion whether they choose coefficient values that are either orthogonal or non-orthogonal, in regression, it is essential that the coefficient values assigned in contrast coding be orthogonal. Furthermore, in regression, coefficient values must be either in fractional or decimal form. They cannot take on interval values.

The construction of contrast codes is restricted by three rules:

# The sum of the contrast coefficients per each code variable must equal zero.
# The difference between the sum of the positive coefficients and the sum of the negative coefficients should equal 1.
# Coded variables should be orthogonal.

Violating rule 2 produces accurate &quot;R&quot;2 and &quot;F&quot; values, indicating that we would reach the same conclusions about whether or not there is a significant difference; however, we can no longer interpret the &quot;b&quot; values as a mean difference.

To illustrate the construction of contrast codes consider the following table. Coefficients were chosen to illustrate our a priori hypotheses: Hypothesis 1: French and Italian persons will score higher on optimism than Germans (French = +0.33, Italian = +0.33, German = −0.66). This is illustrated through assigning the same coefficient to the French and Italian categories and a different one to the Germans. The signs assigned indicate the direction of the relationship (hence giving Germans a negative sign is indicative of their lower hypothesized optimism scores). Hypothesis 2: French and Italians are expected to differ on their optimism scores (French = +0.50, Italian = −0.50, German = 0). Here, assigning a zero value to Germans demonstrates their non-inclusion in the analysis of this hypothesis. Again, the signs assigned are indicative of the proposed relationship.

===Nonsense coding===

Nonsense coding occurs when one uses arbitrary values in place of the designated &quot;0&quot;s &quot;1&quot;s and &quot;-1&quot;s seen in the previous coding systems. Although it produces correct mean values for the variables, the use of nonsense coding is not recommended as it will lead to uninterpretable statistical results.

===Embeddings===
&quot;Embeddings&quot; are codings of categorical values into low-dimensional real-valued (sometimes complex-valued) vector spaces, usually in such a way that ‘similar’ values are assigned ‘similar’ vectors, or with respect to some other kind of criterion making the vectors useful for the respective application. A common special case are word embeddings, where the possible values of the categorical variable are the words in a language and words with similar meanings are to be assigned similar vectors.

===Interactions===

An interaction may arise when considering the relationship among three or more variables, and describes a situation in which the simultaneous influence of two variables on a third is not additive. Interactions may arise with categorical variables in two ways: either categorical by categorical variable interactions, or categorical by continuous variable interactions.

====Categorical by categorical variable interactions====

This type of interaction arises when we have two categorical variables. In order to probe this type of interaction, one would code using the system that addresses the researcher&#x27;s hypothesis most appropriately. The product of the codes yields the interaction. One may then calculate the &quot;b&quot; value and determine whether the interaction is significant.

====Categorical by continuous variable interactions====

Simple slopes analysis is a common post hoc test used in regression which is similar to the simple effects analysis in ANOVA, used to analyze interactions. In this test, we are examining the simple slopes of one independent variable at specific values of the other independent variable. Such a test is not limited to use with continuous variables, but may also be employed when the independent variable is categorical. We cannot simply choose values to probe the interaction as we would in the continuous variable case because of the nominal nature of the data (i.e., in the continuous case, one could analyze the data at high, moderate, and low levels assigning 1 standard deviation above the mean, at the mean, and at one standard deviation below the mean respectively). In our categorical case we would use a simple regression equation for each group to investigate the simple slopes. It is common practice to standardize or center variables to make the data more interpretable in simple slopes analysis; however, categorical variables should never be standardized or centered. This test can be used with all coding systems.

<text>Charles Osgood Wood III (January 8, 1933 – January 23, 2024) was an American radio and television commentator, writer, and musician. Osgood was best known both for being the host of &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot;, a role he held for over 22 years from April 10, 1994, until September 25, 2016, and &quot;The Osgood File&quot;, a series of daily radio commentaries he hosted from 1971 until December 29, 2017.

Osgood was also known for being the narrator of &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot;, an animated film released in 2008, based on the book of the same name by Dr. Seuss. He published a memoir of his boyhood in 2004.

==Early life and education==
Osgood was born in Manhattan, New York City, on January 8, 1933. As a child, he moved with his family to the Liberty Heights neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland. He attended St. Cecilia High School in Englewood, New Jersey.

His memoir about growing up in Baltimore during World War II is called &quot;Defending Baltimore Against Enemy Attack&quot; (2004) and in it he recounts his perspective from age nine.

Osgood graduated from Fordham University in 1954 with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics.

==Early career==
===WFUV Radio===
While attending Fordham, Osgood volunteered at the university&#x27;s FM campus radio station, WFUV. He often played piano between records on his shows and frequently collaborated with other students, including future actor Alan Alda and future producer and director Jack Haley, Jr.

===United States Army Band===
Immediately after graduating from Fordham University, Osgood was hired as an announcer by WGMS (AM) and WGMS-FM, the classical music stations in Washington, D.C. (today WWRC and WTOP-FM respectively). Shortly afterward, however, he enlisted in the military to be the announcer for the United States Army Band. In 1991, he explained this turn of events in an interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times.&quot;

Besides acting as the band&#x27;s master of ceremonies, he performed as a pianist with the band and sang with the United States Army Chorus.

His roommate, John Cacavas, composed arrangements for the band. They would collaborate on many songs, a relationship that would continue through the 1960s. In 1967, along with U.S. Senator Everett Dirksen (R- Illinois), they shared a Grammy Award for best spoken word performance for their single &quot;Gallant Men.&quot; As Dirksen read a patriotic poem written by H. Paul Jeffers about the dignity of duty in the armed forces, it was framed by Cacavas and Osgood&#x27;s martial music and stirring choral refrains. In 1967 it peaked at number 16 on the Billboard 200 record chart.

===Other work===
Stationed adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery at Fort Myer during his service with the U.S. Army Band, using pseudonyms, Osgood worked as an announcer for radio stations in the Washington area to supplement his income and experience. He hosted the morning show on WEAM (WZHF today) as &quot;Charlie Woods.&quot; At WGMS, he called himself &quot;Carl Walden.&quot; At WPGC (AM) (WJFK (AM) today), a rock station, he referred to himself as &quot;Chuck Forest.&quot;

In September 1955, President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered a serious heart attack during a vacation in Denver, Colorado, and was confined to a hospital room there until November. During this time, under the auspices of WGMS, Osgood hosted a closed-circuit program of classical music delivered exclusively to the president&#x27;s room to encourage his relaxation and convalescence.

===WGMS Radio===
When his tour with the U.S. Army Band was completed, in October 1957, Osgood returned to WGMS full-time as announcer Charles Wood and as a special assistant to the general manager. Before the end of 1958, WGMS promoted him to program director.

In 1960, credited by name and as a WGMS announcer, he provided introductions and commentary on a six-record album of a collection of thirty-three speeches by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt titled &quot;FDR Speaks.&quot; Edited by historian Henry Steele Commager, it included a welcome by the president&#x27;s widow, former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt. Their son Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Jr. recited one of his father&#x27;s speeches. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine reported that &quot;FDR Speaks&quot; &quot;was one of the most listened-to-attractions&quot; at the 1960 Democratic National Convention which nominated senators John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson as its candidates for President and Vice President of the United States.

===WHCT Television===
In April 1962, the parent company of WGMS, RKO General, transferred Osgood to Hartford, Connecticut, and promoted him to his first job in television: the general manager of Channel 18, WHCT (WUVN today).

WHCT was the first TV station in the United States to be licensed to use Phonevision, a system developed by Zenith that scrambled the station&#x27;s picture and sound. This limited viewing to paid subscribers who were issued decoders attached to their television sets and telephone lines. The station offered its subscribers premium programming such as first-run movies, live sporting events, and cultural programs like ballets and symphonies, all with no commercials. Although RKO expected to operate WHCT at a loss for the three years before the Federal Communications Commission was due to renew the station&#x27;s license, by early 1963, the financial realities became too difficult to bear unabated. In a 1985 interview with &quot;Broadcasting&quot; magazine, Osgood explained:

[The station] lost money at an alarming rate ... [RKO] let me off the hook very gently. They said, &quot;you&#x27;re fired.&quot;

===ABC===
Unemployed at age 30, Osgood turned to one of his Fordham classmates, Frank McGuire, who directed program development at ABC in New York. In 1963, McGuire hired Osgood to be one of the writers and hosts of &quot;Flair Reports&quot;, which related human interest stories on the ABC Radio Network.

&quot;I went from being the world&#x27;s youngest station manager to being the world&#x27;s oldest cub reporter&quot;, he quipped in a 1981 interview with &quot;People&quot; magazine.

Another new McGuire hire for &quot;Flair Reports&quot;, whom Osgood befriended at ABC, was Ted Koppel.

====Becoming &quot;Charles Osgood&quot;====
While he was at ABC, he began using the name &quot;Charles Osgood&quot; because the network already had an announcer named &quot;Charles Woods&quot;. In a 2005 interview with &quot;Inside Radio&quot;, Osgood related the story:

They didn&#x27;t want to have a Charles Woods and a Charles Wood. When they told me to pick a name, I used my middle name as my last name. It&#x27;s worked out well and is a little more distinctive and professional.

==Later career at CBS==
===Radio===
Osgood moved over to CBS Radio in 1967 when it became clear, in his words, that he &quot;wasn&#x27;t going anywhere&quot; at ABC. He worked as a reporter and anchor for WCBS. In August 1967, he anchored the first morning drive shift for WCBS after its conversion to an all-news format. The first day of all-news programming aired on WCBS-FM after an airplane crashed into the AM station&#x27;s antenna tower on New York&#x27;s High Island, keeping WCBS off air until a temporary tower could be erected.

Osgood anchored &quot;The Osgood File&quot; on of Westwood One, a daily commentary morning show. It began as a segment on WCBS in 1967 and went national in 1971. Each three-minute &quot;Osgood File&quot; focused on a single story, ranging from a breaking development of national importance to a whimsical human-interest vignette. Some of those he did in rhyme, which is why he was known as CBS&#x27;s &quot;Poet in Residence.&quot; He continued these broadcasts until December 29, 2017.

=== Television ===
On television, Osgood joined CBS News in 1971. He was a reporter, and served as anchor of the &quot;CBS Sunday Night News&quot; from 1981 to 1987, co-anchor of the weekday &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; and frequent news reader on &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; from 1987 to 1992, as well as occasional anchor of the &quot;CBS Afternoon News&quot; and the &quot;CBS Evening News with Dan Rather&quot;.

Osgood hosted &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot; from April 10, 1994, to September 25, 2016, succeeding the original host Charles Kuralt. Osgood&#x27;s tenure of twenty-two years as host exceeded Kuralt&#x27;s fifteen years.

Among Osgood&#x27;s personal trademarks were his bow tie, his weekly TV signoff &quot;Until then, I&#x27;ll see you on the radio&quot;, and his propensity for delivering his commentaries in whimsical verse. Example: When the Census Bureau invented a designation for cohabitant(s) as &quot;Person(s) of Opposite Sex Sharing Living Quarters&quot;, or &quot;POSSLQ&quot;, Osgood turned it into a pronounceable three-syllable word and composed a prospective love poem that included these lines, which he later used as the title of one of his books:

=== End of broadcasting career ===
On December 21, 2017, it was announced Osgood would retire from &quot;The Osgood File&quot; due to health concerns, ending his broadcast career. His final broadcasts were on December 29, 2017.

==Other works==
In 1956, Osgood wrote a three-act play called &quot;A Single Voice&quot;. 

Osgood was the narrator in the 2008 animated film &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot;.

Osgood wrote a biweekly syndicated newspaper column. He authored seven books:
*&quot;Nothing Could Be Finer Than a Crisis That Is Minor in the Morning&quot; (Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, 1979)
*&quot;There&#x27;s Nothing That I Wouldn&#x27;t Do If You Would Be My POSSLQ&quot; (Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, 1981)
*&quot;Osgood on Speaking: How to Think on Your Feet Without Falling on Your Face&quot; (William Morrow and Company, 1988)
*&quot;The Osgood Files&quot; (G.P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons, 1991)
*&quot;See You on the Radio&quot; (G.P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons, 1999)
*&quot;Defending Baltimore Against Enemy Attack&quot; (Hyperion, 2004).
*&quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the White House&quot; (Hyperion, 2008).

He also edited two books:
*&quot;Kilroy Was Here&quot; (Hyperion, 2001).
*&quot;Funny Letters From Famous People&quot; (Broadway Books, 2003).

==Personal life and death==
Osgood&#x27;s first marriage to Theresa Audette ended in divorce after 16 years. He and his second wife, Jeanne Crafton, had five children, who were raised in Englewood, New Jersey. When they became empty nesters, Osgood and his wife moved to a 12-room duplex on West 57th Street at 7th Avenue in New York City.

Osgood died from complications of dementia at his home in Saddle River, New Jersey, on January 23, 2024, at age 91. &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot; dedicated its full January 28, 2024, broadcast to celebrating Osgood&#x27;s life and work.

<doc id="821181" wikidata="Q3210756" url="?curid=821181" title="Inca Mummy Girl">
<text>&quot;Inca Mummy Girl&quot; is episode four of season two of the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, originally airing on The WB on October 6, 1997. The episode was written by former series story editors Matt Kiene and Joe Reinkemeyer (penning their second and final script for the show) and directed by Ellen S. Pressman, inspired by the story of Momia Juanita, a real mummy discovered on the extinct volcano Ampato near Arequipa, Peru, in 1995. The narrative revolves around a cultural exchange event at Sunnydale High, involving a museum exhibit, a dance, and foreign exchange students, two of whom stay with Buffy and Cordelia.

==Plot==
To prepare for Sunnydale High&#x27;s cultural exchange program, Buffy visits an Incan exhibit with her schoolmates. She is paired with an exchange student with whom her mom signed her up. Xander becomes jealous when he learns that she will room with a guy.

The students learn that the mummy in the museum is one of a beautiful Incan princess, sacrificed by her people to save them from destruction. Willow and Buffy express remorse for the princess; dying before she could really live her life. After everyone leaves the museum, a class clown breaks the seal on the mummy while trying to steal it. The princess wakes up, for the curse is broken, and pulls the student into her coffin. She mummifies him by a kiss on the lips. When the Scoobies rush to the museum, cracking uneasy jokes, they encounter a sword-wielding guard and the remains of the missing student.

Buffy&#x27;s exchange student arrives at the bus station, but the mummy girl sucks out his life too. The 500-year-old becomes a beautiful teenager, and poses as &quot;Ampata&quot;, the boy who was supposed to stay with Buffy (everyone simply assumes that the information was wrong on her sex). Xander is smitten with her, and the two begin a relationship.

Giles asks Ampata to decipher the seal from her tomb, and she explains (reluctantly) that it describes a girl chosen to die to save her people, and a bodyguard who will keep her from straying from that path. She also tells Giles to destroy the seal completely. The bodyguard appears again and again, trying to stop Ampata, until she finally manages to use her kiss on him in the bathroom, sucking out his life to keep herself from dying.

Buffy and Ampata bond over the tale of the Inca Princess, Ampata stating that the princess was forced into her destiny by her people, as they claimed she was the only girl of her generation who could save them; Buffy miserably notes that this parallels her own life. Xander asks Ampata to the dance to enliven her; she gladly accepts. Willow is downcast to see her crush with another girl. Students dress up in &quot;cultural&quot; outfits. The band playing at the dance is Dingoes Ate My Baby, and the lead guitarist, Oz, notices Willow in her Eskimo parka.

Meanwhile, Buffy and Giles open Ampata&#x27;s trunk and discover the real Ampata&#x27;s body. Giles tries to piece together the seal while Buffy tries to save Xander from Ampata&#x27;s deadly kiss. But Ampata feels too much for Xander and leaves for the museum. She tries to stop Giles from reconstructing the seal. Buffy shows up to fight her but is tossed into Ampata&#x27;s sarcophagus alongside Giles. When Ampata tries to feed off Willow, Xander shows up and insists that if she must feed on anyone to save her life, it should be him; despite Ampata&#x27;s feelings for him, she reluctantly agrees to do so. However, Ampata hesitates and weakens to the point of returning to her dead form; Buffy pulls her off Xander and she instantly breaks into pieces on the floor.

At school the next day, Buffy consoles Xander and tells him about the parallels between her and Ampata&#x27;s lives and how they were both chosen to die. She then thanks him for saving her from that fate.

==Cast==
* Sarah Michelle Gellar as Buffy Summers
* Nicholas Brendon as Xander Harris
* Alyson Hannigan as Willow Rosenberg
* Charisma Carpenter as Cordelia Chase
* Anthony Stewart Head as Rupert Giles
* Kristine Sutherland as Joyce Summers
* Ara Celi as Ampata Gutierrez / Inca Princess
* Seth Green as Oz
* Jason Hall as Devon MacLeish
* Henrik Rosvall as Sven
* Danny Strong as Jonathan Levinson
* Gil Birmingham as Peru guard

==Themes and metaphors==
The site InsectReflection.com discusses the similarities between two Chosen Ones, specifically with Buffy&#x27;s choice to sacrifice herself for the sake of others in &quot;Prophecy Girl&quot;, while Ampata chooses to live and make others pay that price. Essayist Emily (last name not given) says:

A reviewer for IsPrettyAwesome.com observes that the Mummy Girl&#x27;s &quot;real name is never revealed&quot; (she names herself for the Ampato volcano) and wrote similar sentiments:

Here, the comparison is with Ampata and Xander, rather than with Ampata and Angel: &quot;The climax brings Xander&#x27;s and IMG&#x27;s respective selfishnesses into collision. Xander is the one who demands the Inca Mummy Girl leave Willow alone – if she&#x27;s going to murder anyone, it&#x27;s got to be him. It&#x27;s his turn to step up to his responsibilities, the same test that Buffy passed, and that Inca Mummy Girl failed.&quot;

An essay on Willow&#x27;s costumes and dress in &quot;Buffy&quot; discusses the &quot;themes of identity, costume, and duality&quot; in &quot;Inca Mummy Girl&quot; and the later episode &quot;Halloween&quot;. Oz notices her for the first two times when she is costumed - here, in &quot;her adorable but slightly cultural appropriate-y &quot;Inuit&quot; costume,&quot; and at Halloween in &quot;the full-body ghost costume and the &#x27;generically sexy&#x27; costume. Both are very much performances in their own way.&quot;

==Continuity==
&quot;Vox&quot; notes, &quot;There’s the introduction of Oz, and Jonathan&#x27;s first appearance on the series proper after he showed up in the unaired pilot.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Inca Mummy Girl&quot; had an audience of 3.2 million households.

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked this episode as #133 out of the 144 episodes in honor of 20th anniversary of the show&#x27;s ending, calling it &quot;forgettable.&quot; &quot;Vox&quot; ranked it as #140 out of the 144, saying that &quot;it did take a while for season two to outgrow season one&#x27;s reliance on fun-but-dumb monsters of the week,&quot; and this is &quot;one of the dumbest and the least fun.&quot;

Reviewer Mike Loschiavo applauded &quot;the gruesomeness of the episode... It explored a horror trope with compassion. ... this was about a creature that struggled with killing,&quot; and &quot;we find out that she was a chosen one herself.&quot;

<doc id="821197" wikidata="Q5141253" url="?curid=821197" title="Cognitive tutor">
<text>A cognitive tutor is a particular kind of intelligent tutoring system that utilizes a cognitive model to provide feedback to students as they are working through problems. This feedback will immediately inform students of the correctness, or incorrectness, of their actions in the tutor interface; however, cognitive tutors also have the ability to provide context-sensitive hints and instruction to guide students towards reasonable next steps.

== Introduction ==

The name of Cognitive Tutor now usually refers to a particular type of intelligent tutoring system produced by Carnegie Learning for high school mathematics based on John Anderson&#x27;s ACT-R theory of human cognition. However, cognitive tutors were originally developed to test ACT-R theory for research purposes since the early 1980s and they are developed also for other areas and subjects such as computer programming and science. Cognitive Tutors can be implemented into classrooms as a part of blended learning that combines textbook and software activities.

The Cognitive Tutor programs utilize cognitive model and are based on model tracing and knowledge tracing. Model tracing means that the cognitive tutor checks every action performed by students such as entering a value or clicking a button, while knowledge tracing is used to calculate the required skills students learned by measuring them on a bar chart called Skillometer. Model tracing and knowledge tracing are essentially used to monitor students&#x27; learning progress, guide students to correct path to problem solving, and provide feedback.

The Institute of Education Sciences published several reports regarding the effectiveness of Carnegie Cognitive Tutor. A 2013 report concluded that Carnegie Learning Curricula and Cognitive Tutor was found to have mixed effects on mathematics achievement for high school students. The report identified 27 studies that investigate the effectiveness of Cognitive Tutor , and the conclusion is based on 6 studies that meet What Works Clearinghouse standards. Among the 6 studies included, 5 of them show intermediate to significant positive effect, while 1 study shows statistically significant negative effect. Another report published by Institute of Education Sciences in 2009 found that Cognitive Tutor Algebra I to have potentially positive effects on math achievement based on only 1 study out of 14 studies that meets What Works Clearinghouse standards. It should be understood that What Works Clearinghouse standards call for relatively large numbers of participants, true random assignments to groups, and for a control group receiving either no treatment or a different treatment. Such experimental conditions are difficult to meet in schools, and thus only a small percentage of studies in education meet the standards of this clearinghouse, even though they may still be of value.

== Theoretical foundations ==

=== Four-component architecture ===

Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) have a four-component architecture: a domain model, a student model, a tutoring model and an interface component.

The domain model contains the rules, concepts, and knowledge related to the domain to be learned. It helps to evaluate students&#x27; performance and detect students&#x27; errors by setting a standard of domain expertise.

The student model, the central component of an ITS, is expected to contain knowledge about the students: their cognitive and affective states, and their progress as they learn. The function of the student model is threefold: to gather data from and about the learner, to represent the learner&#x27;s knowledge and learning process, and to perform diagnostics of a student&#x27;s knowledge and select optimal pedagogical strategies.

The tutoring model uses the data gained from the domain model and student model to make decisions about tutoring strategies such as whether or not to intervene, or when and how to intervene. Functions of the tutoring model include instruction delivery and content planning.

The interface component reflects the decisions made by the tutoring model in different forms such as Socratic dialogs, feedback and hints. Students interact with the tutor through the learning interface, also known as communication. The interface provides domain knowledge elements.

=== Cognitive model ===

A &quot;cognitive model&quot; replicates the domain knowledge and skills comparable to that of a human expert or an advanced student of the domain. A cognitive model enables intelligent tutoring systems to respond to problem-solving situations in a way similar to a human tutor. A tutoring system adopting a cognitive model is called a cognitive tutor.

A cognitive model is an expert system that generates a multitude of solutions to the problems presented to students. The cognitive model is used to trace each student&#x27;s solution through complex alternative solution paths, enabling the tutor to provide step-by-step feedback and advice, and to maintain a targeted model of the student&#x27;s knowledge based on student performance.

=== Cognitive Tutors ===

Cognitive Tutors provide step-by-step guidance as a learner develops a complex problem-solving skill through practice. Typically, cognitive tutors provide such forms of support as: (a) a problem-solving environment that is designed rich and &quot;thinking visible&quot;; (b) step-by-step feedback on student performance; (c) feedback messages specific to errors; (d) context-specific next-step hints at student&#x27;s request, and (e) individualized problem selection.

Cognitive Tutors accomplish two of the principal tasks characteristic of human tutoring: (1) monitors the student&#x27;s performance and providing context-specific individual instruction, and (2) monitors the student&#x27;s learning and selects appropriate problem-solving activities.

Both cognitive model and two underlying algorithms, model tracing and knowledge tracing, are used to monitor the student&#x27;s learning. In model tracing, the cognitive tutor uses the cognitive model in complex problems to follow the student&#x27;s individual path and provide prompt accuracy feedback and context-specific advice. In knowledge tracing, the cognitive tutor uses a Bayesian Knowledge Tracing method of evaluating the student&#x27;s knowledge and uses this student model to select appropriate problems for each student.

=== Cognitive architecture ===

Cognitive tutor development is guided by ACT-R cognitive architecture, which specifies the underlying framework developing the cognitive model or expert component of a cognitive tutor.

ACT-R, a member of the ACT family, is the most recent cognitive architecture, devoted primarily to modelling human behavior. ACT-R includes a declarative memory of factual knowledge and a procedural memory of production rules. The architecture functions by matching productions on perceptions and facts, mediated by the real-valued activation levels of objects, and executing them to affect the environment or alter declarative memory. ACT-R has been used to model psychological aspects such as memory, attention, reasoning, problem solving, and language processing.

== Application and utilization ==

The first real world applications of cognitive tutors were in the 1980s and involved a geometry proof tutor used by high school students and a LISP programming tutor used by college students in a mini course in introductory programming course at Carnegie Mellon University.

Since then, cognitive tutors have been used in a variety of scenarios, with a few organizations developing their own cognitive tutor programs. These programs have been used with students spanning elementary school through university level, though primarily in the subject areas of Computer Programming, Mathematics, and Science.
One of the first organizations to develop a system for use within the school system was the PACT Center at Carnegie Mellon University. Their aim was to &quot;...develop systems that provide individualized assistance to students as they work on challenging real-world problems in complex domains such as computer programming, algebra and geometry&quot;. PACT&#x27;s most successful product was the &quot;Cognitive Tutor Algebra&quot; course. Originally created in the early 1990s, this course was in use in 75 schools through the U.S. by 1999, and then its spin-off company, Carnegie Learning, now offers tutors to thousands of schools in the U.S.

The Carnegie Mellon Cognitive Tutor has been shown to raise students&#x27; math test scores in high school and middle-school classrooms, and their Algebra course was designated one of five exemplary curricula for K-12 mathematics educated by the US Department of Education.
There were several research projects conducted by the PACT Center to utilize Cognitive tutor for courses in Excel and to develop an intelligent tutoring system for algebra expression writing, called &quot;Ms. Lindquist&quot;. Further, in 2005, Carnegie Learning released &quot;Bridge to Algebra&quot;, a product intended for middle schools that was piloted in over 100 schools.

Cognitive tutoring software is continuing to be used. According to a &quot;Business Insider Report&quot; article, Ken Koedinger, a professor of human-computer interaction and psychology at Carnegie Mellon University, describes how teachers can integrate cognitive tutoring software into the classroom. He suggests that teachers use it in a computer lab environment or during classes. Cognitive tutors can understand the many ways that a student might answer a problem, and then assist the student at the exact time that the help is required. Further, the cognitive tutor can customize exercises specific to the student&#x27;s needs.

== Limitations ==
At this time it is unclear whether Cognitive Tutor is effective at improving student performance. Cognitive Tutor has had some commercial success however, there may be limitations inherently linked to its design and the nature of intelligent tutoring systems. The following section discusses limitations of Cognitive Tutor which may also apply to other intelligent tutoring systems.

===Curriculum===

At this time, creating a Cognitive Tutor for all subject areas is not practical or economical. Cognitive Tutor has been used successfully but is still limited to tutoring algebra, computer programming and geometry because these subject areas have an optimal balance of production rules, complexity and maximum benefit to the learner.

The focus of Cognitive Tutor development has been the design of the software to teach specific production rules and not on the development of curricular content. Despite many years of trials, improvements, and a potential to advance learning objectives, the creators continue to rely primarily on outside sources for curricular direction.

===Design===

The complexity of Cognitive Tutor software requires designers to spend hundreds of hours per instructional hour to create the program. Despite the time invested, the challenges associated with meeting the needs of the learner within the constraints of the design often result in compromises in flexibility and cognitive fidelity.

Practicality dictates that designers must choose from a discrete set of methods to teach and support learners. Limited choices of methods, prompts and hints may be effective in supporting some learners but may conflict with the methods already in use by others. In addition, it is possible that learners will use the system of prompts and hints to access the answers prematurely thereby advancing through the exercises which may result in them not meeting the learning objectives.

===Model===

The cognitive model, which inspired Cognitive Tutor is based on assumptions about how learning occurs which dictates the chosen instructional methods such as hints, directions and timing of the tutoring prompts. Given these assumptions, Cognitive Tutor do not account for all the diverse ways human tutors support student learning.

<doc id="821236" wikidata="Q7927021" url="?curid=821236" title="Victoria Sackville-West, Baroness Sackville">
<text>Victoria Josefa Dolores Catalina Sackville-West, Baroness Sackville (23 September 1862 – 30 January 1936) was a British noblewoman and mother of the writer, poet, and gardener Vita Sackville-West.

==Early life==
Victoria was one of seven illegitimate children of the English diplomat Lionel Sackville-West, 2nd Baron Sackville, and a Spanish dancer known by the stage name of &quot;Pepita de Oliva&quot;, (Josefa &quot;née&quot; Durán y Ortega; she was married to Juan Antonio de Oliva). Pepita was referred to as Countess West, though she never divorced her legal husband or married the father of her children. Victoria was, in youth, referred to as Pepita Sackville West, or &quot;Lolo&quot;, a diminutive of her name Dolores. While at convent school in 1881, however, the truth of her origins was revealed, and she was advised to be known as Victoria West. Victoria&#x27;s siblings included sisters Flora (born 1866), Amalia Marguerite Albertine (born 1868), and Eliza (who died in 1866, the year after her birth ); and brothers Ernest Henry Jean Baptiste (born 1869), Maximiliano (born 1858), and a short-lived brother named Frederic who died, along with their mother, soon after his birth in March 1871.

==Adult life==
In 1890 Victoria married her first cousin Lionel Edward Sackville-West, 3rd Baron Sackville. Their daughter, born in 1892, was the writer, poet, and gardener Vita Sackville-West. The family lived mainly at Knole House, an estate that had been in the Sackville family for centuries.

Victoria was notorious for beginning and dropping various money-making schemes, some intended for supposedly charitable aims, but most for her personal use. Among the schemes was one involving the opening of a shop in South Audley Street, London which Victoria wanted to name Knole Guild following a charitable scheme she had started in Kent of that name. Her husband Lord Sackville objected, and it was doubtless pointed out that the shop was for her own pecuniary benefit and not that of a charity. It was, in the end, named Spealls. Victoria was not good at retailing, and enlisted the services of her even less suitable daughter Vita, to contribute to the store&#x27;s stocks. The shop ended in failure, as did many of Victoria&#x27;s enterprises.

Lady Sackville was a close friend of the sculptor Auguste Rodin; his marble bust of her, dated 1913, is on display at the Rodin Museum.

Victoria&#x27;s life has been largely overshadowed by the controversial life of her bisexual daughter, Vita.

In 1912 she inherited a large fortune from her lover Sir John Scott, 1st Baronet of Connaught Place (1847–1912), who was involved in establishing the Wallace Collection as a national art museum.

===Houses===
A long time friend, companion, patroness and mistress (1916–1926) of the architect Edwin Lutyens, she engaged Lutyens to remodel a house for her at Sussex Square, Brighton, She is also attributed with commissioning Lutyens to build other houses, for example White Lodge at Roedean, Brighton and another for her guests at Worthing. She also commissioned Lutyens to remodel two houses in London, at Ebury Square, Belgravia and at Hill Street, Mayfair.

==Later life==
Increasingly intolerant of her husband&#x27;s infidelities, which were carried out in plain sight at their home at Knole, Lady Sackville removed herself to a house on the clifftop overlooking Brighton, Sussex called White Lodge. Her daughter claimed in her book &quot;Pepita&quot; that Victoria&#x27;s departure followed what to her appeared to be a subtle argument. Lord Sackville, having experienced war service, was, on his return, more active in the management of Knole. He merely told Lady Sackville that she should inform their bailiff if she wished to take any of their workmen away from the duties to which they had been allotted by the bailiff. She was not to interfere in matters otherwise, whereas she clearly felt she was the rightful chatelaine of the ancient property.

While at White Lodge, she indulged in increasingly eccentric schemes, mostly designed to raise funds for her own benefit given her straitened circumstances. She had experienced at least a couple of nervous breakdowns earlier in her life and seems to have declined into a state of litigiousness, perhaps from an increasingly pressing sense of persecution owing to her illegitimacy and lack of belonging. She became notorious for the number of writs she issued, and was even credited with referring to her home as the &quot;Writs Hotel&quot;.

<text>Joseph (&quot;Josy&quot;) Barthel (24 April 1927 – 7 July 1992) was a Luxembourgish athlete and politician. He was the surprise winner of the Men&#x27;s 1500 metres at the 1952 Summer Olympics, and the only athlete representing Luxembourg to have won a gold medal at the Olympics. Besides athletics, Barthel also led successful careers in both chemistry and politics.

==Biography==
Born in Mamer, Josy Barthel&#x27;s abilities as a middle-distance runner were discovered during World War II. His first fame came by winning the 800 m at the Military World Championships in Berlin in 1947. The next year at Military World Championships in Brussels he won both 800 m and 1500 m.

At the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, Barthel finished ninth at the 1500 m final. Then he won Student World Championships in 1949 (1500 m) and 1951 (800 m and 1500 m). The absolute high point of Barthel&#x27;s career was the 1952 Summer Olympics, where he surprised the crowd and himself by winning the 1500 m with a very strong finish. He also participated at the 1956 Summer Olympics, after which he retired from running. He was also Luxembourg champion in 800 m and 1500 m from 1946 to 1956.

In 1962 Barthel became the president of the Luxembourg Athletics Federation, then from 1973 to 1977 he was the president of the Luxembourgish Olympic and Sporting Committee. A member of the Democratic Party, he later entered politics, serving as a minister from 1977 to 1984 in the Thorn-Vouel-Berg and Werner-Thorn-Flesch governments.

Josy Barthel died in Luxembourg City after a severe illness.

The former national stadium of Luxembourg, home until September 2021 to the national football team, was named Stade Josy Barthel in his honor. The Lycée Technique Josy Barthel in Mamer also bears his name.

In 2006, Barthel was accused of doping by sports journalist Erik Eggers in the German newspaper &quot;Der Tagesspiegel.&quot; Eggers cited German physician Oskar Wegener who did research on methamphetamine and other doping substances in the 1950s. Wegener strongly denied saying Barthel had any connection with doping. The use of such substances was neither prohibited nor controlled until the 1960s.

<doc id="821314" wikidata="Q1369558" url="?curid=821314" title="Winger (sports)">
<text>In certain sports, such as football, field hockey, ice hockey, handball, rugby union, lacrosse and rugby league, winger is a position. It refers to positions on the extreme left and right sides of the pitch, or playing field (the &quot;wings&quot;). In American football and Canadian football, the analogous position is the wide receiver. Wingers often try to use pace to exploit extra space available on the flanks that can be made available by their teammates dominating the centre ground. They must be wary however of not crossing the touchline, or sidelines, and going out of play. In sports where the main method of scoring involves attacking a small goal (by whatever name) in the centre of the field, a common tactic is to cross the ball to a central teammate.

==Association football==

In football, a winger is an attacking midfielder in a wide position. Wingers are usually players of great pace or dribbling ability so as to provide cut-backs or crosses from which strikers can score. Their main function is to support attack from the wings. Wingers do much high-speed running from defence to attack.

==Australian rules football==

In Australian rules football, the wingers require considerable pace and stamina, as they run up and down the ground linking play between defence and attack and are normally highly skilled in kicking.

==Ice hockey==

&quot;Winger&quot;, in ice hockey, is a forward position of a player whose primary zone of play on the ice is along the outer playing area. They typically work by flanking the centre forward. Originally the name was given to forward players who went up and down the sides of the rink. Nowadays, there are different types of wing men in the game—out-and-out goal scorers, checkers who disrupt the opponents and forwards who work along the boards and in the corners. This position is typically just called &quot;wing&quot;, often preceded by the side on which the player normally skates (left wing or right wing).

==Handball==
In handball there are two wing positions: left wing and right wing. In a typical team, these positions are occupied by fast and relatively small players. One of their main jobs in a game are fast attacks.

==Rugby football==
Wingers or wings play on either the extreme left or the extreme right. They are usually the fastest players on the field and score the most tries. Wingers often fall back with the fullback to take kicks from the opposition.

There are two s in a rugby league team, numbered 2 and 5. There are two wings in a rugby union team, numbered 11 and 14.

<text>xMule (short for &quot;X11 Mule&quot;) is a discontinued free client for the eDonkey peer-to-peer file sharing network intended to bring it to virtually all the major Unix platforms, with a particular emphasis on Linux.

xMule was coded in C++ using wxWidgets and released under GNU General Public License v2. xMule is a fork of lMule, itself a port of eMule. aMule is a fork of xMule.

==History==

=== xMule ===
In June 2003, due to differences between the developers and the hijacking of lMule&#x27;s official website by one contributor, lMule&#x27;s fork, xMule, was created.

Unlike eMule, which uses MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes), xMule used wxWidgets for the graphical user interface, therefore could run on many platforms. It fully supported Linux and *BSD, and was intended to support Windows and MacOS.

On 17 August 2003, Ted R. Smith, xMule&#x27;s only maintainer who lived in the United States at the time, became involved in a legal battle due to his role in the development of xMule. His personal Internet connection was shut down. He appeared to be subpoenaed by the government on behalf of the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) related issue.

xMule&#x27;s final release was 1.13.7 RC1 in September 2006.

Since 18 January 2009, a note on the official website of xMule, written by its developer, Avi Vahl, officially announced the discontinuation of xMule&#x27;s development. To justify the decision, Avi Vahl claimed that eMule was dead and the future of peer-to-peer was the BitTorrent protocol. The official xMule website encouraged users to move to the BitTorrent network or use aMule.

=== aMule ===
On 18 August 2003, shortly after the incident involving Ted R. Smith, aMule (meaning &quot;another Mule&quot; and later &quot;All-platform Mule&quot;) was forked from the xMule source code due to major disagreements. aMule&#x27;s official website stated that &quot;relations between the two projects are sadly in a rather sorry state&quot;, whereas xMule&#x27;s stated that &quot;aMule is geared more towards the present end-user, while xMule is more about long-term extensibility and viability&quot;, and drew comparisons to the different coding philosophies behind Internet Explorer and Mozilla. aMule has added the support for Windows and MacOS.

<doc id="821328" wikidata="Q928948" url="?curid=821328" title="Xylocopinae">
<text>The subfamily Xylocopinae (family Apidae) occurs worldwide, and includes the large carpenter bees (tribe Xylocopini), the small carpenter bees (tribe Ceratinini), the allodapine bees (tribe Allodapini), and the relictual genus &quot;Manuelia&quot; (tribe Manueliini).

==Subdivisions==
The Tribes of Xylocopinae are:
*The Xylocopini comprise a single genus, &quot;Xylocopa&quot;, and occur in worldwide distribution, on all continents except Antarctica.
*The Ceratinini comprise a single genus, &quot;Ceratina&quot;, with a worldwide distribution.
*The Manueliini comprise a single genus, &quot;Manuelia&quot;, with only three species, which are restricted to Chile and the Lakes Region in Argentina.
*The Allodapini are restricted to sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar, Southeast Asia, and Australasia, with a rare genus &quot;Exoneuridia&quot; also occurring in montane regions of the Middle East.
*The Boreallodapini is extinct, and known from specimens in amber.

==Description==
Some Xylocopinae have a cavity between the thorax and abdomen, called acarinarium, which provides accommodation for a colony of predatory mites, cleaning their hosts of external parasites.

The vast majority of the Xylocopinae species make nests in dead wood, stems, or pith, and while many are solitary, many are also communal or primitively social. Some genera of Allodapines commonly form eusocial colonies.

<text>Manmohan Ghose (19 January 1869 – 4 January 1924) was an Indian poet and one of the first from India to write poetry in English. He was a brother of Sri Aurobindo.

==Background==
Manmohan Ghose was born the son of Dr. Krishna Dhan Ghose by his wife, Swarnalata Devi Ghose (&quot;née&quot; Basu). His ancestral village was in Konnagar, present day Hooghly district. His family was Bengali and upper caste Hindu, and were among the early adopters of English education. Consequently, they had acquired affluence and the prestige of holding government jobs. Manmohan&#x27;s father, Krishna Dhun Ghose, was a doctor in the government service, who served as Assistant Surgeon of Rangpur in Bengal. Formerly a member of the Brahmo Samaj religious reform movement, he had become enamoured with the then-new idea of evolution while pursuing medical studies in Britain. Manmohan&#x27;s mother, Swarnalata Devi, was the daughter of Shri Rajnarayan Bose, a leading figure in the Brahmo Samaj. He was the best friend of Laurence Binyon. Manmohan was the second of siblings. The eldest was his brother, Benoybhusan Ghose, then Manmohan himself, then his brother Sri Aurobindo (the famous revolutionary and ascetic) followed by his only sister Sarojini, and last of all was another brother, Barindrakumar (usually referred to as Barin).

==Career==

He was educated at The Manchester Grammar School (1881–84), St Paul&#x27;s school in London (1884–87) and won an open scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford.

His work was published in &quot;Primavera:Poems by Four Authors&quot; (1890), with Laurence Binyon, Arthur S. Cripps, and
Stephen Phillips. Ghose later met Oscar Wilde at the Fitzroy Street Settlement, who reviewed Primavera in Pall Mall Gazette, with particular favour towards Ghose. During this time in London Ghose met many other members of the &quot;Rhymers&#x27; Club&quot; set such as Lionel Johnson, Ernest Dowson, who were both very fond of him.

In 1893, after his father&#x27;s death, Ghose returned to India and took a series of teaching posts at Patna, Bankipur, and Calcutta. In 1897, he was appointed Assistant Professor of Dacca College. After the death of his wife Malati Banerjee in 1918, his health deteriorated and he aged prematurely. For 30 years Ghose had cherished the dream of returning to England and even booked a passage along with his daughter in March 1924, but after a short illness on 4 January 1924 he died in Calcutta.

His daughter left for London and met Laurence Binyon, who helped her edit &quot;Songs of love and death&quot;, which was published in 1926.

<doc id="821349" wikidata="Q867143" url="?curid=821349" title="Roman temple">
<text>Ancient Roman temples were among the most important buildings in Roman culture, and some of the richest buildings in Roman architecture, though only a few survive in any sort of complete state. Today they remain &quot;the most obvious symbol of Roman architecture&quot;. Their construction and maintenance was a major part of ancient Roman religion, and all towns of any importance had at least one main temple, as well as smaller shrines. The main room &quot;(cella)&quot; housed the cult image of the deity to whom the temple was dedicated, and often a table for supplementary offerings or libations and a small altar for incense. Behind the cella was a room, or rooms, used by temple attendants for storage of equipment and offerings. The ordinary worshiper rarely entered the cella, and most public ceremonies were performed outside of the cella where the sacrificial altar was located, on the portico, with a crowd gathered in the temple precinct.

The most common architectural plan had a rectangular temple raised on a high podium, with a clear front with a portico at the top of steps, and a triangular pediment above columns. The sides and rear of the building had much less architectural emphasis, and typically no entrances. There were also circular plans, generally with columns all round, and outside Italy there were many compromises with traditional local styles. The Roman form of temple developed initially from Etruscan temples, themselves influenced by the Greeks, with subsequent heavy direct influence from Greece.

Public religious ceremonies of the official Roman religion took place outdoors and not within the temple building. Some ceremonies were processions that started at, visited, or ended with a temple or shrine, where a ritual object might be stored and brought out for use, or where an offering would be deposited. Sacrifices, chiefly of animals, would take place at an open-air altar within the &quot;templum&quot;; often on one of the narrow extensions of the podium to the side of the steps. Especially under the Empire, exotic foreign cults gained followers in Rome, and were the local religions in large parts of the expanded Empire. These often had very different practices, some preferring underground places of worship, while others, like Early Christians, worshiped in houses.

Some remains of many Roman temples still survive, above all in Rome itself, but the relatively few near-complete examples were nearly all converted into Christian churches (and sometimes subsequently to mosques), usually a considerable time after the initial triumph of Christianity under Constantine. The decline of Roman religion was relatively slow, and the temples themselves were not appropriated by the government until a decree of the Emperor Honorius in 415. Santi Cosma e Damiano, in the Roman Forum, originally the Temple of Romulus, was not dedicated as a church until 527. The best known is the Pantheon, Rome, which, however, is highly untypical, being a very large circular temple with a magnificent concrete roof, behind a conventional portico front.

==Terms==
The English word &quot;temple&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;templum&quot;, which was originally not the building itself, but a sacred space surveyed and plotted ritually. The Roman architect Vitruvius always uses the word &quot;templum&quot; to refer to the sacred precinct, and not to the building. The more common Latin words for a temple or shrine were &quot;sacellum&quot; (a small shrine or chapel), &quot;aedes&quot;, &quot;delubrum&quot;, and &quot;fanum&quot; (in this article, the English word &quot;temple&quot; refers to any of these buildings, and the Latin &quot;templum&quot; to the sacred precinct).

==Architecture==
The form of the Roman temple was mainly derived from the Etruscan model, but in the late Republic there was a switch to using Greek classical and Hellenistic styles, without much change in the key features of the form. The Etruscans were a people of northern Italy, whose civilization was at its peak in the seventh century BC. The Etruscans were already influenced by early Greek architecture, so Roman temples were distinctive but with both Etruscan and Greek features. Surviving temples (both Greek and Roman) lack the extensive painted statuary that decorated the rooflines, and the elaborate revetments and antefixes, in colourful terracotta in earlier examples, that enlivened the entablature.
Etruscan and Roman temples emphasised the front of the building, which followed Greek temple models and typically consisted of wide steps leading to a portico with columns, a pronaos, and usually a triangular pediment above, which was filled with statuary in the most grand examples; this was as often in terracotta as stone, and no examples have survived except as fragments. Especially in the earlier periods, further statuary might be placed on the roof, and the entablature decorated with antefixes and other elements, all of this being brightly painted. However, unlike the Greek models, which generally gave equal treatment to all sides of the temple, which could be viewed and approached from all directions, the side and rear walls of Roman temples might be largely undecorated (as in the Pantheon, Rome and Vic), inaccessible by steps (as in the Maison Carrée and Vic), and even back on to other buildings. As in the Maison Carrée, columns at the side might be half columns, emerging from (&quot;engaged with&quot; in architectural terminology) the wall.
The platform on which the temple sat was typically raised higher in Etruscan and Roman examples than Greek, with up to ten, twelve or more steps rather than the three typical in Greek temples; the Temple of Claudius was raised twenty steps. These steps were normally only at the front, and typically not the whole width of that. It might or might not be possible to walk around the temple exterior inside (Temple of Hadrian) or outside the colonnade, or at least down the sides. The description of the Greek models used here is a generalization of classical Greek ideals, and later Hellenistic buildings often do not reflect them. For example, the &quot;Temple of Dionysus&quot; on the terrace by the theatre at Pergamon (Ionic, 2nd century BC, on a hillside), had many steps in front, and no columns beyond the portico. The Parthenon, also approached up a hill, probably had many wide steps at the approach to the main front, followed by a flat area before the final few steps.

After the eclipse of the Etruscan models, the Greek classical orders in all their details were closely followed in the façades of Roman temples, as in other prestigious buildings, with the direct adoption of Greek models apparently beginning around 200 BC, under the late Republic. But the distinctive differences in the general arrangement of temples between the Etruscan-Roman style and the Greek, as outlined above, were retained. However the idealized proportions between the different elements in the orders set out by the only significant Roman writer on architecture to survive, Vitruvius, and subsequent Italian Renaissance writers, do not reflect actual Roman practice, which could be very variable, though always aiming at balance and harmony. Following a Hellenistic trend, the Corinthian order and its variant the Composite order were most common in surviving Roman temples, but for small temples like that at Alcántara, a simple Tuscan order could be used. Vitruvius does not recognise the Composite order in his writings, and covers the Tuscan order only as Etruscan; Renaissance writers formalized them from observing surviving buildings.
The front of the temple typically carried an inscription saying who had built it, cut into the stone with a &quot;V&quot; section. This was filled with brightly coloured paint, usually scarlet or vermilion. In major imperial monuments the letters were cast in lead and held in by pegs, then also painted or gilded. These have usually long vanished, but archaeologists can generally reconstruct them from the peg-holes, and some have been re-created and set in place.

Sculptural decoration was similar to that of Greek temples, often with pedimental sculpture with figures, of which only few fragments survive. However, exterior friezes with figures in relief were much less common. Many acroteria, antefixes and other elements were brightly coloured. In the early Empire older Greek statues were apparently sometimes re-used as acroteria. 

There was considerable local variation in style, as Roman architects often tried to incorporate elements the population expected in its sacred architecture. This was especially the case in Egypt and the Near East, where different traditions of large stone temples were already millennia old. The Romano-Celtic temple was a simple style, usually with little use of stone, for small temples found in the Western Empire, and by far the most common type in Roman Britain, where they were usually square, with an ambulatory. It often lacked any of the distinctive classical features, and may have had considerable continuity with pre-Roman temples of the Celtic religion.

===Circular plans===

Romano-Celtic temples were often circular, and circular temples of various kinds were built by the Romans. Greek models were available in &quot;tholos&quot; shrines and some other buildings, as assembly halls and various other functions. Temples of the goddess Vesta, which were usually small, typically had this shape, as in those at Rome and Tivoli (see list), which survive in part. Like the Temple of Hercules Victor in Rome, which was perhaps by a Greek architect, these survivors had an unbroken colonnade encircling the building, and a low, Greek-style podium.

Different formulae were followed in the Pantheon, Rome and a small temple at Baalbek (usually called the &quot;Temple of Venus&quot;), where the door is behind a full portico, though very different ways of doing this are used. In the Pantheon only the portico has columns, and the &quot;thoroughly uncomfortable&quot; exterior meeting of the portico and circular cella are often criticised. At Baalbek, a wide portico with a broken pediment is matched by four other columns round the building, with the architrave in scooped curving sections, each ending in a projection supported by a column.

At Praeneste (modern Palestrina) near Rome, a huge pilgrimage complex of the 1st century BC led visitors up several levels with large buildings on a steep hillside, before they eventually reached the sanctuary itself, a much smaller circular building.

==Caesareum==

A &quot;caesareum&quot; was a temple devoted to the Imperial cult. Caesarea were located throughout the Roman Empire, and often funded by the imperial government, tending to replace state spending on new temples to other gods, and becoming the main or only large temple in new Roman towns in the provinces. This was the case at Évora, Vienne and Nîmes, which were all expanded by the Romans as &quot;coloniae&quot; from Celtic &quot;oppida&quot; soon after their conquest. Imperial temples paid for by the government usually used conventional Roman styles all over the empire, regardless of the local styles seen in smaller temples. In newly planned Roman cities the temple was normally centrally placed at one end of the forum, often facing the basilica at the other.

In the city of Rome, a &quot;caesareum&quot; was located within the religious precinct of the Arval Brothers. In 1570, it was documented as still containing nine statues of Roman emperors in architectural niches. Most of the earlier emperors had their own very large temples in Rome, but a faltering economy meant that the building of new imperial temples mostly ceased after the reign of Marcus Aurelius (d. 180), though the Temple of Romulus on the Roman Forum was built and dedicated by the Emperor Maxentius to his son Valerius Romulus, who died in childhood in 309 and was deified.

One of the earliest and most prominent of the &quot;caesarea&quot; was the Caesareum of Alexandria, located on the harbour. It was begun by Cleopatra VII of the Ptolemaic dynasty, the last pharaoh of Ancient Egypt, to honour her dead lover Julius Caesar, then converted by Augustus to his own cult. During the 4th century, after the Empire had come under Christian rule, it was converted to a church.

==Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus==

The Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill was the oldest large temple in Rome, a capitolium dedicated to the Capitoline Triad consisting of Jupiter and his companion deities, Juno and Minerva, and had a cathedral-like position in the official religion of Rome. It was destroyed by fire three times, and rapidly rebuilt in contemporary styles. The first building, traditionally dedicated in 509 BC, has been claimed to have been almost , much larger than other Roman temples for centuries after, although its size is heavily disputed by specialists. Whatever its size, its influence on other early Roman temples was significant and long-lasting. The same may have been true for the later rebuildings, though here the influence is harder to trace.

For the first temple Etruscan specialists were brought in for various aspects of the building, including making and painting the extensive terracotta elements of the entablature or upper parts, such as antefixes. But for the second building they were summoned from Greece. Rebuildings after destruction by fire were completed in 69 BC, 75 AD, and in the 80s AD, under Domitian – the third building only lasted five years before burning down again. After a major sacking by Vandals in 455, and comprehensive removal of stone in the Renaissance, only foundations can now be seen, in the basement of the Capitoline Museums. The sculptor Flaminio Vacca (d 1605) claimed that the life-size Medici lion he carved to match a Roman survival, now in Florence, was made from a single capital from the temple.

==Influence==

The Etruscan-Roman adaptation of the Greek temple model to place the main emphasis on the front façade and let the other sides of the building harmonize with it only as much as circumstances and budget allow has generally been adopted in Neoclassical architecture, and other classically derived styles. In these temple fronts with columns and a pediment are very common for the main entrance of grand buildings, but often flanked by large wings or set in courtyards. This flexibility has allowed the Roman temple front to be used in buildings made for a wide variety of purposes. The colonnade may no longer be pushed forward with a pronaus porch, and it may not be raised above the ground, but the essential shape remains the same. Among thousands of examples are the White House, Buckingham Palace, and St Peters, Rome; in recent years the temple front has become fashionable in China.

Renaissance and later architects worked out ways of harmoniously adding high raised domes, towers and spires above a colonnaded temple portico front, something the Romans would have found odd. The Roman temple front remains a familiar feature of subsequent Early Modern architecture in the Western tradition, but although very commonly used for churches, it has lost the specific association with religion that it had for the Romans. Generally, later adaptions lack the colour of the original, and though there may be sculpture filling the pediment in grand examples, the full Roman complement of sculpture above the roofline is rarely emulated.

Variations on the theme, mostly Italian in origin, include: San Andrea, Mantua, 1462 by Leon Battista Alberti, which took a four-columned Roman triumphal arch and added a pediment above; San Giorgio Maggiore, Venice, begun 1566, by Andrea Palladio, which has two superimposed temple fronts, one low and wide, the other tall and narrow; the Villa Capra &quot;La Rotonda&quot;, 1567 on, also by Palladio, with four isolated temple fronts on each side of a rectangle, with a large central dome. In Baroque architecture two temple fronts, often of different orders, superimposed one above the other, became extremely common for Catholic churches, often with the uppermost one supported by huge volutes to each side. This can be seen developing in the Gesù, Rome (1584), Santa Susanna, Rome (1597), Santi Vincenzo e Anastasio a Trevi (1646) and Val-de-Grâce, Paris (1645 on). The Palladian villas of the Veneto include numerous ingenious and influential variations on the theme of the Roman temple front. 

An archetypical pattern for churches in Georgian architecture was set by St Martin-in-the-Fields in London (1720), by James Gibbs, who boldly added to the classical temple façade at the west end a large steeple on top of a tower, set back slightly from the main frontage. This formula shocked purists and foreigners, but became accepted and was very widely copied, at home and in the colonies, for example at St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Chennai in India and St. Paul&#x27;s Chapel in New York City (1766).
Examples of modern buildings that stick more faithfully to the ancient rectangular temple form are only found from the 18th century onwards. Versions of the Roman temple as a discrete block include La Madeleine, Paris (1807), now a church but built by Napoleon as a &quot;Temple de la Gloire de la Grande Armée&quot; (&quot;Temple to the Glory of the Great Army&quot;), the Virginia State Capitol as originally built in 1785–88, and Birmingham Town Hall (1832–34).

Small Roman circular temples with colonnades have often been used as models, either for single buildings, large or small, or elements such as domes raised on drums, in buildings on another plan such as St Peters, Rome, St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London and the United States Capitol. The great progenitor of these is the Tempietto of Donato Bramante in the courtyard of San Pietro in Montorio in Rome, c. 1502, which has been widely admired ever since.

Though the Pantheon&#x27;s large circular domed cella, with a conventional portico front, is &quot;unique&quot; in Roman architecture, it has been copied many times by modern architects. Versions include the church of Santa Maria Assunta in Ariccia by Gian Lorenzo Bernini (1664), which followed his work restoring the Roman original, Belle Isle House (1774) in England, and Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s library at the University of Virginia, The Rotunda (1817–26). The Pantheon was much the largest and most accessible complete classical temple front known to the Italian Renaissance, and was the standard exemplar when these were revived.

==Substantial survivals==



Most of the best survivals had been converted to churches (and sometimes later mosques), which some remain. Often the porticos were walled in between the columns, and the original cella front and side walls largely removed to create a large single space in the interior. Rural areas in the Islamic world have some good remains, which had been left largely undisturbed. In Spain some remarkable discoveries (Vic, Cordoba, Barcelona) were made in the 19th century when old buildings being reconstructed or demolished were found to contain major remains encased in later buildings. In Rome, Pula, and elsewhere some walls incorporated in later buildings have always been evident. 

The squared-off blocks of temple walls have always been attractive for later builders to reuse, while the large pieces of massive columns were less easy to remove and make use of; hence the podium, minus facing, and some columns are often all that remain. In most cases loose pieces of stone have been removed from the site, and some such as capitals may be found in local museums, along with non-architectural items excavated, such as terracotta votive statuettes or amulets, which are often found in large numbers. Very little indeed survives in place from the significant quantities of large sculpture that originally decorated temples.

<text>Blokhus is a village in North Jutland, Denmark. It is located in Jammerbugt Municipality. Blokhus is a popular beach town with around 1 million visitors every year.

==History==
Blokhus was originally named &quot;Hune Hvarre&quot;. In the early 1600s there were barely any trees in the area, so timber was imported from Norway. The locals had to store this timber somewhere, so they constructed some houses out of the timber. These houses became known as &#x27;block houses&#x27; (Danish: &quot;blokhuse&quot;), which gave name to the village.

Axel P. Jensen (1885–1972) was a Danish painter of landscapes. He spent most of his time in Blokhus.

==Beach==
One of the main attractions is Blokhus Beach, which is a white, sandy bathing beach with a dune area. During the summer, 47 characteristic white beach huts are placed on the beach. It is possible to drive along Blokhus Beach. During the summer, there is a lifeguard on the beach. In 2011, a new beach centre was built, which contains restrooms, an ice cream stand and a café.

During the summer, the local cannon guild fire their cannon by the beach centre every night. In 2012, the former bowling alley in the town square was transformed into the shopping centre, Blokhuset. An outdoor stage has been built in the town square, and it has hosted recurring concerts during the summer. The stage was modernised and moved to one end of the town square in 2013.

==Dune plantation==
Close to the town is a dune plantation, Blokhus Dune Plantation (Danish: &quot;Blokhus Klitplantage&quot;), which covers 642 hectares of land and is administered by Naturstyrelsen Vendsyssel (Danish Nature Agency of Vendsyssel). Gateway Blokhus is a recreational area in the plantation between Blokhus and Hune, and contains a natural playground, a picnic area, and an outdoor baking oven that is for general use. From Gateway Blokhus there is access to a mountain bike track and nature trails. In the northern part of the dune plantation, there is an off-leash dog area.

<text>Richard Martin Edler von Mises (; 19 April 1883 – 14 July 1953) was an Austrian scientist and mathematician who worked on solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, aerodynamics, aeronautics, statistics and probability theory. He held the position of Gordon McKay Professor of Aerodynamics and Applied Mathematics at Harvard University. He described his work in his own words shortly before his death as:

Although best known for his mathematical work, von Mises also contributed to the philosophy of science as a neo-positivist and empiricist, following the line of Ernst Mach. Historians of the Vienna Circle of logical empiricism recognize a &quot;first phase&quot; from 1907 through 1914 with Philipp Frank, Hans Hahn, and Otto Neurath. His older brother, Ludwig von Mises, held an opposite point of view with respect to positivism and epistemology. His brother developed &quot;praxeology&quot;, an &quot;a priori&quot; view.

During his time in Istanbul, Mises maintained close contact with Philipp Frank, a logical positivist and Professor of Physics in Prague until 1938. His literary interests included the Austrian novelist Robert Musil and the poet Rainer Maria Rilke, on whom he became a recognized expert.

==Life==
Von Mises was born in Lemberg, Austria-Hungary into a Jewish family, eighteen months after his brother Ludwig von Mises, who became a prominent economist of the Austrian School, a heterodox school of economics. His parents were Arthur Edler von Mises, a doctor of technical sciences who worked for the Austrian State Railways, and Adele Landau. Richard and Ludwig had a younger brother, Karl von Mises, who died as an infant from Scarlet Fever. Richard attended the Akademisches Gymnasium in Vienna, from which he graduated with honors in Latin and mathematics in autumn 1901. After graduating in mathematics, physics and engineering from the Vienna University of Technology, he was appointed as Georg Hamel&#x27;s assistant in Brünn (Brno). In 1905, still a student, he published an article on the geometry of curves called &quot;Zur konstruktiven Infinitesimalgeometrie der ebenen Kurven,&quot; in the prestigious &quot;Zeitschrift für Mathematik und Physik&quot;.

In 1908, von Mises was awarded a doctorate from Vienna (his dissertation was on &quot;the determination of flywheel masses in crank drives&quot;) and he received his habilitation from Brünn (Brno) (on &quot;Theory of the Waterwheels&quot;) to lecture on engineering. In 1909, at 26, he was appointed professor of applied mathematics in Straßburg, then part of the German Empire (later Strasbourg, Alsace, France) and received Prussian citizenship. His application for a teaching position at the Brno University of Technology was interrupted by the First World War.

Before the war he had already become a pilot and lectured on aircraft design, and in 1913 at Strasbourg he gave the first university course on powered flight. At the outbreak of war it was natural for him to join the Austro-Hungarian army as a test pilot and a flying instructor. In 1915, he supervised the construction of a 600-horsepower (450 kW) aircraft – the &quot;Mises-Flugzeug&quot; (Mises aircraft) for the Austrian army. It was completed in 1916 but never saw active service.

After the war, von Mises held the new chair of hydrodynamics and aerodynamics at the Dresden &quot;Technische Hochschule&quot;. In 1919 he was appointed director and full professor at the new Institute of Applied Mathematics created at the behest of Erhard Schmidt at the University of Berlin. In 1921 he founded the journal &quot;Zeitschrift für Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik&quot; and became its editor.

With the rise of the National Socialist Party to power in 1933, Mises felt his position threatened, despite his First World War military service. He moved to Turkey, where he assumed the new chair of pure and applied mathematics at the University of Istanbul. In 1939 he accepted a position in the United States, where in 1944 he was appointed as Gordon McKay Professor of Aerodynamics and Applied Mathematics at Harvard University. In 1943 he married Hilda Geiringer, a mathematician who had been his assistant at the Institute and moved with him to Turkey and then to the U.S.

In 1950, von Mises declined honorary membership from the Communist-dominated East German Academy of Science.

==Contributions==
In aerodynamics, von Mises made advances in boundary-layer flow theory and airfoil design. He developed the &quot;distortion energy theory&quot; of stress, an important factor in material strength calculations.

His ideas were not universally well received, although Alexander Ostrowski had said of him: &quot;Only with the appointment of Richard von Mises to the University of Berlin did the first serious German school of applied mathematics with a broad sphere of influence come into existence. Von Mises was an incredibly dynamic person and at the same time amazingly versatile like Runge. He was especially well versed in the realm of technology.&quot; and also wrote &quot;Because of his dynamic personality his occasional major blunders were somehow tolerated. One has even forgiven him his theory of probability.&quot; Yet Andrey Kolmogorov, whose rival axiomatisation was better received, was less severe: &quot;The basis for the applicability of the results of the mathematical theory of probability to real &#x27;random phenomena&#x27; must depend on some form of the frequency concept of probability, the unavoidable nature of which has been established by von Mises in a spirited manner.&quot;

In probability theory, he proposed the famous &quot;birthday problem&quot;. He also defined the impossibility of a gambling system.

In solid mechanics, von Mises contributed to the theory of plasticity by formulating the von Mises yield criterion, independently of Tytus Maksymilian Huber.

He is often credited for the Principle of Maximum Plastic Dissipation.

The Gesellschaft für Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik (Society of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics) awards a Richard von Mises Prize since 1989.

<text>The BMW M30 is a SOHC straight-six petrol engine which was produced from 1968 to 1995. With a production run of 27 years, it is BMW&#x27;s longest produced engine and was used in many car models.

The first models to use the M30 engine were the BMW 2500 and 2800 sedans. The initial M30 models were produced in displacements of and . Larger displacement versions were introduced over time, with the largest version being , which was sometimes badged as &quot;3.5 litres&quot;. As per the BMW M10 four-cylinder engine from which the M30 was developed, the M30 has an iron block, an aluminium head and an overhead camshaft with two valves per cylinder.

The engine was given the nicknames of &#x27;Big Six&#x27; and &#x27;Senior Six&#x27;, following the introduction of the smaller BMW M20 straight-six engine in the late 1970s. The M30 was produced alongside the M20 throughout the M20&#x27;s production, and prior to the introduction of the BMW M70 V12 engine in 1987, the M30 was BMW&#x27;s most powerful and largest regular production engine.

Following the introduction of the BMW M50 engine in 1990, the M30 began to be phased out.

Ward&#x27;s have rated the M30 as one of the &quot;Top Engines of the 20th Century&quot;.

==Design==
The M30 was originally developed in the late 1960s, loosely based on the BMW M10 four-cylinder engine first used in the BMW New Class sedans and coupes. Initially, the engine code was &quot;M06&quot; and the &quot;M68&quot;, until all versions began to use the &quot;M30&quot; prefix in 1981.

Common features between the M10 and M30 include a profile lowering 30-degree slant to the right, a crossflow cylinder head, and chain-driven camshaft with rocker arm valve actuation. Further similarities include a cast-iron block with an aluminium head and a forged crankshaft. The first two M30 engines introduced were the and the versions, which both used an bore.

==M30B35LE/M90 engine==

The M30B35LE engine, also called the M90, was used in several models from 1979-1982. It combines the block from the motorsports BMW M88 DOHC engine with the M30&#x27;s SOHC cylinder head.

==Turbocharging==
The M30 was the basis for the turbocharged M102 and M106 engines.

The Alpina B10 Biturbo used a modified version of the M30, with two turbochargers and forged pistons. Producing at 6000 rpm and at 4000 rpm, the engine made this car the fastest sedan in the world. The final 50 M30 blocks were shipped to Alpina for use in the final 50 B10 Biturbos.

===M102===
The M102 was produced from 1980 to 1982. It was BMW&#x27;s first turbocharged six-cylinder engine.

The M102 (also known as &quot;M30B32LAE&quot;) has a displacement of . The KKK K27 turbocharger produces of boost and an air-to-air intercooler is used. The compression ratio is 7.0:1.

The M102 produces and was used in the E23 7 Series, in the model was designated &quot;745i&quot;. The M102 was not available in right-hand drive cars, leading to the South African 745i using the BMW M88 naturally aspirated DOHC straight-six engine instead.

Applications:
* 1980–1982 E23 745i

===M106===
The M106 (also called &quot;M30B34MAE&quot;) replaced the M102 and was produced from 1982 to 1986.

Some of the M106&#x27;s upgrades over its predecessor are a result of the M30B34 version of the M30, which was also released in 1982. These upgrades include Bosch Motronic engine management and an increased displacement to . The compression ratio was increased from 7.0:1 to 8.0:1.

Peak power output is the same as the M102, however it occurs at lower RPM and peak boost is reduced from .

There was no direct successor to the M106, however BMW&#x27;s next turbocharged petrol engine was the BMW N54, introduced in 2006.

Applications:
* 1982–1986 E23 745i

==Motorsport==
The M30 powered a series of E9 CSL and E24 6 Series coupes to European Touring Car Championship (ETCC) throughout the 1970s and into the middle 1980s, even though a more powerful DOHC 24-valve head had been developed for high-performance motorsports and street use.

The BMW M88 high-performance engine is based on the M30 block.

<doc id="821601" wikidata="Q749600" url="?curid=821601" title="Stardust (1993 video game)">
<text>Stardust is a 1993 multidirectional shooter video game developed and published by Bloodhouse for the Amiga. The game is an &quot;Asteroids&quot; clone with enhancements, such as power-ups, shields, a high-energy techno module soundtrack, vivid use of colors and the occasional tunnel section that revolves around a sphere. The game&#x27;s graphics drew critical acclaim for the aforementioned tunnels and the liberal use of ray-tracing. The company has since merged with Terramarque to form Housemarque.

The Finnish developers gave several things ludicrous names in their own language, which were (and still are) highly obscure in the international market. The damsel in distress is named after a brand of margarine, and the final confrontation takes place over the planet Imatra.

==Ports==
The game was ported to MS-DOS, but not by the original programmers. This version was buggy, scant on details found in the Amiga version and severely lacking in both control and gameplay polish.

A conversion was made for the Atari STE by Aggression demoscene crew, published in 1995 by Daze Marketing. It is one of the few STE exclusive games, and uses the machine&#x27;s updated capabilities.

==Legacy==
An enhanced sequel named &quot;Super Stardust&quot; was released in 1994 for AGA Amigas, in 1995 for Amiga CD32, and finally in 1996 for the IBM PC compatible platform as well (the latter also known as &quot;Super Stardust &#x27;96&quot;). The Amiga CD32 and IBM PC compatible versions were released on CD and featured a CD soundtrack from Slusnik Luna, FMV cut-scenes, high speed gameplay and completely new levels and enemies.

In April 2007, Bloodhouse&#x27;s successor Housemarque developed &quot;Super Stardust HD&quot;, released by Sony Computer Entertainment as a downloadable PlayStation Network game for the PlayStation 3.

In February 2012, &quot;Super Stardust Delta&quot; was released on the PlayStation Network as a downloadable title for the PlayStation Vita.

Sony Interactive Entertainment owns the game and its sequels, as they had acquired Housemarque in 2021 through PlayStation Studios.
