<text>Depression is a mental state of low mood and aversion to activity. It affects about 3.5% of the global population, or about 280 million people worldwide, as of 2020. Depression affects a person&#x27;s thoughts, behavior, feelings, and sense of well-being. The pleasure or joy that a person gets from certain experiences is reduced, and the afflicted person often experiences a loss of motivation or interest in those activities. People with depression may experience sadness, feelings of dejection or hopelessness, difficulty in thinking and concentration, or a significant change in appetite or time spent sleeping; suicidal thoughts can also be experienced.

Depression can have multiple, sometimes overlapping, origins. Depression can be a symptom of some mood disorders, some of which are also commonly called &quot;depression&quot;, such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and dysthymia. Additionally, depression can be a normal temporary reaction to life events, such as the loss of a loved one. Depression is also a symptom of some physical diseases and a side effect of some drugs and medical treatments. 

== Contributing factors ==
=== Life events ===
Adversity in childhood, such as bereavement, neglect, mental abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, or unequal parental treatment of siblings, can contribute to depression in adulthood. Childhood physical or sexual abuse in particular significantly correlates with the likelihood of experiencing depression over the survivor&#x27;s lifetime. People who have experienced four or more adverse childhood experiences are 3.2 to 4.0 times more likely to suffer from depression. Poor housing quality, non-functionality, lack of green spaces, and exposure to noise and air pollution are linked to depressive moods, emphasizing the need for consideration in planning to prevent such outcomes. Locality has also been linked to depression and other negative moods. The rate of depression among those who reside in large urban areas is shown to be lower than those who do not. Likewise, those from smaller towns and rural areas tend to have higher rates of depression, anxiety, and psychological unwellness.

Studies have consistently shown that physicians have had the highest depression and suicide rates compared to people in many other lines of work—for suicide, 40% higher for male physicians and 130% higher for female physicians.

Life events and changes that may cause depressed mood includes, but are not limited to, childbirth, menopause, financial difficulties, unemployment, stress (such as from work, education, military service, family, living conditions, marriage, etc.), a medical diagnosis (cancer, HIV, diabetes, etc.), bullying, loss of a loved one, natural disasters, social isolation, rape, relationship troubles, jealousy, separation, or catastrophic injury. Similar depressive symptoms are associated with survivor&#x27;s guilt. Adolescents may be especially prone to experiencing a depressed mood following social rejection, peer pressure, or bullying.

==== Childhood and adolescence ====

Depression in childhood and adolescence is similar to adult major depressive disorder, although young sufferers may exhibit increased irritability or behavioral dyscontrol instead of the more common sad, empty, or hopeless feelings seen with adults. Children who are under stress, experiencing loss, or have other underlying disorders are at a higher risk for depression. Childhood depression is often comorbid with mental disorders outside of other mood disorders; most commonly anxiety disorder and conduct disorder. Depression also tends to run in families.

=== Personality ===
Depression is associated with low extraversion, and people who have high levels of neuroticism are more likely to experience depressive symptoms and are more likely to receive a diagnosis of a depressive disorder. Additionally, depression is associated with low conscientiousness. Some factors that may arise from low conscientiousness include disorganization and dissatisfaction with life. Individuals may be more exposed to stress and depression as a result of these factors.

=== Side effect of medical treatment ===
It is possible that some early generation beta-blockers induce depression in some patients, though the evidence for this is weak and conflicting. There is strong evidence for a link between alpha interferon therapy and depression. One study found that a third of alpha interferon-treated patients had developed depression after three months of treatment. (&quot;Beta&quot; interferon therapy appears to have no effect on rates of depression.) There is moderately strong evidence that finasteride when used in the treatment of alopecia increases depressive symptoms in some patients. Evidence linking isotretinoin, an acne treatment, to depression is strong. Other medicines that seem to increase the risk of depression include anticonvulsants, antimigraine drugs, antipsychotics and hormonal agents such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist.

=== Substance-induced ===
Several drugs of abuse can cause or exacerbate depression, whether in intoxication, withdrawal, and from chronic use. These include alcohol, sedatives (including prescription benzodiazepines), opioids (including prescription pain killers and illicit drugs such as heroin), stimulants (such as cocaine and amphetamines), hallucinogens, and inhalants.

=== Non-psychiatric illnesses ===

Depressed mood can be the result of a number of infectious diseases, nutritional deficiencies, neurological conditions, and physiological problems, including hypoandrogenism (in men), Addison&#x27;s disease, Cushing&#x27;s syndrome, pernicious anemia, hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, Lyme disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, celiac disease, chronic pain, stroke, diabetes, cancer, and HIV.

Studies have found that anywhere from 30 to 85 percent of patients suffering from chronic pain are also clinically depressed. A 2014 study by Hooley et al. concluded that chronic pain increased the chance of death by suicide by two to three times. In 2017, the British Medical Association found that 49% of UK chronic pain patients also had depression.

As many as 1/3 of stroke survivors will later develop post-stroke depression. Because strokes may cause damage to the parts of the brain involved in processing emotions, reward, and cognition, stroke may be considered a direct cause of depression.

=== Psychiatric syndromes ===

A number of psychiatric syndromes feature depressed mood as a main symptom. The mood disorders are a group of disorders considered to be primary disturbances of mood. These include major depressive disorder (commonly called major depression or clinical depression) where a person has at least two weeks of depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities; and dysthymia, a state of chronic depressed mood, the symptoms of which do not meet the severity of a major depressive episode. Another mood disorder, bipolar disorder, features one or more episodes of abnormally elevated mood, cognition, and energy levels, but may also involve one or more episodes of depression. Individuals with bipolar depression are often misdiagnosed with unipolar depression. When the course of depressive episodes follows a seasonal pattern, the disorder (major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, etc.) may be described as a seasonal affective disorder.

Outside the mood disorders: borderline personality disorder often features an extremely intense depressive mood; adjustment disorder with depressed mood is a psychological response to an identifiable event or stressor, in which the resulting emotional or behavioral symptoms are significant but do not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode; and posttraumatic stress disorder, a mental disorder that sometimes follows trauma, is commonly accompanied by depressed mood.

=== Inflammation ===
=== Historical legacy ===
Research suggests possible associations between Neanderthal genetics and some forms of depression.

Authors and researchers have begun to conceptualize ways in which the historical legacies of racism and colonialism may create depressive conditions. Given the lived experiences of marginalized peoples, ranging from conditions of migration, class stratification, cultural genocide, labor exploitation, and social immobility, depression can be seen as a &quot;rational response to global conditions&quot;, according to Ann Cvetkovich.

Psychogeographical depression overlaps somewhat with the theory of &quot;deprejudice&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;depression&quot; and &quot;prejudice&quot; proposed by Cox, Abramson, Devine, and Hollon in 2012, who argue for an integrative approach to studying the often comorbid experiences. Cox, Abramson, Devine, and Hollon are concerned with the ways in which social stereotypes are often internalized, creating negative self-stereotypes that then produce depressive symptoms.

Unlike the theory of &quot;deprejudice&quot;, a psychogeographical theory of depression attempts to broaden study of the subject beyond an individual experience to one produced on a societal scale, seeing particular manifestations of depression as rooted in dispossession; historical legacies of genocide, slavery, and colonialism are productive of segregation, both material and psychic material deprivation, and concomitant circumstances of violence, systemic exclusion, and lack of access to legal protections. The demands of navigating these circumstances compromise the resources available to a population to seek comfort, health, stability, and sense of security. The historical memory of this trauma conditions the psychological health of future generations, making psychogeographical depression an intergenerational experience as well. 

This work is supported by recent studies in genetic science which has demonstrated an epigenetic link between the trauma suffered by Holocaust survivors and genetic reverberations in subsequent generations.

== Measures ==
Measures of depression include, but are not limited to: Beck Depression Inventory-11 and the 9-item depression scale in the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Both of these measures are psychological tests that ask personal questions of the participant, and have mostly been used to measure the severity of depression. The Beck Depression Inventory is a self-report scale that helps a therapist identify the patterns of depression symptoms and monitor recovery. The responses on this scale can be discussed in therapy to devise interventions for the most distressing symptoms of depression.

== Theories ==
There are multiple schools of depression theory. Beck&#x27;s cognitive triad theorizes that an individual with depression has &quot;automatic, spontaneous, and seemingly uncontrollable negative thoughts&quot; about the self, the world or environment, and the future. The Tripartite Model of Anxiety and Depression helps to explain the common comorbidity of anxiety and depression by separating symptoms into three groups: negative affect, positive affect, and physiological hyperarousal. The epigenetics of depression is the study of how epigenetics (heritable characteristics that do not involve changes in DNA sequence) contribute to depression. Behavioral theories of depression explain the etiology of depression with behavioral science; adherents promote the use of behavioral therapies for treatment. Evolutionary approaches to depression are attempts by evolutionary psychologists and evolutionary psychiatrists to use the theory of evolution to further understand mood disorders. The biology of depression is the attempt to identify a biochemical origin of depression, as opposed to theories that emphasize psychological or situational causes.

== Management ==

Depressed mood may not require professional treatment, and may be a normal temporary reaction to life events, a symptom of some medical condition, or a side effect of some drugs or medical treatments. A prolonged depressed mood, especially in combination with other symptoms, may lead to a diagnosis of a psychiatric or medical condition which may benefit from treatment.

The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2009 guidelines indicate that antidepressants should not be routinely used for the initial treatment of mild depression, because the risk-benefit ratio is poor.

Physical activity has a protective effect against the emergence of depression in some people. Increased daily step counts have been associated with lower depressive symptoms.

There is limited evidence suggesting yoga may help some people with depressive disorders or elevated levels of depression, but more research is needed.

Reminiscence of old and fond memories is another alternative form of treatment, especially for the elderly who have lived longer and have more experiences in life. It is a method that causes a person to recollect memories of their own life, leading to a process of self-recognition and identifying familiar stimuli. By maintaining one&#x27;s personal past and identity, it is a technique that stimulates people to view their lives in a more objective and balanced way, causing them to pay attention to positive information in their life stories, which would successfully reduce depressive mood levels.

There is limited evidence that continuing antidepressant medication for one year reduces the risk of depression recurrence with no additional harm. Recommendations for psychological treatments or combination treatments in preventing recurrence are not clear.

==Epidemiology==

Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, the United Nations (UN) health agency reported, estimating that it affects more than 300 million people worldwide – the majority of them women, young people and the elderly. An estimated 4.4 percent of the global population has depression, according to a report released by the UN World Health Organization (WHO), which shows an 18 percent increase in the number of people living with depression between 2005 and 2015.

Depression is a major mental-health cause of disease burden. Its consequences further lead to significant burden in public health, including a higher risk of dementia, premature mortality arising from physical disorders, and maternal depression impacts on child growth and development. Approximately 76% to 85% of depressed people in low- and middle-income countries do not receive treatment; barriers to treatment include: inaccurate assessment, lack of trained health-care providers, social stigma and lack of resources.

The stigma comes from misguided societal views that people with mental illness are different from everyone else, and they can choose to get better only if they wanted to. Due to this more than half of the people with depression do not receive help with their disorders. The stigma leads to a strong preference for privacy. An analysis of 40,350 undergraduates from 70 institutions by Posselt and Lipson found that undergraduates who perceived their classroom environments as highly competitive had a 37% higher chance of developing depression and a 69% higher chance of developing anxiety. Several studies have suggested that unemployment roughly doubles the risk of developing depression.

The World Health Organization has constructed guidelines – known as The Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) – aiming to increase services for people with mental, neurological and substance-use disorders. Depression is listed as one of conditions prioritized by the programme. Trials conducted show possibilities for the implementation of the programme in low-resource primary-care settings dependent on primary-care practitioners and lay health-workers.
Examples of mhGAP-endorsed therapies targeting depression include Group Interpersonal Therapy as group treatment for depression and &quot;Thinking Health&quot;, which utilizes cognitive behavioral therapy to tackle perinatal depression. Furthermore, effective screening in primary care is crucial for the access of treatments. The mhGAP adopted its approach of improving detection rates of depression by training general practitioners. However, there is still weak evidence supporting this training.

According to 2011 study, people who are high in hypercompetitive traits are also likely to measure higher for depression and anxiety.

== History ==
The term &quot;depression&quot; was derived from the Latin verb , &quot;to press down&quot;. From the 14th century, &quot;to depress&quot; meant to subjugate or to bring down in spirits. It was used in 1665 in English author Richard Baker&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot; to refer to someone having &quot;a great depression of spirit&quot;, and by English author Samuel Johnson in a similar sense in 1753.

In Ancient Greece, disease was thought due to an imbalance in the four basic bodily fluids, or &quot;humors&quot;. Personality types were similarly thought to be determined by the dominant humor in a particular person. Derived from the Ancient Greek , &quot;black&quot;, and , &quot;bile&quot;, melancholia was described as a distinct disease with particular mental and physical symptoms by Hippocrates in his &quot;Aphorisms&quot;, where he characterized all &quot;fears and despondencies, if they last a long time&quot; as being symptomatic of the ailment.

During the 18th century, the humoral theory of melancholia was increasingly being challenged by mechanical and electrical explanations; references to dark and gloomy states gave way to ideas of slowed circulation and depleted energy. German physician Johann Christian Heinroth, however, argued melancholia was a disturbance of the soul due to moral conflict within the patient.

In the 20th century, the German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin distinguished manic depression. The influential system put forward by Kraepelin unified nearly all types of mood disorder into &quot;manic–depressive insanity&quot;. Kraepelin worked from an assumption of underlying brain pathology, but also promoted a distinction between endogenous (internally caused) and exogenous (externally caused) types.

Other psycho-dynamic theories were proposed. Existential and humanistic theories represented a forceful affirmation of individualism. Austrian existential psychiatrist Viktor Frankl connected depression to feelings of futility and meaninglessness. Frankl&#x27;s logotherapy addressed the filling of an &quot;existential vacuum&quot; associated with such feelings, and may be particularly useful for depressed adolescents.

Researchers theorized that depression was caused by a chemical imbalance in neurotransmitters in the brain, a theory based on observations made in the 1950s of the effects of reserpine and isoniazid in altering monoamine neurotransmitter levels and affecting depressive symptoms. During the 1960s and 70s, manic-depression came to refer to just one type of mood disorder (now most commonly known as bipolar disorder) which was distinguished from (unipolar) depression. The terms unipolar and bipolar had been coined by German psychiatrist Karl Kleist.

In July 2022, British psychiatrist Joanna Moncrieff, also psychiatrist Mark Horowtiz and others proposed in a study on academic journal &quot;Molecular Psychiatry&quot; that depression is not caused by a serotonin imbalance in the human body, unlike what most of the psychiatry community points to, and that therefore anti-depressants do not work against the illness. However, such study was met with criticism from some psychiatrists, who argued the study&#x27;s methodology used an indirect trace of serotonin, instead of taking direct measurements of the molecule. Moncrieff said that, despite her study&#x27;s conclusions, no one should interrupt their treatment if they are taking any anti-depressant.

<text>Arash the Archer ( &quot;Āraš-e Kamāngīr&quot;) is a heroic archer-figure of Iranian mythology. According to Iranian folklore, the boundary between Iran and Turan was set by an arrow launched by Arash, after he put his own life in the arrow&#x27;s launch. The arrow was traveling for days before finally landing on the other side of the Oxus on the bark of a walnut tree hundreds of miles away from the original launch site atop a mountain.

==Origins of the name==
Although several sources (e.g. al-Biruni) appear to have considered &#x27;Arash&#x27; to be the origin of the name &#x27;Arshak&#x27; (i.e. Arsaces), the name of the Parthian dynasty derives from a Parthian or Eastern Iranian equivalent of &#x27;Ardashir&#x27;, i.e. &#x27;Artaxerxes&#x27;, specifically Artaxerxes II, from whom the Arsacids claimed descent. (Within the scheme of the mythologically conflated genealogies of Iranian dynasts, the Arsacids also claimed to descend—via the other Arash—from Kai Kobad.)

As is typical for names from oral tradition, there are numerous variations of &#x27;Arash&#x27;. In the Avesta the name appears as &#x27;Erekhsha&#x27; (&quot;Ǝrəxša&quot;) &quot;of the swift arrow, having the swiftest arrow among the Iranians&quot; (&quot;Yasht&quot; 8.6). This Avestan-language form continues in Zoroastrian Middle Persian as &#x27;Erash&#x27; (&quot;Bundahishn&quot;, &quot;Shahrastanha-i Eran&quot;, &quot;Zand-i Vahuman Yasht&quot;, &quot;Mah i Frawardin&quot;), from which the anglicized &#x27;Eruch&#x27; derives. New Persian forms include &#x27;Erash&#x27; and &#x27;Irash&#x27; in al-Tabari and ibn al-Atir; Aarashshebatir in al-Tabari; &#x27;Arash&#x27; in al-Talebi; &#x27;Aarash&#x27; in Maqdesi, Balami, Mojmal, Marasi, al-Biruni, and in the Vis o Ramin of Gorgani. Names with a stock epithet representing the Avestan &quot;swift arrow&quot; include al-Tabari&#x27;s &#x27;Aarashshebatir&#x27; and Mojmal&#x27;s &#x27;Arash-e Shewatir&#x27;. A surname form includes &#x27;Arash/Aarash kaman-gir&#x27; &quot;Arash, bow-expert.&quot; Also it’s a common name for people that lived there.

==Summary==
The basic story of the bowman runs as follows: In a war between the Iranians and Turanians over the &quot;royal glory&quot; (&quot;khwarrah&quot;), the Turanian general Afrasiab has surrounded the forces of the righteous Manuchehr, and the two sides agree to make peace. Both reach an agreement that whatever land falls within the range of a bow-shot shall be returned to the Manuchehr and the Iranians, and the rest should then fall to Afrasiab and the Aniranians. An angel (in al-Biruni it is &quot;Isfandaramad&quot;, i.e. the Amesha Spenta Spenta Armaiti, in Middle Persian called &quot;Spendarmad&quot;) instructs Manuchehr to construct a special bow and arrow, and Arash is asked to be the archer. Arash then fires the specially-prepared arrow at dawn, which then traveled a great distance (see below) before finally landing and so marking the future border between the Iranians and the Aniranians.

In Talebi and Bal&#x27;ami, Arash is destroyed by the shot and disappears. In al-Tabari, he is exalted by the people, is appointed commander of the archers and lives out his life in great honor. The distance the arrow travels varies: in one, it is a thousand leagues (&quot;farsakhs&quot;), and in another, forty days&#x27; walk. In several, the arrow traveled from dawn to noon; in others, from dawn until sunset. A few sources specify a particular date for the event. The Middle Persian &quot;Mah i Frawardin&quot; notes the 6th day of the 1st month (i.e. Khordad of Frawardin); later sources associate the event with the name-day festivities of Tiregan (13th of Tir) &quot;presumably&quot; provoked by the homonymity with the &quot;Yazata&quot; Tir or &quot;tir&quot; &quot;arrow.&quot; ()

The location from which Arash fired his arrow varies as well. In the Avesta (which does not mention places in Western Iran), it is &quot;Airyo.khshaotha&quot;, an unidentified location in the Middle Clime. Islamic-era sources typically place the location of the shot somewhere just south of the Caspian Sea, variously in Tabaristan (Tabari, Talebi, Maqdesi, Ibn al-Athir, Marashi) and (al-Biruni, Gardēzī); Amol fortress (Mojmal); Mount Damavand (Balami) or Sari (Gorgani). The place the arrow landed is variously identified as &#x27;Mount Khvanvant&#x27; in the Avesta (likewise an unknown location); a river in Balkh (Tabari, al-Atir); east of Balkh (Talebi); Bactria/Tokharistan (Maqdesi, Gardizi); the banks of the Oxus River (Balami) or Merv (Mojmal). According to al-Biruni, it hit a walnut tree between &quot;Fargana&quot; and Tabaristan &quot;in the furthest reaches of [Greater] Khorasan.&quot;

The name Arash remains a popular name among Iranians.

== Modern legend ==
Siavash Kasraie, an Iranian poet, wrote the long poem of &quot;Arash the Archer&quot; in 1959. This epic narrative, based on the ancient Persian myth, depicts Arash&#x27;s heroic sacrifice to liberate his country from foreign domination. Bahram Beyzai wrote &quot;Āraš&quot;, which opened in 1977, as a response to Āraš-e kamāngīr. Neither a short story nor a play, Beyzai&#x27;s &quot;Āraš&quot; was staged a number of times around the world, most notably at the Annenberg Auditorium at Stanford University, in July 2013.

== Arash Kamangir&#x27;s golden arrow ==
The unveiling ceremony of Arash Kamangir&#x27;s golden arrow (peace, romantic defense) was held by the Nowruz World Institute on the occasion of World Peace Day (20 September 2020). Arash Kamangir&#x27;s symbolic look at an arrow adorned with gold and jewelry is in fact an artistic ideal in the form of depicting myths that are all peaceful.

<text>The Philippine tarsier (Carlito syrichta), known locally as mawumag in Cebuano and other Visayan languages, and magô in Waray, is a species of tarsier endemic to the Philippines. It is found in the southeastern part of the archipelago, particularly on the islands of Bohol, Samar and Leyte. It is a member of the approximately 45-million-year-old family Tarsiidae, whose name is derived from its elongated &quot;tarsus&quot; or ankle bone. Formerly a member of the genus &quot;Tarsius&quot;, it is now listed as the only member of the genus Carlito, a new genus named after the conservationist Carlito Pizarras.

Its geographic range also includes Maripipi Island, Siargao Island, Basilan Island and Dinagat Island. Tarsiers have also been reported in Sarangani, although they may be different subspecies. &lt;includeonly&gt;Tribal people like the B&#x27;laans and T&#x27;bolis have been, for a long time, reporting sightings in the province of Sarangani. Unfortunately, these reports were merely discarded as a hoax until March 30, 2002, when a pair of these tiny nocturnal mammals was captured in the mountainous areas of the municipalities of Maitum and Kiamba and was brought to the public, proving that this species exists in this coastal province.&lt;/includeonly&gt;

== Etymology and taxonomic history ==

The tarsier is named for its elongated &quot;tarsus&quot; or ankle bone. The genus Carlito is named after conservationist Carlito Pizarras.
The Philippine tarsier is known as &quot;mawumag&quot; in Cebuano and other Visayan languages, and &quot;magô&quot; in Waray, It is also known as &quot;mamag&quot;, &quot;magau&quot;, &quot;malmag&quot;, and &quot;magatilok-iok&quot;.

===Taxonomic classification===

The Philippine tarsier is the only member of the genus &quot;Carlito&quot; and a member of the family Tarsiidae. Three subspecies are presently recognised.
*Family Tarsiidae
**Genus &quot;Tarsius&quot;: found in Sulawesi
**Genus &quot;Cephalopachus&quot;: found in Sundaland
**Genus &quot;Carlito&quot;: found in Greater Mindanao
***Species &quot;Carlito syrichta&quot;
****Subspecies &quot;Carlito syrichta syrichta&quot; from Leyte and Samar
****Subspecies &quot;Carlito syrichta fraterculus&quot; from Bohol
****Subspecies &quot;Carlito syrichta carbonarius&quot; from Mindanao

===Changes in taxonomy===
Previously all living tarsiers had been placed in the genus &quot;Tarsius&quot;, but a 2010 taxonomic revision by Shekelle and Groves placed the distinctive Philippine tarsier in its own genus, &quot;Carlito&quot;. 

The Philippine tarsier was introduced to Western biologists in the 18th century through the missionary J.G. Camel&#x27;s description given to J. Petiver of an animal said to have come from the Philippines. Petiver published Camel&#x27;s description in 1705 and named the animal &quot;Cercopithecus luzonis minimus&quot; which was the basis for Linnaeus&#x27; (1758) &quot;Simia syrichta&quot; and eventually &quot;Carlito syrichta&quot;, the current scientific name.

The IUCN taxonomic note lists two subspecies, but the non-nominate one is poorly defined at present, so the species is treated as a whole. &quot;Tarsius syrichta carbonarius&quot; and &quot;Tarsius s. fraterculus&quot; were recognized by Hill (1955) as weakly defined subspecies. Niemitz (1984) found the differences to be insignificant based upon comparisons with museum specimens. Musser and Dagosto (1987) felt that the available museum specimens were insufficient to resolve the issue, but mentioned that Heaney felt that a single male tarsier from Dinagat might be distinct. Groves (2001) did not recognize any subspecies of &quot;C. syrichta&quot;, but Groves and Shekelle (2010) recognized the subspecies &quot;C. s. fraterculus&quot;, &quot;C. s. syrichta&quot;, and &quot;C. s. carbonarius&quot; when splitting the species of &quot;Tarsius&quot; into &quot;Carlito&quot;.

== Anatomy and morphology ==

The Philippine tarsier measures in height, making it one of the smallest primates. The small size makes it difficult to spot. The mass for males is between , usually lighter for females, somewhat heavier than other tarsiers such as the pygmy tarsier. The average adult is about the size of an adult human fist.

The female tarsier has multiple sets of breasts, but the only functional set is at the pectoralis. The other breasts are used as anchor points for the newborn tarsiers. The gestation period lasts 180 days, or 6 months, after which only one tarsier is born. The newborn tarsier is born with much fur and eyes open. Its body and head length is about , and its tail is around long.

Like all tarsiers, the Philippine tarsier&#x27;s eyes are fixed in its skull; they cannot move in their sockets. Instead, a special adaptation in the neck allows its round head to be rotated 180°. Their eyes are disproportionately large, having the largest eye-to-body weight ratio of all mammals. These huge eyes provide this nocturnal animal with excellent night vision. In bright light, the tarsier&#x27;s eyes can constrict until the pupil appears to be only a thin spot. In low light or darkness, the pupil can dilate and fill up almost the entire eye. The large membranous ears are mobile, appearing to be almost constantly moving, allowing the tarsier to hear any movement.
The Philippine tarsier has thin, rough fur which is colored gray to dark brown. The narrow tail, usually used for balance, is bald except for a tuft of hair at the end, and is about twice the body length. Its elongated &quot;tarsus&quot;, or ankle bone, which gives the tarsier its name, allows it to jump at least from tree to tree. Its long digits are tipped with rounded pads that allow &quot;C. syrichta&quot; to cling easily to trees and to grip almost any surface. The thumb is not truly opposable, but the first toe is. All of the digits have flattened nails, except for the second and third toes, which have sharp claws specialized for grooming.

Their dental formula is , with relatively small upper canines.

== Ecology ==
The Philippine tarsier is primarily insectivorous, its diet consists of insects, spiders, small crustaceans, and small vertebrates such as small lizards and birds. &quot;C. syrichta&quot; preys on live insects, particularly crickets and grasshoppers. Upon seizing its prey, the tarsier carries it to its mouth using both hands.

=== Geographic range and habitat ===

The Philippine tarsier, as its name suggests, is endemic to the Philippine archipelago. &quot;C. syrichta&quot; populations are generally found in the southeastern part of the archipelago. Established populations are present primarily on the islands of Bohol, Samar, Leyte and Mindanao. It has also been found on various isolated islands within its known range, such as Maripipi Island, Siargao Island, Basilan Island and Dinagat Island.

The Philippine tarsier&#x27;s habitat is the second-growth, secondary forest, and primary forest from sea level to . Its habitat also includes tropical rainforest with dense vegetation and trees that offer it protection such as tall grasses, bushes, and bamboo shoots. It prefers dense, low-level vegetation in secondary forests, with perching sites averaging above the ground.

Early studies showed that the Philippine tarsier has a home range of , but more recent research shows that home ranges averaged for males and for females , allowing for a density of 16 male and 41 female tarsiers per .

Both males and females are solitary, but will occasionally cross paths at night. They travel up to across the forest and the optimal area is more than .

=== Predators ===

Besides human hunters, feral cats banished from nearby communities are the species&#x27; main predators, though some large birds are known to prey on it, as well. Because of its nocturnal and arboreal habits, the Philippine tarsier is most likely to fall prey to owls, or to small carnivores which it can encounter in its canopy homes.

== Behavior ==

The Philippine tarsier is a shy, nocturnal animal that leads a mostly hidden life. During the day, it sleeps in dark hollows close to the ground, near tree trunks and shrubs deep in the impenetrable bushes and forests. It becomes active only at night; with its keen sight and ability to manoeuvre around trees, it is able to avoid humans.

It is arboreal, habitually clinging vertically to trees and capable of leaping from branch to branch.

The Philippine tarsier is solitary. However, populations and individuals have been found to have either monogamous or polygamous mating patterns.

=== Communication ===
Three different audible calls have been documented. One is its &quot;loud call&quot;—a piercing single note. The second sound is a soft, sweet, bird-like twill, a sound of contentment. When several tarsiers come together, the combined effect of this chirping is a locust-like sound.

These mammals can also vocalize in an ultrasound frequency range of 70 kHz and can pick up frequencies above 90 kHz. This form of vocal communication is used as a distress call made by infants when they are separated from their mothers. It is also the call made by males to their mates during mating season.

Tarsiers also communicate through a scent from the circumoral gland located around the mouth, which the female uses to mark her mate. The males mark their territory with their urine. Tarsiers perform tactile communication through social grooming, removing dead skin and parasites, a behaviour observed in females on adult males, as well as in females on their offspring.

=== Reproduction ===
The Philippine tarsier&#x27;s gestation period lasts about six months, while the female&#x27;s estrous cycle lasts 25–28 days. The mating season lasts from April to May. The males deposit a mating plug in the female&#x27;s vagina after intercourse. The female gives birth to one offspring per gestation. The infant is born with hair and with its eyes open. The females carry their infants in their mouths. A newborn can already cling to branches and in less than a month after birth, it can start leaping. 

Newborns are breastfed until 60 days after birth. After two years of age, the tarsier is sexually mature and able to reproduce.

== Status ==
In 1986, 1988, and 1990, the Philippine tarsier was assessed as endangered by the IUCN Conservation Monitoring Centre. On September 13, 1991, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources issued DENR Administrative Order Number 48 (DAO 48), which also listed the Philippine tarsier as endangered.

In 1996, it was assessed as lower risk/conservation-dependent by Baillie and Groom-bridge. In 2000, the IUCN assessed the Philippine tarsier as data deficient, which means that inadequate information was available to make a direct or indirect assessment of its risks of extinction based on its distribution and/or population status.

The most recent IUCN red list assessment, in 2008, classified the Philippine tarsier as near threatened. This classification is based on an estimated significant decline over the last three generations (about 20 years), but less than 30%, due to habitat loss and because of poaching for the pet trade.

The Philippine tarsier is listed in Appendix II of CITES, and the U.S. ESA classifies it as threatened.

A tarsier sanctuary is maintained in the town of Corella (Bohol). Run by the Philippine Tarsier Foundation, it has a visitor centre and habitat preserve with an area of in a natural forest.

=== Threats in the wild ===

For the past 45 million years, tarsiers have inhabited rainforests around the world, but now they exist on only a few islands in the Philippines, Borneo, and Indonesia. In Bohol, the Philippine tarsier was a common sight in the southern part of the island until the 1960s. Since then, the number has dropped to around 700 on the island according to the Philippine Tarsier Foundation.

Due to the quickly growing human population, which causes more and more forests to be converted to farmland, housing areas, and roads, the place where the Philippine tarsier can live its secluded life is disappearing. The dwindling of Philippine forests—the Philippine tarsier&#x27;s natural forest habitat—has posed a grave and significant threat to the survival of the Philippine tarsier. Indiscriminate and illegal logging, cutting of trees for firewood, &quot;kaingin&quot; or slash and burn method of agriculture, and human urbanization have encroached on the habitats of the tarsier.

Paradoxically, indigenous superstition, coupled with relatively thick rainforest, particularly in Sarangani province, has apparently preserved this endangered species. Indigenous tribes leave the Philippine tarsiers in the wild because they fear that these animals could bring bad luck.

=== Survival in captivity ===

Tarsiers in the Philippines have been sought out as pets or sold for trade, despite their low survival rate outside of their natural habitat, where they feed on live insects. Displays by private people in Loboc, Bohol tend to diminish the lives of tarsiers. Further, some feel that the display of captive tarsiers might encourage tourists to acquire them illegally as pets.

Tarsiers do not do well in captivity. Life expectancy decreases by 2 to 12 years (if taken from the wild), as compared to the 24 years the tarsier can live to in the wild. The tarsier can develop sore eyes, which is an indication of a poor diet. Also, the lighting usually used in captivity can cause long-lasting damage to the eyes. Another danger of captivity is the creature&#x27;s tendency to commit suicide. Because the tarsier is often shy and nervous, many activities associated with captivity (such as camera flashes, being touched, and being kept in an enclosure) stresses the animal. Such stress leads to the tarsier hitting its head against objects, thus killing it because of its thin skull.

=== Conservation legislation ===
Several laws have been passed to protect and conserve the Philippine tarsier. DENR Administrative Order No. 38, Series of 1991 (DAO No. 38) included the Philippine tarsier among the national protected wildlife species and proposed its listing under Appendix 1 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Moreover, the IUCN/SSC Primate Specialist Group had given the species Conservation Priority Rating 4, which means that the species is highly vulnerable and threatened by habitat destruction and/or hunting.

Republic Act No. 7586, otherwise known as the National Integrated Protected Areas System (NIPAS) Act of 1991 mandates the establishment of appropriate sanctuaries to preserve and protect the Philippine tarsier.

Proclamation 1030 was enacted on June 23, 1997, declaring the Philippine tarsier a specially protected faunal species. 

Also, legislation at other local levels includes provincial ordinances and proclamations (Bohol Province), municipal ordinances (Corella), and Barangay ordinances (Canapnapan, etc.).

On July 30, 2001, Republic Act No. 914, also known as the Wildlife Resources Conservation and Protection Act, was enacted. The law provided for the conservation and protection of wildlife resources and their habitats, including the Philippine tarsier, and its inclusion as a flagship species.

=== Conservation initiatives ===
Two groups are involved in the conservation of the Philippine tarsier: Endangered Species International (ESI) and the Philippine Tarsier Foundation. ESI works in Mindanao Island where the conservation group created a tarsier sanctuary, planted endangered trees to reforest tarsier habitat, and conducts research and educational activities. In partnership with local groups and government, ESI established the tarsier trail including a viewpoint on habitat. Interpretative boards about plants and animals found in the sanctuary are displayed.

===Province===
The province of Kalamata () was one of the provinces of the Messenia Prefecture. Its territory corresponded with that of the current municipalities Kalamata and West Mani. It was abolished in 2006.

==History==

Kalamata occupies the site of an ancient city, the identity of which has been disputed. The name clearly refers to ancient Calamae, but it has been established in the 20th century that the actual site is that of ancient Pharae, a city already mentioned by Homer. It was long believed that the area that the city presently occupies was covered by the sea during ancient times, but the proto-Greek and Archaic-period remains (Temple of Poseidon) that were unearthed at Akovitika region prove otherwise.

===Middle Ages===

Pharae was rather unimportant in antiquity, and the site continued in obscurity until middle Byzantine times. Kalamata is first mentioned in the 10th-century &quot;Life of St. Nikon the Metanoeite&quot; with its modern name. Medieval Kalamata was not a port, as the local coast offered no shelter to ships from the weather, but lay further inland, at the foot of the western outliers of Mount Taygetos. As the capital of the fertile Messenian plain, the town experienced a period of prosperity in the 11th–12th centuries, as attested by the five surviving churches built in this period, including the Church of the Holy Apostles, as well as the comments of the Arab geographer al-Idrisi, who calls it a &quot;large and populous&quot; town. 

Following the Fourth Crusade, Kalamata was conquered by Frankish feudal lords William of Champlitte and Geoffrey of Villehardouin in 1205, when its Byzantine fortress was apparently in so bad a state that it could not be defended against them. Thus, the town became part of the Principality of Achaea, and after Champlitte granted its possession to Geoffrey of Villehardouin, the town was the center of the Villehardouins&#x27; patrimony in the Principality. Prince William II of Villehardouin was born and died there. After William II&#x27;s death in 1278, Kalamata remained in the hands of his widow, Anna Komnene Doukaina, but when she remarried to Nicholas II of Saint Omer, King Charles of Anjou was loath to see this important castle in the hands of a vassal, and in 1282 Anna exchanged it with lands elsewhere in Messenia.

In 1292 or 1293, two local Melingoi Slavic captains managed to capture the castle of Kalamata by a ruse and, aided by 600 of their fellow villagers, took over the entire lower town as well in the name of the Byzantine emperor, Andronikos II Palaiologos. Constable John Chauderon in vain tried to secure their surrender, and was sent to Constantinople, where Andronikos agreed to hand the town over, but then immediately ordered his governor in Mystras not to do so. In the event, the town was recovered by the Franks through the intercession of a local Greek, a certain Sgouromalles. In 1298, the town formed the dowry of Princess Matilda of Hainaut upon her marriage to Guy II de la Roche. Matilda retained Kalamata as her fief until 1322, when she was dispossessed and the territory reverted to the princely domain. In 1358, Prince Robert gifted the &quot;châtellenie&quot; of Kalamata (comprising also Port-de-Jonc and Mani) to his wife, Marie de Bourbon, who kept it until her death in 1377. The town remained one of the largest in the Morea—a 1391 document places it, with 300 hearths, on par with Glarentza—but it nevertheless declined in importance throughout the 14th and 15th centuries in favour of other nearby sites like Androusa. Kalamata remained in Frankish hands until near the end of the Principality of Achaea, coming under the control of the Byzantine Despotate of the Morea only in 1428.

=== Ottoman period and War of Independence ===

Kalamata was occupied by the Ottomans in 1481. In 1659, during the long war between Ottomans and Venetians over Crete, the Venetian commander Francesco Morosini, captured Kalamata in an effort to divert Ottoman attention from the Siege of Candia, and raise a wider revolt. The Venetian fleet took Kalamata without effort, as the Ottomans abandoned the town. The town and its castle were plundered and destroyed, and all able-bodied men were carried off to serve as rowers in the Venetian galleys. Morosini returned in 1685, at the start of the Morean War: on 14 September 1685 the Venetians defeated an Ottoman army before Kalamata, and again plundered and destroyed the town&#x27;s castle, as it was judged obsolete. Kalamata was then ruled by Venice as part of the &quot;Kingdom of the Morea&quot; (). During the Venetian occupation the city was developed and thrived economically. However, the Ottomans reoccupied Kalamata in the war of 1715 and controlled it until the Greek War of Independence.
Kalamata was the first city to be liberated as the Greeks rose in the Greek War of Independence. On 23 March 1821, it was taken over by the Greek revolutionary forces under the command of generals Theodoros Kolokotronis, Petros Mavromichalis and Papaflessas. However, in 1825, the invading Ottoman officer Ibrahim Pasha destroyed the city.

=== Modern period ===

In independent Greece, Kalamata was rebuilt and became one of the most important ports in the Mediterranean Sea. It is not surprising that the second-oldest Chamber of Commerce in the Mediterranean, after that of Marseille, exists in Kalamata. In 1934, a large strike of harbor workers occurred in Kalamata. The strike was violently suppressed by the government, resulting in the death of five workers and two other residents of the town.

During World War II on 29 April 1941, a battle was fought near the port between the invading German forces and the 2nd New Zealand Division, for which Jack Hinton was later awarded the Victoria Cross. Kalamata was liberated on 9 September 1944, after a battle between ELAS and the local Nazi collaborators.

Kalamata was again in the news on 13 September 1986, when it was hit by an earthquake that measured 6.2 on the surface wave magnitude scale. It was described as &quot;moderately strong&quot; but caused heavy damage throughout the city, killed 20 people and injured 330 others. 

Kalamata has developed into a modern provincial capital and has returned to growth in recent years. Today, Kalamata has the second largest population and mercantile activity in Peloponnese. It makes important exports, particularly of local products such as raisins, olives and olive oil. It is also the seat of the Metropolitan Bishop of Messenia. The current Metropolitan Bishop is Chrysostomus III of Kalamata, since 15 March 2007.

===Cathedral of Ypapanti===
Kalamata&#x27;s cathedral of the &quot;Ypapanti&quot; (Presentation of the Lord to the Temple) nestles beneath the 14th-century Frankish castle. The foundation stone was laid on 25 January 1860, and the building was consecrated on 19 August 1873. It suffered great damage during the 1986 earthquake, but was subsequently restored. The Festival of the &quot;Ypapanti&quot; (27 January through 9 February) is of national importance for the Greek Orthodox Church and, locally, the occasion for a holiday (2 February), when the litany of what is believed to be a miraculous icon, first introduced in 1889, takes place.

In late January 2010, the city hosted the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the cathedral. He was offered the golden key of the city. The region around Kalamata has provided two Ecumenical patriarchs in the past.

==Economy==
Kalamata&#x27;s Chamber of Commerce is the second-oldest in the Mediterranean after Marseille. Kalamata is well known for its black Kalamata olives.

Karelia Tobacco Company has been in operation in Kalamata since 1888.

==Historical population==
==Climate==
According to the meteorological station in the nearby airport, Kalamata has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;) with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. Kalamata receives plenty of precipitation during the winter, while summers are hot and generally dry with plenty of sunshine. The highest maximum temperature ever recorded in Kalamata is on 24 June 2007 and the lowest minimum ever recorded is on 14 February 2004. A reading of was reported in the city station which is operated by the National Observatory of Athens on 23 July 2023. 
==Transportation==

Kalamata is accessed by GR-7/E55/E65 in the west, and GR-82 runs through Kalamata and into the Taygetus. The motorway to Kalamata from Tripoli is complete.

Kalamata is served by a metre gauge railway line of the former Piraeus, Athens and Peloponnese Railways, now owned by the Hellenic Railways Organisation (OSE). There is a station and a small freight yard in the city, as well as a rolling stock maintenance depot to the north. There used to be a mainline train service to Kyparissia, Pyrgos and Patras, and a suburban service to Messini and the General Hospital. However, in December 2010, all train services from Kalamata, along with those in the rest of the Peloponnese south of Corinth, were discontinued on economic grounds, and the train station is now closed. A previously disused extension line to the port is now a &quot;Railway Park&quot;, with old steam engines on display, and a café in the old station building.

There is a bus link, operated by the KTEL company, to Tripoli, Corinth, and Athens, with frequent services. Ferries are available to places such as the Greek islands of Kythira and Crete in the summer months. Also in the summer months, charter and scheduled flights fly direct to Kalamata International Airport from some European cities. A scheduled service by Aegean Airlines once a day linking Kalamata and Athens International Airport commenced in 2010.

Kalamata also has four urban bus lines that cross the city and its suburbs.

<text>The New English Translation (NET) is a free, &quot;completely new&quot; English translation of the Bible, &quot;with 60,932 translators&#x27; notes&quot; sponsored by the Biblical Studies Foundation and published by Biblical Studies Press.

== History and textual basis ==
The New English Translation, like the New International Version, New Jerusalem Bible and the New American Bible, is a completely new translation of the Bible, not an update or revision of an older one (such as the New Revised Standard Version of 1989, which is a revision of the Revised Standard Version of 1946/71, itself a revision of the American Standard Version of 1901).

The translation and extensive notes were undertaken by more than twenty biblical scholars who worked directly from the best currently available Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts. The NET Bible was initially conceived at an annual meeting of the Society of Biblical Literature in November 1995 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The translation project originally started as an attempt to provide a digital version of a modern English translation over the Internet and on CD-ROM without cost for the user. Many of those involved in the project&#x27;s initial discussions eventually became part of the translation team. The translation itself claims to be non-sectarian, &quot;inter-denominational&quot; and evangelical.

The translation is most notable for an immense number of lengthy footnotes (which often explain its textual translation decision). Other significant features include its open translation process, its availability on the Internet (both during its beta process and in its final form), and its open copyright permitting free downloads.

An original beta was released in 2001, followed by a second beta in 2003 and the first edition in 2006. A second edition with updated Strong&#x27;s Hebrew and Greek to English mappings was released in 2017.

As of 2019, editions with apocrypha are in development.

== Copyright status ==
The NET Bible&#x27;s approach towards copyright comprises a full copyright license which is explained in its &quot;Ministry First&quot; statement, both of which emphasize its openness and free availability. The publishers claim that &quot;after 10 years, the NET Bible is still the only major modern translation that can be downloaded free in its entirety and used seamlessly in presentations and documents.&quot; However, as of October 2010, the NET Bible&#x27;s copyright statement is over 1500 words long, and contains different conditions for generic copyright, diglots and bible quotations in multiple formats, including commercial and non-commercial publications.

The NET Bible&#x27;s approach to copyright is self-summarised as:

In &quot;Copyright Innovations – Toward a New Model&quot;, the Ministry First position statement makes at least four additional important clarifications:

*We still don&#x27;t fully like the copyright notice for the NET Bible, but in our litigious world it remains a challenge...
*We believe that 1 Tim 5:17-18 (the author has the right to be paid) and Lev 23:22 (allow the poor and foreigner free access) can be simultaneously satisfied far better with a new Internet model...
*We want all authors to know that the NET Bible is a safe choice.
*It is time for ministry to be more free – and for a Bible which puts ministry first...Let us know how we can better serve your needs.

However, these statements do not form part of the copyright notice itself, so their legal value is unclear.

== Functional and formal translation ==
Gordon Fee and Mark L. Strauss see the NET (along with the NIV and the HCSB) as a &quot;mediating version&quot; between functional equivalence and formal equivalence.

In the preface to the first edition, W. Hall Harris III, PhD, &quot;The NET Bible Project Director&quot; claims that the NET Bible solves the problem of dynamic vs. formal equivalence:

The preface of the NET Bible presents the advantage of this feature in the following way: &quot;The translators&#x27; notes make the original languages far more accessible, allowing you to look over the translator&#x27;s shoulder at the very process of translation.&quot;

== Other versions ==
The NET Bible has both English and Chinese versions. The Chinese version is also called Chinese NET Bible.

<text>Gunnar Mikael Höckert (12 February 1910 – 11 February 1940) was a Finnish runner, winner of the 5000 m race at the 1936 Summer Olympics.

==Biography==
Born in Helsinki to a wealthy family, Gunnar Höckert had only one great season, in 1936. The 5000 m final at the Berlin Olympics started in a good pace. The tempo was dictated by American Donald Lash, but he was overtaken by three Finns after 2,000 m. Soon the race turned into a battle between Höckert and defending Olympic Champion and world record holder Lauri Lehtinen. In the last lap Höckert overran Lehtinen to win in a world&#x27;s season best time of 14:22.2. In this same race Swedish Henry Jonsson got third place over Kohei Murakoso, the Japanese runner who was leading the race at the beginning.

Later on that season, on 16 September in Stockholm, Höckert ran a new world record in 3,000 m (8:14.8). A week later, on the same track, Höckert ran a new world record in 2 miles (8:57.4) and another week later, he equalled the Jules Ladoumegue&#x27;s 2,000 m world record of 5:21.8 in Malmö.

The rest of Höckert&#x27;s athletics career was hampered by rheumatism, and he never again achieved the times he had run in 1936. He went to the Winter War as a volunteer, progressing to 2nd lieutenant. He was killed during the Winter War in Johannes on the Karelian Isthmus, just one day before his thirtieth birthday.

<text>Angelica archangelica, commonly known as angelica, garden angelica, wild celery, and Norwegian angelica, is a biennial plant from the family Apiaceae, a subspecies of which is cultivated for its sweetly scented edible stems and roots. Like several other species in Apiaceae, its appearance is similar to several poisonous species (&quot;Conium&quot;, &quot;Heracleum&quot;, and others), and should not be consumed unless it has been identified with absolute certainty. Synonyms include &quot;Archangelica officinalis&quot; and &quot;Angelica officinalis&quot; 

==Description and distribution==
During its first year, it grows only leaves, but during its second year, its fluted stem can reach a height of 2.5 meters (just over 8 feet), and the root is used in flavoring preparations. Its leaves consist of numerous small leaflets divided into three principal groups, each of which is again subdivided into three lesser groups. The edges of the leaflets are finely toothed or serrated. The flowers, which blossom in July, are small and numerous, yellowish or greenish, are grouped into large, globular umbels that bear pale yellow, oblong fruits. &quot;Angelica&quot; grows only in damp soil, preferably near rivers or deposits of water.

&quot;Angelica archangelica&quot; grows wild in Russia, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and Iceland, mostly in the northern parts of the countries. It is cultivated in France, mainly in the Marais Poitevin, a marsh region close to Niort in the department Deux-Sèvres. Commercially available angelica is often sourced from Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Germany and Poland.
==Use and history==
From the 10th century on, angelica was cultivated as a vegetable and medicinal plant, and became popular in Scandinavia in the 12th century and is used especially in Sámi culture. It was once used as an herb in Sámi cooking, and known as &quot;kvanne&quot;.

It is used to flavor liqueurs or aquavits, (&quot;e.g.&quot;, Chartreuse, Bénédictine, Vermouth, and Dubonnet), omelettes and trout, and as jam. The long bright-green stems are also candied and used as food decoration. Angelica is unique among the Umbelliferae for its pervading aromatic odor, a pleasant perfume entirely different from fennel, parsley, anise, caraway, or chervil. It has been compared to musk and to juniper. &quot;Angelica archangelica&quot; roots are among the most common botanicals used in gin distillation, often used in concert with juniper berries and coriander as a chief aromatic characteristic for gin. They are also used in absinthes, aquavits, and bitters. The hollow stems of &quot;Angelica archangelica&quot; may be eaten. The stems are picked clean of their leaves, crystallized in sugar syrup and colored green as cake decoration or as candy.

==Chemical composition==
The essential oil content of angelica root varies based on the age of the roots. Generally, the roots have high levels of terpenes, including α-pinene and β-phellandrene. Studies have found upwards of over eighty different aroma compounds present in samples. Of particular interest to perfumers and aroma chemists is cyclopentadecanolide, which although present in small quantities (&lt; 1% in roots, &lt;.5% in seeds), gives angelica root a distinctive musky aroma. The roots are generally preferred for culinary and aroma uses.

Angelica seeds have a similar chemical composition to the roots, including α-pinene, β-pinene, camphene, myrcene, β-phellandrene, limonene, caryophyllene, borneol, carvone and others.

Both the seeds and roots contain coumarins and furocoumarins. Among these are 2′-angeloyl-3′-isovaleryl vaginate, archangelicin, oxypeucedanin hydrate, bergapten, byakangelicin angelate, imperatorin, isoimperatorin, isopimpinellin, 8-[2-(3-methylbutroxy)-3-hydroxy-3-methylbutoxy]psoralen, osthol, ostruthol, oxypeucedanin, phellopterin, psoralen and xanthotoxin, can be isolated from a chloroform extract of the roots of &quot;A. archangelica&quot; as well as several heraclenol derivatives. The water root extract of &quot;A. archangelica subsp. litoralis&quot; contains adenosine, coniferin, the two dihydrofurocoumarin glycosides apterin and 1′-O-β-d-glycopyranosyl-(S)-marmesin (marmesinin), 1′-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-(2S, 3R)-3-hydroxymarmesin and 2′-β-d-glucopyranosyloxymarmesin.

==Etymology==
&quot;Angelica&quot; is the Latin feminine name implying &quot;angel-like&quot; from the mid-16th century, probably named for the plant due to its scent. &quot;Archangelica&quot; derives from &quot;an angel of the highest order,&quot; an Old French term in the late (12th century), or from the Greek word &quot;arkhangelos&quot; (&quot;chief angel&quot;).

<text>Jacques Saada, (; born 22 November 1947) is a Canadian politician and former cabinet minister.

Saada is a teacher and linguist by profession and was Chief Executive Officer of a translation firm, a consultant and a lecturer in translation prior to entering politics.

He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) from the Quebec riding of Brossard—La Prairie in the 1997 federal election. He served as Deputy Government Whip from 2001 to 2003. When Paul Martin became Prime Minister of Canada on 12 December 2003, he had Saada appointed as a privy councillor(giving him the prenominal &quot;The Honourable&quot; and the postnominal &quot;PC&quot; for life) and to the Cabinet as Minister Responsible for Democratic Reform and Government House Leader.

Following the 2004 election with the election of a Liberal minority government, Saada was transferred to the positions of Minister for the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec and Minister responsible for La Francophonie.

Saada was born in Tunis, the main city of Tunisia, to a Jewish family. In the 2004 election his campaign was the target of anti-Semitic graffiti, letters, and phone calls.

Saada was defeated in the 2006 election, losing his seat in Brossard—La Prairie to Bloc Québécois candidate Marcel Lussier. His former constituency assistant, Alexandra Mendès, defeated Lussier in the 2008 election.

He was the Quebec Chair for the Rae campaign for the leadership of the Liberal Party. In September 2007, Saada was named president and chief executive officer of the Quebec Aerospace Association (AQA). He resigned from that position in December 2011.

Twomey was the original chair of its Governmental Advisory Committee (1998-2003) and CEO (2003–10). A former McKinsey &amp; Company consultant (1989–94) he was a senior executive at the Australian Trade Commission (Austrade 1994–97) and the chief executive of the Australian National Office for the Information Economy (NOIE 1998–2000), and CEO of Argo Pacific, a high-level Internet and cybersecurity advisory firm.

<text>Zurab Khizanishvili (; born 6 October 1981) is a Georgian football coach and former player who is the assistant manager of Georgia U21. A defender, he was the most recent Georgian footballer to play in the Premier League.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Khizanishvili started his career at Dinamo Tbilisi where he remained for just one season, before joining FC Tbilisi to improve his chances of playing regular first team football.

In 1999, he was on the move again, joining his previous two clubs&#x27; city rivals Lokomotiv Tbilisi. Khizanishvili&#x27;s form at Lokomotiv piqued the interest of some of Europe&#x27;s top clubs, though the player&#x27;s latter days at the club were marred by injury. Khizanishvili was eventually released after his contract with Lokomotiv was terminated.

===Scotland===
In March 2001, Khizanishvili joined Dundee, having had unsuccessful trials at Arsenal, Fulham and West Ham United.

He quickly made an impact at Dens Park, alerting fellow Scottish Premier League team Rangers, whom Khizanishvili joined on a Bosman transfer in July 2003 as a replacement for Blackburn Rovers-bound defender Lorenzo Amoruso.

===England===
Despite making 35 appearances in his first campaign at Ibrox, Khizanishvili gradually fell out of favour and, on 31 August 2005, he was allowed to move on loan for the rest of the season to Blackburn in the English FA Premier League. During his loan spell at Blackburn he scored once in the league, in a 2–0 home win over Manchester City, and once in the League Cup in a 3–1 win over Huddersfield Town.

On 10 April 2006, he signed a permanent deal with Blackburn Rovers in a deal rumoured to be worth around about £500,000. He was a key part of Blackburn&#x27;s team in the 2006-07 season, starting more than half the matches as the club competed domestically and in the UEFA Cup. Khizanishvili struggled to hold down a regular starting position in the rest of Mark Hughes&#x27; reign as manager.

Under Paul Ince and Sam Allardyce he also failed to break into the first team on a consistent basis. His first appearance of the 2009–10 campaign came on 25 August, when he started the League Cup 2nd Round tie against Gillingham at Priestfield Stadium, playing the full 90 minutes alongside Gael Givet in a 3–1 win. On 17 September 2009 Khizanishvili joined Championship team Newcastle United on loan in a three-month deal and returned on 19 December. On 25 January 2010, he signed for Reading on loan for the remainder of the 2009–10 season. 

On 31 August 2010, he rejoined Reading on a season long loan for the 2010–11 season and was handed the number 15 shirt at the Madejski Stadium. On 13 March 2011, Khizanishvili completed the full 90 minutes against Manchester City at Eastlands in a 1–0 FA Cup quarter-final loss. On 30 May 2011, he started the Championship play-off final against Swansea City. Khizanishvili was booked after 12 minutes and then conceded a penalty kick after 20 minutes, due to a clumsy challenge on winger Nathan Dyer and Reading went on to lose 4–2. Khizanishvili ended his second loan spell with Reading having made 29 appearances in all competitions, including 24 league outings.

===Turkey===
After his release from Blackburn, Khizanishvili joined Kayserispor, where he played for three seasons.

===Azerbaijan===
In June 2015, Khizanishvili signed a six-month contract with Azerbaijan Premier League side Inter Baku PIK.

==International career==
Khizanishvili played 93 matches for Georgia national team. He scored his only goal against Moldova on 6 June 2009.

==Coaching career==
After he retired from football in the summer 2017, Khizanishvili was appointed as the assistant manager of Gia Geguchadze at the Georgian U-21 national team.

==Personal life==
Khizanishvili is married to the Georgian model Salome Ghviniashvili and they have three children. He is the son of former USSR international defender Nodar Khizanishvili.

<text>Jean Remington Yawkey (January 24, 1909 – February 26, 1992) was the wife of Tom Yawkey and owner of the Boston Red Sox from 1976 to her death in 1992.

==Biography==
Jean Yawkey was born Jean Hollander in Brooklyn, New York. She grew up in Freeport, Long Island, and was a New York City fashion model for ten years. In December 1944, she married Tom Yawkey in Georgetown, South Carolina; both had previous marriages that ended in divorce. During World War II, she was active with the Red Cross.

Tom Yawkey had bought the Boston Red Sox in 1933. Following his death in 1976, Jean Yawkey was chairwoman of the board of directors of the JRY Corporation, the majority owner and general partner of the Red Sox, until her death.

In 1983, Jean Yawkey became a director of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, holding the distinction of being the first woman elected to the board.

In 1992, Jean Yawkey died in Boston at age 83. In total, the Yawkeys owned (solely, or with partners) and operated the team for 59 years. Jean Yawkey was inducted to the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 1995.

===Philanthropy===

Jean Yawkey had a long association with the Jimmy Fund/Dana–Farber Cancer Institute as a trustee and for a period as chair. She was a supporter of the Tara Hall Home for Boys in South Carolina. She was instrumental in the establishment of the Yawkey Family Inn in Brookline, Massachusetts, a temporary home for families of patients undergoing transplant surgery in Boston-area hospitals. She was also a trustee of the Yawkey Foundation.
====Yawkey Foundation====
The Yawkey Foundation has given over $575 million in grants to organizations in the areas of health care, education, athletics, the arts, and wildlife conservation. The foundation established scholarship funds at Yale University, Boston College, and Boston College High School. She was a supporter of the Jackie Robinson Scholarship Program and supported several other educational institutions to provide minority students and others with scholarship aid.

In 2002, the Yawkey Foundation provided a $25 million grant for the construction of an outpatient center at Massachusetts General Hospital, where she had been a patient, and where she died in 1992. In 2003, the Yawkey Foundation awarded $5 million to Emmanuel College in Boston for construction of the Jean Yawkey Center, a student center, dining hall, gym and fitness center.

===Boston Red Sox===
The team&#x27;s most successful season during Jean Yawkey&#x27;s ownership came in 1986, when the Red Sox reached the World Series, losing in seven games to the New York Mets.

<text>Richard Schirrmann (15 May 1874 – 14 December 1961) was a German teacher and founder of the first hostel.

==Early life and education==
Schirrmann was born in Grunenfeld, Province of Prussia (now Gronówko, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship). His father, August Schirrmann was a teacher.

==Career==
Richard Schirrmann became a teacher in 1895 after passing his teacher&#x27;s examination in Karalene, near Insterburg, and was used as a teacher in the Kirchschule Königshöhe in Lötzen, then in Schrombehnen in Pr. Eylau. He took every opportunity to hold outdoors lessons. In 1903, he was transferred to Nette-Schule in Altena, Province of Westphalia where he met Wilhelm Münker, who later became his partner.

In August 1909, after a stormy school camping trip, Schirrmann proposed the idea of affordable youth travel gaining significant support and opened a makeshift hostel for hikers in his school.

On 1 June 1912, in Altena Castle, he opened the first official hostel now used as museum.

===World War I===
During the World War I, Schirrmann served in a regiment holding a position on the Bernhardstein, one of the Vosges Mountains – separated from the French troops by a narrow No man&#x27;s land, which he described as &quot;strewn with shattered trees, the ground ploughed up by shellfire, a wilderness of earth, tree-roots and tattered uniforms&quot;.

Schirrmann described a Western Front Christmas Truce in December 1915:

&quot;When the Christmas bells sounded in the villages of the Vosges behind the lines... something fantastically unmilitary occurred. German and French troops spontaneously made peace and ceased hostilities; they visited each other through disused trench tunnels, and exchanged wine, cognac, and cigarettes for Westphalian black bread, biscuits, and ham. This suited them so well that they remained good friends even after Christmas was over.&quot;
Military discipline was soon restored, but Schirrmann pondered over the incident wondering whether &quot;thoughtful young people of all countries could be provided with suitable meeting places where they could get to know each other&quot;. The war made him an even stronger proponent of hostels believing that hostels would be &quot;bridges of peace&quot; to foster international understanding.

===Post War===
In 1919, he founded German Youth Hostel Association. In 1922, he retired from teaching to focus entirely on hostels.

In 1925, he founded the children&#x27;s village &quot;Staumühle&quot; on a former military training ground near Paderborn. Until 1931, every year during the summer months, he organized a school camp.

From 1933 to 1936, he served as President of the International Youth Hostelling Association (now Hostelling International), until the Government of Nazi Germany forced him to resign while the hostels were put under control of the Hitler Youth. After World War II, he played a key role in rebuilding the German association, and was recognized the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (Bundesverdienstkreuz) in 1952.

In 1946, he was flown to the International Youth Hostel Conference in Scotland by an American friend on a private plane, making him the first German civilian to enter British territory after World War II.

Beginning in 1937, he lived in Grävenwiesbach, Taunus where he died in 1961.

==Personal life==
Schirrmann married Gertrud in 1903. They had one daughter but Gertrud did not support Richard&#x27;s plan and they divorced in 1929. He then married Elisabeth, who shared his passions. By 1942, she gave birth to 6 children.

<text>Battlefield is a military first-person shooter video game franchise primarily developed by Swedish company EA DICE and published by American company Electronic Arts. The series mainly focuses on online multiplayer, with gameplay taking place across large maps, and emphasizes teamwork and combined arms warfare. 

The first installment of the franchise, &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot;, was released for Microsoft Windows and OS X computers in 2002. Since then, the series&#x27; installments have sold 88.7 million copies worldwide as of November 2022.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Battlefield&quot; series games usually focus on large-scale, online multiplayer battles. Playing in squads has become a major element of games in the series. Apart from infantry, tanks, airplanes, and other vehicles may participate in these battles.

Since &quot;Battlefield 2&quot;, the series centrally recorded online stats for each player, allowing users to receive rank promotions and weapon unlocks based on their performance as well as awards such as medals, ribbons, and pins.

A class system is present within all the &quot;Battlefield&quot; games. Each class features a different type of primary weapon along with different equipment, differentiating roles on the battlefield.

2008&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, in addition to expanding to the series to consoles, introduced full single-player campaigns with more fleshed-out storylines. It was also the first game to use the studio-developed game engine, Frostbite, which introduced almost fully destructible environments; a feature that has since become one of the most well-known staples of the series.

The ability to engage other players in melee combat with a knife has been present in &quot;Battlefield&quot; games, but since &quot;Battlefield 2142&quot;, the series has included an award of dog tags for each player killed using a knife.

==Games==

==Development history==
&quot;Battlefield 1942&quot; was released on September 10, 2002, using the Refractor game engine, and set in World War II. It introduced the &quot;Conquest&quot; gameplay mode, in which players fought for &quot;control points&quot; throughout the map. Two expansion packs were released.

&quot;Battlefield Vietnam&quot;, released in 2004, moved the setting to the Vietnam War, and was built on an updated Refractor engine with various gameplay improvements, such as the ability to fire personal weapons while seated in vehicles, and visualizing dense foliage.

The 2005 release &quot;Battlefield 2&quot; takes place in the modern day, depicting a war between the United States and China and the fictional Middle Eastern Coalition (MEC). Despite requiring numerous patches due to a large number of bugs and glitches in the game upon its release, it was a large commercial success, selling more than 2,250,000 copies worldwide, by July 2006. One expansion pack, &quot;Special Forces&quot;, which added Russia, exclusive missions, and new weapons and gadgets, and two booster packs, &quot;Armored Fury&quot; (adding three new battles in the USA) and &quot;Euro Force&quot; (adding the European Union), were also released. A similar game called &quot;Battlefield 2: Modern Combat&quot; was released for consoles, with a larger single player mode but limited online play.

&quot;Battlefield 2142&quot; was released in 2006, taking place during a global ice age in the 22nd century. While most of it is graphically similar to &quot;Battlefield 2&quot;, it introduced a variety of equipment to unlock and battles between two giant &quot;Titan&quot; airships. The &quot;Northern Strike&quot; expansion pack was later released, adding new maps, vehicles, and a new game mode. Its use of in-game advertising was controversial among players and not well received.

&quot;&quot;, released in 2008, is set in a near-future war between the United States and Russia, and follows a US Army company&#x27;s escapades and their search for hidden gold. This new &quot;Battlefield&quot; game had a variety of vehicles for land, air and sea. It had a new destruction system that allowed the player to break and destroy environments, based on a new game engine named Frostbite, which replaced the Refractor engine used in earlier releases (with the exception of &quot;Battlefield 2: Modern Combat&quot;, which used RenderWare).

In 2009, EA released two download-only games, &quot;Battlefield Heroes&quot;, a free-to-play Refractor 2 engine game, supported by advertising and micropayments and &quot;Battlefield 1943&quot;, a Frostbite engine game, released in July 2009, for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and was scheduled for release in Q1 2010, for PCs, but was cancelled.

In 2010, a sequel to &quot;Battlefield: Bad Company&quot;, &quot;&quot;, was released, involving &quot;B&quot; Company&#x27;s search for an electromagnetic pulse weapon. It features a larger multiplayer than its predecessor &quot;Bad Company&quot;, with updated graphics and realistic effects (e.g. bullet-drop). The game introduced the rush game mode and brought in weapons. It features a &quot;VIP&quot; system of content distribution where player with VIP codes gain early access to new maps. DICE also released an expansion for &quot;Bad Company 2&quot;, &quot;&quot;, setting the game in the Vietnam War.

&quot;Battlefield 3&quot; was announced in 2009, and in 2010 it was confirmed that gamers who pre-ordered &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; Limited Edition would receive &quot;Battlefield 3&quot; forty-eight hours before the open beta was released. On February 4, 2011, the first teaser trailer for the game was revealed, with a preliminary release in the Fall of 2011. Among the features that remain in the game are Jets and the ability to go prone. The game allows 64 (on the PC) players as in all previous &quot;Battlefield&quot; titles, though the consoles allow for 24-player matches. The &quot;Battlefield 3&quot; Beta was released on September 29, 2011. &quot;Battlefield 3&quot; was released on October 25, 2011 and has received high review scores and has received awards from IGN.

On November 5, 2010, EASY Studios announced a follow-up to its free-to-play &quot;Battlefield Heroes&quot;, &quot;Battlefield Play4Free&quot;. EASY develops the free-to-play variants of &quot;Battlefield&quot;. Its latest offering gives players the same free-to-play pricing structure of &quot;Heroes&quot;, while still offering a more serious, core &quot;Battlefield&quot; experience (as opposed to &quot;Heroes&quot;″ lighthearted, cartoon-styled environment). &quot;Battlefield Play4Free&quot; went into open beta on April 4, 2011.
&quot;Battlefield 4&quot; was announced on March 26, 2013. On July 17, 2012, it was announced that players who pre-order &quot;Medal of Honor: Warfighter&quot; would receive access to a &quot;Battlefield 4&quot; beta. The beta for the game began on October 1 and ended on October 15 with a full release on October 29, 2013.

Information about the next entry in the series, &quot;Battlefield Hardline&quot;, was leaked on May 27, 2014, and officially unveiled on June 9, 2014, during E3. The game was developed by Visceral Games and, unlike previous installments in the franchise, is centered around a cops-and-robbers theme.
&quot;Battlefield: Bad Company 3&quot; was an upcoming entry into the series, a follow-up to 2010&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. General Manager of DICE, Karl-Magnus Troedsson stated in a 2014 interview with &quot;Eurogamer&quot; that the game is not in active development as the studio doesn&#x27;t know what exactly fans loved about the series as there has never been a clear line of the matter and they do not want to risk destroying the series. Despite this, DICE has made it clear that they will be developing &quot;Bad Company 3&quot; at some point.

In July 2015, CFO of EA Blake Jorgensen announced a new &quot;Battlefield&quot; title would be released in 2016. This was followed up by Dan Vaderlind, EA DICE Development Director, announcing that since &quot;Star Wars Battlefront&quot; has been released, he will now be focused on the upcoming &quot;Battlefield&quot; title. On May 6, 2016, &quot;Battlefield 1&quot; was officially announced, with an official reveal trailer on YouTube, and was released on October 21, 2016.

In a May 2018 live reveal event it was confirmed that it the next installment would be a World War II game after several leaks suggested it would be set during this period, with the title revealed as &quot;Battlefield V&quot;. Battlefield V was released later that year on November 20, 2018 while also offering certain players early access to the game as early as November 9, 2018.

&quot;Battlefield 2042&quot; was released on November 19, 2021. During EA&#x27;s 2020/2021 Q3 earnings call it was revealed that the game will be the first to release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, utilizing their processing power to feature more players than ever in the online portion of the game. Additionally, it saw multiple innovations in multiplayer, social, and competition aspects that are new to the franchise. After &quot;2042&quot; was met with a poor launch, it was announced that Oskar Gabrielson, the general manager of DICE, would be stepping down from his position, and Rebecka Coutaz, former Managing Director of Ubisoft Annecy, would replace him. Vince Zampella of Respawn Entertainment and Ripple Effect Studios (the latter of which had created &quot;2042&quot;″s Portal Mode) will be heading the &quot;Battlefield&quot; franchise. It was also reported that EA game director Marcus Lehto is building a new Seattle-based studio focused on story content for &quot;Battlefield&quot;, while Ripple Effect is developing a new &quot;&quot;Battlefield&quot; experience&quot; set in the game&#x27;s universe.

&quot;Battlefield Mobile&quot; was a cancelled free-to-play game for the Android, with an iOS release initially planned before the game&#x27;s cancellation on January 31, 2023. An open beta was released in November 2022. The game was cancelled on January 31, 2023. The developer of the game, Industrial Toys, was also shut down.

==TV series==
In October 2012, Fox Broadcasting Company announced their intentions to make a one-hour-long television show based on &quot;Battlefield: Bad Company&quot;. The show was to be written by executive producer John Eisendrath and co-produced by Patrick Bach and Patrick O&#x27;Brien of Electronic Arts, and Doug Robinson of Happy Madison. Nothing has been developed after their announcement.

In July 2016, Paramount Television announced that it will adapt the game series for television. Anonymous Content&#x27;s Michael Sugar and Ashley Zalta will executive produce.

<doc id="840346" wikidata="Q1261544" url="?curid=840346" title="Palazzo del Te">
<text>&#x27;, or simply &#x27;, is a palace in the suburbs of Mantua, Italy. It is an example of the mannerist style of architecture, and the acknowledged masterpiece of Giulio Romano.

== Name ==
The palace is mostly referred to by English-speaking writers, especially art historians, as . In Italian, the name is now commonly shortened to .

It was originally named after , the suburb where it was built. The toponym is most likely derived from Lombard or , referring to a &quot;linden grove&quot; that once grew in the area, or alternatively from Latin &quot;hut&quot;. Art historian Giorgio Vasari spelled the name , based on the now archaic Italian-language name of the letter T.

== History ==
 was constructed 1524–34 for Federico II Gonzaga, Marquess of Mantua, as a palace of leisure. The site chosen was that of the family stables which he had built at , on the edge of the marshes just outside Mantua&#x27;s city walls, as early as in 1502.

Giulio Romano, a pupil of Raphael, was commissioned to design the building. The shell of the palazzo, erected within eighteen months, is basically a square house containing a cloistered courtyard. A formal garden complemented the house, enclosed by colonnaded outbuildings ending in a semicircular colonnade known as the Exedra or .

Once the shell of the building was completed, for ten years a team of plasterers, carvers, and fresco painters laboured until barely a surface in any of the loggias or salons remained undecorated. Under Romano&#x27;s direction, local decorative painters such as Benedetto Pagni and Rinaldo Mantovano worked extensively on the frescos.

In July 1630, during the War of the Mantuan Succession (1628–31), Mantua and the palace were sacked over three days by an Imperial army of 36,000 Landsknecht mercenaries. The remaining populace fell victim to one of the worst plagues in history that the invaders had brought with them. The Palazzo was looted from top to bottom and remained an empty shell with nymphs, gods, goddesses, and giants adorning the walls of the empty, echoing rooms.

== Description ==

Like the Villa Farnesina in Rome, the suburban location allowed for a mixing of both palace and villa architecture. The four exterior façades have flat pilasters against rusticated walls, the fenestration indicating that the is the ground floor, with a secondary floor above. The East façade differs from the other three by having Palladian motifs on its pilaster and an open loggia at its centre rather than an arch to the courtyard. The facades are not so symmetrical as they appear and the spans between the columns are irregular. The centers of the North and South facades are pierced by two-storey arches without portico or pediment, simply a covered way leading to the interior courtyard.

Few windows overlook the inner courtyard (&quot;&quot;); the colonnaded walls are decorated on all sides by deep niches and blind windows, and the intervening surfaces are spattered by (broken and blemished plaster) giving life and depth to the surfaces.

The frescoes are the most remarkable feature of the Palazzo. The subjects range from Olympian banquets in the (&quot;Hall of Psyche&quot;) and stylised horses in the (&quot;Hall of the Horses&quot;) to the most unusual of all — giants and grotesques wreaking havoc, fury, and ruin around the walls of the (&quot;Hall of the Giants&quot;).
These magnificent rooms, once furnished to complement the ducal court of the Gonzaga family, saw many of the most illustrious figures of their era entertained, such as the Emperor Charles V, who, when visiting in 1530, elevated his host Federico II of Gonzaga from Marquess to Duke of Mantua.

One of the most evocative parts of the lost era of the palazzo is the (&quot;Lodge of the Grotto&quot;), a small suite of intimate rooms arranged around a grotto and (covered balcony) where courtiers once bathed in the small cascade that splashed over the pebbles and shells encrusted in the floor and walls.

Part of the Palazzo today houses the (Civic Museum of Palazzo del Te), endowed by the publisher Arnoldo Mondadori. It contains a collection of Mesopotamian art.

<doc id="840350" wikidata="Q1741629" url="?curid=840350" title="Kimbell Art Museum">
<text>The Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas, hosts an art collection as well as traveling art exhibitions, educational programs and an extensive research library. Its initial artwork came from the private collection of Kay and Velma Kimbell, who also provided funds for a new building to house it.

The building was designed by architect Louis I. Kahn and is widely recognized as one of the most significant works of architecture of recent times. It is especially noted for the wash of silvery natural light across its vaulted gallery ceilings.

==History==
Kay Kimbell was a wealthy Fort Worth businessman who built an empire of over 70 companies in a variety of industries. He married Velma Fuller, who kindled his interest in art collecting by taking him to an art show in Fort Worth in 1931, where he bought a British painting. They set up the Kimbell Art Foundation in 1935 to establish an art institute, and by the time of his death in 1964, the couple had amassed what was considered to be the best selection of old masters in the Southwest. Kay left much of his estate to the Kimbell Art Foundation, and Velma bequeathed her share of the estate to the foundation as well, with the key directive to &quot;build a museum of the first class.&quot;

The foundation&#x27;s board of trustees hired Richard Fargo Brown, then director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, as the founding director of the museum with the task of constructing a building to house the Kimbell&#x27;s art collection. Upon accepting the post, Brown declared that the new building should itself be a work of art, &quot;as much a gem as one of the Rembrandts or Van Dycks housed within it.&quot; The proposed museum was given space in a 9.5 acre (3.8 hectare) site in Fort Worth&#x27;s Cultural District, which was already home to three other museums, including the Fort Worth Art Museum-Center (now the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth) and the Amon Carter Museum, specializing in art of the American West.

Brown discussed the goals of the institution and its new building with the trustees and summarized them in a four-page &quot;Policy Statement&quot; and a nineteen-page &quot;Pre-Architectural Program&quot; in June 1966. After interviewing a number of prominent architects, the museum hired Louis I. Kahn in October 1966. Kahn&#x27;s previous works included such acclaimed structures as the Salk Institute in California, and he had recently been honored by being chosen to design the National Assembly Building for what would become the capital of the new nation of Bangladesh. Construction for the Kimbell Art Museum began in the summer of 1969. The new building opened in October 1972 and quickly achieved an international reputation for architectural excellence.

Brown also expanded the Kimbell collection by acquiring several works of significant quality by artists like Duccio, El Greco, Rubens, and Rembrandt.

After Richard Fargo Brown&#x27;s death in 1979, Edmund &quot;Ted&quot; Pillsbury was appointed director of the museum. Previously he had been the director of the newly opened Yale Center for British Art, which, coincidentally, was also designed by Louis Kahn. He had also been a curator at the Yale Art Gallery, Kahn&#x27;s first art museum. Pillsbury continued the art acquisition program in an aggressive but disciplined fashion. Richard Brettell, director of the Dallas Museum of Art, said, &quot;He was, in some ways, single-handedly responsible for turning the Kimbell from an institution with a great building into one whose collection matched its architecture in quality&quot;.

In 1989, Pillsbury announced plans to expand the museum&#x27;s building to accommodate its enlarged collection, but the plan was dropped because of strong opposition to any major alteration of the original Louis Kahn structure. In 2007, the Kimbell solved that problem by announcing plans to construct an additional, separate building across the street from the original building. While this did not alter the Kahn structure, it did significantly alter Kahn&#x27;s work. Kahn had designed the building to be approach from the lawn, and the new structire significantly altered that plan. Designed by Renzo Piano, and relocated to the west lawn, the new structure opened to the public in November 2013.

The museum is part of the Monuments Men and Women Museum Network, launched in 2021 by the Monuments Men Foundation for the Preservation of Art.

==The collection==


In 1966, before the museum even had a building, founding director Brown included this directive in his Policy Statement: &quot;The goal shall be definitive excellence, not size of collection.&quot; Accordingly, the museum&#x27;s collection today consists of only about 350 works of art, but they are of notably high quality.
The European collection is the most extensive in the museum and includes Michelangelo&#x27;s first known painting, &quot;The Torment of Saint Anthony&quot;, the only painting by Michelangelo on exhibit in the Americas. It also includes works by Duccio, Fra Angelico, Mantegna, El Greco, Carracci, Caravaggio, Rubens, Guercino, La Tour, Poussin, Velázquez, Rembrandt, Boucher, Gainsborough, Vigée-Lebrun, Friedrich (the first painting by the artist acquired by a public collection outside of Europe), Cézanne, Monet, Caillebotte, Matisse, Bonnard, Mondrian, Braque, Miró and Picasso. Works from the classical period include antiquities from Ancient Egypt, Assyria, Greece and Rome. The Asian collection comprises sculptures, paintings, bronzes, ceramics, and works of decorative art from China, Korea, Japan, India, Nepal, Tibet, Cambodia, and Thailand. Precolumbian art is represented by Maya works in ceramic, stone, shell, and jade, Olmec, Zapotec, and Aztec sculpture, as well as pieces from the Conte and Huari cultures. The African collection consists primarily of bronze, wood, and terracotta sculpture from West and Central Africa, including examples from Nigeria, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Oceanic art is represented by a Maori figure.

The museum owns only a few pieces created after the mid-20th century (believing that era to be the province of its neighbor, the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth) and no American art (believing that to be the province of its other neighbor, the Amon Carter Museum).

The museum also houses a substantial library with over 59,000 books, periodicals and auction catalogs that are available as a resource to art historians and to faculty and graduate students from surrounding universities.

==The building==

===Preparation===

Brown&#x27;s &quot;Policy Statement&quot; set a clear architectural direction by calling for the new building to be &quot;a work of art&quot;, It was augmented by his &quot;Pre-Architectural Program&quot;, which specified that &quot;natural light should play a vital part&quot; in the design and that &quot;the form of the building should be so complete in its beauty that additions would spoil that form.&quot; Brown called for a building of modest scale that would not overwhelm either the artwork or the viewer.

After an extensive search that included interviews with such noted architects as Marcel Breuer, Mies van der Rohe, Pier Luigi Nervi, Gordon Bunshaft and Edward Larrabee Barnes, the commission was awarded to Louis Kahn in October 1966. From Kahn&#x27;s point of view, Brown was an ideal client. Brown had been an admirer of Kahn&#x27;s work for some time, and the approach he specified for the building was very much in line with Kahn&#x27;s, particularly its emphasis on natural light.

Because Kahn had a reputation for significant time and cost overruns, a local engineering and architectural firm owned by Preston M. Geren was made associate architect, a practice followed in Fort Worth for out-of-state architects. Frank Sherwood served as their project coordinator. The Geren organization had a solid reputation for bringing in projects on time and within budget, but by their own admission they were not especially innovative. The contract called for control over construction to be turned over to Geren when Kahn had finished the design, a provision that eventually led to conflict because Kahn felt that a design was never finished until the building was constructed. Kahn once said, &quot;the building gives you answers as it grows and becomes itself.&quot; The museum trustees settled the issue by deciding that Geren would report directly to them instead of to Kahn, but that Kahn would have final say over the design, except that any changes would have to be approved by Brown.

The new museum was to be built on a gentle slope below the Amon Carter Museum, whose entrance and terrace faced the Fort Worth skyline. Kahn was asked to build the Kimbell museum no more than 40 feet (12 m) high so it would not interfere with the view from the Carter Museum. Kahn initially proposed a low but very spacious building 450 feet (137 m) square, but Brown rejected that proposal and insisted that Kahn design a much smaller structure, a decision that would have repercussions several years later when a proposal to expand the building created a storm of controversy.

===Architecture===
The museum is composed of 16 parallel vaults that are each 100 feet (30.6 m) long, 20 feet (6 m) high and 20 feet (6 m) wide (internal measurements). Intervening low channels separate the vaults. The vaults are grouped into three wings. The north and south wings each have six vaults, with the western one open as a portico. The central space has four vaults, with the western one open as an entry porch facing a courtyard partially enclosed by the two outside wings.

With one exception, the art galleries are located on the upper floor of the museum to allow access to natural light. Service and curatorial spaces as well as an additional gallery occupy the ground floor. Each interior vault has a slot along its apex to allow natural light into the galleries. Air ducts and other mechanical services are located in the flat channels between the vaults.

Kahn used several techniques to give the galleries an inviting atmosphere. The ends of the vaults, which are made of concrete block, are faced with travertine inside and out. The steel handrails were &quot;blasted&quot; with ground pecan shells to create a matte surface texture. The museum has three glass-walled courtyards that bring natural light to the gallery spaces. One of them penetrates the gallery floor to bring natural light to the conservation studio on the ground floor.

The landscape has been described as &quot;Kahn&#x27;s most elegant built example of landscape planning&quot; by Philadelphia landscape architect George Patton. Approaching the main entrance past a lawn edged by pools with running water, the visitor enters a courtyard through a grove of Yaupon Holly trees. The sound of footsteps on the gravel walkway echoes from the walls on either side of the courtyard and is magnified under the curved ceiling of the entry porch. After that subtle preparation, the visitor enters the hushed museum with silvery light spread across its ceiling. Harriet Pattison played the lead role in the landscape design and is also the person who suggested that open porches flanking the entrance would create a good transition from the lawn and courtyard to the galleries inside. Pattison, who had also worked with Kahn on other projects, was an employee of Patton. She is the mother of film director Nathaniel Kahn, Louis Kahn&#x27;s son who made the film &quot;My Architect&quot; about his father.

====Vaults====

Kahn&#x27;s first design for the galleries called for angular vaults of folded concrete plates with light slots at the top. Brown liked the light slots but rejected this particular design because it had the ceilings 30 feet (9 m) high, too high for the museum he envisioned. Further research by Marshall Meyers, Kahn&#x27;s project architect for the Kimbell museum, revealed that using a cycloid curve for the gallery vaults would reduce the ceiling height and provide other benefits as well. The relatively flat cycloid curve would produce elegant galleries that were wide in proportion to their height, allowing the ceiling to be lowered to 20 feet (6 m). More importantly, that curve could also be used to produce a beautiful distribution of natural light from a slot in the top of the gallery across the entire gallery ceiling.

Kahn was pleased with this development because it allowed him to design the museum with galleries that resembled the ancient Roman vaults he had always admired. The thin, curved shells needed for the roof were challenging to build, however, so Kahn called in a leading authority on concrete construction, August Komendant, with whom he had worked before (and who, like Kahn, was born in Estonia). Kahn generally referred to the museum&#x27;s roof form as a vault, but Komendant explained that it was actually a shell playing the role of a beam. More precisely, as professor Steven Fleming points out, the shells that form the gallery roofs are &quot;post-tensioned curved concrete beams, spanning an incredible 100 feet&quot; (30.5 m), which &quot;happened to have been the maximum distance that concrete walls or vaults could be produced without requiring expansion control joints.&quot; Both terms, vault and shell, are used in professional literature describing the museum.

True vaults, such as the Roman vaults that Kahn admired, will collapse if not supported along the entire lengths of each side. Not fully understanding the capabilities of modern concrete shells, Kahn initially planned to include many more support columns than were necessary for the gallery roofs. Komendant was able to use post-tensioned concrete that was only five inches thick to create gallery &quot;vaults&quot; that need support columns only at their four corners.

The Geren firm, which had been asked to look for ways to keep costs low, objected that the cycloid vaults would be too expensive and urged a flat roof instead. Kahn, however, insisted on a vaulted roof, which would enable him to create galleries with a comforting, room-like atmosphere yet with minimal need for columns or other internal structures that would reduce the museum&#x27;s flexibility. Eventually a deal was struck whereby Geren would be responsible for the foundation and basement while Komendant would be responsible for the upper floors and cycloid shells. Kahn placed one of these shells at the front of each of the three wings as a porch or portico to illustrate how the building was constructed. The effect was, in his words, &quot;like a piece of sculpture outside the building.&quot;

Thos. S. Byrne, Ltd. was the contractor for the project, with A. T. Seymour as project manager. Virgil Earp and L. G. Shaw, Byrne&#x27;s project superintendents, designed forms with a cycloid shape that were made from hinged plywood and lined with an oily coating so they could be reused to pour concrete for multiple sections of the vaults, helping to ensure consistency. The long, straight channels at the bottoms of the shells were cast first so they could be used as platforms to support the workmen pouring concrete for the cycloid curves. After all the concrete had been poured and strengthened with internal post-tensioning cables, however, the curved parts of the shells carried the weight of their lower straight edges instead of the other way around.

To prevent the shells from collapsing at the long light slots at their apexes, concrete struts were inserted at 10-foot (3 m) intervals. A relatively thick concrete arch was added to each end of the shells to stiffen them further. To make it clear that the curved shells are supported only at their four corners and not by the walls at the ends of the vaults, thin arcs of transparent material were inserted between the curve of the shells and the end walls. Because the stiffening arches of the shells are thicker at the top, the transparent strips are tapered, thinner at the top than at the bottom. In addition, a linear transparent strip was placed between the straight bottoms of the shells and the long exterior walls to show that the shells aren&#x27;t supported by those walls either. In addition to revealing the building&#x27;s structure, these features bring additional natural light into the galleries in a way that is safe for the paintings.

The vault roofs, which are visible to approaching visitors, were covered with lead sheathing inspired by the lead covering of the complexly curved roofs of the Doge&#x27;s Palace and St. Mark&#x27;s Basilica in Venice, Italy.

====Skylights====
David Brownlee and David DeLong, authors of &quot;Louis I. Kahn: In The Realm of Architecture&quot;, declare that &quot;in Fort Worth, Kahn created a skylight system without peer in the history of architecture.&quot; Robert McCarter, author of &quot;Louis I. Kahn&quot;, says the entry gallery is &quot;one of the most beautiful spaces ever built&quot;, with its &quot;astonishing, ethereal, silver-colored light.&quot; Carter Wiseman, author of &quot;Louis I. Kahn: Beyond Time and Style&quot;, said that &quot;the light in the Kimbell gallery assumed an almost ethereal quality, and has been the distinguishing factor in its fame ever since.&quot;

Creating a natural lighting system that has evoked such acclaim was challenging, and Kahn&#x27;s office and the lighting designer Richard Kelly investigated over 100 approaches in their search for the proper skylight system. The goal was to illuminate the galleries with indirect natural light while excluding all direct sunlight, which would damage the artwork. Richard Kelly, lighting consultant, determined that a reflecting screen made of perforated anodized aluminum with a specific curve could be used to distribute natural light evenly across the cycloid curve of the ceiling. He hired a computer expert to determine the exact shape of the reflector&#x27;s curve, making it one of the first architectural elements to be designed with computer technology.

In areas without art, such as the lobby, cafeteria and library, the entire reflector is perforated, making it possible for people standing beneath to glimpse passing clouds. In the gallery spaces, the central part of the reflector, which is directly beneath the sun, is solid, while the remainder is perforated. The concrete surfaces of the ceiling were given a high finish to further assist the reflection of the light. The result is that the strong Texas sun enters a narrow slot at the top of each vault and is evenly reflected from a curved screen across the entire arc of the polished concrete ceiling, ensuring a beautiful distribution of natural light that had never before been achieved.

===Expansion===
In 1989, director Ted Pillsbury, Brown&#x27;s successor, announced plans to add two wings to the north and south ends of the building and chose architect Romaldo Giurgola to design them. A firestorm of protest erupted. Critics pointed out that founding director Brown&#x27;s &quot;Pre-Architectural Program&quot; had specified that &quot;the form of the building should be so complete in its beauty that additions would spoil that form,&quot; and that Kahn had achieved that goal extraordinarily well.

A group of prominent architects signed a letter acknowledging the need for additional space but arguing that the proposed addition would compromise the proportions of the original. They noted that when Kahn himself was questioned about the possibility of a future expansion, he said that it should &quot;occur as a new building and be situated away from the present structure across the lawn&quot;. Esther Kahn, Louis Kahn&#x27;s widow, published a letter voicing similar sentiments, noting that &quot;there is room on the site for a separate building, which could be connected to the present museum.&quot; The project was cancelled a few months later.

==== Renzo Piano Pavilion ====
In 2006, the idea of an expansion surfaced once again at a dinner in Fort Worth attended by Timothy Potts, the museum&#x27;s director at the time (Eric M. Lee has been the director since March 2009); Kay Fortson, president of the Kimbell Art Foundation and a key figure in the creation of the original building; Ben Fortson, a trustee; and Sue Ann Kahn, Louis Kahn&#x27;s daughter and a vocal opponent of the original plan for expansion. The new proposal was exactly in line with Louis Kahn&#x27;s own thoughts for expansion: a separate building. At that time, the new structure was to be sited on land to the back of the Kahn building.

In April 2007, the museum announced that Renzo Piano had been chosen to design the new building. Piano was an obvious choice because he had worked in Louis Kahn&#x27;s office as a young man and had later established a reputation as one of the world&#x27;s leading museum architects. Piano had been particularly active in Texas, designing the Menil Collection in Houston, a commission in Louis Kahn&#x27;s studio at the time of Kahn&#x27;s death, and the Nasher Sculpture Center in Dallas. He also designed the expansion for the Art Institute of Chicago and was co-designer of the Pompidou Centre in Paris.

The schematic designs for the new Kimbell building were made public in November 2008, and the plans were released in May 2010. The 85,000 square foot (7,900 m2) structure would complement the original building but not mimic it. Unlike the original, its lines would be rectilinear, not curvilinear. Like the original, however, it would have three bays with the middle bay stepped back from the other two. The new building expansion, named the Renzo Piano Pavilion, was officially inaugurated to the public on November 27, 2013.

The new building should also resolve a parking issue at the museum. Kahn was deeply troubled by the negative impact of the automobile on city life; he once spoke of &quot;the destruction of the city by the motor car.&quot; Fundamentally opposed to the idea of orienting buildings to the automobile, Kahn placed the main parking lot in the back of the building, intending for visitors to walk around the building and enter through carefully planned landscaping. Most visitors, however, entered through the back door on the ground floor, missing the entry experience that Kahn had designed. The new building will solve the problem with an underground parking garage. After visitors ascend to the gallery level of the new building, they can exit it and walk across the lawn and the courtyard to enter the original building as Kahn had intended.

===Recognition===
* In 1998, the American Institute of Architects gave the museum their prestigious Twenty-five Year Award, which is awarded to no more than one building per year.
* Robert Campbell, architectural critic for the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; and winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism, declared it to be &quot;the greatest American building of the second half of the 20th century.&quot;
* Robert McCarter, author of &quot;Louis I. Kahn&quot;, said that the Kimbell Art Museum &quot;is rightly considered Kahn&#x27;s greatest built work&quot; and &quot;has been the subject of more scholarly studies than all his other works combined.&quot;
* Carter Wiseman, author of &quot;Louis I. Kahn: Beyond Time and Style&quot;, said, &quot;With the Kimbell, Kahn had achieved something unique in the history of modern architecture, a building that engages an element of nature—sunlight—with unprecedented skill and combined it with a contemporary program in a structure that also called upon the most advanced engineering while invoking the monuments of the past.&quot;
* Thos. S. Byrne, Ltd., the construction contractor, won the first Build America Award from the Associated General Contractors of America in 1972 for the &quot;innovative construction techniques&quot; used on the museum.

==Management==
The Kimbell Art Museum derives around 65% of its $12 million budget from its unrestricted endowment of more than $400 million. The endowment fell from $466 million to $398 million during the 2007–2008 financial crisis. The museum has no special funds for acquisitions. Museum membership is at 15,000. In 2019, the museum appointed Guillaume Kientz as the curator of European art; he had previously worked in the Louvre.

<text>Battlefield 2 is a first-person shooter video game developed by Digital Illusions CE and published by Electronic Arts for Microsoft Windows. It was released in June 2005 as the third game in the &quot;Battlefield&quot; franchise.

Players fight in a modern battlefield, using modern weapon systems. &quot;Battlefield 2&quot; is a first-person shooter with strategy and tactical shooter elements.

The single-player aspect features missions that involve clashes between U.S. Marines, China and the fictional Middle Eastern Coalition. The multiplayer aspect of the game allows players to organize into squads that come under the leadership of a single commander to promote teamwork. The story takes place in the early 21st century during a fictional world war between various power blocs: China, the European Union, the fictional Middle Eastern Coalition (MEC), Russia and the United States. The game takes place in different fronts, as the Middle East and China are being invaded by US and EU forces, and the United States is being invaded by Chinese and MEC forces.

On June 30, 2014, the multiplayer master server was shut down alongside other GameSpy-powered titles, although it can still be played online throughout fan-created mods with alternative servers. In 2017, Electronic Arts demanded the takedown of the modified versions of &quot;Battlefield 2&quot; on alternate servers, distributed by a group known as &quot;Revive Network&quot;, as infringement of their copyrights.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Battlefield 2&quot; is a sequel to &quot;Battlefield Vietnam&quot;, with many changes to the popular gameplay of the original. Many of these new gameplay features were added to the game with teamwork and collaboration in mind. The new game engine includes improved physics, dynamic lighting, and more realistic material penetration.

&quot;Battlefield 2&quot; is a multiplayer video game played via the Internet or on a local area network. A single-player mode with three difficulty levels is included. Both player modes use the same maps and use &quot;Battlefield&quot;″s conquest game mode. Single-player mode allows 16 computer-controlled players while Internet mode allows up to 64 players. Players can choose to play as the United States Marine Corps, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, or the &quot;Middle Eastern Coalition&quot;. Additional factions are playable through the expansion packs, such as the European Union. Progress in the game is made via promotions which allow additional weapons to be unlocked. By playing the game on ranked servers, players are able to add to their global player statistics. These statistics are used to award promotions and other achievements.

In &quot;Battlefield 2&quot;, players are divided into two opposing teams (which factions they represent is dependent upon the map). The key objective in &quot;Battlefield 2&quot; is to reduce the opposing teams tickets. Tickets represent an army&#x27;s ability to reinforce their position on the battlefield; each team has only a limited supply of tickets, and each casualty on the battlefield reduces the number of available tickets. Control points represent key points on the map, and are represented by flags. Control points are &quot;Battlefield 2&quot;″s spawn points, and one team possessing a significant majority of the control points causes the other teams tickets to gradually decrease, regardless of casualties. A round ends when one team&#x27;s tickets gone, the round&#x27;s timer ends, or if at any point a team holds no control points, and has no soldiers alive on the battlefield (meaning they are not present in any way on the battlefield).

&quot;Battlefield 2&quot;″s two game modes are Conquest and Cooperative. The only difference between the two modes is that Cooperative includes computer-controlled players, whilst Conquest allows only human players. Results from Cooperative mode do not count toward global player statistics.

=== Infantry classes ===
In &quot;Battlefield 2&quot;, as with previous &quot;Battlefield&quot; titles, players are able to select from a variety of infantry classes. Each class of soldier is equipped with different weaponry appropriate to their role in the battle. Assault soldiers, for example, are general-purpose infantry with grenade-launcher equipped assault-rifles and extra armor, Medics carry first-aid equipment such as a field defibrillator, and Anti-Tank troopers are equipped with missiles which are effective against heavy armor.

Players are able to choose a class at the start of a match, or between dying and respawn. Players can also change their class by picking up a &quot;kit&quot; from the body of an incapacitated soldier, friendly or otherwise. Hence, an Assault soldier can become a Medic if they come across a fallen Medic. Player classes are divided in &#x27;Heavy&#x27; (with reduced damage done to the torso, but lower stamina) and &#x27;Light&#x27; (with standard multipliers, but higher stamina, thus able to sprint for a longer time).

Within the infantry class, there are three support classes with special abilities. The Engineer can repair with his wrench, the Medic can revive with his defibrillator paddles and heal, and the Support can resupply ammunition with his ammunition bags. When one of these three classes occupies a vehicle, nearby personnel and vehicles can be replenished, repaired or healed by being in close proximity.

* Assault - Primary role is to engage in combat with enemies at medium range.
* Medic - Primary role is to revive and heal teammates
* Anti-Tank - Primary role is to undertake anti-tank warfare
* Engineer - Primary role is to repair or destroy vehicles
* Support - Primary role is to provide suppressive fire against enemies and resupply teammates
* Special Forces - Primary role is carry out stealth and sabotage missions
* Sniper - Primary role is to engage targets at long distances.

=== Vehicles ===
The various forces still use the trademark feature of the &quot;Battlefield&quot; series – the large stable of vehicles that any player can climb into and control. There are many different types of vehicles playable in &quot;Battlefield 2&quot;, all based on real-life vehicles used by the militaries of different countries.

In contrast to &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot;, &quot;Battlefield 2&quot; has only one purely water-based vehicle, the rigid-inflatable boat; however, the three APCs can travel in water as well. The developers tried to design the game so that every vehicle would be weak to another type of vehicle, intending to create a situation similar to a game of rock-paper-scissors. For example, mobile anti-air was intended to effectively destroy helicopters, but are vulnerable against opposing tanks. Included within this relationship are stationary defenses such as light machine guns and anti-aircraft/TOW emplacements. The availability and number of certain vehicles are dependent on the map and its size as well as control points captured. Also, more vehicles become available to be used on the maps of expansion/booster packs. (see Maps). The USS Essex is the only naval ship featured in BF2, featuring two spawn points and aircraft spawn points, and is not drivable or destroyable, except for its Phalanx turrets.

=== Squads ===

Players are able to form squads of up to six soldiers in order to more effectively work as a team. Up to nine squads are permitted per team; each squad has a number (automatically assigned) and name (usually a phonetic alphabet letter) for identification. Members of a squad have the ability to communicate with one another via &quot;Battlefield 2&quot;″s integrated voice over IP (VoIP) system.

Squad leaders may assign their squad a variety of objectives (for example, moving to or attacking a specific location). Orders may also be given by the team&#x27;s commander. Squad leaders are able to issue requests for commander assets (such as artillery fire) and have a direct VoIP channel to the commander.

Members of a squad may spawn near their squad leader, provided that the leader is not dead (or incapacitated), and that the team holds at least one control point. This feature allows squads to more quickly regroup after taking casualties.

=== Commander ===

The commander position is an exclusive role played by one member of each team. Any member of a team may apply for the position, but priority is given to players of higher rank.

The commander alone has access to the &quot;commander screen&quot;, an interface similar to that of a real-time strategy game. This allows the commander an overview of the battlefield as a whole, or zoom in and view parts of the map in real-time. The commander also has control of the various commander assets, which include artillery strikes, vehicle and supply drops, and UAV&#x27;s. They can deploy them to assist their team. The commander can communicate with squads either by sending orders, or via VoIP voice communication. These tools allow the commander to strategically coordinate their forces on the battlefield.

A commander may resign at any point, freeing the position for other members of their team; they may also be forcibly removed by a successful mutiny vote conducted by their team (provided the server allows mutiny votes). Although the commander does not gain points by normal methods (kills, flag captures, etc.), their score is doubled at the end of the round if their team wins.

The commander position would be seen again in &quot;Battlefield 2142&quot; and &quot;Battlefield 4&quot;.

=== Awards and unlockable weapons ===
Players can earn awards (ribbons, badges, and medals) for certain in-game accomplishments. Badges and ribbons are the easiest to obtain, while medals are usually much harder, requiring more extensive play. As players ascend through the ranks they will gain the ability to unlock certain weapons. Each time a player is promoted to an eligible rank, they are given the opportunity to unlock one of seven unlockable weapons, one for each class, which they may subsequently use in place of the standard weapon for the given class.

=== Battlefield recorder ===
A built-in game recorder records battles for subsequent replay. These files can be downloaded from a server which supports BattleRecorder directly after their respective game. Recorded battle files are around 1 to 8 megabytes in size and are played within the &quot;Battlefield 2&quot; engine. Camera angles can be changed (free roaming &amp; selected player), as well as the speed, though there is no rewind capability. Files can be exported to AVI format. The Battlefield Recorder has facilitated the creation of various machinima. Usage of the PunkBuster service is mandatory for all official ranked &quot;Battlefield 2&quot; servers, but optional for unranked servers.

=== Maps ===

&quot;Battlefield 2&quot; offers 15 maps for the players to play but shipped with 12. These maps are diverse, ranging from swamps such as Songhua Stalemate, to urban areas such as Strike at Karkand, to an unfinished dam known as Kubra Dam. The USMC is present in all maps and faces against either the MEC or the PLA depending on the map. The PLA is present in Far East theaters such as Dragon Valley and Daqing Oilfields. MEC is present in Middle East theaters such as Gulf of Oman and Zatar Wetlands. The BF2 series including the expansion and booster packs puts the map count at 29 maps.

&quot;Battlefield 2&quot; maps have 3 variations, each suited for a certain number of players. Each map has 16, 32, and 64 player-suggested variations in which the area of battlefield or playing field is relatively small, medium, and large, respectively. The only exceptions to this are Wake Island 2007, which is locked at 64-player size and the &quot;Euro Force&quot; maps, Operation Smokescreen, Great Wall, and Taraba Quarry, which have no 64-player size. 32 and 64 player maps are unavailable to offline players from retailers, but an option is given to download 64 Single player AI bot mods. Other contrasts between these variations other than the size are the number and position of control points and availability of vehicles. As a result, the gameplay of the map is different depending on the variation.

== Plot ==
The game is set in 2007 during a world war between various power blocs: the United States, aided by the European Union, is at war against Russia, China and the fictional Middle Eastern Coalition (MEC), aided by various insurgents.

There is no given reason as to how or why the war broke out. In-game, the European Union and the United States fight China and the MEC. It is mentioned in-game that the US and EU are allies and the EU has negotiated a truce with Russia, but it is unknown if China and the MEC are allies. The game also takes place in different fronts, as the Middle East and China are being invaded by US and EU forces, and the United States is being invaded by Chinese and MEC forces.

== Additional content ==

=== &quot;Battlefield 2: Special Forces&quot; ===
&quot;Battlefield 2&quot;&#x27;s first expansion pack, &quot;Special Forces&quot;, first began its development sometime during or shortly before the release of the original &quot;Battlefield 2&quot;, and was worked on by DICE&#x27;s Canadian division. &quot;Battlefield&quot; producer, Mike Doran, commented in August 2005 that &quot;The truth is that work on &quot;Battlefield 2: Special Forces&quot; began several months ago.&quot; It was officially announced on July 14, 2005 and released on November 21 of the same year. The focus of the development was infantry-based combat as opposed to vehicle-centric combat from the original. As such, most of the additional content in the expansion pack can only be used by or for infantry.

The expansion pack provides eight maps, 6 playable factions, and ten more vehicles such as the AH-64D Apache and Mi-35 Hind, though all jets have been removed. In addition to these new contents, players have access to new equipment such as night vision goggles, tear gas, gas masks, zip lines and grappling hooks which can alter gameplay. There are eight more small arms weapons available such as the G36K/E and FN SCAR L/H and several weapons from the original are replaced. The expansion offers more awards in the form of badges, ribbons, and medals that players can earn. Finally, many of the weapons from the expansion may be used in the original &quot;Battlefield 2&quot;.

=== Booster packs ===
Booster packs are additional content released for &quot;Battlefield 2&quot; that are currently available for free download, and as with &quot;Special Forces&quot;, they were developed by DICE Canada. The booster packs were later available in retail form as the &quot;Booster Pack Collection&quot;, containing a DVD which features these packs, as well as being included in &quot;The Complete Collection&quot;, containing a DVD with both the original game and all of the expansions/booster packs.

Booster packs add a significant amount of content to the game, but are different from expansion packs because they are intended to add to the original gameplay and not stand on their own (such as &quot;Special Forces&quot; does). The booster packs include new maps, vehicles, and a new European Union faction.

The two booster packs were included free of charge in the 1.50 update released on September 1, 2009.

==== &quot;Euro Force&quot; ====
&quot;Battlefield 2: Euro Force&quot; is the first booster pack, and was released on March 14, 2006. The booster pack allows players to play as a new European Union army, armed with new weapons and vehicles from the various countries of the EU. It is available for purchase online at the Electronic Arts download service, or as part of the retail &quot;Booster Pack Collection&quot;. It was scheduled for release in February, but was delayed due to a substantial number of new bugs caused by the release of patch 1.2. It features a whole new army, 4 new vehicles, 3 new maps, and 7 new weapons such as the L85A2 with AG36 GL, the FAMAS, the HK53, the HK21, and the Benelli M4. Some of the vehicles for the EU military include the Challenger 2, Eurocopter Tiger, Leopard 2A6 and the Eurofighter. The maps include &#x27;The Great Wall of China&#x27;, against the People&#x27;s Liberation Army of China, where the EU army is trying to gain a strong foothold in northern China, to reinforce their American allies in the south later on. &#x27;Operation Smoke Screen&#x27; features the EU army fighting the MEC in the Middle East for precious oil fields, and the third map, &#x27;Taraba Quarry&#x27;, where the EU army is trying to reinforce American positions in the south. Mindful of the European plans, the MEC tries to stall the EU, where the Europeans must confront their enemies because that route is the only possible path along that side of the Caspian Sea.

It was made free with patch 1.5.

==== &quot;Armored Fury&quot; ====
&quot;Battlefield 2: Armored Fury&quot; is the second booster pack released for &quot;Battlefield 2&quot; and was released on June 6, 2006. It added three new maps, as well as two new vehicle classes: attack jets for close air support and reconnaissance helicopters that operate as a mobile UAV. The booster pack has the USMC defending U.S. soil from invasions from the PLA and MEC. Operation Midnight Sun features the Chinese landing at the Alaskan port Valdez where they are trying to secure much needed fuel from the pipeline. Operation Road Rage is a MEC vs. USMC map, where the MEC are using US Highways to transport units to industrial areas. Operation Harvest sees the United States trying to stall the MEC en route to the capital of Washington D.C. from the northwest, being blocked in a Pennsylvania Dutch farm, while waiting for reinforcements. New vehicles include Attack or Close Air Support aircraft such as the A-10 Thunderbolt II, Su-39 and the Nanchang Q-5 as well as new light utility helicopters such as MH-6 Little Bird, EC-635 and the Z-11. As well as the addition of new helicopters and planes, DICE also added the Muscle Car and Semi Truck. However, the proposed AV-8B Harrier was cut from the add-on due to balancing issues.

Like Euro Force, it was made free with patch 1.5.

== Soundtrack ==

The soundtrack of Battlefield 2 consists of 18 tracks composed and created by Fredrik Englund, David Tallroth, and Jonas Östholm.

== Reception ==
The game received widespread critical acclaim, garnering an aggregate score of 91/100 from 55 reviews on Metacritic. It received five stars out of five from publications Yahoo! Games, GameSpy, X-Play and Computer Gaming World. PC Gamer awarded it 94%, stating, &quot;Its finely tuned maps and balanced gameplay prove that you &quot;can&quot; improve on perfection,&quot; and honored it as Game of the Year. GameSpot rated the game 9.3 out of 10 claiming that &quot;when you experience &quot;Battlefield 2&quot; like it&#x27;s meant to be played, with everyone working together and using real-time voice chat, the game quickly becomes unlike anything else that you&#x27;ve played before.&quot;

Some of the lower scores were reactions to the large amount of bugs and glitches in the initial release, including crash to desktop bugs and network problems. For example, Gaming Nexus (who awarded the game an 8.7 out of 10) reported, &quot;I’ve had many cool experiences playing it and a lot of &#x27;did I just see that&#x27; moments but all of that is crapped on by the bugs and quirks in the game.&quot;

GamesRadar approved of the game, awarding a 90%, but added a disclaimer that the gaming experience is best &quot;if your machine is up to it&quot;. GameSpot&#x27;s review agreed with the high system requirements noting that &quot;the load times are one of the biggest gripes that we have, as you will spend quite a bit of time waiting for a game to start up, even on high-end machines...also a bit demanding in the hardware department.&quot;

&quot;Battlefield 2&quot; sold 1.2 million copies in its first month after release. Total sales by July 2006 were 2,225,000. It received a &quot;Gold&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

&quot;Battlefield 2&quot; won &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;″s &quot;Best Multiplayer Game 2005&quot; and &quot;Game of the Year 2005&quot; awards. The magazine&#x27;s Dan Stapleton wrote, &quot;Few other games in the history of the medium have so effectively captured the visceral feeling of modern military combat in an urban environment&quot;. The editors of &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; presented &quot;Battlefield 2&quot; with their 2005 awards for &quot;Best Action Game&quot; and &quot;Best Multiplayer&quot;, and named it the year&#x27;s second-best computer game overall. They called it &quot;perhaps the most thrilling example of how far shooters have come in the last few years.&quot;

During the 9th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences awarded &quot;Battlefield 2&quot; with &quot;First-Person Action Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Online Gameplay&quot;, along with a nomination for &quot;Computer Game of the Year&quot;.

<text>PunkBuster is a computer program that is designed to detect software used for cheating in online games. It does this by scanning the memory contents of the local machine. A computer identified as using cheats may be banned from connecting to protected servers. The aim of the program is to isolate cheaters and prevent them from disrupting legitimate games. PunkBuster is developed and published by Even Balance, Inc.

==History==
Tony Ray founded Even Balance to develop PunkBuster after his experience with cheaters on &quot;Team Fortress Classic&quot;.

The first beta of &quot;PunkBuster&quot; was announced on September 21, 2000, for &quot;Half-Life&quot;. Valve was at the time fighting a hard battle against cheating, which had been going on since the release of the game. The first game in which PunkBuster was integrated was id Software&#x27;s &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot;.

==Features==

===Published features===
* Real-time scanning of memory, by placing a PunkBuster Client on players&#x27; computers searching for known hacks/cheats using a built-in database.
* Throttled two-tiered background auto-update system using multiple Internet Master Servers to provide end-user security ensuring that no false or corrupted updates can be installed on players&#x27; computers.
* Frequent status reports are sent to the PunkBuster Server by all players. When necessary, the PunkBuster Server raises a violation which (depending upon settings) will cause the offending player to be removed from the game and all other players to be informed of the violation.
* PunkBuster Admins can also manually remove players from the game for a specified number of minutes or permanently ban if desired.
* PunkBuster Servers can optionally be configured to randomly check player settings looking for known exploits of the game engine.
* PunkBuster Servers can be configured to instruct clients to calculate partial MD5 hashes of files inside the game installation directory. The results are compared against a set configuration and differences logged, and optionally, the client removed from the server.
* PunkBuster Admins can request actual screenshot samples from specific players and/or can configure the PB Server to randomly grab screenshot samples from players during gameplay. However, it is possible for a game hack to block screenshots (producing a cropped screenshot) or remove all visual features of a hack (cleaning the screenshot) to remain undetected, leaving the effectiveness of this feature diminished.
* An optional &quot;bad name&quot; facility is provided so that PunkBuster Admins can prevent players from using offensive player names containing unwanted profanity or slurs.
* Search functions are provided for PunkBuster Admins who wish to search player&#x27;s keybindings and scripts for anything that may be known to exploit the game.
* The PunkBuster Player Power facility can be configured to allow players to self-administer game servers when the Server Administrator is not present entirely without the need for passwords, in which the players can call votes to have a player removed from the server for a certain amount of time.
* PunkBuster Servers have an optional built-in mini HTTP web server interface that allows the game server to be remotely administered via a web browser from anywhere over the Internet.
* PunkBuster Admins can stream their server logs in real time to another location.
* PunkBuster has initiated Punkbuster Hardware Bans, that bans hardware components upon detection of cheats that disrupt or circumvent PunkBuster&#x27;s normal operation. These bans mean permanently banning players whose HD id matches the blacklist at Evenbalance.

==Incompatibilities==

Some games (like &quot;Crysis&quot; or &quot;BioShock 2&quot;) do not have a 64-bit version of PunkBuster. For this reason, 64 bit clients will not be able to play in PunkBuster enabled servers unless they run the 32-bit client of the game.

PunkBuster does not allow Windows users without administrative accounts to connect to any games. Upon connecting to a game, the user will be immediately kicked for having insufficient OS privileges. Starting with PB client v1.700, a Windows service with full administrative rights is used in complement with the ingame PunkBuster client, allowing updates without user rights elevation. However, some games might still require administrative rights before PunkBuster will function correctly.

==Enforcement==

===Global GUID bans and Hardware bans===
&quot;PunkBuster&quot; uses a system called &#x27;global banning&#x27;. Either the GUID (generated from the CD key) or parts of the computer&#x27;s hardware are banned from &quot;PunkBuster&quot;-enabled servers. Most attempts at cheating will only receive a detection warning, but cheats that interfere with &quot;PunkBuster&#x27;s&quot; software itself could lock out the GUID of the offending system and disable access to all &quot;PunkBuster&quot; enabled servers for that particular game. Particularly severe instances of cheating may lock the offending computer out of all PunkBuster-protected games.

As of June 30, 2004, Even Balance has used unique hardware identifiers to permanently ban players who attempt to interfere with PunkBuster&#x27;s normal operation (which is, itself, a violation of the PunkBuster EULA). Even Balance uses a 128-bit private one-way hash so that no serial number information for individual computers can be obtained from a hardware GUID.

As with previous &quot;PunkBuster&quot; GUID bans, hardware GUID lockouts are permanent. Even Balance has not disclosed what hardware PunkBuster looks for when issuing a ban, but close examination of the software has indicated that the GUID may be based on the serial numbers of scanned hard-drives. As with many bans based on information from the user&#x27;s system, hardware GUID bans can be spoofed.

===False positives===

During the period of October 30 to November 6, 2013, Punkbuster was falsely banning Battlefield 4 users with the error &quot;(Gamehack #89265)&quot;. As of November 8, 2013 the issue has been resolved by Even Balance inc. and all Punkbuster bans resulting from this error have been resolved and officially deemed a false-positive.
: &quot;We have confirmed that Violation #89265 may be triggered by non-cheat software. This Violation code has been removed from our master servers and we encourage server admins to give the benefit of the doubt to players who raised this code over the past few days.&quot;

===Attacks on PunkBuster===
PunkBuster usually searches for known cheat program signatures as opposed to relying on a heuristic approach. On March 23, 2008, hackers published and implemented a proof of concept exploit of PunkBuster&#x27;s indiscriminate memory scanning. Because PunkBuster scans all of a machine&#x27;s virtual memory, malicious users were able to cause mass false positives by transmitting text fragments from known cheat programs onto a high population IRC channel. When PunkBuster detected the text within user&#x27;s IRC client text buffers, the users were banned. On March 25, 2008, Even Balance confirmed the existence of this exploit.

<doc id="840363" wikidata="Q926860" url="?curid=840363" title="North American XF-108 Rapier">
<text>The North American XF-108 Rapier was a proposed long-range, high-speed interceptor aircraft designed by North American Aviation intended to defend the United States from supersonic Soviet strategic bombers. The aircraft would have cruised at speeds around with an unrefueled combat radius over , and was equipped with radar and missiles offering engagement ranges up to against bomber-sized targets.

To limit development costs, the program shared engine development with the North American XB-70 Valkyrie strategic bomber program, and used a number of elements of earlier interceptor projects. The program had progressed only as far as the construction of a single wooden mockup when it was canceled in 1959, due to a shortage of funds and the Soviets&#x27; adoption of ballistic missiles as their primary means of nuclear attack. Had it flown, the F-108 would have been the heaviest fighter of its era.

Prior to the project&#x27;s cancellation, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower noted that raising the F-108 interceptor force would have cost the U.S. taxpayer $4 billion (equivalent to $ billion today).
==Development==
=== LRI-X===

During the early 1950s, the USAF proposed a very high-performance, long-range interceptor. On 20 July 1955, formal development of what became known as the Long-Range Interceptor, Experimental (LRI-X) was approved, planned as an F-102 Delta Dagger/F-106 Delta Dart replacement. The specification was laid down on 6 October 1955, calling for an interceptor that could fly at at a speed of Mach 1.7 (, with a range of . It was to have a two-man crew and at least two engines. A further consideration was that an integrated fire-control system would be fitted, allowing the interception of a bomber at and three targets to be destroyed during a single mission.

Of the eight interested companies, contracts for preliminary studies were issued to North American Aviation, Lockheed and Northrop on 11 October 1955, five days after the specification&#x27;s release. Of the paper designs, the North American proposal, dubbed &quot;NA-236&quot;, seemed the most promising. The NA-236 shared some similarities with the XF-108, although the most obvious differences were the additions of two finlets at the midspan of the horizontal stabilizers, and canards. Political and budgetary difficulties led to the cancellation of the program on 9 May 1956.

===WS-202A===
After considerable confusion, the program was reinstated on 11 April 1957 with North American awarded a contract for two prototypes. The designation F-108 was issued, also known as &quot;Weapon System 202A&quot; (WS-202A). North American&#x27;s company designation was &quot;NA-257&quot;, although it was basically identical to the NA-236. At the time, Air Defense Command anticipated an order for 480 aircraft.

The resulting design went through considerable evolution, owing to both its cutting-edge technology and continual redefinition of the USAF requirements. Early revisions prominently featured canards, with a span of , and a wing of 53.5° sweep. The aircraft in this configuration would have had a maximum takeoff weight of with a operational ceiling. In addition to the F-108&#x27;s interceptor role, North American proposed it as a penetration fighter to aid its own B-70 Valkyrie supersonic bomber prototype. Commonality between the B-70 bomber and the F-108 included the escape capsule and General Electric YJ93 engines. Another role considered was for the F-108 to be &quot;gap-fillers&quot; for the Distant Early Warning (DEW) system; because of its great speed, the F-108 could have scanned up to per hour.

From September 1958, substantial engineering and design changes were implemented; however, SAC had lost interest in the escort fighter concept. To accompany the B-70 all the way to its target and back, the F-108 in its initial concept would have, at best, marginal range. On 30 December 1958, YF-108A preproduction aircraft on order were reduced from 31 to 20 test aircraft and the first test flight was delayed from February to April 1961. The eventual design, which was built as a full-sized XF-108 mockup, was displayed to Air Force officials on 17–20 January 1959. The project was given the name &quot;Rapier&quot; on 15 May 1959, following a contest by the Air Defense Command asking airmen for suggestions.

===Cancellation===
Even as the XF-108 program was progressing well, there were signs that would ultimately lead to its eventual cancellation. Unconfirmed Soviet bomber threats, the overwhelming trend toward offensive and defensive nuclear missiles in the late 1950s and early 1960s, as well as rising costs, contributed to the termination of the XF-108. The cancellation was announced on 23 September 1959. North American continued refining the design through 1960 in hopes that the program might be revived. Despite the extra money and time spent on the Rapier, it was not wholly in vain; the North American A-5 Vigilante supersonic carrier-based nuclear strike bomber developed for the U.S. Navy, which was later modified into a carrier-based reconnaissance aircraft, retained the fuselage/weapon package and systems design of the Rapier. In many ways the Vigilante could be seen as the successful scaled-down application of the Rapier design principles in a Mach 2 supersonic design.

Hughes Aircraft would continue the development of the advanced fire control system and the GAR-9 missile. Development of the F-108 radar and missiles was continued by the USAF and the system was eventually used in the Lockheed YF-12 program. The final configuration for the rear cockpit in the YF-12A looked similar to that of the F-108 since it incorporated the same displays and controls required for the Hughes AN/ASG-18 fire control system.

==Design==
The initial F-108 configuration featured a very large &quot;cranked&quot; delta wing. There were fixed ventral stabilizers on the wings, mounted at mid-span, and a tall all-moving vertical tailfin, supplemented by two ventral stabilizers that extended when the landing gear retracted. Although some earlier versions of the design had separate tailplanes or forward canards, both were abandoned in the final design. The large fuselage and wing had two and five fuel tanks, respectively, giving an estimated combat radius of some . Top speed was estimated at , about Mach 3, at . The aircraft was powered by two General Electric J93 turbojet engines, also used in North American&#x27;s XB-70 Valkyrie bomber, in the fuselage.

The F-108 was intended to carry the Hughes AN/ASG-18 radar, the U.S.&#x27;s first pulse-Doppler radar set. It was to have look-down/shoot-down capability, but could track only one target at a time. The radar was paired with an infra-red search and tracking (IRST) system on the wing leading edges. The radar was used to guide the Hughes GAR-9 (later redesignated AIM-47) air-to-air missile, three of which would be carried on a rotary launcher in an internal weapons bay. The GAR-9 was a very large, long-range weapon with its own radar set for terminal homing. It was intended to fly at Mach 6, with a range of almost .

==XQ-11 target drone==
As part of WS-202A, a design for a high-speed (Mach 3+) aerial target for use in testing the F-108&#x27;s weapons system was proposed. The Wright Air Development Center requested the designation XQ-11 for the target design; the request was denied due to the early stage of development, and the F-108 program was cancelled before further work was undertaken.

<text>Corick () is a megalithic site and townland in the civil parish of Ballynascreen, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland. It includes a stone circle and a stone row. The Corick stone circles and alignments are located 2 km north east of Ballybriest court-tomb, 400 metres south of Corick clachan, near a stream. The stone alignments and circle are Scheduled Historic Monuments in Corick at grid reference: Area of H780 896.

==Function==
Although it is often believed the stone monuments were intentionally aligned to serve a greater purpose, the crudeness of the stones means that they could not have been used as advanced astronomical calculators. Their positioning therefore is more likely symbolic rather than functional.

<text>John Howard Buchanan is a freelance journalist, and was a fringe Republican candidate in the 2004 Presidential election. Buchanan was previously based in Florida and lives in rural Georgia.

Buchanan discovered documents related to Union Banking Corporation&#x27;s business dealings with Fritz Thyssen, the Nazi industrialist who broke with the Nazis after &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; in 1938 and fled to Switzerland during World War II; together with Stacy Michael, Buchanan wrote an article about it for the &quot;New Hampshire Gazette&quot;, accusing one of the directors of the bank, Prescott Bush, of dealing with the Nazis.

He e-mailed a number of threats against journalists and media outlets who refused to publish his theories, saying that he would expose the journalists as &quot;traitors to the truth.&quot; Buchanan was arrested and charged with aggravated stalking in Miami, Florida, over a dispute of how best to publicize his theories, but the charges were dropped in 2004.

During his presidential campaign, he often referred to himself as &quot;the 9/11 Truth Candidate&quot;.
He also opposed the 2003 Iraq war. A United Press International reporter called his campaign &quot;unhinged.&quot;
With 836 votes, Buchanan finished in eighth in the 2004 New Hampshire primary, in which incumbent George W. Bush was not seriously contested.

Buchanan also mulled a 2004 run with the Reform Party. The major contenders for the nomination were Ted Weill and Ralph Nader, the latter of whom was ultimately chosen.

Buchanan served as editor of the Blairsville, GA &quot;Union Sentinel&quot; for 13 weeks in 2005. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said:

<text>Drizzlecombe or Thrushelcombe is an area of Dartmoor in the county of Devon, England, containing a number of Bronze Age stone rows, cairns and menhirs.

There are three principal stone rows each with an associated barrow and terminal menhir. Most of the artifacts are on the southwest slope of Hartor Hill. The tallest menhir, which at high is the largest on Dartmoor, was re-erected by Sabine Baring-Gould, R. Hansford Worth and others in 1893.

Drizzlecombe is located on the western side of Dartmoor, about east of the village of Yelverton, to the west of the upper reaches of the River Plym.

Nearby is the large but damaged cairn known as &quot;Giant&#x27;s Basin&quot;; many of its stones were removed by warreners to build their rabbit-warrens at Ditsworthy, lower down the river. Higher up the slope and overlooking these monuments is a village of stone hut circles, akin to the one at Grimspound. To the north-east lie the extensive remains of Eylesbarrow tin mine and north-west is the concentric Yellowmead stone circle. The area also includes the Neolithic Dartmoor kistvaens, or tombs.

<text>A mechanic is a skilled tradesperson who uses tools to build, maintain, or repair machinery, especially engines. Formerly, the term meant any member of the handicraft trades, but by the early 20th century, it had come to mean one who works with machinery.

==Duties==
Most mechanics specialize in a particular field, such as auto body mechanics, diesel mechanics, air conditioning and refrigeration mechanics, auto mechanics, bicycle mechanics, boiler mechanics, race car mechanics, aircraft mechanics, and other areas. There are also mobile mechanics who work on heavy equipment that will come to you if there is an issue that must be resolved at the location of the machine.

A mechanic is typically certified by a trade association or regional government power. Mechanics may be separated into two classes based on the type of machines they work on, heavyweight and lightweight. Heavyweight work is on larger machines or heavy equipment, such as tractors, construction equipment, and trailers, while lightweight work is on smaller items, such as automobiles.

== Types of mechanics ==
# Automotive mechanics, also known as auto mechanics, specialize in repairing and maintaining automobiles, including cars, trucks, and motorcycles. They work on engines, transmissions, brakes, steering and suspension systems, and other mechanical components of vehicles.
# Truck mechanics specialize in repairing and maintaining trucks, such as tractor units, box trucks, dump trucks and garbage trucks. They work on diesel engines, transmissions, air brakes, steering and suspension systems, and other mechanical components of trucks. 
# Aircraft mechanics, also known as aviation mechanics, specialize in repairing and maintaining aircraft, including planes and helicopters. They work on engines, landing gear, avionics, and other mechanical and electrical systems.
# Marine mechanics specialize in repairing and maintaining boats and other watercraft. They work on engines, transmissions, propellers, steering systems, and other mechanical components of boats.
# Industrial mechanics, also known as maintenance mechanics, work in industrial settings such as factories and manufacturing plants. They are responsible for maintaining and repairing machinery and equipment, including pumps, conveyors, and other mechanical systems.
# Heavy equipment mechanics specialize in repairing and maintaining heavy equipment such as bulldozers, excavators, and cranes. They work on diesel engines, transmissions, hydraulic systems, and other mechanical components of heavy equipment.
# Bicycle mechanics: Bicycle mechanics are tradesmen who specialize in repairing and maintaining bicycles. They work on frames, wheels, brakes, gears, and other mechanical components of bicycles.

==Automotive mechanics== 
Automotive mechanics have many trades within. Some may specialize in the electrical diagnosis, while others may specialize in the mechanical aspects. Other mechanical areas include: brakes and steering, suspension, automatic or manual transmission, engine repairs, auto body repairs, or diagnosing customer complaints.

Automotive mechanics require many years of training to become licensed. Countries like Canada have a governmental certification body that tests and maintains automotive mechanics&#x27; qualifications. The United States of America uses an organization that is called ASE. This organization provides independent testing of an automotive mechanic&#x27;s skills with over 57 different tests that can be taken.

<text>Richard Baker (full name L. Richard Baker III) is an American author and game designer who has worked on many &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; campaign settings.

==Early life, education, and military==
Rich Baker was born and raised in Florida, then moved with his family to New Jersey at age ten. Baker graduated from Virginia Tech in 1988 with a degree in English. He received a commission as an ensign in the U.S. Navy, and served as a deck officer for three years on board the USS &quot;Tortuga&quot;; he qualified as a Surface Warfare Officer and was a lieutenant (junior grade) by the time he left the Navy. Baker married his college sweetheart, Kim Rohrbach. They have two daughters, Alex and Hannah.

==Career==
Baker began looking for a new career, and found one at TSR. &quot;I&#x27;d been playing the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; game off and on since 1979. When I decided to leave the Navy, I sent TSR my résumé just for the pure hell of it. TSR sent me back a writing test, which I must have done pretty well on, since they brought me out for an interview in September of 1991. I&#x27;d never published a word before then or even worked the convention circuit, but they hired me anyway.&quot;

After joining TSR in 1991, Rich worked on most of TSR&#x27;s product lines at one point or another. By 1998, he had published over thirty game products and many magazine articles. Baker started out writing game products such as &quot;Rock of Bral&quot; for the Spelljammer line, as well as material for the Forgotten Realms, Planescape, and Ravenloft settings. Baker and Colin McComb co-designed the Birthright campaign setting. The &quot;Birthright Campaign Setting&quot; boxed set won the 1995 Origins Award for Best New Role-Playing Supplement: &quot;I&#x27;m very proud of it. It represents an entirely new approach to the traditional fantasy roleplaying campaign, and the world itself is filled with a strong sense of history.&quot; Baker also oversaw the development of the &quot;Player&#x27;s Option&quot; series of second edition &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; manuals, stating &quot;I greatly enjoyed the work I did on the &quot;World Builder&#x27;s Guidebook&quot;&quot;.

Baker went on to co-design the &quot;Alternity&quot; science fiction game: &quot;As much as I am proud of my other work, I probably learned the most from the work Bill [Slavicsek] and I put into the &quot;Alterity&quot; game system. Designing a new roleplaying game from the ground up is an immensely complicated undertaking, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the way it turned out.&quot; &quot;Alternity&quot; was completed while TSR was still in operation and was meant to replace &quot;Amazing Engine&quot; as the generic science-fiction role-playing game system for the company, but it was not released; the game was later released by Wizards of the Coast after they bought TSR. Aside from various &quot;Alternity&quot; products, Baker also worked on the &quot;Star*Drive&quot; and &quot;Dark•Matter&quot; settings for the game, and worked as Creative Director on them for a time. Baker wrote several novels for various settings as well.

His game work includes &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (3rd and 4th Edition), &quot;Axis &amp; Allies Miniatures&quot;, &quot;Axis &amp; Allies Naval Miniatures: War at Sea&quot;, and numerous &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; adventures and sourcebooks.

Rich lived in New Jersey, Virginia, Rhode Island, Virginia again, Louisiana, Virginia a third time, and Wisconsin, but now lives in Auburn, Washington, with his wife Kim, two daughters, and cats. He&#x27;s a fan of Golden Age SF and the Philadelphia Phillies.

Rich was at the forefront of Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s range of Forgotten Realms and core Third Edition D&amp;D accessory books, and author of several novels set in and below Faerûn. He also answered questions about the Forgotten Realms at the Wizards website&#x27;s forums – see the below external links.

Baker led the SCRAMJET team, which consisted of James Wyatt, Matt Sernett, Ed Stark, Michele Carter, Stacy Longstreet, and Chris Perkins; this team updated the setting and cosmology of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; as the fourth edition was being developed. Baker and Bruce Cordell wrote a new release of the &quot;Gamma World Roleplaying Game&quot; (2010), which was based on the rules for fourth edition &quot;D&amp;D&quot;. He also headed design on the 4th edition D&amp;D iteration of the Dark Sun Campaign Setting, along with numerous other credits for that edition of the game.

He was also at the forefront of designing the series &quot;Axis and Allies: War at Sea&quot;, a game of tactical World War II naval battles.

On December 14, 2011, Baker announced on his Wizards.com community page that Wizards of the Coast had eliminated his position and he would no longer be an employee of the company. He acknowledged the possibility that he would continue to write for the Forgotten Realms novel line, and hoped to continue design work on the company&#x27;s miniature lines on a freelance basis.

In 2020, Baker announced on his blog that he was joining ZeniMax Online Studios as a senior writer on the &quot;Elder Scrolls Online&quot; video game.

<text>The Courier Car Co. was an automobile manufacturer formed in 1909 by the Stoddard-Dayton Company in Dayton, Ohio, to produce smaller, lighter and lower-priced models than the luxury automobiles produced by Stoddard Dayton.

Its advertisements were early advocates of the compact car: &quot;Don&#x27;t buy more car than you need ... Don&#x27;t you buy a car of greater power or capacity than you need.&quot; The cars were built on a wheelbase and powered by a engine. Four-cylinder models (3245 cc and 3638 cc) were produced.

The car was comparable in size to the Ford Model T, but had three forward gears to Ford&#x27;s two and the Courier was a snappier performer. Only two body styles were offered: an open, four-passenger touring car and a sporty, two-seater sportster.

Like Stoddard-Dayton, Courier formed part in the United States Motor Company. After the acquisition by United States Motors, the 1912 models were called Courier Clermonts. Production ceased in 1913, when United States Motor Company failed.

The Courier plant occupied what had been the Kinsey Manufacturing building on the southwest corner of Wayne Avenue and State Street (now Fourth Street), which now houses the Dayton Plumbing Supply Co.

The discovery and restoration of a Courier is featured in a chapter of Ralph Steubenrauch&#x27;s classic book &quot;The Fun of Old Cars&quot;.

<text>Muskeget Island ( ) is a low, sandy island to the west of Tuckernuck Island and Nantucket, in the town of Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States.

==Geography==
Muskeget Island is part of the terminal moraine marking the maximum extent of the last glacial ice sheet to reach the northeastern coast. It has an area of ; a saltwater lagoon covers of this area. The Muskeget Island group contains Dry Shoal, Skiff Island, Tombolo Point, and Adams Island. Two-thirds of the island is owned by former reporter Crocker Snow Jr., with the rest owned by the town of Nantucket. There are currently two unoccupied shacks on the island, both of which are remnants of old structures, and a small landing strip.

Muskeget has a high elevation of fourteen feet. Its northern shore is mostly sand dunes, while its southern shore is mainly marshes. A sandy point protects and engulfs the lagoon.

==History==
The island was part of Dukes County until 1887 when it was transferred to and annexed by Nantucket County. Shortly after, land on the island was purchased to form the Muskeget Island Club for waterfowl hunting, and several buildings were constructed. Around 1950, half of the island, along with the 8 buildings standing at that time, was purchased by a partnership led by aviator Crocker Snow Sr. (as erosion has changed the shape of that island, that land currently encompasses 2/3 of the island). Snow, who built the Muskeget Island Airport there with his son Crocker Snow Jr., became full owner of the property after the other two partners died. Snow Jr. wrote several books on the island and its ecology and pushed to have it designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service in April 1980, and having a conservation restriction placed on the island in 2009.

==Ecology==
Southern Muskeget island is made up mostly of marshes and grassland.

Muskeget is the southernmost breeding place of grey seals, the most common mammal on the island, and Muskeget and Monomoy islands are the primary seal colonies off the New England coast. In 2008, more than 2,000 pups were born on Muskeget. With this large seal population, the waters surrounding Muskeget are an important feeding area for great white sharks.

The island is also home to an endemic species of rodent known as the Muskeget vole or beach vole, one of two terrestrial mammal species on the island. This vole feeds on beach grass stalks, leaves and seeds, and insect adults and larvae. Their predators include domestic cats (which were extirpated from the island some time in the late 1800s), short-eared owls, and northern harriers. The IUCN has classified the beach vole as vulnerable.

Endangered species of pirate spiders, piping plovers, roseate terns and arctic terns can also be found on the island.

==Access==
Muskeget is inaccessible to most boats because of shoals and sandbars. Kayaking there can be very dangerous because of rip currents, swells, and whirlpools. Specialized boats designed to navigate the difficult waters around the Island depart from Nantucket Harbor.

Muskeget Island Airport, is a small privately-owned turf landing strip 1100&#x27; in length x 25&#x27; in width on the island. It is said to be accessible to STOL aircraft, but has been designated by the FAA as being for emergency use only.

<text>Ludwig Franz Benedikt Biermann (March 13, 1907 in Hamm – January 12, 1986 in München) was a German astronomer, obtaining his Ph.D. from Göttingen University in 1932.

He made important contributions to astrophysics and plasma physics, discovering the Biermann battery. He predicted the existence of the solar wind which in 1947 he dubbed &quot;solar corpuscular radiation&quot;.

He was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in the fall of 1961. He won the Bruce Medal in 1967 and the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1974.

Asteroid 73640 Biermann is named in his honor.

<doc id="840420" wikidata="Q36689" url="?curid=840420" title="Rhaetic">
<text>Rhaetic or Raetic (), also known as Rhaetian, was a Tyrsenian language spoken in the ancient region of Rhaetia in the eastern Alps in pre-Roman and Roman times. It is documented by around 280 texts dated from the 5th through the 1st century BC, which were found through northern Italy, southern Germany, eastern Switzerland, Slovenia and western Austria, in two variants of the Old Italic scripts. Rhaetic is largely accepted as being closely related to Etruscan.

The ancient Rhaetic language is not to be confused with the modern Romance languages of the same Alpine region, known as Rhaeto-Romance.

==Classification==

The German linguist Helmut Rix proposed in 1998 that Rhaetic, along with Etruscan, was a member of a language family he called Tyrrhenian, and which was possibly influenced by neighboring Indo-European languages. Robert S. P. Beekes likewise does not consider it Indo-European. Howard Hayes Scullard (1967), on the contrary, suggested it to be an Indo-European language, with links to Illyrian and Celtic. Nevertheless, most scholars now think that Rhaetic is closely related to Etruscan within the Tyrrhenian grouping.

Rix&#x27;s Tyrsenian family is supported by a number of linguists such as Stefan Schumacher, Carlo De Simone, Norbert Oettinger, Simona Marchesini, and Rex E. Wallace. Common features between Etruscan, Rhaetic, and Lemnian have been observed in morphology, phonology, and syntax. On the other hand, few lexical correspondences are documented, at least partly due to the scanty number of Rhaetic and Lemnian texts and possibly to the early date at which the languages split. The Tyrsenian family (or Common Tyrrhenic) is often considered to be Paleo-European and to predate the arrival of Indo-European languages in southern Europe.

==History==
In 2004 L. Bouke van der Meer proposed that Rhaetic could have developed from Etruscan from around 900 BC or even earlier, and no later than 700 BC, since divergences are already present in the oldest Etruscan and Rhaetic inscriptions, such as in the grammatical voices of past tenses or in the endings of male &quot;gentilicia&quot;. Around 600 BC, the Rhaeti became isolated from the Etruscan area, probably by the Celts, thus limiting contacts between the two languages. Such a late datation has not enjoyed consensus, because the split would still be too recent, and in contrast with the archaeological data, the Rhaeti in the second Iron Age being characterized by the Fritzens-Sanzeno culture, in continuity with late Bronze Age culture and early Iron Age Laugen-Melaun culture. The Raeti are not believed, archeologically, to descend from the Etruscans, as well as it is not believed plausible that the Etruscans are descended from the Rhaeti. Helmut Rix dated the end of the Proto-Tyrsenian period to the last quarter of the 2nd millennium BC. Carlo De Simone and Simona Marchesini have proposed a much earlier date, placing the Tyrsenian language split before the Bronze Age. This would provide one explanation for the low number of lexical correspondences.* 

The language is documented in Northern Italy between the 5th and the 1st centuries BC by about 280 texts, in an area corresponding to the Fritzens-Sanzeno and Magrè cultures. It is clear that in the centuries leading up to Roman imperial times, the Rhaetians had at least come under Etruscan influence, as the Rhaetic inscriptions are written in what appears to be a northern variant of the Etruscan alphabet. The ancient Roman sources mention the Rhaetic people as being reputedly of Etruscan origin, so there may at least have been some ethnic Etruscans who had settled in the region by that time.

In his &quot;Natural History&quot; (1st century AD), Pliny wrote about Alpine peoples:
Pliny&#x27;s comment on a leader named &quot;Rhaetus&quot; is typical of mythologized origins of ancient peoples, and not necessarily reliable. The name of the Venetic goddess &quot;Reitia&quot; has commonly been discerned in the Rhaetic finds, but the two names do not seem to be linked. The spelling as &quot;Raet-&quot; is found in inscriptions, while &quot;Rhaet-&quot; was used in Roman manuscripts; it is unclear whether this &quot;Rh&quot; represents an accurate transcription of an aspirated &quot;R&quot; in Rhaetic, or is merely an error.

== Phonology ==
Our understanding of Rhaetic phonology is quite uncertain, and the working hypothesis is that it is very similar to Etruscan phonology.

=== Vowels ===
It appears that Rhaetic, like Etruscan, had a four-vowel system: /a/, /i/, /e/, /u/. 

=== Consonants ===
Unlike Etruscan, Rhaetic does not seem to have the distinction between aspirated and non-aspirated stops. Consonant phonemes attested in Rhaetic include a dental (or palatal) affricate /ts/, dental sibilant /s/, palatal sibilant /ʃ/, nasals /n/, /m/ and liquids /r/, /l/.

== Morphology ==

=== Nouns ===

The following cases are attested in Rhaetic:
* Nominative/Accusative: No ending
* Genitive: Ending &quot;-s&quot;
* Pertinentive (locative to the genitive): Endings &quot;-si&quot; and &quot;-(a-)le&quot; 
* Locative: Ending &quot;-i&quot; (uncertainly attested)
* Ablative: Ending &quot;-s&quot;

For plural, the ending &quot;-r(a)&quot; is attested.

=== Verbs ===

Two verbal suffixes have been identified, both known from Etruscan:
* &quot;-ke&quot; is the 3rd person preterite ending
* &quot;-u&quot; is the suffix that derives verbal nouns from preterite forms.

<text>IDA Ireland () is the agency responsible for the attraction and retention of inward foreign direct investment (FDI) into Ireland. The agency was founded in 1949 as the Industrial Development Authority and placed on a statutory footing a year later. In 1969 it became a non-commercial autonomous state-sponsored body. Today it is a semi-state body that plays an important role in Ireland&#x27;s relationship with foreign investors, with multinationals accounting for 10.2% of employment and 66% of Irish exports. The agency partners with investors to help them to begin or expand their operations in the Irish market. It provides funding support to research and development projects, and has a number of direct support mechanisms, including employment and training grants.

==History==
In the years following World War II, Ireland began moving towards a more open economic model, away from the old model characterised by import substitution industrialisation. As part of this wider push, the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the time, Daniel Morrissey, proposed the creation of a body to advise the government on industrial policy. The Industrial Development Authority was created to fill this role in 1949.

Throughout the 1950s, the IDA established its vision of &#x27;industrialisation by invitation,&#x27; one which initiated the low corporation-tax system that remains in place in Ireland today. According to an article in a U.S. law journal in 1984, the IDA is &#x27;probably the most powerful governmental agency in Ireland,&#x27; as it &#x27;acts as both coordinator and lobbyist for all matters relating to manufacturing and service industries as well as the industrial infrastructure.&#x27; IDA Ireland has a large global network of branches/offices in the U.S., Europe, and Asia.

==Governance and funding==
While IDA Ireland gets its funding from the Irish State (with costs circa €48m in 2017), as an autonomous non-commercial state-sponsored body, it maintains its own independent board and governance. IDA Ireland is authorised to issue grants and financial incentives to firms coming to Ireland (paying out €91 million in 2017).

==Successes==
The IDA has been successful in attracting multinationals to Ireland over decades. As of 2018, foreign multinationals pay 80% of all Irish corporate taxes, directly employing 25% of the Irish labour-force, and are responsible for 57% of the non-farm economic value-add in Ireland (40% of value-add in Irish services and 80% of value-add in Irish manufacturing). They comprise 14 of Ireland&#x27;s top 20 firms (including tax inversions). Key &quot;selling points&quot; have been the young, English-speaking, flexible workforce, a strong educational system, commercially-aware third level institutions, a location which allows easy exporting into Europe, and the ability to tap into European talent in the wake of Brexit, and a &#x27;clustering effect&#x27; in certain industrial and business sectors.

==Criticisms==
===Narrow base===
The IDA is strongly reliant on the U.S. as a source of FDI. There are no non-U.S./non-U.K. firms in Ireland&#x27;s top 50 firms (by revenue), and only one by employees, the German retailer Lidl. The 14 foreign multinationals in Ireland&#x27;s top 20 firms are all U.S-based (including tax inversions). The U.K. firms in Ireland, outside of retailers like Tesco who sell into Ireland (also like Lidl), are pre-2009 after which the U.K. changed its tax code (see U.K. transformation).

===Taxation===
Up until 2018, the U.S. was one of the last few global jurisdictions not to run a &quot;territorial&quot; tax system (the U.K. switched in 2009–12). Jurisdictions with &quot;territorial&quot; tax systems have separate, and much lower, tax rates for foreign-sourced profits, and companies from such places therefore make less use of Ireland as a base. While the IDA market Ireland as a base from which to sell into Europe, Despite other features, some commentators see Ireland as a base for U.S. multinationals to shield themselves from the pre-TCJA “worldwide” tax system (Ireland is sometimes described as a corporate haven).

U.S. multinationals aside, Ireland&#x27;s main attractiveness is for life sciences manufacturing, who have an optimal combination of intellectual property and tangible assets to use Ireland&#x27;s main IP-based BEPS tool, the capital allowances for intangible assets scheme (which has an Irish effective tax rate of &lt;3%). A key IDA Ireland target market is Japan, which is a large global source of life sciences manufacturing enterprises, and also has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world.

===Brexit===
The IDA has listed managing Brexit as a priority in the coming years. Ireland has been criticised for failing to win substantive London business, and particularly the valuable financial services business, as a result of Brexit. However, the IDA has been credited with achieving limited success in the face of housing and infrastructure shortages and regulatory hurdles, and a 2018 S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence study found that Germany and Ireland were the leaders in attracting financial businesses relocating from London. In the Irish government&#x27;s 2019 budget, IDA Ireland was allocated €2 million for the purposes of Brexit preparedness and increasing Ireland&#x27;s &quot;global footprint&quot;.

==Challenges==
The majority of foreign multinationals in Ireland are also concentrated in a small group of very large technology and life science firms. These firms have the &quot;intellectual property&quot; (or IP) needed to use Ireland&#x27;s IP-based BEPS tax tools (which have effective Irish corporate tax rates of &lt;3%). Ireland&#x27;s largest company Apple, post their giant BEPS inversion in 2015 (see &quot;leprechaun economics&quot;), now represents circa 25% of Irish GDP. Because of Apple, the Central Bank of Ireland has had to replace Irish GDP with modified gross national income (or GNI*).

As well as the beneficial use of Ireland&#x27;s IP-based BEPS tax tools, and a relatively low corporation tax, there remain a range of other reasons for IDA Ireland&#x27;s successes, including the English-speaking location to tap into European talent in the wake of Brexit, the highly skilled workforce, and &#x27;clustering effect&#x27;.

With the overhaul of the U.S. tax code under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and a switch to a &quot;territorial&quot; system, it has been shown the net effective tax rates in the U.S. and Ireland are now almost identical, even with the replacement single malt system still in place (see effect of TCJA on Ireland). There is a concern whether Ireland will suffer in such an environment, both in terms of keeping existing U.S. multinationals and attracting more. This is amplified by Ireland&#x27;s mid-range competitiveness in most non-taxation related aspects; the country is usually positively cited for ease of doing business, but other aspects are seen as less successful (see, for example, the Global Competitiveness Report, where Ireland typically places in the 20th-25th world ranking range).

==Plans==
In 2015 the Irish government announced a five-year plan for the IDA aimed at accelerating economic recovery in the country, setting a target of 80,000 jobs by 2019 and investing €150 million in a regional property programme. This jobs target was reached in 2017. In its 2019 budget the Irish government allocated an additional €10 million to the property programme to promote regional development.

<doc id="840425" wikidata="Q3139648" url="?curid=840425" title="Homefront (American TV series)">
<text>Homefront is an American television drama series created by former &quot;Knots Landing&quot; producers Lynn Marie Latham and Bernard Lechowick in association with Lorimar Television. The show is set in the late 1940s in the fictional city of River Run, Ohio, and aired on ABC from September 24, 1991, to April 26, 1993. The show&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Accentuate the Positive&quot;, was written by Harold Arlen and Johnny Mercer and performed by Jack Sheldon.

==Series overview==
&quot;Homefront&quot; begins in September 1945 and focuses on three families from different backgrounds, the Sloan, Metcalf and Davis families. The Sloans, Mike Sr. and Ruth (Ken Jenkins and Mimi Kennedy), own a steel manufacturing factory initially responsible for making tank parts in the war. They are coming to grips with the death of their only son, Mike Jr., a soldier, and the arrival of his Italian war bride, Gina (Giuliana Santini), a Jewish Holocaust survivor. The Metcalfs include widow Anne (Wendy Phillips) and her three children, Hank (David Newsom), Linda (Jessica Steen) and Jeff (Kyle Chandler). Anne and Linda are dealing with being displaced from their job at the plant for returning GIs, while Hank, a returning soldier, and Jeff, a baseball player for the Cleveland Indians, are involved in a love triangle with college student Sarah Brewer (Alexandra Wilson). Meanwhile, Linda&#x27;s friend, Ginger Szabo (Tammy Lauren) is shocked when her boyfriend Charlie Hailey (Harry O&#x27;Reilly) returns from the war with a British war-bride, Caroline (Sammi Davis). 

Abe (Dick Anthony Williams) and Gloria Davis (Hattie Winston) are descendants from slaves and work for the Sloans as a chauffeur and housekeeper respectively. Their son Robert (Sterling Macer, Jr.) is a decorated veteran who served in Europe with the 761st Armored Battalion. He lands a job at Sloan Industries but is isolated and belittled by his racist co-workers. In the second season, he is joined by Perrette (Perrey Reeves), his white French war bride. Later cast members include Al Kahn (John Slattery), a Jewish union organiser and possible former Communist sympathiser who seduces Anne, and Judy Owens (Kelly Rutherford), a widow working as a bartender who has an affair with Mike Sr.

While the show received critical praise, it struggled in the ratings and was close to being cancelled after its first season. An April 11, 1992 issue of &quot;TV Guide&quot; ran a S.O.S (Save Our Shows) campaign to save five series from cancellation, which included &quot;Homefront&quot;, and two other period pieces (set in the 1950s), &quot;Brooklyn Bridge&quot; on CBS and &quot;I&#x27;ll Fly Away&quot; on NBC. Of the five, &quot;Homefront&quot; received the most votes – 99,591 – and was subsequently renewed. Abigail Van Buren of &quot;Dear Abby&quot; also dedicated a column to the show, urging fans to write into the network to save it. However ratings did not improve in its second season, and after being moved around the schedule numerous times, the show was cancelled.

<text>Adriaan Blaauw (12 April 1914 – 1 December 2010) was a Dutch astronomer.

Blaauw was born in Amsterdam to Cornelis Blaauw and Gesina Clasina Zwart, and studied at Leiden University and the University of Groningen, obtaining his doctorate at the latter in 1946. In 1948, he was appointed an associate professor at Leiden. In the 1950s he worked a few years at the Yerkes Observatory, before returning to Europe in 1957 to become director of the Kapteyn Astronomical Institute in Groningen. Blaauw was closely involved in the founding of the European Southern Observatory, and was its general director from 1970 to 1975. In 1975, he
returned to the Netherlands, becoming a full professor at Leiden, until his retirement in 1981. From 1976 to 1979, he served as president of the International Astronomical Union. He chaired the committee for assigning scientific priorities for the observing programme of the astrometric satellite &quot;Hipparcos.&quot; His research has involved star formation, the motions of star clusters and stellar associations, and distance scale. His main contributions are the explanation of the origin of stars that move with high velocity in our galaxy and the description of star formation in associations.

Among his many honours he was made member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1963, elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1973. In 1989, he was awarded the Bruce Medal. In 1997, the University of Groningen instituted a Blaauw chair and Blaauw lecture in his honour. The asteroid 2145 Blaauw and the Blaauw Observatory are named after him. He died in 2010 in the city of Groningen.

==Honors==
Asteroid 2145 Blaauw is named for him.

<text>Singapore Exchange Limited (SGX Group) is a Singapore-based exchange conglomerate, operating equity, fixed income, currency and commodity markets. It provides a range of listing, trading, clearing, settlement, depository and data services. SGX Group is also a member of the World Federation of Exchanges and the Asian and Oceanian Stock Exchanges Federation. It is ASEAN&#x27;s second largest market capitalization after Indonesia Stock Exchange at as of September 2023.

== History ==
SGX was formed on 1 December 1999 as a holding company. The share capital of some former exchange companies, namely Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES), Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX) that was founded in 1984 and Securities Clearing and Computer Services Pte Ltd (SCCS) were cancelled and new shares issued in these companies were fully paid up by SGX. In this way, all assets previously owned by these three companies were transferred to SGX. The shareholders previously holding shares in SES, SIMEX and SCCS received newly issued SGX shares.

On 23 November 2000, SGX became the third exchange in Asia-Pacific to be listed via a public offer and a private placement after Australian Securities Exchange; which listed in 1998 and Hong Kong Stock Exchange earlier in 2000. Listed on its own bourse, the SGX stock is a component of benchmark indices such as the MSCI Singapore Free Index and the Straits Times Index.

In May 2006, SGX launched Asia&#x27;s first over-the-counter (OTC) clearing platform named SGX AsiaClear for a suite of OTC derivative products to reduce counter-party risks and increase liquidity. It introduced OTC trade registration and clearing for a wide range of forward freight agreements (FFA), and oil swaps. Shortly thereafter, it launched the world&#x27;s first clearing and settlement of iron ore swaps and has since become the world&#x27;s largest clearer of iron swaps.

On 25 September 2006, the Joint Asian Derivatives Exchange (JADE), a joint venture between SGX and Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) became operational. However, this joint venture was cancelled in November 2007, with CME Groups selling of its 50% stake in the joint venture to SGX. The contracts previously traded on JADE were transferred to SGX&#x27;s QUEST trading platform.

In March 2007, SGX bought a 5% stake in Bombay Stock Exchange for 42.7 million dollars.

On 15 June 2007, Tokyo Stock Exchange, Inc. announced that it had acquired a 4.99% stake in SGX. Since then the value of the shares has declined and the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Inc. has made a decision to sell the shares it holds in SGX to its parent company, the Tokyo Stock Exchange Group, Inc.

On 31 January 2008, SGX acquired a 20% stake in Philippine Dealing System Holdings Corp, which has become an associated company of SGX.

On 18 April 2008, SGX opened a representative office in Beijing.

At the beginning of 2008, SGX reached an agreement to buy at least 95% of Singapore Commodity Exchange. On 30 June 2008, SGX completed the acquisition of Singapore Commodity Exchange Ltd (SICOM), which now is a 100% subsidiary.

In August 2009, SGX formed a joint venture with Chi-X Global, called Chi-East. At the beginning of October 2010, this joint venture received approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore to operate a dark pool trading platform.

On 8 June 2010, SGX announced it has opened an office in London. This is part of SGXs move to invest S$250 million into its Reach initiative. By implementing this initiative, SGX plans to create the world&#x27;s fastest trading engine and a data centre as well as further connecting trading communities in the world to Singapore. The new trading platform, SGX Reach, will be delivered to SGX by NASDAQ OMX, Voltaire and HP. This platform is based on GENIUM, a trading platform developed by NASDAQ OMX.

In November 2016 the Singapore Exchange (SGX) acquired the Baltic Exchange, headquartered in London.

In February 2011, SGX has entered a partnership with NASDAQ OMX to provide a suite of tools and solutions for companies, which is designed to support listed companies in Asia.

SGX plans to introduce dual currency trading of securities, which includes stocks, bonds and other listed investments in two different denominations, the Singapore and US dollar on 2 April 2012.

In October 2013, excessive speculation led to the sharp price fall of three mainboard stocks, Blumont Group Ltd, Asiasons Capital Ltd. and LionGold Corp. SGX and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) launched a review of activities around the three stocks, and in February 2014 jointly issued a consultation paper setting out a number of enhancements to strengthen the securities market and protect investors from speculative and market manipulative behaviour. Enhancements included implementing a minimum trading price for mainboard listed issuers, requiring reporting of short positions and the creation of three independent regulatory bodies.

On 6 February 2018, the Singapore Exchange (SGX) and Bursa Malaysia announced a proposed stock market trading link which will be operational by end-2018. The new link will allow investors to conduct trading of shares in an efficient manner. In addition to trading, the link will cover the clearing and settlement of traded stocks, procedures required for post-trading arrangements. Before the launch of the link, cross-border supervisory and enforcement arrangements will be worked upon by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and Securities Commission Malaysia. After the results of the 2018 Malaysian general election, plans for the stock market link were put on hold.

On 21 January 2020, Singapore Exchange (SGX) was listed in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) for the first time in recognition of gender equality, as well as its commitment to diversity and board representation.

=== Merger talks ===
SGX was in merger talks with Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), which would have created a bourse with a market value of US$14 billion had the deal been successful. The Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission said on 15 December 2010 that it would not oppose SGXs takeover of ASX.

SGX&#x27;s plans to buy ASX have drawn criticism from the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which is the second largest shareholder in SGX. A representative of the TSE said SGX&#x27;s bid for ASX &quot;would flag off a race to consolidate&quot;. TSE chief Atsushi Saito fears isolation of the Tokyo Stock Exchange as a result of the takeover.

SGX revised its initial takeover proposal in an attempt to overcome some of the opposition to the plans. This would have decreased the number of Singaporean citizens on the board of the combined company and would have given addition seats to Australians. However, on 8 April 2011, the Treasurer of Australia, Wayne Swan, made the decision to block the merger between the two exchanges. Upon the announcement that the federal government would block the merger, SGX retracted its bid for ASX shares and decided to seek growth opportunities elsewhere.

As of July 2012, SGX was in merger talks with the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and the two exchanges already signed a cross trading agreement. However, on 20 July, SGX said there are no plans for a takeover of or merger with LSE.

== Structure ==
SGX operates several different divisions, each responsible for handling specific businesses.
* SGX ETS (Electronic Trading System): provides global trading access to SGX markets where 80 per cent of the customers are from outside Singapore.
* SGX DT (Derivatives Trading): provides derivatives trading.
* SGX ST (Securities Trading): provides securities trading.
* SGX DC (Derivatives Clearing): subsidiary for clearing and settlement operations.
* SGX AsiaClear: offers clearing services for over-the-counter (OTC) oil swaps and forward freight agreements.
* SGX Reach: an electronic trading platform.
* Central Depository Pte Ltd: subsidiary responsible for securities clearing, settlement and depository services.
* Asian Gateway Investments Pte Ltd: wholly owned subsidiary 
* Singapore Exchange IT Solutions Pte Ltd: provides computer services and maintenance as well as software maintenance

== Listing ==
The companies listed on SGX belong to one of two groups: the companies listed on the SGX Mainboard and the companies listed on SGX NASDAQ. In order to be listed on the mainboard, a company has to fulfill some requirements set forth by SGX, while a listing on NASDAQ is not tied to the fulfilment of any additional conditions. SESDAQ was replaced on 26 November 2007 by the SGX Catalist after an extensive study of other market models and a public consultation in May 2007. The word &quot;Catalist&quot; is an amalgamation of the words &quot;Catalyst&quot; and &quot;List&quot;, to reflect the idea that the Catalist board could be used as a catalyst to propel growth upon listing. Catalist differs from SESDAQ primarily in its use of a sponsor system to determine a prospective company&#x27;s suitability to list and as a corporate advisor to advise on listing and corporate governance issues.

== Trading system ==
The exchange launched SGX QUEST (SGX Quotation and Execution System) in August 2004. The system is used by the exchange for derivatives and securities trading. 
==Financial performance==

As of 31 January 2010, SGX had 774 listed companies with a combined market capitalisation of S$650 billion. The revenues of SGX are mainly from the securities market (75%) and derivatives market (25%).

SGX reported a net profit of $165.8 million for the first half of its financial year 2010. Excluding non-recurring items, net profit was 7% higher compared to 1H FY2009 ($159.2 million). In the second quarter of the financial year 2010, excluding the non-recurring items, net profit of $77.0 million was 3% higher than a year ago. Operating revenue increased 6% to $324.0 million (1H FY2009: $304.9 million).

== Corporate governance code ==
Numerous guidelines are set to be shifted to SGX Listing Rules. At least one-third of the board members are to be independent directors. The shareholding threshold for assessing director independence has been lowered to 5% from 10%. A director will no longer be independent if he or any immediate family member is a substantial shareholder with a 5% stake or more. Relationships between chairman and CEO must be disclosed if they are immediate family members. There will be a proposed 9 year limit on independent directors as a hard limit, or the appointment of independent directors who have served more than nine years to be put to an annual vote requiring approval from majority of all shareholders and majority of non-controlling shareholders, with a transition period of three years to be provided regardless of the option adopted. Directors must be submitted for renomination and reappointment at least once every three years. If dividends are not paid, companies must state the reason.

== Companies listed ==

As of February 2022, there were 672 listed companies (excluding GDRs, Hedge Funds and Debt Securities) on the Singapore Exchange with a market capitalisation of SGD 899,124 million (roughly US$657 billion).

== Major shareholders ==

<doc id="840433" wikidata="Q5106385" url="?curid=840433" title="Chris Denning">
<text>Christopher David Denning (10 May 1941 – 24 June 2022) was an English radio presenter and sex offender. His career effectively ended when he was convicted of sexual offences in 1974. He was imprisoned several times in the United Kingdom, Czechia and Slovakia between 1985 and his death in custody in 2022.

==Early life==
Christopher David Denning was born in Hayes, Middlesex on 10 May 1941. He grew up in Cowley, Oxford, the only child of middle-class parents. He has said that he was a rent boy from the age of 13 and remained so until the age of 18.

==Radio career==
His first radio experience was on a short-wave station in the United States as a teenager before travelling to Kenya to work on British Forces Network. He then returned to the UK in time to become the first announcer heard on BBC Two when it began broadcasting in 1964. He worked for Radio Luxembourg and Radio London before presenting the Saturday afternoon programme &quot;Where It&#x27;s At&quot; with Kenny Everett (produced by Johnny Beerling) on the BBC Light Programme.
He then became one of the original DJs on BBC Radio 1, where he continued presenting &quot;Where It&#x27;s At&quot;, had his own weekly show and deputised as necessary for Tony Blackburn on the latter&#x27;s breakfast show. Denning was gay, and has said that he was &#x27;out&#x27; when he was working at Radio 1.

Denning left Radio 1 in 1969 after facing accusations that his job there came into conflict with his new promotional job at Decca Records, which the BBC had initially agreed to with provisos. He worked for Decca for two years. He then became the number two producer at Bell Records and was involved in developing the careers of the Bay City Rollers and Gary Glitter.

After his employment with radio stations and record companies, he ran his own music and video production business, and was part of a 1997 Radio One reunion with Terry Wogan and Tony Blackburn.

==Legal history==
In 1959, Denning was jailed in Germany for distributing pornographic images.

Denning&#x27;s first conviction for gross indecency and indecent assault was in 1974 when he was convicted at the Old Bailey, although he was not imprisoned. Before his conviction, Denning had been working for Jonathan King&#x27;s newly founded UK Records, but King sacked him after the guilty verdict.

During the 1970s, Denning was part of a group of child sex offenders based around a disco for young people called the Walton Hop. Other participants included Tam Paton, manager of the Bay City Rollers (convicted of child sex offences in 1982), and Jonathan King. All became suspects in Surrey Police&#x27;s Operation Arundel, an investigation focusing on sex offenders, which ultimately led to convictions against King and Denning.

In 1985, he was imprisoned for 18 months for gross indecency with a child, and in 1988 for three years for indecent assault on a 13-year-old boy and possession of indecent photographs. In March 1996, he was imprisoned for ten weeks for publishing indecent photographs. The following year he was held in Pankrác Prison in Prague to await his trial in 2000, which convicted him of abusing seven boys aged under 15. He was released in 2001.

After his release, he was wanted for questioning by Surrey Police, but an extradition attempt by British authorities in the Prague City Court failed because the alleged offences fell outside of the Czech Republic&#x27;s statute of limitation of five years, but Denning was ordered to leave the country &quot;indefinitely&quot;. He was arrested in August 2005 at Heathrow Airport after returning to Britain from Austria. He admitted to five charges of the indecent assault of boys aged under 16 years of age, dating back to the 1970s and 1980s: he was convicted the following February and imprisoned for four years. Meanwhile, a European arrest warrant was issued in December 2007.

In 2008, he was extradited from Britain to Slovakia, where he was jailed in October for five years for producing child pornography. The offences in Slovakia dated back to 2002 and 2003. He had been briefly held in custody in Bratislava during 2004 following a search of his house, but then quickly left the country.

In June 2013, he was arrested in east London as part of Operation Yewtree, an investigation into sexual abuse. He was re-arrested and bailed out in September of that year. The allegations made against Denning were not part of those relating to Jimmy Savile. In May 2014, as a result of the investigation, he was charged with 41 sex offences. In August 2014, Denning admitted to 29 of the charges in relation to the offences committed against boys. In November at Southwark Crown Court, he pleaded guilty to a further eleven charges. In all, he pled guilty to 40 sexual offences committed in the period 1967 to 1987 relating to 26 male victims, the youngest of whom was 9 at the time of the offence. In December 2014, Judge Alistair McCreath sentenced him to 13 years in prison.

Denning was charged with six offences stemming from the Operation Ravine investigation on 7 June 2016. On 22 August 2016, Denning pleaded guilty to 21 sex offences between 1969 and 1986, against 11 boys, the youngest of whom was 8. At Southwark Crown Court on 7 October 2016, Judge Alistair McCreath sentenced Denning to another 13 years in prison for these additional offences, running from the day of the court hearing.

On 7 December 2017, Denning pleaded not guilty to two counts of indecent assault and one of taking indecent photos of a child between March 1979 and March 1981. His trial was due to start on 11 June 2018, but the charges were dropped on 13 June.

==Death==
Denning died while in prison custody in Bedford Hospital on 24 June 2022, as a result of a bone infection caused by diabetes. He was 81 years old. His death was not reported publicly until October 2023. The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman, which investigates deaths in prison custody, found that &quot;when clinical readings first showed that Mr Denning needed emergency care, he was not transferred to hospital for treatment&quot;.

<text>The Darwin–Wedgwood family are members of two connected families, each noted for particular prominent 18th-century figures: Erasmus Darwin, a physician and natural philosopher, and Josiah Wedgwood FRS, a noted potter and founder of the eponymous Josiah Wedgwood &amp; Sons pottery company. The Darwin and Wedgwood families were on friendly terms for much of their history and members intermarried, notably Charles Darwin, who married Emma Wedgwood.

The most notable member of the family was Charles Darwin, a grandson of both Erasmus Darwin and Josiah Wedgwood. The family also included at least ten Fellows of the Royal Society, and several artists and poets (among whom was the 20th-century composer Ralph Vaughan Williams). Presented below are brief biographical descriptions and genealogical information, and mentions of some notable descendants. (The individuals are listed by year of birth and grouped into generations.) The relationship to Francis Galton, and to his immediate ancestors, is also given. (Note, however, that the data tree below is not intended to include all descendants, nor is it intended to include all prominent descendants. Also note that Ursula Wood died in 2007, Richard Darwin Keynes died in 2010, and Horace Basil Barlow died in 2020.)

==The first generation==

===Josiah Wedgwood===

Josiah Wedgwood (1730–1795) was a noted pottery businessman and a friend of Erasmus Darwin. During 1780, on the death of his long-time business partner Thomas Bentley, Josiah asked Darwin for help in managing the business. As a result of the close association that grew up between the Wedgwood and Darwin families, one of Josiah&#x27;s daughters later married Erasmus&#x27;s son Robert. One of the children of that marriage, Charles Darwin, also married a Wedgwood – Emma Wedgwood, Josiah&#x27;s granddaughter. Robert&#x27;s inheritance of Josiah&#x27;s money enabled him to fund Charles Darwin&#x27;s chosen vocation in natural history that resulted in the inception of Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution. Subsequently, Emma&#x27;s inheritance made the Darwins a wealthy family.

Josiah Wedgwood married Sarah Wedgwood (1734–1815), and they had seven children, including:
* Susannah Wedgwood (1765–1817) (later Darwin; see below)
* Josiah Wedgwood (1769–1843) (see below)
* Thomas Wedgwood (1771–1805) (see below)
===Erasmus Darwin===

Erasmus Darwin (1731–1802) was a physician, botanist and poet from Lichfield, whose lengthy botanical poems gave insights into medicine and natural history, and described an evolutionist theory that anticipated both Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and his grandson Charles. He married twice, first during 1757 to Mary Howard (1740–1770), who died from alcohol-induced liver failure aged 30. She gave birth to:

* Charles Darwin (1758–1778) (not Charles Robert Darwin)

* Mary Parker (1774–1859)

He then became smitten with Elizabeth Collier Sacheveral-Pole, who was married to Colonel Sacheveral-Pole and was the natural daughter of the Charles Colyear, 2nd Earl of Portmore. Sacheveral-Pole died soon afterwards, and Erasmus married Elizabeth and they bore an additional seven children:

He married Susannah Wedgwood, daughter of Josiah Wedgwood (see above), and they had the following children.

==Intermarriage==
There was a notable history of intermarriage within the family. During the period being discussed, Josiah Wedgwood married his third cousin Sarah Wedgwood; Charles Darwin married his first cousin Emma Wedgwood; his sister, Caroline Darwin, married Emma&#x27;s brother (and Caroline&#x27;s first cousin), Josiah Wedgwood III. There were other instances of cousin marriage as well. Cousin marriage was not uncommon in Britain during the 19th century though why is debated: poorer communications, keeping wealth within the family, more opportunity of evaluating a relative of the opposite sex as a suitable marriage partner (unmarried young women of the upper and upper middle classes were closely chaperoned when meeting men outside the family during the 19th century), more security for the woman as she would not be leaving her family (though legal rights for married women increased during the century, as a rule her property became his and she had little legal recourse if he chose to abuse her).

==Coat of arms==
These arms were granted to Reginald Darwin, of Fern, Derbyshire, for himself and certain descendants of his father, Sir Francis Sacheverel Darwin, and his uncle Robert Waring Darwin (Father of Charles), on 6 March 1890. As Charles Darwin was part of the destination, they have been used in association with him, despite being granted after his death. Something similar is used by Darwin College, Cambridge.

A variant without mullets was being used by the Darwin family long before 1890. Erasmus Darwin used it with the motto &quot;E conchis omnia&quot; (All things out of shells), reflecting his belief that all life descended from one simple form. Charles&#x27; father Robert adopted the same motto, displaying it on his bookplate. Stephen Glover described in 1829 the older variant quartered with the Waring coat of arms (sable, a chevron between three storks&#x27; heads erased, argent).

<text>John Gatenby Bolton (5 June 1922 – 6 July 1993) was a British-Australian astronomer who was fundamental to the development of radio astronomy. In particular, Bolton was integral in establishing that discrete radio sources were either galaxies or the remnants of supernovae, rather than stars. He also played a significant role in the discovery of quasars and the centre of the Milky Way. Bolton served as the inaugural director of the Parkes radio telescope in Australia and established the Owens Valley Radio Observatory in California. Bolton&#x27;s students held directorships at most of the radio observatories in the world and one was a Nobel Prize winner. Bolton is considered a key figure in the development of astronomy in Australia.

==Early life==

John Gatenby Bolton was born in Sheffield, United Kingdom, in 1922 to two high school teachers. While suffering from various sicknesses in his youth, such as severe asthma and migraines, Bolton showed an early interest and proficiency in sports, mathematics, and science. He was awarded a scholarship to the secondary King Edward VII School, but his family was required to pay full fees since his father&#x27;s salary was above the threshold of the means-tested scholarship. At King Edward VII School, he was elected prefect and was awarded the school&#x27;s mathematics prize in his final year. His upbringing is considered middle-class for the 1920s and 1930s United Kingdom.

Bolton was awarded a place to study pure mathematics and natural philosophy at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1940, and two scholarships to cover his fees and living expenses. Due to World War 2, his degree was reduced from three to two years. In his second year, Bolton decided to focus on physics rather than mathematics. He completed his degree in May 1942 with second-class honours. While an average result for a student that had previously finished in top third of his cohort, his mother had deteriorated and died during Bolton&#x27;s examination period.

==World War 2 and radar work==

Bolton enlisted with the military after completing his final examinations, and chose the Navy due to his love of ships. He was commissioned as a sub-lieutenant in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve. While at officer training at HMNB Portsmouth he chose to do research and development of airborne radar.

Bolton&#x27;s experience of radar during World War 2 would establish key relationships and experiences that would heavily influence his future radio astronomy career. Bolton&#x27;s first war posting saw him responsible for two coastal radar stations and testing the latest radar sets in night fighters. At the end of 1942, Bolton was transferred to the Telecommunications Research Establishment, the headquarters of Britain&#x27;s wartime radar research and development. At this location he met many of what would be many of the leaders of the post-war radio astronomy efforts, including Martin Ryle.

At the Telecommunications Research Establishment, Bolton first worked on developing a new airborne radar system operating at a wavelength of 3 cm, which included extensive testing during flights. By the time of the D-day landing, Bolton had grown tired of inflight testing radar. He was offered a position as radio officer on the British light aircraft carrier . Such a position made Bolton responsible for all airborne electronics, ship-to-aircraft communications, and navigational aids. As a support ship, &quot;Unicorn&quot; had a reasonably safe war experience, with no major damage reported. Bolton&#x27;s experience on &quot;Unicorn&quot; is credited with developing his hands-on expertise with electronics and the ideas that would help him later to build a sea-cliff interferometer.

As World War 2 ended in 1945, shuttled cargo and personnel in the Pacific theatre back to Australia. When &quot;Unicorn&quot; returned to Britain in December 1945, Bolton decided to remain in Sydney. The choice to make Australia his new home was largely due to the positive influence the climate had on his health but also because his application to enrol in postgraduate studies at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University had been rejected. His abbreviated wartime undergraduate degree was deemed inadequate training for postgraduate study by the head of the Cavendish Laboratory, Lawrence Bragg.

==CSIR, Cygnus, and the sea-cliff interferometer==

After leaving the Navy, Bolton searched for a job through his Navy connections in Australia. Through one government official associated with finding work for veterans, an appointment was made for Bolton to meet Taffy Bowen, the head of Radiophysics Laboratory of CSIR. Bolton was soon appointed to the new research officer position, with duties of `research and development in connection with the application of radar techniques&#x27;. The expertise in radar technology by the Radiophysics Laboratory was world-class at the time, largely because Britain had shared the secret of radar with its Dominions as World War 2 began and due to a relatively large Australian radio physics community that had intimate ties with the ionospheric physicists in England.

Bolton was first assigned to measure the polarisation properties of sunspot radiations, an area of active investigation as the Sun was recently confirmed to be radio bright during World War 2. Bolton built two Yagi antennas and installed them at Dover Heights, Sydney. However, the Sun had entered a dormant period, with no sunspots on its surface. Having learnt of the discovery of radio emission from the plane of the Milky Way during his time at Cambridge University, and from observations onboard , Bolton speculated that there might be other radio bright stars like the Sun.

Following his intuition, Bolton and his colleague Bruce Slee pointed the two Yagi antennas towards the horizon and used the instruments as a sea-cliff interferometer to gain greater resolution than possible by using the antennas by themselves. Such a decision led to direct conflict with Bolton&#x27;s boss Joe Pawsey, who reassigned Bolton to help design Yagi antennas for a potential Solar eclipse expedition after finding the antennas not pointing at the Sun. However, the expedition collapsed and Bolton was again ordered to observe the Sun with the new equipment during the day, but was permitted to use the equipment at night to investigate other potential radio sources.

Through discussions with Pawsey, Bolton learnt there had been conflicting reports about a radio source in the constellation of Cygnus reported by Stanley Hey. With Gordon Stanley, the pair completed a shallow survey of the southern sky with the sea-cliff interferometer. They confirmed the existence of the bright Cygnus source, later named Cygnus A, but at a position substantially different than that reported by Hey, and two weaker sources near the constellation Centaurus and at the edge of Cygnus. It was also during these nighttime observing runs that Bolton largely self-taught himself astrophysics using recent publications in The Astrophysical Journal.

With the sea-cliff interferometer, Bolton and Stanley achieved a resolution greater than 15 times than that of Hey&#x27;s observations. They could be confident that the radio emission in Cygnus came from an area less than 8&#x27;. While Hey is credited with the discovery of the first radio &#x27;star&#x27;, Bolton&#x27;s result confirmed Hey&#x27;s conclusion that the source had to be compact. In tandem, these results represented the beginning of the science associated with discrete radio sources. Further observations produced a refined position for Cygnus A but no convincing optical counterpart, such as a bright star, was found.

==Radio stars==

Following the Cygnus result, Bolton, Stanley, and Slee set about systematically surveying the sky with an improved sea-cliff interferometer for other discrete radio sources. By February 1948, Bolton had evidence of six new discrete radio sources, and introduced the nomenclature of referring to the radio sources in a constellation alphabetically descending in brightness. This nomenclature is still in use in radio astronomy today for some of the brightest radio sources. Bolton showed that Cygnus A was not unique - either in its existence or in its lack of association with bright optical stellar counterparts. He had identified such famous radio sources as Taurus A, Centaurus A, and Hercules A.

Despite the expectation that acclaim would soon follow the revelations of a new class of objects previously unknown to astronomers, the astronomy community generally responded with skepticism due to the poor positional uncertainties and because the implications did not easily fit within the orthodox astronomical knowledge of the time. Furthermore, the amount of resources Bolton was occupying at the Radiophysics Lab for his discrete source investigation was leading to direct conflict with the Solar investigation team, in particular with Ruby Payne-Scott.

In the effort to improve the impact of his results on discrete radio sources, Bolton chose to refine his source positions and eliminate any systematic uncertainties. Bolton and Stanley did this via an expedition to New Zealand, conducting sea-cliff interferometric observations from both New Zealand and Australia. These observations corrected the positions of the sources in the 1948 paper by over 1 degree. With 10 arcminute precision and a better handle on systematic uncertainties due to ionospheric refraction, Bolton could now reasonably suggest optical counterparts. While the optical candidate of Cygnus A remained elusive, Bolton showed that Taurus A was associated with the peculiar Crab Nebula, Virgo A with a galaxy that emanated a long jet-like structure (M87), and Centaurus A with such a peculiar object that astronomers were contemporarily arguing about whether it belonged to the Milky Way or not.

While Bolton was wrong in suggesting Centaurus A and Virgo A were peculiar Galactic sources, Bolton changed his opinion within months of the paper&#x27;s publication as new optical data was analysed. The results of the 1949 paper gained the interest of traditional optical astronomers and is often considered the beginning of extragalactic radio astronomy. The 1949 paper was likely the most important and impactful paper produced in Bolton&#x27;s career.

On the basis of his recent academic success, Bolton did a tour of the key astronomy and radio engineering labs of the Northern Hemisphere in 1950. He was met with a frosty reception at the Cavendish by Martin Ryle and Lawrence Bragg, who were having too many guests visiting the lab at the time. However, during his Cambridge visit Bolton got to know the astrophysicist Fred Hoyle, which started a lifelong friendship and collaboration.

After returning from his trip, Bolton decided sea-cliff interferometry had reached its limit in terms of discovery, and decided to emulate the 220-ft parabolic aerial used by the Jodrell Bank group. At Dover Heights, New South Wales, they built a 72-ft parabolic dish into the soil. Using this instrument in 1953, Bolton and new CSIRO recruit Dick McGee surveyed the Galactic Plane, identifying the centre of the Milky Way - Sagittarius A.

Despite Bolton&#x27;s academic success, Radio Astrophysics could only afford to build one large telescope in the 1950s. While Bolton insisted on building a larger dish modeled on his Dover Heights prototype, the laboratory favoured the Mills Cross radio interferometer. This decision led Bolton to direct conflict with his immediate boss Pawsey, after which he was reassigned by Bowen to the Cloud Physics division of Radio Astrophysics. This allowed Bowen to alleviate the conflict and provided the expertise of Bolton to his Cloud Physics group.

During Bolton&#x27;s detour away from radio astronomy, he worked on understanding how to seed rainfall using silver iodide smoke jettisoned from aircraft. However, Bolton was aware during his brief stint in Cloud physics of the potential opportunity to start the radio astronomy group being established in California. Bolton accepted the position to set up a large radio telescope near Caltech offered by Lee Alvin DuBridge in 1954.

==Caltech and Owens Valley==

On joining Caltech as head of the radio astronomy program, Bolton set about establishing an American radio observatory using funds from the Office of Naval Research and Caltech. Along with Gordon Stanley, Bolton identified Owens Valley as an ideal site for a radio observatory because its natural mountain ranges shielded interference from coastal Californian cities and since it was reasonably close to Caltech. Bolton&#x27;s priority for the type of instrument to build at Owens Valley was one that could accurately localise the position of sources to find their optical counterparts and resolve their radio structure, building on the many poor resolution detections coming from such instruments as the Mills Cross.

Bolton led the building of a two-element interferometer, composed of two 90-foot antennas. This instrument would go on to be incredibly scientifically productive, the test-bed for many leading American radio astronomers, and a prototype for the Very Large Array. One of the first scientific contributions from the Owens Valley telescopes was confirmation of radio emission from Jupiter, which gained significant media and institutional recognition for the instrument. With the successful building of the Owens Valley interferometer, Bolton was promoted to full-professor. He was also awarded a PhD from Caltech, but he refused to use the title throughout his life and referred to it as a &quot;de facto&quot; PhD.

The superior resolution of the Owens Valley interferometer meant Bolton and his team were beginning to identify radio sources that still remained unresolved at 10 arcsecond resolution. Following up one of these sources in the optical, 3C295, identified the counterpart as a galaxy at a redshift of 0.46, more than doubling the distance to an object in the Universe. This line of science reasoning set the course for Bolton&#x27;s career as he returned to Australia.

Despite his successes at Caltech, Bolton had an understanding with Bowen that he would return to Australia when a giant radio telescope was being built. Along with poor health caused by the low air quality in Pasadena smog, Bolton and his family decided to return to Australia in 1960.

==Parkes and quasars==

Bolton arrived in Parkes, Australia as the development of the new Giant Radio Telescope was underway. Bowen had procured money from the Carnegie Institution for Science, Rockefeller Foundation, and the Australian government to develop a 64 m dish. Bolton had already played an important role in helping assess the design of the telescope, and now took ownership of construction and commission of the Parkes dish. He was also to be the inaugural director of the telescope.

The Parkes radio telescope, under guidance of Bolton, was completed on schedule and quickly contributed to two key radio astronomy results. Firstly, the telescope confirmed polarised radio emission from Centaurus A and Vela X. Detection of linear polarisation was confirmation that the radio emission from such sources is produced by the synchrotron mechanism. Secondly, and more importantly, Parkes detected Faraday rotation in polarised radio sources. This was the first astrophysical detection of the phenomenon and a result which was used as conclusive evidence that the Milky Way possessed a magnetic field.

While Bolton played a key role in the scientific direction of Parkes in these first two discoveries, his greatest scientific contribution with Parkes came with the discovery of quasars. Building on his work identifying optical sources to radio galaxies at Caltech, such as 3C48, accumulating evidence suggested there existed a unique class of active galaxies that were 100 times brighter optically than the most luminous galaxies which had been identified previously with radio sources. While not published, Bolton was first to correctly identify the extreme distance to 3C48 two years before it was published in 1962. The record to the most distant object in the Universe was regularly held by quasars discovered at Parkes by Bolton and his team.

After the discovery of the first quasars at Parkes, Bolton settled into the project that would occupy most of his time for the rest of the 1960s: surveying the southern sky with Parkes as to find new radio sources to associate to optical sources and determining their distances. He managed to follow this science path due to strong ties with optical astronomers at Palomar and Lick Observatories. At this career stage, Bolton was also being commissioned to chair government panels and present keynote lectures - with the pinnacle presenting the talk at the Solvay conference in 1964. In the 1960s, Bolton was also elected a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science and was the inaugural NRAO Karl Jansky prize holder.

==Parkes and the Apollo 11 Moon Landing==

As director of Parkes, Bolton also played a part in the Apollo 11 Moon landing. NASA suggested to CSIRO for Parkes to join the Deep Space Network and be in directly involved with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Bolton was keen to join this effort as he thought Parkes had a debt to NASA and the US for their help in construction and the numerous personal relationships he had developed there.

NASA&#x27;s initial request was for Parkes to provide back-up in case the Apollo 11 moonwalk was delayed or in case of any failures in NASA&#x27;s own tracking stations. Bolton and the Parkes technical crew took responsibility for ensuring the telescope&#x27;s drive and control systems were in working order. Due to changes in the moonwalk schedule, NASA received TV signals from three sources - Goldstone, Honeysuckle Creek, and Parkes. NASA switched between Goldstone and Honeysuckle for the first few minutes of the moonwalk but the signal from Parkes was used for the reminder of the moonwalk. The role Parkes and Bolton played in the Apollo 11 Moon landing was dramatised in the 2000 film &quot;The Dish&quot;. Bolton would ensure Parkes would be involved in tracking for all the Apollo missions.

==Later years at Parkes and awards==

Bolton stepped down as Parkes director in 1971 to ease his administrative workload. While stepping down as director, Bolton continued pursuing science. For the remainder of his scientific career, he would focus on optical identifications of radio sources that were being surveyed by Parkes at 2.7 GHz. One significant result from this survey, when combined with previous low-frequency surveys, was Bolton&#x27;s discovery of the peaked-spectrum source PKS B1934-638.

Bolton was elected to the Royal Society of London and vice-president of the International Astronomical Union in 1973. Furthermore, he was awarded the Royal Astronomical Society Gold Medal in 1977 for his contributions to optical and radio astronomy. After a series of heart attacks, Bolton passed away in 1993.

<doc id="840450" wikidata="Q886843" url="?curid=840450" title="Cerebral circulation">
<text>Cerebral circulation is the movement of blood through a network of cerebral arteries and veins supplying the brain. The rate of cerebral blood flow in an adult human is typically 750 milliliters per minute, or about 15% of cardiac output. Arteries deliver oxygenated blood, glucose and other nutrients to the brain. Veins carry &quot;used or spent&quot; blood back to the heart, to remove carbon dioxide, lactic acid, and other metabolic products. The neurovascular unit regulates cerebral blood flow so that activated neurons can be supplied with energy in the right amount and at the right time. Because the brain would quickly suffer damage from any stoppage in blood supply, the cerebral circulatory system has safeguards including autoregulation of the blood vessels. The failure of these safeguards may result in a stroke. The volume of blood in circulation is called the cerebral blood flow. Sudden intense accelerations change the gravitational forces perceived by bodies and can severely impair cerebral circulation and normal functions to the point of becoming serious life-threatening conditions.

The following description is based on idealized human cerebral circulation. The pattern of circulation and its nomenclature vary between organisms.

== Anatomy ==
=== Blood supply ===

Blood supply to the brain is normally divided into anterior and posterior segments, relating to the different arteries that supply the brain. The two main pairs of arteries are the internal carotid arteries (supply the anterior brain) and vertebral arteries (supplying the brainstem and posterior brain). The anterior and posterior cerebral circulations are interconnected via bilateral posterior communicating arteries. They are part of the circle of Willis, which provides backup circulation to the brain. In case one of the supply arteries is occluded, the circle of Willis provides interconnections between the anterior and the posterior cerebral circulation along the floor of the cerebral vault, providing blood to tissues that would otherwise become ischemic.

==== Anterior cerebral circulation ====
The anterior cerebral circulation is the blood supply to the anterior portion of the brain including eyes. It is supplied by the following arteries:
* Internal carotid arteries: These large arteries are the medial branches of the common carotid arteries which enter the skull, as opposed to the external carotid branches which supply the facial tissues; the internal carotid artery branches into the anterior cerebral artery and continues to form the middle cerebral artery.
* Anterior cerebral artery (ACA)
** Anterior communicating artery: Connects both anterior cerebral arteries, within and along the floor of the cerebral vault.
* Middle cerebral artery (MCA)

==== Posterior cerebral circulation ====
The posterior cerebral circulation is the blood supply to the posterior portion of the brain, including the occipital lobes, cerebellum and brainstem.
It is supplied by the following arteries:
* Vertebral arteries: These smaller arteries branch from the subclavian arteries which primarily supply the shoulders, lateral chest, and arms. Within the cranium the two vertebral arteries fuse into the basilar artery.
** Posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA)
* Basilar artery: Supplies the midbrain, cerebellum, and usually branches into the posterior cerebral artery
** Anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA)
** Pontine branches
** Superior cerebellar artery (SCA)
* Posterior cerebral artery (PCA)
* Posterior communicating artery

===Venous drainage===
The venous drainage of the cerebrum can be separated into two subdivisions: superficial and deep.

;The superficial system
The superficial system is composed of dural venous sinuses, sinuses (channels) within the dura mater. The dural sinuses are therefore located on the surface of the cerebrum. The most prominent of these sinuses is the superior sagittal sinus which is located in the sagittal plane under the midline of the cerebral vault, posteriorly and inferiorly to the confluence of sinuses, where the superficial drainage joins with the sinus that primarily drains the deep venous system. From here, two transverse sinuses bifurcate and travel laterally and inferiorly in an S-shaped curve that forms the sigmoid sinuses which go on to form the two jugular veins. In the neck, the jugular veins parallel the upward course of the carotid arteries and drain blood into the superior vena cava. The veins puncture the relevant dural sinus, piercing the arachnoid and dura mater as bridging veins that drain their contents into the sinus.

;The deep venous system
The deep venous system is primarily composed of traditional veins inside the deep structures of the brain, which join behind the midbrain to form the great cerebral vein (vein of Galen). This vein merges with the inferior sagittal sinus to form the straight sinus which then joins the superficial venous system mentioned above at the confluence of sinuses.

== Maturation of cerebral blood vessels ==
The maturation of blood vessels in the brain is a critical process that occurs postnatally. It involves the acquisition of key barrier and contractile properties essential for brain function. During the early postnatal phase, endothelial cells (ECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) undergo significant molecular and functional changes.

Endothelial cells begin to express P-glycoprotein, a crucial efflux transporter that helps protect the brain by expelling harmful substances. This efflux capacity is progressively acquired and becomes fully functional by the postnatal period. Additionally, VSMCs, which initially populate the arterial network, start to express contractile proteins such as smooth muscle actin (SMA) and myosin-11, transforming VSMCs into contractile cells capable of regulating blood vessel tone and cerebral blood flow.

The expression of Myh11 in VSMCs acts as a developmental switch, with significant upregulation occurring from birth to the age of 2 to 5 years. This is a critical period needed for the establishment of vessel contractility and the overall functionality of the cerebral circulation.

==Physiology==
Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is the blood supply to the brain in a given period of time. In an adult, CBF is typically 750 millilitres per minute or 15.8 ± 5.7% of the cardiac output. This equates to an average perfusion of 50 to 54 millilitres of blood per 100 grams of brain tissue per minute.

The ratio index of cerebral blood flow/cardiac output (CCRI) decreases by 1.3% per decade, even though cardiac output remains unchanged. Across the adult lifespan, women have a higher CCRI than men. CBF is inversely associated with body mass index.

CBF is tightly regulated to meet the brain&#x27;s metabolic demands. Too much blood (a clinical condition of a normal homeostatic response of hyperemia) can raise intracranial pressure (ICP), which can compress and damage delicate brain tissue. Too little blood flow (ischemia) results if blood flow to the brain is below 18 to 20 ml per 100 g per minute, and tissue death occurs if flow dips below 8 to 10 ml per 100 g per minute. In brain tissue, a biochemical cascade known as the ischemic cascade is triggered when the tissue becomes ischemic, potentially resulting in damage to and the death of brain cells. Medical professionals must take steps to maintain proper CBF in patients who have conditions like shock, stroke, cerebral edema, and traumatic brain injury.

Cerebral blood flow is determined by a number of factors, such as viscosity of blood, how dilated blood vessels are, and the net pressure of the flow of blood into the brain, known as cerebral perfusion pressure, which is determined by the body&#x27;s blood pressure. Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is defined as the mean arterial pressure (MAP) minus the intracranial pressure (ICP). In normal individuals, it should be above 50 mm Hg. Intracranial pressure should not be above 15 mm Hg (ICP of 20 mm Hg is considered as intracranial hypertension). Cerebral blood vessels are able to change the flow of blood through them by altering their diameters in a process called cerebral autoregulation; they constrict when systemic blood pressure is raised and dilate when it is lowered. Arterioles also constrict and dilate in response to different chemical concentrations. For example, they dilate in response to higher levels of carbon dioxide in the blood and constrict in response to lower levels of carbon dioxide.

For example, assuming a person with an arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 40 mmHg (normal range of 38–42 mmHg) and a CBF of 50 ml per 100g per min. If the PaCO2 dips to 30 mmHg, this represents a 10 mmHg decrease from the initial value of PaCO2. Consequently, the CBF decreases by 1ml per 100g per min for each 1mmHg decrease in PaCO2, resulting in a new CBF of 40ml per 100g of brain tissue per minute. In fact, for each 1 mmHg increase or decrease in PaCO2, between the range of 20–60 mmHg, there is a corresponding CBF change in the same direction of approximately 1–2 ml/100g/min, or 2–5% of the CBF value. This is why small alterations in respiration pattern can cause significant changes in global CBF, specially through PaCO2 variations.

CBF is equal to the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) divided by the cerebrovascular resistance (CVR):

:CBF = CPP / CVR

Control of CBF is considered in terms of the factors affecting CPP and the factors affecting CVR. CVR is controlled by four major mechanisms:
# Metabolic control (or &#x27;metabolic autoregulation&#x27;)
# Pressure autoregulation
# Chemical control (by arterial pCO2 and pO2)
# Neural control

===Role of intracranial pressure===

Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) causes decreased blood perfusion of brain cells by mainly two mechanisms:
* Increased ICP constitutes an increased interstitial hydrostatic pressure that, in turn, causes a decreased driving force for capillary filtration from intracerebral blood vessels.
* Increased ICP compresses cerebral arteries, causing increased cerebrovascular resistance (CVR).

===Cerebral perfusion pressure===

Cerebral perfusion pressure is the net pressure gradient causing cerebral blood flow to the brain (brain perfusion). It must be maintained within narrow limits; too little pressure could cause brain tissue to become ischemic (having inadequate blood flow), and too much could raise intracranial pressure.

=== Imaging ===
Arterial spin labeling (ASL), phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) are neuroimaging techniques that can be used to measure CBF. ASL and PET can also be used to measure regional CBF (rCBF) within a specific brain region.
rCBF at one location can be measured over time by thermal diffusion

<doc id="840451" wikidata="Q1417175" url="?curid=840451" title="JScript .NET">
<text>JScript .NET is a .NET programming language developed by Microsoft.

The primary differences between JScript and JScript .NET can be summarized as follows:

Firstly, JScript is a scripting language, and as such programs (or more suggestively, scripts) can be executed without the need to compile the code first. This is not the case with the JScript .NET command-line compiler, since this next-generation version relies on the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) for execution, which requires that the code be compiled to Common Intermediate Language (CIL), formerly called Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL), code before it can be run. Nevertheless, JScript .NET still provides full support for interpreting code at runtime (e.g., via the codice_1 constructor or the codice_2 function) and indeed the interpreter can be exposed by custom applications hosting the JScript .NET engine via the VSA interfaces.

Secondly, JScript has a strong foundation in Microsoft&#x27;s ActiveX/COM technologies, and relies primarily on ActiveX components to provide much of its functionality (including database access via ADO, file handling, etc.), whereas JScript .NET uses the .NET Framework to provide equivalent functionality. For backwards-compatibility (or for where no .NET equivalent library exists), JScript .NET still provides full access to ActiveX objects via .NET / COM Interop using both the ActiveXObject constructor and the standard methods of the .NET Type class.

Although the .NET Framework and .NET languages such as C# and Visual Basic .NET have seen widespread adoption, JScript .NET has never received much attention, by the media or by developers. It is not supported in Microsoft&#x27;s premier development tool, Visual Studio .NET. However, ASP.NET supports JScript .NET.

== Language differences ==
The following are prime examples of language differences between JScript .NET and other .NET languages, including comparisons.

=== Differences with C# ===
* JScript .NET does not require a main() function that the operating system must call directly when executing a JScript .NET application, as such, JScript .NET program flow can be based on global code.
* JScript .NET, because of its very loose type checking system can be very easy to learn, since the convention of explicit type declaration is not required at all.
* JScript .NET does not require explicit references to the .NET Framework Base Class Library, as certain functions found in earlier versions of JScript are present in JScript .NET (e.g. functions for finding the tangent of an angle for a right triangle).
* JScript .NET is closely linked to C syntax, and is thus very easy to learn for C#, Java or C++ developers.
* While JScript .NET can be used to create Windows Forms applications, JScript .NET will have some trouble, as delegates can only be consumed in JScript .NET and not created. Thus, custom events are hard to emulate in JScript .NET.

=== Differences with C++ ===
* JScript .NET does not require a main() function.
* JScript .NET does not require explicit type declaration on variables. (In C++, the use of templates and generics can be compared to this, loosely emulated with template specialization, etc.)
* JScript .NET also does not require explicit type casts on variable use in the program. Code used to retrieve a string of characters, but only used for integer numbers can be cast implicitly; the vice versa can be done without error at compile time, but there is a chance of loss of precision or data.
e.g.:

import System;

Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello, what&#x27;s your name?&quot;);
Console.WriteLine(&quot;Type your name: &quot;);

var _name = Console.ReadLine();

Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello, &quot; + _name);
=== Differences with Java ===
* JScript .NET syntax and lexical conventions are similar to Java in that both are derived from C. JScript was originally Microsoft&#x27;s implementation of ECMAScript, which is more commonly known as JavaScript, though it is unrelated to Java. Thus, users of Java and other C-derived languages will find JScript easier to learn.
* JScript .NET allows developers to use untyped variables, and can sometimes infer their type from their usage to optimize the compiled code. On the other hand, Java requires all variables to be typed.
* JScript .NET can add properties and methods to objects in run-time, while Java objects always conform to their declared interface.
* JScript .NET supports global variables, something Java does not.

=== Differences with older versions of JScript ===
* JScript .NET allows developers to declare variables and functions with type information (e.g., var x : String;), while type information for JScript&#x27;s variables and functions can not be declared (e.g., var x;).
* JScript .NET scripts are not interpreted, but executed independently. When executed, a JScript .NET application will invoke the CLR. The CLR will execute the CIL instructions without using an interpreter.
* JScript .NET can be run without the presence of a browser or another scripting engine as the compiler can generate standalone executables and assemblies. However these still require .NET Framework to be installed in order to run.
* JScript .NET provides access to the .NET Framework BCL (Base Class Library), providing much more functionality.
* JScript .NET is only available as a scripting language for ASP.NET, the technology used to generate web pages; thus, JScript .NET takes a similar role to PHP and other server-side scripting languages. Internet Explorer, however, is still using only the older JScript engine, so JScript.NET cannot be used to script web pages (or HTAs or HTCs). In this regard, JScript is much more versatile than JScript .NET.

<doc id="840453" wikidata="Q861247" url="?curid=840453" title="3,000-hit club">
<text>The 3,000-hit club is the group of 33 batters who have collected 3,000 or more regular-season hits in their careers in Major League Baseball (MLB). Reaching 3,000 hits has been &quot;long considered the greatest measure of superior bat handling&quot; and is often described as a guarantee of eventual entry into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Cap Anson was the first MLB player to reach 3,000 hits, although his precise career hit total is unclear. Two players—Nap Lajoie and Honus Wagner—reached 3,000 hits during the 1914 season. Ty Cobb did so in 1921 and became the first player in MLB history to reach 4,000 hits in 1927, ultimately finishing his career with 4,191. Pete Rose, the current hit leader, became the second player to reach 4,000 hits on April 13, 1984, and surpassed Cobb in September 1985, finishing his career with 4,256. Roberto Clemente&#x27;s career ended with precisely 3,000 hits, which he reached in the last at bat of his career on September 30, 1972.

Of the 33 members, 18 were right-handed batters, 13 were left-handed, and two were switch hitters. The Cleveland Guardians and Detroit Tigers are the only franchises to have three players reach 3,000 hits while on their roster: for Cleveland, Lajoie, while the team was the Naps, Tris Speaker, and most recently Eddie Murray, both when the franchise was known as the Indians, and, for the Tigers, Cobb, Al Kaline, and most recently Miguel Cabrera. Ten of these players have played for only one major league team. Seven players—Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, Eddie Murray, Rafael Palmeiro, Albert Pujols, Alex Rodriguez, and Miguel Cabrera—are also members of the 500 home run club. Cobb holds the highest career batting average at .366, while Cal Ripken Jr. holds the lowest at .276. Derek Jeter, Wade Boggs, and Alex Rodriguez are the only players to hit a home run for their 3,000th hit, and Paul Molitor and Ichiro Suzuki are the only players to hit a triple for their 3,000th; all others hit a single or double. Stan Musial was the first to collect an extra-base hit for his 3,000th hit, and is also the only one to have done so as a pinch-hitter. Craig Biggio is the only player to be thrown out for his 3,000th hit, while attempting to stretch the hit into a double. Biggio and Jeter are the only players whose 3,000th hit came in a game where they had five hits; Jeter reached base safely in all of his at bats. The most recent player to reach 3,000 hits is Cabrera, who did so on April 23, 2022, while playing for the Detroit Tigers.

All eligible players with 3,000 or more career hits have been elected to the Hall except Palmeiro and Rodriguez, whose careers have been tainted by steroid allegations, and since 1962 all except Biggio were elected on the first ballot. Rose is ineligible for the Hall of Fame because he was permanently banned from baseball in 1989. After four years on the ballot, Palmeiro failed to be named on 5% of ballots in 2014, after which his name was removed from the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America ballots, although it is possible that the Veterans Committee could select him. Rodriguez garnered 34.3% of the vote during his first year of eligibility in 2022. Pujols and Cabrera are not yet eligible, as a player must be retired for 5 years or have been dead for 6 months to be considered for the Hall of Fame. Twenty-one different teams have had a player reach 3,000 hits.

<text>Fyodor Aleksandrovich Bredikhin (, 8 December O.S. 26 November] 1831 – 14 May [O.S. 1 May] 1904) was a Russian astronomer. His surname is sometimes given as Bredichin in the literature, and non-Russian sources sometimes render his first name as Theodor.

==Career==

In 1857 he joined the staff of the observatory at Moscow University, becoming its director in 1873. In 1890 he became director of Pulkovo Observatory (until 1894) and in the same year became a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

He studied the theory of comet tails, and also studied meteors and meteor showers.

== Legacy ==
The asteroid 786 Bredichina and the crater Bredikhin on the Moon are named after him. The is awarded by the Russian Academy of Sciences.

<doc id="840460" wikidata="Q1931595" url="?curid=840460" title="Microsoft Message Queuing">
<text>Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) is a message queue implementation developed by Microsoft and deployed in its Windows Server operating systems since Windows NT 4 and Windows 95. Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10 also includes this component. In addition to its mainstream server platform support, MSMQ has been incorporated into Microsoft Embedded platforms since 1999 and the release of Windows CE 3.0.

==Overview==

MSMQ is a messaging protocol that allows applications running on separate servers/processes to communicate in a failsafe manner. A queue is a temporary storage location from which messages can be sent and received reliably, as and when conditions permit. This enables communication across networks and between computers, running Windows, which may not always be connected. By contrast, sockets and other network protocols assume that direct connections always exist.

MSMQ has been available to developers on Microsoft platforms since 1997, and has commonly been used in enterprise software built with Visual Studio, both in the native pre-.NET incarnation (version 5 and 6), and in Visual Studio .NET. Microsoft also has incorporated MSMQ in its messaging technology framework, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF). Under WCF, MSMQ can be used for providing secure, reliable transport with a unified programming model compatible with other communications standards.

MSMQ is responsible for reliably delivering messages between applications inside and outside the enterprise. MSMQ ensures reliable delivery by placing messages that fail to reach their intended destination in a queue and then resending them once the destination is reachable. It also supports security and priority based messaging. Dead letter queues can be created for looking at messages which timed out or failed for other reasons.

MSMQ supports both durable and non-durable messaging to make a trade off between performance or consistency by writing messages to disk or only in RAM. Non-durable messaging can only be achieved by sending express messages via non-transactional queues.

MSMQ also supports transactions. It permits multiple operations on multiple queues, with all of the operations wrapped in a single transaction, thus ensuring that either all or none of the operations will take effect. Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC) supports transactional access to MSMQ and other resources to achieve transactional exact once processing.

The following ports are used for Microsoft Message Queuing operations:
* TCP: 1801
* RPC: 135, 2101*, 2103*, 2105*
* UDP: 3527, 1801
* * These port numbers may be incremented by 11 if the initial choice of RPC port is being used when Message Queuing initializes. Port 135 is queried to discover the 2xxx ports.

==Version references==
* Version 1.0 (May 1997). Supports Windows 95, Windows NT 4.0 SP3, Windows 98 and Windows Me. 
* Version 2.0, included with Windows 2000.
** New features include: Support for registering public message queues in Active Directory, 128-bit encryption and digital certificate support, full COM support for message properties (achieving functional parity with the Win32 API function calls, full DNS path name support, improved performance in multi-threaded applications.
* Version 3.0, included with Windows XP (Professional, not Home Edition) and Windows Server 2003.
** New features include: Internet Messaging (referencing queues via HTTP, SOAP-formatted messages, MSMQ support for Internet Information Services), queue aliases, multicasting of messages, and additional support for programmatic maintenance and administration of queues and MSMQ itself.
* Version 4.0, part of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.
** New features include: Subqueues, improved support for &quot;poison messages&quot; (messages which continually fail to be processed correctly by the receiver), and support for transactional receives of messages from a remote queue.
* Version 5.0, part of Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.
** New features include: support for Secure Hash Algorithm 2.0 (SHA2) and all advanced hash algorithms that are supported in Windows 2008 R2; by default, weaker hash algorithms are disabled.
* Version 6.0, part of Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012.
* Version 6.3, part of Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2.

== Uses ==

<doc id="840472" wikidata="Q36582" url="?curid=840472" title="Palaic language">
<text>Palaic is an extinct Indo-European language, attested in cuneiform tablets in Bronze Age Hattusa, the capital of the Hittites. Palaic, which was apparently spoken mainly in northern Anatolia, is generally considered to be one of four primary sub-divisions of the Anatolian languages, alongside Hittite (central Anatolia), Luwic (southern Anatolia) and Lydian (western Anatolia).

Its name in Hittite is &quot;palaumnili&quot;, or &quot;of the people of Pala&quot;; Pala was probably to the northwest of the Hittite core area, so in the northwest of present mainland Turkey. The region was overrun by the Kaskians in the 15th century BC, and the language likely went out of daily use at that time.

== Sources ==
The entire corpus of Palaic spans only CTH 751-754 in Emmanuel Laroche&#x27;s catalog of Hittite texts; in addition Hittite texts elsewhere cite passages in Palaic in reference to the weather god Zaparwa (Hittite Ziparwa), the leading god of the land of Pala. In particular, CTH 750, a festival in Hittite for Ziparwa and associated deities, includes passages stating, &quot;The Old Woman speaks the words of the bread in Palaic,&quot; or alternately &quot;the words of the meal,&quot; though no Palaic passages are quoted. The Palaic-language texts are all from a religious context, with ritual and mythological content. In addition to Zaparwa, the Palaumnili-speakers worshipped a sun deity Tiyaz (Luwian Tiwaz), the Hattian goddess Kataḫzip/wuri, and several others.

== Phonology ==

Melchert reconstructs the following phonemic inventory for Palaic: However, Melchert claims that, instead of pharyngeals, &quot;a pair of velar fricatives is equally possible&quot;.

=== Consonants === 

=== Vowels === 

The phonemic status of /e/ and /eː/ is uncertain.

== Morphology ==
In terms of its morphology, Palaic is a fairly typical specimen of Indo-European. Palaic shared common innovations with Luwian not present in Old Hittite, suggesting a prior Luwian-Palaic linguistic complex. It has been characterized as &quot;more conservative than Hittite&quot; and heavily influenced by the Hattic language, though caution is prescribed for the latter assertion given the paucity of available materials.

=== Noun ===

Palaic shows the same gender distinction as seen in Hittite, i.e. animate vs. inanimate. It distinguishes two numbers, singular and plural, and at least six cases: nominative, vocative, accusative, genitive, dative, and locative.

Old Hittite has the genitive singular suffix &quot;-aš&quot; circa 1600 BC (compare Proto-Indo-European &quot;*-os&quot;); where Cuneiform Luwian instead uses the &quot;-ašša/i-&quot; adjectival suffix. Palaic, on the northern border of both, like later Hieroglyphic Luwian has both an &quot;-aš&quot; genitive and an &quot;-aša-&quot; adjectival suffix. 

Palaic also has similar pronoun forms to Old Hittite. 

=== Verb ===

The verb in Palaic is inflected for number (singular and plural), person, tense (present and preterite), and mood (indicative and imperative). It also has two voices, active and medio-passive.

Palaic is considered to have had a &quot;high number of attestations of the suffix -ina,&quot; all of which were transitive.

<text>Curtis Edward Gowdy (July 31, 1919 – February 20, 2006) was an American sportscaster. He called Boston Red Sox games on radio and TV for 15 years, and then covered many nationally televised sporting events, primarily for NBC Sports and ABC Sports in the 1960s and 1970s. He coined the nickname &quot;The Granddaddy of Them All&quot; for the Rose Bowl Game, taking the moniker from Cheyenne Frontier Days in his native Wyoming.

==Early years==
The son of Ruth and Edward &quot;Jack&quot; Gowdy (Curt&#x27;s father was a manager and dispatcher for the Union Pacific railroad ), Curtis Edward (Curt) Gowdy was born in Green River, Wyoming, and moved to Cheyenne at age six. As a high school basketball player in the 1930s, he led the state in scoring. He also showed an early interest in journalism, serving as sports editor of his high school newspaper. He enrolled at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, where he was a 5&#x27;9&quot; (175 cm) starter on the basketball team and played varsity tennis, lettering three years in both sports for the Cowboys. He was also a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity.

After graduating in 1942 with a degree in business statistics, he entered the army, where he was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant. Gowdy planned to become a fighter pilot, but a ruptured disk in his spine from a previous sports injury cut short his military service in the Army Air Force, leading to a medical discharge in 1943. Gowdy would continue to suffer from persistent back problems for many years.

In November 1943, recovering from back surgery, Gowdy made his broadcasting debut in Cheyenne calling a &quot;six-man&quot; high school football game from atop a wooden grocery crate in subzero weather, with about 15 people in attendance. He found he had a knack for broadcasting, and worked at the small KFBC radio station and at the &quot;Wyoming Eagle&quot; newspaper as a sportswriter (and later sports editor). After several years in Cheyenne, he accepted an offer from CBS&#x27;s KOMA radio in Oklahoma City in September 1945. He was hired primarily to broadcast Oklahoma college football (then coached by new-hire Bud Wilkinson) and Oklahoma State college basketball games (then coached by Hank Iba). In 1947–1948, in addition to calling football and basketball on KOMA, Gowdy was also broadcasting the baseball games of the Texas League Oklahoma City Indians, on station KOCY. When Gowdy announced in early 1949 that he was leaving Oklahoma to work in New York, his replacement was fellow Oklahoma City sportscaster Bob Murphy.

Gowdy&#x27;s distinctive play-by-play style during his broadcasts of minor league baseball, college football, and college basketball in Oklahoma City earned him a national audition and then an opportunity with the New York Yankees in 1949, working with (and learning from) Mel Allen for two seasons.

==Family background==
In June 1949, Curt married Geraldine (Jerre) Dawkins. She had a bachelor&#x27;s degree in education from Central State College, and was studying for a master&#x27;s degree in Radio Speech at the University of Oklahoma when they became engaged. Curt and Jerre had three children: Cheryl Ann Gowdy, Curtis Edward Gowdy Jr. (who worked as a sports producer for ABC and SNY), and Trevor Gowdy.

==Boston Red Sox==
Gowdy began his Major League Baseball broadcasting career working as the No. 2 announcer to Mel Allen for New York Yankees games on radio and television in 1949–50. There, he succeeded Russ Hodges, who departed to become the New York Giants&#x27; lead announcer when the Yankees and Giants decided to broadcast a full slate of 154 games, instead of sharing the same radio network and announcers for the 77 home games of each team that had been broadcast (no away games of either team were broadcast). Two years later, in Boston, the Red Sox and the Boston Braves followed a similar path, with each team opting for its own networks and announcers to allow each team to broadcast their full schedules, home and away. Jim Britt, who had called home games of both teams, decided to stay with the Braves, opening the top spot on the Red Sox broadcast team.

In April 1951 at the age of 31, Gowdy began his tenure as the lead announcer for the Red Sox. For the next 15 years, he called the exploits of generally mediocre Red Sox teams on WHDH radio and on three Boston TV stations: WBZ-TV, WHDH-TV, and WNAC-TV (WBZ and WNAC split the Red Sox TV schedule from 1948 through 1955; WBZ alone carried the Red Sox from 1955 through 1957; and WHDH took over in 1958). During that time, Gowdy partnered with two future baseball broadcasting legends: Bob Murphy and Ned Martin. Chronic back pain caused Gowdy to miss the entire 1957 season. He also did nightly sports reports on WHDH radio when his schedule permitted. Gowdy was also the narrator of several Red Sox highlight films during his tenure in Boston which described the season in depth along with its key moments; this would lead to him eventually narrating World Series highlight films during his time with NBC (1968–1974, &#x27;77).

Gowdy called Ted Williams&#x27; final at-bat where he hit a home run into the bullpen in right-center field off Jack Fisher of Baltimore. He also called Tony Conigliaro&#x27;s home run in his first at-bat at Fenway Park on April 17, 1964, at the age of 19.

He left WHDH after the 1965 season for NBC Sports, where for the next ten years he called the national baseball telecasts of the Saturday afternoon &quot;Game of the Week&quot; and &quot;Monday Night Baseball&quot; during the regular season (and the All-Star Game in July), and the postseason playoffs and World Series in October.

==National broadcaster==

===Early ABC Sports career===
Following a stint calling NBA games for NBC from 1955 to 1960, Gowdy moved to ABC, where he teamed with Paul Christman to cover college football in 1960 and 1961 and the American Football League from 1962 to 1964. On February 27, 1966, Gowdy called his final major event for ABC, the 1966 Daytona 500 which aired as part of the long running sports anthology series &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot;.

===NBC Sports===
In the fall of 1965, he moved full-time to NBC, with whom he would be employed for over a decade. Gowdy was the lead play-by-play announcer for the network for both the American Football League (AFC from 1970 on) and Major League Baseball, but Gowdy also covered a wide range of sports, earning him the nickname of the &quot;broadcaster of everything.&quot; He called the 1969 Final Four in Louisville and during the closest played game of the tournament, the semi-final between UCLA and Drake, he confused Drake with Duke, mistakenly calling the Drake Bulldogs by the wrong name no fewer than three times. It was Drake that came within three points of upsetting the mighty Bruins.

Besides Christman, who followed him from ABC to NBC, Gowdy&#x27;s other football broadcast partners were Kyle Rote, Al DeRogatis, Don Meredith, John Brodie, and Merlin Olsen. His broadcast partners for baseball included Pee Wee Reese, Tony Kubek, Sandy Koufax, and Joe Garagiola. He also had many different partners for basketball, including Tommy Hawkins and Billy Packer. DeRogatis was also Gowdy&#x27;s partner for college football games.

====Departure from NBC&#x27;s baseball telecasts====
After the 1975 World Series, he was removed from NBC&#x27;s baseball telecasts, when sponsor Chrysler insisted on having Joe Garagiola, who was their spokesman in many commercials, be the lead play-by-play voice. While Gowdy was on hand in the press box for Carlton Fisk&#x27;s home run in Game 6 of the 1975 Series, the calls were made by two of Gowdy&#x27;s Red Sox successors, Dick Stockton on TV and Ned Martin on radio. Gowdy was Martin&#x27;s color man on that home run. Gowdy returned to the NBC World Series broadcast in 1978 as &quot;Host&quot; with Garagiola handling play-by-play and Kubek and Tom Seaver providing color. After umpire Frank Pulli decided not to call interference on a significant base-running play involving Reggie Jackson in Game 4 of the 1978 Series, Gowdy interviewed Pulli on NBC shortly before Game 5 began.

===Later work===
He continued as NBC&#x27;s lead NFL announcer through the 1978 season, with his final broadcast being Super Bowl XIII between Pittsburgh and Dallas. With NBC anxious to promote Dick Enberg to the lead NFL position, NBC orchestrated a “trade” with CBS for the up-and-coming Don Criqui, who enjoyed a long career with NBC. After switching networks, Gowdy called NFL games on CBS for two seasons with former Kansas City Chiefs head coach Hank Stram, and also did baseball on radio. He returned to ABC to call regional college football in 1982 and 1983. In 1987, Gowdy was the radio voice of the New England Patriots.

In 1976, when Gowdy otherwise still worked for NBC, he was loaned to ABC to work on their Summer Olympics coverage in Montreal. Gowdy called swimming with Donna de Varona and basketball with Bill Russell.

===Notable moments called by Gowdy===
Curt Gowdy was present for some of American sports&#x27; storied moments, including Ted Williams&#x27; home run in his final at-bat in 1960, Super Bowl I, the AFL&#x27;s &quot;Heidi&quot; game of 1968, and (after the 1968 pro football season) the third AFL-NFL World Championship game (Super Bowl III) in which Joe Namath and the New York Jets defeated the NFL champion Baltimore Colts. Two years later in Super Bowl V, Gowdy called the dramatic 16–13 Colts&#x27; win over Dallas. The next year in 1971, Gowdy&#x27;s telecast on NBC caused many a Christmas dinner to be delayed as the country locked in that Christmas Day to the longest game in pro football history when the Miami Dolphins defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 27–24 in the final game at Kansas City&#x27;s Municipal Stadium. He also covered Franco Harris&#x27; &quot;Immaculate Reception&quot; of 1972, Clarence Davis&#x27; miraculous catch in a &quot;sea of hands&quot; from Oakland Raiders quarterback Ken Stabler, to defeat the Miami Dolphins in the final seconds of a legendary 1974 AFC playoff game, and Hank Aaron&#x27;s 715th home run in 1974.

Gowdy endeared himself to long-suffering American Football League fans when it was learned that in an off-air break towards the end of a game, he asked rhetorically: &quot;“I want to see Tex Maule, that —————.”&quot;, a reference to the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writer who for years had denigrated the AFL. On-air, in contrast to some of his contemporary announcers of NFL games, he avoided their hyperbole and transparent adulation of players, and gave steady, nonpartisan, but colorful descriptions of AFL games. Gowdy was also known for the occasional malapropism, including a consoling comment just after the Red Sox lost the 1975 World Series: &quot;Their future is ahead of them!&quot;

===Notable assignments===
Over the course of a career that stretched into the 1980s, Gowdy covered pro football (both the AFL and NFL), Major League Baseball, college football, and college basketball. He was involved in the broadcast of 13 World Series, 16 baseball All-Star Games, 9 Super Bowls, 14 Rose Bowls, 8 Olympic Games and 24 NCAA Final Fours. He also hosted the long-running outdoors show &quot;The American Sportsman&quot; on ABC.

Gowdy called all the Olympic Games televised by ABC from 1964 to 1988 with Roone Arledge&#x27;s sports department at ABC.

In the mid-1970s, Gowdy was host and producer of &quot;The Way It Was&quot;, for PBS, and in later years provided historic commentary for &quot;Inside the NFL&quot;, on HBO.

===Relationship with Roone Arledge===
Gowdy was also close friends with Arledge, and acknowledged that he gives Arledge all the credit for making ABC what it is today, including the creation of the network&#x27;s sports department, and the innovations for televising sporting events that made the sports departments at NBC and CBS jealous. The two were the creators, and first producers for the &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; television show.

In 1970, he was coveted by ABC&#x27;s Arledge for the new &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, but Gowdy was bound by his contract to NBC Sports (although he continued with Grits Gresham of Natchitoches, Louisiana, to host &quot;The American Sportsman&quot; on ABC).

===Commentating style===
Gowdy was said to have a warm, slightly gravelly voice and an unforced, easy style that set him apart from his peers. (Author John Updike once described him as sounding &quot;like everybody&#x27;s brother-in-law.&quot;) Unlike many well-known sportscasters, Gowdy never developed catchphrases or signature calls, but merely described the action in a straightforward manner. Examples:

===Retirement===
Gowdy&#x27;s career wound down after &quot;The American Sportsman&quot; was canceled in 1985.

He briefly came out of retirement in 1987 to call the New England Patriots on radio, and in 1988 he returned to NBC to call September NFL games with Merlin Olsen and old partner Al DeRogatis, while Olsen&#x27;s regular partner Dick Enberg was covering the Summer Olympics in Seoul.

In May 2003, a few months shy of his 84th birthday, Gowdy called a Red Sox–Yankees game from Fenway Park, as part of the &quot;ESPN Major League Baseball&quot; &quot;Living Legends&quot; series. At the end of the broadcast, he thought he could have done better. ESPN&#x27;s Chris Berman said, &quot;We&#x27;ll give you another chance.&quot; Gowdy replied, &quot;Call me back.&quot;

Gowdy also co-hosted the &quot;Drum Corps International&quot; Championships on PBS from 1989 to 1993 with Steve Rondinaro.

==Other appearances==

===Film cameos===
Gowdy made cameo appearances in the movies &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; (1988) and &quot;Summer Catch&quot; (2001), and his voice can be heard in &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (1978) and &quot;BASEketball&quot; (1998).

*&quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (1978) – TV Commentator
*&quot;The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!&quot; (1988) – The Baseball Announcer #5
*&quot;An American Summer&quot; (1990) – Himself
*&quot;BASEketball&quot; (1998) – World Series Announcer (voice)
*&quot;Summer Catch&quot; (2001) – Himself

===Television and radio commercials===
In the 1950s and &#x27;60s, &#x27;Curt Gowdy did pre-recorded and live commercials for Red Sox sponsor Narragansett Beer. His voice speaking the famous line: &quot;Hi Neighbor, have a &#x27;Gansett&quot; was known to Red Sox fans everywhere.
In the 1980s, Gowdy voiced a series of beer commercials for Genesee. Essentially, these ads had an outdoor enthusiast theme, with Curt&#x27;s tag line being &quot;Genesee – the great outdoors in a glass.&quot;

==Author==
Gowdy, who also did some sportswriting during his early broadcasting days, wrote two books: &quot;Cowboy at the Mike&quot; (1966), with Al Hirshberg, and &quot;Seasons to Remember: The Way It Was in American Sports, 1945–1960&quot; (1993), with John Powers. He also wrote the foreword for the 2000 book &quot;The Golden Boy,&quot; authored by Dr. George I. Martin, in which Gowdy described the subject of the book, Jackie Jensen, as possibly the best athlete he had ever covered.

==Radio stations==
In 1963, Gowdy purchased radio stations WCCM and WCCM-FM in Lawrence, Massachusetts, later changing the FM station&#x27;s call letters to WCGY to somewhat match his name. Gowdy also owned several radio stations in Wyoming, including KOWB and KCGY in Laramie. He sold his broadcast interests in Massachusetts in 1994 and his Wyoming stations in 2002. He also owned WEAT and WEAT-FM in West Palm Beach, Florida, and WBBX in New Hampshire. The year away from broadcasting the Red Sox in 1957 awakened him to the fact that he might need an alternate way of making a living, leading to his interest in station ownership.

==Awards==
In 1970, Gowdy became the first sportscaster to receive the George Foster Peabody Award. The National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association named Gowdy as Massachusetts Sportscaster of the Year five times (1959–1963) and National Sportscaster of the Year twice (1966, 1969), and inducted him into its Hall of Fame in 1981. In 1985, he was inducted into the American Sportscasters Association Hall of Fame along with his onetime Yankees partner Mel Allen and Chicago legend Jack Brickhouse. He served as the organization&#x27;s vice president and was a member of its board of directors. In addition, he was given the Ford C. Frick Award from the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1984, the Pete Rozelle Award from the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1993 and a lifetime achievement Emmy in 1992, and was selected to the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2000. Gowdy was president of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame for several years, and that institution&#x27;s Curt Gowdy Media Award is presented annually to outstanding basketball writers and broadcasters; he was one of its first two recipients.

==Curt Gowdy State Park==
A state park in Wyoming, opened in 1971, was officially named for Gowdy on March 27, 1972, one of numerous honors bestowed on the native son from the state of Wyoming on &quot;Curt Gowdy Day.&quot; The 11,000 acre (44 km2) Curt Gowdy State Park is halfway between his high school hometown of Cheyenne and his college town of Laramie. Additional land was acquired by the state for the park in 2006. &quot;It has two beautiful lakes, hiking trails, camping, boating, fishing, and beauty,&quot; said Gowdy. &quot;It has everything I love. What greater honor can a man receive?&quot;

Gowdy was proud of his Wyoming heritage and loved the outdoors, and said that he was &quot;born with a fly-rod in one hand,&quot; and that the sports microphone came a little later. In 2002, he recalled that his father, Edward Curtis Gowdy, who had taught him to hunt and fish, was the best fly-fisherman in the state. &quot;We had free access to prime-time fishing and hunting. The outdoors was a way of life for me. I should have paid them to host &quot;The American Sportsman&quot;.&quot;

On July 31, 2013, on the 94th anniversary of his birth, the state park opened an interpretive center with exhibits about the history of the park and Gowdy&#x27;s work to preserve area natural resources. Milward Simpson, director of the Wyoming State Parks and Cultural Resources Department, describes the 7,400-square foot building, which also includes meeting rooms and a lobby, as a monument to the &quot;fantastic legacy&quot; left by Gowdy.

==Death==
Gowdy died at the age of 86 at his winter home in Palm Beach, Florida, after an extended battle with leukemia. His funeral procession circled Fenway Park and he was interred in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Pallbearers included his former NBC baseball broadcast partner and New York Yankees shortstop Tony Kubek.

==Curt Gowdy Post Office Building==
On October 12, 2006, the United States Postal Service building in Green River, Wyoming, was officially designated as the &quot;Curt Gowdy Post Office Building,&quot; honoring the place of Gowdy&#x27;s birth. The legislation required for the USPS name change was introduced by Wyoming House Representative Barbara Cubin.

<text>Varsity is the official student newspaper of the University of Cape Town (UCT), printed since 1942.

==History==
The paper was founded as a result of the burgeoning cultural tensions on campus between Afrikaans and English students. The student representative council (SRC) sought to control these tensions by uniting the English student newspaper &quot;UCTattle&quot; and the Afrikaans medium publication &quot;Die Spantou&quot;. The SRC aimed to lessen the widening gap in political opinion advocated by each of these mouthpieces by launching a bilingual student newspaper.

A storm of controversy met the decision to abolish the original papers. The first &quot;Varsity&quot; constitution even had a clause forbidding comment on politics at UCT. The SRC was firm that &quot;racial friction and political bitterness must be eliminated&quot;. The SRC took &quot;Varsity&quot; Newspaper firmly under its wing, with much indignation from the student body. The first editor, NC Gracie, chose the name claiming UCT had the right to the name &quot;being the oldest [university] with the most inspiring record and the greatest tradition of tolerance and unity&quot;.

The newspaper grew in popularity and developed independence from the SRC. The paper maintained a spirit of liberalism during the apartheid years, with successive editors jailed and many editions incensing the National Party government. &quot;Varsity&quot; provided an important function during the years of censorship since it operated under different constraints to the mainstream press who were often prevented from reporting on the country&#x27;s growing liberation struggle.

Many former staffers at &quot;Varsity&quot; have continued to work in the media industry in South Africa.

<doc id="840496" wikidata="Q521754" url="?curid=840496" title="In the Wake of Poseidon">
<text>In the Wake of Poseidon is the second studio album by English progressive rock group King Crimson, released in May 1970 by Island Records in Europe, Atlantic Records in the United States, Philips Records in Australia, and Vertigo Records in New Zealand. To date the album is their highest-charting in the UK, reaching number 4.

The album was recorded during a period of instability within the band owing to a fluctuating lineup. It follows a musical style and track sequence very similar to their first album, &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot;. The album was well-received by contemporary critics, who commended the overall execution and production quality as an improvement over that of the band&#x27;s debut, although later assessments have faulted its heavy reliance on the template established by its predecessor.

==Background==
Ian McDonald and Michael Giles left the band following their first American tour in 1970. Around the same time Greg Lake was approached by Keith Emerson to join what would become Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer. With the absence of McDonald, Robert Fripp took on part of the keyboard-playing role in addition to guitar. As Lake&#x27;s position in the band was unclear, then-unknown Elton John was booked to sing on the recording sessions for &quot;In the Wake of Poseidon&quot;, but Fripp had second thoughts and cancelled the booking. Lake ultimately decided to leave, but agreed to sing on the recordings, negotiating to receive King Crimson&#x27;s PA equipment as payment. He ended up singing on all but one of the album&#x27;s vocal tracks. The exception was &quot;Cadence and Cascade&quot;, which was sung by Fripp&#x27;s old schoolfriend and teenage bandmate Gordon Haskell. An early mix of the song with Lake singing a guide vocal was later unearthed and featured on the DGM site as a download. Other musicians involved with the album were the briefly returning Giles and his brother Peter on drums and bass respectively, Mel Collins (formerly of the band Circus) on saxophones and flute, and jazz musician Keith Tippett on piano.

During the recording of the album in early 1970, Fripp, Lake, Tippett and the Giles brothers appeared on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; miming &quot;Cat Food&quot;. This would be King Crimson&#x27;s only appearance on the show.

With the album on sale, Fripp and Sinfield remained in the awkward position of having King Crimson material and releases available, but no band to play it. Fripp persuaded Gordon Haskell to join as singer and bass player, and recruited drummer Andy McCulloch, another Dorset musician moving in the West London progressive rock circle, who had previously been a member of Shy Limbs (alongside Greg Lake, who recommended him to Fripp) and Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band.

== Content ==
The album opens with an a cappella piece called &quot;Peace – A Beginning&quot;. An extended version of this piece, &quot;Peace – A Theme&quot;, adds a middle eight and is performed on an unaccompanied acoustic guitar. This track appears at the beginning of side two, perhaps conceived as the mid-point of the album, and a third version, &quot;Peace – An End&quot; appears at the conclusion of the album. &quot;Peace – An End&quot; is to some extent a combination of the other two versions, containing both vocals and acoustic guitar as well as the middle eight, but the lyrics are entirely different from those of &quot;Peace – A Beginning&quot;.

The strongly jazz fusion-influenced &quot;Pictures of a City&quot; was originally performed live, often extended to over ten minutes and was called &quot;A Man, a City&quot;. An example of such a performance appears on the live compilation album &quot;Epitaph&quot;.

The ballad &quot;Cadence and Cascade&quot; is about two groupies the band met while on tour.

The longest track on the album is a chaotic instrumental piece called &quot;The Devil’s Triangle&quot;. This was adapted from the 1969 band&#x27;s live arrangement of Gustav Holst&#x27;s &quot;Mars: Bringer of War&quot; (from his &quot;The Planets&quot; suite), later released on &quot;Epitaph&quot; (where it is titled merely &quot;Mars&quot;). &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Triangle&quot; employs a different staccato riff than the one from &quot;Mars&quot;. In 1971, a brief excerpt from &quot;The Devil’s Triangle&quot; was featured in &quot;The Mind of Evil&quot;, the second serial of the eighth season of the BBC television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The track includes part of the chorus from &quot;The Court of the Crimson King&quot;, a track from the band&#x27;s first album, using a studio technique known as xenochrony. Despite this, Ian McDonald, who composed &quot;The Court of the Crimson King&quot;, is not given co-writing credit on this segment of &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Triangle&quot;, only on the opening section, &quot;Merday Morn&quot;.

=== Album cover ===

The work is called &quot;The 12 Archetypes&quot; or &quot;The 12 Faces of Humankind&quot;. The colour pictures were painted by Tammo De Jongh in 1967.

The twelve faces in the picture are as follows:

# The Fool (Fire and Water): The laughing man with a wispy beard.
# The Actress (Water and Fire): The Egyptian girl with long pearl earrings and many pearl necklaces around her neck, she has tears in her eyes.
#The Observer (Air and Earth): A scientist type person with round spectacles pushed up above his brow, mostly bald head with white hair at the sides; his left hand is held up to his chin, he looks thoughtful.
# The Old Woman (Earth and Air): A woman with much wrinkled face wrapped up against the cold.
# The Warrior (Fire and Earth): A dark and powerful warrior&#x27;s face in blacks and reds. He wears a steel helmet, broad square face, open mouth with square teeth and a full black beard.
# The Slave (Earth and Fire): A black African with large gold earrings and a ring through her nose; the lips are full and pink, the eyes half-closed, sultry and sensuous; the expression is warm and friendly.
# The Child (Water and Air): A picture of innocence; a girl with delicate sweet smile and butterfly shaped bows at each side in her long golden hair; her eyes are large and watery and she has a delicate sweet smile on her mouth. She wears a gold chain, on the end of which is a small golden key.
# The Patriarch (Air and Water): An old philosopher, with a long face and long white hair and long white beard and moustache; white bushy eyebrows; all around are shapes like flowers or snowflakes; the brow is furrowed upwards from the nose in a fan-like fashion.
# The Logician (Air and Fire): A scientist or wizard type man with long face, dark hair and long dark beard; he appears to hold a long stick or wand with his right hand and his left is held aloft and surrounded by stars.
# The Joker (Fire and Air): The picture in bright reds and yellows is of a smiling twinkle-eyed Harlequin with his typical gold-stuccoed, triangular hat.
# The Enchantress (Water and Earth): A sad girl with watery eyes; her long dark hair is blown sideways across her face and brow from right to left.
# Mother Nature (Earth and Water): Lying asleep in the long grass; their face in silhouette is viewed from the left side and all around are the flowers and butterflies.

== Release ==

Released on 15 May 1970, &quot;In the Wake of Poseidon&quot; was King Crimson&#x27;s highest-charting album to date in the UK, reaching number 4.

The album was re-released in 2010 with a near-complete new stereo mix by Steven Wilson and Robert Fripp as part of the 40th Anniversary release sequence. As tape for one track, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Triangle&quot;, could not be located, the original stereo was included instead. The CD also includes a new mix of &quot;Groon&quot; (&quot;Cat Food&quot;&#x27;s B-side), an alternate take of &quot;Peace – An End&quot;, and Greg Lake&#x27;s guide vocal take of &quot;Cadence and Cascade&quot;. The DVD-A features a 5.1 mix by Steven Wilson, with &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Triangle&quot; up-mixed to 5.1 by Simon Heyworth, hi-res stereo versions of the 30th anniversary stereo master, the 2010 album mixes and ten hi-res bonus tracks including the original single &quot;Cat Food&quot;/&quot;Groon&quot;, the bonus tracks from the CD, and a number of other session takes, rehearsals and mixes.

==Reception==
Robert Christgau rated the album higher than the debut, describing it as &quot;more muddled conceptually than &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot;&quot; but commenting that &quot;they&#x27;re not afraid to be harsh, they command a range of styles, and their dynamics jolt rather than sledgehammer&quot;.

In his retrospective review, AllMusic&#x27;s Bruce Eder praised the album, saying that it was better produced than their debut, but he also said that it &quot;doesn&#x27;t tread enough new ground to precisely rival &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot;&quot;. An editor&#x27;s postscript praised a 24-bit digitally remastered edition released in March 2000. Paul Stump, in his &quot;History of Progressive Rock&quot;, said the album &quot;marks a decisive shift away from the Baroque pictorialism of &quot;Court&quot;; as [Robert Fripp biographer Eric] Tamm has observed, Fripp assumed more production duties and took it upon himself to distil the band&#x27;s sound, introducing a raw, airless edge of asperity to it he would later gloss as &#x27;audio vérité&#x27;.&quot; However, he criticized the band&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Mars&quot;.

==Track listing==
All European LPs issued by Island and Polydor have erroneously printed labels that leave off &quot;Peace – A Theme&quot; and list &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Triangle&quot; and its three movements as four distinct tracks. Most US and Japanese Atlantic LPs use the correct track listing.

<doc id="840500" wikidata="Q368400" url="?curid=840500" title="Groote Schuur Hospital">
<text>Groote Schuur Hospital is a large government-funded teaching hospital situated on the slopes of Devil&#x27;s Peak in the city of Cape Town, South Africa. It was founded in 1938 and is famous for being the institution where the first human-to-human heart transplant took place, conducted by University of Cape Town-educated surgeon Christiaan Barnard on the patient Louis Washkansky.

Groote Schuur is the chief academic hospital of the University of Cape Town&#x27;s medical school, providing tertiary care and instruction in all the major branches of medicine. The hospital underwent major extension in 1984 when two new wings were added. As such, the old main building now mainly houses several academic clinical departments as well as a museum about the first human heart transplant.

The hospital is known for its trauma unit, anaesthesiology and internal medicine departments. Groote Schuur attracts many visiting medical students, residents and specialists each year who come to gain experience in various fields. As December 2006, the hospital employed over 500 doctors, 1300 nurses and 250 allied health professionals.

Groote Schuur is Dutch for &#x27;Great Barn&#x27; and is named after the original Groote Schuur estate laid out by Dutch settlers when the city of Cape Town was founded in the 17th century.

The hospital was declared a Western Cape Provincial Heritage Site in 1996.

The N2, merged with the M3, bends around the hospital and Table Mountain National Park on a massive uphill 10-lane highway. This intersection has been named Hospital Bend due to its proximity to the hospital.

<doc id="840501" wikidata="Q5618445" url="?curid=840501" title="Gun shows in the United States">
<text>In the United States, a gun show is an event where promoters generally rent large public venues and then rent tables for display areas for dealers of guns and related items, and charge admission for buyers. The majority of guns for sale at gun shows are modern sporting firearms. Approximately 5,000 gun shows occur annually in the United States.

==Venues and attendance==

Gun shows are typically held in large public facilities such as arenas, fairgrounds, civic centers, and armories. Show promoters charge vendors fees for display tables (from $20 to $145) and booths (from $200 to $400) and charge admission fees (from $5 to $50) for the public. In addition to guns, ammunition, knives, militaria, books and other items are sold.

In 2005, Michael Bouchard, Assistant Director/Field Operations of ATF, estimated that 5,000 gun shows take place each year in the United States. Most gun shows have 2,500 to 15,000 attendees over a two-day period. The number of tables at a gun show varies from as few as fifty to as many as 2,000. At the largest gun shows, over 1,000 firearms are sold over two days. In 2007, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) reported that it found no definite numbers for U.S. gun shows, but said that estimates ranged from 2,000 to 5,200 a year. In 1999, the ATF reported that 4,442 gun shows were advertised in 1998 in &quot;Gun Show Calendar&quot;.

===SHOT Show===
The largest gun show in the United States is the annual SHOT Show. Only trade professionals, such as buyers for retail stores or law enforcement agencies, are allowed entry. It has attracted over 60,000 attendees to its 630,000 square feet of exhibition space in Las Vegas. The show is sponsored by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, an industry group of firearms and hunting businesses. It is among the top 25 trade shows in the country.

==Restrictions==
Under the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA), firearm dealers with a Federal Firearms License (FFL) were prohibited from doing business at gun shows (they were only permitted to do business at the address listed on their license). That changed with the enactment of the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986 (FOPA), which allows FFLs to transfer firearms at gun shows provided they follow the provisions of the GCA and other pertinent federal regulations. In 1999, ATF reported that between 50% and 75% of the vendors at gun shows had FFLs. Only buyers from within the state may purchase handguns.

==Gun show loophole==

The so-called &quot;Gun show loophole&quot; is a controversial political term in the United States coined by gun control supporters that refers to sales of firearms by private sellers, including those done at gun shows. Under federal law, private-party sellers are not required to perform background checks on buyers. Private sellers in some states do not need to perform background checks but are usually required to record the sale and/or ask for identification depending on the state or county. There are some Federal rules regarding the sales. As of August 2013, 33 states do not require background checks for sales of firearms by private individuals, while 17 states and Washington, D.C., do require background checks for some or all private firearm sales. This is in contrast to sales by gun stores and other Federal Firearms License holders, who are required by federal law to perform background checks of all buyers, and to record all sales, regardless of venue (i.e. private sales).

==Research and studies==
In 2000, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) published &quot;Following the Gun&quot;, its analysis of more than 1,530 trafficking investigations over a two-and-a-half-year period and found gun shows to have the second highest number of trafficked guns per investigation, after corrupt FFL dealers. (Straw purchasers were the most common channel, but averaged a relatively small number of trafficked guns per investigation compared to corrupt FFLs and gun shows.) These investigations involved a total of 84,128 firearms that had been diverted from legal to illegal commerce. All told, the report identified more than 26,000 firearms that had been illegally trafficked through gun shows in 212 separate investigations. The report stated that:

A prior review of ATF gun show investigations shows that prohibited persons, such as convicted felons and juveniles, do personally buy firearms at gun shows and gun shows are sources of firearms that are trafficked to such prohibited persons. The gun show review found that firearms were diverted at and through gun shows by straw purchasers, unregulated private sellers, and licensed dealers. Felons were associated with selling or purchasing firearms in 46 percent of the gun show investigations. Firearms that were illegally diverted at or through gun shows were recovered in subsequent crimes, including homicide and robbery, in more than a third of the gun show investigations.

A Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) report on &quot;Firearms Use by Offenders&quot; found that only 0.8% of prison inmates reported acquiring firearms used in their crimes &quot;At a gun show&quot;, with repeat offenders less likely than first-time offenders to report acquiring firearms from a retail source, gun show or flea market. This 2001 study examined data from a 1997 Department of Justice survey of more than 18,000 federal and state prison inmates in 1,409 State prisons and 127 Federal prisons. The remaining 99.2% of inmates reported obtaining firearms from other sources, including &quot;From a friend/family member&quot; (36.8%), &quot;Off the street/from a drug dealer&quot; (20.9%), &quot;From a fence/black market source&quot; (9.6%), &quot;From a pawnshop&quot;, &quot;From a flea market&quot;, &quot;From the victim&quot;, or &quot;In a burglary&quot;. 9% of inmates replied &quot;Don&#x27;t Know/Other&quot; to the question of where they acquired a firearm and 4.4% refused to answer. The Department of Justice did not attempt to verify the firearms reported in the survey or trace them to determine their chain of possession from original retail sale to the time they were transferred to the inmates surveyed (in cases where inmates were not the original retail purchaser).

Garen Wintemute, a professor of emergency room medicine and director of UC Davis&#x27; Violence Prevention Research Program, released a study in 2007 which held that gun shows are a venue for illegal activity, including straw purchases and unlicensed sales to prohibited individuals.

In 2011, economists Mark Duggan and Randi Hjalmarsson at the University of Maryland and Brian Jacob from the University of Michigan released a paper which stated that gun shows do not lead to substantial increases in either gun homicides or gun suicides.

==ATF criminal investigations at gun shows==
From 2004 to 2006, ATF conducted surveillance and undercover investigations at 195 gun shows (approximately 2% of all shows). Specific targeting of suspected individuals (77%) resulted in 121 individual arrests and 5,345 firearms seizures. Seventy nine of the 121 ATF operation plans were known suspects previously under investigation.

Additionally, ATF Field Offices report that:

* Between 2002 and 2005, more than 400 guns legally purchased at gun shows from licensed dealers in the city of Richmond, Virginia, were later recovered in connection with criminal activity. Bouchard said, &quot;These figures do not take into account firearms that may have been sold at Richmond area gun shows by unlicensed sellers, as these transactions are more difficult to track.&quot; It is noteworthy that the &quot;in connection with criminal activity&quot; category includes stolen guns later recovered from burglaries, but the report does not specify how many guns in the 400 gun figure cited were not guns used in the commission of a crime, but that were rather the fruits of criminal activity.
* The Department of Justice reports, &quot;after reviewing hundreds of trace reports associated with guns used in crime recovered in the New Orleans area and interviewing known gang members and other criminals, ATF Special Agents identified area gun shows as a source used by local gang members and other criminals to obtain guns.&quot;
* In 2003 and 2004, the San Francisco ATF Field Division conducted six general operations at Reno, Nevada, gun shows to investigate interstate firearms trafficking. During these operations, &quot;agents purchased firearms and identified violations related to &quot;off paper&quot; sales, sales to out-of-state residents, and dealing in firearms without a license.&quot; The &quot;ATF seized or purchased 400 firearms before making arrests and executing search warrants, which resulted in the seizure of an additional 600 firearms and the recovery of explosives.&quot;
* ATF&#x27;s Columbus Field Division conducted its anti-trafficking operations based on intelligence from Cleveland police that &quot;many of the guns recovered in high-crime areas of the city had been purchased at local gun shows.&quot; Subsequent gun show sting operations resulted in the seizure of &quot;5 guns, one indictment, and two pending indictments for felony possession of a firearm.&quot; The state of Ohio is one of the top ten source states for recovered guns used in crime.
* The ATF&#x27;s Phoenix Field Division reported that &quot;many gun shows attracted large numbers of gang members from Mexico and California. They often bought large quantities of assault weapons and smuggled them into Mexico or transported them to California.&quot; Garen Wintemute, a professor at the University of California at Davis, calls Arizona and Texas a &quot;gunrunner&#x27;s paradise&quot;.

Regarding the trafficking of firearms from the U.S. into Mexico, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report in June 2009 that stated:

While it is impossible to know how many firearms are illegally smuggled into Mexico in a given year, about 87 percent of firearms seized by Mexican authorities and traced in the last 5 years originated in the United States, according to data from Department of Justice&#x27;s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). According to U.S. and Mexican government officials, these firearms have been increasingly more powerful and lethal in recent years. Many of these firearms come from gun shops and gun shows in Southwest border states.

The GAO report has been corroborated through other sources. William Newell, Special Agent in Charge of ATF&#x27;s Phoenix Field Division, testified before a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee in March 2009, stating, &quot;Drug traffickers are able to obtain firearms and ammunition more easily in the U.S., including sources in the secondary market such as gun shows and flea markets. Depending on State law, the private sale of firearms at those venues often does not require record keeping or background checks prior to the sale.&quot; The ATF has also reported that, &quot;Trends indicate the firearms illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border are becoming more powerful. ATF has analyzed firearms seizures in Mexico from FY 2005–07 and identified the following weapons most commonly used by drug traffickers: 9mm pistols; .38 Super pistols; 5.7mm pistols; .45-caliber pistols; AR-15 type rifles; and AK-47 type rifles.&quot; However, this is based only on the weapons sent to the ATF to be traced, a small portion of all firearms seized by the Mexican government, and the extent to which they are representative of all seized firearms is disputed. According to Raul Benitez, a security expert at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, &quot;Mexico&#x27;s southern border with Guatemala has long been an entry point for such weapons and today could account for 10 to 15 percent coming through.&quot; William La Jeunesse and Maxim Lott have described Mexico as a &quot;virtual arms bazaar&quot;, where one can purchase a wide variety of military weapons from international sources: &quot;fragmentation grenades from South Korea, AK-47s from China, and shoulder-fired rocket launchers from Spain, Israel and former Soviet bloc manufacturers.&quot; In addition, they say that Mexican drug cartels have long-established drug- and gun-running ties with Latin American revolutionary movements such as Colombia&#x27;s FARC. Further, China has supplied military arms to Latin America and Chinese-made assault weapons have been recovered in Mexico, according to Amnesty International. Finally, the Mexican army has seen rampant desertion rates (150,000 in the last six years) and many soldiers have taken their weapons home with them, including Belgian-made M16s.

It is difficult to legally acquire fully automatic firearms at American gun shows (as opposed to the semiautomatic-only versions of these firearms that are legal on the U.S. civilian market), due to National Firearms Act (NFA). To legally purchase or transfer a fully automatic firearm, U.S. citizens must pay a $200 transfer tax, submit a full set of fingerprints on FBI Form FD-258, obtain certification provided by a chief law enforcement officer (&quot;CLEO&quot;: the local chief of police, sheriff of the county, head of the State police, or State or local district attorney or prosecutor), and obtain final approval from the BATF on a Form 4 transfer of NFA registration to the new owner. All private citizens must wait, typically months, before receiving the tax stamp for the $200 tax paid, authorizing taking possession of the already paid-for fully automatic firearm. Until in receipt of the tax stamp, the Class III dealer retains control of the fully automatic firearm. In addition, only fully automatic firearms manufactured before the Firearm Owner&#x27;s Protection Act of 1986 are permitted to be transferred. No fully automatic firearms recovered in Mexico have been traced to the United States.

<doc id="840503" wikidata="Q1579049" url="?curid=840503" title="Utility location">
<text>Utility locating is the process of identifying and labeling public utility mains that are underground. These mains may include lines for telecommunication, electricity distribution, natural gas, cable television, fiber optics, traffic lights, street lights, storm drains, water mains, and wastewater pipes. In some locations, major oil and gas pipelines, national defense communication lines, mass transit, rail, and road tunnels also compete for space underground.

==Overview==
Public utility systems are often run underground—some by the very nature of their function, others for convenience or aesthetics. In the United States, it is estimated that subsurface lines amount to over in total. Before digging, local governments often require that the underground systems&#x27; locations be denoted and approved, if it is to be in the public right-of-way.

Pipeline markers, signs, or other indicators may or not be visible to warn of the presence of underground utilities. For various reasons, including security, the precise location of the utilities may not be indicated. The only way an excavator can know the precise location, number, and types of utilities is to contact the underground utilities coordinator, and request that the locations be marked. In most jurisdictions, there is no charge for this service, but advance notification is a legal requirement.

In the UK, to follow HSG47 and PAS128 guidelines, it is recommended that a Desktop Utility Search is carried out. A Utility Search, also known as a C2 Utility Search or PAS128 (D) utility search, is the initial step in identifying utility asset owners and locating their buried and overhead assets and apparatus. A Utility Search is essential for development projects as it provides valuable insight into the presence and location of underground and overhead utility assets. As well as providing a understanding of the networks within the vicinity of a site, this information can help to prevent accidents, disruptions, and costly delays during construction.

== Technology and equipment ==
Because of the many different types of materials that go into manufacturing each of the different types of underground lines, different detection and location methods must be used. The two general methods are called passive locating and active locating.

Passive locating uses signals that occur naturally on some utility lines. This method often fails to locate 60% or so of utility lines, and misidentifying utilities is an associated risk. Active locating, on the other hand, is more accurate. It makes use of signals that the locators generate through a transmitter. Then, with the help of a receiver, locators can trace as well as identify what type of utility line lies underground.

The active method is the most suitable for locating conductive metal pipes and cables. This process often involves using a piece of electromagnetic equipment, consisting of a transmitter and a receiver. For other types of pipe such as plastic or concrete, a metallic tracer wire or conductive foil (detectable tape) may be buried alongside or immediately above the pipe, to aid in locating it. In the absence of such a conductive tracer, other types of radiolocation or modern ground-penetrating radar must be used. Location by these technical means is necessary because maps often lack the pinpoint precision needed to ensure proper clearance. In older cities, it is especially a problem since maps may be very inaccurate, or may be missing entirely.

A few utilities are permanently marked with short posts or bollards, mainly for lines carrying petroleum products. This may be done because of venting requirements, and also serves to indicate the location of underground facilities that are especially hazardous if disturbed.

, utility locators depend primarily on three types of utility locating equipment to do their job, including GPR, electromagnetic profiling locators, and radio frequency pipe locators. These tools are produced by a number of manufacturers, and are widely available throughout the world. Some of the large manufacturers include Leica, RIDGID, and Schonstedt. With advances in technology, these tools continue to improve, and locators in the field are able to be more accurate. 

Many utilities are now mapped out on GIS mapping services like ESRI, which improves both accuracy and process transparency. Some of the current locate wands are able to relay their information and sync up with GIS systems to expand and correct the information on the map, which helps to update the map very rapidly.

==Organizations==
In the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, many large locate companies handle millions of tickets every dig season, and need a way of managing these tickets and sending them through to a unified call center (for example, Underground Service Alert).

The Common Ground Alliance (CGA) publishes the Damage Information Reporting Tool (DIRT report) every year, which gives a fuller picture of the effects of utility locating throughout North America. In recent years, DIRT has demonstrated a trend of greater excavation damage incidents over time. This report does not contain every single incident, as stakeholders voluntarily submit underground damages and near-miss reports, but it is the most complete repository of utility damages anywhere in the world. Utility Locators and other stakeholders depend on data like this to learn about risks and to justify continued investment in the industry. 

Industry leaders in damage prevention like the Common Ground Alliance and IR-Saving Lives are the biggest promoters of utility locating, and encourage other stakeholders to take utility locating seriously. The CGA also has published a paper called &quot;Insights into Improving the Delivery of Accurate, On-Time Locates&quot;, which has expert information on how to improve the locating industry in the US and Canada (not to be confused with the Canadian Common Ground Alliance (CCGA), a companion organization to CGA in Canada).

Other technologies and equipment are identified in Technology Reports by CGA and in a major study by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration in 2017 entitled &quot;A Study on Improving Damage Prevention Technology&quot;.

==Telephone hotlines==
&quot;Call before you dig&quot;, &quot;Know What&#x27;s Below! Dig With Confidence!&quot;, &quot;Dial before you dig&quot;, &quot;Digger&#x27;s Hotline&quot;, &quot;One-call&quot;, &quot;Miss Utility&quot;, &quot;Dig Safe&quot;, &quot;Click before you dig&quot;, or Underground Service Alert are services that allow construction workers or property owners to contact utility companies, who will then denote where underground utilities are located via color-coded markings typically up to and not past the user&#x27;s service connection or meter. Utility lines on the other side of the meter or service connection are considered to be part of the customer&#x27;s property, and will typically not be located by these services.

Failure to call such a number ahead of time may result in a fine or even a criminal charge against a person or company, particularly if such negligence causes a major utility outage or serious accident, or an evacuation due to a gas leak. Hitting a water main may also trigger local flooding or require a boil-water advisory.

The following is a partial list of countries with one-call services for utility location:
* Australia: Australia has a National online website for lodgement of enquiries (https://www.byda.com.au). The national hotline, 1100, has now been converted to a support line to assist with online lodgement.
* Canada: In Canada, there is no unified number for the country. However, it has the &quot;Click Before You Dig&quot; website that provides access to the hotline for each of the provinces.
* New Zealand: Each utility is responsible for marking its own services. A private company (https://www.beforeudig.co.nz/) has been contracted by many utilities and city councils to provide one-call services and corridor access requests. A person planning to dig in the public roadway can lodge a ticket with BeforeUDig and have the utilities in the area notified who in turn will respond with maps of their assets. 
* United Kingdom: In Scotland there is an online web based service called Vault (short for Scottish Community Apparatus Data Vault), which allows registered users to specify a polygon on a map and immediately obtain an interactive map of all major undertakers owning underground assets, except the principal telecoms operators. In the rest of the UK, there is no dial-before-you-dig service. Instead the onus is on excavators to ensure that they do not damage buried services. This has resulted in a class of locating tools which are simpler to use, and are called Cable Avoidance Tools (CATs), and the associated signal detectors are called Gennys.
* United States: As required by law and assigned by the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the 8-1-1 telephone number is used for this purpose across the United States. 

==Color-coding==
 

Utility color codes are used to identify existing underground utilities in construction areas, to protect them from damage during excavation. Colored lines, flags, or both are used to mark the location and denote the type of underground utility. A special type of spray paint dispenser, which works when the can is upside-down, is used to mark lines, often in a fluorescent color. On flags, a logo often identifies the company or municipal utility which the lines belong to.

Flags may also be an advertisement for a company which has installed an irrigation system for lawns or gardens. In this case, each sprinkler head is usually marked, so that landscaping crews will not cover or bury them with soil or sod, or damage them with tractors or other construction equipment while digging holes for trees, shrubs, or other large plants or fenceposts. This is also important because a vehicle (tractor, truck, or otherwise) can break a sprinkler or the hard-PVC pipe or joint it is mounted on, simply by driving over it, particularly on newly moved soil which is uncompacted and therefore unsupportive of such weight.

===Australia===
The national standard for Australia uses the following color guide:

=== Germany ===

In Germany, the colors used for temporary marking of underground utilities are not standardized like in other countries. However, permanent marker signs are used for utilities like hydrants, drinking water lines and natural gas lines. A permanent marking of cables and sewage lines is not usual if they run in the public right-of-way. The standard for permanent markers in Germany uses the following colors:

===India===
India uses a convention similar to the US, for marking underground utilities such as telephone, gas, water and electricity. The system is based entirely on convention without any written standard. These markings are color-coded, and are painted by contractors onto the pavement.

The main colors based on the convention are used in the same way as in the US: red for electricity, yellow for gas, and blue for water. However, other colors have other meanings. Green is used for telecommunication conduits. White is used as general communication between contractors; white is also used to note the details of road surface markings so that markings can be easily restored after the road construction is completed; a few telecommunication companies also use white color for their utility locations. Orange and other colors are used by local authorities to mark improvements and other details not related to utility locations.

===New Zealand===
There are no legal color code requirements for buried utilities and surface markings, however a general convention is used and encouraged by the government health and safety department - Worksafe.

===United Kingdom===
The national standard for the United Kingdom uses the following color guide:

=== United States and Canada ===

Canada and the United States use the American Public Works Association (APWA) Uniform Color Codes for temporary marking of underground utilities:

Some municipalities use pink paint to make lines and codes on the pavements related to required street improvements such as ramp replacement, asphalt grinding, and form injection. These markings are not directly related to utility location.

<doc id="840505" wikidata="Q6591633" url="?curid=840505" title="List of United States Naval officer designators">
<text>This is a list of naval officer designators in the United States Navy. In the United States Navy, all active and reserve component officers are assigned to one of four officer communities, based on their education, training, and assignments: Line Officers (divided into Unrestricted Line or URL, Restricted Line or RL, and Restricted Line Special Duty or RL SD), Staff Corps Officers, Limited Duty Officers (LDO), or Warrant Officers (WO/CWO). Each community is further subdivided by primary occupation. Each occupation is identified by a designator.

==Definition==
The officer billet designator codes are four-digit numbers used to identify the primary naval specialty qualifications required of the billet incumbent and to administratively categorize officer billets for proper management and identification. They serve as a manpower management tool when used in conjunction with the officer designator codes. These codes are entered in the Manpower Authorizations (OPNAV Form 1000/2) to indicate the categories of officers required for the billets.

The first digit identifies the officer&#x27;s community.
The second and third digits denote the officer&#x27;s area of specialization within the line, staff corps, LDO, or warrant officer community.

The final (fourth) digit denotes the officer&#x27;s current type of commission.
Between fiscal year 1992 and fiscal year 2005, all officers entering the U.S. Navy were awarded a Reserve commission (commissioned as ensigns, USNR). Legislation was signed that all Reserve officers on full-time active duty, previously designated by a &quot;5&quot; in the last digit of the designator, would be converted to a regular Navy commission by the close of fiscal year 2006.

There is no distinction between USN and USNR officers, no matter what the commissioning source. All hold the same ranks, have the same responsibilities and authority, and enjoy the same privileges. As part of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Active–Reserve Integration (ARI) initiative that &quot;operationalized&quot; the Navy&#x27;s Reserve component, the term &quot;U.S. Naval Reserve&quot; was superseded by &quot;U.S. Navy Reserve&quot;, and the term USNR was discontinued as a matter of Total Force policy in 2005. All officers in the U.S. Navy now use the term USN with their rank titles.

As used above, Training and Administration of the Reserve (TAR) program officers are reserve officers serving on either fixed or indefinite periods of active duty, while remaining reserve officers, under the authority of 10 USC 12310. The Training and Administration of the Reserve program exists to provide TAR for training, administration, recruiting, organization, and equipping the reserve components.

==(1xxx) Line Officers==
===Fully Warfare Qualified Unrestricted Line (URL) Officers===
Unrestricted Line Officers (URL Officers) are commissioned Officers of the Line in the United States Navy, both Regular Navy and Navy Reserve, who are not restricted in the performance of duty, and are qualified to Command at Sea the Navy&#x27;s warfighting combatant units such as warships, submarines, aviation squadrons, and SEAL Teams.

<text>Sebastian (alternative title &quot;När alla vet&quot;) is a 1995 Swedish film based on the novel by Per Knutsen that chronicles the coming out experience of a teenage boy. It is directed by Svend Wam.

==Plot==
16-year-old Sebastian (Hampus Björck) has nice parents and a great circle of friends, is doing well in school, has good looks, and leads a happy life—or at least that is what everyone thinks. Secretly, he has been brooding for some time over the fact that he is in love with his best friend, the rather hunky Ulf (Nicolai Cleve Broch).

One evening, after some playful frolicking around with Ulf, Sebastian plants a kiss on Ulf&#x27;s lips, not exactly to the latter&#x27;s delight. Being sexually rejected in this way throws Sebastian into an even deeper depression about his sexuality. He refuses to discuss these issues with his parents and only after a long talk with a female friend of his, who is also in love with Ulf and guesses correctly what Sebastian&#x27;s problem could be, he opens up to his family and friends, only to find that it is not all that problematic to them.

Even the coming out to Ulf, which he anticipated to be very painful, turns out to be not so bad and actually takes a comical turn when Ulf admits to having had a homosexual experience himself some time ago. In the end, basically nothing has changed, except that Sebastian no longer has to waste energy guarding his secret and can instead concentrate on being happy, having fun with his friends, and perhaps finding a real boyfriend someday.

==Cast==
* Hampus Björck as Sebastian

==Reactions==
In critical reviews, &quot;Sebastian&quot; is frequently dismissed as escapist gay youth fare that does not address any deeper issues. However, as the movie points out correctly, the most difficult part of the coming out process is fighting one&#x27;s inner uncertainty and self-doubt. And even if (as in the case of Sebastian) a coming out is comparatively eventless, the inner resolve required to take that step stays the same.

<doc id="840510" wikidata="Q600524" url="?curid=840510" title="Sokoto Caliphate">
<text>The Sokoto Caliphate (), also known as the Sultanate of Sokoto, was a Sunni Muslim caliphate in West Africa. It was founded by Usman dan Fodio in 1804 during the Fulani jihads after defeating the Hausa Kingdoms in the Fulani War. The boundaries of the caliphate extended to parts of present-day Cameroon, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Nigeria. By 1837, the Caliphate had a population of 10-20 million people, becoming the most populous empire in West Africa. It was dissolved when the British, French, and Germans conquered the area in 1903 and annexed it into the newly established Northern Nigeria Protectorate, Senegambia and Niger and Kamerun respectively.

The caliphate emerged after the Hausa King Yunfa attempted to assassinate Usman Dan Fodio in 1802. To escape persecution, Usman and his followers migrated towards Gudu in February 1804. Usman&#x27;s followers pledged allegiance to Usman as the Commander of the Faithful (). By 1808, the Sokoto Caliphate had gained control over Hausaland and several surrounding states. Under the sixth caliph Ahmadu Rufai, the state reached its maximum extent, covering a large swath of West Africa. In 1903, the twelfth and last caliph Attahiru was assassinated by British forces, marking the end of the caliphate.

Developed in the context of multiple independent Hausa Kingdoms, at its peak, the caliphate linked over 30 different emirates and 10–20+ million people in the largest independent polity in the continent at the time. According to historian John Iliffe, Sokoto was &quot;the most prosperous region in tropical Africa.&quot; The caliphate was a loose confederation of emirates that recognized the suzerainty of the Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin, the Sultan of Sokoto.

An estimated 1 to 2.5 million non-Muslim slaves were captured during the Fulani War. Slaves worked plantations and much of the population converted to Islam despite being encouraged not to. By 1900, Sokoto had &quot;at least 1 million and perhaps as many as 2.5 million slaves&quot; second only to the American South (which had four million in 1860) in size among all modern slave societies.

Although European colonists abolished the political authority of the caliphate, the title of sultan was retained and remains an important religious position for Sunni Muslims in the region to the current day. Usman Dan Fodio&#x27;s jihad inspired a series of related jihads in other parts of the Sudanian Savanna and the Sahel far beyond the borders of what is now Nigeria that led to the foundation of Islamic states in the regions that are now in modern-day Senegal, Mali, Ivory Coast, Chad, the Central African Republic, and Sudan.

The legacy of the Sokoto Caliphate and Usman dan Fodio&#x27;s teachings have left a lasting impact on the region&#x27;s history, including contemporary Nigeria and West Africa. The Sokoto era produced some of the most renowned writers in West Africa with the three main reformist leaders, Usman, Abdullahi and Bello, writing more than three hundred books combined on a wide variety of topics, including logic, tafsir, mathematics, governance, law, astronomy, grammar, medicine, and so on. Some other famous scholars of that era were Shaikh Dan Tafa and Nana Asma&#x27;u. All of these scholars are still being widely studied around West Africa and some as far as the Middle East.

==History==

===Background===
The major power in the region in the 17th and 18th centuries had been the Bornu Empire. However, revolutions and the rise of new powers decreased the power of the Bornu empire and by 1759 its rulers had lost control over the oasis town of Bilma and access to the Trans-Saharan trade. Vassal cities of the empire gradually became autonomous, and the result by 1780 was a political array of independent states in the region.

The fall of the Songhai Empire in 1591 to Morocco also had freed much of the central Bilad as-Sudan, and a number of Hausa sultanates led by different Hausa aristocracies had grown to fill the void. Three of the most significant to develop were the sultanates of Gobir, Kebbi (both in the Rima River valley), and Zamfara, all in present-day Nigeria. These kingdoms engaged in regular warfare against each other, especially in conducting slave raids. In order to pay for the constant warfare, they imposed high taxes on their citizens.

The region between the Niger River and Lake Chad was largely populated with the Fulani, the Hausa, and other ethnic groups that had immigrated to the area such as the Tuareg.

Much of the population had converted to Islam in the centuries before; however, local pagan beliefs persisted in many areas, especially in the aristocracy. In the end of the 1700s, an increase in Islamic preaching occurred throughout the Hausa kingdoms. A number of the preachers were linked in a shared Tariqa of Islamic study. Maliki scholars were invited or traveled to the Hausa lands from the Maghreb and joined the courts of some sultanates such as in Kano. These scholars preached a return to adherence to Islamic tradition. The most important of these scholars is Muhammad al-Maghili, who brought the Maliki jurisprudence to Nigeria.

===Fulani Jihad===

Usman dan Fodio, an Islamic scholar and an urbanized Fulani, had been actively educating and preaching in the city of Gobir with the approval and support of the Hausa leadership of the city. However, when Yunfa, a former student of dan Fodio, became the sultan of Gobir, he restricted dan Fodio&#x27;s activities, eventually forcing him into exile in Gudu. A large number of people left Gobir to join dan Fodio, who also began to gather new supporters from other regions. Feeling threatened by his former teacher, Sultan Yunfa declared war on dan Fodio on February 21, 1804.

Usman dan Fodio was elected as the &quot;Commander of the Faithful&quot; () by his followers, marking the beginning of the Sokoto state. Usman dan Fodio then created a number of flag bearers amongst those following him, creating an early political structure of the empire. Declaring a jihad against the Hausa kings, dan Fodio rallied his primarily Fulani &quot;warrior-scholars&quot; against Gobir. Despite early losses at the Battle of Tsuntua and elsewhere, the forces of dan Fodio began taking over some key cities starting in 1805. The Fulani used guerrilla warfare to turn the conflict in their favor, and gathered support from the civilian population, which had come to resent the despotic rule and high taxes of the Hausa kings. Even some non-Muslim Fulani started to support dan Fodio. The war lasted from 1804 until 1808 and resulted in thousands of deaths. The forces of dan Fodio were able to capture the states of Katsina and Daura, the important kingdom of Kano in 1807, and finally conquered Gobir in 1809. In the same year, Muhammed Bello, the son of dan Fodio, founded the city of Sokoto, which became the capital of the Sokoto state.

The jihad had created &quot;a new slaving frontier on the basis of rejuvenated Islam.&quot; By 1900, the Sokoto state had &quot;at least 1 million and perhaps as many as 2.5 million slaves&quot;, second only to the United States (which had 4 million in 1860) in size among all modern slave societies. 
=== Notable Flag-Bearers of the Caliphate and their Emirates ===

===Expansion of the Sokoto Caliphate===
From 1808 until the mid-1830s, the Sokoto state expanded, gradually annexing the plains to the west and key parts of Yorubaland. It became one of the largest states in Africa, stretching from modern-day Burkina Faso to Cameroon and including most of northern Nigeria and southern Niger. At its height, the Sokoto state included over 30 different emirates under its political structure. The political structure of the state was organized with the Sultan of Sokoto ruling from the city of Sokoto (and for a brief period under Muhammad Bello from Wurno). The leader of each emirate was appointed by the sultan as the flag-bearer for that city but was given wide independence and autonomy. Much of the growth of the state occurred through the establishment of an extensive system of ribats as part of the consolidation policy of Muhammed Bello, the second Sultan. Ribats were established, founding a number of new cities with walled fortresses, schools, markets, and other buildings. These proved crucial in expansion through developing new cities, settling the pastoral Fulani people, and supporting the growth of plantations which were vital to the economy.

The expansion of the Sokoto Caliphate had significant impacts on local populations. In many cases, conquered peoples were assimilated into the Caliphate, adopting Islam and becoming part of the Caliphate&#x27;s political and social structures. In other cases, communities resisted the Caliphate&#x27;s rule, leading to conflicts and tensions that sometimes persisted for years. The most significant impact was the spread of Islam among the local populations. The Sokoto Caliphate was intensely Islamic, and it actively sought to convert the peoples of the territories it conquered. As a result, Islam became the dominant religion in the region, with profound implications for local cultures, legal systems, and social norms. The imposition of Islamic law (Sharia) brought about changes in areas such as property rights, marriage, and criminal justice. Not all local populations accepted the Caliphate&#x27;s rule, and there were instances of resistance. Some communities maintained their traditional religions and practices despite the Caliphate&#x27;s efforts to enforce Islam. There were also armed rebellions against the Caliphate&#x27;s rule, some of which were successful in achieving local autonomy.

The expansion of the Sokoto Caliphate can be understood as a three-stage process. Initially, from 1804 to 1808, the consolidation of power occurred in Gobir and the neighboring Hausa states. The successful military campaigns against these rulers won him considerable support, establishing the foundation for the forthcoming expansion. The second stage (1809-1815) marked the eastward and southward expansion, reaching the Bornu Empire and Yorubaland. Dan Fodio and his lieutenants led a series of jihads, framed as a battle against un-Islamic practices. The success of these jihads was due not only to military prowess, but he appealed to the Fulani through the desire for conquest and enslavement of the polytheists. The Fulani were instrumental in the expansion of the Caliphate. The final stage (1815-1840) involved further consolidation and minor campaigns against resistant elements. By this time, the Caliphate had grown into one of the largest empires in Africa, extending over present-day northern Nigeria, parts of Niger, Cameroon, and Benin.

This expansion led to profound changes on local populations. The spread of Islam was a significant outcome, transforming the religious landscape of the region. Islamic law was imposed, affecting local customs and norms, especially concerning property rights, marriage, and criminal justice. This religious influence continues to shape the socio-cultural dynamics of the region. Moreover, the Caliphate&#x27;s administrative and social structures were imposed on conquered territories. The Caliphate established a system of emirates, with appointed emirs overseeing local governance. The social hierarchy saw the Sultan and the ruling elite at the top, followed by free Muslims, non-Muslims, and slaves. This system significantly altered the political fabric of the region.

==== Into the Nupe Kingdom ====
The Nupe Kingdom, historically a powerful state in Central Nigeria, was conquered by the Sokoto Caliphate in the early 19th century as part of its expansionist campaigns. The Sokoto forces, under the leadership of Usman dan Fodio&#x27;s brother, Abdullahi dan Fodio, advanced towards the Nupe Kingdom . The Nupe Kingdom, under the rule of Etsu Majiya II, was a prosperous state known for its military prowess. However, the kingdom was internally divided due to succession disputes and other political tensions. Abdullahi dan Fodio exploited these internal divisions and launched a military campaign against the Nupe Kingdom. Despite the initial resistance, the Nupe Kingdom was eventually defeated. Etsu Majiya II was killed in battle, and the kingdom fell to the Sokoto forces . After the conquest, the Sokoto Caliphate established the Bida Emirate in the Nupe Kingdom. The Caliphate appointed a local Fulani leader, known Mallam Dendo, as the emir, who ruled on behalf of the Sultan of Sokoto. The emir was expected to enforce Islamic law and pay tribute to the Sultan. The conquest of the Nupe Kingdom had significant impacts on the region. Islam became the dominant religion, and the Arabic script was introduced for writing the local Nupe language. The Sokoto Caliphate also established new trade routes and markets in the region, leading to economic changes.

==== Into the Oyo Empire ====
The Oyo Empire, located in present-day southwestern Nigeria, was one of the most powerful kingdoms in West Africa during the 18th century. However, by the early 19th century, the Oyo Empire was in decline due to internal conflicts, succession disputes, and pressures from external enemies. The Sokoto Caliphate, on the other hand, was on the rise. The Sokoto Caliphate&#x27;s main involvement with the Oyo Empire was through Ilorin, a northern Yoruba vassal state of the Oyo Empire. The Ilorin, backed by the Sokoto Caliphate, launched a series of attacks against the Oyo Empire. These attacks, combined with internal conflicts, led to the final collapse of the Oyo Empire by the mid-19th century.

==== Into other parts of Hausaland ====

Parts of present-day Niger, particularly the regions bordering Nigeria, were conquered by the Sokoto Caliphate. The town of Birnin Konni, for instance, was a significant center of the Caliphate in this region. The Sokoto Caliphate extended its influence into the northern areas of present-day Benin, which borders Nigeria to the west. The process of expansion into these regions was similar to that within Nigeria. The Caliphate launched military campaigns against local rulers, often exploiting internal conflicts and divisions. Upon conquering an area, the Caliphate would typically establish an emirate, appointing an emir to govern on behalf of the Sultan of Sokoto. The new rulers were expected to enforce Islamic law and pay tribute to the Sultan.

==== Into the Kanem-Bornu empire ====
The last major expansion of the Fulani jihadists was their part in the fall of the Sayfawa dynasty in 1846. The Sokoto Caliphate did not directly overthrow the dynasty that ruled the Bornu Empire, but the jihadist movements of the 19th century certainly had an impact on it. The empire was weakened by internal conflicts, as well as by external threats, including the expansion of the Sokoto Caliphate and the encroachment of other jihadist groups. The Fulani jihadists, under Usman dan Fodio&#x27;s banner tried to conquer Borno, who was governed by Mai Dunama IX Lefiami, in 1808. They partly succeeded. They burnt the capital, Ngazargamu and defeated the main army of the Mai of Borno.

=== Influence on other Fula Jihad states ===
The 19th century was a period of significant Islamic reform and jihads in West Africa, and the Sokoto Caliphate was just one of several powerful states that emerged during this time. In present-day Mali, the Massina Empire and the Toucouleur Empire were examples of states established through similar processes of Islamic reform and military expansion. The Massina Empire, also known as the Diina of Hamdullahi, was an early 19th-century Fulani Jihad state centered in the Inner Niger Delta area of present-day Mali. This West African state was founded by Seku Amadu, also known as Sheikh Amadu Sheikh, who started a jihad movement among the Fulani people in the region. In the early 1800s, Seku Amadu, inspired by the teachings of Usman dan Fodio and the success of the Sokoto Caliphate, was authorized by Fodio to carry out jihad in the Massina region. Seku Amadu&#x27;s forces succeeded in overthrowing the ruling elites and establishing a new jihadist state. The capital of the Massina Empire was Hamdullahi, a city founded by Seku Amadu. The expansion of the Massina Empire occurred mainly through military conquest. The Empire extended its control over the Inner Niger Delta and parts of the surrounding Sahelian and savannah regions. Some of the notable areas that came under the control of the Massina Empire include Timbuktu and Djenné, key centers of trans-Saharan slave trade. The Massina Empire&#x27;s rule was characterized by a strict interpretation of Islamic law. Seku Amadu implemented legal and social reforms, including the outlawing of many traditional polytheist practices as well as forcing many polytheists into slavery. However, the Massina Empire also faced resistance. Some local communities resisted the imposition of Islamic law and the centralization of political power. Furthermore, the Massina Empire faced external threats from neighboring states, including the Toucouleur Empire under El Hadj Umar Tall. The Massina Empire fell to the Toucouleur Empire in 1862. Despite its relatively short lifespan, the Massina Empire had a significant impact on the region. It played a key role in spreading Islam.

The Toucouleur Empire, also known as the Tukulor Empire, was a significant West African state that emerged during the 19th century, in what is now Mali, Senegal, and Guinea. It was founded by El Hadj Umar Tall, an Islamic leader of Tukulor descent, who sought to establish a jihadist state and conquer and enslave the polytheists in the region. Umar Tall began his jihad, or holy war, in the 1850s after studying in the Sokoto Caliphate. In 1854, Umar Tall declared a jihad against the un-Islamic practices of the local rulers. He assembled a large army, which included his fellow Toucouleurs, as well as other Muslim groups and enslaved individuals. With this army, he undertook a series of successful military campaigns against various West African kingdoms, including the Kingdom of Segou in 1861 and the Massina Empire in 1862. At its height, the Toucouleur Empire stretched from modern-day Senegal in the west to Timbuktu in the east. Its capital was established at Segou, in present-day Mali.

Though not strictly a jihadist state, the Wassoulou Empire, founded by Samori Ture, was a significant Islamic state during this period. Located in what is now Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Ivory Coast. The Wassoulou Empire was known for its strict implementation of Islam and enslavement of polytheists.

During and subsequent to the 18th century, the Wolof people were significantly affected by the tumultuous jihads spreading across West Africa. These militant Islamic campaigns faced heavy resistance from the Wolof kingdoms. However, in the 19th century, as the French colonial forces began taking territory in West Africa, the Wolof resisted French rule and increasingly turned towards Islam.

Despite their eventual dissolution, these jihadist states played a significant role in the spread of Islam and shaping of West Africa. They marked a crucial phase in the regional spread of Islam and a turbulent period in the region&#x27;s indigenous political and social structures. Many of the jihadist movements began with the overthrow of traditional rulers who were accused of un-Islamic practices. These rulers were often replaced with leaders who had led the jihad and who sought to establish governance in diverse communities such as the Yoruba Kingdoms, based on their new rules. The jihads often led to shifts in the social hierarchy.

===Decline===
European attention had been focusing on the region for colonial expansion for much of the last part of the 19th century. The French in particular had sent multiple exploratory missions to the area to assess colonial opportunities after 1870.

French explorer Parfait-Louis Monteil visited Sokoto in 1891 and noted that the Caliphate was at war with the Emir of Argungu, defeating Argungu the next year. Monteil claimed that Fulani power was tottering because of the war and the accession of the unpopular Caliph Abderrahman dan Abi Bakar.

However, following the Berlin Conference, the British had expanded into Southern Nigeria, and by 1901 had begun to move into the Sokoto Caliphate while simultaneous German efforts occurred in Cameroon. British General Frederick Lugard used rivalries between many of the emirs in the south and the central Sokoto administration to prevent any defense as he marched toward the capital, while the Germans conquered Adamawa. As the British approached the city of Sokoto, the new Sultan Muhammadu Attahiru I along with Muhammad bin Anabwani organized a quick defense of the city and fought the advancing British-led forces. The British force quickly won, sending Attahiru I and thousands of followers on a Mahdist &quot;hijra&quot;.

Muslim supporters and officials moved from Hausaland, Segu, Massina and Adamawa towards to Burmi, a military station on the far-eastern border of the Empire.

The now shattered Caliphate was partitioned by Britain and Germany. On March 13, 1903, at the grand market square of Sokoto, the last Vizier of the Caliphate officially conceded to British Rule. The British appointed Muhammadu Attahiru II as the new Caliph. Fredrick Lugard abolished the Caliphate, but retained the title &quot;Sultan&quot; as a symbolic position in the newly organized Northern Nigeria Protectorate. This remnant became known as &quot;Sokoto Sultanate Council&quot;. In June 1903, the British defeated the remaining forces of Attahiru I in an engagement where he was killed in action; by 1906, armed resistance to British rule had ended.

==Administrative structure==
The Sokoto state was largely organized around a number of largely independent emirates pledging allegiance to the sultan of Sokoto. The administration was initially built to follow those of Muhammad during his time in Medina, but also the theories of Al-Mawardi in &quot;The Ordinances of Government&quot;. The Hausa kingdoms prior to Usman dan Fodio had been run largely through hereditary succession.

The early rulers of Sokoto, dan Fodio and Bello, abolished systems of hereditary succession, preferring leaders to be appointed by virtue of their Islamic scholarship and moral standing. Emirs were appointed by the sultan; they traveled yearly to pledge allegiance and deliver taxes in the form of crops, cowry shells, and slaves. When a sultan died or retired from the office, an appointment council made up of the emirs would select a replacement. Direct lines of succession were largely not followed, although each sultan claimed direct descent from dan Fodio.

The caliphate absorbed many of the structures of governments of their Hausa predecessors which they had conquered. It ruled under Islamic law with powers falling to the emirates which made up the caliphate. A large number of emirs and senior officials were Fulani clerics and scholars who participated in the Fulani War.

The major administrative division was between Sokoto and the Gwandu Emirate. In 1815, Usman dan Fodio retired from the administrative business of the state and divided the area taken over during the Fulani War with his brother Abdullahi dan Fodio ruling in the west with the Gwandu Emirate and his son Muhammed Bello taking over administration of the Sokoto Sultanate. The Emir at Gwandu retained allegiance to the Sokoto Sultanate and spiritual guidance from the sultan, but the emir managed the separate emirates under his supervision independently from the sultan.

The administrative structure of loose allegiances of the emirates to the sultan did not always function smoothly. There was a series of revolutions by the Hausa aristocracy in 1816–1817 during the reign of Muhammed Bello, but the sultan ended these by granting the leaders titles to land. There were multiple crises that arose during the 19th century between the Sokoto Sultanate and many of the subservient emirates: notably, the Adamawa Emirate and the Kano Emirate. A serious revolt occurred in 1836 in the city-state of Gobir, which was crushed by Muhammed Bello at the Battle of Gawakuke.

The Sufi community throughout the region proved crucial in the administration of the state. The Tariqa brotherhoods, most notably the Qadiriyya, to which every successive sultan of Sokoto was an adherent, provided a group linking the distinct emirates to the authority of the sultan. Scholars Burnham and Last claim that this Islamic scholarship community provided an &quot;embryonic bureaucracy&quot; which linked the cities throughout the Sokoto state.

=== Viziers of Sokoto ===

The Caliphate and its resulting emirates each had Viziers (Waziris) as they are called in the Caliphate. Those Viziers mostly came from the most learned families in Sokoto, learned not only in the legal and political aspects of Islam but also in its mystical side. The classical vizierate is based on some verses from the Quran.

The vizierate in Sokoto was based on the Abbasid Caliphate version of the position. Shaikh Uthman dan Fodio&#x27;s book, &quot;Bayan wujab al-hijra,&quot; justifies the existence of the position in the caliphate:The first pillar [of a kingdom] is an upright wazir (vizier) over the wilaya who wakens [the king] if he sleeps and gives him sight if he cannot see and reminds him if he is heedless. The greatest catastrophe which could befall the wilaya and its subjects is to be deprived of good wazirs and helpers. One of the requirements of a wazir is that he should truly be benevolent and kind-hearted towards the people.The first Grand Vizier of Sokoto was Abdullahi dan Fodio. He was described as a &#x27;helper&#x27; to the Shaikh, the most important of his helpers. The 2nd Grand Vizier was Waziri Gidado bin Abu Bakr who was under Sultan Muhammad Bello. All subsequent &#x27;Grand Vizier of Sokoto&#x27; came from his family, with his great-grandson, Gidado Idris, continuing the tradition of being the &#x27;helper&#x27; to a Head of State by serving as Secretary to the Government of the Federation under the government of General Sani Abacha.

Waziri Gidado was married to the Shaikh&#x27;s daughter Nana Asma&#x27;u dan Fodio. Abdullahi dan Fodio, the previous Grand Vizier, refused to relinquish the position even though Sultan Bello chose Gidado but he later formally recognised Gidado as the new vizier after his reconciliation with Muhammad Bello, giving Gidado his robes in token. As Vizier, Gidado had considerable freedom of judgement. He retired the Emir of Daura, Ishaq, and appointed his son, Zubair bin Ishaq which was later approved by Sultan Bello.

The position had a &#x27;considerable following&#x27;. The Scottish explorer Hugh Clapperton in 1826 speaks of &#x27;a numerous train of attendants on horseback and on foot&#x27;; another explorer Paul Staudinger in 1886 says the Vizier had considerable &#x27;house-power&#x27; (&#x27;eine ziemliche Hausmacht&#x27;), having a hundred gunmen in his following. He had several estates and villages under him but their inhabitants are often scattered and distant from Sokoto only joining him for a major expedition.

Foreign visitors between 1880 and 1890 often saw the position as all-powerful. The Scottish geologist and explorer Joseph Thomson described him as being &#x27;more powerful than the Sultan himself&#x27; since &#x27;nothing is done except by his advice&#x27;; Staudinger reported that he was the most powerful of ministers, almost more so than the Sultan, since all government business went through him; William Wallace found that &#x27;the grand Vizier practically rules the Fulah Empire&#x27; and holds &#x27;all the real power, the Sultans being completely hedged in by formalities&#x27;. Though these impressions are exaggerated, the Vizier did appear to have the whole civil service under his control. The vizierate never rivalled the Caliph&#x27;s position. The Vizier was the chief supporter, adviser and friend to the Caliph, and in that position was able to reassert the Islamic tradition in Sokoto.

=== Military ===

The military, which was commanded by the Sarkin Yaki (war commander) the title still held by the descendants of Ali Jedo, at the time of the jihad was organized into a standing army and a cavalry. The standing army was composed of Hausa and Fulani warriors who were trained in warfare and were responsible for the Caliphate&#x27;s defense and the expansion of its territories. The cavalry was an essential part of the military, as horses were the primary mode of transportation during this period. During the expansion, the Caliphate&#x27;s military utilized a strategy of establishing emirates in conquered territories. These emirates were governed by emirs, who were either appointed by the Sultan or were local rulers who had submitted to the Caliphate&#x27;s authority. This strategy helped in maintaining control over the vast territories of the Caliphate.

The Sokoto Caliphate relied heavily on the use of cavalry in its military campaigns. The Fulani horsemen, renowned for their equestrian skills, formed the core of the Caliphate&#x27;s cavalry. They were instrumental in the rapid expansion of the Caliphate&#x27;s territories. Parfait-Louis Monteil, the french explorer who visited the caliphate in 1890, claimed that he witnessed Sultan Umaru bin Ali raise &quot;an army of forty thousand men, half of whom were cavalry, to lay siege to Argungu.&quot;

Additionally, the Caliphate&#x27;s military strategy involved a system of alliances with local rulers. In some cases, these rulers were allowed to maintain their positions under the condition that they pledged allegiance to the Caliphate and adopted Islam. This strategy helped to solidify the Caliphate&#x27;s control over conquered territories. The military expansion of the Sokoto Caliphate had significant social, political, and economic impacts. It led to the spread of Islam and the Fulani language and culture in the region. The Caliphate&#x27;s rule also resulted in changes in local governance systems and the economy, with the introduction of new administrative structures and trade networks.

=== Scholarship ===

Islamic scholarship was a crucial aspect of the Caliphate from its founding. Sultan Usman dan Fodio, Sultan Muhammed Bello, Emir Abdullahi dan Fodio, Sultan Abu Bakr Atiku, and Nana Asma&#x27;u devoted significant time to chronicling histories, writing poetry, and Islamic studies. A number of manuscripts are available, and they provide crucial historical information and important spiritual texts. This role did diminish after the reign of Bello and Atiku.

Although veiling was practiced, it did not stop women from being educated in the caliphate. Many of the women around Shaikh Uthman dan Fodio, like his wives and daughters, were also his students and attained great learning. Slaves were encouraged to become Muslims and their children were given Muslim education and were taught Arabic.

==Economy==
After the establishment of the Caliphate, there were decades of economic growth throughout the region, particularly after a wave of revolts in 1816–1817. They had significant trade over the trans-Saharan routes.

After the Fulani War, all land in the empire was declared waqf or owned by the entire community. However, the Sultan allocated land to individuals or families, as could an emir. Such land could be inherited by family members but could not be sold. Exchange was based largely on slaves, cowries or gold. Major crops produced included cotton, indigo, kola and shea nuts, grain, rice, tobacco, and onion.

Considerable numbers of scholars and the poor depended on the &quot;great houses&quot; for basic amenities like food and clothing. Food was prepared in the houses, which then acted like communal canteens. Clothing came largely from the payments from the other emirates in the caliphate and was redistributed to the community. This system helped Sokoto maintain a large scholar community.

Its commercial prosperity was also based on Islamic traditions, market integration, internal peace and an extensive export-trade network.

==Slavery==

Slavery remained a large part of the economy, although its operation had changed with the end of the Atlantic slave trade. Slaves were gained through raiding and via markets as had operated earlier in West Africa. The founder of the Caliphate allowed slavery only for non-Muslims; slavery was viewed as a process to bring such peoples into the Muslim community. At least half of the Caliphate&#x27;s population were enslaved people in the nineteenth century. There was a huge expansion of slaves due to the jihad campaigns, frontier wars and slave raids. The expansion of agricultural plantations under the Caliphate was dependent on slave labor. These plantations were established around the ribats, and large areas of agricultural production took place around the cities of the empire. The institution of slavery was mediated by the lack of a racial barrier among the peoples, and by a complex and varying set of relations between owners and slaves, which included the right to accumulate property by working on their own plots, manumission, and the potential for slaves to convert and become members of the Islamic community. There are historical records of slaves reaching high levels of government and administration in the Sokoto Caliphate. On the other hand these liniments to the slaving system were, like those in other slave societies, a buttress rather than a detriment although in some cases undoubtedly beneficial to individual slaves as Mohammed Bashir Salau writes: &quot;Unfortunately for most slaves, however, masters often selected those they granted freedom in part because to maintain the plantation order, and in part to prevent the formation of a group consciousness among slaves...Similarly, although the Islamic religion encouraged voluntary emancipation, and slave-owners were convinced that God would reward them when they freed slaves, most masters were very selective about whom they freed. They often gave first preference to slaves who exhibited “good behavior” and were “honest” and “hardworking”; also to those who were “too sick” and “too old” (to engage in rigorous plantation activities). This not only perpetuated the plantation’s social order, but also reduced the slave-owner’s expenditures; by freeing elderly and infirm slaves, the owner did not have to pay for their care.&quot;

Indeed the incorrigible slave would have the worst treatment visited upon them by the state slave prison system. In 1829 Bain Hugh Clapperton wrote: &quot;In this space is also the prison, a building of about eighty feet long, and nearly the same in breadth, covered at top with a flat clay roof, overlaid with boughs. Inside is a deep pit, where those who have committed the greatest crimes are confined. No person is put in prison for debt; only thieves, prisoners of war (taken singly), such as spies, and disobedient slaves, who, on a complaint to the sultan that they will not work, are sent to prison. Their only food is the bran or husks of millet and dourra, with water; but their friends are allowed to give them food, if they have any. It is a filthy place, and the terror of the men-slaves of Soccatoo. The prisoners are taken out, two and two, every day to work at the walls, or any laborious work which may occur.&quot; &quot;In the Kano area, for instance, Gidan Ma’ajin Watari was the primary slave prison.&quot; If not desiring sale the slave-owner would lay out the particular charge and &quot;Thereafter, the erring slave was admitted into the facility through a succession of two doors, being severely beaten in the process.&quot; Frederick John Dealtry Lugard, 1st Baron Lugard in a 1903 colonial account wrote thusly about conditions: &quot;I visited the dungeon myself. A small doorway 2 feet 6 inches by 1 foot 6 inches gives access into it. The interior is divided (by a thick mud wall with a similar hole through it) into two compartments, each 17 feet by 7 feet and 11 feet high. This wall was pierced with holes at its base through which the legs of those sentenced to death were thrust up to the thigh, and they were left to be trodden on by the mass of other prisoners till they died of thirst and starvation. The place is entirely air-tight and unventilated except for the one small doorway, or rather hole, in the wall through which you creep. The total space inside is 2,618 cubic feet, and at the time we took Kano 135 human beings were confined here each night, being let out during the day to cook their food, &amp;c., in a small adjoining area. Recently as many as 200 have been interned at one time. As the superficial ground area was only 238 square feet there was not, of course, even standing room. Victims were crushed to death every night and their corpses were hauled out each morning. The stench, I am told, inside the place when Colonel Morland visited it was intolerable, though it was empty, and when I myself went inside three weeks later the effluvium was unbearable for more than a few seconds. A putrid corpse even then lay near the doorway.&quot; Salau adds that &quot;While in prison, a slave was usually subjected to torture by fellow inmates as well as by guards...Ultimately, it was the master who decided how many days the slave would spend in the facility.&quot;

In the early twentieth-century, the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria inherited one of the biggest slave populations in the world, one to two and a half million slaves, a flourishing slave trade supplied by slave raids and thousands of slaves given as tributes to the Sultan of Sokoto and his emirs. The British high commissioner Lugard abolished the legal status of slavery without compensation and officially declared all children born to slaves after 31 March 1901 as born free; however the slaves were given no assistance and cases of fugitive slaves were often handed over to indigenous Islamic sharia courts, which often restored them back to their Muslim owners. By the 1920s big slave trade caravans had been eradicated by the colonial officials, but small scale slave trading was difficult to fully abolish. One example was the trade in Adamawa girls, who were bought by merchants and kept for a year in Cameroon learning Hausa until they could be smuggled in to Nigeria to be sold in Kano for concubinage or domestic service. &quot;Slave brokers, who themselves were formerly concubines, were procuring young girls for purposes of sale into slavery. Despite legal prohibitions which dated from the colonial era to the contrary, slave concubinage was a functioning institution in the northern states of Nigeria in 1988.&quot;

Even in the early twenty-first century the practice of wahaya (taking a &quot;fifth wife&quot;) still existed in parts of Niger and the Sultanate of Sokoto:
==Culture==
The Fulani ruling class engaged in marriage alliances with Hausa families. The Hausa language became the language of administration and main medium of poetry in the caliphate.

==Legacy==

Although it has lost its former political power, the Sokoto Sultanate Council continues to exist, and the Sokoto Sultans are still &quot;leading figures in Nigerian society&quot;. Even the Presidents of Nigeria have sought their support.

Due to its impact, the Sokoto Caliphate is also revered by Islamists in modern Nigeria. For example, the Jihadist militant group Ansaru has vowed to revive the Sokoto Caliphate in order to restore the &quot;lost dignity of Muslims in black Africa&quot;.

The influence of the Sokoto Caliphate can also be seen in extremist groups like Boko Haram. Boko Haram, based in northeastern Nigeria, promotes an extremist interpretation of Islam and seeks to establish an Islamic state governed by strict Sharia law. While they have occasionally referenced Usman dan Fodio&#x27;s legacy to justify their actions, presenting their struggle as a continuation of the original jihad, there are fundamental differences between the two jihadist movements. The Sokoto Jihad&#x27;s intellectual thought, according to historian Michael Cook, can be described as part of the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries Islamic world&#x27;s &quot;conservative orientation towards intellectual innovation&quot;. The three leaders of the jihad, namely Usman, Abdullahi and Bello, drew heavily from Maliki and Qadriyya texts, with connections to wider Islamic intellectual networks. In contrast, Boko Haram operates in a globalized world and draws influences from Salafi and Wahhabi ideology and is connected and influenced by global Salafi jihadist networks.

Boko Haram operates primarily in Borno State, and the historical context of the state, which is the central fragment of the old Kanem-Bornu empire of the Kanuri people, has effects today. Bornu, led by Shaikh al-Kanemi, had a history of resistance against the Sokoto jihad and actively opposed the encroachment and ideology of the caliphate. There were intense debates and correspondence between Bello and al-Kanemi during the jihad, reflecting their differing perspectives. While the Sokoto Caliphate had limited success in fully subjugating Bornu, Boko Haram, founded by Muhammad Yusuf and later led by Shekau, emerged from the Kanuri community. Their ideology criticized the established Islamic tradition of the Sokoto Caliphate, considering it impure and in need of reform. They sought to return to what they perceived as more orthodox practices based on Salafi thought, rejecting the Maliki law and Sufi influences of the Sokoto Caliphate. Influential Salafi scholars in Nigeria critique Boko Haram, highlighting their leaders&#x27; lack of proper education in fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and their misinterpretation and misuse of Salafi texts. This is in contrast to the Sokoto jihad leaders who were renowned Maliki scholars, with Usman and Abdullahi already being respected scholars prior to the jihad.

<text>George Francis Rayner Ellis, FRS, Hon. FRSSAf (born 11 August 1939), is the emeritus distinguished professor of complex systems in the Department of Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. He co-authored &quot;The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time&quot; with University of Cambridge physicist Stephen Hawking, published in 1973, and is considered one of the world&#x27;s leading theorists in cosmology. From 1989 to 1992 he served as president of the International Society on General Relativity and Gravitation. He is a past president of the International Society for Science and Religion. He is an A-rated researcher with the NRF.

Ellis, an active Quaker, was a vocal opponent of apartheid during the National Party reign in the 1970s and 1980s, and it is during this period that Ellis&#x27;s research focused on the more philosophical aspects of cosmology, for which he won the Templeton Prize in 2004. He was also awarded the Order of the Star of South Africa by Nelson Mandela in 1999. On 18 May 2007, he was elected a fellow of the British Royal Society.

==Life==
Born in 1939 to George Rayner Ellis, a newspaper editor, and Gwendoline Hilda MacRobert Ellis in Johannesburg, George Francis Rayner Ellis attended the University of Cape Town, where he graduated with honours in 1960 with a Bachelor of Science degree in physics with distinction. He represented the university in fencing, rowing and flying.

While a student at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he received a PhD in applied maths and theoretical physics in 1964, he was on college rowing teams.

At Cambridge, Ellis served as a research fellow from 1965 to 1967, was assistant lecturer in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics until 1970, and was then appointed university lecturer, serving until 1974.

Ellis became a visiting professor at the Enrico Fermi Institute at the University of Chicago in 1970, a lecturer at the Cargese Summer School in Corsica in 1971 and the Erice Summer School in Sicily in 1972, and a visiting H3 professor at the University of Hamburg, also in 1972.

The following year, Ellis co-wrote &quot;The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time&quot; with Stephen Hawking, debuting at a strategic moment in the development of General Relativity Theory.

In the following year, Ellis returned to South Africa to accept an appointment as professor of applied mathematics at the University of Cape Town, a position he held until his retirement in 2005.

In 2005 Ellis appeared as a guest speaker at the Nobel Conference in St. Peter, Minnesota.

==Work==
George Ellis has worked for many decades on anisotropic cosmologies (Bianchi models) and inhomogeneous universes, and on the philosophy of cosmology. He is currently writing on the emergence of complexity, and the way this is enabled by top-down causation in the hierarchy of complexity. Recently Ellis has also collaborated with Teppo Felin, Denis Noble, and Jan Koenderink on a set of articles published in the journal &quot;Genome Biology.&quot; In terms of philosophy of science, Ellis is a Platonist.

<doc id="840530" wikidata="Q1004347" url="?curid=840530" title="3,000 strikeout club">
<text>In Major League Baseball (MLB), the 3,000 strikeout club is the group of 19 pitchers who have struck out 3,000 or more batters in their careers. Walter Johnson became the first member in 1923, and was the only one until Bob Gibson joined in 1974. The most recent addition is Max Scherzer, who joined on September 12, 2021. The group includes three left-handed pitchers: CC Sabathia, Steve Carlton, and Randy Johnson. Randy Johnson reached the mark with the fewest games pitched and innings pitched. The Minnesota Twins were the first of four franchises to see multiple pitchers record their 3,000th strikeout: Walter Johnson (while the franchise was called the Washington Senators) in 1923 and Bert Blyleven in 1986. The other teams with multiple members are the Chicago Cubs (Ferguson Jenkins and Greg Maddux), the New York Yankees (Phil Niekro and Sabathia), and the Houston Astros (Nolan Ryan and Justin Verlander). César Gerónimo is the only player struck out by two pitchers for their 3,000th strikeout: Gibson in 1974 and Ryan in 1980. Ten 3,000-strikeout pitchers are also members of the 300-win club. Seven members were named to the All-Century Team, a list of MLB&#x27;s best 100 players; fans later elected four of them as starters. All members of the club except for Ryan, Blyleven, Don Sutton, Walter Johnson, Niekro, and Curt Schilling also won a Cy Young Award in their careers. 

The club is considered to almost be a guarantee of entry into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Fifteen members of the 3,000-strikeout club have been elected to the Hall, most recently Sabathia during the 2025 balloting. Two more members - Scherzer and Verlander - are not yet eligible for election, as both players are currently active. The remaining two, Roger Clemens and Schilling, made their first appearances on the ballot for the elections and received over 50% of the total votes before falling off the ballot in 2022. Clemens&#x27; future election is seen as uncertain because of his alleged links to use of performance-enhancing drugs.

<text>Herodian or Herodianus () of Syria, sometimes referred to as &quot;Herodian of Antioch&quot; (c. 170 – c. 240), was a minor Roman civil servant who wrote a colourful history in Greek titled &quot;History of the Empire from the Death of Marcus&quot; (τῆς μετὰ Μάρκον βασιλείας ἱστορία) in eight books covering the years 180 to 238. His work is not considered entirely reliable, although his less biased account of Elagabalus may be more useful than that of Cassius Dio. Herodian himself may have been a Syrian (perhaps from Antioch), though he appears to have lived for a considerable period of time in Rome, possibly without holding any public office. From his extant work, it seems that he was still living at an advanced age during the reign of Gordianus III, who ascended the throne in 238. Beyond this, nothing is known of his life.

Herodian writes (1.1.3; 2.15.7) that the events described in his history occurred during his lifetime. Photius (Codex 99) gives an outline of the contents of this work and passes a flattering encomium on the style of Herodian, which he describes as clear, vigorous, agreeable, and preserving a happy medium between an utter disregard of art and elegance and a profuse employment of the artifices and prettinesses which were known under the name of Atticism, as well as between boldness and bombast. He appears to have used Thucydides as a model to some extent, both for style and for the general composition of his work, often introducing speeches wholly or in part imaginary. 

==Birth, life, and death==
The dates of the birth and death of Herodian are unknown. All available information concerning his life is derived from what he himself wrote, so the evidence is scarce. One can assume that he must have reached the age of ten by the year 180 due to the attentive detail in his descriptions of the events of that time. One notion is that Herodian must have finished writing around 240, which would have made him about 70. He mentions, “My aim is to write a systematic account of the events within a period of seventy years, covering the reigns of several emperors, of which I have personal experience.” (2.15.7) This reaffirms the notion that Herodian was about 70 years of age when this was written and that the actions did indeed occur during his lifetime. However, it is possible that his history was composed at a later date. Herodian&#x27;s descriptions of Gordian III are less than flattering, and it is doubtful that he released such a negative review of a current emperor. Following this logic, his history was finished in 244 at the earliest, when Gordian III died. In his first and third books, Herodian mentions the games of Commodus in 192, and the Secular Games of Septimius Severus in 204. If Herodian attended the games of Commodus, he had been at least 14 at the time, which is to say that he was born in 178 at the latest.

The nationality of Herodian is also unclear. He was not from Italy, for he says the Alps were bigger than anything “in our part of the world.” (2.11.8) It has been suggested that Herodian was from Alexandria since he placed such a large emphasis on Caracalla&#x27;s massacre of this city and its inhabitants. It is also believed that he could have possibly been an eyewitness to these attacks. Herodian does refer to Alexandria as the second city of the empire; however, this may be disregarded since he also applies the same title to Antioch and Carthage. It has been proposed that Herodian was the son of Aelius Herodianus, an Alexandrian grammarian. Although this does fit chronologically, there is no other evidence to support it. The popular speculation, however, is that Herodian was from Antioch. Herodian describes the character of the Syrians as quick-witted and mentions them twice more. However, there are also gaps in Herodian&#x27;s knowledge of Syrian affairs which lead one to believe that he might not have been from the region at all. For example, he confuses two Parthian kings, and his chronology and geography of the Parthian campaign in 197–198 are deeply flawed. These flaws could be explained with a lack of knowledge of a small part of the empire; however, one would assume that an inhabitant of Syria would have had access to this knowledge. In short, unless an inscription is discovered, Herodian&#x27;s place of birth will never be known for certain.

===Occupation and social status===
Neither the occupation nor the social status of Herodian is known. Herodian mentions, “I have written a history of the events following the death of Marcus which I saw and heard in my lifetime. I had a personal share in some of these events during my imperial and public service.” (1.2.5) It has been suggested that Herodian was a senator due to his knowledge of the &quot;senatus consultum tacitum&quot;, which was a secret declaration by the senate when they chose the emperors Pupienus and Balbinus. However, it is also stated that news of this was leaked by some senators, and it certainly would not have remained a secret for the entirety of Herodian&#x27;s lifetime. It is possible, however, that Herodian was a freedman. This fits the profile perfectly, for he would not have cared for the larger political issues, and instead, would have concentrated on personalities and intricacies. Still yet, Herodian could have been an &quot;apparitor&quot;, a scribe or an attendant to the emperor. This would be suiting, for he would have had access to senatorial documents, traveled extensively, and been knowledgeable in the field of fiscal affairs, which Herodian repetitively stressed in his history.

==The &quot;Roman History&quot;==

Herodian&#x27;s &quot;Roman History&quot; is a collection of eight books covering the period from the death of Marcus Aurelius in 180 AD to the beginning of Gordian III&#x27;s reign in 238. It provides a first person account of one of the most politically diverse times of the Roman Empire. The first book describes the reign of Commodus from 180 to 192, and the second discusses the Year of the Five Emperors in 193. Book Three encompasses the reign of Septimius Severus from 193 to 211, while the fourth discusses the reign of Caracalla from 211 to 217. Book Five is about the reign of Elagabalus from 218 through 222, and Book Six deals with the reign of Severus Alexander from 222 to 235. The seventh book recounts the reign of Maximinus Thrax from 235 to 238, and the final one describes the Year of the Six Emperors in 238. Most likely, Herodian is writing for an eastern audience, for he often explains different Roman customs and beliefs that would have seemed foreign to Easterners.

Herodian has been both praised and criticized by scholars. The first person on record to review Herodian is the ninth-century patriarch of Constantinople, Photius. Photius wrote of Herodian: &quot;he neither exaggerates with hyperbole nor omits anything essential; in short, in all the virtues of historiography there are few men who are his superior.” Zosimus used him as a source as did John of Antioch when writing his &quot;World Chronicle&quot;. An English translator of the &quot;Roman History&quot; wrote in 1705 that Herodian &quot;still preserves a Majesty suitable to the Greatness of the Subject which he treats, and has something in him so pleasing and comely, as perhaps all the Art and Labour of other Men can never reach.” Altheim commended Herodian&#x27;s wide vision of the period, and F.A. Wolf acclaimed Herodian&#x27;s lack of bias and superstition. However, not all views of Herodian are positive. For example, Wolf also charged Herodian with a deficiency in critical faculty. While the author of the Historia Augusta drew from Herodian, he also censured him for bias, and Herodian was by no means Zosimus’ first choice. Similarly, Joannes Zonaras only utilized Herodian where Cassius Dio&#x27;s history leaves off.

Herodian has long been criticized for a lack of historical accuracy, but recent studies have tended to side with him, legitimizing his historical facts. In the second book, Herodian states that his intention was to “narrate only the most important and conclusive…actions separately and in chronological order.” (2.15.7) Because of this, Herodian sometimes conflates a large number of events into a single reference or two. For example, all of Caracalla&#x27;s campaign in the north during 213 through 214 is condensed into two short allusions. Similarly, a single reference to a winter in Sirmium sums up Maximinus’ battles on the Rhine and Danube in 236 through 238. Herodian also occasionally falls short in his descriptions of geography. He confuses Arabia Scenite with Arabia Felix and claims that Issus was where the final battle and capture of Darius III took place.

In regard to Cassius Dio, both he and Herodian admittedly make many errors in their histories. Dio is credited as the expert when it comes to the senate; however, Herodian challenges Dio on his description of the people&#x27;s reaction to the proclamation of Septimius Severus as their new emperor. Dio&#x27;s work is not always the more accurate of the two and must not be immediately chosen over Herodian&#x27;s.

<text>Codename Eagle is a first-person shooter video game developed by Refraction Games and published by Take-Two Interactive and TalonSoft. &quot;Codename Eagle&quot; was released initially in the United Kingdom in November 1999, and later in North America in March 2000.

In 2000, DICE acquired Refraction Games and inherited the in-development &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot;. &quot;Codename Eagle&quot; is considered a spiritual predecessor to &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot;.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Codename Eagle&quot; is an open-world first-person shooter with drivable land, air and sea vehicles. In multiplayer mode, the players can battle in one of three modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and Capture the Flag.

==Plot==
The game is set in an alternate timeline, centered around events starting in Petrograd, Russia in 1917. World War I and the 1917 October Revolution never happened. Germany has yet to become involved with any of the other world powers. The story starts when Tsar Nicholas of the Russian Empire is betrayed by one of his closest friends, General Popov. One night, Popov sends assassins to kill the Tsar and the rest of the Royal Family to ensure that there are absolutely no living heirs to the throne of Russia. Popov would later cover up the murder by addressing the Russian people that a &quot;terrible accident had befallen the Royal Family&quot;. The villainous general then later presents Lieutenant Oleg to the people of Russia as the &quot;sole surviving son of Tsar Nicholas: Prince Alexander&quot; and has Oleg crowned as the new Tsar.

Unknown to Popov, Colonel Sergei of the Army Staff somehow managed to overhear the General&#x27;s plans, and he immediately rescues two children from the doomed family: the real Prince Alexander and Princess Anastasia, who earlier was &quot;shot and left for dead, somehow managing to survive&quot;. It is unknown how Anastasia managed to still be in Russia, but Sergei arranges Dr. Meier of the famous Russian Scientific Institute to hypnotize Prince Alexander to temporarily erase his memory of his real heritage and replace it with that of a &quot;farm boy who grew up in the countryside of England&quot;. This is a precaution to save Alexander from giving himself away as the true son of Tsar Nicholas. Meanwhile, with Oleg as a fake Tsar, General Popov, who is hell-bent on world domination, manages to take over almost all of Europe, throwing the continent into a bloody war. Soon, all free nations of the world form an alliance known as &quot;Shadow Command&quot; to rebel against the evil might of the Russian Empire.

Ten years later, in 1927, Prince Alexander (with his temporary memory) has grown up to become &quot;Agent Red&quot; of Shadow Command, and he is assigned the most difficult missions that the alliance has to offer. He is also the only playable character in the game. Red&#x27;s main friends who fight on his side are Captain Potter, his instructor for his missions, the female &quot;Agent Goggles&quot;, and the male &quot;Agent Mortar&quot;. The main goal of Shadow Command is to defeat the Russian Empire, using whatever means possible to defeat the Russian war machine from within.

Along the way, Red meets up with Colonel Sergei, who he at first mistakes for an enemy officer, but later listens to the Colonel as he is told of his true heritage. Red has a hard time believing this story, but he soon starts having frequent flashbacks of his real family being murdered by General Popov&#x27;s henchmen as a result of this. Red rescues Dr. Meier, who soon reveals the whole story of his true heritage and restores his memory back to normal. With his memory restored, Red soon meets up with his sister Anastasia. At first, Red/Alexander was to be the new Tsar of Russia, but now, his mind&#x27;s made up, asking his sister to address the Russian people and reveal the truth about General Popov and his evil actions against their family and take the throne, becoming Tsarina of Russia. At first, Anastasia disagrees with him, but her brother says to her that his destiny now &quot;lies with Shadow Command. I&#x27;m sworn to them, and must honor my promise&quot;. Following this chat, Red soon seeks out the last remains of an Allied spy airship mission that was forced down in the Alps to retrieve secret document from it.

When he gets there, Red finds Agent Mortar alive and well, now a traitor who&#x27;s turned against Shadow Command. Mortar stole the documents earlier, even set Red up at an earlier point when Red saved Dr. Meier, who warned him of his friends. After a brief confrontation of his old friend, Mortar tries unsuccessfully to deliver the Allied documents to General Popov, but Red manages to stop him from getting away. Following this, Red finally reaches the Tsar&#x27;s palace but not before disarming a doomsday device on a train on the way there. When he gets there, he finds the fake Tsar Oleg and manages (with some difficulty) to eliminate him. While dying, Oleg reveals to Red that General Popov is headed for London with another Doomsday Device in a double-structured Zeppelin.

Following this, in the last level of the game, Red then reaches the destination of Popov&#x27;s Zeppelin on board the British aircraft carrier HMS York. First, Red has to man the AA guns on the carrier to defend the carrier against the fighter-bomber escorts of the Zeppelin. After this threat is dealt with, Popov&#x27;s Zeppelin (escorted by two more zeppelins) enters the area. Red then takes off in his plane to shoot down the Zeppelin to avenge his murdered family. After a real difficult battle, the General&#x27;s Zeppelin is shot down. Popov tries to escape in another Russian bomber, which Red shoots down, killing the evil man who had killed his family ten years earlier. The world is saved, and Russia is now under rule of Tsarina Anastasia. Most online sources cover up the true story and say that the main villain is Pietre instead of Popov, whose father died earlier.

== Reception ==
The game received mixed reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings.

According to former DICE employee Sean Decker, the game sold about 20,000 units.

<text>Fritz Kortner (born Fritz Nathan Kohn, 12 May 1892 – 22 July 1970) was an Austrian stage and film actor and theatre director.

==Life and career==

Kortner was born in Vienna as Fritz Nathan Kohn into a Jewish family. He studied at the Vienna Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. After graduating, he joined Max Reinhardt in Berlin in 1911 and then Leopold Jessner in 1916. After his breakthrough performance in Ernst Toller&#x27;s &quot;Transfiguration&quot; in 1919, he became one of Germany&#x27;s best-known character actors and the nation&#x27;s foremost performer of Expressionist works. He also appeared in over ninety films beginning in 1916.

His specialty was in playing sinister and threatening roles, although he also appeared in the title role of &quot;Dreyfus&quot; (1930). He originally gained attention for his explosive energy on stage and his powerful voice; but as the 1920s progressed, his work began to incorporate greater realism, as he opted for a more controlled delivery and greater use of gestures.

With the coming to power of the Nazis, Kortner fled Germany in 1933 with his wife, actress Johanna Hofer, returning first to his native Vienna and, from there, on to Great Britain, and finally, in 1937, to the United States, where he found work as a character actor and theater director.

He returned to West Germany in 1949, where he became noted for his innovative staging and direction of classics by William Shakespeare and Molière, such as a &quot;Richard III&quot; (1964) in which the king crawls over piles of corpses at the finale.

==Death==
Kortner died at Munich in 1970, aged 78, of leukemia.

<text>Kodungallur (; formerly also called as Cranganore (anglicised name), Portuguese: Cranganor; Mahodayapuram, Shingly, Vanchi, Muchiri, Muyirikkode, and [[Muziris]]) is a historically significant town situated on the banks of river Periyar on the Malabar Coast in Thrissur district of Kerala, India. It is north of Kochi (Cochin) by National Highway 66 and from Thrissur. Kodungallur, being a port city at the northern end of the Kerala lagoons, was a strategic entry point for the naval fleets to the extensive Kerala backwaters.

As of the 2011 India Census, Kodungallur Municipality had a population of 33,935. It had an average literacy rate of 95.10%. Around 64% of the population follows Hinduism, 32% Islam and 4% Christianity. Schedule Caste (SC) constitutes 7.8% while Schedule Tribe (ST) were 0.1% of total population in Kodungallur.

Kodungallur is the headquarters of the Kodungallur sub-district (tehsil) in Thrissur district. Kodungallur Kerala Legislative Assembly constituency is a part of Chalakudi Lok Sabha Constituency. Kodungallur is well connected to other towns in Kerala through the road network. Aluva Railway Station in Ernakulam district () is the major railway station near Kodungallur.

Fort Cranganore (Fortaleza São Tomé), known locally as Kottappuram Fort, was constructed in Kodungallur by Portuguese in 1523. The fort was enlarged in 1565, and passed into the hands of the Dutch in 1663. Thiruvanchikulam Mahadeva Temple, dedicated to the god Siva, is one of the major Siva temples in South India. Siva in the Thiruvanchikulam Temple was the patron deity of the Chera Perumals of Kerala and remains the family deity of the Cochin Royal Family. Kodungallur Bhagavathy Temple is a Hindu temple at Kodungallur dedicated to the goddess Bhadrakali, a form of Mahakali or simply Durga or Aadi Parashakthi worshipped and significantly revered in Kerala. The goddess is known also by the names &quot;Sri Kurumba&quot;&quot; (The Mother of Kodungallur). This temple is the head of 64 Bhadrakali temples in Kerala and is one of the oldest functioning temples in India.

It was here that one of Jesus&#x27;s disciples, St. Thomas reached during 1st century AD to preach Christianity.

The first case of COVID-19 in India was reported at Kodungallur in a medical student who returned from Wuhan University.

==Etymology==

Origin of the modern name &#x27;Kodungallur&#x27; has multiple interpretations: 
*From &quot;koṭuṁ-kall-ūr&quot;, meaning &#x27;place of the grand stone&#x27; in Old Tamil, because of a huge stone that the Chera king Cheran Chenguttuvan brought from the Himalayas to establish a shrine dedicated to the legendary Tamil woman Kannagi. 
*From &quot;koṭuṁ-kōl-ūr&quot;, meaning the &#x27;city of good governance&#x27;. (&#x27;kōl&#x27; literally means a sceptre)
*From &quot;koṭuṁ-kāḷi-ūr&quot; because of the existence of temple dedicated to goddess Kali. 
*From &quot;koṭuṁ-kolai-ūr&quot;, meaning a &#x27;bloody killing field&#x27;, because of a 16th-century battle between Zamorin of Calicut and Kingdom of Cochin which was fought here.
In the medieval period (from c. ninth century CE), Kondungallur was part of the city of Makothai Vanchi (Sanskrit: &quot;Mahodaya Pura&quot;, Malayalam: &quot;Mahodaya Puram&quot;). It was the seat of the Kerala branch of the Chera clan, the Perumals, for about three hundred years. 
Kodungallur is well known in ancient times due to trade, and also due to the Baghavathy kshethram, and as well as the seat of Kannagi&#x27;s resting place in the ksethram, after she burns down the capital of the Pandya rulers Madurai, who falsely accuse her husband of stealing the anklet of the royal Queen. This is steeped in the folklore of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, which is evident in the temple festivals, and has it roots in Dharma, which the Pandya ruler failed to follow, and incurs the wrath of the chaste Kannagi. This is also the story of the classical Tamil epic Chilappatikaram, written by royal born, but later turned ascetic Ilango Adigal, brother of the Chera King Sengottuvan. It was also known as Muchiri Pattanam, Muyirikkode, Mahavanchimana Pattanam, and Thrikulasekarapuram.

Kodungallur was also known as Jangli, Gingaleh, Cyngilin, Shinkali, Chinkli, Jinkali, Shenkala, and Cynkali, which are all derived from the name of the River Changala (or the Chain River, i.e., &quot;Shrinkhala&quot; in Sanskrit), a tributary of the Periyar.

==History==
===Early historic harbour ===

Scholars believe that Muziris, an ancient harbour located on the mouth of Periyar, coincides with modern-day Kodungallur. Central Kerala and western Tamil Nadu in early historic south India was ruled by the Chera line of rulers. 

The harbour was visited by navigators from all over the world, especially from the Mediterranean world. The Roman Empire had a continuous trading connection with the West Coast of India. Along with spices (black pepper), commodities including pearls, muslin, ivory, diamonds, silk and perfumes were acquired by the sailors from central Kerala.
A traditional belief among the Saint Thomas Christians in Kerala is that Thomas the Apostle landed in or around Kodungallur in the middle of the first century CE and founded Seven Churches: Kodungallur, Niranam, Nilackal (Chayal), Kokkamangalam, Kottakkavu, Palayoor and Kollam.

According to Kerala Muslim tradition, Kodungallur was home to the oldest mosque in the Indian subcontinent. According to the Legend of Cheraman Perumals, the first Indian mosque was built in 624 AD at Kodungallur with the mandate of the last the ruler (the Cheraman Perumal) of Chera dynasty, who left from Dharmadom to Mecca and converted to Islam during the lifetime of Muhammad (c. 570–632). According to &quot;Qissat Shakarwati Farmad&quot;, the &quot;Masjids&quot; at Kodungallur, Kollam, Madayi, Barkur, Mangalore, Kasaragod, Kannur, Dharmadam, Panthalayini, and Chaliyam, were built during the era of Malik Dinar, and they are among the oldest &quot;Masjid&quot;s in the Indian subcontinent. It is believed that Malik Dinar died at Thalangara in Kasaragod town.

Sometime between the fourth and eighth century, the Knanaya Community is believed to have arrived from the Middle East under the leadership of the Syrian merchant Thomas of Cana. The community settled on the southern side of Cranganore and eventually established three churches in the names of St. Thomas, St. Kuriakose, and St. Mary. The Knanaya left their settlement after its destruction during a battle between the Kingdom of Cochin and Zamorin of Calicut in the 16th century.

According to one tradition, a Cochin Jew colony in Malabar Coast, probably established before the sixth century BCE, attracted the Apostle to this region.

=== Medieval port of Kodungallur ===
The economic and political prestige of the harbour of Kodungallur remained even in medieval South India. Sulaiman, a West Asian visitor to India during this period, recorded the &quot;economic prosperity&quot; of the region. Also, he describes the Chinese traders in the city; they are described as purchasing articles such as spices (pepper and cinnamon), ivory, pearls, cotton fabrics and teak wood.

The port was sacked by the Chola rulers in the 11th century CE.
After the dissolution of the Chera Perumal rule (early 12th century CE), Kodungallur emerged as a principality, named Padinjattedathu Swaroopam, under the control of the royal family of Kodungallur Kovilakam. The city state was &quot;allied&quot; either to the kingdom of Cochin (Kochi) or to Calicut (Kozhikode).

It is postulated that the harbour at Kodungallur was devastated by natural calamities—a flood or an earthquake—in 1341, and consequently lost its commercial/strategic importance thereafter. Consequently, the trade got diverted to other ports of the Malabar Coast, such as Cochin (Kochi) and Calicut (Kozhikode). It is speculated that the floods split the left branch of the River Periyar into two, just before the town of Aluva. The flood silted the right branch (known as the River Changala) and the natural harbour at the mouth of the river to make it poorly navigable for large vessels.

===Portuguese era===

Portuguese navigators began operating in South India from the early 16th century CE. During this period, Kodungallur was a &quot;tributary state&quot; of the kingdom of Kozhikode (Calicut) of Zamorins (Samoothiris). Since Kodungallur was sandwiched between the kingdom of Kozhikode and the kingdom of Kochi, it was a matter of frequent dispute for both the kings. The chieftain of Kodungallur often switched allegiance from one king to another.

The Portuguese spice trade was challenged by the kings of Kozhikode in the Indian Ocean. The port of Kodungallur had a sizeable Jewish, native Christian and Muslim population at the time. Portuguese Company extended their aggression on Calicut to allied coastal city-states, including Kodungallur. The port was almost completely destroyed by the Portuguese (Suarez de Menezes) on 1 September 1504.

Kodungallur, being a port city at the northern end of the Vembanad lagoon, was a strategic entry point for Zamorin&#x27;s army and fleet into the Kerala backwaters. Hence, in October 1504 Zamorin dispatched a force to fortify Kodungallur. Reading this movement as a preparation for a renewed attack on Kochi, the Portuguese commander, Lopo Soares, ordered a preemptive strike. A squadron of around ten fighting ships, accompanied by numerous fighting boats from Kochi, headed up to Kodungallur. The heavier ships, unable to make their way into the shallow channels, anchored at Palliport (Pallipuram, on the outer edge of Vypin island), while the smaller frigates progressed to the destination.

Converging on Kodungallur, the Portuguese-Kochi fleet quickly dispersed the Calicut forces on the beach using cannons, and launched their composite army – some 1,000 Portuguese soldiers and 1,000 Nair warriors of Kochi – who took on the rest of the enemy force in Kodungallur. The assault troops captured and sacked the city of Kodungallur, and was set on fire by the squads led by Duarte Pacheco Pereira and Diogo Fernandes Correa. Nonetheless, according to some records, Portuguese arsonists spared the Saint Thomas Christian quarters in the city. (At the time the community was in a tenuous position: though thriving in the spice trade and protected by their own militia, the local political sphere was volatile and the Saint Thomas Christians had found themselves under pressure from the rajas of Calicut, Cochin and other small kingdoms in the area. Hence the community had sought an alliance with the Portuguese newcomers. Since they were one of the major suppliers of pepper in the region, the Portuguese also found the relationship reciprocating.) This might have helped the ancient Christian community of Kodungallur from extinction during the 1504 assault on the city.

====Calicut fleet====
The Calicut fleet, some five ships and 80 &quot;paraus&quot;, that had been dispatched to save the city was intercepted by the idling Portuguese ships near Palliport and defeated in a naval encounter. In the meantime, the raja of the Kingdom of Tanur (Vettattnad), whose kingdom lay to the north, on the road between Calicut and Kodungallur, and who had a spoiled relation with the Zamorin, offered to place himself under Portuguese suzerainty. It is recorded that the military of Calicut, which was led by Zamorin in person, was defeated on their way to Kodungallur by a sizeable Portuguese army with the assistance of the Tanur ruler.

The raid on Cranganore and the defection of the Tanur raja were serious setbacks to the Zamorin of Calicut, pushing the frontline north and effectively placing the Vembanad lagoon out of the Zamorin&#x27;s reach. The battle set the scene for Portuguese to expand their colonial authority over a significant area of the Malabar coast. By 1510, their fluid power in the Malabar coast solidified into a perceptible territorial entity.

In 1662, the Dutch entered the competition, sacked the Portuguese in a fortnightly war, with the help of Zamorin, and occupied Kodungallur. The Dutch took the control of Kodungallur fort in 1663 and it eventually protected southern Kerala, especially Travancore, from the Mysorean invasion in 1776. In 1786, Mysorean troops again marched to northern Kerala, but failed to progress ahead of Kodungallur. On 31 July 1789, the Dutch handed over their establishments in Kodungallur and Azhikode to the Kingdom of Travancore for 300,000 Surat silver rupees.

==Muziris Heritage Project==

The Muziris Heritage Project was launched by the Government of Kerala&#x27;s Department of Cultural Affairs in 2006 to &quot;scientifically retrieve and preserve the historical heritage of the region, extending from North Paravur to Kodungallur&quot;. The Kerala Council for Historical Research (KCHR), identified as the nodal agency for the Muziris Heritage Project, provides academic guidance and undertakes archaeological and historical research in the region.

<text>Chiasso (; ) is a municipality in the district of Mendrisio in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.

As the southernmost of Switzerland&#x27;s municipalities, Chiasso is on the border with Italy, in front of Ponte Chiasso (a frazione of Como, Italy). The municipality of Chiasso includes the villages of Boffalora, Pedrinate and Seseglio.

In 2007, the three mayors of Chiasso, Vacallo and Morbio Inferiore decided to unite into one commune. The new united commune with a population of ~15,300 people over a territory of , was rejected by the population in November 2007.

==History==
Chiasso is first mentioned in 1140 as &quot;Claso&quot;.

=== Chiasso (and Boffalora) ===

Historically, Chiasso and Boffalora were two distinct agricultural villages. Due to the nearby Italian border and customs office, and later as part of an access route to the St. Gotthard&#x27;s Tunnel, the two villages merged and grew.

Chiasso&#x27;s history and development were strongly influenced by its unique location. In its early history, a castle was built in Chiasso as part of the extended fortifications of the city of Como. It was a suburb of Como, until 1416 when it was incorporated into the Pieve of Balerna and given to the Rusca family to manage. The houses in the village centre were owned by the Albrici family and were granted imperial privileges. Chiasso had become an independent community sometime before 1552. In the contemporary documents, it is mentioned as &quot;Clasio tabernarum&quot; (Chiasso of taverns) referring to its function as a transit point.

Boffalora is mentioned in 1536 as a municipality and kept its independence until the second half of the 17th century. They became a single parish in either 1657 or 1677.

Chiasso&#x27;s church belonged to the Pieve of Zezio (in Como), from which it withdrew in the 16th century. In 1888, Boffalora separated from the parish. It became the seat of an archpriest in 1928. The Church of San Vitale, first mentioned in 1227, was rebuilt in 1934.

In the 15th century, Chiasso was known for its horse market. But the market ended after the invasion of the Swiss Confederation and the march through Chiasso in the War of the League of Cambrai in 1510. In the late 16th century, Chiasso had a smaller population than other municipalities of the Mendrisiotto valley. The village survived through its role as a border town (providing warehouses and inns) along with income from agriculture and paper mills. In the 19th century, tobacco and silk factories moved into the town.

The construction of the railway along with income from customs induced an economic and demographic recovery in Chiasso. In 1874 the railway line Lugano-Chiasso opened, followed in 1876 by one running to Como.

In 1910, the Mendrisio electric tramway opened, linking a northern terminus in Riva San Vitale with Capolago, Mendrisio, Balerna and Chiasso. The section of the line in Chiasso closed in 1950 and was replaced by a bus service.

Today, a large part of the town is devoted to Chiasso&#x27;s international railway station and related customs (though some of the border-control responsibilities have been moved to Como, in Italy). There is also a sizeable customs area for traffic passing by road and motorway (both commercial and non-commercial vehicles).

Chiasso offers also a lot of customs-related services. A considerable source of revenue for the town is Italians crossing the border to buy certain goods more cheaply in Switzerland, particularly cigarettes and petrol. It is also a banking centre for Italian clients wishing to keep money within the Swiss banking system.

Starting in 1950, Chiasso became an important financial centre and the economic centre of the Mendrisio region; hence rapid population growth. Since the 1980s, however, population and jobs, especially in the service sector, have shifted into neighbouring communities.

===The pedestrian zone===

From 2001 to 2005 a new pedestrian zone was created, from customs to the municipality building. An enlargement of this zone has been put on the agenda by the local administration, but a referendum on this issue is scheduled on 24 September 2006.

===Pedrinate===
Pedrinate was first mentioned in 1291 as &quot;Pedrenate&quot;, but Roman ruins near the village church indicate a much longer history. It was mentioned in 1335 as part of the village cooperative of Seseglio. The village church of S. Stefano is first mentioned in 1545 and was part of the Balerna parish until the 17th century.

Pedrinate municipality was aggregated in the Chiasso municipality in 1975, along with Seseglio. It is located above Chiasso, on the Penz hill. Pedrinate is the most southern village in Switzerland.

Around Pedrinate there are some vineyards.

===Seseglio===

<text>Clip art (also clipart, clip-art) is a type of graphic art. Pieces are pre-made images used to illustrate any medium. Today, clip art is used extensively and comes in many forms, both electronic and printed. However, most clip art today is created, distributed, and used in a digital form. Since its inception, clip art has evolved to include a wide variety of content, file formats, illustration styles, and licensing restrictions. It is generally composed exclusively of illustrations (created by hand or by computer software), and does not include stock photography.

== History ==
The term &quot;clipart&quot; originated from the practice of physically cutting images from pre-existing printed works for use in other publishing projects. Originally called &quot;printer&#x27;s cuts,&quot; &quot;stock cuts&quot; or &quot;electrotype cuts,&quot; before the advent of computers in desktop publishing, clip art was used through a process called paste up. Many clip art images of this era qualified as line art. In this process, the clip art images are cut out by hand from booklets or sheets sold by stock art studios or print companies (such as Dynamic Graphics or Volk Clip Art) and then attached via adhesives to a board representing a scale size of the finished, printed work. After the addition of text and art created through phototypesetting or dry-transfer lettering, the finished, camera-ready pages (called mechanicals) were sent to print.

Since the 1990s, nearly all publishers have replaced the paste up process with desktop publishing. After the introduction of mass-produced personal computers such as the IBM PC in 1981 and the Apple Macintosh in 1984, the widespread use of clip art by consumers became possible through the invention of desktop publishing. For the IBM PC, the first library of professionally drawn clip art was provided with VCN ExecuVision, introduced in 1983. These images were used in business presentations, as well as for other types of presentations. It was the Apple Computer, with its GUI which provided desktop publishing with the tools required to make it a reality for consumers. The LaserWriter laser printer (introduced in late 1985), as well as software maker Aldus PageMaker in 1985, helped to make professional quality desktop publishing a reality, with consumer desktop computers.

After 1986, desktop publishing generated a widespread need for pre-made, electronic images as consumers began to produce newsletters and brochures using their own computers. Electronic clip art emerged to fill the need. Early electronic clip art was simple line art or bitmap images due to the lack of sophisticated electronic illustration tools. With the introduction of the Apple Macintosh program MacPaint, consumers were provided the ability to edit and use bit-mapped clip art for the first time. One of the first successful electronic clip art pioneers was T/Maker Company, a Mountain View, California, company, which had its early roots with an alternative word processor WriteNow, commissioned for the Macintosh by Steve Jobs. Beginning in 1984, T/Maker took advantage of the capability of the Macintosh to provide bit-mapped graphics in black and white; by publishing small, retail collections of these images under the brand name &quot;ClickArt&quot;. The first version of &quot;ClickArt&quot; was a mixed collection of images designed for personal use. The illustrators who created the first &quot;serious&quot; clip art for business/organizational (professional) use were Mike Mathis, Joan Shogren, and Dennis Fregger; published by T/Maker in 1984 as &quot;ClickArt Publications&quot;.

In 1986, the first vector-based clip art disc was released by Composite, a small desktop publishing company based in Eureka, California. The black-and-white art was painstakingly created by Rick Siegfried with MacDraw, sometimes using hundreds of simple objects combined to create complex images. It was released on a single-sided floppy disc. Also in 1986, Adobe Systems introduced Adobe Illustrator for the Macintosh, allowing home computer users the first opportunity to manipulate vector art in a GUI. This made the higher-resolution vector art possible and in 1987 T/Maker published the first vector-based clip art images made with Illustrator, despite widespread unfamiliarity with the Bézier curves required to edit vector art. However, graphic designers and many consumers quickly realized the enormous advantages of vector art, and T/Maker&#x27;s clip art became the gold standard of the industry in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1994, T/Maker was sold to Deluxe Corp and then two years later to its main rival, Broderbund.

With the widespread adoption of the CD-ROM in the early 1990s, several pre-computer clip art companies such as Dover Publications also began offering electronic clip art.

The mid-1990s ushered in more innovation in the clip art industry, as well as a marketing focus on quantity over quality. Even T/Maker, whose success was built upon selling small, high-quality clip art packages of approximately 200 images, began to get interested in the volume clip art market. In March 1995, T/Maker became the exclusive publisher of over 500,000 copyright-free images which was, at the time, one of the world&#x27;s largest clip art libraries. This licensing agreement was subsequently transferred to Broderbund. In 1996, Zedcor (later rebranded to ArtToday, Inc. and then Clipart.com) was the first company to offer clip art images, illustrations, and photos for download as part of an online subscription. Also during this period, word processing companies, including Microsoft, began offering clip art as a built-in feature of their products. In 1996, Microsoft Word 6.0 included only 82 WMF clip art files as part of its default installation. In 2014, Microsoft offered clip art as part of over 140,000 media elements on the Microsoft Office website.

Other companies such as Nova Development and Clip Art Incorporated also pioneered the marketing of large clip art collections in the late 1990s, including Nova&#x27;s &quot;Art Explosion&quot; series, which sold clip art in increasingly large libraries up to a million images. Between 1998 and 2001, T/Maker&#x27;s clip art assets were sold each year as a result of some of the largest mergers and acquisitions in the computer software industry, including those of The Learning Company (in 1998) and Mattel (in 1999). All of T/Maker&#x27;s clip art is currently marketed through the Broderbund division of the Irish company Riverdeep.

In the early 2000s, the World Wide Web continued to gain popularity as a retail software distribution channel, and several other companies started to license clip art through online, searchable libraries, including iCLIPART.com (part of Vital Imagery Ltd.), WeddingClipart.com (part of Letters and Arts Incorporated), and GraphicsFactory.com (part of Clip Art Incorporated). Because of the Web, clip art is now not only sold through retail channels as packaged bundles of images, but also as individual images and subscriptions to entire libraries (which allow you to download an unlimited number of images for the duration of the subscription). In the mid-2000s, the clip art market is segmented in several different ways, including the data type, the art style, the delivery medium, and the marketing method.

On December 1, 2014, Microsoft officially ended its support for the online Clip Art library in Microsoft Office products. These programs now guide users to the Bing image search. Clip art is divided into two different data types represented by many different file formats: bitmap and vector art. Clip art vendors may provide images of just one type or both. The delivery medium of a clip art product varies from different types of traditionally boxed retail packages to online download sites. Clip art is sold via both traditional and web-based retail channels (as with Nova Development products), as well as via online, searchable libraries (as with Clipart.com). Clip art vendors typically market clip art by focusing either on quantity or vertical market specialty. The marketing method often goes hand in hand with the art style of the clip art sold. To compete largely on quantity, some clip art vendors must produce or license new and old clip art collections in volume. Clip art marketed in this way is often less expensive but simpler in structure and detail, as is typified by cartoons, line art, and symbols. Clip art which is sold according to smaller, specialized subject genres tends to be more complex, modern, detailed, and expensive.

== File formats ==
Electronic clip art is available in several different file formats. It is important for clip art users to understand the differences between file formats so that they can use an appropriate image file and get the resolution and detail results they need.

Clip art file formats are divided into 2 different types: bitmap or vector graphics. Bitmap (or &quot;rasterized&quot;) file formats are used to describe rectangular images made up of a grid of colored or grayscale pixels. Scanned photos, for example, make use of a bitmap file format. Bitmap images are always limited in quality by their resolution, which must be fixed at the time the file is created. If the image is not rectangular, then it is saved on a default background color (usually white) defined by the smallest bounding rectangle in which the image fits. Because of their fixed resolution, printing bitmap images can easily produce grainy, jaggy, or blurry results if the resolution is not ideally suited to the printer resolution. In addition, bitmap images become grainy when they are scaled larger than their intended resolution. A few bitmap file formats (such as Apple&#x27;s PICT format) support alpha channels, which allow bitmap images to have transparent backgrounds or an image selection which uses antialiasing. Most common web-based file formats such as GIF, JPEG, and PNG are bitmap file formats. The GIF File format is one of the simplest, low-resolution bitmap file formats, only supporting 256 colors per image. As a result, however, GIF files can be extremely small in file size. Other common bitmap file formats are BMP (Windows bitmap), TGA, and TIFF. Most clip art is provided in a low resolution, bitmap file format which is unsuitable for scaling, transparent backgrounds, or good-quality printed materials. However, bitmap file formats are ideal for photos, especially when combined with lossy data compression algorithms such as those available for JPEG files.

In contrast to the grid format of bitmap images, Vector graphics file formats use geometric modeling to describe an image as a series of points, lines, curves, and polygons. Because the image is described using geometric data instead of fixed pixels, the image can be scaled to any size while retaining &quot;resolution independence&quot;, meaning that the image can be printed at the highest resolution a printer supports, resulting in a clear, crisp image. Vector file formats are usually superior in resolution and ease of editing as compared to bitmap file formats, but are not as widely supported by software and are not well-suited for storing pixel-specific data such as scanned photographs. In the early years of electronic clip art, vector illustrations were limited to simple line art representations. However, by the early 2000s, vector illustration tools could produce virtually the same illustrations as bitmap illustration tools, while still providing all of the advantages of vector file formats. The most common vector file format is Adobe&#x27;s EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) file format. Microsoft has a much simpler, less sophisticated vector file format called WMF (Windows Metafile). The World Wide Web Consortium has developed a new, XML-based vector file format called SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) and all major modern web browsers - including Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer 9, Google Chrome, Opera, and Safari have at least some degree of support for SVG and can render the markup directly. For those with image-editing experience or interest to work with vector file formats, vector clip art provides the most flexible, highest quality images.

== Image rights ==

All clip art usage is governed by the terms of individual copyrights and usage rights. The copyright and usage rights of a clip art image are important to understand so that the image is used in a legal, permitted way. The three most common categories of image rights are royalty free, rights managed, and public domain.

Most commercial clip art is sold with a limited royalty free license which allows customers to use the image for most personal, educational and non-profit applications. Some royalty free clip art also includes limited commercial rights (the right to use images in for-profit products). However, royalty free image rights often vary from vendor to vendor. Some fine art, clip art is still sold on a rights managed basis. However this type of image rights has seen a steep decline in the past 20 years as royalty free licenses have become the preferred model for clip art. Public domain images continue to be one of the most popular types of clip art because the image rights are free. However, many images are erroneously described as part of the public domain are actually copyrighted, and thus illegal to use without proper permissions. The main cause for this confusion is because once a public domain image is redrawn or edited in any way, it becomes a brand new image which is copyrightable by the editor.

The United States District Court ruled in 1999 as part of Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp that exact copies of public domain images were not restricted under US copyright law, however the scope of this ruling only applies to photographs currently. It is &quot;originality,&quot;not skill, neither experience nor effort, which affects copyrightability of derivative images. In fact, the US Supreme Court in Feist v. Rural ruled that the difficulty of labor and expenses must be rejected as considerations in copyrightability. Copyright on other clipart stands in contrast to exact replica photographs of paintings. The large clip art libraries produced by Dover Publications or the University of South Florida&#x27;s Clipart ETC project are based on public domain images, but because they have been scanned and edited by hand, they are now derivative works and copyrighted, subject to very specific usage policies. In order for a clip art image based on a public domain source to be truly in the public domain, the proper rights must be granted by the individual or organization which digitized and edited the original source of the image.

The popularity of the Web has facilitated widespread copying of pirated clip art which is then sold or given away as &quot;free clip art&quot;. Virtually all images published after January 1, 1923 still have copyright protection under the laws of most countries. Images published prior to 1923 need to be carefully researched to make sure they are in the public domain. Creative Commons licenses is the forefront of the copyleft movement or a new form of free digital clipart and photo image distribution. Many websites such as Flickr and Interartcenter use Creative Commons as an alternative to the full attribution copyrights. The exception for clip art illustrations created after 1923 are those which are specifically donated to the public domain by the artist or publisher. For vector art, the open source community established Openclipart in 2004 as a clearinghouse for images which are legitimately donated to the public domain by their copyright owners. By 2014, the library contained over 50,000 vector images.

<text>Agno () is a historic town and a municipality in the district of Lugano in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland. Due to its position on Lake Lugano it is popular with tourists, and hosts summer festivals, with two hotels and several camping grounds. It is served by the Lugano-Agno airport.

The official language of Agno is Italian.

==History==
Agno is first mentioned in 818 as &quot;Anium&quot;. It was known by its German name &quot;Eng&quot;, though this is no longer used.
===Pieve of Agno===

The emergence of the &quot;Pieve&quot; or Parish of Agno is related to the spread of Christianity in late-Roman era along the Milan-Como-Riva San Vitale axis. The dedication of the church to Saint John the Baptist (&quot;San Giovanni Battista&quot;) refers to its character as a baptistery. Documents from the years 735 and 818 (deed of gift by King Louis the Pious) testify to the existence of a religious center at Agno. Originally, it was probably an Ambrosian Rite church, but in 1002-04 it came into the possession of the Bishop of Como. A collegiate chapel is first mentioned in 1192. The first known pastor is Gulielmus de Merchurolo in 1288. The extent of the parish (from Bironico to Marchirolo) is mentioned in the manuscript of Sessa from 1352.

The visitation records of Bishop Giovanni Antonio Volpe of Como (1571) give a detailed report on the properties of the parishes belonging to the &quot;Pieve&quot; and the sub-parishes. On Swiss soil it included: Agno, Aranno, Arosio, Astano, Bedigliora, Bironico, Bioggio, Bosco Luganese, Breno, Cademario, Camignolo, Caslano, Castelrotto, Curio, Ison, Magliaso, Medeglia, Mezzovico, Miglieglia, Mugena Muzzano, Neggio, Novaggio, Ponte Tresa, Pura Rivera, Robasacco, S. Abbondio (Gentilino and Montagnola), S. Maria (Iseo and Cimo), Sessa, Sigirino, S. Pietro di Gravesano, Torricella Vernate, Vezio and Vira. The &quot;Pieve&quot; also included a number of villages, which are now in Italy. These included: Arbizzo, Ardena, Cadegliano, Cremenaga, Cugliate, Fabiasco, Lavena, Marchirolo, Marzio, Viconago.

Initially it was under the authority of Como, and later the Duchy of Milan. At the beginning of the 15th Century it was part of the &quot;communitas Vallis Lugani&quot; and appointed representatives to the Council of the Bailiwick. Following the Act of Mediation of 1803, the parish lost its political meaning entirely.

===Community of Agno===

Because of its strategic location at the northern end of an arm of Lake Lugano and along the Varese-Ponte Tresa-Monte Ceneri road, Agno was possibly the center of a Roman Pagus. Some of the archeological finds from Roman Agno are in the local Museo plebano. As a central town, Agno became a commercial center with numerous market privileges. One of these markets, the Fair of S. Provino (second Monday in March) has survived to this day.

These holdings of the Bishop of Milan in Agno during the Middle Ages included fishing rights. These rights later went to the Bishop of Como and then to local private ownership. The fishing rights were finally removed by Swiss authorities in 1843.

The Collegiate Church of San Giovanni Battista stands on the foundations of a previous Roman building. Within the church are the relics of the patron saint, San Provino, who was the second Bishop of Como. The oldest village lay at the foot of the church, and later, the settlement extended to the hills and along the streets.

The correction of the Vedeggio river course was done in 1906, which opened up additional agricultural land in Agno. After World War II the town grew rapidly from trade and industry. The emergence of tourism as an economic factor is reflected in population growth from 1960. In 1980, the Lugano-Agno airport opened allowing scheduled flights into nearby Lugano. Its importance is continually growing both in terms of tourism in Ticino and the development of a financial center in Lugano. In 1990, there were 16,270 flights and 300,000 passengers into the airport. In 1996, the Federal Council granted additional concession, which allowed the expansion of infrastructure to accommodate 700,000 passengers annually.

<text>The Papiermark (; &#x27;paper mark&#x27;, officially just &quot;Mark&quot;, sign: ℳ︁) was the German currency from 4 August 1914 when the link between the Goldmark and gold was abandoned, due to the outbreak of World War I. In particular, the Papiermark was the currency issued during the hyperinflation in Germany of 1922 and 1923.

==History==

From 1914, the value of the mark fell. The rate of inflation rose following the end of World War I and reached its highest point in October 1923. The currency stabilized in November 1923 after the announcement of the creation of the Rentenmark, although the Rentenmark did not come into circulation until 1924. When it did, it replaced the Papiermark at the rate of 1-trillion (1012)-ℳ︁ to RM1. On 30 August 1924 the Rentenmark was replaced by the Reichsmark.

In addition to the issues of the government, emergency issues of both tokens and paper money, known as &quot;Kriegsgeld&quot; (war money) and &quot;Notgeld&quot; (emergency money), were produced by local authorities.

The Papiermark was also used in the Free City of Danzig until it was replaced by the Danzig Gulden in late 1923. Several coins and emergency issues in Papiermark were issued by the free city.

==Coins==

During the war, cheaper metals were introduced for coins, including aluminium, zinc and iron, although silver ℳ︁ pieces continued in production until 1919. Aluminium 1&quot;₰&quot; were produced until 1918 and the 2&quot;₰&quot; until 1916. Whilst iron 5&quot;₰&quot;, both iron and zinc 10&quot;₰,&quot; and aluminium 50&quot;₰&quot; coins were issued until 1922. Aluminium 3ℳ︁ were issued in 1922 and 1923, and aluminium 200ℳ︁ and 500ℳ︁ were issued in 1923. The quality of many of these coins varied from decent to poor.

During this period, many provinces and cities also had their own corresponding coin and note issues, referred to as Notgeld currency. This came about often due to a shortage of exchangeable tender in one region or another during the war and hyperinflation periods. Some of the most memorable of these to be issued during this period came from Westphalia and featured the highest face value denominations on a coin ever, eventually reaching 1-billion-ℳ︁.

===First World War issues===
In 1914, the State Loan Office began issuing paper money known as &quot;Darlehnskassenschein&quot; (loan fund notes). These circulated alongside the issues of the Reichsbank. Most were 1ℳ︁ and 2ℳ︁ notes but there were also 5ℳ︁, 20ℳ︁, 50ℳ︁ and 100ℳ︁ notes.

===Post War issues===
Between 1914 and the end of 1923 the Papiermark&#x27;s rate of exchange against the U.S. dollar plummeted from 4.2ℳ︁ = US$1 to 4.2-trillionℳ︁ = US$1. The price of one gold mark ( mg of pure gold) in German paper currency at the end of 1918 was 2ℳ︁, but by the end of 1919 a gold mark cost 10ℳ︁. This inflation worsened between 1920 and 1922, and the cost of a gold mark (or conversely the devaluation of the paper mark) rose from 15ℳ︁ to 1,282ℳ︁. In 1923 the value of the paper mark had its worst decline. By July, the cost of a gold mark had risen to 101,112ℳ︁, and in September was already at 13-million-ℳ︁. On 30 Nov 1923 it cost 1-trillion-ℳ︁ to buy a single gold mark.

In October 1923, Germany experienced a 29,500% hyperinflation (roughly 21% interest per day). Historically, this one-month inflation rate has only been exceeded three times: Yugoslavia, 313,000,000% (64.6% per day, January 1994); Zimbabwe, 79.6 billion% (98% per day, November 2008); and Hungary, 41.9 quadrillion% (207% per day, July 1946).

On 15 November 1923 the Papiermark was replaced by the Rentenmark at RM4.2 Rentenmark = US$1, or 1 trillion-ℳ︁ = RM1 (exchangeable through July 1925).

During the hyperinflation, ever higher denominations of banknotes were issued by the Reichsbank and other institutions (notably the Reichsbahn railway company). The Papiermark was produced and circulated in enormously large quantities. Before the war, the highest denomination was 1,000ℳ︁, equivalent to approximately £stg48.9 or US$238.09. In early 1922, 10,000ℳ︁ notes were introduced, followed by 100,000ℳ︁ and 1-million-ℳ︁ notes in February 1923. July 1923 saw notes up to 50-million-ℳ︁, with 10-milliard (1010)-ℳ︁ notes introduced in September. The hyperinflation peaked in October 1923 and banknote denominations rose to 100-trillion (1014)-ℳ︁. At the end of the hyperinflation, these notes were worth approximately £stg5.2 or US$23.81.

==Weimar Republic (1920–24)==


==Danzig==
The Danziger Privat Actien-Bank (opened 1856) was the first bank established in Danzig. They issued two series of notes denominated in thalers (1857 and 1862–73) prior to issuing the mark (1875, 1882, 1887). These mark issues are extremely rare. The Ostbank fur Handel and Gewerbe opened 16 March 1857, and by 1911 two additional banks (the Imperial Bank of Germany and the Norddeutsche Credit-Anstalt) were in operation.

===Issuance of the Danzig Papiermark===
The Papiermark was issued by Danzig from 1914 to 1923. Five series were issued during World War I by the City Council (1914, 1916, 1918 first and second issue, and 1919). Denominations ranged from 10₰ to 20ℳ︁. The Free City of Danzig municipal senate issued an additional four post-World War I series of notes (1922, 1923 First issue, 1923 Provisional issue, and 1923 Inflation issue). The 1922 issue (31 October 1922) was denominated in 100ℳ︁, 500ℳ︁, and 1,000ℳ︁ notes. The denominations for the 1923 issue were 1,000ℳ︁ (15 March 1923), and 10,000ℳ︁ and 50,000ℳ︁ notes (20 March 1923). The 1923 provisional issue reused earlier notes with a large red stamp indicating the new (and higher) denominations of 1 million-ℳ︁ (8 August 1923) and 5 million-ℳ︁ (15 October 1923) mark. The last series of Danzig mark was the 1923 inflation issue of 1 million-ℳ︁ (8 August 1923), 10 million-ℳ︁ (31 August 1923), 100 million-ℳ︁ (22 September 1923), 500 million-ℳ︁ (26 September 1923), 5 billion-ℳ︁ and 10 billion-ℳ︁ notes (11 October 1923). The Danzig mark was replaced by the Danzig gulden, first issued by the Danzig Central Finance Department on 22 October 1923.

==Note on numeration==

In German, &quot;&quot; is 1,000,000,000, or one thousand million, while &quot;&quot; is 1,000,000,000,000, or one million million.

<text>Apollonius Dyscolus (; reached his maturity sometime around 130 CE) is considered one of the greatest of the Greek grammarians.

==Life==
Little is known of Apollonius Dyscolus, other than that he was born at Alexandria, son of Mnesitheus. The precise dates for his life are not known. His son Aelius Herodianus, who wrote on phonology, appears to have moved to Rome at the time of Marcus Aurelius. From this it is inferred that his father must have been a contemporary of Hadrian, and may have spent a short period in Rome during the reign of Antoninus Pius. One tradition holds that he was so poor that he could not afford papyri to write on, and was constrained to avail himself of potsherds to write down his thoughts. His monicker &quot;ho dúskolos&quot; signifying &quot;the difficult&quot; or &quot;crabby/grouchy&quot; may reflect the sour temper of someone reduced to eking out a living in extreme indigence. Various interpretations have been advanced arguing the nickname was expressive of his highly compressed, difficult style, or as illustrating his cantankerously disputatious manner, or as alluding to his habit of citing arcane words in contests with other grammarians, in order to perplex them. He died in poverty in what was formerly the royal quarter of the city of Alexandria.

==Works==
He was the founder of scientific syntax, and is styled by Priscian &quot;maximus auctor artis grammaticae&quot; (&#x27;the greatest authority on the science of grammar&#x27;), and &quot;grammaticorum princeps&quot; (&#x27;prince of grammarians&#x27;). He wrote extensively on the parts of speech. Of the twenty books named in the &quot;Suda&quot;, four are extant: on syntax, and three smaller treatises: on adverbs, on conjunctions, and on pronouns. One characteristic which was to influence later generations was Apollonius&#x27; deployment of philosophical concepts in grammatical analysis. The earlier Alexandrine grammatical tradition was familiar with distinctions such as that between &quot;genos&quot; and &quot;&quot;, but these were not used in refining distinctions between the parts of speech. Apollonius drew on Stoic ontology to analyse the noun and the verb.

Like his son, Aelius Herodianus, he had an enormous influence on all later grammarians.

<doc id="840564" wikidata="Q7231041" url="?curid=840564" title="Port William, Dumfries and Galloway">
<text>Port William () is a fishing village in the parish of Mochrum in the historical county of Wigtownshire, Dumfries and Galloway, in Scotland with a population of approximately 460.

Port William has a post office and small general store, a takeaway, a restaurant, a community charity shop and a couple of other stores. Beyond Port William, the nearest shopping is in Whithorn, whilst the nearest supermarkets are in Newton Stewart.

Monreith House, a category A listed Georgian mansion is located east of the village.

==Location==
The village is on the coast of Luce Bay in Galloway and is situated between the small villages of Elrig and Mochrum to the north and Monreith to the south. It looks towards the Mull of Galloway (the most southerly point of the Scottish mainland), on a clear day both Ireland and The Isle of Man (lying only to the south across the Irish Sea) are clearly visible.

Port William lies west of Dumfries, east of Stranraer and south of Glasgow.

==History==
The original settlement was known as Killantrae, meaning &#x27;The Church on the Beach&#x27; in Gaelic, and was probably founded not long after St Ninian&#x27;s arrival in nearby Whithorn towards the end of the 4th century.

Killantrae was swept away following the intervention of developer and landlord Sir William Maxwell, 5th Baronet, of Monreith House. In the five years until 1776 he built an entirely new village, complete with a good harbour and renamed it Port William. One of the earliest buildings still standing was the corn mill, located on the side of the Killantrae burn to take advantage of the power provided by its water. Port William is an example of a planned village, lying on the eastern shore of Luce Bay. The harbour, built for the convenience of his tenant farmers, was one of the first in western Galloway.

In the 17th and 18th centuries Port William was known as much for the illicit activities of its smugglers as for the legitimate trade of its port.

==Notable people==
Gavin Maxwell FRSL, FIAL, FZS (Sc.), FRGS was a Scottish naturalist and author, best known for his non-fiction writing and his work with otters. Maxwell was born at The House of Elrig near the small village of Elrig, near Port William. Maxwell&#x27;s relatives still live in the area and the family&#x27;s ancient estate and grounds are in nearby Monreith.

==Port William Inshore Rescue Service Action Committee==
The village formed one of the first Community First Response Teams in Scotland and has helped to set up other teams in the area. Following several incidents involving vessels in difficulties in Luce Bay the RNLI were asked to site a lifeboat at Port William, when this was denied the villagers formed a committee known as the Port William Inshore Rescue Service Action Committee (PIRSAC).

Funds were raised to buy and staff an inshore rescue boat, this was launched in 1979 and it still operates today, covering Luce Bay, Wigtown Bay and the inshore waters between South West Scotland and the Isle of Man.

==The Harbour==
The harbour was extended in 1790 and again in 1848; its commercial importance continuing until the end of World War I.

Further work was done to protect the harbour in the 1980s by building a breakwater to the western side of the harbour.

A statue of a fisherman overlooks the harbour: once made of concrete, it has been cast in bronze. The statue was part-funded by the millennium lottery fund. In front of the statue is a plaque with the first verse of the poem &quot;Leisure&quot; by W. H. Davies.

<text>A grater, also known as a shredder, is a kitchen utensil used to grate foods into fine pieces.

==Uses==

===Food preparation===

Several types of graters feature different sizes of grating slots, and can therefore aid in the preparation of a variety of foods. They are commonly used to grate vegetables, cheese and lemon or orange peel (to create zest), spices, such as ginger and nutmeg, and can also be used to grate other soft foods. They are commonly used in the preparation of toasted cheese, Welsh rarebit, egg salad, and dishes which contain cheese sauce such as macaroni and cheese, and cauliflower cheese.

In Slavic cuisine, graters are commonly used to grate potatoes for preparation of dishes, including draniki, bramborak or potato babka.

In tropical countries graters are also used to grate coconut meat. In the Indian subcontinent, the grater is used for preparation of a popular dessert, Gajar Ka Halwa.

Graters produce shreds that are thinner at the ends than the middle. This allows the grated material to melt or cook in a different manner than the shreds of mostly uniform thickness produced by the grating blade of a food processor. Hand-grated potatoes, for example, melt together more easily in a potato pancake than food-processed potato shreds.

===In music===
In Jamaica and Belize, coconut graters are used as a traditional musical instrument (along with drums, fife, and other instruments) in the performance of kumina, jonkanoo, brukdown, and sometimes mento.

==History==
The first attested graters were made out of bronze, and also silver alloys, in the early first millennium BCE, examples of which were uncovered from burial sites in Greece and Etruscan Italy. In line with Homer&#x27;s Iliad, these were sometimes used to grate goat&#x27;s cheese in the making of a type of Kykeon, a fast-breaking drink. The modern cheese grater was invented in France in the 1540s by François Boullier. His pewter design was intended to convert hard cheeses into something more edible.

==Variants==
Spiralizers are complex food-processing machines with grater-like mechanisms. These mechanisms rotate by the turn of a cluster to produce ribbons or noodles.

==Images==


==In popular culture==
* Kevin Eastman, co-creator of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, got the idea for the Shredder&#x27;s armor from large cheese graters which he envisioned on a villainous character&#x27;s arms to be used as weapons. Originally called &quot;Grate Man&quot;, the Shredder is known as the primary antagonist in the TMNT franchise.
* Wisconsin sports fans are often called cheeseheads, and some wear cheese hats. In 2013, sports fans of Chicago and Minnesota replied to their rivals by wearing cheese graters.

<text>Horgen is a municipality in the district of Horgen in the canton of Zürich in Switzerland.

It is one of the larger towns along the south bank of the Lake of Zurich.

On 1 January 2018 the former municipality of Hirzel merged into the municipality of Horgen.

== History ==
Horgen is also the type-site of Switzerland&#x27;s middle Neolithic archaeological culture. The settlement there, the so-called &quot;Horgner Kultur&quot; (Horgen culture), produced examples of a type of crude pottery with parallels to the Seine-Oise-Marne culture of northern France. Horgen is first mentioned in 952 as &quot;Horga&quot;.

==Geography==

Horgen has an area of . Of this area, 27.7% is used for agricultural purposes, while 49.9% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 20.4% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (2%) is non-productive (rivers, glaciers or mountains). housing and buildings made up 12.5% of the total area, while transportation infrastructure made up the rest (7.9%). Of the total unproductive area, water (streams and lakes) made up 1.6% of the area. , 16% of the total municipal area was undergoing some type of construction.

The large municipality stretches from the shores of Lake Zurich (elevation ), near Wädenswil over the Zimmerberg-Plateau where the decentralized village of Horgenberg is found (elevation ), though the Sihl Valley (&quot;Sihltal&quot;), to the peak of the Albis chain (elevation ). It includes the villages of Horgen, Arn and Horgenberg.

Until 1773, Horgen included the now separate municipalities of Oberrieden and Hirzel. The Sihl forest (&quot;Sihlwald&quot;) became part of the city of Zürich in 1803. However the Horgen city council refused to acknowledge this until 1877.

==Demographics==
Horgen has a population (as of ) of . , 27.1% of the population was made up of foreign nationals. the gender distribution of the population was 49% male and 51% female. Over the last 10 years the population has grown at a rate of 10.7%. Most of the population () speaks German (79.9%), with Italian being second most common ( 5.7%) and Albanian being third ( 2.8%).

In the 2007 election the most popular party was the SVP which received 35.6% of the vote. The next three most popular parties were the SPS (18.9%), the FDP (15.8%) and the CSP (9.7%).

The age distribution of the population () is children and teenagers (0–19 years old) make up 20.7% of the population, while adults (20–64 years old) make up 64.1% and seniors (over 64 years old) make up 15.2%. In Horgen about 73% of the population (between age 25–64) have completed either non-mandatory upper secondary education or additional higher education (either university or a &quot;Fachhochschule&quot;). There are 7850 households in Horgen.

The historical population is given in the following table:
== Transportation==
The A3 motorway passes through the municipality and has a junction in the south of the town.

The municipality of Horgen is served by three railway stations. Of these two are relatively close to each other in the lakeside part of the municipality, while the other is some distance away from the centre of the town in the Sihl Valley:
* Horgen is on the Lake Zurich left bank line and is served by Zurich S-Bahn lines S2 and S8. The station is in the town centre and adjacent to the lake.
* Horgen Oberdorf is on the Thalwil–Arth-Goldau line, and is served by the S24. Horgen Oberdorf station is some uphill from Horgen station.
* Sihlwald is on the Sihltalbahn and is the terminus of the S4. Sihlwald station is in the Sihl Valley, about north of the closed Sihlbrugg station. The Sihtalbahn continues to Sihlbrugg station, but this stretch of line no longer carries regular passenger service.

The Zimmerberg bus line (&quot;Zimmerbergbus&quot;), provided by the Sihltal Zürich Uetliberg Bahn (SZU), connects the Zimmerberg region and parts of the Sihl Valley.

In the summer there are regular boats to Zürich-Bürkliplatz as well as along the lake to Rapperswil, run by the Zürichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft. The Horgen–Meilen car ferry connects Horgen and Meilen across the width of Lake Zurich, and one of the line&#x27;s ships carries the name &quot;Horgen&quot;.

== Reformed Church ==

The Horgen Reformed Church by architect Johann Jakob Haltiner, consecrated in 1782, is one of the most important Swiss buildings of Protestant church architecture: The transept became the main church while the nave was omitted, similar to the church of Wädenswil (1767). The transverse oval central church, a bold solution, is based on a circle with a diameter of 17 m. In the main axis, two circles abut each other in the floor plan, which are connected with arc segments of circles of twice the diameter. The determination of the room height can in turn be traced back to circles with a diameter of 17 meters. Haltiner consistently leads this curved floor plan into the roof. The stucco was made by Andreas Moosbrugger at the same time. In 1865 the church received its first stained glass paintings and in 1874 the two fresco paintings on both sides of the pulpit. The first organ from 1884 was replaced by the current one in 1961.

<text>Inman Square is a neighborhood and historic district in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It lies north of Central Square, at the junction of Cambridge, Hampshire, and Inman Streets near the Cambridge–Somerville border.

==Location==
Like many squares in the Boston area, Inman Square refers both to an intersection and to a retail district and neighborhood. Current residents of the area seem to converge on a broad definition of Inman Square as the region centered on the intersection of Cambridge and Hampshire Streets.

Geologically, the area is part of the larger Boston Basin and attaches to the relative lowland known as the Cambridge Plain. Originally, the land was both flat and surrounded by an irregular, swampy region that formed a natural boundary. Situated a short walk east of Harvard Square, north of Central Square, south of Union Square, and west of Lechmere (also known as East Cambridge), Inman Square is fairly centralized within the Mid-Cambridge/Somerville area. Hampshire Street connects it with Porter Square to the northwest and Kendall Square to the southeast.

==History==

=== 18th century ===
Inman Square likely owes its name to Ralph Inman (1713–1788), described as a gentleman of fortune and a Boston merchant. The details of his life can be pieced together from articles in the New England and Genealogical Register, vols. 12, 14, 25, 26, 30, 55, 84, 112, and 136, as well as numerous other sources. He had extensive business interests along the Boston wharf and with Thomas Sodden owned making up &quot;what is now the Port.&quot;

Inman also owned a &quot;large, three-story rambling mansion&quot; in a &quot;&quot; This included the Brattles, after whom Brattle Square was named.

During the American Revolutionary War, in 1775, American general Israel Putnam took over Inman&#x27;s house as his headquarters. Inman was intent on remaining neutral in the war, but his intentions went for naught when his son joined the British Army, causing authorities to begin confiscating his property. He fled, leaving his wife, Elizabeth Murray, to deal with General Putnam and protect the property.

Inman&#x27;s wife, his second, was a business woman in her own right. Elizabeth Murray owned the sugar warehouse in Boston that the British troops took over as a barracks when they came to settle the unrest in Boston. It was from there that they marched to the Battles of Lexington and Concord. When her husband fled to Boston to seek protection from the British, Elizabeth Murray protected the Cambridge property. After the Battle of Bunker Hill, the Continental Army confiscated the property and her husband fled with the British to Halifax. She remained in America until she died in 1785.

An extensive description of the house is given in NE &amp; GR, July 1871, vol. 25, page 232. &quot;On the Inman street side&quot; and &quot;looking toward Boston road&quot; are mentioned. It was &quot;the first object of any interest in approaching the colleges from Boston ...&quot; At the time of the description, were still attached to it. Inman died there in 1788. His wife predeceased him.

=== 19th century ===

Inman Square&#x27;s origins lie in the growth of East Cambridge, starting at around 1790, when a group of financiers led by Andrew Craigie began buying up land around Lechmere Point, home to present-day CambridgeSide Galleria shopping mall, in an effort to build a toll bridge over the Charles River. After Craigie&#x27;s bridge was built, he constructed roads from the Lechmere area that had been laid out with a gridwork of streets. One of these roads was the Middlesex Turnpike, the present-day Hampshire Street, which connected Cambridge with Lowell and Boston, bringing regional traffic through the area. Craigie also laid out Cambridge Street, which would intersect with Hampshire, producing Inman Square in 1809.

By the 1860s, horse carts were common in the area and contributed to dwellings popping up along their routes. By 1900, full streetcar service was in the area, led by the Charles River Street Railway, which built its first railway through Inman Square in 1881. By 1874 the region was an urban center called both &quot;Atwood&#x27;s Corner&quot; and &quot;Inman Square.&quot; This ambiguity was fixed a year later in a petition that would make official the Inman Square moniker.

=== 20th century ===
After transportation brought people and commerce to the region, a new era of stability overtook Inman Square. From 1910 up until the early 1950s, streetcar, automobile, and foot traffic shuffled people to and from the square where architectural instead of transportation construction was taking place. During this period commercial dwellings popped up to service the local community: drugstores, taverns, markets, bakeries, delis, and an insurance company were among the many stores that called Inman Square home.

After the streetcars left Cambridge Street around 1950 the square became &quot;just a little bit out of the way&quot; yet remained &quot;around the corner from Harvard, Central, Kendall and Lechmere.&quot; Even though there is no direct rapid transit, three MBTA bus lines (69, 83, 91) stop in the square, making it accessible by mass transit. Post-streetcar visitors still regularly frequent the area&#x27;s restaurant and entertainment attractions.

The regional restaurant chain Legal Sea Foods began in Inman Square in 1950 as a fish market that also did a takeout business. Legal Sea Foods grew to a chain of 31 restaurants, including those in Kendall Square and in Copley Square in Boston, as well as in suburbs and cities throughout the region. After the original Legal Sea Foods location burned in a fire, it was rebuilt and became Cambridge Family Health. An ornate fish on the building facade at 237 Hampshire Street commemorates the previous presence.
From the 1960s through the late 1970s, next to Legal Seafoods one could find the home of the improvisational troupe The Proposition. Alumni of the troupe include actors Josh Mostel, Judith Kahan Paul Kreppel and original &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; cast member Jane Curtin. Later, in the 1980s, at the Ding Ho restaurant at 11 Springfield Street (where Ole Mexican Grill is presently located), such comedians as Steven Wright, Jimmy Tingle, Bobcat Goldthwait, and club founder Barry Crimmins got their start. Most, including future &quot;Tonight Show&quot; host Jay Leno, began by performing between sets of musical acts at the &quot;Ding&quot;, as it was known to locals. Leno&#x27;s first stage appearance took place there between sets of JT&#x27;s Mardi Gras Band and the Lawnchair Ladies.

===21st century ===

Inman Square is a culturally diverse neighborhood, home to professionals, working people, and students and professors from neighboring MIT and Harvard. Inman Square also has strong Brazilian and Portuguese influences, as can be seen in the storefronts lining Cambridge Street, especially to the east of Prospect Street.

Boston&#x27;s oldest continuously operating improvisational theater troupe, ImprovBoston, moved in 2008 from its longtime home in Inman Square to Prospect Street in nearby Central Square. ImprovBoston alumni include &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; panelist Adam Felber.
Inman Square was also home to the Center for New Words (originally the New Words Bookstore), one of the oldest and longest-running women&#x27;s bookstores in the country. Located at 186 Hampshire Street, it closed its retail business in the early 2000s. Meanwhile, from 2003 to early 2006, the Zeitgeist Gallery resided at 1353 Cambridge Street, after a fire drove it from its former home at the corner of Norfolk Street and Broadway. Run by a group of artists, musicians and activists, it was a focal point for art, music and community activism, and fostered avant garde, experimental and underground work.

A related space called Zeitgeist Outpost or Outpost 186, opened by former Zeitgeist volunteers, is now on the other side of Inman Square. It is, in fact, in the former New Words back room, where the women&#x27;s bookstore once held poetry readings, author presentations and acoustic concerts.

In 2013, the neighborhood near Inman Square attained some notoriety as the home of the two main suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing and the location of the Islamic Society of Boston, at which they occasionally attended services.

In 2023, &quot;Edge of the Forest,&quot; a 12-foot-tall steel sculpture of a deer by Brooklyn-based artist Mark Reigelman was installed in Inman Square. The sculpture was inspired by one of the square&#x27;s former names, &quot;Atwood&#x27;s Corner,&quot; with Atwood being a traditional surname for someone &quot;at the wood.&quot; The piece was funded via the City of Cambridge’s Percent-for-Art ordinance, which requires that 1 percent of costs of municipal construction projects be spent to develop public artwork.

<doc id="840577" wikidata="Q2033925" url="?curid=840577" title="Semimetal">
<text>A semimetal is a material with a small energy overlap between the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the valence band, but they do not overlap in momentum space. According to electronic band theory, solids can be classified as insulators, semiconductors, semimetals, or metals. In insulators and semiconductors the filled valence band is separated from an empty conduction band by a band gap. For insulators, the magnitude of the band gap is larger (e.g., &gt; 4 eV) than that of a semiconductor (e.g., &lt; 4 eV). Because of the slight overlap between the conduction and valence bands, semimetals have no band gap and a small density of states at the Fermi level. A metal, by contrast, has an appreciable density of states at the Fermi level because the conduction band is partially filled.

== Temperature dependency ==
The insulating/semiconducting states differ from the semimetallic/metallic states in the temperature dependency of their electrical conductivity. With a metal, the conductivity decreases with increases in temperature (due to increasing interaction of electrons with phonons (lattice vibrations)). With an insulator or semiconductor (which have two types of charge carriers – holes and electrons), both the carrier mobilities and carrier concentrations will contribute to the conductivity and these have different temperature dependencies. Ultimately, it is observed that the conductivity of insulators and semiconductors increase with initial increases in temperature above absolute zero (as more electrons are shifted to the conduction band), before decreasing with intermediate temperatures and then, once again, increasing with still higher temperatures. The semimetallic state is similar to the metallic state but in semimetals both holes and electrons contribute to electrical conduction. With some semimetals, like arsenic and antimony, there is a temperature-independent carrier density below room temperature (as in metals) while, in bismuth, this is true at very low temperatures but at higher temperatures the carrier density increases with temperature giving rise to a semimetal-semiconductor transition. A semimetal also differs from an insulator or semiconductor in that a semimetal&#x27;s conductivity is always non-zero, whereas a semiconductor has zero conductivity at zero temperature and insulators have zero conductivity even at ambient temperatures (due to a wider band gap).

== Classification ==
To classify semiconductors and semimetals, the energies of their filled and empty bands must be plotted against the crystal momentum of conduction electrons. According to the Bloch theorem the conduction of electrons depends on the periodicity of the crystal lattice in different directions.

In a semimetal, the bottom of the conduction band is typically situated in a different part of momentum space (at a different k-vector) than the top of the valence band. One could say that a semimetal is a semiconductor with a negative indirect bandgap, although they are seldom described in those terms.

Classification of a material either as a semiconductor or a semimetal can become tricky when it has extremely small or slightly negative band-gaps. The well-known compound Fe2VAl for example, was historically thought of as a semi-metal (with a negative gap ~ -0.1 eV) for over two decades before it was actually shown to be a small-gap (~ 0.03 eV) semiconductor using self-consistent analysis of the transport properties, electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient. Commonly used experimental techniques to investigate band-gap can be sensitive to many things such as the size of the band-gap, electronic structure features (direct versus indirect gap) and also the number of free charge carriers (which can frequently depend on synthesis conditions). Band-gap obtained from transport property modeling is essentially independent of such factors. Theoretical techniques to calculate the electronic structure on the other hand can often underestimate band-gap.

== Schematic ==

Schematically, the figure shows
The figure is schematic, showing only the lowest-energy conduction band and the highest-energy valence band in one dimension of momentum space (or k-space). In typical solids, k-space is three-dimensional, and there are an infinite number of bands.

Unlike a regular metal, semimetals have charge carriers of both types (holes and electrons), so that one could also argue that they should be called &#x27;double-metals&#x27; rather than semimetals. However, the charge carriers typically occur in much smaller numbers than in a real metal. In this respect they resemble degenerate semiconductors more closely. This explains why the electrical properties of semimetals are partway between those of metals and semiconductors.

== Physical properties ==
As semimetals have fewer charge carriers than metals, they typically have lower electrical and thermal conductivities. They also have small effective masses for both holes and electrons because the overlap in energy is usually the result of the fact that both energy bands are broad. In addition they typically show high diamagnetic susceptibilities and high lattice dielectric constants.

== Classic semimetals ==
The classic semimetallic elements are arsenic, antimony, bismuth, α-tin (gray tin) and graphite, an allotrope of carbon. The first two (As, Sb) are also considered metalloids but the terms semimetal and metalloid are not synonymous. Semimetals, in contrast to metalloids, can also be chemical compounds, such as mercury telluride (HgTe), and tin, bismuth, and graphite are typically not considered metalloids.
Transient semimetal states have been reported at extreme conditions. It has been recently shown that some conductive polymers can behave as semimetals.

<text>Rate-adaptive digital subscriber line (RADSL) is a pre-standard asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) solution. RADSL was introduced as proprietary technology by AT&amp;T Paradyne, later GlobeSpan Technologies Inc., in June 1996. In September 1999, RADSL technology was formally described by ANSI in T1.TR.59-1999. RADSL supports downstream data rates of up to approximately 8 Mbit/s, upstream data rates up to approximately 1 Mbit/s, and can coexist with POTS voice on the same line.

RADSL allows rate-adaptation while the connection is in operation — rate-adaptation during connection setup is possible in many other DSL variants, including G.dmt and its successors. Rate-adaptation while the connection is in operation is specified as an option in ADSL2, ADSL2+, and VDSL2, under the name &quot;seamless rate adaptation&quot; (SRA).

==Technology==
RADSL specifies two alternative modulation schemes, quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and carrierless amplitude phase modulation (CAP). RADSL is not interoperable with discrete multi-tone (DMT) modulation variants of ADSL, standardized in ANSI T1.413 Issue 2 and G.dmt (G.992.1). Upstream and downstream are frequency-division duplexed, the upstream and downstream transmit PSD masks are identical to those in ANSI T1.413.

In RADSL, the baud rate, center frequency, and constellation size of the downstream and upstream channels can be adjusted while the connection is in operation. Using this technique the line is more tolerant of errors caused by noise and signal loss. As the parameters are adjusted, the bandwidth may be markedly decreased if there is a large amount of line noise or signal degradation.
